### CHAPTER XI.

#### CUSTOMS CONNECTED WITH THE CALENDAR.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> years gone by the anniversaries
connected with the calendar were kept up with an amount of enthusiasm
and merrymaking quite unknown at the present day. Thus, for instance,
Shakespeare tells us, with regard to the May-day observance, that it was
looked forward to so eagerly as to render it impossible to make the
people sleep on this festive occasion. During the present century the
popular celebrations of the festivals have been gradually on the
decline, and nearly every year marks the disuse of some local custom.
Shakespeare has not omitted to give a good many scattered allusions to
the old superstitions and popular usages associated with the festivals
of the year, some of which still survive in our midst.

   Alluding to the revels, there can be no doubt that Shakespeare was
indebted to the revel-books for some of his plots. Thus, in the
"Tempest" (iv. 1), Prospero remarks to Ferdinand and Miranda, after
Iris, Ceres, and Juno have appeared, and the dance of the nymphs is
over:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"You look, my son, in a moved sort,  
 As if you were dismay’d; be cheerful, sir,  
 Our revels now are ended. These our actors,  
 As I foretold you, were all spirits and  
 Are melted into air, into thin air,  
 And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,  
 The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces,  
 The solemn temples, the great globe itself,  
 Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,  
 And like this insubstantial pageant faded,  
 Leave not a rack behind."</span>

</div>

   It has been inferred that Shakespeare was present at Kenilworth, in
1575, when Elizabeth was so grandly entertained

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

there. Lakes and seas are represented in the mask. Triton, in the
likeness of a mermaid, came towards the queen, says George Goscoyne, and
"Arion appeared sitting on a dolphin's back." In the dialogue in "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" between Oberon and Puck (ii. 1), there seems a
direct allusion to this event:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Oberon*. My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou
rememberst  
 Since once I sat upon a promontory,  
 And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back  
 Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath  
 That the rude sea grew civil at her song  
 And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,  
 To hear the sea-maid's music.  
 *Puck*.                                I remember," etc.</span>

</div>

   Then, too, there were the "Children of the Revels," a company who
performed at Blackfriars Theatre. In "Hamlet" (ii. 2), Shakespeare
alludes to these "children-players." <span
id="fr_643"></span>[1](#fn_641.md) Rosencrantz says, in the conversation
preceding the entry of the players, in reply to Hamlet's inquiry whether
the actors have suffered through the result of the late inhibition,
evidently referring to the plague, "Nay, their endeavour keeps in the
wonted pace; but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that
cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for
’t; these are now the fashion, and, so berattle the common stages—so
they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills, and
dare scarce come hither."

   *Twelfth-Day*.—There can be no doubt that the title of Shakespeare's
play, "Twelfth-Night," took its origin in the festivities associated
with this festival. The season has from time immemorial been one of
merriment, "the more decided from being the proper close of the
festivities of Christmas, when games of chance were traditionally rife,
and the sport of sudden and casual elevation gave the tone of the time.
Of like tone is the play, and to this," says Mr Lloyd, <span
id="fr_644"></span>[2](#fn_642.md) "it apparently owes its title." The
play, it appears, was probably originally acted at the barristers’ feast
at the Middle Temple,

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

on February 2, 1601–2, as Manningham tells us in his "Diary" (Camden
Society, 1868, ed. J. Bruce, p. 18). It is worthy of note that the
festive doings of the Inns of Court, in days gone by at Christmas-tide,
were conducted on the most extravagant scale. <span
id="fr_645"></span>[1](#fn_643.md) In addition to the merry disports of the
Lord of Misrule, there were various revels. The Christmas masque at
Gray's Inn, in 1594, was on a magnificent scale.

   *St Valentine's Day* (Feb. 14).—Whatever may be the historical origin
of this festival, whether heathen or Christian, there can be no doubt of
its antiquity. According to an old tradition, to which Chaucer refers,
birds choose their mates on this day; and hence, in the "Midsummer
Night's Dream" (iv. 1) Theseus asks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Good morrow, friends. St Valentine is past;  
 Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?"</span>

</div>

From this notion, it has been suggested, arose the once popular practice
of choosing valentines, and also the common belief that the first two
single persons who meet in the morning of St Valentine's day have a
great chance of becoming to each other. This superstition is alluded to
in Ophelia's song in "Hamlet" (iv. 5):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,  
   All in the morning betime,  
 And I a maid at your window,  
   To be your valentine."</span>

</div>

   There seems every probability that St Valentine's day, with its many
customs, has come down to us from the Romans, but was fathered upon St
Valentine in the earlier ages of the Church in order to Christianise
it. <span id="fr_646"></span>[2](#fn_644.md) In France the Valentine was a
moveable feast, celebrated on the first Sunday in Lent, which was called
the *jour des brandons*, because the boys carried about lighted torches
on that day.

   *Shrove-Tuesday*.—This day was formerly devoted to feasting and
merriment of every kind, but whence originated the custom of eating
pancakes is still a matter of uncertainty. The practice is alluded to in
"All's Well that Ends Well" (ii. 1),

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

where the clown speaks of "a pancake for Shrove-Tuesday." <span
id="fr_647"></span>[1](#fn_645) In "Pericles" (ii. 1.md) they are termed
"flap-jacks," a term used by Taylor, the water-poet, in his
"Jacke-a-Lent Workes" (1630, i. 115): "Until at last by the skill of the
cooke it is transformed into the form of a flap-jack, which in our
translation is called a pancake." Shrovetide was in times gone by a
season of such mirth that *shroving*, or to *shrove*, signified to be
merry. Hence in "2 Henry IV." (v. 3) Justice Silence says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Be merry, he merry, my wife has all;  
 For women are shrews, both short and tall;  
 ’Tis merry in hall, when beards wag all,  
   And welcome merry shrove-tide,  
 Be merry, be merry."</span>

</div>

It was a day of holiday and licence, for apprentices, labouring persons,
and others. <span id="fr_648"></span>[2](#fn_646.md)

   *Lent*—This season was at one time marked by a custom now fallen into
disuse. A figure made up of straw and castoff clothes, was drawn or
carried through the streets amid much noise and merriment; after which
it was either burnt, shot at, or thrown down a chimney. This image was
called a "Jack-a-Lent," and was, according to some, intended to
represent Judas Iscariot. It occurs twice in the "Merry Wives of
Windsor;" once merely as a jocular appellation (iii. 3), where Mrs Page
says to Robin, "you little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us;" and
once (v. 5) as a butt, or object of satire and attack, Falstaff
remarking, "how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when ’tis upon ill
employment!" It is alluded to by Ben Jonson in his "Tale of a Tub" (iv.
2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou cam’st but half a thing into the world,  
 And wast made up of patches, parings, shreds;  
 Thou, that when last thou wert put out of service,  
 Travell’d to Hamstead Heath on an Ash Wednesday,  
 Where thou didst stand six weeks the Jack of Lent,  
 For boys to hurl three throws a penny at thee,  
 To make thee a purse."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

   Elderton, in a ballad called "Lenton Stuff," in a MS. in the
Ashmolean Museum, thus concludes his account of Lent <span
id="fr_649"></span>[1](#fn_647.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When Jakke a’ Lent comes justlynge in,  
   With the hedpeece of a herynge,  
 And saythe, repent yowe of yower syn,  
   For shame, syrs, leve yowre swerynge:  
 And to Palme Sonday doethe he ryde,  
   With sprots and herryngs by his syde,  
 And makes an end of Lenton tyde!" <span
id="fr_650"></span>[2](#fn_648.md)</span>

</div>

   In the reign of Elizabeth, butchers were strictly enjoined not to
sell flesh meat in Lent, not with a religious view, but for the double
purpose <span id="fr_651"></span>[3](#fn_649.md) of diminishing the
consumption of flesh meat during that period, and so making it more
plentiful during the rest of the year, and of encouraging the fisheries
and augmenting the number of seamen. Butchers, however, who had an
interest at court, frequently obtained a dispensation to kill a certain
number of beasts a week during Lent; of which indulgence the wants of
invalids, who could not subsist without animal food, was made the
pretence. It is to this practice that Cade refers in "2 Henry VI." (iv.
3), where he tells Dick, the butcher of Ashford—"Therefore, thus will I
reward thee, the Lent shall be as long again as it is; and thou shalt
have a license to kill for a hundred lacking one."

   In "2 Henry IV." (ii. 4), Falstaff mentions an indictment against
Hostess Quickly, "for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house, contrary
to the law, for the which I think thou wilt howl." Whereupon she
replies, "all victuallers do so: what's a joint of mutton or two in a
whole Lent?"

   The sparing fare in olden days, during Lent, is indirectly referred
to by Rosencrantz in "Hamlet" (ii. 2)—"To think, my lord, if you delight
not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive." We may
compare, too, Maria's

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

words in "Twelfth Night" (i. 5), where she speaks of a good lenten
answer, *i.e.*, short.

   By a scrap of proverbial rhyme quoted by Mercutio in "Romeo and
Juliet" (ii. 4), and the speech introducing it, it appears that a stale
hare might be used to make a pie in Lent; he says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something
stale and hoar ere it be spent.

   An old hare hoar,  
   And an old hare hoar,  
 Is very good meat in Lent," &c.

</div>

   *Scambling days*.—The days so called were Mondays and Saturdays in
Lent, when no regular meals were provided, and our great families
scambled. There may possibly be an indirect allusion to this custom in
"Henry V." (v. 2), where Shakespeare makes King Henry say—"If ever thou
beest mine, as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I
get thee with scambling." In the old household book of the fifth Earl of
Northumberland, there is a particular section appointing the order of
service for these days, and so regulating the licentious contentions of
them. We may also compare another passage in the same play (i. 1), where
the Archbishop of Canterbury speaks of "the scambling and unquiet time."

   *Good Friday*.—Beyond the bare allusion to this day, Shakespeare
makes no reference to the many observances formerly associated with it.
In "King John" (i. 1), he makes Philip the bastard say to Lady
Faulconbridge:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Madam, I was not old Sir Robert's son:  
 Sir Robert might have eat his part in me  
 Upon Good Friday and ne’er broke his fast."</span>

</div>

And in "1 Henry IV." (i. 2), Poins enquires:—"Jack! how agrees the devil
and thee about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a
cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg."

   *Easter*.—According to a popular superstition it is considered
unlucky to omit wearing new clothes on Easter Day, to which Shakespeare
no doubt alludes in "Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 1), when he makes Mercutio
ask Benvolio whether he did "not fall out with a tailor for wearing his

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

new doublet before Easter." In East Yorkshire, on Easter Eve, young
folks go to the nearest market-town to buy some new article of dress or
personal ornament, to wear for the first time on Easter Day, as
otherwise they believe that birds—notably rooks or "crakes"—will spoil
their clothes. <span id="fr_652"></span>[1](#fn_650.md) In "Poor Robin's
Almanac" we are told:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"At Easter let your clothes be new  
 Or else be sure you will it rue."</span>

</div>

Some think that the custom of "clacking" at Easter—which is not quite
obsolete in some counties—is incidentally alluded to in "Measure for
Measure" (iii. 2), by Lucio:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"His use was to put a ducat in her
clack-dish." <span id="fr_653"></span>[2](#fn_651.md)</span>

</div>

   The clack or clap-dish was a wooden dish, with a moveable cover,
formerly carried by beggars, which they clacked and clattered to show
that it was empty. In this they received the alms. Lepers and other
paupers deemed infectious originally used it, that the sound might give
warning not to approach too near, and alms be given without touching the
person.

   A popular name for Easter-Monday was Black Monday, so called, says
Stow, because "in the 34th of Edward III. (1360), the 14th of April, and
the morrow after Easter-Day, King Edward, with his host, lay before the
city of Paris; which day was full dark of mist and hail, and so bitter
cold, that many men died on their horses’ backs with the cold. Wherefore
unto this day it hath been call’d the Blacke Monday." Thus in the
"Merchant of Venice" (ii. 5); Launcelot says "it was not for nothing
that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i’ the
morning."

   *St David's Day* (March 1st).—This day is observed by the Welsh in
honour of St David, their Patron Saint, when, as a sign of their
patriotism, they wear a leek. Much doubt exists as to the origin of this
custom. According to the Welsh, it is because St David ordered his
Britons to place leeks in their caps, that they might be distinguished
from their Saxon foes. Shakespeare introduces the custom into

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

his play of "Henry V." (iv. 6), where Fluellen addressing the Monarch
says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Your grandfather of famous memory, an ’t please
your majesty, and your great uncle Edward the Plack Prince of Wales, as
I have read in the chronicles, fought a most prave pattle here in
France.  
 *K. Hen*. They did, Fluellen.  
 *Flu*. Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is remembered of
it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow,
wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to this
hour is an honourable badge of the service; and, I do believe your
majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon St Tavy's day."</span>

</div>

   It has been justly pointed out, however, that this allusion by
Fluellen to the Welsh having worn the leek in battle under the Black
Prince, is not, as some writers suppose, wholly decisive of its having
originated in the fields of Cressy, but rather shows that when
Shakespeare wrote Welshmen wore leeks. In the same play, too (iv. 1),
the well-remembered Fluellen's enforcement of Pistol, to eat the leek he
had ridiculed, further establishes the wearing as a usage. <span
id="fr_654"></span>[1](#fn_652.md) Pistol says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate  
 Upon St Davy's day."</span>

</div>

   In days gone by, this day was observed by Royalty; and in 1695, we
read how William III. wore a leek on St David's Day, "presented to him
by his sergeant, Porter, who hath as perquisites all the wearing apparel
his majestie had on that day, even to his sword." It appears that
formerly, amongst other customs, a Welshman was burnt in effigy upon "St
Tavy's Day," an allusion to which occurs in "Poor Robin's Almanack" for
1757:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But it would make a stranger laugh,  
 To see th’ English hang poor Taff:  
 A pair of breeches and a coat,  
 Hat, shoes, and stockings, and what not,  
 And stuffed with hay, to represent  
 The Cambrian hero thereby meant."</span>

</div>

   *St Patrick's Day* (March 17th).—Shakespeare, in "Hamlet" (i. 5),
makes the Danish prince swear by St Patrick, on which

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Warburton remarks
that the whole northern world had their learning from Ireland. <span
id="fr_655"></span>[1](#fn_653.md) As Mr Singer <span
id="fr_656"></span>[2](#fn_654.md) observes, however, it is more probable
that the poet seized the first popular imprecation that came to his
mind, without regarding whether it suited the country or character of
the person to whom he gave it. Some, again, have supposed that there is
a reference here to St Patrick's purgatory, but this does not seem
probable.

   *St George's Day* (April 23rd).—St George, the guardian saint of
England, is often alluded to by Shakespeare. His festival, which was
formerly celebrated by feasts of cities and corporations, is now almost
passed over without notice. Thus Bedford, in "1 Henry VI." (i. 1),
speaks of keeping "our great Saint George's feast withal." "God and St
George," was once a common battle cry, several references to which occur
in Shakespeare's plays. Thus, in "Henry V." (iii. 1), the king says to
his soldiers <span id="fr_657"></span>[3](#fn_655.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cry, God for Harry, England and Saint
George."</span>

</div>

Again, in "1 Henry VI." (iv. 2), Talbot says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,  
 Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight."</span>

</div>

   The following injunction, from an old act of war, concerning the use
of St George's name in onsets, is curious—"Item, that all souldiers
entering into battaile, assault, skirmish, or other faction of armes,
shall have for their common crye and word, *St George, forward*, or
*upon them St George*, whereby the soldier is much comforted, and the
enemie dismaied, by calling to minde the ancient valour of England, with
which that name has so often been victorious." <span
id="fr_658"></span>[4](#fn_656.md)

   The combat of this saint on horseback with a dragon has been very
long established as a subject for sign painting. In "King John" (ii. 1),
Philip says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e’er
since  
 Sits on his horse back at mine hostess’ door."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is still a very
favourite sign. In London alone <span id="fr_659"></span>[1](#fn_657.md)
there are said to be no less than sixty-six public houses and taverns
with the sign of "St George and the Dragon," not counting beer-houses
and coffee-houses.

   *May day*.—The festival of May day has, from the earliest times, been
most popular in this country, on account of its association with the
joyous season of spring. It was formerly celebrated with far greater
enthusiasm than now-a-days, for Bourne tells us how the young people
were in the habit of rising a little after midnight and walking to some
neighbouring wood, accompanied with music and the blowing of horns,
where they broke down branches from the trees, which, decorated with
nosegays and garlands of flowers, were brought home soon after sunrise,
and placed at their doors and windows. Shakespeare, alluding to this
practice, informs us how eagerly it was looked forward to, and that it
was impossible to make the people sleep on May morning. Thus, in "Henry
VIII." (v. 4), it is said—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Pray, sir, be patient: ’tis as much impossible—  
 Unless we sweep ’em from the door with cannons  
 To scatter ’em, as ’tis to make ’em sleep  
 On May-day morning."</span>

</div>

   Again, in the "Midsummer Night's Dream" (i. 1), Lysander, speaking of
these May-day observances says to Hermia—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "If thou lovest me then,  
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;  
And in the wood, a league without the town,  
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,  
To do observance to a morn of May,  
There will I stay for thee."</span>

</div>

And Thersites says (iv. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"No doubt they rose up early to observe  
 The rite of May." <span id="fr_660"></span>[2](#fn_658.md)</span>

</div>

   In the "Two Noble Kinsmen" (i. 2), one of the four countrymen
asks—"Do we all hold against the maying?"

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

   In Chaucer's "Court of Love," we read that early on May-day "Fourth
goth al the Court, both most and lest, to fetche the flowris fresh and
blome." In the reign of Henry the Eighth, it is on record that the heads
of the Corporation of London went out into the high grounds of Kent to
gather the May, and were met on Shooter's Hill by the king and his
queen, Catherine of Arragon, as they were coming from the palace of
Greenwich. Until within a comparatively recent period this custom still
lingered in some of the counties. Thus, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, the
following doggerel was sung:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Rise up, maidens, fie for shame!  
For I've been four long miles from hame,  
I've been gathering my garlands gay,  
Rise up, fair maidens, and take in your May."</span>

</div>

   Many of the ballads sung now-a-days in country places by the village
children on May morning, as they carry their garlands from door to door,
undoubtedly refer to the old practice of going-a-Maying, although fallen
into disuse.

   In olden times nearly every village had its May-pole, around which,
decorated with wreaths of flowers, ribbons, and flags, our merry
ancestors danced from morning till night. The earliest representation of
an English May-pole is that published in the *Variorum* "Shakespeare,"
and depicted on a window at Betley, in Staffordshire, then the property
of Mr Tollet, and which he was disposed to think as old as the time of
Henry VIII. The pole is planted in a mound of earth, and has affixed to
it St George's red-cross banner, and a white pennon or streamer with a
forked end. The shaft of the pole is painted in a diagonal line of black
colours upon a yellow ground, a characteristic decoration of all these
ancient maypoles, as alluded to by Shakespeare in his "Midsummer Night's
Dream" (iii. 2), where it gives point to Hermia's allusion to her rival
Helena, as "a painted maypole." <span id="fr_661"></span>[1](#fn_659.md)
The popularity of the maypole in former centuries is shown by the fact
that one of our London parishes, St Andrew Undershaft, derives its name
from the maypole

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

which overhung its steeple, a reference to which we find made by
Geoffrey Chaucer, who, speaking of a vain boaster, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Right well aloft, and high ye bear your head,  
 As ye would bear the great shaft of Cornhill."</span>

</div>

   London, indeed, had several maypoles, one of which stood in Basing
Lane, near St Paul's Cathedral. It was a large fir pole, forty feet high
and fifteen inches in diameter, and fabled to be the justing staff of
Gerard the Giant. Only a few, however, of the old maypoles remain
scattered here and there throughout the country. One still supports a
weather-cock in the churchyard at Pendleton, Manchester; and in
Derbyshire, a few years ago, several were to be seen standing on some of
the village greens. The rhymes made use of as the people danced round
the maypole varied according to the locality, and oftentimes combined a
curious mixture of the jocose and sacred.

   Another feature of the May-day festivities was the Morris dance, the
principal characters of which generally were Robin Hood, Maid Marian,
Scarlet, Stokesley, Little John, the Hobby Horse, the Bavian or Fool,
Tom the Piper, with his pipe and tabor. The number of characters varied
much at different times and places. In "All's Well That Ends Well" (ii.
2), the Clown says—"As fit as ten groats for the hand of an attorney,—a
Morris for May-day." <span id="fr_662"></span>[1](#fn_660.md)

   In "2 Henry VI." (iii. 2) the Duke of York says of Cade—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                         "I have seen  
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,  
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells."</span>

</div>

   In the "Two Noble Kinsmen" (iii. 5) Gerrold, the schoolmaster, thus
describes to King Theseus the morris dance:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If you but favour, our country pastime made is.  
 We are a few of those collected here,  
 That rude tongues distinguish villagers; And, to say verity and not to
fable,  
 We are a merry rout, or else a rabble,  
 Or company, or, by a figure, choris,</span>

</div>

   Amongst the scattered allusions to the characters of this dance may
be noticed that in "1 Henry IV." (iii. 3):—"And for woman-hood, Maid
Marian may be the deputy's wife of the ward to thee,"—the allusion being
to "the degraded Maid Marian of the later morris dance, more male than
female." <span id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_661.md)

   The "hobby-horse," another personage of the morris dance on May-day,
was occasionally omitted, and appears to have given rise to a popular
ballad, a line of which is given by Hamlet (iii. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot."</span>

</div>

This is quoted again in "Love's Labour's Lost" (iii. 1). The hobby horse
was formed by a pasteboard horse's head, and a light frame made of
wicker-work to join the hinder parts. This was fastened round the body
of a man, and covered with a foot-cloth which nearly reached the ground
and concealed the

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

legs of the performer, who displayed his antic equestrian skill, and
performed various juggling tricks to the amusement of the bystanders. In
Sir Walter Scott's "Monastery" there is a spirited description of the
"hobby horse."

   The term "hobby horse" was applied to a loose woman, and in the
"Winter's Tale" (i. 2) it is so used by Leontes, who says to Camillo:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                               "Then say  
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name  
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to  
Before her troth-plight."</span>

</div>

   In "Othello" (iv. 1), Bianca, speaking of Desdemona's handkerchief,
says to Cassio:—"This is some minx's token, and I must take out the
work? There; give it your hobbyhorse."

   It seems also to have denoted a silly fellow, as in "Much Ado about
Nothing" (iii. 2), where it is so used by Benedick.

   Another character was Friar Tuck, the chaplain of Robin Hood, and as
such is noticed in the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (iv. 1), where one of
the outlaws swears—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat
friar."</span>

</div>

   He is also represented by Tollet as a Franciscan friar in the full
clerical tonsure, for, as he adds, "When the parish priests were
inhibited by the diocesan to assist in the May games, the Franciscans
might give attendance, as being exempted from Episcopal
jurisdiction." <span id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_662.md)

   It was no uncommon occurrence, for metrical interludes of a comic
species, and founded on the achievements of the outlaw Robin Hood, to be
performed after the Morris, on the Maypole green. Mr Drake thinks that
these interludes are alluded to in "Twelfth Night" (iii. 4), where
Fabian exclaims on the approach of Sir Andrew Aguecheek with his
challenge, "More matter for May morning."

   *Whitsuntide*.—Apart from its observance as a religious festival,
Whitsuntide was, in times past, celebrated with much ceremony. In the
Catholic times of England, it was usual to dramatise the descent of the
Holy Ghost, which this

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

festival commemorates. A custom which we find alluded to in Barnaby
Googe's translation of *Naogeorgus;*—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"On Whit-Sunday white pigeons tame in strings from
heaven flie,  
And one that framed is of wood still hangeth in the skie,  
Thou seest how they with idols play, and teach the people too:  
None otherwise than little girls with puppets used to do."</span>

</div>

   This custom appears to have been carried to an extravagant height in
Spain, for Mr Fosbroke <span id="fr_665"></span>[1](#fn_663.md) tells us
that the gift of the Holy Ghost was represented by "thunder from engines
which did much damage." Water, oak leaves, burning torches, wafers, and
cakes, were thrown down from the church roof; pigeons and small birds
with cakes tied to their legs were let loose; and a long censor was
swung up and down. In our own country, many costly pageants were
exhibited at this season. Thus, at Chester, the Whitsun Mysteries were
acted during the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Whitsun week. The
performers were carried from one place to another by means of a
scaffold—a huge and ponderous machine mounted on wheels, gaily decorated
with flags, and divided into two compartments—the upper of which formed
the stage, and the lower, defended from vulgar curiosity by coarse
canvas draperies, answered the purposes of a green room. To each craft
in the city, a separate mystery was allotted. Thus, the drapers
exhibited the "Creation," the tanners took the Fall of Lucifer, the
water-carriers of the Dee acted the Deluge, etc. The production, too, of
these pageants was extremely costly; indeed, each one has been set down
at fifteen or twenty pounds sterling. An allusion to this custom is made
in the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (iv. 4), where Julia says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "—At Pentecost,  
When all our pageants of delight were play’d,  
Our youth got me to play the woman's part,  
And I was trimm’d in Madam Julia's gown."</span>

</div>

   The Morris dance, too, was formerly a common accompaniment to the
Whitsun ales, a practice which is still kept

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

up in many parts of the country. In "Henry V." (ii. 4), the Dauphin thus
alludes to it:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "I say ’tis meet we all go forth  
To view the sick and feeble parts of France  
And let us do it with no show of fear;  
No, with no more than if we heard that England  
Were busied with a Whitsun Morris dance."</span>

</div>

And once more in the "Winter's Tale" (iv. 4), Perdita says to Florizel:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Methinks I play as I have seen them do  
 In Whitsun pastorals."</span>

</div>

   A custom formerly kept up in connection with Whitsuntide was the
"Whitsun ale." Ale was so prevalent a drink amongst us in olden times as
to become a part of the name of various festal meetings, as Leet ale,
Lamb ale, Bride ale (bridal), and, as we see, Whitsun ale. Thus our
ancestors were in the habit of holding parochial meetings every
Whitsuntide, usually in some barn near the church, consisting of a kind
of pic-nic, as each parishioner brought what victuals he could spare.
The ale, which had been brewed pretty strong for the occasion, was sold
by the churchwardens, and from its profits a fund arose for the repair
of the church. <span id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_664.md) These meetings are
referred to by Shakespeare in "Pericles" (i. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"It hath been sung at festivals,  
 On ember-eves and holy ales"</span>

</div>

   In "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (ii. 5), when Launce tells Speed, "Thou
hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian,"
these words have been explained to mean the rural festival so named,
though, as Mr Dyce remarks ("Glossary," p. 10), the previous words of
Launce, "go with me to the ale-house," shows this explanation to be
wrong.

   In the old miracle-plays performed at this and other seasons Herod
was a favourite personage, and was generally represented as a tyrant of
a very overbearing, violent character. Thus Hamlet says (iii. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">   "O, it offends me to the soul to hear a
robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags,
to split the ears of the groundlings,</span>

</div>

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumb-shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped
for o’er-doing Termagant: it out-herods Herod."</span>

</div>

On this account Alexas mentions him as the most daring character when he
tells Cleopatra (iii. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "Good majesty,  
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you  
But when you are well pleased."</span>

</div>

   In the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (ii. 1), Mrs Page speaks of him in
the same signification—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What a Herod of Jewry is this!"</span>

</div>

   Mr Dyce in his "Glossary" (p. 207) has this note:—"If the reader
wishes to know what a swaggering, uproarious tyrant Herod was
represented to be in those old dramatic performances let him turn to
'Magnus Herodes' in 'The Towneley Mysteries,' p. 140, ed. Surtees
Society; to 'King Herod' in the 'Coventry Mysteries,' p. 188, ed.
Shakespeare Society; and to 'The Slaughter of the Innocents' in 'The
Chester Plays,' vol. i., p. 172, ed. Shakespeare Society.'"

   Like Herod, Termagant <span id="fr_667"></span>[1](#fn_665.md) was a
hectoring tyrant of the miracle plays, and as such is mentioned by
Hamlet in the passage quoted above. Hence in course of time the word was
used as an adjective, in the sense of violent, as in "1 Henry IV." (v.
4), "this hot Termagant Scot." Hall mentions him in his first satire—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nor fright the reader with the Pagan vaunt  
 Of mighty Mahound and great Termagaunt."</span>

</div>

   Whilst speaking of the old mysteries or miracle-plays we may also
here refer to the moralities, a class of religious plays in which
allegorical personifications of the virtues, and vices were introduced
as dramatis personæ. These personages at first only took part in the
play along with the Scriptural or legendary characters, but afterwards
entirely superseded them. They continued in fashion till the time of
Queen Elizabeth. Several allusions are given by Shakespeare to

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

these moral plays. Thus, in "Twelfth Night" (iv. 1), the Clown sings—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  "I am gone, sir,  
   And anon, sir,  
 I'll be with you again  
   In a trice,  
   Like to the old Vice,  
 Your need to sustain;

 Who, with dagger of lath,  
 In his rage and his wrath,  
   Cries, ah, ha! to the devil," etc.

</div>

   Again, in "1 Henry IV." (ii. 4), Prince Henry speaks of that
"reverend vice, that grey iniquity;" and ill "2 Henry IV." (iii. 2),
Falstaff says, "Now is this vice's dagger become a squire."

   Again, further allusions occur in "King Richard III.," (iii. 1).
Gloucester says,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,  
 I moralize two meanings in one word."</span>

</div>

   And once more, Hamlet (iii. 4), speaks of "a Vice of kings," "a king
of shreds and patches."

   According to Nares, "vice" had the name sometimes of one vice,
sometimes of another, but most commonly of *Iniquity*, or Vice itself.
He was grotesquely dressed in a cap with ass's ears, a long coat, and a
dagger of lath. One of his chief employments was to make sport with the
devil, leaping on his back, and belabouring him with his dagger of lath,
till he made him roar. The devil, however, always carried him off in the
end. He was, in short, the buffoon of the morality, and was succeeded in
his office by the clown, whom we see in Shakespeare and others. <span
id="fr_668"></span>[1](#fn_666.md)

   Again, there may be a further allusion to the "moralities in "King
Lear," (ii. 2), where Kent says to Oswald, "Take vanity, the puppet's
part against the royalty of her father."

   Then, too, there were the "pageants,"—shows which were usually
performed in the highways of our towns, and assimilated in some degree
to the miracle plays, but were of a more

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

mixed character, being partly drawn from profane history. According to
Strutt they were more frequent in London, being required at stated
periods, such as the setting of the Midsummer Watch, and the Lord
Mayor's show. <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_667.md) Among the allusions
to these shows given by Shakespeare, we may quote one in "Richard III.,"
(iv. 4), where Queen Margaret speaks of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The flattering index of a direful pageant"</span>

</div>

—the pageants displayed on public occasions being generally preceded by
a brief account of the order in which the characters were to walk. These
indexes were distributed among the spectators, that they might
understand the meaning of such allegorical representations as were
usually exhibited. In the "Merchant of Venice," (i. 1), Salarino calls
argosies "the pageants of the sea," in allusion, says Douce, <span
id="fr_670"></span>[2](#fn_668.md) "to those enormous machines, in the
shapes of castles, dragons, ships, giants, etc., that were drawn about
the streets in the ancient shows or pageants, and which often
constituted the most important part of them." Again, in "As You Like
It," (iii. 4), Corin says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If you will see a pageant truly play’d,  
 Between the pale complexion of true love  
 And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,  
 Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,  
 If you will mark it."</span>

</div>

   And in "Antony and Cleopatra," (iv. 14), Antony speaks of "black
vesper's pageants."

   The nine worthies, originally comprising Joshua, David, Judas
Maccabeus, Hector, Alexander, Julius Cæsar, Arthur, Charlemagne, and
Godfrey of Bulloigne, appear from a very, early period to have been
introduced occasionally in the shows and pageants of our ancestors.
Thus, in "Love's Labour's Lost," (v. 2), the "pageant of the nine
worthies" is introduced. As Shakespeare, however, introduces Hercules

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

and Pompey among his presence of worthies, we may infer that the
characters were sometimes varied to suit the circumstances of the
period, or the taste of the auditory. A MS. preserved in the library of
Trinity College, Dublin, mentions the "Six Worthies" having been played
before the Lord Deputy Sussex in 1557. <span
id="fr_671"></span>[1](#fn_669.md)

   Another feature of the Whitsun merrymakings were the Cotswold games,
which were generally on the Thursday in Whitsun week, in the vicinity of
Chipping Campden. They were instituted by an attorney of
Burton-on-the-Heath, in Warwickshire, named Robert Dover, and like the
Olympic games of the ancients, consisted of most kinds of manly sports,
such as wrestling, leaping, pitching the bar, handling the pike,
dancing, and hunting. Ben Jonson, Drayton, and other poets of that age
wrote verses on this festivity, which in 1636 were collected into one
volume, and published under the name of "Annalia Dubrensia." <span
id="fr_672"></span>[2](#fn_670) In the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (i. 1.md),
Slender asks Page, "How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he
was outrun on Cotsall?" And in "2 Henry IV." <span
id="fr_673"></span>[3](#fn_671) (iii. 1.md), Shallow, by distinguishing
Will Squele as "a Cotswold man," meant to imply that he was well versed
in manly exercises, and consequently of a daring spirit and athletic
constitution. A sheep was jocularly called a "Cotsold," or "Cotswold
lion," from the extensive pastures in that part of Gloucestershire.

   Whilst speaking of Whitsuntide festivities, we may refer to the
"roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly," to which Prince
Henry alludes in "1 Henry IV." (ii. 4). <span
id="fr_674"></span>[4](#fn_672.md)\* It appears that Manningtree, in Essex,
formerly enjoyed the privilege of fairs, by the tenure of exhibiting a
certain number of Stage Plays yearly. There were, also, great
festivities there, and much good eating, at Whitsun ales and other
times. Hence, it seems that roasting an ox whole was not uncommon on
such occasions. The pudding spoken of

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

by Prince Henry often accompanied the ox, as we find in a ballad written
in 1658 <span id="fr_675"></span>[1](#fn_673.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Just so the people stare  
 At an ox in the fair  
 Roasted whole with a pudding in ’s belly."</span>

</div>

   *Sheep-shearing Time* commences as soon as the warm weather is so far
settled that the sheep may, without danger, lay aside their winter
clothing; the following tokens being laid down by Dyer in his "Fleece"
(book i.), to mark out the proper time <span
id="fr_676"></span>[2](#fn_674.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "If verdant elder spreads  
Her silver flowers; if humble daisies yield  
To yellow crowfoot and luxuriant grass  
Gay shearing time approaches."</span>

</div>

Our ancestors, who took advantage of every natural holiday, to keep it
long and gladly, celebrated the time of sheep-shearing by a feast
exclusively rural. Drayton,' the countryman of Shakespeare, has
graphically described this festive scene, the Vale of Evesham being the
locality of the sheep-shearing which he has pictured so pleasantly—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                "The shepherd
king,  
Whose flock hath chanc’d that year the earliest lamb to bring,  
In his gay baldric sits at his low grassy board.  
With flawns, curds, clouted cream, and country dainties stored;  
And whilst the bag-pipe plays, each lusty jocund swain  
Quaffs syllabubs in cans, to all upon the plain,  
And to their country girls, whose nosegays they do wear;  
Some roundelays do sing; the rest the burthen bear." <span
id="fr_677"></span>[3](#fn_675.md)</span>

</div>

In the "Winter's Tale," one of the most delicious scenes (iv. 4), is
that of the sheep-shearing, in which we have the more poetical
"shepherd-queen." Mr Furnivall, <span id="fr_678"></span>[4](#fn_676.md) in
his introduction to this play justly remarks: "How happily it brings
Shakespeare before us, mixing with his Stratford neighbours at their
sheep-shearing and country sports,

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

enjoying the vagabond pedlar's gammon and talk, delighting in the sweet
Warwickshire maidens, and buying them 'fairings,' telling goblin stories
to the boys, 'There was a man dwelt in a churchyard,' opening his heart
afresh to all the innocent mirth, and the beauty of nature around him."
The expense attaching to these festivities appears to have afforded
matter of complaint. Thus the Clown asks, "What am I to buy for our
sheep-shearing feast?" and then proceeds to enumerate various things
which he will have to purchase. In Tusser's "Five Hundred Points of
Husbandry," this festival is described under "The Ploughman's
Feast-days."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Wife, make us a dinner, spare flesh neither
corne,  
 Make wafers and cakes, for our sheep must be shorne;  
 At sheepe-shearing, neighbours none other things crave,  
 But good cheere and welcome like neighbours to have."</span>

</div>

   *Midsummer Eve* appears to have been regarded as a period when the
imagination ran riot, and many a curious superstition was associated
with this season. Thus people gathered on this night the rose, St John's
wort, vervain, trefoil and rue, all of which were supposed to have
magical properties. They set the orpine in clay upon pieces of slate or
potsherd in their houses, calling it a "Midsummer man." As the stalk was
found next morning to incline to the right or left, the anxious maiden
knew whether her lover would prove true to her or not. Young men sought
also for pieces of coal, but in reality certain hard, black, dead roots,
often found under the living mug-wort, designing to place these under
their pillows, that they might dream of themselves. <span
id="fr_679"></span>[1](#fn_677.md) It was also supposed that any person
fasting on Mid-summer eve, and sitting in the church porch, would at
midnight see the spirits of those persons of that parish who would die
that year, come and knock at the church door, in the order and
succession in which they would die. Midsummer was formerly thought to be
a season productive of

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

madness. Thus Malvolio's strange conduct is described by Olivia in
"Twelfth Night" (iii. 4) as "a very midsummer madness." And hence, "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" is no inappropriate title for "the series of
wild incongruities of which the play consists." <span
id="fr_680"></span>[1](#fn_678.md) The Low Dutch have a proverb that when
men have passed a troublesome night's rest, and could not sleep, "they
have passed St John Baptist's night"—that is, they have not taken any
sleep, but watched all night. Heywood seems to allude to a similar
notion when he says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As mad as a March hare: where madness compares,  
 Are not midsummer hares as mad as March hares?"</span>

</div>

   A proverbial phrase, too, to signify that a person was mad was, "’Tis
midsummer moon with you"—hot weather being supposed to affect the brain.

   *Dog-days*.—A popular superstition—in all probability derived from
the Egyptians—referred to the rising and setting of Sirius, or the
Dog-star, as infusing madness into the canine race. Consequently the
name of "Dog-days" was given by the Romans to the period between the 3d
July and nth August, to which Shakespeare alludes in "Henry VIII." (v.
4), "the dog-days now reign." It is obvious that the notion is utterly
groundless, for not only does the star vary in its rising, but is later
and later every year. According to the Roman belief, "at the rising of
the dog-star, the seas boil, the wines ferment in the cellars, and
standing waters are set in motion; the dogs also go mad, and the
sturgeon is blasted." The term dog-days is still a common phrase, and it
is difficult to say whether it is from superstitious adherence to old
custom, or from a belief of the injurious effect of heat upon the canine
race that the magistrates often unwisely at this season of the year,
order them to be muzzled or tied up.

   *Lammas Day* (August 1).—According to some antiquarians, Lammas is a
corruption of loaf-mass, as our ancestors made an offering of bread from
new wheat on this day. Others derive it from lamb-masse, because the
tenants who held lands under the Cathedral Church of York, were bound by

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

their tenure to bring a live lamb into the church at high mass. <span
id="fr_681"></span>[1](#fn_679.md) It appears to have been a popular day in
times past; and is mentioned in the following dialogue in "Romeo and
Juliet" (i. 3), where the Nurse enquires—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                           "How long is it now  
To Lammas-tide?  
   *La. Capulet.* A fortnight, and odd days  
   *Nurse*. Even or odd, of all days in the year,  
Come Lammas-eve at night, shall she be fourteen."</span>

</div>

   In Neale's "Essays on Liturgiology" (2nd ed., p. 526), the Welsh
equivalent for Lammas Day is given as "dydd degwm wyn," lamb-tithing
day.

   *St Charity* (August 1).—This saint is found in the Martyrology on
the first of August—"Romæ passio Sanctarum Virginum Fidei, Spei, et
Charitatis, quæ sub Hadriano principe martyriæ coronam adeptæ
sunt." <span id="fr_682"></span>[2](#fn_680.md) She is alluded to by
Ophelia in her song in "Hamlet" (iv. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By Gis, <span id="fr_683"></span>[3](#fn_681.md) and
by Saint Charity,  
 Alack, and fie for shame," &c.</span>

</div>

   In the "Faire Maide of Bristowe," 1605, we find a similar allusion—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Now by Saint Charity, if I were iudge,  
 A halter were the least should hamper him."</span>

</div>

   *St Bartholomew's Day* (August 24).—The anniversary of this festival
was formerly signalized by the holding of the great Smithfield Fair—the
only real fair held within the city of London. One of the chief
attractions of Bartholomew Fair were roasted pigs. They were sold
"piping hot, in booths and on stalls, and ostentatiously displayed to
excite the appetite of passengers." Hence a "Bartholomew pig," became a
popular subject of allusion. Falstaff, in "2 Henry IV." (ii. 4), in
coaxing ridicule of his enormous figure, is playfully called by his
favourite Doll—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou whoreson, little, tidy Bartholomew
boar-pig."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

   Dr Johnson, however, thought that paste pigs were meant in this
passage, but this is improbable, as the true Bartholomew pigs were real
roasted pigs, as may be seen from Ben Jonson's play of "Bartholomew
Fair," (i. 6), where Ursula, the pigwoman, is an important
personage. <span id="fr_684"></span>[1](#fn_682.md) Gay, too, speaks of the
pig-dressers:—"Like Bartholomew fair pig-dressers, who look like the
dams, as well as the cooks of what they roasted." A further allusion to
this season is found in "Henry V.," (v. 2), where Burgundy tells how
"maids, well-summered, and warm kept, are like flies at
Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have eyes; and then they will
endure handling, which before would not abide looking on."

   *Harvest Home*.—The ceremonies which graced the in-gathering of the
harvest in byegone times have gradually disappeared, and at the present
day only remnants of the old usages which once prevailed are still
preserved. Shakespeare, who has chronicled so many of our old customs,
and seems to have had a special delight in illustrating his writings
with these characteristics of our social life, has given several
interesting allusions to the observances which in his day graced the
harvest field. Thus, in Warwickshire, the labourers at their harvest
home appointed a judge to try misdemeanours committed during harvest,
and those who were sentenced to punishment were placed on a bench and
beaten with a pair of boots. Hence the ceremony was called "giving them
the boots." It has been suggested that this custom is alluded to in the
"Two Gentlemen of Verona," (i. 1), where he makes Proteus, parrying
Valentine's raillery, say, "Nay, give me not the boots."

   In Northamptonshire, when anyone misconducted himself in the field
during harvest, he was subjected to a mock trial at the harvest-home
feast, and condemned to be booted, a description of which we find in the
introduction to Clare's "Village Minstrel":—"A long form is placed in
the kitchen, upon which the boys who have worked well sit, as a terror
and disgrace to the rest, in a bent posture, with their hands laid on
each other's backs, forming a bridge for the

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "hogs," (as the
truant boys are called), to pass over; while a strong chap stands on
each side with a boot-legging, soundly strapping them as they scuffle
over the bridge, which is done as fast as their ingenuity can carry
them." Some, however, think the allusion in the "Two Gentlemen of
Verona" is to the diabolical torture of the boot. Not a great while
before this play was written, it had been inflicted, says Douce, <span
id="fr_685"></span>[1](#fn_683.md) in the presence of King James on one Dr
Fian, a supposed wizard, who was charged with raising the storms that
the king encountered in his return from Denmark. The unfortunate man was
afterwards burned. This horrible torture, we are told, <span
id="fr_686"></span>[2](#fn_684.md) consisted in the leg and knee of the
criminal being enclosed within a tight iron boot or case, wedges of iron
being then driven in with a mallet between the knee and the iron boot.
Sir Walter Scott, in "Old Mortality," has given a description of
Macbriar undergoing this punishment. At a later period "the boot"
signified, according to Nares, <span id="fr_687"></span>[3](#fn_685.md) an
instrument for tightening the leg or hand, and was used as a cure for
the gout, and called a "bootikins." The phrase "to give the boots" seems
to have been a proverbial expression, signifying "don't make a laughing
stock of me; don't play upon me."

   Again, in the "Merchant of Venice" (v. 1), where Lorenzo says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn:  
 With sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear,  
 And draw her home with music"</span>

</div>

we have, doubtless, an allusion to the "Hock Cart" of the old
harvest-home. This was the cart which carried the last corn away from
the harvest field; <span id="fr_688"></span>[4](#fn_686.md) and was
generally profusely decorated and accompanied by music, old and young

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

shouting at the top of their voices a doggerel after the following
fashion—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We have ploughed, we have sowed,  
 We have reaped, we have mowed,  
 We have brought home every load,  
     Hip, hip, hip! harvest home." <span
id="fr_689"></span>[1](#fn_687.md)</span>

</div>

In "Poor Robin's Almanack" for August 1676, we read—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hoacky is brought home with hallowing,  
 Boys with plumb-cake the cart following,"</span>

</div>

   *Holyrood-Day* (September 14).—This festival, <span
id="fr_690"></span>[2](#fn_688.md) called also Holy-Cross-day, was
instituted by the Romish Church on account of the recovery of a large
piece of the supposed cross by the Emperor Heraclius, after it had been
taken away, on the plundering of Jerusalem, by Chosroes, king of Persia.
Among the customs associated with this day was one of going-a-nutting,
alluded to in the old play of "Grim the Collier of Croydon" (ii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To-morrow is Holy-rood-day,  
 When all a-nutting take their way."</span>

</div>

Shakespeare mentions this festival in "1 Henry IV." (i. 1), where he
represents the Earl of Westmoreland relating how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"On Holyrood day, the gallant Hotspur there,  
 Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,  
 That ever-valiant and approved Scot,  
 At Holmedon met."</span>

</div>

   *St Lambert's-Day* (September 17).—This saint, whose original name
was Landebert, but contracted into Lambert, was a native of Maestricht,
in the seventh century, and was assassinated early in the eighth. <span
id="fr_691"></span>[3](#fn_689.md) His festival is alluded to in "Richard
II." (i. 1), where the king says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,  
 At Coventry, upon St Lambert's day."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

   *Michaelmas*.—In the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (i. 1), this festival
is alluded to by Simple, who, in answer to Slender, whether he had "The
Book of Riddles" about him, replies—"Why, did you not lend it to Alice
Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight afore Michaelmas." This
doubtless being an intended blunder.

   In "1 Henry IV." (ii. 4), Francis says—"Let me see—about Michaelmas I
shall be—"

   *St Etheldredra*, or *Audry*, commemorated in the Romish Calendar on
the 23d of June, but in the English Calendar on the 17th of October, was
daughter of Annas, king of the East Angles. She founded the convent and
Church of Ely on the spot where the cathedral was subsequently erected.
Formerly, at Ely, a fair was annually held, called in her memory St
Audry's Fair, at which much cheap lace was sold to the poorer classes,
which at first went by the name of St Audry's lace, but in time was
corrupted into "tawdry lace." Shakespeare makes an allusion to this lace
in the "Winter's Tale," (iv. 4), where Mopsa says,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come, you promised me a tawdry lace, and a pair of
sweet gloves"</span>

</div>

although in his time the expression rather meant a rustic
necklace. <span id="fr_692"></span>[1](#fn_690.md) An old English historian
makes St Audry die of a swelling in her throat, which she considered as
a particular judgment for having been in her youth addicted to wearing
fine necklaces. <span id="fr_693"></span>[2](#fn_691.md)

   *St Crispin's Day* (October 25th), has for centuries been a
red-letter day in the calendar of the shoemakers, being the festival of
their patron saint. According to tradition, the brothers Crispin and
Crispinian, natives of Rome, having become converted to Christianity,
travelled to Soissons, in France, in order to preach the Gospel. Being
desirous, however, of rendering themselves independent, they earned
their daily bread by making shoes, with which, it is said, they
furnished the poor at an extremely low price. When the governor of the
town discovered that they maintained the Christian faith, and also tried
to make proselytes of the inhabitants, he ordered them to be beheaded.
From this time

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

the shoemakers have chosen them for their tutelary saints. Shakespeare
has perpetuated the memory of this festival by the speech which he has
given to Henry V., before the battle of Agincourt (iv. 3),—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This day is call’d the feast of Crispian:  
 He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,  
 Will stand a-tip-toe when this day is named,  
 And rouse him at the name of Crispian.  
 He that shall live this day, and see old age,  
 Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,  
 And say, 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian!'"</span>

</div>

   St Dennis has been adopted as the patron saint of France (October
9th), in the same manner as the English have chosen St George. The
guardianship of the two countries is thus expressed in the chorus to the
old ballad,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"St George he was for England,  
      St Denis was France,  
 Singing, Honi soit qui mal y pense."</span>

</div>

   King Henry ("Henry V.," v. 2), says to Kate, "Shall not thou and I,
between St Dennis and St George, compound a boy, half French, half
English," etc. In "1 Henry VI.," (iii. 2), Charles says,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"St Dennis bless this happy stratagem,  
 And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen."</span>

</div>

   *Hallowmas* (November i) is one of the names for the feast of
All-hallows, that is All Saints. Shakespeare alludes to a custom
relative to this day, some traces of which are still to be found in
Staffordshire, Cheshire, and other counties. The poor people go from
parish to parish *a-soulin*g, as they term it, that is, begging, in a
certain lamentable tone, for soul-cakes, at the same time singing a song
which they call the souler's song. This practice is no doubt a remnant
of the Popish ceremony of praying for departed souls, especially those
of friends, on the ensuing day, November 2nd, the feast of All
Souls. <span id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_692.md) The following is a specimen
of the doggerel sung on these occasions—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Soul! soul! for a soul cake;  
 Pray, good mistress, for a soul cake.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

 <span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> One for Peter,
and two for Paul,  
 Three for them who made us all.  
 Soul! soul! for an apple or two;  
 If you've got no apples, pears will do.  
 Up with your kettle, and down with your pan,  
 Give me a good big one, and I'll be gone.  
     Soul! soul! for a soul cake, &c.

 An apple, a pear, a plum, or a cherry,  
 Is a very good thing to make us merry."

</div>

In the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (ii. 1), Speed thus speaks of this
practice—"To watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, <span
id="fr_695"></span>[1](#fn_693.md) like a beggar at Hallowmas."

   The season of Hallowmas having been frequently mild has been, from
time immemorial, proverbially called "All-hallown Summer," *i.e.*, late
summer. Thus, <span id="fr_696"></span>[2](#fn_694.md) in "1 Henry IV." (i.
2), Prince Henry, likening Falstaff, with his old age and young passions
to this November summer, addresses him:—"Farewell, thou latter spring;
farewell, thou All Hallown summer." In some parts of Germany there is a
proverb, "All Saints’ Day brings the second summer; "and in Sweden there
is often about this time a continuance of warm still weather, which is
called "the All Saints’ rest."

   There is another reference to this festival in "Richard II." (v. 1),
where the king says of his wife—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"She came adorned hither like sweet May,  
 Sent back like Hallowmas or short’st of day."</span>

</div>

   *All Souls’ Day* (November 2d.),—which is set apart by the Roman
Catholic Church for a solemn service for the repose of the dead, was
formerly observed in this country, and among the many customs celebrated
in its honour were ringing the passing bell, making soul-cakes, blessing
beans, &c. <span id="fr_697"></span>[3](#fn_695.md) In "Richard III." (v.
1), Buckingham, when led to execution, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This is All Souls’ Day, fellows, is it not?"</span>

</div>

to which the sheriff replies—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"It is, my lord"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

whereupon Buckingham says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Why, then, All Souls’ Day is my body's
doomsday."</span>

</div>

   *Lord Mayor's Day* (November 9th). A custom which was in days gone by
observed at the inauguration dinner was that of the Lord Mayor's fool
leaping, clothes and all, into a large bowl of custard. It is alluded to
in "All's Well that Ends Well," (ii. 5), by Lafeu,—"You have made shift
to run int ’t, boots and spurs and all, like him that leaped into the
custard." Ben Jonson, in his "Devil's an Ass" (i. 1), thus refers to
it:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He may, perchance, in tail of a sheriff's dinner,  
 Skip with a rime o’ the table, from new nothing,  
 And take his almain leap into a custard,  
 Shall make my lady mayoress and her sisters,  
 Laugh all their hoods over their shoulders."</span>

</div>

   *St Martin's Day* (November 11th).—The mild weather about this time
has given rise to numerous proverbs; one of the well-known ones being,
"St Martin's little summer," an allusion to which we find in "1 Henry
VI." (i. 2), where Joan of Arc says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Expect St Martin's summer, halcyon days"</span>

</div>

which Johnson paraphrases thus—"Expect prosperity after misfortune, like
fair weather at Martlemas, after winter has begun." As an illustration,
too, of this passage, we may quote from the "Times," October 6, 1864—"It
was one of those rare but lovely exceptions to a cold season, called in
the Mediterranean St Martin's summer."

   A corruption of Martinmas is Martlemas. Falstaff is jocularly so
called by Poins, in "2 Henry IV." (ii. 2), as being in the decline, as
the year is at this season—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And how doth the martlemas, your master."</span>

</div>

   This was the customary time for hanging up provisions to dry, which
had been salted for winter provision.

   *St Nicholas* (December 6th).—This saint was deemed the patron of
children in general, but more particularly of all schoolboys, amongst
whom his festival used to be a very

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

great holiday. Various reasons have been assigned for his having been
chosen as the patron of children,—either because the legend makes him to
have been a bishop while yet a boy, or from his having restored three
young scholars to life who had been cruelly murdered, <span
id="fr_698"></span>[1](#fn_696.md) or again, on account of his early
abstinence when a boy. In the "Two Gentlemen of Verona," (iii. 1), he is
alluded to in this capacity,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Seed*. Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper,  
 *Launce*. There: and Saint Nicholas be thy speed."</span>

</div>

   Nicholas’ clerks was, and still is, a cant term for highwaymen and
robbers; but though the expression is very common, its origin is a
matter of uncertainty. In "1 Henry IV.," (ii. 1), it is thus alluded
to,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Gadshill*. Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint
Nicholas’ clerks, I'll give thee this neck.  
 *Chamb*. No, I'll none of it: I pray thee, keep that for the hangman:
for I know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of
falsehood may."</span>

</div>

   *Christmas*.—Among the observances associated with this season to
which Shakespeare alludes, we may mention the Christmas Carol, a
reference to which is probably made in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," (ii.
1), by Titania,—"No night is now with hymn or carol blest." Hamlet (ii.
2) quotes two lines from a popular ballad, entitled the "Song of
Jephtha's Daughter," and adds,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The first row of the pious chanson will show you
more." <span id="fr_699"></span>[2](#fn_697.md)</span>

</div>

   In days gone by, the custom of carol-singing was most popular, and
Warton, in his "History of English Poetry," notices a licence granted in
1562 to John Tysdale for printing "Certayne goodly carowles to be songe
to the glory of God;" and again "Crestenmas Carowles auctorisshed by my
lord of London." <span id="fr_700"></span>[3](#fn_698.md)

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

   In the "Taming of the Shrew," (ind., sc. 2), Sly asks whether "a
comonty <span id="fr_701"></span>[1](#fn_699.md) is not a Christmas
gambol." Formerly the sports and merry-makings at this season were on a
most extensive scale, being presided over by the "Lord of
Misrule." <span id="fr_702"></span>[2](#fn_700.md) Again, in "Love's
Labour's Lost," (v. 2), Biron speaks of "A Christmas Comedy."

   As we have noticed, too, in our chapter on plants, a gilt nutmeg was
formerly a common gift at Christmas, and on other festive occasions, to
which an allusion is probably made in the same scene. Formerly, at this
season, the head of the house assembled his family around a bowl of
spiced ale, from which he drank their healths, then passed it to the
rest, that they might drink too. The word that passed amongst them was
the ancient Saxon phrase *wass hael*, *i.e.*, to your health. Hence this
came to be recognised as the wassail or wassel-bowl; and was the
accompaniment to festivity of every kind throughout the year. Thus
Hamlet (i. 4) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The king doth wake to-night, and takes his
rouse, <span id="fr_703"></span>[3](#fn_701.md)  
 Keeps wassail."</span>

</div>

And in "Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 2), Biron speaks of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Wakes and wassails, meetings, markets,
fairs."</span>

</div>

In "Macbeth" (i. 7), it is used by Lady Macbeth in the sense of
intemperance, who, speaking of Duncan's two chamberlains, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Will I with wine and wassel so convince,  
 That memory, the warder of the brain,  
 Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason  
 A limbeck only."</span>

</div>

   In "Antony and Cleopatra" (i. 4), Cæsar advises Antony to live more
temperately, and to leave his "lascivious wassails." <span
id="fr_704"></span>[4](#fn_702.md)

   In the same way a "wassail candle" denoted a large

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

candle lighted up at a festival, a reference to which occurs in "2 Henry
IV." (i. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Ch. Jus.* You are as a candle, the better part
burnt out.  
 *Falstaff*. A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow."</span>

</div>

   A custom which formerly prevailed at Christmas, and has not yet died
out, was for mummers to go from house to house attired in grotesque
attire, performing all kind of odd antics. <span
id="fr_705"></span>[1](#fn_703.md) Their performances, however, were not
confined to this season. Thus, in "Coriolanus" (ii. 1) Menenius speaks
of making "faces like mummers."

   *Cakes and Ale*.—It was formerly customary on holidays and saints’
days to make cakes in honour of the day. In "Twelfth Night" (ii. 3), Sir
Toby says—"Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no
more cakes and ale?" To which the Clown replies—"Yes, by St Anne; and
ginger shall be hot i’ the mouth too."

   *Wakes*.—In days gone by, the church wake was an important
institution, and was made the occasion for a thorough holiday. Each
church, when consecrated, was dedicated to a saint, and on the
anniversary of that day was kept the wake. In many places there was a
second wake on the birthday of the saint. At such seasons, the floor of
the church was strewed with rushes and flowers, and in the churchyard
tents were erected to supply cakes and ale for the use of the
merrymakers on the following day, which was kept as a holiday. They are
still kept up in many parishes, but in a very different manner. <span
id="fr_706"></span>[2](#fn_704) In "King Lear" (iii. 6.md), Edgar
says—"Come, march to wakes and fairs, and market towns." We may also
compare "Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 2), and "Winter's Tale" (iv. 2). In
"Hamlet" (i. 4), it is used in the sense of revel.
