# The Second Part of Henry the Fourth

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Containing his Death: and the Coronation of King Henry the Fift

    Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.

    INDVCTION.

    Enter Rumour.


    Open your Eares: For which of you will stop
    The vent of Hearing, when loud Rumor speakes?
    I, from the Orient, to the drooping West
    (Making the winde my Post-horse) still vnfold
    The Acts commenced on this Ball of Earth.
    Vpon my Tongue, continuall Slanders ride,
    The which, in euery Language, I pronounce,
    Stuffing the Eares of them with false Reports:
    I speake of Peace, while couert Enmitie
    (Vnder the smile of Safety) wounds the World:
    And who but Rumour, who but onely I
    Make fearfull Musters, and prepar'd Defence,
    Whil'st the bigge yeare, swolne with some other griefes,
    Is thought with childe, by the sterne Tyrant, Warre,
    And no such matter? Rumour, is a Pipe
    Blowne by Surmises, Ielousies, Coniectures;
    And of so easie, and so plaine a stop,
    That the blunt Monster, with vncounted heads,
    The still discordant, wauering Multitude,
    Can play vpon it. But what neede I thus
    My well-knowne Body to Anathomize
    Among my houshold? Why is Rumour heere?
    I run before King Harries victory,
    Who in a bloodie field by Shrewsburie
    Hath beaten downe yong Hotspurre, and his Troopes,
    Quenching the flame of bold Rebellion,
    Euen with the Rebels blood. But what meane I
    To speake so true at first? My Office is
    To noyse abroad, that Harry Monmouth fell
    Vnder the Wrath of Noble Hotspurres Sword:
    And that the King, before the Dowglas Rage
    Stoop'd his Annointed head, as low as death.
    This haue I rumour'd through the peasant-Townes,
    Betweene the Royall Field of Shrewsburie,
    And this Worme-eaten-Hole of ragged Stone,
    Where Hotspurres Father, old Northumberland,
    Lyes crafty sicke. The Postes come tyring on,
    And not a man of them brings other newes
    Then they haue learn'd of Me. From Rumours Tongues,
    They bring smooth-Comforts-false, worse then True-wrongs.
    Enter.


    Scena Secunda.

    Enter Lord Bardolfe, and the Porter.

      L.Bar. Who keepes the Gate heere hoa?
    Where is the Earle?
      Por. What shall I say you are?
      Bar. Tell thou the Earle
    That the Lord Bardolfe doth attend him heere

       Por. His Lordship is walk'd forth into the Orchard,
    Please it your Honor, knocke but at the Gate,
    And he himselfe will answer.
    Enter Northumberland.

      L.Bar. Heere comes the Earle

       Nor. What newes Lord Bardolfe? Eu'ry minute now
    Should be the Father of some Stratagem;
    The Times are wilde: Contention (like a Horse
    Full of high Feeding) madly hath broke loose,
    And beares downe all before him

       L.Bar. Noble Earle,
    I bring you certaine newes from Shrewsbury

       Nor. Good, and heauen will

       L.Bar. As good as heart can wish:
    The King is almost wounded to the death:
    And in the Fortune of my Lord your Sonne,
    Prince Harrie slaine out-right: and both the Blunts
    Kill'd by the hand of Dowglas. Yong Prince Iohn,
    And Westmerland, and Stafford, fled the Field.
    And Harrie Monmouth's Brawne (the Hulke Sir Iohn)
    Is prisoner to your Sonne. O, such a Day,
    (So fought, so follow'd, and so fairely wonne)
    Came not, till now, to dignifie the Times
    Since Cæsars Fortunes

       Nor. How is this deriu'd?
    Saw you the Field? Came you from Shrewsbury?
      L.Bar. I spake with one (my L[ord].) that came fro[m] thence,
    A Gentleman well bred, and of good name,
    That freely render'd me these newes for true

       Nor. Heere comes my Seruant Trauers, whom I sent
    On Tuesday last, to listen after Newes.
    Enter Trauers.

      L.Bar. My Lord, I ouer-rod him on the way,
    And he is furnish'd with no certainties,
    More then he (haply) may retaile from me

       Nor. Now Trauers, what good tidings comes fro[m] you?
      Tra. My Lord, Sir Iohn Vmfreuill turn'd me backe
    With ioyfull tydings; and (being better hors'd)
    Out-rod me. After him, came spurring head
    A Gentleman (almost fore-spent with speed)
    That stopp'd by me, to breath his bloodied horse.
    He ask'd the way to Chester: And of him
    I did demand what Newes from Shrewsbury:
    He told me, that Rebellion had ill lucke,
    And that yong Harry Percies Spurre was cold.
    With that he gaue his able Horse the head,
    And bending forwards strooke his able heeles
    Against the panting sides of his poore Iade
    Vp to the Rowell head, and starting so,
    He seem'd in running, to deuoure the way,
    Staying no longer question

       North. Ha? Againe:
    Said he yong Harrie Percyes Spurre was cold?
    (Of Hot-Spurre, cold-Spurre?) that Rebellion,
    Had met ill lucke?
      L.Bar. My Lord: Ile tell you what,
    If my yong Lord your Sonne, haue not the day,
    Vpon mine Honor, for a silken point
    Ile giue my Barony. Neuer talke of it

       Nor. Why should the Gentleman that rode by Trauers
    Giue then such instances of Losse?
      L.Bar. Who, he?
    He was some hielding Fellow, that had stolne
    The Horse he rode-on: and vpon my life
    Speake at aduenture. Looke, here comes more Newes.
    Enter Morton.

      Nor. Yea, this mans brow, like to a Title-leafe,
    Fore-tels the Nature of a Tragicke Volume:
    So lookes the Strond, when the Imperious Flood
    Hath left a witnest Vsurpation.
    Say Morton, did'st thou come from Shrewsbury?
      Mor. I ran from Shrewsbury (my Noble Lord)
    Where hatefull death put on his vgliest Maske
    To fright our party

       North. How doth my Sonne, and Brother?
    Thou trembl'st; and the whitenesse in thy Cheeke
    Is apter then thy Tongue, to tell thy Errand.
    Euen such a man, so faint, so spiritlesse,
    So dull, so dead in looke, so woe-be-gone,
    Drew Priams Curtaine, in the dead of night,
    And would haue told him, Halfe his Troy was burn'd.
    But Priam found the Fire, ere he his Tongue:
    And I, my Percies death, ere thou report'st it.
    This, thou would'st say: Your Sonne did thus, and thus:
    Your Brother, thus. So fought the Noble Dowglas,
    Stopping my greedy eare, with their bold deeds.
    But in the end (to stop mine Eare indeed)
    Thou hast a Sigh, to blow away this Praise,
    Ending with Brother, Sonne, and all are dead

       Mor. Dowglas is liuing, and your Brother, yet:
    But for my Lord, your Sonne

       North. Why, he is dead.
    See what a ready tongue Suspition hath:
    He that but feares the thing, he would not know,
    Hath by Instinct, knowledge from others Eyes,
    That what he feard, is chanc'd. Yet speake (Morton)
    Tell thou thy Earle, his Diuination Lies,
    And I will take it, as a sweet Disgrace,
    And make thee rich, for doing me such wrong

       Mor. You are too great, to be (by me) gainsaid:
    Your Spirit is too true, your Feares too certaine

       North. Yet for all this, say not that Percies dead.
    I see a strange Confession in thine Eye:
    Thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it Feare, or Sinne,
    To speake a truth. If he be slaine, say so:
    The Tongue offends not, that reports his death:
    And he doth sinne that doth belye the dead:
    Not he, which sayes the dead is not aliue:
    Yet the first bringer of vnwelcome Newes
    Hath but a loosing Office: and his Tongue,
    Sounds euer after as a sullen Bell
    Remembred, knolling a departing Friend

       L.Bar. I cannot thinke (my Lord) your son is dead

       Mor. I am sorry, I should force you to beleeue
    That, which I would to heauen, I had not seene.
    But these mine eyes, saw him in bloody state,
    Rend'ring faint quittance (wearied, and out-breath'd)
    To Henrie Monmouth, whose swift wrath beate downe
    The neuer-daunted Percie to the earth,
    From whence (with life) he neuer more sprung vp.
    In few; his death (whose spirit lent a fire,
    Euen to the dullest Peazant in his Campe)
    Being bruited once, tooke fire and heate away
    From the best temper'd Courage in his Troopes.
    For from his Mettle, was his Party steel'd;
    Which once, in him abated, all the rest
    Turn'd on themselues, like dull and heauy Lead:
    And as the Thing, that's heauy in it selfe,
    Vpon enforcement, flyes with greatest speede,
    So did our Men, heauy in Hotspurres losse,
    Lend to this weight, such lightnesse with their Feare,
    That Arrowes fled not swifter toward their ayme,
    Then did our Soldiers (ayming at their safety)
    Fly from the field. Then was that Noble Worcester
    Too soone ta'ne prisoner: and that furious Scot,
    (The bloody Dowglas) whose well-labouring sword
    Had three times slaine th' appearance of the King,
    Gan vaile his stomacke, and did grace the shame
    Of those that turn'd their backes: and in his flight,
    Stumbling in Feare, was tooke. The summe of all,
    Is, that the King hath wonne: and hath sent out
    A speedy power, to encounter you my Lord,
    Vnder the Conduct of yong Lancaster
    And Westmerland. This is the Newes at full

       North. For this, I shall haue time enough to mourne.
    In Poyson, there is Physicke: and this newes
    (Hauing beene well) that would haue made me sicke,
    Being sicke, haue in some measure, made me well.
    And as the Wretch, whose Feauer-weakned ioynts,
    Like strengthlesse Hindges, buckle vnder life,
    Impatient of his Fit, breakes like a fire
    Out of his keepers armes: Euen so, my Limbes
    (Weak'ned with greefe) being now inrag'd with greefe,
    Are thrice themselues. Hence therefore thou nice crutch,
    A scalie Gauntlet now, with ioynts of Steele
    Must gloue this hand. And hence thou sickly Quoife,
    Thou art a guard too wanton for the head,
    Which Princes, flesh'd with Conquest, ayme to hit.
    Now binde my Browes with Iron and approach
    The ragged'st houre, that Time and Spight dare bring
    To frowne vpon th' enrag'd Northumberland.
    Let Heauen kisse Earth: now let not Natures hand
    Keepe the wilde Flood confin'd: Let Order dye,
    And let the world no longer be a stage
    To feede Contention in a ling'ring Act:
    But let one spirit of the First-borne Caine
    Reigne in all bosomes, that each heart being set
    On bloody Courses, the rude Scene may end,
    And darknesse be the burier of the dead

       L.Bar. Sweet Earle, diuorce not wisedom from your Honor

       Mor. The liues of all your louing Complices
    Leane-on your health, the which if you giue-o're
    To stormy Passion, must perforce decay.
    You cast th' euent of Warre (my Noble Lord)
    And summ'd the accompt of Chance, before you said
    Let vs make head: It was your presurmize,
    That in the dole of blowes, your Son might drop.
    You knew he walk'd o're perils, on an edge
    More likely to fall in, then to get o're:
    You were aduis'd his flesh was capeable
    Of Wounds, and Scarres; and that his forward Spirit
    Would lift him, where most trade of danger rang'd,
    Yet did you say go forth: and none of this
    (Though strongly apprehended) could restraine
    The stiffe-borne Action: What hath then befalne?
    Or what hath this bold enterprize bring forth,
    More then that Being, which was like to be?
      L.Bar. We all that are engaged to this losse,
    Knew that we ventur'd on such dangerous Seas,
    That if we wrought out life, was ten to one:
    And yet we ventur'd for the gaine propos'd,
    Choak'd the respect of likely perill fear'd,
    And since we are o're-set, venture againe.
    Come, we will all put forth; Body, and Goods,
      Mor. 'Tis more then time: And (my most Noble Lord)
    I heare for certaine, and do speake the truth:
    The gentle Arch-bishop of Yorke is vp
    With well appointed Powres: he is a man
    Who with a double Surety bindes his Followers.
    My Lord (your Sonne) had onely but the Corpes,
    But shadowes, and the shewes of men to fight.
    For that same word (Rebellion) did diuide
    The action of their bodies, from their soules,
    And they did fight with queasinesse, constrain'd
    As men drinke Potions; that their Weapons only
    Seem'd on our side: but for their Spirits and Soules,
    This word (Rebellion) it had froze them vp,
    As Fish are in a Pond. But now the Bishop
    Turnes Insurrection to Religion,
    Suppos'd sincere, and holy in his Thoughts:
    He's follow'd both with Body, and with Minde:
    And doth enlarge his Rising, with the blood
    Of faire King Richard, scrap'd from Pomfret stones,
    Deriues from heauen, his Quarrell, and his Cause:
    Tels them, he doth bestride a bleeding Land,
    Gasping for life, vnder great Bullingbrooke,
    And more, and lesse, do flocke to follow him

       North. I knew of this before. But to speake truth,
    This present greefe had wip'd it from my minde.
    Go in with me, and councell euery man
    The aptest way for safety, and reuenge:
    Get Posts, and Letters, and make Friends with speed,
    Neuer so few, nor neuer yet more need.

    Exeunt.


    Scena Tertia.

    Enter Falstaffe, and Page.

      Fal. Sirra, you giant, what saies the Doct[or]. to my water?
      Pag. He said sir, the water it selfe was a good healthy
    water: but for the party that ow'd it, he might haue more
    diseases then he knew for

       Fal. Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at mee: the
    braine of this foolish compounded Clay-man, is not able
    to inuent any thing that tends to laughter, more then I
    inuent, or is inuented on me. I am not onely witty in my
    selfe, but the cause that wit is in other men. I doe heere
    walke before thee, like a Sow, that hath o'rewhelm'd all
    her Litter, but one. If the Prince put thee into my Seruice
    for any other reason, then to set mee off, why then I
    haue no iudgement. Thou horson Mandrake, thou art
    fitter to be worne in my cap, then to wait at my heeles. I
    was neuer mann'd with an Agot till now: but I will sette
    you neyther in Gold, nor Siluer, but in vilde apparell, and
    send you backe againe to your Master, for a Iewell. The
    Iuuenall (the Prince your Master) whose Chin is not yet
    fledg'd, I will sooner haue a beard grow in the Palme of
    my hand, then he shall get one on his cheeke: yet he will
    not sticke to say, his Face is a Face-Royall. Heauen may
    finish it when he will, it is not a haire amisse yet: he may
    keepe it still at a Face-Royall, for a Barber shall neuer
    earne six pence out of it; and yet he will be crowing, as if
    he had writ man euer since his Father was a Batchellour.
    He may keepe his owne Grace, but he is almost out of
    mine, I can assure him. What said M[aster]. Dombledon, about
    the Satten for my short Cloake, and Slops?
      Pag. He said sir, you should procure him better Assurance,
    then Bardolfe: he wold not take his Bond & yours,
    he lik'd not the Security

       Fal. Let him bee damn'd like the Glutton, may his
    Tongue be hotter, a horson Achitophel; a
    Rascally-yea-forsooth-knaue,
    to beare a Gentleman in hand, and then
    stand vpon Security? The horson smooth-pates doe now
    weare nothing but high shoes, and bunches of Keyes at
    their girdles: and if a man is through with them in honest
    Taking-vp, then they must stand vpon Securitie: I
    had as liefe they would put Rats-bane in my mouth, as
    offer to stoppe it with Security. I look'd hee should haue
    sent me two and twenty yards of Satten (as I am true
    Knight) and he sends me Security. Well, he may sleep in
    Security, for he hath the horne of Abundance: and the
    lightnesse of his Wife shines through it, and yet cannot
    he see, though he haue his owne Lanthorne to light him.
    Where's Bardolfe?
      Pag. He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship
    a horse

       Fal. I bought him in Paules, and hee'l buy mee a horse
    in Smithfield. If I could get mee a wife in the Stewes, I
    were Mann'd, Hors'd, and Wiu'd.
    Enter Chiefe Iustice, and Seruant.

      Pag. Sir, heere comes the Nobleman that committed
    the Prince for striking him, about Bardolfe

       Fal. Wait close, I will not see him

       Ch.Iust. What's he that goes there?
      Ser. Falstaffe, and't please your Lordship

       Iust. He that was in question for the Robbery?
      Ser. He my Lord, but he hath since done good seruice
    at Shrewsbury: and (as I heare) is now going with some
    Charge, to the Lord Iohn of Lancaster

       Iust. What to Yorke? Call him backe againe

       Ser. Sir Iohn Falstaffe

       Fal. Boy, tell him, I am deafe

       Pag. You must speake lowder, my Master is deafe

       Iust. I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.
    Go plucke him by the Elbow, I must speake with him

       Ser. Sir Iohn

       Fal. What? a yong knaue and beg? Is there not wars? Is
    there not imployment? Doth not the K[ing]. lack subiects? Do
    not the Rebels want Soldiers? Though it be a shame to be
    on any side but one, it is worse shame to begge, then to
    be on the worst side, were it worse then the name of Rebellion
    can tell how to make it

       Ser. You mistake me Sir

       Fal. Why sir? Did I say you were an honest man? Setting
    my Knight-hood, and my Souldiership aside, I had
    lyed in my throat, if I had said so

       Ser. I pray you (Sir) then set your Knighthood and
    your Souldier-ship aside, and giue mee leaue to tell you,
    you lye in your throat, if you say I am any other then an
    honest man

       Fal. I giue thee leaue to tell me so? I lay a-side that
    which growes to me? If thou get'st any leaue of me, hang
    me: if thou tak'st leaue, thou wer't better be hang'd: you
    Hunt-counter, hence: Auant

       Ser. Sir, my Lord would speake with you

       Iust. Sir Iohn Falstaffe, a word with you

       Fal. My good Lord: giue your Lordship good time of
    the day. I am glad to see your Lordship abroad: I heard
    say your Lordship was sicke. I hope your Lordship goes
    abroad by aduise. Your Lordship (though not clean past
    your youth) hath yet some smack of age in you: some rellish
    of the saltnesse of Time, and I most humbly beseech
    your Lordship, to haue a reuerend care of your health

       Iust. Sir Iohn, I sent you before your Expedition, to
    Shrewsburie

       Fal. If it please your Lordship, I heare his Maiestie is
    return'd with some discomfort from Wales

       Iust. I talke not of his Maiesty: you would not come
    when I sent for you?
      Fal. And I heare moreouer, his Highnesse is falne into
    this same whorson Apoplexie

       Iust. Well, heauen mend him. I pray let me speak with you

       Fal. This Apoplexie is (as I take it) a kind of Lethargie,
    a sleeping of the blood, a horson Tingling

       Iust. What tell you me of it? be it as it is

       Fal. It hath it originall from much greefe; from study
    and perturbation of the braine. I haue read the cause of
    his effects in Galen. It is a kinde of deafenesse

       Iust. I thinke you are falne into the disease: For you
    heare not what I say to you

       Fal. Very well (my Lord) very well: rather an't please
    you) it is the disease of not Listning, the malady of not
    Marking, that I am troubled withall

       Iust. To punish you by the heeles, would amend the
    attention of your eares, & I care not if I be your Physitian
      Fal. I am as poore as Iob, my Lord; but not so Patient:
    your Lordship may minister the Potion of imprisonment
    to me, in respect of Pouertie: but how I should bee your
    Patient, to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make
    some dram of a scruple, or indeede, a scruple it selfe

       Iust. I sent for you (when there were matters against
    you for your life) to come speake with me

       Fal. As I was then aduised by my learned Councel, in
    the lawes of this Land-seruice, I did not come

       Iust. Wel, the truth is (sir Iohn) you liue in great infamy
      Fal. He that buckles him in my belt, ca[n]not liue in lesse

       Iust. Your Meanes is very slender, and your wast great

       Fal. I would it were otherwise: I would my Meanes
    were greater, and my waste slenderer

       Iust. You haue misled the youthfull Prince

       Fal. The yong Prince hath misled mee. I am the Fellow
    with the great belly, and he my Dogge

       Iust. Well, I am loth to gall a new-heal'd wound: your
    daies seruice at Shrewsbury, hath a little gilded ouer
    your Nights exploit on Gads-hill. You may thanke the
    vnquiet time, for your quiet o're-posting that Action

       Fal. My Lord?
      Iust. But since all is wel, keep it so: wake not a sleeping Wolfe

       Fal. To wake a Wolfe, is as bad as to smell a Fox

       Iu. What? you are as a candle, the better part burnt out
      Fal. A Wassell-Candle, my Lord; all Tallow: if I did
    say of wax, my growth would approue the truth

       Iust. There is not a white haire on your face, but shold
    haue his effect of grauity

       Fal. His effect of grauy, grauy, grauy

       Iust. You follow the yong Prince vp and downe, like
    his euill Angell

       Fal. Not so (my Lord) your ill Angell is light: but I
    hope, he that lookes vpon mee, will take mee without,
    weighing: and yet, in some respects I grant, I cannot go:
    I cannot tell. Vertue is of so little regard in these Costormongers,
    that true valor is turn'd Beare-heard. Pregnancie
    is made a Tapster, and hath his quicke wit wasted in
    giuing Recknings: all the other gifts appertinent to man
    (as the malice of this Age shapes them) are not woorth a
    Gooseberry. You that are old, consider not the capacities
    of vs that are yong: you measure the heat of our Liuers,
    with the bitternes of your gals: & we that are in the
    vaward of our youth, I must confesse, are wagges too

       Iust. Do you set downe your name in the scrowle of
    youth, that are written downe old, with all the Charracters
    of age? Haue you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a yellow
    cheeke? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an incresing
    belly? Is not your voice broken? your winde short? your
    wit single? and euery part about you blasted with Antiquity?
    and wil you cal your selfe yong? Fy, fy, fy, sir Iohn

       Fal. My Lord, I was borne with a white head, & somthing
    a round belly. For my voice, I haue lost it with hallowing
    and singing of Anthemes. To approue my youth
    farther, I will not: the truth is, I am onely olde in iudgement
    and vnderstanding: and he that will caper with mee
    for a thousand Markes, let him lend me the mony, & haue
    at him. For the boxe of th' eare that the Prince gaue you,
    he gaue it like a rude Prince, and you tooke it like a sensible
    Lord. I haue checkt him for it, and the yong Lion repents:
    Marry not in ashes and sacke-cloath, but in new
    Silke, and old Sacke

       Iust. Wel, heauen send the Prince a better companion

       Fal. Heauen send the Companion a better Prince: I
    cannot rid my hands of him

       Iust. Well, the King hath seuer'd you and Prince Harry,
    I heare you are going with Lord Iohn of Lancaster, against
    the Archbishop, and the Earle of Northumberland
      Fal. Yes, I thanke your pretty sweet wit for it: but
    looke you pray, (all you that kisse my Ladie Peace, at
    home) that our Armies ioyn not in a hot day: for if I take
    but two shirts out with me, and I meane not to sweat
    extraordinarily:
    if it bee a hot day, if I brandish any thing
    but my Bottle, would I might neuer spit white againe:
    There is not a daungerous Action can peepe out his head,
    but I am thrust vpon it. Well, I cannot last euer

       Iust. Well, be honest, be honest, and heauen blesse your
    Expedition

       Fal. Will your Lordship lend mee a thousand pound,
    to furnish me forth?
      Iust. Not a peny, not a peny: you are too impatient
    to beare crosses. Fare you well. Commend mee to my
    Cosin Westmerland

       Fal. If I do, fillop me with a three-man-Beetle. A man
    can no more separate Age and Couetousnesse, then he can
    part yong limbes and letchery: but the Gowt galles the
    one, and the pox pinches the other; and so both the Degrees
    preuent my curses. Boy?
      Page. Sir

       Fal. What money is in my purse?
      Page. Seuen groats, and two pence

       Fal. I can get no remedy against this Consumption of
    the purse. Borrowing onely lingers, and lingers it out,
    but the disease is incureable. Go beare this letter to my
    Lord of Lancaster, this to the Prince, this to the Earle of
    Westmerland, and this to old Mistris Vrsula, whome I
    haue weekly sworne to marry, since I perceiu'd the first
    white haire on my chin. About it: you know where to
    finde me. A pox of this Gowt, or a Gowt of this Poxe:
    for the one or th' other playes the rogue with my great
    toe: It is no matter, if I do halt, I haue the warres for my
    colour, and my Pension shall seeme the more reasonable.
    A good wit will make vse of any thing: I will turne diseases
    to commodity.

    Exeunt.

    Scena Quarta.

    Enter Archbishop, Hastings, Mowbray, and Lord Bardolfe.

      Ar. Thus haue you heard our causes, & kno our Means:
    And my most noble Friends, I pray you all
    Speake plainly your opinions of our hopes,
    And first (Lord Marshall) what say you to it?
      Mow. I well allow the occasion of our Armes,
    But gladly would be better satisfied,
    How (in our Meanes) we should aduance our selues
    To looke with forhead bold and big enough
    Vpon the Power and puisance of the King

       Hast. Our present Musters grow vpon the File
    To fiue and twenty thousand men of choice:
    And our Supplies, liue largely in the hope
    Of great Northumberland, whose bosome burnes
    With an incensed Fire of Iniuries

       L.Bar. The question then (Lord Hastings) standeth thus
    Whether our present fiue and twenty thousand
    May hold-vp-head, without Northumberland:
      Hast. With him, we may

       L.Bar. I marry, there's the point:
    But if without him we be thought to feeble,
    My iudgement is, we should not step too farre
    Till we had his Assistance by the hand.
    For in a Theame so bloody fac'd, as this,
    Coniecture, Expectation, and Surmise
    Of Aydes incertaine, should not be admitted

       Arch. 'Tis very true Lord Bardolfe, for indeed
    It was yong Hotspurres case, at Shrewsbury

       L.Bar. It was (my Lord) who lin'd himself with hope,
    Eating the ayre, on promise of Supply,
    Flatt'ring himselfe with Proiect of a power,
    Much smaller, then the smallest of his Thoughts,
    And so with great imagination
    (Proper to mad men) led his Powers to death,
    And (winking) leap'd into destruction

       Hast. But (by your leaue) it neuer yet did hurt,
    To lay downe likely-hoods, and formes of hope

       L.Bar. Yes, if this present quality of warre,
    Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot,
    Liues so in hope: As in an early Spring,
    We see th' appearing buds, which to proue fruite,
    Hope giues not so much warrant, as Dispaire
    That Frosts will bite them. When we meane to build,
    We first suruey the Plot, then draw the Modell,
    And when we see the figure of the house,
    Then must we rate the cost of the Erection,
    Which if we finde out-weighes Ability,
    What do we then, but draw a-new the Modell
    In fewer offices? Or at least, desist
    To builde at all? Much more, in this great worke,
    (Which is (almost) to plucke a Kingdome downe,
    And set another vp) should we suruey
    The plot of Situation, and the Modell;
    Consent vpon a sure Foundation:
    Question Surueyors, know our owne estate,
    How able such a Worke to vndergo,
    To weigh against his Opposite? Or else,
    We fortifie in Paper, and in Figures,
    Vsing the Names of men, instead of men:
    Like one, that drawes the Modell of a house
    Beyond his power to builde it; who (halfe through)
    Giues o're, and leaues his part-created Cost
    A naked subiect to the Weeping Clouds,
    And waste, for churlish Winters tyranny

       Hast. Grant that our hopes (yet likely of faire byrth)
    Should be still-borne: and that we now possest
    The vtmost man of expectation:
    I thinke we are a Body strong enough
    (Euen as we are) to equall with the King

       L.Bar. What is the King but fiue & twenty thousand?
      Hast. To vs no more: nay not so much Lord Bardolf.
    For0his diuisions (as the Times do braul)
    Are in three Heads: one Power against the French,
    And one against Glendower: Perforce a third
    Must take vp vs: So is the vnfirme King
    In three diuided: and his Coffers sound
    With hollow Pouerty, and Emptinesse

       Ar. That he should draw his seuerall strengths togither
    And come against vs in full puissance
    Need not be dreaded

       Hast. If he should do so,
    He leaues his backe vnarm'd, the French, and Welch
    Baying him at the heeles: neuer feare that

       L.Bar. Who is it like should lead his Forces hither?
      Hast. The Duke of Lancaster, and Westmerland:
    Against the Welsh himselfe, and Harrie Monmouth.
    But who is substituted 'gainst the French,
    I haue no certaine notice

       Arch. Let vs on:
    And publish the occasion of our Armes.
    The Common-wealth is sicke of their owne Choice,
    Their ouer-greedy loue hath surfetted:
    An habitation giddy, and vnsure
    Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
    O thou fond Many, with what loud applause
    Did'st thou beate heauen with blessing Bullingbrooke,
    Before he was, what thou would'st haue him be?
    And being now trimm'd in thine owne desires,
    Thou (beastly Feeder) art so full of him,
    That thou prouok'st thy selfe to cast him vp.
    So, so, (thou common Dogge) did'st thou disgorge
    Thy glutton-bosome of the Royall Richard,
    And now thou would'st eate thy dead vomit vp,
    And howl'st to finde it. What trust is in these Times?
    They, that when Richard liu'd, would haue him dye,
    Are now become enamour'd on his graue.
    Thou that threw'st dust vpon his goodly head
    When through proud London he came sighing on,
    After th' admired heeles of Bullingbrooke,
    Cri'st now, O Earth, yeeld vs that King againe,
    And take thou this (O thoughts of men accurs'd)
    ``Past, and to Come, seemes best; things Present, worst

       Mow. Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?
      Hast. We are Times subiects, and Time bids, be gon.

    Actus Secundus. Scoena Prima.

    Enter Hostesse, with two Officers, Fang, and Snare.

      Hostesse. Mr. Fang, haue you entred the Action?
      Fang. It is enter'd

       Hostesse. Wher's your Yeoman? Is it a lusty yeoman?
    Will he stand to it?
      Fang. Sirrah, where's Snare?
      Hostesse. I, I, good M[aster]. Snare

       Snare. Heere, heere

       Fang. Snare, we must Arrest Sir Iohn Falstaffe

       Host. I good M[aster]. Snare, I haue enter'd him, and all

       Sn. It may chance cost some of vs our liues: he wil stab
      Hostesse. Alas the day: take heed of him: he stabd me
    in mine owne house, and that most beastly: he cares not
    what mischeefe he doth, if his weapon be out. Hee will
    foyne like any diuell, he will spare neither man, woman,
    nor childe

       Fang. If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust

       Hostesse. No, nor I neither: Ile be at your elbow

       Fang. If I but fist him once: if he come but within my
    Vice

       Host. I am vndone with his going: I warrant he is an
    infinitiue thing vpon my score. Good M[aster]. Fang hold him
    sure: good M[aster]. Snare let him not scape, he comes
    continuantly
    to Py-Corner (sauing your manhoods) to buy a saddle,
    and hee is indited to dinner to the Lubbars head in
    Lombardstreet, to M[aster]. Smoothes the Silkman. I pra' ye, since
    my Exion is enter'd, and my Case so openly known to the
    world, let him be brought in to his answer: A 100. Marke
    is a long one, for a poore lone woman to beare: & I haue
    borne, and borne, and borne, and haue bin fub'd off, and
    fub'd-off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame to
    be thought on. There is no honesty in such dealing, vnles
    a woman should be made an Asse and a Beast, to beare euery
    Knaues wrong.

    Enter Falstaffe and Bardolfe.

    Yonder he comes, and that arrant Malmesey-Nose Bardolfe
    with him. Do your Offices, do your offices: M[aster]. Fang, &
    M[aster].
    Snare, do me, do me, do me your Offices

       Fal. How now? whose Mare's dead? what's the matter?
      Fang. Sir Iohn, I arrest you, at the suit of Mist. Quickly

       Falst. Away Varlets, draw Bardolfe: Cut me off the
    Villaines head: throw the Queane in the Channel

       Host. Throw me in the channell? Ile throw thee there.
    Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly rogue. Murder, murder,
    O thou Hony-suckle villaine, wilt thou kill Gods officers,
    and the Kings? O thou hony-seed Rogue, thou art
    a honyseed, a Man-queller, and a woman-queller

       Falst. Keep them off, Bardolfe

       Fang. A rescu, a rescu

       Host. Good people bring a rescu. Thou wilt not? thou
    wilt not? Do, do thou Rogue: Do thou Hempseed

       Page. Away you Scullion, you Rampallian, you Fustillirian:
    Ile tucke your Catastrophe.
    Enter Ch. Iustice.

      Iust. What's the matter? Keepe the Peace here, hoa

       Host. Good my Lord be good to mee. I beseech you
    stand to me

       Ch.Iust. How now sir Iohn? What are you brauling here?
    Doth this become your place, your time, and businesse?
    You should haue bene well on your way to Yorke.
    Stand from him Fellow; wherefore hang'st vpon him?
      Host. Oh my most worshipfull Lord, and't please your
    Grace, I am a poore widdow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested
    at my suit

       Ch.Iust. For what summe?
      Host. It is more then for some (my Lord) it is for all: all
    I haue, he hath eaten me out of house and home; hee hath
    put all my substance into that fat belly of his: but I will
    haue some of it out againe, or I will ride thee o' Nights,
    like the Mare

       Falst. I thinke I am as like to ride the Mare, if I haue
    any vantage of ground, to get vp

       Ch.Iust. How comes this, Sir Iohn? Fy, what a man of
    good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
    Are you not asham'd to inforce a poore Widdowe to so
    rough a course, to come by her owne?
      Falst. What is the grosse summe that I owe thee?
      Host. Marry (if thou wer't an honest man) thy selfe, &
    the mony too. Thou didst sweare to mee vpon a parcell
    gilt Goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber at the round
    table, by a sea-cole fire, on Wednesday in Whitson week,
    when the Prince broke thy head for lik'ning him to a singing
    man of Windsor; Thou didst sweare to me then (as I
    was washing thy wound) to marry me, and make mee my
    Lady thy wife. Canst y deny it? Did not goodwife Keech
    the Butchers wife come in then, and cal me gossip Quickly?
    comming in to borrow a messe of Vinegar: telling vs,
    she had a good dish of Prawnes: whereby y didst desire to
    eat some: whereby I told thee they were ill for a greene
    wound? And didst not thou (when she was gone downe
    staires) desire me to be no more familiar with such poore
    people, saying, that ere long they should call me Madam?
    And did'st y not kisse me, and bid mee fetch thee 30.s? I
    put thee now to thy Book-oath, deny it if thou canst?
      Fal. My Lord, this is a poore mad soule: and she sayes
    vp & downe the town, that her eldest son is like you. She
    hath bin in good case, & the truth is, pouerty hath distracted
    her: but for these foolish Officers, I beseech you, I
    may haue redresse against them

       Iust. Sir Iohn, sir Iohn, I am well acquainted with your
    maner of wrenching the true cause, the false way. It is not
    a confident brow, nor the throng of wordes, that come
    with such (more then impudent) sawcines from you, can
    thrust me from a leuell consideration, I know you ha' practis'd
    vpon the easie-yeelding spirit of this woman

       Host. Yes in troth my Lord

       Iust. Prethee peace: pay her the debt you owe her, and
    vnpay the villany you haue done her: the one you may do
    with sterling mony, & the other with currant repentance

       Fal. My Lord, I will not vndergo this sneape without
    reply. You call honorable Boldnes, impudent Sawcinesse:
    If a man wil curt'sie, and say nothing, he is vertuous: No,
    my Lord (your humble duty reme[m]bred) I will not be your
    sutor. I say to you, I desire deliu'rance from these Officers
    being vpon hasty employment in the Kings Affaires

       Iust. You speake, as hauing power to do wrong: But
    answer in the effect of your Reputation, and satisfie the
    poore woman

       Falst. Come hither Hostesse.
    Enter M[aster]. Gower]
      Ch.Iust. Now Master Gower; What newes?
      Gow. The King (my Lord) and Henrie Prince of Wales
    Are neere at hand: The rest the Paper telles

       Falst. As I am a Gentleman

       Host. Nay, you said so before

       Fal. As I am a Gentleman. Come, no more words of it
      Host. By this Heauenly ground I tread on, I must be
    faine to pawne both my Plate, and the Tapistry of my dyning
    Chambers

       Fal. Glasses, glasses, is the onely drinking: and for
    thy walles a pretty slight Drollery, or the Storie of the
    Prodigall, or the Germane hunting in Waterworke, is
    worth a thousand of these Bed-hangings, and these Flybitten
    Tapistries. Let it be tenne pound (if thou canst.)
    Come, if it were not for thy humors, there is not a better
    Wench in England. Go, wash thy face, and draw thy
    Action: Come, thou must not bee in this humour with
    me, come, I know thou was't set on to this

       Host. Prethee (Sir Iohn) let it be but twenty Nobles,
    I loath to pawne my Plate, in good earnest la

       Fal. Let it alone, Ile make other shift: you'l be a fool
    still

       Host. Well, you shall haue it although I pawne my
    Gowne. I hope you'l come to Supper: You'l pay me altogether?
      Fal. Will I liue? Go with her, with her: hooke-on,
    hooke-on

       Host. Will you haue Doll Teare-sheet meet you at supper?
      Fal. No more words. Let's haue her

       Ch.Iust. I haue heard bitter newes

       Fal. What's the newes (my good Lord?)
      Ch.Iu. Where lay the King last night?
      Mes. At Basingstoke my Lord

       Fal. I hope (my Lord) all's well. What is the newes
    my Lord?
      Ch.Iust. Come all his Forces backe?
      Mes. No: Fifteene hundred Foot, fiue hundred Horse
    Are march'd vp to my Lord of Lancaster,
    Against Northumberland, and the Archbishop

       Fal. Comes the King backe from Wales, my noble L[ord]?
      Ch.Iust. You shall haue Letters of me presently.
    Come, go along with me, good M[aster]. Gowre

       Fal. My Lord

       Ch.Iust. What's the matter?
      Fal. Master Gowre, shall I entreate you with mee to
    dinner?
      Gow. I must waite vpon my good Lord heere.
    I thanke you, good Sir Iohn

       Ch.Iust. Sir Iohn, you loyter heere too long being you
    are to take Souldiers vp, in Countries as you go

       Fal. Will you sup with me, Master Gowre?
      Ch.Iust. What foolish Master taught you these manners,
    Sir Iohn?
      Fal. Master Gower, if they become mee not, hee was a
    Foole that taught them mee. This is the right Fencing
    grace (my Lord) tap for tap, and so part faire

       Ch.Iust. Now the Lord lighten thee, thou art a great
    Foole.

    Exeunt.

    Scena Secunda.

    Enter Prince Henry, Pointz, Bardolfe, and Page.

      Prin. Trust me, I am exceeding weary

       Poin. Is it come to that? I had thought wearines durst
    not haue attach'd one of so high blood

       Prin. It doth me: though it discolours the complexion
    of my Greatnesse to acknowledge it. Doth it not shew
    vildely in me, to desire small Beere?
      Poin. Why, a Prince should not be so loosely studied,
    as to remember so weake a Composition

       Prince. Belike then, my Appetite was not Princely
    got: for (in troth) I do now remember the poore Creature,
    Small Beere. But indeede these humble considerations
    make me out of loue with my Greatnesse. What a
    disgrace is it to me, to remember thy name? Or to know
    thy face to morrow? Or to take note how many paire of
    Silk stockings y hast? (Viz. these, and those that were thy
    peach-colour'd ones:) Or to beare the Inuentorie of thy
    shirts, as one for superfluity, and one other, for vse. But
    that the Tennis-Court-keeper knowes better then I, for
    it is a low ebbe of Linnen with thee, when thou kept'st
    not Racket there, as thou hast not done a great while, because
    the rest of thy Low Countries, haue made a shift to
    eate vp thy Holland

       Poin. How ill it followes, after you haue labour'd so
    hard, you should talke so idlely? Tell me how many good
    yong Princes would do so, their Fathers lying so sicke, as
    yours is?
      Prin. Shall I tell thee one thing, Pointz?
      Poin. Yes: and let it be an excellent good thing

       Prin. It shall serue among wittes of no higher breeding
    then thine

       Poin. Go to: I stand the push of your one thing, that
    you'l tell

       Prin. Why, I tell thee, it is not meet, that I should be
    sad now my Father is sicke: albeit I could tell to thee (as
    to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend)
    I could be sad, and sad indeed too

       Poin. Very hardly, vpon such a subiect

       Prin. Thou think'st me as farre in the Diuels Booke, as
    thou, and Falstaffe, for obduracie and persistencie. Let the
    end try the man. But I tell thee, my hart bleeds inwardly,
    that my Father is so sicke: and keeping such vild company
    as thou art, hath in reason taken from me, all ostentation
    of sorrow

       Poin. The reason?
      Prin. What would'st thou think of me, if I shold weep?
      Poin. I would thinke thee a most Princely hypocrite

       Prin. It would be euery mans thought: and thou art
    a blessed Fellow, to thinke as euery man thinkes: neuer a
    mans thought in the world, keepes the Rode-way better
    then thine: euery man would thinke me an Hypocrite indeede.
    And what accites your most worshipful thought
    to thinke so?
      Poin. Why, because you haue beene so lewde, and so
    much ingraffed to Falstaffe

       Prin. And to thee

       Pointz. Nay, I am well spoken of, I can heare it with
    mine owne eares: the worst that they can say of me is, that
    I am a second Brother, and that I am a proper Fellowe of
    my hands: and those two things I confesse I canot helpe.
    Looke, looke, here comes Bardolfe

       Prince. And the Boy that I gaue Falstaffe, he had him
    from me Christian, and see if the fat villain haue not transform'd
    him Ape.
    Enter Bardolfe.

      Bar. Saue your Grace

       Prin. And yours, most Noble Bardolfe

       Poin. Come you pernitious Asse, you bashfull Foole,
    must you be blushing? Wherefore blush you now? what
    a Maidenly man at Armes are you become? Is it such a
    matter to get a Pottle-pots Maiden-head?
      Page. He call'd me euen now (my Lord) through a red
    Lattice, and I could discerne no part of his face from the
    window: at last I spy'd his eyes, and me thought he had
    made two holes in the Ale-wiues new Petticoat, & peeped
    through

       Prin. Hath not the boy profited?
      Bar. Away, you horson vpright Rabbet, away

       Page. Away, you rascally Altheas dreame, away

       Prin. Instruct vs Boy: what dreame, Boy?
      Page. Marry (my Lord) Althea dream'd, she was deliuer'd
    of a Firebrand, and therefore I call him hir dream

       Prince. A Crownes-worth of good Interpretation:
    There it is, Boy

       Poin. O that this good Blossome could bee kept from
    Cankers: Well, there is six pence to preserue thee

       Bard. If you do not make him be hang'd among you,
    the gallowes shall be wrong'd

       Prince. And how doth thy Master, Bardolph?
      Bar. Well, my good Lord: he heard of your Graces
    comming to Towne. There's a Letter for you

       Poin. Deliuer'd with good respect: And how doth the
    Martlemas, your Master?
      Bard. In bodily health Sir

       Poin. Marry, the immortall part needes a Physitian:
    but that moues not him: though that bee sicke, it dyes
    not

       Prince. I do allow this Wen to bee as familiar with
    me, as my dogge: and he holds his place, for looke you
    he writes

    Letter.

    Iohn Falstaffe Knight: (Euery man must
    know that, as oft as hee hath occasion to name himselfe:)
    Euen like those that are kinne to the King, for they neuer
    pricke their finger, but they say, there is som of the kings
    blood spilt. How comes that (sayes he) that takes vpon
    him not to conceiue? the answer is as ready as a borrowed
    cap: I am the Kings poore Cosin, Sir

       Prince. Nay, they will be kin to vs, but they wil fetch
    it from Iaphet. But to the Letter: - Sir Iohn Falstaffe,
    Knight, to the Sonne of the King, neerest his Father, Harrie
    Prince of Wales, greeting

       Poin. Why this is a Certificate

       Prin. Peace.
    I will imitate the honourable Romaines in breuitie

       Poin. Sure he meanes breuity in breath: short-winded.
    I commend me to thee, I commend thee, and I leaue thee. Bee
    not too familiar with Pointz, for hee misuses thy Fauours so
    much, that he sweares thou art to marrie his Sister Nell. Repent
    at idle times as thou mayst, and so farewell.
    Thine, by yea and no: which is as much as to say, as thou
    vsest him. Iacke Falstaffe with my Familiars:
    Iohn with my Brothers and Sister: & Sir
    Iohn, with all Europe.
    My Lord, I will steepe this Letter in Sack, and make him
    eate it

       Prin. That's to make him eate twenty of his Words.
    But do you vse me thus Ned? Must I marry your Sister?
      Poin. May the Wench haue no worse Fortune. But I
    neuer said so

       Prin. Well, thus we play the Fooles with the time, &
    the spirits of the wise, sit in the clouds, and mocke vs: Is
    your Master heere in London?
      Bard. Yes my Lord

       Prin. Where suppes he? Doth the old Bore, feede in
    the old Franke?
      Bard. At the old place my Lord, in East-cheape

       Prin. What Company?
      Page. Ephesians my Lord, of the old Church

       Prin. Sup any women with him?
      Page. None my Lord, but old Mistris Quickly, and M[istris].
    Doll Teare-sheet

       Prin. What Pagan may that be?
      Page. A proper Gentlewoman, Sir, and a Kinswoman
    of my Masters

       Prin. Euen such Kin, as the Parish Heyfors are to the
    Towne-Bull?
    Shall we steale vpon them (Ned) at Supper?
      Poin. I am your shadow, my Lord, Ile follow you

       Prin. Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your
    Master that I am yet in Towne.
    There's for your silence

       Bar. I haue no tongue, sir

       Page. And for mine Sir, I will gouerne it

       Prin. Fare ye well: go.
    This Doll Teare-sheet should be some Rode

       Poin. I warrant you, as common as the way betweene
    S[aint]. Albans, and London

       Prin. How might we see Falstaffe bestow himselfe to
    night, in his true colours, and not our selues be seene?
      Poin. Put on two Leather Ierkins, and Aprons, and
    waite vpon him at his Table, like Drawers

       Prin. From a God, to a Bull? A heauie declension: It
    was Ioues case. From a Prince, to a Prentice, a low transformation,
    that shall be mine: for in euery thing, the purpose
    must weigh with the folly. Follow me Ned.

    Exeunt.


    Scena Tertia.

    Enter Northumberland, his Ladie, and Harrie Percies Ladie.

      North. I prethee louing Wife, and gentle Daughter,
    Giue an euen way vnto my rough Affaires:
    Put not you on the visage of the Times,
    And be like them to Percie, troublesome

       Wife. I haue giuen ouer, I will speak no more,
    Do what you will: your Wisedome, be your guide

       North. Alas (sweet Wife) my Honor is at pawne,
    And but my going, nothing can redeeme it

       La. Oh yet, for heauens sake, go not to these Warrs;
    The Time was (Father) when you broke your word,
    When you were more endeer'd to it, then now,
    When your owne Percy, when my heart-deereHarry,
    Threw many a Northward looke, to see his Father
    Bring vp his Powres: but he did long in vaine.
    Who then perswaded you to stay at home?
    There were two Honors lost; Yours, and your Sonnes.
    For Yours, may heauenly glory brighten it:
    For His, it stucke vpon him, as the Sunne
    In the gray vault of Heauen: and by his Light
    Did all the Cheualrie of England moue
    To do braue Acts. He was (indeed) the Glasse
    Wherein the Noble-Youth did dresse themselues.
    He had no Legges, that practic'd not his Gate:
    And speaking thicke (which Nature made his blemish)
    Became the Accents of the Valiant.
    For those that could speake low, and tardily,
    Would turne their owne Perfection, to Abuse,
    To seeme like him. So that in Speech, in Gate,
    In Diet, in Affections of delight,
    In Militarie Rules, Humors of Blood,
    He was the Marke, and Glasse, Coppy, and Booke,
    That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous! him,
    O Miracle of Men! Him did you leaue
    (Second to none) vn-seconded by you,
    To looke vpon the hideous God of Warre,
    In dis-aduantage, to abide a field,
    Where nothing but the sound of Hotspurs Name
    Did seeme defensible: so you left him.
    Neuer, O neuer doe his Ghost the wrong,
    To hold your Honor more precise and nice
    With others, then with him. Let them alone:
    The Marshall and the Arch-bishop are strong.
    Had my sweet Harry had but halfe their Numbers,
    To day might I (hanging on Hotspurs Necke)
    Haue talk'd of Monmouth's Graue

       North. Beshrew your heart,
    (Faire Daughter) you doe draw my Spirits from me,
    With new lamenting ancient Ouer-sights.
    But I must goe, and meet with Danger there,
    Or it will seeke me in another place,
    And finde me worse prouided

       Wife. O flye to Scotland,
    Till that the Nobles, and the armed Commons,
    Haue of their Puissance made a little taste

       Lady. If they get ground, and vantage of the King,
    Then ioyne you with them, like a Ribbe of Steele,
    To make Strength stronger. But, for all our loues,
    First let them trye themselues. So did your Sonne,
    He was so suffer'd; so came I a Widow:
    And neuer shall haue length of Life enough,
    To raine vpon Remembrance with mine Eyes,
    That it may grow, and sprowt, as high as Heauen,
    For Recordation to my Noble Husband

       North. Come, come, go in with me: 'tis with my Minde
    As with the Tyde, swell'd vp vnto his height,
    That makes a still-stand, running neyther way.
    Faine would I goe to meet the Arch-bishop,
    But many thousand Reasons hold me backe.
    I will resolue for Scotland: there am I,
    Till Time and Vantage craue my company.

    Exeunt.


    Scaena Quarta.

    Enter two Drawers.

      1.Drawer. What hast thou brought there? Apple-Iohns?
    Thou know'st Sir Iohn cannot endure an Apple-Iohn

       2.Draw. Thou say'st true: the Prince once set a Dish
    of Apple-Iohns before him, and told him there were fiue
    more Sir Iohns: and, putting off his Hat, said, I will now
    take my leaue of these sixe drie, round, old-wither'd
    Knights. It anger'd him to the heart: but hee hath forgot
    that

       1.Draw. Why then couer, and set them downe: and
    see if thou canst finde out Sneakes Noyse; Mistris Teare-sheet
    would faine haue some Musique

       2.Draw. Sirrha, heere will be the Prince, and Master
    Points, anon: and they will put on two of our Ierkins,
    and Aprons, and Sir Iohn must not know of it: Bardolph
    hath brought word

       1.Draw. Then here will be old Vtis: it will be an excellent
    stratagem

       2.Draw. Ile see if I can finde out Sneake.
    Enter.

    Enter Hostesse, and Dol.

      Host. Sweet-heart, me thinkes now you are in an excellent
    good temperalitie: your Pulsidge beates as extraordinarily,
    as heart would desire; and your Colour
    (I warrant you) is as red as any Rose: But you haue
    drunke too much Canaries, and that's a maruellous searching
    Wine; and it perfumes the blood, ere wee can say
    what's this. How doe you now?
      Dol. Better then I was: Hem

       Host. Why that was well said: A good heart's worth
    Gold. Looke, here comes Sir Iohn.
    Enter Falstaffe.

      Falst. When Arthur first in Court - (emptie the Iordan)
    and was a worthy King: How now Mistris Dol?
      Host. Sick of a Calme: yea, good-sooth

       Falst. So is all her Sect: if they be once in a Calme,
    they are sick

       Dol. You muddie Rascall, is that all the comfort you
    giue me?
      Falst. You make fat Rascalls, Mistris Dol

       Dol. I make them? Gluttonie and Diseases make
    them, I make them not

       Falst. If the Cooke make the Gluttonie, you helpe to
    make the Diseases (Dol) we catch of you (Dol) we catch
    of you: Grant that, my poore Vertue, grant that

       Dol. I marry, our Chaynes, and our Iewels

       Falst. Your Brooches, Pearles, and Owches: For to
    serue brauely, is to come halting off: you know, to come
    off the Breach, with his Pike bent brauely, and to Surgerie
    brauely; to venture vpon the charg'd-Chambers
    brauely

       Host. Why this is the olde fashion: you two neuer
    meete, but you fall to some discord: you are both (in
    good troth) as Rheumatike as two drie Tostes, you cannot
    one beare with anothers Confirmities. What the
    good-yere? One must beare, and that must bee you:
    you are the weaker Vessell; as they say, the emptier
    Vessell

       Dol. Can a weake emptie Vessell beare such a huge
    full Hogs-head? There's a whole Marchants Venture
    of Burdeux-Stuffe in him: you haue not seene a Hulke
    better stufft in the Hold. Come, Ile be friends with thee
    Iacke: Thou art going to the Warres, and whether I
    shall euer see thee againe, or no, there is no body
    cares.
    Enter Drawer.

      Drawer. Sir, Ancient Pistoll is below, and would
    speake with you

       Dol. Hang him, swaggering Rascall, let him not
    come hither: it is the foule-mouth'dst Rogue in England

       Host. If hee swagger, let him not come here: I must
    liue amongst my Neighbors, Ile no Swaggerers: I am
    in good name, and fame, with the very best: shut the
    doore, there comes no Swaggerers heere: I haue not
    liu'd all this while, to haue swaggering now: shut the
    doore, I pray you

       Falst. Do'st thou heare, Hostesse?
      Host. 'Pray you pacifie your selfe (Sir Iohn) there comes
    no Swaggerers heere

       Falst. Do'st thou heare? it is mine Ancient

       Host. Tilly-fally (Sir Iohn) neuer tell me, your ancient
    Swaggerer comes not in my doores. I was before Master
    Tisick the Deputie, the other day: and as hee said to me,
    it was no longer agoe then Wednesday last: Neighbour
    Quickly (sayes hee;) Master Dombe, our Minister, was by
    then: Neighbour Quickly (sayes hee) receiue those that
    are Ciuill; for (sayth hee) you are in an ill Name: now
    hee said so, I can tell whereupon: for (sayes hee) you are
    an honest Woman, and well thought on; therefore take
    heede what Guests you receiue: Receiue (sayes hee) no
    swaggering Companions. There comes none heere. You
    would blesse you to heare what hee said. No, Ile no
    Swaggerers

       Falst. Hee's no Swaggerer (Hostesse:) a tame Cheater,
    hee: you may stroake him as gently, as a Puppie Greyhound:
    hee will not swagger with a Barbarie Henne, if
    her feathers turne backe in any shew of resistance. Call
    him vp (Drawer.)
      Host. Cheater, call you him? I will barre no honest
    man my house, nor no Cheater: but I doe not loue swaggering;
    I am the worse when one sayes, swagger: Feele
    Masters, how I shake: looke you, I warrant you

       Dol. So you doe, Hostesse

       Host. Doe I? yea, in very truth doe I, if it were an Aspen
    Leafe: I cannot abide Swaggerers.
    Enter Pistol, and Bardolph and his Boy.

      Pist. 'Saue you, Sir Iohn

       Falst. Welcome Ancient Pistol. Here (Pistol) I charge
    you with a Cup of Sacke: doe you discharge vpon mine
    Hostesse

       Pist. I will discharge vpon her (Sir Iohn) with two
    Bullets

       Falst. She is Pistoll-proofe (Sir) you shall hardly offend
    her

       Host. Come, Ile drinke no Proofes, nor no Bullets: I
    will drinke no more then will doe me good, for no mans
    pleasure, I

       Pist. Then to you (Mistris Dorothie) I will charge
    you

       Dol. Charge me? I scorne you (scuruie Companion)
    what? you poore, base, rascally, cheating, lacke-Linnen-Mate:
    away you mouldie Rogue, away; I am meat for
    your Master

       Pist. I know you, Mistris Dorothie

       Dol. Away you Cut-purse Rascall, you filthy Bung,
    away: By this Wine, Ile thrust my Knife in your mouldie
    Chappes, if you play the sawcie Cuttle with me. Away
    you Bottle-Ale Rascall, you Basket-hilt stale Iugler, you.
    Since when, I pray you, Sir? what, with two Points on
    your shoulder? much

       Pist. I will murther your Ruffe, for this

       Host. No, good Captaine Pistol: not heere, sweete
    Captaine

       Dol. Captaine? thou abhominable damn'd Cheater,
    art thou not asham'd to be call'd Captaine? If Captaines
    were of my minde, they would trunchion you out, for taking
    their Names vpon you, before you haue earn'd them.
    You a Captaine? you slaue, for what? for tearing a poore
    Whores Ruffe in a Bawdy-house? Hee a Captaine? hang
    him Rogue, hee liues vpon mouldie stew'd-Pruines, and
    dry'de Cakes. A Captaine? These Villaines will make
    the word Captaine odious: Therefore Captaines had
    neede looke to it

       Bard. 'Pray thee goe downe, good Ancient

       Falst. Hearke thee hither, Mistris Dol

       Pist. Not I: I tell thee what, Corporall Bardolph, I
    could teare her: Ile be reueng'd on her

       Page. 'Pray thee goe downe

       Pist. Ile see her damn'd first: to Pluto's damn'd Lake,
    to the Infernall Deepe, where Erebus and Tortures vilde
    also. Hold Hooke and Line, say I: Downe: downe
    Dogges, downe Fates: haue wee not Hiren here?
      Host. Good Captaine Peesel be quiet, it is very late:
    I beseeke you now, aggrauate your Choler

       Pist. These be good Humors indeede. Shall PackHorses,
    and hollow-pamper'd Iades of Asia, which cannot
    goe but thirtie miles a day, compare with Cæsar, and
    with Caniballs, and Troian Greekes? nay, rather damne
    them with King Cerberus, and let the Welkin roare: shall
    wee fall foule for Toyes?
      Host. By my troth Captaine, these are very bitter
    words

       Bard. Be gone, good Ancient: this will grow to a
    Brawle anon

       Pist. Die men, like Dogges; giue Crownes like Pinnes:
    Haue we not Hiren here?
      Host. On my word (Captaine) there's none such here.
    What the good-yere, doe you thinke I would denye her?
    I pray be quiet

       Pist. Then feed, and be fat (my faire Calipolis.) Come,
    giue me some Sack, Si fortune me tormente, sperato me contente.
    Feare wee broad-sides? No, let the Fiend giue fire:
    Giue me some Sack: and Sweet-heart lye thou there:
    Come wee to full Points here, and are et cetera's nothing?
      Fal. Pistol, I would be quiet

       Pist. Sweet Knight, I kisse thy Neaffe: what? wee haue
    seene the seuen Starres

       Dol. Thrust him downe stayres, I cannot endure such
    a Fustian Rascall

       Pist. Thrust him downe stayres? know we not Galloway
    Nagges?
      Fal. Quoit him downe (Bardolph) like a shoue-groat
    shilling: nay, if hee doe nothing but speake nothing, hee
    shall be nothing here

       Bard. Come, get you downe stayres

       Pist. What? shall wee haue Incision? shall wee embrew?
    then Death rocke me asleepe, abridge my dolefull
    dayes: why then let grieuous, gastly, gaping Wounds,
    vntwin'd the Sisters three: Come Atropos, I say

       Host. Here's good stuffe toward

       Fal. Giue me my Rapier, Boy

       Dol. I prethee Iack, I prethee doe not draw

       Fal. Get you downe stayres

       Host. Here's a goodly tumult: Ile forsweare keeping
    house, before Ile be in these tirrits, and frights. So: Murther
    I warrant now. Alas, alas, put vp your naked Weapons,
    put vp your naked Weapons

       Dol. I prethee Iack be quiet, the Rascall is gone: ah,
    you whorson little valiant Villaine, you

       Host. Are you not hurt i'th' Groyne? me thought hee
    made a shrewd Thrust at your Belly

       Fal. Haue you turn'd him out of doores?
      Bard. Yes Sir: the Rascall's drunke: you haue hurt
    him (Sir) in the shoulder

       Fal. A Rascall to braue me

       Dol. Ah, you sweet little Rogue, you: alas, poore Ape,
    how thou sweat'st? Come, let me wipe thy Face: Come
    on, you whorson Chops: Ah Rogue, I loue thee: Thou
    art as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth fiue of Agamemnon,
    and tenne times better then the nine Worthies: ah
    Villaine

       Fal. A rascally Slaue, I will tosse the Rogue in a Blanket

       Dol. Doe, if thou dar'st for thy heart: if thou doo'st,
    Ile canuas thee betweene a paire of Sheetes.
    Enter Musique.

      Page. The Musique is come, Sir

       Fal. Let them play: play Sirs. Sit on my Knee, Dol.
    A Rascall, bragging Slaue: the Rogue fled from me like
    Quick-siluer

       Dol. And thou followd'st him like a Church: thou
    whorson little tydie Bartholmew Bore-pigge, when wilt
    thou leaue fighting on dayes, and foyning on nights, and
    begin to patch vp thine old Body for Heauen?
    Enter the Prince and Poines disguis'd.

      Fal. Peace (good Dol) doe not speake like a Deathshead:
    doe not bid me remember mine end

       Dol. Sirrha, what humor is the Prince of?
      Fal. A good shallow young fellow: hee would haue
    made a good Pantler, hee would haue chipp'd Bread
    well

       Dol. They say Poines hath a good Wit

       Fal. Hee a good Wit? hang him Baboone, his Wit is
    as thicke as Tewksburie Mustard: there is no more conceit
    in him, then is in a Mallet

       Dol. Why doth the Prince loue him so then?
      Fal. Because their Legges are both of a bignesse: and
    hee playes at Quoits well, and eates Conger and Fennell,
    and drinkes off Candles ends for Flap-dragons, and rides
    the wilde-Mare with the Boyes, and iumpes vpon Ioyn'dstooles,
    and sweares with a good grace, and weares his
    Boot very smooth, like vnto the Signe of the Legge; and
    breedes no bate with telling of discreete stories: and such
    other Gamboll Faculties hee hath, that shew a weake
    Minde, and an able Body, for the which the Prince admits
    him; for the Prince himselfe is such another: the
    weight of an hayre will turne the Scales betweene their
    Haberdepois

       Prince. Would not this Naue of a Wheele haue his
    Eares cut off?
      Poin. Let vs beat him before his Whore

       Prince. Looke, if the wither'd Elder hath not his Poll
    claw'd like a Parrot

       Poin. Is it not strange, that Desire should so many
    yeeres out-liue performance?
      Fal. Kisse me Dol

       Prince. Saturne and Venus this yeere in Coniunction?
    What sayes the Almanack to that?
      Poin. And looke whether the fierie Trigon, his Man,
    be not lisping to his Masters old Tables, his Note-Booke,
    his Councell-keeper?
      Fal. Thou do'st giue me flatt'ring Busses

       Dol. Nay truely, I kisse thee with a most constant
    heart

       Fal. I am olde, I am olde

       Dol. I loue thee better, then I loue ere a scuruie young
    Boy of them all

       Fal. What Stuffe wilt thou haue a Kirtle of? I shall
    receiue Money on Thursday: thou shalt haue a Cappe
    to morrow. A merrie Song, come: it growes late,
    wee will to Bed. Thou wilt forget me, when I am
    gone

       Dol. Thou wilt set me a weeping, if thou say'st so:
    proue that euer I dresse my selfe handsome, till thy returne:
    well, hearken the end

       Fal. Some Sack, Francis

       Prin. Poin. Anon, anon, Sir

       Fal. Ha? a Bastard Sonne of the Kings? And art not
    thou Poines, his Brother?
      Prince. Why thou Globe of sinfull Continents, what
    a life do'st thou lead?
      Fal. A better then thou: I am a Gentleman, thou art
    a Drawer

       Prince. Very true, Sir: and I come to draw you out
    by the Eares

       Host. Oh, the Lord preserue thy good Grace: Welcome
    to London. Now Heauen blesse that sweete Face
    of thine: what, are you come from Wales?
      Fal. Thou whorson mad Compound of Maiestie: by
    this light Flesh, and corrupt Blood, thou art welcome

       Dol. How? you fat Foole, I scorne you

       Poin. My Lord, hee will driue you out of your reuenge,
    and turne all to a merryment, if you take not the
    heat

       Prince. You whorson Candle-myne you, how vildly
    did you speake of me euen now, before this honest, vertuous,
    ciuill Gentlewoman?
      Host. 'Blessing on your good heart, and so shee is by
    my troth

       Fal. Didst thou heare me?
      Prince. Yes: and you knew me, as you did when you
    ranne away by Gads-hill: you knew I was at your back,
    and spoke it on purpose, to trie my patience

       Fal. No, no, no: not so: I did not thinke, thou wast
    within hearing

       Prince. I shall driue you then to confesse the wilfull
    abuse, and then I know how to handle you

       Fal. No abuse (Hall) on mine Honor, no abuse

       Prince. Not to disprayse me? and call me Pantler, and
    Bread-chopper, and I know not what?
      Fal. No abuse (Hal.)
      Poin. No abuse?
      Fal. No abuse (Ned) in the World: honest Ned none.
    I disprays'd him before the Wicked, that the Wicked
    might not fall in loue with him: In which doing, I haue
    done the part of a carefull Friend, and a true Subiect, and
    thy Father is to giue me thankes for it. No abuse (Hal:)
    none (Ned) none; no Boyes, none

       Prince. See now whether pure Feare, and entire Cowardise,
    doth not make thee wrong this vertuous Gentlewoman,
    to close with vs? Is shee of the Wicked? Is thine
    Hostesse heere, of the Wicked? Or is the Boy of the
    Wicked? Or honest Bardolph (whose Zeale burnes in his
    Nose) of the Wicked?
      Poin. Answere thou dead Elme, answere

       Fal. The Fiend hath prickt downe Bardolph irrecouerable,
    and his Face is Lucifers Priuy-Kitchin, where hee
    doth nothing but rost Mault-Wormes: for the Boy,
    there is a good Angell about him, but the Deuill outbids
    him too

       Prince. For the Women?
      Fal. For one of them, shee is in Hell alreadie, and
    burnes poore Soules: for the other, I owe her Money;
    and whether shee bee damn'd for that, I know
    not

       Host. No, I warrant you

       Fal. No, I thinke thou art not: I thinke thou art quit
    for that. Marry, there is another Indictment vpon thee,
    for suffering flesh to bee eaten in thy house, contrary to
    the Law, for the which I thinke thou wilt howle

       Host. All Victuallers doe so: What is a Ioynt of
    Mutton, or two, in a whole Lent?
      Prince. You, Gentlewoman

       Dol. What sayes your Grace?
      Falst. His Grace sayes that, which his flesh rebells
    against

       Host. Who knocks so lowd at doore? Looke to the
    doore there, Francis?
    Enter Peto.

      Prince. Peto, how now? what newes?
      Peto. The King, your Father, is at Westminster,
    And there are twentie weake and wearied Postes,
    Come from the North: and as I came along,
    I met, and ouer-tooke a dozen Captaines,
    Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the Tauernes,
    And asking euery one for Sir Iohn Falstaffe

       Prince. By Heauen (Poines) I feele me much to blame,
    So idly to prophane the precious time,
    When Tempest of Commotion, like the South,
    Borne with black Vapour, doth begin to melt,
    And drop vpon our bare vnarmed heads.
    Giue me my Sword, and Cloake:
    Falstaffe, good night.
    Enter.

      Falst. Now comes in the sweetest Morsell of the
    night, and wee must hence, and leaue it vnpickt. More
    knocking at the doore? How now? what's the matter?
      Bard. You must away to Court, Sir, presently,
    A dozen Captaines stay at doore for you

       Falst. Pay the Musitians, Sirrha: farewell Hostesse,
    farewell Dol. You see (my good Wenches) how men of
    Merit are sought after: the vndeseruer may sleepe, when
    the man of Action is call'd on. Farewell good Wenches:
    if I be not sent away poste, I will see you againe, ere I
    goe

       Dol. I cannot speake: if my heart bee not readie
    to burst- Well (sweete Iacke) haue a care of thy
    selfe

       Falst. Farewell, farewell.
    Enter.

      Host. Well, fare thee well: I haue knowne thee
    these twentie nine yeeres, come Pescod-time: but an
    honester, and truer-hearted man- Well, fare thee
    well

       Bard. Mistris Teare-sheet

       Host. What's the matter?
      Bard. Bid Mistris Teare-sheet come to my Master

       Host. Oh runne Dol, runne: runne, good Dol.

    Exeunt.


    Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.

    Enter the King, with a Page.

      King. Goe, call the Earles of Surrey, and of Warwick:
    But ere they come, bid them ore-reade these Letters,
    And well consider of them: make good speed.
    Enter.

    How many thousand of my poorest Subiects
    Are at this howre asleepe? O Sleepe, O gentle Sleepe,
    Natures soft Nurse, how haue I frighted thee,
    That thou no more wilt weigh my eye-lids downe,
    And steepe my Sences in Forgetfulnesse?
    Why rather (Sleepe) lyest thou in smoakie Cribs,
    Vpon vneasie Pallads stretching thee,
    And huisht with bussing Night, flyes to thy slumber,
    Then in the perfum'd Chambers of the Great?
    Vnder the Canopies of costly State,
    And lull'd with sounds of sweetest Melodie?
    O thou dull God, why lyest thou with the vilde,
    In loathsome Beds, and leau'st the Kingly Couch,
    A Watch-case, or a common Larum-Bell?
    Wilt thou, vpon the high and giddie Mast,
    Seale vp the Ship-boyes Eyes, and rock his Braines,
    In Cradle of the rude imperious Surge,
    And in the visitation of the Windes,
    Who take the Ruffian Billowes by the top,
    Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
    With deaff'ning Clamors in the slipp'ry Clouds,
    That with the hurley, Death it selfe awakes?
    Canst thou (O partiall Sleepe) giue thy Repose
    To the wet Sea-Boy, in an houre so rude:
    And in the calmest, and most stillest Night,
    With all appliances, and meanes to boote,
    Deny it to a King? Then happy Lowe, lye downe,
    Vneasie lyes the Head, that weares a Crowne.
    Enter Warwicke and Surrey.

      War. Many good-morrowes to your Maiestie

       King. Is it good-morrow, Lords?
      War. 'Tis One a Clock, and past

       King. Why then good-morrow to you all (my Lords:)
    Haue you read o're the Letters that I sent you?
      War. We haue (my Liege.)
      King. Then you perceiue the Body of our Kingdome,
    How foule it is: what ranke Diseases grow,
    And with what danger, neere the Heart of it?
      War. It is but as a Body, yet distemper'd,
    Which to his former strength may be restor'd,
    With good aduice, and little Medicine:
    My Lord Northumberland will soone be cool'd

       King. Oh Heauen, that one might read the Book of Fate,
    And see the reuolution of the Times
    Make Mountaines leuell, and the Continent
    (Wearie of solide firmenesse) melt it selfe
    Into the Sea: and other Times, to see
    The beachie Girdle of the Ocean
    Too wide for Neptunes hippes; how Chances mocks
    And Changes fill the Cuppe of Alteration
    With diuers Liquors. 'Tis not tenne yeeres gone,
    Since Richard, and Northumberland, great friends,
    Did feast together; and in two yeeres after,
    Were they at Warres. It is but eight yeeres since,
    This Percie was the man, neerest my Soule,
    Who, like a Brother, toyl'd in my Affaires,
    And layd his Loue and Life vnder my foot:
    Yea, for my sake, euen to the eyes of Richard
    Gaue him defiance. But which of you was by
    (You Cousin Neuil, as I may remember)
    When Richard, with his Eye, brim-full of Teares,
    (Then check'd, and rated by Northumberland)
    Did speake these words (now prou'd a Prophecie:)
    Northumberland, thou Ladder, by the which
    My Cousin Bullingbrooke ascends my Throne:
    (Though then, Heauen knowes, I had no such intent,
    But that necessitie so bow'd the State,
    That I and Greatnesse were compell'd to kisse:)
    The Time shall come (thus did hee follow it)
    The Time will come, that foule Sinne gathering head,
    Shall breake into Corruption: so went on,
    Fore-telling this same Times Condition,
    And the diuision of our Amitie

       War. There is a Historie in all mens Liues,
    Figuring the nature of the Times deceas'd:
    The which obseru'd, a man may prophecie
    With a neere ayme, of the maine chance of things,
    As yet not come to Life, which in their Seedes
    And weake beginnings lye entreasured:
    Such things become the Hatch and Brood of Time;
    And by the necessarie forme of this,
    King Richard might create a perfect guesse,
    That great Northumberland, then false to him,
    Would of that Seed, grow to a greater falsenesse,
    Which should not finde a ground to roote vpon,
    Vnlesse on you

       King. Are these things then Necessities?
    Then let vs meete them like Necessities;
    And that same word, euen now cryes out on vs:
    They say, the Bishop and Northumberland
    Are fiftie thousand strong

       War. It cannot be (my Lord:)
    Rumor doth double, like the Voice, and Eccho,
    The numbers of the feared. Please it your Grace
    To goe to bed, vpon my Life (my Lord)
    The Pow'rs that you alreadie haue sent forth,
    Shall bring this Prize in very easily.
    To comfort you the more, I haue receiu'd
    A certaine instance, that Glendour is dead.
    Your Maiestie hath beene this fort-night ill,
    And these vnseason'd howres perforce must adde
    Vnto your Sicknesse

       King. I will take your counsaile:
    And were these inward Warres once out of hand,
    Wee would (deare Lords) vnto the Holy-Land.

    Exeunt.


    Scena Secunda.

    Enter Shallow and Silence: with Mouldie, Shadow, Wart, Feeble,
    Bull-calfe.

      Shal. Come-on, come-on, come-on: giue mee your
    Hand, Sir; giue mee your Hand, Sir: an early stirrer, by
    the Rood. And how doth my good Cousin Silence?
      Sil. Good-morrow, good Cousin Shallow

       Shal. And how doth my Cousin, your Bed-fellow?
    and your fairest Daughter, and mine, my God-Daughter
    Ellen?
      Sil. Alas, a blacke Ouzell (Cousin Shallow.)
      Shal. By yea and nay, Sir. I dare say my Cousin William
    is become a good Scholler? hee is at Oxford still, is hee
    not?
      Sil. Indeede Sir, to my cost

       Shal. Hee must then to the Innes of Court shortly: I
    was once of Clements Inne; where (I thinke) they will
    talke of mad Shallow yet

       Sil. You were call'd lustie Shallow then (Cousin.)
      Shal. I was call'd any thing: and I would haue done
    any thing indeede too, and roundly too. There was I, and
    little Iohn Doit of Staffordshire, and blacke George Bare,
    and Francis Pick-bone, and Will Squele a Cotsal-man, you
    had not foure such Swindge-bucklers in all the Innes of
    Court againe: And I may say to you, wee knew where
    the Bona-Roba's were, and had the best of them all at
    commandement. Then was Iacke Falstaffe (now Sir Iohn)
    a Boy, and Page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolke

       Sil. This Sir Iohn (Cousin) that comes hither anon about
    Souldiers?
      Shal. The same Sir Iohn, the very same: I saw him
    breake Scoggan's Head at the Court-Gate, when hee was
    a Crack, not thus high: and the very same day did I fight
    with one Sampson Stock-fish, a Fruiterer, behinde Greyes-Inne.
    Oh the mad dayes that I haue spent! and to see
    how many of mine olde Acquaintance are dead?
      Sil. Wee shall all follow (Cousin.)
      Shal. Certaine: 'tis certaine: very sure, very sure:
    Death is certaine to all, all shall dye. How a good Yoke
    of Bullocks at Stamford Fayre?
      Sil. Truly Cousin, I was not there

       Shal. Death is certaine. Is old Double of your Towne
    liuing yet?
      Sil. Dead, Sir

       Shal. Dead? See, see: hee drew a good Bow: and
    dead? hee shot a fine shoote. Iohn of Gaunt loued
    him well, and betted much Money on his head. Dead?
    hee would haue clapt in the Clowt at Twelue-score, and
    carryed you a fore-hand Shaft at foureteene, and foureteene
    and a halfe, that it would haue done a mans heart
    good to see. How a score of Ewes now?
      Sil. Thereafter as they be: a score of good Ewes
    may be worth tenne pounds

       Shal. And is olde Double dead?
    Enter Bardolph and his Boy.

      Sil. Heere come two of Sir Iohn Falstaffes Men (as I
    thinke.)
      Shal. Good-morrow, honest Gentlemen

       Bard. I beseech you, which is Iustice Shallow?
      Shal. I am Robert Shallow (Sir) a poore Esquire of this
    Countie, and one of the Kings Iustices of the Peace:
    What is your good pleasure with me?
      Bard. My Captaine (Sir) commends him to you:
    my Captaine, Sir Iohn Falstaffe: a tall Gentleman, and a
    most gallant Leader

       Shal. Hee greetes me well: (Sir) I knew him a
    good Back-Sword-man. How doth the good Knight?
    may I aske, how my Lady his Wife doth?
      Bard. Sir, pardon: a Souldier is better accommodated,
    then with a Wife

       Shal. It is well said, Sir; and it is well said, indeede,
    too: Better accommodated? it is good, yea indeede is
    it: good phrases are surely, and euery where very commendable.
    Accommodated, it comes of Accommodo:
    very good, a good Phrase

       Bard. Pardon, Sir, I haue heard the word. Phrase
    call you it? by this Day, I know not the Phrase: but
    I will maintaine the Word with my Sword, to bee a
    Souldier-like Word, and a Word of exceeding good
    Command. Accommodated: that is, when a man is
    (as they say) accommodated: or, when a man is, being
    whereby he thought to be accommodated, which is an
    excellent thing.
    Enter Falstaffe.

      Shal. It is very iust: Looke, heere comes good Sir
    Iohn. Giue me your hand, giue me your Worships good
    hand: Trust me, you looke well: and beare your yeares
    very well. Welcome, good Sir Iohn

       Fal. I am glad to see you well, good M[aster]. Robert Shallow:
    Master Sure-card as I thinke?
      Shal. No sir Iohn, it is my Cosin Silence: in Commission
    with mee

       Fal. Good M[aster]. Silence, it well befits you should be of
    the peace

       Sil. Your good Worship is welcome

       Fal. Fye, this is hot weather (Gentlemen) haue you
    prouided me heere halfe a dozen of sufficient men?
      Shal. Marry haue we sir: Will you sit?
      Fal. Let me see them, I beseech you

       Shal. Where's the Roll? Where's the Roll? Where's
    the Roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see: so, so, so, so:
    yea marry Sir. Raphe Mouldie: let them appeare as I call:
    let them do so, let them do so: Let mee see, Where is
    Mouldie?
      Moul. Heere, if it please you

       Shal. What thinke you (Sir Iohn) a good limb'd fellow:
    yong, strong, and of good friends

       Fal. Is thy name Mouldie?
      Moul. Yea, if it please you

       Fal. 'Tis the more time thou wert vs'd

       Shal. Ha, ha, ha, most excellent. Things that are mouldie,
    lacke vse: very singular good. Well saide Sir Iohn,
    very well said

       Fal. Pricke him

       Moul. I was prickt well enough before, if you could
    haue let me alone: my old Dame will be vndone now, for
    one to doe her Husbandry, and her Drudgery; you need
    not to haue prickt me, there are other men fitter to goe
    out, then I

       Fal. Go too: peace Mouldie, you shall goe. Mouldie,
    it is time you were spent

       Moul. Spent?
      Shallow. Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: Know you
    where you are? For the other sir Iohn: Let me see: Simon
    Shadow

       Fal. I marry, let me haue him to sit vnder: he's like to
    be a cold souldier

       Shal. Where's Shadow?
      Shad. Heere sir

       Fal. Shadow, whose sonne art thou?
      Shad. My Mothers sonne, Sir

       Falst. Thy Mothers sonne: like enough, and thy Fathers
    shadow: so the sonne of the Female, is the shadow
    of the Male: it is often so indeede, but not of the Fathers
    substance

       Shal. Do you like him, sir Iohn?
      Falst. Shadow will serue for Summer: pricke him: For
    wee haue a number of shadowes to fill vppe the Muster-Booke

       Shal. Thomas Wart?
      Falst. Where's he?
      Wart. Heere sir

       Falst. Is thy name Wart?
      Wart. Yea sir

       Fal. Thou art a very ragged Wart

       Shal. Shall I pricke him downe,
    Sir Iohn?
      Falst. It were superfluous: for his apparrel is built vpon
    his backe, and the whole frame stands vpon pins: prick
    him no more

       Shal. Ha, ha, ha, you can do it sir: you can doe it: I
    commend you well.
    Francis Feeble

       Feeble. Heere sir

       Shal. What Trade art thou Feeble?
      Feeble. A Womans Taylor sir

       Shal. Shall I pricke him, sir?
      Fal. You may:
    But if he had beene a mans Taylor, he would haue prick'd
    you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemies Battaile,
    as thou hast done in a Womans petticote?
      Feeble. I will doe my good will sir, you can haue no
    more

       Falst. Well said, good Womans Tailour: Well sayde
    Couragious Feeble: thou wilt bee as valiant as the wrathfull
    Doue, or most magnanimous Mouse. Pricke the womans
    Taylour well Master Shallow, deepe Maister Shallow

       Feeble. I would Wart might haue gone sir

       Fal. I would thou wert a mans Tailor, that y might'st
    mend him, and make him fit to goe. I cannot put him to
    a priuate souldier, that is the Leader of so many thousands.
    Let that suffice, most Forcible Feeble

       Feeble. It shall suffice

       Falst. I am bound to thee, reuerend Feeble. Who is
    the next?
      Shal. Peter Bulcalfe of the Greene

       Falst. Yea marry, let vs see Bulcalfe

       Bul. Heere sir

       Fal. Trust me, a likely Fellow. Come, pricke me Bulcalfe
    till he roare againe

       Bul. Oh, good my Lord Captaine

       Fal. What? do'st thou roare before th'art prickt

       Bul. Oh sir, I am a diseased man

       Fal. What disease hast thou?
      Bul. A whorson cold sir, a cough sir, which I caught
    with Ringing in the Kings affayres, vpon his Coronation
    day, sir

       Fal. Come, thou shalt go to the Warres in a Gowne:
    we will haue away thy Cold, and I will take such order,
    that thy friends shall ring for thee. Is heere all?
      Shal. There is two more called then your number:
    you must haue but foure heere sir, and so I pray you go in
    with me to dinner

       Fal. Come, I will goe drinke with you, but I cannot
    tarry dinner. I am glad to see you in good troth, Master
    Shallow

       Shal. O sir Iohn, doe you remember since wee lay all
    night in the Winde-mill, in S[aint]. Georges Field

       Falstaffe. No more of that good Master Shallow: No
    more of that

       Shal. Ha? it was a merry night. And is Iane Nightworke
    aliue?
      Fal. She liues, M[aster]. Shallow

       Shal. She neuer could away with me

       Fal. Neuer, neuer: she would alwayes say shee could
    not abide M[aster]. Shallow

       Shal. I could anger her to the heart: shee was then a
    Bona-Roba. Doth she hold her owne well

       Fal. Old, old, M[aster]. Shallow

       Shal. Nay, she must be old, she cannot choose but be
    old: certaine shee's old: and had Robin Night-worke, by
    old Night-worke, before I came to Clements Inne

       Sil. That's fiftie fiue yeeres agoe

       Shal. Hah, Cousin Silence, that thou hadst seene that,
    that this Knight and I haue seene: hah, Sir Iohn, said I
    well?
      Falst. Wee haue heard the Chymes at mid-night, Master
    Shallow

       Shal. That wee haue, that wee haue; in faith, Sir Iohn,
    wee haue: our watch-word was, Hem-Boyes. Come,
    let's to Dinner; come, let's to Dinner: Oh the dayes that
    wee haue seene. Come, come

       Bul. Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my
    friend, and heere is foure Harry tenne shillings in French
    Crownes for you: in very truth, sir, I had as lief be hang'd
    sir, as goe: and yet, for mine owne part, sir, I do not care;
    but rather, because I am vnwilling, and for mine owne
    part, haue a desire to stay with my friends: else, sir, I did
    not care, for mine owne part, so much

       Bard. Go-too: stand aside

       Mould. And good Master Corporall Captaine, for my
    old Dames sake, stand my friend: shee hath no body to
    doe any thing about her, when I am gone: and she is old,
    and cannot helpe her selfe: you shall haue fortie, sir

       Bard. Go-too: stand aside

       Feeble. I care not, a man can die but once: wee owe a
    death. I will neuer beare a base minde: if it be my destinie,
    so: if it be not, so: no man is too good to serue his
    Prince: and let it goe which way it will, he that dies this
    yeere, is quit for the next

       Bard. Well said, thou art a good fellow

       Feeble. Nay, I will beare no base minde

       Falst. Come sir, which men shall I haue?
      Shal. Foure of which you please

       Bard. Sir, a word with you: I haue three pound, to
    free Mouldie and Bull-calfe

       Falst. Go-too: well

       Shal. Come, sir Iohn, which foure will you haue?
      Falst. Doe you chuse for me

       Shal. Marry then, Mouldie, Bull-calfe, Feeble, and
    Shadow

       Falst. Mouldie, and Bull-calfe: for you Mouldie, stay
    at home, till you are past seruice: and for your part, Bull-calfe,
    grow till you come vnto it: I will none of you

       Shal. Sir Iohn, Sir Iohn, doe not your selfe wrong, they
    are your likelyest men, and I would haue you seru'd with
    the best

       Falst. Will you tell me (Master Shallow) how to chuse
    a man? Care I for the Limbe, the Thewes, the stature,
    bulke, and bigge assemblance of a man? giue mee the
    spirit (Master Shallow.) Where's Wart? you see what
    a ragged appearance it is: hee shall charge you, and
    discharge you, with the motion of a Pewterers Hammer:
    come off, and on, swifter then hee that gibbets on
    the Brewers Bucket. And this same halfe-fac'd fellow,
    Shadow, giue me this man: hee presents no marke to the
    Enemie, the foe-man may with as great ayme leuell at
    the edge of a Pen-knife: and for a Retrait, how swiftly
    will this Feeble, the Womans Taylor, runne off. O, giue
    me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a
    Calyuer into Warts hand, Bardolph

       Bard. Hold Wart, Trauerse: thus, thus, thus

       Falst. Come, manage me your Calyuer: so: very well,
    go-too, very good, exceeding good. O, giue me alwayes
    a little, leane, old, chopt, bald Shot. Well said Wart, thou
    art a good Scab: hold, there is a Tester for thee

       Shal. Hee is not his Crafts-master, hee doth not doe
    it right. I remember at Mile-end-Greene, when I lay
    at Clements Inne, I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthurs
    Show: there was a little quiuer fellow, and hee would
    manage you his Peece thus: and hee would about,
    and about, and come you in, and come you in: Rah,
    tah, tah, would hee say, Bownce would hee say, and
    away againe would hee goe, and againe would he come:
    I shall neuer see such a fellow

       Falst. These fellowes will doe well, Master Shallow.
    Farewell Master Silence, I will not vse many wordes with
    you: fare you well, Gentlemen both: I thanke you:
    I must a dozen mile to night. Bardolph, giue the Souldiers
    Coates

       Shal. Sir Iohn, Heauen blesse you, and prosper your
    Affaires, and send vs Peace. As you returne, visit
    my house. Let our old acquaintance be renewed: peraduenture
    I will with you to the Court

       Falst. I would you would, Master Shallow

       Shal. Go-too: I haue spoke at a word. Fare you
    well.
    Enter.

      Falst. Fare you well, gentle Gentlemen. On Bardolph,
    leade the men away. As I returne, I will fetch off
    these Iustices: I doe see the bottome of Iustice Shallow.
    How subiect wee old men are to this vice of Lying?
    This same staru'd Iustice hath done nothing but
    prate to me of the wildenesse of his Youth, and the
    Feates hee hath done about Turnball-street, and euery
    third word a Lye, duer pay'd to the hearer, then the
    Turkes Tribute. I doe remember him at Clements Inne,
    like a man made after Supper, of a Cheese-paring. When
    hee was naked, hee was, for all the world, like a forked
    Radish, with a Head fantastically caru'd vpon it with a
    Knife. Hee was so forlorne, that his Dimensions (to
    any thicke sight) were inuincible. Hee was the very
    Genius of Famine: hee came euer in the rere-ward of
    the Fashion: And now is this Vices Dagger become a
    Squire, and talkes as familiarly of Iohn of Gaunt, as if
    hee had beene sworne Brother to him: and Ile be sworne
    hee neuer saw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he
    burst his Head, for crowding among the Marshals men.
    I saw it, and told Iohn of Gaunt, hee beat his owne
    Name, for you might haue truss'd him and all his Apparrell
    into an Eele-skinne: the Case of a Treble Hoeboy
    was a Mansion for him: a Court: and now hath
    hee Land, and Beeues. Well, I will be acquainted with
    him, if I returne: and it shall goe hard, but I will make
    him a Philosophers two Stones to me. If the young
    Dace be a Bayt for the old Pike, I see no reason, in the
    Law of Nature, but I may snap at him. Let time shape,
    and there an end.

    Exeunt.


    Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.

    Enter the Arch-bishop, Mowbray, Hastings, Westmerland,
    Coleuile.

      Bish. What is this Forrest call'd?
      Hast. 'Tis Gaultree Forrest, and't shall please your
    Grace

       Bish. Here stand (my Lords) and send discouerers forth,
    To know the numbers of our Enemies

       Hast. Wee haue sent forth alreadie

       Bish. 'Tis well done.
    My Friends, and Brethren (in these great Affaires)
    I must acquaint you, that I haue receiu'd
    New-dated Letters from Northumberland:
    Their cold intent, tenure, and substance thus.
    Here doth hee wish his Person, with such Powers
    As might hold sortance with his Qualitie,
    The which hee could not leuie: whereupon
    Hee is retyr'd, to ripe his growing Fortunes,
    To Scotland; and concludes in heartie prayers,
    That your Attempts may ouer-liue the hazard,
    And fearefull meeting of their Opposite

       Mow. Thus do the hopes we haue in him, touch ground,
    And dash themselues to pieces.
    Enter a Messenger.

      Hast. Now? what newes?
      Mess. West of this Forrest, scarcely off a mile,
    In goodly forme, comes on the Enemie:
    And by the ground they hide, I iudge their number
    Vpon, or neere, the rate of thirtie thousand

       Mow. The iust proportion that we gaue them out.
    Let vs sway-on, and face them in the field.
    Enter Westmerland.

      Bish. What well-appointed Leader fronts vs here?
      Mow. I thinke it is my Lord of Westmerland

       West. Health, and faire greeting from our Generall,
    The Prince, Lord Iohn, and Duke of Lancaster

       Bish. Say on (my Lord of Westmerland) in peace:
    What doth concerne your comming?
      West. Then (my Lord)
    Vnto your Grace doe I in chiefe addresse
    The substance of my Speech. If that Rebellion
    Came like it selfe, in base and abiect Routs,
    Led on by bloodie Youth, guarded with Rage,
    And countenanc'd by Boyes, and Beggerie:
    I say, if damn'd Commotion so appeare,
    In his true, natiue, and most proper shape,
    You (Reuerend Father, and these Noble Lords)
    Had not beene here, to dresse the ougly forme
    Of base, and bloodie Insurrection,
    With your faire Honors. You, Lord Arch-bishop,
    Whose Sea is by a Ciuill Peace maintain'd,
    Whose Beard, the Siluer Hand of Peace hath touch'd,
    Whose Learning, and good Letters, Peace hath tutor'd,
    Whose white Inuestments figure Innocence,
    The Doue, and very blessed Spirit of Peace.
    Wherefore doe you so ill translate your selfe,
    Out of the Speech of Peace, that beares such grace,
    Into the harsh and boystrous Tongue of Warre?
    Turning your Bookes to Graues, your Inke to Blood,
    Your Pennes to Launces, and your Tongue diuine
    To a lowd Trumpet, and a Point of Warre

       Bish. Wherefore doe I this? so the Question stands.
    Briefely to this end: Wee are all diseas'd,
    And with our surfetting, and wanton howres,
    Haue brought our selues into a burning Feuer,
    And wee must bleede for it: of which Disease,
    Our late King Richard (being infected) dy'd.
    But (my most Noble Lord of Westmerland)
    I take not on me here as a Physician,
    Nor doe I, as an Enemie to Peace,
    Troope in the Throngs of Militarie men:
    But rather shew a while like fearefull Warre,
    To dyet ranke Mindes, sicke of happinesse,
    And purge th' obstructions, which begin to stop
    Our very Veines of Life: heare me more plainely.
    I haue in equall ballance iustly weigh'd,
    What wrongs our Arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
    And finde our Griefes heauier then our Offences.
    Wee see which way the streame of Time doth runne,
    And are enforc'd from our most quiet there,
    By the rough Torrent of Occasion,
    And haue the summarie of all our Griefes
    (When time shall serue) to shew in Articles;
    Which long ere this, wee offer'd to the King,
    And might, by no Suit, gayne our Audience:
    When wee are wrong'd, and would vnfold our Griefes,
    Wee are deny'd accesse vnto his Person,
    Euen by those men, that most haue done vs wrong.
    The dangers of the dayes but newly gone,
    Whose memorie is written on the Earth
    With yet appearing blood; and the examples
    Of euery Minutes instance (present now)
    Hath put vs in these ill-beseeming Armes:
    Not to breake Peace, or any Branch of it,
    But to establish here a Peace indeede,
    Concurring both in Name and Qualitie

       West. When euer yet was your Appeale deny'd?
    Wherein haue you beene galled by the King?
    What Peere hath beene suborn'd, to grate on you,
    That you should seale this lawlesse bloody Booke
    Of forg'd Rebellion, with a Seale diuine?
      Bish. My Brother generall, the Common-wealth,
    I make my Quarrell, in particular

       West. There is no neede of any such redresse:
    Or if there were, it not belongs to you

       Mow. Why not to him in part, and to vs all,
    That feele the bruizes of the dayes before,
    And suffer the Condition of these Times
    To lay a heauie and vnequall Hand vpon our Honors?
      West. O my good Lord Mowbray,
    Construe the Times to their Necessities,
    And you shall say (indeede) it is the Time,
    And not the King, that doth you iniuries.
    Yet for your part, it not appeares to me,
    Either from the King, or in the present Time,
    That you should haue an ynch of any ground
    To build a Griefe on: were you not restor'd
    To all the Duke of Norfolkes Seignories,
    Your Noble, and right well-remembred Fathers?
      Mow. What thing, in Honor, had my Father lost,
    That need to be reuiu'd, and breath'd in me?
    The King that lou'd him, as the State stood then,
    Was forc'd, perforce compell'd to banish him:
    And then, that Henry Bullingbrooke and hee
    Being mounted, and both rowsed in their Seates,
    Their neighing Coursers daring of the Spurre,
    Their armed Staues in charge, their Beauers downe,
    Their eyes of fire, sparkling through sights of Steele,
    And the lowd Trumpet blowing them together:
    Then, then, when there was nothing could haue stay'd
    My Father from the Breast of Bullingbrooke;
    O, when the King did throw his Warder downe,
    (His owne Life hung vpon the Staffe hee threw)
    Then threw hee downe himselfe, and all their Liues,
    That by Indictment, and by dint of Sword,
    Haue since mis-carryed vnder Bullingbrooke

       West. You speak (Lord Mowbray) now you know not what.
    The Earle of Hereford was reputed then
    In England the most valiant Gentleman.
    Who knowes, on whom Fortune would then haue smil'd?
    But if your Father had beene Victor there,
    Hee ne're had borne it out of Couentry.
    For all the Countrey, in a generall voyce,
    Cry'd hate vpon him: and all their prayers, and loue,
    Were set on Herford, whom they doted on,
    And bless'd, and grac'd, and did more then the King.
    But this is meere digression from my purpose.
    Here come I from our Princely Generall,
    To know your Griefes; to tell you, from his Grace,
    That hee will giue you Audience: and wherein
    It shall appeare, that your demands are iust,
    You shall enioy them, euery thing set off,
    That might so much as thinke you Enemies

       Mow. But hee hath forc'd vs to compell this Offer,
    And it proceedes from Pollicy, not Loue

       West. Mowbray, you ouer-weene to take it so:
    This Offer comes from Mercy, not from Feare.
    For loe, within a Ken our Army lyes,
    Vpon mine Honor, all too confident
    To giue admittance to a thought of feare.
    Our Battaile is more full of Names then yours,
    Our Men more perfect in the vse of Armes,
    Our Armor all as strong, our Cause the best;
    Then Reason will, our hearts should be as good.
    Say you not then, our Offer is compell'd

       Mow. Well, by my will, wee shall admit no Parley

       West. That argues but the shame of your offence:
    A rotten Case abides no handling

       Hast. Hath the Prince Iohn a full Commission,
    In very ample vertue of his Father,
    To heare, and absolutely to determine
    Of what Conditions wee shall stand vpon?
      West. That is intended in the Generals Name:
    I muse you make so slight a Question

       Bish. Then take (my Lord of Westmerland) this Schedule,
    For this containes our generall Grieuances:
    Each seuerall Article herein redress'd,
    All members of our Cause, both here, and hence,
    That are insinewed to this Action,
    Acquitted by a true substantiall forme,
    And present execution of our wills,
    To vs, and to our purposes confin'd,
    Wee come within our awfull Banks againe,
    And knit our Powers to the Arme of Peace

       West. This will I shew the Generall. Please you Lords,
    In sight of both our Battailes, wee may meete
    At either end in peace: which Heauen so frame,
    Or to the place of difference call the Swords,
    Which must decide it

       Bish. My Lord, wee will doe so

       Mow. There is a thing within my Bosome tells me,
    That no Conditions of our Peace can stand

       Hast. Feare you not, that if wee can make our Peace
    Vpon such large termes, and so absolute,
    As our Conditions shall consist vpon,
    Our Peace shall stand as firme as Rockie Mountaines

       Mow. I, but our valuation shall be such,
    That euery slight, and false-deriued Cause,
    Yea, euery idle, nice, and wanton Reason,
    Shall, to the King, taste of this Action:
    That were our Royall faiths, Martyrs in Loue,
    Wee shall be winnowed with so rough a winde,
    That euen our Corne shall seeme as light as Chaffe,
    And good from bad finde no partition

       Bish. No, no (my Lord) note this: the King is wearie
    Of daintie, and such picking Grieuances:
    For hee hath found, to end one doubt by Death,
    Reuiues two greater in the Heires of Life.
    And therefore will hee wipe his Tables cleane,
    And keepe no Tell-tale to his Memorie,
    That may repeat, and Historie his losse,
    To new remembrance. For full well hee knowes,
    Hee cannot so precisely weede this Land,
    As his mis-doubts present occasion:
    His foes are so en-rooted with his friends,
    That plucking to vnfixe an Enemie,
    Hee doth vnfasten so, and shake a friend.
    So that this Land, like an offensiue wife,
    That hath enrag'd him on, to offer strokes,
    As he is striking, holds his Infant vp,
    And hangs resolu'd Correction in the Arme,
    That was vprear'd to execution

       Hast. Besides, the King hath wasted all his Rods,
    On late Offenders, that he now doth lacke
    The very Instruments of Chasticement:
    So that his power, like to a Fanglesse Lion
    May offer, but not hold

       Bish. 'Tis very true:
    And therefore be assur'd (my good Lord Marshal)
    If we do now make our attonement well,
    Our Peace, will (like a broken Limbe vnited)
    Grow stronger, for the breaking

       Mow. Be it so:
    Heere is return'd my Lord of Westmerland.
    Enter Westmerland.

      West. The Prince is here at hand: pleaseth your Lordship
    To meet his Grace, iust distance 'tweene our Armies?
      Mow. Your Grace of Yorke, in heauen's name then
    forward

       Bish. Before, and greet his Grace (my Lord) we come.
    Enter Prince Iohn.

      Iohn. You are wel encountred here (my cosin Mowbray)
    Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop,
    And so to you Lord Hastings, and to all.
    My Lord of Yorke, it better shew'd with you,
    When that your Flocke (assembled by the Bell)
    Encircled you, to heare with reuerence
    Your exposition on the holy Text,
    Then now to see you heere an Iron man
    Chearing a rowt of Rebels with your Drumme,
    Turning the Word, to Sword; and Life to death:
    That man that sits within a Monarches heart,
    And ripens in the Sunne-shine of his fauor,
    Would hee abuse the Countenance of the King,
    Alack, what Mischiefes might hee set abroach,
    In shadow of such Greatnesse? With you, Lord Bishop,
    It is euen so. Who hath not heard it spoken,
    How deepe you were within the Bookes of Heauen?
    To vs, the Speaker in his Parliament;
    To vs, th' imagine Voyce of Heauen it selfe:
    The very Opener, and Intelligencer,
    Betweene the Grace, the Sanctities of Heauen;
    And our dull workings. O, who shall beleeue,
    But you mis-vse the reuerence of your Place,
    Employ the Countenance, and Grace of Heauen,
    As a false Fauorite doth his Princes Name,
    In deedes dis-honorable? You haue taken vp,
    Vnder the counterfeited Zeale of Heauen,
    The Subiects of Heauens Substitute, my Father,
    And both against the Peace of Heauen, and him,
    Haue here vp-swarmed them

       Bish. Good my Lord of Lancaster,
    I am not here against your Fathers Peace:
    But (as I told my Lord of Westmerland)
    The Time (mis-order'd) doth in common sence
    Crowd vs, and crush vs, to this monstrous Forme,
    To hold our safetie vp. I sent your Grace
    The parcels, and particulars of our Griefe,
    The which hath been with scorne shou'd from the Court:
    Whereon this Hydra-Sonne of Warre is borne,
    Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleepe,
    With graunt of our most iust and right desires;
    And true Obedience, of this Madnesse cur'd,
    Stoope tamely to the foot of Maiestie

       Mow. If not, wee readie are to trye our fortunes,
    To the last man

       Hast. And though wee here fall downe,
    Wee haue Supplyes, to second our Attempt:
    If they mis-carry, theirs shall second them.
    And so, successe of Mischiefe shall be borne,
    And Heire from Heire shall hold this Quarrell vp,
    Whiles England shall haue generation

       Iohn. You are too shallow (Hastings)
    Much too shallow,
    To sound the bottome of the after-Times

       West. Pleaseth your Grace, to answere them directly,
    How farre-forth you doe like their Articles

       Iohn. I like them all, and doe allow them well:
    And sweare here, by the honor of my blood,
    My Fathers purposes haue beene mistooke,
    And some, about him, haue too lauishly
    Wrested his meaning, and Authoritie.
    My Lord, these Griefes shall be with speed redrest:
    Vpon my Life, they shall. If this may please you,
    Discharge your Powers vnto their seuerall Counties,
    As wee will ours: and here, betweene the Armies,
    Let's drinke together friendly, and embrace,
    That all their eyes may beare those Tokens home,
    Of our restored Loue, and Amitie

       Bish. I take your Princely word, for these redresses

       Iohn. I giue it you, and will maintaine my word:
    And thereupon I drinke vnto your Grace

       Hast. Goe Captaine, and deliuer to the Armie
    This newes of Peace: let them haue pay, and part:
    I know, it will well please them.
    High thee Captaine.
    Enter.

      Bish. To you, my Noble Lord of Westmerland

       West. I pledge your Grace:
    And if you knew what paines I haue bestow'd,
    To breede this present Peace,
    You would drinke freely: but my loue to ye,
    Shall shew it selfe more openly hereafter

       Bish. I doe not doubt you

       West. I am glad of it.
    Health to my Lord, and gentle Cousin Mowbray

       Mow. You wish me health in very happy season,
    For I am, on the sodaine, something ill

       Bish. Against ill Chances, men are euer merry,
    But heauinesse fore-runnes the good euent

       West. Therefore be merry (Cooze) since sodaine sorrow
    Serues to say thus: some good thing comes to morrow

       Bish. Beleeue me, I am passing light in spirit

       Mow. So much the worse, if your owne Rule be true

       Iohn. The word of Peace is render'd: hearke how
    they showt

       Mow. This had been chearefull, after Victorie

       Bish. A Peace is of the nature of a Conquest:
    For then both parties nobly are subdu'd,
    And neither partie looser

       Iohn. Goe (my Lord)
    And let our Army be discharged too:
    And good my Lord (so please you) let our Traines
    March by vs, that wee may peruse the men
    Enter.

    Wee should haue coap'd withall

       Bish. Goe, good Lord Hastings:
    And ere they be dismiss'd, let them march by.
    Enter.

      Iohn. I trust (Lords) wee shall lye to night together.
    Enter Westmerland.

    Now Cousin, wherefore stands our Army still?
      West. The Leaders hauing charge from you to stand,
    Will not goe off, vntill they heare you speake

       Iohn. They know their duties.
    Enter Hastings.

      Hast. Our Army is dispers'd:
    Like youthfull Steeres, vnyoak'd, they tooke their course
    East, West, North, South: or like a Schoole, broke vp,
    Each hurryes towards his home, and sporting place

       West. Good tidings (my Lord Hastings) for the which,
    I doe arrest thee (Traytor) of high Treason:
    And you Lord Arch-bishop, and you Lord Mowbray,
    Of Capitall Treason, I attach you both

       Mow. Is this proceeding iust, and honorable?
      West. Is your Assembly so?
      Bish. Will you thus breake your faith?
      Iohn. I pawn'd thee none:
    I promis'd you redresse of these same Grieuances
    Whereof you did complaine; which, by mine Honor,
    I will performe, with a most Christian care.
    But for you (Rebels) looke to taste the due
    Meet for Rebellion, and such Acts as yours.
    Most shallowly did you these Armes commence,
    Fondly brought here, and foolishly sent hence.
    Strike vp our Drummes, pursue the scatter'd stray,
    Heauen, and not wee, haue safely fought to day.
    Some guard these Traitors to the Block of Death,
    Treasons true Bed, and yeelder vp of breath.

    Exeunt.

    Enter Falstaffe and Colleuile.

      Falst. What's your Name, Sir? of what Condition are
    you? and of what place, I pray?
      Col. I am a Knight, Sir:
    And my Name is Colleuile of the Dale

       Falst. Well then, Colleuile is your Name, a Knight is
    your Degree, and your Place, the Dale. Colleuile shall
    still be your Name, a Traytor your Degree, and the Dungeon
    your Place, a place deepe enough: so shall you be
    still Colleuile of the Dale

       Col. Are not you Sir Iohn Falstaffe?
      Falst. As good a man as he sir, who ere I am: doe yee
    yeelde sir, or shall I sweate for you? if I doe sweate, they
    are the drops of thy Louers, and they weep for thy death,
    therefore rowze vp Feare and Trembling, and do obseruance
    to my mercy

       Col. I thinke you are Sir Iohn Falstaffe, & in that thought
    yeeld me

       Fal. I haue a whole Schoole of tongues in this belly of
    mine, and not a Tongue of them all, speakes anie other
    word but my name: and I had but a belly of any indifferencie,
    I were simply the most actiue fellow in Europe:
    my wombe, my wombe, my wombe vndoes mee. Heere
    comes our Generall.
    Enter Prince Iohn, and Westmerland.

      Iohn. The heat is past, follow no farther now:
    Call in the Powers, good Cousin Westmerland.
    Now Falstaffe, where haue you beene all this while?
    When euery thing is ended, then you come.
    These tardie Tricks of yours will (on my life)
    One time, or other, breake some Gallowes back

       Falst. I would bee sorry (my Lord) but it should bee
    thus: I neuer knew yet, but rebuke and checke was the
    reward of Valour. Doe you thinke me a Swallow, an Arrow,
    or a Bullet? Haue I, in my poore and olde Motion,
    the expedition of Thought? I haue speeded hither with
    the very extremest ynch of possibilitie. I haue fowndred
    nine score and odde Postes: and heere (trauell-tainted
    as I am) haue, in my pure and immaculate Valour, taken
    Sir Iohn Colleuile of the Dale, a most furious Knight, and
    valorous Enemie: But what of that? hee saw mee, and
    yeelded: that I may iustly say with the hooke-nos'd
    fellow of Rome, I came, saw, and ouer-came

       Iohn. It was more of his Courtesie, then your deseruing

       Falst. I know not: heere hee is, and heere I yeeld
    him: and I beseech your Grace, let it be book'd, with
    the rest of this dayes deedes; or I sweare, I will haue it
    in a particular Ballad, with mine owne Picture on the top
    of it (Colleuile kissing my foot:) To the which course, if
    I be enforc'd, if you do not all shew like gilt two-pences
    to me; and I, in the cleare Skie of Fame, o're-shine you
    as much as the Full Moone doth the Cynders of the Element
    (which shew like Pinnes-heads to her) beleeue not
    the Word of the Noble: therefore let mee haue right,
    and let desert mount

       Iohn. Thine's too heauie to mount

       Falst. Let it shine then

       Iohn. Thine's too thick to shine

       Falst. Let it doe something (my good Lord) that may
    doe me good, and call it what you will

       Iohn. Is thy Name Colleuile?
      Col. It is (my Lord.)
      Iohn. A famous Rebell art thou, Colleuile

       Falst. And a famous true Subiect tooke him

       Col. I am (my Lord) but as my Betters are,
    That led me hither: had they beene rul'd by me,
    You should haue wonne them dearer then you haue

       Falst. I know not how they sold themselues, but thou
    like a kinde fellow, gau'st thy selfe away; and I thanke
    thee, for thee.
    Enter Westmerland.

      Iohn. Haue you left pursuit?
      West. Retreat is made, and Execution stay'd

       Iohn. Send Colleuile, with his Confederates,
    To Yorke, to present Execution.
    Blunt, leade him hence, and see you guard him sure.

    Exit with Colleuile.

    And now dispatch we toward the Court (my Lords)
    I heare the King, my Father, is sore sicke.
    Our Newes shall goe before vs, to his Maiestie,
    Which (Cousin) you shall beare, to comfort him:
    And wee with sober speede will follow you

       Falst. My Lord, I beseech you, giue me leaue to goe
    through Gloucestershire: and when you come to Court,
    stand my good Lord, 'pray, in your good report

       Iohn. Fare you well, Falstaffe: I, in my condition,
    Shall better speake of you, then you deserue.
    Enter.

      Falst. I would you had but the wit: 'twere better
    then your Dukedome. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded
    Boy doth not loue me, nor a man cannot
    make him laugh: but that's no maruaile, hee drinkes no
    Wine. There's neuer any of these demure Boyes come
    to any proofe: for thinne Drinke doth so ouer-coole
    their blood, and making many Fish-Meales, that they
    fall into a kinde of Male Greene-sicknesse: and then,
    when they marry, they get Wenches. They are generally
    Fooles, and Cowards; which some of vs should be too,
    but for inflamation. A good Sherris-Sack hath a two-fold
    operation in it: it ascends me into the Braine, dryes
    me there all the foolish, and dull, and cruddie Vapours,
    which enuiron it: makes it apprehensiue, quicke, forgetiue,
    full of nimble, fierie, and delectable shapes; which
    deliuer'd o're to the Voyce, the Tongue, which is the
    Birth, becomes excellent Wit. The second propertie of
    your excellent Sherris, is, the warming of the Blood:
    which before (cold, and setled) left the Liuer white, and
    pale; which is the Badge of Pusillanimitie, and Cowardize:
    but the Sherris warmes it, and makes it course
    from the inwards, to the parts extremes: it illuminateth
    the Face, which (as a Beacon) giues warning to all the
    rest of this little Kingdome (Man) to Arme: and then
    the Vitall Commoners, and in-land pettie Spirits, muster
    me all to their Captaine, the Heart; who great, and pufft
    vp with his Retinue, doth any Deed of Courage: and this
    Valour comes of Sherris. So, that skill in the Weapon
    is nothing, without Sack (for that sets it a-worke:) and
    Learning, a meere Hoord of Gold, kept by a Deuill, till
    Sack commences it, and sets it in act, and vse. Hereof
    comes it, that Prince Harry is valiant: for the cold blood
    hee did naturally inherite of his Father, hee hath, like
    leane, stirrill, and bare Land, manured, husbanded, and
    tyll'd, with excellent endeauour of drinking good, and
    good store of fertile Sherris, that hee is become very hot,
    and valiant. If I had a thousand Sonnes, the first Principle
    I would teach them, should be to forsweare thinne Potations,
    and to addict themselues to Sack.
    Enter Bardolph.

    How now Bardolph?
      Bard. The Armie is discharged all, and gone

       Falst. Let them goe: Ile through Gloucestershire,
    and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire: I
    haue him alreadie tempering betweene my finger and my
    thombe, and shortly will I seale with him. Come away.

    Exeunt.


    Scena Secunda.

    Enter King, Warwicke, Clarence, Gloucester.

      King. Now Lords, if Heauen doth giue successefull end
    To this Debate, that bleedeth at our doores,
    Wee will our Youth lead on to higher Fields,
    And draw no Swords, but what are sanctify'd.
    Our Nauie is addressed, our Power collected,
    Our Substitutes, in absence, well inuested,
    And euery thing lyes leuell to our wish;
    Onely wee want a little personall Strength:
    And pawse vs, till these Rebels, now a-foot,
    Come vnderneath the yoake of Gouernment

       War. Both which we doubt not, but your Maiestie
    Shall soone enioy

       King. Humphrey (my Sonne of Gloucester) where is
    the Prince, your Brother?
      Glo. I thinke hee's gone to hunt (my Lord) at Windsor

       King. And how accompanied?
      Glo. I doe not know (my Lord.)
      King. Is not his Brother, Thomas of Clarence, with
    him?
      Glo. No (my good Lord) hee is in presence heere

       Clar. What would my Lord, and Father?
      King. Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
    How chance thou art not with the Prince, thy Brother?
    Hee loues thee, and thou do'st neglect him (Thomas.)
    Thou hast a better place in his Affection,
    Then all thy Brothers: cherish it (my Boy)
    And Noble Offices thou may'st effect
    Of Mediation (after I am dead)
    Betweene his Greatnesse, and thy other Brethren.
    Therefore omit him not: blunt not his Loue,
    Nor loose the good aduantage of his Grace,
    By seeming cold, or carelesse of his will.
    For hee is gracious, if hee be obseru'd:
    Hee hath a Teare for Pitie, and a Hand
    Open (as Day) for melting Charitie:
    Yet notwithstanding, being incens'd, hee's Flint,
    As humorous as Winter, and as sudden,
    As Flawes congealed in the Spring of day.
    His temper therefore must be well obseru'd:
    Chide him for faults, and doe it reuerently,
    When you perceiue his blood enclin'd to mirth:
    But being moodie, giue him Line, and scope,
    Till that his passions (like a Whale on ground)
    Confound themselues with working. Learne this Thomas,
    And thou shalt proue a shelter to thy friends,
    A Hoope of Gold, to binde thy Brothers in:
    That the vnited Vessell of their Blood
    (Mingled with Venome of Suggestion,
    As force, perforce, the Age will powre it in)
    Shall neuer leake, though it doe worke as strong
    As Aconitum, or rash Gun-powder

       Clar. I shall obserue him with all care, and loue

       King. Why art thou not at Windsor with him (Thomas?)
      Clar. Hee is not there to day: hee dines in London

       King. And how accompanyed? Canst thou tell
    that?
      Clar. With Pointz, and other his continuall followers

       King. Most subiect is the fattest Soyle to Weedes:
    And hee (the Noble Image of my Youth)
    Is ouer-spread with them: therefore my griefe
    Stretches it selfe beyond the howre of death.
    The blood weepes from my heart, when I doe shape
    (In formes imaginarie) th' vnguided Dayes,
    And rotten Times, that you shall looke vpon,
    When I am sleeping with my Ancestors.
    For when his head-strong Riot hath no Curbe,
    When Rage and hot-Blood are his Counsailors,
    When Meanes and lauish Manners meete together;
    Oh, with what Wings shall his Affections flye
    Towards fronting Perill, and oppos'd Decay?
      War. My gracious Lord, you looke beyond him quite:
    The Prince but studies his Companions,
    Like a strange Tongue: wherein, to gaine the Language,
    'Tis needfull, that the most immodest word
    Be look'd vpon, and learn'd: which once attayn'd,
    Your Highnesse knowes, comes to no farther vse,
    But to be knowne, and hated. So, like grosse termes,
    The Prince will, in the perfectnesse of time,
    Cast off his followers: and their memorie
    Shall as a Patterne, or a Measure, liue,
    By which his Grace must mete the liues of others,
    Turning past-euills to aduantages

       King. 'Tis seldome, when the Bee doth leaue her Combe
    In the dead Carrion.
    Enter Westmerland.

    Who's heere? Westmerland?
      West. Health to my Soueraigne, and new happinesse
    Added to that, that I am to deliuer.
    Prince Iohn, your Sonne, doth kisse your Graces Hand:
    Mowbray, the Bishop, Scroope, Hastings, and all,
    Are brought to the Correction of your Law.
    There is not now a Rebels Sword vnsheath'd,
    But Peace puts forth her Oliue euery where:
    The manner how this Action hath beene borne,
    Here (at more leysure) may your Highnesse reade,
    With euery course, in his particular

       King. O Westmerland, thou art a Summer Bird,
    Which euer in the haunch of Winter sings
    The lifting vp of day.
    Enter Harcourt.

    Looke, heere's more newes

       Harc. From Enemies, Heauen keepe your Maiestie:
    And when they stand against you, may they fall,
    As those that I am come to tell you of.
    The Earle Northumberland, and the Lord Bardolfe,
    With a great Power of English, and of Scots,
    Are by the Sherife of Yorkeshire ouerthrowne:
    The manner, and true order of the fight,
    This Packet (please it you) containes at large

       King. And wherefore should these good newes
    Make me sicke?
    Will Fortune neuer come with both hands full,
    But write her faire words still in foulest Letters?
    Shee eyther giues a Stomack, and no Foode,
    (Such are the poore, in health) or else a Feast,
    And takes away the Stomack (such are the Rich,
    That haue aboundance, and enioy it not.)
    I should reioyce now, at this happy newes,
    And now my Sight fayles, and my Braine is giddie.
    O me, come neere me, now I am much ill

       Glo. Comfort your Maiestie

       Cla. Oh, my Royall Father

       West. My Soueraigne Lord, cheare vp your selfe, looke
    vp

       War. Be patient (Princes) you doe know, these Fits
    Are with his Highnesse very ordinarie.
    Stand from him, giue him ayre:
    Hee'le straight be well

       Clar. No, no, hee cannot long hold out: these pangs,
    Th' incessant care, and labour of his Minde,
    Hath wrought the Mure, that should confine it in,
    So thinne, that Life lookes through, and will breake out

       Glo. The people feare me: for they doe obserue
    Vnfather'd Heires, and loathly Births of Nature:
    The Seasons change their manners, as the Yeere
    Had found some Moneths asleepe, and leap'd them ouer

       Clar. The Riuer hath thrice flow'd, no ebbe betweene:
    And the old folke (Times doting Chronicles)
    Say it did so, a little time before
    That our great Grand-sire Edward sick'd, and dy'de

       War. Speake lower (Princes) for the King recouers

       Glo. This Apoplexie will (certaine) be his end

       King. I pray you take me vp, and beare me hence
    Into some other Chamber: softly 'pray.
    Let there be no noyse made (my gentle friends)
    Vnlesse some dull and fauourable hand
    Will whisper Musicke to my wearie Spirit

       War. Call for the Musicke in the other Roome

       King. Set me the Crowne vpon my Pillow here

       Clar. His eye is hollow, and hee changes much

       War. Lesse noyse, lesse noyse.
    Enter Prince Henry.

      P.Hen. Who saw the Duke of Clarence?
      Clar. I am here (Brother) full of heauinesse

       P.Hen. How now? Raine within doores, and none
    abroad? How doth the King?
      Glo. Exceeding ill

       P.Hen. Heard hee the good newes yet?
    Tell it him

       Glo. Hee alter'd much, vpon the hearing it

       P.Hen. If hee be sicke with Ioy,
    Hee'le recouer without Physicke

       War. Not so much noyse (my Lords)
    Sweet Prince speake lowe,
    The King, your Father, is dispos'd to sleepe

       Clar. Let vs with-draw into the other Roome

       War. Wil't please your Grace to goe along with vs?
      P.Hen. No: I will sit, and watch here, by the King.
    Why doth the Crowne lye there, vpon his Pillow,
    Being so troublesome a Bed-fellow?
    O pollish'd Perturbation! Golden Care!
    That keep'st the Ports of Slumber open wide,
    To many a watchfull Night: sleepe with it now,
    Yet not so sound, and halfe so deepely sweete,
    As hee whose Brow (with homely Biggen bound)
    Snores out the Watch of Night. O Maiestie!
    When thou do'st pinch thy Bearer, thou do'st sit
    Like a rich Armor, worne in heat of day,
    That scald'st with safetie: by his Gates of breath,
    There lyes a dowlney feather, which stirres not:
    Did hee suspire, that light and weightlesse dowlne
    Perforce must moue. My gracious Lord, my Father,
    This sleepe is sound indeede: this is a sleepe,
    That from this Golden Rigoll hath diuorc'd
    So many English Kings. Thy due, from me,
    Is Teares, and heauie Sorrowes of the Blood,
    Which Nature, Loue, and filiall tendernesse,
    Shall (O deare Father) pay thee plenteously.
    My due, from thee, is this Imperiall Crowne,
    Which (as immediate from thy Place, and Blood)
    Deriues it selfe to me. Loe, heere it sits,
    Which Heauen shall guard:
    And put the worlds whole strength into one gyant Arme,
    It shall not force this Lineall Honor from me.
    This, from thee, will I to mine leaue,
    As 'tis left to me.
    Enter.

    Enter Warwicke, Gloucester, Clarence.

      King. Warwicke, Gloucester, Clarence

       Clar. Doth the King call?
      War. What would your Maiestie? how fares your
    Grace?
      King. Why did you leaue me here alone (my Lords?)
      Cla. We left the Prince (my Brother) here (my Liege)
    Who vndertooke to sit and watch by you

       King. The Prince of Wales? where is hee? let mee
    see him

       War. This doore is open, hee is gone this way

       Glo. Hee came not through the Chamber where wee
    stayd

       King. Where is the Crowne? who tooke it from my
    Pillow?
      War. When wee with-drew (my Liege) wee left it
    heere

       King. The Prince hath ta'ne it hence:
    Goe seeke him out.
    Is hee so hastie, that hee doth suppose
    My sleepe, my death? Finde him (my Lord of Warwick)
    Chide him hither: this part of his conioynes
    With my disease, and helpes to end me.
    See Sonnes, what things you are:
    How quickly Nature falls into reuolt,
    When Gold becomes her Obiect?
    For this, the foolish ouer-carefull Fathers
    Haue broke their sleepes with thoughts,
    Their braines with care, their bones with industry.
    For this, they haue ingrossed and pyl'd vp
    The canker'd heapes of strange-atchieued Gold:
    For this, they haue beene thoughtfull, to inuest
    Their Sonnes with Arts, and Martiall Exercises:
    When, like the Bee, culling from euery flower
    The vertuous Sweetes, our Thighes packt with Wax,
    Our Mouthes with Honey, wee bring it to the Hiue;
    And like the Bees, are murthered for our paines.
    This bitter taste yeelds his engrossements,
    To the ending Father.
    Enter Warwicke.

    Now, where is hee, that will not stay so long,
    Till his Friend Sicknesse hath determin'd me?
      War. My Lord, I found the Prince in the next Roome,
    Washing with kindly Teares his gentle Cheekes,
    With such a deepe demeanure, in great sorrow,
    That Tyranny, which neuer quafft but blood,
    Would (by beholding him) haue wash'd his Knife
    With gentle eye-drops. Hee is comming hither

       King. But wherefore did hee take away the Crowne?
    Enter Prince Henry.

    Loe, where hee comes. Come hither to me (Harry.)
    Depart the Chamber, leaue vs heere alone.
    Enter.

      P.Hen. I neuer thought to heare you speake againe

       King. Thy wish was Father (Harry) to that thought:
    I stay too long by thee, I wearie thee.
    Do'st thou so hunger for my emptie Chayre,
    That thou wilt needes inuest thee with mine Honors,
    Before thy howre be ripe? O foolish Youth!
    Thou seek'st the Greatnesse, that will ouer-whelme thee.
    Stay but a little: for my Cloud of Dignitie
    Is held from falling, with so weake a winde,
    That it will quickly drop: my Day is dimme.
    Thou hast stolne that, which after some few howres
    Were thine, without offence: and at my death
    Thou hast seal'd vp my expectation.
    Thy Life did manifest, thou lou'dst me not,
    And thou wilt haue me dye assur'd of it.
    Thou hid'st a thousand Daggers in thy thoughts,
    Which thou hast whetted on thy stonie heart,
    To stab at halfe an howre of my Life.
    What? canst thou not forbeare me halfe an howre?
    Then get thee gone, and digge my graue thy selfe,
    And bid the merry Bels ring to thy eare
    That thou art Crowned, not that I am dead.
    Let all the Teares, that should bedew my Hearse
    Be drops of Balme, to sanctifie thy head:
    Onely compound me with forgotten dust.
    Giue that, which gaue thee life, vnto the Wormes:
    Plucke downe my Officers, breake my Decrees;
    For now a time is come, to mocke at Forme.
    Henry the fift is Crown'd: Vp Vanity,
    Downe Royall State: All you sage Counsailors, hence:
    And to the English Court, assemble now
    From eu'ry Region, Apes of Idlenesse.
    Now neighbor-Confines, purge you of your Scum:
    Haue you a Ruffian that will sweare? drinke? dance?
    Reuell the night? Rob? Murder? and commit
    The oldest sinnes, the newest kinde of wayes?
    Be happy, he will trouble you no more:
    England, shall double gill'd, his trebble guilt.
    England, shall giue him Office, Honor, Might:
    For the Fift Harry, from curb'd License pluckes
    The muzzle of Restraint; and the wilde Dogge
    Shall flesh his tooth in euery Innocent.
    O my poore Kingdome (sicke, with ciuill blowes)
    When that my Care could not with-hold thy Ryots,
    What wilt thou do, when Ryot is thy Care?
    O, thou wilt be a Wildernesse againe,
    Peopled with Wolues (thy old Inhabitants.)
      Prince. O pardon me (my Liege)
    But for my Teares,
    The most Impediments vnto my Speech,
    I had fore-stall'd this deere, and deepe Rebuke,
    Ere you (with greefe) had spoke, and I had heard
    The course of it so farre. There is your Crowne,
    And he that weares the Crowne immortally,
    Long guard it yours. If I affect it more,
    Then as your Honour, and as your Renowne,
    Let me no more from this Obedience rise,
    Which my most true, and inward duteous Spirit
    Teacheth this prostrate, and exteriour bending.
    Heauen witnesse with me, when I heere came in,
    And found no course of breath within your Maiestie,
    How cold it strooke my heart. If I do faine,
    O let me, in my present wildenesse, dye,
    And neuer liue, to shew th' incredulous World,
    The Noble change that I haue purposed.
    Comming to looke on you, thinking you dead,
    (And dead almost (my Liege) to thinke you were)
    I spake vnto the Crowne (as hauing sense)
    And thus vpbraided it. The Care on thee depending,
    Hath fed vpon the body of my Father,
    Therefore, thou best of Gold, art worst of Gold.
    Other, lesse fine in Charract, is more precious,
    Preseruing life, in Med'cine potable:
    But thou, most Fine, most Honour'd, most Renown'd,
    Hast eate the Bearer vp.
    Thus (my Royall Liege)
    Accusing it, I put it on my Head,
    To try with it (as with an Enemie,
    That had before my face murdred my Father)
    The Quarrell of a true Inheritor.
    But if it did infect my blood with Ioy,
    Or swell my Thoughts, to any straine of Pride,
    If any Rebell, or vaine spirit of mine,
    Did, with the least Affection of a Welcome,
    Giue entertainment to the might of it,
    Let heauen, for euer, keepe it from my head,
    And make me, as the poorest Vassaile is,
    That doth with awe, and terror kneele to it

       King. O my Sonne!
    Heauen put it in thy minde to take it hence,
    That thou might'st ioyne the more, thy Fathers loue,
    Pleading so wisely, in excuse of it.
    Come hither Harrie, sit thou by my bedde,
    And heare (I thinke, the very latest Counsell
    That euer I shall breath: Heauen knowes, my Sonne)
    By what by-pathes, and indirect crook'd-wayes
    I met this Crowne: and I my selfe know well
    How troublesome it sate vpon my head.
    To thee, it shall descend with better Quiet,
    Better Opinion, better Confirmation:
    For all the soyle of the Atchieuement goes
    With me, into the Earth. It seem'd in mee,
    But as an Honour snatch'd with boyst'rous hand,
    And I had many liuing, to vpbraide
    My gaine of it, by their Assistances,
    Which dayly grew to Quarrell, and to Blood-shed,
    Wounding supposed Peace.
    All these bold Feares,
    Thou seest (with perill) I haue answered:
    For all my Reigne, hath beene but as a Scene
    Acting that argument. And now my death
    Changes the Moode: For what in me, was purchas'd,
    Falles vpon thee, in a more Fayrer sort.
    So thou, the Garland wear'st successiuely.
    Yet, though thou stand'st more sure, then I could do,
    Thou art not firme enough, since greefes are greene:
    And all thy Friends, which thou must make thy Friends
    Haue but their stings, and teeth, newly tak'n out,
    By whose fell working, I was first aduanc'd,
    And by whose power, I well might lodge a Feare
    To be againe displac'd. Which to auoyd,
    I cut them off: and had a purpose now
    To leade out many to the Holy Land;
    Least rest, and lying still, might make them looke
    Too neere vnto my State.
    Therefore (my Harrie)
    Be it thy course to busie giddy Mindes
    With Forraigne Quarrels: that Action hence borne out,
    May waste the memory of the former dayes.
    More would I, but my Lungs are wasted so,
    That strength of Speech it vtterly deni'de mee.
    How I came by the Crowne, O heauen forgiue:
    And grant it may, with thee, in true peace liue

       Prince. My gracious Liege:
    You wonne it, wore it: kept it, gaue it me,
    Then plaine and right must my possession be;
    Which I, with more, then with a Common paine,
    'Gainst all the World, will rightfully maintaine.
    Enter Lord Iohn of Lancaster, and Warwicke.

      King. Looke, looke,
    Heere comes my Iohn of Lancaster:
      Iohn. Health, Peace, and Happinesse,
    To my Royall Father

       King. Thou bring'st me happinesse and Peace
    (Sonne Iohn:)
    But health (alacke) with youthfull wings is flowne
    From this bare, wither'd Trunke. Vpon thy sight
    My worldly businesse makes a period.
    Where is my Lord of Warwicke?
      Prin. My Lord of Warwicke

       King. Doth any name particular, belong
    Vnto the Lodging, where I first did swoon'd?
      War. 'Tis call'd Ierusalem, my Noble Lord

       King. Laud be to heauen:
    Euen there my life must end.
    It hath beene prophesi'de to me many yeares,
    I should not dye, but in Ierusalem:
    Which (vainly) I suppos'd the Holy-Land.
    But beare me to that Chamber, there Ile lye:
    In that Ierusalem, shall Harry dye.

    Exeunt.


    Actus Quintus. Scoena Prima.

    Enter Shallow, Silence, Falstaffe, Bardolfe, Page, and Dauie.

      Shal. By Cocke and Pye, you shall not away to night.
    What Dauy, I say

       Fal. You must excuse me, M[aster]. Robert Shallow

       Shal. I will not excuse you: you shall not be excused.
    Excuses shall not be admitted: there is no excuse shall
    serue: you shall not be excus'd.
    Why Dauie

       Dauie. Heere sir

       Shal. Dauy, Dauy, Dauy, let me see (Dauy) let me see:
    William Cooke, bid him come hither. Sir Iohn, you shal
    not be excus'd

       Dauy. Marry sir, thus: those Precepts cannot bee
    seru'd: and againe sir, shall we sowe the head-land with
    Wheate?
      Shal. With red Wheate Dauy. But for William Cook:
    are there no yong Pigeons?
      Dauy. Yes Sir.
    Heere is now the Smithes note, for Shooing,
    And Plough-Irons

       Shal. Let it be cast, and payde: Sir Iohn, you shall
    not be excus'd

       Dauy. Sir, a new linke to the Bucket must needes bee
    had: And Sir, doe you meane to stoppe any of Williams
    Wages, about the Sacke he lost the other day, at Hinckley
    Fayre?
      Shal. He shall answer it:
    Some Pigeons Dauy, a couple of short-legg'd Hennes: a
    ioynt of Mutton, and any pretty little tine Kickshawes,
    tell William Cooke

       Dauy. Doth the man of Warre, stay all night sir?
      Shal. Yes Dauy:
    I will vse him well. A Friend i'th Court, is better then a
    penny in purse. Vse his men well Dauy, for they are arrant
    Knaues, and will backe-bite

       Dauy. No worse then they are bitten, sir: For they
    haue maruellous fowle linnen

       Shallow. Well conceited Dauy: about thy Businesse,
    Dauy

       Dauy. I beseech you sir,
    To countenance William Visor of Woncot, against Clement
    Perkes of the hill

       Shal. There are many Complaints Dauy, against that
    Visor, that Visor is an arrant Knaue, on my knowledge

       Dauy. I graunt your Worship, that he is a knaue (Sir:)
    But yet heauen forbid Sir, but a Knaue should haue some
    Countenance, at his Friends request. An honest man sir,
    is able to speake for himselfe, when a Knaue is not. I haue
    seru'd your Worshippe truely sir, these eight yeares: and
    if I cannot once or twice in a Quarter beare out a knaue,
    against an honest man, I haue but a very litle credite with
    your Worshippe. The Knaue is mine honest Friend Sir,
    therefore I beseech your Worship, let him bee Countenanc'd

       Shal. Go too,
    I say he shall haue no wrong: Looke about Dauy.
    Where are you Sir Iohn? Come, off with your Boots.
    Giue me your hand M[aster]. Bardolfe

       Bard. I am glad to see your Worship

       Shal. I thanke thee, with all my heart, kinde Master
    Bardolfe: and welcome my tall Fellow:
    Come Sir Iohn

       Falstaffe. Ile follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.
    Bardolfe, looke to our Horsses. If I were saw'de into
    Quantities, I should make foure dozen of such bearded
    Hermites staues, as Master Shallow. It is a wonderfull
    thing to see the semblable Coherence of his mens spirits,
    and his: They, by obseruing of him, do beare themselues
    like foolish Iustices: Hee, by conuersing with them, is
    turn'd into a Iustice-like Seruingman. Their spirits are
    so married in Coniunction, with the participation of Society,
    that they flocke together in consent, like so many
    Wilde-Geese. If I had a suite to Mayster Shallow, I
    would humour his men, with the imputation of beeing
    neere their Mayster. If to his Men, I would currie with
    Maister Shallow, that no man could better command his
    Seruants. It is certaine, that either wise bearing, or ignorant
    Carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of
    another: therefore, let men take heede of their Companie.
    I will deuise matter enough out of this Shallow, to
    keepe Prince Harry in continuall Laughter, the wearing
    out of sixe Fashions (which is foure Tearmes) or two Actions,
    and he shall laugh with Interuallums. O it is much
    that a Lye (with a slight Oath) and a iest (with a sadde
    brow) will doe, with a Fellow, that neuer had the Ache
    in his shoulders. O you shall see him laugh, till his Face
    be like a wet Cloake, ill laid vp

       Shal. Sir Iohn

       Falst. I come Master Shallow, I come Master Shallow.

    Exeunt.

    Scena Secunda.


    Enter the Earle of Warwicke, and the Lord Chiefe Iustice.

      Warwicke. How now, my Lord Chiefe Iustice, whether
    away?
      Ch.Iust. How doth the King?
      Warw. Exceeding well: his Cares
    Are now, all ended

       Ch.Iust. I hope, not dead

       Warw. Hee's walk'd the way of Nature,
    And to our purposes, he liues no more

       Ch.Iust. I would his Maiesty had call'd me with him,
    The seruice, that I truly did his life,
    Hath left me open to all iniuries

       War. Indeed I thinke the yong King loues you not

       Ch.Iust. I know he doth not, and do arme my selfe
    To welcome the condition of the Time,
    Which cannot looke more hideously vpon me,
    Then I haue drawne it in my fantasie.
    Enter Iohn of Lancaster, Gloucester, and Clarence.

      War. Heere come the heauy Issue of dead Harrie:
    O, that the liuing Harrie had the temper
    Of him, the worst of these three Gentlemen:
    How many Nobles then, should hold their places,
    That must strike saile, to Spirits of vilde sort?
      Ch.Iust. Alas, I feare, all will be ouer-turn'd

       Iohn. Good morrow Cosin Warwick, good morrow

       Glou. Cla. Good morrow, Cosin

       Iohn. We meet, like men, that had forgot to speake

       War. We do remember: but our Argument
    Is all too heauy, to admit much talke

       Ioh. Well: Peace be with him, that hath made vs heauy
      Ch.Iust. Peace be with vs, least we be heauier

       Glou. O, good my Lord, you haue lost a friend indeed:
    And I dare sweare, you borrow not that face
    Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your owne

       Iohn. Though no man be assur'd what grace to finde,
    You stand in coldest expectation.
    I am the sorrier, would 'twere otherwise

       Cla. Wel, you must now speake Sir Iohn Falstaffe faire,
    Which swimmes against your streame of Quality

       Ch.Iust. Sweet Princes: what I did, I did in Honor,
    Led by th' Imperiall Conduct of my Soule,
    And neuer shall you see, that I will begge
    A ragged, and fore-stall'd Remission.
    If Troth, and vpright Innocency fayle me,
    Ile to the King (my Master) that is dead,
    And tell him, who hath sent me after him

       War. Heere comes the Prince.
    Enter Prince Henrie.

      Ch.Iust. Good morrow: and heauen saue your Maiesty
      Prince. This new, and gorgeous Garment, Maiesty,
    Sits not so easie on me, as you thinke.
    Brothers, you mixe your Sadnesse with some Feare:
    This is the English, not the Turkish Court:
    Not Amurah, an Amurah succeeds,
    But Harry, Harry: Yet be sad (good Brothers)
    For (to speake truth) it very well becomes you:
    Sorrow, so Royally in you appeares,
    That I will deeply put the Fashion on,
    And weare it in my heart. Why then be sad,
    But entertaine no more of it (good Brothers)
    Then a ioynt burthen, laid vpon vs all.
    For me, by Heauen (I bid you be assur'd)
    Ile be your Father, and your Brother too:
    Let me but beare your Loue, Ile beare your Cares;
    But weepe that Harrie's dead, and so will I.
    But Harry liues, that shall conuert those Teares
    By number, into houres of Happinesse

       Iohn, &c. We hope no other from your Maiesty

       Prin. You all looke strangely on me: and you most,
    You are (I thinke) assur'd, I loue you not

       Ch.Iust. I am assur'd (if I be measur'd rightly)
    Your Maiesty hath no iust cause to hate mee

       Pr. No? How might a Prince of my great hopes forget
    So great Indignities you laid vpon me?
    What? Rate? Rebuke? and roughly send to Prison
    Th' immediate Heire of England? Was this easie?
    May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?
      Ch.Iust. I then did vse the Person of your Father:
    The Image of his power, lay then in me,
    And in th' administration of his Law,
    Whiles I was busie for the Commonwealth,
    Your Highnesse pleased to forget my place,
    The Maiesty, and power of Law, and Iustice,
    The Image of the King, whom I presented,
    And strooke me in my very Seate of Iudgement:
    Whereon (as an Offender to your Father)
    I gaue bold way to my Authority,
    And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
    Be you contented, wearing now the Garland,
    To haue a Sonne, set your Decrees at naught?
    To plucke downe Iustice from your awefull Bench?
    To trip the course of Law, and blunt the Sword
    That guards the peace, and safety of your Person?
    Nay more, to spurne at your most Royall Image,
    And mocke your workings, in a Second body?
    Question your Royall Thoughts, make the case yours:
    Be now the Father, and propose a Sonne:
    Heare your owne dignity so much prophan'd,
    See your most dreadfull Lawes, so loosely slighted;
    Behold your selfe, so by a Sonne disdained:
    And then imagine me, taking your part,
    And in your power, soft silencing your Sonne:
    After this cold considerance, sentence me;
    And, as you are a King, speake in your State,
    What I haue done, that misbecame my place,
    My person, or my Lieges Soueraigntie

       Prin. You are right Iustice, and you weigh this well:
    Therefore still beare the Ballance, and the Sword:
    And I do wish your Honors may encrease,
    Till you do liue, to see a Sonne of mine
    Offend you, and obey you, as I did.
    So shall I liue, to speake my Fathers words:
    Happy am I, that haue a man so bold,
    That dares do Iustice, on my proper Sonne;
    And no lesse happy, hauing such a Sonne,
    That would deliuer vp his Greatnesse so,
    Into the hands of Iustice. You did commit me:
    For which, I do commit into your hand,
    Th' vnstained Sword that you haue vs'd to beare:
    With this Remembrance; That you vse the same
    With the like bold, iust, and impartiall spirit
    As you haue done 'gainst me. There is my hand,
    You shall be as a Father, to my Youth:
    My voice shall sound, as you do prompt mine eare,
    And I will stoope, and humble my Intents,
    To your well-practis'd, wise Directions.
    And Princes all, beleeue me, I beseech you:
    My Father is gone wilde into his Graue,
    (For in his Tombe, lye my Affections)
    And with his Spirits, sadly I suruiue,
    To mocke the expectation of the World;
    To frustrate Prophesies, and to race out
    Rotten Opinion, who hath writ me downe
    After my seeming. The Tide of Blood in me,
    Hath prowdly flow'd in Vanity, till now.
    Now doth it turne, and ebbe backe to the Sea,
    Where it shall mingle with the state of Floods,
    And flow henceforth in formall Maiesty.
    Now call we our High Court of Parliament,
    And let vs choose such Limbes of Noble Counsaile,
    That the great Body of our State may go
    In equall ranke, with the best gouern'd Nation,
    That Warre, or Peace, or both at once may be
    As things acquainted and familiar to vs,
    In which you (Father) shall haue formost hand.
    Our Coronation done, we will accite
    (As I before remembred) all our State,
    And heauen (consigning to my good intents)
    No Prince, nor Peere, shall haue iust cause to say,
    Heauen shorten Harries happy life, one day.

    Exeunt.

    no matter, this poore shew doth better: this doth inferre
    the zeale I had to see him

       Shal. It doth so

       Falst. It shewes my earnestnesse in affection

       Pist. It doth so

       Fal. My deuotion

       Pist. It doth, it doth, it doth

       Fal. As it were, to ride day and night,
    And not to deliberate, not to remember,
    Not to haue patience to shift me

       Shal. It is most certaine

       Fal. But to stand stained with Trauaile, and sweating
    with desire to see him, thinking of nothing else, putting
    all affayres in obliuion, as if there were nothing els to bee
    done, but to see him

       Pist. 'Tis semper idem: for obsque hoc nihil est. 'Tis all
    in euery part

    is in base Durance, and contagious prison: Hall'd thither
    by most Mechanicall and durty hand. Rowze vppe
    Reuenge from Ebon den, with fell Alecto's Snake, for
    Dol is in. Pistol, speakes nought but troth

       Fal. I will deliuer her

       Pistol. There roar'd the Sea: and Trumpet Clangour
    sounds.

    The Trumpets sound. Enter King Henrie the Fift, Brothers, Lord
    Chiefe
    Iustice.

      Falst. Saue thy Grace, King Hall, my Royall Hall

       Pist. The heauens thee guard, and keepe, most royall
    Impe of Fame

       Fal. 'Saue thee my sweet Boy

       King. My Lord Chiefe Iustice, speake to that vaine
    man

       Ch.Iust. Haue you your wits?
    Know you what 'tis you speake?
      Falst. My King, my Ioue; I speake to thee, my heart

       King. I know thee not, old man: Fall to thy Prayers:
    How ill white haires become a Foole, and Iester?
    I haue long dream'd of such a kinde of man,
    So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so prophane:
    But being awake, I do despise my dreame.
    Make lesse thy body (hence) and more thy Grace,
    Leaue gourmandizing; Know the Graue doth gape
    For thee, thrice wider then for other men.
    Reply not to me, with a Foole-borne Iest,
    Presume not, that I am the thing I was,
    For heauen doth know (so shall the world perceiue)
    That I haue turn'd away my former Selfe,
    So will I those that kept me Companie.
    When thou dost heare I am, as I haue bin,
    Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou was't
    The Tutor and the Feeder of my Riots:
    Till then, I banish thee, on paine of death,
    As I haue done the rest of my Misleaders,
    Not to come neere our Person, by ten mile.
    For competence of life, I will allow you,
    That lacke of meanes enforce you not to euill:
    And as we heare you do reforme your selues,
    We will according to your strength, and qualities,
    Giue you aduancement. Be it your charge (my Lord)
    To see perform'd the tenure of our word. Set on.

    Exit King.

      Fal. Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound

       Shal. I marry Sir Iohn, which I beseech you to let me
    haue home with me

       Fal. That can hardly be, M[aster]. Shallow, do not you grieue
    at this: I shall be sent for in priuate to him: Looke you,
    he must seeme thus to the world: feare not your aduancement:
    I will be the man yet, that shall make you great

       Shal. I cannot well perceiue how, vnlesse you should
    giue me your Doublet, and stuffe me out with Straw. I
    beseech you, good Sir Iohn, let mee haue fiue hundred of
    my thousand

       Fal. Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you
    heard, was but a colour

       Shall. A colour I feare, that you will dye in, Sir Iohn

       Fal. Feare no colours, go with me to dinner:
    Come Lieutenant Pistol, come Bardolfe,
    I shall be sent for soone at night

       Ch.Iust. Go carry Sir Iohn Falstaffe to the Fleete,
    Take all his Company along with him

       Fal. My Lord, my Lord

       Ch.Iust. I cannot now speake, I will heare you soone:
    Take them away

       Pist. Si fortuna me tormento, spera me contento.

    Exit. Manent Lancaster and Chiefe Iustice

       Iohn. I like this faire proceeding of the Kings:
    He hath intent his wonted Followers
    Shall all be very well prouided for:
    But all are banisht, till their conuersations
    Appeare more wise, and modest to the world

       Ch.Iust. And so they are

       Iohn. The King hath call'd his Parliament,
    My Lord

       Ch.Iust. He hath

       Iohn. I will lay oddes, that ere this yeere expire,
    We beare our Ciuill Swords, and Natiue fire
    As farre as France. I heare a Bird so sing,
    Whose Musicke (to my thinking) pleas'd the King.
    Come, will you hence?

    Exeunt.

    FINIS.

    EPILOGVE.

    First, my Feare: then, my Curtsie: last, my Speech.
    My Feare, is your Displeasure: My Curtsie, my Dutie:
    And my speech, to Begge your Pardons. If you looke for a
    good speech now, you vndoe me: For what I haue to say, is
    of mine owne making: and what (indeed) I should say, will
    (I doubt) prooue mine owne marring. But to the Purpose,
    and so to the Venture. Be it knowne to you (as it is very
    well) I was lately heere in the end of a displeasing Play, to pray
    your
    Patien for it, and to promise you a Better: I did meane (indeede) to
    pay you with
    thi which if (like an ill Venture) it come vnluckily home, I breake;
    and you,
    my Creditors lose. Heere I promist you I would be, and heere I
    commit my Bodie
    to your Mercies: Bate me some, and I will pay you some, and (as
    most Debtors d
    promise you infinitely.
    If my Tongue cannot entreate you to acquit me: will you command
    me to vse
    my Legges? And yet that were but light payment, to Dance out of
    your debt:
    But
    a good Conscience, will make any possible satisfaction, and so
    will I. All
    the
    heere haue forgiuen me, if the Gentlemen will not, then the
    Gentlemen
    do not agree with the Gentlewomen, which was neuer seene
    before, in such an
    As
    One word more, I beseech you: if you be not too much cloid with
    Fat Meate,
    our humble Author will continue the Story (with Sir Iohn in it) and
    make yo

    merry, with faire Katherine of France: where (for any thing I
    know) Fals
    shall dye of a sweat, vnlesse already he be kill'd with your hard
    Opinions:

    For Old-Castle dyed a Martyr, and this is not the man. My Tongue
    is wearie
    when my Legs are too, I will bid you good night; and so kneele
    downe before

    The Life of Henry the Fift

    Enter Prologue.

    O For a Muse of Fire, that would ascend
    The brightest Heauen of Inuention:
    A Kingdome for a Stage, Princes to Act,
    And Monarchs to behold the swelling Scene.
    Then should the Warlike Harry, like himselfe,
    Assume the Port of Mars, and at his heeles
    (Leasht in, like Hounds) should Famine, Sword, and Fire
    Crouch for employment. But pardon, Gentles all:
    The flat vnraysed Spirits, that hath dar'd,
    On this vnworthy Scaffold, to bring forth
    So great an Obiect. Can this Cock-Pit hold
    The vastie fields of France? Or may we cramme
    Within this Woodden O, the very Caskes
    That did affright the Ayre at Agincourt?
    O pardon: since a crooked Figure may
    Attest in little place a Million,
    And let vs, Cyphers to this great Accompt,
    On your imaginarie Forces worke.
    Suppose within the Girdle of these Walls
    Are now confin'd two mightie Monarchies,
    Whose high, vp-reared, and abutting Fronts,
    The perillous narrow Ocean parts asunder.
    Peece out our imperfections with your thoughts:
    Into a thousand parts diuide one Man,
    And make imaginarie Puissance.
    Thinke when we talke of Horses, that you see them
    Printing their prowd Hoofes i'th' receiuing Earth:
    For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our Kings,
    Carry them here and there: Iumping o're Times;
    Turning th' accomplishment of many yeeres
    Into an Howre-glasse: for the which supplie,
    Admit me Chorus to this Historie;
    Who Prologue-like, your humble patience pray,
    Gently to heare, kindly to iudge our Play.
    Enter.


    Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.

    Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely.

      Bish.Cant. My Lord, Ile tell you, that selfe Bill is vrg'd,
    Which in th' eleue[n]th yere of y last Kings reign
    Was like, and had indeed against vs past,
    But that the scambling and vnquiet time
    Did push it out of farther question

       Bish.Ely. But how my Lord shall we resist it now?
      Bish.Cant. It must be thought on: if it passe against vs,
    We loose the better halfe of our Possession:
    For all the Temporall Lands, which men deuout
    By Testament haue giuen to the Church,
    Would they strip from vs; being valu'd thus,
    As much as would maintaine, to the Kings honor,
    Full fifteene Earles, and fifteene hundred Knights,
    Six thousand and two hundred good Esquires:
    And to reliefe of Lazars, and weake age
    Of indigent faint Soules, past corporall toyle,
    A hundred Almes-houses, right well supply'd:
    And to the Coffers of the King beside,
    A thousand pounds by th' yeere. Thus runs the Bill

       Bish.Ely. This would drinke deepe

       Bish.Cant. 'Twould drinke the Cup and all

       Bish.Ely. But what preuention?
      Bish.Cant. The King is full of grace, and faire regard

       Bish.Ely. And a true louer of the holy Church

       Bish.Cant. The courses of his youth promis'd it not.
    The breath no sooner left his Fathers body,
    But that his wildnesse, mortify'd in him,
    Seem'd to dye too: yea, at that very moment,
    Consideration like an Angell came,
    And whipt th' offending Adam out of him;
    Leauing his body as a Paradise,
    T' inuelop and containe Celestiall Spirits.
    Neuer was such a sodaine Scholler made:
    Neuer came Reformation in a Flood,
    With such a heady currance scowring faults:
    Nor neuer Hidra-headed Wilfulnesse
    So soone did loose his Seat; and all at once;
    As in this King

       Bish.Ely. We are blessed in the Change

       Bish.Cant. Heare him but reason in Diuinitie;
    And all-admiring, with an inward wish
    You would desire the King were made a Prelate:
    Heare him debate of Common-wealth Affaires;
    You would say, it hath been all in all his study:
    List his discourse of Warre; and you shall heare
    A fearefull Battaile rendred you in Musique.
    Turne him to any Cause of Pollicy,
    The Gordian Knot of it he will vnloose,
    Familiar as his Garter: that when he speakes,
    The Ayre, a Charter'd Libertine, is still,
    And the mute Wonder lurketh in mens eares,
    To steale his sweet and honyed Sentences:
    So that the Art and Practique part of Life,
    Must be the Mistresse to this Theorique.
    Which is a wonder how his Grace should gleane it,
    Since his addiction was to Courses vaine,
    His Companies vnletter'd, rude, and shallow,
    His Houres fill'd vp with Ryots, Banquets, Sports;
    And neuer noted in him any studie,
    Any retyrement, any sequestration,
    From open Haunts and Popularitie

       B.Ely. The Strawberry growes vnderneath the Nettle,
    And holesome Berryes thriue and ripen best,
    Neighbour'd by Fruit of baser qualitie:
    And so the Prince obscur'd his Contemplation
    Vnder the Veyle of Wildnesse, which (no doubt)
    Grew like the Summer Grasse, fastest by Night,
    Vnseene, yet cressiue in his facultie

       B.Cant. It must be so; for Miracles are ceast:
    And therefore we must needes admit the meanes,
    How things are perfected

       B.Ely. But my good Lord:
    How now for mittigation of this Bill,
    Vrg'd by the Commons? doth his Maiestie
    Incline to it, or no?
      B.Cant. He seemes indifferent:
    Or rather swaying more vpon our part,
    Then cherishing th' exhibiters against vs:
    For I haue made an offer to his Maiestie,
    Vpon our Spirituall Conuocation,
    And in regard of Causes now in hand,
    Which I haue open'd to his Grace at large,
    As touching France, to giue a greater Summe,
    Then euer at one time the Clergie yet
    Did to his Predecessors part withall

       B.Ely. How did this offer seeme receiu'd, my Lord?
      B.Cant. With good acceptance of his Maiestie:
    Saue that there was not time enough to heare,
    As I perceiu'd his Grace would faine haue done,
    The seueralls and vnhidden passages
    Of his true Titles to some certaine Dukedomes,
    And generally, to the Crowne and Seat of France,
    Deriu'd from Edward, his great Grandfather

       B.Ely. What was th' impediment that broke this off?
      B.Cant. The French Embassador vpon that instant
    Crau'd audience; and the howre I thinke is come,
    To giue him hearing: Is it foure a Clock?
      B.Ely. It is

       B.Cant. Then goe we in, to know his Embassie:
    Which I could with a ready guesse declare,
    Before the Frenchman speake a word of it

       B.Ely. Ile wait vpon you, and I long to heare it.

    Exeunt.

    Enter the King, Humfrey, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick,
    Westmerland, and
    Exeter.

      King. Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
      Exeter. Not here in presence

       King. Send for him, good Vnckle

       Westm. Shall we call in th' Ambassador, my Liege?
      King. Not yet, my Cousin: we would be resolu'd,
    Before we heare him, of some things of weight,
    That taske our thoughts, concerning vs and France.
    Enter two Bishops.

      B.Cant. God and his Angels guard your sacred Throne,
    And make you long become it

       King. Sure we thanke you.
    My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed,
    And iustly and religiously vnfold,
    Why the Law Salike, that they haue in France,
    Or should or should not barre vs in our Clayme:
    And God forbid, my deare and faithfull Lord,
    That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
    Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule,
    With opening Titles miscreate, whose right
    Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth:
    For God doth know, how many now in health,
    Shall drop their blood, in approbation
    Of what your reuerence shall incite vs to.
    Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person,
    How you awake our sleeping Sword of Warre;
    We charge you in the Name of God take heed:
    For neuer two such Kingdomes did contend,
    Without much fall of blood, whose guiltlesse drops
    Are euery one, a Woe, a sore Complaint,
    'Gainst him, whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords,
    That makes such waste in briefe mortalitie.
    Vnder this Coniuration, speake my Lord:
    For we will heare, note, and beleeue in heart,
    That what you speake, is in your Conscience washt,
    As pure as sinne with Baptisme

       B.Can. Then heare me gracious Soueraign, & you Peers,
    That owe your selues, your liues, and seruices,
    To this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre
    To make against your Highnesse Clayme to France,
    But this which they produce from Pharamond,
    In terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant,
    No Woman shall succeed in Salike Land:
    Which Salike Land, the French vniustly gloze
    To be the Realme of France, and Pharamond
    The founder of this Law, and Female Barre.
    Yet their owne Authors faithfully affirme,
    That the Land Salike is in Germanie,
    Betweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue:
    Where Charles the Great hauing subdu'd the Saxons,
    There left behind and settled certaine French:
    Who holding in disdaine the German Women,
    For some dishonest manners of their life,
    Establisht then this Law; to wit, No Female
    Should be Inheritrix in Salike Land:
    Which Salike (as I said) 'twixt Elue and Sala,
    Is at this day in Germanie, call'd Meisen.
    Then doth it well appeare, the Salike Law
    Was not deuised for the Realme of France:
    Nor did the French possesse the Salike Land,
    Vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres
    After defunction of King Pharamond,
    Idly suppos'd the founder of this Law,
    Who died within the yeere of our Redemption,
    Foure hundred twentie six: and Charles the Great
    Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French
    Beyond the Riuer Sala, in the yeere
    Eight hundred fiue. Besides, their Writers say,
    King Pepin, which deposed Childerike,
    Did as Heire Generall, being descended
    Of Blithild, which was Daughter to King Clothair,
    Make Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France.
    Hugh Capet also, who vsurpt the Crowne
    Of Charles the Duke of Loraine, sole Heire male
    Of the true Line and Stock of Charles the Great:
    To find his Title with some shewes of truth,
    Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,
    Conuey'd himselfe as th' Heire to th' Lady Lingare,
    Daughter to Charlemaine, who was the Sonne
    To Lewes the Emperour, and Lewes the Sonne
    Of Charles the Great: also King Lewes the Tenth,
    Who was sole Heire to the Vsurper Capet,
    Could not keepe quiet in his conscience,
    Wearing the Crowne of France, 'till satisfied,
    That faire Queene Isabel, his Grandmother,
    Was Lineall of the Lady Ermengare,
    Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Loraine:
    By the which Marriage, the Lyne of Charles the Great
    Was re-vnited to the Crowne of France.
    So, that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne,
    King Pepins Title, and Hugh Capets Clayme,
    King Lewes his satisfaction, all appeare
    To hold in Right and Title of the Female:
    So doe the Kings of France vnto this day.
    Howbeit, they would hold vp this Salique Law,
    To barre your Highnesse clayming from the Female,
    And rather chuse to hide them in a Net,
    Then amply to imbarre their crooked Titles,
    Vsurpt from you and your Progenitors

       King. May I with right and conscience make this claim?
      Bish.Cant. The sinne vpon my head, dread Soueraigne:
    For in the Booke of Numbers is it writ,
    When the man dyes, let the Inheritance
    Descend vnto the Daughter. Gracious Lord,
    Stand for your owne, vnwind your bloody Flagge,
    Looke back into your mightie Ancestors:
    Goe my dread Lord, to your great Grandsires Tombe,
    From whom you clayme; inuoke his Warlike Spirit,
    And your Great Vnckles, Edward the Black Prince,
    Who on the French ground play'd a Tragedie,
    Making defeat on the full Power of France:
    Whiles his most mightie Father on a Hill
    Stood smiling, to behold his Lyons Whelpe
    Forrage in blood of French Nobilitie.
    O Noble English, that could entertaine
    With halfe their Forces, the full pride of France,
    And let another halfe stand laughing by,
    All out of worke, and cold for action

       Bish. Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,
    And with your puissant Arme renew their Feats;
    You are their Heire, you sit vpon their Throne:
    The Blood and Courage that renowned them,
    Runs in your Veines: and my thrice-puissant Liege
    Is in the very May-Morne of his Youth,
    Ripe for Exploits and mightie Enterprises

       Exe. Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth
    Doe all expect, that you should rowse your selfe,
    As did the former Lyons of your Blood

       West. They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might;
    So hath your Highnesse: neuer King of England
    Had Nobles richer, and more loyall Subiects,
    Whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in England,
    And lye pauillion'd in the fields of France

       Bish.Can. O let their bodyes follow my deare Liege
    With Bloods, and Sword and Fire, to win your Right:
    In ayde whereof, we of the Spiritualtie
    Will rayse your Highnesse such a mightie Summe,
    As neuer did the Clergie at one time
    Bring in to any of your Ancestors

       King. We must not onely arme t' inuade the French,
    But lay downe our proportions, to defend
    Against the Scot, who will make roade vpon vs,
    With all aduantages

       Bish.Can. They of those Marches, gracious Soueraign,
    Shall be a Wall sufficient to defend
    Our in-land from the pilfering Borderers

       King. We do not meane the coursing snatchers onely,
    But feare the maine intendment of the Scot,
    Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs:
    For you shall reade, that my great Grandfather
    Neuer went with his forces into France,
    But that the Scot, on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,
    Came pouring like the Tyde into a breach,
    With ample and brim fulnesse of his force,
    Galling the gleaned Land with hot Assayes,
    Girding with grieuous siege, Castles and Townes:
    That England being emptie of defence,
    Hath shooke and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood

       B.Can. She hath bin the[n] more fear'd the[n] harm'd, my Liege:
    For heare her but exampl'd by her selfe,
    When all her Cheualrie hath been in France,
    And shee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles,
    Shee hath her selfe not onely well defended,
    But taken and impounded as a Stray,
    The King of Scots: whom shee did send to France,
    To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner Kings,
    And make their Chronicle as rich with prayse,
    As is the Owse and bottome of the Sea
    With sunken Wrack, and sum-lesse Treasuries

       Bish.Ely. But there's a saying very old and true,
    If that you will France win, then with Scotland first begin.
    For once the Eagle (England) being in prey,
    To her vnguarded Nest, the Weazell (Scot)
    Comes sneaking, and so sucks her Princely Egges,
    Playing the Mouse in absence of the Cat,
    To tame and hauocke more then she can eate

       Exet. It followes then, the Cat must stay at home,
    Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
    Since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries,
    And pretty traps to catch the petty theeues.
    While that the Armed hand doth fight abroad,
    Th' aduised head defends it selfe at home:
    For Gouernment, though high, and low, and lower,
    Put into parts, doth keepe in one consent,
    Congreeing in a full and natural close,
    Like Musicke

       Cant. Therefore doth heauen diuide
    The state of man in diuers functions,
    Setting endeuour in continual motion:
    To which is fixed as an ayme or butt,
    Obedience: for so worke the Hony Bees,
    Creatures that by a rule in Nature teach
    The Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome.
    They haue a King, and Officers of sorts,
    Where some like Magistrates correct at home:
    Others, like Merchants venter Trade abroad:
    Others, like Souldiers armed in their stings,
    Make boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes:
    Which pillage, they with merry march bring home
    To the Tent-royal of their Emperor:
    Who busied in his Maiesties surueyes
    The singing Masons building roofes of Gold,
    The ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony;
    The poore Mechanicke Porters, crowding in
    Their heauy burthens at his narrow gate:
    The sad-ey'd Iustice with his surly humme,
    Deliuering ore to Executors pale
    The lazie yawning Drone: I this inferre,
    That many things hauing full reference
    To one consent, may worke contrariously,
    As many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes
    Come to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne,
    As many fresh streames meet in one salt sea;
    As many Lynes close in the Dials center:
    So may a thousand actions once a foote,
    And in one purpose, and be all well borne
    Without defeat. Therefore to France, my Liege,
    Diuide your happy England into foure,
    Whereof, take you one quarter into France,
    And you withall shall make all Gallia shake.
    If we with thrice such powers left at home,
    Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge,
    Let vs be worried, and our Nation lose
    The name of hardinesse and policie

       King. Call in the Messengers sent from the Dolphin.
    Now are we well resolu'd, and by Gods helpe
    And yours, the noble sinewes of our power,
    France being ours, wee'l bend it to our Awe,
    Or breake it all to peeces. Or there wee'l sit,
    (Ruling in large and ample Emperie,
    Ore France, and all her (almost) Kingly Dukedomes)
    Or lay these bones in an vnworthy Vrne,
    Tomblesse, with no remembrance ouer them:
    Either our History shall with full mouth
    Speake freely of our Acts, or else our graue
    Like Turkish mute, shall haue a tonguelesse mouth,
    Not worshipt with a waxen Epitaph.
    Enter Ambassadors of France.

    Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
    Of our faire Cosin Dolphin: for we heare,
    Your greeting is from him, not from the King

       Amb. May't please your Maiestie to giue vs leaue
    Freely to render what we haue in charge:
    Or shall we sparingly shew you farre off
    The Dolphins meaning, and our Embassie

       King. We are no Tyrant, but a Christian King,
    Vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect
    As is our wretches fettred in our prisons,
    Therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse,
    Tell vs the Dolphins minde

       Amb. Thus than in few:
    Your Highnesse lately sending into France,
    Did claime some certaine Dukedomes, in the right
    Of your great Predecessor, King Edward the third.
    In answer of which claime, the Prince our Master
    Sayes, that you sauour too much of your youth,
    And bids you be aduis'd: There's nought in France,
    That can be with a nimble Galliard wonne:
    You cannot reuell into Dukedomes there.
    He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
    This Tun of Treasure; and in lieu of this,
    Desires you let the dukedomes that you claime
    Heare no more of you. This the Dolphin speakes

       King. What Treasure Vncle?
      Exe. Tennis balles, my Liege

       Kin. We are glad the Dolphin is so pleasant with vs,
    His Present, and your paines we thanke you for:
    When we haue matcht our Rackets to these Balles,
    We will in France (by Gods grace) play a set,
    Shall strike his fathers Crowne into the hazard.
    Tell him, he hath made a match with such a Wrangler,
    That all the Courts of France will be disturb'd
    With Chaces. And we vnderstand him well,
    How he comes o're vs with our wilder dayes,
    Not measuring what vse we made of them.
    We neuer valew'd this poore seate of England,
    And therefore liuing hence, did giue our selfe
    To barbarous license: As 'tis euer common,
    That men are merriest, when they are from home.
    But tell the Dolphin, I will keepe my State,
    Be like a King, and shew my sayle of Greatnesse,
    When I do rowse me in my Throne of France.
    For that I haue layd by my Maiestie,
    And plodded like a man for working dayes:
    But I will rise there with so full a glorie,
    That I will dazle all the eyes of France,
    Yea strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,
    And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his
    Hath turn'd his balles to Gun-stones, and his soule
    Shall stand sore charged, for the wastefull vengeance
    That shall flye with them: for many a thousand widows
    Shall this his Mocke, mocke out of their deer husbands;
    Mocke mothers from their sonnes, mock Castles downe:
    And some are yet vngotten and vnborne,
    That shal haue cause to curse the Dolphins scorne.
    But this lyes all within the wil of God,
    To whom I do appeale, and in whose name
    Tel you the Dolphin, I am comming on,
    To venge me as I may, and to put forth
    My rightfull hand in a wel-hallow'd cause.
    So get you hence in peace: And tell the Dolphin,
    His Iest will sauour but of shallow wit,
    When thousands weepe more then did laugh at it.
    Conuey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.

    Exeunt. Ambassadors.

      Exe. This was a merry Message

       King. We hope to make the Sender blush at it:
    Therefore, my Lords, omit no happy howre,
    That may giue furth'rance to our Expedition:
    For we haue now no thought in vs but France,
    Saue those to God, that runne before our businesse.
    Therefore let our proportions for these Warres
    Be soone collected, and all things thought vpon,
    That may with reasonable swiftnesse adde
    More Feathers to our Wings: for God before,
    Wee'le chide this Dolphin at his fathers doore.
    Therefore let euery man now taske his thought,
    That this faire Action may on foot be brought.

    Exeunt.

    Flourish. Enter Chorus.

    Now all the Youth of England are on fire,
    And silken Dalliance in the Wardrobe lyes:
    Now thriue the Armorers, and Honors thought
    Reignes solely in the breast of euery man.
    They sell the Pasture now, to buy the Horse;
    Following the Mirror of all Christian Kings,
    With winged heeles, as English Mercuries.
    For now sits Expectation in the Ayre,
    And hides a Sword, from Hilts vnto the Point,
    With Crownes Imperiall, Crownes and Coronets,
    Promis'd to Harry, and his followers.
    The French aduis'd by good intelligence
    Of this most dreadfull preparation,
    Shake in their feare, and with pale Pollicy
    Seeke to diuert the English purposes.
    O England: Modell to thy inward Greatnesse,
    Like little Body with a mightie Heart:
    What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
    Were all thy children kinde and naturall:
    But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out,
    A nest of hollow bosomes, which he filles
    With treacherous Crownes, and three corrupted men:
    One, Richard Earle of Cambridge, and the second
    Henry Lord Scroope of Masham, and the third
    Sir Thomas Grey Knight of Northumberland,
    Haue for the Gilt of France (O guilt indeed)
    Confirm'd Conspiracy with fearefull France,
    And by their hands, this grace of Kings must dye.
    If Hell and Treason hold their promises,
    Ere he take ship for France; and in Southampton.
    Linger your patience on, and wee'l digest
    Th' abuse of distance; force a play:
    The summe is payde, the Traitors are agreed,
    The King is set from London, and the Scene
    Is now transported (Gentles) to Southampton,
    There is the Play-house now, there must you sit,
    And thence to France shall we conuey you safe,
    And bring you backe: Charming the narrow seas
    To giue you gentle Passe: for if we may,
    Wee'l not offend one stomacke with our Play.
    But till the King come forth, and not till then,
    Vnto Southampton do we shift our Scene.

    Enter Corporall Nym, and Lieutenant Bardolfe.

      Bar. Well met Corporall Nym

       Nym. Good morrow Lieutenant Bardolfe

       Bar. What, are Ancient Pistoll and you friends yet?
      Nym. For my part, I care not: I say little: but when
    time shall serue, there shall be smiles, but that shall be as
    it may. I dare not fight, but I will winke and holde out
    mine yron: it is a simple one, but what though? It will
    toste Cheese, and it will endure cold, as another mans
    sword will: and there's an end

       Bar. I will bestow a breakfast to make you friendes,
    and wee'l bee all three sworne brothers to France: Let't
    be so good Corporall Nym

       Nym. Faith, I will liue so long as I may, that's the certaine
    of it: and when I cannot liue any longer, I will doe
    as I may: That is my rest, that is the rendeuous of it

       Bar. It is certaine Corporall, that he is marryed to
    Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you
    were troth-plight to her

       Nym. I cannot tell, Things must be as they may: men
    may sleepe, and they may haue their throats about them
    at that time, and some say, kniues haue edges: It must
    be as it may, though patience be a tyred name, yet shee
    will plodde, there must be Conclusions, well, I cannot
    tell.
    Enter Pistoll, & Quickly.

      Bar. Heere comes Ancient Pistoll and his wife: good
    Corporall be patient heere. How now mine Hoaste Pistoll?
      Pist. Base Tyke, cal'st thou mee Hoste, now by this
    hand I sweare I scorne the terme: nor shall my Nel keep
    Lodgers

       Host. No by my troth, not long: For we cannot lodge
    and board a dozen or fourteene Gentlewomen that liue
    honestly by the pricke of their Needles, but it will bee
    thought we keepe a Bawdy-house straight. O welliday
    Lady, if he be not hewne now, we shall see wilful adultery
    and murther committed

       Bar. Good Lieutenant, good Corporal offer nothing
    heere

       Nym. Pish

       Pist. Pish for thee, Island dogge: thou prickeard cur
    of Island

       Host. Good Corporall Nym shew thy valor, and put
    vp your sword

       Nym. Will you shogge off? I would haue you solus

       Pist. Solus, egregious dog? O Viper vile; The solus
    in thy most meruailous face, the solus in thy teeth, and
    in thy throate, and in thy hatefull Lungs, yea in thy Maw
    perdy; and which is worse, within thy nastie mouth. I
    do retort the solus in thy bowels, for I can take, and Pistols
    cocke is vp, and flashing fire will follow

       Nym. I am not Barbason, you cannot coniure mee: I
    haue an humor to knocke you indifferently well: If you
    grow fowle with me Pistoll, I will scoure you with my
    Rapier, as I may, in fayre tearmes. If you would walke
    off, I would pricke your guts a little in good tearmes, as
    I may, and that's the humor of it

       Pist. O Braggard vile, and damned furious wight,
    The Graue doth gape, and doting death is neere,
    Therefore exhale

       Bar. Heare me, heare me what I say: Hee that strikes
    the first stroake, Ile run him vp to the hilts, as I am a soldier

       Pist. An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
    Giue me thy fist, thy fore-foote to me giue: Thy spirites
    are most tall

       Nym. I will cut thy throate one time or other in faire
    termes, that is the humor of it

       Pistoll. Couple a gorge, that is the word. I defie thee againe.
    O hound of Creet, think'st thou my spouse to get?
    No, to the spittle goe, and from the Poudring tub of infamy,
    fetch forth the Lazar Kite of Cressids kinde, Doll
    Teare-sheete, she by name, and her espouse. I haue, and I
    will hold the Quondam Quickely for the onely shee: and
    Pauca, there's enough to go to.
    Enter the Boy.

      Boy. Mine Hoast Pistoll, you must come to my Mayster,
    and your Hostesse: He is very sicke, & would to bed.
    Good Bardolfe, put thy face betweene his sheets, and do
    the Office of a Warming-pan: Faith, he's very ill

       Bard. Away you Rogue

       Host. By my troth he'l yeeld the Crow a pudding one
    of these dayes: the King has kild his heart. Good Husband
    come home presently.

    Exit

      Bar. Come, shall I make you two friends. Wee must
    to France together: why the diuel should we keep kniues
    to cut one anothers throats?
      Pist. Let floods ore-swell, and fiends for food howle
    on

       Nym. You'l pay me the eight shillings I won of you
    at Betting?
      Pist. Base is the Slaue that payes

       Nym. That now I wil haue: that's the humor of it

       Pist. As manhood shal compound: push home.

    Draw

      Bard. By this sword, hee that makes the first thrust,
    Ile kill him: By this sword, I wil

       Pi. Sword is an Oath, & Oaths must haue their course
      Bar. Coporall Nym, & thou wilt be friends be frends,
    and thou wilt not, why then be enemies with me to: prethee
    put vp

       Pist. A Noble shalt thou haue, and present pay, and
    Liquor likewise will I giue to thee, and friendshippe
    shall combyne, and brotherhood. Ile liue by Nymme, &
    Nymme shall liue by me, is not this iust? For I shal Sutler
    be vnto the Campe, and profits will accrue. Giue mee
    thy hand

       Nym. I shall haue my Noble?
      Pist. In cash, most iustly payd

       Nym. Well, then that the humor of't.
    Enter Hostesse.

      Host. As euer you come of women, come in quickly
    to sir Iohn: A poore heart, hee is so shak'd of a burning
    quotidian Tertian, that it is most lamentable to behold.
    Sweet men, come to him

       Nym. The King hath run bad humors on the Knight,
    that's the euen of it

       Pist. Nym, thou hast spoke the right, his heart is fracted
    and corroborate

       Nym. The King is a good King, but it must bee as it
    may: he passes some humors, and carreeres

       Pist. Let vs condole the Knight, for (Lambekins) we
    will liue.
    Enter Exeter, Bedford, & Westmerland.

      Bed. Fore God his Grace is bold to trust these traitors
      Exe. They shall be apprehended by and by

       West. How smooth and euen they do bear themselues,
    As if allegeance in their bosomes sate
    Crowned with faith, and constant loyalty

       Bed. The King hath note of all that they intend,
    By interception, which they dreame not of

       Exe. Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
    Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious fauours;
    That he should for a forraigne purse, so sell
    His Soueraignes life to death and treachery.

    Sound Trumpets.

    Enter the King, Scroope, Cambridge, and Gray.

      King. Now sits the winde faire, and we will aboord.
    My Lord of Cambridge, and my kinde Lord of Masham,
    And you my gentle Knight, giue me your thoughts:
    Thinke you not that the powres we beare with vs
    Will cut their passage through the force of France?
    Doing the execution, and the acte,
    For which we haue in head assembled them

       Scro. No doubt my Liege, if each man do his best

       King. I doubt not that, since we are well perswaded
    We carry not a heart with vs from hence,
    That growes not in a faire consent with ours:
    Nor leaue not one behinde, that doth not wish
    Successe and Conquest to attend on vs

       Cam. Neuer was Monarch better fear'd and lou'd,
    Then is your Maiesty; there's not I thinke a subiect
    That sits in heart-greefe and vneasinesse
    Vnder the sweet shade of your gouernment

       Kni. True: those that were your Fathers enemies,
    Haue steep'd their gauls in hony, and do serue you
    With hearts create of duty, and of zeale

       King. We therefore haue great cause of thankfulnes,
    And shall forget the office of our hand
    Sooner then quittance of desert and merit,
    According to the weight and worthinesse

       Scro. So seruice shall with steeled sinewes toyle,
    And labour shall refresh it selfe with hope
    To do your Grace incessant seruices

       King. We Iudge no lesse. Vnkle of Exeter,
    Inlarge the man committed yesterday,
    That rayl'd against our person: We consider
    It was excesse of Wine that set him on,
    And on his more aduice, We pardon him

       Scro. That's mercy, but too much security:
    Let him be punish'd Soueraigne, least example
    Breed (by his sufferance) more of such a kind

       King. O let vs yet be mercifull

       Cam. So may your Highnesse, and yet punish too

       Grey. Sir, you shew great mercy if you giue him life,
    After the taste of much correction

       King. Alas, your too much loue and care of me,
    Are heauy Orisons 'gainst this poore wretch:
    If little faults proceeding on distemper,
    Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
    When capitall crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,
    Appeare before vs? Wee'l yet inlarge that man,
    Though Cambridge, Scroope, and Gray, in their deere care
    And tender preseruation of our person
    Wold haue him punish'd. And now to our French causes,
    Who are the late Commissioners?
      Cam. I one my Lord,
    Your Highnesse bad me aske for it to day

       Scro. So did you me my Liege

       Gray. And I my Royall Soueraigne

       King. Then Richard Earle of Cambridge, there is yours:
    There yours Lord Scroope of Masham, and Sir Knight:
    Gray of Northumberland, this same is yours:
    Reade them, and know I know your worthinesse.
    My Lord of Westmerland, and Vnkle Exeter,
    We will aboord to night. Why how now Gentlemen?
    What see you in those papers, that you loose
    So much complexion? Looke ye how they change:
    Their cheekes are paper. Why, what reade you there,
    That haue so cowarded and chac'd your blood
    Out of apparance

       Cam. I do confesse my fault,
    And do submit me to your Highnesse mercy

       Gray. Scro. To which we all appeale

       King. The mercy that was quicke in vs but late,
    By your owne counsaile is supprest and kill'd:
    You must not dare (for shame) to talke of mercy,
    For your owne reasons turne into your bosomes,
    As dogs vpon their maisters, worrying you:
    See you my Princes, and my Noble Peeres,
    These English monsters: My Lord of Cambridge heere,
    You know how apt our loue was, to accord
    To furnish with all appertinents
    Belonging to his Honour; and this man,
    Hath for a few light Crownes, lightly conspir'd
    And sworne vnto the practises of France
    To kill vs heere in Hampton. To the which,
    This Knight no lesse for bounty bound to Vs
    Then Cambridge is, hath likewise sworne. But O,
    What shall I say to thee Lord Scroope, thou cruell,
    Ingratefull, sauage, and inhumane Creature?
    Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes,
    That knew'st the very bottome of my soule,
    That (almost) might'st haue coyn'd me into Golde,
    Would'st thou haue practis'd on me, for thy vse?
    May it be possible, that forraigne hyer
    Could out of thee extract one sparke of euill
    That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange,
    That though the truth of it stands off as grosse
    As black and white, my eye will scarsely see it.
    Treason, and murther, euer kept together,
    As two yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose,
    Working so grossely in an naturall cause,
    That admiration did not hoope at them.
    But thou (gainst all proportion) didst bring in
    Wonder to waite on treason, and on murther:
    And whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was
    That wrought vpon thee so preposterously,
    Hath got the voyce in hell for excellence:
    And other diuels that suggest by treasons,
    Do botch and bungle vp damnation,
    With patches, colours, and with formes being fetcht
    From glist'ring semblances of piety:
    But he that temper'd thee, bad thee stand vp,
    Gaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
    Vnlesse to dub thee with the name of Traitor.
    If that same Daemon that hath gull'd thee thus,
    Should with his Lyon-gate walke the whole world,
    He might returne to vastie Tartar backe,
    And tell the Legions, I can neuer win
    A soule so easie as that Englishmans.
    Oh, how hast thou with iealousie infected
    The sweetnesse of affiance? Shew men dutifull,
    Why so didst thou: seeme they graue and learned?
    Why so didst thou. Come they of Noble Family?
    Why so didst thou. Seeme they religious?
    Why so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,
    Free from grosse passion, or of mirth, or anger,
    Constant in spirit, not sweruing with the blood,
    Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
    Not working with the eye, without the eare,
    And but in purged iudgement trusting neither,
    Such and so finely boulted didst thou seeme:
    And thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot,
    To make thee full fraught man, and best indued
    With some suspition, I will weepe for thee.
    For this reuolt of thine, me thinkes is like
    Another fall of Man. Their faults are open,
    Arrest them to the answer of the Law,
    And God acquit them of their practises

       Exe. I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of
    Richard Earle of Cambridge.
    I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas
    Lord Scroope of Marsham.
    I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas
    Grey, Knight of Northumberland

       Scro. Our purposes, God iustly hath discouer'd,
    And I repent my fault more then my death,
    Which I beseech your Highnesse to forgiue,
    Although my body pay the price of it

       Cam. For me, the Gold of France did not seduce,
    Although I did admit it as a motiue,
    The sooner to effect what I intended:
    But God be thanked for preuention,
    Which in sufferance heartily will reioyce,
    Beseeching God, and you, to pardon mee

       Gray. Neuer did faithfull subiect more reioyce
    At the discouery of most dangerous Treason,
    Then I do at this houre ioy ore my selfe,
    Preuented from a damned enterprize;
    My fault, but not my body, pardon Soueraigne

       King. God quit you in his mercy: Hear your sentence
    You haue conspir'd against Our Royall person,
    Ioyn'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his Coffers,
    Receyu'd the Golden Earnest of Our death:
    Wherein you would haue sold your King to slaughter,
    His Princes, and his Peeres to seruitude,
    His Subiects to oppression, and contempt,
    And his whole Kingdome into desolation:
    Touching our person, seeke we no reuenge,
    But we our Kingdomes safety must so tender,
    Whose ruine you sought, that to her Lawes
    We do deliuer you. Get you therefore hence,
    (Poore miserable wretches) to your death:
    The taste whereof, God of his mercy giue
    You patience to indure, and true Repentance
    Of all your deare offences. Beare them hence.
    Enter.

    Now Lords for France: the enterprise whereof
    Shall be to you as vs, like glorious.
    We doubt not of a faire and luckie Warre,
    Since God so graciously hath brought to light
    This dangerous Treason, lurking in our way,
    To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now,
    But euery Rubbe is smoothed on our way.
    Then forth, deare Countreymen: Let vs deliuer
    Our Puissance into the hand of God,
    Putting it straight in expedition.
    Chearely to Sea, the signes of Warre aduance,
    No King of England, if not King of France.

    Flourish.

    Enter Pistoll, Nim, Bardolph, Boy, and Hostesse.

      Hostesse. 'Prythee honey sweet Husband, let me bring
    thee to Staines

       Pistoll. No: for my manly heart doth erne. Bardolph,
    be blythe: Nim, rowse thy vaunting Veines: Boy, brissle
    thy Courage vp: for Falstaffe hee is dead, and wee must
    erne therefore

       Bard. Would I were with him, wheresomere hee is,
    eyther in Heauen, or in Hell

       Hostesse. Nay sure, hee's not in Hell: hee's in Arthurs
    Bosome, if euer man went to Arthurs Bosome: a made a
    finer end, and went away and it had beene any Christome
    Childe: a parted eu'n iust betweene Twelue and One, eu'n
    at the turning o'th' Tyde: for after I saw him fumble with
    the Sheets, and play with Flowers, and smile vpon his fingers
    end, I knew there was but one way: for his Nose was
    as sharpe as a Pen, and a Table of greene fields. How now
    Sir Iohn (quoth I?) what man? be a good cheare: so a
    cryed out, God, God, God, three or foure times: now I,
    to comfort him, bid him a should not thinke of God; I
    hop'd there was no neede to trouble himselfe with any
    such thoughts yet: so a bad me lay more Clothes on his
    feet: I put my hand into the Bed, and felt them, and they
    were as cold as any stone: then I felt to his knees, and so
    vp-peer'd, and vpward, and all was as cold as any stone

       Nim. They say he cryed out of Sack

       Hostesse. I, that a did

       Bard. And of Women

       Hostesse. Nay, that a did not

       Boy. Yes that a did, and said they were Deules incarnate

       Woman. A could neuer abide Carnation, 'twas a Colour
    he neuer lik'd

       Boy. A said once, the Deule would haue him about
    Women

       Hostesse. A did in some sort (indeed) handle Women:
    but then hee was rumatique, and talk'd of the Whore of
    Babylon

       Boy. Doe you not remember a saw a Flea sticke vpon
    Bardolphs Nose, and a said it was a blacke Soule burning
    in Hell

       Bard. Well, the fuell is gone that maintain'd that fire:
    that's all the Riches I got in his seruice

       Nim. Shall wee shogg? the King will be gone from
    Southampton

       Pist. Come, let's away. My Loue, giue me thy Lippes:
    Looke to my Chattels, and my Moueables: Let Sences
    rule: The world is, Pitch and pay: trust none: for Oathes
    are Strawes, mens Faiths are Wafer-Cakes, and hold-fast
    is the onely Dogge: My Ducke, therefore Caueto bee
    thy Counsailor. Goe, cleare thy Chrystalls. Yokefellowes
    in Armes, let vs to France, like Horseleeches
    my Boyes, to sucke, to sucke, the very blood to
    sucke

       Boy. And that's but vnwholesome food, they say

       Pist. Touch her soft mouth, and march

       Bard. Farwell Hostesse

       Nim. I cannot kisse, that is the humor of it: but
    adieu

       Pist. Let Huswiferie appeare: keepe close, I thee
    command

       Hostesse. Farwell: adieu.

    Exeunt.

    Flourish.

    Enter the French King, the Dolphin, the Dukes of Berry and
    Britaine.

      King. Thus comes the English with full power vpon vs,
    And more then carefully it vs concernes,
    To answer Royally in our defences.
    Therefore the Dukes of Berry and of Britaine,
    Of Brabant and of Orleance, shall make forth,
    And you Prince Dolphin, with all swift dispatch
    To lyne and new repayre our Townes of Warre
    With men of courage, and with meanes defendant:
    For England his approaches makes as fierce,
    As Waters to the sucking of a Gulfe.
    It fits vs then to be as prouident,
    As feare may teach vs, out of late examples
    Left by the fatall and neglected English,
    Vpon our fields

       Dolphin. My most redoubted Father,
    It is most meet we arme vs 'gainst the Foe:
    For Peace it selfe should not so dull a Kingdome,
    (Though War nor no knowne Quarrel were in question)
    But that Defences, Musters, Preparations,
    Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,
    As were a Warre in expectation.
    Therefore I say, 'tis meet we all goe forth,
    To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
    And let vs doe it with no shew of feare,
    No, with no more, then if we heard that England
    Were busied with a Whitson Morris-dance:
    For, my good Liege, shee is so idly King'd,
    Her Scepter so phantastically borne,
    By a vaine giddie shallow humorous Youth,
    That feare attends her not

       Const. O peace, Prince Dolphin,
    You are too much mistaken in this King:
    Question your Grace the late Embassadors,
    With what great State he heard their Embassie,
    How well supply'd with Noble Councellors,
    How modest in exception; and withall,
    How terrible in constant resolution:
    And you shall find, his Vanities fore-spent,
    Were but the out-side of the Roman Brutus,
    Couering Discretion with a Coat of Folly;
    As Gardeners doe with Ordure hide those Roots
    That shall first spring, and be most delicate

       Dolphin. Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
    But though we thinke it so, it is no matter:
    In cases of defence, 'tis best to weigh
    The Enemie more mightie then he seemes,
    So the proportions of defence are fill'd:
    Which of a weake and niggardly proiection,
    Doth like a Miser spoyle his Coat, with scanting
    A little Cloth

       King. Thinke we King Harry strong:
    And Princes, looke you strongly arme to meet him.
    The Kindred of him hath beene flesht vpon vs:
    And he is bred out of that bloodie straine,
    That haunted vs in our familiar Pathes:
    Witnesse our too much memorable shame,
    When Cressy Battell fatally was strucke,
    And all our Princes captiu'd, by the hand
    Of that black Name, Edward, black Prince of Wales:
    Whiles that his Mountaine Sire, on Mountaine standing
    Vp in the Ayre, crown'd with the Golden Sunne,
    Saw his Heroicall Seed, and smil'd to see him
    Mangle the Worke of Nature, and deface
    The Patternes, that by God and by French Fathers
    Had twentie yeeres been made. This is a Stem
    Of that Victorious Stock: and let vs feare
    The Natiue mightinesse and fate of him.
    Enter a Messenger.

      Mess. Embassadors from Harry King of England,
    Doe craue admittance to your Maiestie

       King. Weele giue them present audience.
    Goe, and bring them.
    You see this Chase is hotly followed, friends

       Dolphin. Turne head, and stop pursuit: for coward Dogs
    Most spend their mouths, whe[n] what they seem to threaten
    Runs farre before them. Good my Soueraigne
    Take vp the English short, and let them know
    Of what a Monarchie you are the Head:
    Selfe-loue, my Liege, is not so vile a sinne,
    As selfe-neglecting.
    Enter Exeter.

      King. From our Brother of England?
      Exe. From him, and thus he greets your Maiestie:
    He wills you in the Name of God Almightie,
    That you deuest your selfe, and lay apart
    The borrowed Glories, that by gift of Heauen,
    By Law of Nature, and of Nations, longs
    To him and to his Heires, namely, the Crowne,
    And all wide-stretched Honors, that pertaine
    By Custome, and the Ordinance of Times,
    Vnto the Crowne of France: that you may know
    'Tis no sinister, nor no awkward Clayme,
    Pickt from the worme-holes of long-vanisht dayes,
    Nor from the dust of old Obliuion rakt,
    He sends you this most memorable Lyne,
    In euery Branch truly demonstratiue;
    Willing you ouer-looke this Pedigree:
    And when you find him euenly deriu'd
    From his most fam'd, of famous Ancestors,
    Edward the third; he bids you then resigne
    Your Crowne and Kingdome, indirectly held
    From him, the Natiue and true Challenger

       King. Or else what followes?
      Exe. Bloody constraint: for if you hide the Crowne
    Euen in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
    Therefore in fierce Tempest is he comming,
    In Thunder and in Earth-quake, like a Ioue:
    That if requiring faile, he will compell.
    And bids you, in the Bowels of the Lord,
    Deliuer vp the Crowne, and to take mercie
    On the poore Soules, for whom this hungry Warre
    Opens his vastie Iawes: and on your head
    Turning the Widdowes Teares, the Orphans Cryes,
    The dead-mens Blood, the priuy Maidens Groanes,
    For Husbands, Fathers, and betrothed Louers,
    That shall be swallowed in this Controuersie.
    This is his Clayme, his Threatning, and my Message:
    Vnlesse the Dolphin be in presence here;
    To whom expressely I bring greeting to

       King. For vs, we will consider of this further:
    To morrow shall you beare our full intent
    Back to our Brother of England

       Dolph. For the Dolphin,
    I stand here for him: what to him from England?
      Exe. Scorne and defiance, sleight regard, contempt,
    And any thing that may not mis-become
    The mightie Sender, doth he prize you at.
    Thus sayes my King: and if your Fathers Highnesse
    Doe not, in graunt of all demands at large,
    Sweeten the bitter Mock you sent his Maiestie;
    Hee'le call you to so hot an Answer of it,
    That Caues and Wombie Vaultages of France
    Shall chide your Trespas, and returne your Mock
    In second Accent of his Ordinance

       Dolph. Say: if my Father render faire returne,
    It is against my will: for I desire
    Nothing but Oddes with England.
    To that end, as matching to his Youth and Vanitie,
    I did present him with the Paris-Balls

       Exe. Hee'le make your Paris Louer shake for it,
    Were it the Mistresse Court of mightie Europe:
    And be assur'd, you'le find a diff'rence,
    As we his Subiects haue in wonder found,
    Betweene the promise of his greener dayes,
    And these he masters now: now he weighes Time
    Euen to the vtmost Graine: that you shall reade
    In your owne Losses, if he stay in France

       King. To morrow shall you know our mind at full.

    Flourish.

      Exe. Dispatch vs with all speed, least that our King
    Come here himselfe to question our delay;
    For he is footed in this Land already

       King. You shalbe soone dispatcht, with faire conditions.
    A Night is but small breathe, and little pawse,
    To answer matters of this consequence.

    Exeunt.


    Actus Secundus.

    Flourish. Enter Chorus.

    Thus with imagin'd wing our swift Scene flyes,
    In motion of no lesse celeritie then that of Thought.
    Suppose, that you haue seene
    The well-appointed King at Douer Peer,
    Embarke his Royaltie: and his braue Fleet,
    With silken Streamers, the young Phebus fayning;
    Play with your Fancies: and in them behold,
    Vpon the Hempen Tackle, Ship-boyes climbing;
    Heare the shrill Whistle, which doth order giue
    To sounds confus'd: behold the threaden Sayles,
    Borne with th' inuisible and creeping Wind,
    Draw the huge Bottomes through the furrowed Sea,
    Bresting the loftie Surge. O, doe but thinke
    You stand vpon the Riuage, and behold
    A Citie on th' inconstant Billowes dauncing:
    For so appeares this Fleet Maiesticall,
    Holding due course to Harflew. Follow, follow:
    Grapple your minds to sternage of this Nauie,
    And leaue your England as dead Mid-night, still,
    Guarded with Grandsires, Babyes, and old Women,
    Eyther past, or not arriu'd to pyth and puissance:
    For who is he, whose Chin is but enricht
    With one appearing Hayre, that will not follow
    These cull'd and choyse-drawne Caualiers to France?
    Worke, worke your Thoughts, and therein see a Siege:
    Behold the Ordenance on their Carriages,
    With fatall mouthes gaping on girded Harflew.
    Suppose th' Embassador from the French comes back:
    Tells Harry, That the King doth offer him
    Katherine his Daughter, and with her to Dowrie,
    Some petty and vnprofitable Dukedomes.
    The offer likes not: and the nimble Gunner
    With Lynstock now the diuellish Cannon touches,

    Alarum, and Chambers goe off.

    And downe goes all before them. Still be kind,
    And eech out our performance with your mind.
    Enter.

    Enter the King, Exeter, Bedford, and Gloucester. Alarum: Scaling
    Ladders
    at Harflew.

      King. Once more vnto the Breach,
    Deare friends, once more;
    Or close the Wall vp with our English dead:
    In Peace, there's nothing so becomes a man,
    As modest stillnesse, and humilitie:
    But when the blast of Warre blowes in our eares,
    Then imitate the action of the Tyger:
    Stiffen the sinewes, commune vp the blood,
    Disguise faire Nature with hard-fauour'd Rage:
    Then lend the Eye a terrible aspect:
    Let it pry through the portage of the Head,
    Like the Brasse Cannon: let the Brow o'rewhelme it,
    As fearefully, as doth a galled Rocke
    O're-hang and iutty his confounded Base,
    Swill'd with the wild and wastfull Ocean.
    Now set the Teeth, and stretch the Nosthrill wide,
    Hold hard the Breath, and bend vp euery Spirit
    To his full height. On, on, you Noblish English,
    Whose blood is fet from Fathers of Warre-proofe:
    Fathers, that like so many Alexanders,
    Haue in these parts from Morne till Euen fought,
    And sheath'd their Swords, for lack of argument.
    Dishonour not your Mothers: now attest,
    That those whom you call'd Fathers, did beget you.
    Be Coppy now to men of grosser blood,
    And teach them how to Warre. And you good Yeomen,
    Whose Lyms were made in England; shew vs here
    The mettell of your Pasture: let vs sweare,
    That you are worth your breeding: which I doubt not:
    For there is none of you so meane and base,
    That hath not Noble luster in your eyes.
    I see you stand like Grey-hounds in the slips,
    Straying vpon the Start. The Game's afoot:
    Follow your Spirit; and vpon this Charge,
    Cry, God for Harry, England, and S[aint]. George.

    Alarum, and Chambers goe off.

    Enter Nim, Bardolph, Pistoll, and Boy.

      Bard. On, on, on, on, on, to the breach, to the breach

       Nim. 'Pray thee Corporall stay, the Knocks are too
    hot: and for mine owne part, I haue not a Case of Liues:
    the humor of it is too hot, that is the very plaine-Song
    of it

       Pist. The plaine-Song is most iust: for humors doe abound:
    Knocks goe and come: Gods Vassals drop and
    dye: and Sword and Shield, in bloody Field, doth winne
    immortall fame

       Boy. Would I were in a Ale-house in London, I
    would giue all my fame for a Pot of Ale, and safetie

       Pist. And I: If wishes would preuayle with me, my
    purpose should not fayle with me; but thither would I
    high

       Boy. As duly, but not as truly, as Bird doth sing on
    bough.
    Enter Fluellen.

      Flu. Vp to the breach, you Dogges; auaunt you
    Cullions

       Pist. Be mercifull great Duke to men of Mould: abate
    thy Rage, abate thy manly Rage; abate thy Rage,
    great Duke. Good Bawcock bate thy Rage: vse lenitie
    sweet Chuck

       Nim. These be good humors: your Honor wins bad
    humors.
    Enter.

      Boy. As young as I am, I haue obseru'd these three
    Swashers: I am Boy to them all three, but all they three,
    though they would serue me, could not be Man to me;
    for indeed three such Antiques doe not amount to a man:
    for Bardolph, hee is white-liuer'd, and red-fac'd; by the
    meanes whereof, a faces it out, but fights not: for Pistoll,
    hee hath a killing Tongue, and a quiet Sword; by the
    meanes whereof, a breakes Words, and keepes whole
    Weapons: for Nim, hee hath heard, that men of few
    Words are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say
    his Prayers, lest a should be thought a Coward: but his
    few bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for
    a neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was
    against a Post, when he was drunke. They will steale any
    thing, and call it Purchase. Bardolph stole a Lute-case,
    bore it twelue Leagues, and sold it for three halfepence.
    Nim and Bardolph are sworne Brothers in filching: and
    in Callice they stole a fire-shouell. I knew by that peece
    of Seruice, the men would carry Coales. They would
    haue me as familiar with mens Pockets, as their Gloues
    or their Hand-kerchers: which makes much against my
    Manhood, if I should take from anothers Pocket, to put
    into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of Wrongs.
    I must leaue them, and seeke some better Seruice: their
    Villany goes against my weake stomacke, and therefore
    I must cast it vp.
    Enter.

    Enter Gower.

      Gower. Captaine Fluellen, you must come presently to
    the Mynes; the Duke of Gloucester would speake with
    you

       Flu. To the Mynes? Tell you the Duke, it is not so
    good to come to the Mynes: for looke you, the Mynes
    is not according to the disciplines of the Warre; the concauities
    of it is not sufficient: for looke you, th' athuersarie,
    you may discusse vnto the Duke, looke you, is digt
    himselfe foure yard vnder the Countermines: by Cheshu,
    I thinke a will plowe vp all, if there is not better directions

       Gower. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the Order
    of the Siege is giuen, is altogether directed by an Irish
    man, a very valiant Gentleman yfaith

       Welch. It is Captaine Makmorrice, is it not?
      Gower. I thinke it be

       Welch. By Cheshu he is an Asse, as in the World, I will
    verifie as much in his Beard: he ha's no more directions
    in the true disciplines of the Warres, looke you, of the
    Roman disciplines, then is a Puppy-dog.
    Enter Makmorrice, and Captaine Iamy.

      Gower. Here a comes, and the Scots Captaine, Captaine
    Iamy, with him

       Welch. Captaine Iamy is a maruellous falorous Gentleman,
    that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge
    in th' aunchiant Warres, vpon my particular knowledge
    of his directions: by Cheshu he will maintaine his
    Argument as well as any Militarie man in the World, in
    the disciplines of the Pristine Warres of the Romans

       Scot. I say gudday, Captaine Fluellen

       Welch. Godden to your Worship, good Captaine
    Iames

       Gower. How now Captaine Mackmorrice, haue you
    quit the Mynes? haue the Pioners giuen o're?
      Irish. By Chrish Law tish ill done: the Worke ish
    giue ouer, the Trompet sound the Retreat. By my Hand
    I sweare, and my fathers Soule, the Worke ish ill done:
    it ish giue ouer: I would haue blowed vp the Towne,
    so Chrish saue me law, in an houre. O tish ill done, tish ill
    done: by my Hand tish ill done

       Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I beseech you now,
    will you voutsafe me, looke you, a few disputations with
    you, as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of
    the Warre, the Roman Warres, in the way of Argument,
    looke you, and friendly communication: partly to satisfie
    my Opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, looke you, of
    my Mind: as touching the direction of the Militarie discipline,
    that is the Point

       Scot. It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud Captens bath,
    and I sall quit you with gud leue, as I may pick occasion:
    that sall I mary

       Irish. It is no time to discourse, so Chrish saue me:
    the day is hot, and the Weather, and the Warres, and the
    King, and the Dukes: it is no time to discourse, the Town
    is beseech'd: and the Trumpet call vs to the breech, and
    we talke, and be Chrish do nothing, tis shame for vs all:
    so God sa'me tis shame to stand still, it is shame by my
    hand: and there is Throats to be cut, and Workes to be
    done, and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa'me law

       Scot. By the Mes, ere theise eyes of mine take themselues
    to slomber, ayle de gud seruice, or Ile ligge i'th'
    grund for it; ay, or goe to death: and Ile pay't as valorously
    as I may, that sal I suerly do, that is the breff and
    the long: mary, I wad full faine heard some question
    tween you tway

       Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I thinke, looke you,
    vnder your correction, there is not many of your Nation

       Irish. Of my Nation? What ish my Nation? Ish a
    Villaine, and a Basterd, and a Knaue, and a Rascall. What
    ish my Nation? Who talkes of my Nation?
      Welch. Looke you, if you take the matter otherwise
    then is meant, Captaine Mackmorrice, peraduenture I
    shall thinke you doe not vse me with that affabilitie, as in
    discretion you ought to vse me, looke you, being as good
    a man as your selfe, both in the disciplines of Warre, and
    in the deriuation of my Birth, and in other particularities

       Irish. I doe not know you so good a man as my selfe:
    so Chrish saue me, I will cut off your Head

       Gower. Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other

       Scot. A, that's a foule fault.

    A Parley.

      Gower. The Towne sounds a Parley

       Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, when there is more
    better oportunitie to be required, looke you, I will be
    so bold as to tell you, I know the disciplines of Warre:
    and there is an end.
    Enter.

    Enter the King and all his Traine before the Gates.

      King. How yet resolues the Gouernour of the Towne?
    This is the latest Parle we will admit:
    Therefore to our best mercy giue your selues,
    Or like to men prowd of destruction,
    Defie vs to our worst: for as I am a Souldier,
    A Name that in my thoughts becomes me best;
    If I begin the batt'rie once againe,
    I will not leaue the halfe-atchieued Harflew,
    Till in her ashes she lye buryed.
    The Gates of Mercy shall be all shut vp,
    And the flesh'd Souldier, rough and hard of heart,
    In libertie of bloody hand, shall raunge
    With Conscience wide as Hell, mowing like Grasse
    Your fresh faire Virgins, and your flowring Infants.
    What is it then to me, if impious Warre,
    Arrayed in flames like to the Prince of Fiends,
    Doe with his smyrcht complexion all fell feats,
    Enlynckt to wast and desolation?
    What is't to me, when you your selues are cause,
    If your pure Maydens fall into the hand
    Of hot and forcing Violation?
    What Reyne can hold licentious Wickednesse,
    When downe the Hill he holds his fierce Carriere?
    We may as bootlesse spend our vaine Command
    Vpon th' enraged Souldiers in their spoyle,
    As send Precepts to the Leuiathan, to come ashore.
    Therefore, you men of Harflew,
    Take pitty of your Towne and of your People,
    Whiles yet my Souldiers are in my Command,
    Whiles yet the coole and temperate Wind of Grace
    O're-blowes the filthy and contagious Clouds
    Of heady Murther, Spoyle, and Villany.
    If not: why in a moment looke to see
    The blind and bloody Souldier, with foule hand
    Desire the Locks of your shrill-shriking Daughters:
    Your Fathers taken by the siluer Beards,
    And their most reuerend Heads dasht to the Walls:
    Your naked Infants spitted vpon Pykes,
    Whiles the mad Mothers, with their howles confus'd,
    Doe breake the Clouds; as did the Wiues of Iewry,
    At Herods bloody-hunting slaughter-men.
    What say you? Will you yeeld, and this auoyd?
    Or guiltie in defence, be thus destroy'd.
    Enter Gouernour.

      Gouer. Our expectation hath this day an end:
    The Dolphin, whom of Succours we entreated,
    Returnes vs, that his Powers are yet not ready,
    To rayse so great a Siege: Therefore great King,
    We yeeld our Towne and Liues to thy soft Mercy:
    Enter our Gates, dispose of vs and ours,
    For we no longer are defensible

       King. Open your Gates: Come Vnckle Exeter,
    Goe you and enter Harflew; there remaine,
    And fortifie it strongly 'gainst the French:
    Vse mercy to them all for vs, deare Vnckle.
    The Winter comming on, and Sicknesse growing
    Vpon our Souldiers, we will retyre to Calis.
    To night in Harflew will we be your Guest,
    To morrow for the March are we addrest.

    Enter.

    Enter the King of France, the Dolphin, the Constable of France,
    and
    others.

      King. 'Tis certaine he hath past the Riuer Some

       Const. And if he be not fought withall, my Lord,
    Let vs not liue in France: let vs quit all,
    And giue our Vineyards to a barbarous People

       Dolph. O Dieu viuant: Shall a few Sprayes of vs,
    The emptying of our Fathers Luxurie,
    Our Syens, put in wilde and sauage Stock,
    Spirt vp so suddenly into the Clouds,
    And ouer-looke their Grafters?
      Brit. Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards:
    Mort du ma vie, if they march along
    Vnfought withall, but I will sell my Dukedome,
    To buy a slobbry and a durtie Farme
    In that nooke-shotten Ile of Albion

       Const. Dieu de Battailes, where haue they this mettell?
    Is not their Clymate foggy, raw, and dull?
    On whom, as in despight, the Sunne lookes pale,
    Killing their Fruit with frownes. Can sodden Water,
    A Drench for sur-reyn'd Iades, their Barly broth,
    Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
    And shall our quick blood, spirited with Wine,
    Seeme frostie? O, for honor of our Land,
    Let vs not hang like roping Isyckles
    Vpon our Houses Thatch, whiles a more frostie People
    Sweat drops of gallant Youth in our rich fields:
    Poore we call them, in their Natiue Lords

       Dolphin. By Faith and Honor,
    Our Madames mock at vs, and plainely say,
    Our Mettell is bred out, and they will giue
    Their bodyes to the Lust of English Youth,
    To new-store France with Bastard Warriors

       Brit. They bid vs to the English Dancing-Schooles,
    And teach Lauolta's high, and swift Carranto's,
    Saying, our Grace is onely in our Heeles,
    And that we are most loftie Run-awayes

       King. Where is Montioy the Herald? speed him hence,
    Let him greet England with our sharpe defiance.
    Vp Princes, and with spirit of Honor edged,
    More sharper then your Swords, high to the field:
    Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France,
    You Dukes of Orleance, Burbon, and of Berry,
    Alanson, Brabant, Bar, and Burgonie,
    Iaques Chattillion, Rambures, Vandemont,
    Beumont, Grand Pree, Roussi, and Faulconbridge,
    Loys, Lestrale, Bouciquall, and Charaloyes,
    High Dukes, great Princes, Barons, Lords, and Kings;
    For your great Seats, now quit you of great shames:
    Barre Harry England, that sweepes through our Land
    With Penons painted in the blood of Harflew:
    Rush on his Hoast, as doth the melted Snow
    Vpon the Valleyes, whose low Vassall Seat,
    The Alpes doth spit, and void his rhewme vpon.
    Goe downe vpon him, you haue Power enough,
    And in a Captiue Chariot, into Roan
    Bring him our Prisoner

       Const. This becomes the Great.
    Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
    His Souldiers sick, and famisht in their March:
    For I am sure, when he shall see our Army,
    Hee'le drop his heart into the sinck of feare,
    And for atchieuement, offer vs his Ransome

       King. Therefore Lord Constable, hast on Montioy,
    And let him say to England, that we send,
    To know what willing Ransome he will giue.
    Prince Dolphin, you shall stay with vs in Roan

       Dolph. Not so, I doe beseech your Maiestie

       King. Be patient, for you shall remaine with vs.
    Now forth Lord Constable, and Princes all,
    And quickly bring vs word of Englands fall.

    Exeunt.

    Enter Captaines, English and Welch, Gower and Fluellen.

      Gower. How now Captaine Fluellen, come you from
    the Bridge?
      Flu. I assure you, there is very excellent Seruices committed
    at the Bridge

       Gower. Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
      Flu. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,
    and a man that I loue and honour with my soule,
    and my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing,
    and my vttermost power. He is not, God be praysed and
    blessed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge
    most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient
    Lieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very
    conscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony, and
    hee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did see
    him doe as gallant seruice

       Gower. What doe you call him?
      Flu. Hee is call'd aunchient Pistoll

       Gower. I know him not.
    Enter Pistoll.

      Flu. Here is the man

       Pist. Captaine, I thee beseech to doe me fauours: the
    Duke of Exeter doth loue thee well

       Flu. I, I prayse God, and I haue merited some loue at
    his hands

       Pist. Bardolph, a Souldier firme and sound of heart,
    and of buxome valour, hath by cruell Fate, and giddie
    Fortunes furious fickle Wheele, that Goddesse blind, that
    stands vpon the rolling restlesse Stone

       Flu. By your patience, aunchient Pistoll: Fortune is
    painted blinde, with a Muffler afore his eyes, to signifie
    to you, that Fortune is blinde; and shee is painted also
    with a Wheele, to signifie to you, which is the Morall of
    it, that shee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie,
    and variation: and her foot, looke you, is fixed vpon a
    Sphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles:
    in good truth, the Poet makes a most excellent description
    of it: Fortune is an excellent Morall

       Pist. Fortune is Bardolphs foe, and frownes on him:
    for he hath stolne a Pax, and hanged must a be: a damned
    death: let Gallowes gape for Dogge, let Man goe free,
    and let not Hempe his Wind-pipe suffocate: but Exeter
    hath giuen the doome of death, for Pax of little price.
    Therefore goe speake, the Duke will heare thy voyce;
    and let not Bardolphs vitall thred bee cut with edge of
    Penny-Cord, and vile reproach. Speake Captaine for
    his Life, and I will thee requite

       Flu. Aunchient Pistoll, I doe partly vnderstand your
    meaning

       Pist. Why then reioyce therefore

       Flu. Certainly Aunchient, it is not a thing to reioyce
    at: for if, looke you, he were my Brother, I would desire
    the Duke to vse his good pleasure, and put him to execution;
    for discipline ought to be vsed

       Pist. Dye, and be dam'd, and Figo for thy friendship

       Flu. It is well

       Pist. The Figge of Spaine.
    Enter.

      Flu. Very good

       Gower. Why, this is an arrant counterfeit Rascall, I
    remember him now: a Bawd, a Cut-purse

       Flu. Ile assure you, a vtt'red as praue words at the
    Pridge, as you shall see in a Summers day: but it is very
    well: what he ha's spoke to me, that is well I warrant you,
    when time is serue

       Gower. Why 'tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and
    then goes to the Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne
    into London, vnder the forme of a Souldier: and such
    fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names, and
    they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done;
    at such and such a Sconce, at such a Breach, at such a Conuoy:
    who came off brauely, who was shot, who disgrac'd,
    what termes the Enemy stood on: and this they
    conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they tricke
    vp with new-tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Generalls
    Cut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe among
    foming Bottles, and Ale-washt Wits, is wonderfull
    to be thought on: but you must learne to know such
    slanders of the age, or else you may be maruellously mistooke

       Flu. I tell you what, Captaine Gower: I doe perceiue
    hee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to
    the World hee is: if I finde a hole in his Coat, I will tell
    him my minde: hearke you, the King is comming, and I
    must speake with him from the Pridge.

    Drum and Colours. Enter the King and his poore Souldiers.

      Flu. God plesse your Maiestie

       King. How now Fluellen, cam'st thou from the Bridge?
      Flu. I, so please your Maiestie: The Duke of Exeter
    ha's very gallantly maintain'd the Pridge; the French is
    gone off, looke you, and there is gallant and most praue
    passages: marry, th' athuersarie was haue possession of
    the Pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the Duke of
    Exeter is Master of the Pridge: I can tell your Maiestie,
    the Duke is a praue man

       King. What men haue you lost, Fluellen?
      Flu. The perdition of th' athuersarie hath beene very
    great, reasonnable great: marry for my part, I thinke the
    Duke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be executed
    for robbing a Church, one Bardolph, if your Maiestie
    know the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes,
    and knobs, and flames a fire, and his lippes blowes at his
    nose, and it is like a coale of fire, sometimes plew, and
    sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's
    out

       King. Wee would haue all such offendors so cut off:
    and we giue expresse charge, that in our Marches through
    the Countrey, there be nothing compell'd from the Villages;
    nothing taken, but pay'd for: none of the French
    vpbrayded or abused in disdainefull Language; for when
    Leuitie and Crueltie play for a Kingdome, the gentler
    Gamester is the soonest winner.

    Tucket. Enter Mountioy.

      Mountioy. You know me by my habit

       King. Well then, I know thee: what shall I know of
    thee?
      Mountioy. My Masters mind

       King. Vnfold it

       Mountioy. Thus sayes my King: Say thou to Harry
    of England, Though we seem'd dead, we did but sleepe:
    Aduantage is a better Souldier then rashnesse. Tell him,
    wee could haue rebuk'd him at Harflewe, but that wee
    thought not good to bruise an iniurie, till it were full
    ripe. Now wee speake vpon our Q. and our voyce is imperiall:
    England shall repent his folly, see his weakenesse,
    and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider
    of his ransome, which must proportion the losses we
    haue borne, the subiects we haue lost, the disgrace we
    haue digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettinesse
    would bow vnder. For our losses, his Exchequer is
    too poore; for th' effusion of our bloud, the Muster of his
    Kingdome too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his
    owne person kneeling at our feet, but a weake and worthlesse
    satisfaction. To this adde defiance: and tell him for
    conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation
    is pronounc't: So farre my King and Master;
    so much my Office

       King. What is thy name? I know thy qualitie

       Mount. Mountioy

       King. Thou doo'st thy Office fairely. Turne thee backe,
    And tell thy King, I doe not seeke him now,
    But could be willing to march on to Callice,
    Without impeachment: for to say the sooth,
    Though 'tis no wisdome to confesse so much
    Vnto an enemie of Craft and Vantage,
    My people are with sicknesse much enfeebled,
    My numbers lessen'd: and those few I haue,
    Almost no better then so many French;
    Who when they were in health, I tell thee Herald,
    I thought, vpon one payre of English Legges
    Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgiue me God,
    That I doe bragge thus; this your ayre of France
    Hath blowne that vice in me. I must repent:
    Goe therefore tell thy Master, heere I am;
    My Ransome, is this frayle and worthlesse Trunke;
    My Army, but a weake and sickly Guard:
    Yet God before, tell him we will come on,
    Though France himselfe, and such another Neighbor
    Stand in our way. There's for thy labour Mountioy.
    Goe bid thy Master well aduise himselfe.
    If we may passe, we will: if we be hindred,
    We shall your tawnie ground with your red blood
    Discolour: and so Mountioy, fare you well.
    The summe of all our Answer is but this:
    We would not seeke a Battaile as we are,
    Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it:
    So tell your Master

       Mount. I shall deliuer so: Thankes to your Highnesse

       Glouc. I hope they will not come vpon vs now

       King. We are in Gods hand, Brother, not in theirs:
    March to the Bridge, it now drawes toward night,
    Beyond the Riuer wee'le encampe our selues,
    And on to morrow bid them march away.

    Exeunt.

    Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Ramburs, Orleance,
    Dolphin, with
    others.

      Const. Tut, I haue the best Armour of the World:
    would it were day

       Orleance. You haue an excellent Armour: but let my
    Horse haue his due

       Const. It is the best Horse of Europe

       Orleance. Will it neuer be Morning?
      Dolph. My Lord of Orleance, and my Lord High Constable,
    you talke of Horse and Armour?
      Orleance. You are as well prouided of both, as any
    Prince in the World

       Dolph. What a long Night is this? I will not change
    my Horse with any that treades but on foure postures:
    ch' ha: he bounds from the Earth, as if his entrayles were
    hayres: le Cheual volante, the Pegasus, ches les narines de
    feu. When I bestryde him, I soare, I am a Hawke: he trots
    the ayre: the Earth sings, when he touches it: the basest
    horne of his hoofe, is more Musicall then the Pipe of
    Hermes

       Orleance. Hee's of the colour of the Nutmeg

       Dolph. And of the heat of the Ginger. It is a Beast
    for Perseus: hee is pure Ayre and Fire; and the dull Elements
    of Earth and Water neuer appeare in him, but only
    in patient stillnesse while his Rider mounts him: hee
    is indeede a Horse, and all other Iades you may call
    Beasts

       Const. Indeed my Lord, it is a most absolute and excellent
    Horse

       Dolph. It is the Prince of Palfrayes, his Neigh is like
    the bidding of a Monarch, and his countenance enforces
    Homage

       Orleance. No more Cousin

       Dolph. Nay, the man hath no wit, that cannot from
    the rising of the Larke to the lodging of the Lambe,
    varie deserued prayse on my Palfray: it is a Theame as
    fluent as the Sea: Turne the Sands into eloquent tongues,
    and my Horse is argument for them all: 'tis a subiect
    for a Soueraigne to reason on, and for a Soueraignes Soueraigne
    to ride on: And for the World, familiar to vs,
    and vnknowne, to lay apart their particular Functions,
    and wonder at him, I once writ a Sonnet in his prayse,
    and began thus, Wonder of Nature

       Orleance. I haue heard a Sonnet begin so to ones Mistresse

       Dolph. Then did they imitate that which I compos'd
    to my Courser, for my Horse is my Mistresse

       Orleance. Your Mistresse beares well

       Dolph. Me well, which is the prescript prayse and perfection
    of a good and particular Mistresse

       Const. Nay, for me thought yesterday your Mistresse
    shrewdly shooke your back

       Dolph. So perhaps did yours

       Const. Mine was not bridled

       Dolph. O then belike she was old and gentle, and you
    rode like a Kerne of Ireland, your French Hose off, and in
    your strait Strossers

       Const. You haue good iudgement in Horsemanship

       Dolph. Be warn'd by me then: they that ride so, and
    ride not warily, fall into foule Boggs: I had rather haue
    my Horse to my Mistresse

       Const. I had as liue haue my Mistresse a Iade

       Dolph. I tell thee Constable, my Mistresse weares his
    owne hayre

       Const. I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a
    Sow to my Mistresse

       Dolph. Le chien est retourne a son propre vemissement est
    la leuye lauee au bourbier: thou mak'st vse of any thing

       Const. Yet doe I not vse my Horse for my Mistresse,
    or any such Prouerbe, so little kin to the purpose

       Ramb. My Lord Constable, the Armour that I saw in
    your Tent to night, are those Starres or Sunnes vpon it?
      Const. Starres my Lord

       Dolph. Some of them will fall to morrow, I hope

       Const. And yet my Sky shall not want

       Dolph. That may be, for you beare a many superfluously,
    and 'twere more honor some were away

       Const. Eu'n as your Horse beares your prayses, who
    would trot as well, were some of your bragges dismounted

       Dolph. Would I were able to loade him with his desert.
    Will it neuer be day? I will trot to morrow a mile,
    and my way shall be paued with English Faces

       Const. I will not say so, for feare I should be fac't out
    of my way: but I would it were morning, for I would
    faine be about the eares of the English

       Ramb. Who will goe to Hazard with me for twentie
    Prisoners?
      Const. You must first goe your selfe to hazard, ere you
    haue them

       Dolph. 'Tis Mid-night, Ile goe arme my selfe.
    Enter.

      Orleance. The Dolphin longs for morning

       Ramb. He longs to eate the English

       Const. I thinke he will eate all he kills

       Orleance. By the white Hand of my Lady, hee's a gallant
    Prince

       Const. Sweare by her Foot, that she may tread out the
    Oath

       Orleance. He is simply the most actiue Gentleman of
    France

       Const. Doing is actiuitie, and he will still be doing

       Orleance. He neuer did harme, that I heard of

       Const. Nor will doe none to morrow: hee will keepe
    that good name still

       Orleance. I know him to be valiant

       Const. I was told that, by one that knowes him better
    then you

       Orleance. What's hee?
      Const. Marry hee told me so himselfe, and hee sayd hee
    car'd not who knew it

       Orleance. Hee needes not, it is no hidden vertue in
    him

       Const. By my faith Sir, but it is: neuer any body saw
    it, but his Lacquey: 'tis a hooded valour, and when it
    appeares, it will bate

       Orleance. Ill will neuer sayd well

       Const. I will cap that Prouerbe with, There is flatterie
    in friendship

       Orleance. And I will take vp that with, Giue the Deuill
    his due

       Const. Well plac't: there stands your friend for the
    Deuill: haue at the very eye of that Prouerbe with, A
    Pox of the Deuill

       Orleance. You are the better at Prouerbs, by how much
    a Fooles Bolt is soone shot

       Const. You haue shot ouer

       Orleance. 'Tis not the first time you were ouer-shot.
    Enter a Messenger.

      Mess. My Lord high Constable, the English lye within
    fifteene hundred paces of your Tents

       Const. Who hath measur'd the ground?
      Mess. The Lord Grandpree

       Const. A valiant and most expert Gentleman. Would
    it were day? Alas poore Harry of England: hee longs
    not for the Dawning, as wee doe

       Orleance. What a wretched and peeuish fellow is this
    King of England, to mope with his fat-brain'd followers
    so farre out of his knowledge

       Const. If the English had any apprehension, they
    would runne away

       Orleance. That they lack: for if their heads had any intellectuall
    Armour, they could neuer weare such heauie
    Head-pieces

       Ramb. That Iland of England breedes very valiant
    Creatures; their Mastiffes are of vnmatchable courage

       Orleance. Foolish Curres, that runne winking into
    the mouth of a Russian Beare, and haue their heads crusht
    like rotten Apples: you may as well say, that's a valiant
    Flea, that dare eate his breakefast on the Lippe of a
    Lyon

       Const. Iust, iust: and the men doe sympathize with
    the Mastiffes, in robustious and rough comming on,
    leauing their Wits with their Wiues: and then giue
    them great Meales of Beefe, and Iron and Steele; they
    will eate like Wolues, and fight like Deuils

       Orleance. I, but these English are shrowdly out of
    Beefe

       Const. Then shall we finde to morrow, they haue only
    stomackes to eate, and none to fight. Now is it time to
    arme: come, shall we about it?
      Orleance. It is now two a Clock: but let me see, by ten
    Wee shall haue each a hundred English men.

    Exeunt.


    Actus Tertius.

    Chorus.

    Now entertaine coniecture of a time,
    When creeping Murmure and the poring Darke
    Fills the wide Vessell of the Vniuerse.
    From Camp to Camp, through the foule Womb of Night
    The Humme of eyther Army stilly sounds;
    That the fixt Centinels almost receiue
    The secret Whispers of each others Watch.
    Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
    Each Battaile sees the others vmber'd face.
    Steed threatens Steed, in high and boastfull Neighs
    Piercing the Nights dull Eare: and from the Tents,
    The Armourers accomplishing the Knights,
    With busie Hammers closing Riuets vp,
    Giue dreadfull note of preparation.
    The Countrey Cocks doe crow, the Clocks doe towle:
    And the third howre of drowsie Morning nam'd,
    Prowd of their Numbers, and secure in Soule,
    The confident and ouer-lustie French,
    Doe the low-rated English play at Dice;
    And chide the creeple-tardy-gated Night,
    Who like a foule and ougly Witch doth limpe
    So tediously away. The poore condemned English,
    Like Sacrifices, by their watchfull Fires
    Sit patiently, and inly ruminate
    The Mornings danger: and their gesture sad,
    Inuesting lanke-leane Cheekes, and Warre-worne Coats,
    Presented them vnto the gazing Moone
    So many horride Ghosts. O now, who will behold
    The Royall Captaine of this ruin'd Band
    Walking from Watch to Watch, from Tent to Tent;
    Let him cry, Prayse and Glory on his head:
    For forth he goes, and visits all his Hoast,
    Bids them good morrow with a modest Smyle,
    And calls them Brothers, Friends, and Countreymen.
    Vpon his Royall Face there is no note,
    How dread an Army hath enrounded him;
    Nor doth he dedicate one iot of Colour
    Vnto the wearie and all-watched Night:
    But freshly lookes, and ouer-beares Attaint,
    With chearefull semblance, and sweet Maiestie:
    That euery Wretch, pining and pale before,
    Beholding him, plucks comfort from his Lookes.
    A Largesse vniuersall, like the Sunne,
    His liberall Eye doth giue to euery one,
    Thawing cold feare, that meane and gentle all
    Behold, as may vnworthinesse define.
    A little touch of Harry in the Night,
    And so our Scene must to the Battaile flye:
    Where, O for pitty, we shall much disgrace,
    With foure or fiue most vile and ragged foyles,
    (Right ill dispos'd, in brawle ridiculous)
    The Name of Agincourt: Yet sit and see,
    Minding true things, by what their Mock'ries bee.
    Enter.

    Enter the King, Bedford, and Gloucester.

      King. Gloster, 'tis true that we are in great danger,
    The greater therefore should our Courage be.
    God morrow Brother Bedford: God Almightie,
    There is some soule of goodnesse in things euill,
    Would men obseruingly distill it out.
    For our bad Neighbour makes vs early stirrers,
    Which is both healthfull, and good husbandry.
    Besides, they are our outward Consciences,
    And Preachers to vs all; admonishing,
    That we should dresse vs fairely for our end.
    Thus may we gather Honey from the Weed,
    And make a Morall of the Diuell himselfe.
    Enter Erpingham.

    Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
    A good soft Pillow for that good white Head,
    Were better then a churlish turfe of France

       Erping. Not so my Liege, this Lodging likes me better,
    Since I may say, now lye I like a King

       King. 'Tis good for men to loue their present paines,
    Vpon example, so the Spirit is eased:
    And when the Mind is quickned, out of doubt
    The Organs, though defunct and dead before,
    Breake vp their drowsie Graue, and newly moue
    With casted slough, and fresh legeritie.
    Lend me thy Cloake Sir Thomas: Brothers both,
    Commend me to the Princes in our Campe;
    Doe my good morrow to them, and anon
    Desire them all to my Pauillion

       Gloster. We shall, my Liege

       Erping. Shall I attend your Grace?
      King. No, my good Knight:
    Goe with my Brothers to my Lords of England:
    I and my Bosome must debate a while,
    And then I would no other company

       Erping. The Lord in Heauen blesse thee, Noble
    Harry.

    Exeunt.

      King. God a mercy old Heart, thou speak'st chearefully.
    Enter Pistoll

       Pist. Che vous la?
      King. A friend

       Pist. Discusse vnto me, art thou Officer, or art thou
    base, common, and popular?
      King. I am a Gentleman of a Company

       Pist. Trayl'st thou the puissant Pyke?
      King. Euen so: what are you?
      Pist. As good a Gentleman as the Emperor

       King. Then you are a better then the King

       Pist. The King's a Bawcock, and a Heart of Gold, a
    Lad of Life, an Impe of Fame, of Parents good, of Fist
    most valiant: I kisse his durtie shooe, and from heartstring
    I loue the louely Bully. What is thy Name?
      King. Harry le Roy

       Pist. Le Roy? a Cornish Name: art thou of Cornish Crew?
      King. No, I am a Welchman

       Pist. Know'st thou Fluellen?
      King. Yes

       Pist. Tell him Ile knock his Leeke about his Pate vpon
    S[aint]. Dauies day

       King. Doe not you weare your Dagger in your Cappe
    that day, least he knock that about yours

       Pist. Art thou his friend?
      King. And his Kinsman too

       Pist. The Figo for thee then

       King. I thanke you: God be with you

       Pist. My name is Pistol call'd.
    Enter.

      King. It sorts well with your fiercenesse.

    Manet King.

    Enter Fluellen and Gower.

      Gower. Captaine Fluellen

       Flu. 'So, in the Name of Iesu Christ, speake fewer: it
    is the greatest admiration in the vniuersall World, when
    the true and aunchient Prerogatifes and Lawes of the
    Warres is not kept: if you would take the paines but to
    examine the Warres of Pompey the Great, you shall finde,
    I warrant you, that there is no tiddle tadle nor pibble bable
    in Pompeyes Campe: I warrant you, you shall finde
    the Ceremonies of the Warres, and the Cares of it, and
    the Formes of it, and the Sobrietie of it, and the Modestie
    of it, to be otherwise

       Gower. Why the Enemie is lowd, you heare him all
    Night

       Flu. If the Enemie is an Asse and a Foole, and a prating
    Coxcombe; is it meet, thinke you, that wee should
    also, looke you, be an Asse and a Foole, and a prating Coxcombe,
    in your owne conscience now?
      Gow. I will speake lower

       Flu. I pray you, and beseech you, that you will.
    Enter.

      King. Though it appeare a little out of fashion,
    There is much care and valour in this Welchman.
    Enter three Souldiers, Iohn Bates, Alexander Court, and Michael
    Williams.


      Court. Brother Iohn Bates, is not that the Morning
    which breakes yonder?
      Bates. I thinke it be: but wee haue no great cause to
    desire the approach of day

       Williams. Wee see yonder the beginning of the day,
    but I thinke wee shall neuer see the end of it. Who goes
    there?
      King. A Friend

       Williams. Vnder what Captaine serue you?
      King. Vnder Sir Iohn Erpingham

       Williams. A good old Commander, and a most kinde
    Gentleman: I pray you, what thinkes he of our estate?
      King. Euen as men wrackt vpon a Sand, that looke to
    be washt off the next Tyde

       Bates. He hath not told his thought to the King?
      King. No: nor it is not meet he should: for though I
    speake it to you, I thinke the King is but a man, as I am:
    the Violet smells to him, as it doth to me; the Element
    shewes to him, as it doth to me; all his Sences haue but
    humane Conditions: his Ceremonies layd by, in his Nakednesse
    he appeares but a man; and though his affections
    are higher mounted then ours, yet when they stoupe,
    they stoupe with the like wing: therefore, when he sees
    reason of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of
    the same rellish as ours are: yet in reason, no man should
    possesse him with any appearance of feare; least hee, by
    shewing it, should dis-hearten his Army

       Bates. He may shew what outward courage he will:
    but I beleeue, as cold a Night as 'tis, hee could wish himselfe
    in Thames vp to the Neck; and so I would he were,
    and I by him, at all aduentures, so we were quit here

       King. By my troth, I will speake my conscience of the
    King: I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where,
    but where hee is

       Bates. Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
    sure to be ransomed, and a many poore mens liues saued

       King. I dare say, you loue him not so ill, to wish him
    here alone: howsoeuer you speake this to feele other
    mens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where so contented,
    as in the Kings company; his Cause being iust, and
    his Quarrell honorable

       Williams. That's more then we know

       Bates. I, or more then wee should seeke after; for wee
    know enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects:
    if his Cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes
    the Cryme of it out of vs

       Williams. But if the Cause be not good, the King himselfe
    hath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all those
    Legges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt off in a Battaile,
    shall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dyed
    at such a place, some swearing, some crying for a Surgean;
    some vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them;
    some vpon the Debts they owe, some vpon their Children
    rawly left: I am afear'd, there are few dye well, that dye
    in a Battaile: for how can they charitably dispose of any
    thing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if these men
    doe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King,
    that led them to it; who to disobey, were against all proportion
    of subiection

       King. So, if a Sonne that is by his Father sent about
    Merchandize, doe sinfully miscarry vpon the Sea; the imputation
    of his wickednesse, by your rule, should be imposed
    vpon his Father that sent him: or if a Seruant, vnder
    his Masters command, transporting a summe of Money,
    be assayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil'd
    Iniquities; you may call the businesse of the Master the
    author of the Seruants damnation: but this is not so:
    The King is not bound to answer the particular endings
    of his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Master
    of his Seruant; for they purpose not their death, when
    they purpose their seruices. Besides, there is no King, be
    his Cause neuer so spotlesse, if it come to the arbitrement
    of Swords, can trye it out with all vnspotted Souldiers:
    some (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of
    premeditated and contriued Murther; some, of beguiling
    Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; some,
    making the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before gored
    the gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robberie.
    Now, if these men haue defeated the Law, and outrunne
    Natiue punishment; though they can out-strip
    men, they haue no wings to flye from God. Warre is
    his Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: so that here men
    are punisht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in
    now the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death,
    they haue borne life away; and where they would bee
    safe, they perish. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more
    is the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was before
    guiltie of those Impieties, for the which they are
    now visited. Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings, but
    euery Subiects Soule is his owne. Therefore should
    euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery sicke man in
    his Bed, wash euery Moth out of his Conscience: and
    dying so, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying,
    the time was blessedly lost, wherein such preparation was
    gayned: and in him that escapes, it were not sinne to
    thinke, that making God so free an offer, he let him outliue
    that day, to see his Greatnesse, and to teach others
    how they should prepare

       Will. 'Tis certaine, euery man that dyes ill, the ill vpon
    his owne head, the King is not to answer it

       Bates. I doe not desire hee should answer for me, and
    yet I determine to fight lustily for him

       King. I my selfe heard the King say he would not be
    ransom'd

       Will. I, hee said so, to make vs fight chearefully: but
    when our throats are cut, hee may be ransom'd, and wee
    ne're the wiser

       King. If I liue to see it, I will neuer trust his word after

       Will. You pay him then: that's a perillous shot out
    of an Elder Gunne, that a poore and a priuate displeasure
    can doe against a Monarch: you may as well goe about
    to turne the Sunne to yce, with fanning in his face with a
    Peacocks feather: You'le neuer trust his word after;
    come, 'tis a foolish saying

       King. Your reproofe is something too round, I should
    be angry with you, if the time were conuenient

       Will. Let it bee a Quarrell betweene vs, if you
    liue

       King. I embrace it

       Will. How shall I know thee againe?
      King. Giue me any Gage of thine, and I will weare it
    in my Bonnet: Then if euer thou dar'st acknowledge it,
    I will make it my Quarrell

       Will. Heere's my Gloue: Giue mee another of
    thine

       King. There

       Will. This will I also weare in my Cap: if euer thou
    come to me, and say, after to morrow, This is my Gloue,
    by this Hand I will take thee a box on the eare

       King. If euer I liue to see it, I will challenge it

       Will. Thou dar'st as well be hang'd

       King. Well, I will doe it, though I take thee in the
    Kings companie

       Will. Keepe thy word: fare thee well

       Bates. Be friends you English fooles, be friends, wee
    haue French Quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.

    Exit Souldiers.

      King. Indeede the French may lay twentie French
    Crownes to one, they will beat vs, for they beare them
    on their shoulders: but it is no English Treason to cut
    French Crownes, and to morrow the King himselfe will
    be a Clipper.
    Vpon the King, let vs our Liues, our Soules,
    Our Debts, our carefull Wiues,
    Our Children, and our Sinnes, lay on the King:
    We must beare all.
    O hard Condition, Twin-borne with Greatnesse,
    Subiect to the breath of euery foole, whose sence
    No more can feele, but his owne wringing.
    What infinite hearts-ease must Kings neglect,
    That priuate men enioy?
    And what haue Kings, that Priuates haue not too,
    Saue Ceremonie, saue generall Ceremonie?
    And what art thou, thou Idoll Ceremonie?
    What kind of God art thou? that suffer'st more
    Of mortall griefes, then doe thy worshippers.
    What are thy Rents? what are thy Commings in?
    O Ceremonie, shew me but thy worth.
    What? is thy Soule of Odoration?
    Art thou ought else but Place, Degree, and Forme,
    Creating awe and feare in other men?
    Wherein thou art lesse happy, being fear'd,
    Then they in fearing.
    What drink'st thou oft, in stead of Homage sweet,
    But poyson'd flatterie? O, be sick, great Greatnesse,
    And bid thy Ceremonie giue thee cure.
    Thinks thou the fierie Feuer will goe out
    With Titles blowne from Adulation?
    Will it giue place to flexure and low bending?
    Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggers knee,
    Command the health of it? No, thou prowd Dreame,
    That play'st so subtilly with a Kings Repose.
    I am a King that find thee: and I know,
    'Tis not the Balme, the Scepter, and the Ball,
    The Sword, the Mase, the Crowne Imperiall,
    The enter-tissued Robe of Gold and Pearle,
    The farsed Title running 'fore the King,
    The Throne he sits on: nor the Tyde of Pompe,
    That beates vpon the high shore of this World:
    No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous Ceremonie;
    Not all these, lay'd in Bed Maiesticall,
    Can sleepe so soundly, as the wretched Slaue:
    Who with a body fill'd, and vacant mind,
    Gets him to rest, cram'd with distressefull bread,
    Neuer sees horride Night, the Child of Hell:
    But like a Lacquey, from the Rise to Set,
    Sweates in the eye of Phebus; and all Night
    Sleepes in Elizium: next day after dawne,
    Doth rise and helpe Hiperio[n] to his Horse,
    And followes so the euer-running yeere
    With profitable labour to his Graue:
    And but for Ceremonie, such a Wretch,
    Winding vp Dayes with toyle, and Nights with sleepe,
    Had the fore-hand and vantage of a King.
    The Slaue, a Member of the Countreyes peace,
    Enioyes it; but in grosse braine little wots,
    What watch the King keepes, to maintaine the peace;
    Whose howres, the Pesant best aduantages.
    Enter Erpingham.

      Erp. My Lord, your Nobles iealous of your absence,
    Seeke through your Campe to find you

       King. Good old Knight, collect them all together
    At my Tent: Ile be before thee

       Erp. I shall doo't, my Lord.
    Enter.

      King. O God of Battailes, steele my Souldiers hearts,
    Possesse them not with feare: Take from them now
    The sence of reckning of th' opposed numbers:
    Pluck their hearts from them. Not to day, O Lord,
    O not to day, thinke not vpon the fault
    My Father made, in compassing the Crowne.
    I Richards body haue interred new,
    And on it haue bestowed more contrite teares,
    Then from it issued forced drops of blood.
    Fiue hundred poore I haue in yeerely pay,
    Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold vp
    Toward Heauen, to pardon blood:
    And I haue built two Chauntries,
    Where the sad and solemne Priests sing still
    For Richards Soule. More will I doe:
    Though all that I can doe, is nothing worth;
    Since that my Penitence comes after all,
    Imploring pardon.
    Enter Gloucester.

      Glouc. My Liege

       King. My Brother Gloucesters voyce? I:
    I know thy errand, I will goe with thee:
    The day, my friend, and all things stay for me.

    Exeunt.

    Enter the Dolphin, Orleance, Ramburs, and Beaumont.

      Orleance. The Sunne doth gild our Armour vp, my
    Lords

       Dolph. Monte Cheual: My Horse, Verlot Lacquay:
    Ha

       Orleance. Oh braue Spirit

       Dolph. Via les ewes & terre

       Orleance. Rien puis le air & feu

       Dolph. Cein, Cousin Orleance.
    Enter Constable.

    Now my Lord Constable?
      Const. Hearke how our Steedes, for present Seruice
    neigh

       Dolph. Mount them, and make incision in their Hides,
    That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
    And doubt them with superfluous courage: ha

       Ram. What, wil you haue them weep our Horses blood?
    How shall we then behold their naturall teares?
    Enter Messenger.

      Messeng. The English are embattail'd, you French
    Peeres

       Const. To Horse you gallant Princes, straight to Horse.
    Doe but behold yond poore and starued Band,
    And your faire shew shall suck away their Soules,
    Leauing them but the shales and huskes of men.
    There is not worke enough for all our hands,
    Scarce blood enough in all their sickly Veines,
    To giue each naked Curtleax a stayne,
    That our French Gallants shall to day draw out,
    And sheath for lack of sport. Let vs but blow on them,
    The vapour of our Valour will o're-turne them.
    'Tis positiue against all exceptions, Lords,
    That our superfluous Lacquies, and our Pesants,
    Who in vnnecessarie action swarme
    About our Squares of Battaile, were enow
    To purge this field of such a hilding Foe;
    Though we vpon this Mountaines Basis by,
    Tooke stand for idle speculation:
    But that our Honours must not. What's to say?
    A very little little let vs doe,
    And all is done: then let the Trumpets sound
    The Tucket Sonuance, and the Note to mount:
    For our approach shall so much dare the field,
    That England shall couch downe in feare, and yeeld.
    Enter Graundpree.

      Grandpree. Why do you stay so long, my Lords of France?
    Yond Iland Carrions, desperate of their bones,
    Ill-fauoredly become the Morning field:
    Their ragged Curtaines poorely are let loose,
    And our Ayre shakes them passing scornefully.
    Bigge Mars seemes banqu'rout in their begger'd Hoast,
    And faintly through a rustie Beuer peepes.
    The Horsemen sit like fixed Candlesticks,
    With Torch-staues in their hand: and their poore Iades
    Lob downe their heads, dropping the hides and hips:
    The gumme downe roping from their pale-dead eyes,
    And in their pale dull mouthes the Iymold Bitt
    Lyes foule with chaw'd-grasse, still and motionlesse.
    And their executors, the knauish Crowes,
    Flye o're them all, impatient for their howre.
    Description cannot sute it selfe in words,
    To demonstrate the Life of such a Battaile,
    In life so liuelesse, as it shewes it selfe

       Const. They haue said their prayers,
    And they stay for death

       Dolph. Shall we goe send them Dinners, and fresh Sutes,
    And giue their fasting Horses Prouender,
    And after fight with them?
      Const. I stay but for my Guard: on
    To the field, I will the Banner from a Trumpet take,
    And vse it for my haste. Come, come away,
    The Sunne is high, and we out-weare the day.

    Exeunt.

    Enter Gloucester, Bedford, Exeter, Erpingham with all his Hoast:
    Salisbury, and Westmerland.

      Glouc. Where is the King?
      Bedf. The King himselfe is rode to view their Battaile

       West. Of fighting men they haue full threescore thousand

       Exe. There's fiue to one, besides they all are fresh

       Salisb. Gods Arme strike with vs, 'tis a fearefull oddes.
    God buy' you Princes all; Ile to my Charge:
    If we no more meet, till we meet in Heauen;
    Then ioyfully, my Noble Lord of Bedford,
    My deare Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
    And my kind Kinsman, Warriors all, adieu

       Bedf. Farwell good Salisbury, & good luck go with thee:
    And yet I doe thee wrong, to mind thee of it,
    For thou art fram'd of the firme truth of valour

       Exe. Farwell kind Lord: fight valiantly to day

       Bedf. He is as full of Valour as of Kindnesse,
    Princely in both.
    Enter the King.

      West. O that we now had here
    But one ten thousand of those men in England,
    That doe no worke to day

       King. What's he that wishes so?
    My Cousin Westmerland. No, my faire Cousin:
    If we are markt to dye, we are enow
    To doe our Countrey losse: and if to liue,
    The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
    Gods will, I pray thee wish not one man more.
    By Ioue, I am not couetous for Gold,
    Nor care I who doth feed vpon my cost:
    It yernes me not, if men my Garments weare;
    Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
    But if it be a sinne to couet Honor,
    I am the most offending Soule aliue.
    No 'faith, my Couze, wish not a man from England:
    Gods peace, I would not loose so great an Honor,
    As one man more me thinkes would share from me,
    For the best hope I haue. O, doe not wish one more:
    Rather proclaime it (Westmerland) through my Hoast,
    That he which hath no stomack to this fight,
    Let him depart, his Pasport shall be made,
    And Crownes for Conuoy put into his Purse:
    We would not dye in that mans companie,
    That feares his fellowship, to dye with vs.
    This day is call'd the Feast of Crispian:
    He that out-liues this day, and comes safe home,
    Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named,
    And rowse him at the Name of Crispian.
    He that shall see this day, and liue old age,
    Will yeerely on the Vigil feast his neighbours,
    And say, to morrow is Saint Crispian.
    Then will he strip his sleeue, and shew his skarres:
    Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot:
    But hee'le remember, with aduantages,
    What feats he did that day. Then shall our Names,
    Familiar in his mouth as household words,
    Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
    Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
    Be in their flowing Cups freshly remembred.
    This story shall the good man teach his sonne:
    And Crispine Crispian shall ne're goe by,
    From this day to the ending of the World,
    But we in it shall be remembred;
    We few, we happy few, we band of brothers:
    For he to day that sheds his blood with me,
    Shall be my brother: be he ne're so vile,
    This day shall gentle his Condition.
    And Gentlemen in England, now a bed,
    Shall thinke themselues accurst they were not here;
    And hold their Manhoods cheape, whiles any speakes,
    That fought with vs vpon Saint Crispines day.
    Enter Salisbury.

      Sal. My Soueraign Lord, bestow your selfe with speed:
    The French are brauely in their battailes set,
    And will with all expedience charge on vs

       King. All things are ready, if our minds be so

       West. Perish the man, whose mind is backward now

       King. Thou do'st not wish more helpe from England,
    Couze?
      West. Gods will, my Liege, would you and I alone,
    Without more helpe, could fight this Royall battaile

       King. Why now thou hast vnwisht fiue thousand men:
    Which likes me better, then to wish vs one.
    You know your places: God be with you all.

    Tucket. Enter Montioy.

      Mont. Once more I come to know of thee King Harry,
    If for thy Ransome thou wilt now compound,
    Before thy most assured Ouerthrow:
    For certainly, thou art so neere the Gulfe,
    Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy
    The Constable desires thee, thou wilt mind
    Thy followers of Repentance; that their Soules
    May make a peacefull and a sweet retyre
    From off these fields: where (wretches) their poore bodies
    Must lye and fester

       King. Who hath sent thee now?
      Mont. The Constable of France

       King. I pray thee beare my former Answer back:
    Bid them atchieue me, and then sell my bones.
    Good God, why should they mock poore fellowes thus?
    The man that once did sell the Lyons skin
    While the beast liu'd, was kill'd with hunting him.
    A many of our bodyes shall no doubt
    Find Natiue Graues: vpon the which, I trust
    Shall witnesse liue in Brasse of this dayes worke.
    And those that leaue their valiant bones in France,
    Dying like men, though buryed in your Dunghills,
    They shall be fam'd: for there the Sun shall greet them,
    And draw their honors reeking vp to Heauen,
    Leauing their earthly parts to choake your Clyme,
    The smell whereof shall breed a Plague in France.
    Marke then abounding valour in our English:
    That being dead, like to the bullets crasing,
    Breake out into a second course of mischiefe,
    Killing in relapse of Mortalitie.
    Let me speake prowdly: Tell the Constable,
    We are but Warriors for the working day:
    Our Gaynesse and our Gilt are all besmyrcht
    With raynie Marching in the painefull field.
    There's not a piece of feather in our Hoast:
    Good argument (I hope) we will not flye:
    And time hath worne vs into slouenrie.
    But by the Masse, our hearts are in the trim:
    And my poore Souldiers tell me, yet ere Night,
    They'le be in fresher Robes, or they will pluck
    The gay new Coats o're the French Souldiers heads,
    And turne them out of seruice. If they doe this,
    As if God please, they shall; my Ransome then
    Will soone be leuyed.
    Herauld, saue thou thy labour:
    Come thou no more for Ransome, gentle Herauld,
    They shall haue none, I sweare, but these my ioynts:
    Which if they haue, as I will leaue vm them,
    Shall yeeld them little, tell the Constable

       Mont. I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
    Thou neuer shalt heare Herauld any more.
    Enter.

      King. I feare thou wilt once more come againe for a
    Ransome.
    Enter Yorke.

      Yorke. My Lord, most humbly on my knee I begge
    The leading of the Vaward

       King. Take it, braue Yorke.
    Now Souldiers march away,
    And how thou pleasest God, dispose the day.

    Exeunt.

    Alarum. Excursions. Enter Pistoll, French Souldier, Boy.

      Pist. Yeeld Curre

       French. Ie pense que vous estes le Gentilhome de bon qualitee

       Pist. Qualtitie calmie custure me. Art thou a Gentleman?
    What is thy Name? discusse

       French. O Seigneur Dieu

       Pist. O Signieur Dewe should be a Gentleman: perpend
    my words O Signieur Dewe, and marke: O Signieur
    Dewe, thou dyest on point of Fox, except O Signieur
    thou doe giue to me egregious Ransome

       French. O prennes miserecordie aye pitez de moy

       Pist. Moy shall not serue, I will haue fortie Moyes: for
    I will fetch thy rymme out at thy Throat, in droppes of
    Crimson blood

       French. Est il impossible d' eschapper le force de ton bras

       Pist. Brasse, Curre? thou damned and luxurious Mountaine
    Goat, offer'st me Brasse?
      French. O perdonne moy

       Pist. Say'st thou me so? is that a Tonne of Moyes?
    Come hither boy, aske me this slaue in French what is his
    Name

       Boy. Escoute comment estes vous appelle?
      French. Mounsieur le Fer

       Boy. He sayes his Name is M. Fer

       Pist. M. Fer: Ile fer him, and firke him, and ferret him:
    discusse the same in French vnto him

       Boy. I doe not know the French for fer, and ferret, and
    firke

       Pist. Bid him prepare, for I will cut his throat

       French. Que dit il Mounsieur?
      Boy. Il me commande a vous dire que vous faite vous
    prest, car ce soldat icy est disposee tout asture de couppes vostre
    gorge

       Pist. Owy, cuppele gorge permafoy pesant, vnlesse
    thou giue me Crownes, braue Crownes; or mangled shalt
    thou be by this my Sword

       French. O Ie vous supplie pour l' amour de Dieu: ma pardonner,
    Ie suis le Gentilhome de bon maison, garde ma vie, & Ie
    vous donneray deux cent escus

       Pist. What are his words?
      Boy. He prayes you to saue his life, he is a Gentleman
    of a good house, and for his ransom he will giue you two
    hundred Crownes

       Pist. Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the Crownes
    will take

       Fren. Petit Monsieur que dit il?
      Boy. Encore qu'il et contra son Iurement, de pardonner aucune
    prisonner: neantmons pour les escues que vous layt a promets,
    il est content a vous donnes le liberte le franchisement

       Fre. Sur mes genoux se vous donnes milles remercious, et
    Ie me estime heurex que Ie intombe, entre les main d' vn Cheualier
    Ie pense le plus braue valiant et tres distime signieur
    d' Angleterre

       Pist. Expound vnto me boy

       Boy. He giues you vpon his knees a thousand thanks,
    and he esteemes himselfe happy, that he hath falne into
    the hands of one (as he thinkes) the most braue, valorous
    and thrice-worthy signeur of England

       Pist. As I sucke blood, I will some mercy shew. Follow
    mee

       Boy. Saaue vous le grand Capitaine?
    I did neuer know so full a voyce issue from so emptie a
    heart: but the saying is true, The empty vessel makes the
    greatest sound, Bardolfe and Nym had tenne times more
    valour, then this roaring diuell i'th olde play, that euerie
    one may payre his nayles with a woodden dagger, and
    they are both hang'd, and so would this be, if hee durst
    steale any thing aduenturously. I must stay with the
    Lackies with the luggage of our camp, the French might
    haue a good pray of vs, if he knew of it, for there is none
    to guard it but boyes.
    Enter.

    Enter Constable, Orleance, Burbon, Dolphin, and Rambures.

      Con. O Diable

       Orl. O signeur le iour et perdia, toute et perdie

       Dol. Mor Dieu ma vie, all is confounded all,
    Reproach, and euerlasting shame
    Sits mocking in our Plumes.

    A short Alarum.

    O meschante Fortune, do not runne away

       Con. Why all our rankes are broke

       Dol. O perdurable shame, let's stab our selues:
    Be these the wretches that we plaid at dice for?
      Orl. Is this the King we sent too, for his ransome?
      Bur. Shame, and eternall shame, nothing but shame,
    Let vs dye in once more backe againe,
    And he that will not follow Burbon now,
    Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand
    Like a base Pander hold the Chamber doore,
    Whilst a base slaue, no gentler then my dogge,
    His fairest daughter is contaminated

       Con. Disorder that hath spoyl'd vs, friend vs now,
    Let vs on heapes go offer vp our liues

       Orl. We are enow yet liuing in the Field,
    To smother vp the English in our throngs,
    If any order might be thought vpon

       Bur. The diuell take Order now, Ile to the throng;
    Let life be short, else shame will be too long.
    Enter.

    Alarum. Enter the King and his trayne, with Prisoners.

      King. Well haue we done, thrice-valiant Countrimen,
    But all's not done, yet keepe the French the field

       Exe. The D[uke]. of York commends him to your Maiesty
      King. Liues he good Vnckle: thrice within this houre
    I saw him downe; thrice vp againe, and fighting,
    From Helmet to the spurre, all blood he was

       Exe. In which array (braue Soldier) doth he lye,
    Larding the plaine: and by his bloody side,
    (Yoake-fellow to his honour-owing-wounds)
    The Noble Earle of Suffolke also lyes.
    Suffolke first dyed, and Yorke all hagled ouer
    Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteeped,
    And takes him by the Beard, kisses the gashes
    That bloodily did yawne vpon his face.
    He cryes aloud; Tarry my Cosin Suffolke,
    My soule shall thine keepe company to heauen:
    Tarry (sweet soule) for mine, then flye a-brest:
    As in this glorious and well-foughten field
    We kept together in our Chiualrie.
    Vpon these words I came, and cheer'd him vp,
    He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand,
    And with a feeble gripe, sayes: Deere my Lord,
    Commend my seruice to my Soueraigne,
    So did he turne, and ouer Suffolkes necke
    He threw his wounded arme, and kist his lippes,
    And so espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd
    A Testament of Noble-ending-loue:
    The prettie and sweet manner of it forc'd
    Those waters from me, which I would haue stop'd,
    But I had not so much of man in mee,
    And all my mother came into mine eyes,
    And gaue me vp to teares

       King. I blame you not,
    For hearing this, I must perforce compound
    With mixtfull eyes, or they will issue to.

    Alarum

    But hearke, what new alarum is this same?
    The French haue re-enforc'd their scatter'd men:
    Then euery souldiour kill his Prisoners,
    Giue the word through.

    Exit


    Actus Quartus.

    Enter Fluellen and Gower.

      Flu. Kill the poyes and the luggage, 'Tis expressely
    against the Law of Armes, tis as arrant a peece of knauery
    marke you now, as can bee offert in your Conscience
    now, is it not?
      Gow. Tis certaine, there's not a boy left aliue, and the
    Cowardly Rascalls that ranne from the battaile ha' done
    this slaughter: besides they haue burned and carried away
    all that was in the Kings Tent, wherefore the King
    most worthily hath caus'd euery soldiour to cut his prisoners
    throat. O 'tis a gallant King

       Flu. I, hee was porne at Monmouth Captaine Gower:
    What call you the Townes name where Alexander the
    pig was borne?
      Gow. Alexander the Great

       Flu. Why I pray you, is not pig, great? The pig, or
    the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous,
    are all one reckonings, saue the phrase is a litle variations

       Gower. I thinke Alexander the Great was borne in
    Macedon, his Father was called Phillip of Macedon, as I
    take it

       Flu. I thinke it is in Macedon where Alexander is
    porne: I tell you Captaine, if you looke in the Maps of
    the Orld, I warrant you sall finde in the comparisons betweene
    Macedon & Monmouth, that the situations looke
    you, is both alike. There is a Riuer in Macedon, & there
    is also moreouer a Riuer at Monmouth, it is call'd Wye at
    Monmouth: but it is out of my praines, what is the name
    of the other Riuer: but 'tis all one, tis alike as my fingers
    is to my fingers, and there is Salmons in both. If you
    marke Alexanders life well, Harry of Monmouthes life is
    come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all
    things. Alexander God knowes, and you know, in his
    rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his chollers, and
    his moodes, and his displeasures, and his indignations,
    and also being a little intoxicates in his praines, did in
    his Ales and his angers (looke you) kill his best friend
    Clytus

       Gow. Our King is not like him in that, he neuer kill'd
    any of his friends

       Flu. It is not well done (marke you now) to take the
    tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
    but in the figures, and comparisons of it: as Alexander
    kild his friend Clytus, being in his Ales and his Cuppes; so
    also Harry Monmouth being in his right wittes, and his
    good iudgements, turn'd away the fat Knight with the
    great belly doublet: he was full of iests, and gypes, and
    knaueries, and mockes, I haue forgot his name

       Gow. Sir Iohn Falstaffe

       Flu. That is he: Ile tell you, there is good men porne
    at Monmouth

       Gow. Heere comes his Maiesty.

    Alarum. Enter King Harry and Burbon with prisoners. Flourish.

      King. I was not angry since I came to France,
    Vntill this instant. Take a Trumpet Herald,
    Ride thou vnto the Horsemen on yond hill:
    If they will fight with vs, bid them come downe,
    Or voyde the field: they do offend our sight.
    If they'l do neither, we will come to them,
    And make them sker away, as swift as stones
    Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
    Besides, wee'l cut the throats of those we haue,
    And not a man of them that we shall take,
    Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.
    Enter Montioy.

      Exe. Here comes the Herald of the French, my Liege
      Glou. His eyes are humbler then they vs'd to be

       King. How now, what meanes this Herald? Knowst
    thou not,
    That I haue fin'd these bones of mine for ransome?
    Com'st thou againe for ransome?
      Her. No great King:
    I come to thee for charitable License,
    That we may wander ore this bloody field,
    To booke our dead, and then to bury them,
    To sort our Nobles from our common men.
    For many of our Princes (woe the while)
    Lye drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood:
    So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbes
    In blood of Princes, and with wounded steeds
    Fret fet-locke deepe in gore, and with wilde rage
    Yerke out their armed heeles at their dead masters,
    Killing them twice. O giue vs leaue great King,
    To view the field in safety, and dispose
    Of their dead bodies

       Kin. I tell thee truly Herald,
    I know not if the day be ours or no,
    For yet a many of your horsemen peere,
    And gallop ore the field

       Her. The day is yours

       Kin. Praised be God, and not our strength for it:
    What is this Castle call'd that stands hard by

       Her. They call it Agincourt

       King. Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
    Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus

       Flu. Your Grandfather of famous memory (an't please
    your Maiesty) and your great Vncle Edward the Placke
    Prince of Wales, as I haue read in the Chronicles, fought
    a most praue pattle here in France

       Kin. They did Fluellen

       Flu. Your Maiesty sayes very true: If your Maiesties
    is remembred of it, the Welchmen did good seruice in a
    Garden where Leekes did grow, wearing Leekes in their
    Monmouth caps, which your Maiesty know to this houre
    is an honourable badge of the seruice: And I do beleeue
    your Maiesty takes no scorne to weare the Leeke vppon
    S[aint]. Tauies day

       King. I weare it for a memorable honor:
    For I am Welch you know good Countriman

       Flu. All the water in Wye, cannot wash your Maiesties
    Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:
    God plesse it, and preserue it, as long as it pleases his
    Grace, and his Maiesty too

       Kin. Thankes good my Countrymen

       Flu. By Ieshu, I am your Maiesties Countreyman, I
    care not who know it: I will confesse it to all the Orld, I
    need not to be ashamed of your Maiesty, praised be God
    so long as your Maiesty is an honest man

       King. Good keepe me so.
    Enter Williams.

    Our Heralds go with him,
    Bring me iust notice of the numbers dead
    On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither

       Exe. Souldier, you must come to the King

       Kin. Souldier, why wear'st thou that Gloue in thy
    Cappe?
      Will. And't please your Maiesty, tis the gage of one
    that I should fight withall, if he be aliue

       Kin. An Englishman?
      Wil. And't please your Maiesty, a Rascall that swagger'd
    with me last night: who if aliue, and euer dare to
    challenge this Gloue, I haue sworne to take him a boxe
    a'th ere: or if I can see my Gloue in his cappe, which he
    swore as he was a Souldier he would weare (if aliue) I wil
    strike it out soundly

       Kin. What thinke you Captaine Fluellen, is it fit this
    souldier keepe his oath

       Flu. Hee is a Crauen and a Villaine else, and't please
    your Maiesty in my conscience

       King. It may bee, his enemy is a Gentleman of great
    sort quite from the answer of his degree

       Flu. Though he be as good a Ientleman as the diuel is,
    as Lucifer and Belzebub himselfe, it is necessary (looke
    your Grace) that he keepe his vow and his oath: If hee
    bee periur'd (see you now) his reputation is as arrant a
    villaine and a Iacke sawce, as euer his blacke shoo trodd
    vpon Gods ground, and his earth, in my conscience law
      King. Then keepe thy vow sirrah, when thou meet'st
    the fellow

       Wil. So, I wil my Liege, as I liue

       King. Who seru'st thou vnder?
      Will. Vnder Captaine Gower, my Liege

       Flu. Gower is a good Captaine, and is good knowledge
    and literatured in the Warres

       King. Call him hither to me, Souldier

       Will. I will my Liege.
    Enter.

      King. Here Fluellen, weare thou this fauour for me, and
    sticke it in thy Cappe: when Alanson and my selfe were
    downe together, I pluckt this Gloue from his Helme: If
    any man challenge this, hee is a friend to Alanson, and an
    enemy to our Person; if thou encounter any such, apprehend
    him, and thou do'st me loue

       Flu. Your Grace doo's me as great Honors as can be
    desir'd in the hearts of his Subiects: I would faine see
    the man, that ha's but two legges, that shall find himselfe
    agreefd at this Gloue; that is all: but I would faine see
    it once, and please God of his grace that I might see

       King. Know'st thou Gower?
      Flu. He is my deare friend, and please you

       King. Pray thee goe seeke him, and bring him to my
    Tent

       Flu. I will fetch him.
    Enter.

      King. My Lord of Warwick, and my Brother Gloster,
    Follow Fluellen closely at the heeles.
    The Gloue which I haue giuen him for a fauour,
    May haply purchase him a box a'th' eare.
    It is the Souldiers: I by bargaine should
    Weare it my selfe. Follow good Cousin Warwick:
    If that the Souldier strike him, as I iudge
    By his blunt bearing, he will keepe his word;
    Some sodaine mischiefe may arise of it:
    For I doe know Fluellen valiant,
    And toucht with Choler, hot as Gunpowder,
    And quickly will returne an iniurie.
    Follow, and see there be no harme betweene them.
    Goe you with me, Vnckle of Exeter.

    Exeunt.

    Enter Gower and Williams.

      Will. I warrant it is to Knight you, Captaine.
    Enter Fluellen.

      Flu. Gods will, and his pleasure, Captaine, I beseech
    you now, come apace to the King: there is more good

      Flu. 'Sblud, an arrant Traytor as anyes in the Vniuersall
    World, or in France, or in England

       Gower. How now Sir? you Villaine

      Flu. Stand away Captaine Gower, I will giue Treason
    his payment into plowes, I warrant you

       Will. I am no Traytor

    Alansons.
    Enter Warwick and Gloucester.

    that looke your Grace, ha's strooke the Gloue which
    your Maiestie is take out of the Helmet of Alanson

       Will. My Liege, this was my Gloue, here is the fellow
    of it: and he that I gaue it to in change, promis'd to weare
    it in his Cappe: I promis'd to strike him, if he did: I met

    good as my word

       Flu. Your Maiestie heare now, sauing your Maiesties
    Manhood, what an arrant rascally, beggerly, lowsie
    Knaue it is: I hope your Maiestie is peare me testimonie
    and witnesse, and will auouchment, that this is the Gloue
    of Alanson, that your Maiestie is giue me, in your Conscience

       King. Giue me thy Gloue Souldier;
    Looke, heere is the fellow of it:
    'Twas I indeed thou promised'st to strike,
    And thou hast giuen me most bitter termes

       Flu. And please your Maiestie, let his Neck answere
    for it, if there is any Marshall Law in the World

       King. How canst thou make me satisfaction?
      Will. All offences, my Lord, come from the heart: neuer
    came any from mine, that might offend your Maiestie

       King. It was our selfe thou didst abuse

       Will. Your Maiestie came not like your selfe: you
    appear'd to me but as a common man; witnesse the
    Night, your Garments, your Lowlinesse: and what
    your Highnesse suffer'd vnder that shape, I beseech you
    take it for your owne fault, and not mine: for had you
    beene as I tooke you for, I made no offence; therefore I
    beseech your Highnesse pardon me

    And giue it to this fellow. Keepe it fellow,
    And weare it for an Honor in thy Cappe,
    Till I doe challenge it. Giue him the Crownes:

    you to mend your shooes: come, wherefore should you
    be so pashfull, your shooes is not so good: 'tis a good
    silling I warrant you, or I will change it.
    Enter Herauld.

      King. Now Herauld, are the dead numbred?
      Herald. Heere is the number of the slaught'red
    French

       King. What Prisoners of good sort are taken,
    Vnckle?
      Exe. Charles Duke of Orleance, Nephew to the King,
    Iohn Duke of Burbon, and Lord Bouchiquald:
    Of other Lords and Barons, Knights and Squires,
    Full fifteene hundred, besides common men

       King. This Note doth tell me of ten thousand French
    That in the field lye slaine: of Princes in this number,
    And Nobles bearing Banners, there lye dead
    One hundred twentie six: added to these,
    Of Knights, Esquires, and gallant Gentlemen,
    Eight thousand and foure hundred: of the which,
    Fiue hundred were but yesterday dubb'd Knights.
    So that in these ten thousand they haue lost,
    There are but sixteene hundred Mercenaries:
    The rest are Princes, Barons, Lords, Knights, Squires,
    And Gentlemen of bloud and qualitie.
    The Names of those their Nobles that lye dead:
    Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France,
    Iaques of Chatilion, Admirall of France,
    The Master of the Crosse-bowes, Lord Rambures,
    Great Master of France, the braue Sir Guichard Dolphin,

    And Edward Duke of Barr: of lustie Earles,
    Grandpree and Roussie, Fauconbridge and Foyes,
    Beaumont and Marle, Vandemont and Lestrale.
    Here was a Royall fellowship of death.
    Where is the number of our English dead?
    Edward the Duke of Yorke, the Earle of Suffolke,
    Sir Richard Ketly, Dauy Gam Esquire;
    None else of name: and of all other men,
    But fiue and twentie.
    O God, thy Arme was heere:
    And not to vs, but to thy Arme alone,
    Ascribe we all: when, without stratagem,
    But in plaine shock, and euen play of Battaile,
    Was euer knowne so great and little losse?
    On one part and on th' other, take it God,
    For it is none but thine

       Exet. 'Tis wonderfull

       King. Come, goe we in procession to the Village:
    And be it death proclaymed through our Hoast,
    To boast of this, or take that prayse from God,
    Which is his onely

       Flu. Is it not lawfull and please your Maiestie, to tell
    how many is kill'd?
      King. Yes Captaine: but with this acknowledgement,
    That God fought for vs

       Flu. Yes, my conscience, he did vs great good

       King. Doe we all holy Rights:
    Let there be sung Non nobis, and Te Deum,
    The dead with charitie enclos'd in Clay:
    And then to Callice, and to England then,
    Where ne're from France arriu'd more happy men.

    Exeunt.


    Actus Quintus.

    Enter Chorus.

    Vouchsafe to those that haue not read the Story,
    That I may prompt them: and of such as haue,
    I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse
    Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,
    Which cannot in their huge and proper life,
    Be here presented. Now we beare the King
    Toward Callice: Graunt him there; there seene,
    Heaue him away vpon your winged thoughts,
    Athwart the Sea: Behold the English beach
    Pales in the flood; with Men, Wiues, and Boyes,
    Whose shouts & claps out-voyce the deep-mouth'd Sea,
    Which like a mightie Whiffler 'fore the King,
    Seemes to prepare his way: So let him land,
    And solemnly see him set on to London.
    So swift a pace hath Thought, that euen now
    You may imagine him vpon Black-Heath:
    Where, that his Lords desire him, to haue borne
    His bruised Helmet, and his bended Sword
    Before him, through the Citie: he forbids it,
    Being free from vainnesse, and selfe-glorious pride;
    Giuing full Trophee, Signall, and Ostent,
    Quite from himselfe, to God. But now behold,
    In the quick Forge and working-house of Thought,
    How London doth powre out her Citizens,
    The Maior and all his Brethren in best sort,
    Like to the Senatours of th' antique Rome,
    With the Plebeians swarming at their heeles,
    Goe forth and fetch their Conqu'ring Cæsar in:
    As by a lower, but by louing likelyhood,
    Were now the Generall of our gracious Empresse,
    As in good time he may, from Ireland comming,
    Bringing Rebellion broached on his Sword;
    How many would the peacefull Citie quit,
    To welcome him? much more, and much more cause,
    Did they this Harry. Now in London place him.
    As yet the lamentation of the French
    Inuites the King of Englands stay at home:
    The Emperour's comming in behalfe of France,
    To order peace betweene them: and omit
    All the occurrences, what euer chanc't,
    Till Harryes backe returne againe to France:
    There must we bring him; and my selfe haue play'd
    The interim, by remembring you 'tis past.
    Then brooke abridgement, and your eyes aduance,
    After your thoughts, straight backe againe to France.
    Enter.

    Enter Fluellen and Gower.

      Gower. Nay, that's right: but why weare you your
    Leeke to day? S[aint]. Dauies day is past

       Flu. There is occasions and causes why and wherefore
    in all things: I will tell you asse my friend, Captaine
    Gower; the rascally, scauld, beggerly, lowsie, pragging
    Knaue Pistoll, which you and your selfe, and all the World,
    know to be no petter then a fellow, looke you now, of no
    merits: hee is come to me, and prings me pread and
    sault yesterday, looke you, and bid me eate my Leeke:
    it was in a place where I could not breed no contention
    with him; but I will be so bold as to weare it in my Cap
    till I see him once againe, and then I will tell him a little
    piece of my desires.
    Enter Pistoll.

      Gower. Why heere hee comes, swelling like a Turkycock

       Flu. 'Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his Turkycocks.
    God plesse you aunchient Pistoll: you scuruie lowsie
    Knaue, God plesse you

       Pist. Ha, art thou bedlam? doest thou thirst, base
    Troian, to haue me fold vp Parcas fatall Web? Hence;
    I am qualmish at the smell of Leeke

       Flu. I peseech you heartily, scuruie lowsie Knaue, at
    my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eate,
    looke you, this Leeke; because, looke you, you doe not
    loue it, nor your affections, and your appetites and your
    disgestions doo's not agree with it, I would desire you
    to eate it

       Pist. Not for Cadwallader and all his Goats

       Flu. There is one Goat for you.

     Strikes him.

    Will you be so good, scauld Knaue, as eate it?
      Pist. Base Troian, thou shalt dye

       Flu. You say very true, scauld Knaue, when Gods
    will is: I will desire you to liue in the meane time, and
    eate your Victuals: come, there is sawce for it. You
    call'd me yesterday Mountaine-Squier, but I will make
    you to day a squire of low degree. I pray you fall too, if
    you can mocke a Leeke, you can eate a Leeke

       Gour. Enough Captaine, you haue astonisht him

       Flu. I say, I will make him eate some part of my leeke,
    or I will peate his pate foure dayes: bite I pray you, it is
    good for your greene wound, and your ploodie Coxecombe

       Pist. Must I bite

       Flu. Yes certainly, and out of doubt and out of question
    too, and ambiguities

       Pist. By this Leeke, I will most horribly reuenge I
    eate and eate I sweare

       Flu. Eate I pray you, will you haue some more sauce
    to your Leeke: there is not enough Leeke to sweare by

       Pist. Quiet thy Cudgell, thou dost see I eate

       Flu. Much good do you scald knaue, heartily. Nay,
    pray you throw none away, the skinne is good for your
    broken Coxcombe; when you take occasions to see
    Leekes heereafter, I pray you mocke at 'em, that is all

       Pist. Good

       Flu. I, Leekes is good: hold you, there is a groat to
    heale your pate

       Pist. Me a groat?
      Flu. Yes verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I haue
    another Leeke in my pocket, which you shall eate

       Pist. I take thy groat in earnest of reuenge

       Flu. If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in Cudgels,
    you shall be a Woodmonger, and buy nothing of
    me but cudgels: God bu'y you, and keepe you, & heale
    your pate.

    Exit

      Pist. All hell shall stirre for this

       Gow. Go, go, you are a counterfeit cowardly Knaue,
    will you mocke at an ancient Tradition began vppon an
    honourable respect, and worne as a memorable Trophee
    of predeceased valor, and dare not auouch in your deeds
    any of your words. I haue seene you gleeking & galling
    at this Gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because
    he could not speake English in the natiue garb, he could
    not therefore handle an English Cudgell: you finde it otherwise,
    and henceforth let a Welsh correction, teach
    you a good English condition, fare ye well.

    Exit

      Pist. Doeth fortune play the huswife with me now?
    Newes haue I that my Doll is dead i'th Spittle of a malady
    of France, and there my rendeuous is quite cut off:
    Old I do waxe, and from my wearie limbes honour is
    Cudgeld. Well, Baud Ile turne, and something leane to
    Cut-purse of quicke hand: To England will I steale, and
    there Ile steale:
    And patches will I get vnto these cudgeld scarres,
    And swore I got them in the Gallia warres.
    Enter.

    Enter at one doore, King Henry, Exeter, Bedford, Warwicke, and
    other
    Lords. At another, Queene Isabel, the King, the Duke of
    Bourgougne, and
    other French.

      King. Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met;
    Vnto our brother France, and to our Sister
    Health and faire time of day: Ioy and good wishes
    To our most faire and Princely Cosine Katherine:
    And as a branch and member of this Royalty,
    By whom this great assembly is contriu'd,
    We do salute you Duke of Burgogne,
    And Princes French and Peeres health to you all

       Fra. Right ioyous are we to behold your face,
    Most worthy brother England, fairely met,
    So are you Princes (English) euery one

       Quee. So happy be the Issue brother Ireland
    Of this good day, and of this gracious meeting,
    As we are now glad to behold your eyes,
    Your eyes which hitherto haue borne
    In them against the French that met them in their bent,
    The fatall Balls of murthering Basiliskes:
    The venome of such Lookes we fairely hope
    Haue lost their qualitie, and that this day
    Shall change all griefes and quarrels into loue

       Eng. To cry Amen to that, thus we appeare

       Quee. You English Princes all, I doe salute you

       Burg. My dutie to you both, on equall loue.
    Great Kings of France and England: that I haue labour'd
    With all my wits, my paines, and strong endeuors,
    To bring your most Imperiall Maiesties
    Vnto this Barre, and Royall enterview;
    Your Mightinesse on both parts best can witnesse.
    Since then my Office hath so farre preuayl'd,
    That Face to Face, and Royall Eye to Eye,
    You haue congreeted: let it not disgrace me,
    If I demand before this Royall view,
    What Rub, or what Impediment there is,
    Why that the naked, poore, and mangled Peace,
    Deare Nourse of Arts, Plentyes, and ioyfull Births,
    Should not in this best Garden of the World,
    Our fertile France, put vp her louely Visage?
    Alas, shee hath from France too long been chas'd,
    And all her Husbandry doth lye on heapes,
    Corrupting in it owne fertilitie.
    Her Vine, the merry chearer of the heart,
    Vnpruned, dyes: her Hedges euen pleach'd,
    Like Prisoners wildly ouer-growne with hayre,
    Put forth disorder'd Twigs: her fallow Leas,
    The Darnell, Hemlock, and ranke Femetary,
    Doth root vpon; while that the Culter rusts,
    That should deracinate such Sauagery:
    The euen Meade, that erst brought sweetly forth
    The freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and greene Clouer,
    Wanting the Sythe, withall vncorrected, ranke;
    Conceiues by idlenesse, and nothing teemes,
    But hatefull Docks, rough Thistles, Keksyes, Burres,
    Loosing both beautie and vtilitie;
    And all our Vineyards, Fallowes, Meades, and Hedges,
    Defectiue in their natures, grow to wildnesse.
    Euen so our Houses, and our selues, and Children,
    Haue lost, or doe not learne, for want of time,
    The Sciences that should become our Countrey;
    But grow like Sauages, as Souldiers will,
    That nothing doe, but meditate on Blood,
    To Swearing, and sterne Lookes, defus'd Attyre,
    And euery thing that seemes vnnaturall.
    Which to reduce into our former fauour,
    You are assembled: and my speech entreats,
    That I may know the Let, why gentle Peace
    Should not expell these inconueniences,
    And blesse vs with her former qualities

       Eng. If Duke of Burgonie, you would the Peace,
    Whose want giues growth to th' imperfections
    Which you haue cited; you must buy that Peace
    With full accord to all our iust demands,
    Whose Tenures and particular effects
    You haue enschedul'd briefely in your hands

       Burg. The King hath heard them: to the which, as yet
    There is no Answer made

       Eng. Well then: the Peace which you before so vrg'd,
    Lyes in his Answer

       France. I haue but with a curselarie eye
    O're-glanc't the Articles: Pleaseth your Grace
    To appoint some of your Councell presently
    To sit with vs once more, with better heed
    To re-suruey them; we will suddenly
    Passe our accept and peremptorie Answer

       England. Brother we shall. Goe Vnckle Exeter,
    And Brother Clarence, and you Brother Gloucester,
    Warwick, and Huntington, goe with the King,
    And take with you free power, to ratifie,
    Augment, or alter, as your Wisdomes best
    Shall see aduantageable for our Dignitie,
    Any thing in or out of our Demands,
    And wee'le consigne thereto. Will you, faire Sister,
    Goe with the Princes, or stay here with vs?
      Quee. Our gracious Brother, I will goe with them:
    Happily a Womans Voyce may doe some good,
    When Articles too nicely vrg'd, be stood on

       England. Yet leaue our Cousin Katherine here with vs,
    She is our capitall Demand, compris'd
    Within the fore-ranke of our Articles

       Quee. She hath good leaue.

    Exeunt. omnes.

    Manet King and Katherine

       King. Faire Katherine, and most faire,
    Will you vouchsafe to teach a Souldier tearmes,
    Such as will enter at a Ladyes eare,
    And pleade his Loue-suit to her gentle heart

       Kath. Your Maiestie shall mock at me, I cannot speake
    your England

       King. O faire Katherine, if you will loue me soundly
    with your French heart, I will be glad to heare you confesse
    it brokenly with your English Tongue. Doe you
    like me, Kate?
      Kath. Pardonne moy, I cannot tell wat is like me

       King. An Angell is like you Kate, and you are like an
    Angell

       Kath. Que dit il que Ie suis semblable a les Anges?
      Lady. Ouy verayment (sauf vostre Grace) ainsi dit il

       King. I said so, deare Katherine, and I must not blush
    to affirme it

       Kath. O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont plein de
    tromperies

       King. What sayes she, faire one? that the tongues of
    men are full of deceits?
      Lady. Ouy, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits:
    dat is de Princesse

       King. The Princesse is the better English-woman:
    yfaith Kate, my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding, I am
    glad thou canst speake no better English, for if thou
    could'st, thou would'st finde me such a plaine King, that
    thou wouldst thinke, I had sold my Farme to buy my
    Crowne. I know no wayes to mince it in loue, but directly
    to say, I loue you; then if you vrge me farther,
    then to say, Doe you in faith? I weare out my suite: Giue
    me your answer, yfaith doe, and so clap hands, and a bargaine:
    how say you, Lady?
      Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, me vnderstand well

       King. Marry, if you would put me to Verses, or to
    Dance for your sake, Kate, why you vndid me: for the one
    I haue neither words nor measure; and for the other, I
    haue no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in
    strength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape-frogge, or by
    vawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe;
    vnder the correction of bragging be it spoken. I should
    quickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might buffet for my
    Loue, or bound my Horse for her fauours, I could lay on
    like a Butcher, and sit like a Iack an Apes, neuer off. But
    before God Kate, I cannot looke greenely, nor gaspe out
    my eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in protestation;
    onely downe-right Oathes, which I neuer vse till vrg'd,
    nor neuer breake for vrging. If thou canst loue a fellow
    of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth Sunne-burning?
    that neuer lookes in his Glasse, for loue of any
    thing he sees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I speake
    to thee plaine Souldier: If thou canst loue me for this,
    take me? if not? to say to thee that I shall dye, is true; but
    for thy loue, by the L[ord]. No: yet I loue thee too. And
    while thou liu'st, deare Kate, take a fellow of plaine and
    vncoyned Constancie, for he perforce must do thee right,
    because he hath not the gift to wooe in other places: for
    these fellowes of infinit tongue, that can ryme themselues
    into Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes reason themselues
    out againe. What? a speaker is but a prater, a Ryme is
    but a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a strait Backe will
    stoope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl'd Pate will
    grow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax
    hollow: but a good Heart, Kate, is the Sunne and the
    Moone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it
    shines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his course
    truly. If thou would haue such a one, take me? and
    take me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King.
    And what say'st thou then to my Loue? speake my faire,
    and fairely, I pray thee

       Kath. Is it possible dat I sould loue de ennemie of
    Fraunce?
      King. No, it is not possible you should loue the Enemie
    of France, Kate; but in louing me, you should loue
    the Friend of France: for I loue France so well, that I
    will not part with a Village of it; I will haue it all mine:
    and Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours; then yours
    is France, and you are mine

       Kath. I cannot tell wat is dat

       King. No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am
    sure will hang vpon my tongue, like a new-married Wife
    about her Husbands Necke, hardly to be shooke off; Ie
    quand sur le possession de Fraunce, & quand vous aues le
    possession
    de moy. (Let mee see, what then? Saint Dennis bee
    my speede) Donc vostre est Fraunce, & vous estes mienne.
    It is as easie for me, Kate, to conquer the Kingdome, as to
    speake so much more French: I shall neuer moue thee in
    French, vnlesse it be to laugh at me

       Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, le Francois ques vous parleis, il
    & melieus que l' Anglois le quel Ie parle

       King. No faith is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of
    my Tongue, and I thine, most truely falsely, must
    needes be graunted to be much at one. But Kate, doo'st
    thou vnderstand thus much English? Canst thou loue
    mee?
      Kath. I cannot tell

       King. Can any of your Neighbours tell, Kate? Ile
    aske them. Come, I know thou louest me: and at night,
    when you come into your Closet, you'le question this
    Gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to
    her disprayse those parts in me, that you loue with your
    heart: but good Kate, mocke me mercifully, the rather
    gentle Princesse, because I loue thee cruelly. If euer thou
    beest mine, Kate, as I haue a sauing Faith within me tells
    me thou shalt; I get thee with skambling, and thou
    must therefore needes proue a good Souldier-breeder:
    Shall not thou and I, betweene Saint Dennis and Saint
    George, compound a Boy, halfe French halfe English,
    that shall goe to Constantinople, and take the Turke by
    the Beard. Shall wee not? what say'st thou, my faire
    Flower-de-Luce

       Kate. I doe not know dat

       King. No: 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise:
    doe but now promise Kate, you will endeauour for your
    French part of such a Boy; and for my English moytie,
    take the Word of a King, and a Batcheler. How answer
    you. La plus belle Katherine du monde mon trescher & deuin
    deesse

       Kath. Your Maiestee aue fause Frenche enough to
    deceiue de most sage Damoiseil dat is en Fraunce

       King. Now fye vpon my false French: by mine Honor
    in true English, I loue thee Kate; by which Honor, I dare
    not sweare thou louest me, yet my blood begins to flatter
    me, that thou doo'st; notwithstanding the poore and
    vntempering effect of my Visage. Now beshrew my
    Fathers Ambition, hee was thinking of Ciuill Warres
    when hee got me, therefore was I created with a stubborne
    out-side, with an aspect of Iron, that when I come
    to wooe Ladyes, I fright them: but in faith Kate, the elder
    I wax, the better I shall appeare. My comfort is, that
    Old Age, that ill layer vp of Beautie, can doe no more
    spoyle vpon my Face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at
    the worst; and thou shalt weare me, if thou weare me,
    better and better: and therefore tell me, most faire Katherine,
    will you haue me? Put off your Maiden Blushes,
    auouch the Thoughts of your Heart with the Lookes of
    an Empresse, take me by the Hand, and say, Harry of
    England, I am thine: which Word thou shalt no sooner
    blesse mine Eare withall, but I will tell thee alowd, England
    is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry
    Plantaginet is thine; who, though I speake it before his
    Face, if he be not Fellow with the best King, thou shalt
    finde the best King of Good-fellowes. Come your Answer
    in broken Musick; for thy Voyce is Musick, and
    thy English broken: Therefore Queene of all, Katherine,
    breake thy minde to me in broken English; wilt thou
    haue me?
      Kath. Dat is as it shall please de Roy mon pere

       King. Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please
    him, Kate

       Kath. Den it sall also content me

       King. Vpon that I kisse your Hand, and I call you my
    Queene

       Kath. Laisse mon Seigneur, laisse, laisse, may foy: Ie ne
    veus point que vous abbaisse vostre grandeus, en baisant le
    main d' une nostre Seigneur indignie seruiteur excuse moy. Ie
    vous supplie mon tres-puissant Seigneur

       King. Then I will kisse your Lippes, Kate

       Kath. Les Dames & Damoisels pour estre baisee deuant
    leur nopcese il net pas le costume de Fraunce

       King. Madame, my Interpreter, what sayes shee?
      Lady. Dat it is not be de fashon pour le Ladies of
    Fraunce; I cannot tell wat is buisse en Anglish

       King. To kisse

       Lady. Your Maiestee entendre bettre que moy

       King. It is not a fashion for the Maids in Fraunce to
    kisse before they are marryed, would she say?
      Lady. Ouy verayment

       King. O Kate, nice Customes cursie to great Kings.
    Deare Kate, you and I cannot bee confin'd within the
    weake Lyst of a Countreyes fashion: wee are the makers
    of Manners, Kate; and the libertie that followes
    our Places, stoppes the mouth of all finde-faults, as I
    will doe yours, for vpholding the nice fashion of your
    Countrey, in denying me a Kisse: therefore patiently,
    and yeelding. You haue Witch-craft in your Lippes,
    Kate: there is more eloquence in a Sugar touch of
    them, then in the Tongues of the French Councell; and
    they should sooner perswade Harry of England, then a
    generall Petition of Monarchs. Heere comes your
    Father.
    Enter the French Power, and the English Lords.

      Burg. God saue your Maiestie, my Royall Cousin,
    teach you our Princesse English?
      King. I would haue her learne, my faire Cousin, how
    perfectly I loue her, and that is good English

       Burg. Is shee not apt?
      King. Our Tongue is rough, Coze, and my Condition
    is not smooth: so that hauing neyther the Voyce nor
    the Heart of Flatterie about me, I cannot so coniure vp
    the Spirit of Loue in her, that hee will appeare in his true
    likenesse

       Burg. Pardon the franknesse of my mirth, if I answer
    you for that. If you would coniure in her, you must
    make a Circle: if coniure vp Loue in her in his true
    likenesse, hee must appeare naked, and blinde. Can you
    blame her then, being a Maid, yet ros'd ouer with the
    Virgin Crimson of Modestie, if shee deny the apparance
    of a naked blinde Boy in her naked seeing selfe? It were
    (my Lord) a hard Condition for a Maid to consigne
    to

       King. Yet they doe winke and yeeld, as Loue is blind
    and enforces

       Burg. They are then excus'd, my Lord, when they see
    not what they doe

       King. Then good my Lord, teach your Cousin to
    consent winking

       Burg. I will winke on her to consent, my Lord, if you
    will teach her to know my meaning: for Maides well
    Summer'd, and warme kept, are like Flyes at Bartholomew-tyde,
    blinde, though they haue their eyes, and then
    they will endure handling, which before would not abide
    looking on

       King. This Morall tyes me ouer to Time, and a hot
    Summer; and so I shall catch the Flye, your Cousin, in
    the latter end, and she must be blinde to

       Burg. As Loue is my Lord, before it loues

       King. It is so: and you may, some of you, thanke
    Loue for my blindnesse, who cannot see many a faire
    French Citie for one faire French Maid that stands in my
    way

       French King. Yes my Lord, you see them perspectiuely:
    the Cities turn'd into a Maid; for they are
    all gyrdled with Maiden Walls, that Warre hath entred

       England. Shall Kate be my Wife?
      France. So please you

       England. I am content, so the Maiden Cities you
    talke of, may wait on her: so the Maid that stood in
    the way for my Wish, shall shew me the way to my
    Will

       France. Wee haue consented to all tearmes of reason

       England. Is't so, my Lords of England?
      West. The King hath graunted euery Article:
    His Daughter first; and in sequele, all,
    According to their firme proposed natures

       Exet. Onely he hath not yet subscribed this:
    Where your Maiestie demands, That the King of France
    hauing any occasion to write for matter of Graunt, shall
    name your Highnesse in this forme, and with this addition,
    in French: Nostre trescher filz Henry Roy d' Angleterre
    Heretere de Fraunce: and thus in Latine; Praeclarissimus
    Filius noster Henricus Rex Angliæ & Heres Franciae

       France. Nor this I haue not Brother so deny'd,
    But your request shall make me let it passe

       England. I pray you then, in loue and deare allyance,
    Let that one Article ranke with the rest,
    And thereupon giue me your Daughter

       France. Take her faire Sonne, and from her blood rayse vp
    Issue to me, that the contending Kingdomes
    Of France and England, whose very shoares looke pale,
    With enuy of each others happinesse,
    May cease their hatred; and this deare Coniunction
    Plant Neighbour-hood and Christian-like accord
    In their sweet Bosomes: that neuer Warre aduance
    His bleeding Sword 'twixt England and faire France

       Lords. Amen

       King. Now welcome Kate: and beare me witnesse all,
    That here I kisse her as my Soueraigne Queene.

    Flourish.

      Quee. God, the best maker of all Marriages,
    Combine your hearts in one, your Realmes in one:
    As Man and Wife being two, are one in loue,
    So be there 'twixt your Kingdomes such a Spousall,
    That neuer may ill Office, or fell Iealousie,
    Which troubles oft the Bed of blessed Marriage,
    Thrust in betweene the Paction of these Kingdomes,
    To make diuorce of their incorporate League:
    That English may as French, French Englishmen,
    Receiue each other. God speake this Amen

       All. Amen

       King. Prepare we for our Marriage: on which day,
    My Lord of Burgundy wee'le take your Oath
    And all the Peeres, for suretie of our Leagues.
    Then shall I sweare to Kate, and you to me,
    And may our Oathes well kept and prosp'rous be.

    Senet. Exeunt.

    Enter Chorus.

    Thus farre with rough, and all-vnable Pen,
    Our bending Author hath pursu'd the Story,
    In little roome confining mightie men,
    Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
    Small time: but in that small, most greatly liued
    This Starre of England. Fortune made his Sword;
    By which, the Worlds best Garden he atchieued:
    And of it left his Sonne Imperiall Lord.
    Henry the Sixt, in Infant Bands crown'd King
    Of France and England, did this King succeed:
    Whose State so many had the managing,
    That they lost France, and made his England bleed:
    Which oft our Stage hath showne; and for their sake,
    In your faire minds let this acceptance take.

    FINIS. The Life of Henry the Fift.
