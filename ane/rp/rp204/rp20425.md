### THE DEDICATION OF THREE BABYLONIANS TO DIVINE SERVICE

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> woman Ummu-dhabat, <span
id="fr_417"></span>[1](#fn_414.md) the daughter of Nebo-bil-utsur, the wife
of Samas-yuballidh, the son of Bel-Ê-Babara the priest of <span
class="smallcaps">Samas</span>, <span id="fr_418"></span>[2](#fn_415.md)
who has brought a tablet to him, <span id="fr_419"></span>[3](#fn_416.md)
and also Samas-edhir, Nidittuv, and Arad-Kin, <span
id="fr_420"></span>[4](#fn_417.md) her sons \[three in number <span
id="fr_421"></span>[5](#fn_418)\], (and.md) who has spoken as follows to
Bel-yuballidh, the priest of <span
class="smallcaps">Sippara</span>: <span id="fr_422"></span>[6](#fn_419.md)
"They have not (yet) entered the House of the Males; with my sons I have
lived; with my sons I have grown (old) since they were little, <span
id="fr_423"></span>[7](#fn_420.md) until they have been counted among the
men"; on the day when Ummu-dhabat \[has said this\], may she enter the
House of the Males, according to <span id="fr_424"></span>[8](#fn_421.md)
the writing of the document which (is) before Bel-yuballidh the priest
of <span class="smallcaps">Sippara</span> for Samas-edhir, Nidittuv,
\[and Arad-Kin\]

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

her \[three\] sons she gives to \[the service of the Sun-\] god. The
witnesses are: Nebo-zira-yukin the son of Bel-\[natsir\] the son of
Mukallim, Bel-natsir the son of Samas-yuballidh; Nebo-\[musetiq-udda\]
the son of Tsillâ; Rimut the son of Musezib-Bel, the son of Babutu; \[…
the son\] of Bel-yukin, the son of Rimmon-yumê: (dated) \[<span
class="smallcaps">Sippara</span> <span id="fr_425"></span>[1](#fn_422.md)\]
the 21st day of the month Nisan, the fifth year of Kambyses, king of
<span class="smallcaps">Babylon</span>, the king of the world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_414"></span>[112:1](rp20425.htm#fr_417.md) The name signifies
"The mother is good."

<span id="fn_415"></span>[112:2](rp20425.htm#fr_418.md) The Sun-god, the
presiding deity of Sippara, where the great temple of E-Babara, or
E-Parra, was dedicated to him.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[112:3](rp20425.htm#fr_419.md) Among a literary
and business-like people like the Babylonians no act was valid unless
embodied in writing, and drawn up according to the legal forms.
Consequently a mere verbal declaration, as in the case of Hannah, was
not sufficient; it had to be accompanied by the prescribed legal
document with the names of the witnesses attached to it.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[112:4](rp20425.htm#fr_420.md) "The servant of
Kin." The triad or trinity of deities worshipped at Sippara consisted of
Samas, A (who, in the Semitic period, was regarded as the wife of the
Sun-god), and Kin (perhaps the son of Samas and A). The reading of the
last name is doubtful, and may be Khur.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[112:5](rp20425.htm#fr_421.md) The traces of the
characters given by Dr. Strassmaier show that this must be the reading
(*sal-si anna*).

<span id="fn_419"></span>[112:6](rp20425.htm#fr_422.md) Sippara, written
Sippar in the cuneiform, the Sepharvaim or "two Sipparas" of the Old
Testament (2 Kings xvii. 31, etc.), is now represented by the mounds of
Abu Habba and Anbar (?). It consisted of two cities, one known as
"Sippara of Samas," and the other as "Sippara of Anunit."

<span id="fn_420"></span>[112:7](rp20425.htm#fr_423.md) ’Sikhurrutû.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[112:8](rp20425.htm#fr_424.md) We must read *akî*
instead of *adî*.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[113:1](rp20425.htm#fr_425.md) The characters are
illegible here, but the fact that Ummu-dhabat appeared before the priest
of Sippara shows that we must supply the name of that city.
