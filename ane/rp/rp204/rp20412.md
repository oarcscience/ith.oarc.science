### THE MONOLITH INSCRIPTION OF SHALMANESER II

#### <span class="smallcaps">Translated by the Rev. V. Scheil.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> inscription of which a translation is
here given is engraved on a monolith found at Kurkh, and now in the
British Museum. Kurkh, which is probably the Karkathiokerta of classical
geography, is upon the right bank of the Tigris, about 20 miles to the
south of Diarbekir. The monument was erected to commemorate the exploits
of the Assyrian king, Shalmaneser II, during the first four and a half
years of his reign (B.C. 858–854). It gives in detail an account of the
campaigns which are briefly noticed in the annals of the Black Obelisk.

The inscription has been translated by Ménant in the *Annales des Rois
d’Assyrie* (1874), pp. 1051–113; by Sayce in the *Records of the Past*,
1st series, iii. pp. 81-100 (1874); by Craig in Hebraica, iii. pp. 201
sqq. (i 887); and by Peiser in the *Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek*, i.
pp. 151-175 (1889). The geographical and historical information
contained in it makes it a peculiarly valuable document, especially when
studied in connection with the inscription of the Black

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Obelisk, and the
long standard inscription of Assur-natsir-pal. It contains the first
mention found in an Assyrian text of an Israelitish king, and proves
that the death of Ahab could not have taken place until after B.C. 854.
