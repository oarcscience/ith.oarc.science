### HYMN TO <span class="smallcaps">Osiris</span>

1\. Adoration to <span class="smallcaps">Osiris</span> by the
superintendent of the oxen, Amon-em-ha son of the lady Nofri-t-ari. He
says: Homage to thee, <span class="smallcaps">Osiris</span>, lord of
eternity, king of the gods with the thousand names, <span
id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) with the sacred existences, <span
id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_66.md) with the secret acts <span
id="fr_67"></span>[3](#fn_67.md) in the temples; he is rich in *Ka* <span
id="fr_68"></span>[4](#fn_68.md) in <span
class="smallcaps">Tattu</span>, <span id="fr_69"></span>[5](#fn_69.md)
holding property <span id="fr_70"></span>[6](#fn_70.md)

2\. in <span class="smallcaps">Sokhem</span>, <span
id="fr_71"></span>[7](#fn_71.md) master of the sacred dances <span
id="fr_72"></span>[8](#fn_72.md) in <span class="smallcaps">Busiris</span>,
prince of abundance <span id="fr_73"></span>[9](#fn_73.md) in On, <span
id="fr_74"></span>[10](#fn_74.md) master of remembrance in <span
class="smallcaps">Mati</span>, <span id="fr_75"></span>[11](#fn_75.md)
hidden soul, master of <span class="smallcaps">Kerer</span>, <span
id="fr_76"></span>[12](#fn_76.md) venerated in the <span
class="smallcaps">Memphite</span> nome; <span
id="fr_77"></span>[13](#fn_77.md) the soul whose body itself is <span
class="smallcaps">Ra</span>, who reposes in

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

3\. <span class="smallcaps">Hnes</span>; <span
id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md) dispensing benefits <span
id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_79.md) in <span
class="smallcaps">Nart</span>, <span id="fr_80"></span>[3](#fn_80.md) when
his soul awakens, master of the great dwelling of <span
class="smallcaps">Shmun</span>, <span id="fr_81"></span>[4](#fn_81.md) very
valiant <span id="fr_82"></span>[5](#fn_82.md) in <span
class="smallcaps">Shashotep</span>, <span id="fr_83"></span>[6](#fn_83.md)
lord of eternity, the first in <span class="smallcaps">Abydos</span>;
distant is his domain in <span class="smallcaps">To-Sar</span>, <span
id="fr_84"></span>[7](#fn_84.md) stable is

4\. his name in the mouth of mankind; he who contains the double ennead
of the double land; <span class="smallcaps">Tum</span> who nourishes the
doubles, first of the divine ennead, perfect ghost among the
ghosts. <span id="fr_85"></span>[8](#fn_85.md) The <span
class="smallcaps">Nu</span> <span id="fr_86"></span>[9](#fn_86.md) has
procured for him his water, <span id="fr_87"></span>[10](#fn_87.md) the
wind of the north has brought him food, <span
id="fr_88"></span>[11](#fn_88.md) the air enters his nostrils, to refresh
his heart,

5\. to strengthen his heart. <span id="fr_89"></span>[12](#fn_89.md) The
soil has produced for him provisions, the vault of heaven has
brought <span id="fr_90"></span>[13](#fn_90.md) unto him its stars; the
wide gates open for him, the master of acclamations in the southern sky,
of adorations in the northern sky. The indestructible ones

6\. are under the place of his face, the immortals are his abodes. <span
id="fr_91"></span>[14](#fn_91.md) When he has gone forth in peace by the

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

order of <span class="smallcaps">Seb</span>, the divine ennead adores
him, the inhabitants of the *tuau* <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md)
prostrate themselves to the ground, the mighty <span
id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_93.md) bow the head, the ancestors <span
id="fr_94"></span>[3](#fn_94.md) are in prayer.

7\. When they beheld him, the august dead <span
id="fr_95"></span>[4](#fn_95.md) submit to him, the two lands
together <span id="fr_96"></span>[5](#fn_96.md) unite to render glory to
him, marching before his majesty. Glorious noble among the nobles <span
id="fr_97"></span>[6](#fn_97.md) from whom proceeds \[all\] dignity, who
establishes supreme authority, <span id="fr_98"></span>[7](#fn_98.md)
excellent chief of the ennead of the gods, with charming aspect,

8\. beloved of him who has contemplated him, extending his terror
through all countries that they may proclaim his name before all
others. <span id="fr_99"></span>[8](#fn_99.md) All make offerings unto him,
even to him the master whose memory (is eternal) in heaven as on the
earth. Manifold are the shouts during the festival of Uaga <span
id="fr_100"></span>[9](#fn_100.md); the two lands are united to celebrate
the funeral dances. <span id="fr_101"></span>[10](#fn_101.md)

9\. The great prince, eldest of his brothers, the chiefs <span
id="fr_102"></span>[11](#fn_102.md) of the divine enneads, who establishes
the truth in the

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

double land, who seats the son on the throne of his father, the
favourite of his father <span class="smallcaps">Seb</span>, the beloved
of his mother <span class="smallcaps">Nut</span>; very valiant, he
overthrows the impious; strong of arm, he immolates

10\. his adversary, breathing terror upon his enemies, conquering the
distant frontiers of the wicked. <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103.md)
Firm of heart, his feet are vigilant. Flesh <span
id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_104.md) of <span class="smallcaps">Seb</span>,
royalty <span id="fr_105"></span>[3](#fn_105.md) of the two lands, \[<span
class="smallcaps">Seb</span>\] contemplates his benefits, he has ordered
him to govern

11\. \[all\] countries to assure their prosperity. <span
id="fr_106"></span>[4](#fn_106.md) He has fashioned this earth with his
hand, \[with\] its waters, its atmosphere, its vegetation, all its large
cattle, all its wild birds, all its domesticated birds, <span
id="fr_107"></span>[5](#fn_107.md) its reptiles and its game.

12\. The desert carries its tribute to the son of <span
class="smallcaps">Nut</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span> is
happy when it sees him appear on the throne of his father. Like <span
class="smallcaps">Ra</span> he rises on the horizon, he creates light on
the face of the darkness; he has illuminated <span
class="smallcaps">Shu</span> <span id="fr_108"></span>[6](#fn_108.md) by
the help of his two feathers, he has inundated the earth like

13\. the (solar) disk at dawn. His white crown pierces the vault of
heaven fraternising with the stars, guides <span
id="fr_109"></span>[7](#fn_109.md) of all the gods. Accomplished are the
commands of his voice; \[for he is the\] favourite of the great ennead,
the chosen of the small divine ennead. His sister has saved him,
scattering the rebels,

34\. repelling <span id="fr_110"></span>[8](#fn_110.md) evil, uttering the
word with the incantations <span id="fr_111"></span>[9](#fn_111.md)

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

of her mouth. Expert is her tongue, voice is not wanting to her, and her
speech is effectual. \[For she is\] <span class="smallcaps">Isis</span>
the charmer, the avenger of her brother, who seeks him without failing,

15\. who traverses this earth with lamentations, without resting <span
id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) before she has found him, creating the
light with her feathers, producing the wind with her wings, celebrating
the sacred dances and depositing her brother in the tomb,

16\. raising <span id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_113.md) the remains of the
god with the immovable heart; <span id="fr_114"></span>[3](#fn_114.md)
inhaling his seed, making flesh, <span id="fr_115"></span>[4](#fn_115.md)
suckling the infant <span id="fr_116"></span>[5](#fn_116.md) in solitude
without any knowing where he is. <span id="fr_117"></span>[6](#fn_117.md)
She makes him grow, his arm becomes strong in the great dwelling

17\. of <span class="smallcaps">Seb</span>. The divine ennead rejoices,
when the son of <span class="smallcaps">Osiris</span> comes, even <span
class="smallcaps">Horus</span> <span id="fr_118"></span>[7](#fn_118.md)
with the firm heart, with the just voice, <span
id="fr_119"></span>[8](#fn_119.md) the son of <span
class="smallcaps">Isis</span>, the flesh of <span
class="smallcaps">Osiris</span>. He has assembled the chiefs of
truth, <span id="fr_120"></span>[9](#fn_120.md) the divine ennead, \[he\]
himself the universal master. <span id="fr_121"></span>[10](#fn_121.md) The
lords of truth collected there

18\. cast sin afar from them, <span id="fr_122"></span>[11](#fn_122.md)
seated in the vast dwelling-place of <span class="smallcaps">Seb</span>,
to establish the dignity of him who is their master, the royalty of
justice who resides there. <span class="smallcaps">Horus</span> has been
found of just voice; to him has been given the office of his father. The
diadem has come to him by the order of <span
class="smallcaps">Seb</span>;

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

19\. he has assumed the dominion of the double land, the white crown
being established on his head. He has valued <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md) the earth with all it contains; heaven
and earth are under the place of his face; <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md) \[<span class="smallcaps">Seb</span>\]
has made him command mankind, the spirits, <span
id="fr_125"></span>[3](#fn_125.md) the race of the men of <span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>, the <span
class="smallcaps">Ha-neb-u</span>. <span id="fr_126"></span>[4](#fn_126.md)
The circle

20\. of the solar disk is under his orders, winds, river, inundation,
fruit trees <span id="fr_127"></span>[5](#fn_127.md) as well as all the
annual plants.

As the god <span class="smallcaps">Nepri</span> <span
id="fr_128"></span>[6](#fn_128.md) he makes all his herbage, the wealth of
the soil, to grow; he ascends and all are satiated; he spreads <span
id="fr_129"></span>[7](#fn_129.md) himself through all lands.

21\. All that exists breathes; (all) hearts are happy, (all) breasts
rejoice. Every being invokes him, every man adores his beauties.
Delightful for us is his love; his grace environs the heart; great is
his love in all the reins. One offers

22 unto the son of <span class="smallcaps">Isis</span> his enemy
overthrown by his vigour. The author of evil pronounces magical words
and displays his power in his turn; <span
id="fr_130"></span>[8](#fn_130.md) \[but\] the son of Isis makes his way
unto him, he avenges his father, sanctifying and honouring <span
id="fr_131"></span>[9](#fn_131.md) his name. Terror is calmed;

23\. her domain is extended, is strengthened according to the laws which
he <span id="fr_132"></span>[10](#fn_132.md) dictates. The paths are
cleared, the roads are opened, evil flies away; the earth,

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

fertilised by its lord, teems <span id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_133.md) with
produce. Established is the truth

24\. for its master; sin is pursued; happy is thy heart, O <span
class="smallcaps">Unnofré</span>. <span id="fr_134"></span>[2](#fn_134.md)
The son of <span class="smallcaps">Isis</span> has assumed the white
crown, he has caused the authority of his father to be recognised in the
great dwelling of <span class="smallcaps">Seb</span>. <span
class="smallcaps">Ra</span> is his word, <span
class="smallcaps">Thoth</span> are his writings.

25\. The divine chiefs <span id="fr_135"></span>[3](#fn_135.md) are happy,
\[for\] what thy father <span class="smallcaps">Seb</span> has ordained
for thee, that is executed when he has spoken.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Divine oblation to <span class="smallcaps">Osiris Khent-Amenti</span> ,
lord of <span class="smallcaps">Abydos</span>, so that he may give good
funeral offerings of bread, liquids, oxen, geese, cloths, incense,
perfumes

26\. and all vegetable products; \[so that he may grant\] to grow, <span
id="fr_136"></span>[4](#fn_136.md) to take possession of the <span
class="smallcaps">Nile</span>, to appear in the form of a living soul,
to see the (solar) disk at dawn, to enter and depart by the
*ro-sta-u*; <span id="fr_137"></span>[5](#fn_137.md) so that the soul may
not be driven into the other world, but be received

27\. among those who chant in the presence of <span
class="smallcaps">Un-nofré</span> and who share in the offerings laid
upon the altar of the great god; so that it breathes the delicious
breezes of the north and drinks of the current

28\. of the river.

To the double of the superintendent of the oxen of <span
class="smallcaps">Amon</span>, Amon-mes, of the just voice, born of the
lady Hont, of the just voice, his wife who loves him \[Nofri-t-ari\].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_65"></span>[17:1](rp20407.htm#fr_65.md) Compare the epithet
''with a myriad of names" often applied to Isis by the Greeks (Plutarch:
*de Isid. et Osirid*. 53). A Greek inscription in the Louvre (No. 2)
calls her "many-named." The same expression is used of Amon.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[17:2](rp20407.htm#fr_66.md) *Kheperu* is usually
translated here "transformations." But Osiris is never transformed and
*khoper* merely signifies "to be" or "become."

<span id="fn_67"></span>[17:3](rp20407.htm#fr_67.md) *Ar-u* or *it-u* has
no determinative; it appears to refer to the ceremonies performed in the
temples rather than to the forms of the god.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[17:4](rp20407.htm#fr_68.md) The *Ka* is the double
of the individual; the gods and sometimes men themselves have several;
at Mendes Osiris doubtless had quite a series of them inherent in his
sacred statues.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[17:5](rp20407.htm#fr_69.md) Mendes.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[17:6](rp20407.htm#fr_70.md) Or perhaps, "great
nourisher."

<span id="fn_71"></span>[17:7](rp20407.htm#fr_71.md) Letopolis.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[17:8](rp20407.htm#fr_72.md) The word is several
times determined in this stele by the figure of a dancing man, so that
it must refer to dances in the temple performed in honour of the god.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[17:9](rp20407.htm#fr_73.md) Literally "provisions
of victualling."

<span id="fn_74"></span>[17:10](rp20407.htm#fr_74.md) Heliopolis, the On of
the Old Testament, the daughter of whose priest was married by Joseph.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[17:11](rp20407.htm#fr_75.md) Unidentified
locality. It is the name of the Hall of Truth where Osiris and his
assessors judge the souls of the dead.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[17:12](rp20407.htm#fr_76.md) Perhaps Paqrur,
Phagroriopolis. In the tomb of Bok-en-ranf near Saqqarah, Osiris also is
named "master of Kerer"; in the temple of Seti I. at Qurnah, Anubis has
the same title.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[17:13](rp20407.htm#fr_77.md) "The White Wall."

<span id="fn_78"></span>[18:1](rp20407.htm#fr_78.md) Herakleopolis, now the
mounds of Ahnas el-Medîneh, S.E. of the Fayoum. It is the Hanes of the
Old Testament (Isai. xxx. 4).

<span id="fn_79"></span>[18:2](rp20407.htm#fr_79.md) Literally "beneficent
in useful things": *hannu* here has no determinative.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[18:3](rp20407.htm#fr_80.md) A locality near Hanes
and often identified with the latter.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[18:4](rp20407.htm#fr_81.md) Hermopolis Magna.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[18:5](rp20407.htm#fr_82.md) Literally "great with
the double solar force."

<span id="fn_83"></span>[18:6](rp20407.htm#fr_83.md) Shotb, capital of the
Hypselite nome, S. of Assiout.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[18:7](rp20407.htm#fr_84.md) "The sacred land."

<span id="fn_85"></span>[18:8](rp20407.htm#fr_85.md) Khu, "luminous," and
hence "a magic power," often applied to the dead as having become
luminous.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[18:9](rp20407.htm#fr_86.md) The primordial water
or abyss. Compare "the deep" of Gen. i. 2.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[18:10](rp20407.htm#fr_87.md) *Khenp* is usually
rendered "to extract." But the Nu is anterior to Osiris, and therefore
gives instead of receiving his water. Moreover the construction seems to
make this explanation necessary.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[18:11](rp20407.htm#fr_88.md) *Meses*, "the night,"
more especially that which precedes the New Year, and hence the feast
which took place then in honour of Osiris (Brugsch, *Dict*., 700).

<span id="fn_89"></span>[18:12](rp20407.htm#fr_89.md) Perhaps the word I
have read *rut-u* should be decomposed into *rtu renpet-i-u*, "to give
the productions of the year (to his heart)."

<span id="fn_90"></span>[18:13](rp20407.htm#fr_90.md) Or "has submitted to
him."

<span id="fn_91"></span>[18:14](rp20407.htm#fr_91.md) The two compound
words in parellelism here, *akhim-u sek-u, akhim-u urtt-u*, have been
translated: "the fixed stars" and "the wandering stars" or planets, as
well as "stars which always remain on the horizon," and "stars which are
there only at certain hours." These distinctions are not proved; and it
is best to adhere to the literal sense of the words.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[19:1](rp20407.htm#fr_92.md) The other world, which
in Egyptian belief was not *under* the earth but beyond its limits; see
Maspero, *Revue de l’Histoire des Religions*, 1887.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[19:2](rp20407.htm#fr_93.md) The word read
*t’at’a-u* by Chabas seems to be *tes-ti-u*, "those who are exalted,"
and forms a natural antithesis to *kes-u*, "bent."

<span id="fn_94"></span>[19:3](rp20407.htm#fr_94.md) *T’er-ti-u* and not
*t’era-u* ("all"), that is the common herd of the dead, the ancestors of
men in general, in opposition to the *tes-ti-u* or "mighty."

<span id="fn_95"></span>[19:4](rp20407.htm#fr_95.md) *Nti-u am*, "those who
are below," a vague expression, euphemistic for "the dead."

<span id="fn_96"></span>[19:5](rp20407.htm#fr_96.md) Literally "in a single
place."

<span id="fn_97"></span>[19:6](rp20407.htm#fr_97.md) *Sahu* probably
denotes the higher officials.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[19:7](rp20407.htm#fr_98.md) *Hiq* is a feudal
prince, and *hiq-t* the absolute authority he possessed in his domain,
large or small, whether composed of several nomes or of less extent than
a single nome. The title is often applied to the kings, though not as
kings of all Egypt.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[19:8](rp20407.htm#fr_99.md) Literally "in
advance."

<span id="fn_100"></span>[19:9](rp20407.htm#fr_100.md) One of the great
festivals of Osiris when lamps were lit throughout Egypt (see Herodotos
ii. 62).

<span id="fn_101"></span>[19:10](rp20407.htm#fr_101.md) *Ahi* is, like
*hannu*, determined by the figure of a dancing man. As the festival was
in honour of the dead, the dances would have had a funereal character.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[19:11](rp20407.htm#fr_102.md) *Ur-u* is in the
plural, and consequently must be construed with the preceding word.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[20:1](rp20407.htm#fr_103.md) Literally, "bringing
on the frontiers," often applied to conquering kings.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[20:2](rp20407.htm#fr_104.md) Or "heir."

<span id="fn_105"></span>[20:3](rp20407.htm#fr_105.md) As in English,
abstract terms are sometimes used of persons.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[20:4](rp20407.htm#fr_106.md) Literally, "to
conduct the countries to prosperity."

<span id="fn_107"></span>[20:5](rp20407.htm#fr_107.md) *Pai* are the birds
who fly freely through the air, *khenen* those who rest, probably
therefore domestic fowls or perhaps water-fowl.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[20:6](rp20407.htm#fr_108.md) *Shu* sometimes
means "the shade," but here it seems to denote either the god Shu
himself or the space which he occupies between the earth and the sky,
uplifting, like Atlas, the celestial vault with his two arms.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[20:7](rp20407.htm#fr_109.md) *Sem-u* also
signifies "image," a sense which would suit here very well, the stars
being images or manifestations of each god. The absence of a
determinative makes a decision difficult.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[20:8](rp20407.htm#fr_110.md) "Making turn,"
literally.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[20:9](rp20407.htm#fr_111.md) *Khu*, the magic
charms which enable the gods and more especially Isis to triumph.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[21:1](rp20407.htm#fr_112.md) *Khen* used of birds
who remain stationary. Elsewhere Isis is winged.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[21:2](rp20407.htm#fr_113.md) Putting them one on
the other so as to reconstitute the mutilated body of Osiris.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[21:3](rp20407.htm#fr_114.md) That is Osiris.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[21:4](rp20407.htm#fr_115.md) Or "an heir."

<span id="fn_116"></span>[21:5](rp20407.htm#fr_116.md) Horus, born of Isis
and the revivified Osiris.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[21:6](rp20407.htm#fr_117.md) Isis hid herself in
the marshes of the Delta with Horus in order to rear him in peace.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[21:7](rp20407.htm#fr_118.md) In the text "Osiris
son Horus." This way of expressing affiliation belongs to the age of the
twelfth dynasty, *e.g.* in the tomb of Khnum-hotep at Beni-Hassan, where
we have "Neheri son Khnum-hotep," i.e. Khnum-hotep son of Neheri (Cf.
Lepsius, *Denkmäler*, iv. pl. 126 sqq.).

<span id="fn_119"></span>[21:8](rp20407.htm#fr_119.md) M. Maspero explains
this expression, which is used generally of the defunct, in a material
sense, "he whose voice knows the correct intonation in reciting prayers
and formulæ." M. Grébaut and most Egyptologists take it in a moral
sense: "true of speech," "truth speaking."

signifies "the entire god" who now has all his limbs.

behind them."

<span id="fn_123"></span>[22:1](rp20407.htm#fr_123.md) Properly, "count,"
