### PREFACE

<span class="smallcaps">Thanks</span> to my contributors, I have this
year been able to redeem my promise of issuing two volumes of the
*Records of the Past* during the same season. The monumental records of
the ancient oriental world are so numerous, and so much new material is
continually being brought to light, that it is difficult for either
contributors or editors to keep pace with the discoveries that are
constantly being made. All we can hope to do is to lay before the public
the most important of the documents which have thus been rescued from
forgetfulness, and the latest and most authoritative renderings of the
texts.

The latest discovery of interest to the student of the Old Testament has
been announced from Berlin. Among the tablets from Tel el-Amarna which
have been acquired for the Museum at Berlin, five are found to have been
despatches sent from the king or governor of Jerusalem to the kings of
Egypt. I had already recognised the name of Uru’salim or "Jerusalem" in
a tablet now in Cairo (*Academy*, 19th April 1890, p. 273); the tablets
at Berlin

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

give us further and unexpected information in regard to the later
capital of the Judæan kingdom. In the fifteenth century before our era
Jerusalem was governed by a certain Abdi-dhaba, or Ebed-tob as his name
would have been written in Hebrew; and it is his letters which have just
been deciphered by the German Assyriologists. He claims to have occupied
a more independent position than the governors of the other cities of
Palestine at the time. They were merely Egyptian officials, whereas he,
though owning allegiance to the Egyptian monarch, claims to have been
appointed to his office by "the oracle of the mighty king." This "mighty
king" is shown by one of the despatches to have been the deity who was
worshipped at Jerusalem. Abdi-dhaba, accordingly, must have been a
priest-king like Melchizedek, "the priest of the most high God." A
broken tablet which I copied in M. Bouriant's collection tells us what
was the local name of the deity in question. Here we read: *al sad
Uru’salim*-KI *al bit* AN NIN-IP: *sumu Mar-ruv al sarri padarat asar
nisi al Kilti*-KI," the city of the Mountain of Jerusalem, the city of
the temple of the god Uras, (whose) name (there is) Marru, the city of
the king, *defending* (?) the locality of the men of the city of
Keilah." Consequently "the most high God," of whom Abram was blessed,
was locally known under the name of *Marru*, which seems to be connected
with the Aramaic *marê*, "lord," and was identified with the Babylonian
Uras, the Eastern Sun. It is

<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>

possible that the name of the god may throw light on that of Moriah,
"the mountain" on which his sanctuary was erected.

Abdi-dhaba describes himself as having had dealings with the Kassi or
Babylonians, and in one of his letters he says: "so long as a ship
crosses the sea—this is the oracle of the mighty king—so long shall
there be a continuance of the conquests of Nahrima and the Babylonians."
Nahrima represents the Aram Naharaim of Scripture, and it is interesting
to find that the conquests of a king of that country were known and
feared in southern Palestine a hundred years before Israel was oppressed
by Chushan-rish-athaim, the king of Aram Naharaim (Judg. iii. 8–10). The
mention of the Babylonians is also interesting since Manetho avers that
when the Hyksos were expelled from Egypt they built Jerusalem as a
defence against the "Assyrians." In the age of Manetho "Assyrians" and
"Babylonians" were synonymous terms.

While we are thus learning the inner history of Palestine in the century
before the Israelitish invasion, the history of the fall of the Assyrian
empire, late as it comparatively is in time, is still shrouded in
obscurity. Two new facts only have been acquired of recent years in
regard to it. One is that the Assyrian king whose name was doubtfully
restored as \[Bel-sum-\]iskun was really called Sin-sar-iskun; the other
is that Assur-etil-ilâni-yukinni, the son and successor of
Assur-bani-pal, was acknowledged

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

in northern Babylonia as late as the 4th year of his reign, tablets of
that date having been found at Niffer by the American expedition. Since
Sin-sar-iskun seems evidently to be the Sarakos of Abydênos and
Alexander Polyhistor, we must regard him as the last king of Assyria, of
whom it was said that he had burnt himself to death in his palace. But
between Assur-etil-ilâni-yukinni and Sin-sar-iskun it would appear that
there was at least one king, possibly two. A tablet (K 195) was
discovered by Mr. George Smith from which he translates the following
passage: "Sin-inadina-pal son of Assur-akh-iddin (Esar-haddon), king of
Assyria, whose name on this tablet is inscribed, to the government in
the earth, in the presence of thy great divinity Shamas great lord, he
is proclaimed and established." <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) The
name of Sin-inadina-pal, or rather Sin-iddina-pal, reminds us of the
classical Sardanapallos, and the tablet on which his name occurs belongs
to a peculiar group, distinguished from all others in the Kouyunyik
collection by their style of writing and expression. They begin with the
words: "O Sun-god, great lord, I beseech thee; remove (our) sin."

Two tablets of this group (K 4668 and S 2005) were published by myself
for the first time in 1877, in the Appendix to my *Babylonian
Literature* (pp. 78–82). <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) I there
pointed out that they belong to the closing days of the Assyrian Empire,
and that

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

the Esar-haddon mentioned in them must be a later king than the
Esar-haddon otherwise known to history. I have since seen no reason to
change my opinion. Before examining their contents, however, it is as
well to translate such portions of them as give a continuous sense.

K 4668.

thee; O god of fixed destiny, remove \[our\] sin!

30\. the cities of <span class="smallcaps">Khartam</span> (and) <span
class="smallcaps">Kisa’s’su</span> \[their hands\] capture; to their
hands they are delivered."

S 2005.

1\. "\[<span class="smallcaps">O Sun-god</span>\], great \[lord\], I
beseech thee, O god of fixed destiny remove \[our sin\]!

2\. \[Kas\]tariti the lord of the city of <span
class="smallcaps">Kar-Kassî</span>, who to Mamiti-arsu

3\. \[the lord of the city\] of the <span class="smallcaps">Madâ</span>
sent, saying: We are confederate with one another, from the country \[of
<span class="smallcaps">Assyria</span> let us revolt.\]

4\. \[Mami\]ti-arsu listens; he is obedient; he sets his face

5\. \[to revolt\] this year from Esar-haddon king \[of <span
class="smallcaps">Assyria</span>.\]

The rest of the tablet is too broken for translation, but mention is
again made in it of "Mamiti-arsu" or "Vavit-arsu," "the lord of the city
of the Medes," and we are told that the city of Zaz was captured.
Reference is also made in the tablets to

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

the city of ’Sandu-litir and the ’Sapardâ or Sepharad of Obadiah (20),
as well as to the fact that the enemy had "entered the city of Kilman."

The language of the tablets is not that of a powerful conqueror like
Esar-haddon the son of Sennacherib. Moreover, the historical situation
presupposed by them does not suit the history of his reign. He defeated
the Gimirrâ on the northern frontier of his kingdom and drove them to
the west. Their leader was Teuspa, not Kastarit, and he is called a
Manda or "nomad." The Gimirrâ, furthermore, who were led by Teuspa, were
not in alliance with the Medes or with any other of the populations of
the north. The war of Esar-haddon with the Medes did not take place
until long after the defeat of the Kimmerians, and so far were the Medes
from being the aggressors that it was Esar-haddon who invaded their
territory in the distant east. The Medes, in fact, were not yet in
contact with the frontiers of Assyria. Finally, their leader was not
Mamiti-arsu. The "city-lords" who were attacked and subjected by
Esar-haddon bore the names of Sidirparna, Eparna, Uppiz, Zana’sana, and
Ramateya. There is a plentiful choice of names here, but that of
Mamiti-arsu does not appear among them.

On the other hand, the confederacy of which Kastarit was the head
strikingly resembles that which is called upon in the prophecies of
Jeremiah (li. 27, 28) to destroy the empire of Babylon. The prophet
summons the "kingdoms of Ararat, Minni,

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

and Ashkenaz," and "the kings of the Medes" to march upon Babylonia.
Ararat or Van and Ashkenaz, the Assyrian Asguza, take the place of
Kastarit and the Gimirrâ, but otherwise the situation is the same 'as
that which is represented in the tablets. It is clear from Jer. 1. 17,
li. 34, that the prophecy was written while Nebuchadrezzar was still
upon the throne of Babylon, and it would follow that the tablets which
depict a similar political situation cannot belong to a much earlier
date.

The Esar-haddon of the tablets, therefore, must be a later prince than
Esar-haddon the father of Assur-bani-pal. The conclusion is confirmed by
a tablet, published in *W. A. I.*, iii. 16, No. 2, which has been the
subject of a special study by M. Amiaud. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) It reads as follows: "Order of the daughter
of the king to the lady Assur-sarrat. Now do not inscribe thy tablet, do
not utter thy word, lest perhaps they say: 'This (is) the mistress of
Serua-edherat, the eldest daughter of the harem of
Assur-etil-ilâni-yukinni, the great king, the powerful king, the king of
legions, the king of Assyria.' Yet thou (art) a mighty princess, the
lady of the house of Assur-bani-pal, the eldest royal son of the harem
of Esar-haddon king of Assyria." It would appear from these words that
the wife of Assur-bani-pal, the eldest son of Esar-haddon, "king of
Assyria," had attempted to assume authority over the dowager queen of
Assur-etil-ilâni-yukinni. As the latter king

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

was the successor of Assur-bani-pal, it is obvious that the Esar-haddon
referred to in the tablet could not have been the father of
Assur-bani-pal, and that the Assur-bani-pal whose wife was Assur-sarrat
must have been a different prince from the famous Assyrian monarch. We
must see in him a brother of Sin-iddina-pal, and it is possible that the
Greek Sardanapallos has originated out of a fusion of the names of the
two brothers Assur-(bani-pal) and (Sin)-iddina-pal.

However this may be, we must regard the existence of Esar-haddon II as
an ascertained fact of history. Whether he was succeeded by one of his
two sons Sin-iddina-pal and Assur-bani-pal II we do not know. All that
seems clear is that between Assur-etil-ilâni-yukinni, the immediate
successor of Assur-bani-pal, and Sin-sar-iskun the last Assyrian king
there intervened the reign of Esar-haddon II, and that under him the
foes of the empire first began to gather against it from the north-east.
The king turned for help to the gods and the prophets; and the armies
that had once made the name of Assyria terrible throughout the eastern
world could no longer defend the cities they had garrisoned.
