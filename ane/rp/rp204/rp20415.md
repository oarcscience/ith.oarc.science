### THE INSCRIPTION OF SHALMANESER II ON THE GATES OF BALAWÂT

#### COLUMN I

1\. Shalmaneser, the great king, the powerful king, the king of hosts,
\[the king of <span class="smallcaps">Assyria</span>\] …

2\. the pitiless one, who subjugates the rebellious … \[who a rival\]

3\. has not. The great, the incomparable, the heroic one, … \[clothed\]

4\. with splendour, who fears not opposition; \[who from the rising of
the sun\]

5\. to the setting of the sun commands …

6\. is powerful. In those days, through the great lord, <span
class="smallcaps">Merodach</span> …

#### COLUMN II

1\. … \[After that the gods\] had placed in my hands the insignia of
mankind, with the help of <span class="smallcaps">Assur</span>, the
great lord, my lord, and of the god who loves my priesthood, \[I trod\]
the summits of all mountain-ranges

2\. to the extremities of them all, \[as far as\] the sea of <span
class="smallcaps">Nairi</span> and the sea of <span
class="smallcaps">Zamua-sa-Bittani</span> <span
id="fr_345"></span>[1](#fn_343.md) and the great sea of <span
class="smallcaps">Syria</span>. The country of the <span
class="smallcaps">Hittites</span>, to its very extremities, like a mound

3\. swept by the wind, I ravaged … I spread over the country of the
<span class="smallcaps">Hittites</span> the \[terror\] of the glory of
my sovereignty. In my passage from the sea <span
id="fr_346"></span>[2](#fn_344.md) I

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

erected a great image of my majesty, (and) set (it) up along with that
of Assur-irbe. <span id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_345.md)

4\. … I marched \[to\] the great \[sea\]; I purified my weapons in the
waters; I offered sacrifices to my gods; I received the tribute of all
the kings of the shores of the sea.

5\. … I erected \[an image of my majesty beside\] the sea; I wrote upon
it; I set it up overlooking the sea. From the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Enzite</span> to the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Dayaeni</span>, from the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Dayaeni</span> to

6\. \[the country of\] … I possessed myself \[of <span
class="smallcaps">Arzashkun</span>, the royal city of Ara\]me, of the
land of <span class="smallcaps">Ararat</span>, I threw (it) down, dug
(it) up and burnt (it) with fire. While I was staying in <span
class="smallcaps">Arzashkun</span>, Arame, of the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Ararat</span>, to the multitude of his forces

#### COLUMN III

1\. trusted and gathered all his troops; to give combat and battle he
came against me. I utterly defeated him; I cut his fighting-men to
pieces. I slew with weapons 3000 of his soldiers. With the bodies of his
warriors

2\. I filled the broad plain; I took from him his engines of war, his
royal treasures (and) numerous war-material. To save his life he
ascended an inaccessible mountain. Like <span
class="smallcaps">Hadad</span> <span id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_346.md) I
overthrew the widespread land of <span
class="smallcaps">Qute</span>. <span id="fr_349"></span>[3](#fn_347.md)
From the city of <span class="smallcaps">Arzashkun</span> to the country
of <span class="smallcaps">Guzan</span>,

3\. from the country of <span class="smallcaps">Guzan</span> to the
country of <span class="smallcaps">Khupushkia</span>, like the stormy
Air-god I roared upon them. I displayed over the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Ararat</span> the splendour of my sovereignty. Akhuni
the son of Adini,

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

who, with the permission of the kings my fathers, power and strength

4\. had acquired, (whom) at the beginning of my reign I had shut up in
his city, whose crops I had gathered, whose plantations I had cut down,
to save (his) life had crossed the <span
class="smallcaps">Euphrates</span> (and) the city of <span
class="smallcaps">Shitamrat</span>, a mountain-peak which hangs from the
sky like a cloud, for

5\. his stronghold had taken. For the second time <span
id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_348.md) I pursued after him; the mountain-peak I
besieged. My soldiers swooped upon them like birds of prey. <span
id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_349.md) I captured 17,500 of his troops. Akhuni
with his troops, his gods, his chariots

6\. (and) his horses, I caused to be brought before me; I carried (them)
to my city of <span class="smallcaps">Assur</span> \[and settled them
among the people of my own land.\]

#### COLUMN IV

1\. In the eponymy of Samas-bel-utsur, <span
id="fr_352"></span>[3](#fn_350.md) in the time of Merodach-sum-iddin the
king of <span class="smallcaps">Babylonia</span>, <span
id="fr_353"></span>[4](#fn_351.md) Merodach-bel-usâte his brother revolted
against him. They divided the country into (two) factions.
Merodach-sum-iddin to ask help to Shalmaneser sent

2\. his ambassador. Shalmaneser, the impetuous chief, whose trust is
<span class="smallcaps">Adar</span>, <span
id="fr_354"></span>[5](#fn_352.md) took the road; he gave the order to
march against <span class="smallcaps">Akkad</span>. <span
id="fr_355"></span>[6](#fn_353.md) I approached the city of <span
class="smallcaps">Zaban</span>; <span id="fr_356"></span>[7](#fn_354.md)
victims before <span class="smallcaps">Hadad</span> <span
id="fr_357"></span>[8](#fn_355.md) my lord

3\. I sacrificed. I departed from <span class="smallcaps">Zaban</span>;
to the city of <span class="smallcaps">Mê-Turnat</span> I
approached; <span id="fr_358"></span>[9](#fn_356.md) the city I besieged,

I captured; his fighting-men I slew; his spoil I

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

carried away. From the city of <span class="smallcaps">Mê-Turnat</span>
I departed; to the city of <span
class="smallcaps">Gannanate</span> <span id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_357.md)

4\. I approached. Merodach-bel-usâte, the lame king, ignorant how to
conduct himself, came forth against me to offer combat and battle. I
utterly defeated him; his fighting-men I slew; in his city I shut him
up. His crops

5\. I gathered in; his plantations I cut; his river I dammed up. In a
second expedition, in the eponymy of Bel-bunâya, <span
id="fr_360"></span>[2](#fn_358.md) on the 10th day of the month Nisan, I
departed from <span class="smallcaps">Nineveh</span>. The Upper <span
class="smallcaps">Zab</span>

6\. and the Lower (<span class="smallcaps">Zab</span>) I crossed. To the
city of <span class="smallcaps">Lakhiru</span> I approached. The city I
besieged, I captured. Its fighting-men I slew, its spoil I carried away.
From the city of <span class="smallcaps">Lakhiru</span>

#### COLUMN V

1\. I departed. To the city of <span
class="smallcaps">Gan\[na\]nate</span> I approached. Merodach-bel-usâte
came forth like a fox from his hole; towards the mountains of <span
class="smallcaps">Yasubi</span> he set his face. The city of <span
class="smallcaps">Arman</span>

2\. he took for his stronghold. The city of <span
class="smallcaps">Gannanate</span> I captured; its fighting-men I slew,
its spoil I carried away. I ascended the mountains after him. In the
city of <span class="smallcaps">Arman</span> I shut him up; the city I
besieged, I took. His fighting-men

3\. I slew, his spoil I carried away. I put Merodach-bel-usâte to death
with weapons. Of the miserable soldiers who (were) with him not one did
I leave. When Merodach-sum-iddin had conquered his enemies, \[and\]
Shalmaneser

4\. the powerful king had fulfilled the desire of his heart, he exalted
thee, O great lord <span class="smallcaps">Merodach</span>! Shalmaneser
the king of <span class="smallcaps">Assyria</span> ordered the march to
<span class="smallcaps">Babylon</span>; he arrived at <span
class="smallcaps">Kutha</span>, <span id="fr_361"></span>[3](#fn_359.md)
the city of the warrior of the gods <span
id="fr_362"></span>[4](#fn_360.md)

gate of the temple he prostrated himself humbly, and presented his
sacrifice; he made offerings. He entered also into <span
class="smallcaps">Babylon</span>, the bond of heaven to earth, the seat
of life; <span id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_361.md)

6\. he ascended also to <span class="smallcaps">Ê-Sagil</span>, the
palace <span id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_362.md) of his gods as many as
there are; before <span class="smallcaps">Bel</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Beltis</span> he was seen to pass and he directed
their path. Their propitiatory sacrifices (and) pure offerings on <span
class="smallcaps">Ê-Sagil</span>

#### COLUMN VI

I. he lavished. He visited all the shrines <span
id="fr_365"></span>[3](#fn_363.md) in <span
class="smallcaps">Ê-Sagil</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Babylon</span>: he presented his pure sacrifice. He
took also the road to

2\. <span class="smallcaps">Borsippa</span>, <span
id="fr_366"></span>[4](#fn_364.md) the city of the warrior of the
\[god\]s, <span id="fr_367"></span>[5](#fn_365) the *angel* (?.md) supreme.
He entered also into <span class="smallcaps">Ê-Zida</span> <span
id="fr_368"></span>[6](#fn_366.md) … he prostrated himself before the
temple of his immutable oracle, and in the presence of <span
class="smallcaps">Nebo</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Nana</span>

3\. the gods his lords he directed reverently his path. Strong oxen
(and) fat sheep he gave in abundance. He visited all the shrines <span
id="fr_369"></span>[3](#fn_363.md) in <span
class="smallcaps">Borsippa</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Ê-Zida</span>; each time

4\. he offered *libations* (?). For the men of <span
class="smallcaps">Babylon</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Borsippa</span>, the vassals of the great gods, he
made a feast, and gave them food (and) wine; with embroidered robes he
clothed (them); with presents

5\. he endowed them. After that the great gods had favourably regarded
Shalmaneser, the powerful king,

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

the king of <span class="smallcaps">Assyria</span>, had directed his
face, had granted the *desire* (?) of his heart and strength, (and) had
heard his prayers, I departed from <span
class="smallcaps">Babylon</span>; \[to\] the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Chaldæa</span> <span id="fr_370"></span>[1](#fn_367.md)

6\. I descended. To the city of <span class="smallcaps">Baqâni</span>, a
fortress of Adini the son of Dakuri I approached. The city I besieged, I
captured. His numerous soldiers I slew; their rich spoil, their oxen
(and) their sheep, I carried away. The city I threw down, dug up (and)
burned with fire. From the city of <span class="smallcaps">Baqani</span>
I departed; the <span class="smallcaps">Euphrates</span> hard by it I
crossed. The city of <span class="smallcaps">Enzudi</span>,

7\. the royal city of the aforesaid Adini, I approached. As for Adini
the son of Dakuri, the terror of the glory of <span
class="smallcaps">Merodach</span> the great lord overwhelmed him, and I
received from him … silver, gold, copper, lead, iron, *muskanna* wood,
ivory, (and) elephants' skin. While I was staying \[on the shores\] of
the sea, <span id="fr_371"></span>[2](#fn_368.md) the tribute of Yakin the
king of the maritime country

8\. and of Musallim-Merodach the son of Amukkani, silver, gold, lead,
copper, \[iron\], *muskanna* wood, \[ivory, and\] elephants’ skin, I
received.
