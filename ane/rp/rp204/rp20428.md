### MONOLITH INSCRIPTION OF ARGISTIS, KING OF VAN

#### <span class="smallcaps">Translated by the Editor</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> following inscription was discovered
by Sir A. H. Layard on a stone under the altar of the church of Surk
Sahak at Van, and though the beginning and end of it are lost it
supplements the great historical inscription of Argistis on the rock of
Van, and is therefore given here. It was published by myself for the
first time in my Memoir on the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of Van" in the
*Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society*, xiv. 4. The translation of it I
offered there can now be improved in several particulars. The
inscription is numbered XLV in my Memoir.
