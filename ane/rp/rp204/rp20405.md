### THE GREAT INSCRIPTION OF AMEN-EM-HEB. <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)

1\. As for me, I was the very faithful <span
id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_19.md) \[instrument\] of the sovereign; the half
of the heart of the king of the south, the light of the heart of the
king of the north, while I followed

2\. my master in his expeditions to the regions of the north or of the
south, \[those which\] he desired; for I was as the companion of his
feet, and that

3\. in the midst of his valour and his power, in order to give
testimony. Now I captured in the country of

4\. <span class="smallcaps">Nekeb</span>, <span
id="fr_20"></span>[3](#fn_20) and brought back (certain.md) Asiatics, three

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

men as prisoners, alive. When his majesty reached <span
class="smallcaps">Naharain</span> <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md)

5\. I brought thither the three men as booty, whom I placed before
thy <span id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md) majesty, as living prisoners.

6\. Another time <span id="fr_23"></span>[3](#fn_23.md) I captured (it was
in the expedition <span id="fr_24"></span>[4](#fn_24.md) to the country of
mount <span class="smallcaps">Uan</span>, to the west of <span
class="smallcaps">Aleppo</span> <span id="fr_25"></span>[5](#fn_25).md),
and I brought back

7\. (certain) captured Asiatics, as living prisoners 13 men, 70 asses
alive, <span id="fr_26"></span>[6](#fn_26.md) 13 basons of iron, … basons
of worked gold…

8\. … Another time I captured (it was in an expedition to the country of
<span class="smallcaps">Carchemish</span> <span
id="fr_27"></span>[7](#fn_27).md) and brought away…

9\. … as living prisoners. I traversed the water of <span
class="smallcaps">Naharain</span> <span id="fr_28"></span>[8](#fn_28.md)
without letting them escape, <span id="fr_29"></span>[9](#fn_29.md)

10\. \[and\] I \[set\] them before my master. Behold, therefore,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

he rewarded me with a great reward, namely …

11\. … I saw the victory of the king, the king of the south and of the
north, even Ra-men-kheper, <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) the
life-giver, in the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Senzar</span>. <span id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_31.md) He
made …

12\. … them. There I captured before the king and I brought back a
hand. <span id="fr_32"></span>[3](#fn_32.md) He gave me the gold of
guerdon, namely

13\. 2 rings \[of gold\] and silver. When I began again to behold his
valour, I was among his bodyguard, <span id="fr_33"></span>[4](#fn_33.md)
at the capture of

14\. <span class="smallcaps">Kadesh</span>, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[5](#fn_34.md) without quitting the place which was under
him. I brought back of the Marinas <span id="fr_35"></span>[6](#fn_35.md) 2
personages as \[living prisoners\].

15\. before the king, the lord of the two worlds, <span
id="fr_36"></span>[7](#fn_36.md) Thothmes … who gives life eternally. He
gave me gold for my valour in the presence of the master,

16\. namely the collar of the lion of gold, 2 *shebi* collars, 2 helmets
and 4 bracelets. And I saw my master …

17\. …

18 … <span class="smallcaps">Ha</span>; <span
id="fr_37"></span>[8](#fn_37.md) then afresh \[it was\] overthrown <span
id="fr_38"></span>[9](#fn_38.md) As for me, I ascended towards …

19\. I began again to see his valour in the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Takhis</span>; <span id="fr_39"></span>[10](#fn_39.md)…

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

20\. I captured there before the king and brought away (certain)
Asiatics 3 men <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md) alive as prisoners.
Then

21\. my lord gave me the gold of guerdon, namely, 2 collars, 4 bracelets
\[with\] 2 helmets \[and\] a tame <span id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41.md)
lion.

22\. I began again to see another perfect action performed by the master
of the two worlds in the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Nii</span>. <span id="fr_42"></span>[3](#fn_42.md) He
took in hunting 120 elephants for their tusks. …

23\. The largest among them attempted to fight face to face <span
id="fr_43"></span>[4](#fn_43.md) with his majesty. As for me, I cut off his
foot, <span id="fr_44"></span>[5](#fn_44.md) although he was alive …

24\. … I entered for thee <span id="fr_45"></span>[6](#fn_45.md) into the
water which is between the two stones <span
id="fr_46"></span>[7](#fn_46.md); then my master rewarded me with gold.

25\. … Behold, the prince of <span class="smallcaps">Kadesh</span>
drove <span id="fr_47"></span>[8](#fn_47.md) a mare

26\. straight against … as it charged among the soldiers I hurried to
meet it <span id="fr_48"></span>[9](#fn_48.md)

27\. on foot, with my dagger, \[and\] I opened its stomach. I cut off
its tail \[and\] made of it a trophy <span
id="fr_49"></span>[10](#fn_49.md)

28\. in the royal work of giving thanks to God because thereof. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[11](#fn_50.md) That caused joy to take possession of my
heart \[and\] cheerfulness to alight upon my limbs. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[12](#fn_51.md)

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

29\. His majesty despatched the most valiant of his soldiers to force
the newly-constructed rampart of <span class="smallcaps">Kadesh</span>.
It was I who

30\. forced it, for I was in advance of the most valiant; no other
\[was\] before me. When I left (it) I brought back (with me) of the
Marinas <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md)

31\. 2 personages as living prisoners. My master began again to reward
me because of this with every sort

32\. of good thing, <span id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md) for it was
pleasing to the king that I had made this capture. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[3](#fn_54.md) Being an officer …

33\. it was I who directed the manœuvre in … as captain of his
body-guard.

34\. … in his fair festival of Apet, when men \[were\] full of joy …

35\. Behold for the king, the age he passed <span
id="fr_55"></span>[4](#fn_55.md) of years abundant and happy, as a strong
man, as a …

36\. as a truth-speaker, <span id="fr_56"></span>[5](#fn_56.md) from his
happy first year until his 54th year, the last day of the month
Phamenoth. <span id="fr_57"></span>[6](#fn_57.md) Then the king of the
south and of the north,

37\. Ra-men-kheper, the truth-speaker, ascended to heaven, to unite
himself with the solar disk, and to follow God, who penetrates when he
makes himself luminous

38\. under the form of the solar disk which illuminates the sky at the
same time that it shines. The king of

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

the south and of the north, Ra-ââ-khepru, the son of the Sun,
Amen-hotep, <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) the giver of life,

39\. establishing himself on the throne of his father, reduced under the
royal banner all that made opposition to him. He pierced the
wretches <span id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59.md) …

40\. and of the desert; he immolated their chiefs, rising like <span
class="smallcaps">Horus</span> <span id="fr_60"></span>[3](#fn_60.md) the
son of Isis, taking possession of …

41\. … *the extremity* (?) of all those who exist and breathe, all the
mountain and plain, bowed as it were before his wishes, their tributes
on their backs. <span id="fr_61"></span>[4](#fn_61.md)

42\. \[He\] granted unto them the breath of life. Behold his majesty saw
me sailing with him in his bark

43\. named Khâ-m-suten-uaa, while I was at … of the fair festival of
Apet-rest, conformably to custom. <span id="fr_62"></span>[5](#fn_62.md)

44\. … when I re-ascended, even I, into the interior of the palace, an
order \[was given\] to stand in the presence \[of the king\] …
Ra-ââ-khepru; it was

45\. a great honour. I flew, even I, on the spot, into the presence of
his majesty. He said to me: "I know thy conduct …

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

46\. serving my father. Advance in dignity; be *tennu* of the army; and
from the moment that this is said watch over the royal forces." The
*tennu* Mahu <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) executed all his
words. <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_18"></span>[7:1](rp20405.htm#fr_18.md) The text of this great
inscription has been published by Ebers in the *Z. D. M. G.*, 1873, and
in the *Mélanges* of Chabas (3d series). Stern (in the *Z. D. M. G.*)
has proposed some corrections. A new edition of the text will appear in
the *Mémoires* of the French mission at Cairo.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[7:2](rp20405.htm#fr_19.md) *Mâ ur n ati ânkh uza
senb* ("the true great one of the sovereign, who is life, power, and
health," that is, "one who does things truly great," "who accomplishes
the designs of his master.") The idea of confidence contained in that of
truth may also indicate that the king had confidence in the fidelity of
his servant.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[7:3](rp20405.htm#fr_20.md) Here begin the
campaigns of Amen-em-heb. It was in the 29th year of Thothmes III, since
line 4 informs us that it happened when the king reached Naharain, and
the following campaign (line 13) was directed against Kadesh, which was
captured for the first time in the thirtieth year of Thothmes.
Amen-em-heb therefore took no part in the battle of Megiddo in the
twenty-third year, at which time he was doubtless still very young.
Moreover, he did not enter the royal guard at once; he had first to
traverse a considerable distance before he could present to the king,
who was in Naharain, the prisoners he had taken in Nekeb. Nekeb is the
Negeb or "southern country" of Palestine, frequently mentioned in the
Old Testament (see Gen. xiii. 1, xx. 1; Josh. x. 40, etc.). The course
of events would have been:—The federated Asiatics under the prince of
Kadesh, taught by their recent defeats, seem to have avoided a battle,
and fortified themselves in their cities, which had to be besieged one
after the other. Hence Thothmes, with the main part of his army,
occupied himself with this work, while flying columns compelled the
chiefs who would <span id="page_8">p. 8</span> have interfered with his
operations to look to their own defence, and prevented others from
joining in the revolt. Amen-em-heb was in one of these columns, and
consequently his first exploits in the countries of Nekeb, Uan, and
Carchemish took place at a distance from the king.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[8:1](rp20405.htm#fr_21.md) The Aram-Naharaim, or
Aram of the two rivers, of the Old Testament (Judges iii. 8), placed by
Prof. Maspero between the Euphrates and the Orontes. \[The tablets of
Tel el-Amarna, however, show that the chief seat of the king of Naharain
was on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, opposite Carchemish, as they
identify the Naharain of the Egyptian monuments with the country of
Mitanni, whose position is known from the Assyrian inscriptions.—<span
class="smallcaps">Ed</span>.\]

<span id="fn_22"></span>[8:2](rp20405.htm#fr_22.md) Amen-em-heb addresses
his inscription to the deified Thothmes III.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[8:3](rp20405.htm#fr_23.md) Literally "anew."

<span id="fn_24"></span>[8:4](rp20405.htm#fr_24.md) Literally "this
expedition to the land of Mount Uan."

<span id="fn_25"></span>[8:5](rp20405.htm#fr_25.md) Kharbu or Khalep. The
expedition probably took place while Thothmes was besieging Aleppo. Help
might have been sent to Aleppo from the land of the Hittites on the
north-west, which would explain the despatch of an Egyptian force in
this direction.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[8:6](rp20405.htm#fr_26.md) Or perhaps "heads" or
"beings," equivalent to *sa* ("human being").

<span id="fn_27"></span>[8:7](rp20405.htm#fr_27.md) Doubtless during the
siege of Aleppo, to which Carchemish was near. \[Carchemish, the Hittite
capital, was situated on the western bank of the Euphrates, a little to
the north of its junction with the Sajur, and is now represented by the
mounds of Jerablûs, from which Hittite sculptures and inscriptions have
been brought to the British Museum. Its fortifications on the river-side
are depicted on the bronze gates of Balawât. It commanded the great ford
over the Euphrates, and the defeat of the Egyptian Pharaoh under its
walls established the empire of Nebuchadnezzar in Western Asia (Jer.
xlvi. 2).—<span class="smallcaps">Ed.</span>\]

<span id="fn_28"></span>[8:8](rp20405.htm#fr_28.md) Probably the Euphrates.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[8:9](rp20405.htm#fr_29.md) Literally "they being
in my hand."

<span id="fn_30"></span>[9:1](rp20405.htm#fr_30.md) That is to say,
Thothmes III.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[9:2](rp20405.htm#fr_31.md) According to Chabas the
district on the left bank of the Euphrates, adjoining that of Aleppo and
Carchemish. Henceforth Amen-em-heb remained in the corps commanded by
the king; after the first siege of Kadesh he was among the body-guard.
His admission into them was the reward of his first exploits.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[9:3](rp20405.htm#fr_32.md) Perhaps the hand of an
enemy slain in single combat.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[9:4](rp20405.htm#fr_33.md) Literally "his
followers."

<span id="fn_34"></span>[9:5](rp20405.htm#fr_34.md) \[Subsequently the
southern capital of the Hittites, on the Orontes close to the modern
Bahr el-Qadis, or Lake of Qadis, westward of Horns.—<span
class="smallcaps">Ed.</span>\]

<span id="fn_35"></span>[9:6](rp20405.htm#fr_35.md) Or "chiefs."

<span id="fn_36"></span>[9:7](rp20405.htm#fr_36.md) Or "the double earth,"
that is Egypt.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[9:8](rp20405.htm#fr_37.md) Some country is
doubtless referred to which was protected by its distance from Egypt,
and after the withdrawal of the Egyptian forces was therefore able to
recover its independence. Thothmes spread terror by the suddenness of
his appearance in the most distant quarters.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[9:9](rp20405.htm#fr_38.md) I imagine that the
country whose name is lost is here meant.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[9:10](rp20405.htm#fr_39.md) Amenophis II
subsequently punished a revolt of this country \[which lay near the
Orontes\].

<span id="fn_40"></span>[10:1](rp20405.htm#fr_40.md) Prof. Ebers's copy has
"women."

<span id="fn_41"></span>[10:2](rp20405.htm#fr_41.md) Literally "slave."

<span id="fn_42"></span>[10:3](rp20405.htm#fr_42.md) Not Nineveh, but, as
Prof. Maspero has pointed out, a locality in northern Syria.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[10:4](rp20405.htm#fr_43.md) Literally "facing."
The elephant turned against the king and charged upon him.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[10:5](rp20405.htm#fr_44.md) Literally "hand";
either the front foot or the trunk.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[10:6](rp20405.htm#fr_45.md) That is, the king.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[10:7](rp20405.htm#fr_46.md) Perhaps a dangerous
passage where Amen-em-heb showed his courage, or, as Chabas suggested,
the two stelæ erected by Thothmes III on the two sides of the Euphrates
to mark the western limit of his empire.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[10:8](rp20405.htm#fr_47.md) Literally "caused a
mare to go out against."

<span id="fn_48"></span>[10:9](rp20405.htm#fr_48.md) Literally "I was
hurrying myself against it."

<span id="fn_49"></span>[10:10](rp20405.htm#fr_49.md) Literally "I arranged
it."

<span id="fn_50"></span>[10:11](rp20405.htm#fr_50.md) Probably the mare had
caused confusion in the Egyptian ranks, so that the king gave thanks to
God for deliverance from peril.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[10:12](rp20405.htm#fr_51.md) These events occurred
in the forty-second year of the reign of Thothmes III. The prince of
Kadesh, whose capital had already been captured (lines 13–14) in the
thirtieth year of his reign, and its walls razed, had revolted after
having rebuilt his fortifications. Hence Amen-em-heb <span
id="page_11">p. 11</span> speaks of "the newly-constructed rampart of
Kadesh." But before shutting himself up in the city the prince offered
battle, and employed the stratagem which was baffled by Amen-em-heb.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[11:1](rp20405.htm#fr_52.md) Or "chiefs."

<span id="fn_53"></span>[11:2](rp20405.htm#fr_53.md) No doubt there were no
more decorations for Amen-em-heb to desire.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[11:3](rp20405.htm#fr_54.md) After the second
capture of Kadesh Syria submitted, and the campaigns of Amen-em-heb
under Thothmes came to an end. Henceforth he commanded the royal
bodyguard in Egypt, where the king resided after the conclusion of his
wars.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[11:4](rp20405.htm#fr_55.md) Literally "behold the
king as to the duration of his time in years." The campaigns of Thothmes
ended, Amen-em-heb has nothing more to record.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[11:5](rp20405.htm#fr_56.md) *Mâ-kheru* ("whose
voice makes true," or "realises," the privilege, in the first place, of
the deity and then of the deified dead). The king is also *mâ-kheru*,
because he realises the designs of the deity whose incarnation he is
upon the earth.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[11:6](rp20405.htm#fr_57.md) The third month of
winter.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[12:1](rp20405.htm#fr_58.md) Amenophis II.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[12:2](rp20405.htm#fr_59.md) The new king is
compared with the rising sun, which pierced with its rays the shadows
where the evil principles hide themselves. A revolt seems to have broken
out at the time among the desert tribes, who are likened to the race of
Set or Typhon, the god of aridity.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[12:3](rp20405.htm#fr_60.md) The result of the
comparison between the new king and the rising sun.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[12:4](rp20405.htm#fr_61.md) This is represented in
three pictures below the inscription. The upper picture shows us,
according to the epigraph, "all the princes of Upper <span
class="smallcaps">Rutennu</span>, who proclaim: Great are thy desires;
thou puttest fear in all the double land (of <span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>), and all \[foreign lands are\] under thy
sandals." One prince is prostrate; two others, on their knees, extend
their arms in supplication; a fourth, standing, presents a vase; a
fifth, also standing, offers suppliantly a small child whom he holds in
his arms; another child is in front of him. A sixth chief also brings a
child. Other persons follow of different physiognomies and head-dresses;
but owing to the mutilation of the wall the end of the scene is
indistinct. In the second picture are "all the chiefs of Lower <span
class="smallcaps">Rutennu</span>;" but the scene represented in it does
not differ from that of the first picture. The legend attached to the
third picture is almost entirely effaced. A person is represented in it
prostrate and accompanied by three others who are kneeling, and two more
who carry vases of various forms. Beyond this the wall is mutilated.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[12:5](rp20405.htm#fr_62.md) As had been the case
under Thothmes. Amen-em-heb means that he preserved his old functions.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[13:1](rp20405.htm#fr_63.md) For the meaning of
this title see the Introduction.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[13:2](rp20405.htm#fr_64.md) *Zettu nebu-f*. I
think the form *zettu-f nebu* or *nebt* would be more regular. Perhaps
we should read *zettu neb-f* ("the words of his master"), and suppose
that the Egyptian artist has committed an error in copying the
inscription from a hieratic original, by confusing the determinative of
*neb* ("master") with the sign of the plural.
