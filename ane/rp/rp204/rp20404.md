### THE OFFICIAL LIFE OF AN EGYPTIAN OFFICER, FROM THE TOMB OF AMEN-EM-HEB AT THEBES

<span class="smallcaps">Translated by Philippe Virey</span>

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> is to Prof. Ebers that the honour
belongs of having discovered and published this celebrated inscription,
although Champollion before him had penetrated into the tomb of
Amen-em-heb, of which he gives a short description in his
*Notices*, <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) under No. 12. But the
description is so summary that no inscription is noticed as existing in
the tomb; nothing but the indication of the names of the defunct and his
wife, and the mention of the cartouches of Thothmes III and Amenophis II
allows us to affirm that it is really the tomb of Amen-em-heb. The
monument, moreover, was buried in the sand, and had been completely
forgotten when Prof. Ebers, during his stay at Thebes in 1872–73, had
the good fortune to rediscover it. The great historical inscription
contained in it attracted his attention, and he made a copy of the text,
which he published in

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

1873, <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) with a translation and
interesting notes. My predecessors have already acknowledged the merits
of this translation, <span id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md) which can be
appreciated by every Egyptologist. In my turn, I shall insist on the
excellence of the copy, and I believe that I possess special
qualifications for delivering such a judgment. Having myself had to
transcribe all the texts in the tomb of Amen-em-heb, <span
id="fr_6"></span>[3](#fn_6.md) I know well what difficulties Prof. Ebers
has victoriously surmounted, and can recognise with what patience and
sagacity he has made out the most obscure passages in a way that admits
of no doubt, saving me from painful efforts and perhaps from
unsuccessful conjectures.

If I now attempt to publish a new rendering of an inscription already
translated by the masters of Egyptological science, it is that I wish to
add a little sheaf of my own to the abundant harvest of facts collected
at once by Prof. Ebers, and to put forward some new ideas derived from
the study of other parts of the tomb of Amen-em-heb as well as of a
neighbouring tomb belonging to an official of the same rank <span
id="fr_7"></span>[4](#fn_7.md) as himself, entitled *tennu n suten tennu n
menfiu* ("vicar of the king in the army," or substantially a minister of
war). The great inscription

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

tells us in the first place what were the glorious services by which
Amen-em-heb rose to so high a dignity.

What was the exact signification of his title? The word *tennu*, which
Dr. Brugsch has carefully examined in the *Revue égyptologique*, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) does not always signify a minister in the
sense in which we ordinarily understand the word; but I hope to show
that it certainly has this meaning in our inscription. It properly
signifies, as Dr. Brugsch has pointed out, "a deputy," "a delegate," "a
vicar." Prof. Maspero, in his *Manuel de Hiérarchie égyptienne*, <span
id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md) explains that the military chief of a nome
had at his side a *tennu* of the troops, a lieutenant of the forces, who
could act in his place, more particularly, as his title indicates, at
the head of the troops who were in service, but probably also in the
offices of the administration. The *tennu* or vicar of a military
officer will therefore be his lieutenant; the *tennu* or vicar of the
governor of a city will be an assistant governor; the tennu or vicar of
the Chancellor <span id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_10.md) will perhaps be an
undersecretary of state; but the vicar of the king will be a minister. I
have elsewhere <span id="fr_11"></span>[4](#fn_11.md) come to the
conclusion that the *tennu* of the troops, who in the provinces was only
a sort of administrative officer or military intendant, was at Thebes,
under the title of *tennu n* 

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

*suten*, <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) the deputy of the king, an
actual minister of war. We see from the paintings which represent the
conscription that he received recruits from all countries; in the tomb
of Pehsukher many of them are Nubians and negroes. It was then the royal
army which was administered by this functionary, but the royal army with
the auxiliaries as distinct from the provincial contingents. In the
different inscriptions of the tomb Amen-em-heb is further distinguished
by a series of titles, all of which are thoroughly applicable to a
minister of the king. But the most conclusive example is found in line
46 of our inscription, where the king says to Amen-em-heb: "Advance in
dignity; be *tennu* of the army; and from the moment that this is said,
watch over the royal forces." These words can have been addressed only
to a minister; the meaning of "military intendant" is impossible here,
for Amen-em-heb was already in command of the royal guard <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) when the king appointed him *tennu*,
saying to him, "Advance in dignity." It would not have been an
advancement for the commander of the guard to be appointed military
intendant. I should add that Dr. Brugsch sees in the *tennu* or *aten*
"of the world" and "of the two worlds" a sort of viceroy of Egypt or
prime minister of the Pharaoh, and that Chabas remarks that there were
*atennu* of foreign countries, of the treasury, and of the private house
of the

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pharaoh: "We
recognise among them ministers of protected states, of finance, etc."
The *tennu Mahu*, who was charged with the installation of
Amen-em-heb, <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) was perhaps one of
these ministers, but the text does not state what was the department
which he administered. Sometimes, moreover, we find the terms *tennu n
suten, tennu n hon-f* ("minister of the king," "minister of his
majesty,"), without any further explanation.

In his new office Amen-em-heb superintended the recruiting of the army
as well as its discipline and instruction. Several of the scenes
depicted on the walls of his tomb represent him in the exercise of these
functions. We notice among them a document which gives us a high idea of
the organisation of the Egyptian troops, and enables us to understand
their superiority to the hordes of Asia. "Behold the arm of
Egypt," <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md) says Amen-em-heb to the
king, pointing out to him at the same time the officers who defiled
before him: "behold the numerous force which is under thy hand. We form
a complete whole, having but one mouth, one arm, one hand, all of us,
the soldiers \[keeping their ranks (?)\], <span
id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md) and none quitting them."

The maintenance of the troops, accordingly, depended on the superior
direction of the *tennu*. We see him presenting the officers of the
commissariat to the king. "He causes the officers of the administration

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

of the army, the officers of the commissariat, to march past before the
Pharaoh, in order that the sacks may be filled with provisions, bread,
beef, wine, biscuits, all sorts of vegetables, and all good things."

The tomb of Pehsukher shows us even the operations of harvest, in
districts doubtless appropriated to the maintenance of the army, and
sets before us a scene representing the inspection of the magazines of
food. A clerk sums up the amount, and certain officers taste the quality
of the provisions. The *tennu* thus has at his disposal a numerous
administrative staff, and is at the same time at the head of the army.
The officers who presented themselves before him were first of all
received by the "scribe of the writings or the secretary of the
*tennu*." And in a transport of pride the latter exclaimed: "There is
none greater than myself! There is none greater than myself!" <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) thus asserting that he held the first rank
among men, and next to the monarch who represented the divinity, and
whose minister he consequently was.
