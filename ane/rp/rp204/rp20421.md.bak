### INVOCATION TO THE GODDESS BELTIS

1\. To <span class="smallcaps">Beltis</span>, the great lady, chief of
heaven and earth, queen of all the gods, the mighty one

2\. of all lands, whose festival is honoured among the <span
class="smallcaps">Ishtars</span>, who surpasses in power her offspring,
a shining form,

3\. who, like the sun her brother, the ends of heaven and earth together
enlightens, the strong one of the <span
class="smallcaps">Anunnaki</span>, <span id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_388.md)

4\. first-born of <span class="smallcaps">Anu</span>, great one of the
gods, queen over her enemies, who goes before, troubler of the seas,

5\. who tramples the wooded mountains under foot, <span
id="fr_392"></span>[2](#fn_389.md) the mighty one of the <span
class="smallcaps">Igigi</span>, lady of fight and battle, <span
id="fr_393"></span>[3](#fn_390.md) without whom in E-sarra the sceptre

6\. they would not obey, who causes to receive strength,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

who causes to find the fulness of the heart <span
id="fr_394"></span>[1](#fn_391.md) of him who loves truth,

7\. hearer of prayers, receiver of supplication, who accepts entreaty,
<span class="smallcaps">Ishtar</span>, the perfect light,

8\. all-powerful, who enlightens heaven and earth, whose name is
proclaimed in the regions of all countries,

9\. who bestows life, the merciful goddess, to whom it is good to pray,
who dwells

10\. in <span class="smallcaps">Calah</span>, my lady.

#### II

In the following inscription Assur-bani-pal commemorates the revolt of
Elam and its final suppression (after 648 B.C.), as well as certain
repairs or alterations which he carried out in the temple of Ishtar of
Nineveh, to whom are gratefully ascribed both the inspiration and the
merit of his victorious campaigns.

The reference to the fate of Teumman's successors is not altogether
clear, though Tiele (*Babylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte*, ii. 399) is
probably right in explaining it as an allusion to the triumphal progress
of Assur-bani-pal to the gate of the temple of Ishtar in a chariot drawn
by the four conquered kings. See *W. A. I.*, v. 10, 29. But in that case
the introduction of Ummanigas must be due to an error, for he was killed
by his son, Tammaritu, long before the end of the Elamite war, which
this barbaric triumph of Assur-bani-pal was intended to celebrate
(Smith, *History of Assurbanipal*, p. 202).

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And, as we learn
from *W. A. I.*, v. 10, it was the Arabian King Vaiteh, who, together
with the three Elamite princes mentioned in our inscription, was
compelled to draw the car of Assur-bani-pal.

The inscription appears to have been frequently copied and widely
circulated. Four versions are preserved in the British Museum (Nos. 62,
63, 64, 65), and a fifth was discovered at Tartûs (the ancient
Antarados) in 1885, of which the text, with a translation, was
communicated by Professor Sayce to the Society of Biblical Archæology,
and published in their Proceedings (vii. 142). It has further been
published and translated by George Smith (History of Assurbp., p. 303),
and S. A. Smith (*Keilschriftexte Asurbanipals*, ii. 10), while a German
version by Jensen will be found on p. 264 of the second volume of
Schrader's *Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek*. <span
id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_392.md)

1\. To <span class="smallcaps">Beltis</span>, lady of the lands, who
dwells in <span class="smallcaps">E-barbar</span>, <span
id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_393.md)

2\. Assur-bani-pal, King of Assyria, the great one, her worshipper,

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

3\. the governor, the work of her hands, who by her great command

4\. in the onset of battle had cut off

5\. the head of Teumman, King of <span class="smallcaps">Elam</span>;

6\. and Ummanigas, Tammaritu, Pa’e,

7\. Ummanaldas, who after Teumman had exercised

8\. royalty over <span class="smallcaps">Elam</span>, with her great
help

9\. my hands took them, and to the chariot, <span
id="fr_397"></span>[1](#fn_394.md)

10\. the car of my kingship I fastened them,

11\. and in her mighty name in all countries I went to and fro,

12\. and rival had I none. In those days the pavement of the house of
<span class="smallcaps">Ishtar</span>,

13\. my lady, with squared stone well-hewn <span
id="fr_398"></span>[2](#fn_395.md) its fabric

14\. I made great for ever. <span class="smallcaps">Beltis</span>,

15\. may this pavement be accepted before thee!

16\. On me, Assur-bani-pal, the worshipper of thy great godhead,

17\. a life of long days, wholeness of heart bestow,

18\. and going to and fro in <span class="smallcaps">E-barbar</span> may
my feet grow old!

#### III

The following is a translation of the inscription of Assur-natsir-pal
referred to in II, note 2. It establishes the identification of Beltis
with Ishtar of Nineveh, and also records the fact that "the temple of
the library" (?) was originally built or founded by Samsi-Rimmon. Two
inscriptions and two only of this ancient king appear to have been
preserved;

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

but in both he styles himself "builder of the house of Assur," which is
perhaps the same temple as that which in later records, like the
present, we find more particularly associated with Ishtar. The
inscription is on a fragment of a votive dish of clay found at
Kouyunjik, and now in the British Museum.

1\. Assur-natsir-pal, vicar <span id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_396.md) of
<span class="smallcaps">Bel</span>, high-priest of <span
class="smallcaps">Assur</span>, son of Tukulti-Uras, vicar of <span
class="smallcaps">Bel</span>, high-priest of <span
class="smallcaps">Assur</span>, son of Rimmon-nirari, vicar of <span
class="smallcaps">Bel</span>, high-priest of <span
class="smallcaps">Assur</span>,

2\. when <span class="smallcaps">E-barbar</span>, the house of <span
class="smallcaps">Ishtar</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Nineveh</span>, my lady, which Samsi-Rimmon,
high-priest of <span class="smallcaps">Assur</span> <span
id="fr_400"></span>[2](#fn_397.md) the great one who went before me, had
made,

3\. fell into decay, from its foundations to its roof I restored (it), I
completed (it), I strengthened (it) more than before, I repaired (it)
… <span id="fr_401"></span>[3](#fn_398.md)

4\. An inscription I wrote in the midst … May some later monarch that
which has fallen of it renew; the name written to its place \[may he
restore!\] <span id="fr_402"></span>[4](#fn_399.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_388"></span>[91:1](rp20421.htm#fr_391.md) The spirits of the
under world opposed to *Igigi*, the spirits of the upper air.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[91:2](rp20421.htm#fr_392.md) In an inscription of
Assur-natsir-pal on a small altar brought from Balawât by Mr. Rassam,
and numbered 71 in the Nimrud Gallery of the British Museum, the same
epithet is applied to Bel. *Ana Beli* … *mu-na-ri-id khur-sâ-ni a-sib
E-kid-mu-ri*, etc.—"To Bel, … trampling the wooded mountains under foot,
dwelling in *E-kid-mu-ri*," etc.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[91:3](rp20421.htm#fr_393.md) Or, as Mr. Pinches
suggests, "without whom … the herd or tribe would not obey," taking
*sibdhu* as a collective expressing literally "that which is driven
together." Cf. Ex. xxiv. 4. ‏שׁבטי ישׂראל‎ "the tribes of Israel."
Jensen translates: "*ohne die* … *ein Strafgericht* (?) *nicht günstig
ist*." (!) *E-sarra* is the temple of heaven, opposed to *E-kur*, the
temple of the earth.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[92:1](rp20421.htm#fr_394.md) Or, "who causes to
attain the heart's desire of him," etc.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[93:1](rp20421.htm#fr_395.md) The text will be
found in the second volume of *W. A. I.*, plate 66, No. 2; but the
arrangement of the present translation is different, being that of No.
64, as edited by S. A. Smith.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[93:2](rp20421.htm#fr_396.md) It is uncertain
whether the name of this temple should be read E-barbar or E-masmas, and
the meaning of the name is also obscure. However, in *W. A. I.*, ii. 48,
26, *barbar* (or *masmas*) is explained by the Assyrian phrase *kis-su
sa mu-’sa-ri-e*, which is interpreted to mean "library" (Sayce, *Hibbert
Lectures*, p. 149), in which case *E-barbar* would be "the temple of the
library." The original meaning of *mu’sarû* seems to have been "furrow";
cp. *W. A. I.*, iv. 27, I: *bi-i-nu sa ina mu-’sa-ri-e me-e lâ is-tu-u*
("seed which in the furrows drinks not water"). Hence, through the idea
of what is traced or indented, it comes to mean an inscribed character,
an inscription. The temple in question is the temple of Ishtar at
Nineveh, which was also restored by Assur-natsir-pal. See *W. A. I.*,
iii. 3, 40.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[94:1](rp20421.htm#fr_397.md) The words translated
"chariot" (*itsi sa sa-da-di*) mean literally "the wood of drawing," or
"the draught-wood."

<span id="fn_395"></span>[94:2](rp20421.htm#fr_398.md) *iski*, translated
"well-hewn," I take as an adjective, and connect with the root ‏שּׂכה‎,
of which "primaria potestas fortasse est in *secando*." The meaning
"strong" has also been suggested; in any case it is difficult to see how
it can be made (as by S. A. Smith) into a preterite of the first person.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[95:1](rp20421.htm#fr_399.md) I venture, on an
obvious model, to introduce the phrase, "vicar of Bel," as more
expressive than such terms as "viceroy," of the combination of functions
in a ruler who was not only a king but also a pope.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[95:2](rp20421.htm#fr_400.md) The son of
Isme-Dagon, cir. B.C. 1820.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[95:3](rp20421.htm#fr_401.md) At the end of line 3
I restore *u-sa-tir*; cp. Tiglath-Pileser, viii. 49, *a-na as-ri-su-nu
u-tir*.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[95:4](rp20421.htm#fr_402.md) I restore *lu-tir*;
cp. *W. A. I.*, iii. 3, 23, *ana as-ri-su lu-tir*.
