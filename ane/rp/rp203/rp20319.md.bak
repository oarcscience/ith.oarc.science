#### VIII.

##### No. II <span id="fr_310"></span>[4](#fn_309.md)

<span class="small">OBVERSE</span>

1\. \[To Nim\]muariya king of the land of \[<span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>\] my brother, my son-in-law,  
2. \[whom I\] love (and) who loves \[me\], speak  
3. \[thus:\] Dusratta the king of <span
class="smallcaps">Mi\[tanni\]</span>, thy father-in-law,  
4. loves thee as thy brother; \[unto\] me is peace; unto thee

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

5\. \[may there be\] peace; to thy house, to \[thy\] wives, to thy sons,
to thy nobles,  
6. \[to\] thy chariots, to thy horses, to thy officers,  
7. to thy country and thy property may there be exceeding abundant
peace!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

8\. Manê the ambassador of my brother went to demand a wife for  
9. my brother that he might take her to be queen of <span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>, and the letter <span
id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_310.md)  
10. which he took I read, and to his message listened  
11. my good heart attentively, and the words of my brother as the person
of my brother  
12. I saw and rejoiced on that day very exceedingly.  
13. Day and night it produced pleasure. <span
id="fr_312"></span>[2](#fn_311.md)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

14\. And all the words of my brother which Manê took \[to me\]  
15. I performed in the same <span id="fr_313"></span>[3](#fn_312.md) year;
again the wife of my brother,  
16. the queen of <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>, I … and have
despatched to my brother;  
17. … on that day the countries of <span
class="smallcaps">Khani-rabbat</span> <span
id="fr_314"></span>[4](#fn_313.md) and <span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

18\. And as regards this, Manê will \[speak?\] before my brother:
Giliya <span id="fr_315"></span>[5](#fn_314.md)  
19. and Manê I \[presented with?\] a costly present, but I did not
address them.  
20. Again, O my brother, for … and for \[their\] dismissal …

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

21\. But I did not cause them to go up (to Egypt) to \[convey my
daughter\] that she might be the wife of \[my\] brother;  
22. even now I did not cause them to go up.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

23\. After six months Giliya my ambassador and Manê the \[ambassador\]  
24. \[of\] my brother I dismissed; the wife of my brother, \[to be queen
of <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>\],  
25. \[my daughter\], to my brother they brought. May <span
class="smallcaps">Beltis</span> the lady \[of battle\]  
26. my \[goddess\], and <span class="smallcaps">Amânu</span> <span
id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_315.md) the god of my brother according to \[his
heart\]  
27. advise <span id="fr_317"></span>[2](#fn_316.md) \[him\].

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

28\. \[His wife\] to my brother they brought, and when my brother \[had
children by her\]  
29. his son grew up stoutly and also …  
30. … according to the heart of my brother he became tall, <span
id="fr_318"></span>[3](#fn_317.md) and …  
31. … which to give my brother …  
32. … above the face …

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

33\. \[Now Na\]khâramassi has spoken, O my brother, a word to \[my
brother\],  
34. … and a letter <span id="fr_319"></span>[4](#fn_318.md) into his hand I
have given …  
35. … and his words may \[my brother\] hear, \[saying\]  
36. \[thus: Nakharâ\]massi to my brother I have sent …  
37. the soldiers \[of\] my brother have not made …

*Lacuna.*

<span class="small">REVERSE</span>

*The commencement is lost*.

1\. … of my brother they have brought …

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

2\. … my \[ambassador\] has collected everything, O \[my\] brother.  
3. … before all of them, and we …  
4. … among them, and these seals and the gold …  
5. … and they regarded (them) very intently;  
6. they \[considered\] these treasures <span
id="fr_320"></span>[1](#fn_319.md) as water, all of them, treasures of gold
without \[number\];  
7. \[and\] they said: "in the land of <span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span> (are) treasures of gold, more than the
dust in abundance."  
8. \[My heart\], O my brother, now loves thee in rivalry; the men …  
9. … whom they love, and yet nothing is given to their backs.  
10. \[There are\] quantities of what is needed, quantities more than the
dust in <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span> in plenty.  
11. As myself (are) these men; to whom is the gift made? …  
12. … and it has no gate; and truly when I \[heard of\] the treasures  
13. \[which lie\] before you, I did not question if he loves me very
greatly  
14. \[and\] my country, even the king of <span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

15\. And my brother lifts me up in his heart when my heart was vexed at
aught;  
16. and he does not *fail* (?) at any time, and the great god my lord
does not forsake me;  
17. Along with my brother am I not *remembered* (?) by thee? and to
country and city …  
18. like my brother …

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

19\. Manê the ambassador of my brother \[and the dragoman\] of my
brother who with him  
20. journeyed, I honoured: \[I spoke to\] them and honoured them

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

21\. exceedingly; now Manê has departed, and my brother  
22. has exalted him even as I honoured him very greatly.  
23. To my brother also I spoke, and my brother heard from them how  
24. I had done unto them: when Manê lacked (aught which) is not
supplied  
25. to him, he indeed is not vexed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

26\. And, O my brother, I have sent much worked <span
id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_320.md) gold which cannot be counted, and the
*aqqât*  
27. of my father may my brother return to me, as my brother regards
friendship.  
28. As my brother before my country, as before my *numerous* (?)
brethren,  
29. my brother has caused me greatly to flourish, so may the god <span
class="smallcaps">Amanu</span> <span id="fr_322"></span>[2](#fn_321.md)
*sustain* (?) (him), and  
30. act for ever according to the heart of my brother, and may my
brother,  
31. my beloved one, act according to my heart, like the Sun-god  
32. who loves mankind, and like the god <span
class="smallcaps">Na-nînu</span> may the gods  
33. direct us, and for ever  
34. let us love \[one another\].

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

35\. \[And now I send\] by way of a present one spear of *ubbi* wood  
36. … and an *isizzu* of Aleppo <span id="fr_323"></span>[3](#fn_322.md)
stone set in gold  
37. … \[which\] he folds together on his throne  
38. … *khulal* stone set in gold for a throne  
39. … to my brother I have sent.

unfortunate that the commencement of the line is lost: if Khani-rabbat
