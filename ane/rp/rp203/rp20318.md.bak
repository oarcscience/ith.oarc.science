##### No. 1

1\. To Nimmuriya the great king,  
2. the king of <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>, my brother,  
3. my son-in-law, whom I love  
4. and who loves me, speak

25. and Khanê, the dragoman <span id="fr_306"></span>[3](#fn_305.md)

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

26\. of my brother, like a god <span id="fr_307"></span>[1](#fn_306.md)
thou didst \[send\],

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_303"></span>[73:1](rp20318.htm#fr_304.md) Winckler and Abel,
*Mittheilungen*, i. p. 17.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[73:2](rp20318.htm#fr_305.md) "Sons" may mean
"children" here.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[73:3](rp20318.htm#fr_306.md) *Targuman*\[*nu*\].
The word occurs for the first time in this letter.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[74:1](rp20318.htm#fr_307.md) Or "according to the
god."

<span id="fn_307"></span>[74:2](rp20318.htm#fr_308.md) I am quite uncertain
as to the correct translation of this passage.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[74:3](rp20318.htm#fr_309.md) I follow Dr.
Zimmern, though with hesitation, in reading *nati* as *nadi*.
