(Two or more paragraphs and the colophon are lost.)

The tablet from which the above is a translation is of great importance
as giving us information and particulars as to the system of land tenure
and cultivation of the land in the early Akkadian period. The tablet
speaks first of the simple tenure, and it shows (Paragraph II) that the
tenure was to begin legally from the sixth month, that is the Babylonian
*Ululu*. The end of that month is no doubt meant, and it would tend to
confirm the opinion that at an earlier date *Tisritu* was the first and
*Ululu* the last month of the year, though the Babylonians might have
had an agricultural year, as we have a financial year, a scholastic or
university year, etc. After having chosen the farm and agreed to the
conditions of the contract, the first step of the farmer was to
determine his position towards the treasury, for, among the Babylonians
as among us, the payment of the taxes is a proof of the legality of the
holding.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> After that the
farmer had to gather his live stock. The tablet says "gazelles," and so
carries us back to the earliest period, for the ox and sheep did not
come originally from Babylonia, and the first animal domesticated there
must have been a kind of gazelle which was found wild in the country. In
the tablet, however, the word "gazelle" is no doubt taken to mean any
kind of quadruped; in the same way the word "birds" designates here
domesticated birds,—doves, ostriches, and at a later period hens, which
were introduced a long time before the Persian conquest. <span
id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_372.md) Being once established in his farm, he
is to give all his time to it.

After these preliminaries about tenure in general come the
specifications about the various kinds of tenure. The first spoken of is
the tenure by half, as it is called; it appears to signify the
properties which used to belong half to the lord and half to the peasant
who was attached to the soil as serf. In that case the farmer worked for
his master, he kept the live stock and the seeds, but everything was
controlled by the agent of the [landlord](errata.htm#2.md). In the field of
partnership, on the contrary, the landlord was placed on the same
footing as his tenant; if the latter gave his labour, the former had to
provide him with the material, implements, utensils, stock, grain,
seeds, etc.

After a lacuna of a few paragraphs the tablet

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

speaks of the various works to be performed by the agriculturist or
farmer. The tenure of a fifth, or the tenure in which the farmer took a
fifth of the produce for himself, was probably the most common in early
times, and for this reason is mentioned here; but we also get an account
of the percentage to be taken in the other sorts of tenure. To
understand this we must suppose that the character of the tenure
depended on the quality of the land; in very bad land the farmer was
obliged to take a third of the produce to be able to subsist and be
prepared for the next season.

The first paragraphs of Column are devoted to what might be termed
"legal specification." They enumerate the various sorts of tenure, what
are furnitures and fixtures, and the four sorts of garden, probably
private gardens independent of the farm land. Then we are told about the
general field work to be performed independently of the growing of
seeds. The farmer may dissolve partnership or resign his contract at the
end of the eighth month or Marcheswan, in fine weather, or at the time
of drying the dates, or when the palings are to be pulled out, but only
on certain conditions.

Column IV speaks of the works to be performed independently of the field
works, and contains very interesting statements; for instance, the
farmer was obliged to construct first the house of his workmen; we are
even told that if the house is not constructed properly he will have to
pay a fine. It is also stated

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

that the farmer must pay his men when the work is finished.

Part of Paragraph XIX and the colophon are lost at the end of the fourth
column, but it is probable that these precepts covered at least another
tablet.

Before closing it is needful to remark again that the tablet of
agricultural precepts did not contain laws but only precepts; in the
time of the Babylonian Empire these were no doubt consulted by the
lawyers, but the progress of civilisation had rendered some of the
prescriptions impracticable, and, as is shown by the contract tablets
recovered from Babylon, the laws of land tenure had become much more
complicated.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_368"></span>[94:1](rp20324.htm#fr_369.md) Only the Akkadian
text of this paragraph remains; it is interesting to note that the month
is designated by a number, as in some of the omen and astronomical
tablets.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[95:1](rp20324.htm#fr_370.md) The paragraph is
mutilated, it may refer to the establishment of some irrigating
instrument.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[96:1](rp20324.htm#fr_371.md) Or palings.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[97:1](rp20324.htm#fr_372.md) In Akkadian the
month *Apin*.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[99:1](rp20324.htm#fr_373.md) I have found on a
Babylonian contract tablet, two centuries older than Cyrus, the
representation of a cock.
