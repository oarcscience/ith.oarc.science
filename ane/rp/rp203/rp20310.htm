<P><A NAME="fn_217"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_217">48:1</A> The orchards of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ra</span> are mentioned in the Book of the Dead, ch. 81.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_218"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_218">48:2</A> This belief in the celestial origin of the Nile survived in Egypt, at all events as late as the time of Joinville (<i>Histoire de Saint-Louis</i>, ch. xl.).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_219"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_219">48:3</A> Ptah is associated with the Nile in a list of divinities represented on a wall of the age of Ramses II at Karnak (Champollion: <i>Not. Manuscrites</i> II. p. 255, where Ptah is called <i>Ptah</i>, <i>pa Hapi a&#257;</i>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_220"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_220">48:4</A> In the Anastasisi text: "Causing the temples to keep holiday."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_221"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_221">49:1</A> The Nile is not only the dispenser of life to mankind, but also to the gods (see verses 4, 10, 53). In the Hymn it absorbs as it were all the gods, and even takes the place of Ra in verse 14.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_222"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_222">49:2</A> Num, the divine creator, like Ptah, is similar to Ptah in his relation to the Nile. The two verses point out that all life is dependent on the Nile, an idea which is developed to excess in the verses following.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_223"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_223">49:3</A> Funerary offerings made to the <i>ka</i> or "double."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_224"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_224">49:4</A> See verse 14.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_225"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_225">50:1</A> The gods had to submit to the power of incantations and magic formul&aelig; (compare the legend of Ra bitten by a serpent, the romance of Setnau, and numerous passages in the Book of the Dead). The Nile alone was excepted from this law; it remained enshrouded in mystery in its retreat near the two whirlpools often mentioned in the texts and even alluded to by Herodotus.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_226"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_226">50:2</A> So in the Anastasi text. The fixity of the periodic return of the Nile is probably referred to.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_227"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_227">50:3</A> Verse 5 has, however, stated that the Nile had no servants; perhaps the secondary gods are meant here who directed the spread of the waters over Egypt, that is to the north of the whirlpools from whence the Nile rose.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_228"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_228">50:4</A> Neit is often represented with two crocodiles on the breast; her relation to Sebek, the crocodile-god, is difficult to define.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_229"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_229">51:1</A> Neit appears here as the goddess of production; the Nile has no need of Neit (or perhaps the rain) in order to generate the crops; it makes its way throughout the country by means of canals and trenches.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_230"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_230">51:2</A> This seems to be an allusion to the festival of the "Night of the Drop" (<i>L&ecirc;let en-Nuqta</i>), still observed in Egypt on the 5th of June, when the rise of the Nile is supposed to commence. The name is due to the old tradition recorded by Plutarch, according to which the rise of the Nile was caused by a tear which dropped into it from the eye of Isis. In M. Am&eacute;lineau's <i>Contes et Romans de l&#8217;Egypte Chr&eacute;tiennes</i>, i. p. 17, the rise of the Nile is attributed to the intercession of St. Michael, whose festival is celebrated on the 6th of June; three days before, the archangel prays that the water may rise, since it is "the life of men and animals."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_231"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_231">51:3</A> Unknown word, conjectured by Cook to represent the name of a new god <i>Kabes</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_232"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_232">51:4</A> The Nile inspires Thoth the scribe of the divine utterances.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_233"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_233">51:5</A> The Nile is unaffected by incantations, but serves himself with them at his pleasure in order to manifest himself.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_234"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_234">52:1</A> The Nile is indeed the dispenser of all wealth, but true wealth does not consist in gold or silver, but of the products of agriculture which enable men to live.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_235"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_235">52:2</A> Women are represented on the monuments accompanying the singers by clapping the hands; this custom still survives throughout the East. It is possible that we still possess the festal songs of the Nile, of which Lane has preserved for us some fragments in his work on <i>The Modern Egyptians</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_236"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_236">53:1</A> Probably Thebes, the residence of the Pharaohs at the time when the Hymn was composed. No other city can be meant, as otherwise the mythological texts would have mentioned it. Thebes, moreover, is near Silsilis, where the height of the Nile was measured, as is indicated by the Book of the Dead, chap. 149, and the royal decrees of Silsilis, which institute festivals in honour of the Nile.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_237"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_237">53:2</A> These offerings are mentioned in the decrees of Silsilis.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_238"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_238">53:3</A> See verse 7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_239"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_239">53:4</A> The other world.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_240"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_240">53:5</A> The Pharaoh.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_241"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_241">54:1</A> From the <i>Anastasi</i> papyrus.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_242"></A><A HREF="rp20310.htm#fr_242">54:2</A> See the <i>Papyrus Anastasi</i> 7, pl. 7, ll. 5 and 6.</P>
