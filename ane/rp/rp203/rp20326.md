### Footnotes

<span id="fn_373"></span>[104:1](rp20326.htm#fr_374) Or minister, *i.e.*
of the gods. The Accadian ideogram is *foot* + *man;* somewhat like the
Chinese *foot* + *firm*, pronounced *kân* (= kín), "a servant." But
Chinese actually possesses an identical ideogram in the term *fu* (=
*bu* or *ba*), "to sit in state," "to make a low obeisance," "to sit
cross-legged in worship"; a character compounded of *foot* + *man*.
David "sat before the Lord" in prayer (2 Sam. vii. 18). This, at least,
favours the opinion that *sagganakku* or *sakkanakku* meant a priestly
rather than a secular personage; and that when Sargon called himself
*sagganak Bâbili*, he meant not "Machthaber," but "high-priest of
Babylon."

<span id="fn_374"></span>[104:2](rp20326.htm#fr_375) Literally
"fillings," "filler" (*zanânu* is a synonym of *malû*, *Rich Cyl.* i.
17, 18).

<span id="fn_375"></span>[104:3](rp20326.htm#fr_376) The chief temples
of Babylon and Borsippa. E-sagilla, the temple of Bel-Merodach, also
contained a shrine dedicated to Nebo, called "E-zida of E-sagilla" (Cyl.
A.H., 82-7-54. 1042, col. i. 31).

<span id="fn_376"></span>[105:1](rp20326.htm#fr_377) Literally
"fillings," "filler" (*zanânu* is a synonym of *malû*, *Rich Cyl.* i.
17, 18).

<span id="fn_377"></span>[105:2](rp20326.htm#fr_378) The cylinder
85-4-30. 1, establishes this reading of the ideogram.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[106:1](rp20326.htm#fr_379) Literally "thou
directest his name."

<span id="fn_379"></span>[106:2](rp20326.htm#fr_380) Cp. ii. 6. The
meaning is, "Show thyself kind or gracious."

<span id="fn_380"></span>[106:3](rp20326.htm#fr_381) Cp. the words of
Assurbanipal: "The yoke, the wood (= implement) of drawing, I made them
(the conquered kings) put on; to the temple they drew beneath me" (i.e.
drew me in my chariot): 5 R. 10.29.30a. See also *Phillipp's Cyl.*, i,
11, 12. "Unto Merodach . I reverently submitted; to draw his car I bowed
the neck:" and I, 61, below.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[107:1](rp20326.htm#fr_382) Or, lofty
confidence. The word *tukultu* coincides in form and meaning with the
Ethiopic *tukelt*, "trust," "confidence," "hope"; and "his trust" is
equivalent to "trust in him" (obj. genit.)

<span id="fn_382"></span>[107:2](rp20326.htm#fr_383) \[Lake Van and the
Persian Gulf.—<span class="smallcaps">Ed.</span>\]

<span id="fn_383"></span>[107:3](rp20326.htm#fr_384) Or, deported,
carried away, cp. 2 Kings xvii. 6.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[107:4](rp20326.htm#fr_385) Literally
"fillings," as at i. 12.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[108:1](rp20326.htm#fr_386) I only guess the
meaning of *imtû* from the context. Solomon "made silver to be in
Jerusalem as stones," 1 Kings x. 27. Is *imtû* a noun of the form
*ikribu*, from the root *matû*, "to strike," "break" (= LAL)?? Some
common material must be meant; but unfortunately the reading "stone" is
not certain. (See Amiaud and Méchineau, *Tabl. Comp.*, No. 145 note.)

<span id="fn_386"></span>[108:2](rp20326.htm#fr_387) The Accadian ZAGIN
is a compound term, denoting simply "bright," "pure," "white," and as
such might be applied to various valuable stones, such as jade, jasper,
onyx, and other veined and coloured quartzose stones, of which *uknû*
may have been a specific kind.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[108:3](rp20326.htm#fr_388) From the Accadian
ZAG, "head," i.e. beginning, and MU, "year."

<span id="fn_388"></span>[109:1](rp20326.htm#fr_389) \[Meaning, in
Accadian, "'The house of the foundation-stone of heaven and
earth."—<span class="smallcaps">Ed.</span>\]

<span id="fn_389"></span>[109:2](rp20326.htm#fr_390) This phrase is
found in Hebrew, Exod. xxxv. 21–26.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[109:3](rp20326.htm#fr_391) Literally "spake,"
"sware"; i.e. resolved to devote them to this use.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[110:1](rp20326.htm#fr_392) Mismakanna or
Mishmakanna, which looks like "Makan-wood," (Makan being the Sinaitic
Peninsula, or perhaps the east side of the Delta see Sayce, *Hilbert
Lectures*, p. 31, *note* 2), is perhaps the origin of the Biblical
*shikmîm*, Amos vii. 54 (St. Luke xvii. 6).

<span id="fn_392"></span>[110:2](rp20326.htm#fr_393) The ideogram is
(GIS) ES-GAN-RU, *shoot* + *bar* + *long*. The last character, RU, is
explained "to be long, of a pole." It is composed of the signs U,
*earth* + GU, *ox;* like the Chinese *mau*, *mu*, "bolt," "sliding part
of a lock," a character compounded of *ox* + *earth* (ngu + du).

<span id="fn_393"></span>[110:3](rp20326.htm#fr_394) With the Accadian
KANA, cp. Chinese *kan*, and *k‘an*, "threshold," "door-sill," sometimes
fixed, sometimes movable.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[110:4](rp20326.htm#fr_395) Perhaps related to
the Heb. *debîr*, or inmost recess of the temple.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[110:5](rp20326.htm#fr_396) With *lulû*, which
is probably of Accadian origin, cp. the Chinese *lau*, old *lu*, "to
carve," and *luh*, *luk*, ditto.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[111:1](rp20326.htm#fr_397) Apparently this
means "perennial abundance," or "flow."

<span id="fn_397"></span>[111:2](rp20326.htm#fr_398) \[The spirits of
heaven and earth.—<span class="smallcaps">Ed.</span>\]

<span id="fn_398"></span>[111:3](rp20326.htm#fr_399) The Moon-god. *Sin*
means "bright."

<span id="fn_399"></span>[112:1](rp20326.htm#fr_400) The Accadian terms
ALAM SHIG mean "bright or pure image," and so "pure, right thought,
desire, or design." Cp. the old Chinese *lam*, "to see, perceive,"
*lam*, "desirous," and *shing* "bright," "pure," "holy."

<span id="fn_400"></span>[112:2](rp20326.htm#fr_401) \[The
Air-god.—<span class="smallcaps">Ed.</span>\]

<span id="fn_401"></span>[113:1](rp20326.htm#fr_402) Or, "beareth away,"
"removeth": cp. *Sarg. Cyl.* 57, where the same god is called "exposer
of snares," and Ps. xci. 3.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[113:2](rp20326.htm#fr_403) The river of
Babylon.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[113:3](rp20326.htm#fr_404) See Herod. i. 180.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[113:4](rp20326.htm#fr_405) This Accadian term
recurs, with a different initial sign, in line 43. Those who know the
difficulty of identifying the precious stones and trees mentioned in the
Old Testament will not be surprised to find that similar difficulties
exist in cuneiform documents. It may be that the material here mentioned
(lines 18, 43) is only some kind of glazed or coloured brick, with a
double determinative prefix (*brick*+ *stone*).

<span id="fn_405"></span>[114:1](rp20326.htm#fr_406) Literally "with a
high filling I filled up." Cp. the Latin expression *agger viae*.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[114:2](rp20326.htm#fr_407) *i.e.* yield, or
produce.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[115:1](rp20326.htm#fr_408) Or perhaps, "the
interior of them, which was made with (or into) bulls and dreadful
serpents, cunningly I constructed." The relative clause sometimes
precedes its antecedent.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[115:2](rp20326.htm#fr_409) Cp. viii. 42; ix.
40. The Accadian GIN ME denotes that which *turns back battle* (GIN =
*târu*, ME = *takhâzu*), in this case an outer wall.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[116:1](rp20326.htm#fr_410) Reading *la babil;*
see *Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch.*, March 1889. Col. iii. 30 (*la ba-bi-il*).

<span id="fn_410"></span>[118:1](rp20326.htm#fr_411) Literally "a
substance of."

<span id="fn_411"></span>[120:1](rp20326.htm#fr_412) *ganû*, *kanû*,
Accadian GIN "bar," "barrier," "bulwark," "wall," answers to the old
Chinese *gan*, *gin*, "outer wall," "bank," "barrier," and the like.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[120:2](rp20326.htm#fr_415) For this
distinction, see 2 R. 46, No. 2, 29, 30, where it is applied to palms.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[121:1](rp20326.htm#fr_416) The Accadian DAN,
"hard," "strong," is like the old Chinese *dan* (modern *t‘an*), which
denotes several kinds of hard-wood trees, including sandal-wood.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[121:2](rp20326.htm#fr_417) The Accadian
KA-AMA-SI(G) = *mouth* + *wild-ax* +*horn*, which is the ideogram for
"ivory," recalls the Chinese *k‘au*, "mouth," *ma*, an obsolete name of
the yak or wild-ox, and *siang*, "elephant," "ivory," as well as *si*,
"rhinoceros" (written *ox* + *tail*).

<span id="fn_415"></span>[121:3](rp20326.htm#fr_418) *baltu* (from the
same root as balak, i. 47. "I heed or care for," "regard," cp. Arab.
*bala*). The phrase might be rendered "heed of wrath."

<span id="fn_416"></span>[121:4](rp20326.htm#fr_419) Literally "present
face," as at vi. 40 *supra*.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[122:1](rp20326.htm#fr_420) Literally "the
bulwark of his battle I carried to a distance" (from the inner wall);
cp. vi. 40; viii. 42.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[122:2](rp20326.htm#fr_421) Borsippa was no
exception, being part of Babylon.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[122:3](rp20326.htm#fr_423) See note on i. 12,
19 *supra*.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[122:4](rp20326.htm#fr_424) i.e. with
Merodach's town, Babylon itself, ix. 65. Cp. ix. 54 *sqq*.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[123:1](rp20326.htm#fr_425) The Blackheads were
the aboriginal population of Babylonia, *i.e.* the Accadians. The
Chinese anciently bore the same title, a fact which is one of the
innumerable proofs of their Accadian origin. The meaning appears to be
black-haired; though the expression is said to refer to the colour of
their caps or kerchiefs. The Chinese still call themselves by several
synonymous titles meaning the black-haired folk.
