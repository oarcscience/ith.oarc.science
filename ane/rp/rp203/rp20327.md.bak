### CONTRACT-TABLETS RELATING TO BELSHAZZAR

<span class="smallcaps">Translated by the Editor</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> three contracts which follow are
among the numerous cuneiform documents of the same class the publication
of which we owe to the indefatigable labours of Dr Strassmaier. They are
published in his *Babylonische Texte: Inschriften von Nabonidus*, i.,
iii., Nos. 184, 581, and 688, and are interesting on account of their
references to Belshazzar, the eldest son of Nabonidos, whose name is
written in Babylonian Bilu-sarra-utsur, "O Bel, defend the king." It is
especially curious to learn from one of them that the heir-apparent to
the throne had to conform to the same legal obligations as the meanest
of his subjects. Security was exacted by him for the payment of a debt,
a portion of the security being a house inhabited by a Persian. As
Persian slaves are mentioned in other deeds of the period it is possible
that the Persian in question was a slave. At all events the notice of
him proves that there were Persians living in Babylon before the
conquest of the country by Cyrus. The third document, it will be
observed, is dated six years before the overthrow of Nabonidos and the
entrance of Cyrus into Babylon.
