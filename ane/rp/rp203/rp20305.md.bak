### THE PRECEPTS OF PTAH-HOTEP

<span class="smallcaps">Translated by Philippe Virey</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> most ancient book in the world, the
*Papyrus Prisse*, now preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris,
has furnished us with the text of a treatise, famous on account of its
antiquity, of the glimpse that it gives us into the moral ideas of
ancient Egyptian society, and of the difficulties it offers to the
translator. I have studied it perseveringly since 1881, and have made it
the subject of a philological essay, which I presented to the École des
Hautes-Études in 1884–85 and published in 1887. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) In this I gave the history of the
manuscript, an account of the labours of my predecessors, a
transcription of the hieratic text in hieroglyphic characters, and a
translation accompanied by numerous critical observations and an index
of the words employed in the *Papyrus;* but I did not intend to offer in
it more than a purely philological study. In spite of its dry
simplicity, however, the essay met with acceptance, and in the following
year

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mr. Howard Osgood
did me the honour to publish an English translation of it in the
*Bibliotheca Sacra* (Oct. 1888), along with a good commentary and an
interesting comparison of the work with the Precepts of Ani. In my turn
I now undertake to present my work under another form; not that the
translation can be very new, since after so short a lapse of time I
could not greatly improve a work on which I have bestowed all my thought
and care <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md); but what can be remodelled
is the commentary. The philological part of my previous publication can
be reduced without inconvenience, as the reader who wishes to study this
side of the subject can refer to my essay; on the other hand, the
philosophical and historical portion of the commentary will be
considerably increased. I shall utilise for this purpose some of the
texts which I copied at Thebes in 1886 in the tomb of Rekhmara, who
exercised at a later period the same functions as Ptah-hotep.

Both were feudal lords of the Egyptian empire, nomarchs or prefects, and
were specially honoured with the royal favour. Rekhmara <span
id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md) is called *hesi n nuter nofer*, <span
id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_10.md) "favourite of the good god" (Thothmes
III); Ptah-hotep, who dates his treatise in the reign of Assa of the
Fifth Dynasty, boasts at the end of it

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

that he had enjoyed above all others the favour of the king, and in a
text published by Lepsius (*Denkmäler*, ii. 115) we read: *Assa hesi
Ptah-hotep*, "the favourite of Assa, Ptah-hotep."

In the preface of Ptah-hotep's treatise he even seems to declare that he
was of royal descent, for he calls himself "the royal son, first-born,
legitimate" (ch. v. ll. 6, 7); but I have elsewhere noticed that this
title must not be interpreted too literally. We may ask why the elder
and legitimate son of the king never reigned if he lived, and Ptah-hotep
did not die young, since he was already 110 years old <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) when he published his work. We must
attribute an extraordinary longevity to Assa if we hold that Ptah-hotep
was his son and died before him.

But Prof. Maspero has already shown that we must not give too literal an
interpretation to the titles "royal mother," "royal wife," "royal
daughter," and that it was possible to be "royal wife" by right of birth
before being married. Such titles served only to determine the rank
occupied by a princess at court in questions of etiquette and
precedence.

If the appellation "royal wife" were only an honorary title, we may
infer that "royal son" also might be the same and signify nothing more
than "prince." In this case, "the eldest legitimate son of the king"
would be equivalent to "prince of the blood royal." That such a title
can be given to a person not belonging to the royal family is not
unexampled

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

even in our own days in the West; all the more could it be given in the
East, where the most pompous titles are so easily accumulated. At the
court of Egypt, where everything was referred to the king, the source of
all honour, it is possible that a claim to nobility consisted in
attaching oneself, at all events nominally, to his family, or even in
making oneself part of it. The relations of the king enjoyed the highest
titles, but even the "royal nurses" gloried in "the suckling which had
mingled their blood with Horus." <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)

If Rekhmara does not, like Ptah-hotep, bear the title of royal prince,
he was perhaps of even higher rank, since he is called "the double of
the Pharaoh," animated by his spirit, taking his place in his absence,
governing all Egypt like him, addressed by the same titles, <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) and saluted like him by the courtiers. We
must not be astonished therefore at the royal title given to Ptah-hotep;
the prefect of the capital was next to the king the first person in the
kingdom.

Although an interval of many centuries separated the two prefects, it is
probable that both governed according to the same rules, and that little
change had taken place in the social state and ideas of the Egyptian
people. Rekhmara, after exercising the

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

viceroyalty in the absence of Thothmes III, insists before all else on
the conservative character of his government. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) The temples, the laws, the principles on
which society rested, all remained unshaken; the children of the
nobility succeeded their fathers regularly; everything, in short,
continued as if the king remained perpetually in his capital, and the
same hand had governed Egypt since the mythical age of Horus. All its
kings and their ministers were only the images and substitutes of the
god who had been the first to reign over the country; the principles of
government, like the principles of morality, were of divine origin;
nothing could be changed. Ptah-hotep had asserted this of the past and
predicted it of the future; innovators had no place in Egypt, and their
ephemeral success had always been followed by reaction. "Let none make
innovations," he had said, "in the precepts of his father; let the same
precepts form his instruction to his children." <span
id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md) Doubtless innovators sometimes made
themselves heard by the uninstructed multitude and influenced the public
for a moment, but their triumph was momentary. Nothing, then, must be
taken away or added, nothing changed in established principles, and
whoever found contrary ideas growing up in himself must be careful to
root them out. <span id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md) Thus, in order to
discover the earliest trace of the struggle between established custom
and new ideas, between the conservative and the radical,

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

it is necessary to go back to the oldest book in the world.

Thanks to this horror of change in the government and society of ancient
Egypt, the documents which relate to the occupations of the prefect
Rekhmara doubtless give us sufficient information in regard to the
occupations of the prefect Ptah-hotep. Interesting resemblances,
moreover, between certain chapters of the *Papyrus Prisse* and the texts
of the [Tomb](errata.htm#0.md) of Rekhmara authorise us in making this
comparison. These texts depict to us the divan of the Pasha or Prefect
of Thebes: "He sits in the divan, in order to hear the petitions … to
*give peace* to the whole country, dispensing justice without paying
attention to bribes, applications, (or) offerings, and he who has
petitioned him has not wept." <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) … From
early dawn he has been up to listen all day to the petitions of the
provinces of the South and the provinces of the North. He has not
repelled small or great; the evil done to the poor, the aged, or the
afflicted is requited by Horus to its author. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) ... There is no inattention in him to the
matters about which he has been petitioned; he estimates the poor
equally with the rich, appearing as peace-maker." <span
id="fr_19"></span>[3](#fn_19.md)

Ptah-hotep also tells us how the prefect ought to apply himself to fill
the office of "leader of peace," with what care he ought to hear the
explanations offered by the parties to a suit, with what patience lie

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

should try to unravel the truth from obscure statements and . useless
details: "When thou art a leader of peace, listen well to the words of
the petitioner. Be not abrupt with him; that would trouble him. Do not
say to him: Thou hast \[already\] said this. Indulgence will encourage
him to do that for the sake of which he is come. As for being abrupt
with the plaintiff because he describes what happened when the injury
was done instead of complaining of the injury itself, let it not be! The
way to obtain a clear explanation is to listen with kindness." <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md)

With the object of maintaining peace among their subordinates by means
of justice, one of the chief cares of the prefects was to provide
subsistence for the people and to preserve them from want. Every centre
of population accordingly possessed a *larit* or assemblage of
magazines, where corn, wine, and all sorts of provisions were stored and
thoroughly well guarded. No place, in fact, could have been more secure,
and we shall see how strictly all access to it was forbidden to the
stranger.

The word *larit* appears to mean a well-guarded enclosure <span
id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md); among the duties which Ptah-hotep insists
upon in his Precepts, one of those to which he attaches most importance
is that of vigilantly guarding

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

the *larit*: "If," he says, "thou art employed at the *larit*, stand or
sit rather than walk about. Determine from the first not to absent
thyself even when weariness overtakes thee. Keep an eye on him who
enters, declaring that the object of his request is secret; what is
consigned to thee is above appreciation, and all contrary argument is to
be rejected. He is a god who penetrates into a place where no relaxation
(of the rules) is made for the privileged." <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)

Am-n-teh, overseer and director of the *larit*, tells us that there was
no repose for him, and that he never closed his eyes during the
night. <span id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md)

The presentation of the seal of the prefect alone could open the
door. <span id="fr_24"></span>[3](#fn_24.md) Thus Rekhmara caused the
storehouses to be constantly inspected by officials to whom he deputed
his powers. <span id="fr_25"></span>[4](#fn_25.md) Well guarded as they
were, he was constantly on the watch to assure himself that nothing was
wanting to their safety. But only himself or his deputy could enter
them; for all others the doors were carefully closed, and it was he who
consigned the care of them to the guards. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[5](#fn_26.md) The officials were empowered to strike
even a delegate of the government who had not presented the seal and
produced his authorisation to enter. <span id="fr_27"></span>[6](#fn_27.md)

But the prefect did not confine himself to the superintendence of the
storehouses; he also saw that they were filled, since on his supervision
depended for his subordinates abundance or death. When Egypt

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

had become a conquering, maritime, and commercial power, foreign
countries further contributed to the support of the *larit;* the tombs
of Rekhmara and Am-n-teh show us the wines of Syria, the essences and
woods of Comal imported from afar and passing through the bazaars of
Coptos. But it was still the taxes which furnished corn, the most
necessary of provisions, and it is probable that under Ptah-hotep Egypt
was engaged solely in filling with it its magazines. The tomb of
Rekhmara depicts for us the labourers presenting the agents of the
prefect with their crop of wheat, in order that the government might
receive its share. They empty their baskets and form a heap, from which
the delegate of the treasury measures out the amount due to the
State. <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) The tax must have been
somewhat heavy. The Bible tells us that Joseph took from the
agricultural population the fifth part of their grain to store the
*larits* in view of a famine (Gen. xlvii. 24). In any case the taxpayers
who came so humbly before Rekhmara, with their faces to the ground, must
in reality have been less submissive than they appeared to be through
fear of the stick. Even Ptah-hotep mistrusted the tendency to revolt
which might lie hid under such forced humility, and it was not enough
for him that the taxpayer should put on a submissive air when paying his
tax, it was necessary that his manner should be gay. "Let thy
countenance be cheerful," he says, "during the time of thy

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

existence. When we see one leaving the storehouse who has entered in
order to bring his moiety of provisions, with the countenance
contracted, it shows that his stomach is empty and that authority is
offensive to him. Let not this be thy case." <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) He is continually recalling the services
rendered by the Government and declaring that it is not sufficient to
serve it; it is necessary to love it and cause it to be loved. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30.md) If there are superiors and inferiors, it
is because God has so willed it; <span id="fr_31"></span>[3](#fn_31.md) all
authority, all governors, are entitled to respect; when things are
prosperous, the absence of submission to authority may endanger
them. <span id="fr_32"></span>[4](#fn_32.md) The inferior ought to obey
blindly and execute all commands without discussing them; <span
id="fr_33"></span>[5](#fn_33.md) however he may act in obeying a superior,
his conscience is clear before God; <span id="fr_34"></span>[6](#fn_34.md)
the superior alone is responsible.

In return for the submission which it exacts, the Government takes care
of the wants of the people; it supports and enables them to live. In the
tomb of Rekhmara we see the workmen of foreign race presenting
themselves before the storehouses with sacks to be filled with
grain; <span id="fr_35"></span>[7](#fn_35.md) jars of oil, wine, etc., are
also distributed among them. In a similar

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

fashion the sons of Jacob came to fill their sacks in the storehouses
organised by Joseph. But Ptah-hotep reminds the great of the earth that
their duty is not only to protect in this way those whom God has
confided to their authority. He who is placed in front, at the head of a
large number of men, must be without reproach, and in spite of his power
never forget that there are laws. The forgetfulness of this principle is
the cause of revolutions; when the great neglect their duty, why should
not the small take their place? <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) It
is not of the counsels of the flatterers of to-day that it is needful to
take heed; it is of the judgment of posterity, which renders justice to
righteous actions. <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md) To appear before
it with honour, it is necessary to reverence knowledge and wisdom; to
observe in everything a just moderation; <span
id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38.md) not to abuse one's powers; and to seek to
inspire love rather than fear. For God forbids us to terrify the
feeble; <span id="fr_39"></span>[4](#fn_39.md) on the contrary, we are as
gods to the inferiors, whose confidence we have known how to gain. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[5](#fn_40.md) The great man should remember that he is
only the dispenser of the gifts of God, and if, being of low origin, He
has attained to high honour, he must not, as is too often the case, be
puffed up by his good fortune, but should consider the new duties which
his rank imposes on him. <span id="fr_41"></span>[6](#fn_41.md) His
position makes of

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

him a steward of God, but a responsible steward. For if the inferior has
no responsibility in obeying, the superior has in commanding and cannot
avoid it. God has imposed different duties according to different
stations in life. Thus the inferior who carries the message of a
superior to a superior must transmit it faithfully and exactly, even if
he thinks that the communication will not be well received. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) On his side, the superior who sits in the
council must declare candidly what he believes best, even in presence of
the president, however exalted he may be, and not twist his words so as
not to compromise himself. <span id="fr_43"></span>[2](#fn_43.md) He must
only see that he does not deceive himself, since to deliberate in the
council is not a pastime, <span id="fr_44"></span>[3](#fn_44.md) and he
must for that end work hard and devote himself to his task. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[4](#fn_45.md) Responsibility and continuous labour is
the lot of him who watches over the public weal. In return it is right
that he should obtain some compensations. His life is not subject to the
discretion of any one; within the limits of his conscience he is the
master of his own actions; but it is the reward of his labours;
moreover, if the conditions of life differ in this world, it is because
God has so willed it. <span id="fr_46"></span>[5](#fn_46.md)

There are of course duties common to all men, at least to all who can
read Ptah-hotep, for his book is addressed to the educated
classes. <span id="fr_47"></span>[6](#fn_47.md) Thus the great must abstain
from plundering as the small from

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

thieving; <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) each must love his
household and his wife, <span id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49.md) making her
happy; <span id="fr_50"></span>[3](#fn_50.md) must treat his people well,
being recompensed in return by their good will; <span
id="fr_51"></span>[4](#fn_51.md) must avoid licentiousness; <span
id="fr_52"></span>[5](#fn_52.md) must listen without anger to a just
observation and feel no resentment towards him who has made it; <span
id="fr_53"></span>[6](#fn_53.md) must shun bad temper and walk in loyalty
and frankness; <span id="fr_54"></span>[7](#fn_54.md) must exercise his
power of criticism in judging himself rather than others; <span
id="fr_55"></span>[8](#fn_55.md) must speak pleasantly, and refer to that
which is bad by showing that it is bad, but without passion; <span
id="fr_56"></span>[9](#fn_56.md) must argue with courtesy, answering with
kindness him who deceives himself, and not be rude to him should he
display ignorance. <span id="fr_57"></span>[10](#fn_57.md)

But among all other duties there is one on which the book insists
specially; every one should labour to make his son a true gentleman, and
not allow the authority given him by God to be weakened. <span
id="fr_58"></span>[11](#fn_58.md) The father ought to command, the son to
obey, in order that he may be worthy of governing one day in his turn
the children which may be born to him. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[12](#fn_59.md) "Good when he obeys and good when he
commands, whoever has obeyed has profited, and it is profitable to obey
him who has obeyed. The son who accepts the word of his father will
attain old age on that account. God wishes us to obey; disobedience is
abhorrent

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

to Him." <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md) Accordingly the father must
display no weakness; a son without principles will bring grief to his
parents; <span id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_61.md) on the other hand, when the
son is obedient to his father, it is a double joy for both. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[3](#fn_62.md)

It is not astonishing that Ptah-hotep paid so much attention to paternal
authority; the family is the foundation of society, and the school of
obedience is the family. Docile children will not be turbulent subjects
to the prefect.

The whole system of morality is practical. "Moreover," says Professor
Maspero, "we must not expect to find in this work deep profundity of
conception.… Ptah-hotep does not trouble himself to invent or to draw
conclusions." <span id="fr_63"></span>[4](#fn_63.md) This pleases God; that
displeases Him; such is the ordinary argument, at least when the author
does not offer, as the sanction of his morality, the hope of a good
place for the laborious and docile student, <span
id="fr_64"></span>[5](#fn_64.md) the hope of a long life for the obedient
son, <span id="fr_65"></span>[6](#fn_65.md) and the hope of being
faithfully served by his domestics for the good master. <span
id="fr_66"></span>[7](#fn_66.md)

The artlessness which we find in these counsels should not make us
inattentive to the spirit of refinement which also appears in the
writings of Ptah-hotep. He is not the author of the precepts which he
gives; his practical philosophy has been bequeathed to him by his
ancestors, <span id="fr_67"></span>[8](#fn_67.md) but he has put the

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

precepts in verse in order to establish them in the memory of mankind;
the poetical form in which he clothes them is intended to preserve them
from alteration in the future. <span id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md) The
most ancient book in the world is therefore a rhythmic, if not a
poetical, work, and we can gather from this to what a height
civilisation had already attained. Although the author himself
recognises that humanity leas still much progress to make, and that the
learned are in reality only students, <span
id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_69.md) this fact alone would suffice to prove
that Egyptian society had long since left barbarism behind it <span
id="fr_70"></span>[3](#fn_70.md) in the reign of Assa when Ptah-hotep
compiled his treatise, as he tells us at its commencement.

of etiquette. Under Amenophis II there were at least two commanders of
the royal armies, Amenemheb and Pehsukher, whose wives were royal
nurses. As it is very improbable that there were two nurses, both of
whom married, one after the other, the commanders of his army, we must
suppose that the wife of the commander, in virtue of the dignity of her
husband, could claim the same rank as one who had really been a nurse of
the king.

the verb "to bring" sometimes signifies "to carry away," Ptah-hotep had
here in view not taxpayers who found that the State took too much away
