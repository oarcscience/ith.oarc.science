#### <span class="smallcaps">X.—Letter of Dusratta to Amenophis III</span> <span id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_337.md)

<span class="small">OBVERSE</span>

1\. \[To\] Nimmuriya the great king, the king of <span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>, \[my\] brother,  
2. my son-in-law, who loves me, and whom I love  
3. it is said as follows: Tusratta, the great king, thy father in law

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

4\. who loves thee, the king of <span class="smallcaps">Mittanni</span>,
thy brother.  
5. Unto myself (is) peace; unto thee may there be peace, to thy house,  
6. to my sister, <span id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_338.md) and to the rest
of thy wives, to thy sons,  
7. to thy chariots, to thy horses, to thy noble(s),  
8. to thy country and to thy property may there be abundant peace!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

9\. Until the time of thy fathers, they with my fathers were in
closest  
10. alliance; <span id="fr_340"></span>[2](#fn_339.md) since then thou hast
perfected <span id="fr_341"></span>[3](#fn_340) (it.md), and with my
father  
11. wert in exceedingly close alliance.  
12. Now thou, since (thou) and I love one another,  
13. hast established (it) ten times more than in my father's time.  
14. May the gods direct them, <span id="fr_342"></span>[4](#fn_341.md) and
this our alliance  
15. may <span class="smallcaps">Rimmon</span> <span
id="fr_343"></span>[5](#fn_342.md) my lord and <span
class="smallcaps">Amanum</span> <span id="fr_344"></span>[6](#fn_343.md)
for ever as now  
16, *confirm* (?).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

17\. And when my brother sent Manê his ambassador,  
18. saying: O my brother, let thy daughter be my wife  
19. and mistress of the land of <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>, I
did not vex the heart <span id="fr_345"></span>[7](#fn_344.md)  
20. of my brother and spoke publicly according to (his) wish, <span
id="fr_346"></span>[8](#fn_345.md)  
21. and her whom my brother asked for I showed to Manê,

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

22\. and he saw her. When he had seen her he much approved <span
id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_346.md) of her;  
23. and in peace in the country of my brother may I know her:  
24. may <span class="smallcaps">Istar</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Amanum</span> according to the heart of my brother
advise her!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

25\. Giliya my messenger reported unto me the words of my brother.  
26. When I heard (them) it was very good, I rejoiced very  
27. exceedingly saying: Verily unto me has this favour happened, <span
id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_347.md) and  
28. whereas in consequence of the alliance that (was) between us we
loved (each other),  
29. now in consequence of these words we shall love (each other) for
ever.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

30\. When I had sent to my brother and had said thus: As for me,  
31. very exceedingly do we love (each other) and in alliance  
32. we have been friendly; then to my brother I said thus: My brother  
33. has honoured me ten times above my father!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

34\. And I asked much gold of my brother saying: Above my father  
35. may my brother set me and may my brother send (it) to me.  
36. And to my father didst thou send much gold;  
37. an oblation-dish of solid gold and a cup <span
id="fr_349"></span>[3](#fn_348.md) of solid gold didst thou send to him;  
38. a brick of gold like molten bronze didst thou send to me.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

39\. I sent Giliya on an embassy to my brother and \[much\] gold  
40. I asked for saying: As for me may my brother  
41. above my father honour me, and much gold  
42. which cannot be counted may he send me,

<span class="small">REVERSE</span>

1\. may my brother send me more than to my father.  
2. And then I said thus to my brother: Thy standard,  
3. which my grandfather made saying: As for me, that  
4. it may last I have *painted* the work *red* (?), I have constructed
(it) again for thee;  
5. and thereupon I further said: The gold which my brother will send  
6. let him send for the dowry.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

7\. Again my brother sends gold (and) I say thus:  
8. The amount is much, <span id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_349.md) for the
supply of the amount is much; and unto the (fitting) quantity  
9. it reaches, for thus it reaches exactly unto the (fitting)
quantity;  
10. and on this account I have rejoiced greatly, and for all  
11. that my brother has sent for this I have rejoiced exceedingly.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

12\. Now again I send to my brother, and may my brother  
13. grant me friendship above what (he granted) to my father. Now  
14. have I asked gold of my brother, and the gold which of my brother  
15. I have asked, has twice been asked for, <span
id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_350.md) once  
16. because of thy standard and a second time for the dowry.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

17\. And, O my brother, gold in good earnest which cannot be counted

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

18\. may my brother send unto me, and may my brother send more gold than
(he sent) my father,  
19. since in the midst of the country of my brother gold is as plentiful
as dust.  
20. May the gods reveal <span id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_351.md) it, and as
at present in the country  
21. of my brother gold is plentiful, so ten times more than at present  
22. may he extract gold; and may the gold, which I have asked for, in
the heart of my brother  
23. not cause vexation, and O my loved one, my heart let not my
brother  
24. vex, but let my brother the gold which cannot be counted  
25. in good earnest send unto me!  
26. And whatsoever my brother desires let him send for to the house
where it is, and  
27. let (the messenger) go and I will give the present which my brother
has asked for.  
28. This country (is) my brother's country, and this house (is) my
brother's house.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

29\. Now I send my ambassador Giliya to my brother, and let my brother  
30. not detain him. Let him dismiss him with a costly present, and let
him go.  
31. May I rejoice very exceedingly when I hear of my brother's
present;  
32. may I hear for ever of my brother's present.  
33. And as for this letter <span id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_352.md) which
we have sent may <span class="smallcaps">Rimmon</span> <span
id="fr_354"></span>[3](#fn_353.md) my lord  
34. and <span class="smallcaps">Amanum</span> <span
id="fr_355"></span>[4](#fn_354.md) direct them, <span
id="fr_356"></span>[5](#fn_355.md) and unto their destination  
35. may they attain, and as (things are) at present so may they continue
with them.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

36\. As at present we love (one another), so, as at present,  
37. for ever may we love (one another)!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

38\. Now for a present to my brother, one goblet of gold set with
crystals  
39. (around) its cup; one heavy necklace of 20 crystal beads, and 19
(beads) of gold,  
40. in its centre a crystal (amulet) encased in gold; one heavy necklace
of 42 *khulalu* stones  
41. (and) 40 gold beads, the metal of which (is) … of <span
class="smallcaps">Istar</span>, (in) its centre an (amulet) of *khulalu*
stone cased in gold;  
42. 10 pairs of horses; 10 chariots of wood, together with their
furniture;  
43. and 30 eunuchs I have sent for a present to my brother.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_337"></span>[84:1](rp20321.htm#fr_338.md) Budge,
*Proceedings*, pll. i.–iv.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[85:1](rp20321.htm#fr_339.md) That is to say, his
daughter Tadukhepa, who being the wife of his "brother" had thus become
his sister.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[85:2](rp20321.htm#fr_340.md) Literally "loved."

<span id="fn_340"></span>[85:3](rp20321.htm#fr_341.md) Literally
"fulfilled" (it).

<span id="fn_341"></span>[85:4](rp20321.htm#fr_342.md) If the copy is
correct, Dusratta must have written "them" in mistake for "us."

<span id="fn_342"></span>[85:5](rp20321.htm#fr_343.md) Called Tessubbe or
Tessupa, in the language of Mitanni, as we learn from a letter of
Dusratta which is written in that dialect. The name is written Tessupa
in an Assyrian letter of Dusratta (W. 24. 79.)

<span id="fn_343"></span>[85:6](rp20321.htm#fr_344.md) The Egyptian Amon.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[85:7](rp20321.htm#fr_345.md) So Zimmern.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[85:8](rp20321.htm#fr_346.md) *Annimâ*,
"favourably." Dr. Zimmern renders *ina panatimma* ("publicly") "in joy,"
considering it to stand for *ina banatimma*.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[86:1](rp20321.htm#fr_347.md) *Yuttehizzi*, in
correct Assyrian *yuttehi's'si* from *nanâdu*, "to honour."

<span id="fn_347"></span>[86:2](rp20321.htm#fr_348.md) Literally, "been
made to enter."

<span id="fn_348"></span>[86:3](rp20321.htm#fr_349.md) *Sakharratu*.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[87:1](rp20321.htm#fr_350.md) *Mâtus*.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[87:2](rp20321.htm#fr_351.md) Literally, "goes
twice to be asked for."

<span id="fn_351"></span>[88:1](rp20321.htm#fr_352.md) Literally,
"dismiss."

<span id="fn_352"></span>[88:2](rp20321.htm#fr_353.md) Literally, "words."

<span id="fn_353"></span>[88:3](rp20321.htm#fr_354.md) Tessubbe in the
language of Mitanni.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[88:4](rp20321.htm#fr_355.md) Amon.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[88:5](rp20321.htm#fr_356.md) The scribe forgets
that he has written the feminine *amâtum* in the preceding line, and
uses the masculine *sunuti*, as if "messengers" had been spoken of.
