#### V.—<span class="smallcaps">Letter from Aziru to his Father Dûdu</span>. <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_282)

1\. To Dûdu my lord, my father,  
2. thus (speak I) Aziru thy servant;  
3. at the feet of my lord I prostrate myself.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4\. Khatib has gone  
5. and has *answered* (?) the words  
6. of the king my lord publicly and well,  
7. and I have rejoiced exceedingly;  
8. and my country and my brothers,  
9. the servants of the king my lord  
10. and the servants of Dûdu my lord,  
11. have rejoiced exceedingly.  
12. Behold, there has gone  
13. the prince <span id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_283) of the king my
lord  
14. unto me. From the commands  
15. of my lord, my god, my Sun-god,  
16. and from the commands of Dûdu  
17. my lord, I do not free myself.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

18\. Now, O my lord, Khatib  
19. remains with me.  
20. I and he <span id="fr_285"></span>[3](#fn_284) will go (together).  
21. O my lord, the king of the land of the <span
class="smallcaps">Hittites</span>

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

22\. has marched into the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Nukhasse</span>  
23. but has not prevailed over the cities.  
24. May the king of the land of the <span
class="smallcaps">Hittites</span> quit (them)!  
25. Therefore now have (we) marched,  
26. (even) I and Khatib.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

27\. May the king my lord listen to  
28. my words. O my lord, I am afraid  
29. of the king my lord  
30. and of Dûdu.  
31. And now my gods  
32. and my messengers also are the men  
33. of Dûdu and the nobles  
34. of the king my lord, and I march.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

35\. And thus (speak) Dûdu  
36. and the king my lord and the nobles:  
37. If ever we publish anything  
38. about Aziru which is not right  
39. (let it be) before my gods and before my god, <span
id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_285)  
40. and now I  
41. and Khatib (are) servant(s) of the king before (him)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

42\. O Dûdu, verily thou *knowest* (?),  
43. behold, I go to thee.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_282"></span>[69:1](rp20316.htm#fr_283) Winckler and Abel,
*Mittheilungen*, ii. p. 45.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[69:2](rp20316.htm#fr_284) *Sarru*, which must
not be interpreted "servant" here, but "prince," like the Heb. *sar*. In
correct Assyrian *sarru* is "king," *malku* (*melech*) "prince," but the
writer of the letter follows the Canaanitish usage.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[69:3](rp20316.htm#fr_285) *Sûtu*, a curious
derivative from *sû* "he," like *yati* "myself."

<span id="fn_285"></span>[70:1](rp20316.htm#fr_286) In place of the
anacoluthon we may translate, "(it is) against my gods and against my
god." In another letter of Aziru (No. 39), we read, "A second time (I
say) to Dûdu my lord; hear the words of the kings of Nukhasse (which)
they have spoken against me."
