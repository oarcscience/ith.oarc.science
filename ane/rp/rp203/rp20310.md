# HYMN TO THE NILE

#### I

<span class="smallcaps">Adoration</span> to the <span
class="smallcaps">Nile</span>!  
Hail to thee, O <span class="smallcaps">Nile</span>!  
who manifesteth thyself over this land,  
and comest to give life to <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>!  
Mysterious is thy issuing forth from the darkness,  
on this day whereon it is celebrated!  
Watering the orchards created by <span class="smallcaps">Ra</span> <span
id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_217.md)  
to cause all the cattle to live,  
thou givest the earth to drink, inexhaustible one!  
Path that descendest from the sky, <span
id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_218.md)  
loving the bread of <span class="smallcaps">Seb</span> and the
firstfruits of <span class="smallcaps">Nepera</span>,  
thou causest the workshops of <span class="smallcaps">Ptah</span> <span
id="fr_219"></span>[3](#fn_219.md) to prosper!

#### II

Lord of the fish, during the inundation,  
no bird alights on the crops.  
Thou createst the corn, thou bringest forth the barley,  
assuring perpetuity to the temples. <span
id="fr_220"></span>[4](#fn_220.md)  
If thou ceasest thy toil and thy work,  
then all that exists is in anguish.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

If the gods suffer in heaven <span id="fr_221"></span>[1](#fn_221.md)  
then the faces of men waste away.

#### III

Then he torments the flocks of <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>, and
great and small are in agony.  
But all is changed for mankind when he comes;  
he is endowed with the qualities of <span
class="smallcaps">Num</span>. <span id="fr_222"></span>[2](#fn_222.md)  
If he shines, the earth is joyous,  
every stomach is full of rejoicing,  
every spine is happy,  
every jaw-bone crushes (its food).

#### IV

He brings the offerings, <span id="fr_223"></span>[3](#fn_223.md) as chief
of provisioning;  
he is the creator of all good things,  
as master of energy, full of sweetness in his choice.  
If offerings are made it is thanks to him.  
He brings forth the herbage for the flocks, <span
id="fr_224"></span>[4](#fn_224.md)  
and sees that each god receives his sacrifices.  
All that depends on him is a precious incense.  
He spreads himself over <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>,  
filling the granaries, renewing the marts,  
watching over the goods of the unhappy.

#### V

He is prosperous to the height of all desires,  
without fatiguing himself therefor.  
He brings again his lordly bark;  
he is not sculptured in stone, in the statues crowned with the uræus
serpent,

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

he cannot be contemplated.  
No servitors has he, no bearers of offerings!  
He is not enticed by incantations!  
None knows the place where he dwells,  
None discovers his retreat by the power of a written spell. <span
id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_225.md)

#### VI

No dwelling (is there) which may contain thee!  
None penetrates within thy heart!  
Thy young men, thy children applaud thee  
and render unto thee royal homage.  
Stable are thy decrees for <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span> <span
id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_226.md)  
before thy servants of the North! <span
id="fr_227"></span>[3](#fn_227.md)  
He stanches the water from all eyes  
and watches over the increase of his good things.

#### VII

Where misery existed, joy manifests itself;  
all beasts rejoice.  
The children of <span class="smallcaps">Sebek</span>, the sons of <span
class="smallcaps">Neit</span>, <span id="fr_228"></span>[4](#fn_228.md)  
the cycle of the gods which dwells in him, are prosperous.  
No more reservoirs for watering the fields!  
He makes mankind valiant,  
enriching some, bestowing his love on others.  
None commands at the same time as himself.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

He creates the offerings without the aid of <span
class="smallcaps">Neit</span>, <span id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_229.md)  
making mankind for himself with multiform care.

#### VIII

He shines when he issues forth from the darkness,  
to cause his flocks to prosper.  
It is his force that gives existence to all things;  
nothing remains hidden for him.  
Let men clothe themselves to fill his gardens.  
He watches over his works,  
producing the inundation during the night. <span
id="fr_230"></span>[2](#fn_230.md)  
It is a god <span class="smallcaps">Ptah</span> … <span
id="fr_231"></span>[3](#fn_231.md)  
He causes all his servants to exist,  
all writings and divine words, <span id="fr_232"></span>[4](#fn_232.md)  
and that which he needs in the North.

#### IX

It is with the words that he penetrates into his dwelling;  
he issues forth at his pleasure through the magic spells. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[5](#fn_233.md)  
Thy unkindness brings destruction to the fish;  
it is then that prayer is made for the (annual) water of the season;  
Southern <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span> is seen in the same state
as the North.  
Each one is with his instruments of labour,

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

none remains behind his companions.  
None clothes himself with garments,  
the children of the noble put aside their ornaments.  
The night remains silent,  
but all is changed by the inundation;  
it is a healing-balm for all mankind.

#### X

Establisher of justice! mankind desires thee,  
supplicating thee to answer their prayers;  
thou answerest them by the inundation!  
Men offer the first-fruits of corn;  
all the gods adore thee!  
The birds descend not on the soil.  
It is believed that with thy hand of gold  
thou makest bricks of silver!  
But we are not nourished on lapis-lazuli;  
corn alone gives vigour. <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_234.md)

#### XI

A festal song is raised for thee on the harp,  
with the accompaniment of the hand. <span
id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_235.md)  
Thy young men and thy children acclaim thee  
and prepare their (long) exercises.  
Thou art the august ornament of the earth,  
letting thy bark advance before men,  
lifting up the heart of women in labour,  
and loving the multitude of the flocks.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

#### XII

When thou shinest in the royal city, <span
id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_236.md)  
the rich man is sated with good things,  
the poor man even disdains the lotus;  
all that is produced is of the choicest;  
all the plants exist for thy children.  
If thou hast refused (to grant) nourishment,  
the dwelling is silent, devoid of all that is good  
the country falls exhausted.

#### XIII

O inundation of the <span class="smallcaps">Nile</span>,  
offerings are made unto thee,  
oxen are immolated to thee,  
great festivals are instituted for thee.  
Birds are sacrificed to thee,  
gazelles are taken for thee in the mountain,  
pure flames are prepared for thee. <span
id="fr_237"></span>[2](#fn_237.md)  
Sacrifice is made to every god as it is made to the <span
class="smallcaps">Nile</span>. <span id="fr_238"></span>[3](#fn_238.md)  
The <span class="smallcaps">Nile</span> has made its retreats in
Southern <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>,  
its name is not known beyond the <span
class="smallcaps">Tuau</span>. <span id="fr_239"></span>[4](#fn_239.md)  
The god manifests not his forms,  
he baffles all conception.

#### XIV

Men exalt him like the cycle of the gods,  
they dread him who creates the heat,  
even him who has made his son <span id="fr_240"></span>[5](#fn_240.md) the
universal master  
in order to give prosperity to <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>.  
Come (and) prosper! come (and) prosper!

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

O Nile, come (and) prosper!  
\[O thou who makest men to live through his flocks <span
id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_241.md)  
and his flocks through his orchards!  
Come (and) prosper, come,  
O <span class="smallcaps">Nile</span>, come (and) prosper!\]  
This work has been successfully finished and dedicated to the scribe of
the treasury Qaqabu \[by the scribe Ennana\]. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_217"></span>[48:1](rp20310.htm#fr_217.md) The orchards of
<span class="smallcaps">Ra</span> are mentioned in the Book of the Dead,
ch. 81.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[48:2](rp20310.htm#fr_218.md) This belief in the
celestial origin of the Nile survived in Egypt, at all events as late as
the time of Joinville (*Histoire de Saint-Louis*, ch. xl.).

<span id="fn_219"></span>[48:3](rp20310.htm#fr_219.md) Ptah is associated
with the Nile in a list of divinities represented on a wall of the age
of Ramses II at Karnak (Champollion: *Not. Manuscrites* II. p. 255,
where Ptah is called *Ptah*, *pa Hapi aā*).

<span id="fn_220"></span>[48:4](rp20310.htm#fr_220.md) In the Anastasisi
text: "Causing the temples to keep holiday."

<span id="fn_221"></span>[49:1](rp20310.htm#fr_221.md) The Nile is not only
the dispenser of life to mankind, but also to the gods (see verses 4,
10, 53). In the Hymn it absorbs as it were all the gods, and even takes
the place of Ra in verse 14.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[49:2](rp20310.htm#fr_222.md) Num, the divine
creator, like Ptah, is similar to Ptah in his relation to the Nile. The
two verses point out that all life is dependent on the Nile, an idea
which is developed to excess in the verses following.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[49:3](rp20310.htm#fr_223.md) Funerary offerings
made to the *ka* or "double."

<span id="fn_224"></span>[49:4](rp20310.htm#fr_224.md) See verse 14.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[50:1](rp20310.htm#fr_225.md) The gods had to
submit to the power of incantations and magic formulæ (compare the
legend of Ra bitten by a serpent, the romance of Setnau, and numerous
passages in the Book of the Dead). The Nile alone was excepted from this
law; it remained enshrouded in mystery in its retreat near the two
whirlpools often mentioned in the texts and even alluded to by
Herodotus.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[50:2](rp20310.htm#fr_226.md) So in the Anastasi
text. The fixity of the periodic return of the Nile is probably referred
to.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[50:3](rp20310.htm#fr_227.md) Verse 5 has,
however, stated that the Nile had no servants; perhaps the secondary
gods are meant here who directed the spread of the waters over Egypt,
that is to the north of the whirlpools from whence the Nile rose.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[50:4](rp20310.htm#fr_228.md) Neit is often
represented with two crocodiles on the breast; her relation to Sebek,
the crocodile-god, is difficult to define.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[51:1](rp20310.htm#fr_229.md) Neit appears here as
the goddess of production; the Nile has no need of Neit (or perhaps the
rain) in order to generate the crops; it makes its way throughout the
country by means of canals and trenches.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[51:2](rp20310.htm#fr_230.md) This seems to be an
allusion to the festival of the "Night of the Drop" (*Lêlet en-Nuqta*),
still observed in Egypt on the 5th of June, when the rise of the Nile is
supposed to commence. The name is due to the old tradition recorded by
Plutarch, according to which the rise of the Nile was caused by a tear
which dropped into it from the eye of Isis. In M. Amélineau's *Contes et
Romans de l’Egypte Chrétiennes*, i. p. 17, the rise of the Nile is
attributed to the intercession of St. Michael, whose festival is
celebrated on the 6th of June; three days before, the archangel prays
that the water may rise, since it is "the life of men and animals."

<span id="fn_231"></span>[51:3](rp20310.htm#fr_231.md) Unknown word,
conjectured by Cook to represent the name of a new god *Kabes*.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[51:4](rp20310.htm#fr_232.md) The Nile inspires
Thoth the scribe of the divine utterances.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[51:5](rp20310.htm#fr_233.md) The Nile is
unaffected by incantations, but serves himself with them at his pleasure
in order to manifest himself.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[52:1](rp20310.htm#fr_234.md) The Nile is indeed
the dispenser of all wealth, but true wealth does not consist in gold or
silver, but of the products of agriculture which enable men to live.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[52:2](rp20310.htm#fr_235.md) Women are
represented on the monuments accompanying the singers by clapping the
hands; this custom still survives throughout the East. It is possible
that we still possess the festal songs of the Nile, of which Lane has
preserved for us some fragments in his work on *The Modern Egyptians*.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[53:1](rp20310.htm#fr_236.md) Probably Thebes, the
residence of the Pharaohs at the time when the Hymn was composed. No
other city can be meant, as otherwise the mythological texts would have
mentioned it. Thebes, moreover, is near Silsilis, where the height of
the Nile was measured, as is indicated by the Book of the Dead, chap.
149, and the royal decrees of Silsilis, which institute festivals in
honour of the Nile.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[53:2](rp20310.htm#fr_237.md) These offerings are
mentioned in the decrees of Silsilis.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[53:3](rp20310.htm#fr_238.md) See verse 7.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[53:4](rp20310.htm#fr_239.md) The other world.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[53:5](rp20310.htm#fr_240.md) The Pharaoh.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[54:1](rp20310.htm#fr_241.md) From the *Anastasi*
papyrus.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[54:2](rp20310.htm#fr_242.md) See the *Papyrus
Anastasi* 7, pl. 7, ll. 5 and 6.
