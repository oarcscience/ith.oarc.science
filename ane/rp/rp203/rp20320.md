#### IX.—<span class="smallcaps">Letter of Dusratta to Amenophis IV</span> <span id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_323.md)

<span class="small">OBVERSE</span>

1\. \[To Napkhûri\]ya my son-in-law whom I love and who loves \[me\],  
2. \[Dusratta\], the great king, \[the king of <span
class="smallcaps">Mita</span>\]<span class="smallcaps">nni</span>, thy
brother, thy father-in-law, who loves thee: unto me (is) peace;  
3. \[to thee and\] Teie \[thy mother, and to\] Tadukhêpa my daughter,
thy wife, may there be \[peace\]!  
4. \[To …\] may there be peace! To thy sons, to thy nobles, to thy
chariots, to \[thy\] horses,  
5. \[to\] thy \[country\], and to thy property may there be exceeding
peace!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6\. \[I sent an embassy?\] to Nimmuriya, and thy father sent to me …  
7. \[and as regards\] the message which he sent, there was no word
whatsoever which \[was concealed from?\]  
8. \[the ambassadors\] of thy father whom he sent \[to\] me; and Teie
the chief wife of thy father,  
9. thy mother, \[knew?\] them all; he *showed* (?) them to Teie and
*favoured* (?) all of them, and *after* (?) them  
10. thy father \[repeated?\] the words which he had spoken with me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

11\. … exceedingly, and \[the words which I spoke\] with Nimmuriya thy
father whom we love,  
12. \[and the words which\] Nimmuriya thy father spoke with me, he (and)
I, my heart in nothing  
13. did they vex, and all the words which I spoke those also on that
day  
14. did not vex the heart of \[thy father, my\] beloved one, in
anything, and all that  
15. \[I said\] these also did he perform on that day.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

16\. \[Now Manakhbia <span id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_324.md)\] the father
of \[N\]immuriya sent to Artatâma the father of my father, and the
daughter \[of\]  
17. \[Artatâma, the father\] of my father he asked for; 5 times, 6 times
he sends, but (Artatâma) did not give her; at last  
18. \[his daughter\] he sends and with a train (of handmaids) he gave
her. An embassy from Nimmûriya thy father to Sut\[tarna <span
id="fr_326"></span>[2](#fn_325.md)\]  
19. \[my father came\], and the daughter of my father, my darling
sister, though he asked for her and seven times \[requested her\],  
20. \[my father did not give.\] At last five times and six times he
sends and (my father) gave \[her\] with a train (of handmaids).  
21. \[When\] Nimmûriya \[thy father\] sent to me and when he asked for
my daughter, I did not \[refuse\],  
22. \[but\] I spoke favourably; to his messenger I speak as follows: "I
am ready to give her; thy messenger among \[my\] children  
23. has come, and \[my\] eyes \[have seen\] the *aqqâti* which he has
given, and her dowry is worthy of yourself, <span
id="fr_327"></span>[3](#fn_326.md) and I will bestow \[on her\]  
24. the dowry due to Nimmûriya thy \[father\] which \[contains\]
*jewels* (?) \[such as\] no god possesses; and because I am
honoured <span id="fr_328"></span>[4](#fn_327.md) I do not. \[refuse\]  
25. to give her;" and Amasis <span id="fr_329"></span>[5](#fn_328.md) \[the
ambassador\] of my brother, \[who had come\] for the bride, I sent
(back) to Nimmûriya  
26. after three months, with a very costly present, and …, and four … of
gold \[such as\] none \[had given before\]

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

27\. \[and\] a goblet … of gold was given, which I \[despatched\].

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

28\. At last my daughter I gave \[to him\], and when \[I had\]
despatched her and when Nimmûriya thy father had seen <span
id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_329.md) her,  
29. … he rejoiced with exceeding fulness, and my brother speaks as
follows: "In the joy of my heart  
30. I will give her \[all her desire\]"; and he caused her to be united
publicly with his country <span id="fr_331"></span>[2](#fn_330.md); and
moreover my ambassador  
31. \[he honoured?\] like men … when he had seen \[him\], and he
honoured him, and ever did Nimmûriya  
32. \[place him\] in the front rank; and since he honoured the embassy,
so among the houses which \[he gave\] to Tadukhepa  
33. \[my daughter, he placed\] my \[servants\] all of them, and he made
(them) dwell round about <span id="fr_332"></span>[3](#fn_331.md) and in
the midst of my ambassadors, who entered  
34. \[his country\]. There was nothing which Giliya \[my ambassador did
not obtain?\]: gold which he gave a thousandfold in weight  
35. … Nimmûriya gave to \[Tadu\]khêpa and Tadukhêpa  
36. \[gave to Giliya?\] whatsoever he desired, and \[Giliya\] my
ambassador did Nimmûriya in friendship  
37. \[exalt and\] honour: then \[Nimm\]ûriya sent Nisag his ambassador  
38. \[on account of Tadukhêpa\] my darling sister, and along with
\[Nisag\] he sent slaves to my presence \[and\] objects of gold  
39. …… of gold … of Giliya; and ever  
40. …… \[Nimmûriya\] returned my friendship, \[and\] my ambassadors  
41. ……… I (?) did not send to the slaves

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

42\. ……… among the slaves when he sent  
43. …… he did not despatch to me, and … I despatched; an *object* (?) it
had not; and so  
44. \[Nimmû\]riya, thy father, in all the words \[he had\], one subject
for vexation did not leave.  
45. \[The words\] which I speak, all of them, … and a wish I do not
utter. Teie  
46. \[knows the truth of\] what I speak, and ask Teie thy \[mother\] if
among the words which I speak  
47. (there is) one word of falsehood … him did Nimmûriya thy father
\[honour?\], and  
48. Nimmûriya thy father made brotherhood \[and league?\] with me, and
Nimmûriya thy father  
49. did \[not\] say: At last the gold which \[thou desirest\] I have
forwarded <span id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_332.md) to the land of
Khani-rabbat; and when I went down and  
50. he did not send the \[gold which\] I asked for, \[to\] future
\[days\] it was left in the keeping of Nimmûriya  
51. thy \[father\]; and Nimmûriya said to \[my\] envoy: Furniture (and)
objects of gold, a profusion of everything  
52. \[which\] my brother has asked for, which was left \[here\], which
\[I have agreed to give\] and which my father agreed to give, I \[now\]
send to you.  
53 \[And\] so Nimmûriya thy father never changed his word to a
non-word;  
54. \[through what\] he said in words never did he cause vexation.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

55\. \[Now\] they say that Nimmûriya has died, <span
id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_333.md) and what they have said  
56. has distracted my heart, <span id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_334.md) and I
wept on that day,  
57. \[on my throne\] I did \[not\] sit. <span
id="fr_336"></span>[4](#fn_335.md) Bread and water on that day I did not
\[take\], and I was sad,  
58. \[and\] I \[said\]: If he is dead, in the land of my beloved

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (sister) and among
my \[servants\] are the objects (of gold), and  
59. \[his son will succeed him?\], and he loves me; or if he is alive
with the god <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_336.md) and …, we love  
60. \[one another, and on\] that account in our hearts we are \[not\]
distant (from each other).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

61\. \[And now to\] me the eldest son of Nimmûriya by Teie his wife  
62. has made \[offers of alliance and brotherhood\] and has spoken thus:
Nimmûriya is not dead  
63. \[since Napkhururi\]ya \[his\] eldest son by Teie his chief wife
(sits) in his place and  
64. will never at all alter \[his\] words from their place (but they
shall remain) as before.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

65\. \[Now to\] my \[brother\] I say as follows: \[Artat?\]ama my
brother whom we love in our hearts  
66. \[I have sent to? Napkhûriya\] the son of Nimmûriya his father
\[whom I\] honour on account of Teie his mother, who \[was chief\]
wife  
67. \[of Nimmûriya\] (and) loved (him) during the reign of (his) father,
in order that she may *repeat* (?) the words before Napkhûriya,  
68. \[even the words of Nimmû\]riya her husband, very earnestly, whom we
love.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

69\. Since \[Nimmûriya\] formerly sent an embassy to \[me\] when he
dismissed Giliya, and  
70. \[further\] sent Manê \[as ambassador\], and my brother despatched
objects of wood, and also gold  
71. …… \[saying\] that it (is) not gold and that I have not brought
(it)  
72. …… immediately from before the king

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

73\. Nimmû\[riya\] my brother forthwith \[despatched the object\]s which
my brother gave to me,  
74. \[saying, Take it?\] since I dig \[the mines\] very laboriously,  
75 and I \[answer\] thus: Nimmûriya my brother the presents  
76. despatched \[to me\], which Napkhûriya my brother, whom \[I love\],
has not increased above him  
77. ……… and what he despatched; and since ……  
78. ……… and before Manê …… I was vexed  
79. ……………

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

80\. …… \[the presents\] which my brother forwarded and  
81. …… \[I convened\] my nobles, saying: With my brother in
\[friendship\]  
82. \[I am united, as his fathers with\] my fathers in sooth and with
his fathers  
83. \[my fathers; I have received\] the gifts which my brother has sent
and  
84. …… we have rejoiced exceedingly and kept a day of festival.  
85. …… he fixed ourselves, and in the \[time\] of night thou thyself  
.      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_323"></span>[79:1](rp20320.htm#fr_324.md) Winckler and Abel:
*Mittheilungen*, i. p. 22.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[80:1](rp20320.htm#fr_325.md) Manakhbia is
mentioned as the father of Amenôphis III in a tablet now at Berlin
(Winckler and Abel, ii. No. 30). It represents the Egyptian
Menkhepru-(Ra) or Thothmes IV.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[80:2](rp20320.htm#fr_326.md) The name is restored
from the letter of Dusratta in the Mitannian language (Winckler and
Abel, i. p. 29, line 55). A scarab of Amenôphis III states that in the
tenth year of the Egyptian monarch, Satarna king of Nahrina sent his
daughter Kirgipa to Egypt with an escort of 317 maidens.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[80:3](rp20320.htm#fr_327.md) Literally "like
yourself."

<span id="fn_327"></span>[80:4](rp20320.htm#fr_328.md) Literally "made
illustrious."

<span id="fn_328"></span>[80:5](rp20320.htm#fr_329.md) *Khâmasi*.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[81:1](rp20320.htm#fr_330.md) We must read
*itamar*.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[81:2](rp20320.htm#fr_331.md) Literally "he
performed the affiliation of that (lady) in public with his country."

<span id="fn_331"></span>[81:3](rp20320.htm#fr_332.md) *Zikhkhirti* for
*’sikhirti*. *Sasba*, "he made dwell," is the permansive Shaphel.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[82:1](rp20320.htm#fr_333.md) We must read
*u-se-its-tsi*.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[82:2](rp20320.htm#fr_334.md) Literally "has gone
to his destiny."

<span id="fn_334"></span>[82:3](rp20320.htm#fr_335.md) Such seems to be the
signification of the text. The verb *ultebsil* is literally "caused to
seethe."

<span id="fn_335"></span>[82:4](rp20320.htm#fr_336.md) \[*At*\]*tasab*.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[83:1](rp20320.htm#fr_337.md) It is unfortunate
that the mutilation of the text makes it impossible to state with
certainty what is the context of this interesting phrase.
