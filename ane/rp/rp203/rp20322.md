#### <span class="smallcaps">XI.—Letter of Dusratta to Amenophis IV</span> <span id="fr_357"></span>[1](#fn_356)

<span class="small">OBVERSE</span>

1\. To Napkhurruriya the king of <span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>,  
2. my brother, my son-in-law, who loves \[me\],  
3. and (whom) I love, it is said  
4. as follows: Dusratta, king of the country of <span
class="smallcaps">Mittani</span>,  
5. thy father-in-law, who loves thee, speaks thus:  
6. Unto myself (is) peace; unto thee may there be peace,  
7. unto thy houses, Teie thy mother, and the land of <span
class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>,  
8. to Tâdukhêpa my daughter, thy wife,  
9. to the rest of thy wives, to thy sons, to thy soldiers  
10. and thy chariots, to thy horses, to thy men,  
11. to thy country and to all that thou hast, may there be very abundant
peace!

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

12\. Pirizzi and Pupri my ambassadors  
13. I have sent to my brother to explain, and  
14. have addressed them with great trouble and earnestness,  
15. and I have sent them *in a body* (?) <span
id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_357);  
16. and this speech beforehand  
17. I make to my brother: Manê, thy ambassador  
18. I detain, and Umeatu my messenger. …  
19. I will dismiss, and the prophet <span
id="fr_359"></span>[2](#fn_358) shall go \[to thee\].

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

20\. And now my brother to \[their own land?\]  
21. has not permitted them to go, but has detained them  
22. overmuch. Wherefore has he not  
23. protected the ambassadors? They have fled, and (there is) guilt  
24. on my brother in respect of the ambassadors. Why is his heart  
25. \[angered\]? Why has he *spoken* (?) before the face of …  
26 \[Pup\]ru has not returned and he has *spoken* (?).  
27. … his offers of alliance he does not listen to.  
28. \[Yet I,\] O son-in-law, (am) verily thy father-in-law.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Lacuna*.

Last paragraph:—

1\. And as regards the frequent intercourse which with thy father  
2. I had Teie thy mother knows the facts;  
3. no one else knows the facts;  
4. but after Teie thy mother thou knowest them, and  
5. what he said to thee. As thy father with me  
6. was friendly, so now, O my brother again  
7. with me thou art friendly, and what (is) contrary thereto no one,  
8. O my brother, listens to.
