### Footnotes

<span id="fn_273"></span>[67:3](rp20315.htm#fr_273.md) Winckler and Abel:
*Mittheilungen*, ii. p. 38.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[67:4](rp20315.htm#fr_274.md) The Hebrew *khay*,
"living"; compare the name of Hiel, 1 Kings xvi. 34.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[67:5](rp20315.htm#fr_275.md) Aziru or Aziri (Ezir
in the Old Testament was the son of Dûdu (the Biblical Dodo or David), a
high official at the court of the Pharaoh. See Letter v.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[68:1](rp20315.htm#fr_276.md) This seems to be the
name of the Hittite king.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[68:2](rp20315.htm#fr_278.md) Plural.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[68:3](rp20315.htm#fr_279.md) *Khatte*.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[68:4](rp20315.htm#fr_280.md) Nukhasse was in
northern Syria; Dunip appears to have been one of its cities. M. Halévy
suggests that Nukhasse is the land of "bronze" (Heb. *nekhosheth*), and
compares 2 Sam. viii. 8.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[68:5](rp20315.htm#fr_281.md) The Tunip of the
Egyptian monuments, now Tennib, between Azaz and Arpad (Erfad),
north-west of Aleppo. In the Assyrian period, from the ninth century
B.C. downwards, Tunip disappears from history, its place being taken by
Khazazu (Azaz) and Arpad.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[68:6](rp20315.htm#fr_282.md) *Adi patari-se*.
Compare another letter of Aziru (No. 32): "The king of the Hittites is
staying in the land of Nukhasse and I am afraid of him. He is staying in
a place \[only two\] *parasangs distant* (?), \[in\] the city of Tunip
and I am afraid. The place he has quitted (*iptur*) also I <span
id="page_69">p. 69</span> have reached. \[So\] again . we have gone into
the land of Phœnicia, the country of my lord, and I am afraid for the
country of my lord." So also in another despatch (No. 33): "And again
\[the king of the Hittites\] is staying in the land of Nukhasse; \[he is
staying\] two *parasangs distant* (?) in the city of Tunip, and I am
afraid it may fall … may \[the king of the Hittites\] quit (*liptur*)
the city of Tunip."
