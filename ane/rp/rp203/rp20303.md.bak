*N.B.*—Those Assyriologists who transcribe ‏ש‎ by *sh* use *s* for ‏ס‎.
The Assyrian *e* represents a diphthong as well as ‏ע‎.

In the Introductions and Notes W. A. I. denotes *The Cuneiform
Inscriptions of Western Asia*, in five volumes, published by the
Trustees of the British Museum. Doubtful words and expressions are
followed by a note of interrogation, the preceding words being put into
italics where necessary. *Lacunæ* are denoted by asterisks or by the
insertion of supplied words between square brackets. Words needed to
complete the sense in English, but not expressed in the original, are
placed between round brackets. The names of individuals are
distinguished from those of deities or localities by being printed in
Roman type, the names of deities and localities being in capitals.
