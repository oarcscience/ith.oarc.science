### THE BABYLONIAN STORY OF THE CREATION ACCORDING TO THE TRADITION OF CUTHA

#### TRANSLATED BY THE EDITOR

<span class="smallcaps">Besides</span> the story of the Creation in a
series of successive acts, Mr. George Smith brought to light the
fragments of two tablets containing another legend of the Creation which
varied very considerably from it. The tablets belonged to the library of
Assur-bani-pal at Nineveh, but the colophon informs us that they had
been copied from older documents which came from the library of Cutha,
now Tel Ibrahim, in Babylonia. The text has never been published, but a
translation was given of it by Mr. Smith in his *Chaldean Genesis*, and
a revised version by myself in the *Records of the Past*, vol. xi. As
much progress has been made in cuneiform studies during the ten years
which have elapsed since the latter was published, I now give another
translation of the inscription, embodying the improvements which our
increased knowledge of the Assyrian language has enabled me to make.

The Cuthæan legend, it will be observed, knows

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

nothing of a creation in successive acts. Chaos is a period when as yet
writing was unknown. But the earth already existed, and was inhabited by
the chaotic brood of Tiamat, imperfect first attempts, as it were, of
nature, who lived in a city underground. They were destroyed, not by
Merodach, the god of Babylon, but by Nergal, the patron-deity of Cutha,
who is identified with Nerra, the god of pestilence, and Ner, the
mythical monarch of Babylonia who reigned before the Deluge. The words
of the poem are put into the mouth of Nergal, and the poem itself was
written for his great temple at Cutha.

The legend of Cutha agrees better with that reported by Bêrôssos than
does the legend of the Epic. In both alike we have a first creation of
living beings, and these beings are of a composite nature, the offspring
of Tiamat or Chaos. In both alike the whole brood is exterminated by the
gods of light.

The date to which the legend in its present form may be assigned is
difficult to determine. The inscription is written in Semitic only, like
the other creation-tablets, and consequently cannot belong to the
pre-Semitic age. It belongs, moreover, to an epoch when the unification
of the deities of Babylonia had already taken place, and the circle of
the great gods was complete. Ea, Istar, Zamama, Anunit, even Nebo and
Samas, are all referred to in it. Possibly it may be dated in the age of
Khammuragas (cir. B.C. 2350).

<span id="fn_292"></span>[150:1](rp20137.htm#fr_294) "The voice" or
"thunder strikes." The Accadian proper names found in the legend
indicate that although in its present form it is of Semitic origin it
must be based on older pre-Semitic materials. Moreover, the expression
"his name" is written in Accadian (*mu-ni*) which shows that it has been
quoted from an Accadian text.
