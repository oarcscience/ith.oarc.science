### THE DYNASTIC TABLETS AND CHRONICLES OF THE BABYLONIANS

##### BY THE EDITOR

<span class="smallcaps">Chronology</span> is the skeleton of history,
and until we can find the correct chronological place for a historical
monument it loses a large part of its value. Thanks to the lists of the
so-called eponyms, by means of whom the Assyrians dated their years, the
chronology of the Assyrian kings has long since been placed upon a
satisfactory footing as far back as the tenth century before our era.
The dates, moreover, assigned by Sennacherib to Tiglath-Pileser I. (B.C.
1106), and Tukulti-Uras, the son of Shalmaneser I. (B.C. 1290), as well
as the lengthy genealogies with which these kings are connected, enable
us to extend Assyrian chronology back for another five hundred years,
though, of course, with only approximate accuracy.

While our knowledge of Assyrian chronology, however, has thus been
tolerably fixed for a long time past, we have had to depend upon the
vague and contradictory statements of Greek writers for

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

our knowledge of the chronology of the older kingdom of Babylonia. Apart
from the invaluable table of kings known as Ptolemy's Canon, which
belongs to the later period of Babylonian history, and the
unsatisfactory list of dynasties excerpted from an epitomist of
Bêrôssos, our only monumental authorities for Babylonian chronology were
the Assyrian inscriptions themselves, together with a few fragments of a
dynastic tablet brought to light by Mr. George Smith and the so-called
Synchronous History of Assyria and Babylonia, of which I published a
translation in the former series of *Records of the Past* (vol. iii.)
This "Synchronous History" was composed by an Assyrian scribe, and
consists of brief notices of the occasions on which the kings of the two
countries had entered into relation, hostile or otherwise, with one
another. Since my translation was published in 1874, another large
fragment of the tablet has been discovered, and accordingly I purpose
giving a new translation of the whole document in a future volume of the
present series. The "Synchronous History" gives no dates, and
consequently its chronological value depends upon our knowledge of the
respective dates to which the Assyrian monarchs mentioned in it belong.

Within the last few years a number of discoveries due to Mr. Pinches has
entirely changed our position in regard to the chronology of the
Babylonian kings. As I have already stated, Mr. Smith found among the
tablets brought from the royal library of Nineveh

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

a small fragment which, as he perceived, contained the names and regnal
years of the kings of Babylonia, arranged in dynasties. The work to
which it belonged must accordingly have been similar to that from which
Berossos derived his dynastic list of Chaldean monarchs. Mr. Smith
published the fragment, with a translation and commentary, in the
*Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archæology*, iii. 2 (1874). It
is written on both sides, and the tablet once consisted of six columns,
each containing about seventy lines. I will call it the "Third Dynastic
Tablet."

The next discovery was made by Mr. Pinches six years later among the
inscriptions brought from the site of Babylon by the overseer of Mr.
Hormuzd Rassam. He found among them a small tablet of unbaked clay,
quite complete and inscribed on both sides. It contains the names of the
kings belonging to two early dynasties, the number of years reigned by
each king being added to the names in the case of the first dynasty. The
tablet seems to be a sort of schoolboy's exercise, having been copied
from some larger work in order to be committed to memory. The Reverse
has been published by Mr. Pinches in the *Proceedings of the Society of
Biblical Archaeology*, 7th December 1880, and I will call it the "First
Dynastic Tablet."

Another and more important document—the "Second Dynastic Tablet"—was
published by Mr. Pinches, with a translation and explanation, in the

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Proceedings of
the Society of Biblical Archæology*, 6th May 1884. This is also a tablet
of unbaked clay from Babylonia, and it contains a list of the Babylonian
sovereigns, arranged in dynasties, from the first dynasty which made the
city of Babylon the capital down to the period of the Persian conquest.
The number of regnal years is added to the name of each king and the
length of time each dynasty lasted is duly recorded. The names of some
of the kings are written in an abbreviated form: this is especially the
case with those belonging to the second dynasty.

The list, it will be observed, is confined to the dynasties which
reigned in Babylon itself. No notice is taken of the kings and dynasties
who ruled in "Accad and Sumer" before Babylon became the capital of the
empire. The lost columns of the "Third Dynastic Tablet" show how
numerous they were, and the fact is borne out by the bricks and other
monuments of early Chaldean monarchs whose names do not occur among the
successors of ’Sumu-abi. Most of the kings, indeed, whose names are
known to us in connection with the temples they built or restored
belonged to older dynasties than those which had their seat in the city
of Babylon.

A considerable number of their names is to be found in another tablet
brought by Mr. Rassam from Assyria, and published by Mr. Pinches in the
*Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archæology*, 11th January 1881.
A small portion of it had already been published in W.A.I., ii. 65, and
had given rise

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

to a good many false conclusions. The object of this tablet was
philological and not chronological; in fact the writer expressly states
that the names of the kings were "not written according to their
chronological order." He merely wished to furnish the Semitic or
Assyro-Babylonian translations of the Accado-Sumerian and Kassite names
borne by so many of the early princes, and in some cases of the mode in
which the names of Semitic kings were pronounced or written by their
Accadian subjects.

Among the latter is the name of Sargon of Accad, the ancient hero of the
Semitic population of Chaldæa, who founded the first Semitic empire in
the country and established a great library in his capital city of Agade
or Accad near Sippara. The seal of his librarian, Ibni-sarru, of very
beautiful workmanship, is now in Paris, and has been published by M. de
Clercq (*Collection de Clercq*, pl. 5, No. 46), while a copy of his
annals, together with those of his son Naram-Sin, is to be found in
W.A.I., iv. 34. His date has been fixed by a passage in a cylinder of
Nabonidos discovered in the ruins of the temple of the Sun-god at
Sippara, and published in W.A.I., v. 64. The antiquarian zeal of
Nabonidos led him to excavate among the foundations of the temple in the
hope of finding the cylinder of Naram-Sin, who was known to have been
the founder of it, and he tells us (col. ii. 56 *seq*.):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I sought for its old foundation-stone, and eighteen
cubits deep <span id="page_6">p. 6</span>*  
*I dug into the ground, and the foundation-stone of Naram-Sin, the son
of Sargon,*  
*which for 3200 years no king who had gone before me had seen,*  
*the Sun-god, the great lord of E-Babara, the temple of the seat of the
goodness of his heart,*  
*let me see, even me."</span>

</div>

In the opinion, therefore, of Nabonidos, a king who had a passion for
investigating the past records of his country, Naram-Sin reigned 3200
years before his own time, that is to say, about B.C. 3700.

Before the rise of the Semitic kingdom of Sargon of Accad, lies that
earlier Accado-Sumerian period when Babylonia was still in the hands of
a people who spoke an agglutinative language, such as those of the
modern Turks or Finns, and had originated the cuneiform system of
writing and the primitive civilisation of the Chaldean cities. Relics of
this ancient period have been discovered by M. de Sarzec in the mounds
of Tel-loh, and the Sumerian inscriptions which they bear are now being
deciphered by French scholars, more especially by M. Amiaud. M. Amiaud
has been good enough to introduce the historical documents of Babylonia
and Assyria to the readers of the present series of *Records of the
Past*, by his translations of these oldest memorials of human life and
thought in the valley of the Euphrates. If Sargon of Accad lived about
B.C. 3800, the kings of Telloh must have flourished as far back as the
fourth millennium before our era.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

The last chronological document brought to light during the last few
years is in many respects the most important of all. This is what has
been termed "The Babylonian Chronicle" by its discoverer, Mr. Pinches,
who gave an abstract of it in the *Proceedings of the Society of
Biblical Archæology*, 6th May 1884. Since then, the text has been
published with a translation and commentary by Dr. Winckler in the
*Zeitschrift für Assyriologie*, ii. 2, 3 (1887); it has also been
translated by Dr. Oppert. The tablet (which is marked 84. 2-11, 356) was
brought from Babylonia and is inscribed on both sides with four columns
of text. It was a copy or compilation made by a Babylonian in the reign
of Darius from older records, and must have been similar to the document
from which Ptolemy's Canon of Babylonian kings was extracted. Like the
latter it starts from the era of Nabonassar, B.C. 747.

The chronicle is written from a Babylonian point of view, and must
therefore be checked by contemporaneous Assyrian inscriptions. What they
describe as Assyrian successes are sometimes passed over altogether or
represented as Babylonian victories. The Assyrian kings Tiglath-Pileser
III and Shalmaneser IV are not acknowledged under the names they had
adopted from two of the most illustrious monarchs of the first Assyrian
empire, but under their original names of Pul and Ululâ; Sargon, on the
other hand, whose name was that of

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

the favourite hero of Babylonian legend, is known by the same name in
the Chronicle as he is on the monuments of Assyria. At the same time the
Chronicle helps us in correcting the inaccuracies of the Assyrian
accounts, where, for example, Suzub represents both Nergal-yusezib and
Musezib-Merodach. In fact, it confirms the judgment, already expressed
by Assyriologists, that Sennacherib is the least trustworthy of the
royal historians of Assyria.

We are at present ignorant of the precise way in which the Babylonians
reckoned their chronology. In Assyria the years were named after certain
officers, ordinarily known as eponyms, who were changed each year, and
as most of the institutions of Assyria were derived from Babylonia it is
very probable that the system of counting time by the names of the
eponyms was also of Babylonian invention. How far we can trust the dates
assigned to the kings of the earlier dynasties is open to question. The
length of reign assigned to the kings of the dynasties of the sea and of
Bit-Bazi in the Second and Third Dynastic Tablets do not agree, while
the number of regnal years given to the several kings of the first
dynasty of Babylon not only plays on the same ciphers but is
suspiciously long. On the other hand, the contract-tablets belonging to
the time of Khammuragas imply that his reign was not a short one.

There is evidence in a later part of the dynastic lists that at least
one name has been omitted. Dr. Winckler has published (in the
*Zeitschrift für Assyriologie*, ii. 3)

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

the commencement of an inscription from Babylonia (marked 83.1-18)
belonging to a certain king of Babylon, who calls himself Kuri-galzu the
son of Kara-Urus. Dr. Winckler shows that this must be Kuri-galzu II,
and that his name ought to occur in the list between those of Kara-Urus
and Rimmon-nadin-suma. It is quite possible that other reigns have
fallen out in other parts of the lists.

The lacuna in the Second Dynastic Tablet between the beginning of the
eighth dynasty and the commencement of the reign of Nabonassar
unfortunately prevents us from determining with certainty the date
assigned by the compiler of it to ’Sumu-abi. But there are two
synchronisms between Babylonian and Assyrian history which may serve to
remedy the defect. According to Sennacherib, Merodach-nadin-akhe
defeated Tiglath-Pileser I, 418 years before his own conquest of
Babylon, that is to say, in B.C. 1106, while the "Synchronous History"
makes Assur-bilkala, the son of Tiglath-Pileser I, the contemporary of
Merodach-sapik-kullat, and Assur-dân the great-grandfather of
Tiglath-Pileser I, the contemporary of Zamama-nadin-suma, the father of
Assur-dân being contemporaneous with Rimmon-\[suma-natsir?\]. If
Merodach-nadin-akhe is the ninth king of the dynasty of Isin, the date
of Zamama-nadin-suma will be B.C. 1160, agreeing very well with the
period to which the end of the reign of Assur-dân should be assigned. In
this case Sagasalti-buryas, who flourished 800 years before Nabonidos,
will not

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

be identical with the Saga-sal\[tiyas\] of the dynastic list. The reign
of Khammuragas will have commenced B.C. 2282, the first dynasty of
Babylon establishing its power there in B.C. 2394.

We learn from the inscriptions of Khammuragas that he was the first of
his dynasty to rule over the whole of Babylonia. A rival dynasty had
previously reigned at Karrak in the south, while the Elamites had
invaded portions of the country and probably held them in subjection.
Assur-bani-pal states that the Elamite king Kudur-Nankhundi had carried
away the image of the goddess Nana from Babylonia 1635 years before his
own time, or about B.C. 2285, and contract-tablets refer to the conquest
of "the lord of Elam and King Rim-Agu" of Karrak by Khammuragas. A large
number of contract-tablets, indeed, belong not only to the reigns of
Khammuragas and his son Samsu-iluna, but also to the reign of Rim-Agu,
who seems to have been master of the greater part of Chaldæa before his
overthrow by the king of Babylon. George Smith was probably right in
identifying him with the son of the Elamite prince Kudur-Mabug, who
ruled at Larsa and claimed the imperial title of "king of Sumer and
Accad."

The rise of the empire of Khammuragas brought with it a revival of
learning and literature such as had marked the rise of the empire of
Sargon. The calendar appears to have been reformed at this period, and
the great native work on astronomy and astrology put into the shape in
which it has come

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

down to us. The reign thus formed an era somewhat similar to that of
Nabonassar, and it is therefore curious to see how closely the date I
have assigned to it corresponds with that arrived at by von Gutschmidt
from classical sources for the beginning of the Babylonian epoch. If the
Latin translation can be trusted (*Simplicius ad Arist. de Cœlo*, 503
A), the astronomical observations sent by Kallisthenes from Babylon to
Aristotle in B.C. 331 reached back for 1903 years (*i.e.* to B.C. 2234).
Bêrôssos the Chaldean historian, according to Pliny (N.H. vii. 57),
stated that these observations commenced at Babylon 490 years before the
Greek era of Phoroneus, and consequently in B.C. 2243. According to
Stephanos of Byzantium, Babylon was built 1002 years before the date
(given by Hellanikos) for the siege of Troy (B.C. 1229), which would
bring us to B.C. 2231, while Ktesias, according to George Syncellus,
made the reign of Belos or Bel-Merodach last for fifty-five years from
B.C. 2286 to 2231. The fifty-five years of Belos agree with the
fifty-five of Khammuragas.

I add here the Canon of Babylonian kings given by Ptolemy in the
Almagest.
