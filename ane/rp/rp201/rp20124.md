1\. had seized the cities of <span class="smallcaps">Subarti</span>
which looked to  
2. the face <span id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_204) of <span
class="smallcaps">Asur</span> my lord,  
3. heard of my march against the land of <span
class="smallcaps">Subarti</span>;  
4. the glory of my valour overwhelmed them;  
5. they avoided battle; my feet  
6. they took.  
7. Together with their property and 120  
8. chariots (and the horses) harnessed to their yokes  
9. I took them; as the men  
10. of my own country I counted them.

11\. In the fierceness of my valour for the second time  
12. to the country of <span class="smallcaps">Kummukh</span> I marched.
All  
13. their cities I captured. Their spoil  
14. their goods and their property I carried away.  
15. Their cities with fire I burned,  
16. I threw down (and) dug up, and the relics  
17. of their armies, who before my powerful weapons  
18. were terror-stricken and the onset of my mighty battle  
19. avoided, to save  
20. their lives sought the mighty summits  
21. of the mountains, an inaccessible region.  
22. To the fastnesses of the lofty ranges  
23. and the ravines of the inaccessible mountains  
24. which were unsuited for the tread of men  
25. I ascended after them. Trial of weapons, combat  
26. and battle they essayed with me.  
27. A destruction of them I made. The bodies  
28. of their warriors in the ravines of the mountains  
29. like the inundator (<span class="smallcaps">Rimmon</span>) I
overthrew. Their corpses  
30. over the valleys and high places of the mountains  
31. I spread. Their spoil, their goods  
32. and their property from the mighty

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

33\. summits of the mountains I brought down.  
34. The land of <span class="smallcaps">Kummukh</span> to its whole
extent I subjugated, and  
35. added to the territory of my country.

36\. Tiglath-pileser the powerful king,  
37. the mighty overwhelmer of the disobedient, he who sweeps away  
38. the opposition of the wicked.

39\. In the supreme power of <span class="smallcaps">Asur</span> my
lord  
40. against the land of <span class="smallcaps">Kharia</span> <span
id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_205) and the widespread armies  
41. of the land of <span class="smallcaps">Qurkhi</span>,—lofty
mountain-ranges  
42. whose site no king at all  
43. had sought out—<span class="smallcaps">Asur</span> the lord
commanded (me)  
44. to march. My chariots and armies  
45. I assembled. The neighbourhood <span id="fr_207"></span>[2](#fn_206)
of the mountains of <span class="smallcaps">Idni</span>  
46. and <span class="smallcaps">Aya</span>, an inaccessible district, I
reached,  
47. lofty mountains, which like the point of a sword  
48. were formed, which for the passage of my chariots  
49. were unsuited. The chariots in idleness  
50. I left there. The precipitous mountains  
51. I crossed. All the land of <span class="smallcaps">Qurkhi</span>  
52. had collected its widespread armies, and  
53. to make trial of arms, combat and battle  
54. in the mountain of <span class="smallcaps">Azutabgis</span> <span
id="fr_208"></span>[3](#fn_207) was stationed, and  
55. in the mountain, an inaccessible spot, with them  
56. I fought, a destruction of them I made.

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

57\. The bodies of their warriors on the high places of the mountains  
58. into heaps I heaped.  
59. The corpses of their warriors over the valleys and high places  
60. of the mountains I spread. Against the cities  
61. which were situated in the ravines of the mountains fiercely  
62. I pierced (my way). <span id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_208)
Twenty-five cities of the land of <span
class="smallcaps">Kharia</span>  
63. which lie at the foot of the mountains of <span
class="smallcaps">Aya</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Suira</span>,
<span class="smallcaps">Idni</span>,  
64. <span class="smallcaps">Sizu</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Selgu</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Arzanibiu</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Uru’su</span>, and <span
class="smallcaps">Anitku</span>,  
65. I captured. Their spoil,  
66. their goods and their property I carried off.  
67. Their cities with fire I burned,  
68. I threw down (and) dug up.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

69\. The country of <span class="smallcaps">Adaus</span> feared the
onset of my mighty battle,  
70. and their dwelling-place (the inhabitants) abandoned.  
71. To the ravines of the lofty mountains  
72. like birds they fled. The glory of <span
class="smallcaps">Assur</span> my lord  
73. overwhelmed them, and  
74. they descended and took my feet.  
75. Tribute and offering I imposed upon them.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

76\. The lands of <span class="smallcaps">’Saraus</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Ammaus</span>  
77. which from days immemorial had not known  
78. subjection, like the flood of the deluge  
79. I overwhelmed. With their armies  
80. on the mountain of <span class="smallcaps">Aruma</span> <span
id="fr_210"></span>[2](#fn_209) I fought, and  
81. a destruction of them I made. The bodies  
82. of their fighting-men like sling-stones (?)

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

83\. I flung to the ground. Their cities I captured.  
84. Their gods I removed. Their spoil,  
85. their goods (and) their property I carried away.  
86. Their cities with fire I burned,  
87. I threw down (and) dug up; to mounds and ruins  
88. I reduced. The heavy yoke of my lordship  
89. I laid upon them. The face of <span class="smallcaps">Assur</span>
my lord  
90. I made them behold. <span id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_210)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

91\. The powerful countries of <span
class="smallcaps">I’sua</span> <span id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_211) and
<span class="smallcaps">Daria</span>  
92. which were disobedient I conquered. Tribute  
93. and offering I imposed upon them.  
94. The face of <span class="smallcaps">Assur</span> my lord I caused
them to behold.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

95\. In my supremacy when my enemies  
96. I had conquered, my chariots and armies  
97. I took. The lower Zab <span id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_212)  
98. I crossed. The countries of <span class="smallcaps">Murattas</span>
and <span class="smallcaps">Saradaus</span>  
99. which are in the midst of the mountains of <span
class="smallcaps">A’saniu</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Adhuma</span>  
100. an inaccessible region, I conquered.  
101. Their armies like lambs  
102. I cut down. The city of <span class="smallcaps">Murattas</span>,  
103. their stronghold, in the third part of a day  
104. from sunrise I captured.  
105. Their gods, their goods, (and) their property,  
106. 60 plates of bronze,

<span id="fn_204"></span>[100:1](rp20124.htm#fr_205) That is, were
subject to.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[101:1](rp20124.htm#fr_206) It is clear that
Kharia was a district of Qurkhi which lay eastward of Diarbekir and the
Supnat or Sebeneh Su, in the direction of Bitlis. It is perhaps the Arua
of Assur-natsir-pal which adjoined the western frontier of Ararat, a
kingdom at that time confined to Lake Van and the district south of the
Lake. The name reminds us of the classical Korra, now Karia, a little to
the south-east of Kolkhis (on Lake Goldshik), and to the north-west of
Diarbekir.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[101:2](rp20124.htm#fr_207) *Birti*, from
*baru* "to see."

<span id="fn_207"></span>[101:3](rp20124.htm#fr_208) Perhaps to be read
Azues.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[102:1](rp20124.htm#fr_209) *Aznig*, not
*a’snig*.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[102:2](rp20124.htm#fr_210) As, according to
ii. 78, Aruma lay on the frontier of Mildis, Adaus, ’Saraus, and Ammaus
must have been Kurdish districts to the eastward of Kummukh. The country
of Adaus is mentioned by Assur-natsir-pal in connection with Kirruri,
which lay between Nimme and Qurkhi.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[103:1](rp20124.htm#fr_211) That is, "I reduced
them to subjection to Assur."

<span id="fn_211"></span>[103:2](rp20124.htm#fr_212) I’sua, according to
Shalmaneser II, adjoined Enzite or Anzitênê (on the Sebbeneh Su) and lay
on the southern bank of the Arsanias between Palu and Mush. It is
probably the U’su of Assur-natsir-pal, on the western frontier of Arua
(see note on iii. 40).

<span id="fn_212"></span>[103:3](rp20124.htm#fr_213) The lower Zab falls
into the Tigris a little below Kalah Sherghat (Assur). It rises in the
Kurdish mountains, flowing past Arbela, and was called Kapros by the
classical geographers in contradistinction to the Lykos or Upper Zab.
