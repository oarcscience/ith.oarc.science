### Footnotes

<span id="fn_95"></span>[37:1](rp20111.htm#fr_95) W.A.I., iv. 34. The
text has been translated in part by Mr. George Smith. The astrological
notices with which the account of Sargon's campaigns is associated are
explained by the fact that the great Chaldean work on astronomy and
astrology was compiled for his library at Accad, and that one of the
objects of this work was to trace a connection between certain
astronomical occurrences and the events which immediately followed them.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[37:2](rp20111.htm#fr_96) *Ana pikhirti-su
tsirip zakiki*.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[37:3](rp20111.htm#fr_97) The moon lay on its
back, and the distance from the extremity of one horn to that of another
was as much as a span.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[38:1](rp20111.htm#fr_98) The Sun-god must be
referred to.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[38:2](rp20111.htm#fr_99) The Mediterranean.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[39:1](rp20111.htm#fr_100) We infer from this
that Sargon had crossed over into Cyprus, and there erected an image of
himself. This might explain why his later namesake Sargon sent to the
island a monument, which is now in Berlin. General di Cesnola brought
back from Cyprus a Babylonian cylinder of hæmatite bearing the
inscription, "Abil-Istar, the son of Ilu-Balidh, the servant of the
deified Naram-Sin." The cylinder was probably executed either during the
reign of Naram-Sin, or shortly afterwards, as the cult of the king is
not likely to have continued after the fall of his dynasty.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[39:2](rp20111.htm#fr_103) It could not be
measured.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[39:3](rp20111.htm#fr_102) "Thus he has
appointed."

<span id="fn_103"></span>[39:4](rp20111.htm#fr_104) What this refers to
it is impossible to say. The expression can hardly be metaphorical.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[40:1](rp20111.htm#fr_105) It could not be
measured.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[40:2](rp20111.htm#fr_106) The Seven Evil
Spirits who were supposed to cause eclipses of the moon.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[40:3](rp20111.htm#fr_107) "The plain of the
’Suti," or nomad tribes on the eastern side of Babylonia.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[41:1](rp20111.htm#fr_108) The Sinaitic
Peninsula.
