### THE ASSYRIAN EPIC OF THE CREATION

#### FIRST TABLET OF THE STORY OF THE CREATION

<span class="smallcaps">Obverse</span>

1\. At that time the heaven above had not yet announced,  
2. or the earth beneath recorded, a name;  
3. the unopened <span id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_258.md) deep was their
generator,  
4. <span class="smallcaps">Mummu-Tiamat</span> (the chaos of the sea)
was the mother of them all.  
5. Their waters were embosomed as one, <span
id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_259.md) and  
6. the corn-field <span id="fr_261"></span>[3](#fn_260.md) was unharvested,
the pasture was un-grown.  
7. At that time the gods had not appeared, any of them;  
8. by no name were they recorded, no destiny (had they fixed).  
9. Then the (great) gods were created,  
10. <span class="smallcaps">Lakhmu</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Lakhamu</span> issued forth (the first),  
11. until they grew up (when)  
12. <span class="smallcaps">An-sar</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Ki-sar</span> were created.  
13. Long were the days, extended (was the time, until)  
14. the gods <span class="smallcaps">Anu</span>, (<span
class="smallcaps">Bel</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Ea</span> were
born),  
15. <span class="smallcaps">An-sar</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Ki-sar</span> (gave them birth).

*The rest of the tablet is lost*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_258"></span>[133:1](rp20131.htm#fr_259.md) Or " first-born,"
if we adopt Delitzsch's reading *ristu* instead of *la patû*.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[133:2](rp20131.htm#fr_260.md) This is shown to be
the signification of *istenis* by S 1140, 8.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[133:3](rp20131.htm#fr_261.md) *Gipara;* see
W.A.I., V. i. 48-50. *Nirba kân yusakhnapu giparu ’sippâti summukha
inbu*, "the corn-god continuously caused the cornfield to grow, the
papyri were gladdened with fruit;" S 799, 2. *Ana gipâri eltu erubbi*
(Accadian *mi-para-ki azagga imma-dan-tutu*), "to the holy cornfield he
went down." The word has nothing to do with "clouds" or "darkness."
