# THE ARCHAIC CLASSICS.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Assyrian Grammar**. An Elementary Grammar and Reading-Book of the
Assyrian Language, in the Cuneiform Character: containing the most
complete Syllabary yet extant, and which will serve also as a Vocabulary
of both Accadian and Assyrian. Second Edition, Revised and Corrected. By
the Rev. <span class="smallcaps">A. H. Sayce</span>, M.A., Deputy
Professor of Comparative Philology, Oxford. 4to. Cloth, 7s. 6d.

"Mr. Sayce's new Assyrian Grammar will be of great value."—*Athenæum*.

"We doubt not that this book will be gladly welcomed on all
sides."—*Academy*.

**Assyrian Texts**. Being Extracts from the Annals of Shalmaneser II.,
Sennacherib, and Assur-bani-pal. With Philological Notes by <span
class="smallcaps">Ernest A. Budge</span>, M.R.A.S., Assyrian
Exhibitioner, Christ College, Cambridge. 4to. Cloth extra, 7s. 6d.

<span class="small">"Mr. Budge's book forms part of the useful series
known as the 'Archaic Classics,' and consists of a reading-book intended
for those who have already mastered the elements of Assyrian grammar. …
The texts have been selected and edited with great care, variant
readings being noted at the bottom of the page, and the explanatory
notes at the end reflect much credit upon the author. They will be found
very helpful by the beginner. Type and paper leave nothing to be
desired. We hope that this and the other volumes of the same series will
attract an increasing number of scholars to the study of Assyrian. Its
close relationship to Hebrew cannot but clear up many obscure points in
Hebrew philology, since words which occur but once or twice in the Old
Testament are not unfrequently of common occurrence in the Assyrian
texts. … In fact, it is no longer possible to deal with questions of
Semitic philology without some knowledge at least of Assyrian. … But
what has already been achieved in the field of Assyrian decipherment is
but an earnest of what may yet be achieved in it. The harvest is
abundant; the labourers alone are wanted. Let us hope that Mr. Budge's
book will be, amongst others, the means of gathering them in."—*The
Guardian*, August 8, 1880.</span>

This work is not a new biography of Abraham, but gives an account of the
civilised world in which he lived, front Elam on the East to Egypt on
the West, drawn from the existing results of Egyptological and
Assyriological research, and elucidates the true position and character
of the Patriarch. The illustrations are chosen from an ethnographic
point of view, as specimens of the leading races of the early world.

"Mr. Tomkins has produced a very vivid and truthful picture of the
surroundings of Abraham. The margin with its notes is a joy to behold.
It will be some time before such a book can be superseded."—*Academy*.

"The book is a monument of laborious and patient investigation, and its
utility is increased by drawings which greatly assist a comprehension of
the text."—*Daily Telegraph*.

"We must not omit to give an appreciative word to the great number of
illustrations from photographs and from the author's own drawings. They
add much to the value of a highly interesting and indeed important
book."—*Literary Churchman*.

**Oriental Records: Monumental and Historical**. Confirmatory of the Old
Testament Scriptures. A Collection of the most important recent
discoveries, especially in Western Asia and Egypt, derived from the
highest attainable antiquity; confirmatory and illustrative of the

class="smallcaps">Spence</span>, M.A. Demy 8vo. Cloth, 560 pp., 10s.

<span class="small">"The texts of Genesis scattered throughout the
twelve volumes of the Talmud have been carefully searched out and
arranged in the order in which we find them in our Bibles. To each
individual text is added the immediate context as found in the Talmud.
After many of the texts and the direct Talmudical comments upon them,
so-called Synoptical Notes are introduced. These refer to the principal
subjects suggested in the text just commented upon, and any curious and
interesting remark on these subjects contained in the Mishna and Gemara
is appended. Careful references to the particular treatise, page and
column are in all cases given."—*Introductory Essay*.</span>
