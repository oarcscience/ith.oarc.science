<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">This</span> short inscription of twenty-seven lines is one of peculiar interest. It is a record, written in the Akkadian language, of an endowment, made by an early Mesopotamian king with a Semitic Babylonian name, to the great temple at Erech called &Ecirc;-ana;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and it is not an original, but a copy in clay, written by a man named Nab&ucirc;-baladhsu-igb&icirc;, of a stone tablet kept, in ancient times, in the great temple known as &Ecirc;-zida, now the ruin called the Birs-i-Nimroud&#8212;the supposed tower of Babel. Great care has been taken by the copyist in inscribing the tablet; and the forms of the characters, as he has given them, probably reproduce fairly well the archaic style of the original. The text itself covers the greater part of the two sides of the clay tablet, which is, like most of the documents of this kind found in Babylonia and Assyria, flat&#8212;or nearly so&#8212;on the obverse, and curved on the reverse. The last three lines, which</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></A></p>  
<p>are separate from the others, are written smaller, and are in the later Babylonian style of writing. Unlike the rest, also, they are written in the Semitic-Babylonian language. The size of the tablet is 4&frac14; inches by 2&#8540; inches, the thickness in the thickest part being 1&#8539; inch. The colour is a very light yellow ochre.</p>  
<p>As the word-order in Akkadian differs considerably from English, no attempt is made to preserve the divisions of the lines of the original; by this arrangement translations from these ancient tongues are much more easily understood.</p>

<p>Gabri narua sha &ucirc;sh&icirc;, nigga &Ecirc;-zida, Nab&ucirc;-baladhsu-igb&icirc;, &acirc;bil Mitsir&acirc;a, isdhur.</p>  
<p>The text begins with an invocation to Lugalbanda and his consort Nin-gul, who seem to have been Sin-gashid's patron god and goddess. He then speaks of &Ecirc;-ana, one of the great temples of Erech (which was, perhaps, Sin-gashid's capital), and &Ecirc;-kankal, probably one of the shrines in &Ecirc;-ana. Judging from the wording, Sin-gashid seems to claim to be the founder of both those fanes, though it is probable that he only rebuilt them. Sin-gashid then gives a list of the amounts of produce, etc., with which he had endowed the shrine, and ends with a pious wish for his country. The date of the original of this inscription may be set down at about 2600 B.C. The copy which has come down to us, however, probably dates from the time of the antiquarian revival in Babylonia during the reign of Nabonidus, father of Belshazzar.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></A></p>  
<p>It is to be noted that the inscription is dedicated to a god and a goddess whose names I provisionally transcribe as <i>Lugal-banda</i> ("powerful king," or "king of youthful strength") and <i>Nin-gul</i> his consort (as we learn from the second volume of the <i>Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia</i>, pl. 59, ll. 24 and 25&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>). This identification of Ningul as the consort of Lugal-banda is important, as it shows that Sin-gashid, who calls her his mother, and himself her son,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> did not mean to imply that she was his real earthly parent, but that he simply traced his descent from her, thus asserting his divine origin. The late George Smith's double-queried "Belat-sunat" (as he transcribed the name Nin-gul), "the earliest known queen in the Euphrates valley," must therefore be erased from the list of historical rulers in Erech.</p>  
<p>The temple &Ecirc;-ana was probably the principal fane in the city of Erech, and &Ecirc;-kankal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> was probably one of the shrines within it. It is not improbable that the &Ecirc;-kankal mentioned here is the same as, or the fellow-shrine to, the &Ecirc;-ghili-ana mentioned by Assur-bani-pal as the sanctuary, apparently in or connected with &Ecirc;-ana, to which he restored the image of the goddess Nan&acirc;, which was carried off by the king of Elam, Kudur-nankhundi, about 2280</p>

<p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></A></p>  
<p>years before Christ. As the date of Sin-gashid is doubtful,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> it is impossible to say with certainty whether the capture of the image of Nan&acirc; by the Elamites took place before or after his reign, but it was probably after.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The inscription here translated and explained is a duplicate of one published in the fourth volume of the <i>Cuneiform Ins. of W. Asia</i>, pl. 35, No. 3, from two cones from Warka.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Of this text, which is rather roughly written, and which gives a few interesting variants from the text translated above, a tentative translation was given by the late George Smith in his "Early History of Babylonia," published in the <i>Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arch&aelig;ology</i>, vol. i., and in the first series of the Records of the Past, vol. iii.</p>
