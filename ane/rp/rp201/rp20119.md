### SIN-GASHID'S ENDOWMENT OF THE TEMPLE Ê-ANA

#### <span class="smallcaps">Translated by Theo. G. Pinches</span>

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> short inscription of twenty-seven
lines is one of peculiar interest. It is a record, written in the
Akkadian language, of an endowment, made by an early Mesopotamian king
with a Semitic Babylonian name, to the great temple at Erech called
Ê-ana; <span id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_163.md) and it is not an original,
but a copy in clay, written by a man named Nabû-baladhsu-igbî, of a
stone tablet kept, in ancient times, in the great temple known as
Ê-zida, now the ruin called the Birs-i-Nimroud—the supposed tower of
Babel. Great care has been taken by the copyist in inscribing the
tablet; and the forms of the characters, as he has given them, probably
reproduce fairly well the archaic style of the original. The text itself
covers the greater part of the two sides of the clay tablet, which is,
like most of the documents of this kind found in Babylonia and Assyria,
flat—or nearly so—on the obverse, and curved on the reverse. The last
three lines, which

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

are separate from the others, are written smaller, and are in the later
Babylonian style of writing. Unlike the rest, also, they are written in
the Semitic-Babylonian language. The size of the tablet is 4¼ inches by
2⅜ inches, the thickness in the thickest part being 1⅛ inch. The colour
is a very light yellow ochre.

As the word-order in Akkadian differs considerably from English, no
attempt is made to preserve the divisions of the lines of the original;
by this arrangement translations from these ancient tongues are much
more easily understood.

### TRANSLATION OF THE INSCRIPTION OF SIN-GASHID

Sin-gashid, <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_164.md) king of <span
class="smallcaps">Erech</span>, <span id="fr_166"></span>[2](#fn_165.md)
king of <span class="smallcaps">Amnanum</span>, and patron <span
id="fr_167"></span>[3](#fn_166.md) of <span class="smallcaps">Ê-ana</span>,
to <span class="smallcaps">Lugal-banda</span> his god and <span
class="smallcaps">Nin-gul</span> his goddess. When he built <span
class="smallcaps">Ê-ana</span> he erected <span
class="smallcaps">Ê-kankal</span>, the house which is the seat of the
joy of his heart. <span id="fr_168"></span>[4](#fn_167.md) During his
dominion he will endow it with <span id="fr_169"></span>[5](#fn_168.md) 30
*gur* of wheat, 12 *mana* of wool, 10 *mana* of produce, 18 *qa* of oil
according to <span id="fr_170"></span>[6](#fn_169.md) the tariff, and 1
shekel of gold. May his years be years of plenty.

COLOPHON IN SEMITIC-BABYLONIAN:

Copy of the tablet of *ûsû*-stone, the property <span

which Nabû-baladhsu-igbî, son of Mitsirâa, <span
id="fr_172"></span>[8](#fn_171.md) has written.

It may not be without interest to give here a transcription of the
original text into Roman characters,

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

omitting the determinative prefixes, which were probably not
pronounced:—

Lugal-banda, dingiranir, Nin-gul amānir, Sin gashid, lugal Unuga, lugal
Amnanum, ua Ê-ana. Ud Ê-ana mu-dua, Ê-kankal, ê ki-tur shaghulakanē,
munen-du. Bala nam-lugalakani ba she-gur-ta, ghu-min mana sig-ta, ghu
mana urn-ta (ghu-ussa-qa <span id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_172).md)
salgish-ta, kilama dana-ka, guskin gi gê ghipdazig. Mua-ni mu ghigala
ghia.

Gabri narua sha ûshî, nigga Ê-zida, Nabû-baladhsu-igbî, âbil Mitsirâa,
isdhur.

The text begins with an invocation to Lugalbanda and his consort
Nin-gul, who seem to have been Sin-gashid's patron god and goddess. He
then speaks of Ê-ana, one of the great temples of Erech (which was,
perhaps, Sin-gashid's capital), and Ê-kankal, probably one of the
shrines in Ê-ana. Judging from the wording, Sin-gashid seems to claim to
be the founder of both those fanes, though it is probable that he only
rebuilt them. Sin-gashid then gives a list of the amounts of produce,
etc., with which he had endowed the shrine, and ends with a pious wish
for his country. The date of the original of this inscription may be set
down at about 2600 B.C. The copy which has come down to us, however,
probably dates from the time of the antiquarian revival in Babylonia
during the reign of Nabonidus, father of Belshazzar.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

It is to be noted that the inscription is dedicated to a god and a
goddess whose names I provisionally transcribe as *Lugal-banda*
("powerful king," or "king of youthful strength") and *Nin-gul* his
consort (as we learn from the second volume of the *Cuneiform
Inscriptions of Western Asia*, pl. 59, ll. 24 and 25 <span
id="fr_174"></span>[1](#fn_173).md). This identification of Ningul as the
consort of Lugal-banda is important, as it shows that Sin-gashid, who
calls her his mother, and himself her son, <span
id="fr_175"></span>[2](#fn_174.md) did not mean to imply that she was his
real earthly parent, but that he simply traced his descent from her,
thus asserting his divine origin. The late George Smith's double-queried
"Belat-sunat" (as he transcribed the name Nin-gul), "the earliest known
queen in the Euphrates valley," must therefore be erased from the list
of historical rulers in Erech.

The temple Ê-ana was probably the principal fane in the city of Erech,
and Ê-kankal <span id="fr_176"></span>[3](#fn_175.md) was probably one of
the shrines within it. It is not improbable that the Ê-kankal mentioned
here is the same as, or the fellow-shrine to, the Ê-ghili-ana mentioned
by Assur-bani-pal as the sanctuary, apparently in or connected with
Ê-ana, to which he restored the image of the goddess Nanâ, which was
carried off by the king of Elam, Kudur-nankhundi, about 2280

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

years before Christ. As the date of Sin-gashid is doubtful, <span
id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_176.md) it is impossible to say with certainty
whether the capture of the image of Nanâ by the Elamites took place
before or after his reign, but it was probably after. <span
id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_177.md)

The inscription here translated and explained is a duplicate of one
published in the fourth volume of the *Cuneiform Ins. of W. Asia*, pl.
35, No. 3, from two cones from Warka. <span
id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_178.md) Of this text, which is rather roughly
written, and which gives a few interesting variants from the text
translated above, a tentative translation was given by the late George
Smith in his "Early History of Babylonia," published in the
*Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archæology*, vol. i., and in
the first series of the Records of the Past, vol. iii.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_163"></span>[78:1](rp20119.htm#fr_164.md) Written *Ê-an-na* in
the inscriptions. The end-syllable *-na* is, however, generally regarded
as a kind of phonetic complement, and the n is therefore not really
double. The name means "House of heaven."

<span id="fn_164"></span>[80:1](rp20119.htm#fr_165.md) This name is
probably for *Sin-kashid*, "the Moon-god has made captive."

<span id="fn_165"></span>[80:2](rp20119.htm#fr_166.md) The Akkadian form is
*Unuga*.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[80:3](rp20119.htm#fr_167.md) Literally
"nourisher" (*ua*, equivalent to the Semitic-Babylonian *zaninu*).

<span id="fn_167"></span>[80:4](rp20119.htm#fr_168.md) The Akkadians here
use the compound *sha-ghulla*, "heartjoy."

<span id="fn_168"></span>[80:5](rp20119.htm#fr_169.md) Literally, "measure
out to it."

<span id="fn_169"></span>[80:6](rp20119.htm#fr_170.md) Or, perhaps,
"according to the tariff of the time."

<span id="fn_170"></span>[80:7](rp20119.htm#fr_171.md) The original has the
Akkadian word *nigga* = Semitic-Babylonian *mimma*.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[80:8](rp20119.htm#fr_172.md) Mitsirâa, "the
Egyptian."

<span id="fn_172"></span>[81:1](rp20119.htm#fr_173.md) This is represented
on the tablet by a single character formed with four wedges (three
horizontal and one upright) of the same form as the character aš. This
character is equivalent to 3 × 6 (= 18) *qa*.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[82:1](rp20119.htm#fr_174.md) From a comparison of
the other names in the text there published, it would seem that other
possible readings of these two names are *Umun-banda* or *Ûn-banda* and
*Ûn-gul* or *Ê-gul*. Fresh excavations in the East can alone determine
these points.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[82:2](rp20119.htm#fr_175.md) *Cun. Ins. of W.
Asia*, vol. i. pl. 3, No. viii. (Brick from the summit of the Bowarieh
ruin at Warka).

<span id="fn_175"></span>[82:3](rp20119.htm#fr_176.md) "The house of the
sanctuary" (?).

<span id="fn_176"></span>[83:1](rp20119.htm#fr_177.md) He may be regarded
as having reigned about 2600 B.C.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[83:2](rp20119.htm#fr_178.md) The text of
Assur-bani-pal's description is as follows:—"For 1635 years had the
goddess Nanā been angry, had gone, and had dwelt within Elam, which was
not her proper place; and in those days she and the gods her fathers
proclaimed my name to the dominion of the world. She intrusted to me the
return of her divinity thus: 'Assur-bani-pal shall bring me out of the
midst of wicked Elam, and shall cause me to enter within Ê-ana.' The
words of the command of her divinity, which she had spoken from remote
days, she again revealed to the later people. I grasped the hand of her
great divinity, and she took the straight road, with joy of heart, to
Ê-ana. In the month Kisleu, on the first day, I caused her to enter
Erech, and in Ê-ghili-ana, which she loves, I caused an everlasting
shrine to be founded for her."

<span id="fn_178"></span>[83:3](rp20119.htm#fr_179.md) The ancient Erech,
in which the temple Ê-ana was situated.
