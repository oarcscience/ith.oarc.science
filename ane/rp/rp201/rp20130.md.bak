### THE ASSYRIAN STORY OF THE CREATION

#### <span class="smallcaps">Translated by the Editor</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Fragments</span> of a long epic poem, describing
the creation of the world in a series of tablets or books, were
discovered by Mr. George Smith among the cuneiform treasures of the
British Museum which had come from the royal library of Kouyunjik or
Nineveh. The tablets appear to be seven in number, and since the
creation was described as consisting of a series of successive acts, it
presented a curious similarity to the account of the creation recorded
in the first chapter of Genesis.

The epic embodied certain of the ideas and beliefs current in Assyria
and Babylonia regarding the creation of the universe. That there were
other ideas and legends is evident from the existence of another story
of the creation, which came originally from the library of Cutha, and
differed entirely from that of the epic. The epic, as I have pointed out
in my *Lectures on the Religion of the Ancient Babylonians* (p. 385),
clearly belongs to a late date. The gods of the popular religion not
only have their

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

places in the universe fixed, but even the period and manner of their
origin is described. The elementary spirits of the old Accadian faith
have passed into the great gods of Semitic belief, and been finally
resolved into mere symbolical representatives of the primordial elements
of the world. Under a thin disguise of theological nomenclature, the
Babylonian theory of the universe has become a philosophic materialism.
The gods themselves come and go like mortal men; they are the offspring
of the everlasting elements of the heaven and earth, and of that watery
abyss out of which mythology had created a demon of evil, but which the
philosopher knew to be the mother and source of all things. The Tiamat
of the first tablet of the epic is a very different being from the
Tiamat of the fourth.

I much doubt, therefore, whether the epic in its present form is older
than the time of Assur-bani-pal. It sums up under a poetical garb the
teachings of mythology and philosophy about the origin of things. The
Babylonians had always believed that the world had been created out of
water, and that the present creation had been preceded by an earlier
creation, an imperfect and chaotic prototype of that which followed.
This earlier creation, in fact, had been the work of chaos, and the
destruction of it by the younger gods of light and order ushered in the
new creation of the visible world. Light and darkness, chaos and order,
are ever struggling one against the other; but the victory of light and
order was

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

assured ever since Merodach, the Sun-god, overthrew the dragon Tiamat,
"the wicked serpent " as she is also called, who represented chaos and
anarchy. Tiamat is the Assyrian equivalent of the Hebrew *tehôm*, "the
deep," upon whose face, according to Gen. i. 2, darkness had rested
before the universe was made.

The cosmological system of the first tablet found its way into the pages
of a Greek writer, Damaskios, who lived in the sixth century of our era
(*De Prim. Princip.* 125, p. 384, ed. Kopp). "The Babylonians," he tells
us, "like the rest of the barbarians, pass over in silence the one
principle of the universe, and they constitute two, Tavthê and Apasôn,
making Apasôn the husband of Tavthê, and denominating her 'the mother of
the gods.' And from these proceeds an only-begotten son Mumis, which, I
conceive, is no other than the intelligible world proceeding from the
two principles. From them also another progeny is derived, Lakhê and
Lakhos; and again a third, Kissarê and Assôros, from which last three
others proceed, Anos and Illinos and Aos. And of Aos and Davkê is born a
son called Bêlos, who, they say, is the fabricator of the world."

Tavthê is Tiamat or Tiavat, Apasôn is *ap’su*, "the abyss," and Mumis is
Mummu, who, however, is identified with Tiamat in the epic, Kissarê and
Assôros being Ki-sar and An-sar, "the lower" and "the upper firmament."
Lakhê and Lakhos, that is to say, Lakhmu or Lakhvu and Lakhamu or
Lakhavu,

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

must be read instead of the Dakhê and Dakhos of the manuscripts. Belos
is Bel-Merodach, "the younger Bel," in contradistinction to "the older
Bel" of the city of Nipur, one of whose Accadian names was Illil, the
Illinos of Damaskios. It is probable that the name of Lakhamu was
carried to Canaan along with those of other Babylonian gods such as
Rimmon, Nebo, and Sin. At all events Lakhmi seems to be the name of a
Philistine in 1 Chron. xx. 5, and Beth-lehem is best explained as "the
house of Lekhem," like Beth-Dagon, "the house of Dagon," or Beth-Anoth,
"the house of Anat."

Only the commencement of the first tablet (numbered K 5419) has been
recovered, but the tablet was of no great length, as the larger part of
the reverse appears to have been occupied by the colophon. It has been
published by Mr. George Smith in the *Transactions of the Society of
Biblical Archæology*, iv. 2 (1876), and by Professor Fr. Delitzsch in
his *Assyrische Lesestücke* (1st edition, 1878), and has been translated
by Mr. Smith in his *Chaldean Genesis*. Translations of it by Dr.
Oppert, Dr. Schrader, and myself have subsequently appeared. A small
fragment of the second tablet has been found by Professor Delitzsch,
containing the colophon, "the second tablet (of the series beginning)
'when above.'" The third tablet was partly represented by the fragments
numbered K 3473, Rm. 615. Lines 17–42 of the obverse have been

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

published by Professor Delitzsch in his *Assyrisches Wörterbuch*, i. p.
100, and portions of the text are translated in Smith's *Chaldean
Genesis*. A fragment of the fourth tablet from the Library of Kouyunjik,
numbered K 3437, has been published by George Smith (*Trans. Soc. Bib.
Arch.*, iv. 2), and Delitzsch (*Ass. Leses.*, pp. 82, 83), and
translated by Smith, Oppert, Lenormant, and others; but nearly the whole
of the text has now been recovered from a tablet brought from Babylonia
by Mr. Rassam (numbered 82–9–18, 3737), and published by Mr. Budge in
the *Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archæology* for 6th December
1887. A translation of it has been given by myself in my *Lectures on
the Religion of the Ancient Babylonians*, pp. 379 *seq*. (1887), which I
can now improve in several particulars. The fifth tablet (K 3567) was
published by Smith (*Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch.*, iv. 2), and Delitzsch
(*Ass. Leses.*, p. 78), and translated by Smith, Oppert, and Lenormant.
About one-third of it is lost. Of the seventh (?) tablet only three
small fragments remain (345, 248, 147), published by Delitzsch (*Ass.
Leses.*, p. 79), and translated by Smith in his *Chaldean Genesis*. To
the third tablet probably belongs an unpublished fragment (K 3449),
describing the preparation of the bow of Merodach; an attempt at its
translation will be found in Smith's *Chaldean Genesis*.

No fragments of the sixth tablet have as yet been noticed. According to
Professor Delitzsch the fragment belonging to the second tablet
concludes with

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

the prayer of Merodach to capture Tiamat and avenge the gods, after Anu
and Ea had already declined to undertake the task (*Assyrisches
Wörterbuch*, i. p. 65). The first line of the next tablet is stated to
be, "An-sar (the upper firmament) opened his mouth." From this point
onwards the ends of the lines are preserved on the fragment numbered K
3473, and from line 9 onwards the beginnings of the lines on fragment K
3938. They run as follows:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">1. "An-sar opened his mouth, and  
2. unto him (Merodach) he speaks the word:  
3. ('O lord, I) am yearning <span id="fr_258"></span>[1](#fn_257.md) in my
liver;  
4. (against Tiamat) let me send thee, even thee:  
5. (with the snare?) thou shalt ensnare (Tiamat), thou shalt be
*exalted* (?)  
6. …… thy … to thy presence.  
7 …… their divine porter.  
8. …… let them dwell in feasting.'  
9. The god went (saying), let them make the wine.  
10. Humbly the god has … them; let them hear the report.  
11. He has established and has fixed their …, (saying) thus:  
12. 'Do thou … thy (word) repeat to them.  
13. An-sar, moreover, … has urged me on;  
14. the law of (his) heart has made me, even me, to ponder  
15. thus: 'Tiamat … has seen us;  
16. she has convened (*sitkunat*) an assembly, and is violently
enraged.'"</span>

</div>

Here follows the passage translated further on. The last two lines of
the tablet, as we learn from a

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

small fragment, concluded with the words, "(Merodach) ascended (from)
their midst (and the great gods) determined (for him his) destiny."

It will be seen that a good deal of the poem consists of the words put
into the mouth of the god Merodach, derived possibly from older lays.
The first tablet or book, however, expresses the cosmological doctrines
of the author's own day. It opens before the beginning of time, the
expression "at that time" answering to the expression "in the beginning"
of Genesis. The heavens and earth had not yet been created, and since
the name was supposed to be the same as the thing named, their names had
not as yet been pronounced. A watery chaos alone existed, Mummu Tiamat,
"the chaos of the deep." Out of the bosom of this chaos proceeded the
gods as well as the created world. First came the primæval divinities
Lakhmu and Lakhamu, words of unknown meaning, and then An-sar and
Ki-sar, "the upper" and "lower firmament." Last of all were born the
three supreme gods of the Babylonian faith, Anu the sky-god, Bel or
Illil the lord of the ghost-world, and Ea the god of the river and sea.

But before the younger gods could find a suitable habitation for
themselves and their creation it was necessary to destroy "the dragon"
of chaos with all her monstrous offspring. The task was undertaken by
the Babylonian sun-god Merodach, the son of Ea, An-sar promising him
victory, and the other gods providing for him his arms. The second
tablet was

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

occupied with an account of the preparations made to ensure the victory
of light over darkness and order over anarchy.

The third tablet described the success of the god of light over the
allies of Tiamat. Light was introduced into the world, and it only
remained to destroy Tiamat herself. The combat is described in the
fourth tablet, which takes the form of a poem in honour of Merodach, and
is probably an earlier poem incorporated into his text by the author of
the epic. Tiamat was slain and her allies put in bondage, while the
books of destiny which had hitherto been possessed by the older race of
gods were now transferred to the younger deities of the new world. The
visible heaven was formed out of the skin of Tiamat, and became the
outward symbol of An-sar and the habitation of Anu, Bel, and Ea, while
the chaotic waters of the dragon became the law-bound sea ruled over by
Ea.

The heavens having been thus made, the fifth tablet tells us how they
were furnished with mansions for the sun and moon and stars, and how the
heavenly bodies were bound down by fixed laws that they might regulate
the calendar and determine the year. The sixth tablet probably described
the creation of the earth, as well as of vegetables, birds, and fish. In
the seventh tablet the creation of animals and reptiles was narrated,
and doubtless also that of mankind.

It will be seen from this that in its main outlines

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

the Assyrian epic of the creation bears a striking resemblance to the
account of it given in the first chapter of Genesis. In each case the
history of the creation is divided into seven successive acts; in each
case the present world has been preceded by a watery chaos. In fact the
self-same word is used of this chaos in both the Biblical and Assyrian
accounts —*tehôm*, *Tiamat*—the only difference being that in the
Assyrian story "the deep" has become a mythological personage, the
mother of a chaotic brood. The order of the creation, moreover, agrees
in the two accounts; first the light, then the creation of the firmament
of heaven, subsequently the appointment of the celestial bodies "for
signs and for seasons and for days and years," and next, the creation of
beasts and "creeping things." But the two accounts also differ in some
important particulars. In the Assyrian epic the earth seems not to have
been made until after the appointment of the heavenly bodies, instead of
before it as in Genesis, and the seventh day is a day of work instead of
rest, while there is nothing corresponding to the statement of Genesis
that "the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." But the most
important difference consists in the interpolation of the struggle
between Merodach and the powers of evil, as a consequence of which light
was introduced into the universe and the firmament of the heavens was
formed.

It has long since been noted that the conception

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

of this struggle stands in curious parallelism to the verses of the
Apocalypse (Rev. xii. 7-9): "And there was war in heaven: Michael and
his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his
angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world." We are also reminded
of the words of Isaiah xxiv. 21, 22: "The Lord shall visit the host of
the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the
earth. And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in
the pit, and shall be shut up in prison." It may be added that an
Assyrian bas-relief now in the British Museum represents Tiamat with
horns and claws, tail and wings.

There is no need of drawing attention to the profound difference of
spiritual conception that exists between the Assyrian epic and the first
chapter of Genesis. The one is mythological and polytheistic, with an
introduction savouring of the later materialism of the schools; the
other is sternly monotheistic. Between Bel-Merodach and the Hebrew God
there is an impassable gulf.

It is unfortunate that the last lines of the epic in which the creation
of man would have been recorded have not yet been recovered. A passage
in one of the early magical texts of Babylonia, however, goes to show
that the Babylonians believed that the

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

woman was produced from the man, conformably to the statement in Gen.
ii. 22, 23. We there read of the seven evil spirits (W.A.I., iv. I. i.
36, 37) that "the woman from the man do they bring forth."
