15. was formed, with all those countries  
16. on my feet I fought.  
17. A destruction of them I made.

everlasting grace

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_213"></span>[103:4](rp20125.htm#fr_214.md) This seems to be
the meaning of *sabartum* in K 1999, i. 15.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[105:1](rp20125.htm#fr_215.md) That is, Lake Van.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[105:2](rp20125.htm#fr_216.md) Amadana was the
district about Amida or Diarbekir. Assur-natsir-pal reached Amadana
after leaving Adana, a district of Qurkhi.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[105:3](rp20125.htm#fr_217.md) Compare the names
of the Gamgumian and Melitenian princes Tarkhu-lara and Tarkhu-nazi, and
of the Hittite city Tarkhi-gamas mentioned by the Vannic king Menuas.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[106:1](rp20125.htm#fr_218.md) Nimme, according to
Assur-natsir-pal, adjoined Alzi and Dayaeni in the neighbourhood of
Mush.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[106:2](rp20125.htm#fr_219.md) This must be the
Dhunibun of Shalmaneser II, eastward of the sources of the Tigris, on
the river of Mush (the modern Kara Su).

<span id="fn_219"></span>[106:3](rp20125.htm#fr_220.md) In the Vannic
language the termination *ni*(*s*) denoted "belonging to," and *barzini*
or *barzani* signified "a chapel."

<span id="fn_220"></span>[106:4](rp20125.htm#fr_221.md) The Vannic king
calls the district in which Palu stands "the land of Puterias."

<span id="fn_221"></span>[106:5](rp20125.htm#fr_222.md) Perhaps the Abunis
of the Vannic inscriptions.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[106:6](rp20125.htm#fr_223.md) Dayaeni was on the
northern bank of the Arsanias, to the north of Mush. It is called the
kingdom of "the son of Diaus" in the Vannic texts, which define it more
closely as situated on the Murad Chai, near Melazgherd.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[106:7](rp20125.htm#fr_224.md) The land of Nairi
or "the rivers" denoted in the age of Tiglath-Pileser I. the districts
at the sources of the Tigris and the Euphrates. In the time of
Assur-natsir-pal and his successors, on the other hand, it was the
country between Lake Van and the northern frontier of Assyria, and
consequently lay to the south-west of the Nairi of the time of
Tiglath-Pileser I. It will be noticed that there was as yet no kingdom
of Ararat or Van.
