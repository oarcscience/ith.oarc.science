### Footnotes

<span id="fn_251"></span>[118:3](rp20129.htm#fr_252.md) The *Pate’sis*, or
high-priests of Assur, preceded the kings of Assyria, of whom the first
is stated to have been Bel-kapkapu. As Samas-Rimmon, the high-priest,
flourished 701 years before Tiglath-Pileser, his date would be about
B.C. 1830. In Babylonia the high-priests were subject to a suzerain
king; it is therefore probable that the high-priests of Assur also
admitted the supremacy of a supreme monarch who may have ruled in
Babylonia. Bricks have been found on the site of Ur in Babylonia bearing
the name of Isme-Dagon, "king of Sumer and Accad," but he must <span
id="page_119">p. 119</span> have lived at a much earlier period than
Samas-Rimmon, whose Babylonian contemporary was Gul-kisar.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[119:1](rp20129.htm#fr_253.md) Another mode of
spelling Nahri.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[119:2](rp20129.htm#fr_254.md) Literally "have not
laid down my side at the work."

<span id="fn_254"></span>[120:1](rp20129.htm#fr_255.md) Thereby turning
them into Beth-els or consecrated stones. Cf. Gen. xxviii. 18.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[121:1](rp20129.htm#fr_256.md) "Of
sheep-breeding," a name of Sivan or May, according to W.A.I., v 43, 14.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[121:2](rp20129.htm#fr_257.md) Literally " the
mighty men," like the *Gibborim* of the Old Testament; cf. 2 Sam. xxiii.
8. Assyrian chronology was reckoned according to the eponyms, officers
who gave their name to each year of the king's reign. As the inscription
of Rimmon-nirari I, who preceded Tiglath-Pileser I by about two hundred
years, is dated in the eponymy of Shalman-garradu ("the god Solomon is a
hero"), accurate chronology in Assyria went back to an early period.
