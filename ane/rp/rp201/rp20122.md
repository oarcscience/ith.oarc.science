55. I have contended furiously, <span id="fr_188"></span>[2](#fn_187)

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

69. trusted and came down; the land of <span
class="smallcaps">Kummukh</span> <span id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_190)  
70. they seized. Trusting in <span class="smallcaps">Asur</span> my

74. with their twenty thousand fighting men  
75. and their five kings in the land of <span
class="smallcaps">Kummukh</span>  
76. I contended. A destruction of them  
77. I made. The bodies of their warriors  
78. in destructive battle like the inundator (<span
class="smallcaps">Rimmon</span>)  
79. I overthrew; their corpses I spread  
80. over the valleys and the high places of the mountains.  
81. Their heads I cut off; at the sides  
82. of their cities I heaped (them) like mounds.  
83. Their spoil, their property, their goods,  
84. to a countless number I brought forth. Six thousand (men),  
85. the relics of their armies, which before  
86. my weapons had fled, took  
87. my feet. I laid hold upon them and  
88. counted them among the men of my own country.

89\. In those days, against <span class="smallcaps">Kummukh</span>, the
disobedient,  
90. which had withheld the tribute and gifts for <span
class="smallcaps">Asur</span> my lord,  
91. I marched. The land of <span class="smallcaps">Kummukh</span>  
92. I conquered throughout its circuit.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

93\. Their spoil, their property, their goods  
94. I brought forth; their cities with fire

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_181"></span>[92:1](rp20122.htm#fr_182) Identified with Ea
in W.A.I., ii. 60, 21.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[92:2](rp20122.htm#fr_183) Or "hollows."

<span id="fn_183"></span>[93:1](rp20122.htm#fr_184) "The Temple of the
Mountain of the World," the name of an old temple in the city of Assur,
which had been restored by Shalmaneser I (B.C. 1300). In early
Babylonian mythology "the Mountain of the World" was the Olympos on
which the gods dwelt, and which was identified with Mount Rowandiz. It
is referred to in Isaiah xiv. 13, where the Babylonian king is made to
say: "I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars
of Elohim: I will sit also on the mount of the assembly (of the gods) in
the extremities of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the
clouds; I will be like the most High."

<span id="fn_184"></span>[93:2](rp20122.htm#fr_185) *Isippu*, related to
*asipu*, "a diviner," which was borrowed by the Book of Daniel under the
form *ashshaph*, and may have the same origin as the name of Joseph.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[93:3](rp20122.htm#fr_186) *Pulugi*, the Hebrew
*Peleg*, in whose days the earth was "divided."

<span id="fn_186"></span>[94:1](rp20122.htm#fr_187) *Naplu*, probably
the same word as the Nephilim or "giants" of Gen. vi. 4 and Numb. xiii.
33. Sennacherib, in describing the construction of his palace, says: "A
railing of three bronze cords and the divine Napallu I erected above
it," where "the divine Napallu" probably refers to the image of a
protecting deity.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[94:2](rp20122.htm#fr_188) Literally, "in
drunken fashion" (*sutkuris*).

<span id="fn_188"></span>[94:3](rp20122.htm#fr_189) The Meshech of the
Old Testament, the Moschi of the classical writers, who in Assyrian
times occupied the country to the north of Malatiyeh. In the later
Assyrian inscriptions they are associated with the Tubal or Tibareni, as
in the Old Testament.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[94:4](rp20122.htm#fr_190) Alzi lay on the
southern bank of the Euphrates, between Palu and Khini, and included
Enzite, the Anzitênê of classical geography (at the <span
id="page_95">p. 95</span> sources of the Sebbeneh Su). Alzi was invaded
by the Vannic king Menuas, who says that it formed part of the territory
of the Khate or Hittites.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[95:1](rp20122.htm#fr_191) Kummukh, the
classical Komagêne, extended in the Assyrian age on either side of the
Euphrates, from Malatiyeh in the north to Birejik in the south, Merash
probably being one of its cities.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[95:2](rp20122.htm#fr_192) Literally, "I
awaited not the future."

<span id="fn_192"></span>[95:3](rp20122.htm#fr_193) Mons Masius, the
modern Tur Abdin.
