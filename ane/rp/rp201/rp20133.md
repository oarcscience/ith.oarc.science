#### FOURTH TABLET OF THE STORY OF THE CREATION

<span class="smallcaps">Obverse</span>

1\. So he established for him (*i.e.* <span
class="smallcaps">Merodach</span>) the shrine of the mighty;  
2. *before* (?) his fathers for a kingdom did he found (it). <span
id="fr_272"></span>[1](#fn_270)  
3. Yea, thou art glorious among the great gods;  
4. thy destiny is unrivalled; thy gift-day <span
id="fr_273"></span>[2](#fn_271) is (that of) <span
class="smallcaps">Anu</span>.  
5. O <span class="smallcaps">Merodach</span>, thou art glorious among
the great gods;  
6. thy destiny is unrivalled; thy gift-day is (that of) <span
class="smallcaps">Anu</span>.  
7. Since that day unchanged is thy command.  
8. High and low entreat thy hand:  
9. may the word that goes forth from thy mouth be established;
untroubled is thy gift-day.  
10. None among the gods has surpassed thy power  
11. at the time when (thy hand) founded the shrine of the god of the
sky. <span id="fr_274"></span>[3](#fn_272)  
12. May the place of their *gathering* (?) become thy home!  
13. "O <span class="smallcaps">Merodach</span>, thou art he who avenges
us;  
14. we give thee the sovereignty, (we) the hosts of all the universe!  
15. Thou possessest (it), and in the assembly (of the gods) mayest thou
exalt thy word!  
16. Never may thy weapons be broken; <span
id="fr_275"></span>[4](#fn_273) may thine enemies tremble!  
17. O lord, be gracious to the soul of him who putteth his trust in
thee,

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

18\. and destroy <span id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_274) the soul of the
god who has hold of evil."  
19. Then they set in their midst his saying unique; <span
id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_275)  
20. to <span class="smallcaps">Merodach</span> their first-born they
spake:  
21. "May thy destiny, O lord, go before the god of heaven;  
22. may *he confirm* (?) the destruction and creation of all that is
said.  
23. Set thy mouth; let it destroy his word:  
24. turn, speak unto it, and let him lift up his word (again)." <span
id="fr_278"></span>[3](#fn_276)  
25. He spake and with his mouth destroyed his word;  
26. he turned, he spake unto it and his word was re-created.  
27. Like (the word) that issues from his mouth the gods his fathers saw
it:  
28. they rejoiced, they approached <span
class="smallcaps">Merodach</span> the king.  
29. They bestowed upon him the sceptre (and) throne and reign;  
30. they gave him a weapon unsurpassed, consuming the hostile.  
31. "Go" (they said), "and cut off the life of <span
class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span>;  
32. let the winds carry her blood to secret places."  
33. The gods his fathers also hear the report of <span
class="smallcaps">Ea</span>:  
34. "A path of peace and obedience is the road I have caused (him) to
take."  
35. There was too the bow, as his weapon he prepared (it);  
36. he made the club swing, he fixed its seat;  
37. and he lifted up the sacred weapon <span
id="fr_279"></span>[4](#fn_277) which he bade his right hand hold.  
38. The bow and the quiver he hung at his side;

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

39\. he set the lightning before him;  
40. with a glance of swiftness he filled his body.  
41. He made also a snare to enclose the dragon of the sea.  
42. He seized the four winds that they might not issue forth, any one of
them,  
43. the south wind, the north wind, the east wind (and) the west wind.  
44. His hand brought the snare near the bow <span
id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_278) of his father <span
class="smallcaps">Anu</span>.  
45. He created the evil wind, the hostile wind, the storm, the
tempest,  
46. the four winds, the seven winds, the whirlwind, the unending wind;  
47. and he caused the winds which he had created to issue forth, the
seven of them,  
48. confounding the dragon <span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span>, as
they swept after him.  
49. Then the lord lifted up the deluge, his mighty weapon.  
50. He rode in the chariot of destiny that retreats without a
rival. <span id="fr_281"></span>[2](#fn_279)  
51. He stood firm and hung the four reins at its side.  
52. (He held the weapon?) unsparing, that overfloods her panoply.  
53. ……… their teeth carry poison.  
54. …… they sweep away the learned.  
55. …… might and battle.  
56. On the left they open their ……  
57. …… fear ……  
58. With the lightning-flash and … he crowned his head.  
59. He directed also (his way), he made his path descend, and  
60. humbly he set the … before him.  
61. By (his) command he kept back the …  
62. His finger holds the …

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

63\. On that day they exalted him, the gods exalted him,  
64. the gods his fathers exalted him, the gods exalted him.  
65. Then the lord approached; he catches <span
class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span> by her waist;  
66. she seeks the huge *bulk* (?) of <span
class="smallcaps">Kingu</span> her husband,  
67. she looks also for his counsel.  
68. Then the rebellious one (<span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span>)
appointed <span id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_280) him the overthrower of
the command of <span class="smallcaps">Bel</span>.  
69. But the gods his helpers who marched beside him  
70. beheld (how <span class="smallcaps">Merodach</span>) the first-born
held their yoke.  
71. He laid judgment on <span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span> (but) she
turned not her neck.  
72. With her hostile lip(s) she announced opposition.  
73. (Then) the gods (came) to the help of the lord, sweeping after
thee:  
74. they gathered their (forces) together to where thou vast.  
75. (And) the lord (launched) the deluge, his mighty weapon;  
76. (against) <span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span>, whom he requited,
he sent it with these words:  
77. "(War) on high thou hast excited.  
78. (Strengthen?) thy heart and muster (thy troops) against the
god(s).  
79. …… their fathers beside (thee).  
80. …… thou hast opposed  
81. …… to (thy) husband.  
82. ……… *lordship* (?)  
83. …………thou seekest.

<span class="smallcaps">Reverse</span>

1\. (Against) the gods my fathers thou has directed thy hostility.  
2. Thou harnesser of thy companions, may thy weapons reach their
bodie(s).  
3. Stand up, and I and thou will fight together."  
4. When <span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span> heard this,

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

5\. she uttered her former spells, she repeated her command.  
6. <span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span> also cried out vehemently with
a loud voice.  
7. From its roots she strengthened (her) seat completely.  
8. She recites an incantation, she casts a spell,  
9. and the gods of battle demand for themselves their arms.  
10. Then <span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span> attacked <span
class="smallcaps">Merodach</span> the chief prophet of the gods;  
11. in combat they joined; they met in battle.  
12. And the lord outspread his snare (and) enclosed her.  
13. He sent before him the evil wind to seize (her) from behind.  
14. And <span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span> opened her mouth to
swallow it.  
15. He made the evil wind enter so that she could not close her lips.  
16. The violence of the winds tortured her stomach, and  
17. her heart was prostrated and her mouth was twisted.  
18. He swung the club, he shattered her stomach;  
19. he cut out her entrails; he overmastered (her) heart;  
20. he bound her and ended her life.  
21. He threw down her corpse; he stood upon it.  
22. When <span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span> who marched before (them)
was conquered,  
23. he dispersed her forces, her host was overthrown,  
24. and the gods her allies who marched beside her  
25. trembled (and) feared (and) turned their backs.  
26. They escaped and saved their lives.  
2 7. They clung to one another fleeing helplessly.  
28. He followed them and shattered their weapons.  
29. He cast his snare and they are caught in his net.  
30. Knowing (?) the regions they are filled with grief.  
31. They bear their sin, they are kept in bondage,  
32. and the elevenfold offspring are troubled through fear.  
33. The spirits as they march *perceived* (?) the glory (of <span
class="smallcaps">Merodach</span>).  
34. His hand lays blindness (on their eyes).  
35. At the same time their opposition (is broken) from under them;

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

36\. and the god <span class="smallcaps">Kingu</span> who had
(marshalled) their (forces)  
37. he bound him also along with the god of the tablets (of destiny in)
his right hand.  
38. And he took from him the tablets of destiny (that were) upon him.  
39. With the string of the stylus he sealed (them) and held the … of the
tablet.  
40. From the time when he had bound (and) laid the yoke on his foes  
41. he led the illustrious enemy captive like an ox,  
42. he established fully the victory of <span
class="smallcaps">An-sar</span> <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_281)
over the foe;  
43. <span class="smallcaps">Merodach</span> overcame the lamentation of
(<span class="smallcaps">Ea</span>) the lord of the world.  
44. Over the gods in bondage he strengthened his watch, and  
45. <span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span> whom he had bound he turned
head backwards;  
46. then the lord trampled on the underpart of <span
class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span>.  
47. With his club unbound he smote (her) skull;  
48. he broke (it) and caused her blood to flow;  
49. the north wind bore (it) away to secret places. <span
id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_282)  
50. Then his father (<span class="smallcaps">Ea</span>) beheld (and)
rejoiced at the savour;  
51. he caused the *spirits* (?) to bring a peace-offering to himself.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

52\. So the lord rested; his body he feeds.  
53. He strengthens (his) *mind* (?), he forms a clever plan,  
54. and he stripped her of (her) skin like a fish, according to his
plan;  
55. he described her likeness and (with it) overshadowed the heavens;  
56. he stretched out the skin, he kept a watch,  
57. he urged on her waters that were not issuing forth;  
58. he lit up the sky; the sanctuary (of heaven) rejoiced, and  
59. he presented himself before the deep, the seat of <span
class="smallcaps">Ea</span>.  
60. Then the lord measured (<span class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span>) the
offspring of the deep;  
61. the chief prophet made of her <span id="fr_285"></span>[1](#fn_283)
image the house of the Firmament. <span
id="fr_286"></span>[2](#fn_284)  
62. <span class="smallcaps">Ê-sarra</span> which he had created (to be)
the heavens  
63. the chief prophet caused <span class="smallcaps">Anu</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Bel</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Ea</span> to
inhabit as their stronghold.

64\. \[*First line of the next tablet:*\] He prepared the mansions of
the great gods.  
65. \[<span class="smallcaps">Colophon</span>.\] One hundred and
forty-six lines of the 4th tablet (of the series beginning:) "When on
high unproclaimed."

injured.  
67. Copied for <span class="smallcaps">Nebo</span> his lord by
Nahid-Merodach, the son of the irrigator, for the preservation of his
life  
68. and the life of all his house. He wrote and placed (it) in <span

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_270"></span>[136:1](rp20133.htm#fr_272) These are the last
two lines of the Third Tablet.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[136:2](rp20133.htm#fr_273) *’Sigar*. In
W.A.I., v. I, 12, we read that the 12th of Iyyar was the *’sigar* or
"festival" of the goddess Gula.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[136:3](rp20133.htm#fr_274) Literally "the
covering of heaven" (*nalbas same*).

<span id="fn_273"></span>[136:4](rp20133.htm#fr_275) Literally "may they
open."

<span id="fn_274"></span>[137:1](rp20133.htm#fr_276) Literally "pour
out."

<span id="fn_275"></span>[137:2](rp20133.htm#fr_277) The "saying," or
"Word," is regarded as having a real existence which could be created,
destroyed, and re-created by Merodach. The "Word" is similarly
personified in Zech. ix. 1.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[137:3](rp20133.htm#fr_278) We have here the
same idea as in the "burden" of the Hebrew prophets, the Assyrian verb
"to lift up" being *nasu*, the Hebrew *nasâ*, whence *massâ*, "a burden"
or "oracle."

<span id="fn_277"></span>[137:4](rp20133.htm#fr_279) The *badhdhu* was
the name of the weapon sacred to Merodach. From the sculptures it would
appear to have been a kind of boomerang.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[138:1](rp20133.htm#fr_280) Here we have a
curiously weakened form, *kisti* instead of *qasti*.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[138:2](rp20133.htm#fr_281) Or if we correct
the text and read *makhri la galidta*, "that fears not a rival."

<span id="fn_280"></span>[139:1](rp20133.htm#fr_282) Read *ip-qid*.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[141:1](rp20133.htm#fr_283) The primæval god of
the Firmament.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[141:2](rp20133.htm#fr_284) The meaning of the
blood of Tiamat is shown by the two contradictory Babylonian legends of
the creation which Berôssos, the Chaldean historian, has amalgamated
together:—"Bêlos (Merodach) came and cut the woman (Tiamat) asunder, and
of one half of her he formed the earth, and of the other half the
heavens, and at the same time destroyed the animals within her (in the
abyss). All this was an allegorical description of nature. For, the
whole universe consisting of moisture, and animals being continually
generated therein, the deity above mentioned (Bêlos) cut off his own
head; upon which the other gods mixed the blood, as it gushed out, with
the earth, and from thence men were formed. On this account it is that
they are rational and partake of divine knowledge." Similarly, according
to Philon Byblios, Phœnician cosmology declared that the blood of Uranos
or Baal-samaim, when mutilated by his son Kronos near the rivers and
fountains, flowed into them and fertilised the earth.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[142:1](rp20133.htm#fr_285) "Its" in the
original.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[142:2](rp20133.htm#fr_286) Ê-Sarra.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[142:3](rp20133.htm#fr_287) Ê-Zida, "the
constituted house," was the great temple of Nebo in Borsippa, now
represented by the Birs-i-Nimrud. The copy of the text deposited in it
by Nahid-Merodach was probably made in the Persian age.
