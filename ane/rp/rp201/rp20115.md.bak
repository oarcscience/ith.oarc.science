### Footnotes

<span id="fn_146"></span>[68:1](rp20115.htm#fr_147.md) From a squeeze in
the Louvre. Translated by Dr. Oppert in a *Communication to the Académie
des Inscriptions*, 29th February 1884.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[69:1](rp20115.htm#fr_148.md) \[Bau is probably
the Baau of Phœnician mythology, whose name was interpreted "the night,"
and who was supposed along with her husband Kolpia, "the wind," to have
produced the first generation of men. The word has been compared with
the Hebrew *bohu*, translated "void" in Gen. i. 2.—Ed.\]

<span id="fn_148"></span>[69:2](rp20115.htm#fr_149.md) \["The temple of the
father."—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_149"></span>[69:3](rp20115.htm#fr_150.md) Or Nin-dun.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[70:1](rp20115.htm#fr_151.md) \["The temple of the
father."—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_151"></span>[70:2](rp20115.htm#fr_152.md) \["The temple of the
brilliance of the (eastern) mountain."—*Ed*.\]

<span id="fn_152"></span>[71:1](rp20115.htm#fr_153.md) *Découvertes*, pl.
32.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[71:2](rp20115.htm#fr_154.md) Possibly the small
tablets of white or black stone buried under the foundations of the
temples. These tablets were sometimes of metal; those, for example,
discovered at Khorsabad. It seems that some consisted also of ivory and
precious wood; see W.A.I., i. 49, col. 4, 12.
