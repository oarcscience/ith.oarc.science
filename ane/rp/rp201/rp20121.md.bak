### INSCRIPTION OF TIGLATH-PILESER I

#### KING OF ASSYRIA

##### TRANSLATED BY THE EDITOR

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> inscription of Tiglath-Pileser I. is
the longest and most important of the early Assyrian records that have
come down to us. The genealogical details given in it are of great value
for determining the chronology and succession of the earlier monarchs of
Assyria, while the description of the campaigns of the king throws a
brilliant and unexpected light on the ancient geography of Western Asia.
To the geographer, indeed, the care with which Tiglath-Pileser
enumerates the countries he overran and the cities he sacked is of
inestimable importance. A new chapter has been added to the history of
ancient geography, and we now possess a fairly complete map of the
districts north and north-west of Assyria before the overthrow of the
Hittite power had brought with it revolution and change. We find
geographical names of similar form stretching westwards from the
neighbourhood of Lake Van to the confines of Asia Minor, together with
evidence that tribes like those

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

of the Moskhi and Tibareni, whose scanty relics in later days found a
refuge on the shores of the Black Sea, once inhabited extensive tracts
on the slopes of the Taurus Mountains. A new world has, in fact, been
opened up to the geographer.

Equally new is the world that has been opened up to the historian. The
date of Tiglath-Pileser I can be approximately fixed by the help of an
inscription of Sennacherib. On the rock of Bavian (W.A.I. iii. 14,
48-50) Sennacherib refers to "Rimmon and Sala, the gods of the City of
Palaces (*Ekallati*), which Merodach-nadin-akhi, King of Accad, had
taken and carried away to Babylon in the time of Tiglath-Pileser, King
of Assyria"; and he goes on to say that he himself had "brought them out
of Babylon 418 years afterwards." As the restoration of the images took
place after Sennacherib's destruction of Babylon in B.C. 688, the date
of their capture by Merodach-nadin-akhi would be B.C. 1106. The
conquests and campaigns described in Tiglath-Pileser's inscription must
therefore be placed before this year.

The expeditions of Tiglath-Pileser, however, bore but little fruit. They
were not much more than raids, whose effects passed away after the death
of the king who conducted them. In a fragmentary inscription of his son
and successor, Assur-bil-kala, mention is made of "the land of the
west," or Phœnicia, but it is doubtful whether any further campaigns
were carried out in this direction. Assyria

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

fell into a state of decay; its frontier cities passed into other hands,
and for nearly two hundred years it is hidden altogether from sight. It
was not until the ninth century before our era that under the warlike
Assur-natsir-pal and his son Shalmaneser II it once more became a name
of terror to Western Asia. Tiglath-Pileser I remained the central figure
of the older empire, towering above his fellows on the Assyrian throne.
When the ancient line of princes became extinct, and the crown was
seized by the usurper Pul, the new king knew of no better way in which
to legitimise his claim to sovereignty than by assuming the
time-honoured name of Tukulti-pal-Esar or Tiglath-Pileser, "the servant
of (Uras) the divine son of Esarra."

Though Tiglath-Pileser was not brought into direct relations with
Palestine, it is probable that his wars, followed as they were by the
temporary decay of Assyria, had much to do with the rise of the empire
of David. The wars of Tiglath-Pileser weakened the power of the Hittites
in the north, and allowed the small states of Syria to make head against
them. For more than a century the latter had no powerful neighbours to
fear or court. Egypt had passed under eclipse, and was divided between
rival dynasties of kings, while Assyria had equally ceased to be
formidable. When David and Joab built up the empire of Israel, there was
no strong enemy to oppose and attack them. Hadadezer of Zobah might go
"to recover his border at the river"

was no Hittite or Assyrian monarch to stand in his way.

The inscription of Tiglath-Pileser I is inscribed on four large
octagonal cylinders of clay, originally buried under the foundations of
the four corners of the great temple of Kileh Sherghat, the ancient city
of Assur, and now in the British Museum; and it has been published in
the *Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia*, i. pl. ix.–xvi. In 1857
the inscription was selected for testing the substantial correctness of
the method employed by the Assyriologists, and of the results obtained
by them. On the proposal of the Royal Asiatic Society, four translations
of it, more or less complete, were made independently by Sir Henry
Rawlinson, Mr. Fox Talbot, Dr. Hincks, and Dr. Oppert, and submitted
under seal to the secretary of the Society. When opened and compared, it
was found that they exhibited a remarkable resemblance to one another as
regards both the transliteration of proper names and the rendering of
individual passages. The resemblance, in fact, was greater than could be
accounted for, except on the assumption that the method employed by the
decipherers was a sound one, and that they were working on a solid
basis. Since 1857 immense advances have been made in our knowledge of
Assyrian. Characters whose values were then unknown, and words whose
meaning was obscure, are now familiar to the student; and a historical
inscription like that of Tiglath-Pileser presents

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

but few difficulties to the Assyriologist of today.

In 1880 the inscription was re-edited and translated with notes and
glossary by Dr. W. Lotz under the auspices of his teacher, Prof. Fr.
Delitzsch. The translation embodied all the stores of increased
knowledge which the incessant labour of twenty-three years had
accumulated, and it is only in a comparatively few passages that it can
be improved. The English reader may now consider that he has before him
the actual words of the old Assyrian king, and can use them for
historical and geographical purposes without fear or reservation. The
foot-notes will be found to contain all the geographical information at
present attainable relative to the localities mentioned in the text.

A word or two must be added on the name of the divinity to whom
Tiglath-Pileser was dedicated by his parents. This deity represented the
Sun-god primitively worshipped at Nipur (now Niffer) in Babylonia, who
afterwards came to be regarded as a sort of Chaldean Herakles. He is the
only deity of the first rank whose name is still a matter of dispute. It
is generally given as Adar in default of anything better, but the
reading is certainly false. According to the monuments he was called
Uras in Accadian, and also in Semitic, when regarded as "the god of
light." But he was further known in Assyrian as Baru "the revealer,"
though we learn from a Babylonian text recently discovered in Upper

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Egypt that his
more usual title was Masu, "the hero," a word which is, letter for
letter, the same as the Hebrew Mosheh, "Moses." Masu is defined as being
"the Sun-god who rises from the divine day." As such he was identified
with one of the primæval gods of Accadian cosmology, and so became " the
son of Ê-sarra," or "the house of the firmament." See my *Lectures on
the Religion of the Ancient Babylonians*, pp. 151–153.
