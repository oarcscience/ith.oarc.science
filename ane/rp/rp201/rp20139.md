### INSCRIPTION OF MENUAS, KING OF ARARAT, IN THE VANNIC LANGUAGE

#### <span class="smallcaps">Translated by the Editor</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Since</span> the publication of my Memoir on
"The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Van Deciphered and Translated " in the
*Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society*, xiv. 4, 1882, we have begun to
learn something about a race of kings who ruled on the shores of Lake
Van in Armenia, from the ninth to the seventh centuries before our era.
The founder of the dynasty, Sarduris I, the son of Lutipris, who reigned
in B.C. 833, introduced the cuneiform system of writing as well as other
elements of Assyrian culture into the country over which he was king.
The inscriptions he has left us are in the Assyrian language; but his
successors discontinued the use of a foreign tongue, and the language of
their texts is invariably their native one. It is semi-flectional in
character, and possibly belongs to the same family of speech as that of
which Georgian is the modern representative. For want of a better name
it is known as Vannic. The story of its decipherment will be found in
the Memoir above cited.

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

The grandson of Sarduris I was Menuas, a prince who carried his arms far
and wide, and has bequeathed to us numerous records of his wars and
buildings. Far away from his capital of Dhuspas or Tosp, near the
mountain of Rowandiz and the Lake of Urumiyeh, on the summit of the pass
of Keli-shin, 12,000 feet above the level of the sea, is a monument of
his campaigns, which is wrapt during the greater part of the year in a
coating of ice; in the north he engraved his inscriptions beside the
banks of the Araxes, while the record of his campaign against "the land
of the Hittites" is inscribed on the cliff of the Euphrates at Palu,
about midway between Malatiyeh and Van.

The inscription translated here was copied by Schulz and Sir A. H.
Layard from a stone built into the wall of a vault under the church of
Sts. Peter and Paul at Van, and a squeeze of it has been taken by
Captain Clayton. The transliterated text and analysis will be found in
my Memoir, xxxii. p. 555. The text is mutilated in parts, and at the
time my Memoir was published I was unable to restore some of the
passages in it. The progress that has since been made, however, in the
study of the Vannic inscriptions, enables me now to supply their
deficiencies, and also to correct and supplement the translation I then
gave. For the sake of Vannic scholars I append here a transliterated
text of the inscription as it should read after the restoration of the
missing characters:—

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We learn from the
inscription that the land of the *Khate* or Hittites extended as far
north as Alzi, the situation of which is given in the inscription of
Tiglath-Pileser I (i. 64; see above, [p. 94](rp20122.htm#page_94.md), note
[4](rp20122.htm#fn_189).md), and that Sada-hadas, whose name was perhaps
pronounced Sanda-hadas, was the king of that portion of the Hittite
nation with which Menuas was brought into contact. The mention of the
name of the Khate or Hittites on this and other Vannic monuments shows
that the name was not confined to the Hittites of the south.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_322"></span>[166:1](rp20139.htm#fr_325.md) The supreme god of
Van was Khaldis, but as each tribe or district also worshipped a god of
the same name, there were many Khaldis-gods who are invoked by the
Vannic kings along with the supreme Khaldis of Van. It was from the
worship of Khaldis that the population of a part of Armenia became known
to the Greeks as Khaldæi, a name naturally confounded with that of the
Chaldeans of Babylonia.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[166:2](rp20139.htm#fr_326.md) The Vannic kings
usually call themselves kings of Biainas or Bianas, a name which has
passed through the Byana of Ptolemy into the modern Van. Van is now,
however, the name of the city which the Vannic kings called Dhuspas or
Tosp, instead of denoting a district as it did in their time, Tosp being
now the name of the district. Biainas was known to the Assyrians under
the name of Urardhu, the Ararat of the Old Testament. Mount Ararat, it
may be noted, is a modern designation, the name of Ararat not being
applied to the country north of the Araxes in the Biblical age, and "the
mountains of Ararat" of Genesis viii. 4 signifying, as in the Assyrian
inscriptions, the Kurdish mountains to the south of Lake Van.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[166:3](rp20139.htm#fr_327.md) The Mâna of the
Vannic texts are the Mannâ of the Assyrians, the Minni of the Old
Testament, whose position is shown by the inscriptions to have been
immediately to the west of the kingdom of Van, from which they were
separated by the Kotûr range.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[166:4](rp20139.htm#fr_328.md) *Khai-tû* may be
connected with *khai-di-a-ni*, "fruits" (from *khai*, "to grow"), but it
may also be a compound of *tu* and *kha*, "to possess," like *’sui-du*,
"to set for a possession," or *abili-du*, "to set on fire."

<span id="fn_326"></span>[166:5](rp20139.htm#fr_329.md) Tarkhi-gamas seems
to be compounded with the name of the Hittite god Tarkhu, like
Tarkhu-lara, king of the Gamgumâ, and Tarkhu-nazi, king of Malatiyeh,
mentioned on the Assyrian monuments.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[167:1](rp20139.htm#fr_330.md) This expression is
of frequent occurrence in the Vannic texts, and its literal translation
is certified by ideographs; but what it means is doubtful.
