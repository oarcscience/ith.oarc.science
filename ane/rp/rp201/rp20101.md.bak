*Records of the Past, 2nd series, Vol. I*, ed. by A. H. Sayce, \[1888\],

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PREFACE

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> favourable reception accorded to the
first series of *Records of the Past*, and the hope more than once
expressed since its discontinuance that a similar series would be again
started, have led to this second attempt to lay before the public some
of the most important documents left us by the civilised nations of the
ancient Oriental world. During the ten years that have elapsed since the
first series was concluded, Assyrian research may be said to have
entered upon a new phase. Expeditions have returned from Babylonia,
bringing with them the spoils of ancient libraries, the clay tablets
preserved in the British Museum and elsewhere have been copied and
examined with increased industry and exactness, and students have been
flocking to the new study in Germany and America. The decipherment of
the cuneiform inscriptions of Van has opened up a fresh world of
language and history, and the geography of Western Asia in the Assyrian
epoch has been mapped out in almost all its essential details.

The increase of materials, and more especially of

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

labourers in the field of research, has made our knowledge of the
Assyrian lexicon at once wider and more accurate. Inscriptions which
were still obscure ten years ago can now be read with a fair approach to
exactness, while many of the translations proposed in the former series
of the *Records* can be amended in many respects. Indeed there are
certain cases in which the progress of knowledge has shown the tentative
renderings of a few years ago to be so faulty, if not misleading, that
it has been determined to replace them by revised translations in the
series which is now being issued.

The new series will, it is hoped, be found to be an improvement upon its
predecessor in certain points. The translations will be provided with
fuller introductions and notes, bearing more particularly upon the
history, geography, and theology of the texts, and drawing attention to
the illustrations they afford of the Scriptures of the Old Testament.
The historical inscriptions, moreover, will be published, so far as is
possible, in chronological order.

In one point, however, a difference will be noticed between the plan of
this second series of *Records* and that of the first. The value of a
translation from a language known only to a few scholars depends in
large measure upon the confidence with which its precise wording can be
accepted. The writer who wishes to make use of a translation from an
Egyptian or Assyrian text for historical or controversial purposes ought
to know where it is certain, and

<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>

where it is only possible, or at most probable. He ought to receive
warning of passages or words or readings of doubtful character, and the
translator ought to provide proofs of any new renderings he may give. In
the present series of volumes, accordingly, doubtful words and
expressions will be followed by a note of interrogation, the preceding
word being put into italics where necessary: otherwise italics will be
used only for the transliteration of proper names or words which cannot
at present be translated. The notes will contain a justification of new
translations, whether of words hitherto undeciphered or of words to
which a different signification has hitherto been attached. The names of
individuals will be distinguished from those of deities or localities by
being printed in Roman type, whereas the names of deities and localities
will be in capitals.

Though exploration and discovery have been carried on actively in Egypt
during the last decade, thanks mainly to the Egypt Exploration Fund and
the enterprise of Professor Maspero, the results have not been so
startling or numerous as those which have attended the progress of the
younger study of Assyriology. There is not the same reason for amending
the translations, previously published, of Egyptian documents, nor has
any large number of historical texts been brought to light. Instead,
therefore, of publishing alternately translations from the Assyrian and
Egyptian monuments, Assyrian and Egyptian texts will appear in the same
volume,

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

though it will doubtless happen that the Assyrian element will
preponderate in some volumes, the Egyptian element in others. Egyptian
and Assyrian, of course, will not be exclusively represented; Phœnicians
and Proto-Armenians have left us written monuments, comparatively few
though they may be, and the *Records of the Past* would be incomplete
without such important inscriptions as that of the Moabite king Mesha or
of the Hebrew Pool of Siloam.

In commending the first volume of this new series of *Records* to the
approval of the public, the Editor must not forget to say that the
enterprise is international, eminent scholars belonging to all
nationalities having consented to take part in it, and that if his name
appears somewhat too frequently in the present volume, it is a fault
which shall not occur again.
