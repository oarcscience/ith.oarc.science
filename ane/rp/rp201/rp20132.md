#### THIRD TABLET OF THE STORY OF THE CREATION

<span class="smallcaps">Obverse</span>

17\. "The gods have marched round her, <span
id="fr_262"></span>[1](#fn_261.md) all of them;  
18. up to those whom thou hast created at her side I have gone."  
19. When they were *gathered* (?) beside her, <span
class="smallcaps">Tiamat</span> they approached.  
20. The strong one (<span class="smallcaps">Merodach</span>), the
glorious, who desists not night or day,  
21. the exciter to battle, was disturbed in heart.  
22. Then they marshalled (their) forces; they create darkness.  
23. "The mother of <span class="smallcaps">Khubur</span>, <span
id="fr_263"></span>[2](#fn_262.md) the creatress of them all,  
24. I pursued with (my) weapons unsurpassed; (then) did the great
snake(s) bite. <span id="fr_264"></span>[3](#fn_263.md)  
25. With my teeth sharpened unsparingly did I bite.  
26. With poisoned breath like blood their bodies I filled.  
27. The raging vampires <span id="fr_265"></span>[4](#fn_264.md) I clothed
with terror.  
28. I lifted up the lightning-flash, on high I launched (it). <span
id="fr_266"></span>[5](#fn_265.md)  
29. Their messenger <span class="smallcaps">Sar-baba</span> ……  
30. Their bodies were struck, but it pierced not their breasts.  
31. I made ready the dragon, the mighty serpent and the god <span
class="smallcaps">Lakha(ma)</span>,

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

32\. the great reptile, the deadly beast and the scorpion-man, <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_266.md)  
33. the devouring <span id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_267.md) reptiles, the
fish-man <span id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_266.md) and the
gazelle-god, <span id="fr_270"></span>[3](#fn_268.md)  
34. lifting up (my) weapons that spare not, fearless of battle,  
35. strong through the law which (yields?) not before the foe.  
36. The eleven-fold (offspring), like him (their messenger), were
utterly (overthrown?).  
37. Among the gods her forces  
38. I humbled the god <span class="smallcaps">Kingu</span> <span
id="fr_271"></span>[4](#fn_269) in the sight (of his consort?.md), the
queen.  
39. They who went in front before the army (I smote?),  
40. lifting up (my) weapons, a snare for <span
class="smallcaps">Ti(amat)</span>.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_261"></span>[134:1](rp20132.htm#fr_262.md) *I’skhuru-si*.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[134:2](rp20132.htm#fr_263.md) Khubur is
identified with ’Su-edin on the eastern side of the Babylonian plain in
W.A.I., ii. 50, 51. Professor Delitzsch suggests that the expression
*ummu Khubur* may be the origin of the name Omorôka assigned by Berôssos
to Tiamat.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[134:3](rp20132.htm#fr_264.md) *Ittaqur* from
*naqaru*. In Hebrew the verb is used especially of piercing the eyes.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[134:4](rp20132.htm#fr_265.md) The *usumgalli* or
"solitary monsters" were fabulous beasts who were supposed to devour the
corpses of the dead, and were therefore not exactly vampires which
devoured the living, but corresponded rather with one of the creatures
mentioned in Is. xiii. 21, 22; xxxiv. 14.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[134:5](rp20132.htm#fr_266.md) *Umtas*\[*sir*\].

<span id="fn_266"></span>[135:1](rp20132.htm#fr_269.md) According to the
9th tablet of the Epic of Gisdhubar, "the scorpion-men" guard the gate
between "the twin mountains" through which the sun passes at its rising
and setting. The fish-man was Oannes, afterwards identified with Ea, who
brought wisdom and culture to Chaldæa out of the Persian Gulf.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[135:2](rp20132.htm#fr_268.md) *Dapruti* (see
W.A.I., v. 16, 80) from the same root as *diparatu*, "a flame."

<span id="fn_268"></span>[135:3](rp20132.htm#fr_270.md) The gazelle-god was
identified by the later mythology of Babylonia, sometimes with Ea the
god of Eridu, sometimes with Bel the god of Nipur: see my *Lectures on
the Religion of the Ancient Babylonians*, pp. 283 *seq*.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[135:4](rp20132.htm#fr_271.md) Kingu was the
husband of Tiamat.
