<span class="smallcaps">Number 1</span>

This text is a letter from Arad-Nanā, who seems to have been a
physician, to the king of Assyria at the time, concerning a man,
possibly an Assyrian prince and near relation of the king, who was ill.
Indeed,

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

so ill was he, that the writer did not expect that he would live more
than seven or eight days longer (see the last sentence of the
translation). One ray of comfort only does the writer hold out, and that
is, that the sufferer might recover, if the king would only cause prayer
to be made to his gods.

Judging from the text, it is hardly likely that the sickness from which
the man was suffering was a natural one. He had doubtless received a
wound or injury—perhaps several—and it was very probable that one of
these, which he had received in his head, would prove mortal.

The number of the tablet is S 1064.

<span class="smallcaps">Translation</span>

To the king my lord, thy servant Arad-Nanā. May there be peace for ever
and ever to the king my lord. May the god <span
class="smallcaps">Ninep</span> <span id="fr_509"></span>[1](#fn_506.md) and
the goddess <span class="smallcaps">Gula</span> give soundness of heart
and soundness of flesh to the king my lord. Peace for ever.

To reduce the general inflammation of his forehead, <span
id="fr_510"></span>[2](#fn_507.md) I have tied a bandage upon it. His face
is swollen. <span id="fr_511"></span>[3](#fn_508.md) Yesterday, as
formerly, I opened the wound which had been received in the midst of it.
As for the bandage which was over the swelling, matter was upon the
bandage, the size of the tip of the little finger. Thy gods, if the
whole of the flesh of his body they can restore unto him, cause thou to
invoke, and his mouth will cry <span id="fr_512"></span>[4](#fn_509.md):
"Peace for ever. May the heart of the king my lord be good."

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

He will live seven or eight days. <span id="fr_513"></span>[1](#fn_510.md)

 

The text of which the translation is given above forms one of a number
published by the Rev. S. A. Smith in his book *Die Keilschrifttexte
Asurbanipals*, Heft II (the 17th plate), to which publication I
contributed a German rendering, with philological notes. <span
id="fr_514"></span>[2](#fn_511.md) The translation here given differs
slightly from that which I published in S. A. Smith's
*Keilschrifttexte*. The alterations are two in number, the first being
in the eleventh line of the original, where, instead of reading *sa kuri
êna-su*, "which is around his eyes," I now read *sa kutal êna-su*, "of
the wall of his eyes," most likely meaning his "brows," or
"forehead;" <span id="fr_515"></span>[3](#fn_512.md) the other change is in
the nineteenth and twentieth lines of the original text, where, instead
of regarding *ûtuli* as a verb, with the meaning of "I raised," "took
off" ("I took off the bandage which was around it"), I now take it to be
a noun with the meaning of "swelling." Though the sense of the whole is
pretty clear, the translation will probably be still further improved as
time goes on.

Other tablets of this class exist, and one of them,

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> K 519, is of great
interest in connection with the text above translated. This other text
is also from Arad-Nanā, and probably refers to the same sick man, who
seems to have been the king's son. "Concerning the sick man," Arad-Nanā
says, "from whose face blood flows, the Rab-mugi (Rab-mag?) <span
id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_513.md) has said thus: 'Yesterday, as before,
much (?) blood flowed.' He took off those bandages (*lippi âmmute*) with
care. <span id="fr_517"></span>[2](#fn_514) Upon the wounds (?.md) of his
face it was inflamed (?). The injuries are improving. Before the
blood <span id="fr_518"></span>[3](#fn_515.md) flows, let him make the
opening of the nostril <span id="fr_519"></span>[4](#fn_516.md)—the
breath <span id="fr_520"></span>[5](#fn_517.md) will come through, the
blood will stop." A few more lines end the communication. This document,
which is exceedingly interesting, is rather defaced here and there, thus
greatly adding to the difficulties of a naturally difficult text. The
important point about it is that, besides the interesting words that it
contains, it gives the record of what may be called a surgical
operation. Whether this communication preceded, in order of time, the
text of which the full translation is given above, is doubtful; though,
taking into consideration the hopeful tone of K 519, and the despairing
tone of S 1064, the precedence of the former is exceedingly probable.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

In the introduction it will be noticed that Ninep and Gula are invoked.
The former, as a star, was sometimes named *Nin-azu*, "the lord
physician." His more usual title, however, is "the warrior," and he is
also named "lord of the weapon" (*bêl kakki*), though the text which
gives him this title invokes him to "remove the sickness." <span
id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_518.md) The "warrior," able to cause wounds, was
supposed to be able also to remove them. Gula, "the great lady," who is
also called "the lady of Isin" or Karrag, was the consort of Ninep,
especially under his name of Utu-gisgallu. Another of her names (like
those already mentioned, Akkadian) is Nin-tin-badaga, "the lady giving
life to the dead." Nebuchadnezzar speaks of her as the preserver and
perfecter of his life (*edhirat*, *gamilat nabistia*). In another text,
where she is named Nin-Karrag ("lady of Karrag"), she is spoken of as
"the physician, high and great," and invoked to "take far away the grief
of his (the sick man's) body." In this text her name occurs between
Istar and Bau, who are apparently other forms of the same goddess. <span

remarked, that the word "blood" (dâmu) is always used, as in Hebrew, in
the plural. The phrase in the original is "before the bloods have
flowed" (*ultu pani dâme utsûni*).
