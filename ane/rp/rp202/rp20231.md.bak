### SPECIMENS OF ASSYRIAN CORRESPONDENCE

<span class="smallcaps">By Theo. G. Pinches.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> is probably no branch of
Assyro-Babylonian literature that is more attractive than the
correspondence. Not only do the letters which have been found in the
ancient record-offices of Assyria and Babylonia furnish the student with
specimens of the modes of thought and expression of the ordinary people,
and enable him to see in what consisted their communications, what were
their intrigues, their joys, and their sorrows; but they also furnish
him with valuable sidelights upon the history, religion, manners,
customs, and last, not least, important philological information—the
peculiar idioms and pronunciation of different districts, the varieties
of style of the different scribes.

The National Collection contains several hundred tablets bearing
inscriptions of this class, addressed to and from various persons in
different parts of the Assyrian empire, implying a very perfect system
of communication between Nineveh, the capital, and the outlying
districts. The subjects treated of vary from simple greetings to
descriptions of hostile demonstrations,

congratulations, claims upon the royal clemency, answers to
astrological, philological, and other questions, medical and other
reports, proclamations, etc. etc. These letters are generally oblong
tablets of baked clay, across which the lines of writing are inscribed
the narrow way. It is not unlikely that many of the documents of this
class which have come down to us are copies, the originals having been
sent away from Nineveh. Papyrus was probably used for these documents,
but clay letters were also sent about. These latter sometimes bad an
envelope of clay around them, addressed and sealed with the sender's
cylinder.

The number of dated letters is very small in comparison with those
without dates, so that we can only arrive at an idea as to when they
were written by internal evidence, such as names, places, and historical
events. The precise dates of many of them, however, must always remain
uncertain.

These documents vary in length from one to six inches, and in width from
three-quarters of an inch to about two inches and a half. The present
texts are of sizes about midway between these two extremes.
