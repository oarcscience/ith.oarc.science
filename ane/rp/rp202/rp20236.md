#### HYMN TO THE SETTING SUN

O Sun, in the middle of the sky, at thy setting,  
may the bright gates welcome thee favourably, <span
id="fr_546"></span>[1](#fn_543.md)  
may the door of heaven be docile to thee.  
May the god director, <span id="fr_547"></span>[2](#fn_544.md) thy faithful
messenger, mark the way!  
In <span class="smallcaps">E-Bara</span>, <span
id="fr_548"></span>[3](#fn_545.md) seat of thy royalty, he makes thy
greatness shine forth.  
May the Moon, thy beloved spouse, <span id="fr_549"></span>[4](#fn_546.md)
come to meet thee with joy. <span id="fr_550"></span>[5](#fn_547.md)  
May thy heart rest in peace.  
May the glory of thy godhead remain with thee.  
Powerful hero, O Sun! shine gloriously. <span
id="fr_551"></span>[6](#fn_548.md)  
Lord of <span class="smallcaps">E-Bara</span>, direct in thy road thy
foot rightly.  
O Sun, in making thy way, take the path marked for thy rays!  
Thou art the lord of judgments over all nations.

<span class="smallcaps">Colophon of the Temple Copy</span>

This is the hymn to the setting sun, the incantator <span
id="fr_552"></span>[7](#fn_549.md) says it after the beginning of the
night.

*First line of the next Tablet*.

O Sun, rising in the shining sky. <span id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_550.md)

Tablet which Nabu-damik, son of … has copied and translated from the old
copy.

<span class="smallcaps">Colophon of the Ex-Voto Copy</span>.

Nabu-balatsu-ikbi, son of E-sagilian, for the preservation of his life
has had this tablet written for Nebo, his lord, by Nabu-epis-akhi, son
of E-sagilian, and placed it in the temple <span
class="smallcaps">E-zida</span>.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_543"></span>[192:1](rp20236.htm#fr_546.md) The Assyrian
version has "speak of peace to thee."

<span id="fn_544"></span>[192:2](rp20236.htm#fr_547.md) This is the god who
walked in front of the Sun, the forerunner.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[192:3](rp20236.htm#fr_548.md) E-bara is the name
of the temple of the Sun-god.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[192:4](rp20236.htm#fr_549.md) One of the two
copies says "thy beloved sister;" the Moon was considered sometimes as
wife, sometimes as sister of the Sun, as perhaps being both.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[192:5](rp20236.htm#fr_550.md) The Assyrian has
"go in front of thee."

<span id="fn_548"></span>[192:6](rp20236.htm#fr_551.md) The Assyrian has
"glorify thyself."

<span id="fn_549"></span>[192:7](rp20236.htm#fr_552.md) This is the name of
a class of priests, whose functions were to repeat certain prayers or
incantations at certain hours.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[193:1](rp20236.htm#fr_553.md) When tablets formed
a series, each one always gave at the end the first line of the next
tablet of the series. In this case the line is important, because, as
the hymn to the setting sun is given first, it shows that the
Babylonians, like the Jews, placed the night first.
