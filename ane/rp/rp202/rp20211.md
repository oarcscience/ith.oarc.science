#### THE STELE OF THOTHMES IV

1\. The first year, the third month of the inundation (Athyr), the 19th
day, under the Majesty of the <span class="smallcaps">Horus</span>, the
strong bull who produces the risings (of the sun), the master of
diadems, whose royalty is stable as \[that of\] <span
class="smallcaps">Tum</span>, the golden hawk, prevailing with the
glaive, the vanquisher of the nine bows, <span
id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113) king of the South and of the North,
Men-khopiru-Ri, the son of the Sun, Thothmos Khakeu, beloved of <span
class="smallcaps">Amon-Ra</span>, king of the gods, giver of life
serene, like <span class="smallcaps">Ra</span>, eternally.

2\. The good god lives, the son of Tuna, who lays claim on <span
class="smallcaps">Harmakhis</span> the sphinx, the life of the universal
lord; the omnipotent <span id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114) who creates
the beneficent flesh of <span class="smallcaps">Khopri</span>, beautiful
of face like the chief his father. As soon as he issues forth, he is
furnished with his forms, <span id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_115) \[and
the diadems\] of <span class="smallcaps">Horus</span> are on his head;
king of the South and of the North, delight of the divine ennead, who
purifies <span class="smallcaps">On</span>, <span
id="fr_116"></span>[4](#fn_116)

3\. who reigns <span id="fr_117"></span>[5](#fn_117) in the abode of
<span class="smallcaps">Ptah</span>, offering the truth to <span
class="smallcaps">Tum</span>, presenting <span
id="fr_118"></span>[6](#fn_118) it to the master of the southern
wall, <span id="fr_119"></span>[7](#fn_119) making endowments of daily
offerings <span id="fr_120"></span>[8](#fn_120) to the god,
accomplishing all that \[now\] exists and seeking \[new\] honours for
the gods of the South and of the North, constructing their temples of
white stone and confirming all their substance, <span
id="fr_121"></span>[9](#fn_121) legitimate <span
id="fr_122"></span>[10](#fn_122) son of <span
class="smallcaps">Tum</span>, Thothmos Khakeu, like unto <span
class="smallcaps">Ra</span>;

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

4\. heir of <span class="smallcaps">Horus</span>, <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123) master of his throne, Men-khopiru-ri,
who gives life. Now, when his Majesty was a child, <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124) in the character of <span
class="smallcaps">Horus</span> in <span
class="smallcaps">Kheb</span>, <span id="fr_125"></span>[3](#fn_125) his
beauty \[was\] like that of \[the god\] who avenges his father (<span
class="smallcaps">Osiris</span>); it was regarded like that of the god
himself; the soldiers raised shouts of joy because of him, the Royal
sons and all the nobles submitting themselves to his valour <span
id="fr_126"></span>[4](#fn_126) because of his exploits;

5\. for he has renewed the circle of his victories, even as the son of
<span class="smallcaps">Nut</span>. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[5](#fn_127) At that time he hunted <span
id="fr_128"></span>[6](#fn_128) on the mountains of the Memphite nome,
taking his pleasure, <span id="fr_129"></span>[7](#fn_129) along the
roads of the South and of the North, <span
id="fr_130"></span>[8](#fn_130) shooting at the target <span
id="fr_131"></span>[9](#fn_131) with darts <span
id="fr_132"></span>[10](#fn_132) of bronze, chasing the lions and the
gazelles of the desert, advancing on his chariot with horses swifter

6\. than the wind, together with only one of his servants, <span
id="fr_133"></span>[11](#fn_133)" without being recognised by any one.
Then came his time for allowing repose to his servants, at the

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

*sopet* <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134) of <span
class="smallcaps">Harmakhis</span> and <span
id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_135) of <span
class="smallcaps">Sokaris</span> In the necropolis, of <span
class="smallcaps">Rannuti</span> <span id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_136)
with the male and female deities, <span id="fr_137"></span>[4](#fn_137)
of the mother who engenders the gods of the North, <span
id="fr_138"></span>[5](#fn_138) the mistress of the wall of the South,

7\. <span class="smallcaps">Sekhet</span> who reigns in <span
class="smallcaps">Xois</span> and in the domain of <span
class="smallcaps">Set</span> the great magician; <span
id="fr_139"></span>[6](#fn_139)—that sacred place of the creation, <span
id="fr_140"></span>[7](#fn_140) \[which goes back\] to the days <span
id="fr_141"></span>[8](#fn_141) of the masters of <span
class="smallcaps">Kher</span>, <span id="fr_142"></span>[9](#fn_142) the
sacred path of the gods towards the western horizon of <span
class="smallcaps">On</span>; for the sphinx of <span
class="smallcaps">Khopri</span>, the very mighty, resides in this place,
the greatest of the spirits, the most august of those who are venerated,
when the shadow rests upon him. <span id="fr_143"></span>[10](#fn_143)

The temples of <span class="smallcaps">Memphis</span> and of all the
districts which are on both sides \[advance\] towards him, with the two
arms extended to adore his face,

8\. with magnificent offerings for his double (*ka*). On one of these
days, the royal son, Thothmos, being arrived, while walking at midday
and seating himself under the shadow of this mighty god, was overcome by
slumber and slept <span id="fr_144"></span>[11](#fn_144) at the very
moment when <span class="smallcaps">Ra</span> is at the summit (of
heaven).

9\. He found that the Majesty of this august god spoke to

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

him with his own mouth, as a father speaks to his son, saying: Look upon
me, contemplate me, O my son Thothmos; I am thy father, <span
class="smallcaps">Harmakhis-Khopri-Ra-Tum</span>; I bestow upon thee the
sovereignty

10\. over my domain, the supremacy <span id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145)
over the living; thou shalt wear its white crown and its red crown <span
id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_146) on the throne of <span
class="smallcaps">Seb</span> the hereditary chief. <span
id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_147) May the earth be thine in all its length
and breadth; may the splendour of the universal master illumine (thee);
may there come unto thee the abundance <span
id="fr_148"></span>[4](#fn_148) that is in the double land, the riches
brought from every country and the long duration of years. Thine is my
face, thine is my heart; thy heart is mine. <span
id="fr_149"></span>[5](#fn_149)

11\. Behold my actual condition that thou mayest protect all my perfect
limbs. <span id="fr_150"></span>[6](#fn_150) The sand of the desert
whereon I am laid has covered me. Save me, <span
id="fr_151"></span>[7](#fn_151) causing all that is in my heart <span
id="fr_152"></span>[8](#fn_152) to be executed. For I know that thou art
my son, my avenger … *approach* (?), behold I am with thee. I am \[thy
father\] …

12\. … Afterwards \[the prince awakened\]; he understood the word of
this god and kept silence in his heart … The temples of the district
consecrate offerings to this god <span id="fr_153"></span>[9](#fn_153) …

13\. … Khafri, <span id="fr_154"></span>[10](#fn_154) image made for
<span class="smallcaps">Tum-Harmakhis</span> …

14\. … at the festivals …

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_113"></span>[53:1](rp20211.htm#fr_113) That is, of the
barbarians.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[53:2](rp20211.htm#fr_114) *Ur sep*, properly,
"he whose vicissitudes are great."

<span id="fn_115"></span>[53:3](rp20211.htm#fr_115) This word appears
only in Young, *Hieroglyphics*, pl. 80.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[53:4](rp20211.htm#fr_116) Or "restores On"
(Heliopolis).

<span id="fn_117"></span>[53:5](rp20211.htm#fr_117) Literally, "who
wields the sceptre of the abode of <span class="smallcaps">Ptah</span>,"
*i.e.* Memphis.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[53:6](rp20211.htm#fr_118) Literally, "making
it ascend (to the nostrils) of the god," as so often depicted on the
monuments.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[53:7](rp20211.htm#fr_119) Ptah. The southern
wall was the part of Memphis where the temple of the god stood.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[53:8](rp20211.htm#fr_120) *Ameni-t-u*.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[53:9](rp20211.htm#fr_121) Or "their
existences,'' *pat-u*.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[53:10](rp20211.htm#fr_122) Literally "of his
loins."

<span id="fn_123"></span>[54:1](rp20211.htm#fr_123) Or "flesh of Horus."

<span id="fn_124"></span>[54:2](rp20211.htm#fr_124) *Anup*, with the
determinative of "infant," is used in the sense of "child," "youth,"
especially when reference is made to the royal family. See Brugsch,
*Dict*. p. 92. Here the word signifies "hereditary prince."

<span id="fn_125"></span>[54:3](rp20211.htm#fr_125) *I.e.* in the north
of Egypt, where Horus had passed his early years under the charge of his
mother Isis. The young prince is likened to Horus.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[54:4](rp20211.htm#fr_126) Literally, "being
under his double solar power" (of North and South).

<span id="fn_127"></span>[54:5](rp20211.htm#fr_127) Here the god Set.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[54:6](rp20211.htm#fr_128) The word *sam*,
which is without a determinative, may not signify "to hunt" here.
Brugsch (*Zeitschrift*, 1876, p. 93) thinks that the *sokheti-u* (or
perhaps *sam-ti-u*), sometimes represented as holding a lance, were
warriors or huntsmen. They were more probably shepherds, who when
leading their flocks to the "fields" (*sokhet*, *sam*) were armed in
order to defend their flocks and themselves.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[54:7](rp20211.htm#fr_129) Literally,
"rejoicing his face."

<span id="fn_130"></span>[54:8](rp20211.htm#fr_130) Going from south to
north.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[54:9](rp20211.htm#fr_131) *Heb*, with the
determinative of a piece of wood on a base and transfixed by featherless
arrows.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[54:10](rp20211.htm#fr_132) *Khomt* means
merely objects of bronze. If the determinative of *heb* is exactly
represented in the copy the objects would be darts.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[54:11](rp20211.htm#fr_133) *Uā*, "one," is
repeated twice in the copies and hitherto the translation has been "one
and one," *i.e.* "two." I know no other example of such an expression,
however, and believe the second *uâ* to be the result of error. No doubt
in the next sentence the servants are spoken of in the plural
(*shes-u*), but the prince was evidently followed by an escort. Here
reference is made only to his companion in the chariot.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[55:1](rp20211.htm#fr_134) *Sopt* has hitherto
been rendered "to make offerings," but the word which has no
determinative, denotes, I believe, a locality consecrated to the gods in
question. Here perhaps it signifies a quarry or trench running, as is
afterwards stated, in the direction of Heliopolis.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[55:2](rp20211.htm#fr_135) Literally, "by the
side of."

<span id="fn_136"></span>[55:3](rp20211.htm#fr_136) The divine nurse.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[55:4](rp20211.htm#fr_137) This sense of the
words has been suggested by Prof. Maspero.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[55:5](rp20211.htm#fr_138) Young's copy here
contains more characters than that of Lepsius.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[55:6](rp20211.htm#fr_139) The names of the
divinities honoured in the locality mentioned seem to me to be inserted
in order to determine the place with more precision; perhaps reference
is made to the gorge which leads to the Sphinx. The sentence is
continued, not by *heka-ur* but by *as-t zeser ten*, in apposition to
what precedes. *Ur-u* appears to be in the plural and thus to refer to
Sekhet and Set.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[55:7](rp20211.htm#fr_140) Literally, "of the
first time," an expression generally used of the creation.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[55:8](rp20211.htm#fr_141) Or perhaps, "which
extends to the domains of the masters of Kher."

<span id="fn_142"></span>[55:9](rp20211.htm#fr_142) An old name of the
Egyptian Babylon, now Old Cairo. The road mentioned here appears to be
different from that followed by Piankhi when going from Memphis to
Babylon.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[55:10](rp20211.htm#fr_143) Literally, "the
time when the shadow rests upon him."

<span id="fn_144"></span>[55:11](rp20211.htm#fr_144) Or "a dream which
sleep produces took him."

<span id="fn_145"></span>[56:1](rp20211.htm#fr_145) The last words are
found only in Young's copy.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[56:2](rp20211.htm#fr_146) The crowns of Upper
and Lower Egypt. The feminine pronoun is suffixed to the words.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[56:3](rp20211.htm#fr_147) Common title of Seb,
indicating the antiquity of his cult. The title (*erpa*) dates from a
period when as yet there was no *suten* or "king," and recalls an age of
primitive feudalism. Amon, who became the supreme deity in the time of
the Theban dynasties, is *suten* or "king" of the gods, as first pointed
out by Professor Maspero.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[56:4](rp20211.htm#fr_148) Literally,
"provisions."

<span id="fn_149"></span>[56:5](rp20211.htm#fr_149) The two copies
differ here; I supply *ab* ("heart") before *k-n-a*.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[56:6](rp20211.htm#fr_150) Restored from
Young's copy: "behold for thee my destiny, as being in protection of my
limbs."

<span id="fn_151"></span>[56:7](rp20211.htm#fr_151) Literally, "heal
me."

<span id="fn_152"></span>[56:8](rp20211.htm#fr_152) That is, what my
heart desires.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[56:9](rp20211.htm#fr_153) Brugsch
conjecturally restores the passage thus: "\[Without thinking of freeing
from sand the work of king\] Khafra, the image he had made for the god
Tum-Harmakhis." If we consider the Sphinx as really older than Khafri,
the latter part of the proposed translation must be abandoned.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[56:10](rp20211.htm#fr_154) Khephren of the
fourth dynasty.
