<span class="smallcaps">Number 3</span>

The third text which I give is a translation of a very interesting
letter or proclamation, apparently written by Assur-bani-apli, or
Assurbanipal, to the Babylonians, whilst they were subject to Assyria.
After the usual royal greeting, the king speaks of

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

some rumour which had reached him, anent certain seditious words uttered
by a man whom he does not name, but whom he speaks of as "the wind"
(*sâru*), and farther on as "the lord of slander" (*bel-dababi*). <span
id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_532.md) Apparently the Assyrian king wished it
to be thought that he considered this man's exhortations as simply
"vain, empty words," and the man himself as beneath his notice; but the
letter itself indicates that he really thought both the man and his
message to be of sufficient importance to counteract if he could. He
therefore exhorts the Babylonians, in fairly vigorous terms, to pay no
attention to "the lord of slander," and he warns them that they are
responsible for the payment of the tribute due to Assyria, which they
seemed inclined to pervert to the use of the enemy of the Assyrian king,
or at least to raise as much for his use until they could, with his
help, throw off the Assyrian yoke. Hence the king's anger, and his
impatience for a reply to his exhortation. The text is made the more
interesting by the fact that it not only gives the name of the eponym
during whose term of office it was written, but the name of the person
by whom it was sent as well. The number of the text is K 84.

<span class="smallcaps">Translation</span>

The will of the king to the <span
class="smallcaps">Babylonians</span>.—Peace from me to your heart; may
there be good to you. The words

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

which the wind for the third time now has spoken to you, all come (to
me). I have heard them. Ye cannot govern the wind. By the heart of <span
class="smallcaps">Assur</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Merodach</span>, my gods, I swear that all the evil
words, which it has spoken against me, I am treasuring up in my heart,
and I have spoken them with my mouth. But artful is he—he has been
artful. Thus the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Babylonians</span>
itself is indeed evil unto me, and I do not listen to it. Your
brotherhood, which is with the <span
class="smallcaps">Assyrians</span>, <span
id="fr_536"></span>[1](#fn_533.md) and your privileges, which I had
confirmed, I have established; more than that there is—ye are near to my
heart. <span id="fr_537"></span>[2](#fn_534.md) I command also, that ye
listen not to his sedition. Do not make your name, which is before
me, <span id="fr_538"></span>[3](#fn_535.md) and before all the world,
evil; and commit not, yourselves, a sin against God.

And the equivalence of the word, which ye are treasuring up in your
hearts, I know. It is this: "We will ignore the tax, it is turned into
our tribute." That is no tribute; it is not that ye have equalised to my
slanderer <span id="fr_539"></span>[4](#fn_536.md) the matter <span
id="fr_540"></span>[5](#fn_537.md) of "corban and tax," it is that the
payment of tribute <span id="fr_541"></span>[6](#fn_538.md) lies with
yourselves, and failure <span id="fr_542"></span>[7](#fn_539.md) concerning
the agreement is before God. Therefore now I send to you, that by these
words ye may not join yourselves with him. Let me quickly see the answer
to my letter. The bond which I have made with <span
class="smallcaps">Bel</span>, the service of <span
class="smallcaps">Merodach</span>—this shall not be destroyed by my
hands.

Month Iyyar, 23d day, eponymy of Assur-dûra-utsur. Samas-baladh’su-iqbi
has brought it. <span id="fr_543"></span>[8](#fn_540.md)

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

There are several similar proclamations to this, but probably none of
them are in such a perfect state of preservation, though most of them
are more interesting, because they give more precise historical
indications by mentioning the names of the persons to whom they refer.

The text itself contains several interesting linguistic peculiarities.
In addition to the expressions already noted, the following may prove to
be of interest to the student: *raimani-su*, "his own," for
*ramani-su*—probably pointing to a peculiarity of pronunciation; <span
id="fr_544"></span>[1](#fn_541.md) *sun-kunu* for *sumkunu*, "your name"
(change of *m* into *n* before *k*—not uncommon in Assyrian);
*kutstsupakunu* for *kutstsupatunu*, "ye are treasuring up"—a most
important variant form; the interesting phrases *yânu sû kî* ... "it is
not that …", and *sû kî* ... "it is that ..."; and the use of the
demonstratives *âgâ* and *âganute*.

It is noteworthy, also, that in two passages the king speaks of God
(*Ilu*), not of "the gods" (*û raman-kunu, ina pan Ili la tukhadhdha*,
"and commit not, yourselves, a sin before God;" *u khadhdhu ina lib ade
ina pan Ili*, "and a sin concerning the agreement is before God"), as
if, at the time he was writing

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

these words, the One-God idea was uppermost in his mind. This was,
probably, the result of a feeling inherited from the time when
monotheism, more or less pure, was the possession of the Semitic race,
or at least that portion of it to which the Semitic Babylonians or
Assyrians and the Israelites belonged. <span
id="fr_545"></span>[1](#fn_542.md)

The text is published in the 4th vol. of the *Cuneiform Inscriptions of
Western Asia*, plate 52 of the old edition, plate 47 of the new. The
colophon, accompanied by a translation, was published by G. Smith in his
*History of Assurbanipal*, p. 181. The date of this interesting document
is about 650 B.C.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_532"></span>[186:1](rp20234.htm#fr_535.md) It is not unlikely
that this person was a certain Nabû-bel-sumāti, a descendant of
Merodach-baladan, who took part in a revolt against Assurbanipal. (See
Geo. Smith's *History of Assurbanipal*, pp. 200–204.)

<span id="fn_533"></span>[187:1](rp20234.htm#fr_536.md) Literally "The sons
of Assyria."

<span id="fn_534"></span>[187:2](rp20234.htm#fr_537) "Ye (are.md) with my
heart."

<span id="fn_535"></span>[187:3](rp20234.htm#fr_538.md) Literally "which
has been made before me."

<span id="fn_536"></span>[187:4](rp20234.htm#fr_539.md) Literally "lord of
slander."

<span id="fn_537"></span>[187:5](rp20234.htm#fr_540.md) Literally "name."

<span id="fn_538"></span>[187:6](rp20234.htm#fr_541.md) Literally "the
making of the tribute."

<span id="fn_539"></span>[187:7](rp20234.htm#fr_542.md) Or, "a sin."

<span id="fn_540"></span>[187:8](rp20234.htm#fr_543.md) The following is a
transcription of the original text: "Abat sarri ana Bâbîlaa. Salîmu aasi
libba-kunu; lû-dhâbu kunusi. Dibbi sa sâri salasis agâ idbubakkunusi,
gabbu ittibbûni alteme-sunu. Sâru la takipa-su. Ina lib Assur, Marduk,
ilania attama kî dibbi bi’sūte mala ina mukhkhîa idbubu, ina libbîa
kutstsupaku, û ina pîa aqbû. Alla niklu sû, ittikil umma sumu sa Bâbîlaa
raimani-su ittîa lu-bais, û anaku ul asimme-si. Akhut-kunu sa itti
mârāni mât Assur u kitinnuta-kunu, sa aktsuru, addi. Eli sa enna sû—itti

ina pan matāti gabbu banû, la tuba’asa, û ramankunu ina pan ili la

umma ennā: Assā nittekirus, ana bilti-ni itara. <span id="page_188">p.
188</span> Ul biltu sî. Yânu sû kî sumu kurbanū u assa itti bel-dababia
tatasizza; sû kî sakan bilte ina eli rameni-kunu u khadhdhû ina lib adê
ina pan ili. Enna adû altaprakkunusi, ki ina dibbi aganute itti-su
raman-kunu la tudanipa. Khandhis gabri sipirtîa lumur. Kitsru sa ana Bêl
aktsur, sikipti Marduk—agâ ina qata-ya la ikhibbil.

"Arkhu Aaru, umu esrâ-salsu, limmu Assur-dûra-utsur.
Samas-baladh’su-iqbi ittubil."

<span id="fn_541"></span>[188:1](rp20234.htm#fr_544.md) In other passages
of the text where the word occurs, it has the regular forms, *raman
kunu* and *rameni-kunu*, "yourselves." The latter is an oblique case
with vowel harmony.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[189:1](rp20234.htm#fr_545.md) This question,
which admits of a much fuller treatment and discussion than can be given
to it here, is intimately bound up with the original significance and
use of the divine names Jah and Jahveh (Jehovah).
