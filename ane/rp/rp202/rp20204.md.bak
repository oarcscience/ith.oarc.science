### INSCRIPTION OF UNI (OF THE SIXTH DYNASTY)

<span class="smallcaps">Translated by Prof. Maspero</span>

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> inscription adorned one of the walls
of the tomb which Uni had built for himself at Abydos in the central
part of the necropolis (Mariette: *Abydos*, vol. ii. p. 41; *Catalogue
Général*, p. 84, No. 522). It was discovered there by Mariette and
transferred to the Museum of Boulaq (Mariette: *Notice des principaux
Monuments*, 1864, pp. 286–287), where it now bears the number 886
(Maspero: *Guide du Visiteur*, pp. 209–211). E. de Rouge copied it there
in 1865 and made an analysis of it, intermingled with translations,
which he published in his *Recherches sur les Monuments* (pp. 117–128,
135–149, pl. vii., viii.) His work served as a starting-point for the
complete translations of Birch ("Inscription of Una," in the *Records of
the Past*, prior series, ii. pp. 1–8), and the partial translations of
Maspero (*Histoire ancienne des Peuples de l’ Orient*, 1875, pp. 88–92;
1886, pp. 81–85) and of Brugsch (*Geschichte Aegyptens*, pp. 95–102).
The text has been published a second time, but somewhat

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

incorrectly, by Mariette (*Abydos*, vol. ii. pp. 4449); it has again
been edited, with the corrections of Brugsch and Golenischeff, by Erman
(*Commentar zur Inschrift des Una* in Lepsius’s *Zeitschrift*, 1882, pp.
1–29), together with a translation and a grammatical commentary, some
points in which have been slightly modified by Erman in his work on
Egypt (*Aegypten*, pp. 688–690, *et passim*). Brugsch has devoted one of
the most interesting of his memoirs to the study of the names of the
Nubian populations contained in our inscription (*Die Negerstämme der
Una-Inschrift* in the *Zeitschrift*, 1882, pp. 30–36).

The inscription consists of 52 lines, of which the first alone is
horizontal and runs along the summit of the wall like a sort of general
title. On the right side it has suffered a little, and the lines at the
beginning have lost almost all the characters at the top and the bottom
of them; but only two or three of these *lacunæ* are impossible to fill
up, and interrupt the sense. Everywhere else, the expression is clear,
easy to comprehend, and the difficulties which it offers to the
interpreter result only from our present ignorance of the exact
signification of certain terms peculiar to architecture, navigation, and
the military art at the remote epoch to which the inscription belongs.
The portions of the text which have been restored are enclosed between
brackets.

The stele which was found with this inscription is in the Museum of
Boulaq at Cairo, and has the form of a false door: it is evidently the
same which

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

was given to Uni by king Merirî Pepi, as stated in the inscription.
Mariette has given a description of the stele in his *Catalogue Général
des Monuments d’ Abydo*s (p. 90, No. 529; cfer. J. and E. de Rougé:
*Inscriptions*, vol. i. pl. II.). The tomb of Auu, the father of Uni,
has been discovered at Abydos (E. de Rougé: *Recherches sur les
Monuments*, p. 144, note 1). Uni died before Mirinirî, who is the last
king mentioned in his biography; if, as I have conjectured, he was born
in the reign of Unas, his age could not have exceeded sixty years.
