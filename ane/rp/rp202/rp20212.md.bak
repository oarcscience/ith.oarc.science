### TABLETS OF TEL EL-AMARNA RELATING TO PALESTINE IN THE CENTURY BEFORE THE EXODUS

<span class="smallcaps">Translated by the Editor</span>

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the winter of 1887 a very remarkable
discovery was made among the mounds of Tel el-Amarna in Upper Egypt. Tel
el-Amarna lies on the eastern bank of the Nile about midway between
Minieh and Siout, and its extensive ruins cover the site of the capital
of Amenôphis IV, or Khu-en-Aten, the so-called "Heretic King" of the
eighteenth Egyptian dynasty. Khu-en-Aten was the son of Amenôphis III by
a Syrian princess Teie, who, as we now know was the daughter of
Duisratta, the king of Mitanni or Nahrina, the Aram Naharaim of
Scripture (Judges iii. 8), a Mesopotamian district which lay opposite to
the Hittite city of Carchemish. Like his father, Khu-en-Aten surrounded
himself with Semitic officers and courtiers, and after his accession to
the throne publicly professed himself a convert to the religion of his
mother, which consisted in the adoration of the winged solar disk,
called Aten in Egyptian. His rejection of the faith of his fathers soon
brought

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

about a rupture with the powerful priesthood of Thebes, and Khu-en-Aten
eventually left his ancestral capital and built himself and his
followers a new capital further north, the site of which is now known as
Tel el-Amarna. Here in the neighbouring cliffs and desert are found the
tombs of the adherents of the new Egyptian creed, and here Khu-en-Aten
reigned and died. He was succeeded by one or two converts to the foreign
religion; but their reigns were brief, and after a short while the
Pharaoh returned to the worship of the Egyptian gods, the new capital of
Khu-en-Aten was deserted, and the foreign faith suppressed.

On his departure from Thebes, Khu-en-Aten had carried with him the
archives of the kingdom, and it is a portion of these that the
*fellahin* discovered in 1887 among the foundations of the royal palace.
They consist of clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform writing of the
Babylonian type and in the Babylonian language. The tablets are copies
of letters and despatches from the kings and governors of Babylonia and
Assyria, of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Eastern Kappadokia, of Phœnicia and
Palestine, and they prove that all over the civilised East, in the
century before the Exodus, active literary intercourse was carried on
through the medium of a common literary language—that of Babylonia, and
the complicated Babylonian script. It is evident, therefore, that
throughout Western Asia schools and libraries must have existed, in
which clay tablets inscribed with

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

cuneiform characters were stored up, and where the language and
syllabary of Babylonia were taught and learned. Such a library must have
existed in the Canaanite city of Kirjath-Sepher or "Book-town" (Judges
i. 11), and if its site can ever be recovered and excavated we may
expect to find there its collection of books written upon imperishable
clay.

Among the correspondents of the Egyptian sovereigns were Assur-yuballidh
of Assyria and Burna-buryas of Babylonia, which thus fix the date of
Khu-en-Aten to about 1430 B.C. Palestine and Phœnicia were garrisoned at
the time by Egyptian troops, and there were as yet no traces of the
Israelite in the land. But the Canaanitish population was already
threatened by an enemy from the north. These were the Hittites, to whom
references are made in several of the despatches from Syria and
Phœnicia. After the weakening of the Egyptian power in consequence of
the religious troubles which followed the death of Khu-en-Aten, the
Hittites were enabled to complete their conquests in the south and to
drive a wedge between the Semites of the East and the West. With the
revival of the Egyptian empire under the rulers of the nineteenth
dynasty the southward course of Hittite conquest was checked, but the
wars of Ramses II against the Hittites of Kadesh on the Orontes
desolated and exhausted Canaan and prepared the way for the Israelitish
invasion.

Two facts of special interest to the Biblical student

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

result from the discovery of the tablets of Tel el-Amarna. In the first
place, as has been seen, the date of the Exodus has been approximately
determined; at all events, the Egyptologists have been shown to be right
in not assigning it to an earlier period than B.C. 1320, that is to say,
the reign of Meneptah the son and successor of Ramses II. In the second
place, light is thrown upon the statement of Exodus (i. 8) that the
Pharaoh of the oppression was "a new king which knew not Joseph." We
learn from the tablets that Khu-en-Aten was not only half Semitic in
descent and wholly Semitic in faith, he also surrounded himself with
officers and courtiers of Phœnician or Canaanitish extraction. The
Vizier himself, who stood next to the monarch, and like him is addressed
as "lord," bore the name of Dûdu, the Dodo and David of the Old
Testament, which belonged specifically to the land of Canaan. Most of
the Egyptian governors and lieutenants from whom the king received his
despatches had similarly Semitic names, and it is clear that not only
were Semitic culture and religion dominant in Egypt, but most of the
offices of state were in Semitic hands. The rise of the nineteenth
dynasty under Ramses I. marked the reaction against Semitic influence,
and brought with it the expulsion of the foreigner. Thebes became once
more the capital of the kingdom, and the Egyptian priesthood and
aristocracy took their revenge upon the hated stranger. Had the
insurrection of Arabi been successful, the Europeans would

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

have fared in our day as the Semites fared in the days of Ramses.

The translations which follow are those of tablets which I have copied
at Cairo. I have selected for the most part the despatches which were
sent from Southern Palestine. The originals are all preserved in the
Museum of Boulaq, with the exception of No. III, which was in the
possession of M. Urbain Bouriant, the director of the French
Archæological School in Cairo, at the time I copied it. Transliterations
of the texts, with notes, will appear in a paper of mine on "The tablets
of Tel el-Amarna now in Egypt"; a general account of the tablets at
Boulaq and in Berlin will be found in Dr. Hugo Winckler's *Bericht ueber
die Thontafeln von Tell-el-Amarna*, in the *Sitzungsberichte der
königlich preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin*, No. 51,
December 1888.

It may be added that Amenôphis III and his son Amenôphis IV Khu-en-Aten
are addressed in the tablets by their *prænomina*, Nimmuriya and
Nimutriya corresponding to the name read Mâ-nib-rî by Professor Maspero,
Napkhurururiya to Nofir-khopiru-rî. Napkhurururiya is also found
abbreviated into Khuri(ya), which explains why in the Greek lists Oros
occupies the place of Khu-en-Aten.
