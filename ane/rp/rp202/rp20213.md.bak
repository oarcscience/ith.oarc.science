### Footnotes

<span id="fn_155"></span>[62:1](rp20213.htm#fr_155.md) No. XI in my
forthcoming paper on the tablets of Tel el-Amarna.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[62:2](rp20213.htm#fr_156.md) This is a curious
parallelism to the use of the plural *Elohim* in Hebrew for the singular
"God."

<span id="fn_157"></span>[62:3](rp20213.htm#fr_157.md) The Egyptian Pharaoh
was not only "the son of the Sun," but was also identified with the
Sun-god himself.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[62:4](rp20213.htm#fr_158.md) *Ki dhema atma*.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[62:5](rp20213.htm#fr_159.md) Su-arda-ka is a
purely Assyro-Babylonian name, and shows how far the cultivated classes
of Western Asia had gone in adopting the Babylonian language.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[62:6](rp20213.htm#fr_160.md) The Hebrew Keilah
(Josh. xv. 44, I Sam. xxiii.), now Kilâ.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[62:7](rp20213.htm#fr_161.md) Abd-Dhabba, which
may, however, also be read Abd-Khima. Compare the names of Tab-Rimmon (1
Kings, xv. 18), and Tab-el (Is. vii. 6).

<span id="fn_162"></span>[63:1](rp20213.htm#fr_162.md) Written
ideographically EN-MU, in Assyrian Bil-nadin.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[63:2](rp20213.htm#fr_163.md) Written with the
ideograph of "ass" *emer*, Heb. *khamôr*. There is a similar play upon
the name of the Amorite in the Old Testament, Gen. xxxiv. 2, etc.
compared with xlviii. 22.
