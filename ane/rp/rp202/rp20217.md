1\. \[To\] the great \[king\], the king of the world, the king \[of
<span class="smallcaps">Egypt</span>\],  
2. I present myself, O creator of everything which (is) great,  
3. (I) the servant of the mighty lord, to the king  
4. my \[lord\]; at the feet of my lord, the Sun-god,  
5. seven times seven I prostrate myself. Verily is  
6. the king my lord. Lo, exceedingly powerful  
7. is he constituted. Lo, a mouth of judgment <span
id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_185.md) in  
8. thy presence exists. The men  
9. of the city of <span class="smallcaps">Tsumura</span> <span
id="fr_186"></span>[3](#fn_186) belonging to the king (are.md) subjects  
10. of the king. Lo, the city of <span class="smallcaps">Zarak</span>
(sends) this report:  
11. The four sons of Abd-Asi\[rti\] <span
id="fr_187"></span>[4](#fn_187.md) have been captured,

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

12\. and there is no one who has brought the news  
13. to the king, as well as counsel. Behold  
14. the servant of thy justice (am) I, and as for thee  
15. what I have heard I have despatched to my lord.  
16. A march has been made <span id="fr_188"></span>[1](#fn_188.md) against
the city of <span class="smallcaps">Tsumu\[ra\]</span>  
17. which like a bird whose nest on a precipice  
18. is laid …  
19. is exceedingly strong.  
20. And as for the messengers whom  
21. from the house of …  
22. I sent, into the city of <span class="smallcaps">Tsumura</span>  
23. I have seen their entrance.  
24. And Ya\[pa\]-Addu the *wares* (?) <span
id="fr_189"></span>[2](#fn_189.md)  
25. did not place with me.  
26. They took also the men of …  
27. his cavalry, and the stone  
28. of my justice, … and  
29. the divine image, the sceptres (and) the stone of sovereignty,  
30. the god of the oracles of the king; <span
id="fr_190"></span>[3](#fn_190.md) and  
31. the king spoke to them.  
32. And thou didst … the (seats) thou hast selected (?) <span
id="fr_191"></span>[4](#fn_191.md)  
33. as many as the king created for them.  
34. And the son of the servant of the lord and the wife of the father

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

35\. (even) of the god of heaven and earth, the king, have spoken to the
men.  
36. (I have collected?) all my servants;  
37. …… his … to …  
38. …… he went up …  
39. …… before me, and …  
40. *This line has been destroyed*.  
41. (Near) me there was no one at all  
42. of them, whether two or three  
43 and the god <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_192.md) heard  
44. the words of the servant of his justice, and the god  
45. brought life to his servant;  
46. and the action of his servant he enquired after a second time, <span
id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_193.md)  
47. which may he requite (?) unto me, and may the great lady  
48. who (is) with thee, and the female domestics of the palace. Verily
Aziru and  
49. Yapa-Addu have taken up opposition  
50. towards me, and have not marched up (the country)  
51. any one (of them.) They held a conference  
52. with me. That place of observation  
53. belonging to me, which my father gave nee,  
54. even the king, for ever, \[implies\]  
55. the making of words on the part of me the servant of \[thy\]
justice.  
56. And I rejoiced also within myself at  
57. these words (which) I have uttered, even I  
58. the dust of thy feet, O king!  
59. O father, thy father is not Aziru;  
60. he has not girdled <span id="fr_194"></span>[3](#fn_194.md) the world  
61. with his governors and his prophesying <span
id="fr_195"></span>[4](#fn_195.md) \[and\]  
62. \[his\] god and goddesses and the god Ku …  
63. \[It is\] the work of his servant, and …  
64. to *defend* (?) the house of thy father  
65. against the country of <span class="smallcaps">Tarkumiya</span>
marched

66\. the sons of Abd-Asirta, and  
67. there took the country of the king belonging to them  
68. the king of the country of <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_184"></span>[67:1](rp20217.htm#fr_184.md) No. XIV in my
forthcoming Paper.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[67:2](rp20217.htm#fr_185.md) *Maspudh*, the Heb.
*mishpâdh*.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[67:3](rp20217.htm#fr_186.md) The Simyra of
classical writers, the Biblical Zemar (Gen. x. 18), at the foot of
Lebanon in Phœnicia.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[67:4](rp20217.htm#fr_187.md) Abd-Asirti or
Abd-Asirta is also called Abd-Asrâti, and according to Dr. Winckler, in
one of the Tel el-Amarna tablets, now at Berlin, the word Asrâti is
preceded by the determinative of divinity. *Asrâti* is the <span
id="page_68">p. 68</span> plural of *Asirti*, which the cuneiform
"syllabaries" explain by the words "high place," "oracle," and
"sanctuary." It is the *ashêrah* of the Old Testament, mistranslated
"grove" in the Authorised Version. The Ashêrah was properly the upright
post often seen upon Assyrian gems which symbolised the goddess of
fertility. The latter bore the name of Ashêrah, like her symbol, among
the Southern Canaanites, and corresponded to the Ashtoreth or Astartê of
Phœnicia. Abd-Asirti would signify "the servant of Ashêrah."

<span id="fn_188"></span>[68:1](rp20217.htm#fr_188.md) Or "counsel has been
taken," the Assyrian *milik* signifying both "march" and "counsel."

<span id="fn_189"></span>[68:2](rp20217.htm#fr_189.md) *Kinanatu*, "female
slaves" in Assyrian, but here perhaps (like the Hebrew *Chenaanî*, "a
merchant") derived from the name of Canaan.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[68:3](rp20217.htm#fr_190.md) Compare the Hebrew
Urim and Thummim in the breastplate of the High Priest.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[68:4](rp20217.htm#fr_191.md) The reading and
translation of this line are extremely doubtful.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[69:1](rp20217.htm#fr_192.md) That is, the
Egyptian monarch.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[69:2](rp20217.htm#fr_193.md) Such seems to be the
meaning of the expression *istu sani*.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[69:3](rp20217.htm#fr_194.md) *Igur*.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[69:4](rp20217.htm#fr_195.md) *Sipti*.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[70:1](rp20217.htm#fr_196.md) Mitana or Mitanni
lay on the eastern bank of the Euphrates north of the Belikh according
to the annals of Tiglath-pileser I. A docket attached to one of the Tel
el-Amarna tablets identifies it with the Egyptian Nahrina, the
Aram-Naharaim of the Old Testament of which Chushan-rish-athaim was king
(Judges iii. 8). What is meant by the suffix *nanu* I cannot explain.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[70:2](rp20217.htm#fr_197.md) *Khata*.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[70:3](rp20217.htm#fr_198.md) Yarimuta is
described in another tablet as situated upon the sea, to the north of
Phœnicia.
