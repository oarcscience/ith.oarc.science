### Footnotes

<span id="fn_164"></span>[63:3](rp20214.htm#fr_164.md) No. X in my
forthcoming Paper.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[63:4](rp20214.htm#fr_165.md) The traces of the
last character composing the name of the city seem to show that it was
*gar*.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[63:5](rp20214.htm#fr_166.md) *Khazati*-ki.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[64:1](rp20214.htm#fr_167.md) This seems to be the
meaning of the words *Gin-ti-Ki-ir-mi-il-a-ki*. But the first *ki* may
be the determinative affix of locality, in which case we should have to
read Gath-Irmila. The difficulty here is the strange name Irmila. It
may, however, be compared with that of Jarmuth, now Yarmût (Josh. x. 3,
etc.)

<span id="fn_168"></span>[64:2](rp20214.htm#fr_168.md) *Amili Khabiri*. The
Khabiri or "confederates" are spoken of in the tablet next translated
(line 13), where they are described as bordering upon Rabbah and Keilah.
The word occurs in K 890, lines 4 and 8, in the sense of "companions"
(*istu pan khabiri-ya iptar’sanni*, "from the face of my companions he
has separated me"). Its use in these despatches as the name of a body of
men who possessed territory in the south of Palestine is very
interesting, as it throws light on the origin of the name of Hebron, and
explains why the name is not met with in the Egyptian lists of the
Palestinian cities. *Khebron* (Hebron), in fact, denoted the
"Confederacy" of tribes who met at the great sanctuary of Kirjath-Arba,
the termination (-*ôn*) being that which, as in Jeshurun or Zebulon or
Simeon, distinguished territorial names. In the list of Palestinian
cities given by Thothmes III at Karnak the place of Hebron seems to be
taken by Yaâqab-el, "Jacob is El" or "god."

<span id="fn_169"></span>[64:3](rp20214.htm#fr_169.md) "Moloch is Ar’il."
Ar’il is the Arêl or "hero" of the Moabite Stone of the Old Testament
(Isaiah xxxiii. 7) which appears as Ariel in 2 Sam. xxiii. 20, and
Isaiah xxix. 1, 2, who applies the term to Jerusalem. Like the writer of
the despatch, Isaiah considered the word to be a compound of *êl* or
*il*, "God."

<span id="fn_170"></span>[64:4](rp20214.htm#fr_170.md) *Qarti*-ki. The
Kirjath meant is probably either Kirjath-Arba (Hebron) or
Kirjath-Sepher. But it may be Kirjath-Baal (Josh. xv. 60).

<span id="fn_171"></span>[64:5](rp20214.htm#fr_171.md) Written Ururusi in
the next despatch (line 25). I cannot identify the town.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[64:6](rp20214.htm#fr_172.md) *Khapi*.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[65:1](rp20214.htm#fr_173.md) *Mitsri*-ki.
