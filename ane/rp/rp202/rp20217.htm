<P><A NAME="fn_185"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_185">67:2</A> <i>Maspudh</i>, the Heb. <i>mishp&acirc;dh</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_186"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_186">67:3</A> The Simyra of classical writers, the Biblical Zemar (Gen. x. 18), at the foot of Lebanon in Ph&#339;nicia.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_187"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_187">67:4</A> Abd-Asirti or Abd-Asirta is also called Abd-Asr&acirc;ti, and according to Dr. Winckler, in one of the Tel el-Amarna tablets, now at Berlin, the word Asr&acirc;ti is preceded by the determinative of divinity. <i>Asr&acirc;ti</i> is the <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></A> plural of <i>Asirti</i>, which the cuneiform "syllabaries" explain by the words "high place," "oracle," and "sanctuary." It is the <i>ash&ecirc;rah</i> of the Old Testament, mistranslated "grove" in the Authorised Version. The Ash&ecirc;rah was properly the upright post often seen upon Assyrian gems which symbolised the goddess of fertility. The latter bore the name of Ash&ecirc;rah, like her symbol, among the Southern Canaanites, and corresponded to the Ashtoreth or Astart&ecirc; of Ph&#339;nicia. Abd-Asirti would signify "the servant of Ash&ecirc;rah."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_188"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_188">68:1</A> Or "counsel has been taken," the Assyrian <i>milik</i> signifying both "march" and "counsel."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_189"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_189">68:2</A> <i>Kinanatu</i>, "female slaves" in Assyrian, but here perhaps (like the Hebrew <i>Chenaan&icirc;</i>, "a merchant") derived from the name of Canaan.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_190"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_190">68:3</A> Compare the Hebrew Urim and Thummim in the breastplate of the High Priest.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_191"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_191">68:4</A> The reading and translation of this line are extremely doubtful.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_192"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_192">69:1</A> That is, the Egyptian monarch.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_193"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_193">69:2</A> Such seems to be the meaning of the expression <i>istu sani</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_194"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_194">69:3</A> <i>Igur</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_195"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_195">69:4</A> <i>Sipti</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_196"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_196">70:1</A> Mitana or Mitanni lay on the eastern bank of the Euphrates north of the Belikh according to the annals of Tiglath-pileser I. A docket attached to one of the Tel el-Amarna tablets identifies it with the Egyptian Nahrina, the Aram-Naharaim of the Old Testament of which Chushan-rish-athaim was king (Judges iii. 8). What is meant by the suffix <i>nanu</i> I cannot explain.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_197"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_197">70:2</A> <i>Khata</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_198"></A><A HREF="rp20217.htm#fr_198">70:3</A> Yarimuta is described in another tablet as situated upon the sea, to the north of Ph&#339;nicia.</P>
