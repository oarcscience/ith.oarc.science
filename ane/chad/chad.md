# The Chaldean Account of the Deluge

## by George Smith

#### Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology 2 \[1873\] 213-34.

A short time back I discovered among the Assyrian tablets in the British
Museum, an account of the flood; which, under the advice of our
President, I now bring before the Society.

For convenience of working, I had divided the collection of Assyrian
tablets in the British Museum into sections, according to the subject
matter of the inscriptions.

I have recently been examining the division comprising the Mythological
and Mythical tablets, and from this section I obtained a number of
tablets, giving a curious series of legends and including a copy of the
story of the Flood. On discovering these documents, which were much
mutilated, I searched over all the collections of fragments of
inscriptions, consisting of several thousands of smaller pieces, and
ultimately recovered 80 fragments of these legends; by the aid of which
I was enabled to restore nearly all the text of the description of the
Flood, and considerable portions of the other legends. These tablets
were originally at least twelve in number, forming one story or set of
legends, the account of the Flood being on the eleventh tablet.

Of the inscription describing the Flood, there are fragments of three
copies containing the same texts; these copies belong to the time of
Assurbanipal, or about 660 years before the Christian era, and they were
found in the library of that monarch in the palace at Nineveh. The
original text, according to the statements on the tablets, must have
belonged to the city of Erech, and it appears to have been either
written in, or translated into the Semitic Babylonian, at a very early
period. The date when this document was first written or translated is
at present very difficult to decide, but the following are some of the
evidences of its antiquity:

1st. The three Assyrian copies present a number of variant readings,
which had crept into the text since the original documents were written.

2nd. The forms of the characters in the original documents were of an
ancient type, and the Assyrian copyist did not always know their modern
representatives, so he has left some of them in their original hieratic
form.

3rd. There are a number of sentences which were originally glosses
explanatory of the subjects; before the Assyrian copies were made these
glosses had been already incorporated in the text and their original use
lost.

It must here be noted that the Assyrian scribe has recorded for us the
divisions of the lines on the original documents.

On examining the composition of the text, some marked peculiarities are
apparent, which likewise show its high antiquity. one of these is the
constant use of the personal pronoun nominative. In later times this was
usually indicated by the verbal form, but not expressed. On comparing
the Deluge text with dated texts from the time of Sargon I, it appears
to be older than these, and its original composition cannot be placed
later than the seventeenth century before the Christian era; while it
may be much older. The text itself professes to belong to the time of a
monarch whose name, written in monograms, I am unable to read
phonetically; I therefore provisionally call him by the ordinary values
of the signs of his name, Izdubar.

Izdubar, from the description of his reign, evidently belonged to the
Mythical period; the legends given in these tablets, the offer of
marriage made to him by the goddess Ishtar, the monsters living at the
time, Izdubar's vision of the gods, his journey to the translated Sisit,
with a curious account of a mythical conquest of Erech when the gods and
spirits inhabiting that city changed themselves into animals to escape
the fury of the conqueror: all these things and many others show the
unhistorical nature of the epoch. From the heading of the tablets giving
his history, I suppose that Izdubar lived in the epoch immediately
following the Flood, and I think, likewise, that he may have been the
founder of the Babylonian monarchy, perhaps the Nimrod of Scripture.
This, however, is pure conjecture; so many fabulous stories were current
in Babylonia respecting Izdubar that his existence may even be doubted.
The fragments of the history of Izdubar, so far as I have at present
examined them, remind me of the exploits and labors of Hercules, and, on
the supposition that our present version of Berosus is correct as to
dates, Izdubar may have been placed about 30,000 years before the
Christian era. No document can belong to so remote an age. The legends
of Izdubar and the account of the Flood must however belong to a very
early period, for there are references to the story in the bilingual
lists which were composed in Babylonia during the early Chaldean
empires.

The question might here be asked, "How is it that we find an early
Chaldean document from Erech transported to Nineveh, copied, and placed
in the royal library there?" On this point we can show that it was a
common custom for the Assyrians to obtain and copy Babylonian works, and
a considerable portion of Assyrian literature consists of these copies
of older standard writings.

Assurbanipal, the Assyrian monarch in whose reign the Deluge Tablets
were copied, had intimate relations with the city of Erech. Erech
remained faithful to him when the rest of Babylonia revolted, and to
this city Assurbarripal restored the famous image of the goddess Nana,
which had been carried away by the Elamites one thousand six hundred and
thirty-five years before.

In order properly to understand the reason why the narrative of the
Flood is introduced into the story, it will be necessary to give a short
account of the tablets which precede it before giving the translation of
the Deluge inscription itself.

It appears that Izdubar, the hero of these legends, flourished as before
stated, in the mythical period soon after the Flood, and the center of
most of his exploits was the city of Erech, now called Warka, which must
have been one of the most ancient cities in the world. Four cities only
are mentioned in these inscriptions, Babel, Erech, Surippak, and Nipur.
Two of these, Babel and Erech, are the first two capitals of Nimrod, and
the last one, Nipur, according to the Talmud, is the same as Calneh the
fourth city of Nimrod. Of the first five tablets of the history of
Izdubar I have not recognized any fragments, but in the mass of material
which I have collected it is possible that some portions may be long to
this part of the story.

The following passage forms the opening of the sixth tablet and shows
the style of the writing. Before giving the translation I must notice
that in various places the tablets are broken and the texts defective:
as I cannot point out each of these defective passages, I will endeavor
to indicate them by pausing in my reading.

1\. . . . . . Belesu, he despised Belesu  
2. like a bull his country he ascended after him  
3. he destroyed him, and his memorial perished  
4. the country was subdued, and after he took the crown  
5. Izdubar put on his crown, and after he took the crown  
6. for the favor of Izdubar, the princess Ishtar lifted her eyes.  
7. And she spake thus, "Izdubar thou shalt be husband  
8. thy word me shall bind in bonds,  
9. thou shalt be husband and I will be thy wife,  
10. thou shalt drive in a chariot of Ukni stone and gold,  
11. of which its body is gold and splendid its pole  
12. thou shalt ride in days of great glory  
13. to Bitani, in which is the country where the pine trees grow.  
14. Bitani at thy entrance  
15. to the Euphrates shall kiss thy feet.  
16. There shall be in subjection under thee, kings, lords, and
princes.  
17. The tribute of the mountains and plains they shall bring to thee,
taxes  
18. . . . . . . . they shall give thee, thy herds and flocks shall bring
forth twins  
19. . . . . . . . the mule shall be swift  
20. . . . . . . . in the chariot shall be strong and not weak  
21. . . . . . . . in the yoke. A rival shall not be permitted."

Ishtar, who was the same as Venus, was queen of beauty, but some what
inconstant, for she had already a husband, a deity, called the "Son of
Life"; she however led her husband a poor life, and of this Izdubar
reminds her in his answer to her offer.

One of the next exploits of Izdubar and Heabani his servant was the
conquest of the winged bull, a monster supposed to have existed in those
days; but I must pass over this and other matters, to approach the
subject of the Flood.

In course of time Izdubar, the conqueror of kings and monsters, the
ruler of peoples, fell into some illness and came to fear death, man's
last great enemy. Now, the Babylonians believed in the existence of a
patriarch named Sisit, the Xisuthrus of the Greeks, who was supposed to
have been translated and to have attained to immortality without death.
Izdubar, according to the notions of the time, resolved to seek Sisit,
to ascertain how he became immortal, that he might attain to a similar
honor. The passage reads as follows:

1\. Izdubar to Heabani his servant  
2. bitterly lamented and lay down on the ground  
3. I the account took from Heabani and  
4. weakness entered into my soul  
5. death I feared and I lay down on the ground  
6. to find Sisit son of Ubaratutu  
7. the road I was taking and joyfully I went  
8. to the shadows of the mountains I took at night  
9. the gods I saw and I feared  
10. . . . . . . to Sin I prayed  
11. and before the gods my supplication came  
12. peace they gave unto me  
13. and they sent unto me it dream.

The dream of Izdubar is unfortunately very mutilated, few fragments of
it remaining, and his subsequent journey is not in much better
condition. It appears that he went through a number of adventures, and
three men are represented, in one place, to be telling each other the
story of these adventures.

After long wanderings, Izdubar falls into company with a seaman named
Urbamsi, a name similar to the Orchamus of the Greeks. Izdubar and
Urhamsi fit out a vessel to continue the search for Sisit, and they sail
along for a month and fifteen days, and arrive at some region near the
mouth of the Euphrates, where Sisit was supposed to dwell. in this
journey by water there are fresh adventures and, in their course,
Urharnsi tells Izdubar of the waters of death, of which he states, "The
waters of death thy hands will not cleanse."

At the time when Izdubar and Urhamsi are approaching him, Sisit is
sleeping.The tablet here is too mutilated to inform us how they came to
see each other, but it appears probable from the context that Sisit was
seen in company with his wife, a long distance off, separated from
Izdubar by a stream.

Unable to cross this water which divided the mortal from the immortal,
Izdubar appears to have called to Sisit and asked his momentous question
on life and death. The question asked by Izdubar and the first part of
the answer of Sisit are lost by the mutilation of the tablet. The latter
part of the speech of Sisit, which is preserved, relates to the danger
of death, its universality, &c. It winds up as follows: "The goddess
Mamitu the maker of fate to them their fate has appointed, she has fixed
death and life, but of death the day is not known." These words, which
close the first speech of Sisit, bring us to the end of the tenth
tablet; the next one, the eleventh, is the most important of the series,
as it contains the history of the Flood.

The eleventh tablet opens with a speech of Izdubar, who now asks Sisit
how he became immortal, and Sisit, fit answering, relates the story of
the Flood and his own piety as the reason why he was translated. The
following is the translation of this tablet:

1\. Izdubar after this manner said to Sisit afar off,  
2. ". . . . . . Sisit  
3. The account do thou tell to me,  
4. The account do thou tell to me,  
5. . . . . . to the midst to make war  
6. . . . . . I come up after thee.  
7. say how thou hast done it, and in the circle of the gods life thou
hast gained."  
8. Sisit after this manner said to Izdubar,  
9. "I will reveal to thee, Izdubar, the concealed story,  
10. and the wisdom of the gods I will relate to thee.  
11. The city Surippak the city which thou hast established . . . . . . .
. . placed  
12. was ancient, and the gods within it  
13. dwelt, a tempest . . . . . their god, the great gods  
14. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Anu  
15. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Bel  
16. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ninip  
17. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . lord of Hades  
18. their will revealed in the midst of . . . . .  
19 . . . . . . . hearing and he spoke to me thus  
20. Surippakite son of Ubaratutu  
21. make a great ship for thee . . . . . . .  
22. I will destroy the sinners and life . . . . .  
23. cause to go in the seed of life all of it, to preserve them  
24. the ship which thou shalt make  
25. . . . cubits shall be the measure of its length, and  
26. . . . cubits the amount of its breadth and its height.  
27. Into the deep launch it."  
28. I perceived and said to Hea my lord,  
29. "Hea my lord this that thou commandest me  
30. I will perform, it shall be done.  
31. . . . . . . . . army and host  
32. Hea opened his mouth and spake, and said to me his servant,  
33. . . . . . . . . thou shalt say unto them,  
34. . . . . . . . . he has turned from me and  
35. . . . . . . . . . . . .fixed . . . . . . . . . .

Here there are about fifteen lines entirely lost. The absent passage
probably described part of the building of the ark.

87. In the day that I celebrated his festival

89. I entered to the midst of the ship, and shut my door;  
90. to guide the ship, to Buzursadirabi the pilot,  
91. the palace I gave to his hand.  
92. The raging of a storm in the morning  
93. arose, from the horizon of heaven extending and wide  
94. Vul in the midst of it thundered, and  
95. Nebo and Saru went in front;  
96. the throne bearers went over mountains and plains;  
97. the destroyer Nergal overturned;  
98. Ninip went in front, and cast down;  
99. the spirits carried destruction;  
100. in their glory they swept the earth;  
101. of Vul the flood, reached to heaven;  
102. the bright earth to a waste was turned;  
103. the surface of the earth, like . . . . it swept;  
104. it destroyed all life, from the face of the earth . . . . .  
105. the strong tempest over the people, reached to heaven.  
106. Brother saw not his brother, it did not spare the people. In
heaven  
107. the gods feared the tempest, and  
108. Sought refuge; they ascended to the heaven of Anu.  
109. The gods, like dogs with tails hidden, couched down.  
110. Spake Ishtar a discourse,  
111. uttered the great goddess her speech  
112. 'The world to sin has turned, and  
113. then I in the presence of the gods prophesied evil;  
114. when I prophesied in the presence of the gods evil,  
115. to evil were devoted all my people, and I prophesied  
116. thus, 'I have begotten man and let him not  
117. like the sons of the fishes fill the sea.'  
118. The gods concerning the spirits, were weeping with her:  
119. the gods in seats, seated in lamentation;  
120. covered were their lips for the coming evil.  
121. Six days and nights  
122. passed, the wind tempest and storm overwhelmed,  
123. on the seventh day in its course, was calmed the storm, and all the
tempest  
124. which had destroyed like an earthquake,  
125. quieted. The sea he caused to dry, and the wind and tempest
ended.  
126. I was carried through the sea. The doer of evil,  
127. and the whole of mankind who turned to sin,  
128. like reeds their corpses floated.  
129. I opened the window and the light broke in, over my refuge  
130. it passed, I sat still and  
131. over my refuge came peace.  
132. I was carried over the shore, at the boundary of the sea.  
133. For twelve measures it ascended over the land.  
134. To the country of Nizir, went the ship;  
135. the mountain of Nizir stopped the ship, and to pass over it, it was
not able.  
136. The first day and the second day, the mountain of Nizir the same.  
137. The third day and the fourth day, the mountain of Nizir the same.  
138. The fifth and sixth, the mountain of Nizir the same.  
139. On the seventh day in the course of it  
140. I sent forth a dove, and it left. The dove went and searched and  
141. a resting place it did not find, and it returned.  
142. I sent forth a swallow, and it left. The swallow went and searched
and  
143. a resting place it did not find, and it returned.  
144. I sent forth a raven, and it left.  
145. The raven went, and the corpses on the waters it saw, and  
146. it did eat, it swam, and wandered away, and did not return.  
147. I sent the animals forth to the four winds I poured out a
libation  
148. I built an altar on the peak of the mountain,  
149. by sevens herbs I cut,  
150. at the bottom of them, I placed reeds, pines, and simgar.  
151. The gods collected at its burning, the gods collected at its good
burning.  
152. the gods like flies over the sacrifice gathered,  
153. From of old also, the great God in his course,  
154. the great brightness of Arm had created; when the glory  
155. of these gods, as of Ukni stone, on my countenance I could not
endure;  
156. in those days I prayed that for ever I might not endure.  
157. May the gods come to my altar;  
158. may Bel not come to my altar  
159. for he did not consider and had made a tempest  
160. and my people he had consigned to the deep  
161. from of old, also Bel in his course  
162. saw the ship, and went Bel with anger filled to the gods and
spirits;  
163. let not any one come out alive, let not a man be saved from the
deep.  
164. Ninip his mouth opened and spake, and said to the warrior Bel,  
165. 'who then will be saved,' Hea the words understood,  
166. and Hea knew all things,  
167. Hea his mouth opened and spake, and said to the warrior Bel,  
168. 'Thou prince of the gods, warrior,  
169. when thou art angry a tempest thou makest,  
170. the doer of sin did his sin, the doer of evil did his evil,  
171. may the exalted not be broken, may the captive not be delivered;  
172. instead of thee making a tempest, may lions increase and men be
reduced;  
173. instead of thee making a tempest, may leopards increase, and men be
reduced;  
174. instead of thee making a tempest, may a famine happen, and the
country be destroyed;  
175. instead of thee making a tempest, may pestilence increase, and men
be destroyed.'  
176. I did not peer into the wisdom of the gods,  
177. reverent and attentive a dream they sent, and the wisdom of the
gods he heard.  
178. When his judgment was accomplished, Bel went up to the midst of the
ship,  
179. he took my hand and brought me out, me  
180. he brought out, he caused to bring my wife to my side,  
181. he purified the country, he established in a covenant and took the
people  
182. in the presence of Sisit and the people.  
183. When Sisit and his wife and the people to be like the gods were
carried away,  
184. then dwelt Sisit in a remote place at the mouth of the rivers.  
185. They took me and in a remote place at the mouth of the rivers they
seated me.  
186. When to thee whom the gods have chosen thee, and  
187. the life which thou has sought after, thou shalt gain  
188. this do, for six days and seven nights  
189. like I say also, in bonds bind him  
190. the way like a storm shall be laid upon him."  
191. Sisit after this manner, said to his wife  
192. "I announce that the chief who grasps at life  
193. the way like a storm shall be laid upon him."  
194. His wife after this manner, said to Sisit afar off,  
195. "Purify him and let the man be sent away,  
196. the road that lie came, may he return in peace,  
197. the great gate open, and may he return to his country."  
198. Sisit after this manner, said to his wife,  
199. "The cry of a man alarms thee,  
200. this do, his scarlet cloth place on his head."  
201. And the day when he ascended the side of the ship  
202. she did, his scarlet cloth she placed on his head,  
203. and the day when he ascended on the side of the ship,

The next four lines describe seven things done to Izdubar before he was
purified. The passage is obscure and does not concern the Flood, so I
have not translated it.

208\. Izdubar after this manner, said to Sisit afar off,  
209. "This way, she has done, I come up  
210. joyfully, my strength thou givest me."  
211. Sisit after this manner said to Izdubar  
212. . . . . . . . . . . . thy scarlet cloth  
213. . . . . . . . . . . . I have lodged thee  
214. . . . . . . . . . . .

The five following lines, which are mutilated, refer again to the seven
matters for purifying Izdubar; this passage, like the former one, I do
not translate.

219\. Izdubar after this manner said to Sisit afar off  
220. . . . . . . . . . . Sisit to thee may we not come.

From here the text is much mutilated, and it will be better to give a
general account of its contents than to attempt a strict translation,
especially as this part is not so interesting as the former part of the
tablet.

Lines 221 and 223 mention some one who was taken and dwelt with Death.
Lines 224 to 235 gives a speech of Sisit to the seaman Urhamsi,
directing him how to cure Izdubar, who, from the broken passages,
appears to have been suffering from some form of skin disease. Izdubar
was to be dipped in the sea, when beauty was to spread over his skin
once more. In lines 236 to 241 the carrying out of these directions and
the cure of Izdubar are recorded.

The tablet then reads as follows:

242\. Izdubar and Urhamsi rode in the boat  
243. where they placed them they rode  
244. His wife after this manner said to Sisit afar off,  
245. "Izdubar goes away, he is satisfied, he performs  
246. that which thou hast given him and returns to his country."  
247. And he heard, and after Izdubar  
248. he went to the shore  
249. Sisit after this manner said to Izdubar,  
250. "Izdubar thou goest away thou art satisfied, thou performest  
251. That which I have given thee and thou returnest to thy country  
252. I have revealed to thee Izdubar the concealed story."

Lines 253 to 262, which are very mutilated, give the conclusion of the
speech of Sisit, and then state that after hearing it, Izdubar took
great stones and piled them up as a memorial of these events.

Lines 263 to 289 give in a very mutilated condition subsequent speeches
and doings of Izdubar and Urhanisi. In this part journeys are mentioned
of 10 and 20 kaspu, or 70 and 140 miles; a lion is also spoken of, but
there is no further allusion to the Flood. These lines close the
inscription, and are followed by a colophon which gives the heading of
the next tablet, and the statement that this (the Flood Tablet) is the
11th tablet in the series giving the history of Izdubar, and that it is
a copy of the ancient inscription.

Before entering into the details of the tablet, I must first refer to
the accounts of the Deluge given in the Bible, and by Berosus, the
Chaldean historian, as I shall have to compare these with the Cuneiform
record.

The Biblical account of the Deluge, contained in the sixth to the ninth
chapters of Genesis, is of course familiar to us all, so I will only
give the outline of the narrative.

According to the Book of Genesis, as man mutiplied on the earth, the
whole race turned to evil, except the family of Noah. On account of the
wickedness of man, the Lord determined to destroy the world by a flood,
and gave command to Noah to build an ark, 300 cubits long, 50 cubits
broad, and 30 cubits high. Into this ark Noah entered according to the
command of the Lord, taking with him his family, and pairs of each
animal. After seven days the Flood commenced in the 600th year of Noah,
the seventeenth day of the second month, and after 150 days the ark
rested upon the mountains of Ararat, on the seventeenth day of the
seventh month. We are then told that after 40 days Noah opened the
window of the ark and sent forth a raven which did not return. He then
sent forth a dove, which finding no rest for the sole of her foot,
returned to him. Seven days after he sent forth the dove a second time,
she returned to him with an olive leaf in her mouth. Again, after seven
days, he sent forth the dove which returned to him no more. The Flood
was dried up in the 601st year, on the first day of the first month, and
on the twenty-seventh day of the second month, Noah removed from the ark
and afterwards built an altar and offered sacrifices.

The Chaldean account of the Flood, as given by Berosus, I have taken
from Cory's Ancient Fragments, pages 26 to 29, as follows:

"After the death of Ardates, his son Xisuthrus reigned eighteen sari. In
his time happened a great Deluge, the history of which is thus
described: The Deity, Cronos, appeared to him in a vision, and warned
him that upon the fifteenth day of the month Daesius, there would be a
flood, by which mankind would be destroyed. He, therefore, enjoined him
to write a history of the beginning, procedure, and conclusion of all
things; and to bury it in the City of the Sun at Sippara; and to build a
vessel, and take with him into it his friends and relations; and to
convey on board everything necessary to sustain life, together with all
the different animals, both birds and quadrupeds, and trust himself
fearlessly to the deep. Having asked the Deity whither he was to sail?
he was answered, 'To the Gods'; upon which he offered up a prayer for
the good of mankind. He then obeyed the Divine admonition, and built a
vessel five stadia in length, and two in breadth. Into this he put every
thing which he had prepared: and last of all conveyed into it his wife,
his children, and his friends.

"After the Flood had been upon the earth, and was in time abated,
Xisuthrus sent out birds from the vessel, which not finding any food,
nor any place whereupon they might rest their feet, returned to him
again. After an interval of some days he sent them forth a second time,
and they now returned with their feet tinged with mud. He made a trial a
third time with these birds, but they returned to him no more: from
whence he judged that the surface of the earth had appeared above the
waters. He, therefore, made an opening in the vessel, and upon looking
out found that it was stranded upon the side of some mountain, upon
which he immediately quitted it with his wife, his daughter, and the
pilot. Xisuthrus then paid his adoration to the earth, and having
constructed an altar, offered sacrifices to the gods, and, with those
who had come out of the vessel with him, disappeared. "They, who
remained within, finding that their companions did not return, quitted
the vessel with many lamentations, and called con tinually on the name
of Xisuthrus. Him they saw no more; but they could distinguish his voice
in the air, and could hear him admonish them to pay due regard to
religion; and likewise informed them that it was upon account of his
piety that he was translated to live with the gods, that his wife, and
daughter, and the pilot, had obtained the same honor. To this he added
that they should return to Babylonia, and as it was ordained, search for
the writings at Sippara, which they were to make known to all mankind;
moreover, that the place wherein they were was the land of Armenia.

"The rest having heard these words, offered sacrifices to the gods, and
taking a circuit, journeyed towards Babylonia.

"The vessel being thus stranded in Armenia, some part of it yet remains
in the Corcyraean mountains."

In pages 33 and 34 of Cory's Fragments there is a second version, as
follows:

"And then Sisithrus. To him the deity of Cronos foretold that on the
fifteenth day of the month Daesius there would be a deluge of rain: and
he commanded him to deposit all the writings whatever which were in his
possession, in the City of the Sun at Sippara. Sisithrus, when he had
complied with these commands, sailed immediately to Armenia, and was
presently inspired by God. Upon the third day after the cessation of the
rain Sisithrus sent out birds, by way of experiment, that he might judge
whether the Flood had subsided. But the birds passing over an unbounded
sea, without finding any place of rest, re turned again to Sisithrus.
This he repeated with other birds. And when upon the third trial he
succeeded, for the birds then returned with their feet stained with mud,
the gods translated him from among men. With respect to the vessel,
which yet remains in Armenia, it is a custom of the inhabitants to form
bracelets and amulets of its wood."

There are several other accounts of the Flood in the traditions of
different ancient nations; these, however, are neither so full nor so
precise as the account of Berosus, and their details so far as they are
given differ more from the Biblical narrative, so I shall not notice
them now, but pass at once to the examination of the text.

In comparing the text of the Deluge Tablet with the accounts in the
Bible and Berosus, the first point that meets us is the consideration of
the proper names. This is the least satisfactory part of the subject,
for, while the Greek forms show variant readings and have evidently been
corrupted, the Cuneiform names on the other hand, being written mostly
in monograms, are difficult to render phonetically. The father of the
hero of the Flood bears in the inscriptions the name Ubara-tutu which
ought to correspond to one of the Greek forms, Otiártes or Ardátes; the
resemblance however cannot be called a close one. The hero of the Flood
I have provisionally called Sisit; he corresponds, of course, to the
Greek Xisuthrus, but no comparison of the two names can be made until we
know the phonetic reading of the Cuneiform name. Neither the Cuneiform
nor the Greek names appear to have any connection with the Biblical
Lamech and Noah. In the opening of the account of the Flood there is a
noticeable difference between the Cuneiform and Biblical narratives, for
while in the Jewish account one God only is men tioned, the Cuneiform
inscription mentions all the principal gods of the early Babylonian
Pantheon as engaged in bringing about the Flood.

The Cuneiform account agrees with the Biblical narrative in making the
Deluge a divine punishment for the wickedness of the world; this point
is omitted in the Greek accounts of Berosus.

The gods having resolved on the Deluge, the deity whom we have hitherto
provisionally called Hea announces the coming event to Sisit. Now, in
the account of Berosus, the god who announces the Deluge is stated to be
Cronos; so this passage gives us the Cuneiform name of the deity
identified by the Greeks with Cronos. The Greek account states that the
communication of the coming Deluge was made in a dream. From the context
it is probable that the Cuneiform account stated the same, but the text
is here mutilated so that the point cannot be decided.

The dimensions of the vessel in the inscription are unfortunately lost
by a fracture which has broken off both numbers; the passage, which is
otherwise complete, shows that the dimensions were expressed in cubits
as in the Biblical account, but while Genesis makes the ark 50 cubits
broad and 30 cubits high, the inscription states that the height and
breadth were the same.

The greater part of the description of the building of the ark is lost.
In the latter part of the account which is preserved, there is mention
of the trial of the vessel by launching it into the sea, when defects
being found which admitted the water, the outside and inside were coated
with bitumen. These details have no parallel either in the Bible or
Berosus. The description of the filling of the ark agrees in general
with the two other accounts, but it differs from Genesis in not
mentioning the sevens of clean animals and in including others beside
the family of the builder.

The month and day when the Deluge commenced, which are given in the
Bible and Berosus, are not mentioned in the text, unless the fifth day,
mentioned in a mutilated passage, is part of this date.

The description of the Flood in this inscription is very vivid; it is
said to have been so terrible that the gods, fearing it, ascended to the
heaven of Arm, that it is the highest and furthest heaven, the
destruction of the human race is recorded, and the corpses of the wicked
are said to have floated on the surface of the Flood.

With regard to the duration of the Deluge, there appears to be a serious
difference between the Bible and the inscription. According to the
account in the Book of Genesis, the Flood commenced on the seventeenth
day of the second month, the ark rested on Ararat after one hundred and
fifty days on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, and the complete
drying up of the Flood was not until the twenty seventh day of the
second month in the following year. The inscription, on the other hand,
states that the Flood abated on the seventh day, and that the ship
remained seven days on the mountain before the sending out of the birds.

On this point it must be remarked that some Biblical critics consider
that there are two versions of the Flood story in Genesis itself, and
that these two differ as to the duration of the Flood.

The Greek account of Berosus is silent as to the duration of the Deluge.

With regard to the mountain on which the ark rested there is a
difference between the Bible and the inscription, which is more apparent
than real. The Book of Genesis states that the ark rested on the
mountains of Ararat. According to the popular notion this refers to the
mountain of Ararat, in Armenia; but these mountains may have been
anywhere within the ancient territory of Ararat, and some Commentators
looking at the passage in Berosus, where the ark is stated to have
rested in the Gordiaean mountains, have inclined to place the mountain
referred to in the Kurdish mountains, east of Assyria. In accordance
with this indication the inscription states that the ship rested on the
mountain of Nizir.

Now, the position of Nizir can be determined from the inscription of
Assur-nazir-pal, king of Assyria. He made an expedition to this region,
and starting from an Assyrian city, near Arbela, crossed the Lower Zab,
and marching eastward between latitudes 35 and 36, arrived at the
mountains of Nizir. These mountains of Nizir thus lay east of Assyria,
but they form part of a series of mountain chains extending to the
north-west into Armenia.

The vessel being stranded on the mountain, the Bible, Berosus, and the
inscription all agree that trial was made by birds in order to ascertain
if the Flood had subsided; but in the details of these trials there are
curious differences in all three narratives. According to the Book of
Genesis, a raven was sent out first, which did not return; a dove was
sent next, which finding no resting place returned to Noah. Seven days
later the dove was sent out again, and returned with an olive leaf; and
seven days after, on the dove being sent out again, it returned no more.

The account of Berosus mentions the sending out of the birds, but does
not mention what kinds were tried. On the first trial the birds are said
to have returned, and on the second trial likewise, this time with mud
on their feet. On the third occasion they did not return.

The inscription states that, first, a dove was sent out, which finding
no resting place returned. On the second occasion a swallow was sent,
which also returned. The third time a raven was sent out, which feeding
on the corpses floating on the water, wandered away and did not return.
Thus, the inscription agrees with the Bible as to the sending out of the
raven and dove, but adds to these the trial of the swallow, which is not
in Genesis. In the number of the trials it agrees with Berosus, who has
three, while Genesis has four. On the other hand there is no mention of
the dove returning with an olive leaf, as in Genesis, and of the birds
having their feet stained with Mud, as in Berosus.

In the statement of the building of the altar, and offering sacrifice
after leaving the ark, all three accounts agree; but in the subsequent
matter there is an important difference between the Bible and the
inscription, for while the Bible represents Noah as living for many
years after the Flood, the inscription on the other hand agrees with
Berosus in making Sisit to be translated like the gods. This translation
is in the Bible recorded of Enoch, the ancestor of Noah.

On reviewing the evidence it is apparent that the events of the Flood
narrated in the Bible and the inscription are the same, and occur in the
same order; but the minor differences in the details show that the
inscription embodies a distinct and independent tradition.

In spite of a striking similarity in style, which shows itself in
several places, the two narratives belong to totally distinct peoples.
The Biblical account is the version of an inland people, the name of the
ark in Gene sis means a chest or box, and not a ship; there is no notice
of the sea, or of launching, no pilots are spoken of, no navigation is
mentioned. The inscription on the other hand belongs to a maritime
people, the ark is called a ship, the ship is launched into the sea,
trial is made of it, and it is given in charge of a pilot.

The Cuneiform inscription, after giving the history of the Flood down to
the sacrifice of Sisit, when he came out of the ark, goes back to the
former part of the story, and mentions the god Bel in particular as the
maker of the tempest or deluge; there appears to be a slight
inconsistency between this and the former part of the inscription which
suggests the question whether the Chaldean narrative itself may not have
been compiled from two distinct and older accounts.

It is remarkable that the oldest traditions of the early Babylonians
seem to center round the Persian Gulf. From this sea, Oannes the fish
god is supposed to have arisen, and the composite monsters who followed
him in the antediluvian period came from the same region. Into this sea
the ark was launched, and after the subsiding of the Deluge when Sisit
was translated, he dwelt in this neighborhood. To this sea also came the
great hero Izdubar, and was cured, and here he heard the story of the
Flood.

In conclusion I would remark that this account of the Deluge opens to us
a new field of inquiry in the early part of the Bible history. The
question has often been asked, "What is the origin of the accounts of
the antediluvians, with their long lives so many times greater than the
longest span of human life? Where was Paradise, the abode of the first
parents of mankind? From whence comes the story of the flood, the ark,
of the birds?" Various conflicting answers have been given to these
important questions, while evidence on these subjects before the Greek
period has been entirely wanting. The Cuneiform inscriptions are now
shedding a new light on these questions, and supplying material which
future scholars will have to work out. Following this inscription, we
may expect many other discoveries throwing light on these ancient
periods, until we are able to form a decisive opinion on the many great
questions involved. It would be a mistake to suppose that with the
translation and commentary on an inscription like this the matter is
ended. The origin, age, and history of the legend have to be traced, and
it has to be compared with the many similar stories current among
various nations.

All these accounts, together with considerable portions of the ancient
mythologies have, I believe, a common origin in the Plains of Chaldea.
This country the cradle of civilization, the birthplace of the arts and
sciences, for 2,000 years has been in ruins; its literature, containing
the most precious records of antiquity, is scarcely known to us, except
from the texts the Assyrians copied, but beneath its mounds and ruined
cities, now awaiting exploration, lay, together with older copies of
this Deluge text, other legends and histories of the earliest
civilization in the world.
