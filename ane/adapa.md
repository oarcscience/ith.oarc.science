### ADAPA AND THE FOOD OF LIFE \[from "Cuneiform Parallels to the Old Testament " by R.W. Rogers, 1912\]. 

  
\[Summary: Adapa, or perhaps Adamu, son of Ea, had recieved from his
father, the god Ea, wisdom, but not eternal life. He was a semi-divine
being and was the wise man and priest of the temple of Ea at Eridu,
which he provided with the ritual bread and water. In the exercise of
this duty he carried on fishing upon the Persian Gulf. When Adapa was
fishing one day on a smooth sea, the south wind rose suddenly and
overturned his boat, so that the was thrown into the sea. Angered by the
mishap, he broke the wings of the south wind so that for seven days it
could not blow the sea's coolness over the hot land. Anu calls Adapa to
account for this misdeed, and his father Ea warns him as to what should
befall him. He tells him how to fool Tammuz and Gishzida, who will meet
him at the gate of heaven. Ea cautions him not to eat or drink anything
in heaven, as Ea fears that the food and drink of death will be set
before Adapa. However, the food and drink of eternal life are set before
him instead, and Adapa's over-caution deprives him of immortality. He
has to return to Earth instead.\]

The south wind .... when  
He had driven me to the house of my lord, I said,  
O South wind, on the way I shall to thee ... everything that,  
Thy wing, will I break." As be spoke with his mouth,  
The wing of the South wind was broken, seven davs  
The South wind blew not upon the land. Anu  
Called to his messenger Ilabrat:  
Why has the South wind not blown upon the land for seven davs?  
His messenger Ilabrat answered him: "My lord,  
Adapa, the son of Ea, the wing of the South wind  
Has broken."  
When Anu heard these words  
He cried, Help!" He ascended his throne,  
"Let some one bring him,"  
Likewise Ea, who knows the heaven. He roused him  
... he caused him to wear. With a mourning garment  
He garbed him, and gave him counsel  
Saying: " Adapa, before the face of Anu the King thou art to go  
... to heaven  
When thou comest up, and when thou approachest the door of Anu,  
At the door of Anu, Tammuz and Gishzida are standing,  
"they will see thee, they will ask thee; 'Sir,'  
For whose sake dost thou so appear, Adapa? For whom  
Art thou clad in a mourning garment?' 'In our country two gods have
vanished, therefore  
Am I so.' 'Who are the two gods, who in the land  
Have vanished?' 'Tammuz and Gishzida.' They will look at one another
and  
Be astonished. Good words  
They will speak to Anu. A good countenance of Anu  
They will show thee. When thou standest before Anu  
Food of death they will set before thee,  
Eat not. Water of death they will set before thee,  
Drink not. Garments they will set before thee,  
Put them on. Oil they will set before thee, anoint thyself.  
The counsel that I have given thee, forget not. The words  
Which I have spoken, hold fast." The messenger  
Of Anu came: "Adapa has broken  
The wing of the South wind. Bring him before me."  
The road to Heaven he made him take, and to Heaven he ascended.  
When he came to Heaven, when he approached the door of Anu,  
At the door of Ann, Tammuz and Gisbzida are standing.  
When they saw him, Adapa, they cried: " Help,  
Sir, for whom dost thou so appear? Adapa,  
For whom art thou clad in a mourning garment?"  
In the country two gods have vanished; therefore am I clad  
In mourning garments." "Who are the two gods, who  
have vanished from the land?"  
"Tammuz and Gishzida." They looked at one another and  
Were astonished. When Adapa before Anu, the King,  
Drew near, and Anu saw him, he cried:  
" Come hither, Adapa. Why hast thou broken the wings  
Of the South wind? " Adapa answered Ann: " My lord,  
For the house of my lord in the midst of the sea,  
I was catching fish. The sea was like a mirror,  
The South wind blew, and capsized me.  
To the house of my lord was I driven. In the anger of my heart,  
I took heed." Tammuz and Gishzida  
Answered ... "art thou." To Anu  
They speak. He calmed himself, his heart was . . .  
"Why has Ea revealed to impure mankind  
The heart of heaven and earth? A heart  
... has created within him, has made him a name?  
What can we do with him? Food of life  
Bring him, that be man, eat."Food of life  
They brought him, but he ate not. Water of life  
They brought him, but he drank not. Garments  
They brought him. He clothed himself. Oil  
They brought him. He anointed himself.  
Anu looked at him; he wondered at him.  
" Come, Adapa, why hast thou not eaten, not drunken?  
Now thou shalt not live." ... men ...Ea, my lord  
Said: "Eat not, drink not."  
Take him and bring him back to his earth.  
... looked upon him.
