WHEN the curtain rises to reveal the drama of Babylonian civilization we
find that we have missed the first act and its many fascinating scenes.
Sumerians and Akkadians come and go, but it is not always possible to
distinguish between them. Although most Semites are recognizable by
their flowing beards, prominent noses, and long robes, some have so
closely imitated the Sumerians as to suffer almost complete loss of
identity. It is noticeable that in the north the Akkadians are more
Semitic than their contemporaries in the south, but it is difficult at
times to say whether a city is controlled by the descendants of the
indigenous people or those of later settlers. Dynasties rise and fall,
and, as in Egypt at times, the progress of the fragmentary narrative is
interrupted by a sudden change

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

of scene ere we have properly grasped a situation and realized its
significance.

What we know for certain is that civilization is well advanced. Both in
the north and the south there are many organized and independent city
states, and not unfrequently these wage war one against another.
Occasionally ambitious rulers tower among their fellows, conduct
vigorous military campaigns, and become overlords of wide districts. As
a rule, a subjugated monarch who has perforce to acknowledge the
suzerainty of a powerful king is allowed to remain in a state of
semi-independence on condition that he pays a heavy annual tribute of
grain. His own laws continue in force, and the city deities remain
supreme, although recognition may also be given to the deities of his
conqueror. He styles himself a Patesi--a "priest king", or more
literally, "servant of the chief deity". But as an independent monarch
may also be a pious Patesi, it does not always follow when a ruler is
referred to by that title he is necessarily less powerful than his
neighbours.

When the historical narrative begins Akkad included the cities of
Babylon, Cutha, Kish, Akkad, and Sippar, and north of Babylonia proper
is Semitic Opis. Among the cities of Sumer were Eridu, Ur, Lagash,
Larsa, Erech, Shuruppak, and probably Nippur, which was situated on the
"border". On the north Assyria was yet "in the making", and shrouded in
obscurity. A vague but vast area above Hit on the Euphrates, and
extending to the Syrian coast, was known as the "land of the Amorites".
The fish-shaped Babylonian valley lying between the rivers, where walled
towns were surrounded by green fields and numerous canals flashed in the
sunshine, was bounded on the west by the bleak wastes of the Arabian
desert, where during the dry season "the rocks branded

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

the body" and occasional sandstorms swept in blinding folds towards the
"plain of Shinar" (Sumer) like demon hosts who sought to destroy the
world. To the east the skyline was fretted by the Persian Highlands, and
amidst the southern mountains dwelt the fierce Elamites, the hereditary
enemies of the Sumerians, although a people apparently of the same
origin. Like the Nubians and the Libyans, who kept watchful eyes on
Egypt, the Elamites seemed ever to be hovering on the eastern frontier
of Sumeria, longing for an opportunity to raid and plunder.

The capital of the Elamites was the city of Susa, where excavations have
revealed traces of an independent civilization which reaches back to an
early period in the Late Stone Age. Susa is referred to in the Old
Testament--"The words of Nehemiah . . . I was in Shushan the
palace". <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_143.md) An Assyrian plan of the
city shows it occupying a strategic position at a bend of the Shawur
river, which afforded protection against Sumerian attacks from the west,
while a canal curved round its northern and eastern sides, so that Susa
was completely surrounded by water. Fortifications had been erected on
the river and canal banks, and between these and the high city walls
were thick clumps of trees. That the kings of Elam imitated the
splendours of Babylonian courts in the later days of Esther and Haman
and Mordecai, is made evident by the Biblical references to the gorgeous
palace, which had "white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords
of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble; the beds
were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white,
and black marble". <span id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_144.md) Beyond Elam
were the plains, plateaus, and grassy steppes occupied by the Medes and
other

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

peoples of Aryan speech. Cultural influences came and went like spring
winds between the various ancient communities.

For ten long centuries Sumer and Akkad flourished and prospered ere we
meet with the great Hammurabi, whose name has now become almost as
familiar as that of Julius Cæsar. But our knowledge of the leading
historical events of this vast period is exceedingly fragmentary. The
Sumerians were not like the later Assyrians or their Egyptian
contemporaries--a people with a passion for history. When inscriptions
were composed and cut on stone, or impressed upon clay tablets and
bricks, the kings selected as a general rule to record pious deeds
rather than to celebrate their victories and conquests. Indeed, the
average monarch had a temperament resembling that of Keats, who
declared:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                              The silver flow  
Of Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen,  
Fair Pastorella in the bandits' den,  
Are things to brood on with more ardency  
Than the death day of empires.</span>

</div>

The Sumerian king was emotionally religious as the great English poet
was emotionally poetical. The tears of Ishtar for Tammuz, and the
afflictions endured by the goddess imprisoned in Hades, to which she had
descended for love of her slain husband, seemed to have concerned the
royal recorder to a greater degree than the memories of political
upheavals and the social changes which passed over the land, like the
seasons which alternately brought greenness and gold, barrenness and
flood.

City chronicles, as a rule, are but indices of obscure events, to which
meagre references were sometimes also made on mace heads, vases,
tablets, stelæ, and sculptured

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

monoliths. Consequently, present-day excavators and students have often
reason to be grateful that the habit likewise obtained of inscribing on
bricks in buildings and the stone sockets of doors the names of kings
and others. These records render obscure periods faintly articulate, and
are indispensable for comparative purposes. Historical clues are also
obtained from lists of year names. Each city king named a year in
celebration of a great event--his own succession to the throne, the
erection of a new temple or of a city wall, or, mayhap, the defeat of an
invading army from a rival state. Sometimes, too, a monarch gave the
name of his father in an official inscription, or happily mentioned
several ancestors. Another may be found to have made an illuminating
statement regarding a predecessor, who centuries previously erected the
particular temple that he himself has piously restored. A reckoning of
this kind, however, cannot always be regarded as absolutely correct. It
must be compared with and tested by other records, for in these ancient
days calculations were not unfrequently based on doubtful inscriptions,
or mere oral traditions, perhaps. Nor can implicit trust be placed on
every reference to historical events, for the memoried deeds of great
rulers were not always unassociated with persistent and cumulative
myths. It must be recognized, therefore, that even portions of the data
which had of late been sifted and systematized by Oriental scholars in
Europe, may yet have to be subjected to revision. Many interesting and
important discoveries, which will throw fresh light on this fascinating
early period, remain to be made in that ancient and deserted land, which
still lies under the curse of the Hebrew prophet, who exclaimed:
"Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency,
shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gomorrah. It shall
never be inhabited; neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither
shall the shepherds make their fold there. But wild beasts of the desert
shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures;
and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. And the wild
beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in
their pleasant palaces." <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_145.md)

The curtain rises, as has been indicated, after civilization had been
well advanced. To begin with, our interests abide with Akkad, and during
a period dated approximately between 3000 B.C. and 2800 B.C., when Egypt
was already a united kingdom, and the Cretans were at the dawn of the
first early Minoan period, and beginning to use bronze. In Kish Sumerian
and Akkadian elements had apparently blended, and the city was the
centre of a powerful and independent government. After years have
fluttered past dimly, and with them the shadow-shapes of vigorous
rulers, it is found that Kish came under the sway of the pronouncedly
Semitic city of Opis, which was situated "farthest north" and on the
western bank of the river Tigris. A century elapsed ere Kish again threw
off the oppressor's yoke and renewed the strength of its youth.

The city of Kish was one of the many ancient centres of goddess worship.
The Great Mother appears to have been the Sumerian Bau, whose chief seat
was at Lagash. If tradition is to be relied upon, Kish owed its
existence to that notable lady, Queen Azag-Bau. Although floating
legends gathered round her memory as they have often gathered round the
memories of famous men, like Sargon of Akkad, Alexander the Great, and
Theodoric the Goth, who became Emperor of Rome, it is probable

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

that the queen was a prominent historical personage. She was reputed to
have been of humble origin, and to have first achieved popularity and
influence as the keeper of a wine shop. Although no reference survives
to indicate that she was believed to be of miraculous birth, the
Chronicle of Kish gravely credits her with a prolonged and apparently
prosperous reign of a hundred years. Her son, who succeeded her, sat on
the throne for a quarter of a century. These calculations are certainly
remarkable. If the Queen Azag-Bau founded Kish when she was only twenty,
and gave birth to the future ruler in her fiftieth year, he must have
been an elderly gentleman of seventy when he began to reign. When it is
found, further, that the dynasty in which mother and son flourished was
supposed to have lasted for 586 years, divided between eight rulers, one
of whom reigned for only three years, two for six, and two for eleven,
it becomes evident that the historian of Kish cannot be absolutely
relied upon in detail. It seems evident that the memory of this lady of
forceful character, who flourished about thirteen hundred years before
the rise of Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt, has overshadowed the doubtful
annals of ancient Kish at a period when Sumerian and Semite were
striving in the various states to achieve political ascendancy.

Meanwhile the purely Sumerian city of Lagash had similarly grown
powerful and aggressive. For a time it acknowledged the suzerainty of
Kish, but ultimately it threw off the oppressor's yoke and asserted its
independence. The cumulative efforts of a succession of energetic rulers
elevated Lagash to the position of a metropolis in Ancient Babylonia.

The goddess Bau, "the mother of Lagash", was worshipped in conjunction
with other deities, including the god Nin-Girsu, an agricultural deity,
and therefore

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

a deity of war, who had solar attributes. One of the titles of Nin-Girsu
was En-Mersi, which, according to Assyrian evidence, was another name of
Tammuz, the spring god who slew the storm and winter demons, and made
the land fertile so that man might have food. Nin-Girsu was, it would
seem, a developed form of Tammuz, like the Scandinavian Frey, god of
harvest, or Heimdal, the celestial warrior. Bau was one of the several
goddesses whose attributes were absorbed by the Semitic Ishtar. She was
a "Great Mother", a creatrix, the source of all human and bestial life,
and, of course, a harvest goddess. She was identified with Gula, "the
great one", who cured diseases and prolonged life. Evidently the
religion of Lagash was based on the popular worship of the "Queen of
Heaven", and her son, the dying god who became "husband of his mother".

The first great and outstanding ruler of Lagash was Ur-Nina, who appears
to have owed his power to the successful military operations of his
predecessors. It is uncertain whether or not he himself engaged in any
great war. His records are silent in that connection, but, judging from
what we know of him, it may be taken for granted that he was able and
fully prepared to give a good account of himself in battle. He certainly
took steps to make secure his position, for he caused a strong wall to
be erected round Lagash. His inscriptions are eloquent of his piety,
which took practical shape, for he repaired and built temples, dedicated
offerings to deities, and increased the wealth of religious bodies and
the prosperity of the State by cutting canals and developing
agriculture. In addition to serving local deities, he also gave
practical recognition to Ea at Eridu and Enlil at Nippur. He, however,
overlooked Anu at Erech, a fact which suggests that he held sway over
Eridu and

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nippur, but had to
recognize Erech as an independent city state.

Among the deities of Lagash, Ur-Nina favoured most the goddess Nina,
whose name he bore. As she was a water deity, and perhaps identical with
Belit-sheri, sister of "Tammuz of the Abyss" and daughter of Ea, one of
the canals was dedicated to her. She was also honoured with a new
temple, in which was probably placed her great statue, constructed by
special order of her royal worshipper. Like the Egyptian goddess, the
"Mother of Mendes", Nina received offerings of fish, not only as a
patroness of fishermen, but also as a corn spirit and a goddess of
maternity. She was in time identified with Ishtar.

A famous limestone plaque, which is preserved in the Louvre, Paris,
depicts on its upper half the pious King Ur-Nina engaged in the ceremony
of laying the foundations of a temple dedicated either to the goddess
Nina or to the god Nin-Girsu. His face and scalp are clean shaven, and
he has a prominent nose and firm mouth, eloquent of decision. The folds
of neck and jaw suggest Bismarckian traits. He is bare to the waist, and
wears a pleated kilt, with three flounces, which reaches almost to his
ankles. On his long head he has poised deftly a woven basket containing
the clay with which he is to make the first brick. In front of him stand
five figures. The foremost is honoured by being sculptured larger than
the others, except the prominent monarch. Apparently this is a royal
princess, for her head is unshaven, and her shoulder dress or long hair
drops over one of her arms. Her name is Lida, and the conspicuous part
she took in the ceremony suggests that she was the representative of the
goddess Nina. She is accompanied by her brothers, and at least one
official, Anita, the cup-bearer, or high

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

priest. The concluding part of this ceremony, or another ceremonial act,
is illustrated on the lower part of the plaque. Ur-Nina is seated on his
throne, not, as would seem at first sight, raising the wine cup to his
lips and toasting to the success of the work, but pouring out a libation
upon the ground. The princess is not present; the place of honour next
to the king is taken by the crown prince. Possibly in this case it is
the god Nin-Girsu who is being honoured. Three male figures, perhaps
royal sons, accompany the prominent crown prince. The cup-bearer is in
attendance behind the throne.

The inscription on this plaque, which is pierced in the centre so as to
be nailed to a sacred shrine, refers to the temples erected by Ur-Nina,
including those of Nina and Nin-Girsu.

After Ur-Nina's prosperous reign came to a close, his son Akurgal
ascended the throne. He had trouble with Umma, a powerful city, which
lay to the north-west of Lagash, between the Shatt-el-Kai and
Shatt-el-Hai canals. An army of raiders invaded his territory and had to
be driven back.

The next king, whose name was Eannatum, had Napoleonic characteristics.
He was a military genius with great ambitions, and was successful in
establishing by conquest a small but brilliant empire. Like his
grandfather, he strengthened the fortifications of Lagash; then he
engaged in a series of successful campaigns. Umma had been causing
anxiety in Lagash, but Eannatum stormed and captured that rival city,
appropriated one of its fertile plains, and imposed an annual tribute to
be paid in kind. An army of Elamites swept down from the hills, but
Ur-Nina's grandson inflicted upon these bold foreigners a crushing
defeat and pursued them over the frontier. Several cities were
afterwards forced to

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

come under the sway of triumphant Lagash, including Erech and Ur, and as
his suzerainty was already acknowledged at Eridu, Eannatum's power in
Sumeria became as supreme as it was firmly established.

Evidently Zuzu, king of the northern city of Opis, considered that the
occasion was opportune to overcome the powerful Sumerian conqueror, and
at the same time establish Semitic rule over the subdued and war-wasted
cities. He marched south with a large army, but the tireless and
ever-watchful Eannatum hastened to the fray, scattered the forces of
Opis, and captured the foolhardy Zuzu.

Eannatum's activities, however, were not confined to battlefields. At
Lagash he carried out great improvements in the interests of
agriculture; he constructed a large reservoir and developed the canal
system. He also extended and repaired existing temples in his native
city and at Erech. Being a patron of the arts, he encouraged sculpture
work, and the finest Sumerian examples belong to his reign.

Eannatum was succeeded by his brother, Enannatum I. Apparently the new
monarch did not share the military qualities of his royal predecessor,
for there were signs of unrest in the loose confederacy of states.
Indeed, Umma revolted. From that city an army marched forth and took
forcible possession of the plain which Eannatum had appropriated,
removing and breaking the landmarks, and otherwise challenging the
supremacy of the sovran state. A Lagash force defeated the men of Umma,
but appears to have done little more than hold in check their aggressive
tendencies.

No sooner had Entemena, the next king, ascended the throne than the
flame of revolt burst forth again. The Patesi of Umma, was evidently
determined to free, once

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

and for all, his native state from the yoke of Lagash. But he had
gravely miscalculated the strength of the vigorous young ruler. Entemena
inflicted upon the rebels a crushing defeat, and following up his
success, entered the walled city and captured and slew the patesi. Then
he took steps to stamp out the embers of revolt in Umma by appointing as
its governor one of his own officials, named Ili, who was duly installed
with great ceremony. Other military successes followed, including the
sacking of Opis and Kish, which assured the supremacy of Lagash for many
years. Entemena, with characteristic vigour, engaged himself during
periods of peace in strengthening his city fortifications and in
continuing the work of improving and developing the irrigation system.
He lived in the golden age of Sumerian art, and to his reign belongs the
exquisite silver vase of Lagash, which was taken from the Tello mound,
and is now in the Louvre. This votive offering was placed by the king in
the temple of Nin-Girsu. It is exquisitely shaped, and has a base of
copper. The symbolic decorations include the lion-headed eagle, which
was probably a form of the spring god of war and fertility, the lion,
beloved by the Mother goddess, and deer and ibexes, which recall the
mountain herds of Astarte. In the dedicatory inscription the king is
referred to as a patesi, and the fact that the name of the high priest,
Dudu, is given may be taken as an indication of the growing power of an
aggressive priesthood. After a brilliant reign of twenty-nine years the
king died, and was succeeded by his son, Enannatum II, who was the last
ruler of Ur-Nina's line. An obscure period ensued. Apparently there had
been a city revolt, which may have given the enemies of Lagash the
desired opportunity to gather strength for the coming conflict. There is
a reference to

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

an Elamite raid which, although repulsed, may be regarded as proof of
disturbed political conditions.

One or two priests sat on the throne of Lagash in brief succession, and
then arose to power the famous Urukagina, the first reformer in history.
He began to rule as patesi, but afterwards styled himself king. What
appears certain is that he was the leader of a great social upheaval,
which received the support of a section of the priesthood, for he
recorded that his elevation was due to the intercession of the god
Nin-Girsu. Other deities, who were sons and daughters of Nin-Girsu and
Nina, had been given recognition by his predecessors, and it is possible
that the orthodox section of Lagash, and especially the agricultural
classes, supported the new ruler in sweeping away innovations to which
they were hostile.

Like Khufu and his descendants, the Pyramid kings of Egypt's fourth
dynasty, the vigorous and efficient monarchs of the Ur-Nina dynasty of
Lagash were apparently remembered and execrated as tyrants and
oppressors of the people. To maintain many endowed temples and a
standing army the traders and agriculturists had been heavily taxed.
Each successive monarch who undertook public works on a large scale for
the purpose of extending and developing the area under cultivation,
appears to have done so mainly to increase the revenue of the exchequer,
so as to conserve the strength of the city and secure its pre-eminence
as a metropolis. A leisured class had come into existence, with the
result that culture was fostered and civilization advanced. Lagash seems
to have been intensely modern in character prior to 2800 B.C., but with
the passing of the old order of things there arose grave social problems
which never appear to have been seriously dealt with. All indications

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

of social unrest were, it would appear, severely repressed by the
iron-gloved monarchs of Ur-Nina's dynasty.

The people as a whole groaned under an ever-increasing burden of
taxation. Sumeria was overrun by an army of officials who were
notoriously corrupt; they do not appear to have been held in check, as
in Egypt, by royal auditors. "In the domain of Nin-Girsu", one of
Urukagina's tablets sets forth, "there were tax gatherers down to the
sea." They not only attended to the needs of the exchequer, but enriched
themselves by sheer robbery, while the priests followed their example by
doubling their fees and appropriating temple offerings to their own use.
The splendid organization of Lagash was crippled by the dishonesty of
those who should have been its main support.

Reforms were necessary and perhaps overdue, but, unfortunately for
Lagash, Urukagina's zeal for the people's cause amounted to fanaticism.
Instead of gradually re-adjusting the machinery of government so as to
secure equality of treatment without impairing its efficiency as a
defensive force in these perilous times, he inaugurated sweeping and
revolutionary social changes of far-reaching character regardless of
consequences. Taxes and temple fees were cut down, and the number of
officials reduced to a minimum. Society was thoroughly disorganized. The
army, which was recruited mainly from the leisured and official classes,
went practically out of existence, so that traders and agriculturists
obtained relief from taxation at the expense of their material security.

Urukagina's motives were undoubtedly above reproach, and he showed an
example to all who occupied positions of trust by living an upright life
and denying himself luxuries. He was disinterestedly pious, and built
and restored templed and acted as the steward of his god

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

with desire to promote the welfare and comfort of all true worshippers.
His laws were similar to those which over two centuries afterwards were
codified by Hammurabi, and like that monarch he was professedly the
guardian of the weak and the helper of the needy; he sought to establish
justice and liberty in the kingdom. But his social Arcadia vanished like
a dream because he failed to recognize that Right must be supported by
Might.

In bringing about his sudden social revolution, Urukagina had at the
same time unwittingly let loose the forces of disorder. Discontented and
unemployed officials, and many representatives of the despoiled leisured
and military classes of Lagash, no doubt sought refuge elsewhere, and
fostered the spirit of revolt which ever smouldered in subject states.
At any rate, Umma, remembering the oppressions of other days, was not
slow to recognize that the iron hand of Lagash had become unnerved. The
zealous and iconoclastic reformer had reigned but seven years when he
was called upon to defend his people against the invader. He appears to
have been utterly unprepared to do so. The victorious forces of Umma
swept against the stately city of Lagash and shattered its power in a
single day. Echoes of the great disaster which ensued rise from a pious
tablet inscription left by a priest, who was convinced that the
conquerors would be called to account for the sins they had committed
against the great god Nin-Girsu. He lamented the butchery and robbery
which had taken place. We gather from his composition that blood was
shed by the raiders of Umma even in the sacred precincts of temples,
that statues were shattered, that silver and precious stones were
carried away, that granaries were plundered and standing crops
destroyed, and that many buildings were set on fire. Amidst these
horrors of savagery and vengeance,

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

the now tragic figure of the great reformer suddenly vanishes from
before our eyes. Perhaps he perished in a burning temple; perhaps he
found a nameless grave with the thousands of his subjects whose bodies
had lain scattered about the blood-stained streets. With Urukagina the
glory of Lagash departed. Although the city was rebuilt in time, and was
even made more stately than before, it never again became the metropolis
of Sumeria.

The vengeful destroyer of Lagash was Lugal-zaggisi, Patesi of Umma, a
masterful figure in early Sumerian history. We gather from the tablet of
the unknown scribe, who regarded him as a sinner against the god
Nin-Girsu, that his city goddess was named Nidaba. He appears also to
have been a worshipper of Enlil of Nippur, to whose influence he
credited his military successes. But Enlil was not his highest god, he
was the interceder who carried the prayers of Lugal-zaggisi to the
beloved father, Anu, god of the sky. No doubt Nin-Girsu represented a
school of theology which was associated with unpleasant memories in
Umma. The sacking and burning of the temples of Lagash suggests as much.

Having broken the power of Lagash, Lugal-zaggisi directed his attention
to the rival city of Kish, where Semitic influence was predominating.
When Nanizak, the last monarch of the line of the famous Queen Azag-Bau,
had sat upon the throne for but three years, he perished by the sword of
the Umma conqueror. Nippur likewise came under his sway, and he also
subdued the southern cities.

Lugal-zaggisi chose for his capital ancient Erech, the city of Anu, and
of his daughter, the goddess Nana, who afterwards was identified with
Ishtar. Anu's spouse was Anatu, and the pair subsequently became
abstract deities, like Anshar and Kishar, their parents, who figure in
the

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Babylonian
Creation story. Nana was worshipped as the goddess of vegetation, and
her relation to Anu was similar to that of Belit-sheri to Ea at Eridu.
Anu and Ea were originally identical, but it would appear that the one
was differentiated as the god of the waters above the heaven and the
other as god of the waters beneath the earth, both being forms of
Anshar. Elsewhere the chief god of the spring sun or the moon, the lover
of the goddess, became pre-eminent, displacing the elder god, like
Nin-Girsu at Lagash. At Sippar the sun god, Babbar, whose Semitic name
was Shamash, was exalted as the chief deity, while the moon god remained
supreme at Ur. This specializing process, which was due to local
theorizing and the influence of alien settlers, has been dealt with in a
previous chapter.

In referring to himself as the favoured ruler of various city deities,
Lugal-zaggisi appears as a ruler of all Sumeria. How far his empire
extended it is impossible to determine with certainty. He appears to
have overrun Akkad, and even penetrated to the Syrian coast, for in one
inscription it is stated that he "made straight his path from the Lower
Sea (the Persian Gulf) over the Euphrates and Tigris to the Upper Sea
(the Mediterranean)". The allegiance of certain states, however,
depended on the strength of the central power. One of his successors
found it necessary to attack Kish, which was ever waiting for an
opportunity to regain its independence.

According to the Chronicle of Kish, the next ruler of Sumer and Akkad
after Lugal-zaggisi was the famous Sargon I. It would appear that he was
an adventurer or usurper, and that he owed his throne indirectly to
Lugal-zaggisi, who had dethroned the ruler of Akkad. Later traditions,
which have been partly confirmed by contemporary inscriptions, agree
that Sargon was of humble

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

birth. In the previous chapter reference was made to the Tammuz-like
myth attached to his memory. His mother was a vestal virgin dedicated to
the sun god, Shamash, and his father an unknown stranger from the
mountains--a suggestion of immediate Semitic affinities. Perhaps Sargon
owed his rise to power to the assistance received by bands of settlers
from the land of the Amorites, which Lugal-zaggisi had invaded.

According to the legend, Sargon's birth was concealed. He was placed in
a vessel which was committed to the river. Brought up by a commoner, he
lived in obscurity until the Semitic goddess, Ishtar, gave him her aid.

A similar myth was attached in India to the memory of Karna, the Hector
of that great Sanskrit epic the *Mahàbhàrata*. Karna's mother, the
Princess Pritha, who afterwards became a queen, was loved by the sun
god, Surya. When in secret she gave birth to her son she placed him in
an ark of wickerwork, which was set adrift on a stream. Ultimately it
reached the Ganges, and it was borne by that river to the country of
Anga, where the child was rescued by a woman and afterwards reared by
her and her husband, a charioteer. In time Karna became a great warrior,
and was crowned King of Anga by the Kaurava warriors. <span

Before he became king, Sargon of Akkad, the Sharrukin of the texts, was,
according to tradition, a gardener and watchman attached to the temple
of the war god Zamama of Kish. This deity was subsequently identified
with Merodach, son of Ea; Ninip, son of Enlil; and Nin-Girsu of Lagash.
He was therefore one of the many developed forms of Tammuz--a solar,
corn, and military deity, and an interceder for mankind. The goddess of
Kish appears to have been a form of Bau, as is

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

testified by the name of Queen Azag-Bau, the legendary founder of the
city.

Unfortunately our knowledge of Sargon's reign is of meagre character. It
is undoubted that he was a distinguished general and able ruler. He
built up an empire which included Sumer and Akkad, and also Amurru, "the
western land", or "land of the Amorites". The Elamites gave him an
opportunity to extend his conquests eastward. They appear to have
attacked Opis, but he drove them back, and on more than one occasion
penetrated their country, over the western part of which, known as
Anshan, he ultimately imposed his rule. Thither went many Semitic
settlers who had absorbed the culture of Sumeria.

During Sargon's reign Akkad attained to a splendour which surpassed that
of Babylon. In an omen text the monarch is lauded as the "highly exalted
one without a peer". Tradition relates that when he was an old man all
the Babylonian states rose in revolt against him and besieged Akkad. But
the old warrior led forth his army against the combined forces and
achieved a shattering victory.

Manishtusu, who succeeded Sargon I, had similarly to subdue a great
confederacy of thirty-two city states, and must therefore have been a
distinguished general. But he is best known as the monarch who purchased
several large estates adjoining subject cities, his aim having been
probably to settle on these Semitic allies who would be less liable to
rebel against him than the workers they displaced. For the latter,
however, he found employment elsewhere. These transactions, which were
recorded on a monument subsequently carried off with other spoils by the
Elamites and discovered at Susa, show that at this early period (about
2600 B.C.) even a

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

conquering monarch considered it advisable to observe existing land
laws. Urumush, <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_147.md) the next ruler,
also achieved successes in Elam and elsewhere, but his life was cut
short by a palace revolution.

The prominent figure of Naram Sin, a later king of Akkad, bulks largely
in history and tradition. According to the Chronicle of Kish, he was a
son of Sargon. Whether he was or not, it is certain that he inherited
the military and administrative genius of that famous ex-gardener. The
arts flourished during his reign. One of the memorable products of the
period was an exquisitely sculptured monument celebrating one of Naram
Sin's victories, which was discovered at Susa. It is one of the most
wonderful examples of Babylonian stone work which has come to light.

A successful campaign had been waged against a mountain people. The
stele shows the warrior king leading his army up a steep incline and
round the base of a great peak surmounted by stars. His enemies flee in
confusion before him. One lies on the ground clutching a spear which has
penetrated his throat, two are falling over a cliff, while others
apparently sue for mercy. Trees have been depicted to show that part of
the conquered territory is wooded. Naram Sin is armed with battleaxe and
bow, and his helmet is decorated with horns. The whole composition is
spirited and finely grouped; and the military bearing of the disciplined
troops contrasts sharply with the despairing attitudes of the fleeing
remnants of the defending army.

During this period the Semitized mountaineers to the north-east of
Babylonia became the most aggressive opponents of the city states. The
two most prominent were the Gutium, or men of Kutu, and the Lulubu.

STELE OF NARAM SIN

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

Naram Sin's great empire included the whole of Sumer and Akkad, Amurru
and northern Palestine, and part of Elam, and the district to the north.
He also penetrated Arabia, probably by way of the Persian Gulf, and
caused diorite to be quarried there. One of his steles, which is now in
the Imperial Ottoman Museum at Constantinople, depicts him as a fully
bearded man with Semitic characteristics. During his lifetime he was
deified--a clear indication of the introduction of foreign ideas, for
the Sumerians were not worshippers of kings and ancestors.

Naram Sin was the last great king of his line. Soon after his death the
power of Akkad went to pieces, and the Sumerian city of Erech again
became the centre of empire. Its triumph, however, was shortlived. After
a quarter of a century had elapsed, Akkad and Sumer were overswept by
the fierce Gutium from the north-eastern mountains. They sacked and
burned many cities, including Babylon, where the memory of the horrors
perpetrated by these invaders endured until the Grecian Age. An obscure
period, like the Egyptian Hyksos Age, ensued, but it was of
comparatively brief duration.

When the mists cleared away, the city Lagash once more came to the
front, having evidently successfully withstood the onslaughts of the
Gutium, but it never recovered the place of eminence it occupied under
the brilliant Ur-Nina dynasty. It is manifest that it must have enjoyed
under the various overlords, during the interval, a considerable degree
of independence, for its individuality remained unimpaired. Of all its
energetic and capable patesis, the most celebrated was Gudea, who
reigned sometime before 2400 B.C. In contrast to the Semitic Naram Sin,
he was beardless and pronouncedly Sumerian in aspect. His favoured
deity, the city god

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nin-Girsu, again
became prominent, having triumphed over his jealous rivals after
remaining in obscurity for three or four centuries. Trade flourished,
and the arts were fostered. Gudea had himself depicted, in one of the
most characteristic sculptures of his age, as an architect, seated
reverently with folded hands with a temple plan lying on his knees, and
his head uplifted as if watching the builders engaged in materializing
the dream of his life. The temple in which his interests were centred
was erected in honour of Nin-Girsu. Its ruins suggest that it was of
elaborate structure and great beauty. Like Solomon in later days, Gudea
procured material for his temple from many distant parts--cedar from
Lebanon, marble from Amurru, diorite from Arabia, copper from Elam, and
so forth. Apparently the King of Lagash was strong enough or wealthy
enough to command respect over a wide area.

Another city which also rose into prominence, amidst the shattered
Sumerian states, was Ur, the centre of moon worship. After Gudea's
death, its kings exercised sway over Lagash and Nippur, and, farther
south, over Erech and Larsa as well. This dynasty endured for nearly a
hundred and twenty years, during which Ur flourished like Thebes in
Egypt. Its monarchs styled themselves as "Kings of the Four Regions".
The worship of Nannar (Sin) became officially recognized at Nippur, the
seat of Enlil, during the reign of King Dungi of Ur; while at Erech, the
high priest of Anu, the sky god, became the high priest of the moon god.
Apparently matriarchal ideas, associated with lunar worship, again came
into prominence, for the king appointed two of his daughters to be
rulers of conquered states in Elam and Syria. In the latter half of his
reign, Dungi, the conqueror, was installed as high priest at Eridu. It

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

would thus appear that there was a renascence of early Sumerian
religious ideas. Ea, the god of the deep, had long been overshadowed,
but a few years before Dungi's death a temple was erected to him at
Nippur, where he was worshipped as Dagan. Until the very close of his
reign, which lasted for fifty-eight years, this great monarch of
tireless activity waged wars of conquest, built temples and palaces, and
developed the natural resources of Sumer and Akkad. Among his many
reforms was the introduction of standards of weights, which received
divine sanction from the moon god, who, as in Egypt, was the measurer
and regulator of human transactions and human life.

To this age also belongs many of the Sumerian business and legal
records, which were ultimately carried off to Susa, where they have been
recovered by French excavators.

About half a century after Dungi's death the Dynasty of Ur came to an
end, its last king having been captured by an Elamite force.

At some time subsequent to this period, Abraham migrated from Ur to the
northern city of Harran, where the moon god was also the chief city
deity--the Baal, or "lord". It is believed by certain Egyptologists that
Abraham sojourned in Egypt during its Twelfth Dynasty, which, according
to the Berlin system of minimum dating, extended from about 2000 B.C.
till 1780 B.C. The Hebrew patriarch may therefore have been a
contemporary of Hammurabi's, who is identified with Amraphel, king of
Shinar (Sumer) in the Bible. <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_148.md)

But after the decline of Ur's ascendancy, and long before Babylon's
great monarch came to the throne, the centre of power in Sumeria was
shifted to Isin, where

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

sixteen kings flourished for two and a quarter centuries. Among the
royal names, recognition was given to Ea and Dagan, Sin, Enlil, and
Ishtar, indicating that Sumerian religion in its Semitized corm was
receiving general recognition. The sun god was identical with Ninip and
Nin-Girsu, a god of fertility, harvest, and war, but now more fully
developed and resembling Babbar, "the shining one", the solar deity of
Akkadian Sippar, whose Semitic name was Shamash. As Shamash was
ultimately developed as the god of justice and righteousness, it would
appear that his ascendancy occurred during the period when well-governed
communities systematized their religious beliefs to reflect social
conditions.

The first great monarch of the Isin dynasty was Ishbi-Urra, who reigned
for thirty-two years. Like his successors, he called himself "King of
Sumer and Akkad", and it appears that his sway extended to the city of
Sippar, where solar worship prevailed. Traces of him have also been
found at Eridu, Ur, Erech, and Nippur, so that he must have given
recognition to Ea, Sin, Anu, and Enlil. In this period the early
national pantheon may have taken shape, Bel Enlil being the chief deity.
Enlil was afterwards displaced by Merodach of Babylon.

Before 2200 B.C. there occurred a break in the supremacy of Isin.
Gungunu, King of Ur, combined with Larsa, whose sun temple he restored,
and declared himself ruler of Sumer and Akkad. But Isin again gathered
strength under Ur-Ninip, who was not related to his predecessor. Perhaps
he came from Nippur, where the god Ninip was worshipped as the son of
Bel Enlil.

According to a Babylonian document, a royal grand-son of Ur-Ninip's,
having no direct heir, selected as his successor his gardener,
Enlil-bani. He placed the crown on the head of this obscure individual,
abdicated in his

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

favour, and then died a mysterious death within his palace.

It is highly probable that Enlil-bani, whose name signifies "Enlil is my
creator", was a usurper like Sargon of Akkad, and he may have similarly
circulated a myth regarding his miraculous origin to justify his sudden
rise to power. The truth appears to be that he came to the throne as the
leader of a palace revolution at a time of great unrest. But he was not
allowed to remain in undisputed possession. A rival named Sin-ikisha,
evidently a moon worshipper and perhaps connected with Ur, displaced the
usurper, and proclaimed himself king. After a brief reign of six months
he was overthrown, however, by Enlil-bani, who piously credited his
triumph over his enemy to the chief god of Nippur, whose name he bore.
Although he took steps to secure his position by strengthening the
fortifications of Isin, and reigned for about a quarter of a century, he
was not succeeded by his heir, if he had one. King Zambia, who was no
relation, followed him, but his reign lasted for only three years. The
names of the next two kings are unknown. Then came Sin-magir, who was
succeeded by Damik-ilishu, the last King of Isin.

Towards the close of Damik-ilishu's reign of twenty-four years he came
under the suzerainty of Larsa, whose ruler was Rim Sin. Then Isin was
captured by Sin-muballit, King of Babylon, the father of the great
Hammurabi. Rim Sin was an Elamite.

Afterwards the old order of things passed away. Babylon became the
metropolis, the names of Sumer and Akkad dropped out of use, and the
whole country between the rivers was called Babylonia. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_149.md) The various systems of

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

law which obtained in the different states were then codified by
Hammurabi, who appointed governors in all the cities which came under
his sway to displace the patesis and kings. A new national pantheon of
representative character was also formed, over which Merodach (Marduk),
the city god of Babylon, presided. How this younger deity was supposed
to rise to power is related in the Babylonian legend of Creation, which
is dealt with in the [next chapter](mba13.htm#an_ch-07.md). <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_150.md) In framing this myth from the fragments
of older myths, divine sanction was given to the supremacy achieved by
Merodach's city. The allegiance of future generations was thus secured,
not only by the strong arm of the law, but also by the combined
influence of the reorganized priesthoods at the various centres of
administration.

An interesting problem, which should be referred to here, arises in
connection with the sculptured representations of deities before and
after the rise of Akkad as a great Power. It is found, although the
Sumerians shaved their scalps and faces at the dawn of the historical
age, that they worshipped gods who had long hair and also beards, which
were sometimes square and sometimes pointed.

At what period the Sumerian deities were given human shape it is
impossible to determine. As has been shown ([Chapters
II](mba08.htm#an_ch-02) and [III](mba09.htm#an_ch-03).md) all the chief
gods and goddesses had animal forms and composite monster forms before
they became anthropomorphic deities. Ea had evidently a fish shape ere
he was clad in the skin of a fish, as an Egyptian god was simply a bull
before he was depicted in human shape wearing a bull's skin. The archaic
Sumerian animal and composite monster gods of animistic

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

and totemic origin survived after the anthropomorphic period as mythical
figures, which were used for decorative or magical purposes and as
symbols. A form of divine headdress was a cap enclosed in horns, between
which appeared the soaring lion-headed eagle, which symbolized
Nin-Girsu. This god had also lion and antelope forms, which probably
figured in lost myths--perhaps they were like the animals loved by
Ishtar and referred to in the Gilgamesh epic. Similarly the winged bull
was associated with the moon god Nannar, or Sin, of Ur, who was "a
horned steer". On various cylinder seals appear groups of composite
monsters and rearing wild beasts, which were evidently representations
of gods and demons in conflict.

Suggestive data for comparative study is afforded in this connection by
ancient Egypt. Sokar, the primitive Memphite deity, retained until the
end his animal and composite monster forms. Other gods were depicted
with human bodies and the heads of birds, serpents, and crocodiles, thus
forming links between the archaic demoniac and the later anthropomorphic
deities. A Sumerian example is the deified Ea-bani, who, like Pan, has
the legs and hoofs of a goat.

The earliest representations of Sumerian humanized deities appear on
reliefs from Tello, the site of Lagash. These examples of archaic gods,
however, are not bearded in Semitic fashion. On the contrary, their lips
and cheeks are shaved, while an exaggerated chin tuft is retained. The
explanation suggested is that the Sumerians gave their deities human
shape before they themselves were clean shaven, and that the retention
of the characteristic facial hair growth of the Mediterranean Race is
another example of the conservatism of the religious instinct. In Egypt
the clean-shaven Pharaohs, who represented gods, wore false chin-tuft
beards; even Queen

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hatshepsut
considered it necessary to assume a beard on state occasions.
Ptah-Osiris retained his archaic beard until the Ptolemaic period.

It seems highly probable that in similarly depicting their gods with
beards, the early Sumerians were not influenced by the practices of any
alien people or peoples. Not until the period of Gudea, the Patesi of
Lagash, did they give their gods heavy moustaches, side whiskers, and
flowing beards of Semitic type. It may be, however, that by then they
had completely forgotten the significance of an ancient custom.
Possibly, too, the sculptors of Lagash were working under the influence
of the Akkadian school of art, which had produced the exquisite stele of
victory for Naram-Sin, and consequently adopted the conventional Semitic
treatment of bearded figures. At any rate, they were more likely to
study and follow the artistic triumphs of Akkad than the crude
productions of the archaic period. Besides, they lived in an age when
Semitic kings were deified and the Semitic overlords had attained to
great distinction and influence.

The Semitic folks were not so highly thought of in the early Sumerian
period. It is not likely that the agricultural people regarded as models
of gods the plunderers who descended from the hills, and, after
achieving successes, returned home with their spoils. More probably they
regarded them as "foreign devils". Other Semites, however, who came as
traders, bringing wood, stone, and especially copper, and formed
communities in cities, may well have influenced Sumerian religious
thought. The god Ramman, for instance, who was given recognition all
through Babylonia, was a god of hill folks as far north as Asia Minor
and throughout Syria. He may have been introduced by settlers who
adopted Sumerian

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

habits of life and shaved scalp and face. But although the old cities
could never have existed in a complete state of isolation from the outer
world, it is unlikely that their inhabitants modelled their deities on
those worshipped by groups of aliens. A severe strain is imposed on our
credulity if we are expected to believe that it was due to the teachings
and example of uncultured nomads that the highly civilized Sumerians
developed their gods from composite monsters to anthropomorphic deities.
Such a supposition, at any rate, is not supported by the evidence of
Ancient Egypt.
