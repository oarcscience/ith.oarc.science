ANCIENT Babylonia was for over four thousand years the garden of Western
Asia. In the days of Hezekiah and Isaiah, when it had come under the
sway of the younger civilization of Assyria on the north, it was "a land
of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and
of honey". <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md) Herodotus found it still
flourishing and extremely fertile. "This territory", he wrote, "is of
all that we know the best by far for producing grain; it is so good that
it returns as much as two hundredfold for the average, and, when it
bears at its best, it produces three hundredfold. The blades of the
wheat and barley there grow to be full four fingers broad;

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

and from millet and sesame seed, how large a tree grows, I know myself,
but shall not record, being well aware that even what has already been
said relating to the crops produced has been enough to cause disbelief
in those who have not visited Babylonia." <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) To-day great tracts of undulating
moorland, which aforetime yielded two and three crops a year, are in
summer partly barren wastes and partly jungle and reedy swamp. Bedouins
camp beside sandy heaps which were once populous and thriving cities,
and here and there the shrunken remnants of a people once great and
influential eke out precarious livings under the oppression of Turkish
tax-gatherers who are scarcely less considerate than the plundering
nomads of the desert.

This historic country is bounded on the east by Persia and on the west
by the Arabian desert. In shape somewhat resembling a fish, it lies
between the two great rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, too miles
wide at its broadest part, and narrowing to 35 miles towards the "tail"
in the latitude of Baghdad; the "head" converges to a point above Basra,
where the rivers meet and form the Shatt-el-Arab, which pours into the
Persian Gulf after meeting the Karun and drawing away the main volume of
that double-mouthed river. The distance from Baghdad to Basra is about
300 miles, and the area traversed by the Shatt-el-Arab is slowly
extending at the rate of a mile every thirty years or so, as a result of
the steady accumulation of silt and mud carried down by the Tigris and
Euphrates. When Sumeria was beginning to flourish, these two rivers had
separate outlets, and Eridu, the seat of the cult of the sea god Ea,
which now lies 125 miles inland, was a seaport at the head of the
Persian Gulf. A day's journey separated the river mouths when

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Alexander the
Great broke the power of the Persian Empire.

In the days of Babylonia's prosperity the Euphrates was hailed as "the
soul of the land" and the Tigris as "the bestower of blessings". Skilful
engineers had solved the problem of water distribution by irrigating
sun-parched areas and preventing the excessive flooding of those
districts which are now rendered impassable swamps when the rivers
overflow. A network of canals was constructed throughout the country,
which restricted the destructive tendencies of the Tigris and Euphrates
and developed to a high degree their potentialities as fertilizing
agencies. The greatest of these canals appear to have been anciently
river beds. One, which is called Shatt en Nil to the north, and Shatt el
Kar to the south, curved eastward from Babylon, and sweeping past
Nippur, flowed like the letter **S** towards Larsa and then rejoined the
river. It is believed to mark the course followed in the early Sumerian
period by the Euphrates river, which has moved steadily westward many
miles beyond the sites of ancient cities that were erected on its banks.
Another important canal, the Shatt el Hai, crossed the plain from the
Tigris to its sister river, which lies lower at this point, and does not
run so fast. Where the artificial canals were constructed on higher
levels than the streams which fed them, the water was raised by
contrivances known as "shaddufs"; the buckets or skin bags were roped to
a weighted beam, with the aid of which they were swung up by workmen and
emptied into the canals. It is possible that this toilsome mode of
irrigation was substituted in favourable parts by the primitive water
wheels which are used in our own day by the inhabitants of the country
who cultivate strips of land along the river banks.

In Babylonia there are two seasons--the rainy and

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

the dry. Rain falls from November till March, and the plain is carpeted
in spring by patches of vivid green verdure and brilliant wild flowers.
Then the period of drought ensues; the sun rapidly burns up all
vegetation, and everywhere the eye is wearied by long stretches of brown
and yellow desert. Occasional sandstorms darken the heavens, sweeping
over sterile wastes and piling up the shapeless mounds which mark the
sites of ancient cities. Meanwhile the rivers are increasing in volume,
being fed by the melting snows at their mountain sources far to the
north. The swift Tigris, which is 1146 miles long, begins to rise early
in March and reaches its highest level in May; before the end of June it
again subsides. More sluggish in movement, the Euphrates, which is 1780
miles long, shows signs of rising a fortnight later than the Tigris, and
is in flood for a more extended period; it does not shrink to its lowest
level until early in September. By controlling the flow of these mighty
rivers, preventing disastrous floods, and storing and distributing
surplus water, the ancient Babylonians developed to the full the natural
resources of their country, and made it--what it may once again
become--one of the fairest and most habitable areas in the world. Nature
conferred upon them bountiful rewards for their labour; trade and
industries flourished, and the cities increased in splendour and
strength. Then as now the heat was great during the long summer, but
remarkably dry and unvarying, while the air was ever wonderfully
transparent under cloudless skies of vivid blue. The nights were cool
and of great beauty, whether in brilliant moonlight or when ponds and
canals were jewelled by the lustrous displays of clear and numerous
stars which glorified that homeland of the earliest astronomers.

Babylonia is a treeless country, and timber had to be

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

imported from the earliest times. The date palm was probably introduced
by man, as were certainly the vine and the fig tree, which were widely
cultivated, especially in the north. Stone, suitable for building, was
very scarce, and limestone, alabaster, marble, and basalt had to be
taken from northern Mesopotamia, where the mountains also yield copper
and lead and iron. Except Eridu, where ancient workers quarried
sandstone from its sea-shaped ridge, all the cities were built of brick,
an excellent clay being found in abundance. When brick walls were
cemented with bitumen they were given great stability. This resinous
substance is found in the north and south. It bubbles up through
crevices of rocks on river banks and forms small ponds. Two famous
springs at modern Hit, on the Euphrates, have been drawn upon from time
immemorial. "From one", writes a traveller, "flows hot water black with
bitumen, while the other discharges intermittently bitumen, or, after a
rainstorm, bitumen and cold water. . . . Where rocks crop out in the
plain above Hit, they are full of seams of bitumen." <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) Present-day Arabs call it "kiyara", and
export it for coating boats and roofs; they also use it as an
antiseptic, and apply it to cure the skin diseases from which camels
suffer.

Sumeria had many surplus products, including corn and figs, pottery,
fine wool and woven garments, to offer in exchange for what it most
required from other countries. It must, therefore, have had a brisk and
flourishing foreign trade at an exceedingly remote period. No doubt
numerous alien merchants were attracted to its cities, and it may be
that they induced or encouraged Semitic and other raiders to overthrow
governments and form military aristocracies, so that they themselves
might obtain necessary concessions and achieve a degree of

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

political ascendancy. It does not follow, however, that the peasant
class was greatly affected by periodic revolutions of this kind, which
brought little more to them than a change of rulers. The needs of the
country necessitated the continuance of agricultural methods and the
rigid observance of existing land laws; indeed, these constituted the
basis of Sumerian prosperity. Conquerors have ever sought reward not
merely in spoil, but also the services of the conquered. In northern
Babylonia the invaders apparently found it necessary to conciliate and
secure the continued allegiance of the tillers of the soil. Law and
religion being closely associated, they had to adapt their gods to suit
the requirements of existing social and political organizations. A deity
of pastoral nomads had to receive attributes which would give him an
agricultural significance; one of rural character had to be changed to
respond to the various calls of city life. Besides, local gods could not
be ignored on account of their popularity. As a result, imported beliefs
and religious customs must have been fused and absorbed according to
their bearing on modes of life in various localities. It is probable
that the complex character of certain deities was due to the process of
adjustment to which they were subjected in new environments.

The petty kingdoms of Sumeria appear to have been tribal in origin. Each
city was presided over by a deity who was the nominal owner of the
surrounding arable land, farms were rented or purchased from the
priesthood, and pasture was held in common. As in Egypt, where we find,
for instance, the artisan god Ptah supreme at Memphis, the sun god Ra at
Heliopolis, and the cat goddess Bast at Bubastis, the various local
Sumerian and Akkadian deities had distinctive characteristics, and
similarly showed a tendency to absorb the attributes of their

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

rivals. The chief deity of a state was the central figure in a pantheon,
which had its political aspect and influenced the growth of local
theology. Cities, however, did not, as a rule, bear the names of
deities, which suggests that several were founded when Sumerian religion
was in its early animistic stages, and gods and goddesses were not
sharply defined from the various spirit groups.

A distinctive and characteristic Sumerian god was Ea, who was supreme at
the ancient sea-deserted port of Eridu. He is identified with the Oannes
of Berosus, <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) who referred to the
deity as "a creature endowed with reason, with a body like that of a
fish, with feet below like those of a man, with a fish's tail". This
description recalls the familiar figures of Egyptian gods and priests
attired in the skins of the sacred animals from whom their powers were
derived, and the fairy lore about swan maids and men, and the seals and
other animals who could divest themselves of their "skin coverings" and
appear in human shape. Originally Ea may have been a sacred fish. The
Indian creative gods Brahma and Vishnu had fish forms. In Sanskrit
literature Manu, the eponymous "first man", is instructed by the fish to
build a ship in which to save himself when the world would be purged by
the rising waters. Ea befriended in similar manner the Babylonian Noah,
called Pir-napishtim, advising him to build a vessel so as to be
prepared for the approaching Deluge. Indeed the Indian legend appears to
throw light on the original Sumerian conception of Ea. It relates that
when the fish was small and in danger of being swallowed by other fish
in a stream it appealed to Manu for protection. The

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

sage at once lifted up the fish and placed it in a jar of water. It
gradually increased in bulk, and he transferred it next to a tank and
then to the river Ganges. In time the fish complained to Manu that the
river was too small for it, so he carried it to the sea. For these
services the god in fish form instructed Manu regarding the approaching
flood, and afterwards piloted his ship through the weltering waters
until it rested on a mountain top. <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md)

If this Indian myth is of Babylonian origin, as appears probable, it may
be that the spirit of the river Euphrates, "the soul of the land", was
identified with a migrating fish. The growth of the fish suggests the
growth of the river rising in flood. In Celtic folk tales high tides and
valley floods are accounted for by the presence of a "great beast" in
sea, loch, or river. In a class of legends, "specially connected with
the worship of Atargatis", wrote Professor Robertson Smith, "the divine
life of the waters resides in the sacred fish that inhabit them.
Atargatis and her son, according to a legend common to Hierapolis and
Ascalon, plunged into the waters--in the first case the Euphrates, in
the second the sacred pool at the temple near the town--and were changed
into fishes". The idea is that "where a god dies, that is, ceases to
exist in human form, his life passes into the waters where he is buried;
and this again is merely a theory to bring the divine water or the
divine fish into harmony with anthropomorphic ideas. The same thing was
sometimes effected in another way by saying that the anthropomorphic
deity was born from the water, as Aphrodite sprang from sea foam, or as
Atargatis, in another form of the Euphrates legend, . . . was born of an
egg which the sacred fishes found in the Euphrates and pushed
ashore." <span id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md)

As "Shar Apsi", Ea was the "King of the Watery

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Deep". The
reference, however, according to Jastrow, "is not to the salt ocean, but
the sweet waters flowing under the earth which feed the streams, and
through streams and canals irrigate the fields". <span
id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) As Babylonia was fertilized by its rivers,
Ea, the fish god, was a fertilizing deity. In Egypt the "Mother of
Mendes" is depicted carrying a fish upon her head; she links with Isis
and Hathor; her husband is Ba-neb-Tettu, a form of Ptah, Osiris, and Ra,
and as a god of fertility he is symbolized by the ram. Another Egyptian
fish deity was the god Rem, whose name signifies "to weep"; he wept
fertilizing tears, and corn was sown and reaped amidst lamentations. He
may be identical with Remi, who was a phase of Sebek, the crocodile god,
a developed attribute of Nu, the vague primitive Egyptian deity who
symbolized the primordial deep. The connection between a fish god and a
corn god is not necessarily remote when we consider that in Babylonia
and Egypt the harvest was the gift of the rivers.

The Euphrates, indeed, was hailed as a creator of all that grew on its
banks.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">O thou River who didst create all things,

O River, thou art mighty! O River, thou art supreme!  
O River, thou art righteous! <span id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md)</span>

</div>

In serving Ea, the embodiment or the water spirit, by leading him, as
the Indian Manu led the Creator and "Preserver" in fish form, from river
to water pot, water pot to pond or canal, and then again to river and
ocean,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

the Babylonians became expert engineers and experienced agriculturists,
the makers of bricks, the builders of cities, the framers of laws.
Indeed, their civilization was a growth of Ea worship. Ea was their
instructor. Berosus states that, as Oannes, he lived in the Persian
Gulf, and every day came ashore to instruct the inhabitants of Eridu how
to make canals, to grow crops, to work metals, to make pottery and
bricks, and to build temples; he was the artisan god--Nun-ura, "god of
the potter"; Kuski-banda, "god of goldsmiths", &c.--the divine patron of
the arts and crafts. "Ea knoweth everything", chanted the hymn maker. He
taught the people how to form and use alphabetic signs and instructed
them in mathematics: he gave them their code of laws. Like the Egyptian
artisan god Ptah, and the linking deity Khnumu, Ea was the "potter or
moulder of gods and man". Ptah moulded the first man on his potter's
wheel: he also moulded the sun and moon; he shaped the universe and
hammered out the copper sky. Ea built the world "as an architect builds
a house". <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) Similarly the Vedic Indra,
who wielded a hammer like Ptah, fashioned the universe after the simple
manner in which the Aryans made their wooden dwellings. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_36.md)

Like Ptah, Ea also developed from an artisan god into a sublime Creator
in the highest sense, not merely as a producer of crops. His word became
the creative force; he named those things he desired to be, and they
came into existence. "Who but Ea creates things", exclaimed a priestly
poet. This change from artisan god to creator (Nudimmud) may have been
due to the tendency of early religious cults to attach to their chief
god the attributes of rivals exalted at other centres.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

Ea, whose name is also rendered Aa, was identified with Ya, Ya’u, or Au,
the Jah of the Hebrews. "In Ya-Daganu, 'Jah is Dagon'", writes Professor
Pinches, "we have the elements reversed, showing a wish to identify Jah
with Dagon, rather than Dagon with Jah; whilst another interesting name,
Au-Aa, shows an identification of Jah with Aa, two names which have
every appearance of being etymologically connected." Jah's name "is one
of the words for 'god' in the Assyro-Babylonian language". <span
id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md)

Ea was "Enki", "lord of the world", or "lord of what is beneath";
Amma-ana-ki, "lord of heaven and earth"; Sa-kalama, "ruler of the land",
as well as Engur, "god of the abyss", Naqbu, "the deep", and Lugal-ida,
"king of the river". As rain fell from "the waters above the firmament",
the god of waters was also a sky and earth god.

The Indian Varuna was similarly a sky as well as an ocean god before the
theorizing and systematizing Brahmanic teachers relegated him to a
permanent abode at the bottom of the sea. It may be that Ea-Oannes and
Varuna were of common origin.

Another Babylonian deity, named Dagan, is believed to be identical with
Ea. His worship was certainly of great antiquity. "Hammurabi", writes
Professor Pinches, "seems to speak of the Euphrates as being 'the
boundary of Dagan', whom he calls his creator. In later inscriptions the
form Daguna, which approaches nearer to the West Semitic form (Dagon of
the Philistines), is found in a few personal names. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md)

It is possible that the Philistine deity Dagon was a

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

specialized form of ancient Ea, who was either imported from Babylonia
or was a sea god of more than one branch of the Mediterranean race. The
authorities are at variance regarding the form and attributes of Dagan.
Our know-ledge regarding him is derived mainly from the Bible. He was a
national rather than a city god. There are references to a
Beth-dagon <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md), "house or city of
Dagon"; he had also a temple at Gaza, and Samson destroyed it by pulling
down the two middle pillars which were its main support. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40.md) A third temple was situated in Ashdod.
When the captured ark of the Israelites was placed in it the image of
Dagon "fell on his face", with the result that "the head of Dagon and
both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the
stump of Dagon was left". <span id="fr_41"></span>[3](#fn_41.md) A further
reference to "the threshold of Dagon" suggests that the god had feet
like Ea-Oannes. Those who hold that Dagon had a fish form derive his
name from the Semitic "dag = a fish", and suggest that after the idol
fell only the fishy part (dāgo) was left. On the other hand, it was
argued that Dagon was a corn god, and that the resemblance between the
words Dagan and Dagon are accidental. Professor Sayce makes reference in
this connection to a crystal seal from Phoenicia in the Ashmolean
Museum, Oxford, bearing an inscription which he reads as Baal-dagon.
Near the name is an ear of corn, and other symbols, such as the winged
solar disc, a gazelle, and several stars, but there is no fish. It may
be, of course, that Baal-dagon represents a fusion of deities. As we
have seen in the case of Ea-Oannes and the deities of Mendes, a fish god
may also be a corn god, a land animal god and a god of ocean and the
sky. The offering of golden mice representing "your mice that mar the

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

land", <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) made by the Philistines,
suggests that Dagon was the fertilizing harvest god, among other things,
whose usefulness had been impaired, as they believed, by the mistake
committed of placing the ark of Israel in the temple at Ashdod. The
Philistines came from Crete, and if their Dagon was imported from that
island, he may have had some connection with Poseidon, whose worship
extended throughout Greece. This god of the sea, who is somewhat like
the Roman Neptune, carried a lightning trident and caused earthquakes.
He was a brother of Zeus, the sky and atmosphere deity, and had bull and
horse forms. As a horse he pursued Demeter, the earth and corn goddess,
and, like Ea, he instructed mankind, but especially in the art of
training horses. In his train were the Tritons, half men, half fishes,
and the water fairies, the Nereids. Bulls, boars, and rams were offered
to this sea god of fertility. Amphitrite was his spouse.

An obscure god Shony, the Oannes of the Scottish Hebrides, received
oblations from those who depended for their agricultural prosperity on
his gifts of fertilizing seaweed. He is referred to in Martin's *Western
Isles*, and is not yet forgotten. The Eddie sea god Njord of Noatun was
the father of Frey, the harvest god. Dagda, the Irish corn god, had for
wife Boann, the goddess of the river Boyne. Osiris and Isis of Egypt
were associated with the Nile. The connection between agriculture and
the water supply was too obvious to escape the early symbolists, and
many other proofs of this than those referred to could be given.

Ea's "faithful spouse" was the goddess Damkina, who was also called
Nin-ki, "lady of the earth". "May Ea make thee glad", chanted the
priests. "May Damkina, queen of the deep, illumine thee with her
countenance;

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

may Merodach (Marduk), the mighty overseer of the Igigi (heavenly
spirits), exalt thy head." Merodach was their son: in time he became the
Bel, or "Lord", of the Babylonian pantheon.

Like the Indian Varuna, the sea god, Ea-Oannes had control over the
spirits and demons of the deep. The "ferryman" who kept watch over the
river of death was called Arad-Ea, "servant of Ea". There are also
references to sea maidens, the Babylonian mermaids, or Nereids. We have
a glimpse of sea giants, which resemble the Indian Danavas and Daityas
of ocean, in the chant:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Seven are they, seven are they,  
In the ocean deep seven are they,  
Battening in heaven seven are they,  
Bred in the depths of ocean. . . .  
Of these seven the first is the south wind,  
The second a dragon with mouth agape. . . . <span
id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md)</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A suggestion of
the Vedic Vritra and his horde of monsters.

These seven demons were also "the messengers of Anu", who, although
specialized as a sky god in more than one pantheon, appears to have been
closely associated with Ea in the earliest Sumerian period. His name,
signifying "the high one", is derived from "ana", "heaven"; he was the
city god of Erech (Uruk). It is possible that he was developed as an
atmospheric god with solar and lunar attributes. The seven demons, who
were his messengers, recall the stormy Maruts, the followers of Indra.
They are referred to as

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Forcing their way with baneful windstorms,  
Mighty destroyers, the deluge of the storm god,  
Stalking at the right hand of the storm god. <span
id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

When we deal with a deity in his most archaic form it is difficult to
distinguish him from a demon. Even the beneficent Ea is associated with
monsters and furies. "Evil spirits", according to a Babylonian chant,
were "the bitter venom of the gods". Those attached to a deity as
"attendants" appear to represent the original animistic group from which
he evolved. In each district the character of the deity was shaped to
accord with local conditions.

At Nippur, which was situated on the vague and shifting boundary line
between Sumer and Akkad, the chief god was Enlil, whose name is
translated "lord of mist", "lord of might", and "lord of demons" by
various authorities. He was a storm god and a war god, and "lord of
heaven and earth", like Ea and Anu. An atmospheric deity, he shares the
attributes of the Indian Indra, the thunder and rain god, and Vayu, the
wind god; he also resembles the Semitic Adad or Rim-man, who links with
the Hittite Tarku. All these are deities of tempest and the
mountains--Wild Huntsmen in the Raging Host. The name of Enlil's temple
at Nippur has been translated as "mountain house", or "like a mountain",
and the theory obtained for a time that the god must therefore have been
imported by a people from the hills. But as the ideogram for "mountain"
and "land" was used in the earliest times, as King shows, with reference
to foreign countries, <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md) it is more
probable that Enlil was exalted as a world god who had dominion over not
only Sumer and Akkad, but also the territories occupied by the rivals
and enemies of the early Babylonians.

Enlil is known as the "older Bel" (lord), to distinguish him from Bel
Merodach of Babylon. He was

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

the chief figure in a triad in which he figured as earth god, with Anu
as god of the sky and Ea as god of the deep. This classification
suggests that Nippur had either risen in political importance and
dominated the cities of Erech and Eridu, or that its priests were
influential at the court of a ruler who was the overlord of several city
states.

Associated with Bel Enlil was Beltis, later known as "Beltu--the lady".
She appears to be identical with the other great goddesses, Ishtar,
Nana, Zer-panitu<sup>m</sup>, &c., a "Great Mother", or consort of an
early god with whom she was equal in power and dignity.

In the later systematized theology of the Babylonians we seem to trace
the fragments of a primitive mythology which was vague in outline, for
the deities were not sharply defined, and existed in groups. Enneads
were formed in Egypt by placing a local god at the head of a group of
eight elder deities. The sun god Ra was the chief figure of the earliest
pantheon of this character at Heliopolis, while at Hermopolis the leader
was the lunar god Thoth. Professor Budge is of opinion that "both the
Sumerians and the early Egyptians derived their primeval gods from some
common but exceedingly ancient source", for he finds in the Babylonian
and Nile valleys that there is a resemblance between two early groups
which "seems to be too close to be accidental". <span
id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md)

The Egyptian group comprises four pairs of vague gods and goddesses--Nu
and his consort Nut, Hehu and his consort Hehut, Kekui and his consort
Kekuit, and Kerh and his consort Kerhet. "Man always has fashioned", he
says, "and probably always will fashion, his god or gods in his own
image, and he has always, having reached a certain stage in development,
given to his gods wives

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

and offspring; but the nature of the position taken by the wives of the
gods depends upon the nature of the position of women in the households
of those who write the legends and the traditions of the gods. The gods
of the oldest company in Egypt were, the writer believes, invented by
people in whose households women held a high position, and among whom
they possessed more power than is usually the case with Oriental
peoples." <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md)

We cannot say definitely what these various deities represent. Nu was
the spirit of the primordial deep, and Nut of the waters above the
heavens, the mother of moon and sun and the stars. The others were
phases of light and darkness and the forces of nature in activity and
repose.

Nu is represented in Babylonian mythology by Apsu-Rishtu, and Nut by
Mummu-Tiamat or Tiawath; the next pair is Lachmu and Lachamu, and the
third, Anshar and Kishar. The fourth pair is missing, but the names of
Anu and Ea (as Nudimmud) are mentioned in the first tablet of the
Creation series, and the name of a third is lost. Professor Budge thinks
that the Assyrian editors substituted the ancient triad of Anu, Ea, and
Enlil for the pair which would correspond to those found in Egypt.
Originally the wives of Anu and Ea may have made up the group of eight
primitive deities.

There can be little doubt but that Ea, as he survives to us, is of later
characterization than the first pair of primitive deities who symbolized
the deep. The attributes of this beneficent god reflect the progress,
and the social and moral ideals of a people well advanced in
civilization. He rewarded mankind for the services they rendered to him;
he was their leader and instructor; he achieved for them the victories
over the destructive forces

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

of nature. In brief, he was the dragon slayer, a distinction, by the
way, which was attached in later times to his son Merodach, the
Babylonian god, although Ea was still credited with the victory over the
dragon's husband.

When Ea was one of the pre-Babylonian group--the triad of Bel-Enlil,
Anu, and Ea--he resembled the Indian Vishnu, the Preserver, while
Bel-Enlil resembled Shiva, the Destroyer, and Anu, the father, supreme
Brahma, the Creator and Father of All, the difference in exact
adjustment being due, perhaps, to Sumerian political conditions.

Ea, as we have seen, symbolized the beneficence of the waters; their
destructive force was represented by Tiamat or Tiawath, the dragon, and
Apsu, her husband, the arch-enemy of the gods. We shall find these elder
demons figuring in the Babylonian Creation myth, which receives
treatment in a later chapter.

The ancient Sumerian city of Eridu, which means "on the seashore", was
invested with great sanctity from the earliest times, and Ea, the "great
magician of the gods", was invoked by workers of spells, the priestly
magicians of historic Babylonia. Excavations have shown that Eridu was
protected by a retaining wall of sandstone, of which material many of
its houses were made. In its temple tower, built of brick, was a marble
stairway, and evidences have been forthcoming that in the later Sumerian
period the structure was lavishly adorned. It is referred to in the
fragments of early literature which have survived as "the splendid
house, shady as the forest", that "none may enter". The mythological
spell exercised by Eridu in later times suggests that the civilization
of Sumeria owed much to the worshippers of Ea. At the sacred city the
first man was created: there the souls

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

of the dead passed towards the great Deep. Its proximity to the sea--Ea
was Nin-bubu, "god of the sailor"--may have brought it into contact with
other peoples and other early civilizations. Like the early Egyptians,
the early Sumerians may have been in touch with Punt (Somali-land),
which some regard as the cradle of the Mediterranean race. The Egyptians
obtained from that sacred land incense-bearing trees which had magical
potency. In a fragmentary Babylonian charm there is a reference to a
sacred tree or bush at Eridu. Professor Sayce has suggested that it is
the Biblical "Tree of Life" in the Garden of Eden. His translations of
certain vital words, however, is sharply questioned by Mr. R. Campbell
Thompson of the British Museum, who does not accept the theory. <span
id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) It may be that Ea's sacred bush or tree is
a survival of tree and water worship.

If Eridu was not the "cradle" of the Sumerian race, it was possibly the
cradle of Sumerian civilization. Here, amidst the shifting rivers in
early times, the agriculturists may have learned to control and
distribute the water supply by utilizing dried-up beds of streams to
irrigate the land. Whatever successes they achieved were credited to Ea,
their instructor and patron; he was Nadimmud, "god of everything".
