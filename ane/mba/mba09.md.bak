IN dealing with the city cults of Sumer and Akkad, consideration must be
given to the problems involved by the rival mythological systems.
Pantheons not only varied in detail, but were presided over by different
supreme gods. One city's chief deity might be regarded as a secondary
deity at another centre. Although Ea, for instance, was given first
place at Eridu, and was so pronouncedly Sumerian in character, the moon
god Nannar remained supreme at Ur, while the sun god, whose Semitic name
was Shamash, presided at Larsa and Sippar. Other deities were similarly
exalted in other states.

As has been indicated, a mythological system must have been strongly
influenced by city politics. To hold

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

a community in sway, it was necessary to recognize officially the
various gods worshipped by different sections, so as to secure the
constant allegiance of all classes to their rulers. Alien deities were
therefore associated with local and tribal deities, those of the nomads
with those of the agriculturists, those of the unlettered folks with
those of the learned people. Reference has been made to the introduction
of strange deities by conquerors. But these were not always imposed upon
a community by violent means. Indications are not awanting that the
worshippers of alien gods were sometimes welcomed and encouraged to
settle in certain states. When they came as military allies to assist a
city folk against a fierce enemy, they were naturally much admired and
praised, honoured by the women and the bards, and rewarded by the
rulers.

In the epic of Gilgamesh, the Babylonian Hercules, we meet with Ea-bani,
a Goliath of the wilds, who is entreated to come to the aid of the
besieged city of Erech when it seemed that its deities were unable to
help the people against their enemies.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The gods of walled-round Erech  
To flies had turned and buzzed in the streets;  
The winged bulls of walled-round Erech  
Were turned to mice and departed through the holes.</span>

</div>

Ea-bani was attracted to Erech by the gift of a fair woman for wife. The
poet who lauded him no doubt mirrored public opinion. We can see the
slim, shaven Sumerians gazing with wonder and admiration on their rough
heroic ally.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">All his body was covered with hair,  
His locks were like a woman's,  
Thick as corn grew his abundant hair. <span id="page_42">p. 42</span>  
He was a stranger to the people and in that land.  
Clad in a garment like Gira, the god,  
He had eaten grass with the gazelles,  
He had drunk water with savage beasts.  
His delight was to be among water dwellers.</span>

</div>

Like the giant Alban, the eponymous ancestor of a people who invaded
prehistoric Britain, Ea-bani appears to have represented in Babylonian
folk legends a certain type of foreign settlers in the land. No doubt
the city dwellers, who were impressed by the prowess of the hairy and
powerful warriors, were also ready to acknowledge the greatness of their
war gods, and to admit them into the pantheon. The fusion of beliefs
which followed must have stimulated thought and been productive of
speculative ideas. "Nowhere", remarks Professor Jastrow, "does a high
form of culture arise without the commingling of diverse ethnic
elements."

We must also take into account the influence exercised by leaders of
thought like En-we-dur-an-ki, the famous high priest of Sippar, whose
piety did much to increase the reputation of the cult of Shamesh, the
sun god. The teachings and example of Buddha, for instance,
revolutionized Brahmanic religion in India.

A mythology was an attempt to solve the riddle of the Universe, and to
adjust the relations of mankind with the various forces represented by
the deities. The priests systematized existing folk beliefs and
established an official religion. To secure the prosperity of the State,
it was considered necessary to render homage unto whom homage was due at
various seasons and under various circumstances.

The religious attitude of a particular community, therefore, must have
been largely dependent on its needs and experiences. The food supply was
a first consideration.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> At Eridu, as we
have seen, it was assured by devotion to Ea and obedience to his
commands as an instructor. Elsewhere it might happen, however, that Ea's
gifts were restricted or withheld by an obstructing force--the raging
storm god, or the parching, pestilence-bringing deity of the sun. It was
necessary, therefore, for the people to win the favour of the god or
goddess who seemed most powerful, and was accordingly considered to be
the greatest in a. particular district. A rain god presided over the
destinies of one community, and a god of disease and death over another;
a third exalted the war god, no doubt because raids were frequent and
the city owed its strength and prosperity to its battles and conquests.
The reputation won by a particular god throughout Babylonia would depend
greatly on the achievements of his worshippers and the progress of the
city civilization over which he presided. Bel-Enlil's fame as a war
deity was probably due to the political supremacy of his city of Nippur;
and there was probably good reason for attributing to the sun god a
pronounced administrative and legal character; he may have controlled
the destinies of exceedingly well organized communities in which law and
order and authority were held in high esteem.

In accounting for the rise of distinctive and rival city deities, we
should also consider the influence of divergent conceptions regarding
the origin of life in mingled communities. Each foreign element in a
community had its own intellectual life and immemorial tribal
traditions, which reflected ancient habits of life and perpetuated the
doctrines of eponymous ancestors. Among the agricultural classes, the
folk religion which entered so intimately into their customs and labours
must have remained essentially Babylonish in character. In cities,

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

however, where official religions were formulated, foreign ideas were
more apt to be imposed, especially when embraced by influential
teachers. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that in Babylonia, as
in Egypt, there were differences of opinion regarding the origin of life
and the particular natural element which represented the vital
principle.

One section of the people, who were represented by the worshippers of
Ea, appear to have believed that the essence of life was contained in
water. The god of Eridu was the source of the "water of life". He
fertilized parched and sunburnt wastes through rivers and irrigating
canals, and conferred upon man the sustaining "food of life". When life
came to an end--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Food of death will be offered thee . . .  
Water of death will be offered thee . . .</span>

</div>

Offerings of water and food were made to the dead so that the ghosts
might be nourished and prevented from troubling the living. Even the
gods required water and food; they were immortal because they had drunk
ambrosia and eaten from the plant of life. When the goddess Ishtar was
in the Underworld, the land of the dead, the servant of Ea exclaimed

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hail! lady, may the well give me of its waters, so
that I may drink."</span>

</div>

The goddess of the dead commanded her servant to "sprinkle the lady
Ishtar with the water of life and bid her depart". The sacred water
might also be found at a confluence of rivers. Ea bade his son,
Merodach, to "draw water from the mouth of two streams", and "on this
water to put his pure spell".

The worship of rivers and wells which prevailed in

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

many countries was connected with the belief that the principle of life
was in moisture. In India, water was vitalized by the intoxicating juice
of the Soma plant, which inspired priests to utter prophecies and filled
their hearts with religious fervour. Drinking customs had originally a
religious significance. It was believed in India that the sap of plants
was influenced by the moon, the source of vitalizing moisture and the
hiding-place of the mead of the gods. The Teutonic gods also drank this
mead, and poets were inspired by it. Similar beliefs obtained among
various peoples. Moon and water worship were therefore closely
associated; the blood of animals and the sap of plants were vitalized by
the water of life and under control of the moon.

The body moisture of gods and demons had vitalizing properties. When the
Indian creator, Prajâpati, wept at the beginning, "that (the tears)
which fell into the water became the air. That which he wiped away,
upwards, became the sky." <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) The
ancient Egyptians believed that all men were born from the eyes of Horus
except negroes, who came from other parts of his body. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50.md) The creative tears of Ra, the sun god,
fell as shining rays upon the earth. When this god grew old saliva
dripped from his mouth, and Isis mixed the vitalizing moisture with
dust, and thus made the serpent which bit and paralysed the great solar
deity. <span id="fr_51"></span>[3](#fn_51.md)

Other Egyptian deities, including Osiris and Isis, wept creative tears.
Those which fell from the eyes of the evil gods produced poisonous
plants and various baneful animals. Orion, the Greek giant, sprang from
the body moisture of deities. The weeping ceremonies in connection

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

with agricultural rites were no doubt believed to be of magical potency;
they encouraged the god to weep creative tears.

Ea, the god of the deep, was also "lord of life" (Enti), "king of the
river" (Lugal-ida), and god of creation (Nudimmud). His aid was invoked
by means or magical formulæ. As the "great magician of the gods" he
uttered charms himself, and was the patron of all magicians. One spell
runs as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am the sorcerer priest of Ea . . .  
To revive the . . . sick man  
The great lord Ea hath sent me;  
He hath added his pure spell to mine,  
He hath added his pure voice to mine,  
He hath added his pure spittle to mine.  
                      *R. C. Thompson's Translation*.</span>

</div>

Saliva, like tears, had creative and therefore curative qualities; it
also expelled and injured demons and brought good luck. Spitting
ceremonies are referred to in the religious literature of Ancient Egypt.
When the Eye of Ra was blinded by Set, Thoth spat in it to restore
vision. The sun god Turn, who was linked with Ra as Ra-Tum, spat on the
ground, and his saliva became the gods Shu and Tefnut. In the Underworld
the devil serpent Apep was spat upon to curse it, as was also its waxen
image which the priests fashioned. <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md)

Several African tribes spit to make compacts, declare friendship, and to
curse.

Park, the explorer, refers in his *Travels* to his carriers spitting on
a flat stone to ensure a good journey. Arabian holy men and descendants
of Mohammed spit to cure diseases. Mohammed spat in the mouth of his
grandson Hasen soon after birth. Theocritus, Sophocles,

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

and Plutarch testify to the ancient Grecian customs of spitting to cure
and to curse, and also to bless when children were named. Pliny has
expressed belief in the efficacy of the fasting spittle for curing
disease, and referred to the custom of spitting to avert witchcraft. In
England, Scotland, and Ireland spitting customs are not yet obsolete.
North of England boys used to talk of "spitting their sauls" (souls).
When the Newcastle colliers held their earliest strikes they made
compacts by spitting on a stone. There are still "spitting stones" in
the north of Scotland. When bargains are made in rural districts, hands
are spat upon before they are shaken. The first money taken each day by
fishwives and other dealers is spat upon to ensure increased drawings.
Brand, who refers to various spitting customs, quotes Scot's *Discovery
of Witchcraft* regarding the saliva cure for king's evil, which is
still, by the way, practised in the Hebrides. Like Pliny, Scot
recommended ceremonial spitting as a charm against witchcraft. <span
id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md) In China spitting to expel demons is a
common practice. We still call a hasty person a "spitfire", and a
calumniator a "spit-poison".

The life principle in trees, &c., as we have seen, was believed to have
been derived from the tears of deities. In India sap was called the
"blood of trees", and references to "bleeding trees" are still
widespread and common. "Among the ancients", wrote Professor Robertson
Smith, "blood is generally conceived as the principle or vehicle of
life, and so the account often given of sacred waters is that the blood
of the deity flows in them. Thus as Milton writes:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Smooth Adonis from his native rock  
Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood  
Of Thammuz yearly wounded.--*Paradise Lost*, i, 450.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The ruddy colour
which the swollen river derived from the soil at a certain season was
ascribed to the blood of the god, who received his death wound in
Lebanon at that time of the year, and lay buried beside the sacred
source." <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md)

In Babylonia the river was regarded as the source of the life blood and
the seat of the soul. No doubt this theory was based on the fact that
the human liver contains about a sixth of the blood in the body, the
largest proportion required by any single organ. Jeremiah makes "Mother
Jerusalem" exclaim: "My liver is poured upon the earth for the
destruction of the daughter of my people", meaning that her life is
spent with grief.

Inspiration was derived by drinking blood as well as by drinking
intoxicating liquors--the mead of the gods. Indian magicians who drink
the blood of the goat sacrificed to the goddess Kali, are believed to be
temporarily possessed by her spirit, and thus enabled to prophesy. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md) Malayan exorcists still expel demons while
they suck the blood from a decapitated fowl. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[3](#fn_56.md)

Similar customs were prevalent in Ancient Greece. A woman who drank the
blood of a sacrificed lamb or bull uttered prophetic sayings. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[4](#fn_57.md)

But while most Babylonians appear to have believed that the life
principle was in blood, some were apparently of opinion that it was in
breath--the air of life. A man died when he ceased to breathe; his
spirit, therefore, it was argued, was identical with the atmosphere--the
moving wind--and was accordingly derived from the atmospheric or wind
god. When, in the Gilgamesh epic, the hero invokes the dead Ea-bani, the
ghost rises

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

up like a "breath of wind". A Babylonian charm runs:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The gods which seize on men  
  Came forth from the grave;  
The evil wind gusts  
  Have come forth from the grave,  
To demand payment of rites and the pouring out of libations  
  They have come forth from the grave;  
All that is evil in their hosts, like a whirlwind,  
  Hath come forth from the grave. <span
id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md)</span>

</div>

The Hebrew "nephesh ruach" and "neshamah" (in Arabic "ruh" and "nefs")
pass from meaning "breath" to "spirit" <span
id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59.md) In Egypt the god Khnumu was "Kneph" in his
character as an atmospheric deity. The ascendancy of storm and wind gods
in some Babylonian cities may have been due to the belief that they were
the source of the "air of life". It is possible that this conception was
popularized by the Semites. Inspiration was perhaps derived from these
deities by burning incense, which, if we follow evidence obtained
elsewhere, induced a prophetic trance. The gods were also invoked by
incense. In the Flood legend the Babylonian Noah burned incense. "The
gods smelled a sweet savour and gathered like flies over the
sacrificer." In Egypt devotees who inhaled the breath of the Apis bull
were enabled to prophesy.

In addition to water and atmospheric deities Babylonia had also its fire
gods, Girru, Gish Bar, Gibil, and Nusku. Their origin is obscure. It is
doubtful if their worshippers, like those of the Indian Agni, believed
that fire, the "vital spark", was the principle of life which was
manifested by bodily heat. The Aryan fire worshippers cremated their
dead so that the spirits might be

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

transferred by fire to Paradise. This practice, however, did not obtain
among the fire worshippers of Persia, nor, as was once believed, in
Sumer or Akkad either. Fire was, however, used in Babylonia for magical
purposes. It destroyed demons, and put to flight the spirits of disease.
Possibly the fire-purification ceremonies resembled those which were
practised by the Canaanites, and are referred to in the Bible. Ahaz
"made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of
the heathen". <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md) Ezekiel declared that
"when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the
fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols". <span
id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_61.md) In *Leviticus* it is laid down: "Thou
shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Moloch". <span
id="fr_62"></span>[3](#fn_62.md) It may be that in Babylonia the
fire-cleansing ceremony resembled that which obtained at Beltane (May
Day) in Scotland, Germany, and other countries. Human sacrifices might
also have been offered up as burnt offerings. Abraham, who came from the
Sumerian city of Ur, was prepared to sacrifice Isaac, Sarah's
first-born. The fire gods of Babylonia never achieved the ascendancy of
the Indian Agni; they appear to have resembled him mainly in so far as
he was connected with the sun. Nusku, like Agni, was also the "messenger
of the gods". When Merodach or Babylon was exalted as chief god of the
pantheon his messages were carried to Ea by Nusku. He may have therefore
symbolized the sun rays, for Merodach had solar attributes. It is
possible that the belief obtained among even the water worshippers of
Eridu that the sun and moon, which rose from the primordial deep, had
their origin in the everlasting fire in Ea's domain at the bottom of the
sea. In the Indian god Varuna's ocean home an "Asura fire" (demon fire)

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

burned constantly; it was "bound and confined", but could not be
extinguished. Fed by water, this fire, it was believed, would burst
forth at the last day and consume the universe. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) A similar belief can be traced in Teutonic
mythology. The Babylonian incantation cult appealed to many gods, but
"the most important share in the rites", says Jastrow, "are taken by
fire and water--suggesting, therefore, that the god of water--more
particularly Ea--and the god of fire . . . are the chief deities on
which the ritual itself hinges". In some temples there was a *bit
rimki*, a "house of washing", and a *bit nuri*, a "house of
light". <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md)

It is possible, of course, that fire was regarded as the vital principle
by some city cults, which were influenced by imported ideas. If so, the
belief never became prevalent. The most enduring influence in Babylonian
religion was the early Sumerian; and as Sumerian modes of thought were
the outcome of habits of life necessitated by the character of the
country, they were bound, sooner or later, to leave a deep impress on
the minds of foreign peoples who settled in the Garden of Western Asia.
It is not surprising, therefore, to find that imported deities assumed
Babylonian characteristics, and were identified or associated with
Babylonian gods in the later imperial pantheon.

Moon worship appears to have been as ancient as water worship, with
which, as we have seen, it was closely associated. It was widely
prevalent throughout Babylonia. The chief seat of the lunar deity,
Nannar or Sin, was the ancient city of Ur, from which Abraham migrated
to Harran, where the "Baal" (the lord) was also a moon god. Ur was
situated in Sumer, in the south, between

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

the west bank of the Euphrates and the low hills bordering the Arabian
desert, and not far distant from sea.. washed Eridu. No doubt, like that
city, it had its origin at an exceedingly remote period. At any rate,
the excavations conducted there have afforded proof that it flourished
in the prehistoric period.

As in Arabia, Egypt, and throughout ancient Europe and elsewhere, the
moon god of Sumeria was regarded as the "friend of man". He controlled
nature as a fertilizing agency; he caused grass, trees, and crops to
grow; he increased flocks and herds, and gave human offspring. At Ur he
was exalted above Ea as "the lord and prince of the gods, supreme in
heaven, the Father of all"; he was also called "great Anu", an
indication that Anu, the sky god, had at one time a lunar character. The
moon god was believed to be the father of the sun god: he was the "great
steer with mighty horns and perfect limbs".

His name Sin is believed to be a corruption of "Zu-ena", which signifies
"knowledge lord". <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) Like the lunar
Osiris of Egypt, he was apparently an instructor of mankind; the moon
measured time and controlled the seasons; seeds were sown at a certain
phase of the moon, and crops were ripened by the harvest moon. The
mountains of Sinai and the desert of Sin are called after this deity.

As Nannar, which Jastrow considers to be a variation of "Nannar", the
"light producer", the moon god scattered darkness and reduced the
terrors of night. His spirit inhabited the lunar stone, so that moon and
stone worship were closely associated; it also entered trees and crops,
so that moon worship linked with earth worship, as both linked with
water worship.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

The consort of Nannar was Nin-Uruwa, "the lady of Ur", who was also
called Nin-gala. She links with Ishtar as Nin, as Isis of Egypt linked
with other mother deities. The twin children of the moon were Mashu and
Mashtu, a brother and sister, like the lunar girl and boy of Teutonic
mythology immortalized in nursery rhymes as Jack and Jill.

Sun worship was of great antiquity in Babylonia, but appears to have
been seasonal in its earliest phases. No doubt the sky god Anu had his
solar as well as his lunar attributes, which he shared with Ea. The
spring sun was personified as Tammuz, the youthful shepherd, who was
loved by the earth goddess Ishtar and her rival Eresh-ki-gal, goddess of
death, the Babylonian Persephone. During the winter Tammuz dwelt in
Hades, and at the beginning of spring Ishtar descended to search for him
among the shades. <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md) But the burning
summer sun was symbolized as a destroyer, a slayer of men, and therefore
a war god. As Ninip or Nirig, the son of Enlil, who was made in the
likeness of Anu, he waged war against the earth spirits, and was
furiously hostile towards the deities of alien peoples, as befitted a
god of battle. Even his father feared him, and when he was advancing
towards Nippur, sent out Nusku, messenger of the gods, to soothe the
raging deity with soft words. Ninip was symbolized as a wild bull, was
connected with stone worship, like the Indian destroying god Shiva, and
was similarly a deity of Fate. He had much in common with Nin-Girsu, a
god of Lagash, who was in turn regarded as a form of Tammuz.

Nergal, another solar deity, brought disease and pestilence, and,
according to Jensen, all misfortunes due to excessive heat. He was the
king of death, husband of

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Eresh-ki-gal,
queen of Hades. As a war god he thirsted for human blood, and was
depicted as a mighty lion, He was the chief deity of the city of Cuthah,
which, Jastrow suggests, was situated beside a burial place of great
repute, like the Egyptian Abydos.

The two great cities of the sun in ancient Babylonia were the Akkadian
Sippar and the Sumerian Larsa. In these the sun god, Shamash or Babbar,
was the patron deity. He was a god of Destiny, the lord of the living
and the dead, and was exalted as the great Judge, the lawgiver, who
upheld justice; he was the enemy of wrong, he loved righteousness and
hated sin, he inspired his worshippers with rectitude and punished
evildoers. The sun god also illumined the world, and his rays penetrated
every quarter: he saw all things, and read the thoughts of men; nothing
could be concealed from Shamash. One of his names was Mitra, like the
god who was linked with Varuna in the Indian *Rigveda*. These twin
deities, Mitra and Varuna, measured out the span of human life. They
were the source of all heavenly gifts: they regulated sun and moon, the
winds and waters, and the seasons. <span id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67.md)

<span class="small">These did the gods establish in royal power over
themselves, because they were wise and the children of wisdom, and
because they excelled in power.--*Prof. Arnold's trans. of Rigvedic
Hymn*.</span>

Mitra and Varuna were protectors of hearth and home, and they chastised
sinners. "In a striking passage of the *Mahàbhàrata*," says Professor
Moulton, "one in which Indian thought comes nearest to the conception of
conscience, a kingly wrongdoer is reminded that the sun sees secret
sin." <span id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68.md)

In Persian mythology Mitra, as Mithra, is the patron

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

of Truth, and "the Mediator" between heaven and earth. <span
id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md) This god was also worshipped by the
military aristocracy of Mitanni, which held sway for a period over
Assyria. In Roman times the worship of Mithra spread into Europe from
Persia. Mithraic sculptures depict the deity as a corn god slaying the
harvest bull; on one of the monuments "cornstalks instead of blood are
seen issuing from the wound inflicted with the knife". <span
id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70.md) The Assyrian word "metru" signifies
rain. <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_69.md) As a sky god Mitra may have
been associated, like Varuna, with the waters above the firmament. Rain
would therefore be gifted by him as a fertilizing deity. In the
Babylonian Flood legend it is the sun god Shamash who "appointed the
time" when the heavens were to "rain destruction" in the night, and
commanded Pir-napishtim, "Enter into the midst of thy ship and shut thy
door". The solar deity thus appears as a form of Anu, god of the sky and
upper atmosphere, who controls the seasons and the various forces of
nature. Other rival chiefs of city pantheons, whether lunar,
atmospheric, earth, or water deities, were similarly regarded as the
supreme deities who ruled the Universe, and decreed when man should
receive benefits or suffer from their acts of vengeance.

It is possible that the close resemblances between Mithra and Mitra of
the Aryan-speaking peoples of India and the Iranian plateau, and the sun
god of the Babylonians--the Semitic Shamash, the Sumerian Utu--were due
to early contact and cultural influence through the medium of Elam. As a
solar and corn god, the Persian Mithra links with Tammuz, as a sky and
atmospheric deity with Anu, and as a god of truth, righteousness, and
law with Shamash. We seem to trace in the

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

sublime Vedic hymns addressed by the Indian Aryans to Mitra and Varuna
the impress of Babylonian religious thought:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Whate'er exists within this earth, and all within the sky,  
Yea, all that is beyond, King Varuna perceives. . . .  
                                            *Rigveda*, iv, 16. <span

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">O Varuna, whatever the offence may be  
That we as men commit against the heavenly folk,  
When through our want of thought we violate thy laws,  
Chastise us not, O god, for that iniquity.  
                                                                 *Rigveda*,
vii, 89. <span id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_72.md)</span>

Shamash was similarly exalted in Babylonian hymns:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The progeny of those who deal unjustly will not
prosper.  
What their mouth utters in thy presence  
Thou wilt destroy, what issues from their mouth thou wilt dissipate.  
Thou knowest their transgressions, the plan of the wicked thou
rejectest.  
All, whoever they be, are in thy care. . . .  
He who takes no bribe, who cares for the oppressed,  
Is favoured by Shamash,--his life shall be prolonged. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_73.md)</span>

</div>

The worshippers of Varuna and Mitra in the Punjab did not cremate their
dead like those who exalted the rival fire god Agni. The grave was the
"house of clay", as in Babylonia. Mitra, who was identical with Yama,
ruled over departed souls in the "Land of the Pitris" (Fathers), which
was reached by crossing the mountains and the rushing stream of
death. <span id="fr_75"></span>[4](#fn_74.md) As we have seen, the
Babylonian solar god Nergal was also the lord of the dead.

As Ma-banda-anna, "the boat of the sky", Shamash links with the Egyptian
sun god Ra, whose barque sailed

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

over the heavens by day and through the underworld of darkness and death
during the night. The consort of Shamash was Aa, and his attendants were
Kittu and Mesharu, "Truth" and "Righteousness".

Like the Hittites, the Babylonians had also a sun goddess: her name was
Nin-sun, which Jastrow renders "the annihilating lady". At Erech she had
a shrine in the temple of the sky god Anu.

We can trace in Babylonia, as in Egypt, the early belief that life in
the Universe had a female origin. Nin-sun links with Ishtar, whose
Sumerian name is Nana. Ishtar appears to be identical with the Egyptian
Hathor, who, as Sekhet, slaughtered the enemies of the sun god Ra. She
was similarly the goddess of maternity, and is depicted in this
character, like Isis and other goddesses of similar character, suckling
a babe. Another Babylonian lady of the gods was Ama, Mama, or Mami, "the
creatress of the seed of mankind", and was "probably so called as the
'mother' of all things". <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_75.md)

A characteristic atmospheric deity was Ramman, the Rimmon of the Bible,
the Semitic Addu, Adad, Hadad, or Dadu. He was not a presiding deity in
any pantheon, but was identified with Enlil at Nippur. As a hammer god,
he was imported by the Semites from the hills. He was a wind and thunder
deity, a rain bringer, a corn god, and a god of battle like Thor,
Jupiter, Tarku, Indra, and others, who were all sons of the sky.

In this brief review of the representative deities of early Babylonia,
it will be seen that most gods link with Anu, Ea, and Enlil, whose
attributes they symbolized in various forms. The prominence accorded to
an individual deity depended on local conditions, experiences, and
influences. Ceremonial practices no doubt varied

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

here and there, but although one section might exalt Ea and another
Shamash, the religious faith of the people as a whole did not differ to
any marked extent; they served the gods according to their lights, so
that life might be prolonged and made prosperous, for the land of death
and "no return" was regarded as a place of gloom and misery.

When the Babylonians appear before us in the early stages of the
historical period they had reached that stage of development set forth
so vividly in the Orations of Isocrates: "Those of the gods who are the
source to us of good things have the title of Olympians; those whose
department is that of calamities and punishments have harsher titles: to
the first class both private persons and states erect altars and
temples; the second is not worshipped either with prayers or burnt
sacrifices, but in their case we perform ceremonies of riddance". <span
id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_76.md)

The Sumerians, like the Ancient Egyptians, developed their deities, who
reflected the growth of culture, from vague spirit groups, which, like
ghosts, were hostile to mankind. Those spirits who could be propitiated
were exalted as benevolent deities; those who could not be bargained
with were regarded as evil gods and goddesses. A better understanding of
the character of Babylonian deities will therefore be obtained by
passing the demons and evil spirits under review.
