THE rise of Assyria brings into prominence the national god Ashur, who
had been the city god of Asshur, the ancient capital. When first met
with, he is found to be a complex and mystical deity, and the problem of
his origin is consequently rendered exceedingly difficult. Philologists
are not agreed as to the derivation of his name, and present as varied
views as they do when dealing with the name of Osiris. Some give Ashur a
geographical significance, urging that its original form was Aushar,
"water field"; others prefer the renderings "Holy", "the Beneficent
One", or "the Merciful One"; while not a few regard Ashur as simply a
dialectic form of the name of Anshar, the god who, in the Assyrian
version, or copy, of the Babylonian Creation myth, is chief of the "host
of heaven", and the father of Anu, Ea, and Enlil.

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

If Ashur is to be regarded as an abstract solar deity, who was developed
from a descriptive place name, it follows that he had a history, like
Anu or Ea, rooted in Naturalism or Animism. We cannot assume that his
strictly local character was produced by modes of thought which did not
obtain elsewhere. The colonists who settled at Asshur no doubt imported
beliefs from some cultural area; they must have either given recognition
to a god, or group of gods, or regarded the trees, hills, rivers, sun,
moon, and stars, and the animals as manifestations of the "self power"
of the Universe, before they undertook the work of draining and
cultivating the "water field" and erecting permanent homes. Those who
settled at Nineveh, for instance, believed that they were protected by
the goddess Nina, the patron deity of the Sumerian city of Nina. As this
goddess was also worshipped at Lagash, and was one of the many forms of
the Great Mother, it would appear that in ancient times deities had a
tribal rather than a geographical significance.

If the view is accepted that Ashur is Anshar, it can be urged that he
was imported from Sumeria. "Out of that land (Shinar)", according to the
Biblical reference, "went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh." <span
id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_354.md) Asshur, or Ashur (identical, Delitzsch
and Jastrow believe, with Ashir), <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_355.md)
may have been an eponymous hero--a deified king like Etana, or
Gilgamesh, who was regarded as an incarnation of an ancient god. As
Anshar was an astral or early form of Anu, the Sumerian city of origin
may have been Erech,

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

where the worship of the mother goddess was also given prominence.

Damascius rendered Anshar's name as "Assōros", a fact usually cited to
establish Ashur's connection with that deity. This writer stated that
the Babylonians passed over "Sige, <span id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_356.md)
the mother, that has begotten heaven and earth", and made two--Apason
(Apsu), the husband, and Tauthe (Tiawath or Tiamat), whose son was
Moymis (Mummu). From these another progeny came forth--Lache and Lachos
(Lachmu and Lachamu). These were followed by the progeny Kissare and
Assōros (Kishar and Anshar), "from which were produced Anos (Anu),
Illillos (Enlil) and Aos (Ea). And of Aos and Dauke (Dawkina or Damkina)
was born Belos (Bel Merodach), whom they say is the Demiurge" <span
id="fr_359"></span>[2](#fn_357.md) (the world artisan who carried out the
decrees of a higher being).

Lachmu and Lachamu, like the second pair of the ancient group of
Egyptian deities, probably symbolized darkness as a reproducing and
sustaining power. Anshar was apparently an impersonation of the night
sky, as his son Anu was of the day sky. It may have been believed that
the soul of Anshar was in the moon as Nannar (Sin), or in a star, or
that the moon and the stars were manifestations of him, and that the
soul of Anu was in the sun or the firmament, or that the sun, firmament,
and the wind were forms of this "self power".

If Ashur combined the attributes of Anshar and Anu, his early mystical
character may be accounted for. Like the Indian Brahma, he may have been
in his highest form an impersonation, or symbol, of the "self power" or
"world soul" of developed Naturalism--the "creator", "preserver", and
"destroyer" in one, a god of water, earth,

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

air, and sky, of sun, moon, and stars, fire and lightning, a god of the
grove, whose essence was in the fig, or the fir cone, as it was in all
animals. The Egyptian god Amon of Thebes, who was associated with water,
earth, air, sky, sun and moon, had a ram form, and was "the hidden one",
was developed from one of the elder eight gods; in the Pyramid Texts he
and his consort are the fourth pair. When Amon was fused with the
specialized sun god Ra, he was placed at the head of the Ennead as the
Creator. "We have traces", says Jastrow, "of an Assyrian myth of
Creation in which the sphere of creator is given to Ashur." <span
id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_358.md)

Before a single act of creation was conceived of, however, the early
peoples recognized the eternity of matter, which was permeated by the
"self power" of which the elder deities were vague phases. These were
too vague, indeed, to be worshipped individually. The forms of the "self
power" which were propitiated were trees, rivers, hills, or animals. As
indicated in the previous chapter, a tribe worshipped an animal or
natural object which dominated its environment. The animal might be the
source of the food supply, or might have to be propitiated to ensure the
food supply. Consequently they identified the self power of the Universe
with the particular animal with which they were most concerned. One
section identified the spirit of the heavens with the bull and another
with the goat. In India Dyaus was a bull, and his spouse, the earth
mother, Prithivi, was a cow. The Egyptian sky goddess Hathor was a cow,
and other goddesses were identified with the hippopotamus, the serpent,
the cat, or the vulture. Ra, the sun god, was identified in turn with
the cat, the ass, the bull, the ram, and the crocodile, the various
animal forms of the local deities he had absorbed. The eagle in

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Babylonia and
India, and the vulture, falcon, and mysterious Phoenix in Egypt, were
identified with the sun, fire, wind, and lightning. The animals
associated with the god Ashur were the bull, the eagle, and the lion. He
either absorbed the attributes of other gods, or symbolized the "Self
Power" of which the animals were manifestations.

The earliest germ of the Creation myth was the idea that night was the
parent of day, and water of the earth. Out of darkness and death came
light and life. Life was also motion. When the primordial waters became
troubled, life began to be. Out of the confusion came order and
organization. This process involved the idea of a stable and controlling
power, and the succession of i a group of deities--passive deities and
active deities. When the Babylonian astrologers assisted in developing
the Creation myth, they appear to have identified with the stable and
controlling spirit of the night heaven that steadfast orb the Polar
Star. Anshar, like Shakespeare's Cæsar, seemed to say:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am constant as the northern star,  
Of whose true-fixed and resting quality  
There is no fellow in the firmament.  
The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks;  
They are all fire, and every one doth shine;  
But there's but one in all doth hold his place. <span
id="fr_361"></span>[1](#fn_359.md)</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Associated with
the Polar Star was the constellation Ursa Minor, "the Little Bear",
called by the Babylonian astronomers, "the Lesser Chariot". There were
chariots before horses were introduced. A patesi of Lagash had a chariot
which was drawn by asses.

The seemingly steadfast Polar Star was called "Ilu Sar", "the god Shar",
or Anshar, "star of the height ",

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

or "Shar the most high". It seemed to be situated at the summit of the
vault of heaven. The god Shar, therefore, stood upon the Celestial
mountain, the Babylonian Olympus. He was the ghost of the elder god, who
in Babylonia was displaced by the younger god, Merodach, as Mercury, the
morning star, or as the sun, the planet of day; and in Assyria by Ashur,
as the sun, or Regulus, or Arcturus, or Orion. Yet father and son were
identical. They were phases of the One, the "self power".

A deified reigning king was an incarnation of the god; after death he
merged in the god, as did the Egyptian Unas. The eponymous hero Asshur
may have similarly merged in the universal Ashur, who, like Horus, an
incarnation of Osiris, had many phases or forms.

Isaiah appears to have been familiar with the Tigro-Euphratean myths
about the divinity of kings and the displacement of the elder god by the
younger god, of whom the ruling monarch was an incarnation, and with the
idea that the summit of the Celestial mountain was crowned by the "north
star", the symbol of Anshar. "Thou shalt take up this parable", he
exclaimed, making use of Babylonian symbolism, "against the king of
Babylon and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!
. . . How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!
how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For
thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend unto heaven, I will exalt
my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the
congregation, *in the sides of the north*; I will ascend above the
heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High." <span
id="fr_362"></span>[1](#fn_360.md) The king is identified with Lucifer as
the deity of fire and the morning star; he is the younger god who
aspired to occupy the

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

mountain throne of his father, the god Shar--the Polar or North Star.

It is possible that the Babylonian idea of a Celestial mountain gave
origin to the belief that the earth was a mountain surrounded by the
outer ocean, beheld by Etana when he flew towards heaven on the eagle's
back. In India this hill is Mount Meru, the "world spine", which
"sustains the earth"; it is surmounted by Indra's Valhal, or "the great
city of Brahma". In Teutonic mythology the heavens revolve round the
Polar Star, which is called "Veraldar nagli", <span
id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_361.md) the "world spike"; while the earth is
sustained by the "world tree". The "ded" amulet of Egypt symbolized the
backbone of Osiris as a world god: "ded" means "firm",
"established"; <span id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_362.md) while at burial
ceremonies the coffin was set up on end, inside the tomb, "on a small
sandhill intended to represent the Mountain of the West--the realm of
the dead". <span id="fr_365"></span>[3](#fn_363.md) The Babylonian temple
towers were apparently symbols of the "world hill". At Babylon, the
Du-azaga, "holy mound", was Merodach's temple E-sagila, "the Temple of
the High Head". E-kur, rendered "the house or temple of the Mountain",
was the temple of Bel Enlil at Nippur. At Erech, the temple of the
goddess Ishtar was E-anna, which connects her, as Nina or Ninni, with
Anu, derived from "ana", "heaven". Ishtar was "Queen of heaven".

Now Polaris, situated at the summit of the celestial mountain, was
identified with the sacred goat, "the highest of the flock of
night". <span id="fr_366"></span>[4](#fn_364.md) Ursa Minor (the "Little
Bear" constellation) may have been "the goat with six heads",

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

referred to by Professor Sayce. <span id="fr_367"></span>[1](#fn_365.md)
The six astral goats or goat-men were supposed to be dancing round the
chief goat-man or Satyr (Anshar). Even in the dialogues of Plato the
immemorial belief was perpetuated that the constellations were "moving
as in a dance". Dancing began as a magical or religious practice, and
the earliest astronomers saw their dancing customs reflected in the
heavens by the constellations, whose movements were rhythmical. No
doubt, Isaiah had in mind the belief of the Babylonians regarding the
dance of their goat-gods when he foretold: "Their houses shall be full
of doleful creatures; and owls (ghosts) shall dwell there, and *satyrs
shall dance there*". <span id="fr_368"></span>[2](#fn_366.md) In other
words, there would be no people left to perform religious dances beside
the "desolate houses"; the stars only would be seen dancing round
Polaris.

Tammuz, like Anshar, as sentinel of the night heaven, was a goat, as was
also Nin-Girsu of Lagash. A Sumerian reference to "a white kid of En
Mersi (Nin-Girsu)" was translated into Semitic, "a white kid of Tammuz".
The goat was also associated with Merodach. Babylonians, having prayed
to that god to take away their diseases or their sins, released a goat,
which was driven into the desert. The present Polar Star, which was not,
of course, the Polar star of the earliest astronomers, the world having
rocked westward, is called in Arabic Al-Jedy, "the kid". In India, the
goat was connected with Agni and Varuna; it was slain at funeral
ceremonies to inform the gods that a soul was about to enter heaven. Ea,
the Sumerian lord of water, earth, and heaven, was symbolized as a "goat
fish". Thor, the

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Teutonic fertility
and thunder god, had a chariot drawn by goats. It is of interest to note
that the sacred Sumerian goat bore on its forehead the same triangular
symbol as the Apis bull of Egypt.

Ashur was not a "goat of heaven", but a "bull of heaven", like the
Sumerian Nannar (Sin), the moon god of Ur, Ninip of Saturn, and Bel
Enlil. As the bull, however, he was, like Anshar, the ruling animal of
the heavens; and like Anshar he had associated with him "six divinities
of council".

Other deities who were similarly exalted as "high heads" at various
centres and at various periods, included Anu, Bel Enlil, and Ea,
Merodach, Nergal, and Shamash. A symbol of the first three was a turban
on a seat, or altar, which may have represented the "world mountain".
Ea, as "the world spine", was symbolized as a column, with ram's head,
standing on a throne, beside which crouched a "goat fish". Merodach's
column terminated in a lance head, and the head of a lion crowned that
of Nergal. These columns were probably connected with pillar worship,
and therefore with tree worship, the pillar being the trunk of the
"world tree". The symbol of the sun god Shamash was a disc, from which
flowed streams of water; his rays apparently were "fertilizing tears",
like the rays of the Egyptian sun god Ra. Horus, the Egyptian falcon
god, was symbolized as the winged solar disc.

It is necessary to accumulate these details regarding other deities and
their symbols before dealing with Ashur. The symbols of Ashur must be
studied, because they are one of the sources of our knowledge regarding
the god's origin and character. These include (1) a winged disc with
horns, enclosing four circles revolving round a middle circle; rippling
rays fall down from either

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph

the left, are described on page [335](#page_335.md). The winged disk on the
right appears on a Babylonian "boundary stone" which dates from the
reign of Marduk-balatsu-ikbi. (See pages [415](mba23.htm#page_415.md),

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

side of the disc; (2) a circle or wheel, suspended from wings, and
enclosing a warrior drawing his bow to discharge an arrow; and (3) the
same circle; the warrior's bow, however, is carried in his left hand,
while the right hand is uplifted as if to bless his worshippers. These
symbols are taken from seal cylinders.

An Assyrian standard, which probably represented the "world column", has
the disc mounted on a bull's head with horns. The upper part of the disc
is occupied by a warrior, whose head, part of his bow, and the point of
his arrow protrude from the circle. The rippling water rays are
**V**-shaped, and two bulls, treading river-like rays, occupy the
divisions thus formed. There are also two heads--a lion's and a
man's--with gaping mouths, which may symbolize tempests, the destroying
power of the sun, or the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates.

Jastrow regards the winged disc as "the purer and more genuine symbol of
Ashur as a solar deity". He calls it "a sun disc with protruding rays",
and says: "To this symbol the warrior with the bow and arrow was
added--a despiritualization that reflects the martial spirit of the
Assyrian empire". <span id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_367.md)

The sun symbol on the sun boat of Ra encloses similarly a human figure,
which was apparently regarded as the soul of the sun: the life of the
god was in the "sun egg". In an Indian prose treatise it is set forth:
"Now that man in yonder orb (the sun) and that man in the right eye
truly are no other than Death (the soul). His feet have stuck fast in
the heart, and having pulled them out he comes forth; and when he comes
forth then that man dies; whence they say of him who has passed

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

away, 'he has been cut off (his life or life string has been
severed)'." <span id="fr_370"></span>[1](#fn_368.md) The human figure did
not indicate a process of "despiritualization" either in Egypt or in
India. The Horus "winged disc" was besides a symbol of destruction and
battle, as well as of light and fertility. Horus assumed that form in
one legend to destroy Set and his followers. <span
id="fr_371"></span>[2](#fn_369.md) But, of course, the same symbols may not
have conveyed the same ideas to all peoples. As Blake put it:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">What to others a trifle appears  
Fills me full of smiles and tears. . . .  
With my inward Eye, ’t is an old Man grey,  
With my outward, a Thistle across my way.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indeed, it is
possible that the winged disc meant one thing to an Assyrian priest, and
another thing to a man not gifted with what Blake called "double
vision".

What seems certain, however, is that the archer was as truly solar as
the "wings" or "rays". In Babylonia and Assyria the sun was, among other
things, a destroyer from the earliest times. It is not surprising,
therefore, to find that Ashur, like Merodach, resembled, in one of his
phases, Hercules, or rather his prototype Gilgamesh. One of Gilgamesh's
mythical feats was the slaying of three demon birds. These may be
identical with the birds of prey which Hercules, in performing his sixth
labour, hunted out of Stymphalus. <span id="fr_372"></span>[3](#fn_370.md)
In the Greek Hipparcho-Ptolemy star list Hercules was the constellation
of the "Kneeler", and in Babylonian-Assyrian astronomy he was (as
Gilgamesh or Merodach) "Sarru", "the king". The astral "Arrow"
(constellation of Sagitta)

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

was pointed against the constellations of the "Eagle", "Vulture", and
"Swan". In Phœnician astronomy the Vulture was "Zither" (Lyra), a weapon
with which Hercules (identified with Melkarth) slew Linos, the musician.
Hercules used a solar arrow, which he received from Apollo. In various
mythologies the arrow is associated with the sun, the moon, and the
atmospheric deities, and is a symbol of lightning, rain, and fertility,
as well as of famine, disease, war, and death. The green-faced goddess
Neith of Libya, compared by the Greeks to Minerva, carries in one hand
two arrows and a bow. <span id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_371.md) If we knew
as little of Athena (Minerva), who was armed with a lance, a breastplate
made of the skin of a goat, a shield, and helmet, as we do of Ashur, it
might be held that she was simply a goddess of war. The archer in the
sun disc of the Assyrian standard probably represented Ashur as the god
of the people--a deity closely akin to Merodach, with pronounced Tammuz
traits, and therefore linking with other local deities like Ninip,
Nergal, and Shamash, and partaking also like these of the attributes of
the elder gods Anu, Bel Enlil, and Ea.

All the other deities worshipped by the Assyrians were of Babylonian
origin. Ashur appears to have differed from them just as one local
Babylonian deity differed from another. He reflected Assyrian
experiences and aspirations, but it is difficult to decide whether the
sublime spiritual aspect of his character was due to the beliefs of
alien peoples, by whom the early Assyrians were influenced, or to the
teachings of advanced Babylonian thinkers, whose doctrines found readier
acceptance in a "new country" than among the conservative ritualists

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

of ancient Sumerian and Akkadian cities. New cults were formed from time
to time in Babylonia, and when they achieved political power they gave a
distinctive character to the religion of their city states. Others which
did not find political support and remained in obscurity at home, may
have yet extended their influence far and wide. Buddhism, for instance,
originated in India, but now flourishes in other countries, to which it
was introduced by missionaries. In the homeland it was submerged by the
revival of Brahmanism, from which it sprung, and which it was intended
permanently to displace. An instance of an advanced cult suddenly
achieving prominence as a result of political influence is afforded by
Egypt, where the fully developed Aton religion was embraced and
established as a national religion by Akhenaton, the so-called
"dreamer". That migrations were sometimes propelled by cults, which
sought new areas in which to exercise religious freedom and propagate
their beliefs, is suggested by the invasion of India at the close of the
Vedic period by the "later comers", who laid the foundations of
Brahmanism. They established themselves in Madhyadesa, "the Middle
Country", "the land where the Brahmanas and the later Samhitas were
produced". From this centre went forth missionaries, who accomplished
the Brahmanization of the rest of India. <span
id="fr_374"></span>[1](#fn_372.md)

It may be, therefore, that the cult of Ashur was influenced in its
development by the doctrines of advanced teachers from Babylonia, and
that Persian Mithraism was also the product of missionary efforts
extended from that great and ancient cultural area. Mitra, as has been
stated, was one of the names of the Babylonian sun god, who was also a
god of fertility. But Ashur could not have been to

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

begin with merely a battle and solar deity. As the god of a city state
he must have been worshipped by agriculturists, artisans, and traders;
he must have been recognized as a deity of fertility, culture, commerce,
and law. Even as a national god he must have made wider appeal than to
the cultured and ruling classes. Bel Enlil of Nippur was a "world god"
and war god, but still remained a local corn god.

Assyria's greatness was reflected by Ashur, but he also reflected the
origin and growth of that greatness. The civilization of which he was a
product had an agricultural basis. It began with the development of the
natural resources of Assyria, as was recognized by the Hebrew prophet,
who said: "Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair
branches. . . . The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high
with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little
rivers unto all the trees of the field. Therefore his height was exalted
above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and
his branches became long because of the multitude of waters when he shot
forth. All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under
his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young,
and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. Thus was he fair in his
greatness, in the length of his branches; for his root was by great
waters. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir
trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his
branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his
beauty." <span id="fr_375"></span>[1](#fn_373.md)

Asshur, the ancient capital, was famous for its merchants. It is
referred to in the Bible as one of the cities which traded with Tyre "in
all sorts of things, in blue

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with
cords, and made of cedar". <span id="fr_376"></span>[1](#fn_374.md)

As a military power, Assyria's name was dreaded. "Behold," Isaiah said,
addressing King Hezekiah, "thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria
have done to all lands by destroying them utterly." <span
id="fr_377"></span>[2](#fn_375.md) The same prophet, when foretelling how
Israel would suffer, exclaimed: "O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and
the staff in their hand is mine indignation. I will send him against an
hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him
a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them
down like the mire of the streets." <span
id="fr_378"></span>[3](#fn_376.md)

We expect to find Ashur reflected in these three phases of Assyrian
civilization. If we recognize him in the first place as a god of
fertility, his other attributes are at once included. A god of fertility
is a corn god and a water god. The river as a river was a "creator" ([p.
29](mba08.htm#page_29).md), and Ashur was therefore closely associated with
the "watery place", with the canals or "rivers running round about his
plants". The rippling water-rays, or fertilizing tears, appear on the
solar discs. As a corn god, he was a god of war. Tammuz's first act was
to slay the demons of winter and storm, as Indra's in India was to slay
the demons of drought, and Thor's in Scandinavia was to exterminate the
frost giants. The corn god had to be fed with human sacrifices, and the
people therefore waged war against foreigners to obtain victims. As the
god made a contract with his people, he was a deity of commerce; he
provided them with food and they in turn fed him with offerings.

In Ezekiel's comparison of Assyria to a mighty tree, there is no doubt a
mythological reference. The Hebrew

prophets invariably utilized for their poetic imagery the characteristic
beliefs of the peoples to whom they made direct reference. The "owls",
"satyrs", and "dragons" of Babylon, mentioned by Isaiah, were taken from
Babylonian mythology, as has been indicated. When, therefore, Assyria is
compared to a cedar, which is greater than fir or chestnut, and it is
stated that there are nesting birds in the branches, and under them
reproducing beasts of the field, and that the greatness of the tree is
due to "the multitude of waters", the conclusion is suggested that
Assyrian religion, which Ashur's symbols reflect, included the worship
of trees, birds, beasts, and water. The symbol of the Assyrian
tree--probably the "world tree" of its religion--appears to be "the rod
of mine anger . . . the staff in their hand"; that is, the battle
standard which was a symbol of Ashur. Tammuz and Osiris were tree gods
as well as corn gods.

Now, as Ashur was evidently a complex deity, it is futile to attempt to
read his symbols without giving consideration to the remnants of
Assyrian mythology which are found in the ruins of the ancient cities.
These either reflect the attributes of Ashur, or constitute the material
from which he evolved.

As Layard pointed out many years ago, the Assyrians had a sacred tree
which became conventionalized. It was "an elegant device, in which
curved branches, springing from a kind of scroll work, terminated in
flowers of graceful form. As one of the figures last described <span
id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_377.md) was turned, as if in act of adoration,
towards this device, it was evidently a sacred emblem; and I recognized
in it the holy tree, or tree of life, so universally adored at the
remotest period in the East, and which was preserved in the religious
systems of the Persians to the final overthrow

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

of their Empire. . . . The flowers were formed by seven petals." <span
id="fr_380"></span>[1](#fn_378.md)

This tree looks like a pillar, and is thrice crossed by conventionalized
bull's horns tipped with ring symbols which may be stars, the highest
pair of horns having a larger ring between them, but only partly shown
as if it were a crescent. The tree with its many "sevenfold" designs may
have been a symbol of the "Sevenfold-one-are-ye" deity. This is
evidently the Assyrian tree which was called "the rod" or "staff".

What mythical animals did this tree shelter? Layard found that "the four
creatures continually introduced on the sculptured walls", were "a man,
a lion, an ox, and an eagle". <span id="fr_381"></span>[2](#fn_379.md)

In Sumeria the gods were given human form, but before this stage was
reached the bull symbolized Nannar (Sin), the moon god, Ninip (Saturn,
the old sun), and Enlil, while Nergal was a lion, as a tribal sun god.
The eagle is represented by the Zu bird, which symbolized the storm and
a phase of the sun, and was also a deity of fertility. On the silver
vase of Lagash the lion and eagle were combined as the lion-headed
eagle, a form of Nin-Girsu (Tammuz), and it was associated with wild
goats, stags, lions, and bulls. On a mace head dedicated to Nin-Girsu, a
lion slays a bull as the Zu bird slays serpents in the folk tale,
suggesting the wars of totemic deities, according to one "school", and
the battle of the sun with the storm clouds according to another.
Whatever the explanation may be of one animal deity of fertility slaying
another, it seems certain that the conflict was associated with the idea
of sacrifice to procure the food supply.

In Assyria the various primitive gods were combined as a winged bull, a
winged bull with human head (the

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

king's), a winged lion with human head, a winged man, a deity with
lion's head, human body, and eagle's legs with claws, and also as a
deity with eagle's head and feather headdress, a human body, wings, and
feather-fringed robe, carrying in one hand a metal basket on which two
winged men adored the holy tree, and in the other a fir cone. <span
id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_380.md)

Layard suggested that the latter deity, with eagle's head, was Nisroch,
"the word Nisr signifying, in all Semitic languages, an eagle". <span
id="fr_383"></span>[2](#fn_381.md) This deity is referred to in the Bible:
"Sennacherib, king of Assyria, . . . was worshipping in the house of
Nisroch, his god". <span id="fr_384"></span>[3](#fn_382.md) Professor
Pinches is certain that Nisroch is Ashur, but considers that the "ni"
was attached to "Ashur" (Ashuraku or Ashurachu), as it was to "Marad"
(Merodach) to give the reading Ni-Marad = Nimrod. The names of heathen
deities were thus made "unrecognizable, and in all probability
ridiculous as well. . . . Pious and orthodox lips could pronounce them
without fear of defilement." <span id="fr_385"></span>[4](#fn_383.md) At
the same time the "Nisr" theory is probable: it may represent another
phase of this process. The names of heathen gods were not all treated in
like manner by the Hebrew teachers. Abed-*nebo*, for instance, became
Abed-*nego* (*Daniel*, i, 7), as Professor Pinches shows.

Seeing that the eagle received prominence in the mythologies of Sumeria
and Assyria, as a deity of fertility with solar and atmospheric
attributes, it is highly probable that the Ashur symbol, like the
Egyptian Horus solar disk, is a winged symbol of life, fertility, and
destruction. The idea that it represents the sun in eclipse, with
protruding

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

rays, seems rather far-fetched, because eclipses were disasters and
indications of divine wrath; <span id="fr_386"></span>[1](#fn_384.md) it
certainly does not explain why the "rays" should only stretch out
sideways, like wings, and downward like a tail, why the "rays" should be
double, like the double wings of cherubs, bulls, &c., and divided into
sections suggesting feathers, or why the disk is surmounted by
conventionalized horns, tipped with star-like ring symbols, identical
with those depicted in the holy tree. What particular connection the
five small rings within the disk were supposed to have with the eclipse
of the sun is difficult to discover.

In one of the other symbols in which appears a feather-robed archer, it
is significant to find that the arrow he is about to discharge has a
head shaped like a trident; it is evidently a lightning symbol.

When Ezekiel prophesied to the Israelitish captives at Tel-abib, "by the
river of Chebar" in Chaldea (Kheber, near Nippur), he appears to have
utilized Assyrian symbolism. Probably he came into contact in Babylonia
with fugitive priests from Assyrian cities.

This great prophet makes interesting references to "four living
creatures", with "four faces"--the face of a man, the face of a lion,
the face of an ox, and the face of an eagle; "they had the hands of a
man under their wings, . . . their wings were joined one to another; . .
. their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every one were joined
one to another. . . . Their appearance was like burning coals of fire
and like the appearance of lamps. . . . The living creatures ran and
returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning." <span
id="fr_387"></span>[2](#fn_385.md)

Elsewhere, referring to the sisters, Aholah and Aholibah, who had been
in Egypt and had adopted unmoral ways of

life, Ezekiel tells that when Aholibah "doted upon the Assyrians" she
"saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans
pourtrayed with vermilion, girded with girdles upon their loins". <span
id="fr_388"></span>[1](#fn_386.md) Traces of the red colour on the walls of
Assyrian temples and palaces have been observed by excavators. The
winged gods "like burning coals" were probably painted in vermilion.

Ezekiel makes reference to "ring" and "wheel" symbols. In his vision he
saw "one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four
faces. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the
colour of beryl; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance
and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. . . . As
for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their
rings were full of eyes round about them four. And when the living
creatures went, the wheels went by them; and when the living creatures
were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. Whithersoever
the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the
wheels were lifted up over against them; *for the spirit of the living
creature was in the wheels*. <span id="fr_389"></span>[2](#fn_387.md) . . .
And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature
was as the colour of terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads
above. . . . And when they went I heard the noise of their wings, like
the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of
speech, as the noise of an host; when they stood they let down their
wings. . . ." <span id="fr_390"></span>[3](#fn_388.md)

Another description of the cherubs states: "Their whole body, and their
backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of
eyes (? stars) round

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

about, even the wheels that they four had. As for the wheels, it was
cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel!"--or, according to a marginal
rendering, "they were called in my hearing, wheel, or Gilgal," i.e. move
round. . . . "And the cherubims were lifted up." <span
id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_389.md)

It would appear that the wheel (or hoop, a variant rendering) was a
symbol of life, and that the Assyrian feather-robed figure which it
enclosed was a god, not of war only, but also of fertility. His
trident-headed arrow resembles, as has been suggested, a lightning
symbol. Ezekiel's references are suggestive in this connection. When the
cherubs "ran and returned" they had "the appearance of a flash of
lightning", and "the noise of their wings" resembled "the noise of great
waters". Their bodies were "like burning coals of fire". Fertility gods
were associated with fire, lightning, and water. Agni of India, Sandan
of Asia Minor, and Melkarth of Phoenicia were highly developed fire gods
of fertility. The fire cult was also represented in Sumeria (pp.
[49](mba09.htm#page_49)-51.md).

In the Indian epic, the *Mahàbhàrata*, the revolving ring or wheel
protects the Soma <span id="fr_392"></span>[2](#fn_390) (ambrosia.md) of
the gods, on which their existence depends. The eagle giant Garuda sets
forth to steal it. The gods, fully armed, gather round to protect the
life-giving drink. Garuda approaches "darkening the worlds by the dust
raised by the hurricane of his wings". The celestials, "overwhelmed by
that dust", swoon away. Garuda afterwards assumes a fiery shape, then
looks "like masses of black clouds", and in the end its body becomes
golden and bright "as the rays of the sun". The Soma is protected by
fire, which the bird quenches after "drinking in many rivers" with the
numerous mouths it has assumed. Then Garuda finds that right above the
Soma is "a wheel of steel, keen

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

edged, and sharp as a razor, revolving incessantly. That fierce
instrument, of the lustre of the blazing sun and of terrible form, was
devised by the gods for cutting to pieces all robbers of the Soma."
Garuda passes "through the spokes of the wheel", and has then to contend
against "two great snakes of the lustre of blazing fire, of tongues
bright as the lightning flash, of great energy, of mouth emitting fire,
of blazing eyes". He slays the snakes. . . . The gods afterwards recover
the stolen Soma.

Garuda becomes the vehicle of the god Vishnu, who carries the discus,
another fiery wheel which revolves and returns to the thrower like
lightning. "And he (Vishnu) made the bird sit on the flagstaff of his
car, saying: 'Even thus thou shalt stay above me'." <span
id="fr_393"></span>[1](#fn_391.md)

The Persian god Ahura Mazda hovers above the king in sculptured
representations of that high dignitary, enclosed in a winged wheel, or
disk, like Ashur, grasping a ring in one hand, the other being lifted up
as if blessing those who adore him.

Shamash, the Babylonian sun god; Ishtar, the goddess of heaven; and
other Babylonian deities carried rings as the Egyptian gods carried the
ankh, the symbol of life. Shamash was also depicted sitting on his
throne in a pillar-supported pavilion, in front of which is a sun wheel.
The spokes of the wheel are formed by a star symbol and threefold
rippling "water rays".

In Hittite inscriptions there are interesting winged emblems; "the
central portion" of one "seems to be composed of two crescents
underneath a disk (which is also divided like a crescent). Above the
emblem there appear the symbol of sanctity (the divided oval) and the
hieroglyph which Professor Sayce interprets as the name of the god
Sandes." In another instance "the centre of

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

the winged emblem may be seen to be a rosette, with a curious spreading
object below. Above, two dots follow the name of Sandes, and a human arm
bent 'in adoration' is by the side. . . ." Professor Garstang is here
dealing with sacred places "on rocky points or hilltops, bearing out the
suggestion of the sculptures near Boghaz-Keui <span
id="fr_394"></span>[1](#fn_392.md), in which there may be reasonably
suspected the surviving traces of mountain cults, or cults of mountain
deities, underlying the newer religious symbolism". Who the deity is it
is impossible to say, but "he was identified at some time or other with
Sandes". <span id="fr_395"></span>[2](#fn_393.md) It would appear, too,
that the god may have been "called by a name which was that used also by
the priest". Perhaps the priest king was believed to be an incarnation
of the deity.

Sandes or Sandan was identical with Sandon of Tarsus, "the prototype of
Attis", <span id="fr_396"></span>[3](#fn_394.md) who links with the
Babylonian Tammuz. Sandon's animal symbol was the lion, and he carried
the "double axe" symbol of the god of fertility and thunder. As
Professor Frazer has shown in *The Golden Bough*, he links with Hercules
and Melkarth. <span id="fr_397"></span>[4](#fn_395.md)

All the younger gods, who displaced the elder gods as one year displaces
another, were deities of fertility, battle, lightning, fire, and the
sun; it is possible, therefore, that Ashur was like Merodach, son of Ea,
god of the deep, a form of Tammuz in origin. His spirit was in the solar
wheel which revolved at times of seasonal change. In Scotland it was
believed that on the morning of May Day (Beltaine) the rising sun
revolved three times. The younger god was a spring sun god and fire god.
Great

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

bonfires were lit to strengthen him, or as a ceremony of riddance; the
old year was burned out. Indeed the god himself might be burned (that
is, the old god), so that he might renew his youth. Melkarth was burned
at Tyre. Hercules burned himself on a mountain top, and his soul
ascended to heaven as an eagle.

These fiery rites were evidently not unknown in Babylonia and Assyria.
When, according to Biblical narrative, Nebuchadnezzar "made an image of
gold" which he set up "in the plain of Dura, in the province of
Babylon", he commanded: "O people, nations, and languages . . . at the
time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
dulcimer, and all kinds of musick . . . fall down and worship the golden
image". Certain Jews who had been "set over the affairs of the province
of Babylonia", namely, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego", refused to
adore the idol. They were punished by being thrown into "a burning fiery
furnace", which was heated "seven times more than it was wont to be
heated". They came forth uninjured. <span
id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_396.md)

In the Koran it is related that Abraham destroyed the images of Chaldean
gods; he "brake them all in pieces except the biggest of them; that they
might lay the blame on that". <span id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_397.md)
According to the commentators the Chaldæans were at the time "abroad in
the fields, celebrating a great festival". To punish the offender Nimrod
had a great pyre erected at Cuthah. "Then they bound Abraham, and
putting him into an engine, shot him into the midst of the fire, from
which he was preserved by the angel Gabriel, who was sent to his
assistance." Eastern Christians were wont to set apart in the Syrian
calendar the

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 25th of January to
commemorate Abraham's escape from Nimrod's pyre. <span
id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_398.md)

It is evident that the Babylonian fire ceremony was observed in the
spring season, and that human beings were sacrificed to the sun god. A
mock king may have been burned to perpetuate the ancient sacrifice of
real kings, who were incarnations of the god.

Isaiah makes reference to the sacrificial burning of kings in Assyria:
"For through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten down,
which smote with a rod. And in every place where the grounded staff
shall pass, which the Lord shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets
and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it. For Tophet
is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared: he hath made it
deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood: the breath of
the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it." <span
id="fr_401"></span>[2](#fn_399.md) When Nineveh was about to fall, and with
it the Assyrian Empire, the legendary king, Sardanapalus, who was
reputed to have founded Tarsus, burned himself, with his wives,
concubines, and eunuchs, on a pyre in his palace. Zimri, who reigned
over Israel for seven days, "burnt the king's house over him with
fire" <span id="fr_402"></span>[3](#fn_400.md). Saul, another fallen king,
was burned after death, and his bones were buried "under the oak in
Jabesh". <span id="fr_403"></span>[4](#fn_401.md) In Europe the oak was
associated with gods of fertility and lightning, including Jupiter and
Thor. The ceremony of burning Saul is of special interest. Asa, the
orthodox king of Judah, was, after death, "laid in the bed which was
filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the
apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him" (*2
Chronicles*,

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

xvi, 14). Jehoram, the heretic king of Judah, who "walked in the way of
the kings of Israel", died of "an incurable disease. And his people made
no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers" (*2 Chronicles*,
xxi, 18, 19).

The conclusion suggested by the comparative study of the beliefs of
neighbouring peoples, and the evidence afforded by Assyrian sculptures,
is that Ashur was a highly developed form of the god of fertility, who
was sustained, or aided in his conflicts with demons, by the fires and
sacrifices of his worshippers.

It is possible to read too much into his symbols. These are not more
complicated and vague than are the symbols on the standing stones of
Scotland--the crescent with the "broken" arrow; the trident with the
double rings, or wheels, connected by two crescents; the circle with the
dot in its centre; the triangle with the dot; the large disk with two
small rings on either side crossed by double straight lines; the
so-called "mirror", and so on. Highly developed symbolism may not
indicate a process of spiritualization so much, perhaps, as the
persistence of magical beliefs and practices. There is really no direct
evidence to support the theory that the Assyrian winged disk, or disk
"with protruding rays", was of more spiritual character than the wheel
which encloses the feather-robed archer with his trident-shaped arrow.

The various symbols may have represented phases of the god. When the
spring fires were lit, and the god "renewed his life like the eagle",
his symbol was possibly the solar wheel or disk with eagle's wings,
which became regarded as a symbol of life. The god brought life and
light to the world; he caused the crops to grow; he gave increase; he
sustained his worshippers. But he was also the god who slew the demons
of darkness and storm.

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Hittite winged
disk was Sandes or Sandon, the god of lightning, who stood on the back
of a bull. As the lightning god was a war god, it was in keeping with
his character to find him represented in Assyria as "Ashur the archer"
with the bow and lightning arrow. On the disk of the Assyrian standard
the lion and the bull appear with "the archer" as symbols of the war god
Ashur, but they were also symbols of Ashur the god of fertility.

The life or spirit of the god was in the ring or wheel, as the life of
the Egyptian and Indian gods, and of the giants of folk tales, was in
"the egg". The "dot within the circle", a widespread symbol, may have
represented the seed within "the egg" of more than one mythology, or the
thorn within the egg of more than one legendary story. It may be that in
Assyria, as in India, the crude beliefs and symbols of the masses were
spiritualized by the speculative thinkers in the priesthood, but no
literary evidence has survived to justify us in placing the Assyrian
teachers on the same level as the Brahmans who composed the Upanishads.

Temples were erected to Ashur, but he might be worshipped anywhere, like
the Queen of Heaven, who received offerings in the streets of Jerusalem,
for "he needed no temple", as Professor Pinches says. Whether this was
because he was a highly developed deity or a product of folk religion it
is difficult to decide. One important fact is that the ruling king of
Assyria was more closely connected with the worship of Ashur than the
king of Babylonia was with the worship of Merodach. This may be because
the Assyrian king was regarded as an incarnation of his god, like the
Egyptian Pharaoh. Ashur accompanied the monarch on his campaigns: he was
their conquering war god. Where the king was, there was Ashur also. No
images were made of him,

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

but his symbols were carried aloft, as were the symbols of Indian gods
in the great war of the *Mahàbhàrata* epic.

It would appear that Ashur was sometimes worshipped in the temples of
other gods. In an interesting inscription he is associated with the moon
god Nannar (Sin) of Haran. Esarhaddon, the Assyrian king, is believed to
have been crowned in that city. "The writer", says Professor Pinches,
"is apparently addressing Assur-bani-apli, 'the great and noble
Asnapper':

<span class="small">"When the father of my king my lord went to Egypt,
he was crowned (?) in the *ganni* of Harrah, the temple (lit. 'Bethel')
of cedar. The god Sin remained over the (sacred) standard, two crowns
upon his head, (and) the god Nusku stood beside him. The father of the
king my lord entered, (and) he (the priest of Sin) placed (the crown?)
upon his head, (saying) thus: 'Thou shalt go and capture the lands in
the midst'. (He we)nt, he captured the land of Egypt. The rest of the
lands not submitting (?) to Assur (Ashur) and Sin, the king, the lord of
kings, shall capture (them)." <span
id="fr_404"></span>[1](#fn_402.md)</span>

Ashur and Sin are here linked as equals. Associated with them is Nusku,
the messenger of the gods, who was given prominence in Assyria. The
kings frequently invoked him. As the son of Ea he acted as the messenger
between Merodach and the god of the deep. He was also a son of Bel
Enlil, and like Anu was guardian or chief of the Igigi, the "host of
heaven". Professor Pinches suggests that he may have been either
identical with the Sumerian fire god Gibil, or a brother of the fire
god, and an impersonation of the light of fire and sun. In Haran he
accompanied the moon god, and may, therefore, have symbolized the light
of the moon also. Professor

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pinches adds that
in one inscription "he is identified with Nirig or En-reshtu" (Nin-Girsu
= Tammuz). <span id="fr_405"></span>[1](#fn_403.md)The Babylonians and
Assyrians associated fire and light with moisture and fertility.

The astral phase of the character of Ashur is highly probable. As has
been indicated, the Greek rendering of Anshar as "Assoros", is
suggestive in this connection. Jastrow, however, points out that the use
of the characters Anshar for Ashur did not obtain until the eighth
century B.C. "Linguistically", he says, "the change of Ashir to Ashur
can be accounted for, but not the transformation of An-shar to Ashur or
Ashir; so that we must assume the 'etymology' of Ashur, proposed by some
learned scribe, to be the nature of a play upon the name." <span
id="fr_406"></span>[2](#fn_404.md) On the other hand, it is possible that
what appears arbitrary to us may have been justified in ancient Assyria
on perfectly reasonable, or at any rate traditional, grounds. Professor
Pinches points out that as a sun god, and "at the same time not
Shamash", Ashur resembled Merodach. "His identification with Merodach,
if that was ever accepted, may have been due to the likeness of the word
to Asari, one of the deities' names." <span
id="fr_407"></span>[3](#fn_405.md) As Asari, Merodach has been compared to
the Egyptian Osiris, who, as the Nile god, was Asar-Hapi. Osiris
resembles Tammuz and was similarly a corn deity and a ruler of the
living and the dead, associated with sun, moon, stars, water, and
vegetation. We may consistently connect Ashur with Aushar, "water
field", Anshar, "god of the height", or "most high", and with the
eponymous King Asshur who went out on the land of Nimrod and "builded
Nineveh", if we regard him as of common origin with Tammuz, Osiris,

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

and Attis--a developed and localized form of the ancient deity of
fertility and corn.

Ashur had a spouse who is referred to as Ashuritu, or Beltu, "the lady".
Her name, however, is not given, but it is possible that she was
identified with the Ishtar of Nineveh. In the historical texts Ashur, as
the royal god, stands alone. Like the Hittite Great Father, he was
perhaps regarded as the origin of life. Indeed, it may have been due to
the influence of the northern hillmen in the early Assyrian period, that
Ashur was developed as a father god--a Baal. When the Hittite
inscriptions are read, more light may be thrown on the Ashur problem.
Another possible source of cultural influence is Persia. The supreme god
Ahura-Mazda (Ormuzd) was, as has been indicated, represented, like
Ashur, hovering over the king's head, enclosed in a winged disk or
wheel, and the sacred tree figured in Persian mythology. The early
Assyrian kings had non-Semitic and non-Sumerian names. It seems
reasonable to assume that the religious culture of the ethnic elements
they represented must have contributed to the development of the city
god of Asshur.
