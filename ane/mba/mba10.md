THE memorable sermon preached by Paul to the Athenians when he stood "in
the midst of Mars’ hill", could have been addressed with equal
appropriateness to the ancient Sumerians and Akkadians. "I perceive", he
declared, "that in all things ye are too superstitious. . . . God that
made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven
and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is
worshipped with men's hands as though he needed any thing, seeing he
giveth to all life, and breath, and all things . . . for in him we live,
and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have
said, For we are also his offspring. Forasmuch then as we are the
offspring of

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God, we ought not
to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven
by art and man's device." <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_77)

Babylonian temples were houses of the gods in the literal sense; the
gods were supposed to dwell in them, their spirits having entered into
the graven images or blocks of stone. It is probable that like the
Ancient Egyptians they believed a god had as many spirits as he had
attributes. The gods, as we have said, appear to have evolved from early
spirit groups. All the world swarmed with spirits, which inhabited
stones and trees, mountains and deserts, rivers and ocean, the air, the
sky, the stars, and the sun and moon. The spirits controlled Nature:
they brought light and darkness, sunshine and storm, summer and winter;
they were manifested in the thunderstorm, the sandstorm, the glare of
sunset, and the wraiths of mist rising from the steaming marshes. They
controlled also the lives of men and women. The good spirits were the
source of luck. The bad spirits caused misfortunes, and were ever
seeking to work evil against the Babylonian. Darkness was peopled by
demons and ghosts of the dead. The spirits of disease were ever lying in
wait to clutch him with cruel invisible hands.

Some modern writers, who are too prone to regard ancient peoples from a
twentieth-century point of view, express grave doubts as to whether
"intelligent Babylonians "really believed that spirits came down in the
rain and entered the soil to rise up before men's eyes as stalks of
barley or wheat. There is no reason for supposing that they thought
otherwise. The early folks based their theories on the accumulated
knowledge of their age. They knew nothing regarding the composition

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

of water or the atmosphere, of the cause of thunder and lightning, or of
the chemical changes effected in soils by the action of bacteria. They
attributed all natural phenomena to the operations of spirits or gods.
In believing that certain demons caused certain diseases, they may be
said to have achieved distinct. progress, for they anticipated the germ
theory. They made discoveries, too, which have been approved and
elaborated in later times when they lit sacred fires, bathed in sacred
waters, and used oils and herbs to charm away spirits of pestilence.
Indeed, many folk cures, which were originally associated with magical
ceremonies, are still practised in our own day. They were found to be
effective by early observers, although they were unable to explain why
and how cures were accomplished, like modern scientific investigators.

In peopling the Universe with spirits, the Babylonians, like other
ancient folks, betrayed that tendency to symbolize everything which has
ever appealed to the human mind. Our painters and poets and sculptors
are greatest when they symbolize their ideals and ideas and impressions,
and by so doing make us respond to their moods. Their "beauty and their
terror are sublime". But what may seem poetic to us, was invariably a
grim reality to the Babylonians. The statue or picture was not merely a
work of art but a manifestation of the god or demon. As has been said,
they believed that the spirit of the god inhabited the idol; the frown
of the brazen image was the frown of the wicked demon. They entertained
as much dread of the winged and human-headed bulls guarding the entrance
to the royal palace as do some of the Arab workmen who, in our own day,
assist excavators to rescue them from sandy mounds in which they have
been hidden for long centuries

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

When an idol was carried away from a city by an invading army, it was
believed that the god himself had been taken prisoner, and was therefore
unable any longer to help his people.

In the early stages of Sumerian culture, the gods and goddesses who
formed groups were indistinguishable from demons. They were vaguely
defined, and had changing shapes. When attempts were made to depict them
they were represented in many varying forms. Some were winged bulls or
lions with human heads; others had even more remarkable composite forms.
The "dragon of Babylon", for instance, which was portrayed on walls of
temples, had a serpent's head, a body covered with scales, the fore legs
of a lion, hind legs of an eagle, and a long wriggling serpentine tail.
Ea had several monster forms. The following description of one of these
is repulsive enough:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The head is the head of a serpent,  
From his nostrils mucus trickles,  
His mouth is beslavered with water;  
The ears are like those of a basilisk,  
His horns are twisted into three curls,  
He wears a veil in his head band,  
The body is a suh-fish full of stars,  
The base of his feet are claws,  
The sole of his foot has no heel,  
His name is Sassu-wunnu,  
A sea monster, a form of Ea.  
                             R. C. Thompson's Translation. <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_78)</span>

</div>

Even after the gods were given beneficent attributes;, to reflect the
growth of culture, and were humanized, they still retained many of their
savage characteristics. Bel Enlil and his fierce son, Nergal, were
destroyers

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

of mankind; the storm god desolated the land; the sky god deluged it
with rain; the sea raged furiously, ever hungering for human victims;
the burning sun struck down its victims; and the floods played havoc
with the dykes and houses of human beings. In Egypt the sun god Ra was
similarly a "producer of calamity", the composite monster god Sokar was
"the lord of fear". <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_79) Osiris in
prehistoric times had been "a dangerous god", and some of the Pharaohs
sought protection against him in the charms inscribed in their
tombs. <span id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_80) The Indian Shiva, "the
Destroyer", in the old religious poems has also primitive attributes of
like character.

The Sumerian gods never lost their connection with the early spirit
groups. These continued to be represented by their attendants, who
executed a deity's stern and vengeful decrees. In one of the Babylonian
charms the demons are referred to as "the spleen of the gods"--the
symbols of their wrathful emotions and vengeful desires. Bel Enlil, the
air and earth god, was served by the demons of disease, "the beloved
sons of Bel", which issued from the Underworld to attack mankind.
Nergal, the sulky and ill-tempered lord of death and destruction, who
never lost his demoniac character, swept over the land, followed by the
spirits of pestilence, sunstroke, weariness, and destruction. Anu, the
sky god, had "spawned" at creation the demons of cold and rain and
darkness. Even Ea and his consort, Damkina, were served by groups of
devils and giants, which preyed upon mankind in bleak and desolate
places when night fell. In the ocean home of Ea were bred the "seven
evil spirits" of tempest--the gaping dragon, the leopard which preyed
upon children, the great Beast, the terrible serpent, &c.

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

In Indian mythology Indra was similarly followed by the stormy Maruts,
and fierce Rudra by the tempestuous Rudras. In Teutonic mythology Odin
is the "Wild Huntsman in the Raging Host". In Greek mythology the ocean
furies attend upon fickle Poseidon. Other examples of this kind could be
multiplied.

As we have seen ([Chapter II](mba08.htm#an_ch-02)) the earliest group of
Babylonian deities consisted probably of four pairs of gods and
goddesses as in Egypt. The first pair was Apsu-Rishtu and Tiamat, who
personified the primordial deep. Now the elder deities in most
mythologies--the "grandsires" and "grandmothers" and "fathers" and
"mothers"--are ever the most powerful and most vengeful. They appear to
represent primitive "layers" of savage thought. The Greek Cronos devours
even his own children, and, as the late Andrew Lang has shown, there are
many parallels to this myth among primitive peoples in various parts of
the world.

Lang regarded the Greek survival as an example of "the conservatism of
the religious instinct". <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_81) The
grand-mother of the Teutonic deity Tyr was a fierce giantess with nine
hundred heads; his father was an enemy of the gods. In Scotland the
hag-mother of winter and storm and darkness is the enemy of growth and
all life, and she raises storms to stop the grass growing, to slay young
animals, and prevent the union of her son with his fair bride. Similarly
the Babylonian chaos spirits, Apsu and Tiamat, the father and mother of
the gods, resolve to destroy their offspring, because they begin to set
the Universe in order. Tiamat, the female dragon, is more powerful than
her husband Apsu, who is slain by his son Ea. She summons to her aid the
gods of evil, and creates also a brood of monsters--serpents,

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

dragons, vipers, fish men, raging hounds, &c.--so as to bring about
universal and enduring confusion and evil. Not until she is destroyed
can the beneficent gods establish law and order and make the earth
habitable and beautiful.

But although Tiamat was slain, the everlasting battle between the forces
of good and evil was ever waged in the Babylonian world. Certain evil
spirits were let loose at certain periods, and they strove to accomplish
the destruction of mankind and his works. These invisible enemies were
either charmed away by performing magical ceremonies, or by invoking the
gods to thwart them and bind them.

Other spirits inhabited the bodies of animals and were ever hovering
near. The ghosts of the dead and male and female demons were birds, like
the birds of Fate which sang to Siegfried. When the owl raised its
melancholy voice in the darkness the listener heard the spirit of a
departed mother crying for her child. Ghosts and evil spirits wandered
through the streets in darkness; they haunted empty houses; they
fluttered through the evening air as bats; they hastened, moaning
dismally, across barren wastes searching for food or lay in wait for
travellers; they came as roaring lions and howling jackals, hungering
for human flesh. The "shedu" was a destructive bull which might slay man
wantonly or as a protector of temples. Of like character was the
"lamassu", depicted as a winged bull with human head, the protector of
palaces; the "alu" was a bull-like demon of tempest, and there were also
many composite, distorted, or formless monsters which were vaguely
termed "seizers" or "overthrowers", the Semitic "labashu" and
"ach-chazu", the Sumerian "dimmea" and "dimme-kur". A dialectic form of
"gallu" or devil

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

was "mulla". Professor Pinches thinks it not improbable that "mulla" may
be connected with the word "mula", meaning "star", and suggests that it
referred to a "will-o’-the-wisp". <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_82) In
these islands, according to an old rhyme,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Some call him Robin Good-fellow,  
  Hob-goblin, or mad Crisp,  
And some againe doe tearme him oft  
  By name of Will the Wisp.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Other names are
"Kitty", "Peg", and "Jack with a lantern". "Poor Robin" sang:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I should indeed as soon expect  
That Peg-a-lantern would direct  
Me straightway home on misty night  
As wand’ring stars, quite out of sight.</span>

</div>

In Shakespeare's *Tempest* <span id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_83) a sailor
exclaims: "Your fairy, which, you say, is a harmless fairy, has done
little better than played the Jack with us". Dr. Johnson commented that
the reference was to "Jack with a lantern". Milton wrote also of the
"wandering fire",

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Which oft, they say, some evil spirit attends,  
Hovering and blazing with delusive light,  
Misleads th’ amaz’d night wand’rer from his way  
To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool;  
There swallowed up and lost from succour far. <span
id="fr_85"></span>[3](#fn_84)</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "When we stick in
the mire", sang Drayton, "he doth with laughter leave us." These fires
were also "fallen stars", "death fires", and "fire drakes":

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">So have I seen a fire drake glide along  
Before a dying man, to point his grave,  
And in it stick and hide. <span id="fr_86"></span>[4](#fn_85)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

Pliny referred to the wandering lights as stars. <span
id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_86) The Sumerian "mulla" was undoubtedly an
evil spirit. In some countries the "fire drake" is a bird with gleaming
breast: in Babylonia it assumed the form of a bull, and may have had
some connection with the bull of Ishtar. Like the Indian "Dasyu" and
"Dasa", <span id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_87) Gallu was applied in the
sense of "foreign devil" to human and superhuman adversaries of certain
monarchs. Some of the supernatural beings resemble our elves and fairies
and the Indian Rakshasas. Occasionally they appear in comely human
guise; at other times they are vaguely monstrous. The best known of this
class is Lilith, who, according to Hebrew tradition, preserved in the
Talmud, was the demon lover of Adam. She has been immortalized by Dante
Gabriel Rossetti:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Of Adam's first wife Lilith, it is told  
(The witch he loved before the gift of Eve)  
That, ere the snake's, her sweet tongue could deceive,  
And her enchanted hair was the first gold.  
And still she sits, young while the earth is old,  
And, subtly of herself contemplative,  
Draws men to watch the bright web she can weave,  
Till heart and body and life are in its hold.  
The rose and poppy are her flowers; for where  
Is he not found, O Lilith, whom shed scent  
And soft shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare?  
Lo! as that youth's eyes burned at thine, so went  
Thy spell through him, and left his straight neck bent  
And round his heart one strangling golden hair.</span>

</div>

Lilith is the Babylonian Lilithu, a feminine form of Lilu, the Sumerian
Lila. She resembles Surpanakha of the *Ràmàyana*, who made love to Rama
and Lakshmana, and the sister of the demon Hidimva, who became

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

enamoured of Bhima, one of the heroes of the *Mahàbhàrata*, <span
id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_88) and the various fairy lovers of Europe who
lured men to eternal imprisonment inside mountains, or vanished for ever
when they were completely under their influence, leaving them demented.
The elfin Lilu similarly wooed young women, like the Germanic Laurin of
the "Wonderful Rose Garden", <span id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_89) who
carried away the fair lady Kunhild to his underground dwelling amidst
the Tyrolese mountains, or left them haunting the place of their
meetings, searching for him in vain:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">A savage place! as holy and enchanted  
As ere beneath the waning moon was haunted  
By woman wailing for her demon lover . . .  
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!  
Weave a circle round him thrice,  
And close your eyes with holy dread,  
For he on honey dew hath fed  
And drunk the milk of Paradise.  
                               *Coleridge's Kubla Khan*.</span>

</div>

Another materializing spirit of this class was Ardat Lili, who appears
to have wedded human beings like the swan maidens, the mermaids, and
Nereids of the European folk tales, and the goddess Ganga, who for a
time was the wife of King Shantanu of the *Mahàbhàrata*. <span
id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_90)

The Labartu, to whom we have referred, was a female who haunted
mountains and marshes; like the fairies and hags of Europe, she stole or
afflicted children, who accordingly had to wear charms round their necks
for protection. Seven of these supernatural beings were reputed to be
daughters of Anu, the sky god.

The Alu, a storm deity, was also a spirit which caused nightmare. It
endeavoured to smother sleepers like the

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Scandinavian hag
Mara, and similarly deprived them of power to move. In Babylonia this
evil spirit might also cause sleeplessness or death by hovering near a
bed. In shape it might be as horrible and repulsive as the Egyptian
ghosts which caused children to die from fright or by sucking out the
breath of life.

As most representatives of the spirit world were enemies of the living,
so were the ghosts of dead men and women. Death chilled all human
affections; it turned love to hate; the deeper the love had been, the
deeper became the enmity fostered by the ghost. Certain ghosts might
also be regarded as particularly virulent and hostile if they happened
to have left the body of one who was ceremonially impure. The most
terrible ghost in Babylonia was that of a woman who had died in
childbed. She was pitied and dreaded; her grief had demented her; she
was doomed to wail in the darkness; her impurity clung to her like
poison. No spirit was more prone to work evil against mankind, and her
hostility was accompanied by the most tragic sorrow. In Northern India
the Hindus, like the ancient Babylonians, regard as a fearsome demon the
ghost of a woman who died while pregnant, or on the day of the child's
birth. <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_91) A similar belief prevailed in
Mexico. In Europe there are many folk tales of dead mothers who return
to avenge themselves on the cruel fathers of neglected children.

A sharp contrast is presented by the Mongolian Buriats, whose outlook on
the spirit world is less gloomy than was that of the ancient
Babylonians. According to Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, this interesting people
are wont to perform a ceremony with purpose to entice the ghost to
return to the dead body--a proceeding which is

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

dreaded in the Scottish Highlands. <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_92)
The Buriats address the ghost, saying: "You shall sleep well. Come back
to your natural ashes. Take pity on your friends. It is necessary to
live a real life. Do not wander along the mountains. Do not be like bad
spirits. Return to your peaceful home. . . . Come back and work for your
children. How can you leave the little ones?" If it is a mother, these
words have great effect; sometimes the spirit moans and sobs, and the
Buriats tell that there have been instances of it returning to the
body. <span id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_93) In his Arabia Deserta <span
id="fr_95"></span>[3](#fn_94) Doughty relates that Arab women and
children mock the cries of the owl. One explained to him: "It is a
wailful woman seeking her lost child; she has become this forlorn bird".
So do immemorial beliefs survive to our own day.

The Babylonian ghosts of unmarried men and women and of those without
offspring were also disconsolate night wanderers. Others who suffered
similar fates were the ghosts of men who died in battle far from home
and were left unburied, the ghosts of travellers who perished in the
desert and were not covered over, the ghosts of drowned men which rose
from the water, the ghosts of prisoners starved to death or executed,
the ghosts of people who died violent deaths before their appointed
time. The dead required to be cared for, to have libations poured out,
to be fed, so that they might not prowl

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

through the streets or enter houses searching for scraps of food and
pure water. The duty of giving offerings to the dead was imposed
apparently on near relatives. As in India, it would appear that the
eldest son performed the funeral ceremony: a dreadful fate therefore
awaited the spirit of the dead Babylonian man or woman without
offspring. In Sanskrit literature there is a reference to a priest who
was not allowed to enter Paradise, although he had performed rigid
penances, because he had no children. <span
id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_95)

There were hags and giants of mountain and desert, of river and ocean.
Demons might possess the pig, the goat, the horse, the lion, or the
ibis, the raven, or the hawk. The seven spirits of tempest, fire, and
destruction rose from the depths of ocean, and there were hosts of
demons which could not be overcome or baffled by man without the
assistance of the gods to whom they were hostile. Many were sexless;
having no offspring, they were devoid of mercy and compassion. They
penetrated everywhere:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The high enclosures, the broad enclosures, like a
flood they pass through,  
From house to house they dash along.  
No door can shut them out;  
No bolt can turn them back.  
Through the door, like a snake, they glide,  
Through the hinge, like the wind, they storm,  
Tearing the wife from the embrace of the man,  
Driving the freedman from his family home. <span
id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_96)</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> These furies did
not confine their unwelcomed attentions to mankind alone:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">They hunt the doves from their cotes,  
And drive the birds from their nests, <span id="page_72">p. 72</span>  
And chase the marten from its hole. . . .  
Through the gloomy street by night they roam,  
Smiting sheepfold and cattle pen,  
Shutting up the land as with door and bolt.  
                           *R. C. Thompson's Translation*.</span>

</div>

The Babylonian poet, like Burns, was filled with pity for the animals
which suffered in the storm:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">List’ning the doors an’ winnocks rattle,  
I thought me o’ the ourie cattle,  
Or silly sheep, wha bide this brattle  
     O’ winter war. . . .  
Ilk happing bird, wee, helpless thing!  
That in the merry months o’ spring  
Delighted me to hear thee sing,  
     What comes o’ thee?  
Whare wilt thou cow’r thy chittering wing,  
     And close thy e’e?</span>

</div>

According to Babylonian belief, "the great storms directed from heaven"
were caused by demons. Mankind heard them "loudly roaring above,
gibbering below". <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_97) The south wind was
raised by Shutu, a plumed storm demon resembling Hraesvelgur of the
Icelandic Eddas:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Corpse-swallower sits at the end of heaven,  
   A Jötun in eagle form;  
From his wings, they say, comes the wind which fares  
   Over all the dwellers of earth. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_98)</span>

</div>

The northern story of Thor's fishing, when he hooked and wounded the
Midgard serpent, is recalled by the Babylonian legend of Adapa, son of
the god Ea. This hero was engaged catching fish, when Shutu, the south
wind, upset his boat. In his wrath Adapa immediately attacked the storm
demon and shattered her pinions. Anu, the sky god, was moved to anger
against Ea's son

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

and summoned him to the Celestial Court. Adapa, however, appeared in
garments of mourning and was forgiven.

Anu offered him the water of life and the bread of life which would have
made him immortal, but Ea's son refused to eat or drink, believing, as
his father had warned him, that the sky god desired him to partake of
the bread of death and to drink of the water of death.

Another terrible atmospheric demon was the south-west wind, which caused
destructive storms and floods, and claimed many human victims like the
Icelandic "corpse swallower". She was depicted with lidless staring
eyes, broad flat nose, mouth gaping horribly, and showing tusk-like
teeth, and with high cheek bones, heavy eyebrows, and low bulging
forehead.

In Scotland the hag of the south-west wind is similarly a bloodthirsty
and fearsome demon. She is most virulent in the springtime. At Cromarty
she is quaintly called "Gentle Annie" by the fisher folks, who repeat
the saying: "When Gentle Annie is skyawlan (yelling) roond the heel of
Ness (a promontory) wi’ a white feather on her hat (the foam of big
billows) they (the spirits) will be harrying (robbing) the crook"--that
is, the pot which hangs from the crook is empty during the spring
storms, which prevent fishermen going to sea. In England the wind hag is
Black Annis, who dwells in a Leicestershire hill cave. She may be
identical with the Irish hag Anu, associated with the "Paps of Anu".
According to Gaelic lore, this wind demon of spring is the "Cailleach"
(old wife). She gives her name In the Highland calendar to the stormy
period of late spring; she raises gale after gale to prevent the coming
of summer. Angerboda, the Icelandic hag, is also a storm demon, but
represents the east wind. A Tyrolese folk

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

tale tells of three magic maidens who dwelt on Jochgrimm mountain, where
they "brewed the winds". Their demon lovers were Ecke, "he who causes
fear"; Vasolt, "he who causes dismay"; and the scornful Dietrich in his
mythical character of Donar or Thunor (Thor), the thunderer.

Another Sumerian storm demon was the Zu bird, which is represented among
the stars by Pegasus and Taurus. A legend relates that this "worker of
evil, who raised the head of evil", once aspired to rule the gods, and
stole from Bel, "the lord" of deities, the Tablets of Destiny, which
gave him his power over the Universe as controller of the fates of all.
The Zu bird escaped with the Tablets and found shelter on its mountain
top in Arabia. Anu called on Ramman, the thunderer, to attack the Zu
bird, but he was afraid; other gods appear to have shrunk from the
conflict. How the rebel was overcome is not certain, because the legend
survives in fragmentary form. There is a reference, however, to the moon
god setting out towards the mountain in Arabia with purpose to outwit
the Zu bird and recover the lost Tablets. How he fared it is impossible
to ascertain. In another legend--that of Etana--the mother serpent,
addressing the sun god, Shamash, says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Thy net is like unto the broad earth;  
Thy snare is like unto the distant heaven!  
Who hath ever escaped from thy net?  
Even Zu, the worker of evil, who raised the head of evil \[did not
escape\]!  
                             *L. W. King's Translation*.</span>

</div>

In Indian mythology, Garuda, half giant, half eagle, robs the Amrita
(ambrosia) of the gods which gives them their power and renders them
immortal. It had assumed a golden body, bright as the sun. Indra, the
thunderer,

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

flung his bolt in vain; he could not wound Garuda, and only displaced a
single feather. Afterwards, however, he stole the moon goblet containing
the Amrita, which Garuda had delivered to his enemies, the serpents, to
free his mother from bondage. This Indian eagle giant became the vehicle
of the god Vishnu, and, according to the *Mahàbhàrata*, "mocked the wind
with his fleetness".

It would appear that the Babylonian Zu bird symbolized the summer
sandstorms from the Arabian desert. Thunder is associated with the rainy
season, and it may have been assumed, therefore, that the thunder god
was powerless against the sandstorm demon, who was chased, however, by
the moon, and finally overcome by the triumphant sun when it broke
through the darkening sand drift and brightened heaven and earth,
"netting" the rebellious demon who desired to establish the rule of evil
over gods and mankind.

In the "Legend of Etana" the Eagle, another demon which links with the
Indian Garuda, slayer of serpents, devours the brood of the Mother
Serpent. For this offence against divine law, Shamash, the sun god,
pronounces the Eagle's doom. He instructs the Mother Serpent to slay a
wild ox and conceal herself in its entrails. The Eagle comes to feed on
the carcass, unheeding the warning of one of his children, who says,
"The serpent lies in this wild ox":

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">He swooped down and stood upon the wild ox,  
The Eagle . . . examined the flesh;  
He looked about carefully before and behind him;  
He again examined the flesh;  
He looked about carefully before and behind him,  
Then, moving swiftly, he made for the hidden parts.  
'When he entered into the midst,  
The serpent seized him by his wing.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In vain the Eagle
appealed for mercy to the Mother Serpent, who was compelled to execute
the decree of Shamash; she tore off the Eagle's pinions, wings, and
claws, and threw him into a pit where he perished from hunger and
thirst. <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_99) This myth may refer to the
ravages of a winged demon of disease who was thwarted by the sacrifice
of an ox. The Mother Serpent appears to be identical with an ancient
goddess of maternity resembling the Egyptian Bast, the serpent mother of
Bubastis. According to Sumerian belief, Nintu, "a form of the goddess
Ma", was half a serpent. On her head there is a horn; she is "girt about
the loins"; her left arm holds "a babe suckling her breast":

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">From her head to her loins  
The body is that of a naked woman;  
From the loins to the sole of the foot  
Scales like those of a snake are visible.  
                     *R. C. Thompson's Translation*.</span>

The close association of gods and demons is illustrated in an obscure
myth which may refer to an eclipse of the moon or a night storm at the
beginning of the rainy season. The demons go to war against the high
gods, and are assisted by Adad (Ramman) the thunderer, Shamash the sun,
and Ishtar. They desire to wreck the heavens, the home of Anu:

They clustered angrily round the crescent of the moon god,  
And won over to their aid Shamash, the mighty, and Adad, the warrior,  
And Ishtar, who with Anu, the King,  
Hath founded a shining dwelling.

The moon god Sin, "the seed of mankind", was darkened by the demons who
raged, "rushing loose over

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

the land" like to the wind. Bel called upon his messenger, whom he sent
to Ea in the ocean depths, saying: "My son Sin . . . hath been
grievously bedimmed". Ea lamented, and dispatched his son Merodach to
net the demons by magic, using "a two-coloured cord from the hair of a
virgin kid and from the wool of a virgin lamb." <span
id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_100)

As in India, where Shitala, the Bengali goddess of smallpox, for
instance, is worshipped when the dreaded disease she controls becomes
epidemic, so in Babylonia the people sought to secure immunity from
attack by worshipping spirits of disease. A tablet relates that Ura, a
plague demon, once resolved to destroy all life, but ultimately
consented to spare those who praised his name and exalted him in
recognition of his bravery and power. This could be accomplished by
reciting a formula. Indian serpent worshippers believe that their
devotions "destroy all danger proceeding from snakes". <span
id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_101)

Like the Ancient Egyptians, the Babylonians also had their kindly
spirits who brought luck and the various enjoyments of life. A good
"labartu" might attend on a human being like a household fairy of India
or Europe: a friendly "shedu" could protect a household against the
attacks of fierce demons and human enemies. Even the spirits of Fate who
served Anu, god of the sky, and that "Nom" of the Underworld,
Eresh-ki-gal, queen of Hades, might sometimes be propitious: if the
deities were successfully invoked they could cause the Fates to smite
spirits of disease and bringers of ill luck. Damu, a friendly fairy
goddess, was well loved, because she inspired pleasant dreams, relieved
the sufferings of the

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

afflicted, and restored to good health those patients whom she selected
to favour.

In the Egyptian *Book of the Dead* the kindly spirits are overshadowed
by the evil ones, because the various magical spells which were put on
record were directed against those supernatural beings who were enemies
of mankind. Similarly in Babylonia the fragments of this class of
literature which survive deal mainly with wicked and vengeful demons. It
appears probable, however, that the highly emotional Sumerians and
Akkadians were on occasion quite as cheerful a people as the inhabitants
of ancient Egypt. Although they were surrounded by bloodthirsty furies
who desired to shorten their days, and their nights were filled with
vague lowering phantoms which inspired fear, they no doubt shared, in
their charm-protected houses, a comfortable feeling of security after
performing magical ceremonies, and were happy enough when they gathered
round flickering lights to listen to ancient song and story and gossip
about crops and traders, the members of the royal house, and the family
affairs of their acquaintances.

The Babylonian spirit world, it will be seen, was of complex character.
Its inhabitants were numberless, but often vaguely defined, and one
class of demons linked with another. Like the European fairies of folk
belief; the Babylonian spirits were extremely hostile and irresistible
at certain seasonal periods; and they were fickle and perverse and
difficult to please even when inclined to be friendly. They were also
similarly manifested from time to time in various forms. Sometimes they
were comely and beautiful; at other times they were apparitions of
horror. The Jinn of present-day Arabians are of like character; these
may be giants, cloudy shapes, comely women, serpents or cats, goats or
pigs.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

Some of the composite monsters of Babylonia may suggest the vague and
exaggerated recollections of terror-stricken people who have had
glimpses of unfamiliar wild beasts in the dusk or amidst reedy marshes.
But they cannot be wholly accounted for in this way. While animals were
often identified with supernatural beings, and foreigners were called
"devils", it would be misleading to assert that the spirit world
reflects confused folk memories of human and bestial enemies. Even when
a demon was given concrete human form it remained essentially non-human:
no ordinary weapon could inflict an injury, and it was never controlled
by natural laws. The spirits of disease and tempest and darkness were
creations of fancy: they symbolized moods; they were the causes which
explained effects. A sculptor or storyteller who desired to convey an
impression of a spirit of storm or pestilence created monstrous forms to
inspire terror. Sudden and unexpected visits of fierce and devastating
demons were accounted for by asserting that they had wings like eagles,
were nimble-footed as gazelles, cunning and watchful as serpents; that
they had claws to clutch, horns to gore, and powerful fore legs like a
lion to smite down victims. Withal they drank blood like ravens and
devoured corpses like hyænas. Monsters were all the more repulsive when
they were partly human. The human-headed snake or the snake-headed man
and the man with the horns of a wild bull and the legs of a goat were
horrible in the extreme. Evil spirits might sometimes achieve success by
practising deception. They might appear as beautiful girls or handsome
men and seize unsuspecting victims in deathly embrace or leave them
demented and full of grief, or come as birds and suddenly assume awesome
shapes.

Fairies and elves, and other half-human demons, are

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

sometimes regarded as degenerate gods. It will be seen, however, that
while certain spirits developed into deities, others remained something
between these two classes of supernatural beings: they might attend upon
gods and goddesses, or operate independently now against mankind and now
against deities even. The "namtaru", for instance, was a spirit of fate,
the son of Bel-Enlil and Eresh-ki -gal, queen of Hades. "Apparently",
writes Professor Pinches, "he executed the instructions given him
concerning the fate of men, and could also have power over certain of
the gods." <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_102) To this middle class
belong the evil gods who rebelled against the beneficent deities.
According to Hebridean folk belief, the fallen angels are divided into
three classes--the fairies, the "nimble men" (aurora borealis), and the
"blue men of the Minch". In *Beowulf* the "brood of Cain" includes
"monsters and elves and sea-devils--giants also, who long time fought
with God, for which he gave them their reward". <span
id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_103) Similarly the Babylonian spirit groups
are liable to division and subdivision. The various classes may be
regarded as relics of the various stages of development from crude
animism to sublime monotheism: in the fragmentary legends we trace the
floating material from which great mythologies have been framed.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[70:1](mba10.htm#fr_93) When a person, young or
old, is dying, near relatives must not call out their names in case the
soul may come back from the spirit world. A similar belief still
lingers, especially among women, in the Lowlands. The writer was once
present in a room when a child was supposed to be dying. Suddenly the
mother called out the child's name in agonized voice. It revived soon
afterwards. Two old women who had attempted to prevent "the calling"
shook their heads and remarked: "She has done it! The child will never
do any good in this world after being called back." In England and
Ireland, as well as in Scotland, the belief also prevails in certain
localities that if a dying person is "called back" the soul will tarry
for another twenty-four hours, during which the individual will suffer
great agony.
