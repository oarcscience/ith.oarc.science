Importance of Race Movements.</span>

GREAT changes were taking place in the ancient world during the period
in which Assyria rose into prominence and suddenly suffered decline.
These were primarily due to widespread migrations of pastoral peoples
from the steppe lands of Asia and Europe, and the resulting displacement
of settled tribes. The military operations of the great Powers were also
a disturbing factor, for they not only propelled fresh movements beyond
their spheres of influence, but caused the petty States to combine
against a common enemy and foster ambitions to achieve conquests on a
large scale.

Towards the close of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, of which Amenhotep
III and Akhenaton were the last great kings, two well-defined migrations
were in

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

progress. The Aramæan folk-waves had already begun to pour in increasing
volume into Syria from Arabia, and in Europe the pastoral fighting folk
from the mountains were establishing themselves along the south-eastern
coast and crossing the Hellespont to overrun the land of the Hittites.
These race movements were destined to exercise considerable influence in
shaping the history of the ancient world.

The Aramæan, or Third Semitic migration, in time swamped various
decaying States. Despite the successive efforts of the great Powers to
hold it in check, it ultimately submerged the whole of Syria and part of
Mesopotamia. Aramæan speech then came into common use among the mingled
peoples over a wide area, and was not displaced until the time of the
Fourth Semitic or Moslem migration from Arabia, which began in the
seventh century of the Christian era, and swept northward through Syria
to Asia Minor, eastward across Mesopotamia into Persia and India, and
westward through Egypt along the north African coast to Morocco, and
then into Spain.

When Syria was sustaining the first shocks of Aramæan invasion, the last
wave of Achæans, "the tamers of horses" and "shepherds of the people",
had achieved the conquest of Greece, and contributed to the overthrow of
the dynasty of King Minos of Crete. Professor Ridgeway identifies this
stock, which had been filtering southward for several centuries, with
the tall, fair-haired, and grey-eyed "Keltoi" (Celts), <span
id="fr_414"></span>[1](#fn_412.md) who, Dr. Haddon believes, were
representatives of "the mixed peoples of northern and Alpine
descent". <span id="fr_415"></span>[2](#fn_413.md) Mr. Hawes, following
Professor Sergi, holds, on the other hand, that the Achæans were

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "fair in
comparison with the native (Pelasgian-Mediterranean) stock, but not
necessarily blonde". <span id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_414.md) The earliest
Achæans were rude, uncultured barbarians, but the last wave came from
some unknown centre of civilization, and probably used iron as well as
bronze weapons.

The old Cretans were known to the Egyptians as the "Keftiu", and traded
on the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It is significant to find,
however, that no mention is made of them in the inscriptions of the
Pharaohs after the reign of Amenhotep III. In their place appear the
Shardana, the Mykenæan people who gave their name to Sardinia, the
Danauna, believed to be identical with the Danaoi of Homer, the
Akhaivasha, perhaps the Achæans, and the Tursha and Shakalsha, who may
have been of the same stock as the piratical Lycians.

When Rameses II fought his famous battle at Kadesh the Hittite king
included among his allies the Aramæans from Arabia, and other
mercenaries like the Dardanui and Masa, who represented the
Thraco-Phrygian peoples who had overrun the Balkans, occupied Thrace and
Macedonia, and crossed into Asia Minor. In time the Hittite confederacy
was broken up by the migrating Europeans, and their dominant tribe, the
Muski <span id="fr_417"></span>[2](#fn_415.md)--the Moschoi of the Greeks
and the Meshech of the Old Testament--came into conflict with the
Assyrians. The Muski were fore-runners of the Phrygians, and were
probably of allied stock.

Pharaoh Meneptah, the son of Rameses II, did not benefit much by the
alliance with the Hittites, to whom he had to send a supply of grain
during a time of famine. He found it necessary, indeed, to invade Syria,
where their influence had declined, and had to beat back from the Delta
region the piratical invaders of the same tribes

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

as were securing a footing in Asia Minor. In Syria Meneptah fought with
the Israelites, who apparently had begun their conquest of Canaan during
his reign.

Before the Kassite Dynasty had come to an end, Rameses III of Egypt
(1198--1167 B.C.) freed his country from the perils of a great invasion
of Europeans by land and sea. He scattered a fleet on the Delta coast,
and then arrested the progress of a strong force which was pressing
southward through Phoenicia towards the Egyptian frontier. These events
occurred at the beginning of the Homeric Age, and were followed by the
siege of Troy, which, according to the Greeks, began about 1194 B.C.

The land raiders who were thwarted by Rameses III were the Philistines,
a people from Crete. <span id="fr_418"></span>[1](#fn_416.md) When the
prestige of Egypt suffered decline they overran the coast-line of
Canaan, and that country was then called Palestine, "the land of the
Philistines", while the Egyptian overland trade route to Phoenicia
became known as "the way of the Philistines". Their conflicts with the
Hebrews are familiar to readers of the Old Testament. "The only
contributions the Hebrews made to the culture of the country", writes
Professor Macalister, "were their simple desert customs and their
religious organization. On the other hand, the Philistines, sprung from
one of the great homes of art of the ancient world, had brought with
them the artistic instincts of their race: decayed no doubt, but still
superior to anything they met with in the land itself. Tombs to be
ascribed to them, found in Gezer, contained beautiful jewellery and
ornaments. The Philistines, in fact, were the only cultured or artistic
race who ever occupied the soil of Palestine, at least until the time
when the influence of classical Greece asserted itself too strongly

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

to be withstood. Whatsoever things raised life in the country above the
dull animal existence of fellahin were due to this people. . . . The
peasantry of the modern villages . . . still tell of the great days of
old when it (Palestine) was inhabited by the mighty race of the
'Fenish'." <span id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_417.md)

When the Kassite Dynasty of Babylonia was extinguished, about 1140 B.C.,
the Amorites were being displaced in Palestine by the Philistines and
the Israelitish tribes; the Aramæans were extending their conquests in
Syria and Mesopotamia; the Muski were the overlords of the Hittites;
Assyrian power was being revived at the beginning of the second period
of the Old Empire; and Egypt was governed by a weakly king, Rameses
VIII, a puppet in the hands of the priesthood, who was unable to protect
the rich tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty Pharaohs against the bands of
professional robbers who were plundering them.

A new dynasty--the Dynasty of Pashe--had arisen at the ancient Sumerian
city of Isin. Its early kings were contemporary with some of the last
Kassite monarchs, and they engaged in conflicts with the Elamites, who
were encroaching steadily upon Babylonian territory, and were ultimately
able to seize the province of Namar, famous for its horses, which was
situated to the east of Akkad. The Assyrians, under Ashur-dan I, were
not only reconquering lost territory, but invading Babylonia and
carrying off rich plunder. Ashur-dan inflicted a crushing defeat upon
the second-last Kassite ruler.

There years later Nebuchadrezzar I, of the Dynasty of Pashe, seized the
Babylonian throne. He was the most powerful and distinguished monarch of
his line--an accomplished general and a wise statesman. His name

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

signifies: "May the god Nebo protect my boundary". His first duty was to
drive the Elamites from the land, and win back from them the statue of
Merodach which they had carried off from E-sagila. At first he suffered
a reverse, but although the season was midsummer, and the heat
overpowering, he persisted in his campaign. The Elamites were forced to
retreat, and following up their main force he inflicted upon them a
shattering defeat on the banks of the Ula, a tributary of the Tigris. He
then invaded Elam and returned with rich booty. The province of Namar
was recovered, and its governor, Ritti Merodach, who was
Nebuchadrezzar's battle companion, was restored to his family
possessions and exempted from taxation. A second raid to Elam resulted
in the recovery of the statue of Merodach. The Kassite and Lullume
mountaineers also received attention, and were taught to respect the
power of the new monarch.

Having freed his country from the yoke of the Elamites, and driven the
Assyrians over the frontier, Nebuchadrezzar came into conflict with the
Hittites, who appear to have overrun Mesopotamia. Probably the invaders
were operating in conjunction with the Muski, who were extending their
sway over part of northern Assyria. They were not content with securing
control of the trade route, but endeavoured also to establish themselves
permanently in Babylon, the commercial metropolis, which they besieged
and captured. This happened in the third year of Nebuchadrezzar, when he
was still reigning at Isin. Assembling a strong force, he hastened
northward and defeated the Hittites, and apparently followed up his
victory. Probably it was at this time that he conquered the "West Land"
(the land of the Amorites) and penetrated to the Mediterranean coast.
Egyptian power had been long extinguished in that region.

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

The possession of Mesopotamia was a signal triumph for Babylonia. As was
inevitable, however, it brought Nebuchadrezzar into conflict some years
later with the Assyrian king, Ashur-resh-ishi I, grandson of Ashur-dan,
and father of the famous Tiglath-pileser I. The northern monarch had
engaged himself in subduing the Lullume and Akhlami hill tribes in the
south-east, whose territory had been conquered by Nebuchadrezzar.
Thereafter he crossed the Babylonian frontier. Nebuchadrezzar drove him
back and then laid siege to the border fortress of Zanki, but the
Assyrian king conducted a sudden and successful reconnaissance in force
which rendered perilous the position of the attacking force. By setting
fire to his siege train the Babylonian war lord was able, however, to
retreat in good order.

Some time later Nebuchadrezzar dispatched another army northward, but it
suffered a serious defeat, and its general, Karashtu, fell into the
hands of the enemy.

Nebuchadrezzar reigned less than twenty years, and appears to have
secured the allegiance of the nobility by restoring the feudal system
which had been abolished by the Kassites. He boasted that he was "the
sun of his country, who restored ancient landmarks and boundaries", and
promoted the worship of Ishtar, the ancient goddess of the people. By
restoring the image of Merodach he secured the support of Babylon, to
which city he transferred his Court.

Nebuchadrezzar was succeeded by his son Ellil-nadin-apil, who reigned a
few years; but little or nothing is known regarding him. His grandson,
Marduk-nadin-akhe, came into conflict with Tiglath-pileser I of Assyria,
and suffered serious reverses, from the effects of which his country did
not recover for over a century.

Tiglath-pileser I, in one of his inscriptions, recorded

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

significantly: "The feet of the enemy I kept from my country". When he
came to the throne, northern Assyria was menaced by the Muski and their
allies, the Hittites and the Shubari of old Mitanni. The Kashiari hill
tribes to the north of Nineveh, whom Shalmaneser I subdued, had half a
century before thrown off the yoke of Assyria, and their kings were
apparently vassals of the Muski.

Tiglath-pileser first invaded Mitanni, where he routed a combined force
of Shubari hillmen and Hittites. Thereafter a great army of the Muski
and their allies pressed southward with purpose to deal a shattering
blow against the Assyrian power. The very existence of Assyria as a
separate power was threatened by this movement. Tiglath-pileser,
however, was equal to the occasion. He surprised the invaders among the
Kashiari mountains and inflicted a crushing defeat, slaying about 14,000
and capturing 6000 prisoners, who were transported to Asshur. In fact,
he wiped the invading army out of existence and possessed himself of all
its baggage. Thereafter he captured several cities, and extended his
empire beyond the Kashiari hills and into the heart of Mitanni.

His second campaign was also directed towards the Mitanni district,
which had been invaded during his absence by a force of Hittites, about
4000 strong. The invaders submitted to him as soon as he drew near, and
he added them to his standing army.

Subsequent operations towards the north restored the pre-eminence of
Assyria in the Nairi country, on the shores of Lake Van, in Armenia,
where Tiglath-pileser captured no fewer than twenty-three petty kings.
These he liberated after they had taken the oath of allegiance and
consented to pay annual tribute.

In his fourth year the conqueror learned that the Aramæans were crossing
the Euphrates and possessing

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

themselves of Mitanni, which he had cleared of the Hittites. By a series
of forced marches he caught them unawares, scattered them in confusion,
and entered Carchemish, which he pillaged. Thereafter his army crossed
the Euphrates in boats of skin, and plundered and destroyed six cities
round the base of the mountain of Bishru.

While operating in this district, Tiglath-pileser engaged in big-game
hunting. He recorded: "Ten powerful bull elephants in the land of Haran
and on the banks of the Khabour I killed; four elephants alive I took.
Their skins, their teeth, with the living elephants, I brought to my
city of Asshur." <span id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_418.md) He also claimed
to have slain 920 lions, as well as a number of wild oxen, apparently
including in his record the "bags" of his officers and men. A later king
credited him with having penetrated to the Phœnician coast, where he put
to sea and slew a sea monster called the "nakhiru". While at Arvad, the
narrative continues, the King of Egypt, who is not named, sent him a
hippopotamus (pagutu). This story, however, is of doubtful authenticity.
About this time the prestige of Egypt was at so low an ebb that its
messengers were subjected to indignities by the Phœnician kings.

The conquests of Tiglath-pileser once more raised the Mesopotamian
question in Babylonia, whose sphere of influence in that region had been
invaded. Marduk-nadin-akhe, the grandson of Nebuchadrezzar I, "arrayed
his chariots" against Tiglath-pileser, and in the first conflict
achieved some success, but subsequently he was defeated in the land of
Akkad. The Assyrian army afterwards captured several cities, including
Babylon and Sippar.

Thus once again the Assyrian Empire came into being

as the predominant world Power, extending from the land of the Hittites
into the heart of Babylonia. Its cities were enriched by the immense
quantities of booty captured by its warrior king, while the coffers of
state were glutted with the tribute of subject States. Fortifications
were renewed, temples were built, and great gifts were lavished on the
priesthood. Artists and artisans were kept fully employed restoring the
faded splendours of the Old Empire, and everywhere thousands of slaves
laboured to make the neglected land prosperous as of old. Canals were
repaired and reopened; the earthworks and quay wall of Ashur were
strengthened, and its great wall was entirely rebuilt, faced with a
rampart of earth, and protected once again by a deep moat. The royal
palace was enlarged and redecorated.

Meanwhile Babylonia was wasted by civil war and invasions. It was
entered more than once by the Aramæans, who pillaged several cities in
the north and the south. Then the throne was seized by Adad-aplu-iddina,
the grandson of "a nobody", who reigned for about ten years. He was
given recognition, however, by the Assyrian king, Ashur-bel-kala, son of
Tiglath-pileser I, who married his daughter, and apparently restored to
him Sippar and Babylon after receiving a handsome dowry. Ashur-bel-kala
died without issue, and was succeeded by his brother, Shamshi-Adad.

An obscure period followed. In Babylonia there were two weak dynasties
in less than half a century, and thereafter an Elamite Dynasty which
lasted about six years. An Eighth Dynasty ensued, and lasted between
fifty and sixty years. The records of its early kings are exceedingly
meagre and their order uncertain. During the reign of Nabu-mukin-apli,
who was perhaps the fourth monarch, the Aramæans constantly raided the
land and hovered

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

about Babylon. The names of two or three kings who succeeded
Nabu-mukin-apli are unknown.

A century and a half after Tiglath-pileser I conquered the north Syrian
possessions of the Hittites, the Old Assyrian Empire reached the close
of its second and last period. It had suffered gradual decline, under a
series of inert and luxury-loving kings, until it was unable to
withstand the gradual encroachment on every side of the restless hill
tribes, who were ever ready to revolt when the authority of Ashur was
not asserted at the point of the sword.

After 950 B.C. the Hittites of North Syria, having shaken off the last
semblance of Assyrian authority, revived their power, and enjoyed a full
century of independence and prosperity. In Cappadocia their kinsmen had
freed themselves at an earlier period from the yoke of the Muski, who
had suffered so severely at the hands of Tiglath-pileser I. The Hittite
buildings and rock sculptures of this period testify to the enduring
character of the ancient civilization of the "Hatti". Until the
hieroglyphics can be read, however, we must wait patiently for the
detailed story of the pre-Phrygian period, which was of great historical
importance, because the tide of cultural influence was then flowing at
its greatest volume from the old to the new world, where Greece was
emerging in virgin splendour out of the ruins of the ancient Mykenæan
and Cretan civilizations.

It is possible that the conquest of a considerable part of Palestine by
the Philistines was not unconnected with the revival of Hittite power in
the north. They may have moved southward as the allies of the Cilician
State which was rising into prominence. For a period they were the
overlords of the Hebrews, who had been displacing the older inhabitants
of the "Promised Land",

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

and appear to have been armed with weapons of iron. In fact, as is
indicated by a passage in the Book of Samuel, they had made a "corner"
in that metal and restricted its use among their vassals. "Now", the
Biblical narrative sets forth, "there was no smith found throughout all
the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them
swords and spears; but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines,
to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his
mattock". <span id="fr_421"></span>[1](#fn_419.md) "We are inclined", says
Professor Macalister, "to picture the West as a thing of yesterday, new
fangled with its inventions and its progressive civilization, and the
East as an embodiment of hoary and unchanging traditions. But when West
first met East on the shores of the Holy Land, it was the former which
represented the magnificent traditions of the past, and the latter which
looked forward to the future. The Philistines were of the remnant of the
dying glories of Crete; the Hebrews had no past to speak of, but were
entering on the heritage they regarded as theirs, by right of a recently
ratified divine covenant." <span id="fr_422"></span>[2](#fn_420.md)

Saul was the leader of a revolt against the Philistines in northern
Palestine, and became the ruler of the kingdom of Israel. Then David,
having liberated Judah from the yoke of the Philistines, succeeded Saul
as ruler of Israel, and selected Jerusalem as his capital. He also
conquered Edom and Moab, but was unsuccessful in his attempt to
subjugate Ammon. The Philistines were then confined to a restricted area
on the seacoast, where they fused with the Semites and ultimately
suffered loss of identity. Under the famous Solomon the united kingdom
of the Hebrews reached its highest splendour and importance among the
nations.

If the Philistines received the support of the Hittites,

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

the Hebrews were strengthened by an alliance with Egypt. For a period of
two and a half centuries no Egyptian army had crossed the Delta frontier
into Syria. The ancient land of the Pharaohs had been overshadowed
meantime by a cloud of anarchy, and piratical and robber bands settled
freely on its coast line. At length a Libyan general named Sheshonk
(Shishak) seized the throne from the Tanite Dynasty. He was the Pharaoh
with whom Solomon "made affinity", <span id="fr_423"></span>[1](#fn_421.md)
and from whom he received the city of Gezer, which an Egyptian army had
captured. <span id="fr_424"></span>[2](#fn_422.md) Solomon had previously
married a daughter of Sheshonk's.

Phoenicia was also flourishing. Freed from Egyptian, Hittite, and
Assyrian interference, Tyre and Sidon attained to a high degree of power
as independent city States. During the reigns of David and Solomon, Tyre
was the predominant Phœnician power. Its kings, Abibaal and his son
Hiram, had become "Kings of the Sidonians", and are believed to have
extended their sway over part of Cyprus. The relations between the
Hebrews and the Phœnicians were of a cordial character, indeed the two
powers became allies.

<span class="small">And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto
Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of
his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. And Solomon sent to
Hiram, saying, Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an
house unto the name of the Lord his God for the wars which were about
him on every side, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.
But now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there
is neither adversary nor evil occurrent. And, behold, I purpose to build
an house unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake unto David
my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room,
he shall build an house unto my name. Now therefore command</span>

thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall
be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants
according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is
not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.

And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he
rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath
given unto David a wise son over this great people.

And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which
thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber
of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. My servants shall bring them
down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats
unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be
discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish
my desire, in giving food for my household. So Hiram gave Solomon cedar
trees and fir trees according to all his desire.

And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his
household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram
year by year. And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and
there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league
together. <span id="fr_425"></span>[1](#fn_423.md)

Hiram also sent skilled workers to Jerusalem to assist in the work of
building the temple and Solomon's palace, including his famous namesake,
"a widow's son of the (Hebrew) tribe of Naphtali", who, like his father,
"a man of Tyre", had "understanding and cunning to work all works in
brass". <span id="fr_426"></span>[2](#fn_424.md)

Solomon must have cultivated good relations with the Chaldæans, for he
had a fleet of trading ships on the Persian Gulf which was manned by
Phœnician sailors. "Once in three years", the narrative runs, "came the
navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and
peacocks." <span id="fr_427"></span>[3](#fn_425.md) Apparently he traded
with India, the land of peacocks, during the Brahmanical period, when

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

the Sanskrit name "Samudra", which formerly signified the "collected
waters" of the broadening Indus, was applied to the Indian Ocean. <span
id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_426.md)

The Aramæans of the Third Semitic migration were not slow to take
advantage of the weakness of Assyria and Babylon. They overran the whole
of Syria, and entered into the possession of Mesopotamia, thus acquiring
full control of the trade routes towards the west. From time to time
they ravaged Babylonia from the north to the south. Large numbers of
them acquired permanent settlement in that country, like the Amorites of
the Second Semitic migration in the pre-Hammurabi Age.

In Syria the Aramæans established several petty States, and were
beginning to grow powerful at Damascus, an important trading centre,
which assumed considerable political importance after the collapse of
Assyria's Old Empire.

At this period, too, the Chaldæans came into prominence in Babylonia.
Their kingdom of Chaldæa (Kaldu, which signifies Sealand) embraces a
wide stretch of the coast land at the head of the Persian Gulf between
Arabia and Elam. As we have seen, an important dynasty flourished in
this region in the time of Hammurabi. Although more than one king of
Babylon recorded that he had extinguished the Sealand Power, it
continued to exist all through the Kassite period. It is possible that
this obscure kingdom embraced diverse ethnic elements, and that it was
controlled in turn by military aristocracies of Sumerians, Elamites,
Kassites, and Arabians. After the downfall of the Kassites it had become
thoroughly Semitized, perhaps as a result of the Aramæan migration,
which may have found one of its outlets around the head

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

of the Persian Gulf. The ancient Sumerian city of Ur, which dominated a
considerable area of steppe land to the west of the Euphrates, was
included in the Sealand kingdom, and was consequently referred to in
after-time as "Ur of the Chaldees".

When Solomon reigned over Judah and Israel, Babylonia was broken up into
a number of petty States, as in early Sumerian times. The feudal revival
of Nebuchadrezzar I had weakened the central power, with the result that
the nominal high kings were less able to resist the inroads of invaders.
Military aristocracies of Aramæans, Elamites, and Chaldæans held sway in
various parts of the valley, and struggled for supremacy.

When Assyria began to assert itself again, it laid claim on Babylonia,
ostensibly as the protector of its independence, and the Chaldæans for a
time made common cause with the Elamites against it. The future,
however, lay with the Chaldæans, who, like the Kassites, became the
liberators of the ancient inhabitants. When Assyria was finally
extinguished as a world power they revived the ancient glory of
Babylonia, and supplanted the Sumerians as the scholars and teachers of
Western Asia. The Chaldæans became famous in Syria, and even in Greece,
as "the wise men from the east", and were renowned as astrologers.

The prestige of the Hebrew kingdom suffered sharp and serious decline
after Solomon's death. Pharaoh Sheshonk fostered the elements of revolt
which ultimately separated Israel from Judah, and, when a favourable
opportunity arose, invaded Palestine and Syria and re-established
Egypt's suzerainty over part of the area which had been swayed by
Rameses II, replenishing his exhausted treasury with rich booty and the
tribute he imposed. Phoenicia was able, however, to maintain its

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

independence, but before the Assyrians moved westward again, Sidon had
shaken off the yoke of Tyre and become an independent State.

It will be seen from the events outlined in this chapter how greatly the
history of the ancient world was affected by the periodic migrations of
pastoral folks from the steppe lands. These human tides were
irresistible. The direction of their flow might be diverted for a time,
but they ultimately overcame every obstacle by sheer persistency and
overpowering volume. Great emperors in Assyria and Egypt endeavoured to
protect their countries from the "Bedouin peril" by strengthening their
frontiers and extending their spheres of influence, but the dammed-up
floods of humanity only gathered strength in the interval for the
struggle which might be postponed but could not be averted.

These migrations, as has been indicated, were due to natural causes.
They were propelled by climatic changes which caused a shortage of the
food supply, and by the rapid increase of population under peaceful
conditions. Once a migration began to flow, it set in motion many
currents and cross currents, but all these converged towards the
districts which offered the most attractions to mankind. Prosperous and
well-governed States were ever in peril of invasion by barbarous
peoples. The fruits of civilization tempted them; the reward of conquest
was quickly obtained in Babylon and Egypt with their flourishing farms
and prosperous cities. Waste land was reclaimed then as now by colonists
from centres of civilization; the migrating pastoral folks lacked the
initiative and experience necessary to establish new communities in
undeveloped districts. Highly civilized men sowed the harvest and the
barbarians reaped it.

It must not be concluded, however, that the migrations

were historical disasters, or that they retarded the general advancement
of the human race. In time the barbarians became civilized and fused
with the peoples whom they conquered. They introduced, too, into
communities which had grown stagnant and weakly, a fresh and
invigorating atmosphere that acted as a stimulant in every sphere of
human activity. The Kassite, for instance, was a unifying and therefore
a strengthening influence in Babylonia. He shook off the manacles of the
past which bound the Sumerian and the Akkadian alike to traditional
lines of policy based on unforgotten ancient rivalries. His concern was
chiefly with the future. The nomads with their experience of desert
wandering promoted trade, and the revival of trade inaugurated new eras
of prosperity in ancient centres of culture, and brought them into
closer touch than ever before with one another. The rise of Greece was
due to the blending of the Achæans and other pastoral fighting folks
with the indigenous Pelasgians. Into the early States which fostered the
elements of ancient Mykenæan civilization, poured the cultural
influences of the East through Asia Minor and Phoenicia and from the
Egyptian coast. The conquerors from the steppes meanwhile contributed
their genius for organization, their simple and frugal habits of life,
and their sterling virtues; they left a deep impress on the moral,
physical, and intellectual life of Greece.
