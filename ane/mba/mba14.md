ONE of the oldest forms of folk stories relates to the wanderings of a
hero in distant regions. He may set forth in search of a fair lady who
has been taken captive, or to obtain a magic herb or stone to relieve a
sufferer, to cure diseases, and to prolong life. Invariably he is a
slayer of dragons and other monsters. A friendly spirit, or a group of
spirits, may assist the hero, who acts according to the advice given him
by a "wise woman", a magician, or a god. The spirits are usually wild
beasts or birds--the "fates" of immemorial folk belief--and they may
either carry the hero on their backs, instruct him from time to time, or
come to his aid when called upon.

When a great national hero appealed by reason of his achievements to the
imagination of a people, all the

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

floating legends of antiquity were attached to his memory, and he became
identified with gods and giants and knight-errants "old in story". In
Scotland, for instance, the boulder-throwing giant of Eildon hills bears
the name of Wallace, the Edinburgh giant of Arthur's Seat is called
after an ancient Celtic king, <span id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_189.md) and
Thomas the Rhymer takes the place, in an Inverness fairy mound called
Tom-na-hurich, of Finn (Fingal) as chief of the "Seven Sleepers".
Similarly Napoleon sleeps in France and Skobeleff in Russia, as do also
other heroes elsewhere. In Germany the myths of Thunor (Thor) were
mingled with hazy traditions of Theodoric the Goth (Dietrich), while in
Greece, Egypt, and Arabia, Alexander the Great absorbed a mass of
legendary matter of great antiquity, and displaced in the memories of
the people the heroes of other Ages, as those heroes had previously
displaced the humanized spirits of fertility and growth who alternately
battled fiercely against the demons of spring, made love, gorged and
drank deep and went to sleep--the sleep of winter. Certain folk tales,
and the folk beliefs on which they were based, seem to have been of
hoary antiquity before the close of the Late Stone Age.

There are two great heroes of Babylonian fame who link with Perseus and
Hercules, Sigurd and Siegfried, Dietrich and Finn-mac-Coul. These are
Etana and Gilgamesh, two legendary kings who resemble Tammuz the
Patriarch referred to by Berosus, a form of Tammuz the Sleeper of the
Sumerian psalms. One journeys to the Nether World to obtain the Plant of
Birth and the other to obtain the Plant of Life. The floating legends
with which they were associated were utilized

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

and developed by the priests, when engaged in the process of
systematizing and symbolizing religious beliefs, with purpose to unfold
the secrets of creation and the Otherworld.

Etana secures the assistance of a giant eagle who is an enemy of
serpents like the Indian Garuda, half giant, half eagle. As Vishnu, the
Indian god, rides on the back of Garuda, so does Etana ride on the back
of the Babylonian Eagle. In one fragmentary legend which was preserved
in the tablet-library of Ashur-banipal, the Assyrian monarch, Etana
obtained the assistance of the Eagle to go in quest of the Plant of
Birth. His wife was about to become a mother, and was accordingly in
need of magical aid. A similar belief caused birth girdles of straw or
serpent skins, and eagle stones found in eagles' nests, to be used in
ancient Britain and elsewhere throughout Europe apparently from the
earliest times. <span id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_190.md)

On this or another occasion Etana desired to ascend to highest heaven.
He asked the Eagle to assist him, and the bird assented, saying: "Be
glad, my friend. Let me bear thee to the highest heaven. Lay thy breast
on mine and thine arms on my wings, and let my body be as thy body."
Etana did as the great bird requested him, and together they ascended
towards the firmament. After a flight which extended over two hours, the
Eagle asked Etana to gaze downwards. He did so, and beheld the ocean
surrounding the earth, and the earth seemed like a mountainous island.
The Eagle resumed its flight, and when another two hours had elapsed, it
again asked Etana to look downwards. Then the hero saw that the sea
resembled a girdle which clasped the land. Two hours later Etana found
that he had been raised to a height

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

from which the sea appeared to be no larger than a pond. By this time he
had reached the heaven of Anu, Bel, and Ea, and found there rest and
shelter.

Here the text becomes fragmentary. Further on it is gathered from the
narrative that Etana is being carried still higher by the Eagle towards
the heaven of Ishtar, "Queen of Heaven", the supreme mother goddess.
Three times, at intervals of two hours, the Eagle asks Etana to look
downwards towards the shrinking earth. Then some disaster happens, for
further onwards the broken tablet narrates that the Eagle is falling.
Down and down eagle and man fall together until they strike the earth,
and the Eagle's body is shattered.

The Indian Garuda eagle <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_191.md) never met
with such a fate, but on one occasion Vishnu overpowered it with his
right arm, which was heavier than the whole universe, and caused many
feathers to fall off. In the story of Rama's wanderings, however, as
told in the *Ràmyàna* and the *Mahàbhàrata*, there are interesting
references in this connection to Garuda's two "sons". One was mortally
wounded by Ravana, the demon king of Ceylon. The other bird related to
Rama, who found it disabled: "Once upon a time we two (brothers), with
the desire of out-stripping each other, flew towards the sun. My wings
were burnt, but those of my brother were not. . . . I fell down on the
top of this great mountain, where I still am." <span
id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_192.md)

Another version of the Etana story survives among the Arabian Moslems.
In the "Al Fatihat" chapter of the Koran it is related that a Babylonian
king held a dispute with Abraham "concerning his Lord". Commentators

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

identify the monarch with Nimrod, who afterwards caused the Hebrew
patriarch to be cast into a fire from which he had miraculous
deliverance. Nimrod then built a tower so as to ascend to heaven "to see
Abraham's god", and make war against Him, but the tower was overthrown.
He, however, persisted in his design. The narrative states that he was
"carried to heaven in a chest borne by four monstrous birds; but after
wandering for some time through the air, he fell down on a mountain with
such a force that he made it shake". A reference in the Koran to
"contrivances . . . which make mountains tremble" is believed to allude
to Nimrod's vain attempt. <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_193.md)

Alexander the Great was also reputed to have ascended on the back of an
eagle. Among the myths attached to his memory in the Ethiopic "history"
is one which explains how "he knew and comprehended the length and
breadth of the earth", and how he obtained knowledge regarding the seas
and mountains he would have to cross. "He made himself small and flew
through the air on an eagle, and he arrived in the heights of the
heavens and he explored them." Another Alexandrian version of the Etana
myth resembles the Arabic legend of Nimrod. "In the Country of Darkness"
Alexander fed and tamed great birds which were larger than eagles. Then
he ordered four of his soldiers to mount them. The men were carried to
the "Country of the Living", and when they returned they told Alexander
"all that had happened and all that they had seen". <span
id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_194.md)

In a Gaelic story a hero is carried off by a Cromhineach, "a vast bird
like an eagle". He tells that it "sprang to the clouds with me, and I
was a while that I

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

did not know which was heaven or earth for me". The hero died, but,
curiously enough, remained conscious of what was happening. Apparently
exhausted, the eagle flew to an island in the midst of the ocean. It
laid the hero on the sunny side. The hero proceeds: "Sleep came upon
herself (the eagle) and she slept. The sun was enlivening me pretty well
though I was dead." Afterwards the eagle bathed in a healing well, and
as it splashed in the water, drops fell on the hero and he came to life.
"I grew stronger and more active", he adds, "than I had ever been
before." <span id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_195.md)

The eagle figures in various mythologies, and appears to have been at
one time worshipped as the god or goddess of fertility, and storm and
lightning, as the bringer of children, and the deity who carried souls
to Hades. It was also the symbol of royalty, because the earthly ruler
represented the controlling deity. Nin-Girsu, the god of Lagash, who was
identified with Tammuz, was depicted as a lion-headed eagle. Zeus, the
Greek sky and air god, was attended by an eagle, and may, at one time,
have been simply an eagle. In Egypt the place of the eagle is taken by
Nekhebit, the vulture goddess whom the Greeks identified with
"Eileithyia, the goddess of birth; she was usually represented as a
vulture hovering over the king". <span id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_196.md)

The double-headed eagle of the Hittites, which figures in the royal arms
of Germany and Russia, appears to have symbolized the deity of whom the
king was an incarnation or son. In Indian mythology Garuda, the eagle
giant, which destroyed serpents like the Babylonian Etana eagle, issued
from its egg like a flame of fire; its eyes flashed the lightning and
its voice was the thunder. This bird is identified in a hymn with Agni,
god of fire, who

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

has the attributes of Tammuz and Mithra, with Brahma, the creator, with
Indra, god of thunder and fertility, and with Yama, god of the dead, who
carries off souls to Hades. It is also called "the steed-necked
incarnation of Vishnu", the "Preserver" of the Hindu trinity who rode on
its back. The hymn referred to lauds Garuda as "the bird of life, the
presiding spirit of the animate and inanimate universe . . . destroyer
of all, creator of all". It burns all "as the sun in his anger burneth
all creatures". <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_197.md)

Birds were not only fates, from whose movements in flight omens were
drawn, but also spirits of fertility. When the childless Indian sage
Mandapala of the *Mahàbhàrata* was refused admittance to heaven until a
son was born to him, he "pondered deeply" and "came to know that of all
creatures birds alone were blest with fecundity"; so he became a bird.

It is of interest, therefore, to find the Etana eagle figuring as a
symbol of royalty at Rome. The deified Roman Emperor's waxen image was
burned on a pyre after his death, and an eagle was let loose from the
great pile to carry his soul to heaven. <span
id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_198.md) This custom was probably a relic of
seasonal fire worship, which may have been introduced into Northern and
Western Syria and Asia Minor by the mysterious Mitanni rulers, if it was
not an archaic Babylonian custom <span id="fr_200"></span>[3](#fn_199.md)
associated with fire-and-water magical ceremonies, represented in the
British Isles by May-Day and Midsummer fire-and-water festivals. Sandan,
the mythical founder of Tarsus, was honoured

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

each year at that city by burning a great bonfire, and he was identified
with Hercules. Probably he was a form of Moloch and Melkarth. <span
id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_200.md) Doves were burned to Adonis. The burning
of straw figures, representing gods of fertility, on May-Day bonfires
may have been a fertility rite, and perhaps explains the use of straw
birth-girdles.

According to the commentators of the Koran, Nimrod, the Babylonian king,
who cast victims in his annual bon-fires at Cuthah, died on the eighth
day of the Tammuz month, which, according to the Syrian calendar, fell
on 13th July. <span id="fr_202"></span>[2](#fn_201.md) It is related that
gnats entered Nimrod's brain, causing the membrane to grow larger. He
suffered great pain, and to relieve it had his head beaten with a
mallet. Although he lived for several hundred years, like other
agricultural patriarchs, including the Tammuz of Berosus, it is possible
that he was ultimately sacrificed and burned. The beating of Nimrod
recalls the beating of the corn spirit of the agricultural legend
utilized by Burns in his ballad of "John Barleycorn", which gives a
jocular account of widespread ancient customs that are not yet quite
extinct even in Scotland: <span id="fr_203"></span>[3](#fn_202.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

They laid him down upon his back  
  And cudgelled him full sore;  
They hung him up before a storm  
  And turned him o'er and o'er.

They fillèd up a darksome pit  
  With water to the brim,  
They heavèd in John Barleycorn--  
  There let him sink or swim. <span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

They wasted o’er a scorching flame  
  The marrow of his bones,  
But the miller used him worst of all,  
  For he crushed him between two stones.

</div>

Hercules, after performing many mythical exploits, had himself burned
alive on the pyre which he built upon Mount Œta, and was borne to
Olympus amidst peals of thunder.

Gilgamesh, the Babylonian Hercules, who links with Etana, Nimrod, and
Sandan, is associated with the eagle, which in India, as has been shown,
was identified with the gods of fertility, fire, and death. According to
a legend related by Ælian, <span id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_203.md) "the
guards of the citadel of Babylon threw down to the ground a child who
had been conceived and brought forth in secret, and who afterwards
became known as Gilgamos". This appears to be another version of the
Sargon-Tammuz myth, and may also refer to the sacrifice of children to
Melkarth and Moloch, who were burned or slain "in the valleys under the
clifts of the rocks" <span id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_204.md) to ensure
fertility and feed the corn god. Gilgamesh, however, did not perish. "A
keen-eyed eagle saw the child falling, and before it touched the ground
the bird flew under it and received it on its back, and carried it away
to a garden and laid it down gently." Here we have, it would appear,
Tammuz among the flowers, and Sargon, the gardener, in the "Garden of
Adonis". Mimic Adonis gardens were cultivated by women. Corn, &c., was
forced in pots and baskets, and thrown, with an image of the god, into
streams. "Ignorant people", writes Professor Frazer, "suppose that by
mimicking the effect which they desire to produce they actually help to
produce it: thus by sprinkling water they

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

make rain, by lighting a fire they make sunshine, and so on." <span
id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_205.md) Evidently Gilgamesh was a heroic form of
the god Tammuz, the slayer of the demons of winter and storm, who passed
one part of the year in the world and another in Hades ([Chapter
VI](mba12.htm#an_ch-06).md).

Like Hercules, Gilgamesh figured chiefly in legendary narrative as a
mighty hero. He was apparently of great antiquity, so that it is
impossible to identify him with any forerunner of Sargon of Akkad, or
Alexander the Great. His exploits were depicted on cylinder seals of the
Sumerian period, and he is shown wrestling with a lion as Hercules
wrestled with the monstrous lion in the valley of Nemea. The story of
his adventures was narrated on twelve clay tablets, which were preserved
in the library of Ashur-banipal, the Assyrian emperor. In the first
tablet, which is badly mutilated, Gilgamesh is referred to as the man
who beheld the world, and had great wisdom because he peered into the
mysteries. He travelled to distant places, and was informed regarding
the flood and the primitive race which the gods destroyed; he also
obtained the plant of life, which his enemy, the earth-lion, in the form
of a serpent or well demon, afterwards carried away.

Gilgamesh was associated with Erech, where he reigned as "the lord".
There Ishtar had a great temple, but her worldly wealth had decreased.
The fortifications of the city were crumbling, and for three years the
Elamites besieged it. The gods had turned to flies and the winged bulls
had become like mice. Men wailed like wild beasts and maidens moaned
like doves. Ultimately the people prayed to the goddess Aruru to create
a liberator. Bel, Shamash, and Ishtar also came to their aid.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

Aruru heard the cries of her worshippers. She dipped her hands in water
and then formed a warrior with clay. He was named Ea-bani, which
signifies "Ea is my creator". It is possible, therefore, that an ancient
myth of Eridu forms the basis of the narrative.

Ea-bani is depicted on the cylinder seals as a hairy man-monster
resembling the god Pan. He ate grass with the gazelles and drank water
with wild beasts, and he is compared to the corn god, which suggests
that he was an early form of Tammuz, and of character somewhat
resembling the Egyptian Bast, the half-bestial god of fertility. A
hunter was sent out from Erech to search for the man-monster, and found
him beside a stream in a savage place drinking with his associates, the
wild animals. The description of Ea-bani recalls that of Nebuchadnezzar
when he was stricken with madness.

He was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet
with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers,
and his nails like birds' claws." <span id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_206.md)

The hunter had no desire to combat with Ea-bani, so he had him lured
from the wilds by a beautiful woman. Love broke the spell which kept
Ea-bani in his savage state, and the wild beasts fled from him. Then the
temptress pleaded with him to go with her to Erech, where Anu and Ishtar
had their temples, and the mighty Gilgamesh lived in his palace.
Ea-bani, deserted by his bestial companions, felt lonely and desired
human friend-ship. So he consented to accompany his bride. Having heard
of Gilgamesh from the hunter, he proposed to test his strength in single
combat, but Shamash, god of the sun, warned Ea-bani that he was the
protector of Gilgamesh,

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

who had been endowed with great knowledge by Bel and Anu and Ea.
Gilgamesh was also counselled in a vision of night to receive Ea-bani as
an ally.

Ea-bani was not attracted by city life and desired to return to the
wilds, but Shamash prevailed upon him to remain as the friend of
Gilgamesh, promising that he would be greatly honoured and exalted to
high rank.

The two heroes became close friends, and when the narrative becomes
clear again, they are found to be setting forth to wage war against
Chumbaba, <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_207.md) the King of Elam. Their
journey was long and perilous. In time they entered a thick forest, and
wondered greatly at the numerous and lofty cedars. They saw the great
road which the king had caused to be made, the high mountain, and the
temple of the god. Beautiful were the trees about the mountain, and
there were many shady retreats that were fragrant and alluring.

At this point the narrative breaks off; for the tablet is mutilated.
When it is resumed a reference is made to "the head of Chumbaba", who
has apparently been slain by the heroes. Erech was thus freed from the
oppression of its fierce enemy.

Gilgamesh and Ea-bani appear to have become prosperous and happy. But in
the hour of triumph a shadow falls. Gilgamesh is robed in royal
splendour and wears his dazzling crown. He is admired by all men, but
suddenly it becomes known that the goddess Ishtar has been stricken with
love for him. She "loved him with that love which was his doom". Those
who are loved by celestials or demons become, in folk tales, melancholy
wanderers and "night wailers". The "wretched wight" in Keats' "La Belle
Dame Sans Merci" is a typical example.

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,  
  Alone and palely loitering?  
The sedge is withered from the lake  
  And no birds sing.

I met a lady in the meads,  
  Full beautiful--a faery's child;  
Her hair was long, her foot was light,  
  And her eyes were wild.

  .     .     .     .     .

She found me roots of relish sweet,  
  And honey wild and manna dew;  
And sure in language strange she said,  
  "I love thee true".

</div>

Having kissed her lover to sleep, the fairy woman vanished. The "knight"
then saw in a dream the ghosts of knights and warriors, her previous
victims, who warned him of his fate.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I saw their starved lips in the gloam,  
  With horrid warning gapèd wide;  
And I awoke and found me here  
  On the cold hill's side.</span>

</div>

The goddess Ishtar appeared as "La Belle Dame Sans Merci" before
Gilgamesh and addressed him tenderly, saying: "Come, O Gilgamesh, and be
my consort. Gift thy strength unto me. Be thou my husband and I will be
thy bride. Thou shalt have a chariot of gold and lapis lazuli with
golden wheels and gem-adorned. Thy steeds shall be fair and white and
powerful. Into my dwelling thou shalt come amidst the fragrant cedars.
Every king and every prince will bow down before thee, O Gilgamesh, to
kiss thy feet, and all people will become subject unto thee."

Gilgamesh feared the fate which would attend him as

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

the lover of Ishtar, and made answer saying: "To what husband hast thou
ever remained faithful? Each year Tammuz, the lover of thy youth, is
caused by thee to weep. Thou didst love the Allala bird and then broke
his wings, and he moans in the woods crying, 'O my wings!' Thou didst
love the lion and then snared him. Thou didst love the horse, and then
laid harness on him and made him gallop half a hundred miles so that he
suffered great distress, and thou didst oppress his mother Silili. Thou
didst love a shepherd who sacrificed kids unto thee, and then thou didst
smite him so that he became a jackal (or leopard); his own herd boy
drove him away and his dogs rent him in pieces. Thou didst love
Ishullanu, the gardener of Anu, who made offerings unto thee, and then
smote him so that he was unable to move. Alas! if thou wouldst love me,
my fate would be like unto the fates of those on whom thou hast laid
affliction."

Ishtar's heart was filled with wrath when she heard the words which
Gilgamesh had spoken, and she prevailed upon her father Anu to create a
fierce bull which she sent against the lord of Erech.

This monster, however, was slain by Gilgamesh <span
id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_208.md) and Ea-bani, but their triumph was
shortlived. Ishtar cursed Gilgamesh. Ea-bani then defied her and
threatened to deal with her as he had dealt with the bull, with the
result that he was cursed by the goddess also.

Gilgamesh dedicated the horns of the bull to Shamash and returned with
his friend to Erech, where they were received with great rejoicings. A
festival was held, and afterwards the heroes lay down to sleep. Then
Ea-bani dreamt a dream of ill omen. He met his death soon afterwards,
apparently in a battle, and Gilgamesh lamented

THE SLAYING OF THE BULL OF ISHTAR  
*From the Painting by E. Wallcousins*.  
</span>

 

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

over him. From the surviving fragments of the narrative it would appear
that Gilgamesh resolved to undertake a journey, for he had been stricken
by disease. He wept and cried out, "Oh! let me not die like Ea-bani, for
death is fearful. I will seek the aid of mine ancestor,
Pir-napishtim"--the Babylonian Noah, who was believed to be dwelling on
an island which corresponds to the Greek "Island of the Blessed". The
Babylonian island lay in the ocean of the Nether World.

It seems that Gilgamesh not only hoped to obtain the Water of Life and
the Plant of Life to cure his own disease, but also to restore to life
his dead friend, Ea-bani, whom he loved.

Gilgamesh set out on his journey and in time reached a mountain chasm.
Gazing on the rugged heights, he beheld fierce lions and his heart
trembled. Then he cried upon the moon god, who took pity upon him, and
under divine protection the hero pressed onward. He crossed the rocky
range and then found himself confronted by the tremendous mountain of
Mashi--"Sunset hill", which divided the land of the living from the
western land of the dead. The mountain peak rose to heaven, and its
foundations were in Aralu, the Underworld. <span
id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_209.md) A dark tunnel pierced it and could be
entered through a door, but the door was shut and on either side were
two monsters of horrible aspect--the gigantic "scorpion man" and his
wife, whose heads reached to the clouds. When Gilgamesh beheld them he
swooned with terror. But they did him no harm, perceiving that he was a
son of a god and had a body like a god.

When Gilgamesh revived, he realized that the monsters

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

regarded him with eyes of sympathy. Addressing the scorpion giant, he
told that he desired to visit his ancestor, Pir-napishtim, who sat in
the council of the gods and had divine attributes. The giant warned him
of the dangers which he would encounter, saying that the mountain
passage was twelve miles long and beamless and black. Gilgamesh,
however, resolved to encounter any peril, for he was no longer afraid,
and he was allowed to go forward. So he entered through the
monster-guarded mountain door and plunged into thick unbroken darkness.
For twice twelve hours he groped blindly onward, until he saw a ray of
light. Quickening his steps, he then escaped from the dreadful tunnel
and once more rejoiced in the rays of the sun. He found himself in an
enchanted garden, and in the midst of it he saw a divine and beautiful
tree towards which he hastened. On its gleaming branches hung clusters
of precious stones and its leaves were of lapis lazuli. His eyes were
dazzled, but he did not linger there. Passing many other wonderful
trees, he came to a shoreland, and he knew that he was drawing nigh to
the Sea of Death. The country which he entered was ruled over by the sea
lady whose name was Sabitu. When she saw the pilgrim drawing nigh, she
entered her palace and shut the door.

Gilgamesh called out requesting that he should be allowed to enter, and
mingled his entreaties with threats to break open the door. In the end
Sabitu appeared and spoke, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gilgamesh, whither hurriest thou?  
The life that thou seekest thou wilt not find.  
When the gods created man  
They fixed death for mankind.  
Life they took in their own hand.  
Thou, O Gilgamesh, let thy belly be filled! <span id="page_179">p.
179</span>  
Day and night be merry,  
Daily celebrate a feast,  
Day and night dance and make merry!  
Clean be thy clothes,  
Thy head be washed, bathe in water!  
Look joyfully on the child that grasps thy hand,  
Be happy with the wife in thine arms! <span
id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_210.md)</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This is the
philosophy of the Egyptian "Lay of the Harper". The following quotations
are from two separate versions:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

How rests this just prince!  
The goodly destiny befalls,  
The bodies pass away

(Make) it pleasant for thee to follow thy desire

Put myrrh upon thy head,

Jastrow contrasts the Babylonian poem with the following quotation from
Ecclesiastes:--

<span class="small">Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy
wine with a merry heart. . . . Let thy garments be always white;
and</span>

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

<span class="small">let thy head lack no ointment. Live joyfully with
the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which
he \[God\] hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity:
for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou
takest under the sun. <span id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_212.md)</span>

"The pious Hebrew mind", Jastrow adds, "found the corrective to this
view of life in the conception of a stern but just God, acting according
to self-imposed standards of right and wrong, whose rule extends beyond
the grave." The final words of the Preacher are, "Fear God and keep his
commandments". <span id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_213.md)

Gilgamesh did not accept the counsel of the fatalistic sea lady. He
asked her how he could reach Pir-napishtim, his ancestor, saying he was
prepared to cross the Sea of Death: if he could not cross it he would
die of grief.

Sabitu answered him, saying: "O Gilgamesh, no mortal is ferried over
this great sea. Who can pass over it save Shamash alone? The way is full
of peril. O Gilgamesh, how canst thou battle against the billows of
death?"

At length, however, the sea lady revealed to the pilgrim that he might
obtain the aid of the sailor, Arad Ea, who served his ancestor
Pir-napishtim.

Gilgamesh soon found where Arad Ea dwelt, and after a time prevailed
upon him to act as ferryman. Arad Ea required a helm for his boat, and
Gilgamesh hastened to fashion one from a tree. When it was fixed on, the
boat was launched and the voyage began. Terrible experiences were passed
through as they crossed the Sea of Death, but at length they drew nigh
to the "Island of the Blessed" on which dwelt Pir-napishtim and his
wife. Wearied by his exertions and wasted by disease, Gilgamesh sat
resting in the boat. He did not go ashore.

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

Pir-napishtim had perceived the vessel crossing the Sea of Death and
marvelled greatly.

The story is unfortunately interrupted again, but it appears that
Gilgamesh poured into the ears of his ancestor the tale of his
sufferings, adding that he feared death and desired to escape his fate.

Pir-napishtim made answer, reminding the pilgrim that all men must die.
Men built houses, sealed contracts, disputed one with another, and sowed
seeds in the earth, but as long as they did so and the rivers rose in
flood, so long would their fate endure. Nor could any man tell when his
hour would come. The god of destiny measured out the span of life: he
fixed the day of death, but never revealed his secrets.

Gilgamesh then asked Pir-napishtim how it chanced that he was still
alive. "Thou hast suffered no change," he said, "thou art even as I am.
Harden not thy heart against me, but reveal how thou hast obtained
divine life in the company of the gods."

Pir-napishtim thereupon related to his descendant the story of the
deluge, which is dealt with fully in the next chapter. The gods had
resolved to destroy the world, and Ea in a dream revealed unto
Pir-napishtim how he could escape. He built a ship which was tossed
about on the waters, and when the world had been destroyed, Bel
discovered him and transported him to that island in the midst of the
Sea of Death.

Gilgamesh sat in the boat listening to the words of his ancestor. When
the narrative was ended, Pir-napishtim spoke sympathetically and said:
"Who among the gods will restore thee to health, O Gilgamesh? Thou hast
knowledge of my life, and thou shalt be given the life thou dost strive
after. Take heed, therefore, to what I say unto thee. For six days and
seven nights thou

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

shalt not lie down, but remain sitting like one in the midst of
grief." <span id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_214.md)

Gilgamesh sat in the ship, and sleep enveloped him like to a black storm
cloud.

Pir-napishtim spoke to his wife and said: "Behold the hero who desireth
to have life. Sleep envelops him like to a black storm cloud."

To that lone man his wife made answer: "Lay thine hand upon him so that
he may have perfect health and be enabled to return to his own land.
Give him power to pass through the mighty door by which he entered."

Then Pir-napishtim addressed his wife, saying: "His sufferings make me
sad. Prepare thou for him the magic food, and place it near his head."

On the day when Gilgamesh lay down, the food was prepared by seven magic
processes, and the woman ad-ministered it while yet he slept. Then
Pir-napishtim touched him, and he awoke full of life.

Gilgamesh spake unto Pir-napishtim and said: "I was suddenly overcome by
sleep. . . . But thou didst awaken me by touching me, even thou. . . .
Lo! I am bewitched. What hast thou done unto thy servant?"

Then Pir-napishtim told Gilgamesh that he had been given to eat of the
magic food. Afterwards he caused Arad Ea to carry Gilgamesh to a
fountain of healing, where his disease-stricken body was cleansed. The
blemished skin fell from him, and he was made whole.

Thereafter Gilgamesh prepared to return to his own land. Ere he bade
farewell, however, Pir-napishtim revealed unto him the secret of a magic
plant which had power to renew life and give youth and strength unto
those who were old.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

Arad Ea conducted the hero to the island where the plant grew, and when
Gilgamesh found it he rejoiced, and said that he would carry it to
Erech, his own city, where he would partake of it and restore his youth.

So Gilgamesh and Arad Ea went on their way together, nor paused until
they came to a well of pure water. The hero stooped down to draw
water. <span id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_215.md) But while he was thus
engaged that demon, the Earth Lion, crept forth as a serpent, and,
seizing the magic plant of life, carried it away. Stricken with terror,
Gilgamesh uttered a curse. Then he sat down and wept bitterly, and the
tears streamed over his face. To Arad Ea he spake, saying: "Why has my
health been restored to me? Why should I rejoice because that I live?
The benefit which I should have derived for myself has now fallen to the
Earth Lion."

The two travellers then resumed their journey, performing religious acts
from time to time; chanting dirges and holding feasts for the dead, and
at length Gilgamesh returned to Erech. He found that the city walls were
crumbling, and he spake regarding the ceremonies which had been
performed while yet he was in a far-distant country.

During the days which followed Gilgamesh sorrowed for his lost friend
Ea-bani, whose spirit was in the Underworld, the captive of the spirits
of death. "Thou canst not draw thy bow now," he cried, "nor raise the
battle shout. Thou canst not kiss the woman thou hast loved; thou canst
not kiss the child thou hast loved, nor canst thou smite those whom thou
hast hated."

In vain Gilgamesh appealed to his mother goddess to restore Ea-bani to
him. Then he turned to the gods, and

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ea heard him.
Thereafter Nergal, god of death, caused the grave to yawn, and the
spirit of Ea-bani arose like a wind gust.

Gilgamesh, still dreading death, spoke to the ghost of his friend,
saying: "Tell me, my friend, O tell me regarding the land in which thou
dost dwell."

Ea-bani made answer sorrowfully: "Alas! I cannot tell thee, my friend.
If I were to tell thee all, thou wouldst sit down and weep."

Said Gilgamesh: "Let me sit down and weep, but tell me regarding the
land of spirits."

The text is mutilated here, but it can be gathered that Ea-bani
described the land where ill-doers were punished, where the young were
like the old, where the worm devoured, and dust covered all. But the
state of the warrior who had been given burial was better than that of
the man who had not been buried, and had no one to lament or care for
him. "He who hath been slain in battle," the ghost said, "reposeth on a
couch drinking pure water--one slain in battle as thou hast seen and I
have seen. His head is supported by his parents: beside him sits his
wife. His spirit doth not haunt the earth. But the spirit of that man
whose corpse has been left unburied and uncared for, rests not, but
prowls through the streets eating scraps of food, the leavings of the
feast, and drinking the dregs of vessels."

So ends the story of Gilgamesh in the form which survives to us.

The journey of Gilgamesh to the Island of the Blessed recalls the
journeys made by Odin, Hermod, Svipdag, Hotherus and others to the
Germanic Hela. When Hermod went to search for Balder, as the Prose Edda
relates, he rode through thick darkness for nine days and nine nights
ere he crossed the mountains. As Gilgamesh

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

met Sabitu, Hermod met Modgudur, "the maiden who kept the bridge "over
the river Gjöll. Svipdag, according to a Norse poem, was guided like the
Babylonian hero by the moon god, Gevar, who instructed him what way he
should take to find the irresistible sword. Saxo's Hother, who is
instructed by "King Gewar", crosses dismal mountains "beset with
extraordinary cold". <span id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_216.md) Thorkill
crosses a stormy ocean to the region of perpetual darkness, where the
ghosts of the dead are confined in loathsome and dusty caves. At the
main entrance "the door posts were begrimed with the soot of
ages". <span id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_217.md) In the Elder Edda Svipdag
is charmed against the perils he will be confronted by as he fares "o’er
seas mightier than men do know", or is overtaken by night "wandering on
the misty way". <span id="fr_219"></span>[3](#fn_218.md) When Odin
"downward rode into Misty Hel" he sang spells at a "witch's grave", and
the ghost rose up to answer his questions regarding Balder. "Tell me
tidings of Hel", he addressed her, as Gilgamesh addressed the ghost of
Ea-bani.

In the mythical histories of Alexander the Great, the hero searches for
the Water of Life, and is confronted by a great mountain called Musas
(Mashti). A demon stops him and says: "O king, thou art not able to
march through this mountain, for in it dwelleth a mighty god who is like
unto a monster serpent, and he preventeth everyone who would go unto
him." In another part of the narrative Alexander and his army arrive at
a place of darkness "where the blackness is not like the darkness of
night, but is like unto the mists and clouds which descend at the break
of day". A servant uses a shining jewel stone, which Adam had brought
from Paradise, to guide him, and found the well. He drank

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

of the "waters of life" and bathed in them, with the result that he was
strengthened and felt neither hunger nor thirst. When he came out of the
well "all the flesh of his body became bluish-green and his garments
likewise bluish-green". Apparently he assumed the colour of supernatural
beings. Rama of India was blue, and certain of his monkey allies were
green, like the fairies of England and Scotland. This fortunate man kept
his secret. His name was Matun, but he was afterwards nicknamed
"'El-Khidr', that is to say, 'Green'". What explanation he offered for
his sudden change of appearance has not been recorded. <span
id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_219.md) It is related that when Matun reached
the Well of Life a dried fish which he dipped in the water was restored
to life and swam away. In the Koran a similar story is told regarding
Moses and Joshua, who travelled "for a long space of time" to a place
where two seas met. "They forgot their fish which they had taken with
them, and the fish took its way freely to the sea." The Arabian
commentators explain that Moses once agreed to the suggestion that he
was the wisest of men. In a dream he was directed to visit Al Khedr, who
was "more knowing than he", and to take a fish with him in a basket. On
the seashore Moses fell asleep, and the fish, which had been roasted,
leapt out of the basket into the sea. Another version sets forth that
Joshua, "making the ablution at the fountain of life", some of the water
happened to be sprinkled on the fish, which immediately leapt up. <span
id="fr_221"></span>[2](#fn_220.md)

The Well of Life is found in Fingalian legends. When Diarmid was
mortally wounded by the boar, he called upon Finn to carry water to him
from the well:

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Give me a draught from thy palms, O Finn,  
Son of my king for my succour,  
For my life and my dwelling.  
         *Campbell's West Highland Tales*, vol. iii, 80.</span>

</div>

The quest of the plant, flower, or fruit of life is referred to in many
folk tales. In the *Mahàbhàrata*, Bhima, the Indian Gilgamesh or
Hercules, journeys to north-eastern Celestial regions to find the lake
of the god Kuvera (Kubera), on which grow the "most beautiful and
unearthly lotuses", which restore health and give strength to the weary.
As Gilgamesh meets with Pir-napishtim, who relates the story of the
Deluge which destroyed the "elder race", Bhima meets with Hanuman, who
informs him regarding the Ages of the Universe and the races which were
periodically destroyed by deluges. When Bhima reaches the lotus lake he
fights with demons. To heal his wounds and recover strength he plunges
into the lake. "As he drank of the waters, like unto nectar, his energy
and strength were again fully restored." <span
id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_221.md)

Hercules similarly sets out to search for the golden apples which grow
in

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">           those Hesperian gardens famed of old,  
Fortunate fields, and groves and flowery vales.</span>

</div>

As Bhima slew Yakshas which guarded the lotuses, Hercules slew Ladon,
the guardian of the apples. Other heroes kill treasure-protecting
dragons of various kinds.

There is a remarkable resemblance between the Babylonian account of
Gilgamesh's journey through the mountain tunnel to the garden and
seashore, and the Indian story of the demigod Hanuman passing through
the long

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

cavern to the shoreland palace of the female ascetic, when he was
engaged searching for Sita, the wife of Rama, who had been carried away
by Ravana, the demon king of Ceylon. In the version of the latter
narrative which is given in the *Mahàbhàrata*, Hanuman says: "I bring
thee good news, O Rama; for Janaka's daughter hath been seen by me.
Having searched the southern region with all its hills, forests, and
mines for some time, we became very weary. At length we beheld a great
cavern. And having beheld it, we entered that cavern which extended over
many *yojanas*. It was dark and deep, and overgrown with trees and
infested by worms. And having gone a great way through it, we came upon
sunshine and beheld a beautiful palace. It was the abode of the Daitya
(sea demon) Maya. And there we beheld a female ascetic named Parbhávati
engaged in ascetic austerities. And she gave us food and drink of
various kinds. And having refreshed ourselves therewith and regained our
strength, we proceeded along the way shown by her. At last we came out
of the cavern and beheld the briny sea, and on its shores, the *Sahya*,
the *Malaya*, and the great *Dardura* mountains. And ascending the
mountains of *Malaya*, we beheld before us the vast ocean (or, "the
abode of Varuna"). And beholding it, we felt sorely grieved in mind. . .
. We despaired of returning with our lives. . . . We then sat together,
resolved to die there of starvation."

Hanuman and his friends, having had, so far, experiences similar to
those of Gilgamesh, next discovered the eagle giant which had burned its
wings when endeavouring to soar to the sun. This great bird, which
resembles the Etana eagle, expressed the opinion that Sita was in Lanka
(Ceylon), whither she must have been carried by Ravana. But no one dared
to cross the dangerous ocean. Hanuman

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

at length, however, obtained the assistance of Vayu, the wind god, his
divine father, and leapt over the sea, slaying monsters as he went. He
discovered where the fair lady was concealed by the king of
demons. <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_222.md)

The dark tunnel is met with in many British stories of daring heroes who
set out to explore it, but never return. In the Scottish versions the
adventurers are invariably pipers who are accompanied by dogs. The sound
of the pipes is heard for a time; then the music ceases suddenly, and
shortly afterwards the dog returns without a hair upon its body. It has
evidently been in conflict with demons.

The tunnel may run from a castle to the seashore, from a cave on one
side of a hill to a cave on the other, or from a seashore cave to a
distant island.

It is possible that these widespread tunnel stories had origin among the
cave dwellers of the Palæolithic Age, who believed that deep caverns
were the doors of the underground retreats of dragons and giants and
other supernatural enemies of mankind.

In Babylonia, as elsewhere, the priests utilized the floating material
from which all mythologies were framed, and impressed upon it the stamp
of their doctrines. The symbolized stories were afterwards distributed
far and wide, as were those attached to the memory of Alexander the
Great at a later period. Thus in many countries may be found at the
present day different versions of immemorial folk tales, which represent
various stages of culture, and direct and indirect contact at different
periods with civilizations that have stirred the ocean of human thought,
and sent their ideas rippling in widening circles to far-distant shores.
