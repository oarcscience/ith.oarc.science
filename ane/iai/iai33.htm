<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">EFFECT OF ISHTAR'S IMPRISONMENT IN HADES--LOVE DEPARTS FROM THE EARTH--THE EARTH'S SOLEMN DIRGE OF WOE.</H3>
<P>When Ishtar, Queen of Love, from Earth had flown,<BR>
With her love fled, and left all nature prone;<BR>
From Earth all peace with love then fled amain.<BR>
In loneliness the bull stalked o'er the plain,<BR>
And tossed his drooping crest toward the sky,<BR>
In sadness lay upon the green to die;<BR>
On the far kine looked weary and bereaved,<BR>
And turned toward the gods, and wondering grieved.<BR>
The troubled kine then gravely chewed their cud,<BR>
And hungerless in the rich pastures stood.<BR>
The ass his mate abandoned, fled away,<BR>
And loveless wives then cursed the direful day;<BR>
And loving husbands kiss their wives no more,<BR>
And doves their cooing ceased, and separate soar;<BR>
And love then died in. all the breasts of men,<BR>
And strife supreme on earth was reveling then.</P>
<P>The sexes of mankind their wars divide,<BR>
And women hate all men, and them deride;<BR>
And some demented hurl aside their gowns,<BR>
And queens their robes discard and jewelled crowns,<BR>
And rush upon the streets bereft of shame,<BR>
Their forms expose, and all the gods defame.<BR>
"Alas! from earth the Queen of Love has gone,<BR>
And lovers 'void their haunts with faces wan<BR>
And spurn from them the hateful thoughts of love,<BR>
For love no longer reigns, all life to move.<BR>
An awful thrill now speeds through Hades' doors,<BR>
And shakes with horror all the dismal floors;<BR>
A wail upon the breeze through space doth fly,<BR>
And howling gales sweep madly through the sky;<BR>
Through all the universe there speeds a pang<BR>
Of travail. Mam-nu-tu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> appalled doth hang</P>

<P>Upon her blackened pinions in the air<BR>
And piteous from her path leads Black Despair,<BR>
"The queen in chains in Hades dying lies,<BR>
And life with her," they cry, "forever dies!"<BR>
Through misty glades and darkened depths of space,<BR>
Tornadoes roar her fate to Earth's sweet face;<BR>
The direful tidings from far Hades pour<BR>
Upon her bosom with their saddest roar;<BR>
Like moans of mighty powers in misery,<BR>
They bring the tale with awful minstrelsy.<BR>
And Earth her mists wrapped round her face in woe,<BR>
While icy pangs through all her breast deep flow.<BR>
Her bosom sobbing wails a mighty moan,<BR>
"Alas! for-ever my sweet queen hath flown!"<BR>
With shrieks of hurricane, and ocean's groan,<BR>
And sobbing of the winds through heights unknown,<BR>
Through mountain gorges sweep her wails of woe,<BR>
Through every land and seas, her sorrows flow:<BR>
Oh, moan! oh, moan! dear mountains, lakes, and seas!<BR>
Oh, weep with me dear plants, and flowers, and trees!<BR>
Alas! my beauty fading now will die!<BR>
Oh, weep, ye stars, for me in every sky!<BR>
Oh, Samas, hide thy face! I am undone!<BR>
Oh, weep with me Ur-ru,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> my precious son.<BR>
Let all your notes of joy, my birds, be stilled;<BR>
Your mother's heart with dread despair is filled:</P>
<P>Come back, my flowerets, with your fragrant dews;<BR>
Come, all my beauties, with your brightest hues;<BR>
Come back, my plants and buds and youngling shoots!<BR>
Within your mother's bosom hide your roots.<BR>
Oh, children, children! Love hath fled away,<BR>
Alas! that life I gave should see this day!<BR>
Your queen lies dying in her awful woe,<BR>
Oh, why should she from us to Hades go?"</P>
<P>Wide Nature felt her woe, and ceased to spring,<BR>
And withered buds their vigor lost, and fling<BR>
No more their fragrance to the lifeless air;<BR>
The fruit-trees died, or barren ceased to bear;<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>

<P>The male plants kiss their female plants no more;<BR>
And pollen on the winds no longer soar<BR>
To carry their caresses to the seed<BR>
Of waiting hearts that unavailing bleed,<BR>
Until they fold their petals in despair,<BR>
And dying, drop to earth, and wither there.<BR>
The growing grain no longer fills its head,<BR>
The fairest fields of corn lie blasted, dead.<BR>
All Nature mourning dons her sad attire,<BR>
And plants and trees with falling leaves expire.<BR>
And Samas' light and moon-god's soothing rays<BR>
Earth's love no more attracts; recurring days<BR>
Are shortened by a blackness deep profound<BR>
That rises higher as the days come round.<BR>
At last their light flees from the darkened skies,<BR>
The last faint gleam now passes, slowly dies.<BR>
Upon a blasted world, dread darkness falls,<BR>
O'er dying nature, crumbling cities' walls.<BR>
Volcanoes' fires are now the only light,<BR>
Where pale-faced men collect around in fright;<BR>
With fearful cries the lurid air they rend,<BR>
To all the gods their wild petitions send.</P>
