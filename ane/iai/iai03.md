## COLUMN II

### THE FALL OF ERECH

O Moon-god, <span id="fr_12"></span>[1b](#fn_12.md) hear my cry! With thy
pure light  
Oh, take my spirit through that awful night  
That hovers o'er the long-forgotten years,  
To sing Accadia's songs and weep her tears!  
'Twas thus I prayed, when lo! my spirit rose  
On fleecy clouds, enwrapt in soft repose;  
And I beheld beneath me nations glide  
In swift succession by, in all their pride:  
The earth was filled with cities of mankind,  
And empires fell beneath a summer wind.  
The soil and clay walked forth upon the plains  
In forms of life, and every atom gains  
A place in man or breathes in animals;  
And flesh and blood and bones become the walls

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Of palaces and cities, which soon fall  
To unknown dust beneath some ancient wall.  
All this I saw while guided by the stroke  
Of unseen pinions:  
                       Then amid the smoke  
That rose o'er burning cities, I beheld  
White Khar-sak-kur-ra's <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) brow arise
that held  
The secrets of the gods--that felt the prore  
Of Khasisadra's ark; I heard the roar  
Of battling elements, and saw the waves  
That tossed above mankind's commingled graves.  
The mighty mountain as some sentinel  
Stood on the plains alone; and o'er it fell  
A halo, bright, divine; its summit crowned  
With sunbeams, shining on the earth around  
And o'er the wide expanse of plains;--below  
Lay Khar-sak-kal-ama <span id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_14.md) with light
aglow,  
And nestling far away within my view  
Stood Erech, Nipur, Marad, Eridu,  
And Babylon, the tower-city old,  
In her own splendor shone like burnished gold.  
And lo! grand Erech in her glorious days  
Lies at my feet. I see a wondrous maze  
Of vistas, groups, and clustering columns round,  
Within, without the palace;--from the ground  
Of outer staircases, massive, grand,  
Stretch to the portals where the pillars stand.  
A thousand carvèd columns reaching high  
To silver rafters in an azure sky,  
And palaces and temples round it rise  
With lofty turrets glowing to the skies,  
And massive walls far spreading o'er the plains,  
Here live and move Accadia's courtly trains,  
And see! the *pit-u-dal-ti* <span id="fr_15"></span>[4](#fn_15.md) at the
gates,  
And *masari* <span id="fr_16"></span>[5](#fn_16.md) patrol and guard the
streets!

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

And yonder comes a *kis-ib*, nobleman,  
With a young prince; and see! a caravan  
Winds through the gates! With men the streets are filled!  
And chariots, a people wise and skilled  
In things terrestrial, what science, art,  
Here reign! With laden ships from every mart  
The docks are filled, and foreign fabrics bring  
From peoples, lands, where many an empire, king,  
Have lived and passed away, and naught have left  
In. history or song. Dread Time hath cleft  
Us far apart; their kings and kingdoms, priests  
And bards are gone, and o'er them sweep the mists  
Of darkness backward spreading through all time,  
Their records swept away in every clime.  
Those alabaster stairs let us ascend,  
And through this lofty portal we will wend.  
See! richest Sumir rugs amassed, subdue  
The tilèd pavement with its varied hue,  
Upon the turquoise ceiling sprinkled stars  
Of gold and silver crescents in bright pairs!  
And gold-fringed scarlet curtains grace each door,  
And from the inlaid columns reach the floor:  
From golden rods extending round the halls,  
Bright silken hangings drape the sculptured walls.

But part those scarlet hangings at the door  
Of yon grand chamber! tread the antique floor!  
Behold the sovereign on her throne of bronze,  
While crouching at her feet a lion fawns;  
The glittering court with gold and gems ablaze  
With ancient splendor of the glorious days  
Of Accad's sovereignty. Behold the ring  
Of dancing beauties circling while they sing  
With amorous forms in moving melody,  
The measure keep to music's harmony.  
Hear! how the music swells from silver lute  
And golden-stringèd lyres and softest flute  
And harps and tinkling cymbals, measured drums,  
While a soft echo from the chamber comes.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

But see! the sovereign lifts her jewelled hand,  
The music ceases at the Queen's command;  
And lo! two chiefs in warrior's array,  
With golden helmets plumed with colors gay,  
And golden shields, and silver coats of mail,  
Obeisance make to her with faces pale,  
Prostrate themselves before their sovereign's throne;  
In silence brief remain with faces prone,  
Till Ellat-gula <span id="fr_17"></span>[6](#fn_17.md) speaks: "My chiefs,
arise!  
What word have ye for me? what new surprise?  
Tur-tau-u, <span id="fr_18"></span>[7](#fn_18.md) rising, says, "O
Dannat <span id="fr_19"></span>[8](#fn_19.md) Queen!  
Thine enemy, Khum-baba <span id="fr_20"></span>[9](#fn_20.md) with
Rim-siu <span id="fr_21"></span>[10](#fn_21.md)  
With clanging shields, appears upon the hills,  
And Elam's host the land of Sumir fills."  
"Away, ye chiefs! sound loud the *nappa-khu*! <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)  
Send to their post each warrior bar-ru!" <span
id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md)  
The gray embattlements rose in the light  
That lingered yet from Samas' <span id="fr_24"></span>[3](#fn_24.md) rays,
ere Night  
Her sable folds had spread across the sky.  
Thus Erech stood, where in her infancy  
The huts of wandering Accads had been built  
Of soil, and rudely roofed by woolly pelt  
O'erlaid upon the shepherd's worn-out staves,  
And yonder lay their fathers' unmarked graves.  
Their chieftains in those early days oft meet  
Upon the mountains where they Samas greet,  
With their rude sacrifice upon a tree  
High-raised that their sun-god may shilling see  
Their offering divine; invoking pray  
For aid, protection, blessing through the day.

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

Beneath these walls and palaces abode  
The spirit of their country--each man trod  
As if his soul to Erech's weal belonged,  
And heeded not the enemy which thronged  
Before the gates, that now were closed with bars  
Of bronze thrice fastened.

                                See the thousand cars  
And chariots arrayed across the plains!  
The marching hosts of Elam's armèd trains,  
The archers, slingers in advance amassed,  
With black battalions in the centre placed,  
With chariots before them drawn in line,  
Bedecked with brightest trappings iridine.,  
While gorgeous plumes of Elam's horses nod  
Beneath the awful sign of Elam's god.  
On either side the mounted spearsmen far  
Extend; and all the enginery of war  
Are brought around the walls with fiercest shouts,  
And from behind their shields each archer shoots.

Thus Erech is besieged by her dread foes,  
And she at last must feel Accadia's woes,  
And feed the vanity of conquerors,  
Who boast o'er victories in all their wars.  
Great Subartu <span id="fr_25"></span>[4](#fn_25.md) has fallen by
Sutu <span id="fr_26"></span>[5](#fn_26.md)  
And Kassi, <span id="fr_27"></span>[6](#fn_27.md) Goim <span
id="fr_28"></span>[7](#fn_28.md) fell with Lul-lu-bu, <span
id="fr_29"></span>[8](#fn_29.md)  
Thus Khar-sak-kal-a-ma <span id="fr_30"></span>[9](#fn_30.md) all
Eridu <span id="fr_31"></span>[10](#fn_31.md)  
O'erran with Larsa's allies; Subartu  
With Duran <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md) thus was conquered by
these sons  
Of mighty Shem and strewn was Accad's bones  
Throughout her plains, and mountains, valleys fair,  
Unburied lay in many a wolf's lair.\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

Oh, where is Accad's chieftain Izdubar,  
Her mightiest unrivalled prince of war?

The turrets on the battlemented walls  
Swarm with skilled bowmen, archers--from them falls  
A cloud of wingèd missiles on their foes,  
Who swift reply with shouts and twanging bows;  
And now amidst the raining death appears  
The scaling ladder, lined with glistening spears,  
But see! the ponderous catapults now crush  
The ladder, spearsmen, with their mighty rush  
Of rocks and beams, nor in their fury slacked  
As if a toppling wall came down intact  
Upon the maddened mass of men below.  
But other ladders rise, and up them flow  
The tides of armèd spearsmen with their shields;  
From others bowmen shoot, and each man wields,  
A weapon, never yielding to his foe,  
For death alone he aims with furious blow.  
At last upon the wall two soldiers spring,  
A score of spears their corses backward fling.  
But others take their place, and man to man,  
And spear to spear, and sword to sword, till ran  
The walls with slippery gore; but Erech's men  
Are brave and hurl them from their walls again.  
And now the battering-rams with swinging power  
Commence their thunders, shaking every tower;  
And miners work beneath the crumbling walls,  
Alas! before her foemen Erech falls.  
Vain are suspended chains against the blows  
Of dire assaulting engines.  
                                 Ho! there goes  
The eastern wall with Erech's strongest tower!  
And through the breach her furious foemen pour:  
A wall of steel withstands the onset fierce,  
But thronging Elam's spears the lines soon pierce,  
A band of chosen men there fight to die,  
Before their enemies disdain to fly;  
The masari <span id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_33.md) within the breach thus
died,\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

And with their dying shout the foe defied.  
The foes swarm through the breach and o'er the walls,  
And Erech in extremity loud calls  
Upon the gods for aid, but prays for naught,  
While Elam's soldiers, to a frenzy wrought,  
Pursue and slay, and sack the city old  
With fiendish shouts for blood and yellow gold.  
Each man that falls the foe decapitates,  
And bears the reeking death to Erech's gates.  
The gates are hidden 'neath the pile of heads  
That climbs above the walls, and outward spreads  
A heap of ghastly plunder bathed in blood.  
Beside them calm scribes of the victors stood,  
And careful note the butcher's name, and check  
The list; and for each head a price they make.  
Thus pitiless the sword of Elam gleams  
And the best blood of Erech flows in streams.  
From Erech's walls some fugitives escape,  
And others in Euphrates wildly leap,  
And hide beneath its rushes on the bank  
And many 'neath the yellow waters sank.

The harper of the Queen, an agèd man,  
Stands lone upon the bank, while he doth scan  
The horizon with anxious, careworn face,  
Lest ears profane of Elam's hated race  
Should hear his strains of mournful melody:  
Now leaning on his harp in memory  
Enwrapt, while fitful breezes lift his locks  
Of snow, he sadly kneels upon the rocks  
And sighing deeply clasps his hands in woe,  
While the dread past before his mind doth flow.  
A score and eight of years have slowly passed  
Since Rim-a-gu, with Elam's host amassed,  
Kardunia's ancient capital had stormed.  
The glorious walls and turrets are transformed  
To a vast heap of ruins, weird, forlorn,  
And Elam's spears gleam through the coming morn.  
From the sad sight his eyes he turns away,

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

His soul breathes through his harp while he doth play  
With bended head his agèd hands thus woke  
The woes of Erech with a measured stroke:

O Erech! dear Erech, my beautiful home,  
  Accadia's pride, O bright land of the bard,  
Come back to my vision, dear Erech, oh, come!  
  Fair land of my birth, how thy beauty is marred!  
The horsemen of Elam, her spearsmen and bows,  
  Thy treasures have ravished, thy towers thrown down,  
And Accad is fallen, trod down by her foes.  
  Oh, where are thy temples of ancient renown?

Gone are her brave heroes beneath the red tide,  
  Gone are her white vessels that rode o'er the main,  
No more on the river her pennon shall ride,  
  Gargan-na is fallen, her people are slain.  
Wild asses <span id="fr_34"></span>[3](#fn_34.md) shall gallop across thy
grand floors,  
  And wild bulls shall paw them and hurl the dust high  
Upon the wild cattle that flee through her doors,  
  And doves shall continue her mournful slave's cry.

Oh, where are the gods of our Erech so proud,  
  As flies they are swarming away from her halls,  
The Sedu <span id="fr_35"></span>[4](#fn_35.md) of Erech are gone as a
cloud,  
  As wild fowl are flying away from her walls.  
Three years did she suffer, besieged by her foes,  
  Her gates were thrown down and defiled by the feet  
Who brought to poor Erech her tears and her woes,  
  In vain to our Ishtar with prayers we entreat.

To Ishtar bowed down doth our Bel thus reply,  
  "Come, Ishtar, my queenly one, hide all thy tears,  
Our hero, Tar-u-man-i izzu Sar-ri, <span id="fr_36"></span>[5](#fn_36.md)  
  In Kipur is fortified with his strong spears.\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

The hope of Kardunia, <span id="fr_37"></span>[6](#fn_37.md) land of my
delight,  
  Shall come to thy rescue, upheld by my hands,  
Deliverer of peoples, whose heart is aright,  
  Protector of temples, shall lead his brave bands.

Awake then, brave Accad, to welcome the day!  
  Behold thy bright banners yet flaming on high,  
Triumphant are streaming on land and the sea!  
  Arise, then, O Accad! behold the Sami! <span
id="fr_38"></span>[7](#fn_38.md)  
Arranged in their glory the mighty gods come  
  In purple and gold the grand Tam-u <span id="fr_39"></span>[8](#fn_39.md)
doth shine  
Over Erech, mine Erech, my beautiful home,  
  Above thy dear ashes, behold thy god's sign!
