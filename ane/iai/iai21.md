## COLUMN II

### COUNCIL IN THE PALACE

The seers on silver couches round the throne;  
The hangings of the carvèd lintel thrown  
Aside; the heralds cried: "The Sar! The Sar!  
The council opens our King Izdubar!"  
The Sar walked o'er the velvets to his throne  
Of gold inlaid with gems. A vassal prone  
Before the Sar now placed the stool of gold,  
Arranged his royal robes with glittering fold  
Of laces, fringes rich inwove with pearls,  
Embroidered with quaint figures, curious twirls.  
Behind the throne a prince of royal blood  
Arrayed in courtly splendor, waiting stood,  
And gently waved a jewelled fan aloft  
Above the Sar's tiara; carpets soft  
From Accad's looms the varied tilings bright,  
In tasteful order, part conceal from sight.

The glittering pillars stand with gold o'erlaid  
In rows throughout the room to the arcade,  
Within the entrance from a columned hall.  
The ivory-graven panels on the wall  
On every side are set in solid gold.  
The canopy chased golden pillars hold  
Above the throne, and emeralds and gems  
Flash from the counsellor's rich diadems.  
In silence all await the monarch's sign:  
"This council hath been called, the hour is thine  
To counsel with thy King upon a plan  
Of conquest of our foes, who ride this plain,  
Unchecked around; these Suti should be driven  
From Sumir's plain. Have ye our wrongs forgiven?

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

Khumbaba hath enjoyed great Accad's spoils  
Too long; with him we end these long turmoils.  
What sayest thou, Heabani?--all my seers?  
Hath Accad not her chariots and spears?"

Then one among the wisest seers arose  
"To save our precious tune which hourly flows,  
He should our seer, Rab-sak-i <span id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_189.md)
first invite  
To lay his plans before the Sar, and light  
May break across our vision. I confess  
Great obstacles I see, but acquiesce  
In any plan you deem may bring success.  
The gods, I feel our cause will gladly bless."  
Another spoke, and all agree at last  
To hear the seer whose wisdom all surpassed.

Heabani modestly arose and said,  
And gracefully to all inclined his head:  
"O Sar! thy seer will gladly counsel give  
To thee, and all our seers; my thanks receive  
For thy great confidence in my poor skill  
To crush our foes who every country fill.  
I with the Sar agree that we should strike  
A blow against the rival king, who like  
Our Sar, is a great giant king, and lives  
Within a mountain castle, whence he grieves  
All nations by his tyranny, and reigns  
With haughty power from Kharsak to these plains.  
I'll lead the way, my Sar, to his wild home;  
'Tis twenty *kas-pu* <span id="fr_192"></span>[2](#fn_190.md) hence, if you
will come.  
A wall surrounds his castle in a wood,  
With brazen gates strong fastened. I have stood  
Beneath the lofty pines which dwindle these  
To shrubs that grow in parks as ornate trees.  
The mighty walls will reach six *gars* <span
id="fr_193"></span>[3](#fn_191.md) in height,  
And two in breadth, like Nipur's <span id="fr_194"></span>[4](#fn_192.md)
to the sight.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

And when you go, take with you many mules;  
With men to bring the spoils, and needed tools  
To break the gates, his castle overthrow:  
To lose no time, to-morrow we should go.  
To Erech, pines and cedars we can bring  
With all the wealth of Elam's giant king,  
And Erech fill with glorious parks and halls,  
Remove these *man-u-bani*, <span id="fr_195"></span>[5](#fn_193.md) ruined
walls.  
Take to your hearts, ye seers, poor Erech's wrongs!  
Her fall, the bards of Elam sing in songs.  
I love dear Erech, may her towers shine!  
He seized his harp, thus sung the seer divine:

"O Erech! thy bright plains I love;  
Although from thee thy seer did rove,  
       My heart remained with thee!  
The foe destroyed thy beauteous towers,  
Sa-mu forgot to rain her showers,  
       And could I happy be?

Mine eyes beheld thy fallen gates,  
Thy blood warm flowing in thy streets,  
       My heart was broken then.  
I raised mine eyes and saw thy Sar  
In glory on his steed of war,  
       And joy returned again!

I saw the foe in wild dismay  
Before him flee that glorious day.  
       With joy I heard the cry  
Of victory resound afar,  
Saw Elam crushed 'neath Accad's car:  
       I shouted, Victory!

Away! till birds of prey shall rend  
His flesh and haughty Elam bend  
       Before our mighty Sar!\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

Beneath his forest of pine-trees  
The battle-cry then loudly raise,  
       We follow Izdubar!

And may the birds of prey surround  
Khumbaba stretched upon the ground,  
       Destroy his body there!  
And Izdubar alone be king,  
And all his people joyful sing,  
       With glory crown him here!

All hail! All hail! our giant King,  
The *amaranti* <span id="fr_196"></span>[6](#fn_194.md) for him bring,  
       To crown him, crown him here,  
As King of Accad and Sutu,  
And all the land of Subar-tu!  
       So sayeth Hea's seer!"

The cuunsellors and chieftains wildly cry  
Around the throne, "All hail *izzu sar-ri*  
Of Su-bar-tu!" and shouting leave the halls  
To summon Accad's soldiers from the walls  
To hear the war proclaimed against their foes,  
And Accad's war-cry from them loud arose.  
King Izdubar Heabani warmly prest  
Within his arms upon his throbbing breast,  
And said, "Let us to the war temple go,  
That all the gods their favor may bestow."  
The seer replied, "'Tis well! then let us wend  
Our way, and at the altar we will bend,--  
To Ishtar's temple, where our goddess queen  
Doth reign, seek her propitious favor, then  
In Samas' holy temple pray for aid  
To crush our foe;--with glory on each blade,  
Our hands will carry victory in war."  
The chiefs, without the temple, join their Sar.
