# ALCOVE I

## TABLET I: COLUMN I

### INVOCATION

O LOVE, my queen and goddess, come to me;  
My soul shall never cease to worship thee;  
Come pillow here thy head upon my breast,  
And whisper in my lyre thy softest, best,  
And sweetest melodies of bright *Sami*, <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)  
Our Happy Fields <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) above dear
*Subartu*; <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2)  
Come nestle closely with those lips of love  
And balmy breath, and I with thee shall rove  
Through *Sari* <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3) past ere life on earth
was known,  
And Time unconscious sped not, nor had flown.  
Thou art our all in this impassioned life:  
How sweetly comes thy presence ending strife,  
Thou god of peace and Heaven's undying joy,  
Oh, hast thou ever left one pain or cloy  
Upon this beauteous world to us so dear?  
To all mankind thou art their goddess here.  
To thee we sing, our holiest, fairest god,  
The One who in that awful chaos trod  
And woke the Elements by Law of Love  
To teeming worlds in harmony to move.  
From chaos thou hast led us by thy hand,  
 <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4) Thus spoke to man upon that budding
land:  
"The Queen of Heaven, of the dawn am I,  
The goddess of all wide immensity,

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

For thee I open wide the golden gate  
Of happiness, and for thee love create  
To glorify the heavens and fill with joy  
The earth, its children with sweet love employ."  
Thou gavest then the noblest melody  
And highest bliss--grand nature's harmony.  
With love the finest particle is rife,  
And deftly woven in the woof of life,  
In throbbing dust or clasping grains of sand,  
In globes of glistening dew that shining stand  
On each pure petal, Love's own legacies  
Of flowering verdure, Earth's sweet panoplies;  
By love those atoms sip their sweets and pass  
To other atoms, join and keep the mass  
With mighty forces moving through all space,  
'Tis thus on earth all life has found its place.  
Through Kisar, <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5) Love came formless
through the air  
In countless forms behold her everywhere!  
Oh, could we hear those whispering roses sweet,  
Three beauties bending till their petals meet,  
And blushing, mingling their sweet fragrance there  
In language yet unknown to mortal ear.  
Their whisperings of love from morn till night  
Would teach us tenderly to love the right.  
O Love, here stay! Let chaos not return!  
With hate each atom would its lover spurn  
In air above, on land, or in the sea,  
O World, undone and lost that loseth thee!  
For love we briefly come, and pass away  
For other men and maids; thus bring the day  
Of love continuous through this glorious life.  
Oh, hurl away those weapons fierce of strife!  
We here a moment, point of time but live,  
Too short is life for throbbing hearts to grieve.  
Thrice holy is that form that love hath kissed,  
And happy is that man with heart thus blessed.  
Oh, let not curses fall upon that head  
Whom love hath cradled on the welcome bed\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

Of bliss, the bosom of our fairest god,  
Or hand of love e'er grasp the venging rod.

Oh, come, dear Zir-ri, <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6) tune your lyres
and lutes,  
And sing of love with chastest, sweetest notes,  
Of Accad's goddess Ishtar, Queen of Love,  
And Izdubar, with softest measure move;  
Great Samas' <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7) son, of him dear Zir-ri
sing!  
Of him whom goddess Ishtar warmly wooed,  
Of him whose breast with virtue was imbued.  
He as a giant towered, lofty grown,  
As Babil's <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8) great *pa-te-si* <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9) was he known,  
His armèd fleet commanded on the seas  
And erstwhile travelled on the foreign leas;  
His mother Ellat-gula <span id="fr_10"></span>[1a](#fn_10) on the
throne  
From Erech all Kardunia <span id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11) ruled alone.
