## COLUMN IV

### CORONATION OF IZDUBAR

A crowd of maidens led a glorious van;  
With roses laden the fair heralds ran,  
With silver-throated music chant the throng,  
And sweetly sang the coronation song:  
And now we see the gorgeous cavalcade,  
Within the walls in Accad's grand parade  
They pass, led by the maidens crowned with flowers,  
Who strew the path with fragrance;--to the towers  
And walls and pillars of each door bright cling  
The garlands. Hear the maidens joyful sing!

"Oh, shout the cry! Accadians, joyful sing  
For our Deliverer! Oh, crown him King!  
Then strew his path with garlands, tulips, rose,  
And wave his banners as he onward goes;  
Our mighty Nin-rad comes, oh, raise the cry!  
We crown Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!

Away to Samas' temple grand, away!  
  For Accad crowns him, crowns him there!  
He is our chosen Sar <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) this glorious
day,  
  Oh, send the Khanga <span id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50.md) through the
air!

Then chant the chorus, all ye hosts above!  
O daughters, mothers, sing for him we love!  
His glory who can sing, who brings us joy?  
For hope and gladness all our hearts employ.  
He comes, our hope and strength in every war:  
We crown him as our king, our Izdubar!

Away to Samas' temple grand, away!  
  For Accad crowns him, crowns him there!  
He is our chosen Sar this glorious day,  
  Oh, send the Khanga through the air!

Toward the temple filed the long parade,  
The nobles led while Accad's music played;

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

The harps and timbrels, barsoms, drums and flutes  
Unite with trumpets and the silver lutes.  
Surrounded by his chieftains rides the Sar  
In purple robes upon his brazen car.  
Bedecked with garlands, steeds of whitest snow  
The chariot draw in state with movement slow,  
Each steed led by a *kisib*, nobleman,  
A score of beauteous horses linked in span.  
The army follows with their nodding plumes,  
And burnished armor, trumpets, rolling drums,  
And glistening spears enwreathed with fragrant flowers,  
While scarfs are waving from the crowded towers.,  
And shouts of joy their welcome loud proclaim,  
And from each lip resounds their monarch's name.

And now before the holy temple stands  
The chariot, in silence cease the bands.  
Around an altar stand the waiting priests,  
And held by them, the sacrificial beasts.  
The hero from his chair descends,  
And bowing to the priests, he lowly bends  
Before the sacred altar of the Sun,  
And prays to Samas, Accad's Holy One.

 <span id="fr_51"></span>[3](#fn_51.md)"O Samas, I invoke thee, throned on
high!  
  Within the cedars' shadow bright thou art,  
Thy footing rests upon immensity;  
  All nations eagerly would seek thy heart.  
Their eyes have turned toward thee, O our Friend!  
  Whose brilliant light illuminates all lands,  
Before thy coming all the nations bend,  
  Oh, gather every people with thy hands!  
For thou, O Samas, knowest boundaries  
  Of every kingdom, falsehood dost destroy,  
And every evil thought from sorceries  
  Of wonders omens, dreams that do annoy,  
And evil apparitions, thou dost turn  
  To happy issue; malice, dark designs;

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

And men and countries in thy might o'erturn,  
  And sorcery that every soul maligns.  
Oh, in thy presence refuge let me find!  
  From those who spells invoke against thy King,  
Protect one! and my heart within thine, oh, bind!  
   <span id="fr_52"></span>[4](#fn_52.md) Thy breath within mine inmost
soul, oh, bring!  
That I with thee, O Samas, may rejoice.  
  And may the gods who me created, take  
Thy hands and lead me, make thy will my choice,  
   <span id="fr_53"></span>[5](#fn_53.md) Direct my breath, my hands, and
of me make  
They servant, Lord of light of legions vast,  
  O Judge, thy glory hath all things surpassed!"

The King then rises, takes the sacred glass, <span
id="fr_54"></span>[6](#fn_54.md)  
And holds it in the sun before the mass  
Of waiting fuel on the altar piled.  
The centring rays--the fuel glowing gild  
With a round spot of fire and quickly. spring  
Above the altar curling, while they sing!

 <span id="fr_55"></span>[7](#fn_55.md) "Oh, to the desert places may it
fly,  
  This incantation holy!  
O spirit of the heavens, us this day  
  Remember, oh, remember!  
O spirit of the earth, to thee we pray,  
  Remember! Us remember!

"O God of Fire! a lofty prince doth stand,  
  A warrior, and son of the blue sea,  
Before the God of Fire in thine own land,  
  Before thy holy fires that from us free  
Dread Darkness, where dark Nuk-khu reigns.  
  Our prince, as monarch we proclaim,  
His destiny thy power maintains,  
  Oh, crown his glory with wide fame!

"With bronze and metal thou dost bless  
  All men, and givest silver, gold.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

The goddess with the hornèd face  
  Did bless us with thee from of old.  
From dross thy fires change gold to purity;  
  Oh, bless our fire-king, round him shine  
With Heaven's vast sublimity!  
  And like the earth with rays divine,  
  As the bright walls of Heaven's shrine."
