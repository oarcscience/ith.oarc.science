<P>But see! they pass from those dark gates and walls,<BR>
And fly upon the breeze from Hades' halls,<BR>
Hark! hark! the sounding harp is stilled! it falls<BR>
From Tammuz's hands! Oh, how its wailing calls<BR>
To you bright <I>zi-ni</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> flying through the skies,<BR>
See! one sweet spirit of the wind swift flies<BR>
And grasps the wailing harp before it ends<BR>
Its wail of woe, and now beneath it bends,<BR>
With silent pinions listening to its strings,<BR>
Wild sobbing on the winds;--with wailing rings<BR>
The conscious harp, and trembles in her hands.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></P>
<P>A rush of pinions comes from myriad lands,<BR>
With moanings sends afar the awful tale,<BR>
And mourners brings with every whispering gale.<BR>
And see! the queen's companion fainting sinks!<BR>
She lays him on that cloud with fleecy brinks!<BR>
And oh! his life is ebbing fast away!<BR>
She wildly falls upon his breast, and gray<BR>
Her face becomes with bitter agony.<BR>
She tearless kneels, wrapt in her misery<BR>
And now upon his breast she lays her head,<BR>
With tears that gods, alas! with men must shed;<BR>
She turning, sobs to her sweet waiting maids,<BR>
Who weeping o'er her stand with bended heads:<BR>
"Assemble, oh, my maids, in mourning here,<BR>
The gods! and spirits of the earth bring near!"</P>
<P>They come! they come! three hundred spirits high,<BR>
The heavenly spirits come! the I-gi-gi!<BR>
From Heaven's streams and mouths and plains and vales,<BR>
And gods by thousands on the wings of gales.<BR>
The spirits of the earth, An-un-na-ci,<BR>
Now join around their sisters of the sky.<BR>
Hark! hear her weeping to the heavenly throng,<BR>
Imploring them to chant their mournful song:</P>
<P>"With your gold lyres, the dirge, oh, sing with me!<BR>
And moan with me, with your sweet melody;<BR>
With swelling notes, as zephyrs softly wail,<BR>
And cry with me as sobbing of the gale.<BR>
O Earth! dear Earth! oh, wail with thy dead trees!<BR>
With sounds of mountain torrents, moaning seas!<BR>
And spirits of the lakes, and streams, and vales,<BR>
And Zi-ku-ri of mountains' track-less trail,<BR>
join our bright legions with your queen! Oh, weep<BR>
With your sad tears, dear spirits of the deep!<BR>
Let all the mournful sounds of earth be heard,<BR>
The breeze hath carried stored from beast and bird;<BR>
Join the sweet notes of doves for their lost love<BR>
To the wild moans of hours,--wailing move;<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A></P>
<P>Let choirs of Heaven and of the earth then peal,<BR>
All living beings my dread sorrow feel!<BR>
Oh, come with saddest, weirdest melody,<BR>
join earth and sky in one sweet threnody!"</P>
<P>Ten thousand times ten thousand now in line,<BR>
In all the panoplies of gods divine;<BR>
A million crowns are shining in the light,<BR>
A million sceptres, robes of purest white!<BR>
Ten thousand harps and lutes and golden lyres<BR>
Are waiting now to start the Heavenly choirs.</P>
<P>And lo! a chariot from Heaven comes,<BR>
While halves rise from yonder sapphire domes;<BR>
A chariot incrusted with bright gems,<BR>
A blaze of glory shines from diadems.<BR>
See! in the car the queen o'er Tammuz bends,<BR>
And nearer the procession slowly wends,<BR>
Her regal diadem with tears is dimmed;<BR>
And her bright form by sorrow is redeemed<BR>
To sweeter, holier beauty in her woe;<BR>
Her tears a halo form and brighter flow.</P>
<P>Caparisoned with pearls, ten milk-white steeds<BR>
Are harnessed to her chariot that leads;<BR>
On snow-white swans beside her ride her maids,<BR>
They come! through yonder silver cloudy glades!<BR>
Behind her chariot ten sovereigns ride;<BR>
Behind them comes all Heaven's lofty pride,<BR>
On pale white steeds, the chargers of the skies.<BR>
The clouds of snowy pinions rustling rise!<BR>
But hark! what is that strain of melody<BR>
That fills our souls with grandest euphony?<BR>
Hear how it swells and dies upon the breeze!<BR>
To softest whisper of the leaves of trees;<BR>
Then sweeter, grander, nobler, sweeping comes,<BR>
Like myriad lyres that peal through Heaven's domes.<BR>
But, oh! how sad and sweet the notes now come!<BR>
Like music of the spheres that softly hum;<BR>
It rises, falls, with measured melody,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A></P>
<P>With saddest notes and mournful symphony.<BR>
From all the universe sad notes repeat<BR>
With doleful strains of woe transcendent, sweet;<BR>
Hush! hear the song! my throbbing heart be still!<BR>
The songs of gods above the heavens fill!</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Oh, weep with your sweet tears, and mourning chant,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er this dread loss of Heaven's queen.<BR>
With her, O sisters, join your sweetest plaint<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er our dear Tammuz, Tammuz slain.<BR>
Come, all ye spirits, with your drooping wings,<BR>
No more to us sweet joy he brings;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, me, my brother!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>Oh, weep! oh, weep! ye spirits of the air,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, weep! oh, weep! An-un-na-ci!<BR>
Our own dear queen is filled with dread despair.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, pour your tears, dear earth and sky,<BR>
Oh, weep with bitter tears, O dear Sedu,<BR>
O'er fearful deeds of Nin-azu;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, me, my brother!</P>
<P>Let joy be stilled! and every hope be dead!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears alone our hearts distil.<BR>
My love has gone!--to darkness he has fled;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dread sorrow's cup for us, oh, fill!<BR>
And weep for Tammuz we have held so dear,<BR>
Sweet sisters of the earth and air;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, me, my sister!</P>
<P>Oh, come ye, dearest, dearest Zi-re-nu,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With grace and mercy help us bear<BR>
Our loss and hers; our weeping queen, oh, see!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And drop with us a sister's tear.<BR>
Before your eyes our brother slain! oh, view;<BR>
Oh, weep with us o'er him so true;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, me, his sister!</P>

<P>The sky is dead; its beauty all is gone,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, weep, ye clouds, for my dead love!<BR>
Your queen in her dread sorrow now is prone.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O rocks and hills in tears, oh, move!<BR>
And all my heavenly flowerets for me weep,<BR>
O'er him who now in death doth sleep;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, me, my Tammuz!</P>
<P>Oh, drop o'er him your fragrant dewy tears,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For your own queen who brings you joy,<BR>
For Love, the Queen of Love, no longer cheers,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my heart it all doth cloy.<BR>
Alas! I give you love, nor can receive,<BR>
O all my children for me grieve;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, me, my Tammuz!</P>
<P>Alas! alas! my heart is dying--dead!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these bitter pangs of grief<BR>
Despair hath fallen on my queenly head,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, is there, sisters, no relief?<BR>
Hath Tammuz from me ever, ever, gone?<BR>
My heart is dead, and turned to stone;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, me, his queen!</P>
<P>My sister spirits, O my brothers dear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My sorrow strikes me to the earth;<BR>
Oh, let me die! I now no fate can fear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is left a fearful dearth.<BR>
Alas, from me all joy! all joy! hath gone;<BR>
Oh, Ninazu, what hast thou done?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, me, his queen!"</P></DIR>

<P>To Hades' world beyond our sight they go,<BR>
And leave upon the skies Mar-gid-da's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> glow,<BR>

To earth, and fills with light and love the skies.</P>
