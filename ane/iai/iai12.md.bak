### EXPEDITION OF ZAIDU IN SEARCH OF THE SEER

Prince Zaidu on his steed now hastes away,  
Upon the plains he travelled all that day;  
Next morn the Za-Gabri he slow ascends,  
Along the mountain sides the horseman wends  
Beneath the Eri-ni, <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md) and cliffs,
and sees  
The plains and mountains o'er the misty trees  
From the wild summit, and old Khar-sak glow  
Above them all with its twin crests of snow.  
He plunges in the wild to seek the cave;  
Three days unceasing sought young Zaidu brave,\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

And now at last within the glen he rode,  
And near approached Heabani's wild abode.  
At last he sees the seer before his home,  
And with his monster <span id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_118.md) now toward
him come,  
That walked subdued beside the hermit seer,  
Thus they upon the rocks above appear.

"Why art thou here in warrior's array?  
The hermit cries. "I know thee not! away!"

"O holy seer, 'tis Zaidu, from our Sar!  
The king of Erech, chieftain Izdubar."

"What seekest thou within my mountain lair?"  
Heabani angry cried. "What brings thee here?"

"For thee! if true Heabani is thy name;  
I seek the hermit seer of wondrous fame.  
My king doth offer thee rich gifts of state,  
And sent me to thee here to make thee great.  
No empty honors do I seek, which void  
Of all true happiness, all men have cloyed.  
Return then to thy haunts of pleasure, pain,  
For thy king's embassy is all in vain."  
The seer returns within his lonely cave  
And leaves the prince alone the beast to brave.  
At last it slinks away within the gloom;  
No more from their wild home doth either come,  
Three days Prince Zaidu watches the dark lair,  
But now his courage turns to blank despair:  
The seer hath changed his mind since Samas sought  
To urge him forth to leave his lonely lot.  
The prince the mountain precipice now climbs,  
And peers within while clinging to the limbs  
Of stunted oaks, and views the mountain lair;  
But all in vain his calls ring on the air.  
Then mounting wearily his steed he turns  
Away, and unsuccessful thus returns.
