### IZDUBAR FALLS IN LOVE WITH MUA, AND OFFERS HER HIS HAND

"O Mua! thou bright Waters of the Dawn!  
Oh, where art thou?" one cries as he doth run  
Through the bright garden. See! 'tis Izdubar!  
Immortal! glorious! our King of War!  
And now in love is seeking Mua here.  
He scarcely treads the ground as he comes near;  
A glow of youth immortal on his cheek,  
A form that sorrow, death, will never seek  
Within these Happy Fields, his eyes with light  
That Love alone may give, show his delight.

A dazzling pillared vista round him shines,  
Where golden columns bear the bowering shrines,  
With gemmèd domes that clustering round him rise,  
'Mid fruit-trees, flashing splendors to the skies.  
He goes through silver grots along a zone,  
And now he passes yonder blazing throne,  
O'er diamond pavements, passes shining seats  
Whereon the high and holy conclave meets  
To rule the empires vast that spread away  
To utmost bounds in all their vast array.  
Around the whole expanse grand cestes spread  
O'er paths sidereal unending lead.  
As circling wheels within a wheel they shine,  
Enveloping the Fields with light divine.  
A noontide glorious of shining stars,  
Where humming music rings from myriad cars,  
Where pinioned multitudes their harps may tune,  
And in their holy sanctity commune.

And see! here Mua comes! she stops and waits  
Within a *gesdin* bower beside its gates. .  
Around, above her spreads a flowering vine,  
And o'er a ruby fountain almandine.  
And on a graven garnet table grand,  
Carved cups of solid pearl and tilpe <span
id="fr_303"></span>[1](#fn_300) stand.  
A Zadu <span id="fr_304"></span>[2](#fn_301) reservoir stands near,
which rounds  
The fount wherein the fragrant nectar bounds.  
The ground is strewn with pari <span id="fr_305"></span>[3](#fn_302)
gems and pearls,  
Wherefrom the light now softly backward hurls  
Its rays o'er couches of paruti <span id="fr_306"></span>[4](#fn_303)
stone,  
Soft cushioned, circling in the inner zone  
Beside the shining kami-sadi way, <span
id="fr_307"></span>[5](#fn_304)  
Where nectar fountains in their splendor play.  
The path leads far along Life's beauteous stream,  
That ever through this World of joy doth gleam.

And see! the hero comes! and now doth near  
The maiden, where with Love she waits him here.  
She flings a flowering garland, weaves it round  
His form as he comes by! He turns around,  
And she enwraps his breast and arms, and says:

"Dear Izdubar! and thus my lover strays!  
I'll bind thee with this fragrant chain to keep  
Thee ever by my side! thy pleasant sleep  
Hath kept my lover from my side too long!"

"O thou sweet spirit, like a warbling song  
Thy words are to my heart! I sought for thee,  
And thy bright face and presence did not see;  
I come to tell thee that I must return,  
When from thy father all the past shall learn."

"And wilt thou go from me to earth again?  
No! no! dear Izdubar, I thee enchain!"

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

"'Tis true, my love, I must return to men;  
My duty calls me to my throne again."

"Dear Izdubar! my friend! my love! my heart!  
I cannot let thee from my soul depart!  
Thou shinest in my breast as some bright star!  
And shall I let thee from me go afar?"

"But Mua, we immortal are, and we  
There might return; and thou on earth shalt see  
The glories of my kingdom,--be my queen!  
Upon a couch I'll seat thee, there to reign  
With me, my beauteous queen,--beside me sit;  
And kings will come to us and kiss thy feet.  
With all my wealth I'll clothe thee, ever love  
Thee, fairest of these glorious souls that move  
Within this Happy World. My people there  
Shall love us,--ever drive away all care!"

When Mua heard him offer thus his hand,  
She then unbinds him,--thoughtful now doth stand.
