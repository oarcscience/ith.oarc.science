<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">IZDUBAR FALLS IN LOVE WITH MUA, AND OFFERS HER HIS HAND</H3>
<P>"O Mua! thou bright Waters of the Dawn!<BR>
Oh, where art thou?" one cries as he doth run<BR>
Through the bright garden. See! 'tis Izdubar!<BR>
Immortal! glorious! our King of War!<BR>
And now in love is seeking Mua here.<BR>
He scarcely treads the ground as he comes near;<BR>
A glow of youth immortal on his cheek,<BR>
A form that sorrow, death, will never seek<BR>
Within these Happy Fields, his eyes with light<BR>
That Love alone may give, show his delight.</P>
<P>A dazzling pillared vista round him shines,<BR>
Where golden columns bear the bowering shrines,<BR>
With gemm&egrave;d domes that clustering round him rise,<BR>
'Mid fruit-trees, flashing splendors to the skies.<BR>
He goes through silver grots along a zone,<BR>
And now he passes yonder blazing throne,<BR>
O'er diamond pavements, passes shining seats<BR>
Whereon the high and holy conclave meets<BR>
To rule the empires vast that spread away<BR>
To utmost bounds in all their vast array.<BR>
Around the whole expanse grand cestes spread<BR>
O'er paths sidereal unending lead.<BR>
As circling wheels within a wheel they shine,<BR>
Enveloping the Fields with light divine.<BR>
A noontide glorious of shining stars,<BR>
Where humming music rings from myriad cars,<BR>
Where pinioned multitudes their harps may tune,<BR>
And in their holy sanctity commune.</P>

<P>And see! here Mua comes! she stops and waits<BR>
Within a <I>gesdin</I> bower beside its gates. .<BR>
Around, above her spreads a flowering vine,<BR>
And o'er a ruby fountain almandine.<BR>
And on a graven garnet table grand,<BR>
Carved cups of solid pearl and tilpe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_303"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> stand.<BR>
A Zadu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> reservoir stands near, which rounds<BR>
The fount wherein the fragrant nectar bounds.<BR>
The ground is strewn with pari&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> gems and pearls,<BR>
Wherefrom the light now softly backward hurls<BR>
Its rays o'er couches of paruti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> stone,<BR>
Soft cushioned, circling in the inner zone<BR>
Beside the shining kami-sadi way,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><BR>
Where nectar fountains in their splendor play.<BR>
The path leads far along Life's beauteous stream,<BR>
That ever through this World of joy doth gleam.</P>
<P>And see! the hero comes! and now doth near<BR>
The maiden, where with Love she waits him here.<BR>
She flings a flowering garland, weaves it round<BR>
His form as he comes by! He turns around,<BR>
And she enwraps his breast and arms, and says:</P>
<P>"Dear Izdubar! and thus my lover strays!<BR>
I'll bind thee with this fragrant chain to keep<BR>
Thee ever by my side! thy pleasant sleep<BR>
Hath kept my lover from my side too long!"</P>
<P>"O thou sweet spirit, like a warbling song<BR>
Thy words are to my heart! I sought for thee,<BR>
And thy bright face and presence did not see;<BR>
I come to tell thee that I must return,<BR>
When from thy father all the past shall learn."</P>
<P>"And wilt thou go from me to earth again?<BR>
No! no! dear Izdubar, I thee enchain!"</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A></P>
<P>"'Tis true, my love, I must return to men;<BR>
My duty calls me to my throne again."</P>
<P>"Dear Izdubar! my friend! my love! my heart!<BR>
I cannot let thee from my soul depart!<BR>
Thou shinest in my breast as some bright star!<BR>
And shall I let thee from me go afar?"</P>
<P>"But Mua, we immortal are, and we<BR>
There might return; and thou on earth shalt see<BR>
The glories of my kingdom,--be my queen!<BR>
Upon a couch I'll seat thee, there to reign<BR>
With me, my beauteous queen,--beside me sit;<BR>
And kings will come to us and kiss thy feet.<BR>
With all my wealth I'll clothe thee, ever love<BR>
Thee, fairest of these glorious souls that move<BR>
Within this Happy World. My people there<BR>
Shall love us,--ever drive away all care!"</P>
<P>When Mua heard him offer thus his hand,<BR>
She then unbinds him,--thoughtful now doth stand.</P>
