<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE KING IS CURED BY THE INCANTATIONS OF KHASISADRA AND HE BECOMES IMMORTAL</H3>
<P>When Izdubar awakes, they lead the way<BR>
To the bright fount beside the jasper sea.<BR>
The seer, with Mua and Ur-Hea, stands<BR>
Beside the King, who holily lifts his hands<BR>
Above an altar where the glowing rays<BR>
Of sacred flames are curling; thus he prays:</P>
<P>"Ye glorious stars that shine on high,<BR>
Remember me! Oh, hear my cry,<BR>
Su-ku-nu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> bright Star of the West!<BR>
Dil-gan, my patron star, oh, shine!<BR>
O Mar-bu-du, whose rays invest<BR>
Dear Nipur&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with thy light divine,<BR>
The flames that shines, upon the Waste!<BR>
O Papsukul, thou Star of Hope,<BR>
Sweet god of bliss, to me, oh, haste,<BR>
Before I faint and lifeless drop!<BR>
O Adar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Star of Ninazu,<BR>
Be kind! O Ra-di-tar-tu-khu.<BR>
Sweet U-tu-ca-ga-bu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> dear Star<BR>
With thy pure face that shines afar!</P>
<P>Oh, pardon me! each glorious Star!<BR>
Za-ma-ma,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> hear me! O Za-ma-ma!<BR>
Ca-ca-ma u Ca-ca-ma."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></P>

<P>As Izdubar doth end his holy prayer<BR>
He kneels, and they now bear his body where<BR>
A snowy couch doth rest beneath a shrine<BR>
That stands near by the glowing fount divine,<BR>
And Khasisadra lifts his holy hands,<BR>
His incantation chants, and o'er him stands.</P>
<P>"O Bel, Lord of An-nu-na-ci,<BR>
O Nina, Hea's daughter! Zi!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A><BR>
This Incantation aid,<BR>
Remember us, Remember!</P>
<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> Ye tempests of High Heaven, be still!<BR>
Ye raging lightnings, oh, he calm!<BR>
From this brave man his strength is gone,<BR>
Before thee see him lying ill!<BR>
Oh, fill with strength his feeble frame,<BR>
O Ishtar, shine from thy bright throne!<BR>
From him thine anger turn away,<BR>
Come from thy glowing mountains, come!<BR>
From paths untrod by man, oh, haste!<BR>
And bid this man arise this day.<BR>
With strength divine as Heaven's dome,<BR>
His form make pure and bright and chaste!<BR>
The evil curse, oh, drive away!</P>
<P>Go! A-sac-cu-kab-bi-lu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> go!<BR>
O Nam-ta-ru-lim-nu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_291"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> oh, fly!<BR>
U-tuc-cu-lim-nu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> from him flow!<BR>
A-lu-u-lim-nu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_290"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> hence! away!<BR>
E-ci-mu-lim-nu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> go! thou fiend!<BR>
Fly, Gal-lu-u-lim-nu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> afar!<BR>
Fly from his head! his life! I send<BR>
Thee, fiend! depart from Izdubar!<BR>
Go from his forehead, breast, and heart,<BR>
And feet! Avaunt! thou fiend! depart!</P>

<P>Oh, from the Curse, Thou Spirit High!<BR>
And Spirit of the Earth, come nigh!<BR>
Protect him, may his spirit fly!<BR>
O Spirit of the Lord of Lands,<BR>
And Goddess of the Earthly Lands,<BR>
Protect him! raise with strength his hands!</P>
<P>Oh, make him as the Holy Gods,<BR>
His body, limbs, like thine Abodes,<BR>
And like the Heavens may he shine!<BR>
And like the Earth with rays divine!<BR>
Quick! with the khis-ib-ta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> to bring<BR>
High Heaven's Charm--bind round his brow!<BR>
The sis-bu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> place around his hands!<BR>
And let the sab-u-sat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_298"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> bright cling!<BR>
The mus-u-kat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_299"></A><A HREF="#fn_296"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> lay round him now,<BR>

And open now his zik-a-man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_301"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The sis-bu cover, and his hands<BR>
The bas-sat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_299"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> place around his form!<BR>
From baldness and disease, this man<BR>
Cleanse, make him whole, head, feet, and hands!</P>
<P>O Purity, breathe thy sweet charm!</P>
<P>Restore his health and make his skin<BR>
Shine beautifully, beard and hair<BR>
Restore! make strong with might his loins!<BR>
And may his body glorious shine<BR>
As the bright gods!--</P>

Immortal flesh to his soul joins!</P>

He stands immortal,--purged! released from clay!</P>

This is the deity for whom Izdubar or Nammurabi built the great temple whose top, in the language of the Babylonians, reached the skies. It was afterward called the "Tower of the Country" or "Tower of Babylon." This was perhaps the Tower of Babel. He also restored another temple called "Bite-muris," which was dedicated to the same goddess.</P>
