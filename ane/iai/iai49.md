### MUA'S ANSWER

Sweet Mua lifts her eyes toward the heights  
That glow afar beneath the softened lights  
That rest upon the mountain's crystalline.  
And see! they change their hues incarnadine  
To gold, and emerald, and opaline;  
Swift changing to a softened festucine  
Before the eye. And thus they change their hues  
To please the sight of every soul that views  
Them in that Land; but she heeds not the skies,  
Or glorious splendor of her home; her eves  
Have that far look of spirits viewing men  
On earth, from the invisible mane,  
That erstwhile rests upon the mortal eye,--  
A longing for that home beyond the sky;

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

A yearning for that bliss that love imparts,  
Where pain and sorrow reach no mortal hearts.

A light now breaks across her beauteous face;  
She, turning, says to him with Heavenly grace:

"Dear Izdubar, thou knowest how I love  
Thee, how my heart my love doth daily prove;  
And, oh, I cannot let thee go alone.  
I know not what awaits each soul there gone.  
Our spirits often leave this glorious land,  
Invisible return on earth, and stand  
Amidst its flowerets, 'neath its glorious skies.  
Thou knowest every spirit here oft flies  
From earth, but none its secrets to us tell,  
Lest some dark sorrow might here work its spell.  
And, oh, I could not see dark suffering, woe  
There spread, with power none to stop its flow!

I saw thee coming to us struck with fire,  
Oh, how to aid thee did my heart desire!  
Our tablets tell us how dread sorrow spreads  
Upon that world and mars its glowing meads.  
But, oh, so happy am I, here to know  
That they with us here end all sorrow, woe.  
O precious Izdubar! its sights would strike  
Me there with sadness, and my heart would break!  
And yet I learn that it is glorious, sweet!  
To there enjoy its happiness,--so fleet  
It speeds to sorrowing hearts to turn their tears  
To joy! How sweet to them when it appears,  
And sends a gleam of Heaven through their lives!

No! no! dear heart! I cannot go! It grieves  
Thee! come, my dear one! quick to us return;  
We here again will pair our love, and learn  
How sweet it is to meet with joy again;  
How happy will sweet love come to us then!"

She rests her head upon his breast, and lifts  
Her face for Love's sweet kiss, and from them drifts\[paragraph

A halo o'er the shining gesdin-trees  
And spreads around them Heaven's holy rays.  
He [kisses](errata.htm#1.md) her sweet lips, and brow, and eyes,  
Then turns his gaze toward the glowing skies:

"I bless thee, for thy sweetest spirit here!  
I bless this glorious land, that brings me near  
To one that wafts sweet Heaven in my heart;  
From thy dear plains how can my soul depart?  
O Mua, Mua! how my heart now sings!  
Thy love is sweeter than all earthly things!  
I would I were not crowned a king!--away  
From this bright land--here would I ever stay!  
As thou hast said, I soon will here return;  
The earth cannot withhold me from this bourne,  
And soon my time allotted there will end,  
And hitherward how happy I will wend!"

"And when thou goest, how my love shall there  
Guard thee, and keep thy heart with Mua here.  
Another kiss!"  
                  Her form doth disappear  
Within the garden, gliding through the air.  
He seats himself upon a couch and rests  
His head upon his hand, and thought invests  
Him round. His memory returns again  
To Erech's throne, and all the haunts of men.  
He rises, turns his footsteps to the halls,  
And thoughtful disappears within its walls.
