### THE GRIEF OF THE KING OVER THE LOSS OF HIS SEER, AND HIS PRAYER TO THE MOON-GOD, WHO ANSWERS HIS PRAYER WITH A VISION

The King weeps bitterly with flowing tears  
Above his seer when from him disappears  
The last faint breath; and then in deepest woe  
He cries: "And through that desert must I go?  
Heabani, thou to me wast like the gods;  
Oh, how I loved thee! must thou turn to clods?  
Through that dread desert must I ride alone;\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

And leave thee here, Heabani, lying prone?  
Alas, I leave thee in this awful place,  
To find our Khasisadra, seek his face,  
The son of Ubara-tutu, the seer;  
Oh, how can I, my friend, thus leave thee here?  
This night through those dark mountains I must go,  
I can no longer bear this awful woe:  
If I shall tarry here, I cannot sleep.  
O Sin, bright moon-god, of yon awful deep!  
I pray to thee upon my face, oh, hear  
My prayer! my supplications bring thou near  
To all the gods! grant thou to me,--e'en me,  
A heart of strength and will to worship thee.

Oh, is this death like that the seer hath dreamed?  
Perhaps the truth then on his spirit gleamed!  
If Land of Silver Sky is but a myth,  
The other dream is true! e'en all he saith!  
Oh, tell me, all ye sparkling stars,  
That wing above thy glorious flight,  
    And feel not Nature's jars;  
But grandly, sweetly fling thy light  
To our bright world beneath serene,  
    Hath mortals on thee known  
Or viewed beyond,--that great Unseen,  
Their future fate by gods been shown?

Oh, hear me, all ye gods on high!  
To gods who love mankind I pray,  
Despairing, oh, I cry!  
Oh, drive these doubts and fears away!  
And yet--and yet, what truths have we?  
O wondrous mortal, must thou die?  
Beyond this end thou canst not see,  
O Life! O Death! O mystery!

The body still is here, with feeling dead!  
And sight is gone!--and hearing from his dead,  
Nor taste, nor smell, nor warmth, nor breath of life!  
Where is my seer? Perhaps, his spirit rife

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

E'en now in nothingness doth wander lone!  
In agony his thoughts! with spirit prone!  
In dread despair!--If conscious then, O gods!  
He spake the truth!--His body to the clods  
Hath turned! By this we feel, or hear, or see,  
And when 'tis gone,--exist?--in agony!  
To Hades hath he gone? as he hath thought!  
Alas, the thought is torture, where have wrought  
The gods their fearful curse! Ah, let me think!  
The Silver Sky? Alas, its shining brink  
He hath not crossed. The wrathful gods deny  
Him entrance! Where, oh, where do spirits fly  
Whom gods have cursed? Alas, he is condemned  
To wander lone in that dark world, contemned  
And from the Light of Happy Fields is barred!  
Oh, why do gods thus send a fate so hard,  
And cruel? O dear moon-god, moon-god Sin!  
My seer hath erred. Receive his soul within  
To joys prepared for gods and men! Though seer  
He was, he immortality did fear,  
As some unknown awakening in space.  
Oh, turn upon him thy bright blessèd face!  
He was my friend! O moon-god, hear my prayer!  
Imploring thee, doth pray thine Izdubar!"

And lo! a vision breaks before his eyes!  
The moon-god hides the shadows of the skies,  
And sweeps above with his soft, soothing light  
That streams around his face; he drives the night  
Before his rays, and with his hands sweet peace  
He spreads through all the skies; and Strife doth cease!  
A girdle spans the Heavens with pure light  
That shines around the River of the Night,  
Within the circling rays a host appears!  
The singers of the skies, as blazing spheres!  
Hark! Hear their harps and lyres that sweetly sound!  
They sing! Oh, how the glowing skies resound!

"O King of Light and joy and Peace,  
    Supreme thy love shall ever reign;\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

Oh, can our songs of bliss here cease?  
    Our souls for joy cannot restrain,  
    Sweep! Sweep thy lyres again!

The former things <span id="fr_253"></span>[1a](#fn_250.md)--are passed
away,  
    Which we on earth once knew below;  
And in this bright eternal day  
    We happiness alone can know  
    Where bliss doth ever flow."
