<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CORONATION OF IZDUBAR</H3>
<P>A crowd of maidens led a glorious van;<BR>
With roses laden the fair heralds ran,<BR>
With silver-throated music chant the throng,<BR>
And sweetly sang the coronation song:<BR>
And now we see the gorgeous cavalcade,<BR>
Within the walls in Accad's grand parade<BR>
They pass, led by the maidens crowned with flowers,<BR>
Who strew the path with fragrance;--to the towers<BR>
And walls and pillars of each door bright cling<BR>
The garlands. Hear the maidens joyful sing!</P>
<P>"Oh, shout the cry! Accadians, joyful sing<BR>
For our Deliverer! Oh, crown him King!<BR>
Then strew his path with garlands, tulips, rose,<BR>
And wave his banners as he onward goes;<BR>
Our mighty Nin-rad comes, oh, raise the cry!<BR>
We crown Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Away to Samas' temple grand, away!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Accad crowns him, crowns him there!<BR>
He is our chosen Sar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> this glorious day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, send the Khanga&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> through the air!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then chant the chorus, all ye hosts above!<BR>
O daughters, mothers, sing for him we love!<BR>
His glory who can sing, who brings us joy?<BR>
For hope and gladness all our hearts employ.<BR>
He comes, our hope and strength in every war:<BR>
We crown him as our king, our Izdubar!</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Away to Samas' temple grand, away!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Accad crowns him, crowns him there!<BR>
He is our chosen Sar this glorious day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, send the Khanga through the air!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Toward the temple filed the long parade,<BR>
The nobles led while Accad's music played;</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A></P>
<P>The harps and timbrels, barsoms, drums and flutes<BR>
Unite with trumpets and the silver lutes.<BR>
Surrounded by his chieftains rides the Sar<BR>
In purple robes upon his brazen car.<BR>
Bedecked with garlands, steeds of whitest snow<BR>
The chariot draw in state with movement slow,<BR>
Each steed led by a <I>kisib</I>, nobleman,<BR>
A score of beauteous horses linked in span.<BR>
The army follows with their nodding plumes,<BR>
And burnished armor, trumpets, rolling drums,<BR>
And glistening spears enwreathed with fragrant flowers,<BR>
While scarfs are waving from the crowded towers.,<BR>
And shouts of joy their welcome loud proclaim,<BR>
And from each lip resounds their monarch's name.</P>
<P>And now before the holy temple stands<BR>
The chariot, in silence cease the bands.<BR>
Around an altar stand the waiting priests,<BR>
And held by them, the sacrificial beasts.<BR>
The hero from his chair descends,<BR>
And bowing to the priests, he lowly bends<BR>
Before the sacred altar of the Sun,<BR>
And prays to Samas, Accad's Holy One.</P><DIR>

<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>"O Samas, I invoke thee, throned on high!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the cedars' shadow bright thou art,<BR>
Thy footing rests upon immensity;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All nations eagerly would seek thy heart.<BR>
Their eyes have turned toward thee, O our Friend!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose brilliant light illuminates all lands,<BR>
Before thy coming all the nations bend,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, gather every people with thy hands!<BR>
For thou, O Samas, knowest boundaries<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every kingdom, falsehood dost destroy,<BR>
And every evil thought from sorceries<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wonders omens, dreams that do annoy,<BR>
And evil apparitions, thou dost turn<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To happy issue; malice, dark designs;</P></DIR>

<P>And men and countries in thy might o'erturn,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sorcery that every soul maligns.<BR>
Oh, in thy presence refuge let me find!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From those who spells invoke against thy King,<BR>
Protect one! and my heart within thine, oh, bind!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Thy breath within mine inmost soul, oh, bring!<BR>
That I with thee, O Samas, may rejoice.<BR>

Thy hands and lead me, make thy will my choice,<BR>

They servant, Lord of light of legions vast,<BR>

<P>The King then rises, takes the sacred glass,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A><BR>
And holds it in the sun before the mass<BR>
Of waiting fuel on the altar piled.<BR>
The centring rays--the fuel glowing gild<BR>
With a round spot of fire and quickly. spring<BR>
Above the altar curling, while they sing!</P><DIR>

O spirit of the earth, to thee we pray,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember! Us remember!</P>
<P>"O God of Fire! a lofty prince doth stand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A warrior, and son of the blue sea,<BR>
Before the God of Fire in thine own land,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before thy holy fires that from us free<BR>
Dread Darkness, where dark Nuk-khu reigns.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our prince, as monarch we proclaim,<BR>
