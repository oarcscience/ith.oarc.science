## COLUMN III

### IZDUBAR RELATES HIS SECOND DREAM TO HIS SEERS, WHO CANNOT INTERPRET IT

The counsellors assembled round the throne  
Within the council halls of *zam-at* <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md)
stone,  
Now greet their monarch, and behold his face  
With trouble written on his brow, and trace  
Uneasiness within that eagle eye,  
While be with stately tread, yet wearily  
Ills throne approached; he turned to the *mu-di*, <span
id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94.md)  
And swept a glance upon his khas-iz-i. <span
id="fr_95"></span>[3](#fn_95.md)  
Uneasy they all eyed his troubled face,  
For he had ridden at a furious pace.  
The *abuli* <span id="fr_96"></span>[4](#fn_96.md) had told them on that
morn,  
How he across the plains had wildly torn

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

To drive away some vision of the night.  
One asked, "Hath our Sardan-nu's dreams been light?  
Or hath dread phantoms o'er thy pillow hung?  
For trouble on thy countenance hath clung."  
The monarch startled at the question eyes  
The councillor, and to him thus replies:  
"'Tis true, my counsellors and wisest men,  
I dreamed a fearful dream Sat mu-si; <span id="fr_97"></span>[5](#fn_97.md)
when  
I have disclosed it, if one clear reveals  
Its meaning all and naught from me conceals,  
On him will I the greatest wealth bestow:  
I will ennoble him, and the *sib-zu* <span
id="fr_98"></span>[6](#fn_98.md)  
A *ku-bar-ra* <span id="fr_99"></span>[7](#fn_99.md) for him shall rich
prepare;  
As my *tur-tan-it* <span id="fr_100"></span>[8](#fn_100.md) he shall be,
and seer,  
Decked with a golden chain shall next preside  
At every feast, and break his bread beside  
The King, and highest rank he shall attain  
'Mong counsellors, and mine own favor gain;  
And seven wives to him I will allow,  
And a grand palace. This as King I vow,  
The scribe it shall enroll above my seal  
As Erech's Sar's decree beyond repeal.

I dreamed upon my *dum-khi* <span id="fr_101"></span>[9](#fn_101.md) fast
asleep,  
The stars from heaven fell from yonder deep  
To earth; and one, with fierceful heat my back  
Did pierce as molten fire, and left its track  
Of flames like some huge ball along my spine;  
And then transformed, it turned its face to mine;  
As some fierce god it glowed before my sight  
Till agony was lost in dread affright.  
I rooted stood, in terror, for its face  
Was horrible; I saw in its feet's place  
A lion's claws. It sprang, my strength it broke,  
And slew me, gloating over me! Awoke,  
I sprang, methought I was a corpse *ka-ra* <span
id="fr_102"></span>[10](#fn_102.md)

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

Va tat-ka mat sar, talka bit-la sha  
Ra-pas-ti sat-ti, ar-id-da! ka-ra,  
Va hal-li-ka! lik-ru-bu ki-mi-ta!  
The seers in silence stand, perplexed and think;  
But from the task at once the wisest shrink.  
The King each face soon read:  
                                    "Ye tell me no?"  
And nodding all, concealed from him their woe,  
For they beheld within the dream some fate  
Impending o'er him born of godly hate,  
And durst not to their monarch prate their fears,  
For flatterers of kings are all his seers.  
The King impatient eyed them all with scorn,  
And hid his thoughts by wildest passions born;  
And then at last contemptuous to them said,  
"So all my seers of trouble are afraid?  
Or else in ignorance you turn away;  
'Tis well! I sorely need a seer this day."  
And they now prostrate fall before his throne,  
"Forgive thy seers!" one cries, "O mighty One!  
For we this dreadful dream do fear portends  
Thy harm! a god some message to thee sends!  
We know not what, but fear for thee, our Sar,  
And none but one can augur it; afar  
He lives, Heabani should before the King  
Be brought from *Za-Ga-bri* <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103.md) the
*na-bu* <span id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_104.md) bring!"  
"'Tis well! Prince Zaidu for the hermit send,  
And soon this mystery your Sar will end."  
The King distressed now to the temple goes  
To lay before the mighty gods his woes;  
This prayer recites to drive away bad dreams,  
While Samas' holy altar brightly gleams:  
 <span id="fr_105"></span>[3](#fn_105.md)"O Samas! may my prayer bring me
sweet rest,  
And may my Lord his favor grant to me:  
Annihilate the things that me invest!

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

This day, O God! distressed, I cry to thee!  
O goddess! be thou gracious unto me,  
Receive my prayer, my sins forgive I pray:  
My wickedness and will arrayed 'gainst thee.  
Oh, pardon me! O God, be kind this day,  
My groaning may the seven winds destroy,  
Clothe me with deep humility! receive  
My prayers, as wingèd birds, oh, may they fly  
And fishes carry them, and rivers weave  
Them in the waters on to thee, O God!  
As creeping things of the vast desert, cry  
I unto thee outstretched on Erech's sod;  
And from the river's lowest depths I pray;  
My heart cause thou to shine like polished gold,  
Though food and drink of Nin-a-zu <span id="fr_106"></span>[4](#fn_106.md)
this day  
Be mine, while worms and death thy servant fold.  
Oh, from thine altar me support, protect,  
In low humility I pray, forgive!  
Feed me with joy, my dreams with grace direct;  
The dream I dreamed, oh favorable give  
To me its omen filled with happiness!  
May Mak-hir <span id="fr_107"></span>[5](#fn_107.md), god of dreams, my
couch invest!  
With visions of Bit-sag-gal my heart bless,  
The temple of the gods, of Nin, with rest  
Unbroken, and to Merodach I pray!  
The favoring one, to prosper me and mine:  
 <span id="fr_108"></span>[6](#fn_108.md)Oh, may thy entering exalted be!  
And thy divinity with glory shine,  
And may our city shine with glowing meads,  
And all my people praise thy glorious deeds."  
Now to Euphrates' banks the Sar and seers  
Their footsteps turn to pray into the ears  
Of Hea, <span id="fr_109"></span>[7](#fn_109.md) where, in white, a hand of
priests  
Drawn in a crescent, Izdubar invests.  
Now at the water's edge he leans, his hands

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

Dips in the waves, and pours upon the sands  
The sparkling drops, while all a hymn descant  
To Hea, thus the incantation chant:

"O chant our incantation to the waters pure,  
     Euphrates' waters flowing to the sea!  
Where Hea's holy face shines bright on every shore,  
     O Sabit! <span id="fr_110"></span>[8](#fn_110.md) of Timatu <span
id="fr_111"></span>[9](#fn_111.md) to ye  
We pray! may your bright waters glowing shine  
As Hea's face, and heaving breast divine!

"O Sabit, to your father Hea take our prayer!  
 And may Dao-ki-na, <span id="fr_112"></span>[10](#fn_112.md) your bright
mother, hear!  
 With joy, oh shine, as peaceful as the sleeping light,  
 O ever may your throbbing waves be bright.  
        O spirit of the Heaven, hear!  
           Remember us, Remember!  
        O spirit of the earth, come near!  
           Remember us, Remember!  
 O hear us, Hea! hear us, dear Dao-ki-na!  
 *Ca-ca-ma u ca-ca-ma u ca-ca-ma*!" <span
