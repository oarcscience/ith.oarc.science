## COLUMN II

### THE KING'S SECOND DREAM AND EARLY RIDE UPON SUMIR'S PLAIN, AND HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT ON THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES

The night is fleeing from the light of dawn,  
Which dimly falls upon the palace lawn;  
The King upon his royal *dum-khi* <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74)
sleeps,  
And to his couch again Queen Ishtar creeps.  
In spite his dream to dismal thoughts she turns,  
Her victim tosses, now with fever burns:  
He wildly starts, and from his *dum-khi* springs,  
While loud his voice throughout the palace rings:  
"Ho! vassals! haste to me! your King!" he cries,  
And stamping fiercely while, his passions rise.  
The *sukh-li* <span id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_75) and *masari* <span
id="fr_76"></span>[3](#fn_76) rush in:  
"What trouble, Sar? have foes here come within?  
Then searching around they in his chamber rush,  
And eagerly aside the curtains push.  
The King yet paces on the floor with strides  
That show the trouble of his mind, and chides  
Them all as laggards; "Soon the sun will rise:  
My steed prepared bring hence!" he turning cries.  
He mounts and gallops through the swinging gates,  
Nor for attendance of his vassals waits.  
Nor turns his face toward the *nam-za-khi*, <span
id="fr_77"></span>[4](#fn_77)  
Who quickly opened for the King to fly  
Without the gates; across the plains he rides  
Away unmindful where his steed he guides.  
The horse's hoofs resound upon the plain  
As the lone horseman with bewildered brain,  
To leave behind the phantoms of the night,  
Rides fiercely through the early morning light,  
Beyond the orange orchards, citron groves,  
'Mid feathery date-palms he reckless roves.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

The fields of yellow grain mid fig-trees flash  
Unseen, and prickly pears, pomegranates, dash  
In quick succession by, till the white foam  
From his steed's mouth and quiv'ring flanks doth come;  
Nor heeds the whitened flowing mane, but flies,  
While clouds of dust him follow, and arise  
Behind him o'er the road like black storm clouds,  
While Zu <span id="fr_78"></span>[5](#fn_78) the storm-bird onward
fiercely goads  
The seven <span id="fr_79"></span>[6](#fn_79) raven spirits of the
air,  
And Nus-ku <span id="fr_80"></span>[7](#fn_80) opens wide the fiery
glare  
Of pent-up lightnings for fierce Gibil's <span
id="fr_81"></span>[8](#fn_81) hand,  
Who hurls them forth at Nergal's <span id="fr_82"></span>[9](#fn_82)
stern command,  
And Rimmon <span id="fr_83"></span>[10](#fn_83) rides triumphant on the
air,  
And Ninazu <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84) for victims doth
prepare,  
The King rides from the road into the wild,  
Nor thought of danger, his stern features smiled  
As the worn steed from a huge lion shied,  
Which turning glanced at them and sprang aside;  
Now Zi-pis-au-ni <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_85) fly before the
King.  
And yellow leopards through the rushes spring.  
Upon Euphrates' banks his steed he reins,  
And views the rosy wilds of Sumir's plains.

He looked toward the east across the plain  
That stretched afar o'er brake and marshy fen,  
And clustering trees that marked the Tigris' course;  
And now beyond the plain o'er fields and moors,  
The mountain range of Zu <span id="fr_86"></span>[3](#fn_86) o'er Susa's
land  
Is glowing 'neath the touch of Samas' hand;  
For his bright face is rising in the east,  
And shifting clouds from sea and rising mist,  
The robes of purple, violet and gold,

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

With rosy tints the form of Samas fold.  
The tamarisk and scarlet mistletoe,  
With green acacias' golden summits glow,  
And citron, olives, myrtle, climbing vine,  
Arbutus, cypress, plane-tree rise divine;  
The emerald verdure, clad with brilliant lines,  
With rose-tree forests quaffs the morning dews..  
The King delighted bares his troubled brow,  
In Samas' golden rays doth holy bow.  
But see! a shadow steals along the ground!  
And trampling footsteps through the copses sound,  
And Izdubar, his hand placed on his sword,  
Loud cries:  
               "Who cometh o'er mine Erech's sward?"  
An armèd warrior before him springs;  
The King, dismounted, his bright weapon swings.  
"'Tis I, Prince Dib-bara, <span id="fr_87"></span>[4](#fn_87) Lord
Izdubar,  
And now at last alone we meet in war;  
My soldiers you o'erthrew upon the field,  
But here to Nuk-khu's <span id="fr_88"></span>[5](#fn_88) son thine arm
shall yield!  
The monarch eyes the warrior evil-born,  
And thus replies to him with bitter scorn:  
"And dost thou think that Samas' son shall die  
By a vile foe who from my host did fly?  
Or canst thou hope that sons of darkness may  
The Heaven-born of Light and glory slay?  
As well mayst hope to quench the god of fire,  
But thou shalt die if death from me desire."  
The giant forms a moment fiercely glared,  
And carefully advanced with weapons bared,  
Which flash in the bright rays like blades of fire,  
And now in parry meet with blazing ire.  
Each firmly stood and rained their ringing blows,  
And caught each stroke upon their blades, till glows  
The forest round with sparks of fire that flew  
Like blazing meteors from their weapons true;

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

And towering In their rage they cautious sprung  
Upon each, foiled, while the deep Suk-ha <span
id="fr_89"></span>[6](#fn_89) rung.  
At last the monarch struck a mighty blow,  
His foeman's shield of gold, his blade cleft through;  
And as the lightning swung again his sword,  
And struck the chieftain's blade upon the sward,  
A Sedu springs from out the tangled copse,  
And at his feet the sword still ringing drops.  
The King his sword placed at his foeman's throat  
And shouted:  
                "Hal-ca <span id="fr_90"></span>[7](#fn_90) to yon
waiting boat!  
Or I will send thy body down this stream!  
*Ca is-kab-bu! va kal-bu!* <span id="fr_91"></span>[8](#fn_91) whence
you came!  
The chief disarmed now slunk away surprised,  
And o'er the strength of Sar-dan-nu <span
id="fr_92"></span>[9](iai10.htm#fn_92) surmised.  
The King returns, and rides within the gate  
Of Erech, and the council entered late.
