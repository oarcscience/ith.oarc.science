<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HEABANI REVEALS TWO WONDERFUL VISIONS TO THE KING, ONE OF DEATH AND OBLIVION, AND THE OTHER OF HEAVEN, AND DIES IN THE ARMS OF THE KING</H3>
<P>But, oh, my King! to thee I now reveal<BR>
A secret that my heart would yet conceal,<BR>
To thee, my friend, two visions I reveal:<BR>
The first I oft have dreamed beneath some spell<BR>
Of night, when I enwrapped from all the world,<BR>
With Self alone communed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconscious hurled<BR>
By wing&egrave;d thought beyond this present life,<BR>
I seeming woke in a Dark World where rife<BR>
Was Nothingness,--a darksome mist it seemed,<BR>
All eke was naught;--no light for me there gleamed;<BR>
And floating 'lone, which way I turned, saw naught;<BR>
Nor felt of substance 'neath my feet, nor fraught<BR>
With light was Space around; nor cheerful ray<BR>
Of single star. The sun was quenched; or day<BR>
Or night, knew not. No hands had I, nor feet,<BR>
Nor head, nor body, all was void. No heat<BR>
Or cold I felt, no form could feel or see;<BR>
And naught I knew but conscious entity.<BR>
No boundary my being felt, or had;<BR>
And speechless, deaf, and blind, and formless, sad,<BR>
I floated through dark space,--a conscious blank!<BR>
No breath of air my spirit moved; I sank<BR>
I knew not where, till motionless I ceased<BR>
At last to move, and yet I could not rest,<BR>
Around me spread the Limitless, and Vast.<BR>
My cheerless, conscious spirit,--fixed and fast<BR>
In some lone spot in space was moveless, stark!<BR>
An atom chained by forces stern and dark,<BR>
With naught around me. Comfortless I lived<BR>
In my dread loneliness! Oh, how I grieved!<BR>
And thus, man's fate in Life and Death is solved<BR>
With naught but consciousness, and thus involved</P>
<P><A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></P>
<P>All men in hopes that no fruition have?<BR>
And this alone was all that death me gave?<BR>
That all had vanished, gone from me that life<BR>
Could give, and left me but a blank, with strife<BR>
Of rising thoughts, and vain regrets, to float;--<BR>
Away from life and light, be chained remote!</P>
<P>Oh, how my spirit longed for some lone crag<BR>
To part the gloom beneath, and rudely drag<BR>
My senses back! or with its shock to end<BR>
My dire existence;--to oblivion send<BR>
Me quickly! How I strove to curse, and break<BR>
That soundless Void, with shrieks or cries, to wake<BR>
That awful silence which around me spread!<BR>
In vain! in vain! all but my soul was dead.<BR>
And then my spirit soundless cried within:<BR>
"Oh, take me! take me back to Earth again!"<BR>
For tortures of the flesh were bliss and joy<BR>
To such existence! Pain can never cloy<BR>
The smallest thrill of earthly happiness!<BR>
'Twas joy to live on earth in pain! I'll bless<BR>
Thee, gods, if I may see its fields I've trod<BR>
To kiss its fragrant flowers, and clasp the sod<BR>
Of mother Earth, that grand and beauteous world!<BR>
From all its happiness, alas! was hurled<BR>
My spirit,--then in frenzy--I awoke!<BR>
Great Bel! a dream it was! as vanished smoke<BR>
It sped! and I sprang from my couch and prayed<BR>
To all the gods, and thus my soul allayed.<BR>
And then with blessings on my lips, I sought<BR>
My couch, and dropped away in blissful thought<BR>
In dream the second:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Silver Sky<BR>
Came to me. Near the Stream of Life I lie:<BR>
My couch the rarest flowers; and music thrills<BR>
My soul! How soft and sweet it sounds from rills<BR>
And streams, and feathered songsters in the trees<BR>
Of Heaven's fruits!--e'en all that here doth please<BR>
The heart of man was there. In a dear spot<BR>
I lay, 'mid olives, spices, where was wrought<FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A></P>
<P>A beauteous grotto; and beside me near,<BR>
Were friends I loved; and one both near and dear<BR>
With me reclined, in blissful converse, sweet<BR>
With tender thoughts.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our joy was lull, complete!<BR>
The ministering spirits there had spread<BR>
Before us all a banquet on the mead,<BR>
With Heaven's food and nectar for our feast;<BR>
And oh, so happy! How our joy increased<BR>
As moments flew, to years without an end!<BR>
To Courts Refulgent there we oft did wend.</P>
<P>Beside a silver lake, a holy fane<BR>
There stood within the centre of the plain,<BR>
High built on terraces, with walls of gold,<BR>
Where palaces and mansions there enfold<BR>
A temple of the gods, that stands within<BR>
'Mid feathery palms and <I>gesdin</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> bowers green,<BR>
The city rises to a dizzy height,<BR>
With jewelled turrets flashing in the light,<BR>
Grand mansions piled on mansions rising high<BR>
Until the glowing summits reach the sky.<BR>
A cloud of myriad wings, e'er fills the sky,<BR>
As doves around their nests on earth here fly;<BR>
The countless millions of the souls on earth,<BR>
The gods have brought to light from mortal birth,<BR>
Are carried there from the dark world of doom;<BR>
For countless numbers more there still is room.<BR>
Through trailing vines my Love and I oft wind,<BR>
With arms of love around each other twined.<BR>
This day, we passed along the Stream of Life,<BR>
Through blooming gardens, with sweet odors rife;<BR>
Beneath the ever-ripening fruits we walk,<BR>
Along dear paths, and sweetly sing, or talk,<BR>
While warbling birds around us fly in view,<BR>
From bloom to bloom with wings of every hue;<BR>
And large-eyed deer, no longer wild, us pass,<BR>
With young gazelles, and kiss each other's face.<BR>
We now have reached the stately stairs of gold,<BR>
The city of the gods, here built of old.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A></P>
<P>The pearl&egrave;d pillars rise inlaid divine,<BR>
With lotus delicately traced with vine<BR>
In gold and diamonds, pearls, and unknown gems,<BR>
That wind to capital with blooming stems<BR>
Of lilies, honeysuckles, and the rose.<BR>
An avenue of columns in long rows<BR>
Of varied splendor, leads to shining courts<BR>
Where skilful spirit hands with perfect arts<BR>
Have chiselled glorious forms magnificent,<BR>
With ornate skill and sweet embellishment.<BR>
Their golden sculpture view on every hand,<BR>
Or carv&egrave;d images in pearl that stand<BR>
In clusters on the floor, or in long rows;<BR>
And on the walls of purest pearl there glows<BR>
The painting of each act of kindest deed<BR>
Each soul performs on earth;--is there portrayed.</P>
<P>The scenes of tenderness and holy love,<BR>
There stand and never end, but onward move,<BR>
And fill the galleries of Heaven with joy,<BR>
And ever spirit artist hands employ.<BR>
The holiest deeds are carved in purest gold,<BR>
Or richest gems, and there are stored of old;<BR>
Within the inner court a fountain stood,<BR>
Of purest diamond moulded, whence there flowed<BR>
Into a golden chalice,--trickling cool,<BR>
The nectar of the gods,--a sparkling pool,<BR>
That murmuring sank beneath an emerald vase<BR>
That rested underneath;--the fountain's base.</P>
<P>We entered then an arcade arching long<BR>
Through saph'rine galleries, and heard the song<BR>
That swelling came from temples hyaline;<BR>
And passed through lazite courts and halls divine,<BR>
While dazzling glories brighter round us shone.<BR>
How sweet then came the strains! with grander tone!<BR>
And, oh, my King! I reached the gates of pearl<BR>
That stood ajar, and heard the joyous whirl<BR>
That thrilled the sounding domes and lofty halls,<BR>
And echoed from the shining jasper walls.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A></P>
<P>I stood within the gate, and, oh, my friend,<BR>
Before that holy sight I prone did bend,<BR>
And hid my face upon the jacinth stairs.<BR>
A shining god raised me, and bade my fears<BR>
Be flown, and I beheld the glorious throne<BR>
Of crystaled light; with rays by man unknown.<BR>
The awful god there sat with brows sublime,<BR>
With robes of woven gold, and diadem<BR>
That beamed with blazing splendor o'er his head.<BR>
I thus beheld the god with presence dread,<BR>
The King of Kings, the Ancient of the Days,<BR>
While music rose around with joyous praise.<BR>
With awful thunders how they all rejoice!<BR>
And sing aloud with one commingled voice!</P>
<P>What happiness it was to me, my King!<BR>
From bower to temple I went oft to sing,<BR>
Or spread my wings above the mount divine,<BR>
And viewed the fields from heights cerulean.<BR>
Those songs still linger on dear memory's ear,<BR>
And tireless rest upon me, ever cheer.<BR>
But from the Happy Fields, alas! I woke,<BR>
And from my sight the Heavenly vision broke;<BR>
But, oh, my King, it all was but a dream!<BR>
I hope the truth is such, as it did seem<BR>
If it is true that such a Heavenly Land<BR>
Exists with happiness so glorious, grand,<BR>
Within that haven I would happy be!<BR>
But it, alas! is now denied to me.<BR>
For, oh, my King, to Hades I must go,<BR>
My wings unfold to fly to Realms of Woe;<BR>
In darkness to that other world unknown,<BR>
Alas! from joyous earth my life has flown.</P>
<P>Farewell, my King, my love thou knowest well;<BR>
I go the road; in Hades soon shall dwell;<BR>
To dwelling of the god Irkalla fierce,<BR>
To walls where light for me can never pierce,<BR>
The road from which no soul may e'er return,<BR>
Where dust shall wrap me round, my body urn,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></P>
<P>Where sateless ravens float upon the air,<BR>
Where light is never seen, or enters there,<BR>
Where I in darkness shall be crowned with gloom;<BR>
With crown&egrave;d heads of earth who there shall come<BR>
To reign with Anu's favor or great Bel's,<BR>
Then sceptreless are chained in their dark cells<BR>
With naught to drink but Hades' waters there,<BR>
And dream of all the past with blank despair.<BR>
Within that world, I too shall ceaseless moan,<BR>
Where dwell the lord and the unconquered one,<BR>
And seers and great men dwell within that deep,<BR>
With dragons of those realms we all shall sleep;<BR>
Where King Etana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and god Ner doth reign<BR>
With Allat, the dark Under-World's great queen,<BR>
Who reigns o'er all within her regions lone,<BR>
The Mistress of the Fields, her mother, prone<BR>
Before her falls, and none her face withstands<BR>
But I will her approach, and take her hands,<BR>
And she will comfort me in my dread woe.<BR>
Alas! through yonder void I now must go!<BR>
My hands I spread! as birds with wings I fly!<BR>
Descend! descend! beneath that awful sky!<BR>
The seer falls in the arms of Izdubar,<BR>
And he is gone;--'tis clay remaineth here,</P>
<P>
