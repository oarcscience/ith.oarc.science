## COLUMN VI

### IZDUBAR SLAYS THE MIDANNU IN THE FESTIVE HALL, AND HEABANI DECLARES HIM TO BE A GOD

The guests are seated round the festal board;  
Heabani takes his seat beside his lord.  
The choicest viands of the wealthy plain  
Before them placed and fishes of the main,  
With wines and cordials, juices rich and rare  
The chieftains all enjoy--the royal fare.  
This day, with Izdubar they laugh and joke  
'Mid courtesies and mirth, and oft provoke  
The ringing merry laughter through the halls.  
When all are satisfied within the walls,  
Their fill have eaten of the royal fare,  
With wine they banish from them every care.

The Su-khu-li <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166.md) with tinkling bells
proclaim,  
"Our Sar would speak! Our king of mighty fame."  
Who says: "My chieftains, lords, our seer requests  
A test of strength before assembled guests;  
Unarmed requires your Sar-dan-nu to slay  
The Mid-an-nu <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_167.md) which he hath
brought to-day.  
So stand aside, my friends, behold the test!  
Your Sar will satisfy his seer and guest."  
The monster now is brought before the king,  
Heabani him unchains to let him spring  
Upon the giant king. His chieftains stand  
In terror looking at their monarch grand,  
Who smiling stands, his eyes on the beast fixed;  
While they in wildest terror are transfixed.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

Heabani claps his hands towards the king,  
And the wild beast upon his form doth spring.  
The giant grasps its throat in high mid-air,  
 <span id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_168.md) And holds it 'neath his arm
without a fear.  
With sullen choking roars it struggling dies,  
While shouts of joy from all the guests arise.  
The mighty deed of strength the seer appals,  
And at the feet of Izdubar he falls:  
"Immortal king! illustrious of men!  
Thy glorious strength reveals the gods again  
On earth. To thee I bow in reverent fear,  
A god returned thou art! O Erech, hear!  
Of kingdoms thou art blessed with grandest fame,  
That thou among thy kings a god can name."  
Again they gathered round the festal board,  
And joy and revelry they soon restored.  
The revels high are raised o'er sparkling wine;  
Through all the night they praise their king divine.
