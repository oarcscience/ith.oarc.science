## COLUMN IV

### THE KING IS CURED BY THE INCANTATIONS OF KHASISADRA AND HE BECOMES IMMORTAL

When Izdubar awakes, they lead the way  
To the bright fount beside the jasper sea.  
The seer, with Mua and Ur-Hea, stands  
Beside the King, who holily lifts his hands  
Above an altar where the glowing rays  
Of sacred flames are curling; thus he prays:

"Ye glorious stars that shine on high,  
Remember me! Oh, hear my cry,  
Su-ku-nu, <span id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_278.md) bright Star of the
West!  
Dil-gan, my patron star, oh, shine!  
O Mar-bu-du, whose rays invest  
Dear Nipur <span id="fr_282"></span>[2](#fn_279.md) with thy light
divine,  
The flames that shines, upon the Waste!  
O Papsukul, thou Star of Hope,  
Sweet god of bliss, to me, oh, haste,  
Before I faint and lifeless drop!  
O Adar <span id="fr_283"></span>[3](#fn_280.md) Star of Ninazu,  
Be kind! O Ra-di-tar-tu-khu.  
Sweet U-tu-ca-ga-bu, <span id="fr_284"></span>[4](#fn_281.md) dear Star  
With thy pure face that shines afar!

Oh, pardon me! each glorious Star!  
Za-ma-ma, <span id="fr_285"></span>[5](#fn_282.md) hear me! O Za-ma-ma!  
Ca-ca-ma u Ca-ca-ma." <span id="fr_286"></span>[6](#fn_283.md)

 <span id="fr_287"></span>[7](#fn_284.md) Remember him! O dear Za-ma-ma!  
Ca-ca-ma u Ca-ca-ma."

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

As Izdubar doth end his holy prayer  
He kneels, and they now bear his body where  
A snowy couch doth rest beneath a shrine  
That stands near by the glowing fount divine,  
And Khasisadra lifts his holy hands,  
His incantation chants, and o'er him stands.

"O Bel, Lord of An-nu-na-ci,  
O Nina, Hea's daughter! Zi! <span id="fr_288"></span>[8](#fn_285.md)  
This Incantation aid,  
Remember us, Remember!

 <span id="fr_289"></span>[9](#fn_286.md) Ye tempests of High Heaven, be
still!  
Ye raging lightnings, oh, he calm!  
From this brave man his strength is gone,  
Before thee see him lying ill!  
Oh, fill with strength his feeble frame,  
O Ishtar, shine from thy bright throne!  
From him thine anger turn away,  
Come from thy glowing mountains, come!  
From paths untrod by man, oh, haste!  
And bid this man arise this day.  
With strength divine as Heaven's dome,  
His form make pure and bright and chaste!  
The evil curse, oh, drive away!

Go! A-sac-cu-kab-bi-lu, <span id="fr_290"></span>[10](#fn_287.md) go!  
O Nam-ta-ru-lim-nu, <span id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_288.md) oh, fly!  
U-tuc-cu-lim-nu <span id="fr_292"></span>[2](#fn_289.md) from him flow!  
A-lu-u-lim-nu, <span id="fr_293"></span>[3](#fn_290.md) hence! away!  
E-ci-mu-lim-nu, <span id="fr_294"></span>[4](#fn_291.md) go! thou fiend!  
Fly, Gal-lu-u-lim-nu, <span id="fr_295"></span>[5](#fn_292.md) afar!  
Fly from his head! his life! I send  
Thee, fiend! depart from Izdubar!  
Go from his forehead, breast, and heart,  
And feet! Avaunt! thou fiend! depart!

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

Oh, from the Curse, Thou Spirit High!  
And Spirit of the Earth, come nigh!  
Protect him, may his spirit fly!  
O Spirit of the Lord of Lands,  
And Goddess of the Earthly Lands,  
Protect him! raise with strength his hands!

Oh, make him as the Holy Gods,  
His body, limbs, like thine Abodes,  
And like the Heavens may he shine!  
And like the Earth with rays divine!  
Quick! with the khis-ib-ta <span id="fr_296"></span>[6](#fn_293.md) to
bring  
High Heaven's Charm--bind round his brow!  
The sis-bu <span id="fr_297"></span>[7](#fn_294.md) place around his
hands!  
And let the sab-u-sat <span id="fr_298"></span>[8](#fn_295.md) bright
cling!  
The mus-u-kat <span id="fr_299"></span>[9](#fn_296.md) lay round him now,  
And wrap his feet with rad-bat-bands, <span
id="fr_300"></span>[10](#fn_297.md)  
And open now his zik-a-man <span id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_298.md)  
The sis-bu cover, and his hands  
The bas-sat <span id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_299.md) place around his
form!  
From baldness and disease, this man  
Cleanse, make him whole, head, feet, and hands!

O Purity, breathe thy sweet charm!

Restore his health and make his skin  
Shine beautifully, beard and hair  
Restore! make strong with might his loins!  
And may his body glorious shine  
As the bright gods!--

                         Ye winds him bear!  
Immortal flesh to his soul joins!

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

Thou Spirit of this man! arise!  
Come forth with joy! Come to the skies!"

And lo! his leprosy has fled away!  
He stands immortal,--purged! released from clay!

great temple whose top, in the language of the Babylonians, reached the
skies. It was afterward called the "Tower of the Country" or "Tower of
Babylon." This was perhaps the Tower of Babel. He also restored another
temple called "Bite-muris," which was dedicated to the same goddess.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[151:10](iai47.htm#fr_300.md) "Rad-bat-bands,"
similar bands to the khis-ib-ta.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[151:1](iai47.htm#fr_301.md) "Zik-a-man," this is
unknown, it perhaps was the inner garment.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[151:2](iai47.htm#fr_302.md) "Bas-sat," supposed
to be the outside or last covering placed over the person so treated.
That some such ceremony was performed in the case of Izdubar seems to be
undoubted. See "Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch.," vol., ii. 31; also Sayce's
edition "C. A. of G," p. 290.
