## TABLET VII--COLUMN I

### THE KING AND SEER CONVERSING ON THEIR WAY TO KHASISADRA--INTERPRETATION OF THE KING'S DREAM IN THE PALACE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FESTIVAL

"The dream, my seer, which I beheld last night  
Within our tent, may bring to us delight.  
I saw a mountain summit flash with fire,  
That like a royal robe or god's attire  
Illumined all its sides. The omen might  
Some joy us bring, for it was shining bright."  
And thus the Sar revealed to him his dream.

Heabani said, "My friend, though it did seem  
Propitious, yet, deceptive was it all,  
And came in memory of Elam's fall.  
The mountain burning was Khumbaba's halls  
We fired, when all his soldiers from the walls  
Had fled;--the *ni-takh-garri*, <span
id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_239.md)--on that morn,  
Of such deceptive dreams, I would thee warn!"

Some twenty *kaspu* they have passed this day,  
At thirty *kaspu* they dismount to pray  
And raise an altar, Samas to beseech  
That they their journey's end may safely reach.  
The tent now raised, their evening meal prepare  
Beneath the forest in the open air;  
And Izdubar brought from the tent the dream  
He dreamed the festal night when Ishtar came  
To him;--he reads it from a written scroll:  
"Upon my sight a vision thus did fall:  
I saw two men that night beside a god;  
One man a turban wore, and fearless trod.  
The god reached forth his hand and struck him down  
Like mountains hurled on fields of corn, thus prone

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

He lay; and Izdubar then saw the god  
Was Anatu, <span id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_240.md) who struck him to the
sod.  
The troubler of all men, Samu's fierce queen,  
Thus struck the turbaned man upon the plain.  
He ceased his struggling, to his friend thus said:  
'My friend, thou askest not why I am laid  
Here naked, nor my low condition heed.  
Accursèd thus I lie upon the mead;  
The god has crushed me, burned my limbs with fire.'

The vision from mine eyes did then expire.  
A third dream came to me, which I yet fear,  
The first beyond my sight doth disappear.  
A fire-god thundering o'er the earth doth ride;  
The door of darkness burning flew aside;  
Like a fierce stream of lightning, blazing fire,  
Beside me roared the god with fury dire,  
And hurled wide death on earth on every side;  
And quickly from my sight it thus did glide,  
And in its track I saw a palm-tree green  
Upon a waste, naught else by me was seen."

Heabani pondering, thus explained the dream:  
"My friend, the god was Samas, who doth gleam  
With his bright glory, power, our God and Lord,  
Our great Creator King, whose thunders roared  
By thee, as through yon sky he takes his way;  
For his great favor we should ever pray.  
The man thou sawest lying on the plain  
Was thee, O King,--to fight such power is vain.  
Thus Anatu will strike thee with disease,  
Unless thou soon her anger shalt appease;  
And if thou warrest with such foes divine,  
The fires of death shall o'er thy kingdom shine.  
The palm-tree green upon the desert left  
Doth show that we of hope are not bereft;  
The gods for us their shares have surely weft, <span
id="fr_244"></span>[3](#fn_241.md)  
One shall be taken, and the other left."
