### FESTIVAL IN HONOR OF HEABANI, WHO ARRIVES AT ERECH--INTERPRETATION OF THE DREAM

The sounds of wild rejoicing now arise;  
"Heabani comes!" resound the joyful cries,  
And through the gates of Erech Suburi  
Now file the chieftains, Su-khu-li rubi. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_162.md)  
A festival in honor of their guest  
The Sar proclaims, and Erech gaily drest,  
Her welcome warm extends to the famed seer.  
The maidens, Erech's daughters, now appear,  
With richest kirtles gaily decked with flowers,  
And on his head they rain their rosy showers.  
Rejoicing sing, while harps and cymbals play,  
And laud him to the skies in their sweet way;  
And mingling with their joy, their monarch rode  
Before the seer, who stately after strode  
Beside his beast, and next the men of fame.  
The maids thus chant high honors to his name:

"A prince we make thee, mighty seer!  
Be filled with joy and royal cheer!  
          All hail to Erech's seer!

Whom day and night our Sar hath sought,  
O banish fear! for Hea taught  
          The seer, his glory wrought.

He comes! whom Samas loves as gold,  
To Erech grace, our city old;  
          All wisdom he doth hold.

Great Hea doth to him unfold  
All that remains to man untold;  
          Give him the chain of gold!

He cometh from the Za-Gab-ri  
To our dear Erech Su-bu-ri.  
          Heabani glorify!

Thy dream he will reveal, O Sar!  
Its meaning show to Izdubar,  
          Victorious king of war."

Within the council halls now lead the seers  
With trepidation and with many fears,  
To hear the seer explain their monarch's dream.  
Beside the royal throne he sits supreme  
Among the seers, the Sar, his scribe commands  
To read his dream recorded as it stands  
In Erech's Gi; <span id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_163.md) who reads it to the
seer,  
Who answers thus:  
                       "In this there doth appear  
A god, whose ardent love will lead to deeds  
Of hate against thee, Sar; thy present needs  
Are great, O king! as fire this love will burn  
Until the wicked seven <span id="fr_164"></span>[3](#fn_164.md) on thee
turn;  
And blood, alone, will not their fury sate:  
The gods will hurl upon thee some dread fate."  
In silence, Izdubar the warning heard;  
His blood with terror froze, and then was stirred  
By passions wild, when he recalled the scene  
Of Ishtar's love for him by man unseen;  
When she so wildly then proclaimed her love;  
And now with hate his utmost soul doth move,  
And her bright form to a black dal-khu <span
id="fr_165"></span>[4](#fn_165.md) turned  
And furious passions on his features burned.  
And then of the first dream he thought, and light  
Across his vision broke:  
                           "'Tis true! aright  
Thy seer hath read! for Ishtar came to me  
In the first dream, her face e'en yet I see!  
Aye, more! her lips to mine again then fell!  
Her arms I felt around me,--breath too well  
I know! of fragrance, while perfume arose  
Around my dream and fled not at the close;  
As frankincense and myrrh it lingered, when  
I woke. Ah yes! the queen will come again!"

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

Then to his counsellor who wondering stood,  
Nor heard his murmuring, but saw subdued  
His features were, at first, and then, they grand  
Became with settled hate; he raised his hand;  
"'Tis true!" he said, "Reward oil him bestow!  
Then to the waiting feast we all shall go."
