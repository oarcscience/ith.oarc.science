## TABLET VIII-COLUMN I

### THE KING'S ADVENTURE AT THE GATE OF THE GARDEN OF THE GODS WITH THE TWO MAIDENS--ONE OF THEM LEADS HIM INTO THE HAPPY HALLS--SONGS OF THE SABITU AND ZI-SI.

A gate half opened shows the silvery sea  
Yet distant shining lambent on his way.  
And now he sees young Siduri, <span id="fr_262"></span>[1](#fn_259)
whose breast  
Infuses life; all nature she hath blest,  
Whose lips are flames, her arms are walls of fire,  
Whose love yields pleasures that can never tire,  
She to the souls who joy on earth here miss,  
Grants them above a holier, purer bliss.  
The maiden sits within a holy shrine  
Beside the gate with lustrous eyes divine,  
And beckons to the King, who nearer comes,  
And near her glows the Happy Palace domes.

And lo! 'tis she his lips have fondly kissed  
Within the garden, when like fleeing mist  
She disappeared with the bright spirit Seven, <span
id="fr_263"></span>[2](#fn_260)  
The Sabit, who oft glide from earth to Heaven.  
And lo I one of the Seven, Sabitu,  
Emerging from the gate doth jealous view  
The coming hero who hath kissed her mate,  
She angry springs within to close the gate,  
And bars it, enters then the inner halls,  
And Izdubar to her now loudly calls,  
"O Sabitu! what see-est thou, my maid?  
Of Izdubar is Sabitu afraid?  
Thy gate thou barrest thus before my face.  
Quick, open for me! or I'll force the brass!"  
The maid now frightened opens wide the door.

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

The Sar and Siduri now tread the floor  
Of the bright palace where sweet joy doth reign.  
Through crystal halls 'neath golden roofs the twain  
Next go within a lofty ceilinged hall,  
With shining pearlèd columns, golden wall,  
And purple silken hangings at each door,  
With precious gems inlaid upon the floor;  
Where couches grand are spread for one to rest  
Beneath the softened rays that sweet invest  
The senses with a thrill of happiness;  
Where Siduri with joy all souls doth bless.  
The maid sits on a couch and turns her face  
Toward the King with that immortal grace  
That love to gods and men will e'er bestow.  
Their eyes now mingling with a happy glow,  
The maiden sweetly says: "Where wouldst thou go?  
Within these Happy Halls we joy but know,  
And if thou wilt, my King, my heart is thine!  
Our love will ever bring us bliss divine."

"Alas, my maid, thy love to me is dear,  
And sad am I that I must go from here.  
I came from Erech by advice from one  
I loved more than thou canst e'er know, but gone  
From me is my Heabani, faithful seer.  
Across a desert waste have I come here,  
And he has there to dust returned,--to dust--  
O how the love of my friend I did trust!  
I would that we had never started here,  
I now must find the great immortal seer."

The maiden turns her glowing eyes on him,  
Replies: "My King, thou knowest joy may gleam,  
Take courage, weary heart, and sing a song!  
The hour of sorrow can never be long;  
The day will break, and flood thy soul with joy,  
And happiness thy heart will then employ!  
Each day must end with all its sorrow, woe,  
Oh, sing with me, dear heart! I love thee so!"  
And lo! the curtains flung aside, now comes

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

The joyous Sabitu from yonder rooms,  
And gathering round, a song they gayly sing,  
Oh, how with music the bright walls now ring!  
If evil thou hast done, my King,

        Oh, pray! oh, pray!  
And to the gods thy offerings bring,  
        And pray! and pray!  
The sea is roaring at thy feet,  
The storms are coming, rain and sleet;  
        To all the gods,  
Oh, pray to them I oh, pray!

Chorus

        To all the gods,  
Oh, pray to them! oh, pray!

Thy city we will bless, O Sar!  
        With joy, with joy!  
And prosper thee in peace and war  
        With joy, with joy!  
And bless thee every day and night,  
Thy kingly robes keep pure and bright;  
        Give thee bright dreams,  
O glorious king of war!

Chorus

        Give thee bright dreams,  
O glorious king of war!

And if thy hand would slay thy foes  
        In war, in war!  
With thee returning victory goes  
        In war, in war!  
We grant thee victory, my King;  
Like marshes swept by storms, we bring  
        Our power to thee  
With victory in war!

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Chorus

        Our power to thee  
With victory in war!

And if thou wouldst the waters pass,  
        The sea, the sea!  
We'll go with thee in every place,  
        With thee, with thee!  
To Hea's halls and glorious throne,  
Where he unrivalled reigns alone,  
        To Hea go  
Upon his throne of snow.

Chorus

        To Hea go  
Upon his throne of snow.

And if thine anger rules thy heart  
        As fire, as fire!  
And thou against thy foes would start  
        With ire, with ire!  
Against thy foes thy heart be hard,  
And all their land with fire be scarred,  
        Destroy thy foes!  
Destroy them in thine ire!

Chorus

        Destroy thy foes!  
Destroy them in thine ire!

And lo! young Siduri hath disappeared,  
And with the Zisi crowned she now appeared;  
The corn-gods in a crescent round their queen,  
She waves before the king her Nusku <span
id="fr_264"></span>[3](#fn_261) green,  
And sings with her sweet voice a joyful lay,  
And all the Zisi join the chorus gay:

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

 <span id="fr_265"></span>[4](#fn_262) A heifer of the corn am I,  
        Kara! Kara! <span id="fr_266"></span>[5](#fn_263)  
Yoked with the kine we gayly fly,  
        Kara! Kara!  
The ploughman's hand is strong and drives  
The glowing soil, the meadow thrives!  
        Before the oxen  
Sa-lum-mat-u na-si. <span id="fr_267"></span>[6](#fn_264)

Chorus

        Before the oxen  
Sa-lum-mat-u na-si.

The harvesters are in the corn!  
        Kara! Kara!  
Our feet are flying with the morn,  
        Kara! Kara!  
We bring thee wealth! it is thine own!  
The grain is ripe! oh, cut it down!  
        The yellow grain  
Sa-lum-mat-u na-si.

Chorus

        The yellow grain  
Sa-lum-mat-u na-si.

The fruit of death, oh, King, taste it not!  
        Taste not! taste not!  
With fruit of Life the land is fraught  
        Around! around!  
The fruit of Life we give to thee  
And happiness, oh, ever see.  
        All joy is thine  
Through Earth and Heaven's bound.

Chorus

        All joy is thine  
Through Earth and Heaven's bound.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

Our corn immortal there is high  
        And ripe! and ripe!  
And ever ripens 'neath that sky  
        As gold! as gold!  
Our corn is bearded, <span id="fr_268"></span>[7](#fn_265) thus 'tis
known,  
And ripens quickly when 'tis grown.  
        Be joy with thee,  
Our love around thee fold!

Chorus

        Be joy with thee,  
Our love around thee fold!

Our King from us now goes, now goes!  
        Away! away!  
His royal robe behind him glows  
        Afar! afar!  
Across the waves where Hea reigns  
The waters swollen he soon gains!  
        To our great seer,  
He sails to him afar!

Chorus

        To our great seer,  
He sails to him afar!

And he will reach that glorious land  
        Away! away!  
Amid our fruit-trees he will stand  
        That day! that day!  
Our fruit so sweet the King will eat,  
Nor bitter mingle with the sweet.  
        In our seer's land  
That glows afar away!

Chorus

        In our seer's land  
That glows afar away!

 

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

The singing spirits from them fled, and he  
Alone stood thinking by young Siduri.

The King leaned on his bow, and eyed the maid,  
A happy look came in his eyes,--and fled,  
For lo! the curtain quick aside is pushed,  
And Sabitu within upon them rushed.  
She stately glides across the shining floor,  
And eyes them both, then turns toward the door.  
But Izdubar is equal to the task,  
With grace now smiling, of the maid doth ask:  
"O Sabitu! wouldst thou tell me the way  
To Khasisadra? for I go this day.  
If I the sea may cross, how shall I go?  
Or through the desert? thou the path mayst know."  
The maiden startled looks upon his face,  
And thus she answers him with queenly grace:  
"So soon must go? Thou canst not cross the sea,  
For thou wilt perish in the waves that way.  
Great Samas once the way of me did ask,  
And I forbade him, but the mighty task  
He undertook, and crossed the mighty deep,  
Where Death's dark waters lie in wait asleep:  
His mighty car of gold swept through the skies,  
With fiery chargers now he daily flies.  
When I approach thee, thou from me wouldst flee?  
But if thou must so soon thus go, the sea  
Perhaps thou too canst cross, if thou wilt 'void  
Death's waters, which relentless ever glide.  
But Izdubar, Ur-Hea, here hath come!  
The boatman of the seer, who to his home  
Returns. He with an axe in yonder woods  
A vessel builds to cross the raging floods.  
If thou desirest not to cross with him,  
We here will welcome thee through endless time;  
But if thou goest, may they see thy face  
Thou seekest,--welcome thee, and thy heart bless."
