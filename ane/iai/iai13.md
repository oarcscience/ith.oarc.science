### HEABANI RESOLVES TO RETURN TO ERECH

As Zaidu sadly turns and rides away,  
The hermit from his cave comes forth to pray:  
"Alas! hath all these wilds their charms here lost?  
And is my breast with wild ambition tost?  
My lonely cot I look upon with shame;  
Again I long to seek the fields of fame,  
Where luxury my remaining years  
May crown, and happiness may find--or tears;  
'Tis true! I should have welcomed the *bar-ru*; <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119.md)  
But he hath since returned to Subartu." <span
id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_120.md)  
His harp he took from its dust-covered case,  
And kissed its carved and well-remembered face;  
And tuning it, he glanced toward the wood,  
And sang his farewell ode to solitude:

Farewell, ye mountains, woods and trees--  
  My heart doth long again for joy;  
I love your wilds and mossy leas,  
  But oh, your solitude doth cloy!

I love to see the *bur-khi-is* <span id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_121.md)  
  Sweep stately o'er the mossy rocks;  
And *tsabi* <span id="fr_122"></span>[4](#fn_122.md) in a wild like this,  
  Hear the tattoo of red woodchucks.

I love the cries of *lig-bar-ri* <span id="fr_123"></span>[5](#fn_123.md)  
  The *nes-i* <span id="fr_124"></span>[6](#fn_124.md) calling for their
prey;  
And leaping of the *na-a-li*, <span id="fr_125"></span>[7](#fn_125.md)  
  That fly in wildest fear away.

I love the *bu-hir-tser-i* <span id="fr_126"></span>[8](#fn_126.md) all,  
  *Khar-sa-a-nu sa-qu-u-tu*; <span
id="fr_127"></span>[9](#fn_127.md)\[paragraph continues\]

 

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

Hear *cu-uts-tsi* <span id="fr_128"></span>[10](#fn_128.md) with thunder
roll  
  Across the skies within my view.

I love to see the *ca-ca-bi* <span id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md)  
  Peep through the pine-trees o'er my home,  
And watch the wild *tu-ra-a-khi* <span id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_130.md)  
  And *arme* <span id="fr_131"></span>[3](#fn_131.md) welcome, to me come.

Farewell! ye solitudes, farewell!  
  I will not moulder rotting lie  
With no one's lips to wish me well;  
  O give me immortality!

But what is fame? A bubble blown  
  Upon the breeze, that bursts its shell,  
And all our brightest hopes are flown,  
  And leaves our solitude a hell.

The holy minstrel bows his head in woe,  
And sweeps the harpstrings with a movement slow;  
Then lifts his eyes toward the setting sun,  
His evening invocation thus begun:

 <span id="fr_132"></span>[4](#fn_132.md)O Samas! to the lifting of my
hands  
  Show favor! unto me thy servant turn!  
What man before thy blessèd Light withstands?  
  O thou! what mortal thine own words can learn?  
And who can rival them inviolate',  
   <span id="fr_133"></span>[5](#fn_133.md)Among the gods no equal thou
hast found.  
In Heaven who of all the gods is great?  
  O thou alone! art great through Heaven's bound!

On earth what man is great? alas! no one,  
  For thou alone art great! through earth's vast bounds.  
When wide thy awful voice in Heaven resounds,  
  The gods fall prostrate to our Holy One;

 

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

When on the earth thy voice afar resounds,  
  The genii <span id="fr_134"></span>[6a](#fn_134.md) bow to thee and kiss
the dust.  
In thee, O Samas! do I put my trust,  
  For thy great love and mercy wide abounds!

O my Creator, God, thy watchfulness  
  O'er me, oh may it never cease!  
  Keep thou the opening of my lips! the fleece  
Of purest snow be my soul's daily dress.  
Guard thou my hands! O Samas, Lord of Light!  
And ever keep my life and heart aright!
