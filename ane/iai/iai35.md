### RELEASE OF ISHTAR--HER ATTEMPTS TO BRING TO LIFE TAMMUZ, HER FIRST LOVER

When Allat saw the flaming herald come,  
And his bright light dispelling all her gloom,  
She beat her breast; and at him furious foams  
In rage, and stamping shakes all Hades' domes,  
Thus cursed the herald, At-su-su-namir:  
"Away! thou herald! or I'll chain thee here  
In my dark vaults, and throw thee for thy food  
The city's garbage, which has stagnant stood,  
With impure waters for thy daily drink,  
And lodge thee in my prison till you sink  
From life impaled in yonder dismal room  
Of torture; to thy fate so thou hast come?  
Thine offspring with starvation I will strike!"

At last obedient doth Allat speak:  
"Go, Namtar! and the iron palace strike!  
O'er Asherim <span id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_234.md) adorned let the dawn
break!  
And seat the spirits on their thrones of gold!  
Let Ishtar Life's bright waters then behold,  
And drink her fill, and bring her then to me;  
From her imprisonment, I send her free."  
And Namtar then goes through the palace walls,  
And flings the light through all the darkened halls,  
And places all the spirits on their thrones,  
Leads Ishtar to the waters near the cones <span
id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_234.md).  
She drinks the sparkling water now with joy,  
Which all her form doth cleanse and purify.  
And he at the first gate her robe returns,  
And leads her through the second; where he turns,\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

And gives her bracelets back;--thus at each door  
Returns to her her girdle, gems; then o'er  
Her queenly brow he placed her shining crown.  
With all her ornaments that were her own,  
She stands with pride before the seventh gate,  
And Namtar bows to her in solemn state:

"Thou hast no ransom to our queen here paid  
For thy deliverance, yet thou hast said  
Thy Tammuz thou didst seek within our walls,  
Turn back! and thou wilt find him in these halls.  
To bring him back to life the waters pour  
Upon him; they thy Tammuz will restore;  
With robes thou mayst adorn him and a crown  
Of jewels, and thy maid with thee alone  
Shall give thee comfort and appease thy grief.  
Kharimtu, Samkha come to thy relief!"

Now Ishtar lifts her eyes within a room  
Prepared for her, and sees her maidens come,  
Before a weird procession wrapped in palls,  
That soundless glide within and fills the halls.  
Before her now they place a sable bier  
Beside the fount-, and Ishtar, drawing near,  
Raised the white pall from Tammuz's perfect form.  
The clay unconscious, had that mystic charm  
Of Beauty sleeping sweetly on his face,--  
Of agony or sorrow left no trace:  
But, oh! that awful wound of death was there  
With its deep mark;--the wound, and not the scar.

When Ishtar's eyes beheld it, all her grief  
Broke forth afresh, refusing all relief;  
She smote her breast in woe, and moaning cried,  
Nor the bright waters to his wound applied:  
"O Tammuz! Tammuz! turn thine eyes on me!  
Thy queen thou didst adorn, before thee see!  
Behold the emeralds and diamond crown  
Thou gavest me when I became thine own!  
Alas! he answers not; and must I mourn  
Forever o'er my love within this bourne?

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

But, oh! the waters from this glowing stream!  
Perhaps those eyes on me with love will beam,  
And I shall hear again his song of love.  
Oh, quickly let these waters to me prove  
Their claim to banish death with magic power!"

Then with her maids, she o'er his form doth pour  
The sparkling drops of life-  
          "He moves! he lives!  
What happiness is this my heart receives?  
O come, my Tammuz! to my loving arms!"

And on breast his breathing form she warms;  
With wondering eyes he stares upon his queen,  
And nestling closed his eyes in bliss again.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_234"></span>[98:1](iai35.htm#fr_237.md) "Asherim," literally
"stone stakes" or "cones," the symbols of the goddess Asherah or Ishtar
(Sayce), but Calmet says that the god Ashima is a deity of very
uncertain origin, and that the name "Ashima" may very well compared with
the Persian "asuman" ("heaven"); in "Zend," "acmano," so Gesonius in his
Man. Lex., 1832. This also, according to the magi, is the name of the
angel of death, who separates the souls of men from their bodies, Cal.
Dic. p. 106. Cones are to be seen in the British Museum which are
probably of the character which represented Elah-Gabalah, the sun-god,
adored in Rome during the reign of Heliogabalus. The symbol and worship
came from Hamath in Syria.
