### ISHTAR AND HER MAIDS IN THE FAVORITE HAUNT OF IZDUBAR

The king while hunting where a forest grows,  
Around sweet hyacinths and budding rose,  
Where a soft zephyr o'er them gently flows  
From the dark *sik-ka-ti* <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md) where
Kharsak <span id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md) glows;  
And Sedu <span id="fr_58"></span>[3](#fn_58.md) softly dances on the
leaves,  
And a rich odorous breath from them receives;  
Where tulips peep with heliotrope and pink,  
With violets upon a gleaming brink  
Of silver gliding o'er a water-fall  
That sings its purling treasures o'er a wall  
Of rugged onyx sparkling to the sea:  
A spot where Zir-ri <span id="fr_59"></span>[4](#fn_59.md) sport oft
merrily,  
Where Hea's <span id="fr_60"></span>[5](#fn_60.md) arm outstretched doth
form a bay,  
Wild, sheltered, where his sea-daughters play;  
A jasper rock here peeps above the waves  
Of emerald hue; with them its summit laves.

Around, above, this cool enchanting cove  
Bend amorous, spicy branches; here the dove  
Oft coos its sweetest notes to its own mate,  
And fragrance pure, divine, the air doth freight,  
To sport with gods no lovelier place is found,  
With love alone the mystic woods resound.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

Here witching Zi-na-ki <span id="fr_61"></span>[6](#fn_61.md) oft drag
within  
The waves unwilling Zi-si; <span id="fr_62"></span>[7](#fn_62.md) here the
din  
Of roars of sullen storms is never known  
When tempests make the mighty waters groan;  
Nor sound of strife is heard, but rippling rills,  
Or softest note of love, the breezes fills.

And here the king in blissful dreams oft lies  
'Mid pure ambrosial odors, and light flies  
The tune in bliss; away from kingly care,  
And hollow splendor of the courtly glare;  
Away from triumphs, battle-fields afar,  
The favorite haunt of huntsman Izdubar.

The Queen of Love the glowing spot surveys,  
And sees the monarch where he blissful lays;  
And watching till he takes his bow and spear  
To chase the wild gazelles now browsing near,  
She, ere the king returns, near by arrives  
With her two maids; with them for love connives,  
joy and seduction thus voluptuous fly  
Her Samkhatu, <span id="fr_63"></span>[8](#fn_63.md) Kharimtu <span
id="fr_64"></span>[9](#fn_64.md) from the sky,  
As gently, lightly as a spirit's wing  
Oft carries gods to earth while Sedu sing.  
Thus, they, with lightest step, expectant stood  
Within this lovely spot beneath the wood.

Their snowy limbs they bare, undraped now stand  
Upon the rock at Ishtar's soft command.  
Like marble forms endued with life they move,  
And thrill the air with welcome notes of love.  
The *its-tu-ri Same mut-tab-ri* <span id="fr_65"></span>[10](#fn_65.md)
sang  
Their sweetest notes, and the *Khar-san-u* <span
id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md) rang  
With songs of thrushes, turtle-doves and Jays,  
And linnets, with the nightingale's sweet lays,  
Goldfinches, magpies and the wild hoopoes;  
With cries of green-plumed parrots and cuckoos,

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

Pee-wits and sparrows join the piercing cries  
Of gorgeous herons, while now upward flies  
The eagle screaming, joyful spreads his wings  
Above the forest; and the woodchuck rings  
A wild tattoo upon the trees around;  
And humming-birds whirr o'er the flowering ground  
In flocks, and beat the luscious laden air  
With emerald and gold, and scarlet, where  
These perfect forms with godly grace divine,  
In loveliness upon the rock recline.  
Sweet joy is slender formed, with bright black eyes  
That sparkle oft and dance with joy's surprise;  
Seduction, with her rare voluptuous form,  
Enchanteth all till wildest passions warm  
The blood and fire the eye beneath her charm;  
All hearts in heaven and earth she doth disarm.  
The Queen with every perfect charm displayed  
Delights the eye, and fills the heart, dismayed  
With fear, lest the bright phantom may dissolve  
To airy nothingness, till fierce resolve  
Fills each who her beholds, while love doth dart  
From liquid eyes and captivates the heart.  
She is the queen who fills the earth with love  
And reigns unrivalled in her realms above.

Beware, ye hearts! beware! who feel the snare  
Of Ishtar, lest ye tread upon the air;  
When ye her rosy chain of fragrance wear,  
When blindness strikes the eye, and deaf the ear  
Becomes, and heartstrings only lead you then,  
Till ye return to common sense again;  
Enthralled mayhap and captive led in chains  
Ye then will leisure have to bear your pains;  
Or if perchance a joy hath come to thee,  
Through all thy joyous life, then happy be!
