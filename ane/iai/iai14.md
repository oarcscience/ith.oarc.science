## TABLET III--COLUMN I

### HEABANI'S WISDOM-SONG OF THE KHAU-IK-I

The dark-eyed maids are dancing in the halls  
Of Erech's palace: music fills the walls  
Of splendor where the Sar-dan-nu <span id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_135)
enthroned,  
His hours is whiling by the maidens zoned;  
A whirling garland chanting forth a song,  
Accompanied with harps thus sang the throng:

"Heabani's wisdom chant and sing  
  To Erech's king our mighty Sar. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_136)  
When Hea did Heabani bring,  
  Who now to Erech comes afar,  
He taught him then all hidden things  
  Of Ki <span id="fr_137"></span>[3](#fn_137) or bright Samu <span
id="fr_138"></span>[4](#fn_138) above,  
That to the Mu-di <span id="fr_139"></span>[5](#fn_139) mystery
brings.  
  Oh, how Heabani we shall love!

Chorus

"Then sing with joy ye Khau-ik-i! <span
id="fr_140"></span>[6b](#fn_140)  
  The Khau-ga <span id="fr_141"></span>[7](#fn_141) chant with waving
arms,  
The Nin-uit <span id="fr_142"></span>[8](#fn_142) sing Au-un-na-ci <span
id="fr_143"></span>[9](#fn_143)  
  Give to our Sar your sweetest charms.

 

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

"All knowledge that is visible  
  Heabani holds it in his glance,  
Sees visions inconceivable,  
  The Zi <span id="fr_144"></span>[10](#fn_144) his wizard eyes
entrance.  
Sweet peace he brings from troubled dreams,  
  He copies to El-li-tar-du-si, <span id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145)  
From a far road by mountain streams;  
  Then sing with joy ye Khau-ik-i!

Chorus

"Then sing with joy ye Khau-ik-i!  
  The Khau-ga chant with waving arms,  
The Nin-uit sing An-un-na-ci!  
  Give to our Sar your sweetest charms.

"E'en all that on the tablet rests,  
  In Erech's tower, the Su-bu-ri <span id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_146)  
The beautiful, with glorious crests,  
  He wrote for far posterity.  
We plead with him to leave us not,  
  But Zi-Gab-ri <span id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_147) him led away,  
When our great Shal-man <span id="fr_148"></span>[4](#fn_148) joy us
brought,  
  And Elam fled to the blue sea.

Chorus

"Then sing with joy ye Khau-ik-i!  
  Il-gi-sa-kis-sat <span id="fr_149"></span>[5](#fn_149) from above,  
The Nin-nit sing An-un-na-ci!  
  Oh, how Heabani we shall love!"

The maidens note their monarch's moody face,  
And turn their songs to him with easy grace,  
Of their great ruler tune a joyous lay,  
Arid oft into his eyes hurl glances gay;  
And trumpets join the chorus, rolling drums,  
And wild applause from all the chieftains comes,

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

Till the grave seers and councillors now cry  
In praise of him they love so tenderly:  
With arms upraised the mighty chorus join,  
Until his heart is filled with joy divine;  
And thus they sing with more than royal praise,  
Their love for him in every face doth blaze.
