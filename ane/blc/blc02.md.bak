*The Babylonian Legends of Creation*, by E. A. Wallis Budge, \[1921\],
at Intangible Textual Heritage

## Publication of the Creation Tablets.

The publication of the above-mentioned texts and translations proved
beyond all doubt the correctness of Rawlinson's assertion made in 1865,
that "certain portions of the Babylonian and Assyrian Legends of the
Creation resembled passages in the early chapters of the Book of
Genesis." During the next twenty years, the Creation texts were copied
and recopied by many Assyriologists, but no publication appeared in
which all the material available for reconstructing the Legend was given
in a collected form. In 1898, the Trustees of the British Museum ordered
the publication of all the Creation texts contained in the Babylonian
and Assyrian Collections, and the late Mr. L. W. King, Assistant in the
Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities, was directed to prepare
an edition. The exhaustive preparatory search which he made through the
collections of tablets in the British Museum resulted in the discovery
of many unpublished fragments of the Creation Legends, and in the
identification of a fragment which, although used by George Smith, had
been lost sight of for about twenty-five years. He ascertained also
that, according to the Ninevite scribes, the Tablets of the Creation
Series were seven in number, and what several versions of the Legend of
the Creation, the works of Babylonian and Assyrian editors of different
periods, must have existed in early Mesopotamian Libraries. King's
edition of the Creation Texts appeared in "Cuneiform Texts from
Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum," Part XIII, London, 1901. As
the scope of this work did not permit the inclusion of his translations,
and commentary and notes, he published these in a private work entitled,
"The Seven Tablets of Creation, or the Babylonian and Assyrian Legends
concerning the creation of the world and of mankind," London, 1902, 8vo.
A supplementary volume contained much new material which had been found
by him since the appearance of the official edition of the texts, and in
fact doubled the number of Creation Texts known hitherto.
