<p>1. They founded for him a majestic canopy,</p>  
<p>2. He (<i>i.e.</i>, Marduk) seated himself in the seat of kingship in the presence of his fathers [who said unto him]:</p>  
<p>3. "Thou art honourable by reason of thy greatness among the gods.</p>  
<p>4. "Thy position is unrivalled, the words thou utterest become Anum (<i>i.e.</i>, as fixed as the sky).</p>  
<p>5. "Thou art honourable by reason of thy greatness among the gods.</p>  
<p>6. "Thy position is unrivalled, the words thou utterest become Anum (<i>i.e.</i>, as fixed as the sky).</p>  
<p>7. "From this day onward thy command shall not be abrogated.</p>  
<p>8. "The power to exalt to heaven and to cast down to the earth both shall be in thy hand,</p>  
<p>9. "That which goeth forth from thy mouth shall be established, against thy utterance shall be no appeal.</p>  
<p>10. "No one among the gods shall overstep thy boundary,</p>  
<p>11. "Worship, which is the object of the sanctuary of the gods,</p>  
<p>12. "Whensoever they lack [it] shall be forthcoming in thy sanctuary,</p>  
<p>13. "O god Marduk, thou art our avenger.</p>  
<p>14. "We have given unto thee sovereignty over the whole creation,</p>  
<p>15. "Thou shalt sit down, in the council thy word shall be exalted,</p>  
<p>16. "Thy weapon shall never fall [from thy hands], it shall break the head of thy foe.</p>  
<p>17. "Lord, whosoever putteth his trust in thee, spare thou his life,</p>  
<p>18. "And the god who deviseth evil, pour thou out his soul."</p>  
<p>19. Then a cloak (literally, one cloak) was set in their midst,</p>  
<p>20. They addressed the god Marduk their first-born [saying]:</p>  
<p>21. "Thou, Lord, shalt hold the foremost position among the gods.</p>  
<p>22. "Decree thou the throwing down&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A> and the building up,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A> and it shall come to pass.</p>  
<p>23. "Speak but the word, and the cloak shall disappear,</p>  
<p>24. "Speak a second time and the cloak shall return uninjured."</p>  
<p>25. Marduk spoke the word, the cloak disappeared,</p>  
<p>26. He spoke a second time, the cloak reappeared.</p>  
<p>27. When the gods his fathers saw the issue of the utterance of his mouth</p>  
<p>28. They rejoiced and adored [him, saying], "Marduk is King."</p>  
<p>29. They conferred upon him the sceptre, the throne, and the symbol of royalty (?)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A></p>  
<p>30. They gave him the unrivalled weapon, the destroyer of the enemy [saying]:</p>  
<p>31. "Go, cut off the life of Ti&acirc;mat.</p>  
<p>32. "Let the wind carry her blood into the depth [under the earth]."</p>  
<p>33. The gods, his fathers, issued the decree for the god Bel.</p>  
<p>34. They set him on the road which leadeth to peace and adoration.</p>  
<p>35. He strung [his] bow, he set ready his weapon [in the stand],</p>  
<p>36. He slung his spear, he attached it to [his belly],</p>  
<p>37. He raised the club, he grasped it in his right hand.</p>  
<p>38. The bow and the quiver he hung at his side.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A></p>  
<p>39. He set the lightning in front of him.</p>  
<p>40. His body was filled with a glancing flame of fire.</p>  
<p>41. He made a net wherewith to enclose Ti&acirc;mat.</p>  
<p>42. He made the four winds to take up their position so that no part of her might escape,</p>

<p>43. The South wind, the North wind, the East wind, the West wind.</p>  
<p>44. He held the net close to his side, the gift of his father Anu,</p>  
<p>45. He created the "foul" wind, the storm, the parching blast,</p>  
<p>46. The wind of "four," the wind of "seven," the typhoon, the wind incomparable</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_022"></A>

<p>47. He despatched the seven winds which he had made,</p>  
<p>48. To make turbid the inward parts of Ti&acirc;mat; they followed in his train.</p>  
<p>49. The Lord raised up the wind storm, his mighty weapon.</p>  
<p>50. He went up into his chariot, the unequalled and terrible tempest.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A></p>  
<p>51. He equipped it, he yoked thereto a team of four horses,</p>  
<p>52. Pawing the ground, champing, foaming [eager to] fly,</p>  
<p>53. ... [the odour] of their teeth bore foetidness,</p>  
<p>54. They were skilled [in biting], they were trained to trample under foot.</p>  
<p>[Lines 55-57 too fragmentary to translate; they continue the description of Marduk's equipment.]</p>  
<p>58. His brightness streamed forth, his head was crowned [thereby].</p>  
<p>59. He took a direct path, he hastened on his journey.</p>  
<p>60. He set his face towards the place of Ti&acirc;mat, who was ...</p>  
<p>61. On his lips ... he restrained</p>  
<p>62. ... his hand grasped.</p>  
<p>63. At that moment the gods were gazing upon him with fixed intensity,</p>  
<p>64. The gods, his fathers, gazed upon him, they gazed upon him.</p>  
<p>65. The Lord approached, he looked upon the middle of Ti&acirc;mat,</p>  
<p>66. He searched out the plan of Kingu, her husband.</p>  
<p>67. Marduk looked, Kingu staggered in his gait,</p>  
<p>68. His will was destroyed, his motion was paralysed.</p>  
<p>69. And the gods his helpers who were marching by his side</p>  
<p>70. Saw the [collapse of] their chief and their sight was troubled.</p>  
<p>71. Ti&acirc;mat [shrieked but] did not turn her head.</p>  
<p>72. With lips full of [rebellious words] she maintained her stubbornness</p>  
<p>73. [Saying], "... that thou hast come as the Lord of the gods, [forsooth],</p>  
<p>74. "They have appointed thee in the place which should be theirs."</p>  
<p>75. The Lord raised up the wind-storm, his mighty weapon,</p>  
<p>76. [Against] Ti&acirc;mat, who was furious (?), he sent it, [saying]:</p>  
<p>77. "[Thou hast made thyself] mighty, thou art puffed upon high,</p>  
<p>78. "Thy heart [hath stirred thee up] to invoke battle</p>  
<p>79. "... their fathers ...</p>  
<p>80. "...</p>  
<p>81. "[Thou hast exalted Kingu to be [thy] husband,</p>  
<p>82. "[Thou hast made him to usurp] the attributes of Anu</p>  
<p>83. "... thou hast planned evil.</p>  
<p>84. "[Against] the gods, my fathers, thou hast wrought evil.</p>  
<p>85. "Let now thy troops gird themselves up, let them bind on their weapons.</p>  
<p>86. "Stand up! Thou and I, let us to the fight!"</p>  
<p>87. On hearing these words Ti&acirc;mat</p>  
<p>88. Became like a mad thing, her senses became distraught,</p>  
<p>89. Ti&acirc;mat uttered shrill cries again and again.</p>  
<p>90. That on which she stood split in twain at the words,</p>  
<p>91. She recited an incantation, she pronounced her spell.</p>  
<p>92. The gods of battle demanded their weapons.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A></p>  
<p>93. Ti&acirc;mat and Marduk, the envoy of the gods, roused themselves,</p>  
<p>94. They advanced to fight each other, they drew nigh in battle.</p>  
<p>95. The Lord cast his net and made it to enclose her,</p>  
<p>96. The evil wind that had its place behind him he let out in her face.</p>  
<p>97. Ti&acirc;mat opened her mouth to its greatest extent,</p>  
<p>98. Marduk made the evil wind to enter [it] whilst her lips were unclosed.</p>  
<p>99. The raging winds filled out her belly,</p>  
<p>100. Her heart was gripped, she opened wide her mouth [panting].</p>  
<p>101. Marduk grasped the spear, he split up her belly,</p>  
<p>102. He clave open her bowels, he pierced [her] heart,</p>  
<p>103. He brought her to nought, he destroyed her life.</p>  
<p>104. He cast down her carcase, he took up his stand upon it,</p>  
<p>105. After Marduk had slain Ti&acirc;mat the chief,</p>  
<p>106. Her host was scattered, her levies became fugitive,</p>  
<p>107. And the gods, her allies, who had marched at her side,</p>  
<p>108. Quaked with terror, and broke and ran</p>  
<p>109. And betook themselves to flight to save their lives.</p>  
<p>110. But they found themselves hemmed in, they could not escape,</p>  
<p>111. Marduk tied them up, he smashed their weapons.</p>  
<p>112. They were cast into the net, and they were caught in the snare,</p>  
<p>113. The ... of the world they filled with [their] cries of grief.</p>  
<p>114. They received [Marduk's] chastisement, they were confined in restraint,</p>  
<p>115. And [on] the Eleven Creatures which Ti&acirc;mat had filled with awfulness,</p>  
<p>116. The company of the devils that marched at her ...</p>  
<p>117. He threw fetters, he ... their sides.</p>  
<p>118. They and their resistance he trod under his feet.</p>  
<p>119. The god Kingu who had been magnified over them</p>  
<p>120. He crushed, he esteemed him [as little worth] as the god Dugga, (as a dead god?).</p>  
<p>121. Marduk took from him the TABLET OF DESTINIES, which should never have been his,</p>  
<p>122. He sealed it with a seal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A> and fastened it on his breast</p>  
<p>123. After he had crushed and overthrown his enemies,</p>  
<p>124. He made the haughty enemy to be like the dust underfoot.</p>  
<p>125. He established completely Anshar's victory over the enemy,</p>  
<p>126. The valiant Marduk achieved the object of Nudimmud (Ea),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A></p>  
<p>127. He imposed strict restraint on the gods whom he had made captive.</p>  
<p>128. He turned back to Ti&acirc;mat whom he had defeated,</p>  
<p>129. The Lord [Marduk] trampled on the rump of Ti&acirc;mat,</p>  
<p>130. With his unsparing club he clave her skull.</p>  
<p>131. He slit open the channels (<i>i.e.</i>, arteries) of her blood.</p>  
<p>132. He caused the North Wind to carry it away to a place underground.</p>  
<p>133. His fathers (<i>i.e.</i>, the gods) looked on, they rejoiced, they were glad.</p>  
<p>134. They brought unto him offerings of triumph and peace,</p>  
<p>135. The Lord [Marduk] paused, he examined Ti&acirc;mat's carcase.</p>  
<p>136. He separated flesh [from] hair,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="blc17.htm#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A> he worked cunningly.</p>  
<p>137. He slit Ti&acirc;mat open like a flat (?) fish [cut into] two pieces,</p>  
<p>138. The one half he raised up and shaded the heavens therewith,</p>  
<p>139. He pulled the bolt, he posted a guard,</p>  
<p>140. He ordered them not to let her water escape.</p>  
<p>141. He crossed heaven, he contemplated the regions thereof.</p>  
<p>142. He betook himself to the abode of Nudimmud (Ea) that is opposite to the Deep (Apsu),</p>  
<p>143. The Lord Marduk measured the dimensions of the Deep,</p>  
<p>144. He founded E-Sharra, a place like unto it,</p>  
<p>145. The abode E-Sharra, which he made to be heaven.</p>  
<p>146. He made the-gods Anu, Bel and Ea to inhabit their [own] cities.</p>
