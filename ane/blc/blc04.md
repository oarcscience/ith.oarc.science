## Variant Forms of the Babylonian Legend of the Creation.

The views about the Creation which are described in the Seven Tablets
mentioned above were not the only ones current in Mesopotamia, and
certainly they were not necessarily the most orthodox. Though in the
version of the Legend already referred to the great god of creation was
Enlil, or Marduk, or Ashur, we know that in the Legend of Gilgamish
(Second Tablet) it was the goddess Aruru who created Enkidu (Eabani)
from a piece of clay moistened with her own spittle. And in the
so-called "bilingual" version <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](blc17.htm#fn_2.md)
of the Legend, we find that this goddess assisted Marduk as an equal in
the work of creating the seed of mankind. This version, although Marduk
holds the position of pre-eminence, differs in many particulars from
that given by the Seven Tablets, and as it is the most important of all
the texts which deal directly with the creation of the heavens and the
earth, a rendering of it is here given.
