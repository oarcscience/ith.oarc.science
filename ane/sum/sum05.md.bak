# Sumerian Mythology

# INTRODUCTION

### THE SOURCES: THE SUMERIAN LITERARY TABLETS DATING FROM APPROXIMATELY 2000 B. C.

The study of Sumerian culture introduced by the present volume,
*Sumerian Mythology*, is to be based largely on Sumerian literary
sources; it will consist of the formulation of the spiritual and
religious concepts of the Sumerians, together with the reconstructed
text and translation of the Sumerian literary compositions in which
these concepts are revealed. It is therefore very essential that the
reader have a clear picture of the nature of our source material, which
consists primarily of some three thousand tablets and fragments
inscribed in the Sumerian language and dated approximately 1750 B.
C. [a](sum11.htm#xref_a.md) It is the first aim of the Introduction of the
present volume to achieve such clarification. It therefore begins with a
brief sketch of the rather rocky road leading to the decipherment of the
Sumerian language and continues with a brief résumé of the excavations
conducted on various Sumerian sites in the course of the past
three-quarters of a century. After a very brief general evaluation of
the contents of the huge mass of Sumerian tablet material uncovered in
the course of these excavations, it turns to the Sumerian literary
tablets which represent the basic material for our study, and analyzes
in some detail the scope and date of their contents. The Introduction
then concludes with a description of the factors which prevented in
large part the trustworthy reconstruction and translation of the
Sumerian literary compositions in the past; the details, not
uninteresting in themselves, furnish a revealing and illuminating
commentary on the course and progress of one of the more significant
humanistic efforts of our generation.

The decipherment of Sumerian differed from that of
Accadian [3](sum10.htm#xref_3.md) and Egyptian in one significant detail, a
detail

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

which proved to be one of the factors in hampering the progress of
Sumerology to no inconsiderable extent. For in the case of Egypt,
Assyria, and Babylonia, the investigating scholars of western Europe had
at their disposal much relevant material from Biblical, classical, and
postclassical sources. Not only were such names as Egypt, Ashur, and
Babylon well known, but at least to a certain extent and with much
limitation and qualification, even the culture of the peoples was not
altogether unfamiliar. In the case of the Sumerians, however, the
situation was quite different; *there was no clearly recognizable trace
of Sumer or its people and language in the entire Biblical, classical,
and post-classical literature*. The very name Sumer was erased from the
mind and memory of man for over two thousand years. The discovery of the
Sumerians and their language came quite unexpectedly and was quite
unlooked for; and this more or less irrelevant detail was at least
partially responsible for the troubled progress of Sumerology from the
earliest days to the present moment.

Historically, the decipherment of Sumerian resulted from that of
Accadian, which in turn followed the decipherment of cuneiform Persian.
Briefly sketched, the process was as follows. In 1765, the Danish
traveler and scholar, Carsten Niebuhr, succeeded in making careful
copies of several inscriptions on the monuments of Persepolis. These
were published between the years 1774 and 1778, and were soon recognized
as trilingual, that is, the same inscriptions seemed to be repeated in
three different languages. It was not unreasonable to assume, since the
monuments were located in Persepolis, that they were inscribed by one or
more kings of the Achaemenid dynasty and that the first version in each
inscription was in the Persian language. Fortunately, at approximately
the same time, Old Persian was becoming known to western European
scholars through the efforts of Duperron, who had studied in India under
the Parsees and was preparing translations of the Avesta. And so by
1802, with the help of the newly acquired knowledge of Old Persian and
by keen manipulation of the

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Achaemenid proper names as handed down in
Biblical and classical literature, the German scholar, Grotefend,
succeeded in deciphering a large part of the Persian version of the
inscriptions. Additions and corrections were made by numerous scholars
in the ensuing years. But the crowning achievement belongs to the
Englishman H. C. Rawlinson. A member of the English Intelligence
Service, Rawlinson was first stationed in India, where he mastered the
Persian language. In 1835 he was transferred to Persia, where he learned
of the huge trilingual inscription on the rock of Behistun and
determined to copy it. The Persian version of the Behistun inscription
consists of 414 lines; the second, now known as the Elamite version,
consists of 263 lines; while the third, the Accadian (designated in
earlier Assyriological literature as Assyrian or Babylonian--see note
 [3](sum10.htm#xref_3).md) version, consists of 112 lines. During the years
1835-37, at the risk of life and limb, Rawlinson succeeded in copying
200 lines of the Persian version. He returned in 1844 and completed the
copying of the Persian as well as the Elamite version. The Accadian
inscription, however, was so situated that it was impossible for him to
copy it, and it was not until 1847 that he succeeded in making squeezes
of the text. To return to the decipherment of cuneiform Persian, by 1846
Rawlinson published his memoir in the *Journal of the Royal Asiatic
Society*, which gave the transliteration and translation of the Persian
version of the Behistun inscription together with a copy of the
cuneiform original.

Long before the final decipherment of the Persian text, however, great
interest had been aroused in western Europe by the third version of the
Persepolis inscriptions. For it was soon recognized that this was the
script and language found in numerous inscriptions and bricks, clay
tablets, and clay cylinders which were finding their way into Europe
from sites that might well be identified with Nineveh and Babylon. In
1842 the French under Botta began the excavation of Khorsabad, and in
1S45 Layard began his excavations of Nimrud and Nineveh. Inscribed
monuments were being found in large quantities at all three sites;
moreover,

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Layard was uncovering at Nineveh a large number
of inscribed clay tablets. By 1850, therefore, Europe had scores of
inscriptions coming largely from Assyrian sites, made in the very same
script and language as the third version of the Persepolis and Behistun
inscriptions. The decipherment of this language was simplified on the
one hand by the fact that it was recognized quite early in the process
that it belonged to the Semitic group of languages. On the other hand,
it was complicated by the fact that the orthography, as was soon
recognized, was syllabic and ideographic rather than alphabetic. The
leading figure in the decipherment of Accadian, or Assyrian as it was
then designated, was the Irish scholar Edward Hincks. But once again a
major contribution was made by Rawlinson. In 1851 he published the text,
transliteration, and translation of the Accadian version of the Behistun
inscription, the large trilingual to whose text he alone had access.

As for the second, or Elamite version, of the Behistun inscription, it
offered relatively little difficulty as soon as progress was made in the
decipherment of Accadian, since it uses a syllabary based on the
Accadian system of writing. The major figures in its decipherment were
Westergaard and Norris. As early as 1855 Norris, the secretary of the
Royal Asiatic Society, published the complete text of the second version
of the Behistun inscription, which had been copied by Rawlinson,
together with a transliteration and a translation; this remained
practically the standard work on the subject until Weissbach published
his *Achämenideninschriften zweiter Art* in 1896.

As will be noted, nothing has yet been heard or said of the Sumerians.
As early as 1850, however, Hincks began to doubt that the Semitic
inhabitants of Assyria and Babylonia had invented the cuneiform system
of writing. In the Semitic languages the stable element is the consonant
while the vowel is extremely variable. It seemed unnatural, therefore,
that the Semites should invent a syllabic system of orthography in which
the vowel seemed to be as unchanging as the consonant. Moreover, if the
Semites had

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

invented the script, one might have expected to be able to trace the
syllabic values of the signs to Semitic words. But this was hardly ever
the case; the syllabic values all seemed to go back to words or elements
for which no Semitic equivalent could be found. Hincks thus began to
suspect that the cuneiform system of writing was invented by a
non-Semitic people who had preceded the Semites in Mesopotamia. In 1855
Rawlinson published a memoir in the *Journal of the Royal Asiatic
Society* in which he speaks of his discovery of non-Semitic inscriptions
on bricks and tablets from sites in southern Babylonia such as Nippur,
Larsa, and Erech. In 1856 Hincks took up the problem of this new
language, recognized that it was agglutinative in character, and gave
the first examples from bilinguals which had come to the British Museum
from the Nineveh excavations. The name of the language was variously
designated as Scythic or even Accadian, that is, the very name now given
to the Semitic tongue spoken in Assyria and Babylonia. In 1869, however,
the French scholar Oppert, basing himself on the royal title, "king of
Sumer and Accad," and realizing that Accad referred to the land
inhabited by the Semitic population, rightly attributed the name
Sumerian to the language spoken by the non-Semitic people who had
invented the cuneiform script. Nevertheless, Oppert was not immediately
followed by the majority of the Assyriologists, and the name Accadian
continued to be used for Sumerian for many years. [5](sum10.htm#xref_5.md)

For several decades following the discovery of the existence of
Sumerian, practically all the source material for its decipherment and
study consisted of the bilinguals and syllabaries from the so-called
Ashurbanipal library which was discovered and excavated at Nineveh. This
material dates from the seventh century B. C., some fifteen hundred
years after the disappearance of Sumer as a political entity. As for the
material from the Sumerian sites, it consisted almost entirely of a very
small group of bricks, tablets, and cylinders from the Sumerian and
post-Sumerian periods which had found their way into the British Museum.
In

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

1877, however, began the first successful excavation at a Sumerian site.
In that year, the French under De Sarzec began to excavate at Telloh the
ancient Sumerian city of

### MAP 1. SUMER IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B. C.

The Sumerians were a non-Semitic, non-Indo-European people who probably
entered Mesopotamia from the east prior to or during the fourth
millennium B. C. At the time of the Sumerian invasion much of the land
between the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers was no doubt inhabited by
the Semites, and the entrance of the Sumerians marked the beginning of a
struggle between the two peoples for control of the two-river land,
which lasted for some two millennia. To judge from our present data,
victory first fell to the Sumerians. There is reason to assume that at
one time the Sumerians were in control of the better part of Mesopotamia
and that they even carried their conquests into more distant lands. It
was no doubt during this period of conquest and power in the fourth
millennium B. C. that the Sumerians made important advances in their
economic, social, and political organization. This material progress,
together with the growth and development of the spiritual and religious
concepts which accompanied it, must have left an enduring impress on all
the peoples of the Near East who came in contact with the Sumerians
during the fourth millennium.

But the early defeat of the Semites by the Sumerians did not mark the
end of the struggle between the two peoples for the control of
Mesopotamia. No doubt with the help of new invasion hordes from the
Arabian peninsula, the Semites gradually regained some of their strength
and became ever more aggressive. And so in the first part of the third
millennium we find the Sumerians being gradually pushed back to the more
southerly portion of Mesopotamia, roughly from Nippur to the Persian
Gulf on our map. North of Nippur the Semites seemed well entrenched.

Approximately in the middle of the third millennium arose the great
Semitic conqueror, Sargon, the founder of the dynasty of Accad. He and
the kings that followed him attacked and badly defeated the Sumerians to
the south, making it a practice, moreover, to carry off many of their
victims into captivity and to settle Semites in their places. This
defeat marked the beginning of the end for the Sumerians. It is true
that toward the very end of the third millennium the Sumerians made a
final attempt at political control of Mesopotamia, and under the
so-called "Third Dynasty of Ur" met with a certain initial success.
However, the important role played by the Semites even in this
"Neo-Sumerian" kingdom, which lasted for no more than a century, is
indicated by the fact that the last three kings of the dynasty bore
Semitic names. With the destruction of Ur, their last capital, in
approximately 2050 B. C., the Sumerians gradually disappeared as a
political entity. Not long afterwards, the Amurru, a Semitic people who
had begun to penetrate into lower Mesopotamia toward the end of the
third millennium, established the city of Babylon as their capital, and
under such rulers as Hammurabi succeeded in obtaining temporary sway
over Mesopotamia. Because of the prominence of Babylon in the second and
first millennia B. C., the country once held and ruled by the Sumerians
came to be known as Babylonia, a name which has continued in use to the
present day. [4](sum10.htm#xref_4.md)

\[paragraph continues\] Lagash, an excavation which has been conducted
by French archaeologists intermittently and with long interruptions
almost to the present day. It was at this site that the first important
Sumerian monuments were excavated, the objects and inscriptions of the
*ishakkus* or princes of Lagash. Here more than one hundred thousand
tablets and fragments were dug up, dating from the pre-Sargonid and Ur
III periods."

The second major excavation on a Sumerian site was that conducted by the
University of Pennsylvania, the first American expedition to excavate in
Mesopotamia. All through the eighties of the nineteenth century
discussions had been going on in American university circles pertaining
to the feasibility of sending an American expedition to Iraq, where both
British and French had been making extraordinary finds. It was not until
1887, however, that John P. Peters, professor of Hebrew in the
University of Pennsylvania, succeeded in obtaining moral and financial
support from various individuals in and about the university, for the
purpose of equipping and maintaining an excavating expedition in

### PLATE I. A SCENE FROM THE NIPPUR EXCAVATIONS: ROOMS OF THE TEMPLE "TABLET HOUSE."

In the history of American archaeology, the Nippur expedition, organized
by the University of Pennsylvania more than 50 yean ago, will always be
remembered with special interest and regard. For it was the Nippur
excavations, supported over a number of years by a relatively small
group of Philadelphians of unusual vision and understanding, which were
responsible to no small extent for making America
"archaeology-conscious." Moreover, it was largely the interest and
enthusiasm aroused by the Nippur discoveries that led to the founding
and organizing of the University Museum, an institution which for almost
half a century has proved to be a leading pioneer in all branches of
archaeological activity.

The ruins of Nippur, among the largest in southern Mesopotamia, cover
approximately 180 acres. They are divided into two well-nigh equal parts
by the now dry bed of the Shatt-en-Nil, a canal which at one time
branched off from the Euphrates and watered and fructified the otherwise
barren territory through which it flowed. The eastern half contains the
temple structures, including the ziggurat and the group of buildings
which must have formed the scribal school and library; it is in this
part of the mound that the "tablet house" was excavated. The western
half seems to mark the remains of the city proper. [7](sum10.htm#xref_7.md)

\[paragraph continues\] Iraq under the auspices of the University of
Pennsylvania. Nippur, one of the largest and most important mounds in
Iraq, was chosen, and four long and extremely difficult excavating
campaigns were conducted during the years 188990, 1890-91, 1893-96, and
1896-1900.

The hardships and handicaps were severe and discouraging. One young
archaeologist died in the field, and there was hardly a year in which
one or the other of the members of the expedition did not suffer from
serious illness. Difficulties with the Arab tribes were not infrequent
and at times assumed a most threatening character. In spite of the
obstacles, however, the excavating continued, and in the course of the
four campaigns which lasted more than a decade, the expedition achieved
magnificent and in some respects unparalleled results, at least in the
inscriptional field. The Nippur expedition succeeded in excavating
approximately thirty thousand tablets and fragments in the course of its
four campaigns, the larger part of which are inscribed in the Sumerian
language and date from the second half of the third millennium to the
first half of the second millennium B. C.

The contents of these tablets are rich and varied. The greater part is
economic in character; it consists of contracts and bills of sale,
promissory notes and receipts, lists and accounts, wills, adoptions,
court decisions, and other legal and administrative documents. Many of
the tablets are letters; some are historical inscriptions; still others
are lexical in character, that is, they contain Sumerian dictionary and
grammatical material of priceless value for our study of the language,
since they were actually compiled by the ancient scribes themselves. But
especially noteworthy is the large group of tablets dated about 1750 B.
C. [a](sum11.htm#xref_a.md) which are inscribed with the Sumerian literary
compositions consisting of epics and myths, hymns and laments, proverbs
and "wisdom."

After Nippur, the excavations by the Germans at Fara (the ancient
"flood" city Shuruppak) in 1902-03 and those by the University of
Chicago at Bismaya (ancient

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Adab) in 1903-04 uncovered important Sumerian
economic and lexical material dating largely from the pre-Sargonid and
Sargonid periods in the third millennium B. C. Excavations at Kish,
begun by the French in 1911 and continued under Anglo-American auspices
from 1922 to 1930, have yielded important inscriptional material. In
Jemdet Nasr, not far from Kish, a large group of semi-pictographic
tablets that go back to the early beginnings of Sumerian writing were
uncovered. Ur, the famous site excavated by a joint expedition of the
British Museum and the University Museum between the years 1919 and
1933, yielded many historical and economic inscriptions and some
literary material. In Asmar (ancient Eshnunna) and Khafaje, east of the
Tigris, a large number of economic tablets dating largely from the
Sargonid and Ur III periods, that is, the latter part of the third
millennium B. C., were excavated by the Oriental Institute of the
University of Chicago in recent years. Finally in Erech, where the
Germans conducted excavations from 1928 until the outbreak of the war, a
large group of pictographic tablets antedating even those found at
Jemdet Nasr has been uncovered. [8](sum10.htm#xref_8.md)

This brief survey furnishes a bird's-eye view of the Sumerian
inscriptional finds uncovered and brought to light by legitimate
excavations. [d](sum11.htm#xref_d.md) In addition, scores of thousands of
tablets have been dug up clandestinely by the native Arabs in the mounds
of Sumer, especially in the ancient sites of Larsa, Sippar, and Umma. It
is therefore difficult to estimate the number of Sumerian tablets and
fragments now in the possession of the museums and private collections;
*a quarter of a million* is probably a conservative guess. What now is
the nature of the contents of this vast accumulation of Sumerian
inscriptional material? What significant information can it be expected
to reveal?

In the first place it is important to note that *more than ninety-five
per cent of all the Sumerian tablets are economic in character*, that
is, they consist of notes and receipts, contracts of sale and exchange,
agreements of adoption and partnership, wills and testaments, lists of
workers and

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

wages, letters, etc. Because these documents follow a more or less
expected and traditional pattern which is found also in the Accadian
documents of the same character, their translation, except in the more
complicated cases, is not too difficult. It is the contents of these
tablets which furnish us with a relatively full and accurate picture of
the social and economic structure of Sumerian life in the third
millennium B. C. Moreover, the large quantity of onomastic material to
be found in these economic documents represents a fruitful source for
the study of the ethnic distribution in and about Sumer during this
period. [9](sum10.htm#xref_9.md)

Of the Sumerian inscriptions that are not economic in character, one
group consists of approximately six hundred building and dedicatory
inscriptions on steles, bricks, cones, vases, etc. It is from this
relatively small group of inscriptions that the political history of
Sumer has been largely recovered. The translation of these inscriptions,
too, offers no very great difficulties, since the contents are usually
brief and simple. Moreover, the structure and pattern of the Sumerian
dedicatory inscriptions are followed to a large extent by the later
Accadian building inscriptions; the bilingual material, too, is of
considerable help. All in all, therefore, except in the more complex
instances, the Sumerian historical material is relatively simple to
translate and interpret. [10](sum10.htm#xref_10.md)

In addition to the economic and historical material described above,
there is also a varied and important group of tablets inscribed with
lexical and mathematical texts and with
incantations. [11](sum10.htm#xref_11.md) But by far the most significant
material for the study of Sumerian culture, especially in its more
spiritual aspects, consists of a group of "literary" tablets dated about
1750 B. C. which are inscribed with Sumerian epics and myths, hymns and
lamentations, proverbs and "words of wisdom." And it is important to
note that, in spite of the vast quantity of Sumerian inscriptional
material excavated to date, only some *three thousand*
tablets [b](sum11.htm#xref_b.md) and fragments, no more than one percent,
are inscribed with Sumerian literary compositions. Of these three
thousand

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

pieces, approximately nine hundred are distributed as follows. Some
three hundred very small fragments have been found in Kish by the French
and were published by De Genouillac in 1924. Approximately two hundred
tablets and fragments were bought by the Berlin Museum from dealers;
these were published by Zimmern in 1912-13. Approximately one hundred
were acquired by the Louvre from dealers; these were published by De
Genouillac in 1930. Less than a hundred pieces have found their way to
the British Museum and the Ashmolean Museum; these have been published
in the course of several decades by King, Langdon, and Gadd. To these
must be added an uncertain number (two hundred?) excavated in Ur which
are to be published by Gadd of the British Museum in the near
future. [12](sum10.htm#xref_12.md)

The remaining two thousand and one hundred tablets and fragments, by far
the major part of our Sumerian literary tablets, were excavated by the
University of Pennsylvania at Nippur some fifty years ago. Of this
number, over one hundred have found their way to the University of Jena
in Germany; approximately eight hundred are in the possession of the
Museum of the Ancient Orient in Istanbul; almost eleven hundred are
located in the University Museum at Philadelphia. It is no exaggeration
to state, therefore, that it is the Nippur expedition of the University
of Pennsylvania which is to be credited in large part with the recovery
and restoration of the ancient Sumerian literary compositions as written
down at approximately 1750 B. C. It is well worth noting that these
Sumerian literary creations are significant not only for their
remarkable form and illuminating contents. They are unique, too, in that
they have come down to us as actually written by the scribes of four
thousand years ago, unmodified and uncodified by later redactors with
axes to grind and ideologies to satisfy. *Our Sumerian literary
compositions thus represent the oldest literature of any appreciable and
significant amount ever uncovered*.

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

Let us now examine very briefly the nature of the contents of this
Sumerian literature. As already mentioned, it consists of epics and
myths, hymns and lamentations, proverbs and "wisdom" compositions. Of
the epic tales at least nine can now be restored in large part. Six of
these [commemorate](errata.htm#1.md) the feats and exploits of the great
Sumerian heroes Enmerkar, Lugalbanda, and especially Gilgamesh, the
forerunner of the Greek hero Heracles; these three Sumerian heroes lived
in all probability toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the
third millennium B. C., fully five thousand years ago. The remaining
three epic tales deal with the destruction of Kur, the monstrous
creature which at least in a certain sense corresponds to the Babylonian
goddess Tiamat, the Hebrew Leviathan, and perhaps the Greek Typhon. As
for the myths, their contents, which obviously enough represent the
prime source material for our Sumerian mythology, will be sketched with
considerable detail in the following chapters. Only the Tammuz myths
dealing with the dying deity and his resurrection will be omitted; the
contents are still too obscure for reasonably safe
interpretation. [13](sum10.htm#xref_13.md)

The hymns are both royal and divine. [e](sum11.htm#xref_e.md) The latter
consist of songs of praise and exaltation directed to all the more
important deities of the Sumerian pantheon; they are quite diversified
in size, structure, and content. The royal hymns, frequently
self-laudatory in character, were composed largely for the kings of the
Third Dynasty of Ur and of the Isin Dynasty which followed it. This is a
significant historical fact, for it helps us date the actual composition
of much of our Sumerian literature. The Third Dynasty of Ur reigned
during the last two centuries of the third millennium. B. C.; with the
defeat and capture of their last king Ibi-Sin in approximately 2050 B.
C. Sumer ceased to exist as a political entity. The kings of the Isin
Dynasty which followed were Semites; nevertheless their hymns, like
those of their predecessors, were composed and written in Sumerian,
which continued to be used as the literary and religious language of the
conquerors. [14](sum10.htm#xref_14.md)

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

The lamentation is a type of tragic composition developed by the
Sumerians to commemorate the frequent destruction of their cities by the
surrounding more barbaric peoples; it is the forerunner of such Biblical
compositions as the Book of Lamentations. One large poem, consisting of
more than four hundred lines which lament the destruction of the city of
Ur, has already been restored and published," and a similar composition
dealing with the destruction of Nippur and its restoration is in the
process of being restored. In addition it is now possible to reconstruct

### PLATE II. OLDEST LITERARY CATALOGUE

This plate illustrates a literary catalogue compiled in approximately
2000 B. C. (clay tablet 29.15.155 in the Nippur collection of the
University Museum). The upper part represents the tablet itself; the
lower part, the author's hand copy of the tablet. The titles of those
compositions whose actual contents we can now reconstruct in large part
are as follows:

1\. Hymn of King Shulgi (approximately 2100 B. C.).  
2. Hymn of King Lipit-Ishtar (approximately 1950 B. C.).  
3. Myth, "The Creation of the Pickax" (see [p.
51](sum07.htm#page_51).md).  
4. Hymn to Inanna, queen of heaven.  
5. Hymn to Enlil, the air-god.  
6. Hymn to the temple of the mother-goddess Ninhursag in the city of
Kesh.  
7. Epic tale, "Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Nether World" (see [p.
30](sum07.htm#page_30).md).  
8. Epic tale, "Inanna and Ebih" (see [p. 82](sum08.htm#page_82).md).  
9. Epic tale, "Gilgamesh and Huwawa."  
10. Epic tale, "Gilgamesh and Agga."  
11. Myth, "Cattle and Grain" (see [p. 53](sum07.htm#page_53).md).  
12. Lamentation over the fall of Agade in the time of Naram-Sin
([approximately](errata.htm#2) 2400 B. C..md).  
13. Lamentation over the destruction of Ur. This composition, consisting
of 436 lines, has been almost completely reconstructed and published by
the author as Assyriological Study No. 12 of the Oriental Institute of
the University of Chicago.  
14. Lamentation over the destruction of Nippur.  
15. Lamentation over the destruction of Sumer.

parts of a lamentation over the destruction of Sumer as a whole, and of
another that at present may be best described as the "weeping mother"
type. Finally we now have the larger part of a composition which laments
a calamity that befell the city of Agade during the reign of Naram-Sin
who ruled in the earlier part of the second half of the third millennium
B. C.14

And so we come finally to the wisdom compositions of the Sumerians, the
prototypes of the wisdom literature current all over the Near East and
exemplified by the Biblical *Book of Proverbs*. [f](sum11.htm#xref_f.md)
Sumerian wisdom literature consists of a large number of brief, pithy,
and pointed proverbs and aphorisms; of various fables, such as "The Bird
and the Fish," "The Tree and the Reed," "The Pickax and the Plow,"
"Silver and Bronze"; and finally of a group of didactic compositions,
long and short, several of which are devoted to a description of the
process of learning the scribal art and of the advantages which flow
from it. [14](sum10.htm#xref_14.md)

Some adequate idea of the scope and quantity of Sumerian literature may
be obtained from the contents of a hitherto altogether unknown tablet in
the Nippur collection of the University Museum which I had the good
fortune to identify and decipher in the course of the past year. This
tablet is not a literary composition; it is a literary catalogue. That
is, it lists by title *one* group of Sumerian literary compositions. The
scribe who compiled this list was one of those very scribes of
approximately 2000 B. C. who wrote or copied our Sumerian literary
tablets; the catalogue, therefore, is contemporaneous with the
compositions which it lists. His purpose in compiling the catalogue was
no doubt practical. For as is now clear, by approximately 2000 B. C. a
large number of literary compositions of all types and sizes were
current in Sumer, inscribed on tablets of all shapes and dimensions
which had to be handled, stored, and cared for. Some of the scribes in
charge of the tablets in the temple or palace "tablet house," therefore,
found it convenient to note and list the names of this or that

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

group of literary compositions for purposes of reference essential to
the storing and filing of the respective tablets.

The catalogue tablet is in almost perfect
condition. [g](sum11.htm#xref_g.md) It is quite small, 2½ inches in length
and 1½ inches in width. Small as it is, the scribe, by dividing each
side into two columns and by using a minute script, succeeded in
cataloguing the titles of sixty-two Sumerian literary compositions. The
first forty titles he divided into groups of ten by ruling a dividing
line between numbers 10 and 11, 20 and 21, 30 and 31, 40 and 41. The
remaining twenty-two titles he divided into two unequal groups, the
first consisting of nine, and the second, of thirteen titles. And what
is most interesting, at least twenty-one of the titles which this scribe
listed in his catalogue are of compositions whose actual contents we can
now reconstruct in large part. Needless to say, we probably have the
actual texts of many more compositions whose titles are listed in our
Nippur catalogue. But since the title of a

### FIG. 1. THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUMERIAN SYSTEM OF WRITING

The cuneiform system [17](sum10.htm#xref_17.md) of writing was probably
originated by the Sumerians. The oldest inscriptions unearthed to
date-over one thousand tablets and fragments from the latter half of the
fourth millennium B. C. which were excavated in Erech in very recent
years-are in all likelihood written in the Sumerian language. But
whether or not it was the Sumerians who invented the script, it was
certainly they who in the course of the third millennium B. C. fashioned
it into an effective writing tool. Its practical value was gradually
recognized by the surrounding peoples, who borrowed it from the
Sumerians and adapted it to their own languages. By the second
millennium B. C. it was current all over the Near East.

The cuneiform script began as pictographic writing; each sign was a
picture of one or more concrete objects and represented a word whose
meaning was identical with, or closely related to, the object pictured.
The defects of a system of this type are obvious; the complicated form
of the signs and the huge number of signs required, render it too
unwieldy for practical use. The Sumerian scribes overcame the first
difficulty by gradually simplifying and conventionalizing the form of
the signs until their pictographic origin was no longer apparent. As for
the second difficulty, they reduced the number of signs and kept it
within effective limits by resorting to various helpful devices. The
most significant of these consisted of Substituting phonetic for
ideographic values. The table on the opposite page was prepared for the
purpose of illustrating this two-fold development in the course of the
centuries; a detailed description will be found in note
 [18](sum10.htm#xref_18.md).

\[paragraph continues\] Sumerian literary composition consists usually
of the first part of the first line of the composition, there is no way
of knowing the titles of those whose texts we have in large part but
whose first lines are broken away. It goes without saying that the
sixty-two titles listed in our catalogue do not exhaust the number of
literary compositions current in Sumer at the end of the third
millennium B. C. There is every indication that this number runs into
the hundreds. Should the ancient city of Eridu in southern Sumer, the
cult center of Enki, the Sumerian god of wisdom, ever be thoroughly
excavated, there is good reason to believe that our store of Sumerian
literary compositions will be considerably
enlarged. [16](sum10.htm#xref_16.md)

So much for the scope and contents of Sumerian literature. Let us now
turn to the problem of dating in order to see what justifies the
statement made in the preceding pages that Sumerian literature
represents the oldest written literature of any significant amount ever
uncovered. The tablets

### PLATE III. NIPPUR ARCHAIC CYLINDER

To judge from the script, the Nippur cylinder illustrated on this plate
(8383 in the Nippur collection of the University Museum) may date as
early as 2500 B. C. Although copied and published by the late George
Barton as early as 1918, [20](sum10.htm#xref_20.md) its contents, which
center about the Sumerian air-god Enlil and the goddess Ninhursag, are
still largely unintelligible. Nevertheless, much that was unknown or
misunderstood at the time of its publication is now gradually becoming
clarified, and there is good reason to hope that the not too distant
future will see the better part of its contents ready for translation.

### PLATE IV. GUDEA CYLINDER

This plate (from E. de Sarzec, *Découvertes en Chaldée* (Paris,
1889-1912), pl. 37) illustrates one of the two Gudea cylinders dating
from approximately 2250 B. C. They were excavated by the French at
Lagash more than half a century ago, and both cylinders are now in the
Louvre. They are inscribed with long hymns to the god Ningirsu (another
name for the god Ninurta--see [p. 80](sum08.htm#page_80).md) and his temple
in Lagash. The style of the composition is highly advanced and points to
a long preceding period of development, in which much literary material
must have been composed and written down. The contents of the two Gudea
cylinders were carefully copied and translated by the eminent French
Assyriologist, Thureau-Dangin, as early as the first decade of our
century. [19](sum10.htm#xref_19.md) The Sumerological advance of the past
several decades, however, makes a new translation imperative.

themselves, to judge from the script as well as from internal evidence,
were inscribed in the Early Post-Sumerian period, the period following
immediately upon the fall of the Third Dynasty of Ur. Just as a rough
point of reference, therefore, the actual writing of the tablets may be
dated approximately 1750 B. C. [a](sum11.htm#xref_a.md) As for the
composition of their contents, to judge from the large group of hymns
devoted to the kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur, much of it actually
took place in that Neo-Sumerian period which lasted approximately from
2150 to 2050 B. C. [h](sum11.htm#xref_h.md) Moreover, an analysis of the
contents of the hymns inscribed on the so-called Gudea
cylinders, [19](sum10.htm#xref_19.md) which date from approximately 2250 B.
C., and of the myth inscribed on an archaic Nippur cylinder published by
George Barton, [20](sum10.htm#xref_20.md) which, to judge from its script,
dates considerably earlier than the Gudea cylinders, clearly indicates
that not a little of the hymnal and mythological material had already
been composed several centuries earlier. Finally, an analysis of the
religious concepts as revealed in the building and dedicatory
inscriptions of the classical Sumerian period, roughly 2600-2400 B. C.,
leads to the same conclusion. In short we are amply justified in stating
that although practically all our available Sumerian literary tablets
actually date from approximately 2000 B. C., a large part of the written
literature of the Sumerians was created and developed in the latter half
of the third millennium B. C. The fact that so little literary material
from these earlier periods has been excavated to date is in large part a
matter of archaeological accident. Had it not been, for example, for the
Nippur expedition, we would have very little Sumerian literary material
from the early post-Sumerian period.

Now let us compare this date with that of the various ancient
literatures known to us at present. In Egypt, for example, one might
have expected an ancient written literature commensurate with its high
cultural development. And, indeed, to judge from the pyramid
inscriptions, the Egyptians in all probability did have a well developed
written

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

literature in the third millennium B. C. Unfortunately it must have been
written largely on papyrus, a readily perishable material, and there is
little hope that enough of it will ever be recovered to give a
reasonably adequate cross-section of the Egyptian literature of that
ancient period. Then, too, there is the hitherto unknown ancient
Canaanite literature which has been found inscribed on tablets excavated
in the past decade by the French at Rash-esh-Shamra in northern Syria.
These tablets, relatively few in number, indicate that the Canaanites,
too, had a highly developed literature at one time. They are dated
approximately 1400 B. C., that is, they were inscribed over half a
millennium *later* than our Sumerian literary
tablets. [21](sum10.htm#xref_21.md) As for the Semitic Babylonian
literature as exemplified by such works as the "Epic of Creation," the
"Epic of Gilgamesh," etc., it is not only considerably later than our
Sumerian literature, but also includes much that is borrowed directly
from it. [22](sum10.htm#xref_22.md)

We turn now to the ancient literatures which have exercised the most
profound influence on the more spiritual aspects of our civilization.
These are the Bible, which contains the literary creations of the
Hebrews; the Iliad and Odyssey, which are filled with the epic and
mythic lore of the Greeks; the Rig-veda, which contains the literary
products of ancient India; and the Avesta, which contains those of
ancient Iran. None of these literary collections were written down in
their present form before the first half of the first millennium B. C.
Our Sumerian literature, inscribed on tablets dating from approximately
2000 B. C., therefore antedates these literatures by more than a
millennium. Moreover, there is another vital difference. The texts of
the Bible, of the Iliad and Odyssey, and of the Rig-veda and Avesta, as
we have them, have been modified, edited, and redacted by compilers and
redactors with varied motives and diverse points of view. Not so our
Sumerian literature; it has come down to us as actually inscribed by the
ancient scribes of four thousand years ago, unmodified and uncodified by
later compilers and commentators.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

And so we come to the crucial point. The basic value of Sumerian
literature and its fundamental importance for the related humanities
being obvious, why has it remained largely unknown; why has it not been
made available to scholar and layman? What has hampered and impeded the
decipherment of the Sumerian literary tablets? Why has so little
progress been made in the reconstruction and translation of their
contents? The factors responsible for this unfortunate situation are
twofold: *linguistic*, the difficulties presented by the grammar and
vocabulary of the Sumerian language; and *textual*, the problems arising
out of the physical characteristics of our source material.

First, the linguistic difficulties. Sumerian is neither a Semitic nor an
Indo-European language. It belongs to the so-called agglutinative type
of languages exemplified by Turkish, Hungarian, and Finnish. None of
these languages, however, seems to have any closer affiliation to
Sumerian, and the latter, therefore, as yet stands alone and unrelated
to any known language living or dead. Its decipherment, therefore, would
have been an impossible task, were it not for the fortunate fact already
mentioned that the Semitic conquerors of Sumer not only adapted its
script to their own Semitic tongue, but also retained it as their
literary and religious language. As a consequence, the scribal schools
in Babylonia and Assyria made the study of Sumerian their basic
discipline. They therefore compiled what may be described as *bilingual*
syllabaries or dictionaries in which the Sumerian words or phrases were
translated into their own language, Accadian. In addition they also drew
up *interlinears* of the Sumerian literary compositions in which each
Sumerian line is followed by its Accadian translation. Accadian, being a
Semitic tongue related to numerous known languages, was deciphered
relatively early. And so these bilinguals became the basic material for
the decipherment of Sumerian, for by comparing the known Accadian word
or phrase with the corresponding Sumerian, the meaning of the latter
could be deduced.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

Now while all this sounds relatively simple on paper, in actual practice
the decipherment of Sumerian from the bilingual texts has resulted in
many grammatical and lexical misunderstandings. For Accadian and
Sumerian are as divergent in vocabulary and structure as two languages
can be, and the seeming correspondences in the ancient dictionaries and
interlinears frequently proved very misleading, especially since not a
few of the earlier decipherers, for one reason or another, tended to
draw hasty and superficial conclusions. As a consequence so many errors
crept into Sumerian grammar and vocabulary that when scholars were
presented with some of our *unilingual* literary tablets, that is with
the tablets inscribed in Sumerian only, the resulting efforts proved
largely unproductive. Indeed in many cases the attempted translations
were almost entirely untrustworthy and dangerously misleading. It is
only in the last

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### PLATE V. "CHICAGO" SYLLABARY

The dictionaries and syllabaries compiled by the Babylonian scribes to
aid their study of the Sumerian language, which formed their basic
discipline, varied considerably in make-up and structure. One of the
most useful types is the "Chicago" syllabary, a scientific edition of
which was recently published by Richard Hallock, of the Oriental
Institute. [23](sum10.htm#xref_23.md) It is illustrated on plate V, which
is reproduced here by permission of the University of Chicago Press. It
was inscribed in the latter part of the first millennium B. C., although
the indications are that it was actually compiled sometime in the second
[millennium](errata.htm#3.md) B. C. Each side of the tablet is divided into
two halves, and each half is subdivided into four columns. The second
column contains the cuneiform sign to be explained, while the third
column gives the name by which the Babylonian scribes identified it. The
first column writes out phonetically the Sumerian word which the sign
represents, while the fourth column gives its Semitic translation.

### PLATE VI. NIPPUR GRAMMATICAL TEXT

This plate (from Arno Poebel, *Historical and Grammatical Texts*
(Philadelphia, 1914), pl. CXXII) illustrates another type of lexical
text devised by the Semitic scribes to further their knowledge of
Sumerian. It is primarily *grammatical* in character. The tablet
originally contained 16 columns. Each column is subdivided into two
halves. The left half contains a Sumerian grammatical unit, such as a
substantive or verbal complex, while the right half gives its Semitic
translation. This tablet is much older than the "Chicago" syllabary; it
belongs to the same period as our literary material, approximately 2000
B. C. [24](sum10.htm#xref_24.md)

two decades, largely as a result of Arno Poebel's *Grundzüge der
Sumerischen Grammatik* [25](sum10.htm#xref_25.md) that Sumerian grammar has
been put on a scientific basis. As for the lexical problems, these still
remain serious and far from resolved. [26](sum10.htm#xref_26.md)

But troublesome and distressing as the *linguistic* problems frequently
are in the process of reconstructing and translating our literary
tablets, they are not insuperable. The major impeding factor, the most
serious stumbling block, is the *textual* problem. Tablets, and
especially those inscribed with the Sumerian literary compositions which
are largely unbaked, rarely come out whole from the ground. Usually they
are in a fragmentary, and not infrequently in a *very* fragmentary
condition. Offsetting this disadvantage is the happy fact that the
ancient scribes made more than one copy of any given composition. The
breaks in one tablet may therefore frequently be restored from
duplicating pieces which may themselves be mere broken fragments. Thus
in the case of "Inanna's Descent to the Nether World" (see [p.
83](sum08.htm#page_83).md), I utilized fourteen different fragments. In the
case of the recently published "Lamentation Over the Destruction of
Ur," [15](sum10.htm#xref_15.md) the text was reconstructed from twenty-two
different fragments. And in reconstructing "The Feats and Exploits of
Ninurta" (see [p. 80](sum08.htm#page_80).md), I utilized 49 different
fragments. To take full advantage of these duplications and the
consequent restorations, however, it is essential to have as much as
possible of the source material copied and available. But of the Nippur
literary tablets excavated by the University of Pennsylvania and now
located in Istanbul and Philadelphia, some *two thousand* in number,
only about *five hundred* have been copied and published to date. And
while all of the approximately seven hundred pieces in the British
Museum, Louvre, Berlin Museum, and Ashmolean Museum have been copied and
published, [12](sum10.htm#xref_12.md) some of the more important texts did
not appear until a relatively recent date. Under these circumstances,
the trustworthy and scientific reconstruction and translation of our
Sumerian literary compositions on any major scale was obviously
impossible.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

I first realized this situation and its implications in 1933, almost a
decade ago, while working in the Oriental Institute of the University of
Chicago as a member of its Assyrian Dictionary staff. For in that year
died Edward Chiera, the scholar who copied more of the Nippur literary
material than all others combined. Long a member of the faculty of the
University of Pennsylvania, he devoted much of his time and energy
during his stay there to the copying of more than two hundred literary
tablets and fragments in the University [Museum](errata.htm#4.md). Later,
when called to the rapidly expanding Oriental Institute of the
University of Chicago as head of its Assyrian Dictionary project, he
took his copies with him, and the Oriental Institute undertook to
publish them in two volumes. Upon Chiera's untimely death, the editorial
department of the Oriental Institute entrusted me with the preparation
of these two posthumous volumes for publication. [27](sum10.htm#xref_27.md)
As the significance of the contents dawned upon me, I realized that all
efforts to translate and interpret the material would remain
scientifically inadequate unless and until more of the uncopied and
unpublished material lying in Istanbul and Philadelphia should be made
available.

From that day to this I have concentrated all my efforts on the
reconstruction and translation of the Sumerian literary compositions.
After devoting years to a thorough study of the Sumerian idiom, I
travelled to Istanbul in 1937 and spent some twenty months in the Museum
of the Ancient Orient, where I copied one hundred and seventy Sumerian
literary tablets and fragments from its Nippur collection; unfortunately
this still leaves approximately *five hundred* pieces in this Museum
uncopied and unavailable. Since returning to the United States in 1939,
I have devoted practically all my time and energy to the Sumerian
literary tablets and fragments in the Nippur collection of our
University Museum. I thus succeeded in identifying approximately *six
hundred and seventy-five* uncopied and unpublished Sumerian literary
pieces in the collection, almost twice as much as all the literary
material copied and published

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

by numerous scholars working in the Museum in the course of the past
four decades. Of these six hundred and seventy-five pieces,
approximately one hundred and seventy-five are inscribed with epic and
mythological material; some three hundred are hymnal in character; fifty
are parts of lamentations; the remaining one hundred and fifty are
inscribed with proverbs and "wisdom" compositions.

In the past two years my efforts were concentrated largely on the epics
and myths. By utilizing all the available published material, together
with that part of the unpublished material which I copied in the Museum
of the Ancient Orient at Istanbul and all the relevant unpublished
material in the University Museum at Philadelphia, I succeeded in
reconstructing the larger parts of the texts of twenty-four Sumerian
epics and myths; [28](sum10.htm#xref_28.md) this is the basic source
material for the restoration of Sumerian mythology to be sketched in the
following chapters. As for the scientific edition of these epics and
myths, that is, editions consisting of the reconstructed Sumerian texts
with line by line translations and commentary, these are now in the
process of preparation; unless the work is unexpectedly interrupted,
they should be completed in the course of the coming two or three years.
