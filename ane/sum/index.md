# Sumerian Mythology

## By Samuel Noah Kramer

#### \[1944, 1961\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sumerians were a non-Semitic, non-Indo-European people who lived in
southern Babylonia from 4000-3000 B.C.E. They invented cunieform
writing, and their spiritual beliefs influenced all successive Near
Eastern religions, including Judaism, Christianity and Islam. They
produced an extensive body of literature, among the oldest in the world.
Samuel Noah Kramer spent most of his life studying this literature, by
piecing together clay tablets in far-flung museums. This short work
gives translations or summaries of the most important Sumerian myths.
