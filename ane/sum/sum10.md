<span id="xref_1">1</span>. The extant text of this poem, which we may
entitle "The Epic of Enmerkar," is reconstructed from the following
tablets and fragments: *CBS* 29.13.194, 29.16.422; *PBS V* 8; *PBS XIII*
8; *SEM* 14, 16; *SRT* 34. The following pieces may also belong to this
composition: *BE XXXI* 44 (*cf*. Kramer, *JAOS* 60.250); *CBS* 2291,
7859; *HAV* 9. "The Epic of Enmerkar" is to be kept distinct from
another epic tale concerned with the same Enmerkar, which we may entitle
"Enmerkar and Enmushkeshdanna." The extant text of the latter poem is
reconstructed from the following tablets and fragments: Ni 2283; *PBS V*
9, 10; *SEM* 13, 18, 19. The following pieces also probably belong to
it: *CBS* 29.16.450; *HAV* 17; *SEM* 17. In *SL* 320 I assumed that we
had but one epic composition

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

dealing with the exploits of Enmerkar in the course of subjugating
Aratta to Erech. It now seems more likely that we actually have two such
epic tales. The first, described in *SL* as the "larger portion,"
corresponds to the poem designated above as "The Epic of Enmerkar"; the
second, described in *SL* as the "smaller portion," corresponds to the
one designated "Enmerkar and Enmushkeshdanna." Note also that the number
of pieces identified as belonging to these two poems is 20, not 25, as
stated in *SL* 320.

There was no lion, there was no *wild dog*, no wolf,  
There was no fear, no terror,  
Man had no rival.

In those days the land Shubur (East), the place of plenty, of righteous
decrees,  
*Harmony-tongued* Sumer (South), the great land of the "decrees of

Uri (North), the land having all that is *needful*,

<span id="xref_3">3</span>. The term Accadian is now generally applied
to the Semitic language spoken in the countries commonly known as
Assyria and Babylonia; Assyrian and Babylonian, the terms formerly used
to designate this language, are the names of the two best-known dialects
of the Accadian language.

<span id="xref_4">4</span>. No satisfactory history of Sumer and the
Sumerians has as yet been written. However, the interested reader will
obtain a relatively adequate orientation in respect to the fundamental
pattern of Sumerian history and its basic problems by examining such
works as: L. W. King, *A History of Sumer and Akkad* (London, 1910);
*The Cambridge Ancient History*, Vol. I (1923; especially chapters X-XII
by Stephen Langdon);

A. Speiser, *Mesopotamian Origins: The Basic Population of the Near
East* (Philadelphia, 1930); Henri Frankfort, *Archaeology and the
Sumerian Problem* (Oriental Institute Studies in Ancient-Oriental
Civilization, No. 4; Chicago, 1932); W. F. Albright, *From the Stone Age
to Christianity* (Baltimore, 1940). The reader will find that the
statements formulated in these volumes not infrequently show serious
divergences, inconsistencies, and contradictions; he is asked to bear in
mind that the pertinent source material is highly complex in character
and that its study and interpretation are still in a continuous and
progressive state of flux.

<span id="xref_5">5</span>. For a more detailed sketch of the
decipherment of the cuneiform system of writing, *cf*. E. A. Wallis
Budge, *The Rise and Progress of Assyriology* (London, 1925); the reader
will also find here an excellent pertinent bibliography. For the
decipherment of Sumerian in particular, *cf*. F. H. Weissbach, *Zur
Lösung der Sumerischen Frage* (Leipzig, 1897). As a matter of historical
curiosity it is noteworthy to mention that in spite of all evidence to
the contrary, the well-known orientalist, J. Halévy, continued to deny
the existence of a Sumerian people and language in Mesopotamia, as late
as the first decade of the twentieth century. According to his biased
and subjectively motivated views, no people other than the Semites had
ever been in possession of Babylonia. As for the so-called Sumerian
language, it was merely an artificial invention of the Semites,
themselves, devised for hieratic and esoteric purposes.

<span id="xref_6">6</span>. The first forty thousand tablets were
discovered by the Arab workers while De Sarzec, the excavator, happened
to be away from the mound. They succeeded in getting them all into the
hands of dealers, and as a result, there is no important collection in
Europe or America which does not have some Lagash tablets. In the Museum
of the Ancient Orient, the tablets excavated at Lagash in the course of
the years are stacked high in drawer after drawer; it is difficult to
estimate their number but it may be close to 100,000.

days is C. J. Gadd and L. Legrain, *Royal Inscriptions* (Publications of

literary tablets are naturally to be found in other collections. The
Yale Babylonian Collection, especially, as Professors Stephens and
Goetze inform me, has accumulated quite a number of Sumerian literary
tablets, bought from the hands of dealers. No doubt many of these were
dug up in Nippur.

<span id="xref_17">17</span>. Following are the major studies concerned
with the origin and development of the cuneiform system of writing: F.
Thureau-Dangin, *Recherches sur l’origine de l’ecriture cunéiforme*
(Paris, 1898); G. A. Barton, *The Origin and Development of Babylonian
Writing* (*BA IX*); A. Deimel, Liste der archäischen Keilschriftzeichen
(Wissenschaftliche Veröffentlichungen der Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft,
Bd. 40; Leipzig, 1922); E. Unger, *Die Keilschrift* (Leipzig, 1929); A.
Falkenstein, *Archäische Texte aus Uruk* (Ausgrabungen der Deutschen
Forschungsgerneinschaft in Uruk-Warka, Bd. 2; Leipzig, 1936).

<span id="xref_18">18</span>. If, proceeding from top to bottom, we
examine the first column of the table ([fig. 1](sum05.htm#img_fig01).md),
we note the following:

No. 1 is the picture of a star; it represents primarily the Sumerian
word *an*, "heaven." The very same sign, however, is used to represent
the word *dingir*, "god."

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

No. 2 represents the word *ki*, "earth." Obviously it is intended to be
a picture of the earth, although the interpretation of the sign is still
uncertain.

No. 3 is probably a more or less stylized picture of the upper part of a
man's body; it represents the word *lu*, "man."

No. 4 is a picture of the pudenda; it represents the word *sal*,
"pudenda." The same sign is used to represent the word *munus*, "woman."

No. 5 is the picture of a mountain; it represents the word *kur*, whose
primary meaning is "mountain."

No. 6 illustrates an ingenious device developed early by the inventors
of the Sumerian system of writing, whereby they were enabled to
represent pictorially words for which the ordinary pictographic
representation entailed a certain amount of difficulty. As the reader
will note, the sign for the word *geme*, "slave-girl," is actually a
combination of two signs, that for *munus*, "woman," and that for *kur*,
"mountain"; that is, of signs 4 and 5 on our table. Literally,
therefore, this compound sign expresses the idea "mountain-woman." But
since the Sumerians obtained their slave-girls largely from the
mountainous regions about them, this compound sign adequately
represented the Sumerian word for "slave-girl," *geme*.

No. 7 is the picture of a head; it represents the Sumerian word *sag*,
"head."

No. 8 is also the picture of a head; the vertical strokes, however,
underline the particular part of the head which is intended, that is,
the mouth. This sign, therefore, represents the Sumerian word *ka*,
"mouth." The same sign naturally enough represents the word *dug*, "to
speak."

No. 9 is probably the picture of a bowl used primarily as a
food-container; it represents the word *ninda*, "food."

No. 10 is actually a compound sign consisting of the signs for mouth and
food (nos. 8 and 9 on our table); it represents the word *ku*, "to eat."

No. 11 is a picture of a water stream; it represents the word *a*,
"water." This sign furnishes an excellent illustration of the process by
which the Sumerian script gradually lost its unwieldy pictographic
character and became a phonetic system of writing. As just said, the
sign no. 11 was used primarily to represent the Sumerian word a,
"water." However, the Sumerians had another word a which was identical
in pronunciation with the word *a*, "water," but which had the entirely
different meaning "in." Now this word "in" is a word denoting
relationship and stands for a concept which is very difficult to express
pictographically. To the originators of the Sumerian script then came
the ingenious idea that instead of trying to invent a necessarily highly
complicated picture-sign to represent the word "in," they could use the
sign for *a*, "water," since both words sounded exactly alike. In other
words, the early Sumerian scribes came to realize that a sign originally
belonging to a given word could be used for another word with an
altogether unrelated

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

meaning, if the sound of the two words were identical. With the gradual
spreading of this practice, the Sumerian script lost its pictographic
character and tended more and more to become a purely phonetic script.

No. 12 is a combination of the signs for "mouth" and "water" (nos. 8 and
11); it represents the word *nag*, "to drink."

No. 13 is a picture of the lower part of the leg and foot in walking
position; it represents the word *du*, "to go," and also the word *gub*,
"to stand."

No. 14 is a picture of a bird; it represents the word *mushen*, "bird."

No. 15 is a picture of a fish; it represents the word *ha*, "fish." This
sign furnishes another example of the phonetic development of the
Sumerian script. For the Sumerian word *ha* not only had the meaning
"fish" but also "may"; that is, the Sumerians had two words *ha* which
were identical in pronunciation but quite unrelated in meaning. And so,
early in the development of the script the Sumerian scribes began to use
the sign for *ha*, "fish," to represent the phonetically identical *ha*,
"may," just as in the case of sign no. 11 they used the sign for *a*,
"water," to represent the word *a*, "in."

No. 16 is a picture of the head and horns of an ox; it represents the
word *gud*, "ox."

No. 17 is a picture of the head of a cow; it represents the word *ab*,
"cow."

No. 18 is the picture of an ear of barley; it represents the word *še*,
"barley."

The signs in the first column which we have examined in detail are from
the earliest period in the development of Sumerian writing known to
date. Not long after the invention of the pictographic script, however,
the Sumerian scribes found it convenient to turn the tablet in such a
way that the pictographs lay on their backs. As the writing developed,
this practice became standard and the signs were regularly turned 90
degrees. The second column in our tablet gives the pictographic signs in
this turned position. To judge from our present data and speaking very
roughly, this pictographic script may be dated 3200-2800 B. C. The third
column of our table represents what may be termed the "archaic" script,
dated roughly 2800-2600 B. C. The fourth column contains the sign-forms
of the classical period, 2600-2450 B. C.; the inscriptions of this
period contain the purest Sumerian known to date. The Nippur archaic
cylinder ([plate III](sum05.htm#img_pl03).md), inscribed with the oldest
myth known, probably belongs to the very end of this period.

The fifth column contains the sign-forms of the Sargonid period, roughly
2450-2150 B. C.; it is in this period that the Sumerians met with
serious defeats at the hands of the Semites and the Guti. A brief
renaissance of Sumerian power followed in the Neo-Sumerian period,
roughly 2150-2050 B. C. The sixth column represents the Sumerian

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

script of this period. With the destruction of the city of Ur, about
2050 B. C., Sumer practically ceased to exist as a political entity. The
period that followed, roughly 2050-1700 B. C., is known as the "early
post-Sumerian." During this period Sumerian, though no longer a living
language, was retained as the literary and religious language of the
Semitic conquerors. It is in this period that by far the greater part of
our source material was inscribed, though much of it may have been
composed considerably earlier; the seventh column contains the
sign-forms then used. The last column illustrates the script as used
largely in the first millennium B. C. by the royal scribes of Assyria.
It is primarily this late, highly conventionalized script which the
European scholars of the nineteenth century first studied and
deciphered. And illogically enough, to this very day, this is the script
with which students of cuneiform begin their studies.

Sumerian mythological concepts. However, because of the limited material
available at

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

the time and because of the ubiquitous linguistic difficulties, much of
the material there outlined is quite untrustworthy and misleading.

<span id="xref_31">31</span>. To date, however, it must be frankly
admitted, relatively little of this glyptic material can be interpreted
with any approach to certainty. Frequently we can neither identify the
gods depicted on the designs, nor interpret even roughly the acts
pictured and their implications. It is quite unlikely that, with the
limited space and means at their disposal, the seal-cutters attempted to
portray a connected story such as that told in "Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and
the Nether World" or in "Inanna's Descent to the Nether World." And if,
in order to overcome their limitations, they developed a system of
abbreviation and conventionalization, we are not yet in a position to
penetrate it. And so, in spite of the fact that so much intelligible
Sumerian mythological material has now become available, very few of the
cylinder seal designs can be identified with the stories told in our
epics and myths. Nevertheless, as plates [VI](sum05.htm#img_pl06.md),
[IX](sum07.htm#img_pl09), [XI](sum07.htm#img_pl11.md),
[XIII](sum07.htm#img_pl13), and [XVIII](sum07.htm#img_pl18.md) show, some
of this glyptic material is most revealing and instructive. Except for
the first two designs on plate [XVIII](sum07.htm#img_pl18.md), all the
illustrations are taken from *Cylinder Seals*, a book recently published
by Henri Frankfort, of the Oriental Institute of the University of
Chicago, who is the leading living authority on the subject.

Semitic poem and its Sumerian forerunners, *cf*. my comment in *JAOS*
63.69-73.

<span id="xref_75">75</span>. *Cf*. *ATU* 14.

<span id="xref_76">76</span>. The text of this epic, known to
Babylonians by the name *lugal* (or
*lugal-e*)*-u<sub>4</sub>-me-lám-bi-nir-gál*, is reconstructed from the
following tablets and fragments: *AO* 4135 (= *RA* 11.82); *BE XXIX* 2,
3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13; *BE XXXI* 8, 32; *CBS* 1205, 2161, 2166, 2347, 7842,
7994, 8243, 13876, 15086, 29.13.583, 29.13.699, 29.16.223, 29.16.422,
29.16.439, 29.16.453; K 133 (= *ASKT* pp. 79 ff.; for duplicate, *cf*.
*ATU* 14, p. 264); K 1299 (= *ATU* I 4, p. 361); K 2862 + (= *4R* pl. 13
+ additions); K 2863 (= *4R* pl. 23, no. 2); K 2871 (= *MVAG VIII* pl.
13; *cf*. pp. 676 ff.); *KAR* 13, 14, 17, 25, 363; Ni 1183, 2339, 2743,
2764; SBH 71; *SEM* 25, 32, 36, 38; *SRT* 18, 20, 21; VAT 251 (*KGV* pl.
60). In addition to these 49 pieces, 30 published and 19 unpublished,
which can now be placed in their proper position in the epic, we have
the following pieces which probably belong to the poem but are still
unplaceable: *CBS* 8476, 10321, 13103, 15088, 15120; *BE XXIX* 12; K
4827 (= *MVAG VIII* pl. 1); *cf*. also my comment to *BE XXXI* 9 in
*JAOS* 60.239. The following groups form "joins": 29.16.242 + 29.16.439;
1205 + *BE XXIX* 8; 7842 + *SEM* 38. Particularly significant and
gratifying is the placing of *BE XXIX* 2, and 3, which describe the
misfortune that befell "the land" after Ninurta had succeeded in
destroying Kur; they begin with approximately line 261 of the epic. For
the confusion involved the listing of the <sup>giš</sup>al texts as part
of this epic (*SEM* p. 3), *cf*. my comment in *JAOS* 60.239, note 15.

<span id="xref_87">87</span>. Following is the transliteration and
translation of the marked passage on no. 8 of [plate
XX](sum08.htm#img_pl20.md), which contains the very beginning of the poem:

1\. *an-gal-ta ki-gal-šè geštug-ga-ni na-an-gub*  
2. *AN an-gal-ta ki-gal-šè geštug-ga-ni na-an-gub*  
3. *<sup>d</sup>inanna an-gal-ta ki-gal-šè geštug-ga-ni na-an-gub*  
4. *nin-mu an mu-un-šub ki mu-un-šub kur-ra ba-e-a-e<sub>11</sub>*  
5. *<sup>d</sup>inanna an mu-un-šub ki mu-un-šub kur-ra
ba-e-a-e<sub>11</sub>*  
6. *nam-en mu-un-šub nam-nin mu-un-šub kur-ra ba-e-a-e<sub>11</sub>*

From the "great above" she set her mind toward the "great below,"  
The *goddess*, from the "great above" she set her mind toward, the
"great below,"  
Inanna, from the "great above" she set her mind toward the "great
below."

My lady abandoned heaven, abandoned earth, to the nether world she
descended,  
Inanna abandoned heaven, abandoned earth, to the nether world she
descended,  
Abandoned lordship, abandoned ladyship, to the nether world she
descended.

Following is a transliteration and translation of the marked passage on
no. 13 which describes the death of the goddess:

1\. *kug-<sup>d</sup>ereš-ki-gal-la-ke<sub>4</sub>
<sup>giš</sup>gu-za-na i-ni-in-tuš*  
2. *<sup>d</sup>a-nun-na di-kud-imin-bi igi-ni-šè di mu-un-ši-in-kud*  
3. *i-bí mu-ši-in-bar i-bí-úš-a-kam*  
4. *inim-ma-ne-ne inim-LIPIŠ-gig-ga-àm*  
5. \[*munus*\]*-tu-ra uzu-níg-sìg-šè ba-an-tu*  
6. *uzu-níg-sìg-ga <sup>giš</sup>kak-ta hi ba-da-an-lá*  
7. *u<sub>4</sub>-3 gi<sub>6</sub>-3 um-ta-zal-la-ta*

The pure Ereshkigal seated herself upon her throne, <span
id="page_119">p. 119</span>  
The Anunnaki, the seven judges, pronounced judgment before her,  
They fastened their eyes upon her, the eyes of death.  
At their word, the word which tortures the spirit,  
The sick \["woman"\] was turned into a corpse,  
The corpse was hung from a stake.  
After three days and three nights had passed,

The poem then continues with the efforts of Inanna's messenger,
Ninshubur, to have the gods bring her back to life. Enki intervenes and
Inanna is resurrected. The last three lines of this resurrection passage
read:

1\. *60 ú-nam-ti-la 60 a-nam-ti-la ugu-na bí-in-šub-bu-uš*  
2. *<sup>d</sup>inanna ba-gub*  
3. *<sup>d</sup>inanna kur-ta ba-e<sub>11</sub>-dè*

*Sixty times*, the food of life, *sixty times*, the water of life, they
sprinkled upon it (Inanna's dead body),  
Inanna arose.  
Inanna ascends from the nether world.
