OF the three tablets in this section, the first one is very uncertain,
and is put together from two separate sources; the other two are more
complete and satisfactory.

<span class="smallcaps">Tablet</span> VIII.

I am uncertain again if I have discovered any of this tablet; I
provisionally place here some fragments of the first, second, third, and
sixth columns of a tablet which may belong to it, but the only fragment
worth translating at present is one I have given in "Assyrian
Discoveries," p. 176. In some portions of these fragments there are
references, as I have there stated, to the story of Humbaba, but as

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

the fragment appears to refer to the illness of Izdubar I think it
belongs here.

The second, third, fourth and fifth columns appear to be entirely
absent, the inscription reappearing on a fragment of the sixth column.

9\. He spake and said to his friend:

10\. Friend thou dost not ask me why I am naked,

11\. thou dost not inquire of me why I am spoiled,

12\. God will not depart, why do my limbs burn.

13\. Friend I saw a third dream,

14\. and the dream which I saw entirely disappeared,

15\. He invoked the god of the earth and desired death.

16\. A storm came out of the darkness,

17\. the lightning struck and kindled a fire,

18\. and came out the shadow of death.

19\. It disappeared, the fire sank,

20\. he struck it and it turned to a palm tree,

21\. . . . and in the desert thy lord was proceeding.

22\. And Heabani the dream considered and said to Izdubar.

The fourth and fifth columns of this tablet are lost. This part of the
legend appears to refer to the illness of Izdubar.

It must here be noted that my grounds for making this the eighth tablet
are extremely doubtful, it is possible that the fragments are of
different tablets; but they fill up an evident blank in the story here,
and I have inserted them pending further discoveries as to their true
position.

In the first column Heabani appears to be addressing certain trees, and
they are supposed to have the power of hearing and answering him.
Heabani praises one tree and sneers at another, but from the mutilation
of the text it does not appear why he acts so. I conjecture he was
seeking a charm to open the door he mentions, and that according to the
story this charm was known to the trees. The fragment of the sixth
column shows Heabani unable to interpret a dream, while Izdubar asks his
friend to fight.

After this happened the violent death of Heabani, which added to the
misfortunes of Izdubar; but no fragment of this part of the story is
preserved.

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Tablet</span> IX.

This tablet is in a somewhat better state than the others, and all the
narrative is clearer from this point, not a single column of the
inscription being entirely lost. The ninth tablet commences with the
sorrow of Izdubar at the death of Heabani.

<span class="smallcaps">Column</span> I.

1\. Izdubar over Heabani his seer

2\. bitterly lamented, and lay down on the ground.

3\. I had no judgment like Heabani;

4\. Weakness entered into my soul;

5\. death I feared, and lay down on the ground.

6\. For the advice of Hasisadra, son of Ubaratutu

7\. The road I was taking, and joyfully I went,

8\. to the neighbourhood of the mountains I took at night.

9\. a dream I saw, and I feared.

10\. I bowed on my face, and to Sin (the moon god) I prayed;

11\. and into the presence of the gods came my supplication;

12\. and they sent peace unto me.

13\. . . . . . . dream.

14\. . . . . . Sin, erred in life.

15\. precious stones . . . to his hand.

16\. were bound to his girdle

17\. like the time . . . their . . . he struck

18\. he struck . . . . fruit? he broke

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

19\. and. . . .

20\. he threw . . . .

21\. he was guarded . . .

22\. the former name . . . .

23\. the new name . . . .

24\. he carried . . . .

25\. to. . . .

(About six lines lost here.)

The second column shows Izdubar in some fabulous region, whither he has
wandered in search of Hasisadra. Here he sees composite monsters with
their feet resting in hell, and their heads reaching heaven. These
beings are supposed to guide and direct the sun at its rising and
setting. This passage is as follows:—

<span class="smallcaps">Column</span> II.

1\. Of the country hearing him . . . .

2\. To the mountains of Mas in his course . . . .

3\. who each day guard the rising sun.

4\. Their crown was at the lattice of heaven,

5\. under hell their feet were placed.

6\. The scorpion-man guarded the gate,

7\. burning with terribleness, their appearance was like death,

8\. the might of his fear shook the forests.

9\. At the rising of the sun and the setting of the sun, they guarded
the sun.

10\. Izdubar saw them and fear and terror came into his face.

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

11\. Summoning his resolution he approached before them.

12\. The scorpion-man of his female asked:

13\. Who comes to us with the affliction of god on his body

14\. To the scorpion-man his female answered:

15\. The work of god is laid upon the man,

16\. The scorpion-man of the hero asked,

17\. . . . . of the gods the word he said:

18\. . . . . distant road

19\. . . . . come to my presence

20\. . . . . of which the passage is difficult.

The rest of this column is lost. In it Izdubar converses with the
monsters and where the third column begins he is telling them his
purpose, to seek Hasisadra.

<span class="smallcaps">Column</span> III.

(1 and 2 lost.)

3\. He Hasisadra my father . . . . .

4\. who is established in the assembly of the gods

5\. death and life \[are known to him\]

6\. The monster opened his mouth and spake

7\. and said to Izdubar

8\. Do it not Izdubar . . . .

9\. of the country . . . .

10\. for twelve kaspu (84 miles) \[is the journey\]

11\. which is completely covered with sand, and there is not a
cultivated field,

12\. to the rising sun . . . .

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

13\. to the setting sun . . . .

14\. to the setting sun . . . .

15\. he brought out . . . .

In this mutilated passage, the monster describes the journey to be taken
by Izdubar; there are now many lines wanting, until we come to the
fourth column.

<span class="smallcaps">Column</span> IV.

1\. in prayer . . . .

2\. again thou . . . .

7\. the road of the sun . . . .

8\. 1 kaspu he went . . . .

9\. which was completely covered with sand, and there was not a
cultivated field,

10\. he was not able to look behind him.

11\. 2 kaspu he went . . . .

This is the bottom of the fourth column; there are five lines lost at
the top of the fifth column, and then the narrative reopens; the text
is, however, mutilated and doubtful.

<span class="smallcaps">Column</span> V.

6\. 4 kaspu he went . . . .

7\. which was completely covered with sand, and there was not a
cultivated field,

8\. he was not able to look behind him.

33\. Ukni stones it carried as shoots?

34\. the fruit it carried to the sight were large

Some of the words in this fragment are obscure, but the general meaning
is clear. In the next column the wanderings of Izdubar are continued,
and he comes to a country near the sea. Fragments of several lines of
this column are preserved, but too mutilated to translate with
certainty. The fragments are:—

<span class="smallcaps">Column</span> VI.

(About six lines lost.)

1\. the pine tree . . . .

2\. its nest of stone . . . . ukni stone?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tablet brings Izdubar to the region of the sea-coast, but his way
is then barred by two women, one named Siduri, and the other Sabitu. His
further adventures are given on the tenth tablet, which opens:

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Tablet</span> X.

1\. Siduri and Sabitu who in the land beside the sea dwelt

2\. dwelt also . . . .

8\. there was shame of face on . . . .

9\. to go on the distant path his face was set.

10\. Sabitu afar off pondered,

11\. spake within her heart, and a resolution made.

12\. Within herself also she considered:

13\. What is this message

14\. There is no one upright in . . . .

15\. And Sabitu saw him and shut her place?

16\. her gate she shut, and shut her place?

17\. And he Izdubar having ears heard her

18\. he struck his hands and made . . . .

19\. Izdubar to her also said to Sabitu:

20\. Sabitu why dost thou shut thy place?

21\. thy gate thou closest . . . .

22\. I will strike the . . . .

The rest of this column is lost, but I am able to say it described the
meeting of Izdubar with a boatman named Urhamsi, and they commence
together a journey by water in a boat on the second column.

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Very little of
this column is preserved; I give two fragments only here.

<span class="smallcaps">Column</span> II.

of the bottom of the column.

Here there is a blank, the extent of which is uncertain, and where the
narrative recommences it is

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

on a small fragment of the third and fourth column of another copy. It
appears that the lost lines record the meeting between Izdubar and a
person named Ragmu-seri-ina-namari. I have conjectured that this
individual was the wife of Hasisadra or Noah; but there is no ground for
this opinion; it is possible that this individual was the gatekeeper or

guard, by whom Izdubar had to pass in going to reach Hasisadra.

It is curious that, whenever Izdubar speaks to this being, the name
Ragmua is used, while, whenever Izdubar is spoken to, the full name
Ragmu-seri-ina-namari occurs. Where the story re-opens Izdubar is
informing Ragmu of his first connection with Heabani and his offers to
him when he desired him to come to Erech.

he did in conjunction with Heabani. Where the story reopens on Column

This statement of Hasisadra closes the tenth tablet and leads to the
next question of Izdubar and its answer, which included the story of the
Flood.

The present division of the legends has its own peculiar difficulties;
in the first place it does not appear how Heabani was killed. My
original idea, that he was killed by the poisonous insect *tambukku*, I
find to be incorrect, and it now appears most likely either that he was
killed in a quarrel with Izdubar, as seems suggested by the fragment in
[p. 246](#page_246.md), or that he fell in an attempt to slay a lion, which
is implied in the passage [p. 259](#page_259.md).

In the ninth tablet I am able to make a correction to my former
translation; I find the monsters seen by Izdubar were composite beings,
half scorpions, half men. The word for scorpion has been some time ago
discovered by Professor Oppert, and I find it occurs in the description
of these beings; also on a fragment of a tablet which I found at
Kouyunjik the star of

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

the scorpion is said to belong to the eighth month, in which, of course,
it should naturally appear.

This assists in explaining a curious tablet printed in "Cuneiform
Inscriptions," vol. iii. p. 52, No. 1, which has been misunderstood.
This tablet speaks of the appearance of comets, one of which has a tail
"like a lizard (or creeping thing) and a scorpion."

The land of Mas or desert of Mas over which Izdubar travels in this
tablet is the desert on the west of the Euphrates; on the sixth column
the fragments appear to refer to some bird with magnificent

feathers like precious stones, seen by Izdubar on his journey.

I have altered my translation of the passage in pp. [255](#page_255.md),
[256](#page_256.md), which I now believe to relate that Izdubar at the
direction of Urhamsi made a spear from one of the trees of the forest
before going across the waters of death which separated the abode of
Hasisadra from the world of mortals. I do not, however, understand the
passage, as from the mutilated condition of the inscription it does not
appear what he attacked with it.
