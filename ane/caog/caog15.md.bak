IN this chapter I have included the fragments of what appear to be the
second and third tablets. In this section of the story Izdubar comes
prominently forward, and meets with Heabani. I have already noticed the
supposed parentage of Izdubar; the notice of his mother Dannat appears
in one of the tablets given in this chapter.

Izdubar, in the Babylonian and Assyrian sculptures, is always
represented with a marked physiognomy, and his peculiarities can be seen
by noticing the photograph from a Babylonian gem at the beginning of the
book, the engraving from an Assyrian sculpture

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

in the last chapter, and the engraving in page
[239](caog17.htm#page_239.md) showing Izdubar and Heabani struggling with
wild animals. In all these cases, and in every other instance where
Izdubar is represented, he is indicated as a man with masses of curls
over his head and a large curly beard. So marked is this, and different
in cast to the usual Babylonian type, that I cannot help the impression
of its being a representation of a distinct and probably Ethiopian type.

The deity of Izdubar was Sarturda, from which I suppose he was a native
of the district of Amarda or Marad, where that god was worshipped. This
district was probably the Amordacia or Mardocæa of Ptolemy, but I do not
know where it was situated.

The fragments of the second and third tablets assume by their notices
that Izdubar was already known as a mighty hunter, and it appeared a
little later that he claimed descent from the old Babylonian kings,
calling Hasisadra his "father."

<span class="smallcaps">Tablet</span> II.

I have recovered a single fragment, which I believe to belong to this
tablet; it is K 3389, and it contains part of the third and fourth
columns of writing. It appears from this that Izdubar was then at Erech,
and he had a curious dream. He thought he saw the stars of heaven fall
to the ground, and in their descent they struck upon his back. He then
saw standing over him a terrible being, the aspect of his face was
fierce, and he was armed with

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

claws, like the claws of lions. The greater part of the description of
the dream is lost; it probably occupied columns I. and II. of the second
tablet. Thinking that the dream portended some fate to himself, Izdubar
calls on all the wise men to explain it, and offers a reward to any one
who can interpret the dream. Here the fragment Ii 3389 comes in:

<span class="smallcaps">Column</span> III.

1\. . . . . ru kili I . . . .

2\. . . . . he and the princes may he . . .

3\. . . . . in the vicinity send him,

4\. . . . . may they ennoble his family,

5\. . . . . at the head of his feast may he set thee

6\. . . . . may he array thee in jewels and gold

7\. . . . . may he enclose thee

8\. . . . . in his . . . . seat thee

9\. into the houses of the gods may he cause thee to enter

10\. . . . . seven wives

11\. . . . . cause illness in his stomach

12\. . . . . went up alone

13\. . . . . his heaviness to his friend

14\. . . . . a dream I dreamed in my sleep

15\. . . . . the stars of heaven fell to the earth

16\. . . . . I stood still

17\. . . . . his face

18\. . . . . his face was terrible

19\. . . . . like the claws of a lion, were his claws

20\. . . . . the strength in me

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

21\. . . . . he slew

22\. . . . . me

23\. . . . . over me

24\. . . . . corpse . . . .

The first part of this fragment appears to contain the honours offered
by Izdubar to any one who should interpret the dream. These included the
ennobling of his family, his recognition in assemblies, his being
invested with jewels of honour, and his wives being increased. A
description of the dream of the hero, much mutilated, follows. The
conduct of Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel, with reference to his
dreams, bears some resemblance to that of Izdubar.

After this fragment we have again a blank in the story, and it would
appear that in this interval application was made to a hermit named
Heabani that he would go to the city of Erech and interpret the dream of
Izdubar.

Heabani appears, from the representations on seals and other objects on
which he is figured, to have been a satyr or faun. He is always drawn
with the feet and tail of an ox, and with horns on his head. He is said
to have lived in a cave among the wild animals of the forest, and was
supposed to possess wonderful knowledge both of nature and human
affairs. Heabani was angry at the request that he should abandon his
solitary life for the friendship of Izdubar, and where our narrative
reopens the god Samas is persuading him to accept the offer.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Column</span> IV.

3\. And Shamas opened his mouth

4\. and spake and from heaven said to him:

5\. . . . . and the female Samhat (delightful) thou shalt choose

6\. they shall array thee in trappings of divinity

7\. they shall give thee the insignia of royalty

8\. they shall make thee become great

9\. and Izdubar thou shalt call and incline him towards thee

10\. and Izdubar shall make friendship unto thee

11\. he shall cause thee to recline on a grand couch

12\. on a beautiful couch he shall seat thee

before thee

16\. and he after thee shall take all . . . .

------------------------------------------------------------------------

18\. Heabani heard the words of Shamas the warrior

19\. and the anger of his heart was appeased

20\. . . . . was appeased

Here we are still dealing with the honours which Izdubar promises to the
interpreter of his dream, and these seem to show that Izdubar had some
power

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

at Erech at this time; he does not, however, appear to have been an
independent king, and it is probable that the next two columns of this
tablet, now lost, contain negotiations for bringing Heabani to Erech,
the subject being continued on the third tablet.

<span class="smallcaps">Tablet</span> III.

This tablet is far better preserved than the two previous ones; it gives
the account of the successful mission to bring Heabani to Ur, opening
with a broken account of the wisdom of Heabani.

27\. And Heabani approached Harimtu then, who before had not enticed
him.

28\. And he listened . . . . and was attentive,

29\. and he turned and sat at the feet of Harimtu.

30\. Harimtu bent down her face,

31\. and Harimtu spake; and his ears heard

32\. and to him also she said to Heabani:

33\. Famous Heabani like a god art thou,

34\. Why dost thou associate with the creeping things in the desert?

35\. I desire thy company to the midst of Erech Suburi,

36\. to the temple of Elli-tardusi the seat of Anu and Ishtar,

37\. the dwelling of Izdubar the mighty giant,

38\. who also like a bull towers over the chiefs.

39\. She spake to hint and before her speech,

40\. the wisdom of his heart flew away and disappeared.

41\. Heabani to her also said to Harimtu:

42\. I join to Samhat my companionship,

43\. to the temple of Elli-tardusi the seat of Anu and Ishtar,

44\. the dwelling of Izdubar the mighty giant,

45\. who also like a bull towers over the chiefs.

40\. . . . . over thee

41\. . . . . did not rise over it

42\. . . . . my . . . . .

43\. . . . . thee

There is one other mutilated fragment of this and the next column with
part of a relation respecting beasts and a fragment of a conversation
between Izdubar and his mother.

The whole of this tablet is curious, and it certainly gives the
successful issue of the attempt to bring Heabani to Erech, and in very
fragmentary condition the dream of the monarch.

I have omitted some of the details in columns III. and IV. because they
were on the one side obscure, and on the other hand appeared hardly
adapted for general reading.

It appears that the females Samhat and Harimtu prevailed upon Heabani to
come to Erech and see the exploits of the giant Izdubar, and he declared
that he would bring a *Midannu*, most probably a tiger, to

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Erech, in order to
make trial of the strength of Izdubar, and to see if he could destroy
it.

The Midannu is mentioned in the Assyrian texts as a fierce carnivorous
animal allied to the lion and leopard; it is called *Midannu*, Mindinu,
and Mandinu.

In the fifth column, after the description of the festivities which
followed the arrival of Heabani, there appears a break between lines 15
and 16, some part of the original story being probably omitted here. I
believe that the Assyrian copy is here defective, at least one line
being lost. The portion here omitted probably stated that the following
speech was made by the mother of Izdubar, who figures prominently in the
earlier part of these legends.
