I HAVE included in this chapter the principal extracts from ancient
authors respecting the Babylonian accounts of Genesis. Many others are
known, but are of doubtful origin, and of less immediate interest to my
subject.

Berosus, from whom the principal extracts are copied, lived, as I have
mentioned in Chapter I., about B.C. 330 to 260, and, from his position
as a

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Babylonian priest,
had the best means of knowing the Babylonian traditions.

The others are later writers, who copied in the main from Berosus, and
whose notices may be taken as giving abridgments of his statements.

I have preferred as usual, the translations of Cory as being standard
ones, and made without prejudice from recent discoveries.

##### <span class="smallcaps">Extract</span> I. <span class="smallcaps">From Alexander Polyhistor</span> (<span class="smallcaps">Cory</span>, p. 21).

Berosus, in the first book of his history of Babylonia, informs us that
he lived in the age of Alexander, the son of Philip. And he mentions
that there were written accounts, preserved at Babylon with the greatest
care, comprehending a period of above fifteen myriads of years; and that
these writings contained histories of the heaven and of the sea; of the
birth of mankind; and of the kings, and of the memorable actions which
they had achieved.

And in the first place he describes Babylonia as a country situated
between the Tigris and the Euphrates; that it abounded with wheat, and
barley, and ocrus, and sesame; and that in the lakes were produced the
roots called gongæ, which are fit for food, and in respect to nutriment
similar to barley. That there were also palm-trees and apples, and a
variety of fruits; fish also and birds, both those which are merely of
flight, and those which frequent the lakes. He adds that those parts of
the country

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

which bordered upon Arabia were without water, and barren; but that the
parts which lay on the other side were both hilly and fertile.

At Babylon there was (in these times) a great resort of people of
various nations, who inhabited Chaldea, and lived in a lawless manner
like the beasts of the field.

In the first year there appeared, from that part of the Erythræan sea
which borders upon Babylonia, an animal endowed with reason, by name
Oannes,

OANNES AND OTHER BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURES FROM CYLINDER.

whose whole body (according to the account of Apollodorus) was that of a
fish; that under the fish's head he had another head, with feet also
below similar to those of a man, subjoined to the fish's tail. His
voice, too, and language were articulate and human; and a representation
of him is preserved even to this day.

This being was accustomed to pass the day among men, but took no food at
that season; and he gave them an insight into letters and sciences, and
arts of every kind. He taught them to construct cities, to

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

found temples, to compile laws, and explained to them the principles of
geometrical knowledge. He made them distinguish the seeds of the earth,
and showed them how to collect the fruits; in short, he instructed them
in every thing which could tend to soften manners and humanize their
lives. From that time, nothing material has been added by way of
improvement to his instructions. And when the sun had set this being
Oannes retired again into the sea, and passed the night in the deep, for
he was amphibious. After this there appeared other animals like Oannes,
of which Berosus proposes to give an account when he comes to the
history of the kings. Moreover, Oannes wrote concerning the generation
of mankind, and of their civil polity; and the following is the purport
of what he said:—

"There was a time in which there existed nothing but darkness and an
abyss of waters, wherein resided most hideous beings, which were
produced of a two-fold principle. There appeared men, some of whom were
furnished with two wings, others with four, and with two faces. They had
one body, but two heads; the one that of a man, the other of a woman;
and likewise in their several organs both male and female. Other human
figures were to be seen with the legs and horns of a goat; some had
horses’ feet, while others united the hind quarters of a horse with the
body of a man, resembling in shape the hippocentaurs. Bulls likewise
were bred there with the heads of men; and dogs with fourfold

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

bodies, terminated in their extremities with the tails of fishes; horses
also with the heads of dogs; men, too, and other animals, with the heads
and bodies of horses, and the tails of fishes. In short, there were
creatures in which were combined the limbs of every species of animals.
In addition to these, fishes, reptiles, serpents, with other monstrous
animals, which assumed each other's shape and countenance.

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Of all which were
preserved delineations in the temple of Belus at Babylon.

"The person who presided over them was a woman named Omoroca, which in
the Chaldean language is Thalatth, in Greek Thalassa, the sea; but which
might equally be interpreted the moon. All things being in this
situation, Belus came, and cut the woman asunder, and of one half of her
he formed the earth, and of the other half the heavens, and at the same
time destroyed the animals within her (or in the abyss).

"All this" (he says) "was an allegorical description of nature. For, the
whole universe consisting of

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

moisture, and animals being continually generated therein, the deity
above-mentioned took off his own head; upon which the other gods mixed
the blood, as it gushed out, and from thence formed men. On this account
it is that they are rational, and partake of divine knowledge. This
Belus, by whom they signify Jupiter, divided the darkness, and separated
the heavens from the earth, and reduced the universe to order. But the
animals, not being able to bear the prevalence of light, died. Belus
upon this, seeing a vast space unoccupied, though by nature fruitful,
commanded one of the gods to take off his head, and to mix the blood
with the earth, and from thence to form other men and animals, which
should be capable of bearing the air. Belus formed also the stars, and
the sun, and the moon, and the five planets." (Such, according to
Polyhistor Alexander, is the account which Berosus gives in his first
book.)

(In the second book was contained the history of the ten kings of the
Chaldeans, and the periods of the continuance of each reign, which
consisted collectively of an hundred and twenty sari, or four hundred
and thirty-two thousand years; reaching to the time of the Deluge. For
Alexander, enumerating the kings from the writings of the Chaldeans,
after the ninth Ardates, proceeds to the tenth, who is called by them
Xisuthrus, in this manner):—

"After the death of Ardates, his son Xisuthrus . reigned eighteen sari.
In his time happened a great

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

deluge; the history of which is thus described. The deity Cronos
appeared to him in a vision, and warned him that upon the fifteenth day
of the month Dæsius there would be a flood, by which mankind would be
destroyed. He therefore enjoined him to write a history of the
beginning, procedure, and conclusion of all things, and to bury it in
the city of the Sun at Sippara; and to build a vessel, and take with him
into it his friends and relations; and to convey on board every thing
necessary to sustain life, together with all the different animals, both
birds and quadrupeds, and trust himself fearlessly to the deep. Having
asked the Deity whither he was to sail, he was answered, 'To the Gods;'
upon which he offered up a prayer for the good of mankind. He then
obeyed the divine admonition, and built a vessel five stadia in length,
and two in breadth. Into this he put everything which he had prepared,
and last of all conveyed into it his wife, his children, and his
friends.

After the flood had been upon the earth, and was in time abated,
Xisuthrus sent out birds from the vessel; which not finding any food,
nor any place whereupon they might rest their feet, returned to him
again. After an interval of some days, he sent them forth a second time;
and they now returned with their feet tinged with mud. He made a trial a
third time with these birds; but they returned to him no more: from
whence he judged that the surface of the earth had appeared above the
waters.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He therefore made
an opening in the vessel, and upon looking out found that it was
stranded upon the side of some mountain; upon which he immediately
quitted it with his wife, his daughter, and the pilot. Xisuthrus then
paid his adoration to the earth: and, having constructed an altar,
offered sacrifices to the gods, and, with those who had come out of the
vessel with him, disappeared.

They, who remained within, finding that their companions did not return,
quitted the vessel with many lamentations, and called continually on the
name of Xisuthrus. Him they saw no more; but they could distinguish his
voice in the air, and could hear him admonish them to pay due regard to
religion; and likewise informed them that it was upon account of his
piety that he was translated to live with the gods, that his wife and
daughter and the pilot had obtained the same honour. To this he added
that they should return to Babylonia, and, as it was ordained, search
for the writings at Sippara, which they were to make known to all
mankind; moreover, that the place wherein they then were was the land of
Armenia. The rest having heard these words offered sacrifices to the
gods, and, taking a circuit, journeyed towards Babylonia.

The vessel being thus stranded in Armenia, some part of it yet remains
in the Corcyræan mountains of Armenia, and the people scrape off the
bitumen with which it had been outwardly coated, and make use of it by
way of an alexipharmic and amulet.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And when they
returned to Babylon and had found the writings at Sippara they built
cities and erected temples, and Babylon was thus inhabited
again.—*Syncel. Chron.* xxviii.; *Euseb. Chron.* v. 8.

##### <span class="smallcaps">Berosus, from Apollodorus</span> (<span class="smallcaps">Cory</span>, p. 30).

This is the history which Berosus has transmitted to us. He tells us
that the first king was Alorus of Babylon, a Chaldean, he reigned ten
sari; and afterwards Alaparus and Amelon, who came from Pantebiblon;
then Ammenon the Chaldean, in whose time appeared the Musarus Oannes,
the Annedotus from the Erythræan sea. (But Alexander Polyhistor,
anticipating the event, has said that he appeared in the first year, but
Apollodorus says that it was after forty sari; Abydenus, however, makes
the second Annedotus appear after twenty-six sari.) Then succeeded
Megalarus from the city of Pantibiblon, and he reigned eighteen sari;
and after him Daonus, the shepherd from Pantibiblon, reigned ten sari;
in his time (he says) appeared again from the Erythræan sea a fourth
Annedotus, having the same form with those above, the shape of a fish
blended with that of a man. Then reigned Euedorachus from Pantibiblon
for the term of eighteen sari; in his days there appeared another
personage from the Erythræan sea like the former, having the same
complicated form between a fish and a man, whose name was Odacon. (All
these, says Apollodorus, related particularly and circumstantially
whatever Oannes

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

had informed them of; concerning these Abydenus has made no mention.)
Then reigned Amempsinus, a Chaldean from Larancha; and he being the
eighth in order reigned ten sari. Then reigned Otiartes, a Chaldean,
from Larancha; and he reigned eight sari. And, upon the death of
Otiartes, his son Xisuthrus reigned eighteen sari; in his time happened
the great Deluge. So that the sum of all the kings is ten; and the term
which they collectively reigned an hundred and twenty sari.—*Syncel.
Chron.* xxxix.; *Euseb. Chron.* V.

##### <span class="smallcaps">Berosus, From Abydenus</span> (<span class="smallcaps">Cory</span>, p. 32).

So much concerning the wisdom of the Chaldeans.

It is said that the first king of the country was Alorus, and that he
gave out a report that God had appointed him to be the shepherd of the
people, he reigned ten sari; now a sarus is esteemed to be three
thousand six hundred years, a neros six hundred, and a sossus sixty.

After him Alaparus reigned three sari; to him succeeded Amillarus from
the city of Pantibiblon, who reigned thirteen sari; in his time came up
from the sea a second Annedotus, a semi-demon very similar in his form
to Oannes; after Amillarus reigned Ammenon twelve sari, who was of the
city of Pantibiblon; then Megalarus of the same place reigned eighteen
sari; then Daos the shepherd governed for the space of ten sari, he was
of Pantibiblon; in his time four double-shaped personages came up out

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

of the sea to land, whose names were Euedocus, Eneugamus, Eneuboulus,
and Anementus; afterwards in the time of Euedoreschus appeared another,
Anodaphus. After these reigned other kings, and last of all Sisithrus,
so that in the whole the number amounted to ten kings, and the term of
their reigns to an hundred and twenty sari. (And among other things not
irrelative to the subject he continues thus concerning the Deluge):
After Euedoreschus some others reigned, and then Sisithrus. To him the
deity Cronos foretold that on the fifteenth day of the month Dæsius
there would be a deluge of rain: and he commanded him to deposit all the
writings whatever which were in his possession in the city of the sun in
Sippara. Sisithrus, when he had complied with these commands, sailed
immediately to Armenia, and was presently inspired by God. Upon the
third day after the cessation of the rain Sisithrus sent out birds by
way of experiment, that he might judge whether the flood had subsided.
But the birds, passing over an unbounded sea without finding any place
of rest, returned again to Sisithrus. This he repeated with other birds.
And when upon the third trial he succeeded, for the birds then returned
with their feet stained with mud, the gods translated him from among
men. With respect to the vessel, which yet remains in Armenia, it is a
custom of the inhabitants to form bracelets and amulets of its
wood.—*Syncel. Chron.* xxxviii.; *Euseb. Præp. Evan.* lib. ix.; *Euseb.
Chron.* v. 8.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

##### <span class="smallcaps">Of the Tower of Babel</span> (<span class="smallcaps">Cory</span>, p. 34).

They say that the first inhabitants of the earth, glorying in their own
strength and size and despising the gods, undertook to raise a tower
whose top should reach the sky, in the place in which Babylon now
stands; but when it approached the heaven the winds assisted the gods,
and overthrew the work upon its contrivers, and its ruins are said to be
still at Babylon; and the gods introduced a diversity of tongues among
men, who till that time had all spoken the same language; and a war
arose between Cronos and Titan. The place in which they built the tower
is now called Babylon on account of the confusion of tongues, for
confusion is by the Hebrews called Babel.—*Euseb. Præp. Evan*. lib. ix.;
*Syncel. Chron.* xliv.; *Euseb. Chron.* xiii.

##### <span class="smallcaps">Of The Ark, From Nicolaus Damascenus</span> (<span class="smallcaps">Cory</span>, p. 49).

There is above Minyas in the land of Armenia a very great mountain which
is called Baris, to which it is said that many persons retreated at the
time of the Deluge and were saved, and that one in particular was
carried thither in an ark and was landed on its summit, and that the
remains of the vessel were long preserved upon the mountain. Perhaps
this was the same individual of whom Moses, the legislator of the Jews,
has made mention.—*Jos. Ant. Jud.* i. 3; *Euseb. Præp. Evan.* ix.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

##### <span class="smallcaps">Of the Dispersion, from Hestiæus</span> (<span class="smallcaps">Cory</span>, p. 50).

The priests who escaped took with them the implements of the worship of
the Enyalian Jove, and came to Senaar in Babylonia. But they were again
driven from thence by the introduction of a diversity of tongues; upon
which they founded colonies in various parts, each settling in such
situations as chance or the direction of God led them to occupy.—*Jos.
Ant. Jud.* *i.e.* 4; *Euseb. Præp. Evan*. ix,

##### <span class="smallcaps">Of the Tower of Babel, from Alexander Polyhistor</span> <span class="smallcaps">Cory</span>, p. 50) .

The Sibyl says: That when all men formerly spoke the same language some
among them undertook to erect a large and lofty tower, that they might
climb up into heaven. But God sending forth a whirlwind confounded their
design, and gave to each tribe a particular language of its own, which
is the reason that the name of that city is Babylon. After the deluge
lived Titan and Prometheus, when Titan undertook a war against
Cronus.—*Sync.* xliv.; *Jos. Ant. Jud.* i. c. 4; *Euseb. Præp. Evan.*
ix.

##### <span class="smallcaps">The Theogonies, from Damascius</span> (<span class="smallcaps">Cory</span>, p. 318).

But the Babylonians, like the rest of the barbarians, pass over in
silence the One principle of the universe, and they constitute two,
Tauthe and Apason, making Apason the husband of Tauthe, and

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

denominating her the mother of the gods. And from these proceeds an
only-begotten son, Moymis, which I conceive is no other than the
intelligible world proceeding from the two principles. From them also
another progeny is derived, Dache and Dachus; and again a third, Kissare
and Assorus, from which last three others proceed, Anus, and Illinus,
and Aus. And of Aus and Davce is born a son called Belus, who, they say,
is the fabricator of the world, the Demiurgus.
