## BABYLONIAN LAW--The Code of Hammurabi.

By the Rev. Claude Hermann Walter Johns, M.A. Litt.D.

from the Eleventh Edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, 1910-1911

The material for the study of Babylonian law is singularly extensive
without being exhaustive. The so-called "contracts," including a great
variety of deeds, conveyances, bonds, receipts, accounts and, most
important of all, the actual legal decisions given by the judges in the
law courts, exist in thousands. Historical inscriptions, royal charters
and rescripts, despatches, private letters and the general literature
afford welcome supplementary information. Even grammatical and
lexicographical works, intended solely to facilitate the study of
ancient literature, contain many extracts or short sentences bearing on
law and custom. The so-called "Sumerian Family Laws" are thus preserved.
The discovery of the now celebrated Code of Hammurabi (hereinafter
simply termed the Code) has, however, made a more systematic study
possible than could have resulted from the classification and
interpretation of the other material. Some fragments of a later code
exist and have been published; but there still remain many points upon
which we have no evidence.

This material dates from the earliest times down to the commencement of
our era. The evidence upon a particular point may be very full at one
period and almost entirely lacking at another. The Code forms the
backbone of the skeleton sketch which is here reconstructed. The
fragments of it which have been recovered from Assur-bani-pal's library
at Nineveh and later Babylonian copies show that it was studied, divided
into chapters entitled Ninu ilu sirum from its opening words, and
recopied for fifteen hundred years or more. The greater part of It
remained in force, even through the Persian, Greek and Parthian
conquests, which affected private life in Babylonia very little, and it
survived to influence Syro-Roman and later Mahommedan law in
Mesopotamia. The law and custom which preceded the Code we shall call
"early," that of the New Babylonian empire (as well as the Persian,
Greek, &c.) "late." The law in Assyria was derived from Babylonia but
conserved early features long after they had disappeared elsewhere.

When the Semitic tribes settled in the cities of Babylonia, their tribal
custom passed over into city law. The early history of the country is
the story of a struggle for supremacy between the cities. A metropolis
demanded tribute and military support from its subject cities but left
their local cults and customs unaffected. The city rights and usages
were respected by kings and conquerors alike.

As late as the accession of Assur-bani-pal and Samas-sum-yukin we find
the Babylonians appealing to their city laws that groups of aliens to
the number of twenty at a time were free to enter the city, that foreign
women once married to Babylonian husbands could not be enslaved and that
not even a dog that entered the city could be put to death untried.

The population of Babylonia was of many races from early times and
intercommunication between the cities was incessant. Every city had a
large number of resident aliens. This freedom of intercourse must have
tended to assimilate custom. It was, however, reserved for the genius of
Hammurabi to make Babylon his metropolis and weld together his vast
empire by a uniform system of law.

Almost all trace of tribal custom has already disappeared from the law
of the Code. It is state-law; - alike self-help, blood-feud, marriage by
capture, are absent; though family solidarity, district responsibility,
ordeal, the lex talionis, are primitive features that remain. The king
is a benevolent autocrat, easily accessible to all his subjects, both
able and willing to protect the weak against the highest-placed
oppressor. The royal power, however, can only pardon when private
resentment is appeased. The judges are strictly supervised and appeal is
allowed. The whole land is covered with feudal holdings, masters of the
levy, police, &c. There is a regular postal system. The pax Babylonica
is so assured that private individuals do not hesitate to ride in their
carriage from Babylon to the coast of the Mediterranean. The position of
women is free and dignified.

The Code did not merely embody contemporary custom or conserve ancient
law. It is true that centuries of law-abiding and litigious habitude had
accumulated in the temple archives of each city vast stores of precedent
in ancient deeds and the records of judicial decisions, and that
intercourse had assimilated city custom. The universal habit of writing
and perpetual recourse to written contract even more modified primitive
custom and ancient precedent. Provided the parties could agree, the Code
left them free to contract as a rule. Their deed of agreement was drawn
up in the temple by a notary public, and confirmed by an oath "by god
and the king." It was publicly sealed and witnessed by professional
witnesses, as well as by collaterally interested parties. The manner in
which it was thus executed may have been sufficient security that its
stipulations were not impious or illegal. Custom or public opinion
doubtless secured that the parties would not agree to wrong. In case of
dispute the judges dealt first with the contract. They might not sustain
it, but if the parties did not dispute it, they were free to observe it.
The judges' decision might, however, be appealed against. Many contracts
contain the proviso that in case of future dispute the parties would
abide by "the decision of the king." The Code made known, in a vast
number of cases, what that decision would be, and many cases of appeal
to the king were sent back to the judges with orders to decide in
accordance with it. The Code itself was carefully and logically arranged
and the order of its sections was conditioned by their subject-matter.
Nevertheless the order is not that of modern scientific treatises, and a
somewhat different order from both is most convenient for our purpose.

The Code contemplates the whole population as falling into three
classes, the amelu, the muskinu and the ardu. The amelu was a patrician,
the man of family, whose birth, marriage and death were registered, of
ancestral estates and full civil rights. He had aristocratic privileges
and responsibilities, the right to exact retaliation for corporal
injuries, and liability to heavier punishment for crimes and
misdemeanours, higher fees and fines to pay. To this class belonged the
king and court, the higher officials, the professions and craftsmen. The
term became in time a mere courtesy title but originally carried with it
standing. Already in the Code, when status is not concerned, it is used
to denote "any one." There was no property qualification nor does the
term appear to be racial. It is most difficult to characterize the
muskinu exactly. The term came in time to mean "a beggar" and with that
meaning has passed through Aramaic and Hebrew into many modern
languages; but though the Code does not regard him as necessarily poor,
he may have been landless. He was free, but had to accept monetary
compensation for corporal injuries, paid smaller fees and fines, even
paid less offerings to the gods. He inhabited a separate quarter of the
city. There is no reason to regard him as specially connected with the
court, as a royal pensioner, nor as forming the bulk of the population.
The rarity of any reference to him in contemporary documents makes
further specification conjectural. The ardu was a slave, his master's
chattel, and formed a very numerous class. He could acquire property and
even hold other slaves. His master clothed and fed him, paid his
doctor's fees, but took all compensation paid for injury done to him.
His master usually found him a slave-girl as wife (the children were
then born slaves), often set him up in a house (with farm or business)
and simply took an annual rent of him. Otherwise he might marry a
freewoman (the children were then free), who might bring him a dower
which his master could not touch, and at his death one-half of his
property passed to his master as his heir. He could acquire his freedom
by purchase from his master, or might be freed and dedicated to a
temple, or even adopted, when he became an amelu and not a muskinu.
Slaves were recruited by purchase abroad, from captives taken in war and
by freemen degraded for debt or crime. A slave often ran away; if
caught, the captor was bound to restore him to his master, and the Code
fixes a reward of two shekels which the owner must pay the captor. It
was about one-tenth of the average value. To detain, harbour, &c., a
slave was punished by death. So was an attempt to get him to leave the
city. A slave bore an identification mark, which could only be removed
by a surgical operation and which later consisted of his owner's name
tattooed or branded on the arm. On the great estates in Assyria and its
subject provinces were many serfs, mostly of subject race, settled
captives, or quondam slaves, tied to the soil they cultivated and sold
with the estate but capable of possessing land and property of their
own. There is little trace of serfs in Babylonia, unless the muskinu be
really a serf.

The god of a city was originally owner of its land, which encircled it
with an inner ring of irrigable arable land and an outer fringe of
pasture, and the citizens were his tenants. The god and his viceregent,
the king, had long ceased to disturb tenancy, and were content with
fixed dues in naturalia, stock, money or service. One of the earliest
monuments records the purchase by a king of a large estate for his son,
paying a fair market price and adding a handsome honorarium to the many
owners in costly garments, plate, and precious articles of furniture.
The Code recognizes complete private ownership in land, but apparently
extends the right to hold land to votaries, merchants (and resident
aliens?). But all land was sold subject to its fixed charges. The king,
however, could free land from these charges by charter, which was a
frequent way of rewarding those who deserved well of the state. It is
from these charters that we learn nearly all we know of the obligations
that lay upon land. The state demanded men for the army and the corvee
as well as dues in kind. A definite area was bound to find a bowman
together with his linked pikeman (who bore the shield for both) and to
furnish them with supplies for the campaign. This area was termed "a
bow" as early as the 8th century B.C., but the usage was much earlier.
Later, a horseman was due from certain areas. A man was only bound to
serve so many (six?) times, but the land had to find a man annually. The
service was usually discharged by slaves and serfs, but the amelu (and
perhaps the muskenu) went to war. The "bows" were grouped in tens and
hundreds. The corvee was less regular. The letters of Hammurabi often
deal with claims to exemption. Religious officials and shepherds in
charge of flocks were exempt. Special liabilities lay upon riparian
owners to repair canals, bridges, quays, &c. The state claimed certain
proportions of all crops, stock, &c. The king's messengers could
commandeer any subject's property, giving a receipt. Further, every city
had its own octroi duties, customs, ferry dues, highway and water rates.
The king had long ceased to be, if he ever was, owner of the land. He
had his own royal estates, his private property and dues from all his
subjects. The higher officials had endowments and official residences.
The Code regulates the feudal position of certain classes. They held an
estate from the king consisting of house, garden, field, stock and a
salary, on condition of personal service on the king's errand. They
could not delegate the service on pain of death. When ordered abroad
they could nominate a son, if capable, to hold the benefice and carry on
the duty. If there was no son capable, the state put in a locum tenens,
but granted one-third to the wife to maintain herself and children. The
benefice was inalienable, could not be sold, pledged, exchanged, sublet,
devised or diminished. Other land was held of the state for rent.
Ancestral estate was strictly tied to the family. If a holder would
sell, the family had the right of redemption and there seems to have
been no time-limit to its exercise.

The temple occupied a most important position. It received from its
estates, from tithes and other fixed dues, as well as from the
sacrifices (a customary share) and other offerings of the faithful, vast
amounts of all sorts of naturalia; besides money and permanent gifts.
The larger temples had many officials and servants. Originally, perhaps,
each town clustered round one temple, and each head of a family had a
right to minister there and share its receipts. As the city grew, the
right to so many days a year at one or other shrine (or its "gate")
descended in certain families and became a species of property which
could be pledged, rented or shared within the family, but not alienated.
In spite of all these demands, however, the temples became great
granaries and store-houses; as they also were the city archives. The
temple held its responsibilities. If a citizen was captured by the enemy
and could not ransom himself the temple of his city must do so. To the
temple came the poor farmer to borrow seed corn or supplies for
harvesters, &c.--advances which he repaid without interest. The king's
power over the temple was not proprietary but administrative. He might
borrow from it but repaid like other borrowers. The tithe seems to have
been the composition for the rent due to the god for his land. It is not
clear that all lands paid tithe, perhaps only such as once had a special
connexion with the temple.

The Code deals with a class of persons devoted to the service of a god,
as vestals or hierodules. The vestals were vowed to chastity, lived
together in a great nunnery, were forbidden to open or enter a tavern,
and together with other votaries had many privileges.

The Code recognizes many ways of disposing of property--sale, lease,
barter, gift, dedication, deposit, loan, pledge, all of which were
matters of contract. Sale was the delivery of the purchase (in the case
of real estate symbolized by a staff, a key, or deed of conveyance) in
return for the purchase money, receipts being given for both. Credit, if
given, was treated as a debt, and secured as a loan by the seller to be
repaid by the buyer, fr which he gave a bond. The Code admits no claim
unsubstantiated by documents or the oath of witnesses. A buyer had to
convince himself of the seller's title. If he bought (or received on
deposit) from a minor or a slave without power of attorney, he would be
executed as a thief. If the goods were stolen and the rightful owner
reclaimed them, he had to prove his purchase by producing the seller and
the deed of sale or witnesses to it. Otherwise he would be adjudged a
thief and die. If he proved his purchase, he had to give up the property
but had his remedy against the seller or, if he had died, could reclaim
five-fold from his estate. A man who bought a slave abroad, might find
that he had been stolen or captured from Babylonia, and he had to
restore him to his former owner without profit. If he bought property
belonging to a feudal holding, or to a ward in chancery, he had to
return it and forfeit what he gave for it as well. He could repudiate
the purchase of a slave attacked by the bennu sickness within the month
(later, a hundred days), and had a female slave three days on approval.
A defect of title or undisclosed liability would invalidate the sale at
any time.

Landowners frequently cultivated their land themselves but might employ
a husbandman or let it. The husbandman was bound to carry out the proper
cultivation, raise an average crop and leave the field in good tilth. In
case the crop failed the Code fixed a statutory return. Land might be
let at a fixed rent when the Code enacted that accidental loss fell on
the tenant. If let on share-profit, the landlord and tenant shared the
loss proportionately to their stipulated share of profit. If the tenant
paid his rent and left the land in good tilth, the landlord could not
interfere nor forbid subletting. Waste land was let to reclaim, the
tenant being rent-free for three years and paying a stipulated rent in
the fourth year. If the tenant neglected to reclaim the land the Code
enacted that he must hand it over in good tilth and fixed a statutory
rent. Gardens or plantations were let in the same ways and under the
same conditions; but for date-groves four years' free tenure was
allowed. The metayer system was in vogue, especially on temple lands.
The landlord found land, labour, oxen for ploughing and working the
watering-machines, carting, threshing or other implements, seed corn,
rations for the workmen and fodder for the cattle. The tenant, or
steward, usually had other land of his own. If he stole the seed,
rations or fodder, the Code enacted that his fingers should be cut off.
If he appropriated or sold the implements, impoverished or sublet the
cattle, he was heavily fined and in default of payment might be
condemned to be torn to pieces by the cattle on the field. Rent was as
contracted.

Irrigation was indispensable. If the irrigator neglected to repair his
dyke, or left his runnel open and caused a flood, he had to make good
the damage done to his neighbours' crops, or be sold with his family to
pay the cost. The theft of a watering-machine, water-bucket or other
agricultural implement was heavily fined.

Houses were let usually for the year, but also for longer terms, rent
being paid in advance, half-yearly. The contract generally specified
that the house was in good repair, and the tenant was bound to keep it
so. The woodwork, including doors and door frames, was removable, and
the tenant might bring and take away his own. The Code enacted that if
the landlord would re-enter before the term was up, he must remit a fair
proportion of the rent. Land was leased for houses or other buildings to
be built upon it, the tenant being rent-free for eight or ten years;
after which the building came into the landlord's possession.

Despite the multitude of slaves, hired labour was often needed,
especially at harvest. This was matter of contract, and the hirer, who
usually paid in advance, might demand a guarantee to fulfil the
engagement. Cattle were hired for ploughing, working the
watering-machines, carting, threshing, etc. The Code fixed a statutory
wage for sowers, ox-drivers, field-labourers, and hire for oxen, asses,
&c.

There were many herds and flocks. The flocks were committed to a
shepherd who gave receipt for them and took them out to pasture. The
Code fixed him a wage. He was responsible for all care, must restore ox
for ox, sheep for sheep, must breed them satisfactorily. Any dishonest
use of the flock had to be repaid ten-fold, but loss by disease or wild
beasts fell on the owner. The shepherd made good all loss due to his
neglect. If he let the flock feed on a field of corn he had to pay
damages four-fold; if he turned them into standing corn when they ought
to have been folded he paid twelve-fold.

In commercial matters, payment in kind was still common, though the
contracts usually stipulate for cash, naming the standard expected, that
of Babylon, Larsa, Assyria, Carchemish, &c. The Code enacted, however,
that a debtor must be allowed to pay in produce according to statutory
scale. If a debtor had neither money nor crop, the creditor-must not
refuse goods.

Debt was secured on the person of the debtor. Distraint on a debtor's
corn was forbidden by the Code; not only must the creditor give it back,
but his illegal action forfeited his claim altogether. An unwarranted
seizure for debt was fined, as was the distraint of a working ox. The
debtor being seized for debt could nominate as mancipium or hostage to
work off the debt, his wife, a child, or slave. The creditor could only
hold a wife or child three years as mancipium. If the mancipium died a
natural death while in the creditor's possession no claim could lie
against the latter; but if he was the cause of death by cruelty, he had
to give son for son, or pay for a slave. He could sell a slave-hostage,
unless she were a slave-girl who had borne her master children. She had
to be redeemed by her owner.

The debtor could also pledge his property, and in contracts often
pledged a field house or crop. The Code enacted, however, that the
debtor should always take the crop himself and pay the creditor from it.
If the crop failed, payment was deferred and no interest could be
charged for that year. If the debtor did not cultivate the field himself
he had to pay for the cultivation, but if the cultivation was already
finished he must harvest it himself and pay his debt from the crop. If
the cultivator did not get a crop this would not cancel his contract.
Pledges were often made where the intrinsic value of the article was
equivalent to the amount of the debt; but antichretic pledge was more
common, where the profit of the pledge was a set-off against the
interest of the debt. The whole property of the debtor might be pledged
as security for the payment of the debt, without any of it coming into
the enjoyment of the creditor. Personal guarantees were often given that
the debtor would repay or the guarantor become liable himself.

Trade was very extensive. A common way of doing business was for a
merchant to entrust goods or money to a travelling agent, who sought a
market for his goods. The caravans travelled far beyond the limits of
the empire. The Code insisted that the agent should inventory and give a
receipt for all that he received. No claim could be made for anything
not so entered. Even if the agent made no profit he was bound to return
double what he had received, if he made poor profit he had to make up
the deficiency; but he was not responsible for loss by robbery or
extortion on his travels. On his return, the principal must give a
receipt for what was handed over to him. Any false entry or claim on the
agent's part was penalised three-fold, on the principal's part six-fold.
In normal cases profits were divided according to contract, usually
equally.

A considerable amount of forwarding was done by the caravans. The
carrier gave a receipt for the consignment, took all responsibility and
exacted a receipt on delivery. If he defaulted he paid five-fold. He was
usually paid in advance. Deposit, especially warehousing of grain, was
charged for at one-sixtieth. The warehouseman took all risks, paid
double for all shortage, but no claim could be made unless be had given
a properly witnessed receipt. Water traffic on the Euphrates and canals
was early very considerable. Ships, whose tonnage was estimated at the
amount of grain they could carry, were continually hired for the a
transport of all kinds of goods. The Code fixes the price for building
and insists on the builder's giving a year's guarantee of seaworthiness.
It fixes the hire of ship and of crew. The captain was responsible for
the freight and the ship; he had to replace all loss. Even if he
refloated the ship he had to pay a fine of half its value for sinking
it. In the case of collision the boat under way was responsible for
damages to the boat at anchor. The Code also regulated the liquor
traffic, fixing a fair price for beer and forbidding the connivance of
the tavern-keeper (a female!) at disorderly conduct or treasonable
assembly, under pain of death. She was to hale the offenders to the
palace, which implied an efficient and accessible police system.

Payment through a banker or by written draft against deposit was
frequent. Bonds to pay were treated as negotiable. Interest a was rarely
charged on advances by the temple or wealthy land-owners for pressing
needs, but this may have been part of the metayer system. The borrowers
may have been tenants. Interest was charged at very high rates for
overdue loans of this kind. Merchants (and even temples in some cases)
made ordinary business loans, charging from 20 to 30%.

Marriage retained the form of purchase, but was essentially a contract
to be man and wife together. The marriage of young people was usually
arranged between the relatives, the bride- groom's father providing the
bride-price, which with other presents the suitor ceremonially presented
to the bride's father. This bride-price was usually handed over by her
father to the bride on her marriage, and so came back into the
bridegroom's possession, along with her dowry, which was her portion as
a daughter. The bride-price varied much, according to the position of
the parties, but was in excess of that paid for a slave. The Code
enacted that if the father does not, after accepting a man's presents,
give him his daughter, he, must return the presents doubled. Even if his
decision was brought about by libel on the part of the suitor's friend
this was done, and the Code enacted that the faithless friend should not
marry the girl. If a suitor changed his mind, he forfeited the presents.
The dowry might include real estate, but generally consisted of personal
effects and household furniture. It remained the wife's for life,
descending to her children, if any; otherwise returning to her family,
when the husband could deduct the bride-price if it had not been given
to her, or return it, if it had. The marriage ceremony included joining
of hands and the utterance of some formula of acceptance on the part of
the bridegroom, as "I am the son of nobles, silver and gold shall fill
thy lap, thou shalt be my wife, I will be thy husband. Like the fruit of
a garden I will give thee offspring." It must be performed by a freeman.

The marriage contract, without which the Code ruled that the woman was
no wife, usually stated the consequences to which each party was liable
for repudiating the other. These by no means necessarily agree with the
Code. Many conditions might be inserted: as that the wife should act as
maidservant to her mother-in-law, or to a first wife. The married couple
formed a unit as to external responsibility, especially for debt. The
man was responsible for debts contracted by his wife, even before her
marriage, as well as for his own; but he could use her as a mancipium.
Hence the Code allowed a proviso to be inserted in the marriage
contract, that the wife should not be seized for her husband's
prenuptial debts; but enacted that then he was not responsible for her
prenuptial debts, and, in any case, that both together were responsible
for all debts contracted after marriage. A man might make his wife a
settlement by deed of gift, which gave her a life interest in part of
his property, and he might reserve to her the right to bequeath it to a
favourite child, but she could in no case leave it to her family.
Although married she always remained a member of her father's house--she
is rarely named wife of A, usually daughter of B, or mother of C.

Divorce was optional with the man, but he had to restore the dowry and,
if the wife had borne him children, she had the custody of them. He had
then to assign her the income of field, or garden, as well as goods, to
maintain herself and children until they grew up. She then shared
equally with them in the allowance (and apparently in his estate at his
death) and was free to marry again. If she had no children, he returned
her the dowry and paid her a sum equivalent to the bride-price, or a
mina of silver, if there had been none. The latter is the forfeit
usually named in the contract for his repudiation of her.

If she had been a bad wife, the Code allowed him to send her away, while
he kept the children and her dowry; or he could degrade her to the
position of a slave in his own house, where she would have food and
clothing. She might bring an action against him for cruelty and neglect
and, if she proved her case, obtain a judicial separation, taking with
her her dowry. No other punishment fell on the man. If she did not prove
her case, but proved to be a bad wife, she was drowned. If she were left
without maintenance during her husband's involuntary absence, she could
cohabit with another man, but must return to her husband if he came
back, the children of the second union remaining with their own father.
If she had maintenance, a breach of the marriage tie was adultery.
Wilful desertion by, or exile of, the husband dissolved the marriage,
and if he came back he had no claim on her property; possibly not on his
own.

As a widow, the wife took her husband's place in the family, living on
in his house and bringing up the children. She could only remarry with
judicial consent, when the judge was bound to inventory the deceased's
estate and hand it over to her and her new husband in trust for the
children. They could not alienate a single utensil. If she did not
remarry, she lived on in her husband's house and took a child's share on
the division of his estate, when the children had grown up. She still
retained her dowry and any settlement deeded to her by her husband. This
property came to her children. If she had remarried, all her children
shared equally in her dowry, but the first husband's gift fell to his
children or to her selection among them, if so empowered.

Monogamy was the rule, and a childless wife might give her husband a
maid (who was no wife) to bear him children, who were reckoned hers. She
remained mistress of her maid and might degrade her to slavery again for
insolence, but could not sell her if she had borne her husband children.
If the wife did this, the Code did not allow the husband to take a
concubine. If she would not, he could do so. The concubine was a wife,
though not of the same rank; the first wife had no power over her. A
concubine was a free woman, was often dowered for marriage and her
children were legitimate. She could only be divorced on the same
conditions as a wife. If a wife became a chronic invalid, the husband
was bound to maintain her in the home they bad made together, unless she
preferred to take her dowry and go back to her father's house; but he
was free to remarry. In all these cases the children were legitimate and
legal heirs.

There was, of course, no hindrance to a man having children by a slave
girl. These children were free, in any case, and their mother could not
be sold, though she might be pledged, and she was free on her master's
death. These children could be legitimized by their father's
acknowledgment before witnesses, and were often adopted. They then
ranked equally in sharing their father's estate, but if not adopted, the
wife's children divided and took first choice.

Vestal virgins were not supposed to have children, yet they could and
often did marry. The Code contemplated that such a wife would give a
husband a maid as above. Free women might marry slaves and be dowered
for the marriage. The children were free, and at the slave's death the
wife took her dowry and half what she and her husband had acquired in
wedlock for self and children; the master taking the other half as his
slave's heir.

A father had control over his children till their marriage. He had a
right to their labour in return for their keep. He might hire them out
and receive their wages, pledge them for debt, even sell them outright.
Mothers had the same rights in the absence of the father; even elder
brothers when both parents were dead. A father had no claim on his
married children for support, but they retained a right to inherit on
his death.

The daughter was not only in her father's power to be given in marriage,
but he might dedicate her to the service of some god as a vestal or a
hierodule; or give her as a concubine. She had no choice in these
matters, which were often decided in her childhood. A grown-up daughter
might wish to become a votary, perhaps in preference to an uncongenial
marriage, and it seems that her father could not refuse her wish. In all
these cases the father might dower her. If he did not, on his death the
brothers were bound to do so, giving her a full child's share if a wife,
a concubine or a vestal, but one-third of a child's share if she were a
hierodule or a Marduk priestess. The latter had the privilege of
exemption from state dues and absolute disposal of her property. All
other daughters had only a life interest in their dowry, which reverted
to their family, if childless, or went to their children if they had
any. A father might, however, execute a deed granting a daughter power
to leave her property to a favourite brother or sister. A daughter's
estate was usually managed for her by her brothers, but if they did not
satisfy her, she could appoint a steward. If she married, her husband
managed it.

The son also appears to have received his share on marriage, but did not
always then leave his father's house; he might bring his wife there.
This was usual in child marriages.

Adoption was very common, especially where the father (or mother) was
childless or had seen all his children grow up and marry away. The child
was then adopted to care for the parents' old age. This was done by
contract, which usually specified what the parent had to leave and what
maintenance was expected. The real children, if any, were usually
consenting parties to an arrangement which cut off their expectations.
They even, in some cases, found the estate for the adopted child who was
to relieve them of a care. If the adopted child failed to carry out the
filial duty the contract was annulled in the law courts. Slaves were
often adopted and if they proved unfilial were reduced to slavery again.

A craftsman often adopted a son to learn the craft. He profited by the
son's labour. If he failed to teach his son the craft, that son could
prosecute him and get the contract annulled. This was a form of
apprenticeship, and it is not clear that the apprentice had any filial
relation.

A man who adopted a son, and afterwards married and had a family of his
own, could dissolve the contract but must give the adopted child
one-third of a child's share in goods, but no real estate. That could
only descend in the family to which he had ceased to belong. Vestals
frequently adopted daughters, usually other vestals, to care for their
old age.

Adoption had to be with consent of the real parents, who usually
executed a deed making over the child, who thus ceased to have any claim
upon them. But vestals, hierodules, certain palace officials and slaves
had no rights over their children and could raise no obstacle.
Foundlings and illegitimate children had no parents to object. If the
adopted child discovered his true parents and wanted to return to them,
his eye or tongue was torn out. An adopted child was a full heir, the
contract might even assign him the position of eldest son. Usually he
was residuary legatee.

All legitimate children shared equally in the father's estate at his
death, reservation being made of a bride-price for an unmarried son,
dower for a daughter or property deeded to favourite children by the
father. There was no birthright attaching to the position of eldest son,
but he usually acted as executor and after considering what each had
already received equalized the shares. He even made grants in excess to
the others from his own share. When there were two mothers, the two
families shared equally in the father's estate until later times when
the first family took two-thirds. Daughters, in the absence of sons, had
sons' rights. Children also shared their own mother's property, but had
no share in that of a stepmother.

A father could disinherit a son in early times without restriction, but
the Code insisted upon judicial consent and that only for repeated
unfilial conduct. In early times the son who denied his father had his
front hair shorn, a slave-mark put on him, and could be sold as a slave;
while if he denied his mother he had his front hair shorn, was driven
round the city as an example and expelled his home, but not degraded to
slavery.

Adultery was punished with the death of both parties by drowning, but if
the husband was willing to pardon his wife, the king might intervene to
pardon the paramour. For incest with his own mother, both were burned to
death; with a stepmother, the man was disinherited; with a daughter, the
man was exiled; with a daughter-in-law, he was drowned; with a son's
betrothed, he was fined. A wife who for her lover's sake procured her
husband's death was gibbeted. A betrothed girl, seduced by her
prospective father-in-law, took her dowry and returned to her family,
and was free to marry as she chose.

In the criminal law the ruling principle was the lex talionis. Eye for
eye, tooth for tooth, limb for limb was the penalty for assault upon an
amelu. A sort of symbolic retaliation was the punishment of the
offending member, seen in the cutting off the hand that struck a father
or stole a trust; in cutting off the breast of a wet-nurse who
substituted a changeling for the child entrusted to her; in the loss of
the tongue that denied father or mother (in the Elamite contracts the
same penalty was inflicted for perjury); in the loss of the eye that
pried into forbidden secrets. The loss of the surgeon's hand that caused
loss of life or limb or the brander's hand that obliterated a slave's
identification mark, are very similar. The slave, who struck a freeman
or denied his master, lost an ear, the organ of hearing and symbol of
obedience. To bring another into danger of death by false accusation was
punished by death. To cause loss of liberty or property by false witness
was punished by the penalty the perjurer sought to bring upon another.

The death penalty was freely awarded for theft and other crimes regarded
as coming under that head, for theft involving entrance of palace or
temple treasury, for illegal purchase from minor or slave, for selling
stolen goods or receiving the same, for common theft in the open (in
default of multiple restoration) or receiving the same, for false claim
to goods, for kidnapping, for assisting or harbouring fugitive slaves,
for detaining or appropriating same, for brigandage, for fraudulent sale
of drink, for disorderly conduct of tavern, for delegation of personal
service, for misappropriating the levy, for oppression of feudal
holders, for causing death of a householder by bad building. The manner
of death is not specified in these cases. This death penalty was also
fixed for such conduct as placed another in danger of death. A specified
form of death penalty occurs in the following cases:-gibbeting (on the
spot where crime was committed) for burglary, later also for encroaching
on the king's highway, for getting a slave-brand obliterated, for
procuring husband's death; burning for incest with own mother, for
vestal entering or opening tavern, for theft at fire (on the spot);
drowning for adultery, rape of betrothed maiden, bigamy, bad conduct as
wife, seduction of daughter-in-law.

A curious extension of the talio is the death of creditor's son for his
father's having caused the death of debtor's son as mancipium; of
builder's son for his father's causing the death of house-owner's son by
building the house badly; the death of a man's daughter because her
father caused the death of another man's daughter.

The contracts naturally do not concern such criminal cases as the above,
as a rule, but marriage contracts do specify death by strangling,
drowning, precipitation from a tower or pinnacle of the temple or by the
iron sword for a wife's repudiation of her husband. We are quite without
evidence as to the executive in all these cases.

Exile was inflicted for incest with a daughter; disinheritance for
incest with a stepmother or for repeated unfilial conduct. Sixty strokes
of an ox-hide scourge were awarded for a brutal assault on a superior,
both being amelu. Branding (perhaps the equivalent of degradation to
slavery) was the penalty for slander of a married woman or vestal.
Deprivation of office in perpetuity fell upon the corrupt judge.
Enslavement befell the extravagant wife and unfilial children.
Imprisonment was common, but is not recognized by the Code.

The commonest of all penalties was a fine. This is awarded by the Code
for corporal injuries to a muskinu or slave (paid to his master); for
damages done to property, for breach of contract. The restoration of
goods appropriated, illegally bought or damaged by neglect, was usually
accompanied by a fine, giving it the form of multiple restoration. This
might be double, treble, fourfold, fivefold, sixfold, tenfold,
twelvefold, even thirtyfold, according to the enormity of the offence.

The Code recognized the importance of intention. A man who killed
another in a quarrel must swear he did not do so intentionally, and was
then only fined according to the rank of the deceased. The Code does not
say what would be the penalty of murder, but death is so often awarded
where death is caused that we can hardly doubt that the murderer was put
to death. If the assault only led to injury and was unintentional, the
assailant in a quarrel had to pay the doctor's fees. A brander, induced
to remove a slave's identification mark, could swear to his ignorance
and was free. The owner of an ox which gored a man on the street was
only responsible for damages if, the ox was known by him to be vicious,
even if it caused death. If the mancipium died a natural death under the
creditor's hand, the creditor was scot free. In ordinary cases
responsibility was not demanded for accident or for more than proper
care. Poverty excused bigamy on the part of a deserted wife.

On the other hand carelessness and neglect were severely punished, as in
the case of the unskilful physician, if it led to loss of life or limb
his hands were cut off, a slave had to be replaced, the loss of his eye
paid for to half his value; a veterinary surgeon who caused the death of
an ox or ass paid quarter value; a builder, whose careless workmanship
caused death, lost his life or paid for it by the death of his child,
replaced slave or goods, and in any case had to rebuild the house or
make good any damages due to defective building and repair the defect as
well. The boat-builder had to make good any defect of construction or
damage due to it for a year's warranty.

Throughout the Code respect is paid to status.

Suspicion was not enough. The criminal must be taken in the act, e.g.
the adulterer, ravisher, &c. A man could not be convicted of theft
unless the goods were found in his possession.

In the case of a lawsuit the plaintiff preferred his own plea. There is
no trace of professional advocates, but the plea had to be in writing
and the notary doubtless assisted in the drafting of it. The judge saw
the plea, called the other parties before him and sent for the
witnesses. If these were not at hand he might adjourn the case for their
production, specifying a time up to six months. Guarantees might be
entered into to produce the witnesses on a fixed day. The more important
cases, especially those involving life and death, were tried by a bench
of judges. With the judges were associated a body of elders, who shared
in the decision, but whose exact function is not yet clear. Agreements,
declarations and non-contentious cases are usually witnessed by one
judge and twelve elders.

Parties and witnesses were put on oath. The penalty for the false
witness was usually that which would have been awarded the convicted
criminal. In matters beyond the knowledge of men, as the guilt or
innocence of an alleged wizard or a suspected wife, the ordeal by water
was used. The accused jumped into the sacred river, and the innocent
swam while the guilty drowned. The accused could clear himself by oath
where his own knowledge was alone available. The plaintiff could swear
to his loss by brigands, as to goods claimed, the price paid for a slave
purchased abroad or the sum due to him. But great stress was laid on the
production of written evidence. It was a serious thing to lose a
document. The judges might be satisfied of its existence and terms by
the evidence of the witnesses to it, and then issue an order that
whenever found it should be given up. Contracts annulled were ordered to
be broken. The court might go a journey to view the property and even
take with them the sacred symbols on which oath was made.

The decision given was embodied in writing, sealed and witnessed by the
judges, the elders, witnesses and a scribe. Women might act in all these
capacities. The parties swore an oath, embodied in the document, to
observe its stipulations. Each took a copy and one was held by the
scribe to be stored in the archives.

Appeal to the king was allowed and is well attested. The judges at
Babylon seem to have formed a superior court to those of provincial
towns, but a defendant might elect to answer the charge before the local
court and refuse to plead at Babylon.

Finally, it may be noted that many immoral acts, such as the use of
false weights, lying, &c., which could not be brought into court, are
severely denounced in the Omen Tablets as likely to bring the offender
into "the hand of God" as opposed to "the hand of the king."
