# The Code of Hammurabi

### Translated by L. W. King

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This, the earliest known written legal code, was composed about 1780
B.C.E. by Hammurabi, the ruler of Bablyon. This text was excavated in
1901; it was carved on an eight foot high stone monolith. The harsh
system of punishment expressed in this text prefigures the concept of
'an eye for an eye'. The Code lays out the basis of both criminal and
civil law, and defines procedures for commerce and trade. This text was
redacted for 1,500 years, and is considered the predecessor of Jewish
and Islamic legal systems alike.

At the other end of the evolution of Ancient Near Eastern law is the
refined and considerably more merciful
[Talmud](../../jud/index.htm#talmud.md), composed two and half millenia
later, also in Babylon, by expatriate Jewish scholars.
