<p>(<i>About a column and a half of the beginning of the Old Babylonian version on the Yale tablet are so broken that almost all the text is lost. Gilgamish and Enkidu have now become devoted friends, thus strangely stultifying the purpose for which Enkidu was created, and now is set afoot the great expedition against the famous Cedar Forest guarded by the Ogre Humbaba. The courtesan has now for a brief space left the scene, having deserted Enkidu, much to his sorrow. The mutilated Assyrian Version gives a hint that the mother of Gilgamish is now describing the fight to one of her ladies(?) Rishat-Nin . . . and where her recital becomes connected the story runs thus</i>).</p>

The Old Babylonian Version runs (Column II. 26 "The eyes [of Enkidu fill'd] with tears, his heart was [heavy] and . . . he mourned, his heart [was heavy], and . . . he mourn 'd. [Gilgamish] lifted up his face, [spake] to Enkidu: ' [Why] are thine eyes [full of tears] (and) thy [heart heavy]? [Why dost thou] mourn?' [Enkidu answer'd] and spake to Gilgamish:" and then it continues as above in the text.</P>

It may be that this represents the words for saying farewell, without any further explanation, just as our "God be with you" has become, "Good-bye."

<P><A NAME="fn_55"></A><A HREF="eog05.htm#fr_61">23:1</A> Lugal-banda appears to be the tutelary god of Gilgamish, and possibly his father: he and Tammuz are the two kings of Erech preceding Gilgamish in the Kings lists.</P>
