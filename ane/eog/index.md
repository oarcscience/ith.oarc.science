This is one of the first essentially complete academic translations of
the epic of Gilgamesh. It includes all of the principal episodes of the
epic: the wild man Enkidu; the battle with Humbaba, the cedar forest
demon; the death of Enkidu, the journey of Gilgamesh to find the secret
of eternal life, in the course of which he encounters the Babylonian
Noah, Uta-Napishtim, and hears the story of the great flood.

Oxford trained Thompson (1876-1941), was an Assyriologist associated
with the British Museum. He was a teacher both of T.E. Lawrence and Max
Mallowan, husband of Agatha Cristie. He excavated at Ur, Ninevah and
Carchemish.

While often cited, this book is almost never seen. This work is long out
of print (in fact it has never been reprinted) and extremely rare, even
in libraries. However, it has a huge significance because it is one of
the baseline translations of Gilgamesh. Because of its date of
publication, under US copyright law it is formally still under
copyright. Since there was no copyright notice in the original, the US
copyright lasts for 70 years following the death of the author (i.e.,
2011). We have attempted to locate the current copyright holder with no
success. If one comes forward and requests that this electronic text be
removed, it will be taken down without notice.
