### THE SEVENTH TABLET.

#### THE DEATH OF ENKIDU.

*Column I*.

(*Enkidu's dream*).

"Why, O my friend, do the great gods (now) take counsel together?"

(*The remainder of the Column is lost in the Assyrian, but it can be
partially supplied from the Hittite Version:* <span
id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) *" . . . Then came the day . . .*
\[*Enkidu*\] *answered Gilgamish: '*\[*Gilgamish, hear the*\] *dream
which I* \[*saw*\] *in the night:* \[*Now Enlil*\]*, Ea, and the Sun-god
of heaven . . . .*\[*the Sun-god (?)*\] *Enlil spake in* 

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

*return: "*\[*These who the heavenly*\] *Bull have kill’d* \[*and
Humbaba have smitten*\]*:. . . which help’d at the cedar . . .* \[*Enlil
hath said* (*?*)\] *'Enkidu shall die:* \[*but Gilgamish*\] *shall not
die.'" Then answer’d Enlil boldly '*\[*O Sun-god*\]*, at thy behest did
they slay the Heavenly Bull and Humbaba. But now shall Enkidu die.' But
Enlil turn’d angrily to the Sun-god: 'What dost thou them as befitting .
. .? With his comrade thou settest out daily. '" But Enkidu laid himself
down to rest before Gilgamish, and by the dam . . . him the ditch: 'My
brother, of* (*great*) *worth is my* \[*dream*\]*.'" It breaks off after
a few mutilated lines more*).

(*Column II entirely lost. From the Hittite it is clear that Enkidu has
dreamt that the gods have taken counsel together, that Enkidu is to die,
but Gilgamish remain alive. It would appear from the succeeding material
that Enkidu, stricken presumably by fever, attributes all his
misfortunes to the hetaera whom he loads with curses. The first part of
the next fragment begins "destroy his power, weaken his strength,"
probably referring to Enkidu. Then says Enkidu, after three broken
lines: ". . . . the hetaera . . . . who has brought* (*?*) *a curse, 'O
hetaera, I will decree* (*thy*) \[*fate*(*?*)\] *for thee—thy
woes*(*?*)\] *. . . shall never end for all eternity.* \[*Come*\]*, I
will curse thee with a bitter curse, . . . with desolation shall its
curse come on thee:* \[*may there never be*\] *satisfaction of thy
desire' —and then follow the broken ends of six lines and then—"'*\[*May
. . .*\] *fall on thy house, may the . . of the street be thy dwelling,*
\[*may the shade of the wall be thy*\] *abode, . . . for thy feet,*
\[*may scorching heat and thirsty smite thy strength'" The rest of the
curse is badly broken, but it is exceeding probable that the following
are the fragments which should be assigned here*).

(*The End of Enkidu's curse on the Hetaera*).

<span class="margnote">30.</span>"Of want . . . . since me it is that .
. .hath . . . .  
And me the fever \[hath laid\] on my back."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(*The Answer of Shamash*).

Heard him the Sun-god, and open’d his mouth, and from out of the
heavens  
(Straightway) he call’d him: "O Enkidu, why dost thou curse the hetaera?

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="margnote">35.</span>She ’twas who made thee eat bread, for
divinity proper: (aye), wine (too),  
She made thee drink, (’twas) for royalty proper: a generous mantle  
Put on thee, (aye), and for comrade did give to thee Gilgamish
splendid.  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>Now on a couch of great size will he,
(thy) friend (and) thy brother  
Gilgamish, grant thee to lie, on a handsome couch will he grant thee  
Rest, and to sit on a throne of great ease, a throne at (his) left
hand,  
So that the princes of Hades <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_89.md) may
kiss thy feet (in their homage);  
He, too, will make (all) the people of Erech lament in thy (honour),  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>Making them mourn thee, (and) damsels
(and) heroes constrain to thy service,  
\[While he himself for thy sake will cause his body to carry  
Stains, \[(and) will put on\] the skin of a lion <span
id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_90.md), and range o’er the desert."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Enkidu \[(then) giving ear\] to the words of the valiant Shamash  
Speaking . . . . . . . . . his wrath was appeased.

(*One or two lines missing*).

*Column IV*.

(Enkidu, relenting, regrets his curse, and blesses the Hetaera).  
" . . . . . . . . . . . may . . . restore to thy place!  
\[(So, too), may monarchs and princes\] and chiefs be with love \[for
thee\] smitten;  
\[None smite (?)\] his breech \[in disgust (?); against thee; and for
thee may the hero\]  
Comb out his locks; . . . who would embrace \[thee\],  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Let him his girdle unloose . . . and thy
\[bed\] be azure and golden;  
May . . . entreat thee kindly (?), . . . . are heap’d his *ishshikku*  
May the gods make thee enter . . . . . . . . . . .  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>\[Mayst thou\] be left as the mother of
seven brides . . ."

(*Enkidu, sorrowful at his approaching end, sleeps alone and dreams*).

\[Enkidu\] . . . woe in his belly . . . sleeping alone,  
\[Came\] in the night \[to discover\] his heaviness unto his comrade:  
"\[Friend\], (O) a dream I have seen in my night-time: the firmament
\[roaring\],  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Echo’d the earth, and I \[by myself was
standing(?) . . .  
\[When perceived I a man (?)\], (all) dark was his face, \[and\] was
liken 'd  
\[Unto\] . . .his face, . . . \[and\] his nails like claws of a
lion. <span id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_91.md)  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>Me did he overcome . . . climbing up .
. . press’d me down,  
Upon me . . . my (?) body . . . . . .

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

(*Here follows a gap of perhaps three lines, until what is still
presumably the dream is again taken up by the other half of the Column
at l.* 31 (*?*) *with a description of the Underworld which is being
shewn to Enkidu in premonition of his death*).

<span class="margnote">33.</span>. . . . . . . . like birds my hands:
(and) he seized (?) me,  
Me did he lead to the Dwelling of Darkness, the home of Irkalla, <span
id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_92.md)  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>Unto the Dwelling from which he who
entereth cometh forth never!  
(Aye), by the road on the passage whereof there can be no returning,  
Unto the Dwelling whose tenants are (ever) bereft of the daylight,  
Where for their food is the dust, and the mud is their sustenance:
bird-like  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>Wear they a garment of feathers: and,
sitting (there) in the darkness,  
Never the light will they see. On the Gate . . . . when I enter’d  
On the house (?) . . . . was humbled the crown,  
For . . . those who (wore) crowns, who of old ruled over the country,  
. . . . of Anu and Enlil ’twas they set the bakemeats,  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>Set . . . ., cool was the water they
served from the skins. When I enter’d  
Into (this) House of the Dust, were High Priest and acolyte sitting,  
Seer and magician <span id="fr_101"></span>[2](#fn_93.md), the priest who
the Sea of the great gods anointed <span
id="fr_102"></span>[3](#fn_94.md),  
(Here) sat Etana <span id="fr_103"></span>[4](#fn_95.md), Sumuqan; the
Queen of the Underworld (also),  
Ereshkigal <span id="fr_104"></span>[5](#fn_96.md), in whose presence doth
bow the Recorder of Hades,  
\[Belit\]-seri, and readeth before her; \[she lifted\] her head (and)
beheld me,  
. . . and took this . . . . . . . . . . . . .
