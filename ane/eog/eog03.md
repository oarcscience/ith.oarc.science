# THE EPIC OF GILGAMISH.

### THE FIRST TABLET

#### OF THE TYRANNY OF GILGAMISH, AND THE CREATION OF ENKIDU.

*Column I*.

(*The Argument*).

 <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)He who (the heart of.md) all matters hath
proven let him \[teach\] the nation,  
\[He who all\] knowledge possesseth, therein shall he \[school\] all the
people,  
\[He shall his wisdom impart (?)\] and (so) shall they \]share it\]
together.  
\[Gilgamish(?)\] <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)—he was the \[Master\]
of wisdom, with \[knowledge of all things,  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>He ’twas discovered the secret concealed
. . . . . . . . .  
(Aye), handed down the tradition relating to (things) prediluvian,  
Went on a journey afar, (all) aweary and \[worn with his toiling(?)\],  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>\[Graved\] on a table of stone all the
travail.  
                                          Of Erech, the high-wall’d,  
He (it was) built up the ramparts; (and) he (it was) clamp’d the
foundation,  
Like unto brass, of \[E\]-Anna <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md), the
sacred, the treasury hallow’d,  
\[Strengthen’d\] its base to grant wayleave to no \[one\] . . . . . .  
. . . . . the threshold which from \[of old (?)\] . . . . . .  
. . . . . \[E\]-Anna . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(?)\] . . . . . . .

(*About thirty lines wanting. The description of Gilgamish runs on to
the beginning of the next Column*).

*Column II*.

Two-thirds of him are divine, and \[one-third of him human,\] <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) . . .

The form of his body . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

He hath forced to take . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(*Gap of about three lines*).

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

(*The Plaint of Erech*(?) *to the gods against the tyrant Gilgamish*)

<span class="margnote">7.</span>". . . . . . . . of Erech ’tis he who
hath \[taken\],  
. . . . . . . . . (while) tow’reth \[his\] crest like an aurochs,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Ne’er hath the shock of \[his\] weapons
(its) \[peer\]; are driven \[his\] fellows  
Into the toils <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md), while cow’d are the
heroes of Erech un- . . . . .  
Gilgamish leaveth no son to \[his\] father, \[his\] arrogance swelling  
(Each) day and \[night\]; \[aye, he\] is the shepherd of Erech, the
high-\[wall’d\],  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>He is \[our(?)\] shepherd . . . .
\[masterful, dominant, subtle\] . . .  
\[Gilgamish\] leaveth no \[maid to her mother, nor\] daughter to
\[hero\],  
\[(Nay), nor a spouse to a husband\]"  
                                         (And so), to (th’ appeal of)
their wailing  
\[Gave ear th’ Immortals\]: the gods of high heaven address’d the god
Anu\], <span id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md)  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>(Him who was) Seigneur of Erech: "’Tis
thou a son hast begotten,  
(Aye, in sooth, all) tyrannous, \[while tow’reth his crest like an
aurochs\],  
Ne’er hath \[the shock of his weapons\] (its) peer; are driven \[his
fellows\]  
Into the toils, awhile cow’d are the heroes of Erech un- . . . .\] <span
id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_5.md).  
Gilgamish leaveth no son to his father, \[his arrogance swelling\]  
(Each) day and night; aye, he is the shepherd of Erech, \[the
high-wall’d\],  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>He is their shepherd . . . masterful,
dominant, subtle . . .  
Gilgamish leaveth no maid to \[her mother\], nor daughter to hero,  
(Nay), nor a spouse to a \[husband\]."  
                                      (And so), to (th’ appeal of) their
wailing  
30. \[Anu\] <span id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_5.md) gave ear, call’d the lady
Aruru <span id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_6.md): "’Twas thou, O Aruru,  
Madest \[(primeval seed of) mankind(?)\]: do now make its fellow,  
So that he \[happen on Gilgamish\], yea, on the day of his pleasure,  
So that they strive with each other, and he unto Erech give
\[surcease\]."

(*The Creation of Enkidu*).

So when the goddess Aruru heard this, in her mind she imagined  
(Straightway, this) Concept of Anu, and, washing her hands, (then)
Aruru  
Finger’d some clay, on the desert she moulded <span
id="fr_9"></span>[4](#fn_7) (it): \[(thus.md) on the desert\]  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>Enkidu made she, a warrior, (as he
were) born (and) begotten,  
(Yea), of Ninurta <span id="fr_10"></span>[5](#fn_8.md) the double, \[and
put forth\] the whole of his body  
Hair: in the way of a woman he snooded his locks (in a fillet);  
Sprouted luxuriant growth of his hair-like (the awns of) the barley,  
Nor knew he people nor land; he was clad in a garb like Sumuqan <span
id="fr_11"></span>[6](#fn_9.md).

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="margnote">40.</span>E’en with gazelles did he pasture on
herbage, along with the cattle  
Drank he his fill, with the beasts did his heart delight at the water.

(*The Encounter of Enkidu with the Hunter*).

(Then) did a hunter, a trapper, come face to face with this (fellow),  
Came on him \[one\], two, three days, at the place where (the beasts)
drank (their) water <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_10.md);  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>(Sooth), when the hunter espied him,
his face o’ermantled with terror,  
He and his cattle went unto his steading, \[dismay’d\] (and)
affrighted,  
Crying aloud, \[distress’d in, his heart, and) his face overclouded,  
. . . . woe in his belly . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
<span class="margnote">50.</span>(Aye, and) his face was the same as of
one \[who hath gone\] a far \[journey\].

*Column III*.

Open’d \[his mouth (then)\] the hunter, and spake, addressing \[his
father\]:  
"Father, there is \[a\] great fellow come \[forth from out of the
mountains\],  
(O, but) \[his\] strength is the greatest \[(the length and breadth) of
the country\],  
\[Like to a double\] of Anu's own self \[his strength\] is enormous,  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Ever (?) \[he rangeth at large\] o’er
the mountains, \[(and) ever\] with cattle  
\[Grazeth on herbage (and) ever he setteth\] his foot to the water,  
\[So that I fear\] to approach him. The pits which I \[myself\]
hollow’d  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>\[(With mine own hands) <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_11) hath he fill’d in (again)\], (and.md) the
traps of my \[setting\]  
\[Torn up, (and) out of my clutches hath holpen escape\] (all) the
cattle,  
Beasts of the desert: to work at my fieldcraft \[he will not allow\]
me."

\[Open’d his mouth (then) his father, and spake\], addressing the
hunter:  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>"Gilgamish \[dwelleth\] in Erech, \[my
son, whom no one\] hath vanquish’d,  
 <span id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_12)\[(Nay, but.md) ’tis his strength is
greatest (the length and breadth) of the country\]  
\[Like to a double of Anu's own self\], his strength is \[enormous\],  
 <span id="fr_15"></span>[4](#fn_13.md)\[Go, set\] thy face \[towards
Erech: and when he hears of\] a monster,  
 <span id="fr_16"></span>[4](#fn_13.md)\[He will say 'Go, O hunter, a
courtesan-girl, a hetaera\]

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

<span class="margnote">20.</span>Take \[with thee\] . . . . . . . like a
strong one;  
 <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)\[When he the cattle shall gather
again\] to the place of (their) drinking,  
\[So shall she put off\] her \[mantle\] (the charm of) her beauty
\[revealing\];  
\[(Then) shall he spy her, and (sooth) will embrace her, (and
thenceforth)  
his cattle,  
\[Which in\] his very own deserts \[were rear’d\], will (straightway)
deny him.'"

(*How Gilgamish first heard of Enkidu*).

<span class="margnote">25.</span>Unto the rede of his father the hunter
\[hath hearken’d, (and straightway)\]  
He will away \[unto Gilgamish\] <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_14.md).  
                                            Taking the road towards
Erech  
Turn’d he \[his steps, and to\] Gilgamish \[came, his speech thus
addressing\]:  
(Saying): "There is a great fellow \[come forth from out of the
mountains\],  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>\[(O, but) his strength\] is the
greatest, (the length and breadth) of the country,  
Like to a double of Anu's own self \[his strength\] is enormous,  
\[Ever (?)\] he rangeth at large o’er the mountains, (and) ever with
cattle  
\[Grazeth on herbage, (and)\] ever \[he setteth\] his foot to the
water,  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>So that I fear to approach \[him\] .
The pits which I \[myself\] hollow’d  
(With mine own hands) hath he fill’d in (again, and) the traps of my
\[setting\]  
Torn up, (and) out of my clutches hath holpen escape (all) the cattle,  
Beasts \[of the desert\]: to work at my fieldcraft he will not allow
me."  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>Gilgamish unto him, unto the hunter
made answer (in this wise):  
"Go, (good) my hunter, take with thee a courtesan-girl, a hetaera,  
When he the cattle shall \[gather\] again to the place of (their)
drinking,  
So shall she put off her mantle, (the charm of her) beauty
\[revealing\],  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>(Then) shall he spy her, and (sooth)
will embrace her, (and thenceforth) his cattle  
Which in his very own deserts were rear’d will (straightway) deny
him. <span id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_15.md)"

(*The Seduction of Enkidu*).

Forth went the hunter, took with him a courtesan-girl, a hetaera,  
(So) did they start on their travels, went forth on their journey
(together),  
(Aye), at the term of three days arrived at the pleasaunce appointed.  
Sate they down in their ambush (?), the hunter and the hetaera,  
<span class="margnote">50.</span>One day, two days they sat by the place
where (the beasts) drank (their) water.

(Then) at last came the cattle to take their fill in their drinking.

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

*Column IV*.

Thither the animals came that their hearts might delight in the water,  
(Aye), there was Enkidu also, he whom the mountains had gender’d,  
E’en with gazelles did he pasture on herbage, along with the cattle  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Drank he his fill <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_16.md), with the beasts did his heart delight at
the water,  
So beheld him the courtesan-girl, the lusty great fellow,  
(O but) a monster (all) savage from out of the depths of the desert!  
"’Tis he, O girl! O, discover thy beauty, thy comeliness shew (him),  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>So that thy loveliness he may
possess—(O), in no wise be bashful,  
Ravish the soul of him—(certes), as soon as his eye on thee falleth,  
He, forsooth, will approach thee, and thou—O, loosen thy mantle,  
So that he clasp thee, and (then) with the wiles of a woman shalt ply
him;  
(Wherefore) his animals, bred in his desert, will (straightway) deny
him,  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>(Since) to his breast he hath held
thee."  
                                           The girl, displaying her
bosom,  
Shew’d him her comeliness, (yea) so that he of her beauty possess’d
him,  
Bashful she was not, (but) ravish’d the soul of him, loosing her
mantle,  
So that he clasp’d her, (and then) with the wiles of a woman she plied
him,  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>Holding her unto his breast.  
                                         (’Twas thus that) Enkidu
dallied  
Six days, (aye) seven nights, with the courtesan-girl in his mating.

(*How Enkidu was inveigled into Erech to fight with Gilgamish*).

Sated at length with her charms, he turn’d his face to his cattle,  
O the gazelles, (how) they scamper’d away, as soon as they saw him!  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>Him, yea, Enkidu,—fled from his
presence the beasts of the desert!  
Enkidu losing his innocence <span id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_17.md)—so, when
the cattle fled from him,  
Failed his knees, and he  <span id="fr_22"></span>[3](#fn_18.md)slack’d in
his running, (not) as aforetime:  
Natheless he (thus) hath attain’d his full growth and hath broaden’d
(his) wisdom.  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>Sat he again <span
id="fr_23"></span>[4](#fn_19.md) at the feet of the woman, the woman his
features <span id="fr_24"></span>[5](#fn_20.md)  
Scanning, and, while she <span id="fr_25"></span>[6](#fn_21.md) was
speaking, his ears heard (the words) she <span
id="fr_26"></span>[7](#fn_22.md) was saying:  
"Comely thou art, e’en like to a god, O Enkidu, shalt be,  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>Why with the beasts (of the field) dost
thou (ever) range over the desert?  
Up! for I'll lead thee to Erech, the high-wall'd—(in sooth), to the
Temple  
Sacred, the dwelling of Anu and Ishtar, where, highest in power,  
Gilgamish is, and prevaileth o’er men like an aurochs."

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

                                         <span
class="margnote">40.</span>Her counsel  
E’en as she spake it found favour, (for) conscious he was of his
longing  
Some companion to seek; so unto the courtesan spake he <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_23.md):  
"Up, then, O girl, to the Temple, the holy (and) sacred, invite me,  
45. Me, to the dwelling of Anu and Ishtar, where, highest in power,  
Gilgamish is, and prevaileth o’er men like an aurochs—for I, too,

*Column V*.

I, I will summon him, challenging boldly (and) crying through Erech,  
'I too, am mighty!' Nay, I, forsooth \[I\], will (e’en) destiny alter—  
(Truly), ’tis he who is born in the desert whose vigour \[is
greatest!\]  
. . . . . . . . . . . . . I will \[please\] thee,  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>. . . . . . . . . . . . .  \[whatever\]
there be, that would I know."  
"Enkidu, come (then) to \[Erech\], the high-wall’d, \[where\] people
\[array\] them  
\[Gorgeous\] in festal attire, (and) each day the day is a revel,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>\[Eunuch\]-priests \[clashing\] (their)
cymbals, and \[dancing\]-girls . . . . .  
. . . flown with their wantoning, gleeful, and keeping the nobles  
Out of their beds <span id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_24)! (Nay.md), Enkidu,
\[joy\] in thy life (to its fullest)  
\[Thou shalt\] taste—(forsooth) will I shew thee a man who is happy,  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Gilgamish! View him, O look on his
face, (how) comely his manhood!  
Dower’d with lustiness is he, the whole of his body with power  
Brimming, \[his\] vigour is stronger than thine, (all) day and night
restless!  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>Enkidu, temper thine
arrogance—Gilgamish, loveth him Shamash,  
Anu, (and) Enlil <span id="fr_29"></span>[3](#fn_25.md), and Ea <span
id="fr_30"></span>[4](#fn_26.md) have dower’d his wisdom with largesse.

(*How Gilgamish dreamt of Enkidu*).

(Sooth), or ever from out of thy mountains thou camest, in Erech  
25. Gilgamish thee had beheld in a dream; so, Gilgamish coming  
Spake to his mother, the dream to reveal.  
                                         'O my mother, a vision  
Which I beheld in my night-time. (Behold), there were stars of the
heavens,  
When something like unto Anu's own self fell down on my shoulders,  
30. (Ah, though) I heaved him, he was o’erstrong for me, (and though)
his grapple  
Loosed I, I was unable to shake him (from off me): (and now, all the
meanwhile),  
People from Erech were standing about \[him <span
id="fr_31"></span>[5](#fn_27.md), the\] artisans \[pressing\].

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<span class="margnote">35.</span>On \[him behind\], (while) throng’d him
\[the heroes\]; my (very) companions  
Kissing \[his\] feet; \[I, I to my breast\] like a woman did hold him,  
(Then) \[I\] presented him low at \[thy\] feet, \[that\] as mine own
equal.  
\[Thou\] might’st account him.'  
 <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_28.md)\[She\] who knoweth all wisdom
(thus) to her Seigneur she answer’d,  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>\[She\] who knoweth all wisdom, to
Gilgamish (thus) did she answer:  
'(Lo), by the stars of the heavens are represented thy \[comrades\],  
\[That which was like unto\] Anu's \[own self\], which fell on thy
shoulders,  
\[Which thou didst heave, but he was, o’erstrong for thee, \[(aye),
though his grapple  
Thou didst unloose\], but to shake him from off thee thou wert \[un\]
able,  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>\[So didst present\] him low at my
feet, \[that\] as thine own equal  
\[I might\] account him—\[and thou to thy breast like a woman\] didst
hold him:

*Column VI*.

\[This is a stoutheart, a\] friend, one ready to stand by \[a
comrade\],  
One whose strength \[is the greatest, (the length and breadth) of the
country\],  
\[Like to a double of Anu's own self his\] strength is enormous.  
\[(Now), since thou\] to thy breast didst hold him \[the way of a
woman\],  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>\[This is a sign that\] thou art the one
he will \[never\] abandon:  
\[This\] of thy dream is the \[meaning\].'  
                                      \[Again he spake\] to his
mother,  
'\[Mother\], a second dream \[did I\] see: \[Into Erech, the
high-wall'd\],  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Hurtled an axe, and they gather’d about
it: \[the meanwhile, from Erech\]  
\[People\] were standing about it, \[the people\] (all) thronging before
it,  
\[Artisans pressing\] behind it, \[while\] I at thy feet did present
it,  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>\[I\], like a woman I held it to me
\[that\] thou might’st account it,  
As mine own equal.'  
\[She the \[all\]-wise, who knoweth all wisdom, (thus) answer’d her
offspring,  
\[She the all-wise\] who knoweth all wisdom, to Gilgamish answer'd:  
'(Lo, that) \[Axe\] thou didst see (is) a Man; like a woman didst hold
him,  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>Unto thy breast, \[that\] as thine own
equal I might account him,  
\[This\] is a stoutheart, a friend, one ready to stand by a comrade,  
One whose strength is the \[greatest (the length and breadth) of the
country\],  
(Like to a double of\] Anu's \[own self\], his strength is enormous.'  
\[Gilgamish open’d his mouth, and\] addressing his mother, (thus spake
he):  
'\[Though\] great \[danger (?)\] befall, \[a friend (?)\] shall I have .

(*The Assyrian Edition of the seventh century has three more lines on
the First Tablet, which correspond with Column II, l. 3 of the Second
Tablet of the Old Babylonian Edition. This latter has already begun with
the episode of the two dreams, approximately Column V, l. 24 of the
Assyrian First Tablet, and the text is so similar in both that I have
not repeated it here. The Old Babylonian Edition here takes up the
story, repeating one or two details*).
