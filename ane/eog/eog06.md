### THE FOURTH TABLET.

#### THE ARRIVAL AT THE GATE OF THE FOREST.

(*Of Column I about ll.* 1-36 *are mutilated or missing, there being
actually the beginnings of only sixteen lines. When the text becomes
connected the heroes have reached the Gate of the Forest*).

*Column I*.

(*Enkidu addresses the Gate*).

<span class="margnote">36.</span> <span
id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_62)Enkidu lifted \[his eyes\] . . . and spake
with the Gate as \[’t were human(?)\]:  
"O thou Gate of the Forest without understanding(? . . .  
Sentience which thou hast not, . . . .

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="margnote">40.</span>I for (full) forty leagues have admired
thy \[wonderful\] timber,  
(Aye), till I sighted the towering Cedar . . . .  
(O but) thy wood hath no peer (in the country) . . .  
Six *gar* thy height, and two *gar* thy breadth . . .  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>(Sooth, but) thy stanchion (?), thy
socket (?), <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_63) thy pivot (?), thy lock
(?), and thy shutter (?),  
\[(All of them) must have been fashion’d for thee\] in the City of
Nippur!  
O, if I had but known, O Gate, that this was \[thy grandeur\],  
This, too, the grace \[of thy structure\], then either an axe had I
lifted  
<span class="margnote">50.</span>Or I had . . . or bound together . . .
."

(*Of the next Column remains a fragment, and that only presumed to
belong to one of the above fragments from its appearance, which speaks
of terror, a dream, and sorrow: "let me pray the gods . . . . may thy?
god be . . . the father of the gods." Again, of the third Column there
is only a small portion left of the right half* (*this fragment, too,
being also presumed to belong to the same tablet as that
above-mentioned*)*, speaking of Gilgamish, the Forest, and Enkidu. The
fourth Column is entirely lost. Of Column V the latter part survives, in
this case without any uncertainty. After a few broken lines it runs as
follows, the first speaker being probably Enkidu, and the scene the Gate
of the Forest*):

<span class="margnote">6.</span>". . . \[O, haste\] thee, withstand him,
he will not \[pursue(?) thee\],  
\[We will\] go on down into the wood not daunted, together (?)\].  
. . . Thou shall put on seven garments ..  
. . . putting on, and six . . . (?) . . . "  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>He like a mighty wild bull . . .  
Flung he the Portal afar, and \[his\] mouth was fill’d (with his
challenge),  
Cried to the Guard of the Forest: "Up (?) . . . !  
\[’Tis I will challenge\] Humbaba like to a . . ."

(*A small gap*.)

*Column VI*.

(*Enkidu is speaking*)

"Trouble (?) \[I foresee(?)\] wherever I go . . . .  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>O my friend, I have \[seen\] <span
id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_64) a dream which un- . . . ."  
The day of the dream he had seen fulfilled . . . . <span
id="fr_71"></span>[3](#fn_65)

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

(Enkidu is stricken with fear at thought of the combat).  
Enkidu lay for a day, \[yea, a second\]—for Enkidu \[lying\]  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>(Prone) on his couch, was a third and a
fourth day . . ., a fifth, sixth and seventh,  
Eighth, ninth, \[and tenth\]. While Enkidu \[lay in his\] sickness . .
., th’ eleventh,  
(Aye, till) the twelfth . . . on \[his\] couch was Enkidu \[lying\].  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Call’d he to Gilgamish, . . . . . . . .
.  
"(O but), my comrade, . . . hateth me . . because within Erech  
I was afraid of the combat, and . . . My friend, who in battle . . ."

(*A small gap in which Gilgamish has answered. Enkidu replies*):

<span class="margnote">26.</span>\[Enkidu open’d\] his \[mouth\] and
spake \[unto Gilgamish, saying\]:  
("Nay, but), \[my friend, let us no wise\] go down \[to the depths of
the Forest\],  
(For) ’tis my hands \[have grown weak\], and \[my arms\] are stricken
with palsy."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Gilgamish open’d his mouth and spake \[unto Enkidu\], saying:  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>"Shall we, O friend, \[play\] the
coward? . . . . . .  
. . . . thou shalt surpass them all(?) . . . .  
\[Thou, O\] my friend, art cunning in warfare, art \[shrewd(?)\] in the
battle,  
(So) shalt thou touch the . . . and of \[death\] have no terror,

(*Two difficult and mutilated lines*).

\[So that\] the palsy (now striking) thine arms \[may\] depart, and the
weakness  
Pass \[from thy hands\]! \[Be brave(?)\] and resist! O my comrade,
together  
We will go down—let the combat \[in no wise diminish(?)\] thy courage!  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>O forget death, and be fearful(?) of
nothing(?) . . (for he who is) \[valiant(?)\],  
Cautious (and) careful, by leading \[the way\] hath his own body
guarded,  
(He ’tis) will safeguard a comrade."  
                                   A name by their \[valour(?)\] . .  
They will establish. (And now) they together arrive at the barrier(?),  
\[Still’d into silence(?)\] their speech, and they themselves (suddenly)
stopping.
