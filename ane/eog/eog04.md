### THE SECOND TABLET

#### OF THE MEETING OF GILGAMISH AND ENKIDU.

 <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_30)*Column II*.

<span class="margnote">2.</span>                          While
Gilgamish (thus) is the vision revealing  
Enkidu sitteth before the hetaera, and she \[displaying <span
id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_31) her\] bosom,  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Shewing \[her beauty (?)\], the place of
his birth he <span id="fr_36"></span>[3](#fn_32) forgetteth.  
                                         (So) Enkidu dallied  
(Thus) for six days, seven nights, with the courtesan-girl in his
mating.  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Broke into \[speech\] then, the nymph,
and (thus) unto Enkidu spake she:  
"(Yea, as) I view thee, (e’en) like a god, O Enkidu, shalt be,  
Why with the beasts (of the field) dost thou (ever) range over the
desert?  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Up, for I'll lead thee to \[Erech\]
broad-marketed, (aye), to the Temple  
Sacred, the dwelling of Anu—O Enkidu, come, that I guide thee,  
Unto E-Anna, the dwelling of Anu, where \[Gilgamish\] (liveth),  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>(He), the supreme of creation; and
thou, aye, thou wilt \[embrace him\]  
Like \[to a woman\], (and e’en) \[as\] thyself thou shalt \[love
him\].  
                                         O, rouse thee  
Up from the ground—’tis a shepherd's bed <span
id="fr_37"></span>[4](#fn_33) (only)."  
                                         Her utterance heard he,  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>Welcomed her rede: the advice of the
woman struck home in his bosom.  
She one garment took off wherewith she might clothe him: the other <span
id="fr_38"></span>[5](#fn_34)  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>She herself wore, (and so) taking her
hand like a brother <span id="fr_39"></span>[6](#fn_35) she led him  
(Thus) to the booths(?) of the shepherds, the place of the sheepfolds.
The shepherds  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>Gather\]d at sight of him <span
id="fr_40"></span>[7](#fn_36)

(*Gap of four or five lines*.)

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

*Column III*.

(*How the Hetaera schooled Enkidu*).

He (in the past) of the milk of the wild things to suck was
accustom’d!  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Bread which she set before him he broke,
but he gazed and he stared:  
Enkidu bread did not know how to eat, nor had he the knowledge  
Mead how to quaff!  
10.                    (Then) the woman made answer, to Enkidu
speaking,  
"Enkidu, taste of the bread, (for) of life ’tis; (forsooth), the
essential,  
Drink thou, (too), of the mead, ’tis the wonted use of the country."  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Enkidu ate of the bread, (aye, ate)
until he was gorged,  
Drank of the mead seven bumpers; his spirits rose, (and), exultant,  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>Glad was his heart, and cheerful his
face: \[himself(?)\] was he rubbing,  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>Oil on the hair of his body anointed:
and (thus) became human.  
Donn’d he a garment to be like a man <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_37), (and) taking his weapon,  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>Hunted the lions, which harried the
shepherds o’ nights: and the jackals  
Caught he. (So) he, having mastered the lions, the shepherds slept
soundly <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_38).  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>Enkidu—(he) was their warden—(becometh)
a man of full vigour.  
(Now) is one of the heroes speaking to \[Gilgamish(?)\] . . . .

(*About thirteen lines are missing, a gap in which a sinister figure has
evidently appeared, sent evidently by Gilgamish to learn the meaning of
the arrival of the strangers in Erech. Enkidu sees him and speaks*).

*Column IV*.

<span class="margnote">10.</span>(Then while) he pleasured, he lifted
his eyes, (and), observing the fellow,  
Spake he unto the woman: "O doxy, bring me (this) fellow,  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Why hath he come? I would know his
intention."  
                                        The woman the fellow  
Call’d that he come to him, that he might see him: "O, why art thou
seeking,  
Sir? (Pray), which is the way to thy rest-house?"  
<span
class="margnote">20.</span>                                        The
man spake, addressing  
Enkidu: "You to the House of Community <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_39) \[Gilgamish calleth\],  
(This is) the custom of men, and a homage (too) to the great ones:

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="margnote">25.</span>Come, then, and heap up the offerings
such as are due to the city,  
Come, on behalf of the common weal bring in the food of the city.  
(’Tis) for the king of broad-marketed Erech to look on thy greeting,  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>Gilgamish, king of broad-marketed Erech
to look on thy greeting;  
First doth he mate with the woman allotted by fate, and then after  
Speak by the counsel of god, and so from the shape of the omens <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_40)  
(Utter the rede of) his destiny."  
                                        (So) at the words of the
fellow  
Went they before him.

(*Gap of about nine lines*).

*Column V*.

(*The Entry of Enkidu into Erech*).

<span class="margnote">7.</span>\[Enkidu\] going \[in front\], with the
courtesan coming behind him,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Enter’d broad-marketed Erech; the
populace gather’d behind him,  
(Then), as he stopp’d in the street of broad-marketed Erech, the
people  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Thronging, behind him exclaim’d "Of a
truth, like to Gilgamish is he,  
Shorter in stature a trifle, \[his\] composition is stronger.  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>. . . . . . . \[(once)\] like a
\[weakling\] baby he *suck’d* the milk of the wild things!  
Ever the bread-cakes in Erech give glorious (climax) to manhood!  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>He a (mere) savage becometh a hero of
proper appearance,  
(Now) unto Gilgamish, god-like, his composition is equal."

(*How Enkidu fought with Gilgamish for the Hetaera*).

<span class="margnote">30.</span>Strewn is the couch for the
love-rites, <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_41) and Gilgamish (now) in
the night-time  
Cometh to sleep, to delight in the woman <span
id="fr_46"></span>[3](#fn_42): (but) \[Enkidu\], coming  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>(There) in the highway, doth block up
the passage to Gilgamish, \[threat’ning\]  
He with his strength . . . . .

(*Gap of seven or eight lines*).

*Column VI*.

<span class="margnote">6.</span>Gilgamish . . . behind him . . . . . . .
. . .  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Burgeon’d \[his rage\], (and) he rush’d
to \[attack\] him: they met in the highway.  
Enkidu barr’d up the door with his foot, (and) to Gilgamish entry—

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="margnote">15.</span>Would not concede: they grappled and
snorted(?) like bulls, (and) the threshold  
Shatter’d: the (very) wall quiver’d as Gilgamish <span
id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_43), Enkidu grappled,  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>Snorting(?) like bulls, (and) the
threshold they shatter’d, the (very) wall quiver'd.

(*The Birth of Friendship*).

<span class="margnote">25.</span>Gilgamish bent his leg to the ground:
(so) his fury abated,  
(Aye, and) his ardour <span id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_44) was quell’d:
so soon as was quelled his ardour,  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>Enkidu (thus) unto Gilgamish spake:
"(Of a truth), did thy mother  
Bear thee as one, and one only: (that choicest) cow of the
steer-folds,  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>Nin-sun <span
id="fr_49"></span>[3](#fn_45) exalted thy head above heroes, and Enlil
hath dower'd  
Thee with the kingship o’er men."
