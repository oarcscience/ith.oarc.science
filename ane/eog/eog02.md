### ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.

P. 5 (Preface), *l*. 13, after "metre" add "except the twelfth which
contains about half that number."

—, *l*. 15, read "name."

—, *l*. 36, and pp. 43—49, Siduri should perhaps be better described as

P. 22, *l*. 5, add "(forsooth)," after the dash.

—, *l*. 21, read "friend."
