### THE SIXTH TABLET.

#### OF THE GODDESS ISHTAR, WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH THE HERO AFTER HIS EXPLOIT AGAINST HUMBABA.

*Column I*.

(*Gilgamish is removing the stains of combat*).

 <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_72)(Now.md) is <span
id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_73) he washing his stains, (and.md) is cleansing
his garments in tatters,  
Braiding (?) (the locks of) his hair (to descend loose) over his
shoulders,  
Laying aside his garments besmirchen, (and) donning his clean ones,  
Putting on armlets (?), and girding his body about with a baldric,  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Gilgamish bindeth his fillet, and
girdeth himself with a baldric.

(*Ishtar sees him and seeks to wed him*).

(Now) Lady Ishtar espieth the beauty of Gilgamish: (saith she),  
"Gilgamish, come, be a bridegroom, to me of the fruit (of thy body)  
Grant me largesse: (for) my husband shalt be and I'll be thy consort.  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>O, but I'll furnish a chariot for thee,
(all) azure and golden,  
Golden its wheel, and its yoke precious stones <span
id="fr_80"></span>[3](#fn_74.md), each day to be harness'd  
Unto great mules: (O), enter our house with the fragrance of cedar.  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>(So) when thou enterest into our house
shall threshold and dais  
Kiss thy feet, (and) beneath thee do homage kings, princes, and
rulers,  
Bringing thee yield of the mountains and plains as a tribute: thy
she-goats  
Bring forth in plenty, thy ewes shall bear twins, thy asses <span
id="fr_81"></span>[4](#fn_75.md) attaining  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>(Each) to the size of a mule, (and) thy
steeds <span id="fr_82"></span>[4](#fn_75.md) in thy chariot winning  
Fame for their gallop: \[thy mules <span id="fr_83"></span>[4](#fn_75.md)\]
in the yoke shall ne’er have a rival."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Gilgamish\] open’d his mouth in reply, Lady Ishtar \[to answer\]:  
"Aye, but what must I give\] thee, (if (?)) I should take thee in
marriage?  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>\[I must provide thee with oil\] for
(thy) body, and clothing: (aye, also)  
\[Give thee (thy)\] bread and (thy) victual: (sooth), must be sustenance
\[ample\]  
Meet for divinity—\[I, (too), must give thee (thy) drink\] fit for
royalty.  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>. . . . I shall be bound, . . . let us
amass (?), . . . clothe with a garment.  
\[What, then, will be my advantage, supposing) I take thee in
marriage?  
\[Thou’rt but a ruin which giveth no shelter (?) to man\] from the
weather,  
Thou’rt but a back door \[not\] giving resistance to blast or to
windstorm,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="margnote">35.</span>Thou’rt but a palace which dasheth the
heroes \[within it to pieces\],  
Thou’rt but a pitfall (which letteth) its covering \[give way (all
treach’rous)\],  
Thou art but pitch which \[defileth\] the man who doth carry it with
him,  
Thou’rt but a bottle which \[leaketh\] on him who doth carry it with
him,  
Thou art but limestone which \[letteth\] stone ramparts \[fall crumbling
in ruin\].  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>Thou’rt but chalcedony \[failing to
guard (?)\] <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) in an enemy's country,  
Thou’rt but a sandal which causeth its owner \[to trip (by the
wayside)\].  
Who was ever \[thy\] husband \[thou faithfully lovedst\] for all time?  
Who hath been ever thy lord who hath gain’d \[over thee the advantage?  
Come, and I will unfold thee \[the endless tale\] of thy husbands.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span class="margnote">45.</span>(Sooth), thou shalt vouch (?) for the
truth (?) of (this) list—Thy maidenhood's consort,  
Tammuz, each year dost make him the cause of Wailing <span
id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_77.md), (then cometh  
Next) the bird Roller <span id="fr_86"></span>[3](#fn_78.md) gay-feather’d
thou lovedst, and (yet) thou didst smite him  
<span class="margnote">50.</span>Breaking his wing: in the grove doth he
stand, crying *kappi* 'my wing!'  
Lovedst thou also a Lion, in (all) the full strength of (his) vigour,  
(Yet) thou didst dig for him seven and seven (deep) pits (to entrap
him).  
Lovedst thou also a Stallion, magnificent he in the battle,  
Thou wert the cause of a bridle, a spur, and a whip to him: (also)  
<span class="margnote">55.</span>Thou wert the cause of his fifty miles
galloping; thou wert the cause, too,  
(Eke), of exhaustion and sweating (?); (thereafter), ’twas thou who
didst (also)  
Unto his mother Silili give cause for (her deep) lamentation.  
Lovedst thou also a Shepherd, a neatherd, for thee without ceasing  
<span class="margnote">60.</span>Each day to sacrifice yeanlings for
thee would heap thee his charcoal,  
(Yet) thou didst smite him, transforming him into a jackal: his herd
boy  
Yea, his own herd boy drove him away, and his dogs tore his buttocks.  
Lovedst thou, too, Ishullanu, the gardener he of thy sire,  
<span class="margnote">65.</span>Bringing delights (?) to thee
ceaseless, while daily he garnish’d thy platter;  
’Twas for thee only to cast thine eyes on him, and with him be
smitten <span id="fr_87"></span>[4](#fn_79.md).  
'O Ishullanu of mine, come, let me taste of thy vigour,  
Put forth thy hand, too, . . . . . . . . . .  <span
id="fr_88"></span>[5](#fn_80.md)'

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="margnote">70.</span>                                 But
he, Ishullanu,  
Said to thee 'What dost thou ask me? Save only my mother hath baked
(it),  
Nought have I eaten—(and) what I should eat would be bread of
transgression,  
(Aye) and iniquity! (Further), the reeds are a cloak against
winter. <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_81.md)'  
<span class="margnote">75.</span>Thou this \[his answer\] didst hear,
didst smite him and make him a spider(?) <span
id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_82.md),  
Making him lodge midway up a \[dwelling(?)\] <span
id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_83.md)—not to move upwards  
Lest there be drainage <span id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_84.md); nor down,
lest a crushing \[o’erwhelm him\].  
     So, too, me in my turn thou wouldst love and (then) \[reckon\] me
like them."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span class="margnote">80.</span>\[Heard\] this (then) Ishtar: she <span
id="fr_93"></span>[5](#fn_85.md) burst into rage and \[went up\] to
Heaven,  
Hied her (thus) Ishtar to Anu, \[her father\], to Antu, her mother,  
<span class="margnote">85.</span>Came she \[to tell (them)\]: "O father,
doth Gilgamish load me with insult,  
Gilgamish tale of my sins, my sins and iniquities telleth."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Anu made answer, (thus) speaking, and said unto Ishtar the Lady:  
"Nay, thou didst ask him \[to grant thee largesse of the fruit of his
body\],  
<span class="margnote">90.</span>(Hence) he <span
id="fr_94"></span>[6](#fn_86.md) the tale of thy sins, thy sins and
iniquities telleth."

(*The Creation of the Divine Bull which is to destroy the heroes*).

Ishtar made answer (thus) speaking, and said unto \[Anu, her father\]:  
"Father, O make (me) a Heavenly Bull, which shall Gilgamish
\[vanquish\],  
<span class="margnote">95.</span>Filling \[its body\] with flame . . .
.  
But if thou’lt \[not\] make \[this Bull\], then . . . .  
I'll smite . . . ., I'll put . . . ., I'll . . . .  
<span class="margnote">100.</span>More than the . . . will be the . . .
. . . .  <span id="fr_95"></span>[7](#fn_87.md)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Anu \[made answer, (thus) speaking, and said unto\] Ishtar, the Lady:  
"\[If I the Heavenly Bull shall create, for which\] thou dost ask me,  
(Then) seven years of (leer) husks \[must needs follow after his
onslaught (?)\].  
<span class="margnote">105.</span>Wilt thou \[for man\] gather \[corn
(?)\], and increase \[for the cattle(?)\] the fodder (?)."

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

\[Ishtar made answer, (thus) speaking \[and said unto\] Anu, her
father:  
"\[Corn for mankind\] have I hoarded, have grown \[for the cattle the
fodder\],  
<span class="margnote">110.</span>\[If seven\] years of (leer) husks
\[must needs follow after his onslaught (?)\]  
\[I will for man\] gather \[corn and increase for the cattle\] the
fodder."

(*Perhaps a small gap*.)

(*About seven lines are so badly mutilated that little can be gleaned
from them except that the fight with the Heavenly Bull is about to take
place in Erech. After these* \[*a hundred men*\] *descend* \[*upon the
Bull*\]*, but with his (fiery) breath* \[*he annihilates them*\]*. Then
come two hundred with the same result, and then three hundred more,
again to be overcome*).

<span class="margnote">130.</span>Enkidu girded (?) his middle; (and
straightway) Enkidu, leaping,  
Seized on the Heavenly Bull by \[his\] horns, and (headlong) before
him  
Cast down the Heavenly Bull his full length, . . . .  
(Aye), by the thick of his tail.

(*Gap of thirteen mutilated lines*.)

<span class="margnote">147.</span>Chased him did Enkidu, . . . the
Heavenly Bull . . .  
Seized him and by \[the thick\] of his tail . . . .

(*Gap of about fourteen mutilated lines in which the Bull is slain*.)

<span class="margnote">153.</span>(So), what time they the Bull of the
Heavens had kill’d, its heart they removéd,  
Unto the Sun-god they offer’d in sacrifice; when the libation  
<span class="margnote">155.</span>Unto the Sun they had voided, they
sate them down, the two brothers.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(*The Frenzy of Ishtar*).

(Then) mounted Ishtar (the crest of) the ramparts of Erech, the
high-wall’d,  
(So) to the roof-top ascended, (and there) gave voice to her wailing;  
<span class="margnote">160.</span>"Woe unto Gilgamish—he who by killing
the Bull of the Heavens,  
Made me lament." When Enkidu heard this, the shrieking of Ishtar,  
Wrenching the member from out of the Bull, he toss’d (it) before her;  
<span class="margnote">165.</span>"If I could only have reach’d thee,
i’faith, I’d ha’ served thee the same way,  
I’d ha’ let dangle his guts on thy flanks (as a girdle about thee)."  
Ishtar assembled the girl-devotees, the hetaerae and harlots,  
Over the member (torn out) from the Bull she led the lamenting.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

(*The Triumph of Gilgamish*).

<span class="margnote">170.</span>Gilgamish call’d to the masters of
craft, the artists, (yea), all of them,  
That at the size of its horns (all) the guilds of the crafts speak their
praises  
Each had of azure in weight thirty minas to be as their setting,  
Two fingers their . ... ... . . . . . . . . . . .  
<span class="margnote">175.</span>Both of them held six measures of oil;
to his god Lugal-banda  
He for (his) unguent devoting, brought in, and (thus) let them hang
(there),  
(There) in the shrine of his forbears.  
                                       (And now) in the River
Euphrates  
Washing their hands, they start (on their progress) and come (to the
city);  
(Now) are they striding the highway of Erech, the heroes of Erech  
<span class="margnote">180.</span>Thronging (about them) to see them.
(Then) Gilgamish utter’d a riddle  
Unto the notables (?):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Who, pr’ythee, is most splendid of heroes*,  
*Who, pr’ythee, is most famous of giants?*  
*Gilgamish—he is most splendid of heroes*,  
<span class="margnote">185.</span>\[*Enkidu—he is most*\] *famous of
giants*.

</div>

(*Three mutilated lines follow*.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span class="margnote">190.</span>So in his palace did Gilgamish hold
high revel: (thereafter),  
(While all) the heroes asleep, on their nightly couches were lying  
Enkidu, too, was asleep, and a vision beheld, and (so) coming  
Enkidu (now) his dream to reveal: (thus) spake he unto his comrade.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[32:1](eog08.htm#fr_78.md) Assyrian Version.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[32:2](eog08.htm#fr_79.md) The tense here is
properly past, but the historic present will serve.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[32:3](eog08.htm#fr_80.md) *Elmeshu*, an uncertain
kind of gem.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[32:4](eog08.htm#fr_83.md) Singular in the text. A
fragment of a Semitic tablet from Boghaz Keui (*Keils. Boghazk*, IV. 12,
p. 12) includes among her gifts "great horses" and "crystal for thy
feet."

<span id="fn_76"></span>[33:1](eog08.htm#fr_84.md) a seal-cylinder or
amulet of chalcedony.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[33:2](eog08.htm#fr_85.md) The Annual festival of
the Wailing for Tammuz. Tammuz, the husband of Ishtar, representing
vegetation, dies each year in the Autumn, and his faithful spouse goes
down to the Underworld to bring him back with the return of Spring.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[33:3](eog08.htm#fr_86.md) The Roller, a brightly
coloured bird which lives in the palm groves of Southern Babylonia,
uttering a hoarse cry which may be identified with *kappi*. During the
breeding season it has a curious irregular flight which probably gave
rise to the legend of the broken wing.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[33:4](eog08.htm#fr_87.md) The force of the tense
of the last verb appears to demand this form of translation.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[33:5](eog08.htm#fr_88.md) This, the invitation of
Ishtar, (two words) is omitted.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[34:1](eog08.htm#fr_89.md) The reply of Ishullanu
is difficult. when the goddess falls in love with him, he refuses,
saying in contempt that his mother's baking is enough for him, and, as
for the cold, the reeds provide him with ample covering.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[34:2](eog08.htm#fr_90.md) *Dallalu*, an unknown
word, perhaps *lit*. "the spinner," from a cognate Syriac root *dall*.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[34:3](eog08.htm#fr_91.md) Only half the word left
which might be restored "dwelling."

<span id="fn_84"></span>[34:4](eog08.htm#fr_92.md) From the roof.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[34:5](eog08.htm#fr_93.md) Text "Ishtar."

<span id="fn_86"></span>[34:6](eog08.htm#fr_94.md) Text "Gilgamish."

<span id="fn_87"></span>[34:7](eog08.htm#fr_95.md) It is usual to restore
this passage from the Legend of the descent of Ishtar to Hades where
she, outside the door, threatens to break it down and release the
ghosts, who shall then be more numerous than the living. The incident of
the creation of the Bull is found on a Semitic fragment from Boghaz Keui
(*Keils. Boghazk*. iv. 12, *p*. 12): the Bull is to be a young steer of
six months, but there is little else that is new. This is the other part
of the tablet quoted in the note to the Sixth Tablet, *l*. 20.
