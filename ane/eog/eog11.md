### THE NINTH TABLET.

#### GILGAMISH IN TERROR OF DEATH SEEKS ETERNAL LIFE.

*Column I*.

(*Gilgamish determines to seek Eternal Life*).

 <span id="fr_113"></span>[6](#fn_104)Gilgamish bitterly wept for his
comrade, (for) Enkidu, ranging  
Over the desert: "I, too—shall I not die like Enkidu also?  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Sorrow hath enter’d my heart; I fear
death as I range o’er the desert,  
I will get hence on the road to the presence of Uta-Napishtim <span
id="fr_114"></span>[7](#fn_105),

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

—Offspring of Ubara-Tutu is he—and with speed will I travel.  
(If) ’tis in darkness that I shall arrive at the Gates of the
Mountains,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Meeting with lions, then terror fall on
me, I'll lift my head (skywards),  
Offer my prayer to the Moon-god, (or else) to . . the gods let my
orison  
Come . . . 'O deliver me!'" . . . He slept . . . (and) a dream . . .  
\[Saw he\] . . . which were rejoicing in life,  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Poised he \[his\] axe . . . in his
hand, (and) drew \[his glaive from\] his baldric,  
Lance-like leapt he amongst them . . . smiting, . . . (and) crushing.

(*The rest of the Column is mutilated*).

*Column II*.

(*The hero reaches the Mountains of Mashu*).

Mashu the name of the hills; as he reach’d the Mountains of Mashu,  
Where ev’ry day they keep watch o’er \[the Sun-god's\] rising \[and
setting\],  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Unto the Zenith of Heaven \[uprear’d
are\] their summits, (and) downwards  
(Deep) unto Hell reach their breasts: (and there) at their portals stand
sentry  
Scorpion-men, awful in <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_106) terror,
their (very) glance Death: (and) tremendous,  
Shaking the hills, their magnificence; they are the Wardens of
Shamash,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Both at his <span
id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_107) rising and setting. (No sooner) did
Gilgamish see them"  
(Than) from alarm and dismay was his countenance stricken with pallor,  
Senseless, he grovell’d before them.  
                                        (Then) unto his wife spake the
Scorpion:  
"Lo, he that cometh to us—’tis the flesh of the gods is his body."  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>(Then) to the Scorpion-man answer\]d
his wife: "Two parts of him god-(like),  
(Only) a third of him human."

(*Eight broken lines remain, in which the Scorpion-man addresses
presumably Gilgamish, asking him* \[*why he has goner a far journey, and
telling him how hard the traverse is. Column III begins with the third
line in which Gilgamish is evidently telling the Scorpion-man that he
proposes to cask*(*?*)\] *Uta-Napishtim about death and life. But the
Scorpion-man says that* \[*the journey has never before been made, that
none* \[*has crossed*\] *the mountains. The traverse is by the Road of
the Sun by a journey of twenty-four hours, beginning with deep darkness.
The last half of this Column and the first half of Column IV are lost,
but it would appear that the Scorpion-man describes the journey hour by
hour, and that Gilgamish accepts the trial of his strength "*\[*even
though it be*\] *in pain . .,* \[*though my face be weather*\]*d*\]
*with cold* \[*and heat*\]

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (*and*) *in grief*
\[*I go*\] *. . ." Then the Scorpion-man, with a final word about the
mountains of Mashu, farewells him, wishing him success. "*\[(*Then*)
*when*\] *Gilgamish* \[*heard this*\]*,* \[*he set off*\] *at the word
of the Scorpion-man, taking*\] *the Road of the Sun . . ." The first two
hours are in deep darkness, without light,  which did not allow* \[*him
to see . . . behind him*\] *. . ." Each succeeding period of two hours
is the same until the eighth is reached and passed, and by the ninth he
apparently comes to the first glimmer of light. Finally, with the
twelfth double hour, he reaches the full blaze of the sun, and there he
beholds the Tree of the Gods, the description of which is given in the
only four complete lines,* 48-51*, of Column V. It is conceivable that
this is the Vine, the Tree of Life, whence Siduri, the Maker of Wine,
plucks the fruit for her trade*).

Bearing its fruit (all) ruby, and hung about with (its) tendrils.  
<span class="margnote">50.</span>Fair for beholding, and azure the
boskage it bore; (aye), ’twas bearing  
Fruits (all) desirable unto the eye.

(*Column VI in the Assyrian is nearly all lost, and it is uncertain what
part the Tree plays: but at this point a third Old Babylonian tablet
helps us out. At this point, according to this early version the Sun-god
takes pity on the hero*).

"\[He of the wild things hath dresséd\] their pelts and the flesh of
them eateth.  
Gilgamish, \[never\] a crossing \[shall be (?)\] where none hath been
ever,  
(No), \[so long\] as the gale driveth water."  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Shamash was touch’d, that he summon’d
him, (thus) unto Gilgamish speaking:  
"Gilgamish, why dost thou run, (forasmuch as) the life which thou
seekest  
Thou shalt not find?" (Whereat) Gilgamish answer’d the warrior
Shamash:  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>"Shall I, after I roam up and down o’er
the waste as a wand’rer,  
Lay my head in the bowels of earth, and throughout the years slumber  
Ever and aye? Let mine eyes see the Sun and be sated with brightness,  
(Yea, for) the darkness is (banish’d) afar, if wide be the brightness.  
When will the man who is dead (ever) look on the light of the Sunshine?"

(*With this ends all our connected text of Column VI, the Assyrian
Version ending with about a dozen mutilated lines containing a mention
of numerous minerals and stones, and evidently Gilgamish has now come to
the girl Siduri the sabitu, which last word is generally taken to mean a
provider of strong waters*).
