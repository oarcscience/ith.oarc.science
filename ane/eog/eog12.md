### THE TENTH TABLET.

#### HOW GILGAMISH REACHED UTA-NAPISHTIM.

*Column I*.

(*Gilgamish meets Siduri*).

 <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_108)Dwelt Siduri, the maker of wine .
. . .  
Wine(?) was her trade, her trade was . . . . . . . . .  
Cover’d she was with a veil and . . . . . . . . .  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Gilgamish wander’d \[towards her\] . . .
. . . . . .  
Pelts was he wearing . . . . . . . . .  
Flesh of the gods in \[his body\] possessing, but woe in \[his
belly\],  
(Aye), and his countenance like to a (man) who hath gone a far
journey.  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Look’d in the distance the maker of
wine, (and) a word in her bosom  
Quoth she, in thought with herself: "This is one who would ravish (?)
\[a woman\],  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Whither doth he advance in . . . ?" As
soon as the Wine-maker saw him,  
Barr’d she \[her postern\], barr’d she her inner door, barr’d she \[her
chamber(?)\].  
Straightway did Gilgamish, too, in his turn catch the sound \[of her
shutting(?)\],  
Lifted his chin, and so did he let \[his attention fall on her\].

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Unto her (therefore) did Gilgamish speak, to the Wine-maker saying\]:  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>"Wine-maker, what didst thou see, that
\[thy postern (now)\] thou hast barréd,  
Barréd thine inner door, \[-barréd thy chamber(?)\]? O, I'll smite
\[thy\] portal,  
\[Breaking the bolt\] . . . . . . . . . . .

(*About nine lines mutilated, after which it is possible to restore l*.
32—*Column II*, 8).

\[Unto him (answer 'd) the Wine-maker, speaking to Gilgamish,
(saying):  
"Why is thy vigour (so) wasted, (or why) is thy countenance <span
id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_109) sunken,  
(Why) hath thy spirit a sorrow (?), (or why) hath thy cheerfulness
surcease?  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>(O, but) there's woe in thy belly! Like
one who hath gone a far journey  
(So) is thy <span id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_109) face—(O,) with cold
and with heat is thy countenance weather’d,  
. . . that thou shouldst range over the desert."  
Gilgamish unto her (answer’d and) spake to the Wine-maker, saying:  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>"Wine-maker, ’tis not my vigour is
wasted, nor countenance sunken,  
Nor hath my spirit a sorrow (?), (forsooth), nor my cheerfulness
surcease,

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

No, ’tis not woe in my belly: nor doth my visage resemble  
One who hath gone a far journey—nor is my countenance weather'd  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>Either by cold or by heat . . . that
(thus) I range over the desert.  
Comrade (and) henchman, who chased the wild ass, the pard of the
desert,  
Comrade (and) henchman, who chased the wild ass, the pard of the
desert,  
Enkidu—we who all haps overcame, ascending the mountains,  
<span class="margnote">50.</span>Captured the Heavenly Bull, and
destroy’d him\]: we \[o’erthrew Humbaba,  
He who abode in the Forest of Cedars; we slaughter’d the lions

*Column II*.

There in the Gates (?) of the mountains (?); with me enduring all
hardships,  
Enkidu, (he was) my comrade—the lions we slaughter’d (together),  
(Aye), enduring all hardships—and him <span
id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_110) his fate hath o’ertaken.  
(So) did I mourn him six days, (yea), a <span
id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_110) se’nnight, until unto burial  
I could consign (?) him . . . . (then) did I fear . . . . .  
Death did I dread, that I range o’er the desert\]: the hap of my
comrade  
\[Lay on me heavy(?)—O ’tis a long road that I range o’er\] the
desert!  
Enkidu, (yea), \[of my comrade the hap lay heavy (?) upon me\]—  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>\[’Tis a long road\] that I range o’er
the desert—O, how to be silent\],  
(Aye, or) how to give voice? \[(For) the comrade I ha’ (so) lovéd\]  
Like to the dust \[hath become\]; O Enkidu, (he was) my comrade,  
He whom I loved hath become alike the dust\]—\[I,\] shall I not, also,  
Lay me down \[like him\], throughout all eternity \[never returning\]?"

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(*Here may be interpolated, for convenience, the Old Babylonian Version
of this episode in the Berlin tablet of* 2000 *B.C. Column II,*
1*,-III,* 14):

*Column II*.

"He who enduréd all hardships with me, whom I lovéd dearly,  
Enkidu,—he who enduréd all hardships with me (is now perish’d),  
Gone to the common lot of mankind! (And) I have bewail’d him  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Day and night long: (and) unto the tomb
I have not consign’d him.  
(O but) my friend cometh not (?) to my call—six days, (yea), <span
id="fr_122"></span>[2](#fn_111) a se’nnight  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>He like a worm hath lain on his
face—(and) I for this reason <span id="fr_123"></span>[3](#fn_112)  
Find no life, (but must needs) roam the desert like to a hunter,  
(Wherefore), O Wine-maker, now that (at last) I look on thy visage,  
Death which I dread I will see not!"

(*The Philosophy of the Wine-maker*).

                                        The Wine-maker Gilgamish
answer’d:

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

*Column III*.

"Gilgamish, why runnest thou, (inasmuch as) the life which thou
seekest,  
Thou canst not find? (For) the gods, in their (first) creation of
mortals,  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Death allotted to man, (but) life they
retain’d in their keeping.  
Gilgamish, full be thy belly,  
Each day and night be thou merry, (and) daily keep holiday revel,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Each day and night do thou dance and
rejoice; (and) fresh be thy raiment,  
(Aye), let thy head be clean washen, (and) bathe thyself in the water,  
Cherish the little one holding thy hand; be thy spouse in thy bosom  
Happy—(for) this is the dower \[of man\] . . . . .

(*Here the Old Babylonian Version breaks off and we must return to the
Assyrian*).

(*Gilgamish, dissatisfied with a Wine-maker's philosophy, would seek
further afield*).

<span class="margnote">15.</span>\[Gilgamish\] (thus) continued his
speech to the Wine-maker, (saying),  
"\[Pr’ythee, then\], Wine-maker, which is the way unto Uta-Napishtim?  
\[What (is)\] its token, I pr’ythee, vouchsafe me, vouchsafe me its
token.  
If it be possible (even) the Ocean (itself) will I traverse,  
(But) if it should be impossible, (then) will I range o’er the desert."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(*The Wine-maker, in accordance with tradition, attempts to dissuade
him*).

<span class="margnote">20.</span>(Thus) did the Wine-maker answer to
him, unto Gilgamish (saying),  
"There hath been never a crossing, O Gilgamish: never aforetime  
Anyone, coming thus far, hath been able to traverse the Ocean:  
Warrior Shamash doth cross it <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_113),
’tis true, but who besides Shamash  
Maketh the traverse? (Yea), rough is the ferry, (and) rougher its
passage,  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>(Aye), too, ’tis deep are the Waters of
Death, which bar its approaches <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_114).  
Gilgamish, if perchance thou succeed in traversing the Ocean,  
What wilt thou do, when unto the Waters of Death thou arrivest?  
Gilgamish, there is Ur-Shanabi, boatman to Uta-Napishtim,  
He with whom sails (?) <span id="fr_126"></span>[3](#fn_115) are, the
*urnu* of which in the forest he plucketh,  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>(Now) let him look on thy presence,
(and) \[if it be\] possible with him  
Cross—(but) if it be not, (then) do thou retrace thy steps (homewards)."

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gilgamish, hearing
this, \[taketh\] (his) axe in his \[hand\], awhile he draweth Glaive
from his baldric (?)\].

(*The remainder of this Column in the Assyrian Version is so much
mutilated that little can be made out, but what is obviously essential
is that Gilgamish meets Ur-Shanabi, but destroys the sails* (*?*) *of
the boat for some reason. Before going on with the restoration of the
Assyrian Version, we can interpolate Column IV from the Old Babylonian
Version of the Berlin Tablet*)

(Then) did Ur-Shanabi <span id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_116) speak to him
(yea), unto Gilgamish, (saying):  
"Tell to me what is thy name, (for) I am Ur-Shanabi, (henchman),  
(Aye), of far Uta-Napishtim <span id="fr_128"></span>[2](#fn_117)." To
him <span id="fr_129"></span>[3](#fn_118) did Gilgamish answer:  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>"Gilgamish, (that) is my name, come
hither from Erech(?), E-Anni (?),  
(One) who hath traversed the Mountains, a wearisome journey of
Sunrise,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Now that I look on thy face,
Ur-Shanabi—Uta-Napishtim  
Let me see also—the Distant one!" Him did Ur-Shanabi \[answer\],  
Gilgamish: . . . . . . . . ."

(*In the Assyrian Version Ur-Shanabi presently addresses Gilgamish in
exactly the same words as Siduri, the Wine-maker, with the same
astonishment at his weather-beaten appearance*):

*Column III*.

(Thus) did Ur-Shanabi speak to him, (yea), unto Gilgamish, (saying)  
"Why is thy vigour all wasted . . ."

(*It continues thus, to be supplied for ll.* 2-31 *from Columns I,*
33*-II,* 14 *with due bracketing for the last words, and then the text
goes on*):

<span class="margnote">32.</span>Gilgamish (thus) continued his speech
to Ur-Shanabi, (saying)  
"Pr’ythee, Ur-Shanabi, which is \[the way unto Uta-Napishtim <span
id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_116)?  
What is its token, I pr’ythee, vouchsafe me, vouchsafe me nits
token\].  
If it be possible (even) the Ocean (itself) will I traverse,  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>But if it should be impossible,
\[(then) will I range o’er the desert\]."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(Thus) did Ur-Shanabi speak to him, (yea), unto Gilgamish, (saying):  
"Gilgamish, ’tis thine own hand hath hinder’d \[thy crossing the
Ocean\],  
Thou hast destroyéd the sails(?), (and) hast piercéd (?) the . . .  
(Now) destroy’d are the sails(?), and the *urnu* not . . . . .

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="margnote">40.</span>Gilgamish, take thee thy axe in \[thy\]
hand; O, descend to the forest,  
\[Fashion thee\] poles each of five gar in length; make (knops of)
bitumen,  
Sockets, (too), add (to them) <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_119):
bring \[them me\]." (Thereat), when Gilgamish \[heard this\],  
Took he the axe in his hand, (and) \[the glaive\] drew forth \[from his
baldric\],  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>Went <span
id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_120) to the forest, and poles each of five
gar in length \[did he fashion\],  
(Knops of) bitumen he made, and he added (their) sockets: and brought
them . . <span id="fr_133"></span>[3](#fn_121),  
Gilgamish (then), and Ur-Shanabi fared them forth \[in their vessel\],  
Launch’d they the boat on the billow, and they themselves \[in her
embarking\].  
After the course of a month and a half he saw on the third day  
<span class="margnote">50.</span>How that Ur-Shanabi (now) at the Waters
of Death had arrivéd.

*Column IV*.

(Thus) did Ur-Shanabi \[answer\] him, \[(yea), unto Gilgamish,
(saying)\]:  
"Gilgamish, take the . . . . away . . . . . . . . . . .  
Let not the Waters of Death touch thy hand . . . . . .  
Gilgamish, take thou a second, a third, and a fourth pole (for
thrusting),  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Gilgamish, take thou a fifth, (and) a
sixth, and a seventh (for thrusting),  
Gilgamish, take thou an eighth, (and) a ninth, and a tenth pole (for
thrusting),  
Gilgamish, take an eleventh, a twelfth pole!" He ceased <span
id="fr_134"></span>[4](#fn_122) from (his) poling,  
(Aye) with twice-sixty (thrusts); (then) ungirded his loins . . . .  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Gilgamish . . . . (?), and set up the
mast in its socket.

(*He reaches Uta-Napishtim*).

Uta-Napishtim look’d into the distance and, inwardly musing,  
<span class="margnote">15.</span>Said to himself: "(Now), why are \[the
sails(?)\] of the vessel destroyéd,  
Aye, and one who is not of my . . . (?) doth ride on the vessel?  
(This) is no mortal who cometh: nor . . . .  
I look, but (this) is no \[mortal\] . . . . . .  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>I look, but . . . . . I look but . . .
. .

(*Remainder of Column lost, but about l.* 42 *it becomes apparent that
Uta-Napishtim is asking Gilgamish in exactly the same words as Siduri,
the Wine-maker, and Ur-Shanabi "Why is thy vigour* (*all*) *wasted?" and
so on, down to Column V, l.* 22 *"*\[*I*\]*, shall I not also lay me
down like him, throughout all eternity never returning?"*):

<span class="margnote">23.</span>Gilgamish (thus) continued his speech
unto Uta-Napishtim,  
"Then \[I bethought me\], I'll get hence and see what far Uta-Napishtim

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

<span class="margnote">25.</span>Saith (on the matter) . (And so), again
(?) I came through all countries,  
Travell’d o’er difficult mountains, (aye), \[and\] all seas have I
traversed,  
Nor hath (ever) my face had its fill of gentle sleep (?): (but) with
hardship  
Have I exhausted myself, (and) my flesh have I laden with sorrow.  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>Ere I had come to the \[House(?)\] of
the Wine-Maker, spent were my garments,  
. . . Owl, bat, lion, pard, wild cat, deer, ibex, and . . . . . .  
\[Flesh\] of them (all) have I eaten, (and eke) their pelts have I
dress’d (?) \[me\]."

(*The remainder of the Column is mutilated: there is some mention of
"let them bolt her gate . . .; with pitch and bitumen . . . ." in l.*
33*, and then nothing which gives connected sense until Column VI, ll*.
26-39):

*Column VI*.

<span class="margnote">26.</span>"Shall we for ever build house(s), for
ever set signet (to contract),  
Brothers continue to share, or among \[foes (?)\] always be hatred?  
(Or) will for ever the stream (that hath risen) in spate bring a
torrent,  
*Kulilu*-bird \[to\] *Kirippu*-bird . . . . . . . . . ?  
Face which doth look on the sunlight . . . presently (?) shall not
be <span id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_123) . . .  
Sleeping and dead \[are\]r alike, from Death they mark no distinction  
Servant and master, when once thy have reach’d \[their full span
allotted\],  
Then do the Anunnaki, great gods, . . . . . .  
Mammetum, Maker of Destiny with them, doth destiny settle,  
Death, (aye), and Life they determine; of Death is the day not
revealéd."

<span id="fn_108"></span>[44:1](eog12.htm#fr_117) Assyrian Version. A
fragment from Boghazkeui (Keils. *Boghazh*. VI. 33) in a dialect
(Subara-Hurritic) mentions Siduri.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[44:2](eog12.htm#fr_119) Probable restoration.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[45:1](eog12.htm#fr_121) Probable restoration.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[45:2](eog12.htm#fr_122) Lit. "and."

<span id="fn_112"></span>[45:3](eog12.htm#fr_123) Or "on account of
him."

<span id="fn_113"></span>[46:1](eog12.htm#fr_124) Lit. "the Ocean."

<span id="fn_114"></span>[46:2](eog12.htm#fr_125) Lit. "its face," or
"its margin." The idea is perhaps that of the open sea after Gilgamish
has left the more peaceable tidal waters where the Persian Gulf and the
rivers meet in the salt lagoons.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[46:3](eog12.htm#fr_126) A word which is one of
the greatest philological problems of the Epic. Possibly "paddles." I
doubt whether it has any connection with "stones" as might be inferred
from one rendering of the word.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[47:1](eog12.htm#fr_130) Sur-Sunabu in this
Version.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[47:2](eog12.htm#fr_128) Uta-naishtim.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[47:3](eog12.htm#fr_129) Lit. "to him, to
Sur-Sunabu."

<span id="fn_119"></span>[48:1](eog12.htm#fr_131) The modern
punting-pole of S. Mesopotamia is a bamboo with a knob of bitumen at one
end, and a metal ferule or ring at the other.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[48:2](eog12.htm#fr_132) Lit. "Went down into."

<span id="fn_121"></span>[48:3](eog12.htm#fr_133) Probably supply "to
Ur-Shanabi."

<span id="fn_122"></span>[48:4](eog12.htm#fr_134) Or "he completed," or
"used up his poles." The text has "Gilgamish."

<span id="fn_123"></span>[49:1](eog12.htm#fr_135) Difficult line.
