### THE ELEVENTH TABLET.

#### THE FLOOD.

*Column I*.

(*The Cause of the Flood*).

 <span id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_124.md)Gilgamish unto him spake, to
Uta-Napishtim the Distant:  
"Uta-Napishtim, upon thee I gaze, (yet) in no wise thy presence  
Strange is, (for) thou art like me, and in no wise different art thou;  
<span class="margnote">5.</span>Thou art like me; (yea) a stomach for
fighting doth make thee consummate,  
\[Aye, and to rest (?)\] on thy back thou dost lie. \[O tell me (?)\],
how couldst thou  
Stand in th’ Assemblage of Gods to petition for life (everlasting)?"

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

Uta-Napishtim (addressing him thus) unto Gilgamish answer'd:  
"Gilgamish, I unto thee will discover the (whole) hidden story,  
<span class="margnote">10.</span>Aye, and the rede of the Gods will I
tell thee.  
                                         The City Shurippak <span
id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_125.md)—  
(O ’tis) a city thou knowest!—is set \[on the marge\] of Euphrates,  
Old is this city, with gods in its midst. (Now), the great gods a
deluge  
Purposed to bring: . . . . . . there was Anu, their sire; their
adviser  
Warrior Enlil; Ninurta <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_126.md), their
herald; their leader(?) Ennugi;  
Nin-igi-azag—’tis Ea—, (albeit) conspirator with them,  
<span class="margnote">20.</span>Unto a reed-hut their counsel betray’d
he: "O Reed-hut, O Reed-hut!  
Wall, wall! Hearken, O Reed-hut, consider, O Wall! O thou Mortal,  
Thou of Shurippak, thou scion of Ubara-Tutu, a dwelling  
<span class="margnote">25.</span>Pull down, (and) fashion a vessel
(therewith); abandon possessions,  
Life do thou seek, (and) thy hoard disregard, and save life; every
creature  
Make to embark in the vessel. The vessel, which thou art to fashion,  
<span class="margnote">30.</span>Apt be its measure; its beam and its
length be in due correspondence,  
(Then) \[on\] the deep do thou launch it." And I—sooth, I
apprehending,  
(This wise) to Ea, my lord, did I speak: '\[See\], Lord, what thou
sayest  
<span class="margnote">35.</span>Thus, do I honour, I'll do—(but) to
city, to people, and elders  
Am I, forsooth, to explain?' (Then) Ea made answer in speaking,  
Saying to me—me, his henchman!—'Thou mortal, shalt speak to them this
wise:  
"’Tis me alone (?) whom Enlil so hateth that I in your city  
<span class="margnote">40.</span>No (more) may dwell, nor turn my face
unto the land which is Enlil's.  
\[I will go\] down to the Deep, (there) dwelling with Ea, my \[liege\]
lord,  
(Wherefore) \[on\] you will he shower down plenty, yea, fowl \[in great
number(?)\],  
<span class="margnote">45.</span>Booty of fish . . . . \[and big\] the
harvest.  
. . . . . . . . causing a plentiful rainfall (?) to come down upon
you."' <span id="fr_139"></span>[3](#fn_127.md)

\[(Then) when something\] of morning had dawn’d . . . .

(*Five lines mutilated*).

<span class="margnote">55.</span>Pitch did the children <span
id="fr_140"></span>[4](#fn_128) provide, (while.md) the strong brought
\[all\] that was needful.  
(Then) on the fifth day (after) I laid out the <span
id="fr_141"></span>[5](#fn_129) shape (of my vessel.md),  
Ten *gar* each was the height of her sides, in accord with her
planning(?),  
Ten *gar* to match was the size of her deck (?), and the shape of the
forepart (?)

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<span class="margnote">60.</span>Did I lay down, (and) the same did I
fashion; (aye), six times cross-pinn’d her,  
Sevenfold did I divide her . . . ., divided her inwards  
Ninefold: hammer’d the caulking within her, (and) found me a
quant-pole,  
<span class="margnote">65.</span>(All) that was needful I added; the
hull with six <span id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_130.md) *shar* of bitumen  
Smear’d I, (and) three *shar* of pitch \[did I smear\] on the inside;
some people,  
Bearing a vessel of grease, three *shar* of it brought (me); (and) one
*shar*  
(Out of this) grease did I leave, which the tackling (?) consumed; (and)
the boatman  
<span class="margnote">70.</span>Two *shar* of grease stow’d away;
(yea), beeves for the . . . I slaughter’d,  
Each day lambs did I slay: mead, beer, oil, wine, too, the workmen  
\[Drank\] as though they were water <span
id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_131.md), and made a great feast like the New
Year,

(*Five mutilated lines "I added salve for the hand(s)," "the vessel was
finish’d . . . Shamash the great." "was difficult," " . . ? I caused to
bring above and below," "two-thirds of it"*):

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span class="margnote">80.</span>\[All I possess’d I\] laded aboard her;
the silver I laded  
All I possess'd; gold, all I possess’d I laded aboard her,  
All I possess’d of the seed of all living \[I laded aboard\] her.  
Into the ship I embark’d all my kindred and family (with me),  
<span class="margnote">85.</span>Cattle (and) beasts of the field (and)
all handicraftsmen embarking.  
(Then) decreed Shamash the hour: " . . . . (?)  
Shall in the night let a plentiful rainfall(?) pour down . . . . <span
id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_131.md)  
(Then) do thou enter the vessel, and (straightway) shut down thy
hatchway."  
<span class="margnote">90.</span> <span
id="fr_145"></span>[3](#fn_132)Came (then) that hour (appointed.md), . . .
. . . (?)  
Did in the night let a plentiful rainfall(?) pour down . . . . (?)  
View’d I the aspect of day: to look on the day bore a horror,  
(Wherefore) I enter’d the vessel, and (straightway) shut down my
hatchway,  
(So, too) to shut down the vessel to Puzur-Amurri (?), the boatman,  
<span class="margnote">95.</span>Did I deliver the poop (of the ship),
besides its equipment.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

      (Then), when something of dawn had appear’d, from out the
horizon  
Rose a cloud darkling; (lo), Adad (the storm-god) was rumbling within
it,  
<span class="margnote">100.</span>Nabu and Sharru were leading the
vanguard, and coming as heralds  
Over the hills and the levels: (then) Irragal wrench’d out the
bollards;  
Havoc Ninurta let loose as he came, th’ Anunnaki their torches  
<span class="margnote">105.</span>Brandish’d, and shrivell’d the land
with their flames; desolation from Adad  
Stretch’d to (high) Heaven, (and) all that was bright was turn’d into
darkness.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

(*Four lines mutilated "the land like . . .," "for one day the st\[orm\]
. . ., " "fiercely blew . . . . " "like a battle . . . "*).

Nor could a brother distinguish his brother[;](errata.htm#2.md) from heaven
were mortals  
Not to be spied. O, were stricken with terror the gods at the Deluge,  
Fleeing, they rose to the Heaven of Anu, and crouch’d in the
outskirts,  
<span class="margnote">115.</span>Cow 'ring like curs were the gods
(while) like to a woman in travail  
Ishtar did cry, she shrieking aloud, (e’en) the sweet-spoken Lady  
(She of the gods): 'May that day turn to dust, because I spake evil  
<span class="margnote">120.</span>(There) in th’ Assemblage of Gods! O,
how could I utter (such) evil  
(There) in the Assemblage of Gods, (so) to blot out my people,
ordaining  
Havoc! Sooth, then, am I to give birth, unto (these) mine own people  
Only to glut (with their bodies) the Sea as though they were
fish-spawn?'  
<span class="margnote">125.</span>Gods—Anunnaki—wept with her, the gods
were sitting (all) humbled,  
(Aye), in (their) weeping, (and) closed were their lips amid(?)\]the
Assemblage.  
Six days, a <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_133.md) se’nnight the
hurricane, deluge, (and) tempest continued  
Sweeping the land: when the seventh day came, were quelléd the
warfare,  
<span class="margnote">130.</span>Tempest (and) deluge which like to an
army embattail’d were fighting.  
Lull’d was the sea, (all) spent was the gale, assuaged was the deluge,  
(So) did I look on the day; (lo), sound was (all) still’d; and all
human  
Back to (its) clay was return’d, and fen was level with roof-tree.  
<span class="margnote">135.</span>(Then) I open’d a hatchway, and down
on my cheek stream’d the sunlight,  
Bowing myself, I sat weeping, my tears o’er my cheek(s) overflowing,  
Into the distance I gazed, to the furthest bounds of the Ocean,  
<span class="margnote">140.</span>Land was uprear’d at twelve (points),
and the Ark on the Mountain of Nisir  
Grounded; the Mountain of Nisir held fast, nor gave lease to her <span
id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_134.md) shifting.  
One day, (nay,) two, did Nisir hold fast, nor give lease to her
shifting.  
Three days, (nay), four, did Nisir hold fast, nor give lease to her
shifting,  
Five days, (nay,) six, did Nisir hold fast, nor give lease to her
shifting.  
<span class="margnote">145.</span>(Then), when the seventh day dawn’d, I
put forth a dove, and released (her),  
(But) to and fro went the dove, and return’d (for) a resting-place was
not.  
150 (Then) I a swallow put forth and released; to and fro went the
swallow,  
She (too) return’d, (for) a resting-place was not; I put forth a
raven,  
Her, (too,) releasing; the raven went, too, and th’ abating of waters  
Saw; and she ate as she waded (and) splash’d, (unto me) not returning.  
<span class="margnote">155.</span>Unto the four winds (of heaven) I
freed (all the beasts), and an off’ring  
Sacrificed, and a libation I pour’d on the peak of the mountain,  
Twice seven flagons devoting, (and) sweet cane, (and) cedar, and myrtle,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="margnote">160.</span>Heap’d up beneath them; the gods smelt
the savour, the gods the sweet savour  
Smelt; (aye,) the gods did assemble like flies o’er him making the
off’ring.  
Then, on arriving, the Queen (of the gods) the magnificent jewels  
Lifted on high, which Anu had made in accord with her wishes;  
'O ye Gods! I will (rather) forget (this) my necklet of sapphires,  
<span class="margnote">165.</span>Than not maintain these days in
remembrance, nor ever forget them.  
(So), though (the rest of) the gods may present themselves at the
off’ring,  
Enlil (alone of the gods) may (himself) not come to the off’ring,  
Because he, unreasoning, brought on a deluge, and therefore my people  
Unto destruction consign’d.'  
                           <span class="margnote">170.</span>Then Enlil,
on his arrival,  
Spied out the vessel, and (straightway) did Enlil burst into anger,  
Swollen with wrath ’gainst the gods, the Igigi <span
id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_135.md): 'Hath any of mortals  
’Scaped? Sooth, never a man could have lived through (the welter of)
ruin.'  
(Then) did Ninurta make answer and speak unto warrior Enlil,  
<span class="margnote">175.</span>Saying: 'O, who can there be to devise
such a plan, except Ea?  
Surely, ’tis Ea is privy to ev’ry design.' Whereat Ea  
Answer’d and spake unto Enlil, the warrior, saying: 'O chieftain  
Thou of the gods, thou warrior! How, forsooth, how (all) uncounsell’d  
<span class="margnote">150.</span>Couldst thou a deluge bring on? (Aye,)
visit his sin on the sinner  
Visit his guilt on the guilty, (but) O, have mercy, that (thereby)  
He shall not be cut off; be clement, that he may not \[perish\].  
O, instead of thy making a flood, let a lion come, man to diminish;  
O, instead of thy making a flood, let a jackal come, man to diminish;  
O, instead of thy making a flood, let a famine occur, that the country  
<span class="margnote">185.</span>May be \[devour’d(?)\]; instead of thy
making a flood, let the Plague-god  
Come and the people \[o’erwhelm\];  
     Sooth, indeed ’twas not I of the Great Gods the secret revealéd,  
(But) to th’ Abounding in Wisdom <span id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_136.md)
vouchsafed I a dream, and (in this wise)  
He of the gods heard the secret. Deliberate, now, on his counsel'.  
<span class="margnote">190.</span>(Then) to the Ark came up Enlil; my
hand did he grasp, and uplifted  
Me, even me, and my wife, too, he raised, and, bent-kneed beside me,  
Made her to kneel; our foreheads he touch’d as he stood there between
us,  
Blessing us; 'Uta-Napishtim hath hitherto only been mortal,  
Now, indeed, Uta-Napishtim and (also) his wife shall be equal  
<span class="margnote">195.</span>Like to us gods; in the distance afar
at the mouth of the rivers  
Uta-Napishtim shall dwell'. (So) they took me and (there) in the
distance

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

Caused me to dwell at the mouth of the rivers.  
                                      But thee, as for thee, pray,  
Who will assemble the gods for thy (need), that the life which thou
seekest  
Thou mayst discover? Come, fall not asleep for six days, aye, a
se’nnight!"

(*But Gilgamish is too mortal to resist even sleep*).

<span class="margnote">200.</span>(Then), while he sat on his haunches a
sleep like a breeze breathed upon him.  
Spake to her, Uta-Napishtim, yea, unto his wife: "O, behold him,  
E’en the strong fellow who asketh for life, (how) hath breathéd upon
him  
<span class="margnote">205.</span>Sleep like a breeze!" (Then) his wife
unto Uta-Napishtim the Distant  
Answer 'd: "O, touch him, and let the man wake, that the road he hath
traversed  
He may betake himself homeward in peace, that he by the portal  
Whence he fared forth may return to his land." Spake Uta-Napishtim,  
<span class="margnote">210.</span>(Yea), to his wife: "(How) the
troubles of mortals do trouble thee also!  
Bake then his flour (and) put at his head, but the time he is sleeping  
On the house-wall do thou mark it. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_137)" (So straightway) she (did so.md), his
flour  
Baked she (and) set at his head, but the time he was sleeping she
noted  
<span class="margnote">215.</span>On the house-wall. (So), *first* was
collected his flour, (then) *secondly* sifted,  
*Thirdly*, ’twas moisten’d, and *fourthly* she kneaded his dough, and so
*fifthly*  
Leaven she added, and sixthly ’twas baked; (then) *seventh*—he touch’d
him,  
All on a sudden, and (so from his slumber) awoke the (great) fellow!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Gilgamish unto him spake, (yea) to Uta-Napishtim the Distant:  
<span class="margnote">220.</span>"(Tell me), I pr’ythee (?), was 't
thou, who when sleep was shower’d upon me  
All on a sudden didst touch me, and (straightway) rouse me (from
slumber)?"  
Uta-Napishtim to Gilgamish \[spake, (yea), unto him spake he\]:  
"Gilgamish, told was the tale of thy meal . . . and (then) did I wake
thee:  
<span class="margnote">225.</span>\[*'One'*—was collected\] thy flour:
\[(then) *'two'*\]—it was sifted; (and) *'thirdly'*—  
Moisten’d: (and) *'fourthly'*—she kneaded thy dough \[(and)
*'fifthly'*\] the leaven  
Added: (and) *'sixthly'*—’twas baked: \[(and) *'seventh'*\] —’twas I on
a sudden  
Touch’d thee and thou didst awake." To Uta-Napishtim, the Distant, <span
id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_138.md)  
<span class="margnote">230.</span>Gilgamish answer'd: "O, \[how\] shall
I act, (or) where shall I hie me,  
Uta-Napishtim? A Robber <span id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_139) (from me.md)
hath ravish’d my \[courage,\]  
Death \[in\] my bed-chamber broodeth, and Death is wherever I \[listen\]
."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Spake\] to \[him, (yea),\] to the boatman Ur-Shanabi Uta-Napishtim:

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<span class="margnote">235.</span>"’Tis thou, Ur-Shanabi . . . the
crossing, will hate thee,  
(Sooth), to all those who come to its marge, doth its marge set a
limit:  
(This) man for whom thou wert guide—are stains to cover his body,  
Or shall a skin hide the grace of his limbs? Ur-Shanabi, take him,  
<span class="margnote">240.</span>Lead him to where he may bathe, that
he wash off his stains in the water  
(White) as the snow: let him cast off his pelt(s) that the sea may
remove (them);  
Fair let his body appear: of his head be the fillet renewéd,  
Let him, as clothes for his nakedness, garb himself in a mantle,  
<span class="margnote">245.</span>Such that, or ever he come to his
city, and finish his journey,  
No (sign of) age shall the mantle betray, but preserve (all) its
freshness."  
Wherefore Ur-Shanabi took him, and where he might bathe did he lead
him,  
Washing his stains in the \[water\] like snow, his pelt(s), \[too\],
discarding,  
<span class="margnote">250.</span>So that the sea might bear them away;
(and) his body appearéd  
Fair; \[of\] his head he \[the fillet\] renewed, and himself in a
mantle  
Garb’d, as the clothes for his nakedness, \[such that or ever his city  
Reach he\], or ever he finish his journey, \[the mantle betray not  
<span class="margnote">255.</span>Age, but\] preserve \[(all) its
freshness\].  
                                       (So) into their vessel embarkéd  
Gilgamish, (aye), and Ur-Shanabi, launching (their) craft \[on the
billow\],  
They themselves riding aboard (her).

(*The magic gift of restored youth*).

                                    To Uta-Napishtim, the Distant <span
id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_140.md),  
Spake (then) his wife: "Came Gilgamish (hither) aweary with rowing,  
<span class="margnote">260.</span>What wilt thou give wherewith he
return to his land?" and the meanwhile  
Gilgamish, lifting his pole, was pushing the boat at the seashore.  
(Then answer'd) Uta-Napishtim to him, (yea), \[to\] Gilgamish \[spake
he\]:  
"Gilgamish, (hither) didst come (all) aweary with rowing; (O, tell
me),  
<span class="margnote">265.</span>What shall I give thee (as gift)
wherewith to return to thy country?  
Gilgamish, I will reveal thee a hidden matter . . . I'll tell thee:  
There is a plant like a thorn with its root (?) \[deep down in the
ocean\],  
Like unto those of the briar (in sooth) its prickles will scratch
\[thee\],  
<span class="margnote">270.</span>(Yet) if thy hand reach this plant,
\[thou’lt surely find life (everlasting)\] ."  
(Then), when Gilgamish heard this, he loosen’d) <span
id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_141.md) \[his girdle about him\],  
Bound heavy stones \[on his feet\], which dragg’d him down to the
sea-deeps,  
\[Found he the plant\]; as he seized on the plant, (lo), \[its prickles
did scratch him\].

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="margnote">275.</span>Cut he the heavy stones \[from his
feet\] that again it restore him  
Unto its shore.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Gilgamish spake to him, (yea), to the boatman Ur-Shanabi (this wise):  
"(Nay, but) this plant is a plant of great wonder(?), Ur-Shanabi," said
he,  
"Whereby a man may attain his desire—I'll take it to Erech,  
<span class="margnote">280.</span>(Erech), the high-wall’d, and give it
to eat \[unto . . . .\].  
'Greybeard-who-turneth-to-man-in-his-prime' is its name and I'll eat
it  
I myself, that again I may come to my youthful condition."

(*The Quest ends in Tragedy*).

Broke they their fast at the fortieth hour: at the sixtieth rested.  
<span class="margnote">285.</span>Gilgamish spied out a pool of cool
water, (and) therein descending  
Bathed in the water. (But here was) a serpent who snuff’d the plant's
fragrance,  
Darted he up \[from the water (?)\], and snatch’d the plant, uttering
malison  
<span class="margnote">290.</span>As he drew back. Then Gilgamish sate
him, (and) burst into weeping.  
Over his cheeks flow’d his tears: to the boatman Ur -Shanabi \[spake
he(?)\]  
"(Pr’ythee), \[for\] whom have toiléd mine arms, O Ur-Shanabi, (tell
me),  
<span class="margnote">295.</span>(Pr’ythee), for whom hath my heart's
blood been spent? (yea), not for mine own self,  
Have I the guerdon achieved; (no), ’tis for an earth-lion (only)  
Have I the guerdon secured—(and) now at the fortieth hour  
(Such an) one reiveth (it)—O, when I open’d the sluice and . . .ed the
attachment, <span id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_142.md)  
(Aye), I noted the sign (?) which to me was vouchsafed as a warning,  
<span class="margnote">300.</span>Would I had turn’d and abandon’d the
boat at the marge (of the ocean)!"  
Broke they their fast at the fortieth hour: at the sixtieth rested,  
(So in the end) to the middle of Erech, the high-wall’d, arrivéd.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(*The Pride of the Architect*).

Gilgamish spake to him, (yea), to the boatman Ur-Shanabi (this wise):  
"Do thou, Ur-Shanabi, go up and walk on the ramparts of Erech,  
Look on its base, and take heed of its bricks, if its bricks be not
kiln-burnt,  
<span class="margnote">305.</span>(Aye), and its ground-work be not
bitumen, e’en seven courses,  
One *shar* the city, (and) one *shar* the gardens, and one *shar* the

<span id="fn_136"></span>[53:2](eog13.htm#fr_149.md) *Atra-hasis*, another
name for Uta-Napishtim.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[54:1](eog13.htm#fr_150.md) A difficult passage,
capable of other interpretations. But if this is the correct one,
Uta-Napishtim is mocking the "strong man" who seeks eternal life, with
the tally of the number of hours (or days?) he sleeps, unable even to
stay awake.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[54:2](eog13.htm#fr_151.md) As before "Unto him,
unto Uta-Napishtim."

<span id="fn_139"></span>[54:3](eog13.htm#fr_152.md) So as it stands, but
it is not intelligible.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[55:1](eog13.htm#fr_153) Lit. "to him, (yea.md),
to Uta-Napishtim."

<span id="fn_141"></span>[55:2](eog13.htm#fr_154.md) The word is not spelt
quite correctly, if this is right.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[56:1](eog13.htm#fr_155.md) Lit. "furniture." The
incident is lost in one of the previous gaps. Is it referable to the
"dam" in the Fifth Tablet, Column VI?

<span id="fn_143"></span>[56:2](eog13.htm#fr_156.md) Unfortunately there
are two difficult words in these two lines.
