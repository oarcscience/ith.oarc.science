<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Among</span> the Nations that came within the purview of the Old Testament Writers&#8212;nations seldom mentioned without stricture, whether for idolatry, immorality, or cruelty&#8212;perhaps none were the object of so concentrated an aversion as were the Philistines. The licentiousness of the Amorites, the hard-heartedness of the Egyptian taskmasters, the fiendish savagery of the Assyrian warriors, each of these in turn receives its due share of condemnation. But the scornful judgement passed by the Hebrews on the Philistines has made a much deeper impression on the Bible-reading West than have their fulminations against other races and communities with which they had to do. In English, from at least the time of Dekker,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the word 'Philistine' has been used in one or other of the senses of the modern colloquialism 'outsider'; and, especially since the publication of the essays of Mr. Matthew Arnold, it has become almost a technical term for a person boorish or bucolic of mind, impervious to the higher influences of art or of civilization. In French and German&#8212;probably, indeed, in most of the languages of Europe&#8212;the word is used in familiar speech with a greater or less approximation to the same meaning.</p>  
<p>The following little book is an attempt to collect in a convenient form the information so far available about the Philistine people. It is an expansion of a course of three lectures, delivered in 1911 before the British Academy under the Schweich Fund. In preparing it for publication, the matter has been revised and re-written throughout; and the division into lectures&#8212;primarily imposed by the exigencies of time-allowance&#8212;has been abandoned for a more systematic and convenient division into chapters and sections.</p>  
<p>It is hoped that the perusal of these pages will at least suggest</p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_xvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. xvi</font></A></p>  
<p>a doubt as to the justice of the colloquial use of the name of this ancient people.</p>

<p>I have to express my acknowledgements to my friends and colleagues, the Rev. P. Boylan, Maynooth, and the Rev. Prof. Henry Browne, S. J.; also to the Very Rev. Principal G. A. Smith, Aberdeen, and Mr. E. H. Alton, of Dublin University, for allowing me to consult them on various points that arose in the course of this work. The first and last named have most kindly read through proof-sheets of the work and have made many valuable suggestions, but they have no responsibility for any errors that the discerning critic may detect.</p>

Perhaps we have not the word because we have so much of the thing' (M. Arnold. 1863): and the quotation from the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, which is printed on the title-page.</P>
