### Footnotes

<span id="fn_167"></span>[117:1](stc11.htm#fr_167) For the text, see
*Cuneiform Texts*, part xiii, pl. 33 f., Rm. 282; for a previous
publication, cf. Delitzsch, *Assyrisches Wörterbuch*, p. 390 f.;
translations have been given by Zimmern in Gunkel's *Schöpfung und
Chaos*, pp. 417 ff., and by Jensen in Schrader's *Keilins. Bibl.*, vi,
pp. 44 ff. Strictly speaking, the text is not a creation legend, though
it gives a variant form of the principal incident in the history of
creation according to the version *Enuma eli<u>sh</u>*. In the tablet
Rm. 282 the fight with the dragon did not precede the creation of the
world, but took place after men had been created and cities had been
built; see further the Introduction.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[117:2](stc11.htm#fr_168) The form of the name
here used is *Tâmtu*, i.e., the Sea."

<span id="fn_169"></span>[117:3](stc11.htm#fr_169) The kaspu is the
space that can be covered in two hours travelling, i.e., about six or
seven miles. These general dimensions of the size of the dragon are in
accordance with the statement made in l. 8f. of the reverse to the
effect that after the dragon had been slain his blood flowed for more
than three years. The. second measurement in the line is taken by
Zimmern to refer to the dragon's breadth, but, as Jensen points out,
this is not consistent with the measurement of the mouth given in the
following line. Even Zimmern's readings of 60 GAR in l. 10 and 65 GAR in
l. 11 do not explain, but render still more anomalous, the ½ GAR in l.
9. Without going into the question of the probable length of the
Babylonian cubit, it is obvious that the dragon's breadth can hardly
have been given as so many miles, if its mouth only measures so many
feet. This difficulty can be got over by restoring
*<u>s</u>îrûti<u>sh</u>u* in place of the suggested *rupussu* at the end
of l. 8. We then have a consistent picture of the dragon as a long thin
snake, rearing his head on high; his coils might well have been believed
to extend for three hundred or three hundred and fifty miles, and the
raising of his head in the air to a height of six or seven miles would
not be inconsistent with the measurement of his mouth as six cubits,
i.e., some ten feet or more across.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[119:1](stc11.htm#fr_170) Lines 17-19 are the
appeal of the gods to the Moon-god; ll. 20-22 contain the address of the
Moon-god to Ti<u>shh</u>u; and ll. 23 ff. give Ti<u>shh</u>u's answer to
the Moon-god.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[119:2](stc11.htm#fr_171) Jensen,
*ri-<u>h</u>u-ut*, which he renders as "moisture." The plural,
*dal<u>h</u>ûti*, may perhaps be explained by supposing that, according
to this version also, the dragon had other creatures to help her in the
fight.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[121:1](stc11.htm#fr_172) Jensen suggests the
restoration *<sup>ilu</sup> B*\[*êl*\], which he deduces from the traces
upon the tablet as published by Delitzsch; for, as he states, the only
other restoration possible would be *<sup>ilu</sup>
I*\[*<u>sh</u>taar*\], and this is rendered unlikely by the masculine
form of the imperatives in ll. 2 and 4. This would prove that the slayer
of the dragon was Bêl, or Marduk, in both the versions of the story. As
a matter of fact, the traces are incorrectly given by Delitzsch; they
represent the sign AN and not the conflate sign AN +EN (cf. *Cun.
Txts*., pt. xiii, pl. 34), and it is not possible to conclude from the
text who is the hero of this version.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[121:2](stc11.htm#fr_173) Jensen suggests the
restoration *u* \[ . KAS-PU\], i.e., "for three years, three months, a
day and \[ . hours\]." The trace of the next character after u is the
single diagonal wedge (cf. Cun. Txts., pt. xiii, pl. 34); according to
Jensen's restoration this sign can only be the number "10," i.e. X
KAS-PU, "twenty hours," a not very probable reading. The diagonal wedge
is more probably the beginning of the sign MI, i.e. *mû<u>sh</u>u*, and
the end of the line may be restored as *umu I<sup>KAN</sup> u*
\[*mû<u>sh</u>u* *I<sup>KAN</sup>*\]; this may be rendered "one day and
one night," or possibly, as Zimmern in his translation suggests, "day
and night."

<span id="fn_174"></span>[121:3](stc11.htm#fr_174) The lower part of the
tablet is taken up with the common colophon found upon tablets from
A<u>sh</u>ur-bani-pal's palace.
