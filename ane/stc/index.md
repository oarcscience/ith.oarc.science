This is an etext of L.W. Kings' authoritative work on the Enuma Elish,
the Babylonian creation myth. This etext includes the complete
introduction, and the English text of the Enuma Elish and other related
texts, with selected footnotes. The Enuma Elish is the earliest written
creation myth, in which the God Marduk battles the chaos Goddess Tiamat
and her evil minions. The name 'Enuma Elish' is derived from the first
two words of the myth, meaning 'When in the Height'. Tiamat takes the
form of a gigantic snake, and Marduk battles and defeats her using an
arsenal of super-weapons. After his victory Marduk is made the leader of
the Gods by acclamation. Marduk divides Tiamat's corpse into two
portions, the upper half becoming the sky and the lower half, the earth.
Marduk then creates humanity from his blood and bone.

The Enuma Elish has long been considered by scholars to be primary
source material for the book of Genesis. It has also been hypothesized
that this is a legend about the overthrow of the matriarchy or records
of some cosmic catastrophe.
