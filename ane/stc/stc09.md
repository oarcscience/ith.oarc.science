# The Sixth Tablet

1\. When Marduk heard the word of the gods,

2\. His heart prompted him and he devised \[a cunning plan\].

3\. He opened his mouth and unto Ea \[he spake\],

4\. \[That which\] he had conceived in his heart he imparted \[unto
him\]:

5\. "My blood will I take and bone will I \[fashion\],

6\. "I will make man, that man may ... \[...\].

7\. "I will create man who shall inhabit \[the earth\],"

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

8\. "That the service of the gods may be established, and that \[their\]
shrines <span id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_153.md) \[may be built\].

9\. "But I will alter the ways of the gods, and I will change \[their
paths\];

10\. "Together shall they be oppressed <span
id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_154.md), and unto evil shall \[they ...\]."

11\. And Ea answered him and spake the word:

12\. "\[...\] the \[...\] of the gods I have \[changed\]

13\. \[...\] ... and one ... \[...\]

14\. \[...shall be de\]stroyed and men will I \[...\]

15\. \[...\] and the gods \[...\]

16\. \[...\] ... and they \[...\]

17\. \[...\] ... and the gods \[...\]

18\. \[...\] .... \[...\]

19\. \[...\] the gods \[...\]

20\. \[...\] the Anunnaki \[...\]

21\. \[...\] ... \[...\]

\[The rest of the text is wanting <span id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155.md)
with the exception of the last few lines of the tablet, which read as
follows.\]

138\. \[...\] ... \[...\]

139\. \[...\] ... \[...\]

140\. When \[...\] ... \[...\]

141\. They rejoiced \[...\] ... \[...\]

142\. In Up<u>sh</u>ukkinnaku they set \[their dwelling\].

143\. Of the heroic son, their avenger, \[they cried\]:

144\. "We, whom he succoured, ... \[...\]!"

145\. They seated themselves and in the assembly they named \[him ...\],

146\. They all \[cried aloud (?), they exalted \[him ...\]. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_153"></span>[89:1](stc09.htm#fr_153.md) ... literally the line
reads "Let the service of the gods be established, and as for them let
\[their\] shrines be built. It is interesting to note the reason that is
here implied for the creation of mankind, i.e., that the gods my have
worshipers. There is clearly a reference to this in l. 29 of the Seventh
Tablet, where, after referring to Marduk's mercy upon the gods, the text
goes on ... "For their forgiveness did he create mankind."

<span id="fn_154"></span>[89:2](stc09.htm#fr_154.md) It seems preferable to
assign to the Piel of \[kabâtu\] its usual meaning "to oppress," rather
than to render the passage as "Together shall they be honoured." The
sense seems to be that Marduk, by the creation of man, will establish
the worship of the gods, but at the same time will punish the gods for
their complaints. It is possible that in his speech that follows Ea
dissuades Marduk from carrying out the second part of his proposal.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[91:1](stc09.htm#fr_155.md) It is probable that
the missing portion of the text corresponded closely with the account of
the creation of man and animals given by Berossus; for a further
discussion of this subject, see the Introduction. The tablet K. 3,364
(*Cun. Texts*, part xiii, pl. 24 f.) has been thought to belong to the
Creation Series, and to contain the instructions given by Marduk to man
after his creation. Had this been so, it would have formed part of the
Sixth Tablet. On plates lxiv ff. of Vol. II is published the text of a
Neo-Babylonian tablet, No. 33,851, which gives a duplicate text to K.
3,364; and in Appendix II I have given reasons for believing that the
text inscribed upon K. 3,364 and No. 33,851 has no connection with the
Creation Series, but is part of a long composition containing moral
precepts. Another fragment which it has been suggested belongs to one of
the later tablets of the Creation Series is K. 3,445 + R. 396 (*Cun.
Texts*, part xiii, pl. 24 f.; cf. also its duplicate K. 14,949, pl. 24);
but there are strong reasons against the identification of the text as a
fragment of the series *Enuma eli<u>sh</u>*, though it may well be part
of a parallel version of the Creation story (see further, Appendix II).

<span id="fn_156"></span>[91:2](stc09.htm#fr_156.md) The address of the
gods to Marduk forms the subject of the Seventh Tablet of the series.
