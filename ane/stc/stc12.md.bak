### Footnotes

<span id="fn_175"></span>[123:1](stc12.htm#fr_175.md) For the text, see
*Cuneiform Texts*, part xiii, pl. 34, D.T. 41; for a previous
publication, cf. Delitzsch, *Assyrische Lesestücke*, 3rd ed., p. 34 f.;
and for previous translations, see George Smith, *The Chaldean Account
of Genesis*, p. 76f., Zimmern in Gunkel's *Schöpfung und Chaos*, and
Jensen in Schrader's *Keilins. Bibl.*, vi, p. 42 f. This fragment, which
George Smith suggested might be part of the Seventh Tablet of the
Creation Series, does not belong to that series; it contains the
introduction or opening lines of a text, and describes the creation of
two small creatures by Nin-igi-azag, "The lord of clear vision." The
reference to the creation of cattle and beasts of the field is merely
incidental; it occurs in the long opening sentence and indicates the
period at which the two small creatures were made; see further the
Introduction.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[123:2](stc12.htm#fr_176.md) It is probable, that
the second section of the text also dealt with the two small creatures
whose creation is described in the first paragraph.
