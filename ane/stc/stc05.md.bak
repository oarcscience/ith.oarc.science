# The Second Tablet

1\. Tiamat made weighty her handiwork,

2\. \[Evil\] she wrought against the gods her children.

3\. \[To avenge\] Apsû, Tiamat planned evil,

4\. But how she had collected her \[forces, the god ...\] unto Ea
divulged.

5\. Ea \[hearkened to\] this thing, and

6\. He was \[grievous\]ly afflicted and he sat in sorrow.

7\. \[The days\] went by, and his anger was appeased,

8\. And to \[the place of\] An<u>sh</u>ar his father he took\[his way\].

9\. \[He went\] and standing before An<u>sh</u>ar, the father who begat
him,

10\. \[All that\] Tiamat had plotted he repeated unto him,

11\. \[Saying, "Ti\]amat our mother hath conceived a hatred for us,

12\. "With all her force she rageth, full of wrath.

13\. "All the gods have turned to her,

14\. "\[With\] those, whom ye created, they go at her side.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

15\. "They are banded together and at the side of Tiamat they advance;

16\. "They are furious, they devise mischief without resting night and
day.

17\. "They prepare for battle, fuming and raging;

18\. "They have joined their forces and are making war.

19\. "Ummu-<u>H</u>ubur, who formed all things,

20\. "Hath made in addition weapons invincible, she hath spawned
monster-serpents,

21\. "Sharp of tooth, and merciless of fang.

22\. "With poison instead of blood she hath filled their bodies.

23\. "Fierce monster-vipers she hath clothed with terror,

24\. "With splendour she hath decked them, she hath made them of lofty
stature.

25\. "Whoever beholdeth them is overcome by terror,"

26\. "Their bodies rear up and none can withstand their attack.

27\. "She hath set up vipers, and dragons, and the

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

28\. "And hurricanes and raging hounds, and scorpion-men,

29\. "And mighty tempests, and fish-men and rams;

30\. "They bear cruel weapons, without fear of the fight.

31\. "Her commands are mighty, none can resist them;

32\. "After this fashion, huge of stature, hath she made eleven
(monsters).

33\. "Among the gods who are her sons, inasmuch as he hath given her
support,

34\. She hath exalted Kingu; in their midst she hath raised him to
power.

35\. "To march before the forces, to lead the host,

36\. "To give the battle-signal, to advance to the attack,

37\. "\[To direct\] the battle, to control the fight,

38\. "Unto him \[hath she entrusted\]; in costly raiment she hath made
him sit, (saying):

39\. "'\[I have uttered\] thy \[spell\], in the assembly of the gods I
have raised thee to power,

40\. "'\[The dominion over all\] the gods have I entrusted \[unto
thee\].

41\. "'\[Be thou exalted\], thou \[my chosen spouse\],

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

42\. "'\[May they magnify thy name over all of them ...\] ...'

43\. "\[She hath given him the Tablets of Destiny, on his breast she\]
laid them, (saying):

44\. "'\[Thy command shall not be without avail\], and the \[word\] of
thy mouth shall be established.'

45\. "\[Now Kingu, (thus) exalted\], having received the power of Anu,

46\. "Decreed the fate \[for the gods, her sons\], (saying):

47\. "'Let \[the opening of your mouth\] quench the Fire-god;

48\. "'\[Whoso is exalted in the battle\], let him display (his)
might!'"

49\. \[When An<u>sh</u>ar heard how Tiamat\] was mightily in revolt,

50\. \[...\], he bit his lips,

51\. \[...\], his mind was not at peace,

52\. His \[...\], he made a bitter lamentation:

53\. \[...\] battle,

54\. "\[...\] thou ....

55\. "\[Mummu and\] Apsû thou hast smitten,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

56\. "\[But Tiamat hath exalted Kin\]gu, and where is one who can oppose
her?"

57\. \[...\] deliberation

58\. \[ ... the ... of\] the gods, N\[u\]di\[mmud\]

\[A gap of about ten lines occurs here.\]

\(69\) \[...\]

\(70\) \[...\]

\(71\) \[...\]

\(72\) \[An<u>sh</u>ar unto\] his son addressed \[the word\]:

\(73\) "\[...\] ... my mighty hero,

\(74\) "\[Whose\] strength \[is great\] and whose onslaught cannot be
withstood,

\(75\) "\[Go\] and stand before Tiamat,

\(76\) "\[That\] her spirit \[may be appeased\], that her heart may be
merciful.

\(77\) "\[But if\] she will not hearken unto thy word,

\(78\) "Our \[word\] shalt thou speak unto her, that she may be
pacified."

\(79\) \[He heard the\] word of his father An<u>sh</u>ar

\(80\) And \[he directed\] his path to her, towards her he took the way.

\(81\) Anu \[drew nigh\], he beheld the muttering of Tiamat,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span> <span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

\(82\) \[But he could not withstand her\], and he turned back.

\(83\) \[...\] An<u>sh</u>ar

\(84\) \[...\] he spake unto him:

\(85\) "\[...\] upon me

\(104\) \[...\]

\(105\) \[...\] an avenger \[...\]

\(106\) \[...\] va\[liant\]

\(107\) \[...\] in the place of his decision

\(108\) \[...\] he spake unto him:

\(109\) "\[...\] thy father

\(110\) "Thou art my son, who maketh merciful his heart.

\(111\) " \[...\] to the battle shalt thou draw nigh,

\(112\) "\[...\] he that shall behold thee shall have peace."

\(113\) And the lord rejoiced at the word of his father,

\(114\) And he drew nigh and stood before An<u>sh</u>ar.

\(115\) An<u>sh</u>ar beheld him and his heart was filled with joy,

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

\(116\) He kissed him on the lips and his fear departed from him.

\(117\) "\[O my father\], let not the word of thy lips be overcome,

\(118\) "Let me go, that I may accomplish all that is in thy heart.

(119). "\[O An<u>sh</u>ar\], let not the word of thy lips be overcome,

\(120\) ". \[Let me\] go, that I may accomplish all that is in thy
heart."

\(121\) "What man is it, who hath brought thee forth to battle?

\(122\) "\[...\] Tiamat, who is a woman, is armed and attacketh thee."

\(123\) "\[...\] ... rejoice and be glad;

\(124\) "The neck of Tiamat shalt thou swiftly trample under foot.

\(125\) "\[...\] ... rejoice and be glad;

\(126\) "\[The neck\] of Tiamat shalt thou swiftly trample under foot.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

\(127\) "O my \[son\], who knoweth all wisdom,

\(128\) "Pacify \[Tiama\]t with thy pure incantation.

\(129\) "Speedily set out upon thy way,

\(130\) "For \[thy blood (?)\] shall not be poured out, thou shalt
return again."

\(131\) The lord rejoiced at the word of his father,

\(132\) His heart exulted, and unto his father he spake:

\(133\) "O Lord of the gods, Destiny of the great gods,

\(134\) "If I, your avenger,

\(135\) "Conquer Tiamat and give you life,

\(136\) "Appoint an assembly, make my fate preeminent and proclaim it.

\(137\) "In Up<u>sh</u>ukkinaku seat yourselves joyfully together,

\(138\) "With my word in place of you will I decree fate.

\(139\) "May whatsoever I do remain unaltered,

\(140\) "May the word of my lips never be changed nor made of no avail."
