### IV. An Address to the River of Creation <span id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_178.md)

1\. O, thou River, who didst create all things,

2\. When the great gods dug thee out,

3\. They set prosperity upon thy banks,

4\. Within thee Ea, the King of the Deep, created his dwelling,

5\. The deluge they sent not before thou wert!

6\. Fire, and wrath, and splendour, and terror

7\. Have Ea and Marduk presented unto thee!

8\. Thou judgest the cause of mankind!

9\. O, River, thou art mighty! O River, thou art supreme! O River, thou
art righteous!
