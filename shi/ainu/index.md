| **Ainu Texts** |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ainu are Japans' largest ethnic minority. They are known for
[Shamanistic beliefs and practises](../../sha/index.md) which are
considered part of the Siberian tradition. Shamanism is probably one of
the sources of [Shinto](../index.md), the indigenous religion of the ethnic
Japanese.
