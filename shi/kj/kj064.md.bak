## \[SECT. LVII.—EMPEROR I-TOKU.\]

His Augustness Oho-yamato-hiko-suki-tomo dwelt in the palace of Sakahiwo
at Karu, <span id="fr_1077"></span>[1](#fn_1073.md) and ruled the Empire.
This Heavenly Sovereign wedded her Augustness Princess
Futo-ma-waka, <span id="fr_1078"></span>[2](#fn_1074.md) another name for
whom was Her Augustness Princess Ihi-bi, <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[3](#fn_1075.md) ancestress of the Departmental Lords
of Shiki, <span id="fr_1080"></span>[4](#fn_1076.md) and begot august
children: His Augustness Mi-ma-tsu-hiko-wake-shine, <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[5](#fn_1077.md) next His Augustness Tagishi-hiko <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[6](#fn_1078.md) (<span class="small">two
Deities</span>). So His Augustness Mi-ma-tsu-hiko-kawe-shine \[was he
who afterwards\] ruled the Empire. The next His Augustness Tagishi-hiko
(<span class="small">was the ancestor of the Lords of Chinu, <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[7](#fn_1079.md) of the Lords of Take in Tajima, <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[8](#fn_1080.md) and of the Territorial Lords of
Ashiwi</span>). <span id="fr_1085"></span>[9](#fn_1081.md) The Heavenly
Sovereign's august years were forty-five. His august mausoleum is above
the Vale of Manago by Mount Unebi. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[192:1](kj064.htm#fr_1077.md) <span
id="page_192">p. 192</span> Karu, which still remains as a village in
the province of Yamato, was famous down to the early historical days of
Japan, being often mentioned by the poets. The derivation of the name is
quite uncertain. *Sakahi-wo* probably signifies "boundary mound."

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[192:2](kj064.htm#fr_1078.md)
*Futo-ma-wakes-hime-no-mikoto*. The compound signifies "vast, true, and
young princess."

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[192:3](kj064.htm#fr_1079.md)
*Ihibi-hime-no-mikoto*. The name seems to signify "rice-sun-princess."

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[192:4](kj064.htm#fr_1080.md) See Sect. LV, Note
3.

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[192:5](kj064.htm#fr_1081.md) The import of this
name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1078"></span>[192:6](kj064.htm#fr_1082.md) *i.e.*, perhaps
"rudder prince."

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[192:7](kj064.htm#fr_1083.md) *Chinu no wake*.
For Chinu see Sect. XLIV, Notes 35 and 36.

<span id="fn_1080"></span>[192:8](kj064.htm#fr_1084.md) *Tajima no Take no
wake*. Motowori tells us that no mention of any place called Take in the
province of Tajima is to be found in any other book.

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[192:9](kj064.htm#fr_1085.md) *Ashiwi no inaki*.
The same remark applies to this name as to the last. The two "gentile
names" here mentioned are equally unknown except from this passage.

<span id="fn_1082"></span>[192:10](kj064.htm#fr_1086.md) *Unebi-yama no
Manago-dani*. It is in Yamato, and is now called Masago. The name
signifies "a sandy place, or desert."
