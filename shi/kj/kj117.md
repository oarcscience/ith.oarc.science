## \[SECT. CX.—EMPEROR Ō-JIN (PART VIII.—TRIBUTE FROM KOREA).\]

Again King Shō-ko, <span id="fr_1904"></span>[1](#fn_1899) the Chieftain
of the land of Kudara, sent as tribute by Achi-kishi <span
id="fr_1905"></span>[2](#fn_1900) one stallion and one mare. (<span
class="small">This Achi-kishi was the ancestor of the Achiki
Scribes. <span id="fr_1906"></span>[3](#fn_1901)</span>) Again he sent
as tribute a cross-sword, <span id="fr_1907"></span>[4](#fn_1902) and
likewise a large mirror. Again he was graciously bidden <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[5b](#fn_1903) to send as tribute a wise man, if
there were any such in the land of Kudara. Therefore receiving the
\[Imperial\] commands, he sent as tribute a man named Wani-kishi, <span
id="fr_1909"></span>[6](#fn_1904) and likewise by this man he sent as
tribute the Confucian Analects <span id="fr_1910"></span>[7](#fn_1905)
in ten volumes and the Thousand Character Essay <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[8](#fn_1906) in one volume,—altogether eleven
volumes.

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[253\] (<span
class="small">This Wani-kishi was the ancestor of the Fumi
Grandees.</span>) <span id="fr_1912"></span>[9](#fn_1907) Again he sent
as tribute two artisans,—a smith from Kara named Taku-so <span
id="fr_1913"></span>[10](#fn_1908) and a weaver from Go <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[11](#fn_1909) named Sai-so. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1899"></span>[313:1](kj117.htm#fr_1904) <span
id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span id="img_31400"></span>
![](img/31400.jpg), according to the Japanese *kana* spelling, *Sen-ko*.

<span id="fn_1900"></span>[313:2](kj117.htm#fr_1905) <span
id="img_31401"></span> ![](img/31401.jpg). Other forms of the name are
*Ajiki* and *Atogi*, and all three are but attempts at transcribing
phonetically into Japanese a Korean name, the proper characters for
which are not given. <span id="img_31402"></span> ![](img/31402.jpg) is
not properly part of the name, but is simply an official title (<span
id="img_31403"></span> ![](img/31403.jpg) here stands for <span
id="img_31404"></span> ![](img/31404.jpg)).

<span id="fn_1901"></span>[313:3](kj117.htm#fr_1906) *Achiki no
fumi-bito*, *Pumi-bito* (abbreviated to *Fubito*) became a "gentile
name."

<span id="fn_1902"></span>[313:4](kj117.htm#fr_1907) See Sect. XLV, Note
5.

<span id="fn_1903"></span>[313:5b](kj117.htm#fr_1908) *Q.d.*, by the
Japanese Emperor.

<span id="fn_1904"></span>[313:6](kj117.htm#fr_1909) Here written
phonetically <span id="img_31405"></span> ![](img/31405.jpg), but
properly, <span id="img_31406"></span> ![](img/31406.jpg), *i.e.* "the
Official Wang In." He is generally spoken of simply as Wani.

<span id="fn_1905"></span>[313:7](kj117.htm#fr_1910) <span
id="img_31407"></span> ![](img/31407.jpg). ("*Lun Yu*," or
[according](errata.htm#77) to the Japanese pronunciation "*Rongo*.")

<span id="fn_1906"></span>[313:8](kj117.htm#fr_1911) <span
id="img_31408"></span> ![](img/31408.jpg). ("*Chien Tzu Wen*," or
according to the Japanese pronunciation "*Sen ji-mun*.") See the
translator's remarks on this subject in the Introduction, [p.
xliii](kj005.htm#page_xliii). The "Chronicles" more prudently mention
only "various classics."

<span id="fn_1907"></span>[314:9](kj117.htm#fr_1912) *Fumi no obito*.
*Fumi* signifies "any written document," so that this "gentile name "is
equivalent to our word "scribe."

<span id="fn_1908"></span>[314:10](kj117.htm#fr_1913) <span
id="img_31409"></span> ![](img/31409.jpg) The transliteration of this,
as of all other such names here occurring, is the Sinico-Japanese
transliteration. *Kara* (Korea) is written <span id="img_31410"></span>
![](img/31410.jpg).

<span id="fn_1909"></span>[314:11](kj117.htm#fr_1914) <span
id="img_31411"></span> ![](img/31411.jpg) (*Wu*, Jap. *Go*), one of the
states into which China was divided during the third century of our era.
A draper's shop is still called *go-fuku-ya*, *i.e.*, "Wu-garment-house
"in memory of the introduction of wearing apparel from that country.
