ruled the Empire. This Heavenly Sovereign wedded the Elder Lady of Inabi
in Harima, <span id="fr_1514"></span>[2](#fn_1510) daughter of
Waka-take, Prince of Kibi <span id="fr_1515"></span>[3](#fn_1511)

id="fr_1519"></span>[7](#fn_1515) next His Augustness
Yamato-ne-ko; <span id="fr_1520"></span>[8](#fn_1516) next King
Kamu-kushi. <span id="fr_1521"></span>[9](#fn_1517) Again wedding Her
Augustness Princess Yasaka-no-iri, <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[10](#fn_1518) \[202\] daughter of His Augustness
Prince Yasaka-no-iri, he begot august children: His Augustness Prince
Waka-rarashi; <span id="fr_1523"></span>[11](#fn_1519) next His
Augustness Prince Iho-ki-no-iri; <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[12](#fn_1520) next His Augustness
Oshi-no-wake; <span id="fr_1525"></span>[13](#fn_1521) next Her
Augustness Princess Iho-ki-no-iri. <span
id="fr_1526"></span>[14](#fn_1522) Children by another concubine were:
King Toyo-to-wake; <span id="fr_1527"></span>[15](#fn_1523) next the
Lady Nunoshiro. <span id="fr_1528"></span>[16](#fn_1524) Children by
another concubine were: the Lady Nunaki; <span

Kago-yori; <span id="fr_1530"></span>[18](#fn_1526) next King Prince

Oto. <span id="fr_1534"></span>[22](#fn_1530) Again wedding Princess
Mi-hakashi of Himuku, <span id="fr_1535"></span>[23](#fn_1531) he begot
an august child: King Toyo-kuni-wake. <span
id="fr_1536"></span>[24](#fn_1532) Again wedding the Younger Lady of
Inabi, <span id="fr_1537"></span>[25](#fn_1533) younger sister of the
Elder Lady of Inabi, <span id="fr_1538"></span>[26](#fn_1534) he begot
august children: King Ma-waka; next King Hiko-hito-no-oho-ye. <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[27](#fn_1535) Again wedding Princess \[203\]
Ka-guro, <span id="fr_1540"></span>[28](#fn_1536) daughter of King
Princess Sume-iro-oho-naka-tsu-hiko, <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[29](#fn_1537) great-grand-child of His Augustness
Yamato-take, <span id="fr_1542"></span>[30](#fn_1538) he begot an august
child: King Oho-ye. <span id="fr_1543"></span>[31](#fn_1539) The august
children of this Heavenly Sovereign Oho-tarashi-hiko numbered in all
twenty-one kings and queens <span id="fr_1544"></span>[32](#fn_1540) of
whom there is a register, and fifty-nine kings and queens of whom there
is no record,—eighty kings and queens altogether, out of whom His
Augustness Waka-tarashi-hiko and also His Augustness Yamato-take, and
also His Augustness Prince I-ho-ki-no-iri,—these three Kings,—bore the
name of Heirs Apparent. <span id="fr_1545"></span>[33](#fn_1541) The
seventy-seven

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

kings and queens beside these <span id="fr_1546"></span>[34](#fn_1542)
were all granted Rulerships in the various lands, or else \[posts as\]
Lords, Territorial Lords or Departmental Chiefs. <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[35](#fn_1543) So His Augustness Waka-tarashi-hiko
\[was he who afterward\] ruled the Empire. His Augustness Wo-usu subdued
the savage deities and likewise the unsubmissive people in the East
\[204\] and West. The next, King Kushi-tsunu-wake (<span
class="small">was the ancestor of the chiefs of Mamuta</span>). <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[36](#fn_1544) The next, His Augustness Oho-Usu,
(<span class="small">was the ancestor of the Dukes of Mori, <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[37](#fn_1545) of the Dukes of Ohota <span
id="fr_1550"></span>[38](#fn_1546) and of the Dukes of
Shimada.</span>) <span id="fr_1551"></span>[39](#fn_1547) The next, King
Kamukushi, (<span class="small">was the ancestor of the Sakabe Abiko in
the Land of Ki, <span id="fr_1552"></span>[40](#fn_1548) and of the
Sakabe of Uda</span>). <span id="fr_1553"></span>[41](#fn_1549) The
next, King Toyo-kuni-wake (<span class="small">was the ancestor of the
Rulers of the Land of Himuka.</span>) <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1509"></span>[248:1](kj083.htm#fr_1513) <span
id="page_250">p. 250</span> In the province of Yamato. The etymology of
*Makimuku* is obscure. *Hishiro* is tentatively derived by Motowori from
*hi*, the *Chamaecyparis obtusa* (a kind of conifer), and *shiro*, "an
enclosure."

<span id="fn_1510"></span>[248:2](kj083.htm#fr_1514) *Harima no inabi no
oho-iratsume*. Inabi is also known under the alternative form of
*Inami*: etymology uncertain.

<span id="fn_1511"></span>[248:3](kj083.htm#fr_1515) *Waka-take Kibi tsu
biko*, *Waka-take* signifies "young brave."

<span id="fn_1512"></span>[248:4](kj083.htm#fr_1516) *Kibi no omi*.

<span id="fn_1513"></span>[249:5](kj083.htm#fr_1517) *Kushi* signifies
"wondrous," and wake either "young," or "lord." The meaning of *tsunu*
is obscure.

<span id="fn_1514"></span>[249:6](kj083.htm#fr_1518) The names of this
prince and the next signify respectively "great-foot-pestle" and "little
foot-pestle," the origin of the bestowal of which singular designations
is thus related in the parallel passage of the "Chronicles:" "The
Imperial child Oho-usu and His Augustness Wo-usu were born together the
same day as twins. The Heavenly Sovereign, astonished, informed the
foot-pestle. So the two Kings were called Great Foot-pestle and
[Little](errata.htm#50) Foot-pestle." What the import of this passage
may be is, however, a mystery both to Tanigaha Shisei and to Motowori.

<span id="fn_1515"></span>[249:7](kj083.htm#fr_1519) Motowori supposes
*wo-guna* to have been an archaic word for "boy," "me-guna" signifying
"girl." *Yamato wo-guna* would thus signify *the* boy of Japan." a not
inappropriate designation for this prince, who under his later name of
Yamato-take (Japan Brave," *i.e.* *the* brave man of Japan") has
remained as the chief legendary type of the martial prowess of his
native land.

<span id="fn_1516"></span>[249:8](kj083.htm#fr_1520) <span
id="page_251">p. 251</span> *I.e.*. Yamato Prince.

<span id="fn_1517"></span>[249:9](kj083.htm#fr_1521) *Komu-kushi no
miko*, *i.e.*, "divine wondrous."

<span id="fn_1518"></span>[249:10](kj083.htm#fr_1522) *Yamasaka no
iri-bime no mikoto*. The signification of this name and of the next
(*Ya-saka no iri-biko no mikoto*) is obscure.

<span id="fn_1519"></span>[249:11](kj083.htm#fr_1523) *Waka-tarashi-hiko
no mikoto*, i.e., "young and perfect prince."

<span id="fn_1520"></span>[249:12](kj083.htm#fr_1524) *I-ho-ki no
iri-biko no mikoto*. Signification obscure.

<span id="fn_1521"></span>[249:13](kj083.htm#fr_1525) Or, *Oshi-wake*,
*i.e.*, perhaps "Great Lord."

<span id="fn_1522"></span>[249:14](kj083.htm#fr_1526) *I-ho-ki no
iri-bime no mikoto*. Signification obscure.

<span id="fn_1523"></span>[249:15](kj083.htm#fr_1527) *Toyo-to-wake no
mikoto*, *i.e.*, perhaps "luxuriant swift prince."

<span id="fn_1524"></span>[249:16](kj083.htm#fr_1528) *Nunoshiro no
iratsumo*. Signification obscure.

<span id="fn_1525"></span>[249:17](kj083.htm#fr_1529) *Nunaki no
iratsume*. Signification obscure.

<span id="fn_1526"></span>[249:18](kj083.htm#fr_1530) *Kago yori-hime no
mikoto*. *Yori ime* probably means "good princess." The sense of *kago*
is very doubtful, for it may either be the name of a place, or else
identical with the Verb *kagayaku* "to shine," or with *kago*, "a stag."

<span id="fn_1527"></span>[249:19](kj083.htm#fr_1531) *Waka-ki no
iri-biko no mikoto*. The signification of this name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1528"></span>[249:20](kj083.htm#fr_1532) *Kibi no ye-hike
no mikoto*.

<span id="fn_1529"></span>[249:21](kj083.htm#fr_1533) *Takaki-hime no
mikoto*. The meaning of *takaki* in this place is not certain.

<span id="fn_1530"></span>[249:22](kj083.htm#fr_1534) *Oto-hime no
mikoto*, *i.e.*, "the younger princes."

<span id="fn_1531"></span>[249:23](kj083.htm#fr_1535) *Himuka no
Mi-hakashi-bime*. *Mi-hakashi* signifies "august sabre." See Motowori's
Commentary, Vol. XXVI, p. 11, for a gloss on this curious name.

<span id="fn_1532"></span>[249:24](kj083.htm#fr_1536) *Toyo-kuni-wake no
miko*, *i.e.*, perhaps "lord of the luxuriant land," or else "lord of
the land of Toyo," the Emperor Kei-kō having, according to the account
in the "Chronicles," spent some years fighting in South-Western Japan,
where the province of Toyo is situated.

<span id="fn_1533"></span>[249:25](kj083.htm#fr_1537) *Inabi no
waki-iratsume*. See Note 2 to this Section.

<span id="fn_1534"></span>[249:26](kj083.htm#fr_1538) *Ma-waka no miko*,
*i.e.*, "truly young prince."

<span id="fn_1535"></span>[249:27](kj083.htm#fr_1539) *Hiko-hito no
oho-ye no miko*. *Hiko* signifies "prince," *hito* is "person" (or here,
according to Motowori, "headman"), and *oho ye* is "great elder
brother."

<span id="fn_1536"></span>[249:28](kj083.htm#fr_1540) *Ka-guro-hime*,
*i.e.*, probably "the black-haired princess."

<span id="fn_1537"></span>[249:29](kj083.htm#fr_1541)
*Sume-iro-oho-naka-tsu-biko-no-mikoto*. The signification of this name
is not clear. Motowori identifies *sume* with the like-sounding Verb
signifying "to be supreme." *Oha-naka-tsu-hiko* may signify "great
middle prince," referring to the comparative ages of this prince and his
brethren.

<span id="fn_1538"></span>[249:30](kj083.htm#fr_1542) <span
id="page_252">p. 252</span> There is here an evident error in the
genealogy, as it would make the emperor marry his own great-great-grand
daughter! A guess of the editor of 1687 that for Yamato-take we should
read Waka-take (a son of the Emperor Kō-rei) is approved by Motowori,
and may be adopted as probably correct,—*i.e.* (what is but little
likely) if this portion of the "Records" should eventually be proved to
be historically trustworthy. The question is discussed by Motowori in
Vol. XXVI, pp. 12-14. of his Commentary.

<span id="fn_1539"></span>[249:31](kj083.htm#fr_1543) *Oho-ye no miko*.
This name would, as Motowori remarks, appear to have erroneously crept
in here through the influence of the name mentioned in Note 27, the
whole account of this union with Princess Ka-guro being corrupt.

<span id="fn_1540"></span>[249:32](kj083.htm#fr_1544) The Japanese term
(<span id="img_25200"></span> ![](img/25200.jpg) *miko*) includes both
males and females.

<span id="fn_1541"></span>[249:33](kj083.htm#fr_1545) <span
id="img_25201"></span> ![](img/25201.jpg).

<span id="fn_1542"></span>[250:34](kj083.htm#fr_1546) As above remarked,
the Japanese term includes both males and females, and moreover some of
the female children are specially mentioned. The difficulty as to how
females could have been appointed to the offices here mentioned is not
solved by Motowori, whose note on this passage is evasive.

<span id="fn_1543"></span>[250:35](kj083.htm#fr_1547) The four names of
offices (also used as "gentile names") here mentioned are in the
original Japanese *Kuni no Miyatsuko*, *Wake*, *Inaki*, and
*Agata-mushi*. (See Introduction, [p. xvi](kj002.htm#page_xvi).)

<span id="fn_1544"></span>[250:36](kj083.htm#fr_1548) *Mamuta no
murazhi*. (See Sect. LIII, Note 1.)

<span id="fn_1545"></span>[250:37](kj083.htm#fr_1549) *Mori no kimi*.
*Mori* seems to be the name of a place (perhaps in Mino); but nothing is
known of this family.

<span id="fn_1546"></span>[250:38](kj083.htm#fr_1550) *Ohota no kimi*.
*Ohota* is the name of a place in Mino, and signifies "great
rice-field."

<span id="fn_1547"></span>[250:39](kj083.htm#fr_1551) *Shimada no kimi*.
*Shimada* is perhaps the name of a place in Wohari. It signifies "island
rice-fields."

<span id="fn_1548"></span>[250:40](kj083.htm#fr_1552) *Ki no kuni no
sakabe no abiko*. For also see Sect. LXXII, Note 85. *Sakabe* seems to
signify "liquor tribe," this family and the next having been entrusted
with the management of the Imperial feasts.

<span id="fn_1549"></span>[250:41](kj083.htm#fr_1553) *Uda no sakabe*,
*i.e.*, the "Liquor Tribe of Uda." (in Yamato).

<span id="fn_1550"></span>[250:42](kj083.htm#fr_1554) *Himuka no kuni no
miyatsuko*.
