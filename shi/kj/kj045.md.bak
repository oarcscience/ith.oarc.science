## \[SECT. XXXVIII.—THE AUGUST CHILD-BEARING OF PRINCESS-BLOSSOMING BRILLIANTLY-LIKE-THE-FLOWERS-OF-THE-TREES.\]

So later on
Princess-Blossoming-Brilliantly-Like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees waited
on <span id="fr_794"></span>[1](#fn_790.md) \[His Augustness Prince
Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty, and said: "I <span
id="fr_795"></span>[2](#fn_791.md) am pregnant, and now the time for my
delivery approaches. "It is not fit for me to be delivered of the august
offspring of Heaven privately; <span id="fr_796"></span>[3](#fn_792.md) so
I tell thee." Then \[His Augustness Prince Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty\] said:
"Princess-Blossoming-Brilliantly! <span id="fr_797"></span>[4](#fn_793.md)
what! pregnant after one night! <span id="fr_798"></span>[5](#fn_794.md) It
cannot be my child. It must surely be the child of an Earthly
Deity." <span id="fr_799"></span>[6](#fn_795.md) Then she replied, saying:
"If the child with \[118\] which I am pregnant be the child of an
Earthly Deity,

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

my delivery will not be fortunate. If it be the august child of the
Heavenly Deity, <span id="fr_800"></span>[7](#fn_796.md) it will be
fortunate;"—and thereupon she built a hall eight fathoms \[long\]
without doors, <span id="fr_801"></span>[8](#fn_797.md) went inside the
hall and plastered up \[the entrance\] with earth; and when the time
came for her delivery, she set fire to the hall and was delivered. <span
id="fr_802"></span>[9](#fn_798.md) So the name of the child that was born
when the fire was burning most fiercely was His Augustness
Fire-Shine <span id="fr_803"></span>[10](#fn_799.md) (<span
class="small">this is the ancestor of the Hayabito, Dukes of
Ata</span>); <span id="fr_804"></span>[11](#fn_800.md) the name of the
child born next was His Augustness Fire-Climax; <span
id="fr_805"></span>[12](#fn_801.md) the august <span
id="fr_806"></span>[13](#fn_802.md) name of the child born next was His
Augustness \[119\] Fire-Subside, <span id="fr_807"></span>[14](#fn_803.md)
another name for whom is His Augustness
Heaven's-Sun-Height-Prince-Great-Rice-ears-Lord-Ears <span
id="fr_808"></span>[15](#fn_804.md) (<span class="small">three Deities in
all</span>). <span id="fr_809"></span>[16](#fn_805.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_790"></span>[143:1](kj045.htm#fr_794.md) <span
id="page_144">p. 144</span> More literally "came to"; but the character
which is employed implies that her visit was to a superior.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[143:2](kj045.htm#fr_795.md) Written with the
character <span id="img_14400"></span> ![](img/14400.jpg), a "concubine"
or "handmaid," a common self-depreciatory equivalent of the First
Personal Pronoun in Chinese, when the speaker is a woman.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[143:3](kj045.htm#fr_796.md) *I.e.* "secretly,"
"without telling thee."

<span id="fn_793"></span>[143:4](kj045.htm#fr_797.md) In this one instance
only is the name thus abbreviated. Motowori supposes it to be on account
of the scorn implied in the god's words

<span id="fn_794"></span>[143:5](kj045.htm#fr_798.md) Literally, "one
sojourn."

<span id="fn_795"></span>[143:6](kj045.htm#fr_799.md) See Sect. I, Note 11.
Here of course one of the gods of the same country-side is meant.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[144:7](kj045.htm#fr_800.md) *I.e.* "thy child and
the Sun-Goddess descendant."

<span id="fn_797"></span>[144:8](kj045.htm#fr_801.md) That is to say that
it remained doorless after she had, as stated immediately below,
plastered up the entrance.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[144:9](kj045.htm#fr_802.md) Viz. of child, not
from the flames. There is no ambiguity in the Japanese expression.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[144:10](kj045.htm#fr_803.md) *Ho-deri-na-mikoto*.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[144:11](kj045.htm#fr_804.md)
*Hayabito-ata-no-kimi*. Ata is, as has been already stated in Note 2 to
Sect. XXXVII, the name of a place in Satsuma. *Haya-bito* ("swift men,"
"bold men," literally, if we follow the Chinese characters "falcon men")
was an ancient designation of the inhabitants of the south-western
corner of Japan which was subsequently divided into the provinces <span
id="page_145">p. 145</span> of Satsuma and Ohosumi, and came by metonymy
to be used to denote the province of Satsuma itself, for which reason it
remained as the Pillow-Word for the word Satsuma even after the
exclusive use of this latter name had been established. In after times
the *hayabito* (also contracted to *hayato* and *haito*) were chiefly
known as forming the Infantry of the Imperial Guard, a curious choice of
provincials for which mythological sanction was invoked. They are also
said to have furnished the performers of a symbolic dance mentioned at
the end of Sect. XLI (see Note 3 to that Sect.) In later Sections of
this work, the translator has ventured to render *hayabito* by
"man-at-arms."

<span id="fn_801"></span>[144:12](kj045.htm#fr_805.md)
*Ho-suseri-no-mikoto*.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[144:13](kj045.htm#fr_806.md) The Honorific is
doubtless prefixed in this case and not in the others, because it was to
this prince or deity that the Imperial House traced its descent.
Motowori's *kana* reading, which prefixes Honorifics to all such names
indifferently, obliterates this delicate distinction.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[144:14](kj045.htm#fr_807.md) *Ho-wori-no-mikoto*.
The derivation of this name is less clear than that of his elder
brothers. Motowori's proposal to consider it as a corruption of
*ho-yohari*, "fire weakening," is however plausible; and as this triad
of names is evidently intended to paint the stages in the progress of
the conflagration, the import of the third must be something very like
what Motowori suggests, even if his guess at the original form of the
word be not quite correct. The names of all three brethren differ more
or less in the parallel passage of the "Chronicles ".

<span id="fn_804"></span>[144:15](kj045.htm#fr_808.md)
*Ama-tsu-hi-daka-hiko-ho-ho-de-mi-no-mikoto*. The interpretation of the
last four members of this compound name is extremely doubtful.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[144:16](kj045.htm#fr_809.md) The actual word in
the text is not *kumi*, "deity," but its Auxiliary Numeral *hashira*.
