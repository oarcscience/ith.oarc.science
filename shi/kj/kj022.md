## \[SECT XV.—THE AUGUST RAVAGES OF HIS IMPETUOUS-MALE-AUGUSTNESS\]

Then His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness said to the
Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity: "Owing to the sincerity of my
intentions I have, in begetting children, gotten delicate females.
judging from this, <span id="fr_372"></span>[1](#fn_369) I have
undoubtedly gained the victory! With these words, and impetuous with
victory, he broke down the divisions of the ricefields <span
id="fr_373"></span>[2](#fn_370) laid out by the
Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity, filled up the ditches, and moreover
strewed \[53\] excrements <span id="fr_374"></span>[3](#fn_371) in the
palace where she partook of the great food. <span
id="fr_375"></span>[4](#fn_372) So, though he did thus, the
Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity upbraided him not, <span
id="fr_376"></span>[5](#fn_373) but said: "What looks like excrements
must be something that His Augustness mine elder brother has vomited
through drunkenness. Again, as to his breaking down the divisions of the
rice

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

fields and filling up the ditches, it must be because he grudges the
land \[they occupy <span id="fr_377"></span>[6](#fn_374)\] that His
Augustness mine elder brother acts thus." But notwithstanding these
apologetic words, he still continued his evil acts, and was more and
more \[violent\]. As the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity sat in her
awful <span id="fr_378"></span>[7](#fn_375) weaving-hall <span
id="fr_379"></span>[8](#fn_376) seeing to the weaving of, the august
garments of the Deities, he broke a hole in the top <span
id="fr_380"></span>[9](#fn_377) of the weaving-hall, and through it let
fall a heavenly piebald horse \[54\] which he had flayed with a backward
flaying, <span id="fr_381"></span>[10](#fn_378) at whose sight the women
weaving the heavenly garments were so much alarmed that impegerunt
privatas partes adversis radiis et obierunt. <span
id="fr_382"></span>[11](#fn_379)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_369"></span>[61:1](kj022.htm#fr_372) <span id="page_62">p.
62</span> Literally "if one speak from this."

<span id="fn_370"></span>[61:2](kj022.htm#fr_373) The character used is
<span id="img_06200"></span> ![](img/06200.jpg), which in Chinese does
not necessarily signify a *rice*-field. But in Japanese it seems to have
been always limited to this narrower meaning, to which likewise the
context here clearly points.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[61:3](kj022.htm#fr_374) In the original
written <span id="img_06201"></span> ![](img/06201.jpg) which is partly
ideographic and partly phonetic for *kuso-mari*. Motowori interprets it
to signify "excrements and urine"; but the parallel passage of the
"Chronicles" which he himself quotes goes to prove that *mari* had not
the latter meaning, as does also another well-known passage in the "Tale
of a Bamboo-Cutter."

<span id="fn_372"></span>[61:4](kj022.htm#fr_375) <span
id="img_06202"></span> ![](img/06202.jpg) read *oh-nihe*. The word
*nihe* now denotes "a sacrifice," and *oh-nihe no matsuri* is the
religious festival of the tasting of the first new rice of the season.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[61:5](kj022.htm#fr_376) We might, following
classical usage, translate the Verb *togamezu*, which is written
phonetically, by the words "took no heed" or "made no observation"; but
in this passage it certainly seems to have the stronger and more
specialized signification of "upbraiding," "scolding," which attaches to
it in the colloquial dialect.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[62:6](kj022.htm#fr_377) *I.e.*, he thinks that
none of the land should be wasted in ditches and embankments, but should
all be devoted to the production of food.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[62:7](kj022.htm#fr_378) The character used is
<span id="img_06203"></span> ![](img/06203.jpg) "to shun," which in
Japanese has approximately the meaning of "sacred." Thus a certain
family of priests <span id="page_63">p. 63</span> was called by the name
of *Imibe*, lit. "the shunning clan," on account of the uncleanness from
which they were bound to abstain.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[62:8](kj022.htm#fr_379) Written with
characters signifying literally "garment-house," but the meaning, as
understood by the native commentators is that given in the text.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[62:9](kj022.htm#fr_380) <span
id="img_06300"></span> ![](img/06300.jpg). This character is taken by
the native commentators in the sense of <span id="img_06301"></span>
![](img/06301.jpg), *mune*, "ridge-pole."

<span id="fn_378"></span>[62:10](kj022.htm#fr_381) *I.e.,* it is
supposed, beginning at the tail. That this was considered criminal may
be seen by comparing Sect. XCVII. Note 3.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[62:11](kj022.htm#fr_382) In the parallel
passage of the "Chronicles" it is the goddess who injures herself with
her shuttle, but without dying of the effects of the accident.
