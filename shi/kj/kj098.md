## \[SECT. XCI.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART XVI.—YAMATO-TAKE'S BUTLER).\]

During all the time that this \[Prince\] His Augustness Yamato-take went
about pacifying countries, Nana-tsuka-hagi, <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[1a](#fn_1664.md) ancestor of the Suzerains of
Kuna, <span id="fr_1670"></span>[2a](#fn_1665.md) always followed and
respectfully served him as butler.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1664"></span>[277:1a](kj098.htm#fr_1669.md) The name signifies
"seven-grasp shins," implying that the worthy here mentioned was so big
and strong as to have shins seven hand-breadths in length. For the use
of the word "grasp "as a measure of length, see Sect. VIII, Note 1.

<span id="fn_1665"></span>[277:2a](kj098.htm#fr_1670.md) This family has
already been mentioned at the end of Sect. XXXIV, as descended from
Ama-tsu-kume no Mikoto, one of the companions of the Emperor Jim-mu's
grandfather on the occasion of his descent from Heaven. But see Note 7
to that Sect. for the probable mistake with regard to the origin of the
name.
