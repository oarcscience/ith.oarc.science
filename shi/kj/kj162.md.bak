## \[SECT. CLV.—EMPEROR YŪ-RIYAKU (PART VI.—HE MAKES A PROGRESS TO YESHINU).\]

Yeshinu, <span id="fr_2326"></span>[1](#fn_2321.md) there was on the bank
of the Yeshinu

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

river a girl of beautiful appearance. So having wedded this girl, he
returned to the Palace. Afterwards, when he again made a progress to
Yeshinu, he halted where he had met the girl, and in that place raised a
great august throne, <span id="fr_2327"></span>[2a](#fn_2322.md) seated
himself on that august throne, played on his august lute, and made the
maiden dance. Then he composed an august Song on account of the maiden's
good dancing. That Song said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Oh! that the maiden dancing to the lute-playing, of the august hand of
the Deity seated on the throne might continue for ever!" <span

</div>
