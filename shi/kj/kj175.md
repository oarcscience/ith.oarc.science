## \[SECT. CLXVIII.—EMPEROR KEN-ZŌ (PART II.—HE SLAYS THE BOAR-HERD).\]

The Heavenly Sovereign searched for the old boar-herd who had seized his
august provisions at the time when he first met with adversity and was
fleeing; <span id="fr_2400"></span>[1](#fn_2395) and, having sought him
out, sent for him up \[to the Capital\], beheaded him in the bed <span
id="fr_2401"></span>[2](#fn_2396) of the River Asuka, <span
id="fr_2402"></span>[3](#fn_2397) and cut the knee-tendons of all his
kindred. Wherefore down to the present time his descendants, on the day
when <span id="fr_2403"></span>[4](#fn_2398) they \[285\] come up to
Yamato, always limp of their own accord. So the man's abode had been
well seen and divined. <span id="fr_2404"></span>[5](#fn_2399) So the
place was named Shimesu. <span id="fr_2405"></span>[6](#fn_2400)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2395"></span>[419:1](kj175.htm#fr_2400) <span
id="page_419">p. 419</span> See Sect. CXLIX.

<span id="fn_2396"></span>[419:2](kj175.htm#fr_2401) Motowori would have
us understand the text to mean "in the neighbourhood of the river."
There is, however, no difficulty in accepting the author's statement
literally, as any one who is acquainted with the broad, stony beds of
Japanese rivers will readily admit.

<span id="fn_2397"></span>[419:3](kj175.htm#fr_2402) <span
id="page_420">p. 420</span> *Asuki-gaka*. For Asuka see Sect. CXXXIII.
Note 11.

<span id="fn_2398"></span>[419:4](kj175.htm#fr_2403) *I.e.*, probably
"whenever."

<span id="fn_2399"></span>[419:5](kj175.htm#fr_2404) *I.e.*, "discovered
by augury," or else simply "found and pointed out,"—by whom does not
appear.

<span id="fn_2400"></span>[419:6](kj175.htm#fr_2405) The real etymology
of this name is obscure, but the author's intention is to connect it
with the "dividing "or "pointing out" mentioned in the preceding
sentence, which is given phonetically as \[*mi*\] *shimeki*.
