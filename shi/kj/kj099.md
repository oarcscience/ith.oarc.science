Princess Futaji-no-iri, <span id="fr_1671"></span>[1b](#fn_1666.md)
daughter of the Heavenly Sovereign Ikume, and begot an august child: His
Augustness Tarashi-naka-tsu-hiko <span
id="fr_1672"></span>[2b](#fn_1667.md) (<span class="small">one
Deity</span>). Again, wedding Her Augustness Princess
Oto-tachibana <span id="fr_1673"></span>[3](#fn_1668.md) who \[afterwards\]

august child: King Waka-take <span id="fr_1675"></span>[5](#fn_1670.md)
(<span class="small">one Deity</span>). Again, wedding Princess \[224\]
Futaji, <span id="fr_1676"></span>[6](#fn_1671.md) daughter of
Oho-tamu-wake, <span id="fr_1677"></span>[7](#fn_1672.md) ancestor of the
Rulers of the Land of Yasu in Chika-tsu-Afumi, <span
id="fr_1678"></span>[8](#fn_1673.md) he begot an august child: King
Ine-yori-wake <span id="fr_1679"></span>[9](#fn_1674.md) (<span

Oho-kibi-take, <span id="fr_1680"></span>[10](#fn_1675.md) younger sister
of Take-hiko \[ancestor of the\] Grandees of Kiki, <span

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

august child: King Take-kahiko <span id="fr_1682"></span>[12](#fn_1677.md)
(<span class="small">one Deity</span>). Again, wedding Princess
Kukuma-mori of Yamashiro, <span id="fr_1683"></span>[13](#fn_1678.md) he
begot an august child, King Ashi-kagami-wake <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[14](#fn_1679.md) (<span class="small">one
Deity</span>). A child by another wife was King Okinaga-ta-wake. <span
id="fr_1685"></span>[15](#fn_1680.md) Al-together the entire \[number\] of
the august children of His Augustness Yamato-take was six Deities. So
His Augustness Tarashi-naka-tsu-hiko \[was he who afterwards\] ruled the
Empire. The next, King Ine-yori-wake (<span class="small">was the
ancestor of the Dukes of Inukami <span
id="fr_1686"></span>[16](#fn_1681.md) and of the Dukes of
Takebe</span>.) <span id="fr_1687"></span>[17](#fn_1682.md) \[225\] The
next, King Take-kahiko (<span class="small">was the ancestor of the
Dukes of Aya in Sanugi, <span id="fr_1688"></span>[18](#fn_1683.md) the
Dukes of Wake in Iyo, <span id="fr_1689"></span>[19](#fn_1684.md) the Lords
of Towo, <span id="fr_1690"></span>[20](#fn_1685.md) the Headmen of
Masa <span id="fr_1691"></span>[21](#fn_1686.md) and the Lords of
Miyaji.</span>) <span id="fr_1692"></span>[22](#fn_1687.md) King
Ashi-kagami-wake (<span class="small">was the ancestor of the Lords of
Kamakura, <span id="fr_1693"></span>[23](#fn_1688.md) the Dukes of
Wodzu, <span id="fr_1694"></span>[24](#fn_1689.md) the Lords of
Ihashiro <span id="fr_1695"></span>[25](#fn_1690.md) and the Lords of
Fukita.</span>) <span id="fr_1696"></span>[26](#fn_1691.md) The child of
the next, King Okinaga-ta-wake was King Kuhi-mata-naga-hiko. <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[27](#fn_1692.md) This King's children were: Her
Augustness Princess Ihinu-ma-guro, <span
id="fr_1698"></span>[28](#fn_1693.md) next
Okinaga-ma-waka-naka-tsu-hime, <span id="fr_1699"></span>[29](#fn_1694.md)
next Oto-hime <span id="fr_1700"></span>[30](#fn_1695.md) (<span
class="small">three Deities</span>). So the above mentioned King
Waka-take wedded Princess Ihinu-ma-guro, \[226\] and begot King
Sume-iro-oho-naka-tsu-hiko. <span id="fr_1701"></span>[31](#fn_1696.md)
This King wedded Princess Shibanu, <span
id="fr_1702"></span>[32](#fn_1697.md) daughter of Shibanu-iri-ki <span
id="fr_1703"></span>[33](#fn_1698.md) of Afumi, and begot a child, Her
Augustness Princess Kaguro. <span id="fr_1704"></span>[34](#fn_1699.md) So
the Heavenly Sovereign Oho-tarashi-hiko wedded this \[lady\] Her
Augustness Princess Kaguro, and begot King Oho-ye <span
id="fr_1705"></span>[35](#fn_1700.md) (<span class="small">one
Deity</span>). This King wedded his younger half-sister Queen
Shiro-kane, <span id="fr_1706"></span>[36](#fn_1701.md) and begot children:
King Oho-na-gata, <span id="fr_1707"></span>[37](#fn_1702.md) and next Her
Augustness Oho-naka-tsu-hime <span id="fr_1708"></span>[38](#fn_1703.md)
(<span class="small">two Deities</span>). So this \[Lady\] Her
Augustness Oho-naka-tsu-hime was the august mother <span
id="fr_1709"></span>[39](#fn_1704.md) of King Kagosaka <span
id="fr_1710"></span>[40](#fn_1705.md) and King Oshikuma. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1666"></span>[277:1b](kj099.htm#fr_1671.md) <span
id="page_278">p. 278</span> For this name see Sect. LXIX, Note 24.

<span id="fn_1667"></span>[277:2b](kj099.htm#fr_1672.md) *I.e.*, "the
perfect middle prince," a name which is justified by <span
id="page_279">p. 279</span> the genealogy as given in the "Chronicles,"
where he is mentioned as the second of three sons borne by this
princess.

<span id="fn_1668"></span>[277:3](kj099.htm#fr_1673.md) *Oto-tachibana-hime
no mikoto*. *Oto* signifies "younger \[sister\]," and *Oto-tachibana* is
the name of the orange.

<span id="fn_1669"></span>[277:4](kj099.htm#fr_1674.md) See the story in
Sect. LXXXIV.

<span id="fn_1670"></span>[277:5](kj099.htm#fr_1675.md) *Waka-tate no
miko*. This name signifies "young brave."

<span id="fn_1671"></span>[277:6](kj099.htm#fr_1676.md) *Futaji-hime*.
Signification obscure. Futaji may be the name of a place.

<span id="fn_1672"></span>[277:7](kj099.htm#fr_1677.md) If *Tamu* is, as
Motowori surmises, the name of a place, this personal name signifies
"Great Lord of Tamu."

<span id="fn_1673"></span>[277:8](kj099.htm#fr_1678.md) *Chika-tsu-Afumi no
Yasu no kuni no miyatsuko*. For *Yasu* see Sect. LXII, Note 62.

<span id="fn_1674"></span>[277:9](kj099.htm#fr_1679.md) *Ine-yori-wake no
miko*. This name probably signifies "rice-good-lord."

<span id="fn_1675"></span>[277:10](kj099.htm#fr_1680.md)
*Oho-kibi-take-hime*. *Oho* signifies "great." For the other two
elements of the compound see next Note.

<span id="fn_1676"></span>[277:11](kj099.htm#fr_1681.md) The text has *Kibi
no omi Take-hiko*, as if this worthy had been himself the "Grandee of
Kibi." Motowori however compares the commencement of Sect. LXXXII (Notes
2 and 3), and supplies the words "ancestor of." *Kibi* is of course the
province of that name (the modern, Bizen, Bitchiū, and Bingo), and
*take* signifies "brave."

<span id="fn_1677"></span>[278:12](kj099.htm#fr_1682.md) *Take-kahiko no
miko*. *Take* signifies "brave," *kahiko* is either "egg "or "cocoon,"
or else perhaps a corruption of some other word.

<span id="fn_1678"></span>[278:13](kj099.htm#fr_1683.md) *Yamashiro no
Kukuma mori-hime*. This name is obscure. Motowori identifies Kukuma with
a place called *Kurihuma*, and *mori* is probably the Verb "to guard."

<span id="fn_1679"></span>[278:14](kj099.htm#fr_1684.md) *Ashi-kagami-wake
no miko*. This name is written with characters signifying
"foot-mirror-\[lord\]."

<span id="fn_1680"></span>[278:15](kj099.htm#fr_1685.md) *Okinaga-ta-wake
no miko*. This name is obscure. Motowori believes Okinaga to be the name
of a place in Afumi, but has no explanation to offer of *ta*.

<span id="fn_1681"></span>[278:16](kj099.htm#fr_1686.md) *Inukami no kimi*.
Inukami is the name of a district in Afumi, Its signification is not
clear.

<span id="fn_1682"></span>[278:17](kj099.htm#fr_1687.md) *Takebi no kimi*.
*Takebe* became the name of a place in Idzumo, but it originally
signified "brave tribe," the family having, as in so many other cases,
given its name to the place of its residence, instead of being called
after the latter. See the origin of the name, given in Motowori's
Commentary, Vol. XXIV, pp. 35-36.

<span id="fn_1683"></span>[278:18](kj099.htm#fr_1688.md) *Sanugi no Aya no
kimi*. For *Sanugi* see Sect. V, Note 6. *Aya* is a district in the
province; the name is of doubtful origin.

<span id="fn_1684"></span>[278:19](kj099.htm#fr_1689.md) <span
id="page_280">p. 280</span> *Iyo no wake no kani*. For *Iyo* see Sect.
V, Note 4. (The text here has *Ise* for Iyo, and the word *wake* is
missing, but Motowori's emendation may be accepted). *Wake* is the name
of a district in Iyo.

<span id="fn_1685"></span>[278:20](kj099.htm#fr_1690.md) *Towo no wake*. Of
*Towo* nothing is known.

<span id="fn_1686"></span>[278:21](kj099.htm#fr_1691.md) *Masa no obito*.
Of *Masa* nothing is known.

<span id="fn_1687"></span>[278:22](kj099.htm#fr_1692.md) *Miyagi* (<span
id="img_28000"></span> ![](img/28000.jpg)) *no wake*. This is Motowori's
ingenious emendation of the characters in the text, <span
id="img_28001"></span> ![](img/28001.jpg), out of which it is impossible
to make a [family](errata.htm#60.md) name. *Miyagi* is the name of a place
in the province of Mikaha, and signifies "temple road."

<span id="fn_1688"></span>[278:23](kj099.htm#fr_1693.md) *Kamakura no
wake*. Kamakura is the name of a district in the province of Sagami,
which became famous during the Middle Ages as the site of an immense
town,—the capital of the Shōgun, and the centre of the feudalism which
then ruled Japan. The import of the name (literally "sickle-store") is
not clear, though it has been fancifully explained by native
etymologists.

<span id="fn_1689"></span>[278:24](kj099.htm#fr_1694.md) *Wodzu no kimi*.
The words *no kimi* are supplied by Motowori, this name and the next
being in the text run into one. Wodzu seems to be the name of a place in
Afumi, and signifies "little mart."

<span id="fn_1690"></span>[278:25](kj099.htm#fr_1695.md) *Ihashiro no
wake*. Motowori says that this Ihashiro is not the province of that
name, but a place in Kishiu. The meaning of the name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1691"></span>[278:26](kj099.htm#fr_1696.md) *Fukita no wake*.
This is but Motowori's conjectural restoration (founded on a statement
in the "Chronicles of Old Matters of Former Ages") of the name as given
in the text, <span id="img_28002"></span> ![](img/28002.jpg).

<span id="fn_1692"></span>[278:27](kj099.htm#fr_1697.md)
*Kuhimata-naga-hiko no miko*. *Kuhimata* (modern *Kumata*) is the name
of a place in Settsu. The signification is obscure. *Naga-hiko* means
"long prince."

<span id="fn_1693"></span>[278:28](kj099.htm#fr_1698.md)
*Ihinu-ma-guro-hime*, *i.e.*, "quite black princess of Ihinu," the
blackness being doubtless predicated of her hair. *Ihinu* is the name of
a district in Ise, and is written with characters signifying
"boiled-rice-moor."

<span id="fn_1694"></span>[278:29](kj099.htm#fr_1699.md) For *Okinaga* see
Note 15. *Ma-waka* means "truly young." *Naka-tsu-hime* means "middle
princess," referring to her being the second of three.

<span id="fn_1695"></span>[278:30](kj099.htm#fr_1700.md) *I.e.*, "younger
princess."

<span id="fn_1696"></span>[278:31](kj099.htm#fr_1701.md) See Sect. LXXVI,
Note 29.

<span id="fn_1697"></span>[278:32](kj099.htm#fr_1702.md) *Shibanu-hime*.
This name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1698"></span>[278:33](kj099.htm#fr_1703.md) *Shibunu iri-ko*.
This name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1699"></span>[278:34](kj099.htm#fr_1704.md) *Ka-gara hime*,
see Sect. LXXVI, Note 28.

<span id="fn_1700"></span>[278:35](kj099.htm#fr_1705.md) <span
id="page_281">p. 281</span> For the confusion in this portion of the
genealogy see Sect. LXXVI, Note 30.

<span id="fn_1701"></span>[278:36](kj099.htm#fr_1706.md) *Shiro-kane no
miko*. *Shiro-kane* means "silver," but Motowori suspects corruption in
the text.

<span id="fn_1702"></span>[278:37](kj099.htm#fr_1707.md) *Oho-nagata no
miko*, *i.e.*, "great prince of Nagata," the latter being the name of a
place in Settsu, signifying "long rice-field."

<span id="fn_1703"></span>[278:38](kj099.htm#fr_1708.md) *I.e.*, "great
middle princess."

<span id="fn_1704"></span>[278:39](kj099.htm#fr_1709.md) Literally,
"ancestress."

<span id="fn_1705"></span>[278:40](kj099.htm#fr_1710.md) Or, "the King of
Kagosaka," for it is' uncertain whether Kagosaka should or should not be
regarded as the name of a place. The etymology of the name may be
*kago*, "a stag" and *saka*, "an ascent." The original form of the name
and title is *Kagosaka no miko*.

<span id="fn_1706"></span>[278:41](kj099.htm#fr_1711.md) Or, "the King of
Oshikuma," *Oshikuma no miko*. *Oshikuma* is a word of doubtful
etymology.
