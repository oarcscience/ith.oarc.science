## \[SECT. CV.—EMPEROR Ō-JIN (PART II.—HE DIVIDES THE INHERITANCE BETWEEN HIS THREE SONS)\]

Hereupon the Heavenly Sovereign asked His Augustness Oho-yama-mori and
His Augustness Oho-sazaki, saying: "Which think ye the dearer, an elder
child or a younger child?" (<span class="small">The reason why the
Heavenly Sovereign propounded this question was because it was his
intention <span id="fr_1868"></span>[1](#fn_1863.md) to make
Uji-no-waki-iratsuko rule the Empire</span>). Then His Augustness
Oho-yama-mori said: "The elder child is the dearer." Next His Augustness

feeling which made the Heavenly Sovereign deign to ask \[the question\],
said: "The elder child, having already become a man, gives no trouble;
but the younger child, not being yet a man, is the dearer." Then the
Heavenly Sovereign said: "My lord Sazaki's words agree with my
thoughts," and forthwith ordained the division \[of the inheritance\]
thus: His Augustness Oho-yama-mori to administer the government of the
mountains and the sea, <span id="fr_1869"></span>[2a](#fn_1864.md) His
Augustness Oho-sazaki to take and deign to report on the government of
the realm, <span id="fr_1870"></span>[3](#fn_1865.md) and Uji-no
waki-iratsuko to rule the succession of Heaven's sun. <span
id="fr_1871"></span>[4](#fn_1866.md) So His Augustness Oho-sazaki was not
disobedient to the Heavenly Sovereign's commands. <span
