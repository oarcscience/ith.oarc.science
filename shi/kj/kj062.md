### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1050"></span>[189:1a](kj062.htm#fr_1054.md) <span
id="page_189">p. 189</span> In the province of Yamato. *Taka-woka*
signifies "high mound." *Kadzuraki* means "pueraria castle," a name
accounted for by a legend in the "Chronicles," which relates how an
earth-spider was caught in this place by means of a net made of pueraria
tendrils. Kadzuraki was the name, not only of a town, but of a district.

<span id="fn_1051"></span>[189:2a](kj062.htm#fr_1055.md) *I.e.*, the
Princess of Kahamata, a place in Kahachi. The name signifies
"river-fork." For the omission in this and a few other places of the
words "daughter of," etc., which might be expected instead of
"ancestress," see Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXI, p. 4.

<span id="fn_1052"></span>[189:3a](kj062.htm#fr_1056.md) *Shiki na
agata-nushi*. Shiki is in Yamato. The signification of the name seems to
be "stone castle."

<span id="fn_1053"></span>[189:4](kj062.htm#fr_1057.md) *Shiki-tsu-hiko*
signifies "Prince of Shiki." Motowori believes Tamade to be in like
manner the name of a place, while he interprets mi as the common
abbreviation of the Honorific (?) *mimi*.

<span id="fn_1054"></span>[189:5](kj062.htm#fr_1058.md) A place in Yamato.
Motowori derives the name from *tsuki* modern *toki*), the "ibis," and
*ta*, "rice-field."
