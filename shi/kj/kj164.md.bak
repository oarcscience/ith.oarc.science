## \[SECT. CLVII.—EMPEROR YŪ-RIYAKU (PART VII.—ADVENTURE WITH A WILD BOAR).\]

Again once the Heavenly Sovereign made a progress up to the summit of
Mount Kadzuraki. <span id="fr_2333"></span>[1](#fn_2328.md) Then a large
\[wild\] boar ran out. When the Heavenly Sovereign forthwith shot the
boar with a whizzing barb, <span id="fr_2334"></span>[2](#fn_2329.md) the
boar, furious, came towards him roaring. <span
id="fr_2335"></span>[3](#fn_2330.md) So the Heavenly Sovereign, alarmed at
the roaring, climbed up to the top of an alder. Then he sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The branch of the alder-tree on the opportune mound which I climbed in
my flight on account of the terribleness of the roaring of the boar, of
the wounded boar, which our great lord who tranquilly carries on the
government had been pleased to shoot!" <span
id="fr_2336"></span>[4](#fn_2331.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2328"></span>[398:1](kj164.htm#fr_2333.md) <span
id="page_398">p. 398</span> See Sect. LV, Note 1.

<span id="fn_2329"></span>[398:2](kj164.htm#fr_2334.md) See Sect. XXIII,
Note, 7.

<span id="fn_2330"></span>[398:3](kj164.htm#fr_2335.md) This is the sense
attributed by the commentators to the obscure word *utaki*, which seems
to be only found written phonetically.

<span id="fn_2331"></span>[398:4](kj164.htm#fr_2336.md) Our author cannot
be right in attributing this Song to the Emperor, and we need not
hesitate to accept the different version of the story given in the
parallel passage of the "Chronicle," where the Monarch, as might be
expected from all the other details that have been preserved concerning
him, bravely faces the boar, while it is one of his attendants who runs
away and climbs a tree to be out of danger, and afterwards composes
these lines. This Song is a good instance of what Mr. Aston (in his
"Grammar of the Japanese Written Language," 2nd Edit., p. 194) has said
concerning some of the short poems of a later date: "These sentences are
not statements of fact; they merely picture to the mind a state of
things without making any assertion respecting it." Here we, as it were,
simply see the frightened courtier sitting breathless and terrified amid
the branches of the alder, and the whole verse has but the meaning of an
exclamation. The term *ari-wo* rendered "opportune mound." is the only
word in the text which raises any difficulties <span id="page_399">p.
399</span> of interpretation. Moribe's exegesis has here been followed.
According to the older view it signifies "barren mound." For the words
"our great lord who tranquilly carries on the government" see Sect CLVI,
Note 3.
