Princess Mimatsu, <span id="fr_1302"></span>[11](#fn_1298.md) daughter of
His Augustness Oho-biko, he begot august children: His Augustness

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1288"></span>[212:1](kj070.htm#fr_1292.md) <span
id="page_213">p. 213</span> In Yamato. *Shiki* probably signifies "stone
castle" (*ishi-ki*). *Midzugaki* signifies "fresh young hedge,"—an
Honorific designation of the hedge round the Emperor's abode, which
passed into a Proper Name.

<span id="fn_1289"></span>[212:2](kj070.htm#fr_1293.md) According to
Motowori's exegesis, this name is a rather remarkable instance of verbal
usage, *ayu-me* ("trout-eyes") being not properly part of the name at
all, but only a Pillow-Word for what follows, viz., *Me-kakushi-hime*,
*i.e.* "Princess Beautiful Eyes." *Tohotsu* is the name of a place in
the province of Ki, signifying "far harbour."

<span id="fn_1290"></span>[212:3](kj070.htm#fr_1294.md) *Arakaha* is the
name of a place in Ki, and signifies "rough (*i.e.* impetuous and
dangerous) river." The syllables *to-be* are of uncertain import.

<span id="fn_1291"></span>[212:4](kj070.htm#fr_1295.md) *Ki no kuni no
miyatsuko*.

<span id="fn_1292"></span>[212:5](kj070.htm#fr_1296.md) *Toyo* signifies
"luxuriant" and *biko* (*hiko*) "prince." The other elements of the
compound are obscure.

<span id="fn_1293"></span>[212:6](kj070.htm#fr_1297.md) <span
id="page_214">p. 214</span> *Bime* (*hime*) signifies "princess," and
*suki* is identified by Motowori with Shiki, the name of the residence
of the monarch whose daughter this princess was.

<span id="fn_1294"></span>[212:7](kj070.htm#fr_1298.md) *Oho-ama-hime*. Ama
is the name of a district in Wohari, and probably signifies "fisherman."

<span id="fn_1295"></span>[212:8](kj070.htm#fr_1299.md) *Wohari no
murazhi*.

<span id="fn_1296"></span>[212:9](kj070.htm#fr_1300.md) The signification
of this and the two following names is uncertain.

<span id="fn_1297"></span>[213:10](kj070.htm#fr_1301.md) *Towochi* is the
name of a district in Yamato.

<span id="fn_1298"></span>[213:11](kj070.htm#fr_1302.md) *Mimatsu-hime*.
Signification uncertain.

<span id="fn_1299"></span>[213:12](kj070.htm#fr_1303.md) Signification
uncertain.

<span id="fn_1300"></span>[213:13](kj070.htm#fr_1304.md) The syllables *ma*
and *waka*, literally "true and young" or "truly young "are honorific.
*Iza* is of doubtful signification.

<span id="fn_1301"></span>[213:14](kj070.htm#fr_1305.md) *Kuni-kata-hime*.
*Kuni* means "country," and *kata* here probably signifies "hard" or
"firm."

<span id="fn_1302"></span>[213:15](kj070.htm#fr_1306.md)
*Ohiji-tsuku-yamato-hime*. *Ohiji* probably means "a thousand," and
*Yamato* is the name of a province. *Tsuku* is obscure.

<span id="fn_1303"></span>[213:16](kj070.htm#fr_1307.md) *Iga-hime*. *Iga*
is the name of a district and of a province (see Sect. LVI, Note 9).

<span id="fn_1304"></span>[213:17](kj070.htm#fr_1308.md) *I.e.*, "Yamato
Prince."

<span id="fn_1305"></span>[213:18](kj070.htm#fr_1309.md) *Kami-tsu-ke-nu*
\[*no kimi*\]. The character <span id="img_21400"></span>
![](img/21400.jpg) (Dukes) is supplied by Motowori. This is the ancient
form of the name now pronounced *Kōdzuke* (*conf*. *Shimo-tsu-ke-nu*
corrupted to *Shimotsuke*). The author of the "Inquiry into the Meaning
of the Names of All the Provinces" draws attention to the curious fact
that, whereas the final syllable *nu* of the original word is dropped in
speaking, it is the *ke* which is dropped in writing—the original form
of the name, as written, being <span id="img_21401"></span>
![](img/21401.jpg), whereas now only the first two of these three
characters are used. Its signification is supposed to be "upper
vegetation-moor," *ke* (<span id="img_21402"></span> ![](img/21402.jpg))
being regarded as the Archaic general term for trees and grasses,
identical with *ke* that means "hairs," vegetation having struck the
early speakers of the language as being similar to the hairs on the
bodies of men and beasts.

<span id="fn_1306"></span>[213:19](kj070.htm#fr_1310.md) *Shimo-tsu-ke-nu
no kimi*. *Shimo* means "lower." For the rest of the name see preceding
Note. Both names are those of provinces in Eastern Japan.

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[213:20](kj070.htm#fr_1311.md) Or more literally,
"worshipped and celebrated the festivals at," etc.

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[213:21](kj070.htm#fr_1312.md) *Viz*., of the
Sun-Goddess (*Ama-terasu*).

<span id="fn_1309"></span>[213:22](kj070.htm#fr_1313.md) *Noto no omi*.
*Noto*, formerly a part of the province of Echizen, <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> is the name of the peninsula that juts out
into the Sea of Japan on the western coast of the Main Island. The
etymology of the name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1310"></span>[213:23](kj070.htm#fr_1314.md) The meaning of
this imperfectly formed sentence is: On the occasion of "the interment
of the next prince, His Augustness Yamato-hiko, the custom of setting a
row of the deceased prince's retainers round his grave and burying them
alive was first introduced." For a further notice of this custom see
Sect. LXXV, Note 4. According to the "Chronicles," the "ancient" custom
of burying retainers up to their necks in the neighbourhood of their
lord's grave was abolished after this very same interment. Motowori
endeavours to reconcile the two statements by supposing that the custom
was really an old one, but that on the occasion here mentioned the
number of victims was increased to an unprecedented degree, so that, as
related in the "Chronicles," their cries, while their heads were being
pulled to pieces by the crows and dogs, filled the Emperor with
commiseration.
