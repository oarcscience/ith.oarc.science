## \[SECT. CLXI.—EMPEROR YŪ-RIYAKU (PART XII.—SONGS BY THE EMPEROR AND PRINCESS WODO).\]

On the day of this copious feast the Heavenly Sovereign, when Princess
Wodo of Kasuga <span id="fr_2356"></span>[1](#fn_2351.md) presented to him
the great august liquor, sang again, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Oh! the grandee's daughter holding the excellent flagon! \[If\] thou
hold the excellent flagon, hold it firmly! Hold it quite firmly, more
and more firmly, child holding the excellent flagon." <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2](#fn_2352.md)

</div>

This is a Cup Song. <span id="fr_2358"></span>[3](#fn_2353.md) Then
Princess Wodo presented \[326\] a Song. That Song said:

"Would that I were \[thou,\] the lower board of the arm-rest whereon our
great lord who tranquilly carries on the government stands leaning at
morn, stands leaning at eve! Oh! mine elder brother!" <span
id="fr_2359"></span>[4](#fn_2354.md)

This is a Quiet Song.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2351"></span>[407:1](kj168.htm#fr_2356.md) *Kasuga no
Wodo-hime*. See Sect. CLIX. Note I.

<span id="fn_2352"></span>[407:2](kj168.htm#fr_2357.md) This Song is simply
a reiterated, and playful injunction to the maiden to hold firmly the
flagon containing the intoxicating liquor; and Motowori is, as Moribe
remarks, putting more into the words than they are really meant to
convey, when he says that they imply *praise* on the Monarch's part,—The
English words "grandee's daughter" represent the Japanese *omi no
omina*, a somewhat remarkable expression, which is interpreted by
Motowori to signify "attendant maiden." The translator prefers the view
propounded in Moribe's comment on this Song, and has therefore adopted
it. The expression is in the original preceded by the untranslatable
Pillow-Word *minasossoku* (Moribe reads the last syllable with the
*nigori*,—*gu*), The word rendered "excellent flagon" is *ho-dari*, the
first element of the compound being explained by the commentators in the
sense of "excellent," *i.e.*, "big," while the second is the same as the
modern word *taru*, "a cask." In ancient times, however, the
signification of *tari* or *taru* was that of a vessel to pour liquor
from, not <span id="page_408">p. 408</span> to store liquor in,—*i.e.*,
a flagon, not a cask. The words "quite firmly, more and more firmly"
represent the Japanese *shita-gataku ya-gataku* according to Moribe's
exegesis. Motowori's interpretation of them in the sense of "\[take
the\] bottom firmly and the top firmly" is less acceptable.

<span id="fn_2353"></span>[407:3](kj168.htm#fr_2358.md) Thus does the
editor of 1687, who is followed by Moribe, understand the original
expression *uki-uta*. Motowori's interpretation, "Floating Song," seems
less good.

<span id="fn_2354"></span>[407:4](kj168.htm#fr_2359.md) So enamoured is the
maiden of the Sovereign that she [would](errata.htm#108.md) fain be even
the board of the arm-rest on which he leans.—The expression "lower board
"is misleading, for it refers simply to the self-evident fact that the
board forming the top of the little low table used as an arm-rest by one
squatting on his mat is below the arm, as whose support it serves. The
words "stands leaning" must probably be understood to signify "sits" or
"squats leaning." The expression "our great lord who tranquilly carries
on the government" is a frequently recurring periphrasis for the word
"Emperor," and has been explained in Sect. LXXXVII, Note 4. The words
"at morn" and "at eve" are literally in the original "at morning doors"
and "at evening doors," the reference being to the fact that the doors
of a house are respectively opened and closed in the early morning and
at nightfall. The exclamation "Oh! mine elder brother" is addressed to
the board of the arm-rest. *Conf*. the first Song in Sect LXXXIX, where
Yamato-take apostrophizes a pine-tree in the same terms.
