## \[SECT. IX.—THE LAND OF HADES.\]

Thereupon \[His Augustness the Male Who-Invites\], wishing to meet and
see his younger sister Her Augustness the Female-Who-Invites, followed
after her to the Land of Hades. <span id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) So
when from the palace she raised the \[35\] door and came out to meet
him, <span id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_252.md) His Augustness the
Male-Who-Invites spoke, saying: "Thine Augustness my lovely younger
sister! the lands that I and thou made are not yet finished making; so
come back!" Then Her Augustness the Female-Who-Invites answered, saying:

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Lamentable indeed
that thou earnest not sooner! I have eaten of the furnace of
Hades. <span id="fr_254"></span>[3](#fn_253.md) Nevertheless, as I
reverence <span id="fr_255"></span>[4](#fn_254.md) the entry here of Thine
Augustness my lovely elder brother, I wish to return. <span
id="fr_256"></span>[5](#fn_255.md) Moreover <span
id="fr_257"></span>[6](#fn_256.md) I will discuss it particularly with the
Deities of Hades. <span id="fr_258"></span>[7](#fn_257.md) Look not at me!"
Having thus spoken, she went back inside the palace; and as she tarried
there very long, he could not wait. So having taken and broken off one
of the end-teeth <span id="fr_259"></span>[8](#fn_258.md) of the
multitudinous and close-toothed comb stuck in the august left bunch \[of
his hair\], he lit one light <span id="fr_260"></span>[9](#fn_259.md) and
went in and looked. Maggots were swarming. and \[she was\] rotting, and
in her head dwelt the Great-Thunder, \[36\] in her breast dwelt the
Fire-Thunder, in her left hand <span id="fr_261"></span>[10](#fn_260.md)
dwelt the Young-Thunder, in her right hand <span
id="fr_262"></span>[10](#fn_260.md) dwelt the Earth-Thunder, in her left
foot <span id="fr_263"></span>[11](#fn_261.md) dwelt the Rumbling-Thunder,
in her right foot <span id="fr_264"></span>[11](#fn_261.md) dwelt the
Couchant-Thunder:—altogether eight Thunder-Deities had been born and
dwelt there. <span id="fr_265"></span>[12](#fn_262.md) Hereupon His
Augustness the Male-Who-Invites, overawed at the sight, fled back,
whereupon his younger sister Her Augustness the Female-Who-Invites said:
"Thou hast put me to shame," and at once sent the
Ugly-Female-of-Hades <span id="fr_266"></span>[13](#fn_263.md) to pursue
him. So His Augustness the Male-Who-Invites took his black august
head-dress <span id="fr_267"></span>[14](#fn_264.md) and cast it down, and
it instantly turned into grapes. While she picked them up and ate them,
he fled on; but as she still pursued him, he took and broke the
multitudinous and close-toothed comb in the right bunch \[of his hair\]
and cast it down, and it instantly turned into bamboo-sprouts. While she
pulled them up and ate them, he fled on. Again later \[his Younger
sister\] sent the eight Thunder-Deities with a thousand and five hundred
warriors of Hades to pursue \[37\]

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

him. So he, drawing the ten-grasp sabre that was augustly girded on him,
fled forward brandishing it in his back hand; <span
id="fr_268"></span>[15](#fn_265.md) and as they still pursued, he took, on
reaching the base of the Even Pass of Hades, <span
id="fr_269"></span>[16](#fn_266.md) three peaches that were growing at its
base, and waited and smote \[his pursuers therewith\], so that they all
fled back. Then His Augustness the Male-Who-Invites announced to the
peaches: "Like as ye have helped me, so must ye help all living
people <span id="fr_270"></span>[17](#fn_267.md) in the Central Land of
Reed-Plains <span id="fr_271"></span>[18](#fn_268.md) when they shall fall
into troublous circumstances and be harassed!"—and he gave \[to the
peaches\] the designation of Their Augustnesses
Great-Divine-Fruit. <span id="fr_272"></span>[19](#fn_269.md) Last of all
his younger sister Her Augustness the Princess-Who-Invites came out
herself in pursuit. So he drew a thousand-draught rock, <span
id="fr_273"></span>[20](#fn_270.md) and \[with it\] blocked up the Even
Pass of Hades, and placed the rock in the middle; and they stood
opposite to one another and exchanged leave-takings; <span
id="fr_274"></span>[21](#fn_271.md) and Her Augustness the
Female-Who-Invites said: "My lovely elder brother, thine Augustness! If
thou do like this, I will in one day strangle to death a thousand of the
folks of thy land." Then His Augustness the Male-Who-Invites replied:
"My lovely younger sister, Thine Augustness! If *thou* do this, *I* will
in one day set up a thousand and five hundred parturition-houses. <span
id="fr_275"></span>[22](#fn_272.md) In this manner each day a thousand
people would surely be born." So Her Augustness the Female-Who-Invites
is called the Great-Deity-of-Hades. <span
id="fr_276"></span>[23](#fn_273.md) Again it is said that, owing to her
having pursued and reached \[her elder brother\], she is called the
Road-Reaching-Great-Deity. <span id="fr_277"></span>[24](#fn_274.md) Again
the rock with which he blocked up the Pass of Hades is called the
Great-Deity-of-the-Road-Turning-back, <span
id="fr_278"></span>[25](#fn_275.md)

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

and again it is called the
Blocking-Great-Deity-of-the-Door-of-Hades. <span
id="fr_279"></span>[26](#fn_276.md) So what was called the
Even-Pass-of-Hades is now called the Ifuya-Pass <span
id="fr_280"></span>[27](#fn_277.md) in the Land of Idzumo.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[38:1](kj016.htm#fr_252.md) <span id="page_41">p.
41</span> The characters in the original which are here rendered Hades
are <span id="img_04100"></span> ![](img/04100.jpg), lit. "Yellow
Stream," a Chinese name for the Underworld to which a remark of Mencius
and a story in the "*Tso Chuan*" appear to have given rise. They here
represent the Japanese word *Yomo* or *Yomi*, which we find phonetically
written with the characters <span id="img_04101"></span>
![](img/04101.jpg) in the name of *Yomo-tsu-shiko-me* a little further
on, and which is defined by Motowori as "an underworld,.... the
habitation of the dead,.... the land whither, when they die, go all men,
whether noble or mean, virtuous or wicked." The orthodox Japanese
derivation of *Yomi* is from *Yoru*, "night," which would give us for
*Yomo-tsu-kuni* some such rendering as "the Land of Gloom." A suggestion
quoted by Arawi Hakuseki ("*Tōga*," art. *Idzumi*) that the word may
really be but a mispronunciation of *Yama*, the Sanscrit name of the
Buddhist god of hell, is however worthy of consideration; but it seems
best on the whole to translate *Yomi* or *Yomo* by "Hades," a term which
is itself of uncertain derivation, and the signification attached to
which closely resembles the Japanese *Shintō* notion of the world
beyond, or rather beneath, the grave.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[38:2](kj016.htm#fr_253.md) The original text
<span id="img_04102"></span> ![](img/04102.jpg) seems to be corrupt, and
Motowori, unable to make anything of <span id="img_04103"></span>
![](img/04103.jpg) leaves <span id="img_04104"></span>
![](img/04104.jpg) without any Japanese reading (see the remarks in his
Commentary, Vol. VI. pp. 5-6). Mr. Aston, in the version of this passage
given in the Chrestomathy appended to his "Grammar of the Japanese
Written Language," follows Motowori in not translating <span
id="img_04105"></span> ![](img/04105.jpg), but does not allude to the
difficulty.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[39:3](kj016.htm#fr_254.md) *I.e.* "of the food of
Hades." It would be more obvious (following the text) to translate "I
have eaten in the doors \[*i.e.* in the house\] of Hades;—but the
character <span id="img_04106"></span> ![](img/04106.jpg) in this place
stands almost certainly for <span id="img_04107"></span>
![](img/04107.jpg), "a place for cooking," "a furnace."

<span id="fn_254"></span>[39:4](kj016.htm#fr_255.md) The word *kashikoshi*
(<span id="img_04108"></span> ![](img/04108.jpg)), here translated
"reverence," exactly corresponds to the modern polite idiom
*osore-iri-mashita*, for which there is no precise equivalent in
English, but which conveys some such sentiment as "I am overpowered by
the honour you do me," "I am sorry you should have taken the trouble."

<span id="fn_255"></span>[39:5](kj016.htm#fr_256.md) *Q.d.* "with thee to
the land of the living."

<span id="fn_256"></span>[39:6](kj016.htm#fr_257.md) <span id="page_42">p.
42</span>The original here has the character <span
id="img_04200"></span> ![](img/04200.jpg) which signifies "moreover" as
in this translation, and Motowori's proposed emendation to <span
id="img_04201"></span> ![](img/04201.jpg) has for it the authority of no
manuscript or earlier printed edition. In his "Records of Ancient
Matters with the Ancient Reading" he actually substitutes this very new
reading, accompanying it in *kana* with the Japanese words *ashita ni*,
"in the morning." But what is to become of the text if we are at liberty
to alter it to suit our convenience,—for there is more than one other
passage where <span id="img_04202"></span> ![](img/04202.jpg) is
similarly used?

<span id="fn_257"></span>[39:7](kj016.htm#fr_258.md) Yomo-tsu-kami. Both
Motowori and Hirata take the word "Deities" in the Plural, and the
translator therefore renders it in that number, though the Singular
would be at least equally suitable to the text as it stands. Of the
Deities of Hades little or nothing is known. Conf. Note 23 to this
Section.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[39:8](kj016.htm#fr_259.md) Literally "the male
pillar," *i.e.* the large tooth of which there is one at each end of the
comb.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[39:9](kj016.htm#fr_260.md) The use of the
expression "lit *one* light," where it would have been more natural to
say simply "lit \[a\] light," is explained by a gloss in the
"Chronicles," which informs us that "at the present day" the lighting of
a single light is considered unlucky, as is also the throwing away of a
comb at night-time. It is allowed that the gloss is a late addition, and
its statement might perhaps be considered a mere invention made to
account for the peculiar expression in the text. Motowori tells us
however that "it is said by the natives" that these actions are still
(latter part of 18th century) considered unlucky in the province of
Ihami, and the same superstition also survives, as the translator is
assured, in Yedo itself. It is to be understood that it was the large
tooth broken off from the comb which the god lighted.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[39:10](kj016.htm#fr_262.md) Or "arm."

<span id="fn_261"></span>[39:11](kj016.htm#fr_264.md) Or "leg."

<span id="fn_262"></span>[39:12](kj016.htm#fr_265.md) The Japanese names of
the eight Thunder-Deities are: *Oho-ikadzuchi*, *Ho-no-ikadzuchi*,
*Kuro-ikadzuchi*, *Saka-ikadzuchi*, *Waki-ikadzuchi*,
*Tsuchi-ikadzuchi*, *Naru-ikadzuchi*, and *Fushi-ikadzuchi*. Moribe in
his Critique on Motowori's Commentary, has some observation on the
appropriateness of each of these names which the student will do well to
consult if the work should be published.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[39:13](kj016.htm#fr_266.md) *Yomo-tsu-shiko-me*.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[39:14](kj016.htm#fr_267.md) We might perhaps with
equal propriety render by "wreath" the word here translated head-
dress,—leaves and flowers having been the earliest ornaments for the
hair. In later time, however, it has been used <span id="page_43">p.
43</span> to designate any sort of head-dress, and that is also the
dictionary meaning of the Chinese character with which it is written.
The Japanese words for "head-dress" and "creeper" are homonymous, and
indeed the former is probably but a specialised acceptation of the
latter.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[40:15](kj016.htm#fr_268.md) *I.e.*, brandishing
it behind him.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[40:16](kj016.htm#fr_269.md) Or Flat Hill of
Hades, *Yomo-tsu-hira-saka*, said by Motowori to form the frontier-line
between Hades and the World of the Living. See also Note 27 to this
Section.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[40:17](kj016.htm#fr_270.md) The three characters
<span id="img_04300"></span> ![](img/04300.jpg) here rendered "people"
are evidently (Motowori notwithstanding) meant to be equivalent to the
common Chinese expression <span id="img_04301"></span>
![](img/04301.jpg), which has that signification. The word translated
"living" means literally "present," "visible."

<span id="fn_268"></span>[40:18](kj016.htm#fr_271.md)
*Ashi-hara-no-naka-tsu-kuni*, a common periphrastic designation of
Japan. It is better to translate the name thus than to render it by "the
Land in the Middle of the Reed-Plains," a forced interpretation which
Motowori and Hirata would only seem to adopt in order to veil the fact
that one of the most ancient and revered names of their native land was
imitated from that of China.—everything Chinese being an abomination in
the sight of these ardent Shintoists. Yamazaki Suiga, as quoted by.
Tanigaha Shisei, is more sensible when he remarks that each country
naturally considers itself central and foreign countries barbarous and
that Japan is not peculiar in being looked on by its inhabitants as the
centre of the universe. This is also the view taken by the other earlier
scholars.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[40:19](kj016.htm#fr_272.md)
*Oho-kamu-dzumi-no-mikoto*. The difference between Singular and Plural
is not often present to the Japanese mind, and though there were three
peaches, we might just as well render their name by the words "His
Augustness, etc.," considering the three as forming together but one
divinity. The interpretation of the name here adopted is the simple and
natural one which Motowori borrowed from Tanigaha Shisei.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[40:20](kj016.htm#fr_273.md) *I.e.*, a rock which
it would take a thousand men to lift.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[40:21](kj016.htm#fr_274.md) That some kind of
leave-taking and separation is intended seems certain; but the precise
import of the characters <span id="img_04302"></span> ![](img/04302.jpg)
in the text is not to be ascertained. Motowori's "Commentary, Vol. VI,
pp. 29-30 and Vol. X, pp. 52-55, should be consulted for an elaborate
discussion of the various interpretations which they may be made to
bear. Moribe, in his Critique on this Commentary, argues that "divorced
each other" is the proper signification of the words, and supports his
opinion by the Parallel passage of the "Chronicles."

<span id="fn_272"></span>[40:22](kj016.htm#fr_275.md) <span id="page_44">p.
44</span> *I.e.*, "I will cause fifteen hundred women to bear children."
For the custom of erecting a separate hut for a woman about to be
delivered see Introduction, [p. xxviii](kj004.htm#page_xxviii)..md)

<span id="fn_273"></span>[40:23](kj016.htm#fr_276.md) *Yomo-tsu-oho-kami*.
On this rather embarrassing statement Motowori is silent, and Hirata
simply says: "It must be supposed that the 'Deities of Hades' previously
mentioned had been its 'Great Deities' up to this time, a position which
was henceforward assumed by Her Augustness Izana-mi (the
Female-Who-Invites"). Conf. Note 7 to this Section.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[40:24](kj016.htm#fr_277.md)
*Chi-shiki-no-oho-kami*. \[This is Motowori's reading. We might also
read *Michi-shiki-no-oho-kami*\]. Motowori conclusively proves that
"reaching" is the signification of the word *shiki* which is here so
translated. That it was already obscure at the time of the compilation
of these "Records" is however shown by the fact that it is written
syllabically in the first instance, and with a "borrowed character"
(*i.e.*, a homonymous word) in the second.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[40:25](kj016.htm#fr_278.md) Because the goddess
was turned back by it on the road where she was pursuing her
brother-husband. The original is *Chi-gaheshi* \[or
*Michi-gaheshi*\]*-no-oho-kami*.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[41:26](kj016.htm#fr_279.md)
*Sayari-masu-yomi-do-no-oho-kami*.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[41:27](kj016.htm#fr_280.md) *Ifuya-zaka*. Moribe
in his "*Idzu-no-chi-waki*" conjectures that Ifuya may be derived from
*Yufu-yami*, "evening darkness," an etymology which has at least the
merit of suiting the legend.
