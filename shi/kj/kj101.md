## \[SECT. XCIV.—EMPEROR SEI-MU.\]

The Heavenly Sovereign Wata-tarashi-hiko dwelt at the palace of
Taka-anaho at Shiga <span id="fr_1713"></span>[1b](#fn_1708.md) in
Chika-tsu-Afumi and ruled the empire. This Heavenly Sovereign wedded
\[227\] the Lady Oho-takara, <span id="fr_1714"></span>[2](#fn_1709.md)
daughter of Take-oshiyama-tari-ne, <span
id="fr_1715"></span>[3](#fn_1710.md) ancestor of the Grandees of
Hodzumi, <span id="fr_1716"></span>[4](#fn_1711.md) and begot an august
child: King Wata-nuke <span id="fr_1717"></span>[5](#fn_1712.md) (one
Deity). So \[the

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1708"></span>[281:1b](kj101.htm#fr_1713.md) *Shiga no
Taka-anaho*. *Shiga* is the name of a well known district, and is of
uncertain, signification, as is also *Taka-anaho*. For *Chika-tsu-Afumi*
see Sect. XXIX, Note 20.

<span id="fn_1709"></span>[281:2](kj101.htm#fr_1714.md) *Oto-takara no
iratsume*. *Oto* signifies "younger \[sister\]," and *takara* is
"treasure."

<span id="fn_1710"></span>[281:3](kj101.htm#fr_1715.md) *Oshiyama* is the
name of a place in Ise, *take* signifies "brave" and *tari* and *ne* are
Honorifics of frequent occurrence.

<span id="fn_1711"></span>[281:4](kj101.htm#fr_1716.md) *Hodzumi no omi*.
See Sect. LXI, Note 4.

<span id="fn_1712"></span>[281:5](kj101.htm#fr_1717.md) *Waka-nuke no
miko*. This name is of doubtful signification, and Motowori suspects
that it is corrupt, and that the true reading would be *Waka-take*,
"young-brave."

<span id="fn_1713"></span>[282:6](kj101.htm#fr_1718.md) See Sect. LXI, Note
25.

<span id="fn_1714"></span>[282:7](kj101.htm#fr_1719.md) <span
id="img_28200"></span> ![](img/28200.jpg). Motowori tries to prove that
in the earliest times this official title was simply an Honorific
surname formed by prefixing the Adjective <span id="img_28201"></span>
![](img/28201.jpg) "great" to <span id="img_28202"></span>
![](img/28202.jpg), a surname read "Omi" (the character signifies
properly "attendant," "subject.") Probably like other "gentile names" it
combined both characters, and had a tendency to become hereditary.

<span id="fn_1715"></span>[282:8](kj101.htm#fr_1720.md) *Oho-kuni wo-kuni
no kuni no miyatsuko*.

<span id="fn_1716"></span>[282:9](kj101.htm#fr_1721.md) *Oho-agata wo-agata
no agata nushi* (<span id="img_28203"></span> ![](img/28203.jpg)). Their
duties are supposed to have consisted in supervising the government
farms.

<span id="fn_1717"></span>[282:10](kj101.htm#fr_1722.md) For *Saki* see
Sect. LXXV, Note 5. *Tatanami* may perhaps signify "putting shields in a
row."
