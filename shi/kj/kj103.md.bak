## \[SECT. XCVI. EMPEROR CHIŪ-AI (PART II.—THE POSSESSION OF KOREA DIVINELY PROMISED).\]

This Empress, Her Augustness Princess Okinaga-tarashi, was at that
time, <span id="fr_1734"></span>[1](#fn_1729.md) divinely possessed. So
when the Heavenly Sovereign, dwelling at the palace of Kashihi in
Tsukushi, was about to smite the Land of Kumaso, <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[2](#fn_1730.md) the Heavenly Sovereign played on his
august lute, and the Prime [Minster](errata.htm#62.md) the Noble Take-uchi,
being in the pure court, <span id="fr_1736"></span>[3](#fn_1731.md)
requested the divine orders. Hereupon the Empress, divinely possessed,
charged him with this instruction and counsel: "There is a land to the
Westward,

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

and in that land is abundance of various treasures dazzling to the eye,
from gold and silver downwards. <span id="fr_1737"></span>[4](#fn_1732.md)
I will now bestow this land upon thee." Then the Heavenly Sovereign
replied, saying: "If one ascend to a high place and look Westward, no
country is to be seen. There is only the great sea;" and saying, <span
id="fr_1738"></span>[5](#fn_1733.md) "They are lying Deities," <span
id="fr_1739"></span>[6](#fn_1734.md) he pushed away his august lute, did
not play on it, and sat silent. Then the Deities were very angry, and
said: "Altogether as for this empire, it is not a land over which thou
oughtest to rule. Do thou go to the one road!" <span
id="fr_1740"></span>[7](#fn_1735.md) Hereupon the Prince Minister the Noble
Take-uchi said; "\[I am filled with\] awe, my Heavenly Sovereign! <span
id="fr_1741"></span>[8](#fn_1736.md) Continue playing thy great \[230\]
august lute." Then he slowly drew his august lute to him, and languidly
played on it. So almost immediately the sound of the august lute became
inaudible. On their forthwith lifting a light and looking, \[the
Heavenly Sovereign\] was dead.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1729"></span>[284:1](kj103.htm#fr_1734.md) At what time, we
are not told.

<span id="fn_1730"></span>[284:2](kj103.htm#fr_1735.md) See Sect. V, Note
17.

<span id="fn_1731"></span>[284:3](kj103.htm#fr_1736.md) This is Motowori's
interpretation of the obscure original word *sa-niha*, which is written
phonetically. He supposes it to have [been](errata.htm#63.md) so called as
being a place used for enquiring the will of the gods, and therefore
kept clean and held in reverence. "Place" would perhaps represent the
Japanese word *niha* as well as "court," though "court" has been its
usual acceptation in later times.

<span id="fn_1732"></span>[285:4](kj103.htm#fr_1737.md) Literally, "making
gold and silver the origin."

<span id="fn_1733"></span>[285:5](kj103.htm#fr_1738.md) Motowori tells us
to understand "saying "in the sense of "thinking."

<span id="fn_1734"></span>[285:6](kj103.htm#fr_1739.md) As already
frequently remarked, the Japanese mind does not occupy itself much with
the distinction (to us all-important) of Singular and Plural. The reason
why the translator renders the word *kami* by the Plural "Deities"
throughout this passage is because we learn later on that four divine
personages were intended by the author.

<span id="fn_1735"></span>[285:7](kj103.htm#fr_1740.md) <span
id="page_286">p. 286</span> With the commentators we must accept this as
an alternative name of Hades, without being able satisfactorily to
explain it. The expression "eighty road-windings" (*yaso kumado*) in
Sect. XXXII (Note 27) may be compared with this one.

<span id="fn_1736"></span>[285:8](kj103.htm#fr_1741.md) *I.e.*, "I tremble
Sire, for the consequences of thine impiety."
