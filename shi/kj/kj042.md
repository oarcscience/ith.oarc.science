## \[SECT. XXXV.—THE DUCHESS OF SARU.\]

So then he charged Her Augustness the Heavenly-Alarming-Female
\[saying\]: "Do thou, who wast the one to make known this Great Deity
Prince of Saruta who respectfully served as my august vanguard, <span
id="fr_768"></span>[1](#fn_764) respectfully escort him \[back\]; and do
thou likewise bear the august name of that Deity, and respectfully serve
me." Wherefore the Duchesses of Saru bear the name of the Male Deity the
Prince of Saruta, and the women are Duchesses of Saru. <span

<span id="fn_765"></span>[138:2](kj042.htm#fr_769) *Q.d.*, instead of
the men being Dukes, as would be more natural. The title was confined to
females (see Sect. XXXIII. Note 33).
