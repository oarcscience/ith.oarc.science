## \[SECT. CXXVII.—EMPEROR NIN-TOKU (PART VIII.—QUEEN MEDORI'S ARMLET).\]

Chief Ohotate of Yamabe, <span id="fr_2117"></span>[1](#fn_2112.md) who was
the generalissimo of that army, took the jewelled armlet which was wound
round Queen Medori's august arm, and gave it to his own wife. After this
time, when a copious feast <span id="fr_2118"></span>[2](#fn_2113.md) was
to be held, the women of the various families all went to court. Then
the wife of Chief Ohotate came with that Queen's jewelled armlet wound
round her own arm. \[283\] Thereupon the Empress, Her Augustness
Iha-no-hime, herself took the oak-leaves <span
id="fr_2119"></span>[3](#fn_2114.md) \[full\] of great august liquor and
graciously gave them to the women of the various families. Then the
Empress, recognizing the jewelled armlet, gave \[the wearer\] no
oak-leaf\[-full\] of great august liquor, but forthwith sent her
away; <span id="fr_2120"></span>[4](#fn_2115.md) and sending. for the
husband, Chief Ohotate, said: "Owing to that King and Queen's
impropriety, \[the Emperor\] deigned to send them away. This was nothing
strange. And a slave such as thou despoils of the jewelled armlet that
was wound round her august arm the body of his lady \[that was still\]
warm, and gives it to his own wife!"—and forthwith he was condemned to
death. <span id="fr_2121"></span>[5](#fn_2116.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2112"></span>[352:1](kj134.htm#fr_2117.md) <span
id="page_352">p. 352</span> *Yamabe no Ohotate no murazhi*. The "gentile
name" was *Yamabe no murazhi*, and the personal name *Ohotate*, though
the confused wording of this passage does not make it appear so.
*Yama-be* signifies mountain (*i.e.*, hunters') tribe. *Oho-tate* is
"big shield."

<span id="fn_2113"></span>[352:2](kj134.htm#fr_2118.md) See Sect. CVII,
Note 7.

<span id="fn_2114"></span>[352:3](kj134.htm#fr_2119.md) Or, perhaps rather
"aralia-leaves" (Con/. Sect. CXXIII).

<span id="fn_2115"></span>[352:4](kj134.htm#fr_2120.md) Or, "had her
dragged away."

<span id="fn_2116"></span>[352:5](kj134.htm#fr_2121.md) Literally, "was
granted the punishment of death," or "(the Emperor) deigned to condemn
him to death.
