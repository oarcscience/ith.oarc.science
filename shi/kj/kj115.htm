<P><A NAME="fn_1888"></A><A HREF="kj115.htm#fr_1893">311:1</A> <a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="green">p. 312</font></A> Yeshinu is the modern Yoshino, in the province of Yamato (see Sect. XLVI, Note 3). For the title of <i>kudzu</i> see Sect. XLVI, Note 13, where it also occurs in connection with Yeshinu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1889"></A><A HREF="kj115.htm#fr_1894">311:2</A> According to Moribe, whose interpretation seems best to the translator. the signification of this difficult poem is: "The sword worn by Prince Oho-sazaki, son of the Emperor Homuda (O-jin) is double-edged at its upper part, and like glistening ice towards its point;&#8212;oh! &#8217;tis like the icicles on the plants that cluster about the trunks of the dead trees in winter!" Almost every line, however (excepting those giving the name and title of the Prince), is a subject of controversy, and the "<i>G&#333;-Gan Sh&#333;</i>" <i>in loco</i> and Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXXIII, pp. 2-5, should be consulted for Keichi&#363;'s, Mabuchi's and Motowori's views on the disputed point.&#8212;The expression "solar august child" signifies "sun-descended prince," in allusion to the supposed descent of the Japanese monarchs from the Sun-Goddess.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1890"></A><A HREF="kj115.htm#fr_1895">311:3</A> <i>Yoko-usu</i> or <i>yokusu</i> (<A NAME="img_31200"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/31200.jpg">). It is not plain what sort of mortar the author intended to designate by this term. Motowori supposes it to mean a broad flat mortar in contradistinction to a high and narrow one. <A HREF="errata.htm#76">Keichi&#363;'s</A> view, which he quotes, to the effect that it was a mortar that had been carved out of the, block against the grain of the wood, seems an equally good guess, where all is guess-work.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1891"></A><A HREF="kj115.htm#fr_1896">311:4</A> In the Song this same name is read <i>Kashinofu</i>; but the commentators tell us that the Genitive Particle <i>no</i> ("of") is simply inserted for the sake of rhythm, and it is not unlikely that they are right. The name seems to signify "[a place where] oak-trees grow."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1892"></A><A HREF="kj115.htm#fr_1897">311:5</A> See Sect. XVIII, Note 16. The character <A NAME="img_31201"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/31201.jpg">, rendered by "distil" or "brew," according to the view which one may take of the resulting liquor, would seem to be here used in the sense of "to pound."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1893"></A><A HREF="kj115.htm#fr_1898">311:6</A> In this simple Song the Territorial Owners of Yoshino beg the Monarch to deign to partake of the sake which they have made.</P>
