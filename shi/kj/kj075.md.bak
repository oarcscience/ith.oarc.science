### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1374"></span>[225:1a](kj075.htm#fr_1378.md) This place, where
the Emperor Kei-ko is likewise said to have been interred, was in the
province of Yamato, and the road mentioned is supposed by Motowori to
have been the highway from Hatsuse into the province of Yamashiro. The
word Yamanobe signifies "in the neighbourhood of the mountain" (*yama no
he*).
