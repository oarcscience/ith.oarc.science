### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2035"></span>[334:1](kj127.htm#fr_2040.md) <span
id="page_335">p. 335</span> *Kadzuraki be*. For Kadzuraki see Sect. LV,
Note 1.

<span id="fn_2036"></span>[335:2](kj127.htm#fr_2041.md) *Mibu-be*. Motowori
quotes approvingly a derivation of the "gentile name" of Mibu from
*Bi-fuku-mon* (<span id="img_33500"></span> ![](img/33500.jpg)), the
name of a gate which the first bearer of the name is related to have
constructed. Taking into account the letter-changes which occurred in
older times in the passage of words from Chinese into Japanese, the
etymology is plausible enough.

<span id="fn_2037"></span>[335:3](kj127.htm#fr_2042.md) *Tajihi-be*. Tajihi
is the name of a place in Kahachi, and is of uncertain origin.

<span id="fn_2038"></span>[335:4](kj127.htm#fr_2043.md) *Oho-kusaka-be*.
This tribe of course took its name simply from that of Prince
Oho-kusaka.

<span id="fn_2039"></span>[335:5](kj127.htm#fr_2044.md) *Waka-kusaka-be*. A
similar observation to that in the last applies to this name.

<span id="fn_2040"></span>[335:6](kj127.htm#fr_2045.md) See Sect. LIII,
Note I.

<span id="fn_2041"></span>[335:7](kj127.htm#fr_2046.md) *Wani no ike*, in
the province of Kahachi. *Wani* signifies "crocodile," and it was also
the name of the Korean personage mentioned in Sect. CX (Note 6). But the
reason why the Pool here spoken of was so called does net appear. The
Pool of Yosami has already been mentioned in Sect. LXII (Note 85).
Motowori supposes that it must have dried up during the interim.

<span id="fn_2042"></span>[335:8](kj127.htm#fr_2047.md) *Naniha no
hori-ye*. Motowori tells us that the regularization of <span
id="page_336">p. 336</span> the channels of the Yodo and Yamato Rivers,
whose mouths nearly meet at this point with various intersecting
branches, is what is here intended to be referred to.

<span id="fn_2043"></span>[335:9](kj127.htm#fr_2048.md) *Wobashi no ye*.
*Wo-bashi* ("little bridge") is the name of a village in the province of
Settsu.

<span id="fn_2044"></span>[335:10](kj127.htm#fr_2049.md) *Suminoye no tsu*.
Close of Naniha; it is the modern *Sumiyoshi*. Conf. Sect. X, Note 22.
