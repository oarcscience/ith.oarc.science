## \[SECT. CXXIV.—EMPEROR NIN-TOKU (PART VI.—HE FOLLOWS THE EMPRESS INTO YAMASHIRO).\]

The Heavenly Sovereign, having heard that the Empress had made a
progress up by Yamashiro, made a person,—a retainer called by the name
of Toriyama, <span id="fr_2085"></span>[1](#fn_2080.md)—give an august
Song, <span id="fr_2086"></span>[2](#fn_2081.md) which said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Reach \[her\] in Yamashiro, Toriyama! Reach \[her\]! reach \[her\]! Ah!
wilt thou reach and meet my beloved spouse?" <span
id="fr_2087"></span>[3](#fn_2082.md)

</div>

Again he continued by despatching Kuchiko, Grandee of Wani, <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[4](#fn_2083.md) and sang, saying: \[277\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Wilt thou be without thinking even of the Heart that is in the moor of
Ohowiko, the moor of Ohowiko, that is by Takaki at Mimoro?" <span
id="fr_2089"></span>[5](#fn_2084.md)

</div>

Again he sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"If indeed I had pillowed \[my head\] on the white arm like the
whiteness of the roots, the great roots, that were beaten with wooden
hoes by the women of Yamashiro where the seedlings grow in succession,
\[then\] mightest thou say, 'I know \[thee\] not'." <span
id="fr_2090"></span>[6](#fn_2085.md)

</div>

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

So when the Grandee of Kuchiko was repeating this \[278\] august Song
\[to the Empress,\] it was raining heavily. Then upon his, without
avoiding the rain, coming and prostrating himself at the front door of
the palace, <span id="fr_2091"></span>[7](#fn_2086.md) she on the contrary
went out at the back door; and on his coming and prostrating himself at
the back door of the palace, she on the contrary went out at the front
door. Then, as he crept backwards and forwards on his knees in the
middle of the court, the streams of water <span
id="fr_2092"></span>[8](#fn_2087.md) reached to his loins. Owing to the
grandee being clad in a garment dyed <span
id="fr_2093"></span>[9](#fn_2088.md) green and with a red cord, the streams
of water brushed against the red cord, and the green all changed to red
colour. Now the Grandee of Kuchiko's younger sister Princess Kuchi <span
id="fr_2094"></span>[10](#fn_2089.md) was in the service of the
Empress. <span id="fr_2095"></span>[11](#fn_2090.md) So Princess Kuchi sang
saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Oh! how tearful is my lord-elder brother, saying things in the palace
of Tsutsuki in Yamashiro!" <span id="fr_2096"></span>[12](#fn_2091.md)

</div>

Then when the Empress asked the reason, <span
id="fr_2097"></span>[13](#fn_2092.md) she replied, saying: "He is my
brother the Grandee of Kuchiko." Thereupon the Grandee of Kuchiko and
also his younger sister Princess Kuchi and likewise Nurinomi \[all\]
three took counsel \[together,\] and sent to report to the Heavenly
\[279\] Sovereign, saying: "The reason of the Empress's progress is that
there are \[some\] insects reared by Nurinomi,—strange insects changing
in three ways, <span id="fr_2098"></span>[14](#fn_2093.md) once becoming
creeping insects, once becoming cocoons, <span
id="fr_2099"></span>[15](#fn_2094.md) and once becoming flying birds <span
id="fr_2100"></span>[16](#fn_2095.md)—and it is only to go and look at them
that she has entered into \[Nurinomi's house.\] She has no strange
intentions." <span id="fr_2101"></span>[17](#fn_2096.md) When they had thus
reported, the Heavenly Sovereign said: "That being so, I want to go and
see \[these insects,\] as

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I think \[they
must be\] strange; \[and with these words\] he made a progress up from
the great palace. When he entered into Nurinomi's house, Nurinomi, had
already presented to the Empress the three-fold insects reared by him.
Then the Heavenly Sovereign augustly stood at the door of the palace
where the Empress-dwelt, and sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Pure as the great roots that were beaten with their wooden hoes by the
women of Yamashiro where the seedings grow in succession:—it is because
thou spokest tumultuously that I come in here \[with my retainers
numerous\] as the more and more flourishing trees that I look across
at." <span id="fr_2102"></span>[18](#fn_2097.md)

</div>

\[280\] These six Songs by the Heavenly Sovereign and by the Empress are
Changing Songs which are Quiet Songs. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2080"></span>[344:1](kj131.htm#fr_2085.md) <span
id="page_346">p. 346</span> This name signifies "bird-mountain." The
commentators presume that it contains an allusion to the fact of its
bearer being an Imperial courier.

<span id="fn_2081"></span>[344:2](kj131.htm#fr_2086.md) This is the actual
sense conveyed by the original <span id="img_34600"></span>
![](img/34600.jpg), and we naturally infer that Toriyama was made the
bearer to the Empress of the following Song. The Song itself, however,
is addressed not to her, but to Toriyama on his departure. On the other
hand, the two poems which follow are evidently for the Empress, and it
is impossible to suppose that the first messenger was not likewise
intended to convey to her some poetic missive. All that we can do is to
render the text as it stands, and to suppose it corrupt.

<span id="fn_2082"></span>[344:3](kj131.htm#fr_2087.md) The meaning of this
Song is: "O Toriyama! pursue her into Yamashiro! I tremble at the
thought of the possibility of thy not finding her."

<span id="fn_2083"></span>[344:4](kj131.htm#fr_2088.md) *Wani no omi
Kuchiko* (further on he is mentioned as *Kuchiko no omi*, *i.e.*, "the
Grandee (of) Kuchiko.") *Kuchi-ko* may be interpreted <span
id="page_347">p. 347</span> to mean "mouth child" and Moribe thinks that
this personage was so called on account of the verbal messages of which
he was made the bearer. The translator would prefer to consider *ko* as
an abbreviation of *hiko*, "prince," especially as the sister's name is
*Kuchi-hime*, where the word hime must mean "princess."

<span id="fn_2084"></span>[344:5](kj131.htm#fr_2089.md) This Song is so
obscure that Motowori and Moribe differ completely as to its
interpretation. The translator has followed Moribe, though by no means
persuaded that the latter has hit on the proper signification. According
to this view, the Emperor makes a pun on the word "heart," which is
supposed to have been the name of a pool situated on the moor of Ohowiko
near Takaki at Mimoro,—all names of places with which the Empress was
familiar,—and reproaches her for having no thought of his heart which
beats so lovingly for her. Motowori, on the other hand, thinks that the
poem proper consists only of its last two lines (in the English
translation they necessarily I come first): "Wilt thou be without
thinking even of the heart?"—and that all the rest is a "Preface "to the
Pillow-Word *kimo-mukafu* by which the word *kokoro*, "heart," is
preceded. As for *oho-wi-ko* and *takaki*, they are taken, not as names
of places, but as common Nouns. According to this view of the structure
of the Song, it ceases (with the exception of its last two lines) to
have any rational signification, and it is needless to attempt to
translate it for the English reader. Persons familiar with Japanese are
therefore referred to Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXXVI, pp. 34-36.

<span id="fn_2085"></span>[344:6](kj131.htm#fr_2090.md) The meaning of this
Song is: "If thou and I had not so long been spouses, then indeed
mightest thou break with me, and declare that thou knowest me not. But
how canst thou so far forget our wedded life as to desert me now?"-"The
"great root," *oho-ne*, is the modern *dai-kon* (Raphanus sativus), a
kind of radish which is a favourite vegetable with the Japanese and is
distinguished by its brilliantly white appearance. "Beaten" here
signifies "dug up." The use of the Past Tense is curious. *Ko-guha*,
here in accordance with Motowori's view rendered "wooden hoes," is
interpreted by Moribe to mean "little hoes." "Where the seedlings grow
in succession "is the English rendering of *tsugi-ne fu*, the
Pillow-Word for Yamashiro (see Sect. CXXIII Note 11).

<span id="fn_2086"></span>[345:7](kj131.htm#fr_2091.md) The Empress was
lodging with a private individual, but her presence warrants the
application of the term "palace "to his house.

<span id="fn_2087"></span>[345:8](kj131.htm#fr_2092.md) It was raining too
hard for the water to stop on the surface in the shape of puddles, so it
streamed off in little rivulets.

<span id="fn_2088"></span>[345:9](kj131.htm#fr_2093.md) Literally,
"rubbed." See Introduction [p. xxx](kj004.htm#page_xxx.md). Instead of
"'green," <span id="page_348">p. 348</span> we might equally well
translate by "blue." The garment intended must be the upper garment or
coat.

<span id="fn_2089"></span>[345:10](kj131.htm#fr_2094.md) *Kuchi-hime*.

<span id="fn_2090"></span>[345:11](kj131.htm#fr_2095.md) Literally,
"respectfully served the Empress."

<span id="fn_2091"></span>[345:12](kj131.htm#fr_2096.md) The meaning of
these lines, which can only be called poetry because they are in metre,
is plain: in them the speaker draws the Empress's attention to the
pitiful condition of the messenger who is doing his best to deliver to
her the Emperor's message. Probably the reading in our text has been
corrupted; for that in the "Chronicles," which may be translated thus;
"Oh! how tearful am I when I see my lord elder brother," etc. is much
preferable.

<span id="fn_2092"></span>[345:13](kj131.htm#fr_2097.md) *Scil*. of her
attendant thus taking the messenger's part.

<span id="fn_2093"></span>[345:14](kj131.htm#fr_2098.md) Literally,
"colours."

<span id="fn_2094"></span>[345:15](kj131.htm#fr_2099.md) This is Motowori's
conjectural restoration of the reading of this word, which in all the
texts is hopelessly corrupt.

<span id="fn_2095"></span>[345:16](kj131.htm#fr_2100.md) According to
another reading, "flying insects."

<span id="fn_2096"></span>[345:17](kj131.htm#fr_2101.md) *I.e.*, "she is
not meditating any evil conduct."

<span id="fn_2097"></span>[346:18](kj131.htm#fr_2102.md) The Song consists
of two divisions, the first of which is but a Preface for the second,
the pivot being formed by the word *sawa-sawa-ni*, which has the meaning
of "pure" "cool," or "refreshing," with reference to what precedes it,
and the meaning of "tumultuously" (*sawasawa ni*—*sawagaskiku*) when
taken together with what follows. The difficulties which present
themselves in the first division have all been explained in Note 11 to
the last [and](errata.htm#85.md) Note 6 to the present Section. The general
sense of the second division is plain enough; but the precise
application of the comparison to the "more and more flourishing tree" is
obscure. Motowori's view has been adopted by the translator, and the
words in brackets supplemented accordingly. Moribe prefers to consider
that the reference is to the repeated visits first of the Emperor's
messengers and afterwards of the Emperor himself The words "look across
at" must be explained by supposing that the trees were in the
neighbourhood of Nurinomi's house; they were shoots springing up from
roots that had been cut down close to the ground.

<span id="fn_2098"></span>[346:19](kj131.htm#fr_2103.md) The commentators
thus explain these obscure expressions: "A Quiet Song is one which is
sung to a tranquil tune. A Changing Song is one temporarily sung while
the tone (mode?) is changing." The six Songs in question must be
supposed to have combined both characteristics.
