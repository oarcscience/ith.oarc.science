### Footnotes

<span id="fn_863"></span>[158:1](kj050.htm#fr_867.md) <span
id="page_158">p. 158</span> *Itsu-se-no-mikoto*. The "reaches" are the
reaches of a river: at least this seems the most natural view to take of
the meaning of the name. Motowori and Moribe, however, consider it to be
a corruption of *idzu-shine*, to which they assign the signification of
"powerful rice." <span id="page_159">p. 159</span> Excepting for the
fact of its bringing this name into harmony with the three that follow,
and which all relate to food, there seems little to recommend so
far-fetched a derivation.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[158:2](kj050.htm#fr_868.md) *Inu-hi-na-mikoto*.
If Motowori's [derivation](errata.htm#24.md) of the name from *ina-ihi* is
correct, it might be rendered with greater exactness "Rice-boiled-rice,"
ine denoting rice in the husk and ihi the same when boiled.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[158:3](kj050.htm#fr_869.md) *Mi-ke-nu-no-mikoto*.
This name has been translated in accordance with Motowori's
interpretation of the syllables that compose it.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[158:4](kj050.htm#fr_870.md)
*Waka-nu-ke-nu-no-mikoto*. *Conf*. preceding Note.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[158:5](kj050.htm#fr_871.md)
Toyo-nu-ke-nu-no-mikoto. *Conf*. Note 3.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[158:6](kj050.htm#fr_872.md)
*Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko-no-mikoto*. *Yamato* being the name of the
province where this prince, the first Emperor of the so-called "human
age," fixed his capital, it appropriately forms part of his name. For a
discussion of the etymology of the word Yamato, see Sect. V, Note 26.
*Ihare*, a word which is said to signify "assembling," is the name of a
village in that province.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[158:7](kj050.htm#fr_873.md) See Sect. XXVII, Note
12.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[158:8](kj050.htm#fr_874.md) See Sect. XII, Note
8.
