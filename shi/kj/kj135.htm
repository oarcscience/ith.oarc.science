<p>Another time, the Heavenly Sovereign, when about to hold a copious feast,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2122"></A><A HREF="#fn_2117"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> made a progress to the Island of Hime,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2123"></A><A HREF="#fn_2118"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> just when a wild-goose had laid an egg on that island. Then, sending for His Augustness the Noble Takeuchi, he asked him in a Song about the laying of an egg by a wild goose. This Song said:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Court Noble of Uchi! thou indeed art a long-lived person. Hast thou [ever] heard of a wild-goose laying an egg in the land of Yamato?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2124"></A><A HREF="#fn_2119"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></div></p>  
<p>Hereupon the Noble Take-uchi spoke in a song, saying: [284]</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"August Child of the high-shining Sun, it is indeed natural that thou shouldest deign to ask, it is indeed right that thou shouldest ask. I indeed am a long-lived person, [but] have not yet heard of a wild goose laying an egg in the land of Yamato."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2125"></A><A HREF="#fn_2120"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></div></p>  
<p>Having thus spoken, he was granted the august&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2126"></A><A HREF="#fn_2121"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> lute and sang saying:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Oh thou prince! the wild goose must have laid the egg because thou wilt at last rule."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2127"></A><A HREF="#fn_2122"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></div></p>  
<p>This is a Congratulatory Incomplete Song.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2128"></A><A HREF="#fn_2123"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_2118"></A><A HREF="kj135.htm#fr_2123">353:2</A> <i>Hime-shima</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "Princess Island." The name is supposed to be connected with that of the goddess of Himegoso mentioned near the end of Sect. CXIV, and first occurs in Sect. V (Note 33).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2119"></A><A HREF="kj135.htm#fr_2124">353:3</A> The wild-goose goes far north at the approach of spring, and the translator is informed by Capt. Blakiston that the latter has not known <a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="green">p. 354</font></A> of any breeding even on the island of Yezo. The Emperor was therefore naturally astonished at so strange an occurrence as that of a wild-goose laying an egg in Yamato, and asks the Noble Take-uchi whether he had ever heard of the like of it before, Take-uchi being at that time more than two hundred years old (!) according to the chronology of the "Chronicles," and therefore the oldest and most experienced man in the Empire.&#8212;"Court Noble" represents the Japanese word <i>Aso</i> (for <i>Asomi</i>, believed by Motowori and Moribe to be derived from <i>a se omi</i> <A NAME="img_35400"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/35400.jpg">, lit, "my elder brother minister" but used simply as a title), The words Uchi and Yamato are preceded in the original by their respective Pillow-Words <i>tamaki-haru</i> and <i>soramitsu</i>, whose force it is impossible to render in English, and whose origin indeed is obscure. The words rendered "laying an egg "are literally "giving birth to a child."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2120"></A><A HREF="kj135.htm#fr_2125">353:4</A> This Song is too clear to need explanation. As in the preceding one, Yamato is accompanied by the Pillow-Word <i>sora-mitsu</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2121"></A><A HREF="kj135.htm#fr_2126">353:5</A> Or, "Imperial."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2122"></A><A HREF="kj135.htm#fr_2127">353:6</A> <i>I.e.</i>, say Motowori and Moribe, who refer this episode to a time previous to Nin-toku's accession, "The wild-goose has laid an egg in token of the future accession to the throne." The translator prefers the view expressed by Keichi&#363; in his <i>K&#333;-Gan Sh&#333;</i>, and adopted in the "<A HREF="errata.htm#86">Explanation</A> of the Songs in the Chronicles of Japan," that the words <i>tsuki na</i> "at last," must here be taken in the sense of "long," and the Song interpreted to mean "The wild-goose lays an egg as an omen that thy reign will be a long one." This view is supported by the story in the "Chronicles," which places the Song in the Emperor's fiftieth year and gives him thirty-six years of subsequent existence, thus making the prophecy amply fulfil itself, as one would expect that it should do in the pages of such a work. According to the other view, the text of the "Chronicles" calls for emendation.</P>
