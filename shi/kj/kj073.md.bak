## \[SECT. LXVI.—EMPEROR SŪ-JIN (PART IV.—WAR WITH KING TAKE-HANI-YASU).\]

Again in this august reign His Augustness Oho-biko <span
id="fr_1352"></span>[1](#fn_1348.md) was sent to the circuit of
Koshi, <span id="fr_1353"></span>[2](#fn_1349.md) and his son, His
Augustness Take-nuna-kaha-wake, <span id="fr_1354"></span>[3](#fn_1350.md)
was sent to the twelve circuits to the eastward to quiet the
unsubmissive people. Again Hiko-imasu was sent to the land of
Taniha <span id="fr_1355"></span>[4](#fn_1351.md) to slay
Kugamimi-no-mikasa <span id="fr_1356"></span>[5](#fn_1352.md) (<span
class="small">this is the name of a person</span>). So when His
Augustness Oho-biko was going away to the land of Koshi, a young girl
wearing a loin-skirt <span id="fr_1357"></span>[6](#fn_1353.md) stood on
the Pass of Hera <span id="fr_1358"></span>[7](#fn_1354.md) in Yamashiro,
and sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

\[180\] "Now then! Oh Prince Mima-ki-iri! Oh Prince Mi-ma-ki-iri!
Ignorant that they, to steal and slay one's life, cross backwards and
forwards by the back-door, cross backwards and forwards by the front
door and spy,—Oh, Prince Mima-ki-iri!" <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[8](#fn_1355.md)

</div>

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

Hereupon His Augustness Oho-kiko, thinking it strange, turned his horse
back, and asked the young girl, saying: "These words that thou speakest,
what are they?" The young girl replied, saying: "I said nothing; I was
only singing a song,"—and thereupon she suddenly vanished, none could
see whither. So his Augustness Oho-biko returned up again \[to the
capital\] and made a report \[of the matter\] to the Heavenly Sovereign,
who replied and charged him \[saying\]: "Methinks this is a sign that my
half-brother, King Take-hani-yasu, <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[9](#fn_1356.md) who dwells in the land of Yamashiro,
is planning some foul plot. <span id="fr_1361"></span>[10](#fn_1357.md)
\[Do thou,\] uncle, raise an army, and go \[after him\]." When he
forthwith sent him off, joining to him his Augustness
Hiko-kuni-buku, <span id="fr_1362"></span>[11](#fn_1358.md) ancestor of the
Grandees of Wani, <span id="fr_1363"></span>[12](#fn_1359.md) they set
sacred jars on the Pass of Wani, <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[13](#fn_1360.md) and went away. Thereupon, when they
reached the River Wakara <span id="fr_1365"></span>[14](#fn_1361.md)
\[181\] in Yamashiro, King Take-hani-yasu, who had raised an army, was
waiting to intercept \[their passage\], and \[the two hosts\] stood
confronting and challenging each other with the river between
them. <span id="fr_1366"></span>[15](#fn_1362.md) So the place was called
by the name of Idomi, <span id="fr_1367"></span>[16](#fn_1363.md)—what is
now called Idzumi. Then His Augustness Hiko-kuni-buku spoke, begging the
other side <span id="fr_1368"></span>[17](#fn_1364.md) to let fly the first
arrow. <span id="fr_1369"></span>[18](#fn_1365.md) Then King Take-hani-yasu
shot, but could not strike. Thereupon, on his Augustness Kuni-buku
shooting an arrow, it forthwith struck King Take-hani-yasu dead. So the
whole army was routed, and fled in confusion. Then the \[Imperial troops
pursued\] after the fugitive army as far as the ferry of Kusuba, when
harassed by the pursuit, exterunt \[hostium\] excrementa, quae bracis
adhaeserunt. Quare isti loco impositum est nomen Kusobakama. In prœsenti
nominatur Kusu-ba. <span id="fr_1370"></span>[19](#fn_1366.md) Again, on

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

being intercepted in their flight and cut down, \[their bodies\] floated
like cormorants in the river. So the river was called by the name of
U-kaha. <span id="fr_1371"></span>[20](#fn_1367.md) Again, because the
warriors were cut to pieces, the place was called by the name of
Hafuri-sono. <span id="fr_1372"></span>[21](#fn_1368.md) Having thus
finished \[the work of\] pacification, they went up \[to the capital\]
to make their report \[to the Heavenly Sovereign\].

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1348"></span>[220:1](kj073.htm#fr_1352.md) <span
id="page_222">p. 222</span> See Sect. LXI, Note 5.

<span id="fn_1349"></span>[220:2](kj073.htm#fr_1353.md) Literally, "to the
Lord of Koshi," *i.e.*, "to the land of Koshi;" which provinces are
intended by the "twelve circuits to the eastward "mentioned immediately
below is uncertain; but Motowori hazards the guess that we should
understand Ise (including Iga and Shima), Wohari, Mikaha, Tohotafumi
(pron. Tōtōmi), Suruga, Kahi, Idzu, Sagami Musashi, Fusa (the modern
Kadzusa, Shimofusa, and Aha), Hitachi, and Michinoku (a vague name for
the north-eastern portions of the Main Island of the whole east and
north-east of the country. He likewise supposes the use of the word
"road" for circuit or province to have had its origin in the "road"
along which the Imperial officers despatched to the outlying provinces
had to travel to reach their post, and remarks very pertinently in
another passage of his commentary that the term "road "denotes a
province more especially from the point of view of its subjugation or
government. His explanation is, however, rendered untenable by the fact
that the division of the country into such "roads" or "circuits" was an
idea evidently borrowed from the neighbouring peninsula of Korea. At
first, as in this passage, somewhat vaguely used in the sense of
province," it settled down into the designation of "a set of adjacent
provinces." Thus the Tō-kai-dō, or "Eastern Maritime Circuit," includes
fifteen provinces, the Hoku-roku-dō or "Northern Land Circuit," includes
seven provinces, and so on. Cont. Sect. LXII, Note 20.

<span id="fn_1350"></span>[220:3](kj073.htm#fr_1354.md) *I.e.*,
"brave-lagoon-river-youth."

<span id="fn_1351"></span>[220:4](kj073.htm#fr_1355.md) See Sect. LXII,
Note 4.

<span id="fn_1352"></span>[220:5](kj073.htm#fr_1356.md) Motowori is unable
to help us to any understanding of this name.—or names,—for he suggests
that the character <span id="img_22200"></span> ![](img/22200.jpg),
*no*, may be an error for <span id="img_22201"></span>
![](img/22201.jpg) *mata* ("also"), and that two individuals may be
intended. The note in the original telling us that "this is the name of
a person" might equally well be translated in the Plural,—" these are
the names of persons."

<span id="fn_1353"></span>[220:6](kj073.htm#fr_1357.md) <span
id="page_223">p. 223</span> The nature of this garment is not known. One
would suppose, from the way it is mentioned in the text, that there was
perhaps some-thing contrary to custom in its use by a young girl. The
parallel passage in the "Chronicles" does not mention it.

<span id="fn_1354"></span>[220:7](kj073.htm#fr_1358.md) Or, "Hill of Hera,
"—*Hera-zaka*. The "Chronicles" write this name with the characters
<span id="img_22300"></span> ![](img/22300.jpg) *Hira-zaka*, *i.e.*,
"Even Pass" or "Hill."

<span id="fn_1355"></span>[220:8](kj073.htm#fr_1359.md) The meaning of this
poem, which must be considered as one pro-longed exclamation, is: "Oh my
sovereign! Oh my sovereign! Heedless or ignorant of "the plots hatched
against thy life near the very precincts of thy palace, thou "sendest
away thy soldiers to fight in distant parts. Oh my sovereign!"—It will
be remembered that Prince Mima-ki-ri was the (abbreviated) native name
of the reigning monarch, commonly known to posterity by his "canonical
name" of Sūjin. The word rendered "life" is literally "thread" and the
Impersonal Pronoun "one's" used in the translation, must be understood
to refer to the Emperor.

<span id="fn_1356"></span>[221:9](kj073.htm#fr_1360.md) See Sect. LXI,
Notes 12 and 10.

<span id="fn_1357"></span>[221:10](kj073.htm#fr_1361.md) Literally, "foul
heart."

<span id="fn_1358"></span>[221:11](kj073.htm#fr_1362.md) *I.e.*, probably.
"prince land-pacifier." The first element of the compound is sometimes
omitted.

<span id="fn_1359"></span>[221:12](kj073.htm#fr_1363.md) *Wani no omi*.
Wani ("crocodile") 13 the name of a place in the province of Yamato.

<span id="fn_1360"></span>[221:13](kj073.htm#fr_1364.md) *Wani-zaka*. For
the setting of jars *conf*. Sect LX, Note 20.

<span id="fn_1361"></span>[221:14](kj073.htm#fr_1365.md) *Wakara gaha*. It
is what is now called the Idzumi-gaha. Of Wakara we have nothing but an
altogether untenable etymology given in the parallel passage of the
"Chronicles."

<span id="fn_1362"></span>[221:15](kj073.htm#fr_1366.md) More literally,
"each having put the river in the middle, and mutually challenging."

<span id="fn_1363"></span>[221:16](kj073.htm#fr_1367.md) *I.e.*,
"challenging." The more likely etymology of *Idzumi*, which is written
with the character <span id="img_22301"></span> ![](img/22301.jpg), is
"source "or "spring."

<span id="fn_1364"></span>[221:17](kj073.htm#fr_1368.md) The original has
the very curious expressions <span id="img_22302"></span>
![](img/22302.jpg), literally," people of the side-building," which was
a great crux to the early editors, Motowori is probably right in
interpreting it in the sense of "the other side," *i.e.*, "the enemy."

<span id="fn_1365"></span>[221:18](kj073.htm#fr_1369.md) <span
id="img_22303"></span> ![](img/22303.jpg); literally "the arrow to be
shunned, or avoided,"—but rather, in accordance with Archaic Japanese
parlance, "the sacred arrow." Motowori says: "At the commencement of a
battle it was the custom for each side to let fly an "initial arrow."
Being the commencement of <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> the affair,
the arrow was considered "specially important and was shot off
reverently with prayers to the Gods,—" whence its name."

<span id="fn_1366"></span>[221:19](kj073.htm#fr_1370.md) *I.e.*,
"excrements \[fœdatæ\] bracæ." But it is not at all probable that this
is the correct etymology of the name. The stream is a small one in the
eastern part of the province of Kahachi.

<span id="fn_1367"></span>[222:20](kj073.htm#fr_1371.md) *I.e.*,
"cormorant-river."

<span id="fn_1368"></span>[222:21](kj073.htm#fr_1372.md) *I.e.*, "the
garden of cutting-to-pieces."
