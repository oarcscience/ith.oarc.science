## \[SECT. XVII.—THE AUGUST EXPULSION OF HIS-IMPETUOUS-MALE-AUGUSTNESS.\]

Thereupon the eight hundred myriad Deities took counsel together, and
imposed on High-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness a fine of a thousand
tables, <span id="fr_418"></span>[1](#fn_415.md) and likewise cut his
beard, and even caused the nails of his fingers and toes to be pulled
out, and expelled him with a divine expulsion. Again he begged food of
the Deity Princess-of-Great-Food. <span id="fr_419"></span>[2](#fn_416.md)
Then the Princess-of-Great-Food took out all sorts of dainty things from
her nose, her mouth, and her fundament, and made them up into all sorts
\[of dishes\], which she offered to him. But
His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness watched her proceedings, considered
that she was offering up to him filth, and at once killed the Deity
Princess-of-Great-Food. So the things that were born in the body of the
Deity who had been killed were \[60\] \[as follows\]: in her head were
born silkworms, in her two eyes were born rice-seeds, in her two ears
was born millet, <span id="fr_420"></span>[3](#fn_417.md) in her nose were
born small beans, <span id="fr_421"></span>[4](#fn_418.md) in her private
parts was born barley, <span id="fr_422"></span>[5](#fn_419.md) in her
fundament were born large beans. <span id="fr_423"></span>[6](#fn_420.md)
So His Augustness the Deity-Producing-Wondrous-Ancestor <span
id="fr_424"></span>[7](#fn_421.md) caused them to be taken and used as
seeds.
