id="page_332">p. 332</span> Or, as Motowori reads it, *Mofushi*. The
etymology is uncertain. *Wega* has already appeared in Sect. CIII (Note
3). The Old Printed Edition and some Manuscripts have at the conclusion
of this volume the following note: <span id="img_33200"></span>
![](img/33200.jpg), "It is the mausoleum of Mozu." But Mozu is in the
province of Idzumi, and all the later editions discard this note as an
interpolation.
