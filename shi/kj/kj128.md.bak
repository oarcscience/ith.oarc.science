## \[SECT. CXXI.—EMPEROR NIN-TOKU \[PART III.—HE REMITS THE TAXES)\]

Thereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, ascending a lofty mountain and looking
on the land all round, spoke, saying: "In the whole land there rises no
smoke; the land is all poverty-stricken. So I remit <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[1](#fn_2045.md) all people's taxes and \[forced
labour\] from now till three years \[hence.\]" Therefore the great
palace became dilapidated, and the rain leaked in everywhere; but no
repairs were made. The rain that leaked in was caught in troughs, <span
id="fr_2051"></span>[2](#fn_2046.md) and \[the inmates\] removed from \[its
reach\] to places where there was no leakage. When later \[the Heavenly
Sovereign\]\] looked on all the land, the smoke was abundant in the
land. So finding the people rich, he now exacted taxes and forced
labour. Therefore the peasantry <span id="fr_2052"></span>[3](#fn_2047.md)
prospered, and did not suffer from forced labour. So in praise of that
august reign, it was called the reign of the Emperor-Sage. <span
id="fr_2053"></span>[4](#fn_2048.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2045"></span>[336:1](kj128.htm#fr_2050.md) Motowori's reading
of this Verb in the Imperative Mood (as if containing an order addressed
by the monarch to his ministers) seems less natural than the order
reading in the Indicative, which accordingly the translator has
followed.

<span id="fn_2046"></span>[336:2](kj128.htm#fr_2051.md) There is
uncertainty as to the exact character in the original. <span
id="page_337">p. 337</span> But the older editions read it as the
Japanese word *hako*, "boxes." while Motowori prefers *hi*, "tubes."
"Troughs "seems to conciliate both views, and to be also appropriate to
the use mentioned in the text.

<span id="fn_2047"></span>[336:3](kj128.htm#fr_2052.md) Or simply, "the
people." But the expression <span id="img_33700"></span>
![](img/33700.jpg) is generally used in Japanese of the peasantry only.

<span id="fn_2048"></span>[336:4](kj128.htm#fr_2053.md) <span
id="img_33701"></span> ![](img/33701.jpg); If, following most texts, we
omitted the final character <span id="img_33702"></span>
![](img/33702.jpg), "reign," the English translation would be "in praise
of that august reign, (the Heavenly Sovereign) was called the
Emperor-Sage."
