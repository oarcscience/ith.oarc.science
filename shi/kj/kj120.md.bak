## \[SECT. CXIII.—EMPEROR Ō-JIN (PART X.—PRINCES OHO-SAZAKI AND UJI-NO-WAKI-IRATSUKO CEDE THE EMPIRE TO EACH OTHER)\]

Thereupon while the two Deities <span id="fr_1941"></span>[1](#fn_1936.md)
His Augustness Oho-sazaki and Uji-no-waki-iratsuko were, each of them,
ceding the Empire to the other, <span id="fr_1942"></span>[2](#fn_1937.md)
a fisherman <span id="fr_1943"></span>[3](#fn_1938.md) came with a great
feast as tribute. <span id="fr_1944"></span>[4](#fn_1939.md) So they each
resigned it to the other. So the elder brother refused it, and caused
\[258\] it to be offered to the younger brother, and the younger brother
refused it, and caused it to be offered to the elder brother, during
which mutual cedings many days elapsed. As such mutual ceding took place
not \[only\] once or twice, the fisherman wept from the fatigue of going
backwards and forwards. So the proverb says:

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Ah! the fisherman
weeps on account of his own things." <span
id="fr_1945"></span>[5a](#fn_1940.md) Meanwhile Uji-no-waki-iratsuko died
early. <span id="fr_1946"></span>[6](#fn_1941.md) So His Augustness
Oho-sazaki did rule the Empire.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1936"></span>[320:1](kj120.htm#fr_1941.md) It is not actually
the word *kami*, "deity," that is here used in the original, but
*hashira*, which is the Auxiliary Numeral for Deities.

<span id="fn_1937"></span>[320:2](kj120.htm#fr_1942.md) Neither being
willing to accept the Imperial dignity.

<span id="fn_1938"></span>[320:3](kj120.htm#fr_1943.md) Or, "some
fishermen," and similarly in the Plural throughout.

<span id="fn_1939"></span>[320:4](kj120.htm#fr_1944.md) *I.e.*, came to
present fish to His Majesty.

<span id="fn_1940"></span>[321:5a](kj120.htm#fr_1945.md) Motowori is
probably right in saying that the point of this proverb lies in the
consideration that, whereas people in general weep for that which they
have not, this fisherman wept on account of the trouble which was caused
to him by the fish which he had.

<span id="fn_1941"></span>[321:6](kj120.htm#fr_1946.md) Or, "died first,"
The use in this place of the character <span id="img_32100"></span>
![](img/32100.jpg), properly confined to the meaning of the "death of an
Emperor," is remarkable. See Motowori's observations on the point in
Vol. XXXIII, pp. 78-80.
