## APPENDIX II.

THE HITHERTO ACCEPTED CHRONOLOGY OF THE EARLY JAPANESE SOVEREIGNS
MENTIONED IN THE "RECORDS OF ANCIENT MATTERS" ("*KO-JI-KI*") AND IN THE
"CHRONICLES OF JAPAN" ("*NI-HONGI*" ).

\[This "Accepted Chronology "is contained in the first three columns of
figures, whereof the first two, giving the corresponding dates according
to the European reckoning are transcribed from some Comparative
Chronological Tables by Mr. Ernest Satow, printed for private
distribution in 1874. The ages of the monarchs in the third column are
from "The Digest of the Imperial Pedigree," a work published by the
Imperial Japanese Government is 1877, and therefore carrying with it the
weight of authority. It might perhaps be too much to say that even its
decisions are universally bowed to by the native *literati*, but the
differences between various writers are all slight, and excepting on
points that affect only a very few years, the chronology contained in
the first three columns may justly be styled the "Accepted Chronology"
both as far as natives and as far as foreigners are concerned. It will
be seen that it is founded in the main on the statements contained in
the "Chronicles of Japan," though sometimes differing therefrom as well
as from the "Records." The fourth column contains the ages of the
monarchs according to the "Records" and the fifth their ages according
to the "Chronicles." The portion printed in italics, and including a
little over a thousand years, is that which has been shown in Section V
of the Translator's Introduction to be undeserving of credence.
