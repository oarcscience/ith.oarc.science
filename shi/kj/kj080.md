## \[SECT. LXXIII. EMPEROR SUI-NIN (PART. V.—HIS LATER WIVES.)\]

Again, in accordance with the Emperor's words, he summoned Her
Augustness Princess Hibasu, next Her Augustness Princess Oto, next Her
Augustness Princess Utakori, next Her Augustness Princess Matonu, <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[1](#fn_1492.md) daughters of Prince Michi-no-ushi—four
Deities in all. Now he \[198\] kept the two Deities Her Augustness
Princess Hibasu and Her Augustness Princess Oto; but as for the two
Deities the younger queens, he sent them back to their native place on
account of their extreme hideousness. Thereupon Princess Matonu said
with mortification: "When it is known in the neighbouring villages that,
among sisters of the same family, we have been sent back on account of
our ugliness, it will be extremely mortifying;" and, on reaching
Sagaraka <span id="fr_1497"></span>[2](#fn_1493.md) in the Land of
Yamashiro, she tried to kill herself <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[3](#fn_1494.md) by hanging herself from a branch of a
tree. So that place was called by the name of Sagariki. It is now called
Sagaraka. Again, on reaching Otokuni, <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[4](#fn_1495.md) she at last killed herself by
jumping <span id="fr_1500"></span>[5](#fn_1496.md) into a deep pool. So
that place was called by the name of Ochikuni. It is now called Otokuni.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1492"></span>[244:1](kj080.htm#fr_1496.md) <span
id="page_245">p. 245</span> *Hibasu-hime*, *Oto-hime*, *Utakori-hime*
and *Matonu-hime*. The first two of these names have already appeared
above, where the etymology of Hibasu was said to be doubtful, while
*Oto* signifies "younger sister." *Matonu* has likewise already
appeared, and is of uncertain derivation. Motowori supposes this last
name to be in this place but an alias for *Utakori*, which he explains
in the sense of "sad heart" with reference to the story of this princess
as here told. In any case there is confusion in the legend, for in the
parallel passage of the "Chronicles" five princesses are mentioned,
whereas at the end of Sect. LXXI of these "Records" the Empress is made
to speak of only two. The father's name has been already there
explained.

<span id="fn_1493"></span>[244:2](kj080.htm#fr_1497.md) The real derivation
of this name is obscure. The ancient (perhaps here and elsewhere
suppositious ancient) form *Sagari-ki* signifies "hanging-tree."
Saga-raka is written <span id="img_24500"></span> ![](img/24500.jpg), a
good example of the free manner in which some Chinese characters were
anciently used for phonetic purposes. *San-raku*, *Sa-raku* or *Sa-gara*
would be the only readings possible in the modern tongue.

<span id="fn_1494"></span>[244:3](kj080.htm#fr_1498.md) Literally, "wished
to die." Motowori supposes that her design was frustrated by her
attendants.

<span id="fn_1495"></span>[244:4](kj080.htm#fr_1499.md) Written with
characters signifying "younger country," but here supposed by the author
to be derived from *ochi-kuni*, "falling country," in connection with
this legend.

<span id="fn_1496"></span>[244:5](kj080.htm#fr_1500.md) Lit. "died by
falling."
