<P><A NAME="fn_136"></A><A HREF="kj009.htm#fr_136">17:1</A> <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></A> Or, the Deity-Standing-Eternally-on-Earth, <i>Kuni-no-toko-tachi-no-kami</i>, <i>Conf</i>. Note 10 to Sect. I.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_137"></A><A HREF="kj009.htm#fr_137">17:2</A> <i>Toyo-kumo-nu-no-kami</i>. There is much doubt as to the proper interpretation of this name. The characters <A NAME="img_01700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/01700.jpg"> ("cloud-moor"), with which the syllables read <i>kumo-nu</i> are written, are almost certainly phonetic, and the translator has followed Motowori's view as corrected by Hirata, according to which <i>kumo</i> is taken to stand for <i>kumu</i>, "integrating," and <i>nu</i> is considered to be an apocopated form of <i>nushi</i>, "master" (or more vaguely "the person who presides at or does a thing"). Mabuchi in his "Dictionary of Pillow-words," Article <i>Sasutake</i>, argues that the syllables in question should be interpreted in the sense of "coagulated mud"; out this is less satisfactory.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_138"></A><A HREF="kj009.htm#fr_138">17:3</A> <a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></A> <i>U-hiji-no-kami</i> and <i>Su-hiji-ni-no-kami</i>. The names of this pair tend themselves to a variety of interpretations. Motowori's view of the meaning of the first three syllables in each seems best, if it is founded on the Chinese characters with which they are written in the parallel passage of the "Chronicles," and it has therefore been adopted here. Hirata interprets the names thus: First-Mud-Lord and First-Sand-Lady, and takes <i>ni</i> to be an alternative form of the Honorific <i>ne</i> found in so many proper names. This view of the meaning of <i>ni</i> has been followed by the translator. On the other hand Mabuchi explains the names to mean respectively Floating-Mud-Earth and Sinking-Mud-Earth. The only thing therefore that is granted by all is that the names in question refer to the mud or slime out of which the world was afterwards made. The reader will bear in mind that "younger-sister" and "wife" are convertible names in Archaic Japanese. (See Introduction p. XXXVIII.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_139"></A><A HREF="kj009.htm#fr_139">17:4</A> <i>Tsunu-guhi-no-kami</i> and <i>Iku-guhi-no-kami</i>. The interpretation given is one in which the commentators agree, and which has some probability in its favour. It must however only be accepted with reservation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_140"></A><A HREF="kj009.htm#fr_140">17:5</A> <i>Oho-to-no ji-no-kami</i> and <i>Oho-to-no-be-no-kami</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_141"></A><A HREF="kj009.htm#fr_141">17:6</A> <i>Omo-daru-no-kami</i>. We might also render <i>omo-daru</i> by "perfect-face," <i>i.e.</i>, perfectly beautiful."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_142"></A><A HREF="kj009.htm#fr_142">17:7</A> <i>Aya-kashiko-ne-no-kami</i>. For "awful" we might substitute "venerable." Hirata, commentating on this name and the seven which precede it, says: <i>U-hiji-ui</i> and <i>Su-hiji-ni</i> are so named from their having contained the germs of what was to become the earth. <i>Oho-to-no-ji</i> and <i>Oho-to-no-be</i> are so called from the appearance of the incipient earth. <i>Tsunu-guhi</i> and <i>Iku-guhi</i> are so called from the united appearance of the earth and the Deities as they came into existence. <i>Omo-daru</i> and <i>Kashiko-ne</i> are so called from the completion of the august persons of the Deities. Thus their names were given to them from the gradual progress [of creation]."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_143"></A><A HREF="kj009.htm#fr_143">17:8</A> <i>Izana-gi-no-kami</i> and <i>Izana-mi-no-kami</i>. There is some slight diversity of opinion as to the literal signification of the component parts of the names of these the best-known of the Deities hitherto mentioned, though the gist of the meaning remains unchanged. Motowori would prefer to read <i>Iza-na-gi</i> and <i>Iza-a-mi</i>, taking the syllable <i>na</i> as the Second Personal Pronoun "thou," and understanding the names thus: "the Prince-Who-Invites-Thee" and the "Princess-Who-Invites-Thee." It seems however more natural to look on <i>izana</i> as forming but one word, viz., the Root of the Verb <i>Izanafu</i>, "to invite." The older native commentators <a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></A> mean the same thing when they tell us that <i>na</i> is an Expletive. The syllables <i>gi</i> and <i>mi</i> are of uncertain etymology, but occur in other Archaic words to denote the female and male of a pair. The appropriateness of the names of these deities will be seen by referring to Sect. IV.</P>
