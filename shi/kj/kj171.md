## \[SECT. CLXIV.—EMPEROR SEI-NEI (PART II.—PRINCES OHOKE AND WOKE ARE DISCOVERED).\]

Then Wodate, Chief of the Mountain Clan <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[1b](#fn_2361.md) when appointed governor of the land
of Harima, arrived just at

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[328\] \[the time
of\] a rejoicing for the new cave of an inhabitant called
Shizhimu. <span id="fr_2367"></span>[2](#fn_2362.md) Hereupon, when the
feasting and the drinking were at their height, they all danced in turn.
So two young children <span id="fr_2368"></span>[3](#fn_2363.md)
\[employed\] to light the fire sat beside the furnace. <span
id="fr_2369"></span>[4](#fn_2364.md) These young children were made to
dance. Then one of the young children said: "Do thou the elder brother
dance first." The elder brother likewise said: "Do thou the younger
brother dance first." When they thus yielded to each other, the people
who were met together laughed at their manner of yielding to each
other. <span id="fr_2370"></span>[5](#fn_2365.md) So at last the elder
brother danced, \[and when he had\] finished, the younger when about to
dance chanted, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"On the bamboos on the mountain-slopes, behind which are hidden as soon
as they appear my warrior-mate's sword, on whose hilt red earth was
daubed, for whose cord red cloth was cut, and his red flags that were
set up!:—Beggarly descendants of King Ichinobe-no-oshiha, august child
of the Heavenly Sovereign Izaho-wake, who ruled the Empire as it were
cutting the \[bamboos'\] roots and bending down their extremities, and
like playing on an eight-stringed lute!" <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[6](#fn_2366.md)

</div>

\[329\] Then forthwith Chief Wodate, starting at the sound \[of these
words\], and rolling off his couch, <span
id="fr_2372"></span>[7](#fn_2367.md) drove away the people of the cave; and
having set the two <span id="fr_2373"></span>[8](#fn_2368.md) princes
\[one\] on his left knee and \[the other\] on [his](errata.htm#109.md)
right and wept and lamented, he collected the people together, and
having built a temporary palace, and set \[the two princes\]

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

to dwell in that temporary palace, he sent a courier up \[to the
capital\]. Thereupon their aunt, Queen Ihi-toyo, delighted to hear \[the
news\], made them come up to the palace.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2361"></span>[409:1b](kj171.htm#fr_2366.md) *Yama-be no
murazhiwodate*. *Yama-be* has already appeared. *Wo-date* signifies
"small shield."

<span id="fn_2362"></span>[410:2](kj171.htm#fr_2367.md) For this name see
Sect. CXLIX, Note 5. A similar festival at the inauguration of a new
cave is mentioned in Sect. LXXX.

<span id="fn_2363"></span>[410:3](kj171.htm#fr_2368.md) Motowori's vain
attempts to reconcile the dates with this statement of Princes Ohoke and
Woke being "young children "at this time, after an interval of two
reigns since the death of their father, will be found in Vol. XLIII, pp.
10-11, of his Commentary.

<span id="fn_2364"></span>[410:4](kj171.htm#fr_2369.md) *I.e.*, as the
commentators [suppose](errata.htm#110.md), a place or vessel holding a
light with which to kindle other lights for the feast. The word can
scarcely here have its common signification of a "kitchen-range."

<span id="fn_2365"></span>[410:5](kj171.htm#fr_2370.md) *I.e.*, at the fact
of their being so courteous to each other.

<span id="fn_2366"></span>[410:6](kj171.htm#fr_2371.md) This so-called
"chant,"—it is not a Song, because not in metre, and is accordingly not
transcribed syllabically,—is at first sight so difficult as to seem to
defy translation, and to make the student apply to the whole of his
interpretation Motowori's closing remark on his exegesis of one of
phrases contained in it,—"this is mere guess-work, and the text demands
further consideration." A little inspection shows, however, that the
drift of the words is by no means so inscrutable as its partly
ideographic and partly phonetic transcription makes it appear. The first
part down to the colon and dash is a "Preface" to the second, the
"Pivot" joining the two parts in the original Japanese being the word
"bamboos." The laws of English construction unfortunately do not admit
of the force of the [original](errata.htm#111.md), which entirely depends
on the position of the words, being rendered into our language. The
appropriateness of the Preface to the body of the chant rests on the
consideration that the bright articles mentioned in it, viz., the sword
painted and decorated with red streamers (or perhaps tied on with a red
sash) and also the red banners are easily *hidden* behind the thick
leaves of a bamboo-grove, just as the Imperial origin of the two young
Princes was hidden beneath the vile office which they filled in
Shizhimu's household. The clause "cutting the \[bamboos'\] roots and
bending down their extremities" forms the chief difficulty. Indeed the
word "roots" is supplied by Motowori, and his interpretation of the
phrase is merely tentative. We may, <span id="page_412">p. 412</span>
however, until some better explanation is offered, see in it a reference
to the energetic manner in which the Empire was ruled by the young
princes grandfather, the Emperor Izaho-wake (i-chiū), or else perhaps by
their father Ichinobe-no-Oshiha. This latter view is preferred by
Motowori, though according to the history Ichinobe-no-oshiha never
actually ascended the throne. The position of the Verb "ruled" in the
Japanese text permits of either interpretation. The comparison of the
government of the Empire to playing on a lute is poetical and
appropriate. It [should](errata.htm#112.md) be noticed that in the Japanese
text the construction of the sentence forming the main body of the chant
is the reverse of what it is made to appear to be in the translation.
The words "beggarly descendants," by which, as a climax, the singer
reveals his own and his brother's illustrious descent, therefore come
last of all and produce on Wodate the startling effect which we read of
in the next sentence.

<span id="fn_2367"></span>[410:7](kj171.htm#fr_2372.md) Or, "seat." In
ancient times each person in a room sat on a special mat, and it is that
small mat which is here meant.

<span id="fn_2368"></span>[410:8](kj171.htm#fr_2373.md) The Numeral is
accompanied by the Auxiliary *hashira*, properly used for gods and
goddesses.
