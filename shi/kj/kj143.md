## \[SECT. CXXXV.—EMPEROR HAN-ZEI.\]

His Augustness Midzu-ha-wake dwelt in the palace of Shibakaki at
Tajihi, <span id="fr_2181"></span>[1](#fn_2176) and ruled the Empire.
The length of this Heavenly sovereign's august person was nine feet two
inches and a half. <span id="fr_2182"></span>[2](#fn_2177) The length of
his august teeth was one inch, and their breadth two lines, and the
upper and lower \[row\] corresponded exactly, \[like jewels strung
together\]. The Heavenly Sovereign wedded the Lady of Tsunu, <span
id="fr_2183"></span>[3](#fn_2178) daughter of Kogoto, Grandee of
Wani, <span id="fr_2184"></span>[4](#fn_2179) and begot august children:
the Lady of Kahi; <span id="fr_2185"></span>[5](#fn_2180) next the Lady
of Tsubura <span id="fr_2186"></span>[6](#fn_2181) (<span
class="small">two Deities</span>). Again he wedded Oto-hime, <span
id="fr_2187"></span>[7](#fn_2182) daughter of the same Grandee, and
begot august children: King Takara; <span
id="fr_2188"></span>[8](#fn_2183) next the Lady of Takabe. <span
id="fr_2189"></span>[9](#fn_2184)—-altogether four Kings \[and
Queens\]. <span id="fr_2190"></span>[10](#fn_2185) The Heavenly
Sovereign's august years were sixty. His august mausoleum is on the Moor
of Mozu. <span id="fr_2191"></span>[11](#fn_2186)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2176"></span>[364:1](kj143.htm#fr_2181) <span
id="page_364">p. 364</span> For Tajihi see Sect. CXXXII, Note 4.
*Shiba-kaki* (or *Shiba-gaki*) signifies "a fence of brushwood."

<span id="fn_2177"></span>[364:2](kj143.htm#fr_2182) As to the ancient
Japanese measures we have no accurate information, and the English
equivalents used in this passage correspond but approximately to the
modern Japanese standards. The character rendered "line" is <span
id="img_36400"></span> ![](img/36400.jpg), which denotes the tenth part
of a <span id="img_36401"></span> ![](img/36401.jpg) or "inch." Motowori
remarks that the dimensions of the teeth are not anything extraordinary
<span id="page_365">p. 365</span> judged by the present standard, and
suppose that anciently the measures of length must have been smaller
than at present.

<span id="fn_2178"></span>[364:3](kj143.htm#fr_2183) *Tsunu no
iratsume*. The signification of this name is obscure.

<span id="fn_2179"></span>[364:4](kj143.htm#fr_2184) *Wani no kogoto no
omi*. The meaning of Kogoto is obscure, Wani has already often appeared.

<span id="fn_2180"></span>[364:5](kj143.htm#fr_2185) *Kahi no iratsume*.
Kahi is the name of a province, but it cannot be said for certain that
it is from it that this Princess derived her name.

<span id="fn_2181"></span>[364:6](kj143.htm#fr_2186) *Tsubura no
iratsume*. The meaning of *Tsubura* is obscure.

<span id="fn_2182"></span>[364:7](kj143.htm#fr_2187) *I.e.*, "the
younger princess."

<span id="fn_2183"></span>[364:8](kj143.htm#fr_2188) *Takara no miko*.
*Takara* signifies "treasure."

<span id="fn_2184"></span>[364:9](kj143.htm#fr_2189) *Takabe no
iratsume*. *Takabe* seems to be the name of a place unless it be
considered to be connected with the word *taka*, "hawk."

<span id="fn_2185"></span>[364:10](kj143.htm#fr_2190) Remember that the
single character <span id="img_36500"></span> ![](img/36500.jpg)
includes both sexes.

<span id="fn_2186"></span>[364:11](kj143.htm#fr_2191) See Sect. CXXX.
Note 1.
