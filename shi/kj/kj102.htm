<p>The Heavenly Sovereign Tarashi-naka-tsu-hiko dwelt at the palace of Toyora at Anado,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1723"></A><A HREF="#fn_1718"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and likewise at the palace of Kashihi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1724"></A><A HREF="#fn_1719"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in Tsukushi, and ruled the Empire. [328] This Heavenly Sovereign wedded Her Augustness Oho-naka-tsu-hime,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1725"></A><A HREF="#fn_1720"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> daughter of King Oho-ye, and begot august children: King Kagosaka and King Oshikuma (two Deities). Again he wedded Her Augustness Princess Okinaga-tarashi. This Empress&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1726"></A><A HREF="#fn_1721"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> gave birth to august children: His Augustness Homu-ya-wake,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1727"></A><A HREF="#fn_1722"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and next His Augustness Oho-tomo-wake,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1728"></A><A HREF="#fn_1723"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> another name for whom was His Augustness Homuda-wake.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1729"></A><A HREF="#fn_1724"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> The reason why this Heir Apparent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1730"></A><A HREF="#fn_1725"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> was given the august name of His Augustness Oho-tomo-wake was that when first&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1731"></A><A HREF="#fn_1726"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> born, he had on his august arm [a protuberance of] flesh resembling an elbow-pad,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1732"></A><A HREF="#fn_1727"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> whence the august name bestowed on him. By this it was known while he was in the womb that he would rule countries.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1733"></A><A HREF="#fn_1728"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> In this august reign the granaries of Ahaji were established.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1719"></A><A HREF="kj102.htm#fr_1724">283:2</A> This name seems to be derived from that of the evergreen oak. It will be noticed that both these capitals are in the South-Western Island of Kiushiu, whereas, from Jim-mu downwards, the capitals of all the Emperors previously mentioned are either in Yamato or in one of the adjacent central provinces.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1720"></A><A HREF="kj102.htm#fr_1725">283:3</A> For this and the three following names see Sect. XCII, and for <i>Okinaga tarashi</i> Sect. LXII, Note 72.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1721"></A><A HREF="kj102.htm#fr_1726">283:4</A> Written <A NAME="img_28300"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/28300.jpg">. It is she who is celebrated in Japanese history under the name of Jin-g&#333; K&#333;g&#333;, and in the "Chronicles" her reign is counted separately. In these "Records," however, the period of her rule is forming part of the reign of her son O-jin.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1722"></A><A HREF="kj102.htm#fr_1727">283:5</A> The signification of this name is obscure.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1723"></A><A HREF="kj102.htm#fr_1728">283:6</A> <a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="green">p. 284</font></A> <i>I.e.</i>, "great <A HREF="errata.htm#61">elbow-pad</A> lord," <i>tomo</i> signifying "elbow pad." The next sentence of the text gives the traditional origin of this curious name.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1724"></A><A HREF="kj102.htm#fr_1729">283:7</A> <i>I.e.</i>, lord of Homuda. <i>Homuda</i> is supposed by Motowori and Moribe to be the name of a place, they (apparently with reason) rejecting as a late addition a note to the "Chronicles," which states that <i>homuda</i> was synonymous with <i>tomo</i> "elbow-pad."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1725"></A><A HREF="kj102.htm#fr_1730">283:8</A> For "heir apparent "see Sect. XXXIII, Note 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1726"></A><A HREF="kj102.htm#fr_1731">283:9</A> This word, says Motowori, is redundant.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1727"></A><A HREF="kj102.htm#fr_1732">283:10</A> For the use of elbow-pads in war see Sect XIII, Note 7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1728"></A><A HREF="kj102.htm#fr_1733">283:11</A> The word rendered "rule" (<i>shiru</i>, <A NAME="img_28400"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/28400.jpg">) is supplied by the editor of 1687. Motowori supplies the evident lacuna in the text by the word "establish" (<i>sadamaru</i> <A NAME="img_28401"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/28401.jpg">); but this seems less good. Motowori's reasons for taking the word <i>kuni</i> ("country") in the Plural are, however, convincing,&#8212;the three countries into which Korea was anciently divided, and which are appropriately designated by the title of <i>San Kan</i> (<A NAME="img_28402"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/28402.jpg">), being evidently designated by the expression in the text, as may be seen both by reference to the parallel passage in the "Chronicles," and also by considering that in this manner that warlike implement the elbow-pad, with the semblance of which the young Emperor was born, obtains its proper significance. This Emperor (for it is he who is known as &#332;-jin Ten-n&#333;) is sometimes designated by the name of the "Emperor in the Womb" (<A NAME="img_28403"></A>
