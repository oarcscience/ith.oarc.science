## \[SECT. CXLVIII.—EMPEROR AN-KŌ (PART V:—PRINCE OHO-HATSUSE SLAYS PRINCE OSHIHA).\]

After this Karu-fukuro, <span id="fr_2285"></span>[1](#fn_2280.md) ancestor
of the Dukes of Yama of Sasaki in Afumi, <span
id="fr_2286"></span>[2](#fn_2281.md) said \[to King Oho-hatsuse\]: "At
Kuta <span id="fr_2287"></span>[3](#fn_2282.md) \[and?\] on the moor of
Kaya at Wata in Afumi, boars and deer are abundant. Their legs as they
stand are like a moor \[covered\] with *wogi*; <span
id="fr_2288"></span>[4](#fn_2283.md) the horns they point up are like
withered trees." At this [time](errata.htm#98.md) \[King Oho-hatsuse\],
taking with him King Ichi-no-be-no-oshiha, made a progress to Afumi, and
on reaching this moor, each of them built a separate temporary palace to
lodge in. Then next morning, before the sun had risen, King Oshiha with
a tranquil heart rode along on his august horse, and, reaching and
standing beside King Oho-hatsuse's temporary Palace, said to King
Oho-hatsuse's attendants: "Is he not awake yet? He must \[309\] be told
quickly \[that I am come\]. It is already day-light. <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[5](#fn_2284.md) He must come to the
hunting-ground,"—and forthwith urging his horse, he went forth. Then the
people who served the august person of King Oho-hatsuse

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

said: "As \[King Oshiha\] is a violent-spoken <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[6](#fn_2285.md) Prince, thou shouldst be on thy guard,
and likewise it were well to arm thine august person." Forthwith he put
on armour underneath his clothes, took and girded on him his bow and
arrows, rode off on horseback, and in a sudden interval setting his
horse by the side \[of the other King's\], took out an arrow, shot King
Oshiha down, forthwith moreover cut his body \[to pieces\], put \[them\]
into a horse's manger, and buried them level with the earth.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2280"></span>[385:1](kj155.htm#fr_2285.md) <span
id="page_386">p. 386</span> This name has the curious signification of
"Korean (or Chinese) bag."

<span id="fn_2281"></span>[385:2](kj155.htm#fr_2286.md) *Afumi no Sasaki no
yama no kiwi*. *Conf*. Sect. LXIX, Note 46.

<span id="fn_2282"></span>[385:3](kj155.htm#fr_2287.md) This and the
following names are altogether obscure, neither is it evident whether
two places are meant, or only one. The present passage reads as if two
were intended, but a little further down the author seems to be speaking
of but one.

<span id="fn_2283"></span>[385:4](kj155.htm#fr_2288.md) The *Hedysarum
esculentum*.

<span id="fn_2284"></span>[385:5](kj155.htm#fr_2289.md) Literally "the
night has already finished dawning."

<span id="fn_2285"></span>[386:6](kj155.htm#fr_2290.md) Motowori
endeavours, not every successfully, to explain the use of this epithet
by Prince Oho-Hatsuse's attendants. As the sequel shows, the violence
was all on the other side.
