## \[SECT. XXXI.—THE HEAVENLY-YOUNG-PRINCE.\]

Therefore the High-August-Producing-Wondrous-Deity and the
Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity again asked all the Deities, saying.
"The Deity Ame-no-ho-hi, whom we sent down to the Central Land of
Reed-Plains, is long of bringing back a report. <span
id="fr_644"></span>[1](#fn_640.md) Which Deity were it best to send on a
fresh mission?" <span id="fr_645"></span>[2](#fn_641.md) Then the Deity
Thought-Includer replied, saying: "The Heavenly-Young-Prince, <span
id="fr_646"></span>[3](#fn_642.md) son of the Deity
Heaven's-Earth-Spirit <span id="fr_647"></span>[4](#fn_643.md) should be
sent." So they bestowed on him the Heavenly feathered arrows, <span
id="fr_648"></span>[5](#fn_644.md) and sent him. Thereupon the
Heavenly-Young-Prince, descending to that land, at once wedded Princess
Under-Shining, <span id="fr_649"></span>[6](#fn_645.md) daughter of the
Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land, <span id="fr_650"></span>[7](#fn_646.md)
and moreover, planning how he might gain \[possession of\] the land, for
eight years brought back no \[95\] report. So then the
High-August-Producing-Wondrous-Deity and the
Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity again asked all the Deities,
\[saying\]: "The Heavenly-Young-Prince is long of bringing back a
report. <span id="fr_651"></span>[8](#fn_647.md) Which Deity shall we send
on a fresh mission to enquire the cause of the Heavenly-Young-Prince's
long tarrying?" Thereupon all the Deities and likewise the Deity
Thought-Includer replied, saying: "The pheasant the
Name-Crying-Female <span id="fr_652"></span>[9](#fn_648.md) should be
sent," upon which \[the High-August-Producing-Wondrous-Deity and the
Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity\] charged \[the pheasant\], saying:
"What thou shalt go and ask the Heavenly-Young-Prince is this: 'The
reason for which thou wast sent to the Central Land of Reed-Plains was
to subdue and pacify the savage Deities of that land. Why for eight
years bringest thou back no report?'" So then the Crying-Female,

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

descending from Heaven, and perching on the multitudinous
\[-ly-branching\] cassia-tree <span id="fr_653"></span>[10](#fn_649.md) at
the Heavenly-Young-Prince's gate, told him everything according to the
mandate of the Heavenly Deities. Then the Heavenly-Spying-Woman, <span
id="fr_654"></span>[11](#fn_650.md) having heard the bird's words, spoke to
the Heavenly-Young-Prince, saying: "The sound of this bird's cry is very
bad. So thou shouldest shoot it to earth." On her \[thus\] urging him,
the Heavenly-Young-Prince at once took the heavenly vegetable wax-tree
\[96\] bow and the heavenly deer-arrows bestowed on him by the Heavenly
Deities, and shot the pheasant to death. Then the arrow, being shot up
upside down <span id="fr_655"></span>[12](#fn_651.md) through the
pheasant's breast, reached the august place where the
Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity and the High-Integrating-Deity <span
id="fr_656"></span>[13](#fn_652.md) were sitting in the bed of the Tranquil
River of Heaven. This "High-integrating-Deity" is another name for the
High-August-Producing-Wondrous-Deity. So, on the High-Integrating-Deity
taking up the arrow and looking at it \[he saw that\] there was blood
adhering to the feathers of the arrow. Thereupon the
High-Integrating-Deity, saying: "This arrow is the arrow that was
bestowed on the Heavenly-Young-Prince," showed it to all the Deities,
and said: "If this be an arrow shot at the evil Deities by the
Heavenly-Young-Prince in obedience to our command, let it not hit him.
If he has a foul heart, let the Heavenly-Young-Prince perish <span
id="fr_657"></span>[14](#fn_653.md) by this arrow." With these words, the
took the arrow and thrust it back down through the arrow's hole, <span
id="fr_658"></span>[15](#fn_654.md) so that it hit the
Heavenly-Young-Prince on the top of his breast <span
id="fr_659"></span>[16](#fn_655.md) as he was sleeping on his couch, so
that he died. (<span class="small">This is the origin of \[the saying\]
Beware of a returning arrow. <span
id="fr_660"></span>[17](#fn_656)</span>.md) Moreover the pheasant returned
not. So this is the

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

origin of the modern proverb which speaks of 'the pheasant as sole
messenger.' <span id="fr_661"></span>[18](#fn_657.md) So the sound of the
wailings of the Heavenly-Young-Prince's wife Princess Under-Shining,
re-echoing in the wind, reached Heaven. So the Heavenly-Young-Prince's
father, the Deity Heaven's-Earth-Spirit, and his wife and children <span
id="fr_662"></span>[19](#fn_658.md) who were in heaven, hearing it, came
down with cries and lamentations, and at once built a mourning-house
there, <span id="fr_663"></span>[20](#fn_659.md) and made the wild goose of
the river <span id="fr_664"></span>[21](#fn_660.md) the head-hanging
bearer <span id="fr_665"></span>[22](#fn_661.md) the heron the
broom-bearer, the kingfisher the person of the august food, the sparrow
the pounding-woman, <span id="fr_666"></span>[23](#fn_662.md) \[98\] the
pheasant the weeping woman; and, having thus arranged matters, they
disported themselves <span id="fr_667"></span>[24](#fn_663.md) for eight
days and eight nights, At this time the Deity
Ajishiki-taka-hiko-ne <span id="fr_668"></span>[25](#fn_664.md) came and
condoled on the mourning for the Heavenly-Young-Prince, whereupon the
Heavenly-Young-Prince's father and wife who had come down from Heaven
bewailed themselves, <span id="fr_669"></span>[26](#fn_665.md) saying: "My
child is not dead, no! My lord is not dead, no!" and with these words
clung to his hands and feet, and bewailed themselves and lamented. The
cause of their mistake was that the two Deities closely resembled each
other in countenance: so therefore they made the mistake. Thereupon the
Deity Ajishi-ki-taka-hiko-ne was very angry, and said: "It was only
because he was my dear friend that I came to condole. Why should I be
likened to an unclean dead person?"—and with these words he drew the
ten-grasp sabre <span id="fr_670"></span>[27](#fn_666.md) that was augustly
girded on him, and cut down the mourning-house, and kicked away \[the
pieces\] with his feet. This was on what is called Mount Mourning <span
id="fr_671"></span>[28](#fn_667.md) at the source of the River Awimi <span
id="fr_672"></span>[29](#fn_668.md) in the land of Minu. <span
id="fr_673"></span>[30](#fn_669.md) The great sword with which he cut

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[the
mourning-house to pieces\] was called by the name of
Great-Blade-Mower, <span id="fr_674"></span>[31](#fn_670.md) another name
by which it was called being the Divine-Keen-Sabre. <span
id="fr_675"></span>[32](#fn_671.md) So when the \[99\] Deity
Aji-shiki-toba-hiko-ne flew away in his anger, his younger sister Her
Augustness the High-Princess in order to reveal his august name, sang,
saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Oh! ’tis the Deity Aji-shiki-Taka-Hiko-Ne traversing two august valleys
with the refulgence of august assembled hole-jewels, of the august
assembled jewels worn round her neck by the Weaving Maiden in
Heaven!" <span id="fr_676"></span>[33](#fn_672.md)

</div>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_640"></span>[114:1](kj038.htm#fr_644.md) <span
id="page_117">p. 117</span> Literally, "long brings back no report."

<span id="fn_641"></span>[114:2](kj038.htm#fr_645.md) Literally, "to send
again." The same expression occurs below.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[114:3](kj038.htm#fr_646.md) *Ame-waka-hiko*. All
the commentators agree that it is in order to express disapprobation of
this god's wickedness that the title of Deity or Augustness is never
coupled with his name.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[114:4](kj038.htm#fr_647.md)
*Ame-tsu-kuni-tama-no-kami*.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[114:5](kj038.htm#fr_648.md) *Ame-no-koko-yumi*
and *ame-no-haha-ya*. In Sect. XXXIV these weapons are mentioned under
the slightly altered names of *ama-no-hazhi-yumi* ("heavenly vegetable
wax-tree bow") and *ama-no-kaku-ya* ("heavenly deer-arrows.") A large
bow made of vegetable wax-tree (*Rhus succedanea*) wood, and arrows with
broad feathers, are supposed to be intended.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[114:6](kj038.htm#fr_649.md) *Shita-teru-hime*.
See Sect. XXVI, Note 4.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[114:7](kj038.htm#fr_650.md)
*Oho-kuni-nushi-no-kami*. See Sect. XX, Note 17.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[114:8](kj038.htm#fr_651.md) Literally, "long
brings back no report."

<span id="fn_648"></span>[114:9](kj038.htm#fr_652.md) *Na-naki-me*. If the
view here taken of the meaning of the Japanese expression be correct (it
is that preferred by Motowori and Hirata), the pheasant would seem to
have been supposed to cry out its own name,—in Archaic Japanese
*kigishi*. The syllables *na naki me*, however, lend, themselves equally
well to the interpretation of "nameless female," and are in the
"Chronicles" found written with characters having that signification.
Another reasonable opinion is that the name should be connected with the
tradition mentioned further on of the <span id="page_118">p. 118</span>
pheasant having been the mourner (lit. "crying female," *naki-me*) at
the funeral of the Heavenly-Young-Prince. In this case the word *na*,
"name," would have to be considered redundant, and it will be observed
that the next time the name is mentioned, we find simply *naki-me*,
"crying female," without the syllable in question.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[115:10](kj038.htm#fr_653.md) *Katsura no-ki*,
variously written <span id="img_11800"></span> ![](img/11800.jpg), <span
id="img_11801"></span> ![](img/11801.jpg), <span id="img_11802"></span>
![](img/11802.jpg), <span id="img_11803"></span> ![](img/11803.jpg), and
phonetically <span id="img_11804"></span> ![](img/11804.jpg). Though it
is not absolutely certain what tree is intended, the weight of authority
and of probability is in favour of its being the cassia, which plays a
part in Chinese mythology. In modern parlance the *katsura* is a tree
whose Latin name is *Cercidiphyllum japonicum*.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[115:11](kj038.htm#fr_654.md) *Ama-no-sagu-me*.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[115:12](kj038.htm#fr_655.md) This expression, as
Motowori explains, signifies only that, as the arrow was shot from below
straight up at a pheasant perching on a branch overhead, the feathers,
which are properly considered to form the top part of the arrow, were
naturally underneath.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[115:13](kj038.htm#fr_656.md) *Taka-gi-no-kami*.
The name is written with the characters <span id="img_11805"></span>
![](img/11805.jpg), which, taken ideographically, would give us in
English "High-Tree-Deity." But the translator has little doubt but that
Motowori is correct in [considering](errata.htm#18.md) <span
id="img_11806"></span> ![](img/11806.jpg) to be here used phonetically,
and the syllable *gi*, which it represents, to be a contraction of
*guhi* (for *kuhi*), itself derived from *kumu*, and best rendered by
the Verb "to integrate."

<span id="fn_653"></span>[115:14](kj038.htm#fr_657.md) In Japanese
*magare*, lit. "turn aside," "become crooked," *i.e.*, "come to a bad
end."

<span id="fn_654"></span>[115:15](kj038.htm#fr_658.md) *I.e.*, through the
hole in the bottom of the sky through which the arrow had entered, or
which the arrow had made for itself.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[115:16](kj038.htm#fr_659.md) Literally "high
breast-hill."

<span id="fn_656"></span>[115:17](kj038.htm#fr_660.md) The sentence placed
between brackets is supposed by Motowori to be an addition to the text
made by some copyist who had in his mind the parallel passage of the
"Chronicles." In the "Records of Ancient Matters Revised" the two
characters answering to our word "beware" are omitted, and the resulting
meaning is: "This was the origin of the practice of sending back
arrows," *i.e.*, of shooting an enemy with the arrow he had himself just
used.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[116:18](kj038.htm#fr_661.md) The import of the
proverb seems to be that an embassy should always consist of more than
one person. This is Motowori's view, based on his interpretation of the
character <span id="img_11807"></span> ![](img/11807.jpg) as *hita*,
which he identifies with *hito*, "one"; and it agrees well with the
story in the text. Hirata, who, in his "Exposition of the Ancient
Histories," following the version <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> of
the legend given in the "Chronicles," narrates two pheasant
embassies,—the male bird being sent first and (as it did not return) the
female afterwards,—takes the character in the proper sense belonging to
it in Chinese, and interprets the words of the proverb to mean "the
pheasant's hurried embassy."

<span id="fn_658"></span>[116:19](kj038.htm#fr_662.md) *I.e.*, the wife and
children of the Heavenly-Young-Prince, who had been left behind by him
in Heaven when he went on his embassy to Idzumo.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[116:20](kj038.htm#fr_663.md) *I.e.*, in the place
where he died. The "mourning house" was used to keep the corpse in till
it was finally buried.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[116:21](kj038.htm#fr_664.md) Some of the
commentators believe this bird to be a separate species, and Moribe, who
says that he saw one at the estuary near Kuhana in Ise, describes it as
"rather slenderer than an ordinary wild goose, with longer legs and a
higher back." If we accepted this, the better English translation would
be "river wild goose."

<span id="fn_661"></span>[116:22](kj038.htm#fr_665.md) The original of this
expression (*kisari-mochi*) is very obscure even in the "Chronicles," by
whose ideographic reading the translator has been guided, and being here
written phonetically becomes more conjectural still. The most likely
opinion is that it signifies one bearing on his head the food to be
offered to the corpse, though if this view be adopted, the office of the
mourner in question may seem to resemble too closely that of the
kingfisher. The latter has however been supposed to have brought fish,
while the goose may have brought rice. Another proposal is that the
goose brought the food and the kingfisher cooked it, while the sparrow,
as mentioned below, performed the intermediate operation of pounding the
rice. (See Motowori's elaborate note on this word in Vol. XIII, pp.
47-48 of his Commentary).

<span id="fn_662"></span>[116:23](kj038.htm#fr_666.md) Or simply, "the
pounder."

<span id="fn_663"></span>[116:24](kj038.htm#fr_667.md) The parallel passage
of the "Chronicles" tells us that "they wept and wailed and sang for
eight days and eight nights."

<span id="fn_664"></span>[116:25](kj038.htm#fr_668.md) See Sect. XXVI, Note
2. He was brother to the Heavenly-Young-Prince's wife.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[116:26](kj038.htm#fr_669.md) The author of the
"Perpetual Commentary on the Chronicles of Japan" tells us that these
tears were tears of joy, Doubtless such is the meaning of the text; yet
the repetition of the words "bewailing" and "lamenting" is curious.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[116:27](kj038.htm#fr_670.md) See Sect. VIII. Note
4.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[116:28](kj038.htm#fr_671.md) *Mo-yama*. No such
mountain is now known.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[116:29](kj038.htm#fr_672.md) <span
id="page_120">p. 120</span> *Awimi-gaha*. No such river is now known.
According to the characters with which it is written the name signifies
"Knot-grass-Seeing River."

<span id="fn_669"></span>[116:30](kj038.htm#fr_673.md) Afterwards called
Mino. This province probably received its name, as the author of the
"Explanation of Japanese Names" suggests, from *mi nu*, *i.e.*, "three
moors," from the large moors of Kagami, Awo, and Seki-ga-hara which it
contains. The modern commentators prefer to derive it from ma nu, "true
moor."

<span id="fn_670"></span>[117:31](kj038.htm#fr_674.md) *Oho-ha-hari*. The
name might also be rendered "Great Leaf-Mower." The translator has
followed Hirata in omitting the *nigori* from the syllable *ka*.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[117:32](kj038.htm#fr_675.md) *Kamudo-tsurugi*.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[117:33](kj038.htm#fr_676.md) The meaning of the
Song is: "Oh! this is *Aji-shihi-taka-hiko-ne*, whose refulgence,
similar to that of the jewels worn by the Weaving Maiden in Heaven,
shines afar across hills and valleys."—The translator does not follow
those commentators who emend *ana-dama*, "hole-jewels" to *aka-dama*,
"red," *i.e.* "resplendent jewels," as the frequent reference in this
and the other ancient books to the string on which beads were strung,
and the presence in ancient tombs, etc. of numbers of such beads with
holes drilled through them (they are now known by the name of
*kuda-dama*, *i.e.* "tube-jewels")renders such an emendation unnecessary
The "Weaving Maiden in Heaven" is evidently, notwithstanding Motowori's
endeavour to disprove the fact, the Chinese *Chih Nü*, a personification
of α Lyrae, to whom there are countless allusions in Chinese literature,
and who also became a frequent theme of the later Japanese poets.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[117:34](kj038.htm#fr_677.md) Or, "barbarous
style" Motowori endeavours to explain away the various names of styles
of Songs found in the early literature by asserting that they are simply
derived from the initial words of the Song in question, and that, for
instance, in the present case, the title of Rustic Song was bestowed on
the poem only because in the "Chronicles" it is coupled with another
which lends itself to such an interpretation. Moribe gives his sanction
to this view; but, though it is difficult to explain many of the titles
on any other theory, the translator thinks that it cannot be accepted as
generally satisfactory in the face of the numerous cases which
contradict it, and of which its supporters can give no satisfactory
explanation. The whole subject of the titles, of the manner of singing,
etc., of the ancient poems is indeed involved in obscurity.
