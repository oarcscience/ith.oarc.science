## \[SECT. XXXIX.—THE AUGUST EXCHANGE OF LUCK.\]

So His Augustness Fire-Shine was a prince who got his luck <span
id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_806.md) on the sea, and caught things broad of
fin and things narrow of fin. His Augustness Fire-Subside was a prince
who got his luck on the mountains, and caught things rough of hair and
things soft of hair. Then His Augustness Fire-Subside said to his elder
brother His Augustness Fire-Shine: "Let us mutually exchange,

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

and use each other's luck." \[Nevertheless\], though he thrice made the
request, \[his elder brother\] would not accede \[to it\]; but at last
with difficulty the mutual exchange was obtained. Then His Augustness
Fire-Subside, undertaking the sea-luck, angled for fish, but never got a
single fish; and moreover he lost the fish-hook in the sea. Thereupon
his elder brother His Augustness Fire-Shine asked him for the fish-hook,
saying: "A mountain-luck is a luck of its own, and a sea-luck is a luck
of its own. Let each of us now restore \[to the other\] his luck." <span
id="fr_811"></span>[2](#fn_807.md) To which the younger brother His
Augustness Fire-Subside replied, saying: "As for thy fish-hook, I did
not get a single fish by angling with it; and at last I lost it in the
sea." But the elder brother required it of him \[the more\] urgently. So
the younger brother, breaking his ten grasp sabre <span
id="fr_812"></span>[3](#fn_808.md) that was augustly girded \[120\] on him,
made \[of the fragments\] five hundred fish-hooks as compensation; but
he would not take them. Again he made a thousand fish-hooks as
compensation; but he would not receive them, saying: "I still want the
real original fish-hook."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_806"></span>[145:1](kj046.htm#fr_810.md) <span
id="page_146">p. 146</span> For the archaic Japanese work *sachi*, here
rendered "luck," there is no satisfactory English equivalent. Its
original and most usual signification is "luck," "happiness; "then that
which a man is lucky in or skilful at,—his "*forte*; "and finally that
which he procures by his luck or skill and the implements which he uses
in procuring it. The exchange negotiated below was doubtless that of the
bow and arrows of one deity for the other deity's fish-hook.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[146:2](kj046.htm#fr_811.md) *I.e.*, "Some men are
naturally good hunters, and others naturally good fishermen. Let us
therefore restore to each other the implements necessary to the
successful following of our respective avocations."—The clause rendered
"Let each of us now restore to the other his luck "is a little confused
in the original; but the *kana* readings both old and new agree in
interpreting it as has here been done.
