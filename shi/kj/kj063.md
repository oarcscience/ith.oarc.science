## \[SECT. LVI.—EMPEROR AN-NEI.\]

His Augustness Shiki-tsu-hiko-tama-de-mi dwelt in the palace of Ukiana
at Kata-shiha, <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1b](#fn_1055.md) and ruled the
Empire. This Heavenly Sovereign wedded Akuto-hime, <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[2b](#fn_1056.md) daughter of the Departmental Lord
Haye, <span id="fr_1061"></span>[3b](#fn_1057.md) elder brother of
Kaha-mata-bime, and begot august children: His Augustness

Toko-ne-tsu-hiko-irone, <span id="fr_1062"></span>[4](#fn_1058.md) next His
Augustness Oho-yamato-hiko-suki-tomo, <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[6](#fn_1060.md) next His Augustness
Shiki-tsu-hiko. <span id="fr_1064"></span>[5](#fn_1059.md) Of the august
children of this Heavenly Sovereign,—three Deities,—His Augustness
Oho-yamato-hiko-suki-tomo \[was he who afterwards\] ruled the Empire.
There were two Kings, <span id="fr_1065"></span>[7](#fn_1061.md) children
of the next \[brother\], His Augustness \[155\] Shiki-tsu-hiko. One
child <span id="fr_1066"></span>[8](#fn_1062.md) (<span class="small">was
the ancestor of the Territorial Lords of Suchi in Iga, <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[9](#fn_1063.md) of the Territorial Lords of
Nabari, <span id="fr_1068"></span>[10](#fn_1064.md) and of the Territorial
Lords of Minu</span>); <span id="fr_1069"></span>[11](#fn_1065.md) one
child, <span id="fr_1070"></span>[12](#fn_1066.md) His Augustness
Wa-chi-tsumi, <span id="fr_1071"></span>[13](#fn_1067.md) dwelt in the
palace of Miwi in Ahaji. <span id="fr_1072"></span>[14](#fn_1068.md) So
this King had two daughters: the name of the elder was Hahe-irone, <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[15](#fn_1069.md) and another name for her was Her
Augustness Princess Oho-yamato-kuni-are: <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[16](#fn_1070.md) the name of the younger was
Hahe-irodo. <span id="fr_1075"></span>[17](#fn_1071.md) The Heavenly
Sovereign's august years were forty-nine. Augustness mausoleum est in
privatis partibus Montis Unebi. <span id="fr_1076"></span>[18](#fn_1072.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1055"></span>[189:1b](kj063.htm#fr_1059.md) In Kahachi:
*uki-ana* signifies "floating hole," *Kata-shiha* is said to signify
"hard rock" (*kata-iha*); but this seems doubtful, and the reading given
by the characters in the text is not *Kata-shiha*, but *Kata-shiho*.

<span id="fn_1056"></span>[189:2b](kj063.htm#fr_1060.md) *I.e.*, Princess
of Akuto, or Akuta,—for the latter form of the name is more common.
There exists a place thus called in Settsu. The derivation of the word
is obscure.

<span id="fn_1057"></span>[189:3b](kj063.htm#fr_1061.md)
*Agata-nushi-Haye*. The reading of this name is obscure, and its,
derivation uncertain.

<span id="fn_1058"></span>[190:4](kj063.htm#fr_1062.md) *Irone* signifies
"elder brother" or "elder sister." The rest of the compound is obscure.

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[190:5](kj063.htm#fr_1064.md) The first three
elements of the compound signify "Great Yamato Prince." The last two are
obscure, but Motowori identifies *suki* (see Note 3 to preceding Sect.)

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[190:6](kj063.htm#fr_1063.md) *I.e.*, "Prince of
Shiki"; so called, it is supposed, with reference to the place of
residence of his grandfather.

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[190:7](kj063.htm#fr_1065.md) The character thus
translated is <span id="img_19000"></span> ![](img/19000.jpg), of which
"King "is the original and proper signification. To judge by some other
passages in the ancient histories, it had not yet in the 8th century
altogether paled to <span id="page_191">p. 191</span> the lesser meaning
of "prince," which has belonged to it in later times when denoting
Japanese personages. It is still, as far as possible, used to denote the
rulers of all countries excepting Japan, the zealous admirers of the
native literature and institutions even designating by it the Emperor of
China, who, one would have thought, had a special right to the more
Honorific title of Emperor, which his own subjects were the first to
invent. On the whole, therefore, "King "seems to be the most appropriate
[rendering](errata.htm#41.md). The characters <span id="img_19100"></span>
![](img/19100.jpg) are, by analogy, rendered "Queen."

<span id="fn_1062"></span>[190:8](kj063.htm#fr_1066.md) The text has
"descendant"; but it must here be corrupt or at least faulty, as may be
seen by the omission of the proper name.

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[190:9](kj063.htm#fr_1067.md) *Iga no Suchi no
inaki*. The etymology of *Iga* and that of *Suchi* are alike obscure.
See however Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXI, p. 13, for the traditional
derivation of the former. It is the name of a small province which in
very ancient times formed part of the province of Ise.

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[190:10](kj063.htm#fr_1068.md) *Nabari no inaki*.
Nabari is in Iga. The name signifies, "hiding."

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[190:11](kj063.htm#fr_1069.md) *Minu no inaki*.
Minu, not to be confounded with the province of the same name, is a
place in Iga. The name probably signifies "three moors."

<span id="fn_1066"></span>[190:12](kj063.htm#fr_1070.md) *I.e.*, the other
child.

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[190:13](kj063.htm#fr_1071.md) Motowori reads
*Chichitsumi*. In any case, the name remains obscure.

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[190:14](kj063.htm#fr_1072.md) For Ahaji see
Sect. VI, Note 3. *Mi-wi* signifies "august well," and the name is
traced to the custom of bringing water from the Island of Ahaji for use
in the Imperial Palace, as mentioned in Sect. CXXIX of the present work,
and elsewhere in the early literature.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[190:15](kj063.htm#fr_1073.md) *Irone* means
"elder sister." *Hahe* is of uncertain import, it being written with
completely different characters in the two histories.

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[190:16](kj063.htm#fr_1074.md)
*Oho-yamato-kuni-are-hime-no-mikoto*. *Ono-yamato-kuni* signifies "the
land of Great Yamato," and *hime* signifies "princess "or "maiden."
Motowori suggests that *are*, which is an obscure word, may signify
"pure."

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[190:17](kj063.htm#fr_1075.md) *Irodo* signifies
"younger sister." For *hahe* *conf*. Note 15.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[190:18](kj063.htm#fr_1076.md) *Scil*. in
interiori parte montis, *e.g.* in spelunca. Motowori explains the use of
the term by reference to such words as foot, where the name of a portion
of the human body is applied to a mountain. In Japanese there are others
besides *ashi* ("foot"), such as *itadaki*, *hara* and *koshi*.
