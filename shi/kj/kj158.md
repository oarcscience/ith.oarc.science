## \[SECT. CLI.—EMPEROR YŪ-RIYAKU (PART II.—VARIOUS DEEDS).\]

So the Shiraka Clan <span id="fr_2297"></span>[1](#fn_2292.md) was
established as the august proxy of Prince Shiraka. Again the
Hatsuse-Clan-Retainers <span id="fr_2298"></span>[2](#fn_2293.md) were
established. At this time there came over people from Kure. Again the
Kahase Retainers <span id="fr_2299"></span>[3](#fn_2294.md) were
established. These people from Kure <span
id="fr_2300"></span>[4](#fn_2295.md) were lodged <span
id="fr_2301"></span>[5](#fn_2296.md) at Kure-hara. So the place was called
by the name of Kure-hara. <span id="fr_2302"></span>[6](#fn_2297.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2292"></span>[388:1](kj158.htm#fr_2297.md) <span
id="page_388">p. 388</span> *Shiraka-be*.

<span id="fn_2293"></span>[388:2](kj158.htm#fr_2298.md) *Hatuse-be no
tomire*. This clan was called after the reigning Emperor. Remember that
the word "Retainers" is here a "gentile name."

<span id="fn_2294"></span>[388:3](kj158.htm#fr_2299.md) *Kahase no toneri*.
*Kaha-se* signifies "river-reach," and the "Chronicles," under date of
the eleventh year of this reign, tell a story of the appearance of a
white cormorant, to commemorate which this family was established.
Cormorants, it will be remembered, were used for catching fish in
rivers; hence the appropriateness of the name bestowed on the family in
question.

<span id="fn_2295"></span>[388:4](kj158.htm#fr_2300.md) The name given by
the early Japanese to Wu (<span id="img_38800"></span>
![](img/38800.jpg)), an ancient state in Eastern China to the South of
the Yang-tzo River. In Japanese it however, like other names of portions
of China, often denotes the whole of that country in a somewhat vague
manner. The derivation the word *Kura* is obscure. The most acceptable
proposition is that which would see in it corruption of the original
Chinese term *Wu*, of which *Go* is the Sinico-Japanese pronunciation.
But what of the second syllable *re*?

<span id="fn_2296"></span>[388:5](kj158.htm#fr_2301.md) The phrase <span
id="img_38801"></span> ![](img/38801.jpg) is in this place used for
"lodged."

<span id="fn_2297"></span>[388:6](kj158.htm#fr_2302.md) *I.e.*, Kure Moor.
It is in Yamato. According to the "Chronicles," the former name of the
place had been *Himokuma-nu*.
