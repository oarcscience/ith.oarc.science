The origin of this singular name is thus explained in the "Chronicle" (Emperor Nin-toku, 67th year, Winter, 10th Moon): "(The Emperor made a progress to the moor of Ishidzu in Kafuchi to fix the site of his mausoleum. On the day when the construction of his mausoleum was begun, a deer suddenly ran out from the middle of the moor, rushed into the midst of the coolies, fell down, and <a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="green">p. 357</font></A> died. The suddenness of its death causing astonishment, its wound was looked for, whereupon a shrike came out of its ear, and flew away. So on looking into the ear, it was found to be all eaten away. So that is the reason why the place is called <i>Mozu no mimi-hare</i> (the 'Shrike's Ear-Moor.')"</P>
