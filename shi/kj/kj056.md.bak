## \[SECT. XLIX.—EMPEROR JIM-MU (PART. VI.—THE PRINCE OF TOMI AND THE SHIKI BRETHREN)\]

After this, when about to smite the Prince of Tomi, <span
id="fr_973"></span>[1](#fn_969.md) he sang, saying: \[143\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The children of the augustly powerful army will smite and finish the
one stem of smelly chive in the millet-field,—the stem of its root, both
its root and shoots." <span id="fr_974"></span>[2](#fn_970.md)

</div>

Again he sang:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The ginger, which the children of the augustly powerful army planted
near the hedge, resounds in the mouth. I shall not forget it. I will
smite and finish it." <span id="fr_975"></span>[3](#fn_971.md)

</div>

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

\[144\] Again he sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Like the *turbinidæ* creeping round the great rock in the sea of Ise
\[on which blows\] the divine wind, \[so\] will we creep round, and
smite and finish them." <span id="fr_976"></span>[4](#fn_972.md)

</div>

Again when he smote Shiki the Elder Brother and Shiki the Younger
Brother, <span id="fr_977"></span>[5](#fn_973.md) the august army was
temporarily exhausted. Then he sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"As we fight placing our shields in a row, going and watching from
between the trees on Mount Inasa, oh! we are famished. Ye keepers of
cormorants, the birds of the island, come now to our rescue!" <span
id="fr_978"></span>[6](#fn_974.md)

</div>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_969"></span>[175:1](kj056.htm#fr_973.md) <span
id="page_176">p. 176</span> See Sect. XLIV, Notes 28 *et seq*. The
apparent want of sequence in this portion of the narrative is not
noticed by Motowori. We might endeavour to, harmonize it by supposing
that after having slain the "earth-spiders," etc., the Emperor Jim-mu
turned round again to fight with the Prince of Tomi, who had harassed
him in the earlier portion of his career as conqueror of Central Japan.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[175:2](kj056.htm#fr_974.md) The wild chive
growing among the millet is of course the enemy, the Prince of Tomi and
his host; and the gist of the Song is that the Imperial troops will
smite and destroy them root and branch. The commentators suppose the
simile to have been taken from the fields of millet which Jim-mu's
troops planted for their subsistence during the long drawn out campaigns
of early days.—The "stem of its root," *so ne ga moto*, is a curious
expression, which is perhaps best accounted for by Moribe's supposition
that we have here a pun on *Sune ga moto*, "Sune's house," Sune being a
natural abbreviation of *Nagasune*, the name of the Prince of Tomi (see
Sect. XLIV, Note 28).

<span id="fn_971"></span>[175:3](kj056.htm#fr_975.md) The sense of this
Song is: "I shall not forget the bitterness of seeing my brother slain
by Prince Nagasune's arrow (see the latter part of Sect. XLIV). The word
hazhikami, here rendered ginger in accordance with Motowori's dictum, is
taken by Moribe to signify the xanthoxylon. <span id="page_177">p.
177</span> "Resounding in the mouth" is a curious phrase here used to
express bitterness.

<span id="fn_972"></span>[176:4](kj056.htm#fr_976.md) Motowori thus
paraphrases this Song: "As the innumerable *turbinidæ* \[-shells\] creep
round the great rock, so will I with the myriads of the Imperial host
encompass the Prince of Tomi on every side, that there may be no outlet
whereby he can escape." The shell here mentioned is a kind of small
conch. *Kama-kazo no*, lit, "of divine wind," is the Pillow-Word for
Ise, and is of disputed derivation, as is the word Ise itself. The
curious reader should refer to Fujihara no Hikomaro's "Inquiry into the
Meaning of the Names of All the Provinces" *s.v.* for the legend to
which the name of Ise and its Pillow-Word were anciently traced and
other conjectures on the point, The "great rock" here mentioned is not
otherwise known.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[176:5](kj056.htm#fr_977.md) *Ye-shiki* and
*Otoshiki*. Shiki is the name of a district in the province of Yamato.

<span id="fn_974"></span>[176:6](kj056.htm#fr_978.md) This Song is a
request for provisions made by the Emperor to some fishermen, who were
working their cormorants along the mountain-streams. Moribe refers it to
an incident, not in the war, but in the hunt, and interprets differently
the word here, in accordance with its usual meaning and with older
authority, rendered "as we fight." He attributes to it the sense of "as
we put our shields together," and thinks that the poet may have compared
to shields the trunks of the trees. According to this view, the Song
should be viewed rather as a joke. It may be mentioned that there is
good authority for considering the word *tata namete*, "placing shields
in a row," as a Punning Preface or Pillow-Word for words commencing with
*i* (*i* being the Root of *iru*, "to shoot"), so that Moribe's
explanation need not involve any tautology. It seems however somewhat
far-fetched.—The position of Mount Inasa is uncertain, and the name
itself of obscure derivation.
