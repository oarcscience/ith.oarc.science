## \[SECT. CXLV.—EMPEROR AN-KŌ (PART II.—HE IS SLAIN BY KING MA-YOWA).\]

After this, the Heavenly Sovereign, being on \[his\] divine couch, <span
id="fr_2259"></span>[1](#fn_2254.md) was sleeping at midday. Then he spoke
to his Empress, saying: "Is there anything on thy mind?" She replied,
saying: "Being the object of the Heavenly Sovereign's generous favour,
what, can there be on my mind?" <span id="fr_2260"></span>[2](#fn_2255.md)
Hereupon the Empress's former child, <span
id="fr_2261"></span>[3](#fn_2256.md) King Ma-yowa, who was seven years old
that year, happened to be just then playing outside the apartment. <span
id="fr_2262"></span>[4](#fn_2257.md) Then the Heavenly Sovereign, not
Knowing that the young King was playing outside the apartment, spoke to
the Empress, saying: "I have constantly something upon my mind, namely
\[the fear\] that thy child King Ma-yowa, when he comes to man's estate,
may, on learning that I slew the King his father, requite me with a foul
heart." <span id="fr_2263"></span>[5](#fn_2258.md) Thereupon King Ma-yowa,
who had been playing outside

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

the apartment, and whose ear had caught these words, forthwith watched
for the Heavenly Sovereign to be augustly asleep, and, taking the great
sword \[that lay\] by his side, <span id="fr_2264"></span>[6](#fn_2259.md)
forthwith struck off the Heavenly Sovereign's head, and fled into the
house of the Grandee Tsubura. <span id="fr_2265"></span>[7](#fn_2260.md)
The Heavenly Sovereign's august years were fifty-six, His august
[masoleum](errata.htm#92.md) is on the mound of Fushimi at Sugahara. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2254"></span>[380:1](kj152.htm#fr_2259.md) *Conf*. Sect. LXIV,
Note 2.

<span id="fn_2255"></span>[380:2](kj152.htm#fr_2260.md) Literally, "Hast
thou anything to think about? "The same construction is used in the next
sentence.

<span id="fn_2256"></span>[380:3](kj152.htm#fr_2261.md) *I.e.*, her son by
her former husband King Oho-kusaka.

<span id="fn_2257"></span>[380:4](kj152.htm#fr_2262.md) Literally, "below
the palace." The same expression recurs further on. The parallel passage
in the "Chronicles" has "below the upper storey," *i.e.*, in the court
or garden of a two-storeyed house. With the small proportions assumed by
Japanese architecture, conversation could well be overheard under these
conditions.

<span id="fn_2258"></span>[380:5](kj152.htm#fr_2263.md) *I.e.*, "take
vengeance upon me."

<span id="fn_2259"></span>[381:6](kj152.htm#fr_2264.md) *Scil*. by the
Emperor's side.

<span id="fn_2260"></span>[381:7](kj152.htm#fr_2265.md) *Tsubura omi*. The
etymology of Tsubura is obscure.

<span id="fn_2261"></span>[381:8](kj152.htm#fr_2266.md) For Sugahara see
Sect. LXXV, Note I. The Fushimi here mentioned, which is in Yamato, must
not be confounded with the better known Fushimi in Yamashiro. The
popular etymology of this name (and it is to be found in many books)
traces it to *Fushi mi*, *i.e.*, "lying three," in connection with the
story of a man who "lay on the mound for three years." Probably
*fuse-midzu*, "water laid on," a name perhaps given on account of an
aqueduct or of water-pipes, was the original designation, which has been
corrupted.
