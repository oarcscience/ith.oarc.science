## \[SECT. LXXVII.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART II.—THE MAIDENS YE-HIME AND OTO-HIME).\]

Hereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, to assure himself of what he had heard
of the beauty of the two maidens Ye-hime and Oto-hime, <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1](#fn_1551) daughters of King Kamu-ohone, <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[2](#fn_1552) ancestor of the Rulers of the Land of
Minu, <span id="fr_1557"></span>[3](#fn_1553) sent his august child, His
Augustness Oho-usu, to summon them up \[to the Capital\]. So His
Augustness Oho-usu who had been sent, instead of summoning them up,
forthwith wedded both the maidens himself, and then sought other women,
to whom he falsely gave the maidens' names, and sent them up \[to his
father\]. Hereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, knowing them to be other
women, frequently subjected them to his long glances; <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[4](#fn_1554) but, never wedding them, caused them
to sorrow. So the child that His Augustness Oho-usu begot on wedding
Ye-hime, \[205\] was King Oshi-kuro-no-ye-hiko <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[5](#fn_1555) (<span class="small">he was the
ancestor of the Lords of Unesu in Minu.</span>) <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[6](#fn_1556) Again, the child that he begot on
wedding Oto-hime, was King Oshi-kuro-no-oto-hiko (he was the ancestor of
the Dukes of Mugetsu.) <span id="fr_1561"></span>[7](#fn_1557)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1551"></span>[253:1](kj084.htm#fr_1555) <span
id="page_253">p. 253</span> *I.e.*, the elder princess and the younger
princess.

<span id="fn_1552"></span>[253:2](kj084.htm#fr_1556) See Sect. LXII,
Note 36.

<span id="fn_1553"></span>[253:3](kj084.htm#fr_1557) *Minu no kuni no
miyatsuko*.

<span id="fn_1554"></span>[253:4](kj084.htm#fr_1558) *I.e.*, "gazed at
them intently." The Classical word *nagamuru*, "to gaze," is properly a
compound of *naga*, "long," and *miru*, "to see."

<span id="fn_1555"></span>[253:5](kj084.htm#fr_1559) The meaning of the
syllables *oshi* in this name and the companion one (*Oshi-kuro no oto
hiko*) immediately below is probably "great;" *kuro* is obscure;
*ye-hiko* signifies "elder prince" and *oto-hiko* "younger prince."

<span id="fn_1556"></span>[253:6](kj084.htm#fr_1560) *Mimi no Unesu no
wake*. Of Unesu nothing is known.

<span id="fn_1557"></span>[253:7](kj084.htm#fr_1561) *Mugetsu no kimi*.
Mugetsu or Muge was in the province of Mini (Mino).
