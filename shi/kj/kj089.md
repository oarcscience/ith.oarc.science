## \[SECT. LXXXII.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART VII.—YAMATO-TAKE IS SENT TO SUBDUE THE EAST, AND VISITS HIS AUNT AT ISE).\]

Then the Heavenly Sovereign again urged a command on His Augustness
Yamato-take, saying: "Subdue and pacify the savage Deities and likewise
the unsubmissive people of the twelve roads of the East;" <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1](#fn_1590.md) and when he sent him off, joining to
him Prince Mi-suki-tomo-mimi-take, <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[2](#fn_1591.md) ancestor of the Grandees of
Kibi, <span id="fr_1596"></span>[3](#fn_1592.md) he bestowed on \[210\] him
a holly-wood <span id="fr_1597"></span>[4](#fn_1593.md) spear eight fathoms
\[long\]. So when he had received the \[Imperial\] command and started
off, he went into the temple of the Great August Deity of Ise, and
worshipped the Deity's court, <span id="fr_1598"></span>[5](#fn_1594.md)
forthwith speaking to his aunt, Her Augustness Yamato-hime, saying: "It
must surely be that the Heavenly Sovereign thinks <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[6](#fn_1595.md) I may die quickly; for after sending
me to smite the wicked people of the West, I am no sooner come up again
\[to the capital\] than, without bestowing on me an army, he now sends
me off afresh to pacify the wicked people of the twelve circuits of the
East. Consequently I think that he certainly thinks I shall die
quickly." When he departed with lamentations and tears, Her Augustness
Yamato-hime bestowed on him the "Herb-Quelling-Sabre," <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[7](#fn_1596.md) and likewise bestowed on him an august
bag, <span id="fr_1601"></span>[8](#fn_1597.md) and said: "If there should
be an emergency, open the mouth of the bag."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1590"></span>[260:1](kj089.htm#fr_1594.md) <span
id="page_260">p. 260</span> See Sect. LXVI. Note 2.

<span id="fn_1591"></span>[260:2](kj089.htm#fr_1595.md)
*Mi-suki-tomo-mini-take-hiko*. *Mi* is an [Honorific](errata.htm#51.md),
*mimi* probably signifies "ears," and *take* means "bravo." The words
*suki* and *tomo* are obscure.

<span id="fn_1592"></span>[260:3](kj089.htm#fr_1596.md) *Kibi na omi*.

<span id="fn_1593"></span>[260:4](kj089.htm#fr_1597.md) Properly the *Olea
aquifolium*, which resembles holly. Motowori <span id="page_261">p.
261</span> supposes that an entirely wooden spear or stick is here meant
to be spoken of, and not the weapon with a metal point which is commonly
understood by the word "spear" (*hoko*).

<span id="fn_1594"></span>[260:5](kj089.htm#fr_1598.md) Perhaps we should
write "august court," for the characters <span id="img_26100"></span>
![](img/26100.jpg) in the text are evidently intended for the homonymous
<span id="img_26101"></span> ![](img/26101.jpg). The court in front of
the Deity's temple is what is here alluded to, and it would perhaps be a
not unpardonable departure from the text to insert the Preposition "at,"
or "in," and translate thus: "worshipped in the Deity's court."

<span id="fn_1595"></span>[260:6](kj089.htm#fr_1599.md) Here and below, the
word "thinks," may be understood to mean "wishes."

<span id="fn_1596"></span>[260:7](kj089.htm#fr_1600.md) *Kusa-nagi no
tsurugi*. The discovery of this sword by the deity Susa-no wo
("Impetuous Male") inside one of the tails of the eight-headed serpent
which he had slain, is narrated at the end of Sect. XVIII.

<span id="fn_1597"></span>[260:8](kj089.htm#fr_1601.md) The use of the
contents of this bag will be seen in the next Section.
