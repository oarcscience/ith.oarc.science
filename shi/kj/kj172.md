## \[SECT. CLXV.—EMPEROR SEI-NEI ([PART III](errata.htm#113).—THE GRANDEE SHIBI). <span id="fr_2374"></span>[1](#fn_2369.md)\]

So when the government of the Empire was about to be assumed, <span
id="fr_2375"></span>[2](#fn_2370.md) the Grandee Shibi, <span
id="fr_2376"></span>[3](#fn_2371.md) ancestor of the Grandees of
Heguri <span id="fr_2377"></span>[4](#fn_2372.md) mixed in the Songs, and
took the hand of the beautiful person whom His Augustness Woke was about
to wed. This maiden was a daughter of one of the Headmen of Uda, <span
id="fr_2378"></span>[5](#fn_2373.md) and her name was Ofuwo. <span
id="fr_2379"></span>[6](#fn_2374.md) Then His Augustness Woke likewise
mixed in the Song-Hedge. <span id="fr_2380"></span>[7](#fn_2375.md)
Thereupon the Grandee Shibi sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

\(iv\) "The further fin of the roof of the great palace is bent down at
the corner." <span id="fr_2381"></span>[8](#fn_2376.md)

</div>

When he had thus sung, and requested the conclusion

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

of the Song, His Augustness Woke sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

\(v\) "It is on account of the great carpenter's \[331\] awkwardness
that it is bent down at the corner." <span
id="fr_2382"></span>[9](#fn_2377.md)

</div>

Then the Grandee Shibi sang again, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(viii)"The great lord, on account of the magnanimity of his heart, does
not enter and stand in the eight-fold hedge of branches of the child of
a grandee." <span id="fr_2383"></span>[10](#fn_2378.md)

</div>

Hereupon the Prince sang again, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

\(i\) "Looking on the breakers of the briny current, I see my spouse
standing by the fin of the tunny that comes sporting."

</div>

Then the Grandee Shibi, getting more and more angry sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

\(ix\) "\[Though\] the eight-fold hedge of branches of the Prince the
Great Lord be made fast at eight places, be made fast all round, ’tis a
hedge that shall be cut, ’tis a hedge that shall be burnt." <span
id="fr_2384"></span>[11](#fn_2379.md)

</div>

Then the Prince again sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

\(ii\) "Oh fisherman that spearest the tunny, the great fish! He being
\[there\], thou must be sad at heart, tunny-spearing fisherman!" <span
id="fr_2385"></span>[12](#fn_2380.md)

</div>

Having thus sung, the feast was concluded at dawn, \[332\] and they all
retired. Next morning the two Deities, <span
id="fr_2386"></span>[13](#fn_2381.md) His Augustness Ohoke and His
Augustness Woke, took counsel, saying: "All the people of the Court go
to Court in the morning, and assemble at Shibi 's gate at noon. So <span
id="fr_2387"></span>[14](#fn_2382.md) Shibi must surely now be sleeping,
and,

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[333\] moreover
there will be nobody at the gate. So unless it be now, it were hard to
plot against him," <span id="fr_2388"></span>[15](#fn_2383.md)—and
forthwith they at once raised an army, and beleaguered the house of the
Grandee Shibi, and slew him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2369"></span>[412:1](kj172.htm#fr_2374.md) <span
id="page_414">p. 414</span> The student should compare the version of
the story in this Sect. with that give in the "Chronicles of Japan,"
where it is placed some years later at the commencement of the reign of
the Emperor Mu-retsu, and not only do many of the details disagree, but
the arrangement and number of the Songs is different. It is impossible
to make a consistent whole out of the story as here given; so, while
noticing the linguistic peculiarities of each of the Songs in the order
in which they appear in the present text, the translator has thought it
advisable, following Moribe, to give in Note 12 a consistent scheme of
interpretation for the whole. The small Roman numbers placed in brackets
at the commencement of each Song indicate its place in the text as
restored by Moribe.

<span id="fn_2370"></span>[412:2](kj172.htm#fr_2375.md) By one or other of
the two Princes Ohoke and Woke. "Each," we are afterwards told, "ceded
the Empire to the other," and it therefore remained for some time
uncertain which was to be the Sovereign.

<span id="fn_2371"></span>[412:3](kj172.htm#fr_2376.md) *Shibi no omi*. In
some of the Songs that follow there is a play on the identity of this
name with that of the tunny-fish (*shibi*). But whether that be really
the derivation it is difficult to ascertain.

<span id="fn_2372"></span>[412:4](kj172.htm#fr_2377.md) *Heguri no omi*.
Conf. Sect. LXI, Note 45.

<span id="fn_2373"></span>[412:5](kj172.htm#fr_2378.md) *Uda no obito-ra*.
*Uda* is the name of a place in Yamato.

<span id="fn_2374"></span>[412:6](kj172.htm#fr_2379.md) *I.e.*, "big fish."
But see the remark on this name in Note 12.

<span id="fn_2375"></span>[412:7](kj172.htm#fr_2380.md) *Uta-gaki*. The
derivation of this curious expression is disputed; but the meaning seems
to be "strophic" or "choric song," or "a place where singing in which
more than one takes part is going on."

<span id="fn_2376"></span>[412:8](kj172.htm#fr_2381.md) In this Song the
"further fin" (*woto tsu hata-de*, explained by the characters <span
id="img_41400"></span> ![](img/41400.jpg) or <span
id="img_41401"></span> ![](img/41401.jpg) is supposed to signify a
pent-roof, or the eaves of the roof, or else an out-house connected by a
slanting roof with the main building. The "great palace" is the palace
of Prince Woke.

<span id="fn_2377"></span>[413:9](kj172.htm#fr_2382.md) The "great
carpenter" is the carpenter employed to build the roof above-mentioned.

<span id="fn_2378"></span>[413:10](kj172.htm#fr_2383.md) The "eight-fold
hedge of branches" is simply a "hedge," and the "child of a grandee" the
Grandee Shibi himself.

<span id="fn_2379"></span>[413:11](kj172.htm#fr_2384.md) <span
id="page_415">p. 415</span> The words "made fast" refer to the tying of
the fence at certain places to give it strength. If we accepted Moribe's
emendation of the final Verb *yakemu*, "burn," to *yaremu*, we should
have to translate the last clause thus: "’tis a fence that shall be
broken."

<span id="fn_2380"></span>[413:12](kj172.htm#fr_2385.md) "The great fish"
(*ofuwo yo shi*) is the Pillow-Word for *shibi*, "tunny." The word "he"
(which might also be rendered "*it*,"—the original being (*so*) must be
taken to refer both to the fish itself and to the Grandee Shibi (*i.e.*,
the grandee Tunny), who bore its name.—Following Moribe's acceptable
restoration of the original story, which is founded on a comparison of
the text of these "Records" with that of the "Chronicles of Japan," we
find that in the first Song of the series the young Prince half jokingly
remarks on the fact of the Grandee Shibi appearing in public with the
damsel who was to have been his (the Prince's) bride. Shibi's name,
which, as already stated, signifies "tunny," furnishes the occasion for
the marine metaphors borrowed from the current and the breakers. Shibi's
answer (Song II,—in the "Records" wrongly ascribed to the prince), takes
up the same strain, but in a more [daunting](errata.htm#114.md) tone: the
prince is likened to a fisherman who would fain make a futile attempt to
spear the great tunny, and his (the tunny's, *i.e.*, the Grandee
Shibi's) presence must indeed be pain and grief to him. In a third Song.
which is given in the "Chronicles," but not in the "Records," the prince
retorts that he relies on his good sword to win the girl for him in the
end, and in Song IV the Grandee jeers at the dilapidated condition of
his palace, and by implication at the sorry state of his fortunes,—a
taunt to which the prince replies in Song V by saying that if the palace
is dilapidated, and the Empire in disorder, the fault belongs to none
other than to the Grandee [himself](errata.htm#115.md). Songs VI and VII,
which are not found in the "Records," only serve to continue the growing
war of words, which in Song VII (in the "[Records](errata.htm#116.md)"
wrongly attributed to the Grandee) comes to a climax by the prince
exclaiming that if he does not force his way into the Grandee's mansion
to seize his lady-love, it is only on account of the magnanimity of his
disposition. To this the Grandee replies in Song IX (in the "Records"
erroneously attributed to the prince) by a sort of *tu quoque*, vowing
that he will cut and burn his way into the prince's palace. This is not
the end of the dispute in the pages of the "Chronicles," but it is all
that need detain the reader of the "Records." It should, however, be
mentioned that in the "Chronicles" the name of the girl is *Kage-hime*:
*Ofuwo* "Big Fish," which is here given, would seem to be nothing more
<span id="page_416">p. 416</span> than a nickname, which perhaps arose
from the incidents of this metrics war of words.

<span id="fn_2381"></span>[413:13](kj172.htm#fr_2386.md) The word used in
the original is *hashira*, the Auxiliary Numeral for Deities. It recurs
at the commencement of the next Section, where however it is not
convenient to translate it.

<span id="fn_2382"></span>[413:14](kj172.htm#fr_2387.md) The original here
has the character <span id="img_41600"></span> ![](img/41600.jpg),
"again'' or "moreover." But this must be, as Motowori points
[to](errata.htm#117.md) a copyist's error, Almost immediately below the
same character recurs where it is equally out of place. The translator
has followed Motowori in rendering it the first time by "so," and the
second by "surely."

<span id="fn_2383"></span>[414:15](kj172.htm#fr_2388.md) *I.e.*, There is
no time like the present for plotting against him.
