## \[SECT. [CXXII](errata.htm#82).—EMPEROR NIN-TOKU (PART IV.—HE LOVES PRINCESS KURO.md).\]

His Empress, Her Augustness Iha-no-hime, was exceedingly jealous. So the
concubines employed by the Heavenly Sovereign could not even peep inside
the palace; and if anything happened, <span
id="fr_2054"></span>[1](#fn_2049.md) \[the Empress\] stamped with jealousy.
Then the Heavenly Sovereign, hearing of the regular beauty of Princess
Kuro, <span id="fr_2055"></span>[2](#fn_2050.md) daughter of the Suzerain
of Ama in Kibi, <span id="fr_2056"></span>[3](#fn_2051.md) and having sent
for her, employed her. But she, afraid of the Empress's jealousy, fled
down to her native land, The Heavenly \[271\] Sovereign, gazing from an
upper story upon Princess Kuro's departure by boat upon the sea, sang
saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"In the offing there are rows of small boats. My wife Masadzuko of
Kurozaki goes down towards her \[native\] land." <span
id="fr_2057"></span>[4](#fn_2052.md)

</div>

So the Empress was very angry on hearing this august Song, and sent
people to the great strand <span id="fr_2058"></span>[5](#fn_2053.md) to
drive Princess Kuro ashore, and chase her away on foot. <span
id="fr_2059"></span>[6](#fn_2054.md) Thereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, for
love of Princess Kuro, deceived the Empress, saying that he wanted to
see the Island of Ahaji. <span id="fr_2060"></span>[7](#fn_2055.md) And
when he made his progress

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

and was in the Island of Ahaji, he, gazing afar, sang saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"When, having departed from the point of wave-beaten Naniha, I look at
the country,—the Island of Aha, the Is-land of Onogoro, and also the
Island of Ajimasa are visible. The Island of Saketsu is visible." <span
id="fr_2061"></span>[8](#fn_2056.md)

</div>

Forthwith passing on from that island, he made a progress to the land of
Kibi. Then Her Augustness Princess Kuro- made him grandly reside at a
place among the mountain-fields, <span id="fr_2062"></span>[9](#fn_2057.md)
and presented to him great august food, When for this \[purpose\] she
plucked cabbage in that place to boil into great august soup, the
Heavenly Sovereign went to the place where the maiden was plucking the
cabbage, and sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Oh! how delightful it is to pluck with a person of Kibi the cabbage
sown in the mountain fields!" <span id="fr_2063"></span>[10](#fn_2058.md)

</div>

When the Heavenly Sovereign made his progress up, <span
id="fr_2064"></span>[11](#fn_2059.md)

Princess Kuro presented an august <span
id="fr_2065"></span>[12](#fn_2060.md) Song saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Even though the west wind blow up towards Yamato, and the clouds part,
and we be separated, shall I forget \[thee\]?" <span
id="fr_2066"></span>[13](#fn_2061.md)

</div>

\[273\] Again she sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Whose spouse is it that goes towards Yamato? Whose spouse is it that
creeps from beneath like hidden water?" <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[14](#fn_2062.md)

</div>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2049"></span>[337:1](kj129.htm#fr_2054.md) Motowori shows by
collating various passages in other ancient works that this is the
probable signification of the curious expression in <span
id="page_339">p. 339</span> the original, *kotodateba* (<span
id="img_33900"></span> ![](img/33900.jpg) for <span
id="img_33901"></span> ![](img/33901.jpg)). The reference of course is
to the occurrence of anything noteworthy among the concubines, such as
the birth of a son, etc.

<span id="fn_2050"></span>[337:2](kj129.htm#fr_2055.md) *Kuro-hime*,
*i.e.*, "black princess" probably meaning "black-haired princess."

<span id="fn_2051"></span>[337:3](kj129.htm#fr_2056.md) *Kibi no Ama no
atahe*. Of this family nothing is known. *Ama* signifies "fisherman."
*Kibi* is the name of a province.

<span id="fn_2052"></span>[337:4](kj129.htm#fr_2057.md) Thus interpreted
(according to Moribe), the general sense of the Song is quite clear. The
word *Masadzuko*, considered by Moribe to be one of the names of
Princess Kuro, is however not so understood by Motowori, who is inclined
to see in it rather an Honorific description of her. *Kurozaki* likewise
(*i.e.*, "black cape," the word *kuro* seemingly containing an allusion
to the name of the Princess) is but the best of many emendations of the
name as it stands in the text, viz., *Furozaya*. See Motowori's
Commentary, Vol. XXXV. p. 33, for all the possible emendations proposed
by him or his predecessors.

<span id="fn_2053"></span>[337:5](kj129.htm#fr_2058.md) *Scil*, of the
neighbourhood of Naniha. Or possible *Oho-ura* ("Great Strand") should
be taken as the name of a place, though Motowori does not suggest such a
view.

<span id="fn_2054"></span>[337:6](kj129.htm#fr_2059.md) *I.e.*, to make her
perform the journey on foot.

<span id="fn_2055"></span>[337:7](kj129.htm#fr_2060.md) See Sect. V, Note
3.

<span id="fn_2056"></span>[338:8](kj129.htm#fr_2061.md) Moribe, commenting
on the import of this Song, says: Though the alleged reason was a tour
of inspection, it was truly out of love for Princess Kuro that the
Monarch had undertaken the journey. When her vessel could no longer be
descried, he could still alas! see the islands that remained behind,—the
Island of Aha and the Island of Ajimasa; he could still, alas! see the
Islands of Onogoro and Saketsu. Alas for him left alone, parted from his
love! Though he spoke not openly, those around him understood the
under-current of his "words."—"Wave-beaten "is the accepted
interpretation of *oshiteru ya* (or *oshiteru*), the Pillow-Word for
Naniha. For the Islands of Aha and Onogoro see respectively Sect. IV,
Note 5 and Sect. iii, Note 5. Of the Islands of Ajimasa and Saketsu
nothing is known. *Ajimasa* is the name of a species of palm, the
*Livistona sinensis*, and Motowori supposes that one of the islands in
that neighbourhood may anciently have received its name from the
palm-trees growing on it. Palms of any kind are, however, not very
common in Japan, and seem only to grow when specially cultivated.

<span id="fn_2057"></span>[338:9](kj129.htm#fr_2062.md) Motowori thinks we
should in this place understand the word *yamagata* (for *yama-agata*)
as the name of a place. But in the Song <span id="page_340">p.
340</span> which immediately follows, it must certainly be taken in its
etymological sense of "mountain-fields," and it seems therefore quite
inconsistent to translate it differently here. Moreover it is allowed
that no such place as Yamagata in Kibi is anywhere made mention of.

<span id="fn_2058"></span>[338:10](kj129.htm#fr_2063.md) The import of this
Song is perfectly clear, "the person of Kibi "being of course the
Imperial poet's lady-love.

<span id="fn_2059"></span>[338:11](kj129.htm#fr_2064.md) *I.e.*, was about
to start back to the capital, which was in the province of Settsu.

<span id="fn_2060"></span>[338:12](kj129.htm#fr_2065.md) This Honorific
seems so out of place (seeing that it is not applied to the Emperor's
own Songs given in this Section), that it is supposed by the
commentators to be an erroneous addition to the text.

<span id="fn_2061"></span>[338:13](kj129.htm#fr_2066.md) We might also
translate thus: "Even though we be separated, as the clouds that part
owing to the west wind blowing up towards Yamato, etc.;"—for the initial
lines of the poem which contain the allusion to the wind and to the
clouds are simply a Preface, and their import may therefore at will be
either considered separately, or else made continuous with that of the
rest of the poem.

<span id="fn_2062"></span>[338:14](kj129.htm#fr_2067.md) The meaning of
this Song l is: "Whose spouse is it that returns to Yamato? Whose spouse
is it that comes thus secretly to make love to me, like a stream flowing
underground?"—The allusion contained in the twice repeated words "whose
spouse "is of course to the Empress. The poetess, full of tenderness or
the Emperor, regrets for his sake, as well as for her own, that he
should be the husband of so jealous' a wife. "Hidden water is the
accepted interpretation of the Pillow-Word *kontoridzu no*, which is
with apparent reason supposed to be a contraction of *komori-midzu no*.
