## \[SECT. LXVII.—EMPEROR SŪ-JIN (PART V.—PEACE RESTORED AND TRIBUTE LEVIED).\]

So His Augustness Oho-biko went away to Koshi in accordance with the
previous \[Imperial\] commands. Then Take-nuna-kaha-wake, who had been
sent round by the east, and his father Oho-biko met together in Ahidzu.
So the place was called by the name of Ahidzu. <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1](#fn_1369) Wherefore, each of them, having
settled the government of the land to which he had been sent, made his
report \[to the Heavenly Sovereign\]. Then the Empire was at peace and
the people prosperous. Thereupon tribute on the arrow-notches of the men
and tribute on the finger-tips of the women was first levied. <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[2](#fn_1370) So in praise of this august reign they
said: "The Heavenly Sovereign Mimaki, who ruled the first land." <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[3](#fn_1371) Again, in this reign the Pool of
Yosami <span id="fr_1376"></span>[4](#fn_1372) was made; moreover the
Pool of Sakawori at Karu <span id="fr_1377"></span>[5](#fn_1373) was
made.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1369"></span>[224:1](kj074.htm#fr_1373) A district forming
the southern part of the modern province of Ihashiro in north-eastern
Japan. The derivation here given, from *ahi-dzu* "meeting port," seems
fanciful.

<span id="fn_1370"></span>[224:2](kj074.htm#fr_1374) *I.e.*, taxes
levied on the produce of the chase, by which the men gained their
livelihood, and on the domestic handwork of the women.

<span id="fn_1371"></span>[224:3](kj074.htm#fr_1375) <span
id="page_225">p. 225</span> Motowori has a not particularly satisfactory
note, in which he endeavours to explain this obscure phrase. The word
"first" should evidently qualify the Verb "ruled," and not the
Substantive "land," and the applicability of the saying to a sovereign,
of whom it is not recorded that he initiated anything save the taxes, is
not apparent. The author of the "Chronicles" observes the
verisimilitudes better by applying a synonymous designation to the first
"Earthly Emperor" Jim-mu.

<span id="fn_1372"></span>[224:4](kj074.htm#fr_1376) See Sect. LXII,
Note 85.

<span id="fn_1373"></span>[224:5](kj074.htm#fr_1377) Reference to the
parallel passage of the "Chronicles" shows that probably a couple of
words are here omitted from the text, which should read "the Pool of
Karu and the Pool of Sakawori" (*Karu no ike, Sakawori no ike*). Karu is
the celebrated ancient capital mentioned in Sect. LVII, Note 1, Sakawori
is quite unknown except from this notice of it, and the derivation of
the name is uncertain.
