## \[SECT. LXXIX.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART IV.—YAMATO-TAKE SLAYS HIS ELDER BROTHER).\]

The Heavenly Sovereign said to His Augustness Wo-usu: "Why does not
thine elder brother come forth to the morning and evening great august
repasts? <span id="fr_1565"></span>[1b](#fn_1561.md) Be thou the one to
take the trouble to teach him \[his duty\]." Thus he commanded; but for
five days after, still \[the prince\] came not forth. Then the Heavenly
Sovereign deigned to ask His Augustness Wo-usu \[saying\]: "Why is thine
elder brother so long of coming? Hast thou perchance not yet taught him
\[his duty\]?" He replied, \[206\] saying: "I have been at that
trouble." Again \[the Heavenly Sovereign\] said "How didst thou take the

trouble?" <span id="fr_1566"></span>[2a](#fn_1562.md) He replied, saying:
"In the early morning when he went into the privy, I grasped hold of him
and crushed him, and, pulling off his limbs, <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[3a](#fn_1563.md) wrapped them in matting and flung
them away."
