## \[SECT. CLXIII.—EMPEROR SEI-NEI (PART I.—SEARCH FOR A SUCCESSOR TO HIM).\]

His Augustness Shiraka-no-oho-yamato-ne-ko dwelt at the palace of
Mikakuri at Ihare, <span id="fr_2361"></span>[1a](#fn_2356.md) and ruled
the Empire. This Heavenly Sovereign had no Empress, and likewise no
august children. So the Shiraka-Clan <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2](#fn_2357.md) was established as his august proxy.
So after the Heavenly Sovereign's decease, there was no King to rule the
Empire. Thereupon, on enquiry \[being made\] for a King who should rule
the sun's succession, Oshinumi-no-iratsume, <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[3](#fn_2358.md) another name for whom was Princess
Ihi-toyo, younger sister of Prince Ichinobe-oshiha-wake, <span
id="fr_2364"></span>[4](#fn_2359.md) \[was found to be\] residing at the
palace of Tsunusashi at Takaki in Oshinumi in Kadzuraki. <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[5](#fn_2360.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2356"></span>[409:1a](kj170.htm#fr_2361.md) For Ihare see
Sect. XLIII, Note 26. *Mika-kuri* signifies "jar-chestnut."

<span id="fn_2357"></span>[409:2](kj170.htm#fr_2362.md) *Shiraka-be*.

<span id="fn_2358"></span>[409:3](kj170.htm#fr_2363.md) In Sect. CXXXI
(Note 7) this name appears as *Awomi-no-iratsume*. Both *Awomi* and
*Oshinumi* are supposed to be names of places. The latter is the name of
a district in Yamato. Its etymology is obscure. For *Ihi-toyo* see Sect.
CXXXI, Note 8.

<span id="fn_2359"></span>[409:4](kj170.htm#fr_2364.md) See Sect. CXXXI
(Note 5), where however the title of *wake* ("Lord") is omitted.

<span id="fn_2360"></span>[409:5](kj170.htm#fr_2365.md) For *Kadzuraki* see
Sect. LV, Note 1, and for Oshinumi see Note 3 to the present Sect.
*Takaki* seems to signify "high castle," while *Tsunusashi* is obscure.
(See Motowori's remarks on these two names in Vol. XLIII, p. 3 of his
Commentary.)
