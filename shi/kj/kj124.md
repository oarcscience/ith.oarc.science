### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1994"></span>[329:1](kj124.htm#fr_1999) <span
id="page_330">p. 330</span> *I.e.*, the Emperor Ō-jin's.

<span id="fn_1995"></span>[329:2](kj124.htm#fr_2000) The import of this
compound is not clear.

<span id="fn_1996"></span>[329:3](kj124.htm#fr_2001) *I.e.*, "the 
younger princess, the truly young princess."

<span id="fn_1997"></span>[329:4](kj124.htm#fr_2002) *i.e.*, "the great
lord."

<span id="fn_1998"></span>[329:5](kj124.htm#fr_2003) *Oho-hodo no miko*.
The signification of *Oho-hodo* is obscure. Motowori surmises it to have
been originally the name of a place.

<span id="fn_1999"></span>[329:6](kj124.htm#fr_2004) *I.e.*, "the great
middle princess of Osaka. Osaka is the name of a place in Yamato. The
word "middle "should by the analogy of other such genealogies indicate
the fact that this princess was the fourth child out of seven. Here
however she is mentioned second, and the same designation is applied to
the two next daughters. There is evidently some confusion in the
tradition.

<span id="fn_2000"></span>[330:7](kj124.htm#fr_2005) *I.e.*, "the middle
princess of Tawi,"—a place in Kahachi.

<span id="fn_2001"></span>[330:8](kj124.htm#fr_2006) *I.e.*, the middle
princess of Tamiya.

<span id="fn_2002"></span>[330:9](kj124.htm#fr_2007) *I.e.*, "the lady
Koto-fushi of Fuji-hara." But the meaning of Kato fushi is obscure, and
Motowori surmises it to be an alternative or corrupt form of
*Sotohoshi*. (For the celebrated princess of the latter name see Sect.
CXXXVII, Note 9.) Fujihara is the name of a place in Yamato, and
signifies "wistaria-moor."

<span id="fn_2003"></span>[330:10](kj124.htm#fr_2008) *Torime no miko*.
This name is obscure.

<span id="fn_2004"></span>[330:11](kj124.htm#fr_2009) *Sane no miko*.
Motowori believes *sane* to stand erroneously for *sami*; but both forms
are obscure.

<span id="fn_2005"></span>[330:12](kj124.htm#fr_2010) The Japanese word
includes both genders.

<span id="fn_2006"></span>[330:13](kj124.htm#fr_2011) <span
id="page_331">p. 331</span> *Mikuni no kimi*. *Mikuni* is the name of a
well-known place in the province of Echizen. It signifies "three
countries."

<span id="fn_2007"></span>[330:14](kj124.htm#fr_2012) *Hata no kimi*.
There are several places called Hata, and it is not known which of them
is here intended. The signification of the name is also uncertain.

<span id="fn_2008"></span>[330:15](kj124.htm#fr_2013) *Okinaga no kimi*.
See Sect. LXII, Note 31.

<span id="fn_2009"></span>[330:16](kj124.htm#fr_2014) *Sakata no
Saka-bito no kimi*. This is Motowori's restoration of an apparently
corrupt text. Sakata and Sakabito are both taken to be names of places,
the first of a district in Afumi, the second of a place in Settsu.
Sakabito (<span id="img_33100"></span> ![](img/33100.jpg)) seems a very
curious compound for the name of a place. Moreover the double title is
unusual, and it may be thought that the word "Dukes" has fallen out of
the text, and that in reality two families were intended to be spoken
of.

<span id="fn_2010"></span>[330:17](kj124.htm#fr_2015) *Yamaji no kimi*.
*Yamaji* ("mountain road") is supposed by Motowori to be the name of a
place,—perhaps in the province of Higo.

<span id="fn_2011"></span>[330:18](kj124.htm#fr_2016) *Tsukushi no Meta
no kimi*. Tsukushi is the old name of the whole of the South-Western
island of the Japanese archipelago and Meta the name of a place in the
province of Hizen in that island. The etymology of Meta is uncertain.

<span id="fn_2012"></span>[330:19](kj124.htm#fr_2017) *Fuse no kimi*.
Fuse is the name of uncertain import found in several provinces. It is
not known which is meant to be here designated.

<span id="fn_2013"></span>[330:20](kj124.htm#fr_2018) *Naka-tsu-hiko no
miko*, *i.e.*, "the middle prince," a designation which would lead one
to expect to find mention of an elder brother.

<span id="fn_2014"></span>[330:21](kj124.htm#fr_2019) *Iwashima no
miko*. Iwashima seems to be the name of a place, but the signification
of *Iha* (not to be confounded with *iha* "stone" or "rock") is
altogether obscure.

<span id="fn_2015"></span>[330:22](kj124.htm#fr_2020) *Katashiha no
miko*. This prince has not been mentioned in the previous genealogies,
which is curious. Katashiha is the name of a place in Chikuzen, and
signifies "hard rock."

<span id="fn_2016"></span>[330:23](kj124.htm#fr_2021) *Kunu no miko*.
*Kunu* is altogether obscure.
