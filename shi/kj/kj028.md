## \[SECT. XXI.—THE WHITE HARE OF INABA.\]

So this Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land had eighty Deities his brethren;
but they all left the land to the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land. The
reason for their leaving it was this: Each of these eighty Deities had
in his heart the wish to marry the Princess of Yakami <span
id="fr_476"></span>[1](#fn_472) in Inaba, <span
id="fr_477"></span>[2](#fn_473) and they went together to Inaba, putting
their bag on \[the back of\] the Deity Great-Name-Possessor, whom they
took with them as an attendant. Hereupon. when they arrived at Cape
Keta, <span id="fr_478"></span>[3](#fn_474) \[they found\] a naked hare
lying down. Then the eighty Deities spoke to the hare, saying: "What
thou shouldest do is to bathe in the sea-water here, and lie on the
slope of a high mountain exposed to the blowing of the wind." So the
hare followed the instructions of the eighty Deities, and lay down.
Then, as the sea-water dried, the skin of its body all split with the
blowing of the wind, so that it lay weeping with pain. But the Deity
Great-Name-Possessor, who came last of all, saw the hare, and said: "Why
liest thou weeping?" The hare replied, saying: "I was in the Island of
Oki, <span id="fr_479"></span>[4](#fn_475) and wished to cross over to
this land, but had no means of crossing over. For this reason \[69\] I
deceived the crocodiles <span id="fr_480"></span>[5](#fn_476) of the
sea, saying: 'Let you

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

and me compete, and compute the numbers of our \[respective\] tribes. So
do you go and fetch every member of your tribe, and make them all lie in
a row across from this island to Cape Keta. Then I will tread on them,
and count them as I run across. Hereby shall we know whether it or my
tribe is the larger.' Upon my speaking thus, they were deceived and lay
down in a row, and I trod on them and counted them as I came across, and
was just about to get on land, when I said: 'You have been deceived by
me.' As soon as I had finished speaking, the crocodile who lay the last
of all seized me and stripped off all my clothing. As I was weeping and
lamenting for this reason, the eighty Deities who went by before
\[thee\] commanded and exhorted me, saying: 'Bathe in the salt water,
and lie down exposed to the wind.' So, on my doing as they had
instructed me, my whole body was hurt." Thereupon the Deity
Great-Name-Possessor instructed the hare, saying: "Go quickly now to the
river-mouth, wash thy body with the fresh water, then take the pollen of
the sedges \[growing\] at the river-mouth, spread it about, and roll
about upon it, whereupon thy body will certainly be restored to its
original state." <span id="fr_481"></span>[6](#fn_477) So \[the hare\]
did as it was instructed, and its body became as it had been originally.
This was the White Hare of Inaba. <span id="fr_482"></span>[7](#fn_478)
It is now called the Hare Deity. So the hare said to the Deity
Great-Name-Possessor: "These eighty Deities shall certainly not get the
Princess of Yakami. Though thou bearest the bag, Thine Augustness shall
obtain her."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_472"></span>[81:1](kj028.htm#fr_476) <span id="page_82">p.
82</span> *Yakami-hime*. The etymology is uncertain.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[81:2](kj028.htm#fr_477) The name of a province
not far from that of Idzumo. The word may possibly, as Motowori
suggests, be derived from *ina-ba*, "rice-leaves."

<span id="fn_474"></span>[81:3](kj028.htm#fr_478) <span id="page_83">p.
83</span> *Kita-no-saki*. The etymology of the name seems uncertain. The
meaning of the word *keta* is "the beams of a roof, the yards of a
sail." But perhaps *Keta* and *keta* may be nothing more than homonyms
of independent origin.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[81:4](kj028.htm#fr_479) Not far from the coast
of Idzumo and of Inaba.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[81:5](kj028.htm#fr_480) See Translator's
Introduction, [p. xxxiii](kj004.htm#page_xxxiii), Note 41.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[82:6](kj028.htm#fr_481) Literally "to its
original skin"; that is to say that its skin would again be covered with
fur.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[82:7](kj028.htm#fr_482) Motowori and Moribe
agree in considering that the word "white" means "bare" in this place,
and the latter in his Critique of the former's Commentary quotes
examples which show that their view is probably correct.
