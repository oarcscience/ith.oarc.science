## \[SECT. VIII.—THE SLAYING OF THE FIRE-DEITY.\]

Then His Augustness the Male-Who-invites, drawing the ten-grasp
sabre <span id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_235) that was augustly girded on
him, \[32\] cut off the head of his child the Deity Shining-Elder.
Hereupon the names of the Deities that were born from the blood that
stuck to the point of the august sword

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

and bespattered the multitudinous rock-misses were: the Deity
Rock-Splitter, <span id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_236) next the Deity
Root-Splitter, next the Rock-Possessing-Male-Deity. <span
id="fr_237"></span>[3](#fn_237) The names of the Deities that were next
born from the blood that stuck to the upper part <span
id="fr_238"></span>[4](#fn_238) of the august sword and again
bespattered the multitudinous rock-masses were: the
Awfully-Swift-Deity, <span id="fr_239"></span>[5](#fn_239) next the
Fire-Swift-Deity, <span id="fr_240"></span>[6](#fn_240) next the
Brave-Awful-Possessing-Male-Deity, <span id="fr_241"></span>[7](#fn_241)
another name for whom is the Brave-Snapping-Deity, <span
id="fr_242"></span>[8](#fn_242) and another name is the
Luxuriant-Snapping Deity. The names of the Deities that were next born
from the blood that collected \[33\] on the hilt of the august sword and
leaked out between his fingers were: the Deity *Kura-okami* and next the
Deity *Kura-mitsuha*. <span id="fr_243"></span>[9](#fn_243)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

All the eight Deities in the above list, from the Deity Rock-Splitter to
the Deity *Kura-mitsuha*, are Deities that were born from the august
sword.

The name of the Deity that was born from the head of the Deity

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_235"></span>[35:1](kj015.htm#fr_235) <span id="page_37">p.
37</span> One "grasp" is defined as "the breadth of four fingers when
the hand is clenched," so that the meaning intended to be conveyed is of
a big sabre ten hand-breadths long. The length of sabres and of beards
was measured by such "grasps" or "hand-breadths."

<span id="fn_236"></span>[36:2](kj015.htm#fr_236) The original names of
this deity and the next are *Iha-saku-no-kami* and *Ne-saki-no-kami*.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[36:3](kj015.htm#fr_237) Or the Rock-Elder,
*i.e.*, the Male Deity the Elder of the Rocks, if with Motowori we
regard the second *tsu* of the original name *Iha-tsutsu-no-wo-no-kami*
as being equivalent to *chi* or *ji*, supposed to be "the honorific
appellation of males" elsewhere rendered "elder." The translation in the
text proceeds on the assumption that this *tsu* represents *mochi*: The
purport of the name remains much the same whichever of these two views
be adopted.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[36:4](kj015.htm#fr_238) Explained by reference
to the parallel passage of the "Chronicles" through a character
signifying "the knob at the end of the guard of the sword.'—(Williams'
"Syllabic Dictionary.")

<span id="fn_239"></span>[36:5](kj015.htm#fr_239)
*Mika-haya-bi-no-kami*. Motowori seems to be right in regarding *mika*
as equivalent to *ika*, the root of *ikameshiki*, "stern," "awful," and
*bi* as the root of *buru*, a verbalising suffix.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[36:6](kj015.htm#fr_240) *Hi-haya-bi-no-kami*.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[36:7](kj015.htm#fr_241)
*Take-mika-dzu-chi-no-wo-no-kami*, written with the characters <span
id="img_03700"></span> ![](img/03700.jpg). The translator has without
much hesitation followed Motowori's interpretation.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[36:8](kj015.htm#fr_242) *Take-futsu-no-kami*.
The text name is *Toyo-futsu-no-kami*. *Futsu* is interpreted in the
sense of "the sound of snapping" by reference to a Passage in the
"Chronicles" where it occurs written both ideographically and
phonetically in the name of the deity *Futsu-no-mi-tama*.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[36:9](kj015.htm#fr_243) The etymology of both
these name is obscure. *Kura*, the first element of each compound,
signifies "dark."

<span id="fn_244"></span>[36:10](kj015.htm#fr_244) <span id="page_38">p.
38</span> This is the explanation of the original name
*Ma-saka-yama-tsu-mi-no-kami* which is given in the "Secret of the
Chronicles of Japan," and is approved by the later commentators.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[36:11](kj015.htm#fr_245)
*Odo-yama-tsu-mi-no-kami*. The English rendering is uncertain, as it
rests only on a conjecture of Motowori's, deriving *odo* from *ori do*
(<span id="img_03800"></span> ![](img/03800.jpg)), "descending place,"
"way down."

<span id="fn_246"></span>[36:12](kj015.htm#fr_246) The original names of
this and the following five deities are: *Oku-yama-tsumi-no-kami*,
*Kura-yama-tsu-mi-no-kami*, *Shigi-yama-tsu-mi-no-kami*,
*Ha-yama-tsu-mi-no-kami*, *Hayama-tsu-mi-no-kami* and
*To-yama-tsumi-no-kami*. *Shigi*, here translated "dense," seems to be
almost certainly a contraction of *Shigeki*, which has that
signification. *Ha-yama* is a term for which it is hard to find an exact
English equivalent. It denotes the lesser hills or first visibly rising
ground forming the approach to an actual mountain-range. The
signification of *to* in the last name of the set is disputed. Mabuchi
takes it in the sense of "gate." The translator prefers Motowori's view:
but after all, the difference in meaning does not amount to much. A
third derivation proposed by Motowori is *tawa-yama*, *i.e.* "mountains
with folds."

<span id="fn_247"></span>[36:13](kj015.htm#fr_248) Or "arm."

<span id="fn_248"></span>[36:14](kj015.htm#fr_249) Or "leg."

<span id="fn_249"></span>[37:14](kj015.htm#fr_250) Or "leg."

<span id="fn_250"></span>[37:15](kj015.htm#fr_251) These two names are
in the original *Ame-no-wo-ha-bori* and *Itsu-no-wo-ha-bori*. Their
import is not absolutely clear, but they seem to designate a weapon
broad towards the point, such as is represented in the illustrations
given in Vol. I, pp. 19-20 and Vol. II, pp. 4-5 of the "*Tokiha-Gusa*."
