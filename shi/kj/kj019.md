## \[SECT. XII.—THE CRYING AND WEEPING OF HIS IMPETUOUS-MALE-AUGUSTNESS.\]

So while \[the other two Deities\] each \[assumed his and her\] rule
according to the command with which \[their father\] had deigned to
charge them, His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness did not \[assume the\]
rule

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[of\] the
dominion with which he had been charged, but cried and wept till his
eight-grasp beard <span id="fr_310"></span>[1](#fn_307) reached to the
pit of his stomach. <span id="fr_311"></span>[2](#fn_308) The fashion of
his weeping was such as by his weeping to wither the green mountains
into withered mountains, and by his weeping to dry up all the rivers and
seas. <span id="fr_312"></span>[3](#fn_309) For this reason the sound of
bad Deities was like unto the flies in the fifth moon <span
id="fr_313"></span>[4](#fn_310) as they all swarmed, <span
id="fr_314"></span>[5](#fn_311) and in all things <span
id="fr_315"></span>[6](#fn_312) every portent of woe arose. So the Great
August Deity the Male-Who-Invites said to His
Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness: "How is it that, instead of ruling the
land with which I charged thee, thou dost wail and weep?" He replied,
saying: "I <span id="fr_316"></span>[7](#fn_313) wail because I wish to
depart to my \[45\] deceased mother's <span
id="fr_317"></span>[8](#fn_314) land, to the Nether Distant Land." <span
id="fr_318"></span>[9](#fn_315) Then the Great August Deity the
Male-Who-Invites was very angry and said: "If that be so, thou shall not
dwell in this land," <span id="fr_319"></span>[10](#fn_316) and
forthwith expelled him with a divine expulsion. So the Great Deity the
Male-Who-Invites dwells at Taga <span id="fr_320"></span>[11](#fn_317)
in Afumi. <span id="fr_321"></span>[12](#fn_318)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_307"></span>[51:1](kj019.htm#fr_310) See Sect. VIII, Note
1.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[51:2](kj019.htm#fr_311) Lit, "in front of his
heart,"

<span id="fn_309"></span>[51:3](kj019.htm#fr_312) *Sic* in the original,
to the perplexity of commentators.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[51:4](kj019.htm#fr_313) "Flies in the fifth
moon" is the received interpretation of the original term *sa-bahe*.
*Conf*. *sa-tsuki*, the old native name for the fifth moon.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[51:5](kj019.htm#fr_314) The text has here the
character <span id="img_05100"></span> ![](img/05100.jpg), "to be full,"
for which Motowori somewhat arbitrarily reads <span
id="img_05101"></span> ![](img/05101.jpg), "to bubble up," taking this
word in the sense of swarming. The translator has endeavoured to
preserve the vagueness of the original Japanese, which leaves it
doubtful at first sight whether the flies or the deities should be
regarded as the logical subject of the Verb. There is an almost
identical passage near the beginning of Sect. XVI.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[51:6](kj019.htm#fr_315) Lit. "a myriad
things," a Chinese phrase for totality.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[51:7](kj019.htm#fr_316) The Chinese character
for the First-Personal Pronoun used here <span id="page_52">p. 52</span>
and below by this deity is the humble one <span id="img_05200"></span>
![](img/05200.jpg) signifying literally "servant" The commentators read
it simply "I."

<span id="fn_314"></span>[51:8](kj019.htm#fr_317) The Japanese
authorities simply read "mother." But the character <span
id="img_05201"></span> ![](img/05201.jpg), which is used in this place,
specially designates a mother who is deceased.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[51:9](kj019.htm#fr_318) *I.e.,* Hades. The
translation follows Motowori's explanation of the original term
*Ne-no-kata-su-kuni*, which is obscure.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[51:10](kj019.htm#fr_319) *I.e.*, say the
commentators, "in this realm of ocean which I granted to thee as thy
domain." Probably, however, this is reading into the text more than it
was meant to contain.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[51:11](kj019.htm#fr_320) Derivation unknown.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[51:12](kj019.htm#fr_321) From *aha-umi*,
"fresh sea," *i.e.*, "lake." The province of Afumi was doubtless so
called from Lake Biha which occupies a great portion of its surface. It
is also known as *Chiku-tsu-Afumi*, *i.e.*, "the Nearer Afumi," in
contradistinction to *Toho-tsu-fumi* (in modern pronunciations
*Tōtōmi*), *i.e.*, "Distant Afumi," a province further to the East. The
modern pronunciation of *Afumi* is *Omi*.
