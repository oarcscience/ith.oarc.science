## \[SECT. CLVI.—EMPEROR YŪ-RIYAKU (PART VII.—THE HORSE-FLY AND THE DRAGON-FLY).\]

When forthwith he made a progress to the Moor of Akidzu, <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[1](#fn_2324) and augustly hunted, the Heavenly
Sovereign sat on an august throne. Then a horse-fly bit his august arm,
and forthwith a dragon-fly came and ate up <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2b](#fn_2325) the horse-fly, and flew \[away\].
Thereupon he composed an august Song. That Song said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Who is it tells in the great presence that game is lying on the peak of
Womuro at Mi-yeshinu? Our Great Lord, who tranquilly carries on the
government, being <span id="page_397">p. 397</span> seated on the throne
to await the game, a horse-fly alights on and stings the fleshy part of
his arm fully clad in a sleeve of white stuff, and a dragon-fly quickly
eats up that horse-fly. That it might properly bear its name, the land
of Yamato was called the Island of the Dragon-Fly." <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[3](#fn_2326)

</div>

So from that time that moor was called by the name \[318\] of
Akidzu-nu. <span id="fr_2332"></span>[4](#fn_2327)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2324"></span>[396:1](kj163.htm#fr_2329) <span
id="page_397">p. 397</span> *Akidzu-nu*. See Note 4 to this section.

<span id="fn_2325"></span>[396:2b](kj163.htm#fr_2330) Or, "bit."

<span id="fn_2326"></span>[397:3](kj163.htm#fr_2331) The signification
of the greater portion of this Song is clear enough, and is sufficiently
explained by the context. The word "who" however admits of two
interpretations, Motowori taking it to signify some one," whereas
Moribe, keeping the literal meaning of "who?" sees in it an angry
exclamation of the monarch's at having been brought out to the hunt
under exaggerated promises of game. Womuro means "little cave," but is
here a proper name. *Mi-yeshinu* is a form of the word Yoshino which is
frequently met with in poetry, the syllable mi being probably, as
Mabuchi tells us in his "Commentary on the Collection of a Myriad
Leaves," equivalent to *ma*, and therefore simply an '"Ornamental
Prefix." The phrase "tranquilly carries on the government" represents
the Japanese *yasumishishi*, the Pillow-Word for *wa go oho-kimi*, "our
Great Lord," which latter phrase descriptive of the Sovereign is here
put into the Sovereign's own mouth. "Of white stuff, *shiro-tahe no*, is
another Pillow-Word. The only real difficulty in this Song meets us is
the interpretation of its concluding sentence. The meaning apparently
intended to be conveyed is that it was in order to prove itself worthy
of its name that the dragon-fly performed the loyal deed which forms the
subject of the tale. But it so, the author forgets that it was not the
dragon-fly that was called after Japan, but Japan that was called after
the dragon-fly (*Akidzushima*, "Dragon-fly-Island," from *akidzu*,
"dragon-fly"). What should be the point of the whole poem therefore
fails of application. The name "Island of the Dragon-Fly" has already
appeared in Sect. V (Note 26).

<span id="fn_2327"></span>[397:4](kj163.htm#fr_2332) *I.e.*, Dragon-Fly
Moor. See Motowori's remarks in his "Examination of the Synonyms for
Japan," p. 26.
