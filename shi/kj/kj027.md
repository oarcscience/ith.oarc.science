### Footnotes

<span id="fn_450"></span>[78:1](kj027.htm#fr_454) <span id="page_79">p.
79</span> *Ya-shima-zhi-nu-mi*. Ya-shima means "eight islands." The
syllables *zhi-nu-mi* are obscure, but the translator has little doubt
"ruler" fairly represents their import. Motowori takes *zhi* to be an
apocopated and *nigori’ed* form of *shiru*, "to rule," nu to be an
apocopated form of *nushi*, "master," and *mi* to be an apocopated form
of the Honorific termination *mimi*. Tanigaha Shisei considers *zhimu*
to stand for *shidzumuru*, "to govern," which comes to the same thing so
far as the sense is concerned.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[78:2](kj027.htm#fr_455) *Kamu-oho-ichi-hime*.
The rendering of *Oho-ichi* as "Great Majesty" rests on a plausible
conjecture of Hirata's, who proposes to, identify *ichi* with *idzu*
(<span id="img_07900"></span> ![](img/07900.jpg)). Motowori thinks that
*Oho-ichi* should be taken as the name of a place; but this seems less
good.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[78:3](kj027.htm#fr_456) *Oho-toshi-no-kami*,
written <span id="img_07901"></span> ![](img/07901.jpg), the obvious
rendering of which would be "great year." But the Japanese term *toshi*
is believed to have originally signified, not "year" in the abstract,
but that which was produced each year, viz., the harvest (conf. *toru*,
"to take").

<span id="fn_453"></span>[78:4](kj027.htm#fr_457) *Uka-no-mi-tama*.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[78:5](kj027.htm#fr_458)
*Ko-no-hana-chiru-hime*, so called, says Motowori, because she probably
died young, as a blossom that falls from the tree. We might however
perhaps take the Verb *chiru* in a Causative sense, and consider the
name to signify "the Princess-Who-Causes-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees-to-
Fall. A sister of this goddess appears in the pretty legend narrated in
Sect. XXXVII under the parallel name of the
Princess-Blossoming-Brilliantly-Like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees. See Note
3 to that Sect.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[78:6](kj027.htm#fr_459)
*Fuha-no-moji-ku-nu-su-nu-no-kami*. The import of this name is quite
uncertain. *Fuha* however seems to be the name of a place.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[78:7](kj027.htm#fr_460) "*Hi-kaha-mime*.
*Hi-kaha* (lit. "sun-river") is supposed to stand for the name of a
place in Musashi, which is however written "ice-river" (<span
id="img_07902"></span> ![](img/07902.jpg) and not <span
id="img_07903"></span> ![](img/07903.jpg)), the old Japanese words for
"ice" and "sun" being homonymous.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[78:8](kj027.htm#fr_461) <span id="page_80">p.
80</span> See Sect. VIII. (Note 9), where the name is given as *Kura
okami*.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[78:9](kj027.htm#fr_462)
*Fuka-buchi-no-midzu-yare-hana*. If Fuka-buchi were ascertained to be
not, as is supposed, the name of a place, we should have to render it
"deep pool," and the whole would mean in English
"Water-Spoilt-Blossom-of-the-Deep-Pool."

<span id="fn_459"></span>[78:10](kj027.htm#fr_463)
*Ame-no-tsudohe-chi-ne-no-kami*. In this name nothing is clear but the
first three syllables, which signify "heavenly." But if Mabuchi's
conjecture as to the meaning of the rest were accepted, we should have
to translate the whole by "Heavenly-Assembling-Town-Lady."

<span id="fn_460"></span>[78:11](kj027.htm#fr_464) This is the meaning
plausibly assigned by Motowori to the original *O-midzu-nu-no-kami*.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[78:12](kj027.htm#fr_465) *Fute-mimi-no-kami*,
plausibly conjectured by Tominobu to stand for *Futo-mimi*, etc., which
gives the sense here adopted.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[78:13](kj027.htm#fr_466)
*Funu-dzu-nu-no-kami*. Motowori believes Funu to be the name of a place,
and interprets the name to signify "Master of Funu." But this seems
highly uncertain.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[78:14](kj027.htm#fr_467)
*Ame-no-fuyu-kinu-no-kami* (Motowori's reading) or *Ama-no*, etc.
(Hirata's reading). The translation of the name follows Hirata's
explanation, which is based on Motowori's, and according to which the
characters <span id="img_08000"></span> ![](img/08000.jpg) ("winter
garments") in this text, and <span id="img_08001"></span>
![](img/08001.jpg) read *Fuki-ne* in the "Chronicles," are merely
phonetic, while the meaning is derived from a comparison of the sounds
given by each. Though himself believing in the soundness of Hirata's
conclusion, the translator must admit that it is not indisputable.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[78:15](kj027.htm#fr_468)
*Sasu-kuni-waka-hime*, or *Sashi-kuni*, etc. The former reading, which
Hirata's adopts, seems best. The meaning of *sasu*, here rendered
"small," is open to doubt.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[78:16](kj027.htm#fr_469)
*Sasu-kuni-oho*-\[*no*-\]*kami*, or *Sashi*, etc. The syllable *no* in
the Japanese reading seems to be a superfluous addition of the modern
commentators.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[79:17](kj027.htm#fr_470)
*Oho-kuni-nushi-ne-kami*.

<span id="fn_467"></span>[79:18](kj027.htm#fr_471)
*Oho-na-muji-no-kami*, to which Tominobu proposes to give the sense of
"Great Hole-Possessor," in connection with the story of the mouse-hole
in which he took refuge from the fire lit by the Impetuous-Male-Deity
(*Susa-no-wo*) for his destruction (see Sect. XXIII). But the
interpretation followed in the translation is the most likely as well as
the orthodox one, this Deity being entitled the possessor of a Great
Name or of Great Names on account of his renown in Japanese mythic
story.

<span id="fn_468"></span>[79:19](kj027.htm#fr_472) <span id="page_81">p.
81</span> *Ashi-hara-shiko-wo-no-kami*. The "reed-plains" are doubtless
put by metonymy for Japan.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[79:20](kj027.htm#fr_473) *Yachi-hoko-no-kami*.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[79:21](kj027.htm#fr_474)
*Utsushi-kuni-tama-no-kami*. The name must be understood to mean "Spirit
of the Land of the Living," and to be antithetical to that of one of his
fathers-in-law, the Impetuous Male-Deity (*Susa-no-wo*) who became the
god of Hades.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[79:22](kj027.htm#fr_475) Or "he had five
names."
