## \[SECT. XCIX.—EMPEROR CHIŪ-AI (PART V.—THE EMPRESS JIN-GŌ FISHES IN TSUKUSHI).\]

Again when, having reached the village of Tamashima <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[1](#fn_1770.md) in the Department of Matsura <span
id="fr_1776"></span>[2](#fn_1771.md) in Tsukushi, she partook of an august
meal on the bank of the river, it being then the first decade of the
fourth moon, she then sat on a shoal <span
id="fr_1777"></span>[3](#fn_1772.md) in the middle of the river, picked out
threads from her august skirt, used grains of rice as bait, and hooked
the trout <span id="fr_1778"></span>[4](#fn_1773.md) in the river. (<span
class="small">The name by which the river is called is the
Wo-gaha; <span id="fr_1779"></span>[5](#fn_1774.md) again the name by which
the shoal is called is Kachi-do-hime. <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[6](#fn_1775)</span>.md) So down to the present time it
is an uninterrupted \[custom\] for women in the first decade of the
fourth moon to pick out threads from their skirts, use grains as bait,
and hook trout.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1770"></span>[291:1](kj106.htm#fr_1775.md) <span
id="page_291">p. 291</span> *I.e.*. "jewel-island."

<span id="fn_1771"></span>[291:2](kj106.htm#fr_1776.md) *Matsura-gata*. The
"Chronicles" give an absurd derivation of Matsura from the Adjective
*medzurashi*, "astonishing," which the Empress is supposed to have
ejaculated on finding a trout hooked to her line! The obvious etymology
is *matsu-ura*, "pine-beach."

<span id="fn_1772"></span>[291:3](kj106.htm#fr_1777.md) The character in
the original is <span id="img_29100"></span> ![](img/29100.jpg) (for
<span id="img_29101"></span> ![](img/29101.jpg)), in Japanese *iso*,
which may or may not be connected with the word *ishi*, "stone." In any
case Motowori is not justified in saying that it must be understood to
mean <span id="page_292">p. 292</span> "stone "in this place, as *iso*
means rather a sandy than a stony place, rising above the water level.

<span id="fn_1773"></span>[291:4](kj106.htm#fr_1778.md) In Japanese *ayu*,
a small species of the salmon family (*Plecoglossus altivelis*).

<span id="fn_1774"></span>[291:5](kj106.htm#fr_1779.md) *I.e.*, "little
river."

<span id="fn_1775"></span>[291:6](kj106.htm#fr_1780.md) *I.e.*, "princess
of the gate of victory." But though the words lend themselves to this
interpretation, it can hardly be supposed that such is their real
etymology, and indeed the editor of 1687 draws attention in a Note to
the difficulty of accepting the statement in the text.
