signifies "prince." The other elements of this compound are obscure.

<span id="fn_1209"></span>[205:8](kj069.htm#fr_1213) One is tempted to
render this name by Princess of Mima. But there is no authority for
regarding Mima either in this or in the preceding personal name as
originally the name of a place.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[205:9](kj069.htm#fr_1214) Motowori has no

<span id="fn_1215"></span>[205:14](kj069.htm#fr_1219) *Kadzuraki* is the
name of a district in Yamato, and Motowori believes Tarumi to be the
name of a place in Settsu.

<span id="fn_1216"></span>[205:15](kj069.htm#fr_1220)
*Take-toyo-hadzura-wake no miko*. The first two elements of the compound
signify respectively "brave "and "luxuriant" while the last probably
means "lord." The signification of *hadzura* is obscure.

<span id="fn_1217"></span>[205:16](kj069.htm#fr_1221)
*Oho-tsutsuki-tari-ne no miko*. Tsutsuki being the name of a district in
Yamashiro, the whole compound signifies "prince great sufficing lord of
great Tsutsuki."

<span id="fn_1218"></span>[205:17](kj069.htm#fr_1222) *Sanugi-tari-ne no
miko*, *i.e.*, "prince sufficing lord of Sanugi," (Sanuki,—see Sect. V,

*Karibata* to be the name of a place, and *tobe* (*to-me*) to signify
"old woman," as in the name *Ishi-ko-ri-do-me*, which latter is however
extremely obscure (see Sect. XVI, Note 12).

<span id="fn_1221"></span>[205:20](kj069.htm#fr_1225) *Oho-mata no
miko*. The signification of this name and of the parallel name of the
younger brother is obscure.

<span id="fn_1222"></span>[205:21](kj069.htm#fr_1226) *Wo-mata no miko*.

<span id="fn_1223"></span>[205:22](kj069.htm#fr_1227) *Shibumi no Sukune
no miko*. Shibumi is probably the name of a place, there being a Shibumi
in Ise.

<span id="fn_1224"></span>[205:23](kj069.htm#fr_1228) *Saho* is the name
of a well-known place in Yamato, and *Kurami* <span id="page_209">p.
209</span> is supposed by Motowori to be the name of a place in Wakasa.
*Oho* means "great," and *tome*, according to Motowori, means "old
woman" or simply "female." *Conf*. Note 19.

<span id="fn_1225"></span>[205:24](kj069.htm#fr_1229) *Kasuga no

<span id="fn_1228"></span>[205:27](kj069.htm#fr_1232) *I.e.*, the
princess of Saho.

<span id="fn_1229"></span>[205:28](kj069.htm#fr_1233) It is uncertain
whether we should understand this name to signify "princess Sahaji" or
"the princess of Sahaji," but the latter seems the more probable.

<span id="fn_1230"></span>[206:29](kj069.htm#fr_1234) *I.e.*, the
Emperor Sui-nin.

kami*. The signification of Mikaga is obscure, as is also the connection
between this deity and the deacons of Mikami.

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[206:33](kj069.htm#fr_1238) The signification
of the name Mikami is obscure. The word rendered "deacon" is *hufuri*,
the name of an inferior class of Shinto priests. See for a discussion of
the etymology of the word, etc., Mr. Satow's remarks on p. 112 of Vol.
VII of these Transactions. For Chika-tsu-Afumi see Sect. XXIX, Note 20.

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[206:34](kj069.htm#fr_1239) *Tanika no hiko
Tatatsu-michi-no-ushi no miko*. The signification of *Tatatsu* is
obscure, but we may accept it as the personal name of the worthy here
mentioned. *Michi-no-ushi* means "master of the road," *i.e.* "lord of
the province."

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[206:35](kj069.htm#fr_1240) *Midzuho no

no miko*. Yatsuri is the name of a village in Yamato, and is of
uncertain origin. The signification of *iri* obscure.

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[206:38](kj069.htm#fr_1243) *I-ho* signifies
"five hundred "and *yori* probably signifies "good." The compound may
therefore be taken to mean "manifoldly excellent princess of Midzuho."

id="page_210">p. 210</span> *I.e.*, probably "the Princess Miwi"
(Miwi-dera in Afumi). *Mi-wi* signifies "three wells."

See Sect. LXXII, Note 19.
