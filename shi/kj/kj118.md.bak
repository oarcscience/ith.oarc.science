## \[SECT. CXI.—EMPEROR Ō-JIN (PART VIII.—THE EMPEROR INTOXICATED).\]

Again there came over \[to Japan\] the ancestor of the Hada
Rulers, <span id="fr_1916"></span>[1](#fn_1911.md) the ancestor of the Aya
Suzerains, <span id="fr_1917"></span>[2](#fn_1912.md) and likewise a man
who knew how to distil liquor, and whose name was Nim-pan, <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[3](#fn_1913.md) while another name for him was
Susukori. <span id="fr_1919"></span>[4](#fn_1914.md) So this \[man\]
Susukori distilled some great august liquor, and presented it to the
Heavenly Sovereign, who, excited with the great august liquor that had
been presented to him augustly sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"I have become intoxicated with the august liquor distilled by Susukori.
I have become intoxicated with the soothing liquor, with the smiling
liquor." <span id="fr_1920"></span>[5](#fn_1915.md)

</div>

On his walking out singing thus, he hit with his \[254\] august staff a
large stone in the middle of the Ohosaka <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[6](#fn_1916.md) road, upon which the stone ran away.
So the proverb says: "Hard stones get out of a drunkard's way."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1911"></span>[315:1](kj118.htm#fr_1916.md) <span
id="page_315">p. 315</span> *Hada na miyatsuko*, <span
id="img_31500"></span> ![](img/31500.jpg), a "gentile name." *Hada* is
the native Japanese word used as the equivalent of the Chinese name
<span id="img_31501"></span> ![](img/31501.jpg), *Ch’in*. Its origin is
uncertain.

<span id="fn_1912"></span>[315:2](kj118.htm#fr_1917.md) *Aya no ataha*
<span id="img_31502"></span> ![](img/31502.jpg), a "gentile name." The
use of Aya to represent the Chinese name <span id="img_31503"></span>
![](img/31503.jpg), *Han*, is as difficult to account for as is that of
Hada mentioned in the preceding Note.

<span id="fn_1913"></span>[315:3](kj118.htm#fr_1918.md) <span
id="img_31504"></span> ![](img/31504.jpg). Another and more
Japanese-like reading, *Niho*, is invented by Motowori; but the older
editors read *Nim-pan* according to the usual Sinico-Japanese sound of
the characters. The modern Korean reading would be In-pon.

<span id="fn_1914"></span>[315:4](kj118.htm#fr_1919.md) Written
phonetically <span id="img_31505"></span> ![](img/31505.jpg).

<span id="fn_1915"></span>[315:5](kj118.htm#fr_1920.md) Thus translated,
this Song is too clear to need any explanation. The lines, however,
which are rendered by "with the soothing liquor, with the smiling
liquor."—in Japanese *koto nagu shi we-guzhi-ni*,—are in reality
extremely obscure, and Moribe understands them to signify, "Oh! <span
id="page_316">p. 316</span> how difficult it is for me to speak! Oh! how
ill at ease I am!" In order to do so he has, however, to change and add
to the text; and the translator, though not sure of being in the right
path, has preferred to follow Motowori, whose interpretation, without
requiring any such extreme measures, yet gives a very plausible sense.

<span id="fn_1916"></span>[315:6](kj118.htm#fr_1921.md) See Sect. LXIV,
Note 25.
