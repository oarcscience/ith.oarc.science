### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[199:1](kj068.htm#fr_1144) <span
id="page_201">p. 201</span> In Yamato. For Karu see Sect. LVII, Note I.
*Sakahi-bara* signifies "boundary moor."

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[199:2](kj068.htm#fr_1145) *I.e.*, perhaps,
"the beautiful but alarming female."

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[199:3](kj068.htm#fr_1146) *I.e.*, perhaps,
"the beautiful but alarming male."

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[199:4](kj068.htm#fr_1147) *Hodzumi no omi*.
There are several places called Hodzumi in various provinces. The name
appears to signify "piling up rice-ears."

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[199:5](kj068.htm#fr_1148) *I.e.*, "great
prince."

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[199:6](kj068.htm#fr_1149) *I.e.*, "little
prince-fierce-boar-heart," the boar being known for its savage
disposition.

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[199:7](kj068.htm#fr_1150) Excluding the last
member of the compound, this name signifies
"young-Yamato-lord-prince-great" *Bibi* is identified by Motowori with
the word *mimi*, which so often recurs in proper names (see Sect. XIII,
Note 18).

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[200:8](kj068.htm#fr_1151) Motowori explains
this name in the sense of "brilliant-alarming-female," but some doubt
must attach to it.

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[200:9](kj068.htm#fr_1152) *I.e.*, perhaps,
"prince vast-great-truth."

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[200:10](kj068.htm#fr_1153) *Hani-yasu-bime*.
This name has already been met with in Sect. VII, Note 3. Motowori
however supposes that in this place Haniyasu should be considered to be
the name of a place in Yamato.

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[200:11](kj068.htm#fr_1154) *I.e.*, a man
called "green jewel" who lived in the province of Kafuchi.

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[200:12](kj068.htm#fr_1155) *Take* signifies
"brave." For the rest of the name see Note 10.

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[200:13](kj068.htm#fr_1156) *Take* signifies
"brave." *Wake* is either "young" or "lord." For *Nuna-kaha* see Sect.
LI, Note 31.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[200:14](kj068.htm#fr_1157) <span
id="page_202">p. 202</span> *Abe no omi*. There are several places
called Abe, and it is doubtful to which of them the text here refers.

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[200:15](kj068.htm#fr_1158) The signification
of *inakoshi* seems to be "rice-chariot". *Hiko* is "prince," and *wake*
either "young "or "lord."

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[200:16](kj068.htm#fr_1159) *Kashihade no
omi*, This name is traditionally referred to an incident in the reign of
the Emperor Kei-ko, who is said to have bestowed it on one of his
attendants who served up to him a particularly savoury dish of
shell-fish. "Butlers" (perhaps the word might also be rendered "cooks")
have been mentioned towards the end of Sect. XXXII, and again in the
legend of Jim-mu's slaughter of the "earth-spiders "related in Sect.
XLVIII.

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[200:17](kj068.htm#fr_1160)
*Katsuraki-no-takachina-bime-no-mikoto*. The signification of
*Takachina* is obscure.

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[200:18](kj068.htm#fr_1161) By aphaeresis for
*Oho-inabi*, the form of the name given in the "Chronicles of Old
Matters of Former Ages." itself perhaps standing by apocope for
*Oho-ina-biko*, which would signify "great rice-prince."

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[200:19](kj068.htm#fr_1162) *Wohari no
Murazhi*.

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[200:20](kj068.htm#fr_1163) *Umashi Uchi no
sukune*. Umashi signifies "sweet," and *Uchi* is the name of a place in
Yamashiro.

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[200:21](kj068.htm#fr_1164) *Yamashiro no Uchi
no omi*.

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[200:22](kj068.htm#fr_1165) This name may be
rendered literally "the shade beneath the mountains," but the
signification is "the glow from the autumn leaves on the mountain-side."

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[200:23](kj068.htm#fr_1166) *I.e.*, probably
"wonderful (or precious) prince."

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[200:24](kj068.htm#fr_1167) *Ki no kuni no
miyatsuko no aya*.

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[200:25](kj068.htm#fr_1168) *Take-Uchi no
sukune*. *Take* signifies "brave," and *Uchi* is the name of a district
in Yamato. The common, but erroneous, reading of this name is *Take no
Uchi no sukune*. The celebrated personage, who may be styled the
Methuselah of Japan, is said to have lived during the reigns of five
Emperors, who themselves averaged over a hundred years of life each. His
own age is variously given as 255, 260, etc. up to 360 years.

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[200:26](kj068.htm#fr_1169) *Hata no Yashiro
no sukune*. *Hata* and *Yashiro* are supposed by Motowori to be the
names of places in Yamato. *Yashiro* signifies "shrine." *Hata* is of
uncertain derivation.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[200:27](kj068.htm#fr_1170) *Hata no omi*.

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[200:28](kj068.htm#fr_1171) *Hayashi no omi*.
Hayashi is the name of a place in Kawachi, and signifies "forest."

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[200:29](kj068.htm#fr_1172) *Hami no omi*.
There is a Hami in Afumi and another in Tamba. The signification of the
name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[200:30](kj068.htm#fr_1173) <span
id="page_203">p. 203</span> *Hoshikaha no omi*. Hoshikaha is a place in
Yamato. The name signifies "star river."

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[200:31](kj068.htm#fr_1174) *Afumi no omi*.
For Afumi see Sect. XXIX, Note 20.

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[200:32](kj068.htm#fr_1175) *Hatsuse-be no
Kimi*. For Hatsuse see Sect. CXLIII, Note 8.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[200:33](kj068.htm#fr_1176) *Kose no Wo-kara
no sukune*. Kose is the name of a place in Yamato. The meaning of
Wo-kara is obscure.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[200:34](kj068.htm#fr_1177) *Kose no omi*.

<span id="fn_1174"></span>[200:35](kj068.htm#fr_1178) *Sazakibe no omi*.
See Sect. LIII, Note 10.

<span id="fn_1175"></span>[200:36](kj068.htm#fr_1179) *Kurube no omi*.

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[200:37](kj068.htm#fr_1180) *Soga no Ishikaha
no sukune*. Soga is a place in Yamato, and Ishikaha a district in
Kahachi. In cases like this it must generally be presumed that the
family had two seats, or was divided into two branches residing in
different places. Sometimes, however, the original seat and that to
which the family afterwards removed are meant to be indicated.

<span id="fn_1177"></span>[200:38](kj068.htm#fr_1181) *Soga no omi*. The
signification of Soga is obscure.

<span id="fn_1178"></span>[200:39](kj068.htm#fr_1182) *Kahanobe no omi*.
Kahanobe is the name of a district in Settsu, and signifies
"river-bank."

<span id="fn_1179"></span>[200:40](kj068.htm#fr_1183) *Tanaka no omi*.
Tanaka is the name of a place in Yamato and signifies "among the
rice-fields."

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[200:41](kj068.htm#fr_1184) *Takamuko no omi*.
Takamuko seems to be the name of a place in Echizen. Its signification
is uncertain.

<span id="fn_1181"></span>[200:42](kj068.htm#fr_1185) *Woharida no omi*.
Woharida is a place in Yamato. The name seems to mean "little ploughed
field."

<span id="fn_1182"></span>[200:43](kj068.htm#fr_1186) *Sakurawi no omi*.
Sakurawi is the name of a place in Kahachi and signifies "cherry-tree
well."

<span id="fn_1183"></span>[200:44](kj068.htm#fr_1187) *Kishida no omi*.
Kishida is a place in Yamato. The signification of the name is not
clear.

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[200:45](kj068.htm#fr_1188) *Heguri no Tsuku
no sukune*. Heguri is the name of a district in Yamato, and is of
uncertain signification. *Tsuku* (modern *dzuku*), "owl," is a name
which is referred to a tradition that will be found in Motowori's
Commentary, Vol. XXII, p. 29.

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[201:46](kj068.htm#fr_1189) *Heguri no omi*.

<span id="fn_1186"></span>[201:47](kj068.htm#fr_1190) *Sawara no omi*.
Sawara was perhaps a district in Chikuzen. The signification of the name
is obscure.

<span id="fn_1187"></span>[201:48](kj068.htm#fr_1191) *Uma mi-kuhi no
murazhi*. The literal significance of the characters with which
*Uma-mi-kuhi* is written is "horse august post." But whether this name
had any relation to horses, or whether it should simply be regarded as
the name of a place is quite uncertain.

<span id="fn_1188"></span>[201:49](kj068.htm#fr_1192) *Ki no Tsunu no
sukune*. Ki is the name of a province, and <span id="page_204">p.
204</span> Tsunu that of a district in another province,—the province of
Suhau (Suwō). *Conf*. Note 37.

<span id="fn_1189"></span>[201:50](kj068.htm#fr_1193) *Ki no omi*.

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[201:51](kj068.htm#fr_1194) *Tsunu no omi*.

<span id="fn_1191"></span>[201:52](kj068.htm#fr_1195) *Sakamoto no omi*.
Sakamoto is the name of a place in Idzumi and signifies "base of the
hill."

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[201:53](kj068.htm#fr_1196) *Kume no
Ma-ito-hime*. Kume may be, as Motowori says, the name of a place. But
see Sect. XXXIV, Note 7. In any case the place, if it existed, was
probably called after some person of the name of Kume. The signification
of Ma-iro is obscure.

<span id="fn_1193"></span>[201:54](kj068.htm#fr_1197) *Nu-no-iro-hime*.
The meaning of this name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1194"></span>[201:55](kj068.htm#fr_1198) Kadzuraki is the
already frequently mentioned name of a district in Yamato, and Nagaye is
likewise the name of a place,—whether in Yamato or in Kahachi is not
certain. It signifies "long inlet." Motowori thinks that the syllable
*so* in this place is the same as the of *kuma-so*, and signifies
"valiant "or "fierce."

<span id="fn_1195"></span>[201:56](kj068.htm#fr_1199) *Tamade no omi*.
There is a Tamade in Yamato and another in Kahachi. The signification of
the name is uncertain.

<span id="fn_1196"></span>[201:57](kj068.htm#fr_1200) *Ikuha no omi*.
The "Chronicles of Japan" tell us that the original form of this name
*Ikuha* was *uki-ha*, *i.e.*, "floating leaf," and give a story to
account for it. See Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXII, pp. 36-37, where
the reason traditionally given to explain the fact of the name Ikuha
being written with the character <span id="img_20400"></span>
![](img/20400.jpg) is also mentioned at length.

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[201:58](kj068.htm#fr_1201) *Ikuye no omi*.
Ikuye must have been the name of a place; but nothing is known of it.

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[201:59](kj068.htm#fr_1202) Agina no anti. The
same observation applies to this as to the preceding name.

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[201:60](kj068.htm#fr_1203) *Waku-go no
sukune*. *Waku-go* signifies "young child "or youth," an Honorific
designation.

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[201:61](kj068.htm#fr_1204) *Yenuma no omi*.
Yenuma is the name of a district in Kaga, and signifies "inlet-lagoon."

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[201:62](kj068.htm#fr_1205) In Yamato. This
pool or lake is often mentioned in the poems of the "Collection of a
Myriad Leaves" and was celebrated for its lotus-flowers. We hear of it
in the "Chronicles of Japan," as having been dug in the reign of the
Emperor Ō-jin, but it was probably, like many others, a natural pool or
marsh, which was afterwards improved. The name signifies "sabre."
