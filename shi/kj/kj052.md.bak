## \[SECT. XLV.—EMPEROR JIM-MU (PART II.—THE CROSS-SWORD SENT DOWN FROM HEAVEN).\]

So when His Augustness Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko made a progress round from
thence, and reached the village of Kumanu, <span
id="fr_917"></span>[1](#fn_913.md) a large bear came out of the
mountain, <span id="fr_918"></span>[2](#fn_914.md) and forthwith
disappeared into it. Then His Augustness Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko suddenly
fainted away, and his august army likewise all fainted and fell
prostrate. At this time Takakurazhi <span
id="fr_919"></span>[3](#fn_915.md) (<span class="small">this is the name of
a person</span>) <span id="fr_920"></span>[4](#fn_916.md) of Kumanu came
bearing one cross-sword <span id="fr_921"></span>[5](#fn_917.md) to the
place where the august-child of the Deity was lying prostrate, and
presented it to him, upon which the august child of the Heavenly Deity
forthwith rose up, and said: "How long I have slept!" So when he
accepted the cross-sword, the savage Deities of the mountains of Kumanu
all spontaneously fell cut down. <span id="fr_922"></span>[6](#fn_918.md)
Then the whole august

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

army, that had been bewildered and had fallen prostrate, awoke and rose
up. So the august child of the Heavenly Deity asked him how he had got
the cross-sword. Takakurazhi \[135\] replied, saying: "I was told in a
dream that

the two Deities the Heaven-Shining-Great-Deity <span
id="fr_923"></span>[7](#fn_919.md) and the High Integrating Deity <span
id="fr_924"></span>[8](#fn_920.md) commanded and summoned the
Brave-Awful-Possessing-Male-Deity, <span id="fr_925"></span>[9](#fn_921.md)
and charged him \[thus\]: 'The Central Land of Reed-Plains <span
id="fr_926"></span>[10](#fn_922.md) is painfully uproarious,—it is. <span
id="fr_927"></span>[11](#fn_923.md) Our august children must be ill at
ease. As \[therefore\] the Central Land of Reed-Plains is a land which
thou specially subduedst, thou the Brave-Awful-Possessing-Male-Deity
shalt descend \[thither\].' Then he replied, saying: 'I <span
id="fr_928"></span>[12](#fn_924.md) will not descend \[myself\], but I have
the cross-sword wherewith I specially subdued the land. (<span
class="small">The name by which this sword is called is the Deity
Thrust-Snap; <span id="fr_929"></span>[13](#fn_925.md) another name by
which it is called is the Deity Awful-Snap, <span
id="fr_930"></span>[14](#fn_926.md) and another name for it is the
August-Snap-Spirit, <span id="fr_931"></span>[15](#fn_927.md) This sword
dwells in the temple of the Deity of Isonokami</span>) <span
id="fr_932"></span>[16](#fn_928.md) The manner in which I will send this
sword down will be to perforate the ridge of \[the roof of\]
Takakurazhi's stone-house, <span id="fr_933"></span>[17](#fn_929.md) and
drop it through. (So the Brave-Awful-Possessing-Male-Deity instructed
me, saying: 'I will perforate the ridge of \[the roof of\] thy
store-house, and drop this sword through. <span
id="fr_934"></span>[18](#fn_930).md) So do thou, with the good eyes of
\[136\] morning, <span id="fr_935"></span>[19](#fn_931.md) take it and
present it to the august child of the Heavenly Deity.' So, on my
searching my store-house early next morning in accordance with the
instructions of the dream, there really was a cross-sword there. So I
just present this cross-sword to thee."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_913"></span>[164:1](kj052.htm#fr_917.md) This name signifies
"bear-moor." The name is now generally pronounced *Kumano*.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[164:2](kj052.htm#fr_918.md) Motowori ingeniously
conjectures the text of this passage <span id="img_16500"></span>
![](img/16500.jpg), which makes no sense, to be a copyist's error for
<span id="img_16501"></span> ![](img/16501.jpg), which <span
id="page_166">p. 166</span> gives the meaning rendered in the
translation. The running hand form of <span id="img_16602"></span>
![](img/16602.jpg) might well be mistaken for that of the single
character <span id="img_16603"></span> ![](img/16603.jpg). The editor of
1687 is less happy in his conjecture that the character intended may be
<span id="img_16604"></span> ![](img/16604.jpg), "crocodile." This
incident of the bear was thought important by the compiler for a mention
of it to be inserted in his Preface. (See [p. 5](kj007.htm#page_5).md).

<span id="fn_915"></span>[164:3](kj052.htm#fr_919.md) The signification of
this name is not clear. Taking *zhi* as an apocopated *nigori’ed* form
of the Postposition *shita*, we might suppose *taka-kura-zhi* to signify
"under the high store house" in allusion to the legend which forms the
subject of this section. There are, however, reasons for doubting this
etymology. (See Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XVIII, p. 48). In the
Preface we have simply *Takahura*, without the final syllable *zhi*; but
the omission of *zhi* in that place is almost certainly to be accounted
for on euphonic grounds.

<span id="fn_916"></span>[164:4](kj052.htm#fr_920.md) This note to the
original is believed to be an interpolation,

<span id="fn_917"></span>[164:5](kj052.htm#fr_921.md) <span
id="img_16603"></span> ![](img/16603.jpg). Motowori avers that the
character <span id="img_16604"></span> ![](img/16604.jpg), "cross," has
no importance, and should be neglected in reading. But this assertion
seems gratuitous in the face of, for instance, such a Chinese locution
as <span id="img_16605"></span> ![](img/16605.jpg). We may be justified,
perhaps, in paying no special heed to the Numeral "one" in this place,
which Motowori neglects in his *kana* reading of the text.

<span id="fn_918"></span>[164:6](kj052.htm#fr_922.md) *I.e.*, they fell
down cut to pieces before they had even been cut at with this wonderful
sword.

<span id="fn_919"></span>[165:7](kj052.htm#fr_923.md) The character <span
id="img_16606"></span> ![](img/16606.jpg), "august," which should form
the penultimate member of this compound name, is here omitted.

<span id="fn_920"></span>[165:8](kj052.htm#fr_924.md) See Sect. I, Note 5.

<span id="fn_921"></span>[165:9](kj052.htm#fr_925.md) See Sect. VIII, Note
7.

<span id="fn_922"></span>[165:10](kj052.htm#fr_926.md) See Sect. IX, Note
18.

<span id="fn_923"></span>[165:11](kj052.htm#fr_927.md) Conf. Sect. X, Note
1.

<span id="fn_924"></span>[165:12](kj052.htm#fr_928.md) The humble character
<span id="img_16607"></span> ![](img/16607.jpg), "servant," is here
used.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[165:13](kj052.htm#fr_929.md) *Sazhi-futsu no
kami*. The translator follows Tanigaha Shisei in considering *sazhi*
(Tanigaha Shisei in his "Perpetual Commentary" reads *sashi* without the
*nigori*) to mean "thrust." For the rendering of *futsu* as "snap" in
this and the two following names *conf*. Sect. VIII, Note 8. Moribe,
however, in his "*Ikzu no Chi-waki*," asserts that *futsu* is but an
alternative form of *futo*, "broad," "thick," or "vast," as shown by the
existence of the phrase *ma-futsu no kagami*, "a true vast mirror."

<span id="fn_926"></span>[165:14](kj052.htm#fr_930.md) *Mika-futsu no
kami*.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[165:15](kj052.htm#fr_931.md) *Futsu no mi tame*.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[165:16](kj052.htm#fr_932.md) <span
id="page_167">p. 167</span> The name of this place, which is in the
province of Yamato, seems to signify "above the rock." It is well known
as the Pillow-Word for the syllables *furu*.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[165:17](kj052.htm#fr_933.md) Properly what is
known to Anglo-Orientals as a "godown."

<span id="fn_930"></span>[165:18](kj052.htm#fr_934.md) The sentence here
placed between braces is proposed by Motowori to supplement an evident
lacuna in the text.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[165:19](kj052.htm#fr_935.md) Or, "luckily with
morning eyes." Motowori remarks that even in modern times, special joy
is felt at a good discovery made in the morning.
