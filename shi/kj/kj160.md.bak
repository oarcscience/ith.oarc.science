## \[SECT. CLIII.—EMPEROR YŪ-RIYAKU (PART IV.—HE WOOES PRINCESS WAKA-KUSAKA-BE).\]

Forthwith making a progress to the residence of Queen Wakakusaka-be the
Heavenly Sovereign sent the dog as a message, saying: "This thing is a
strange thing which I got to day on the road. So it is a thing to woo
with,"—and so saying, sent it in as a present. Thereupon Queen
Waka-kusaka-be sent to say to the Heavenly Sovereign: "It is very
alarming that thou shouldst make a progress with thy back to the
sun. <span id="fr_2312"></span>[1](#fn_2307.md) So I will come up straight
\[to the capital\], and respectfully

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

serve thee." <span id="fr_2313"></span>[2](#fn_2308.md) When therefore he
returned up and dwelt in the palace, he went and stood on the
ascent <span id="fr_2314"></span>[3](#fn_2309.md) of that mountain, and
sang, saying:

<span class="small">"In the hollow between the nearer and the further
mountain, this Mount Kusakabe and Mount Heguri, \[is\] growing the
flourishing broad-leafed boar-oak; at the base grow intertwining
bamboos; on the top grow luxuriant bamboos:—we sleep not \[now\]
intertwined like the intertwining bamboos, we sleep not certainly like
the luxuriant bamboos: \[but\] oh! my beloved \[313\] spouse, with whom
\[I\] shall afterwards sleep intertwined!" <span
id="fr_2315"></span>[4](#fn_2310.md)</span>

And he forthwith sent back a messenger with this Song. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2307"></span>[390:1](kj160.htm#fr_2312.md) <span
id="page_391">p. 391</span> For he had come from Yamato in the East to
Kafuchi in the West.

<span id="fn_2308"></span>[391:2](kj160.htm#fr_2313.md) The meaning is:
"Thy Majesty must not come to woo me here, as the direction is unlucky.
But I will myself come up straightway to the palace to be "thine
Empress."

<span id="fn_2309"></span>[391:3](kj160.htm#fr_2314.md) The ascent or way
up here mentioned is, says Motowori, the Tadagoye Road, and the mountain
is Mount Kusaka. See Sect. CLII, Notes 2 and 3.

<span id="fn_2310"></span>[391:4](kj160.htm#fr_2315.md) In this Song the
Emperor consoles himself for the delay in his union with Princess
Waka-kusaka-be by reflecting that after all she will soon be his.—The
first half of the poem down to the colon and dash is a Preface to the
rest. Most of the difficult words occurring in it have been explained in
previous notes; for the "broad-leafed bear-oak "see Sect. LXXII, Note,
19; for *tatami-komo*, the Pillow-Word by which Heguri is preceded in
the Japanese text, see Sect. LXXXIX, Note 12. *Kusaka-be* is curious,
for whereas it properly signifies Kusaka-Tribe,—this tribe or family
being called after the place where they resided,—the place itself came
to be renamed after them when the fact of the posterior origin of the
family designation had been forgotten. The reason (or the <span
id="page_392">p. 392</span> mention in the Preface of the oak-tree,
which is not referred to in the main text of the poem, is difficult to
ascertain. Moribe thinks, however that it is on account of the
luxuriance of its foliage which, as if it were a Preface within the
Preface, paves the way for the mention of the thick-growing bamboos. The
punning connection between *tashinu-dake*, "luxuriant bamboos," and
*tashi ni ha wi-nezu*, "we sleep not certainly," is necessarily
obliterated in the English translation. "Certainly" must be taken in the
sense of "undisturbedly."

<span id="fn_2311"></span>[391:5](kj160.htm#fr_2316.md) *I.e.*, as may be
conjectured, a messenger dispatched to him by his mistress. It seems
best to suppose the author to represent the Emperor as not having
actually gone to her house at all, but as having only communicated with
her by messenger.
