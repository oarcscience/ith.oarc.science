<p>Then the Heavenly Sovereign again urged a command on His Augustness Yamato-take, saying: "Subdue and pacify the savage Deities and likewise the unsubmissive people of the twelve roads of the East;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1594"></A><A HREF="#fn_1590"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and when he sent him off, joining to him Prince Mi-suki-tomo-mimi-take,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1595"></A><A HREF="#fn_1591"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> ancestor of the Grandees of Kibi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1596"></A><A HREF="#fn_1592"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> he bestowed on [210] him a holly-wood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1597"></A><A HREF="#fn_1593"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> spear eight fathoms [long]. So when he had received the [Imperial] command and started off, he went into the temple of the Great August Deity of Ise, and worshipped the Deity's court,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1598"></A><A HREF="#fn_1594"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> forthwith speaking to his aunt, Her Augustness Yamato-hime, saying: "It must surely be that the Heavenly Sovereign thinks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1599"></A><A HREF="#fn_1595"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> I may die quickly; for after sending me to smite the wicked people of the West, I am no sooner come up again [to the capital] than, without bestowing on me an army, he now sends me off afresh to pacify the wicked people of the twelve circuits of the East. Consequently I think that he certainly thinks I shall die quickly." When he departed with lamentations and tears, Her Augustness Yamato-hime bestowed on him the "Herb-Quelling-Sabre,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1600"></A><A HREF="#fn_1596"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and likewise bestowed on him an august bag,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1601"></A><A HREF="#fn_1597"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> and said: "If there should be an emergency, open the mouth of the bag."</p>

<IMG SRC="img/26101.jpg">. The court in front of the Deity's temple is what is here alluded to, and it would perhaps be a not unpardonable departure from the text to insert the Preposition "at," or "in," and translate thus: "worshipped in the Deity's court."</P>
