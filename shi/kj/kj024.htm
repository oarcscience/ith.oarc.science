Again he begged food of the Deity Princess-of-Great-Food.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_419"></A><A HREF="#fn_416"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Then the Princess-of-Great-Food took out all sorts of dainty things from her nose, her mouth, and her fundament, and made them up into all sorts [of dishes], which she offered to him.
