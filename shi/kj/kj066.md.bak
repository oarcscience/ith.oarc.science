## \[SECT. LIX.—EMPEROR KOAN.\]

His Augustness Oho-yamato-tarashi-hiko-kuni-oshi-bito dwelt in the
palace of Akidzushima at Muro <span id="fr_1110"></span>[1](#fn_1106.md) in
Kadzuraki, and ruled the Empire. This Heavenly Sovereign wedded his
niece Her Augustness Princess Oshika, <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[2](#fn_1107.md) and begot august children: His
Augustness Oho-kibi-no-moro-susumi, <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[3](#fn_1108.md) next His Augustness,
Oho-yamato-ne-ko-hiko-futo-ni <span id="fr_1113"></span>[4](#fn_1109.md)
(<span class="small">two Deities</span>). So His Augustness
Oho-yamato-ne-ko-hiko-futo-ni \[159\] \[was he who afterwards\] ruled
the Empire. The heavenly Sovereign's august years were one hundred and
twenty-three. His august mausoleum is on the Mound of Tamade. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1106"></span>[195:1](kj066.htm#fr_1110.md) In Yamato. *Muro*
signifies "cave" or "pit." *Aki-dzu-shima*, "the Island of the
Dragon-Fly," is frequently used as an alternative name of Japan (see
Sect. V, Note 26). See also the Emperor Yū-riyaku's song given in Sect.
CLVI.

<span id="fn_1107"></span>[195:2](kj066.htm#fr_1111.md)
*Oshika-hime-no-mikoto*. The name Oshika, which is obscure, appears in
the "Chronicles" under the form of *Oshi*, which has generally been
interpreted by Motowori (whom the translator follows) as a corruption of
*ohoshi*, "great." This version of the name makes it harmonize with that
of the Princess's father.

<span id="fn_1108"></span>[195:3](kj066.htm#fr_1112.md) See Sect. LX, Note
11.

<span id="fn_1109"></span>[195:4](kj066.htm#fr_1113.md) This name seems to
signify "Great Yamato's Lord Prince, the Vast Jewel."

<span id="fn_1110"></span>[195:5](kj066.htm#fr_1114.md) *Tamade no woka*.
In Yamato. For this name see Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXI, pp. 37-38.
