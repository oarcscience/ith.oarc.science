## \[SECT. LXXXVII.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART XII.—YAMATO-TAKE WOOES PRINCESS MIYAZU).\]

Having crossed over from that land into the land of Shinanu <span
id="fr_1627"></span>[1](#fn_1623.md) and subdued the Deity of the Shinanu
pass, <span id="fr_1628"></span>[2](#fn_1624.md) he came back to the land
of Wohari, and went to dwell in the house of Princess Miyazu, to whom he
had before plighted his troth. Hereupon, when presenting to him the
great august food, Princess Miyazu lifted up a great liquor-cup and
presented it to him. Tunc Heræ Miyazu veli oræ adhæserunt menstrua.
Quare \[Augustus Yamato-take\] ilia menstrua vidit, et auguste cecinit,
dicens:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Ego volui reclinare \[caput\] in fragili, molli brachiolo \[tuo, quod
est simile\] vallo impingenti acutæ falci in Monte Kagu in cœlo formato
quasi cucurbita;—ego desideravi dormire \[tecum\]. Sed in orâ veli quod
induis luna surrexit." <span id="fr_1629"></span>[3](#fn_1625.md)

</div>

Tunc Heræ Miyazu augusto cantui respondit, dicens: \[216\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Altè resplendentis solis auguste puer! Placidè administrationem faciens
mi magne domine! Renovatis annis venientibus et effluentibus, renovatæ
lunæ eunt veniendo patienter expecto, luna suàpte surgit in orâ veli
quod ego induo!" <span id="fr_1630"></span>[4](#fn_1626.md)

</div>

Quare tune \[ille\] coivit \[cum illâ\], after which, placing in
Princess Miyazu's house his august sword "the Grass-Quelling Sabre," he
went forth <span id="fr_1631"></span>[5](#fn_1627.md) to take the Deity of
\[Mount\] Ibuki. <span id="fr_1632"></span>[6](#fn_1628.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1623"></span>[267:1](kj094.htm#fr_1627.md) <span
id="page_267">p. 267</span> See Sect. XXXIII, Note 26.

<span id="fn_1624"></span>[267:2](kj094.htm#fr_1628.md) *Shinanu no saka*,
a pass between the provinces of Shinano and Mino which is no longer
used.

<span id="fn_1625"></span>[267:3](kj094.htm#fr_1629.md) <span
id="page_268">p. 268</span> Even taken apart from its immediate context,
the import of this Song is plain, notwithstanding Moribe's efforts to
explain away its indelicacy. The details of the first part, however,
require some comment in order to make them comprehensible to the
European reader, the words in question being these which might in
English be rendered "thy fragile, slender, delicate arm \[which
resembles\] a post striking against the sharp sickle on Mount Kagu of
the gourd-shaped heaven." In Japanese they run thus:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Hisa-kata no*  
     *Ame no Kagu-yamo*  
*To-kama ni*  
     *Sa-wataru kuhi:—*  
*Hiha-boso*  
     *Ta-waya-gahina wo* etc.

</div>

It will he remarked that the first four lines form a "Punning Preface
"to the fifth. Such Punning Prefaces have not necessarily any logical
connection with what follows, as has been explained by the present
writer in a paper "On the Use of Pillow Words and Plays upon Words in
Japanese Poetry," to be found in Vol. V, Pt. I, pp. 79 *et seq.* of
these "Transactions." In this particular case, however, there is
sufficient continuity of sense to warrant the continuous translation
above given. The word "post," though such a use of it is very curious,
must be [understood](errata.htm#55.md) to denote not a dead, but a living
trunk, or rather the stem of some delicate plant or grass which falls
beneath the sickle of the mower on Mount Kagu in Heaven, or, as it may
better be understood, on the Heavenly Mount Kagu \[in Yamato\].
"Gourd-shaped "is the translation of *hisa-kata no* or *hisa-gata no*,
the Pillow-Word for "heaven." Its meaning is disputed, but Mabuchi in
his "Dictionary of Pillow-Words" and Motowori agree in giving to it the
sense here adopted (see the above-mentioned paper "On the Use of
Pillow-Words, etc.," p. 81).

<span id="fn_1626"></span>[267:4](kj094.htm#fr_1630.md) The total sense of
this Song is quite plain.—In the first lines of it the Prince is
addressed as if he were the reigning sovereign. The words *placidè
administrationem faciens* represent the Japanese *yasumishishi*, the
Pillow-Word for *wa ga oho-kimi*, "my great lord." Elsewhere the English
rendering "who tranquilly carries on the government" has been adopted.
The word *aratama no*, rendered by the Adjective *renovatis*, is the
Pillow-Word for "sun," "moon" and "year," and is of not quite certain
import. The interpretation here adopted has, however, for it the weight
of probability and of native authority, Mabuchi in his "Dictionary of
Pillow-Words "deriving it from the Verb *aratamaru*, "to be renewed."

<span id="fn_1627"></span>[267:5](kj094.htm#fr_1631.md) <span
id="page_269">p. 269</span> The characters in the text might also be
rendered "he made a progress," as they are those only properly applied
to the movements of a reigning sovereign. Here and elsewhere, they are
used in speaking of Yamato-take. (Conf. Sect. LXXX, Note 5.)

<span id="fn_1628"></span>[267:6](kj094.htm#fr_1632.md) On the frontier of
Afumi (Omi) and Mince Ibuki seems to signify "blowing," in allusion, it
is said, to the pestilential breath or influence of the god by whom the
place was tenanted. The word rendered "Mount "is supplied by the editor
of 1687.
