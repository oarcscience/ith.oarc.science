<span id="fn_2133"></span>[356:1](kj137.htm#fr_2138.md) <span
id="page_356">p. 356</span> *Mozu no mimi-hara*. The origin of this
singular name is thus explained in the "Chronicle" (Emperor Nin-toku,
67th year, Winter, 10th Moon): "(The Emperor made a progress to the moor
of Ishidzu in Kafuchi to fix the site of his mausoleum. On the day when
the construction of his mausoleum was begun, a deer suddenly ran out
from the middle of the moor, rushed into the midst of the coolies, fell
down, and <span id="page_357">p. 357</span> died. The suddenness of its
death causing astonishment, its wound was looked for, whereupon a shrike
came out of its ear, and flew away. So on looking into the ear, it was
found to be all eaten away. So that is the reason why the place is
called *Mozu no mimi-hare* (the 'Shrike's Ear-Moor.')"
