## \[SECT. LXXXVI.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART XI.—YAMATO-TAKE DWELLS IN THE PALACE OF SAKAWORI.)\]

When, forthwith crossing over from that land out into Kahi, <span
id="fr_1621"></span>[1](#fn_1617.md) he dwelt in the palace of
Sakawori, <span id="fr_1622"></span>[2](#fn_1618.md) he sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"How many nights have I slept since passing Nihibari and Tsukuha?" <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[3](#fn_1619.md)

</div>

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

Then the old man, who was the lighter of the august fire, <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[4](#fn_1620.md) completed the august Song, and sang,
saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Oh! having put the days in a row, there are of nights nine nights, and
of days ten days!" <span id="fr_1625"></span>[5](#fn_1621.md)

</div>

Therefore \[Yamato-take\] praised the old man, and forthwith bestowed
\[on him\] the Rulership of the Eastern Land\[s\]. <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[6](#fn_1622.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1617"></span>[265:1](kj093.htm#fr_1621.md) <span
id="page_266">p. 266</span> This name is identified by the native
etymology with an homonymous Substantive signifying "a place between
mountains."

<span id="fn_1618"></span>[265:2](kj093.htm#fr_1622.md) The etymology of
this name is uncertain. But the most likely opinion is that it signifies
"a zigzag road down a pass."

<span id="fn_1619"></span>[265:3](kj093.htm#fr_1623.md) *I.e.*, since
leaving the province of Hitachi, of which Tsukuha (in modern parlance
*Tsukuba*, with the last syllable *nigori*’ed) and Nihibari (modern
*Nihiharu*) are two districts. In the later poetry *Nibari no* is often
used as a Pillow-Word for the name of Mount Tsukuba. The etymology of
both names is uncertain, but "newly tilled "seems to be the most
probable etymology of the first of the two.

<span id="fn_1620"></span>[266:4](kj093.htm#fr_1624.md) Not necessarily a
fire kindled for the sake of obtaining warmth, but fire in general,
including, as Motowori suggests, torches and fires lit to drive away
mosquitoes. There are frequent mentions in the classical literature of
this latter sort of fire, which may indeed still be met with in some
districts where mosquito-nets are not yet in common use.

<span id="fn_1621"></span>[266:5](kj093.htm#fr_1625.md) The meaning is: "On
counting up, I find that we have been ten days and nine
nights."—Previous to Motowori the expression *ka-ga nabette*, "having
put in a row (*i.e.* counted) the days" was curiously misunderstood, and
subjected to various far-fetched interpretations. There can however be
no doubt but that Motowori is right.—The reason why the old man is said
to have "completed "the Prince's song is that the former taken alone is
of incomplete rhythm.

<span id="fn_1622"></span>[266:6](kj093.htm#fr_1626.md) Or, as Motowori
would prefer to [consider](errata.htm#54.md) it, "the Rulership of an
Eastern Land," viz., one out of the twelve Eastern provinces.
