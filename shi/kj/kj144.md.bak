### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2187"></span>[365:1](kj144.htm#fr_2192.md) <span
id="page_366">p. 366</span> Also pronounced *In-kiyo*.

<span id="fn_2188"></span>[365:2](kj144.htm#fr_2193.md) See Sect. CXXXIII,
Note 13.

<span id="fn_2189"></span>[365:3](kj144.htm#fr_2194.md) This name and the
next have already appeared in Sect. CXVII.

<span id="fn_2190"></span>[365:4](kj144.htm#fr_2195.md) *Kinashi no Karu no
miko*. Karu is properly the name of a place in Yamato which has already
often appeared in the text. It is uncertain whether *kinashi* is
likewise the name of a place or of a particular kind of pear; but
Motowori inclines to the former view.

<span id="fn_2191"></span>[365:5](kj144.htm#fr_2196.md) *I.e.*, "the great
lord of Negate." There are many places of this name (lit. "long
rice-field"), and it is not known which is here intended.

<span id="fn_2192"></span>[365:6](kj144.htm#fr_2197.md) *I.e.*, "the black
prince of Sakahi." The latter word signifies "frontier." It is not known
where Sakahi is, neither is the reason for the name of "black prince"
applied to this personage known (*Conf*. the "white prince" mentioned a
little further on).

<span id="fn_2193"></span>[365:7](kj144.htm#fr_2198.md) Or, "of Anaho," for
Anaho is properly the name of a place in Yamato. Its import is not
clear.

<span id="fn_2194"></span>[365:8](kj144.htm#fr_2199.md) *I.e.*, "the great
lady of Karu."

<span id="fn_2195"></span>[365:9](kj144.htm#fr_2200.md) Written <span
id="img_36600"></span> ![](img/36600.jpg), *i.e.*, "the garment-passing
lady." *So-tohoshi* is Motowori's reading of the characters, the usual
reading being *So-tohori* (the Intransitive instead of the Transitive
form of the Verb). He likewise identifies Koto-fushi (see Sect. CXVII,
Note 9) with this celebrated princess, who is commonly worshipped as
Goddess of Poetry. There is much confusion in the traditions concerning
her, and Motowori's notes on the subject in Vol. XXXIV, pp. 53-54 and in
Vol. XXXIX of his Commentary, p. 3, should be consulted.

<span id="fn_2196"></span>[365:10](kj144.htm#fr_2201.md) *Yatsuri no
shiro-bike no miko*, *i.e.*, "the white prince of Yatsuri." Yatsuri is
the name of a place in Yamato. It is written with characters signifying
"eight melons."

<span id="fn_2197"></span>[365:11](kj144.htm#fr_2202.md) *I.e.*, "great
Hatsuse," so called from Hatsuse, a celebrated place in Yamato, which
has already been mentioned.

<span id="fn_2198"></span>[366:12](kj144.htm#fr_2203.md) *I.e.* "the great
lady of Tachibana," the latter being the name of a place in Yamato. The
word signifies "orange."

<span id="fn_2199"></span>[366:13](kj144.htm#fr_2204.md) *I.e.*, "the lady
of Sakami," the latter being apparently the name of a place either in
Harima or in Wohari. Its derivation is not clear.
