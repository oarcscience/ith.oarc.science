## \[SECT. LX.—EMPEROR KŌ-REI.\]

His Augustness Oho-yamato-ne-ko-hiko-futo-ni dwelt at the Palace of
Ihodo at Kuruda, <span id="fr_1115"></span>[1](#fn_1111.md) and ruled the
Empire. This Heavenly Sovereign wedded Her Augustness Princess
Kuhashi, <span id="fr_1116"></span>[2](#fn_1112.md) daughter of
Ohome, <span id="fr_1117"></span>[3](#fn_1113.md) ancestor of the
Departmental Lords of Tohochi, <span id="fr_1118"></span>[4](#fn_1114.md)
and begot an august child: His Augustness
Oho-yamato-ne-ko-hiko-kuni-kuru <span id="fr_1119"></span>[5](#fn_1115.md)
(<span class="small">one Deity</span>). Again he wedded Princess
Chiji-haya-ma-waka of Kasuga, <span id="fr_1120"></span>[6](#fn_1116.md)
and begot an august child: Her Augustness Princess Chiji-haya <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[7](#fn_1117.md) (<span class="small">one
Deity</span>). Again wedding Her Augustness Princess
Oho-yamato-kuni-are, <span id="fr_1122"></span>[8](#fn_1118.md) he begot
august children: Her Augustness Yamato-to-mo-so-bime, <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[9](#fn_1119.md) next His Augustness
Hiko-sashi-kata-wake; <span id="fr_1124"></span>[10](#fn_1120.md) next His
\[160\] Augustness Hiko-isa-seri-biko, <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[11](#fn_1121.md) another name for whom is His
Augustness Oho-biki-tsu-hiko: next Yamato-to-bi-haya-waka-ya-hime <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[12](#fn_1122.md) (<span class="small">four
Deities</span>). Again he wedded Haheirodo, <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[13](#fn_1123.md) younger sister of Her Augustness
Princess Are, and begot august children,—His Augustness
Hiko-same-ma, <span id="fr_1128"></span>[14](#fn_1124.md) next His
Augustness Waka-hiko-take-kibi-tsu-hiko <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[15](#fn_1125) (two Deities.md). The august children of
this Heavenly Sovereign \[numbered\] in all eleven Deities (<span
class="small">five kings and three queens</span>). So His Augustness
Oho-yamato-ne-ko-hiko-kuni-kuru \[was he who afterwards\] ruled the
Empire. The two Deities His Augustness Oho-kibi-tsu-hiko and His
Augustness Waka-take-kibi-tsu-hiko together set sacred jars <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[16](#fn_1126.md) at the front <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[17](#fn_1127.md) of the River Hi <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[18](#fn_1128.md) in Hari-ma; <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[19](#fn_1129.md) and, making Harima the mouth of the
road, <span id="fr_1134"></span>[20](#fn_1130.md) subdued and pacified the
Land of Kibi. So His Augustness \[161\] Oho-kibi-tsu-hiko (<span
class="small">was the ancestor of the Grandees of Kamu-tsu-michi in
Kibi</span>) <span id="fr_1135"></span>[21](#fn_1131.md) The next, His
Augustness Waka-hiko-take-kiki-tsu-hiko (<span class="small">was the
ancestor of the Grandees of Shimo-tsu-michi in</span>

Grandees of Kasa <span id="fr_1137"></span>[23](#fn_1133)</span>.md). The
next His Augustness Hiko-same-ma (<span class="small">was the ancestor
of the Grandees of Uzhika in Harima <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[24](#fn_1134)</span>.md). The next, His Augustness
Hiko-sashi-kata-wake (<span class="small">was the ancestor of the
Grandees of Tonami in Koshi, <span id="fr_1139"></span>[25](#fn_1135.md) of
the Grandees of Kunisaki in the Land of Toyo, <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[26](#fn_1136.md) of the Dukes of Ihobara, <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[27](#fn_1137.md) and of the Maritime Suzerains of
Tsunuga</span>). <span id="fr_1142"></span>[28](#fn_1138.md) The Heavenly
Sovereign's august years were one hundred and six. His august mausoleum
is at Umasaka at Kotawoka. <span id="fr_1143"></span>[29](#fn_1139.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1111"></span>[196:1](kj067.htm#fr_1115.md) <span
id="page_197">p. 197</span> In Yamato. *Iho-do* signifies "hut door."
*Kuru-da* (*Kuroda* would be the more natural reading) signifies "black
rice-field."

<span id="fn_1112"></span>[196:2](kj067.htm#fr_1116.md)
*Kuhashi-hime-no-mikoto*. The name signifies "beautiful princess."

<span id="fn_1113"></span>[196:3](kj067.htm#fr_1117.md) This seems to have
been originally not a personal name, but the name of a place in Wohari.

<span id="fn_1114"></span>[196:4](kj067.htm#fr_1118.md) *To-hochi no
agata-mushi*. Tohochi is a district in Yamato. The name seems to signify
"ten marts."

<span id="fn_1115"></span>[196:5](kj067.htm#fr_1119.md) This name signifies
"great Yamato's lord prince who rules the land."

<span id="fn_1116"></span>[196:6](kj067.htm#fr_1120.md) *Kasuga
no-chiji-haya-ma-waka-hime*. This name probably signifies "the
thousand-fold brilliant truly young princess of Kasuga." For Kasuga see
Sect, LVIII, Note 7.

<span id="fn_1117"></span>[196:7](kj067.htm#fr_1121.md)
*Chiji-haya-hime-no-mikoto*, *i.e.*, probably "thousand-fold brilliant
princess."

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[196:8](kj067.htm#fr_1122.md)
*Oho-yamato-kuni-are-hime-no-mikoto*. See Sect. LVI, Note 16.

<span id="fn_1119"></span>[196:9](kj067.htm#fr_1123.md) Motowori assigns to
this name the signification of "Yamato's hundred thousand-fold
illustrious princess," and has a very long note on the subject in Vol.
XXI, p. 42, *et seq*.

<span id="fn_1120"></span>[196:10](kj067.htm#fr_1124.md) The signification
of this name is not clear.

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[196:11](kj067.htm#fr_1125.md) *I.e.*, "prince
valorously advancing prince." The alternative name signifies "Great
Prince of Kibi," and both refer to his conquest of the province of Kibi
as related a little further on in this Section. Motowori gives good
reasons for supposing that *Oho-kibi-no-moro-susumi*, *i.e.* "He Who
Completely Advances in Great Kibi," is but another form of the same
name, erroneously inserted in the account of the preceding reign (see
Sect, LIX, Note 3).

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[196:12](kj067.htm#fr_1126.md) *I.e.*, perhaps
"Yamato's hundred-fold wondrous brilliant young ornamental Princess."
The name resembles that of the elder sister.

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[196:13](kj067.htm#fr_1127.md) For this and the
next following names see Sect. LVI, Notes 17 and 16 respectively.

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[196:14](kj067.htm#fr_1128.md) <span
id="page_198">p. 198</span> This name is obscure, and differs from that
given in the parallel passage of the "Chronicles," where we read
Sashima. The latter sounds more authentic.

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[196:15](kj067.htm#fr_1129.md) *I.e.*, "the young
prince the brave prince of Kibi." This name refers to his conquest of
Kibi, as related a few lines further on.

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[196:16](kj067.htm#fr_1130.md) *I.e.*,
earthenware jars of a moderate size, probably intended to hold the
rice-liquor offered to the gods, Being easily broken, they were planted
in the ground up to a certain height.

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[196:17](kj067.htm#fr_1131.md) The probable
meaning of this peculiar expression is "a bend in the river,"

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[196:18](kj067.htm#fr_1132.md) Written with the
character <span id="img_19800"></span> ![](img/19800.jpg), "ice," which
may however be only phonetic. No river of this name is anywhere else
mentioned as flowing through the province of Harima, and one is tempted
to suppose that there is some confusion with the celebrated river Hi,
which figures so frequently in the Idzumo cycle of legends.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[196:19](kj067.htm#fr_1133.md) One of the central
provinces of Japan, on the northern shores of the Inland Sea. Some
derive the name from *hagi-hara*, "lespedeza moor," while others,
connect it with *hari*, a "needle," Neither etymology has much to
recommend it.

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[196:20](kj067.htm#fr_1134.md) *I.e.*, "their
point of departure." It must also be remembered that "road "came to have
the sense of "circuit "or "province," so that we might translate this
phrase by "the commencement of the circuit." *Conf*. such denominations
as *Koshi no michi no kuchi*, *Koshi no michi no naka*, and *Koshi no
michi no shiri* for what are in modern parlance the provinces of
Echizen, Etchiū and Echigo. The region nearest to the capital was called
the mouth, while equally graphic designations were bestowed on the more
remote districts. It was, as we learn by comparison with a passage in
the history of the reign of the Emperor Su-jin (see Sect. LXVI, Note
13), customary thus to plant earthenware jars in the earth at the point
whence an army started on an expedition, this being considered a means
of invoking upon it the blessing of the gods. Not only so, but down to
the Middle Ages travellers in general were in the habit of worshipping
at the shrine of the god of roads. For "road" in the sense of "circuit,"
"province," or "administrative division "see Sect. LXVI, Note 2.

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[196:21](kj067.htm#fr_1135.md) *Kibi no
kamu-tsu-michi no omi*. *Kamu-tsu-michi* *i.e.*, "the Upper Road "or
"Circuit," was the ancient name of the province of Bizen (or of a
portion of it), which formerly was a part of the Land of Kibi.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[197:22](kj067.htm#fr_1136.md) <span
id="page_199">p. 199</span> *Kibi no shimo-tsu-michi no omi*.
*Shimo-tsu-michi* means "the lower road," and was the ancient name of a
portion of the province of Bitchiū, which formerly was a part of the
land of Kibi.

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[197:23](kj067.htm#fr_1137.md) *Kasa no omi*,
*i.e.*, "Grandees of the Hat," a "gentile name" which is referred by the
compiler of the "Catalogue of Family Names" to an incident in the reign
of the Emperor Ō-jin, which he however by no means clearly relates (See
Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXI; p.p. 57-58).

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[197:24](kj067.htm#fr_1138.md) *Harima no Uzhika
no omi*. Uzhika is the name of a place. It is written with characters
signifying "cow and deer," but the true derivation is quite uncertain.

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[197:25](kj067.htm#fr_1139.md) *Koshi no Tonami
no omi*. Tonami is a district in Etchiū. [The](errata.htm#43.md)
signification of the name is uncertain.

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[197:26](kj067.htm#fr_1140.md) *Toyo-kuni no
Kunisaki no omi*. Kunisaki is a district in Bungo. The name seems to
signify "land's end."

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[197:27](kj067.htm#fr_1141.md) *Ihobara no kimi*.
Ihobara is a district in Suruga. The signification of the name is
obscure.

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[197:28](kj067.htm#fr_1142.md) *Tsunuga no ama no
atahe*. For Tsunuga see Sect. CI, Notes 3 and 12. Perhaps the name
should rather be rendered "the Suzerains of Ama in Tsunuga," as Ama may,
after all, as Motowori suggests, be here the name of a place.

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[197:29](kj067.htm#fr_1143.md) In the Province of
Yamato. *Kata-woka* signifies "side-mound" or "incomplete mound."
*Uma-saka* signifies "horse-hill" or "horse-pass." Umasaka should
perhaps be understood as the particular designation of a portion of the
ascent of Katawoka, which is mentioned in the "Chronicles "as the name
of a mountain.
