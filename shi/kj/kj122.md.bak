## \[SECT. CXV.—EMPEROR Ō-JIN (PART XII.—DESCENDANTS OF AMA-NO-HI-BOKO, AND TREASURES BROUGHT BY HIM.)\]

Forthwith staying in that country, he wedded Saki-tsu-mi, <span
id="fr_1961"></span>[1](#fn_1956.md) daughter of Tajima-no-matawo, <span
id="fr_1962"></span>[2](#fn_1957.md) and begot a child:
Tajima-morosuku. <span id="fr_1963"></span>[3](#fn_1958.md) The latter's
child was Tajima-hi-ne. <span id="fr_1964"></span>[4](#fn_1959.md) The
latter's child was Tajima-hinaraki. <span
id="fr_1965"></span>[5](#fn_1960.md) The

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

latter's children were Tajima-mori, <span
id="fr_1966"></span>[6](#fn_1961.md) next Tajima-hitaka, <span
id="fr_1967"></span>[7](#fn_1962.md) next Kiyo-hiko <span
id="fr_1968"></span>[8](#fn_1963.md) (<span class="small">three
Deities</span>). <span id="fr_1969"></span>[9](#fn_1964.md) This Kiyo-hiko
wedded Tagima-no-mehi, <span id="fr_1970"></span>[10](#fn_1965.md) and
begot children: Suga-no-morowo, <span id="fr_1971"></span>[11](#fn_1966.md)
next his younger sister Suga-kama-yura-domi. <span
id="fr_1972"></span>[12](#fn_1967.md) So the above mentioned Tajima-hitaka
wedded his niece Yura-domi, and begot a child: Her Augustness Princess
Takanuka of Kadzuraki. <span id="fr_1973"></span>[13](#fn_1968.md) (<span
class="small">This was the august parent <span
id="fr_1974"></span>[14](#fn_1969.md) of Her Augustness Princess
Okinaga-tarashi.</span>) So the things which Ama-no-hi-boko brought over
here, and which were called the "precious treasures," <span
id="fr_1975"></span>[15](#fn_1970.md) were: two strings of pearls: <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[16](#fn_1971.md) likewise a wave-shaking scarf, a
wave-cutting scarf, a wind-shaking scarf, and a wind-cutting
scarf; <span id="fr_1977"></span>[17](#fn_1972.md) likewise a mirror of the
offing and a mirror of the shore, <span
id="fr_1978"></span>[18](#fn_1973.md)—eight articles in all. (<span
class="small">These are the Eight Great Deities of
Idzushi.</span>) <span id="fr_1979"></span>[19](#fn_1974.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1956"></span>[323:1](kj122.htm#fr_1961.md) <span
id="page_324">p. 324</span> This name may mean "lucky ears," or
"possessor of luck;" but it is obscure, and is moreover in the
''Chronicles" (where it is given as the name, not of the daughter, but
of the father) read *Mahe-tsu-mi*,—a reading which, will not bear either
of these interpretations.

<span id="fn_1957"></span>[323:2](kj122.htm#fr_1962.md) Matawo seems to
signify "complete (*i.e.*, healthy or vigorous) male." Observe that the
word Tajima enters into the designations of most of his descendants.

<span id="fn_1958"></span>[323:3](kj122.htm#fr_1963.md) In the "Chronicles"
*Morosuke*, and elsewhere *Morosugi*. The etymology of these names is
obscure except that of the last-mentioned, which signifies "many
cryptomerias."

<span id="fn_1959"></span>[323:4](kj122.htm#fr_1964.md) *Hi-ne* may perhaps
signify "wondrous lord."

<span id="fn_1960"></span>[323:5](kj122.htm#fr_1965.md) The meaning of this
name is obscure, but that of *Hina-rashi-hime* in Sect. XXVI (Note 19)
may be compared.

<span id="fn_1961"></span>[324:6](kj122.htm#fr_1966.md) See Sect. LXXIV,
Note 1.

<span id="fn_1962"></span>[324:7](kj122.htm#fr_1967.md) *Hi-taka* may
[signify](errata.htm#79.md) either "sun-height" or "wondrous height."

<span id="fn_1963"></span>[324:8](kj122.htm#fr_1968.md) This name signifies
"pure prince."

<span id="fn_1964"></span>[324:9](kj122.htm#fr_1969.md) As usual, it is not
the actual word Deity that is used, but the Auxiliary Numeral for
Deities.

<span id="fn_1965"></span>[324:10](kj122.htm#fr_1970.md) *Tagima* is the
name of a place, not to be confounded with the province of Tajima. The
signification of *mehi* is quite obscure.

<span id="fn_1966"></span>[324:11](kj122.htm#fr_1971.md) *Suga* may either
be the name of place in Tajima, as proposed<span id="page_325">p.
325</span> by Motowori, or identical with the Suga of Sect. XIX. The
meaning of Morowo is obscure.

<span id="fn_1967"></span>[324:12](kj122.htm#fr_1972.md) The signification
of this name is obscure. But Suga, Kama, and Yura are apparently the
names of places.

<span id="fn_1968"></span>[324:13](kj122.htm#fr_1973.md) *Kadzuraki no
Taka-nuka-hime*. Kadzuraki is the name of a department, and Takanuka
that of a place in that department, in the province of Yamato.

<span id="fn_1969"></span>[324:14](kj122.htm#fr_1974.md) Literally,
"ancestress." But see Sect. XXII, Note 4. It will be remembered that
*Okinaga-tarashi-hime* was the Empress Jin-go.

<span id="fn_1970"></span>[324:15](kj122.htm#fr_1975.md) Literally,
"treasures of jewels."

<span id="fn_1971"></span>[324:16](kj122.htm#fr_1976.md) Or, "beads."

<span id="fn_1972"></span>[324:17](kj122.htm#fr_1977.md) *I.e.*, a scarf to
raise the waves and a scarf to still the waves, a scarf to raise the
wind and a scarf to still the wind. *Conf*. the magic scarfs mentioned
hear the beginning of Sect. XXIII, by waving which the Deity
Master-of-the-Great-Land (*Oho-kuni-nushi*) kept off the snakes, the
wasps and the centipedes.

<span id="fn_1973"></span>[324:18](kj122.htm#fr_1978.md) This seems to be
the signification of the original terms *oki tsu kagami* and *hi tsu
kagami*, but we are not hereby helped to a very clear understanding of
the nature of the articles which the author [meant](errata.htm#80.md) to
describe. The parallel passage of the "Chronicles" tells us of a "sun,
mirror." Indeed it enumerates the "eight precious treasures" in a manner
that diverges a great deal from the account given in these "Records."

<span id="fn_1974"></span>[324:19](kj122.htm#fr_1979.md) Or, the
"Eight-fold Great Deity." As has already frequently been remarked, the
distinction which we so rigorously draw between Singular and Plural does
not occupy the Japanese mind, and "eight "and "eight-fold" are taken to
mean much the same thing, In the following sentence we find these eight
deities (or this eight-fold deity) spoken of in such a manner as to
necessitate the use of the Singular Number in the translation. Motowori
supposes that they (or he) took the form of a young man (as in several
other legends) to become the father of the Goddess mentioned in the
text. . . . *Idzushi* seems to signify "wonderful stone."
