Deities), having heard of this affray, fled away. So when they reached
Karibawi <span id="fr_2292"></span>[2](#fn_2287) in Yamashiro and were

who art thou? "He replied, saying: "I am a boar-herd in Yamashiro." So
they fled across the River Kusuba, <span
id="fr_2293"></span>[3](#fn_2288) reached the land of Harima, <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[4](#fn_2289) entered the house of a native of that
country named Shizhimu, <span id="fr_2295"></span>[5](#fn_2290) hid
their persons, and worked as grooms and cow-herds.

<span id="fn_2286"></span>[386:1](kj156.htm#fr_2291) <span
id="page_387">p. 387</span> Literally "prince" (<span
id="img_38700"></span> ![](img/38700.jpg)). Their names apparently
signify "big basket" and "little basket."

<span id="fn_2287"></span>[386:2](kj156.htm#fr_2292) Known in later
times as Kaniha and Kabawi. The name signifies (if the characters with
which it is written may be relied on) "the well where the leaves were
cut."
