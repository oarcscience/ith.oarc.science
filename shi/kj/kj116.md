### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1894"></span>[312:1](kj116.htm#fr_1899) <span
id="page_313">p. 313</span> *Ama-be* (written <span
id="img_31300"></span> ![](img/31300.jpg) and read *Una-be* in the Old
Printed Edition and in the edition of 1687, and perhaps better rendered
"Sea-Tribe.") The name of this guild or clan does not seem to have
remained, like the two mentioned together with it, as a "gentile name."

<span id="fn_1895"></span>[312:2](kj116.htm#fr_1900) *Yama-be*. Motowori
thinks that this word has crept into the text erroneously through the
influence of that next mentioned, as the functions of the tribes or
guilds thus separately named were identical The differentiation may have
taken place after the terms had come to be used as "gentile names."

<span id="fn_1896"></span>[312:3](kj116.htm#fr_1901) *Yama-moribe*.

<span id="fn_1897"></span>[312:4](kj116.htm#fr_1902) *Ise-be*. Nothing
is known of this tribe or guild.

<span id="fn_1898"></span>[313:5a](kj116.htm#fr_1903) Doubtless so named
after the Korean labourers employed upon it,—Kudara and Shiragi, as
different parts of the same peninsula, being confounded in thought.
