## \[SECT. LXIV.—EMPEROR SŪ-JIN (PART II.—A PESTILENCE IS STAID BY OHO-TATA-NE-KO).\]

In the reign of this Heavenly Sovereign a great pestilence arose, and
the people died as if none were to be left. <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[1](#fn_1311) Then the Heavenly Sovereign grieved
and lamented, and at night, while on his divine couch, <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[2](#fn_1312) there appeared \[to him\] in an august
dream the Great Deity the Great-Master-of-Things, <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[3](#fn_1313) and said: "This is my august
doing. <span id="fr_1318"></span>[4](#fn_1314) So if thou wilt cause me
to be worshipped <span id="fr_1319"></span>[5](#fn_1315) by
Oho-tata-ne-ko, <span id="fr_1320"></span>[6](#fn_1316) the divine
spirit shall not arise, <span id="fr_1321"></span>[7](#fn_1317) and the
land will be tranquillized." When, therefore, couriers <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[8](#fn_1318) were dispatched in every
direction <span id="fr_1323"></span>[9](#fn_1319) to search for the
person \[named\] Oho-tata-ne-ko, he was discovered in the village of
Minu <span id="fr_1324"></span>[10](#fn_1320) in Kafuchi, and was
respectfully sent \[to the Heavenly Sovereign\]. <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[11](#fn_1321) Then the Heavenly Sovereign deigned
to ask: "Whose child art thou?" He replied, saying: "I <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[12](#fn_1322) am Oho-tats-ne-ko, child of

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> His Augustness
Take-mika-dzu-chi <span id="fr_1327"></span>[13](#fn_1323) \[who was\]
child of His Augustness Ihi-gata-sumi, <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[14](#fn_1324) \[who was\] child of His Augustness
Kushi-mi-gata, <span id="fr_1329"></span>[15](#fn_1325) \[who was\]
child of the Great Deity the Great-Master-of-Things by his wife
Iku-tama-yori-bime, <span id="fr_1330"></span>[16](#fn_1326) daughter of
His Augustness Suwe-tsu-mimi. <span id="fr_1331"></span>[17](#fn_1327)
Hereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, being greatly rejoiced, commanded that
the Empire should be tranquil, and the people flourish, and forthwith
made His Augustness Oho-tata-ne-ko high priest <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[18](#fn_1328) to worship <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[19](#fn_1329) the Great Deity of Great Miwa <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[20](#fn_1330) on Mount Mimoro. <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[21](#fn_1331) Again he ordered His Augustness
Igaka-shiko-wo <span id="fr_1336"></span>[22](#fn_1332) to make eighty
heavenly platters, and reverently to establish the shrines of the
Earthly Deities; <span id="fr_1337"></span>[23](#fn_1333) likewise to
worship with a red-coloured shield and spear the Deity of
Sumi-saka <span id="fr_1338"></span>[24](#fn_1334) at Uda, and with a
black-coloured shield and spear the Deity of Oho-sake; <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[25](#fn_1335) likewise to present august offerings
of cloth to all the Deities of the august declivities of the hills and
to all the Deities of the reaches of the rivers, without neglecting
any. <span id="fr_1340"></span>[26](#fn_1336) <span
id="fr_1341"></span>[27](#fn_1337) In consequence of this the
pestilential vapour ceased altogether, and the country was
tranquillized.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1311"></span>[215:1](kj071.htm#fr_1315) <span
id="page_216">p. 216</span> Literally, "about to be exhausted."

<span id="fn_1312"></span>[215:2](kj071.htm#fr_1316) This expression,
which recurs at the commencement of Sect. CXLV, is difficult to explain.
See Motowori's remarks in Vol. XXIII, pp. 24-25, and again in Vol. XL,
pp. 14-15, of his Commentary.

<span id="fn_1313"></span>[215:3](kj071.htm#fr_1317) See Sect. LI, Note
12.

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[215:4](kj071.htm#fr_1318) Literally, "my
august heart."

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[215:5](kj071.htm#fr_1319) Or, "cause my
shrine to be worshipped at." The import of the god's words is that he
wishes Oho-tata-ne-ko to be appointed chief priest of his temple. For
the origin of this latter see the second half of Sect. XXXII (pp.
[103](kj034.htm#page_103)-105).

<span id="fn_1316"></span>[215:6](kj071.htm#fr_1320) Oho signifies
"great," *Tata* (or *Tada*) is taken to be the name of a place, and the
syllables *ne* and *ko* are regarded as Honorifics. The <span
id="page_217">p. 217</span> whole name may therefore, though with some
hesitation, be interpreted to mean "the Lord of the Great \[Shrine of\]
Tata."

<span id="fn_1317"></span>[215:7](kj071.htm#fr_1321) *I.e.*, "the divine
anger shall no longer be kindled."

<span id="fn_1318"></span>[215:8](kj071.htm#fr_1322) Mounted couriers
are almost certainly intended.

<span id="fn_1319"></span>[215:9](kj071.htm#fr_1323) Literally,
"distributed to the four sides,"—"four sides" being a Chinese phrase for
every direction.

<span id="fn_1320"></span>[215:10](kj071.htm#fr_1324) This name may
signify either "three moors "or "august moor." The village of Minu must
not be confounded with the province of Minu.

<span id="fn_1321"></span>[215:11](kj071.htm#fr_1325) The characters
used are those which properly denote the presenting of tribute to the
Monarch.

<span id="fn_1322"></span>[215:12](kj071.htm#fr_1326) Here and below the
First Personal Pronoun is represented by the respectful character <span
id="img_21700"></span> ![](img/21700.jpg), "servant."

<span id="fn_1323"></span>[216:13](kj071.htm#fr_1327) See Sect. VIII,
Note 7, for the explanation of this name. But probably the deity here
intended is another.

<span id="fn_1324"></span>[216:14](kj071.htm#fr_1328) The etymology and
signification of 'this name are alike obscure.

<span id="fn_1325"></span>[216:15](kj071.htm#fr_1329) Motowori
interprets *kushi* in the sense of "wondrous," and *Migata* as the name
of a place, which also occurs under the form of Higata.

<span id="fn_1326"></span>[216:16](kj071.htm#fr_1330) *I.e.*,
"life-jewel-good-princess."

<span id="fn_1327"></span>[216:17](kj071.htm#fr_1331) The precise
signification of this name is obscure. Motowori supposes *Suwe* to be
the name of a place; *tsu* is the Genitive Particle, and *mimi* the
Honorific of doubtful import, whose meaning has been discussed in Note
18 to Sect. XIII.

<span id="fn_1328"></span>[216:18](kj071.htm#fr_1332) The exact meaning
of the characters used to write the word *kayo-nushi* (modern
*kamushi*), here rendered "high-priest," is "owner of the Deity." Though
commonly used in modern parlance to denote any Shinto priest, it
properly signifies only the chief priest in charge of a temple, whence
the odd-sounding name.

<span id="fn_1329"></span>[216:19](kj071.htm#fr_1333) Or, "conduct the
worship at the shrine of."

<span id="fn_1330"></span>[216:20](kj071.htm#fr_1334) Viz., the Deity
Master-of-the-Great-Land. For the traditional etymology of Miwa see the
legend in Sect. LXV.

<span id="fn_1331"></span>[216:21](kj071.htm#fr_1335) See Sect. XXVIII,
Notes 4 and 5.

<span id="fn_1332"></span>[216:22](kj071.htm#fr_1336) Or,
*Ikaga-shiko-wo*. The probable meaning of this name, pro-posed by
Motowori, is (neglecting the initial letter *i* as expletive) "the
refulgent ugly male."

<span id="fn_1333"></span>[216:23](kj071.htm#fr_1337) See Sect. I, Note
11 .

<span id="fn_1334"></span>[216:24](kj071.htm#fr_1338) *Sumisaka*
probably signifies "charcoal-hill." Uda, which has already been
mentioned in Sect. XLVI, is in Yamato. This passage may equally well be
rendered thus: "to present a red-coloured shield and <span
id="page_218">p. 218</span> spear to the Deity of Sumisaka," and
similarly in the following clause. The meaning comes nearly to the same.

<span id="fn_1335"></span>[216:25](kj071.htm#fr_1339) Literally, "great
hill," or "great pass." It is at the boundary of the province of Yamato
and Kahachi. Neither Motowori nor Tanigaha Shisei sanctions the view of
the elder scholars, who fancied they saw in the distinction of red and
black some mysterious import connected with the four cardinal points.

<span id="fn_1336"></span>[216:26](kj071.htm#fr_1340) In the Old Printed
Edition the text of this passage differs slightly from that adopted by
Motowori; but the meaning is exactly the same.

<span id="fn_1337"></span>[216:27](kj071.htm#fr_1341) A large lacuna
here occurs in the "Old Printed Edition," in which the four hundred and
forty-five Chinese characters forming the original of the following part
of the translation, from the words, "In consequence of this "down to the
words immediately preceding "Methinks this is a sign" on p. 180 are
missing. Both the editor of 1687 and Motowori are silent as to the
manner in which they supplied the deficiency; but it may be presumed
from their silence that the MS. authorities furnished them with what had
accidentally been omitted from the printed text.
