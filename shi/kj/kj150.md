## \[SECT. CXLIII.—EMPEROR IN-GIYŌ (PART VII.—DEATH OF PRINCE KARU AND PRINCESS SO-TOHOSHI).\]

So Prince Karu was banished to the hot waters of Iyo. <span
id="fr_2236"></span>[1](#fn_2231.md) Again when about to be banished, he
sang saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The heaven-soaring birds, too, are indeed messengers. When thou hearest
the voice of the crane, ask my name." <span
id="fr_2237"></span>[2](#fn_2232.md)

</div>

These three songs are of a Heaven-Soaring style. <span
id="fr_2238"></span>[3](#fn_2233.md) Again he sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"If they banish the Great Lord to an island, he will indeed make the
remaining return voyage. Beware of my mat! Mat indeed in words,—beware
of my spouse! <span id="fr_2239"></span>[4](#fn_2234.md)

</div>

\[301\] This Song is of a Partly Lowered Rustic style. <span
id="fr_2240"></span>[5](#fn_2235.md) Queen So-tohoshi presented a Song \[to
him\]. That Song said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Let not thy feet tread on the oyster-shells of the shore of Ahine with
its summer herbs! Pass there \[after\] having made clear!" <span
id="fr_2241"></span>[6](#fn_2236.md)

</div>

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

So when afterwards again, being unable to restrain her love, she went
after him, she sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Thy going has become long past. I will go, oh! to meet thee. Wait! I
can not wait." (<span class="small">What is here called *yama-tadzu* is
\[what is\] now \[known by the name of\] *tatsuge*.</span>) <span
id="fr_2242"></span>[7](#fn_2237.md)

</div>

So when in her pursuit she reached \[the place where Prince Karu was,
he, who had been\] pensively waiting, sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Alas! beloved spouse, who settledst the \[302\] whereabouts of our
grave, setting up flags in the great vale, setting up flags in the
little vale of Hatsuse the hidden castle! Alas! beloved spouse, whom I
see after \[our many troubles\], prostrate like a *tsuki* bow, standing
like an *adzusa* bow!" <span id="fr_2243"></span>[8](#fn_2238.md)

</div>

Again he sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Driving sacred piles in the upper reach, driving true piles in the
lower reach of the river of secluded Hatsuse, and hanging on 303 the
sacrificial piles a mirror, bunging on the true piles true jewels:—if
they said that the younger sister whom I love like a true jewel, that
the spouse whom I love like a mirror were \[there\], I would go home, I
would long for my country." <span id="fr_2244"></span>[9](#fn_2239.md)

</div>

Having thus sung, they forthwith killed themselves together. <span
id="fr_2245"></span>[10](#fn_2240.md) So these two songs are Reading
Songs. <span id="fr_2246"></span>[11](#fn_2241.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2231"></span>[374:1](kj150.htm#fr_2236.md) <span
id="page_375">p. 375</span> For Iyo see Sect. V, Note 4. Its hot springs
are often mentioned in early documents. Motowori identifies them with a
place now called Dō-go (<span id="img_37500"></span>
![](img/37500.jpg)).

<span id="fn_2232"></span>[374:2](kj150.htm#fr_2237.md) The meaning of this
Song is: "I go where perchance no messengers will reach me. But thou
must ask tidings of me from the birds."

<span id="fn_2233"></span>[374:3](kj150.htm#fr_2238.md) <span
id="page_376">p. 376</span> *Ama-da-buri*. The title seems to be derived
from the initial Pillow-Word of these three Songs.

<span id="fn_2234"></span>[374:4](kj150.htm#fr_2239.md) The meaning of this
Song seems to the translator to be: "Even if they dare to banish me now,
I shall some day return again. Respect my mat during my absence. Mat,
indeed! It is my wife that must be respected." The commentators consider
the concluding words to be a command addressed to the wife, and
interpret the phrase to mean, "My spouse, beware! "But surely this makes
less good sense, and moreover fails to suit the exactly parallel passage
in the first Song of Sect. CXXV. By the words "Great Lord" the princely
poet denotes himself,—perhaps with a touch of anger at the indignity to
which he is subjected. The difficult expression *funa-amari* is here, in
accordance with Moribe's view rendered by the words "remaining voyage,"
*i.e.*, "the voyage homeward," which is that part of a voyage that may
be said to remain over for an outward-bound vessel when she has reached
her destination. Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXXIX, pp. 50-51, should be
consulted for older views of the meaning of the term. The expression
"beware of my mat" reminds us that in early days the entire floor of a
Japanese room was not matted according to the modern custom, but that
each individual had his own mat on which to sit and sleep. Great care
was always taken not to defile another's mat, *Conf*, an elegy from the
"Collection of a Myriad Leaves "translated by the
[present](errata.htm#90.md) writer in his "Classical Poetry of the
Japanese," p. 79.

<span id="fn_2235"></span>[374:5](kj150.htm#fr_2240.md) *Hina-buri no
kata-oroshi*. Like most of the names of styles of Songs, this one is
extremely obscure. The commentators suppose that one part was sung in a
lower voice than the rest. But they are merely guessing.

<span id="fn_2236"></span>[374:6](kj150.htm#fr_2241.md) The actual words of
the Song signify: "Lacerate not thy feet by walking on the unseen
oyster-shells of the shore of Ahine that is covered with the summer
herbs; but walk there after dawn." (This is Keichiū's interpretation of
the word *akashite*, "having made clear," and is the best in the present
writer's opinion; the latter commentators see in it a recommendation to
the exiled prince to clear the grass away on either side.) The word
*Ahine* calls, however, for special explanation in order that the full
import of the poem may be brought out. It properly signifies "sleeping
together" or "lying on each other," and is therefore applicable either
to the two spouses or to the summer grass. Indeed it is doubtful if it
be the name of any real place at all. The word *natsu-kusa* may also be
taken simply as a Pillow-Word for *Ahine*.—The total gist of the Song is
in any case a warning from the maiden to her lover to guard himself
against the perils of the journey.

<span id="fn_2237"></span>[375:7](kj150.htm#fr_2242.md) <span
id="page_377">p. 377</span> The meaning of this Song is: "It is too long
since thy departure. I can wait no longer, but will go and meet
thee."—The Verb "to meet" (*mukahe*) is in the original preceded by the
Pillow-Word *yama-tadzu*, which forms the subject of the note appended
to the poem by the compiler. The commentators are not agreed as to the
precise nature of the instrument intended; but it seems to have been
some kind of axe. The cause of its use as a Pillow-Word for "meeting "is
equally disputed. It only occurs written phonetically. The term
*tatsu-ge*, by which it is explained in the text, is there written <span
id="img_37700"></span> ![](img/37700.jpg), which does not help us much
towards understanding what is meant to be designated.

<span id="fn_2238"></span>[375:8](kj150.htm#fr_2243.md) So obscure is this
Song in the original, that Motowori confesses himself unable to make any
sense of it. The translator has adopted Mortise's interpretation,
according to which the gist of it is this: "Alas! my dear wife, who wast
so willing to be for ever united to me that thou didst even fix on the
spot in the funereal vale of Hatsuse where we should one day be buried
together! Alas for thee, whom at last I now see again "—In order to
arrive at this meaning, Moribe is obliged to prove more less
satisfactorily that the thrice repeated word *wo* signifies "vale "or
"mountain-fold "the first two times that it occurs, and "grave" the
third, and that *komoriku no hatsuse*, usually interpreted as secluded
"Hatsuse," means "the hidden castle," the "final place," *i.e.*, "the
tomb, It is also necessary to suppose, without authority, that the flags
mentioned by the poet are meant for funeral flags, and that the words
"prostrate like a *tsuki* bow," etc., which, according to the laws of
Japanese construction, precede instead of following the phrase "alas!
beloved spouse," etc., are but a Preface for the latter.—It will be seen
that the foundation on which Moribe's interpretation rests is slight,
and that Motowori was scarcely to be blamed for pronouncing the Song
incomprehensible. At the same time the translator has thought it better,
by following Moribe, to give *some* translation of it than to leave the
passage blank. With this warning, the student may search for other
possible meanings if he pleases.—Hatsuse is a still existent and
celebrated place among the mountains of Yamato. The etymology of the
name, unless we accept Moribe's mentioned above, is obscure. It is now
usually pronounced *Hase*. The *tsuki* is said to be almost
indistinguishable from the *keyaki* tree (*Zelkowa keaki*). The *adzusa*
seems to be the *Catalpa kaempferi*, but some believe it to be the
cherry tree.

<span id="fn_2239"></span>[375:9](kj150.htm#fr_2244.md) The first half of
this Song down to the words "hanging on the true piles true jewels" is a
Preface for what follows. The signification <span id="page_378">p.
378</span> of the rest is: "If my dearly loved sister-wife were still at
Hatsuse in Yamato, I would fly to her either in thought or deed; but now
that she has followed me into exile, the land of exile is good
enough:"—Moribe, while allowing the first half of the Song to be a
Preface for the rest, contends that it also should be credited with a
signification bearing on the subject-matter of the main part of the
Song. He supposes, namely, the religious ceremony, whatever it was, of
driving piles into the bed or bank of the river and of decorating them
with beads and a mirror, to have been one really performed by Princess
So-tohoshi to compass her lover's, return. In the translator's opinion,
it is more elegant and more in accordance with Archaic usage to consider
the Preface as having no special significance or connection (otherwise
than verbal) with the rest of the poem. The word *i-kuhi* or *i-guhi*,
rendered "sacred piles," occasions some difficulty; for it is not
certain whether Motowori is right in giving to the initial syllable *i*
the meaning of "sacred." It may be simply what has been termed an
"Ornamental Prefix," devoid of meaning. Motowori however points out that
this usage of it is restricted to Verbs, and does not occur with
Substantives. *Komoriku no*, the Pillow-Word for Hatsuse, is rendered by
"secluded" in accordance with Mabuchi's usually accepted derivation from
*komori-kuni*, "retired land." Moribe, notwithstanding what he has said
in his exegesis of the preceding poem (Note 8), is willing to allow
that, though perhaps not its original, this was its common, meaning even
in ancient times.

<span id="fn_2240"></span>[375:10](kj150.htm#fr_2245.md) *I.e.*, committed
suicide together.

<span id="fn_2241"></span>[375:11](kj150.htm#fr_2246.md) This expression is
interpreted to mean that these Songs were recited in monotone, as one
would read a book or tell a tale.
