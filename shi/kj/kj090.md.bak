## \[SECT. LXXXIII.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART VIII.—YAMATO-TAKE SLAYS THE RULERS OF SAGAMU.)\]

So reaching the Land of Wohari, he went into the house of Princess
Miyadzu, <span id="fr_1602"></span>[1](#fn_1598.md) ancestress of the
Rulers of Wohari, <span id="fr_1603"></span>[2](#fn_1599.md) and forthwith
thought to wed her; but thinking again that he would wed her when he
should return up \[toward the capital\], and having plighted his troth,
he went \[on\] into the Eastern Lands, and subdued and pacified all the
savage Deities and unsubmissive people of the mountains and rivers. So
then, when he reached the Land of Sagamu, <span
id="fr_1604"></span>[3](#fn_1600.md) the Ruler of the land lied, saying:
"In the middle of this moor is a great lagoon, and the Deity that dwells
in the middle of the lagoon is a very violent Deity." Hereupon
\[Yamato-take\] entered the moor to see the Deity. Then the Ruler of the
land set fire to the moor. So, knowing that he had been

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

deceived, he opened the mouth of the bag which his aunt, Her Augustness
Yamato-hime had bestowed on him, and saw that inside of it there was a
fire-striker. <span id="fr_1605"></span>[4](#fn_1601.md) Hereupon he first
mowed away the herbage with his august sword, took the fire-striker and
struck out fire, and, kindling a counter-fire, burnt \[the herbage\] and
drove back \[the other fire\], and returned forth, and killed and
destroyed all the Rulers <span id="fr_1606"></span>[5](#fn_1602.md) of that
Land, and forthwith set fire to and burnt them. So \[that place\] is now
called Yakidzu. <span id="fr_1607"></span>[6](#fn_1603.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1598"></span>[261:1](kj090.htm#fr_1602.md) <span
id="page_262">p. 262</span> Miyazu-hime (in the "Chronicles "and in the
printed editions of these "Records "previous to Motowori's written
Miyasu-hime without the *nigori*). Neither Motowori nor Tanigaha Shisei
makes any suggestion as to the signification of this name.

<span id="fn_1599"></span>[261:2](kj090.htm#fr_1603.md) *Wohari no
miyatsuko*.

<span id="fn_1600"></span>[261:3](kj090.htm#fr_1604.md) In the present time
*Sagami*. No authority great or small has given a satisfactory etymology
of this name, though numerous and elaborate attempts have been made to
explain it.

<span id="fn_1601"></span>[262:4](kj090.htm#fr_1605.md) In the original
*hi-uchi* (<span id="img_26200"></span> ![](img/26200.jpg)). Mr. Satow,
who has given a translation of this passage in a note to his third paper
on the "Rituals "to be found in Vol. IX, Pt. II. p. 202 of these
"Transaction," renders this word by "steel." The present writer prefers
not to prejudge the question as to whether the fire-striker "intended by
the author was a steel, or a wooden fire-drill. Motowori would seem to
have held the latter view, as in his gloss on this passage he refers to
the previous passage near the end of Sect. XXXII, where the fire-drill
is [explicitly](errata.htm#52.md) mentioned. He also quotes an ancient one
in which "a fire-striker of metal "is specially referred to, so that it
would seem that all fire-strikers were not of that material.

<span id="fn_1602"></span>[262:5](kj090.htm#fr_1606.md) Remember that this
word "Ruler" (Miyatsuko) had the acceptation of a "gentile name "as well
as of the name of an office, so that we may understand the author to
mean that Yamato-take destroyed the whole Ruling Family of Sagami.
Parallel passage of the "Chronicles'' has "he burnt all that rebel band,
and destroyed them."

<span id="fn_1603"></span>[262:6](kj090.htm#fr_1607.md) The words rendered
"that place" are supplied by Motowori, their omission being evidently a
copyist's error. *Yaki-dzu* signifies "the port of burning."
