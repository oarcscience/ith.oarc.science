## \[SECT. XXXIII.—THE AUGUST DESCENT FROM HEAVEN OF HIS AUGUSTNESS THE AUGUST GRANDCHILD.\]

Then the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity and the
High-Integrity-Deity <span id="fr_716"></span>[1](#fn_712.md) commanded and
charged the Heir Apparent <span id="fr_717"></span>[2](#fn_713.md) His
Augustness
Truly-Conqueror-I-Conquer-Swift-Heavenly-Great-Great-Ears <span
id="fr_718"></span>[3](#fn_714.md)

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[saying: The
Brave-Awful-Possessing-Male-Deity\] says that he has now
finished-pacifying the Central Land of Reed-Plains. So do thou, in
accordance with our gracious charge, descend to and dwell in and rule
over it." Then the Heir Apparent His Augustness
Truly-Conqueror-I-Conquer-Conquering-Swift-Heavenly-Great-Ears replied,
saying: "While I <span id="fr_719"></span>[4](#fn_715.md) have been getting
ready to descend, there has been born \[to me\] a child whose name is
His August ness
Heaven-Plenty-Earth-Plenty-Heaven's-Sun-Height-Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty. <span
id="fr_720"></span>[5](#fn_716.md) This child should be sent down."
\[ <span id="fr_721"></span>[6](#fn_717.md)As for this august child, <span
id="fr_722"></span>[7](#fn_718.md) he was augustly \[107\] joined to Her
Augustness Myriad-Looms-Luxuriant-Dragon-fly-Island-Princess, <span
id="fr_723"></span>[8](#fn_719.md) daughter of the High-Integrating-Deity,
and begot children: His Augustness-Heavenly-Rice-ear-Ruddy <span
id="fr_724"></span>[9](#fn_720.md) and next His Augustness
Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty. <span id="fr_725"></span>[10](#fn_721.md)\]
Therefore, in accordance with these words, they laid their command on
His Augustness Prince Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty, deigning to charge him with
these words: "This Luxuriant Reed-Plain-Land-of-Fresh-Rice-ears <span
id="fr_726"></span>[11](#fn_722.md) is the land over which thou shalt
rule." So \[he replied\]: "I will descend from Heaven according to your
commands." So when His Augustness-Prince-Rice-ear-Ruddy-Plenty was about
to descend from Heaven, there was at the eight-forking road of Heaven a
Deity whose refulgence reached upwards to the Plain of High Heaven and
downwards to the Central Land of \[108\] Reed-Plains. So then the
Heaven-Shining-Great-August Deity and the High-Integrating Deity
commanded and charged the Heavenly-Alarming-Female-Deity <span
id="fr_727"></span>[12](#fn_723.md) \[saying\]: Though thou art but a
delicate female, thou art a Deity who conquers in facing Deities. <span
id="fr_728"></span>[13](#fn_724.md) So be thou the

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

one to go and ask thus: 'This being the road by which our august child
is about to descend from Heaven, who is it that is thus there?'" <span
id="fr_729"></span>[14](#fn_725.md) So to this gracious question he
replied, saying "I <span id="fr_730"></span>[15](#fn_726.md) am an Earthly
Deity named the Deity Prince of Saruta. <span
id="fr_731"></span>[16](#fn_727.md) The reason for my coming here is that,
having heard of the \[intended\] descent of the august child of the
Heavenly Deities, I have come humbly to meet him and respectfully offer
myself as His Augustness's vanguard." <span
id="fr_732"></span>[17](#fn_728.md) Then joining to him His Augustness
Heavenly-Beckoning-Ancestor-Lord, His Augustness Grand-Jewel, Her
Augustness Heavenly-Alarming-Female, Her Augustness I-shi-ko-ri-do-me,
and His Augustness Jewel-Ancestor, <span
id="fr_733"></span>[18](#fn_729.md) in all five chiefs of companies, <span
id="fr_734"></span>[19](#fn_730.md) they sent him down from Heaven.
Thereupon they joined to him the eight-foot \[long\] curved jewels and
mirror that had allured \[the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity from the
Rock-Dwelling, <span id="fr_735"></span>[20](#fn_731.md)\] and, also the
Herb-Quelling-Great-Sword, <span id="fr_736"></span>[21](#fn_732.md) and
likewise the Deity Thought-Includer, the Hand-Strength-Male-Deity, and
the Deity Heavenly-Rock-Door-Opener <span
id="fr_737"></span>[22](#fn_733.md) of Eternal Night, <span
id="fr_738"></span>[23](#fn_734.md) and charged him thus: "Regard this
mirror exactly as if it were our august spirit, and reverence it as if
reverencing us." <span id="fr_739"></span>[24](#fn_735.md) Next did they
say: "Let the Deity Thought-Includer take in hand our affairs, and carry
on the government." These two Deities are worshipped at the temple of
Isuzu. <span id="fr_740"></span>[25](#fn_736.md) The next, the Deity of
Luxuriant-Food. <span id="fr_741"></span>[26](#fn_737.md) is the Deity
dwelling in the outer temple of Watarahi. <span
id="fr_742"></span>[27](#fn_738.md) The next, the Deity
Heavenly-Rock-Door-Opener, another name for whom is the
Wondrous-Rock-True-Gate-Deity, and another name for whom is the
Luxuriant-Rock-True-Gate-Deity, <span
id="fr_743"></span>[28](#fn_739.md)—this Deity of the August Gate. <span
id="fr_744"></span>[29](#fn_740.md) The next, the Deity Hand-Strength-Male,

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

dwells in Sanagata. <span id="fr_745"></span>[30](#fn_741.md) Now His
Augustness the Heavenly-Beckoning-Ancestor-Lord (<span class="small">is
the ancestor of the Nakatomi Chieftains</span>); <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_712"></span>[128:1](kj040.htm#fr_716.md) <span
id="page_131">p. 131</span> *Taka-no-kami*. See Sect. XXXI, Note 13.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[128:2](kj040.htm#fr_717.md) It will be remembered
that this god was son of the Sun-goddess (or of her brother
*Susa-no-wo*, "the Impetuous Male";—see Sect. XII, Note 18, and also the
first two sentences of Sect. XIV and the first sentence of Sect. XV).
The characters rendered "Heir Apparent" are <span id="img_13100"></span>
![](img/13100.jpg), which form the usual Chinese equivalent of that
term, and were borrowed by the Japanese. Motowori's reading of them as
*Hi-tsugi-no-miko*, "Prince of the Sun's Succession," has no authority
but his own patriotic fancy.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[128:3](kj040.htm#fr_718.md) For this tremendous
name see Sect. XIII, Note 18.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[129:4](kj040.htm#fr_719.md) The humble character
<span id="img_13101"></span> ![](img/13101.jpg), "servant" is used for
the First Personal Pronoun.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[129:5](kj040.htm#fr_720.md)
*Ame-nigishi-kuni-nigishi-ama-tsu-hi-daka-hiko-ho-no-ni-nigi-no-mi-koto*.
Excepting as regards the final *gi* of *ni-nigi*, which it is surely
better with Hirata to consider as helping to form the word *nigi*,
"plenty," than to take it as a separate word signifying "lord," as
Motowori does, the translation follows Motowori's interpretation of the
various component parts of this tremendous name, which is mostly
abbreviated to its latter portion. It is precisely to this latter
portion (the syllables *hiko ho-no nigi*) that considerable doubt
attaches. *Ho* might mean "fire" rather than "rice-ears," and Motowori
himself suggests that *ni-nigi* should perhaps be regarded as a
corruption of *nigi-kahi*, "plentiful spikes of grain," rather than as
"ruddy plenty." About the meaning of the rest of the name there cannot
be much doubt. "Heaven's Sun Height" must be under stood as an honorific
designation signifying "high as the sun in heaven."

<span id="fn_717"></span>[129:6](kj040.htm#fr_721.md) The translator puts
this sentence between brackets because it is an evident interruption of
the main story. Indeed the edition of 1688 prints it as a note to the
text. The grammar of it is curious, as, on a first <span
id="page_132">p. 132</span> reading, one would be tempted to suppose
that this child," *i.e.*, His August
*Ame-nigishi-kuni-nigishi-amatsu-hi-doka-hiko-ho-no-ni-nigi*, was the
father of *Hiko-ho-no-ni-nigi*. But the latter name is but an
abbreviated form of the former, and the god could not be his own father.
The meaning rather is (and such a construction is not so forced in
Japanese as it sounds in English): "As for the parentage of this child,
he was born of the marriage \[of His Augustness Truly-Conqueror-etc.\]
with Her Augustness Myriad-Looms-etc. Princess. There is, however, real
confusion in the traditional genealogy, as the "Chronicles" make the
deity in question father to His Augustness Heavenly-Rice-ear-Ruddy,
instead of younger brother.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[129:7](kj040.htm#fr_722.md) Viz. His Augustness
Truly-Conqueror-etc.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[129:8](kj040.htm#fr_723.md)
*Yorodzu-hata-toyo-aki-dzu-shi-hime-no-mikoto*. Mabuchi, as quoted by
Motowori, suggests that *yorodzu*, "myriad," should be connected with
the word *yoroshi* "good," as signifying an extreme degree, the *ne plus
ultra*. But, though perhaps a good guess at the origin in the word, it
need not affect our estimate of its actual signification. The translator
has, however, followed Mabuchi in considering the syllable *shi* as an
apocopated form of *shima*, "island," and *Aki-dzu-shi*\[*ma*\] as
having its usual signification of "Dragon-fly Island" (more literally
"Island of the Autumn Insect") rather than accept Motowori's explanation
of *shi* as representing the Verb *chijimu*, "to be puckered," and of
the whole compound *aki-dzu-shi* as signifying "crape like dragon-flies'
wings." Not only is there no mention of crape in other passages of these
"Records," but the derivation does not, to say the least, recommend
itself on [philological](errata.htm#19.md) grounds.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[129:9](kj040.htm#fr_724.md)
*Ame-no-ho-akari-no-Mikoto*. The word rendered "ripe" will bear equally
well the interpretation "red."

<span id="fn_721"></span>[129:10](kj040.htm#fr_725.md)
*Hiko-ho-no-ni-nigi*, the abbreviated form of the name in Note 6.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[129:11](kj040.htm#fr_726.md)
*Toyo-ashi-hara-no-midzu-hono-kuni*. This periphrastic synonym of Japan
has appeared under a slightly shorter form in Sect. IX (Note 18).

<span id="fn_723"></span>[129:12](kj040.htm#fr_727.md)
*Ame-no-udzu-me-no-kami*, the goddess whose loud, bold merriment was the
chief cause of the Sun-Goddess emerging from her retreat in the Cavern
(see Sect XVI, Note 28).

<span id="fn_724"></span>[129:13](kj040.htm#fr_728.md) *I.e.*, "The
brazen-facedness allows thee to stare others out of countenance, and
make them uneasy."

<span id="fn_725"></span>[130:14](kj040.htm#fr_729.md) Between this
sentence and the next, the Alarming-Female-Deity must be supposed to
have gone on her embassy and to have delivered the message with which
she had been entrusted.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[130:15](kj040.htm#fr_730.md) Written <span
id="img_13200"></span> ![](img/13200.jpg), literally "servant."

<span id="fn_727"></span>[130:16](kj040.htm#fr_731.md) <span
id="page_133">p. 133</span> *Saruta-biko-no-kami*. This is Motowori's
reading. The more usual reading is *Saruda-hiko*, transposing the
*nigori*. Hirata prefers to read *Sada-biko*, and takes *Saruda* or
*Sada* to be the name of a place, which indeed seems the most acceptable
view. The name actually signifies "monkey field." Motowori's
interpretation of its import is a marvellous example of Japanese
etymological gymnastics (see Vol. XV, p. 16 of his Commentary). Moribe's
derivation from *sari-hate-hiko* (<span id="img_13300"></span>
![](img/13300.jpg)) is no better.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[130:17](kj040.htm#fr_732.md) Or "guide."

<span id="fn_729"></span>[130:18](kj040.htm#fr_733.md) For these five names
and for the Deity Thought-Includer and the \[Heavenly\]
Hand-Strength-Male-Deity mentioned a few lines further on, see Sect.
XVI, Notes 15, 16, 28. 12, 13, 7, and 27 respectively.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[130:19](kj040.htm#fr_734.md) *Tomo-no-wo*. This
expression is here taken to refer to the various offices assumed by the
five deities in question at the time of the withdrawal of the
Sun-Goddess into the cave. It signifies properly the head of a company.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[130:20](kj040.htm#fr_735.md) The allusion is to
the story in Sect. XVI. Moribe, in his Critique on Motowori's
Commentary, points out that it was only the mirror which allured the
goddess from the cave. In the Japanese original of this passage,
however, even more than in the English translation, the expression "that
had allured" is made to both objects.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[130:21](kj040.htm#fr_736.md) Obtained from the
tail of the Serpent of Koshi. See the story in Sect. XVIII.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[130:22](kj040.htm#fr_737.md)
*Ame-no-iha-to-wake-no-kami*. Hirata observes that this must not be
considered as the name of an independent Deity, but be taken simply as
an alternative name of *Ame-no-jikara-wo-no-kami* (the
"Heavenly-Hand-Strength-Male-Deity"). The part taken by this Deity in
the legend narrated in Sect. XVI. seems a sufficient warrant for such an
opinion, though a little lower down in this Section the two are again
mentioned separately.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[130:23](kj040.htm#fr_738.md) *Toko-yo*. These
words, which, according to the rules of Japanese construction, are
placed at the commencement of the clause, must be understood to apply
either to the three gods collectively or to the first-mentioned (the
Deity Thought-Includer) alone.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[130:24](kj040.htm#fr_739.md) Or "worshipping
before us," or "in our presence." The strictly logical concordance of an
English sentence makes it appear as if the mirror were to be taken to
represent the spirit of both Deities whose names are subjects of the
first clause. In Japanese, however, all such concordances are much more
loosely observed, and it is only the spirit of the Sun-Goddess that we
must understand to be here intended.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[130:25](kj040.htm#fr_740.md) <span
id="page_134">p. 134</span> *Isuzu* (literally "fifty bells," or else
perhaps the name of a kind of grass with which the neighbourhood may
originally have been overgrown) is the name of the site of the "Inner
Temple" of Ise. It is in the Japanese text preceded by the Pillow-Word
*saku-kushiro*, literally "rent bracelet." See Mabuchi's "Dictionary of
Pillow-Words" *s. v*.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[130:26](kj040.htm#fr_741.md) *Toyo-uke-no-kami*,
the same as *Toyo-uke-bime* (see Sect. VII, Note 6). The mention of:
this goddess in this place is curious, as she would not seem to be
connected with the legend. Motowori, however, supposes that it is
through some accidental omission that she does not figure in the list of
deities said to have accompanied the heaven-descended Sovereign.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[130:27](kj040.htm#fr_742.md) This name signifies
"meeting when crossing" or "crossing to meet", and is connected by the
commentators with an unimportant tradition, for which see Motowori's
Commentary, Vol. XV, p. 48.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[130:28](kj040.htm#fr_743.md) These two names are
in the original *Kushi-iha-ma-do-no-kami* and *Toyo-iha-mado-no-kami*.
The tradition in the "Gleanings of Ancient Story" makes them two
separate deities.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[130:29](kj040.htm#fr_744.md) Viz. of the gate or
gates of the Imperial Palace.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[131:30](kj040.htm#fr_745.md) Etymology obscure.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[131:31](kj040.htm#fr_746.md) *Nakatomi no
murazhi*. *Nakatomi* is taken by Motowori to be a contraction of
*naka-tori-omi*, and by Mabuchi to be a contraction of *naka-tori-omi*,
either of which may be freely rendered "[middlemen](errata.htm#20.md),"
"intercessors," referring to the religious functions which were
hereditary in this family. See "Commentary on the Ritual of the General
Purification," Vol. II, pp. 2-3.)

<span id="fn_743"></span>[131:32](kj040.htm#fr_747.md) *Imibe no obito*.
*Imibe* is derived from *imu*, "to avoid," *i.e.* "to abstain from," and
*mure*, "a flock" or "collection of persons," "a clan," and refers to
the religious duties of this hereditary class of priests, which
naturally required their avoidance of all ceremonial uncleanness. The
word "priest" would fairly, though freely, represent the meaning of the
compound.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[131:33](kj040.htm#fr_748.md) *Saru me no kimi*.
For the traditional origin of this name see Sect. XXXV. These
"duchesses" were priestesses: but it is a matter of dispute between the
commentators whether the title was simply an official one, or hereditary
in the female line.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[131:34](kj040.htm#fr_749.md) *Kagami-tsukuri no
murazhi*. Of this family nothing would seem to be known.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[131:35](kj040.htm#fr_750.md) <span
id="page_135">p. 135</span> *Tama-no-ya* (or *Tama n’Oya*) *no murazhi*.
But the name should probably be *Tama-tsukuri no murazhi*, *i.e.*
"Jewel-Making Chieftains," a "gentile name" which is found in the later
literature. Perhaps, however, we should understand both this means and
the previous one to be simple inventions by names, of which divine
ancestry was claimed for the hereditary guilds of jewellers and
mirror-makers.
