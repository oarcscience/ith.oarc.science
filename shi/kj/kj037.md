## \[SECT. XXX.—THE AUGUST DELIBERATION FOR PACIFYING THE LAND.\]

The Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity commanded, saying: "The
Luxuriant-Reed-Plains-the-Land-of-Fresh-Rice-ears-of-a-Thousand-Autumns,—Of
Long-Five-Hundred-Autumns <span id="fr_633"></span>[1](#fn_629) is the
land which my august child His Augustness
Truly-Conqueror-I-Conquer-Conquering-Swift-Heavenly-Great-Great-Ears <span
id="fr_634"></span>[2](#fn_630) shall govern." Having \[thus\] deigned
to charge him, she sent him down from Heaven. <span
id="fr_635"></span>[3](#fn_631) Hereupon His Augustness
Heavenly-Great-Great-Ears, standing on the Floating Bridge of
Heaven, <span id="fr_636"></span>[4](#fn_632) said: "The
Luxuriant-Reed-Plains-the-Land-of-Fresh-Rice-ears-of-a-Thousand-Autumns,—of
Long-Five-Hundred-Autumns is painfully uproarious,—it is." <span
id="fr_637"></span>[5](#fn_633) With this announcement, he immediately
re-ascended, and informed the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity. Then
the High-August-Producing-Wondrous-Deity <span
id="fr_638"></span>[6](#fn_634) and the
Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity commanded the eight hundred myriad
Deities to assemble in a divine assembly in the bed of the Tranquil
River of Heaven, <span id="fr_639"></span>[7](#fn_635) and caused the
Deity Thought-Includer <span id="fr_640"></span>[8](#fn_636) to think
\[of a plan\], and said: <span id="fr_641"></span>[9](#fn_637) "This
Central Land of Reed-Plains is the land with which we

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

have deigned to charge our august child as the land which he shall
govern. So as he deems that violent and savage Earthly Deities <span
id="fr_642"></span>[10](#fn_638) are numerous in this land, \[69\] which
Deity shall we send to subdue them?" Then the Deity Thought-Includer and
likewise the eight hundred myriad Deities took counsel and said: "The
Deity Ame-no-ho-hi <span id="fr_643"></span>[11](#fn_639) is the one
that should be sent." So they sent the Deity Ame-no-ho-hi; but he at
once curried favour with the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land, and for
three years brought back no report.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_629"></span>[112:1](kj037.htm#fr_633) <span
id="page_113">p. 113</span>
*Toyo-ashi-hara-no-chi-aki-no-naga-i-ho-aki-no-midzu-ho-izo-kuni*,
*i.e.*, freely rendered, "ever fruitful Japan with its reed-covered
plains and its luxuriant rice-fields."

<span id="fn_630"></span>[112:2](kj037.htm#fr_634) See Sect. XIII, Note
18. Henceforward this tremendous name is mostly abbreviated to
*Ame-no-oshi-ho-mimi* (probably signifying "Heavenly-Great-Great-Ears.")

<span id="fn_631"></span>[112:3](kj037.htm#fr_635) So in the original.
The sense, however, is rather "told him to descend from Heaven;" for he
did not actually go further than the top of the "Floating Bridge," and
never came down to earth.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[112:4](kj037.htm#fr_636) See Sect. III, Note
3.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[112:5](kj037.htm#fr_637) The words "it is"
stand for *ari keri* in the original. *Conf*. Sect. X, Note 1.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[112:6](kj037.htm#fr_638)
*Taka-mi-musu-bi-no-kami*, first mentioned at the very commencement of
the work. In this legend this god's name is constantly coupled with that
of the Sun-Goddess, who alone, up to this point, had appeared as the
ruler of Heaven.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[112:7](kj037.htm#fr_639) See Sect. XIII, Note
12.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[112:8](kj037.htm#fr_640) See Sect. XVI, Note
7.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[112:9](kj037.htm#fr_641) The meaning must be,
as Motowori suggests, that the story was told first, and the Deity
Thought-Includer asked for his advice after he had heard it.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[113:10](kj037.htm#fr_642) See Sect. I, Note
11.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[113:11](kj037.htm#fr_643) See Sect. XIII, Note
19.
