<p>After this, the Heavenly Sovereign, being on [his] divine couch,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2259"></A><A HREF="#fn_2254"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> was sleeping at midday. Then he spoke to his Empress, saying: "Is there anything on thy mind?"

<P><A NAME="fn_2255"></A><A HREF="kj152.htm#fr_2260">380:2</A> Literally, "Hast thou anything to think about? "The same construction is used in the next sentence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2256"></A><A HREF="kj152.htm#fr_2261">380:3</A> <i>I.e.</i>, her son by her former husband King Oho-kusaka.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2257"></A><A HREF="kj152.htm#fr_2262">380:4</A> Literally, "below the palace." The same expression recurs further on. The parallel passage in the "Chronicles" has "below the upper storey," <i>i.e.</i>, in the court or garden of a two-storeyed house. With the small proportions assumed by Japanese architecture, conversation could well be overheard under these conditions.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_2261"></A><A HREF="kj152.htm#fr_2266">381:8</A> For Sugahara see Sect. LXXV, Note I. The Fushimi here mentioned, which is in Yamato, must not be confounded with the better known Fushimi in Yamashiro. The popular etymology of this name (and it is to be found in many books) traces it to <i>Fushi mi</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "lying three," in connection with the story of a man who "lay on the mound for three years." Probably <i>fuse-midzu</i>, "water laid on," a name perhaps given on account of an aqueduct or of water-pipes, was the original designation, which has been corrupted.</P>
