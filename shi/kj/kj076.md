palace, <span id="fr_1410"></span>[32](#fn_1406) and established the
Kahakami Tribe, <span id="fr_1411"></span>[33](#fn_1407) The next, His

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1375"></span>[225:1b](kj076.htm#fr_1379) <span
id="page_227">p. 227</span> For Shiki see Sect. LXIII, Note 1.
*Tama-kaki* signifies "jewel (*i.e.*, beautiful) hedge."

<span id="fn_1376"></span>[226:2](kj076.htm#fr_1380) This name and the
next have already been met with in Sect. LXI, as have those of Princess
Hibasu, King Tatasu-mechi, King Oho-tsutsuki-ne, Princess
Kari-bata-tobe, and King Inase-biko.

<span id="fn_1377"></span>[226:3](kj076.htm#fr_1381) See Sect. LXXI,
Note 8.

<span id="fn_1378"></span>[226:4](kj076.htm#fr_1382) The signification
of this name is not clear, but Motowori identifies Shiki with the place
of the same name.

<span id="fn_1379"></span>[226:5](kj076.htm#fr_1383) <span
id="page_228">p. 228</span> This name seems to be a string of Honorifics
[signifying](errata.htm#44) "great perfect prince ruling lord."

<span id="fn_1380"></span>[226:6](kj076.htm#fr_1384) *I.e.*, "great
middle prince," he being third of five children.

<span id="fn_1381"></span>[226:7](kj076.htm#fr_1385) *I.e.*, "Yamato
princess." She is a very celebrated personage in Japanese legendary
story,—high priestess of Ise and aunt of the hero Yamato-take. A
miraculous tale is related of her birth, and she is supposed to have
lived several hundreds of years.

<span id="fn_1382"></span>[226:8](kj076.htm#fr_1386) The signification
of this name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1383"></span>[226:9](kj076.htm#fr_1387) The signification
of this name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1384"></span>[226:10](kj076.htm#fr_1388) Motowori's
conjectural interpretation of this name is "jewel-perfect-lord."

<span id="fn_1385"></span>[226:11](kj076.htm#fr_1389) The signification
of *iga* is obscure. The other two elements of the compound signify
"perfect prince."

<span id="fn_1386"></span>[226:12](kj076.htm#fr_1390) Signification
obscure.

<span id="fn_1387"></span>[226:13](kj076.htm#fr_1391) Signification
obscure.

<span id="fn_1388"></span>[226:14](kj076.htm#fr_1392) Signification
obscure. The "Chronicles "read this name *Ike-baya*.

<span id="fn_1389"></span>[226:15](kj076.htm#fr_1393) *Azami-tsu-him*e,
Signification obscure.

<span id="fn_1390"></span>[226:16](kj076.htm#fr_1394) *i.e.*, probably
"the refulgent princess," the syllable *ya* being void of signification
as in *Ka-no-Nana-saku-ya-hime* (see Sect. XXXVII, Note 3). This name is
celebrated as that of the heroine of the fairy-tale entitled "Tale of a
Bamboo-Cutter." though there is no reason for identifying the two
personages.

<span id="fn_1391"></span>[226:17](kj076.htm#fr_1395) This name is
obscure, and Motowori suspects it of being corrupt.

<span id="fn_1392"></span>[226:18](kj076.htm#fr_1396) *Yamashiro no
ohokunino fuchi*. Yamashiro is the name of a province, and Ohokuni
("great land" that of a village, while Fuchi is a personal name written
with a character signifying "deep pool."

<span id="fn_1393"></span>[226:19](kj076.htm#fr_1397) *Ochiwake no
miko*. Motowori derives *ochi* from *oho*, "great, and *chi*, supposed
to be an Honorific, while *wake* is taken to mean "lord." After all, the
signification of the name remains obscure.

<span id="fn_1394"></span>[226:20](kj076.htm#fr_1398) *Ika-tarashi-hiko
no miko*. The name probably signifies "severe (or dignified) perfect
prince."

<span id="fn_1395"></span>[226:21](kj076.htm#fr_1399) This name is
obscure.

<span id="fn_1396"></span>[226:22](kj076.htm#fr_1400) *I.e.*,
Karibata-tobe, the younger sister.

<span id="fn_1397"></span>[226:23](kj076.htm#fr_1401) This name and the
next are obscure. The first of the two is not in the older editions, but
Motowori supplies what appears to be a lacuna in the text by adding the
five characters <span id="img_22800"></span> ![](img/22800.jpg).

<span id="fn_1398"></span>[226:24](kj076.htm#fr_1402) Signification
obscure.

<span id="fn_1399"></span>[226:25](kj076.htm#fr_1403) The actual word
"feet "is not in the original, but an equivalent Chinese measure is
used.

<span id="fn_1400"></span>[227:26](kj076.htm#fr_1404) <span
id="page_229">p. 229</span> *Chinu no ike*. The "Sea of Chinu" in the
province of Idzumi, which is the same as the "Pool" here mentioned, has
been mentioned in Sect. XLIV, Note 36.

<span id="fn_1401"></span>[227:27](kj076.htm#fr_1405) *Sayama no ike*,
in the province of Kahachi. The name probably signifies a "gorge" or
"defile."

<span id="fn_1402"></span>[227:28](kj076.htm#fr_1406) See above Sect.
XLIV, Note 31.

<span id="fn_1403"></span>[227:29](kj076.htm#fr_1407) *Totori* (lit.
"bird-catching") was in the province of Idzumi, and the name is said to
have been derived from the place having been one of those through which
Ohotaka of Yamanobe passed when pursuing the bird whose sight was to
make Prince Homachi-wake obtain the power of speech. (See the story as
given at the beginning of the next Section). The name of Kaha-kami
("head-waters of the river"), as we learn by comparison with the
parallel [passage](errata.htm#45) of the "Chronicles," is to be traced
to the River Udo, near whose head waters the palace in question is said
to have been situated.

<span id="fn_1404"></span>[227:30](kj076.htm#fr_1408) See Sect. XLV,
Note 5.

<span id="fn_1405"></span>[227:31](kj076.htm#fr_1409) See Sect. XLV,
Note 16.

<span id="fn_1406"></span>[227:32](kj076.htm#fr_1410) Or, "in that
temple."

wake*. Yamanobe (or Yamabe) is the name of a district in Yamato and
signifies "mountain-slope."

<span id="fn_1409"></span>[227:35](kj076.htm#fr_1413) *Sakikusa no
wake*. Of Sakikusa nothing is known. The word means "lily."

<span id="fn_1410"></span>[227:36](kj076.htm#fr_1414) *Inaki no wake*.
Which Inaki is meant is not known, there being several places of that
name in Japan. The name is connected with the word *ine*, "rice."

<span id="fn_1411"></span>[227:37](kj076.htm#fr_1415) *Ada no wake*. Of
Ada nothing is known.

<span id="fn_1412"></span>[227:38](kj076.htm#fr_1416) *Wohari no kuni no

moors."

<span id="fn_1413"></span>[227:39](kj076.htm#fr_1417) *Kibi no Ihanashi

province of Bizen, and seems to signify "rockless."

<span id="fn_1414"></span>[227:40](kj076.htm#fr_1418) *Koromo no wake*.
Motowori supposes this name to be corrupt. Koromo is the name of a
village in Mikaha.

<span id="fn_1415"></span>[227:41](kj076.htm#fr_1419) *Takasuka no
wake*. Nothing is known either of the place or of the family.

<span id="fn_1416"></span>[227:42](kj076.htm#fr_1420) *Asuka no kimi*.
It is not known where was this Asuka, which must not be confounded with
the famous Asuka mentioned in Sect. CXXXIII, Note 11.

<span id="fn_1417"></span>[227:43](kj076.htm#fr_1421) <span
id="page_230">p. 230</span> *Mure no wake*. There are several places
called Mure. The signification of the name is obscure.

<span id="fn_1418"></span>[227:44](kj076.htm#fr_1422) Or more literally,
"worshipped and celebrated the festivals at," etc.

<span id="fn_1419"></span>[227:45](kj076.htm#fr_1423) *Saho no
Anahobe-wake*. The name Anahobe is derived from Anahobe, the name of the
Emperor Yu-riyaku, and *be* "a tribe," it being related in the
"Chronicles" that the tribe which was established as his "name-proxy"
was so called.

<span id="fn_1420"></span>[227:46](kj076.htm#fr_1424) *Wotsuki no yama
no kimi*. Wotsuki is the name of a place in Afumi (Omi). The family name
must be interpreted to signify that they were wardens of the mountain.

<span id="fn_1421"></span>[227:47](kj076.htm#fr_1425) *Mikaha no Koromo
no kimi*. *Conf*. the name in Note 40, with which this is probably
identical. Motowori suspects an error in the text.

<span id="fn_1422"></span>[227:48](kj076.htm#fr_1426) *Kazuga no yama no
kimi*. *Conf*. the name in Note 46.

<span id="fn_1423"></span>[227:49](kj076.htm#fr_1427) *Koshi no ike no
kimi*. Nothing is known of the place or of the family; Koshi may or may
not be the northern province of that name.

<span id="fn_1424"></span>[227:50](kj076.htm#fr_1428) *Kasugabe no
kimi*. There were two places of the name of Kasugabe (*i.e.* "Kasuga
Clan," so called perhaps after a family that had resided there). It is
not known which is here alluded to.

<span id="fn_1425"></span>[227:51](kj076.htm#fr_1429) *Itoshi-be*. The
name, which is thus restored by Motowori, is variously mutilated in the
older editions. This is the first mention of adoption, lit. in Japanese
"child-proxy making." The custom is perpetually referred to in the later
portion of these "Records."

<span id="fn_1426"></span>[227:52](kj076.htm#fr_1430) *Haguhi no kimi*.
Haguhi is the name of a district in Noto. The derivation is obscure.

<span id="fn_1427"></span>[227:53](kj076.htm#fr_1431) *Miwo no kimi*.
Miwo is the name of a place in Afumi. It probably means "three
mountain-folds."
