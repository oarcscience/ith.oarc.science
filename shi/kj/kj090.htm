So then, when he reached the Land of Sagamu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1604"></A><A HREF="#fn_1600"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the Ruler of the land lied, saying: "In the middle of this moor is a great lagoon, and the Deity that dwells in the middle of the lagoon is a very violent Deity." Hereupon [Yamato-take] entered the moor to see the Deity. Then the Ruler of the land set fire to the moor. So, knowing that he had been</p>

<p>deceived, he opened the mouth of the bag which his aunt, Her Augustness Yamato-hime had bestowed on him, and saw that inside of it there was a fire-striker.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1605"></A><A HREF="#fn_1601"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Hereupon he first mowed away the herbage with his august sword, took the fire-striker and struck out fire, and, kindling a counter-fire, burnt [the herbage] and drove back [the other fire], and returned forth, and killed and destroyed all the Rulers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1606"></A><A HREF="#fn_1602"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of that Land, and forthwith set fire to and burnt them.

Neither Motowori nor Tanigaha Shisei makes any suggestion as to the signification of this name.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/26200.jpg">). Mr. Satow, who has given a translation of this passage in a note to his third paper on the "Rituals "to be found in Vol. IX, Pt. II. p. 202 of these "Transaction," renders this word by "steel." The present writer prefers not to prejudge the question as to whether the fire-striker "intended by the author was a steel, or a wooden fire-drill. Motowori would seem to have held the latter view, as in his gloss on this passage he refers to the previous passage near the end of Sect. XXXII, where the fire-drill is <A HREF="errata.htm#52">explicitly</A> mentioned. He also quotes an ancient one in which "a fire-striker of metal "is specially referred to, so that it would seem that all fire-strikers were not of that material.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1602"></A><A HREF="kj090.htm#fr_1606">262:5</A> Remember that this word "Ruler" (Miyatsuko) had the acceptation of a "gentile name "as well as of the name of an office, so that we may understand the author to mean that Yamato-take destroyed the whole Ruling Family of Sagami. Parallel passage of the "Chronicles'' has "he burnt all that rebel band, and destroyed them."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1603"></A><A HREF="kj090.htm#fr_1607">262:6</A> The words rendered "that place" are supplied by Motowori, their omission being evidently a copyist's error. <i>Yaki-dzu</i> signifies "the port of burning."</P>
