<p>Then Prince Oho-hatsuse,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2267"></A><A HREF="#fn_2262"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who at that time was a lad, was forthwith grieved and furious on hearing of this event, and went forthwith to his elder brother King Kurobiko,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2268"></A><A HREF="#fn_2263"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and said: "They have slain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2269"></A><A HREF="#fn_2264"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the Heavenly Sovereign. What shall be done?" But King Kurobiko was not startled, and was of unconcerned heart.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2270"></A><A HREF="#fn_2265"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> There upon King Oho-hatsuse reviled his elder brother, saying: "For one thing it being the Heavenly Sovereign, for another thing it being thy brother, how is thy heart without concern?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2271"></A><A HREF="#fn_2266"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> What! not startled, but unconcerned on hearing that they have slain thine elder brother!"&#8212;and forthwith he clutched him by the collar; dragged him out, drew his sword, and slew him. Again, going to his elder brother King Shiro-biko, he told him the circumstances as before. The unconcernedness again was like [that shown by] King Kuro-biko. [So King Oho-hatsuse,] having forthwith clutched him by the collar, pulled him along, and dug a pit on reaching Woharida,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2272"></A><A HREF="#fn_2267"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> buried him as he stood,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2273"></A><A HREF="#fn_2268"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> so that by the time he had been buried up to the loins, both his eyes burst out, and he died.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2274"></A><A HREF="#fn_2269"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>
