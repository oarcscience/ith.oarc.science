## \[SECT. CXXVI.—EMPEROR NIN-TOKU (PART VIII.—DEATH OF KING HAYABUSA-WAKE AND QUEEN MEDORI).\]

Again the Heavenly Sovereign begged for his younger half-sister Queen
Medori, using as middle-man his younger brother King Haya-busa-wake.
Then Queen Medori \[281\] spoke to King Hayabusa-wake, saying: "Owing to
the

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

violence of the Empress, \[the Heavenly Sovereign\] has not deigned to
take Yata-no-waki-iratsume \[into the Palace.\] So I will not
respectfully serve him. I will become the wife of Thine Augustness."
Forthwith they wedded each other, wherefore King Hayabusa-wake made no
report \[to the Heavenly Sovereign. <span
id="fr_2107"></span>[1](#fn_2102)\] Then the Heavenly Sovereign, going
straight to the place where Queen Medori dwelt, stood on the door-sill
of the palace. Hereupon, Queen Medori being at her loom, was weaving
garments. Then the Heavenly Sovereign sang saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Oh! for whom may be the garments that my Great Lady Medori
weaves?" <span id="fr_2108"></span>[2](#fn_2103)

</div>

Queen Medori replied in a Song saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"For an august veil for the high-going Falcon-Lord." <span
id="fr_2109"></span>[3](#fn_2104)

</div>

So the Heavenly Sovereign, perceiving her feelings, returned into the
palace. At this time <span id="fr_2110"></span>[4](#fn_2105) when her
husband King Hayabusa-wake came, his wife Queen Medori sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The lark flies to heaven. Oh! high-going Falcon-Lord, catch the
wren." <span id="fr_2111"></span>[5](#fn_2106)

</div>

\[282\] The Heavenly Sovereign, hearing this Song, <span
id="fr_2112"></span>[6](#fn_2107) forthwith raised an army, wishing to
slay King Hayabusa and Queen Medori, who then fled away together, and
ascended Mount Kurahashi. <span id="fr_2113"></span>[7](#fn_2108)
Thereupon King Hayabusa-wake sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Owing to the steepness of ladder-like Mount Kurahashi, being unable to
clamber \[up\] the rocks, oh! she takes my hand! <span
id="fr_2114"></span>[8](#fn_2109)

</div>

Again he sang, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Though ladder-like Mount Kurahashi be <span id="page_351">p. 351</span>
steep, it is not steep when I ascend it with my younger sister."

</div>

So when they fled thence, and reached Soni in Uda, <span
id="fr_2115"></span>[9](#fn_2110) the Imperials <span
id="fr_2116"></span>[10](#fn_2111) army pursued, overtook, and slew
them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2102"></span>[350:1](kj133.htm#fr_2107) <span
id="page_351">p. 351</span> *Scil*. of the success of his mediation.

<span id="fn_2103"></span>[350:2](kj133.htm#fr_2108) Or, "for whom is
the loom \[employed\], with which my Great Lady Medori weaves?"—The word
*hata* in Archaic Japanese signifies both "garment" and the instrument
which is used to weave a garment, *i.e.* a "loom" (<span
id="img_35100"></span> ![](img/35100.jpg) and <span
id="img_35101"></span> ![](img/35101.jpg)). In later times the second
meaning has prevailed to the exclusion of the first.

<span id="fn_2104"></span>[350:3](kj133.htm#fr_2109) There is here a
play on the name of the Queen's paramour Hayabusa-wake, which signifies
"Falcon-Lord" as in the translation—The parallel passage of the
"Chronicles" gives these two Songs as a single one which is put into the
mouth of Queen Medori's handmaidens,—is a more acceptable version of the
incident.

<span id="fn_2105"></span>[350:4](kj133.htm#fr_2110) Motowori suspects
that there is here an error in the text, which should, according to him,
read: "After this."

<span id="fn_2106"></span>[350:5](kj133.htm#fr_2111) The gist of this
Song is an instigation to murder the Emperor (whose name was
*Oho-sazaki*, *i.e.*, "Great Wren." Conf. Sect. CIV, Note 18), addressed
to the singer's husband (whose name was *Hayabusa-wake*, *i.e.*, "Falcon
Lord"). But the allusion to the lake remains obscure. Keichiū suggests
that it is simply mentioned as a term of comparison for the falcon's
power of flight, while Motowori opines that the meaning rather is: "The
lark flies so high up to heaven that it would be hard to catch it; but
the wren is an easy prey."

<span id="fn_2107"></span>[350:6](kj133.htm#fr_2112) Viz., as may be
supposed, repeated by some fourth person.

<span id="fn_2108"></span>[350:7](kj133.htm#fr_2113) *Kurahashi-yama*,
in Yamato.

<span id="fn_2109"></span>[350:8](kj133.htm#fr_2114) The Song, like the
next, is too clear to stand in need of explanation. "Ladder-like" is an
attempt to render the force of the Pillow-Word *hashi-tate*. See
Mabuchi's "Dictionary of Pillow-Words," s.v., for the exact force
attributed to it by Mabuchi.

<span id="fn_2110"></span>[351:9](kj133.htm#fr_2115) For Uda see Sect.
XLVI, Note, 14. The etymology of Soni is equally obscure.

<span id="fn_2111"></span>[351:10](kj133.htm#fr_2116) The character
<span id="img_35102"></span> ![](img/35102.jpg), though read by the
commentators with the usual Japanese Honorific *mi*, "august," has here
its proper Chinese signification of "Imperial."
