## \[SECT. LXXXI.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART VI.—YAMATO-TAKE SLAYS THE IDZUMO BRAVO).

Forthwith entering the Land of Idzumo, and wishing to slay the Idzumo
bravo, he on arriving, forthwith bound \[himself to him in\] friendship.
So, having secretly \[209\] made \[the wood of\] an oak \[-trees <span
id="fr_1590"></span>[1](#fn_1586)\] into a false sword and augustly
girded it, he went with the bravo to bathe the River Hi. <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[2](#fn_1587) Then, His Augustness Yamato-take

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

getting out of the river first, and taking and girding on the sword that
the Idzumo bravo had taken off and laid down, said: "Let us exchange
swords!" So afterwards the Idzumo bravo, getting out of the river,
girded on His Augustness Yamato-take's false sword. Hereupon His
Augustness Yamato-take, suggested, saying: "Come on! let us cross <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[3](#fn_1588) swords." Then on drawing his sword,
the Idzumo bravo could not draw the false sword. Forthwith His
Augustness Yamato-take drew his sword and slew the Idzumo bravo. Then he
sang augustly, saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Alas that the sword girded on the Idzumo bravo, and wound round with
many a creeper, should have had no true blade!" <span
id="fr_1593"></span>[4](#fn_1589)

</div>

So having thus extirpated the \[bravoes\] and made \[the land\] orderly,
he went up \[to the capital\], and made his report \[to the Heavenly
Sovereign\].

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1586"></span>[258:1](kj088.htm#fr_1590) The species
mentioned (*ichihi*) is the *Quercus gilva*.

<span id="fn_1587"></span>[258:2](kj088.htm#fr_1591) See Sect. XVIII,
Note 2.

<span id="fn_1588"></span>[259:3](kj088.htm#fr_1592) Lit., "let us join
swords." The word "suggested" (<span id="img_25900"></span>
![](img/25900.jpg)) in this sentence is an emendation of Motowori's, the
text having <span id="img_25901"></span> ![](img/25901.jpg),
"slandered." The older printed editions, while retaining the character
<span id="img_25902"></span> ![](img/25902.jpg), read it *azamukite*,
"deceived."

<span id="fn_1589"></span>[259:4](kj088.htm#fr_1593) In its position in
the present text, this Song must be taken as an ironical lament of the
Prince for the dead bravo. In the "Chronicle" the time and the heroes of
the episode, and the singers of the Song are all different, and in that
context the lament sounds like a genuine one. The reader will remember
what was said in the Introduction as to the use of creepers for string.
That mentioned in the text is supposed to be the *Cocculus thunbergi*.
