## \[SECT. CXLVI.—EMPEROR AN-KŌ (PART III.—PRINCE OHO HATSUSE SLAYS PRINCES KURO-BIKO AND SHIRO-BIRO).\]

Then Prince Oho-hatsuse, <span id="fr_2267"></span>[1](#fn_2262.md) who at
that time was a lad, was forthwith grieved and furious on hearing of
this event, and went forthwith to his elder brother King Kurobiko, <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2](#fn_2263.md) and said: "They have slain <span
id="fr_2269"></span>[3](#fn_2264.md) the Heavenly Sovereign. What shall be
done?" But King Kurobiko was not startled, and was of unconcerned
heart. <span id="fr_2270"></span>[4](#fn_2265.md) There upon King
Oho-hatsuse reviled his elder brother, saying: "For one thing it being
the Heavenly Sovereign, for another thing it being thy brother, how is
thy heart without concern? <span id="fr_2271"></span>[5](#fn_2266.md) What!
not startled, but unconcerned on hearing that they have slain thine
elder brother!"—and forthwith he clutched him by the collar; dragged him
out, drew his sword, and slew him. Again, going to his elder brother
King Shiro-biko, he told him the circumstances as before. The
unconcernedness again was like \[that shown by\] King Kuro-biko. \[So
King Oho-hatsuse,\] having forthwith clutched him by the collar, pulled
him along, and dug a pit on reaching Woharida, <span
id="fr_2272"></span>[6](#fn_2267.md) buried him as he stood, <span
id="fr_2273"></span>[7](#fn_2268.md) so that by the time he had been buried
up to the loins, both his eyes burst out, and he died. <span
id="fr_2274"></span>[8](#fn_2269.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2262"></span>[382:1](kj153.htm#fr_2267.md) <span
id="page_382">p. 382</span> See Sect. [CXXXVII](errata.htm#93.md), Note 11.

<span id="fn_2263"></span>[382:2](kj153.htm#fr_2268.md) See Sect. CXXXVII,
Note 6.

<span id="fn_2264"></span>[382:3](kj153.htm#fr_2269.md) Literally, "taken."

<span id="fn_2265"></span>[382:4](kj153.htm#fr_2270.md) *I.e.*, treated the
matter with indifference.

<span id="fn_2266"></span>[382:5](kj153.htm#fr_2271.md) Literally,
"[without](errata.htm#94.md) relying," as if the speaker meant to say that
the dead man could not rely on him for vengeance.

<span id="fn_2267"></span>[382:6](kj153.htm#fr_2272.md) In Yamato. The name
seems to mean "new tilled field"

<span id="fn_2268"></span>[382:7](kj153.htm#fr_2273.md) Written <span
id="img_38200"></span> ![](img/38200.jpg) in the text followed by
Motowori. The other reading <span id="img_38201"></span>
![](img/38201.jpg) is untenable.

<span id="fn_2269"></span>[382:8](kj153.htm#fr_2274.md) <span
id="page_383">p. 383</span> In order to account for such an effect from
so apparently insufficient a cause, Motowori supposes that after the
prince had been made to stand up to the height of his loins in the pit,
the latter was filled by having stones thrown into it, whereby his feet
and legs would be crushed.
