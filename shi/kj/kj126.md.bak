## \[SECT. CXIX.—EMPEROR NIN-TOKU (PART I.—GENEALOGIES).\]

His Augustness Oho-sazaki dwelt in the palace of Takatsu <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2](#fn_2019.md) at Naniha, and ruled the Empire. This
Heavenly Sovereign wedded (<span class="small">the Empress <span
id="fr_2025"></span>[3](#fn_2020)</span>.md) Her Augustness
Iha-no-hime, <span id="fr_2026"></span>[4](#fn_2021.md) daughter of
Kadzuraki-no-sotsu-biko, <span id="fr_2027"></span>[5](#fn_2022.md) and
begot august children: His Augustness Ohoye-no-izaho-wake; <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[6](#fn_2023.md) next the Middle King of the Inlet of
Sumi; <span id="fr_2029"></span>[7](#fn_2024.md) next His Augustness
Midzu-ha-wake of Tajihi; <span id="fr_2030"></span>[8](#fn_2025.md) next
His Augustness the Noble Wo-asadzuma-no-waku-go <span
id="fr_2031"></span>[9](#fn_2026.md) (<span class="small">four
Deities.</span>) Again he wedded Princess Kami-naga, daughter of the
Duke of Muragata in Himuka, as mentioned above, <span
id="fr_2032"></span>[10](#fn_2027.md) and begot august children:
Hatabi-no-oho-iratsuko, <span id="fr_2033"></span>[11](#fn_2028.md) another
\[268\] name for whom was the King of Great Kusaka; <span
id="fr_2034"></span>[12](#fn_2029.md) next Hatabi-no-waki-iratsume, <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[13](#fn_2030.md) another name for whom was Her
Augustness Princess Nagahi, <span id="fr_2036"></span>[14](#fn_2031.md) and
another name was Her Augustness Waka-kusaka-be <span
id="fr_2037"></span>[15](#fn_2032.md)(<span class="small">Two
Deities.</span>) Again he wedded his younger half-sister
Yata-no-waki-iratsume <span id="fr_2038"></span>[16](#fn_2033.md) Again he
wedded his younger half-sister Uji-no-waki-iratsume. These two Deities
had no august children. Altogether the august children of this Heavenly
Sovereign Oho-sakaki \[numbered\] in all six Deities, (<span
class="small">Five Kings and one Queen</span>). So His Augustness
Izaho-wake \[was he who afterwards\] ruled the Empire. Next His
Augustness Tajihi-no midzu-ha-wake likewise ruled the Empire. Next His
Augustness the Noble Oh-asadzuma-no-waku-go likewise ruled the
Empire. <span id="fr_2039"></span>[17](#fn_2034.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2018"></span>[333:1](kj126.htm#fr_2023.md) <span
id="page_333">p. 333</span> Literally, "lower volume"(there being three
in all). See Author's Preface, Note 1.

<span id="fn_2019"></span>[333:2](kj126.htm#fr_2024.md) *I.e.*, "high
port."

<span id="fn_2020"></span>[333:3](kj126.htm#fr_2025.md) <span
id="page_334">p. 334</span> Motowori surmises that the reason why the
characters [signifying](errata.htm#81.md) "Empress" are in all the text
here written in small characters is on account of this personage not
having been of Imperial birth.

<span id="fn_2021"></span>[333:4](kj126.htm#fr_2026.md) *I.e.*, "the rock
princess." Motowori supposes the name to be indicative of prosperity and
long life.

<span id="fn_2022"></span>[333:5](kj126.htm#fr_2027.md) See Sect. LXI, Note
55,

<span id="fn_2023"></span>[333:6](kj126.htm#fr_2028.md) *I.e.*, "the elder
brother lord Izaho," the latter name being of uncertain import.

<span id="fn_2024"></span>[333:7](kj126.htm#fr_2029.md) *Sumi-no
ye-no-naka-tsu-miko*. Both the phrase "middle king" and the Inlet of
Sumi have been already commented on.

<span id="fn_2025"></span>[333:8](kj126.htm#fr_2030.md) *Tajihi no
midzu-ha-wake*. Tajihi is the name of a place in Kahachi. The
traditional origin of its application to this will be found in
Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XXXV, p. 6. *Midzu-ha-wake* probably means
"the lord with the beautiful teeth."

<span id="fn_2026"></span>[333:9](kj126.htm#fr_2031.md)
*Wo-asadzuma-no-waku-go no sukune*. Asadzuma is the name of a place in
Yamato, and *wo* (though written <span id="img_33400"></span>
![](img/33400.jpg)) seems to be the slightly Honorific Prefix *wo*
(<span id="img_33401"></span> ![](img/33401.jpg)) whose proper
signification is "small" *Waku-go* means "younger child."

<span id="fn_2027"></span>[333:10](kj126.htm#fr_2032.md) See Sect. CVII.

<span id="fn_2028"></span>[333:11](kj126.htm#fr_2033.md) *I.e.*, "the great
lord of Hatabi." *Hatabi* is altogether obscure.

<span id="fn_2029"></span>[333:12](kj126.htm#fr_2034.md) *Oha-kusaka no
miko*. For *Kusaka* see Sect. CI, Note 2.

<span id="fn_2030"></span>[333:13](kj126.htm#fr_2035.md) *I.e.*, "the young
lady of Hatabi." Conf. Note 1 I.

<span id="fn_2031"></span>[333:14](kj126.htm#fr_2036.md) *Nagahi-hime*.
This name is obscure.

<span id="fn_2032"></span>[333:15](kj126.htm#fr_2037.md) *Kusaka-be* is an
alternative form of *Kusaka*. The compound therefore signifies "young
princess of Kusaka."

<span id="fn_2033"></span>[333:16](kj126.htm#fr_2038.md) This name and the
following have already appeared in the genealogies of the preceding
reign (Sect. CIV.)

<span id="fn_2034"></span>[333:17](kj126.htm#fr_2039.md) These were the
Emperors Ri-chiu, Han-zei, and In-giyo.
