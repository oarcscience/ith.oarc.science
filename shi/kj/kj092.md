## \[SECT. LXXXV.—EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART X.—YAMATO-TAKE SLAYS THE DEITY OF THE ASHIGARA PASS.)\]

When, having thence penetrated on and subdued all the savage
Yemishi <span id="fr_1616"></span>[1](#fn_1612.md) and likewise pacified
all the savage Deities of the mountains and rivers, he was returning up
\[to the capital\], he, on reaching the foot of the Ashigara Pass, <span
id="fr_1617"></span>[2](#fn_1613.md) was eating his august provisions, when
the Deity of the pass, transformed into a white deer, came and stood
\[before him\]. Then forthwith, on his waiting <span
id="fr_1618"></span>[3](#fn_1614.md) and striking \[the deer\] with a scrap
of wild chive, <span id="fr_1619"></span>[4](#fn_1615.md) \[the deer\] was
hit in the eye and struck dead. So, mounting to

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

the top of the pass, he sighed three times and spoke, saying: "*Adzuma
ha ya!*" <span id="fr_1620"></span>[5](#fn_1616.md) So that land is called
by the name of Adzuma.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1612"></span>[264:1](kj092.htm#fr_1616.md) This is the
traditional ancient reading of what is according to the modern
pronunciation *Yezo*, while the Chinese characters <span
id="img_26500"></span> ![](img/26500.jpg), with which the name is
written, signify "Prawn Barbarians," in allusion (if Motowori may be
trusted) to the long beards which make their fades resemble a prawn's
head. The hairy barbarians known to English readers as *Ainos*, and
whose name of *Yezo* is applied by the Japanese to the northernmost
large island of the Japanese Archipelago, which is still chiefly
tenanted by them, are almost certainly here referred to. In ancient
times they inhabited a great part of the Main Island of Japan. The
translator may add that the genuiness of the so-called ancient reading
"*Yemishi*" appears to him doubtful. The name known to the people
themselves, and which apparently can be traced as far as Kamschatka, is
*Yezo*.

<span id="fn_1613"></span>[264:2](kj092.htm#fr_1617.md) *Ashigara-zaka*,
one of the passes from Sagami into Suruga leading towards Mount Fuji.

<span id="fn_1614"></span>[264:3](kj092.htm#fr_1618.md) *I.e.*, lying in
ambush.

<span id="fn_1615"></span>[264:4](kj092.htm#fr_1619.md) *Nira*, the *Allium
odorum*.

<span id="fn_1616"></span>[265:5](kj092.htm#fr_1620.md) *I.e.*, "my wife!
"*Adzuma* is still used as a poetical designation of Eastern Japan. The
translator doubts the correctness of the derivation of it given in the
text, although it is universally accepted and certainly fits in well
with the graceful legend by which it is here accounted for.
