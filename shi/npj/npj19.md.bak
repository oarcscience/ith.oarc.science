# SOTOBA KOMACHI

By KWANAMI

PERSONS

A PRIEST OF THE KŌYASAN.  
SECOND PRIEST.  
ONO NO KOMACHI.  
CHORUS.

PRIEST.

We who on shallow hills <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) have built
our home  
In the heart's deep recess seek solitude.

(*Turning to the audience*.)

I am a priest of the Kōyasan. I am minded to go up to the Capital to
visit the shrines and sanctuaries there.

The Buddha of the Past is gone,  
And he that shall be Buddha has not yet come into the world.

SECOND PRIEST.

In a dream-lull our lives are passed; all, all  
That round us lies  
Is visionary, void.  
Yet got we by rare fortune at our birth  
Man's shape, that is hard to get;  
And dearer gift was given us, harder to win,  
The doctrine of Buddha, seed of our Salvation.  
And me this only thought possessed,  
How I might bring that seed to blossom, till at last  
I drew this sombre cassock across my back.  
And knowing now the lives before my birth,  
No love I owe  
To those that to this life engendered me,  
Nor seek a care (have I not disavowed  
Such hollow bonds?) from child by me begot.  
A thousand leagues  
Is little road <span id="page_115">p. 115</span>  
To the pilgrim's feet.  
The fields his bed,  
The hills his home  
Till the travel's close.

PRIEST.

We have come so fast that we have reached the pine-woods of Abeno, in
the country of Tsu. Let us rest in this place.

(*They sit down by the Waki's pillar*.)

KOMACHI.

Like a root-cut reed, <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_89.md)  
Should the tide entice,  
I would come, I think; but now  
No wave asks; no stream stirs.  
Long ago I was full of pride;  
Crowned with nodding tresses, halcyon locks,  
I walked like a young willow delicately wafted  
By the winds of Spring.  
I spoke with the voice of a nightingale that has sipped the dew.  
I was lovelier than the petals of the wild-rose open-stretched  
In the hour before its fall.  
But now I am grown loathsome even to sluts,  
Poor girls of the people, and they and all men  
Turn scornful from me.  
Unhappy months and days pile up their score;  
I am old; old by a hundred years.  
In the City I fear men's eyes,  
And at dusk, lest they should cry "Is it she?"  
Westward with the moon I creep  
From the cloud-high City of the Hundred Towers.  
No guard will question, none challenge  
Pilgrim so wretched: yet must I he walking  
Hid ever in shadow of the trees.  
Past the Lovers' Tomb,  
And the Hill of Autumn  
To the River of Katsura, the boats, the moonlight.

(*She shrinks back and covers her face, frightened of being known*.)

 

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

Who are those rowing in the boats? <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_90.md)  
Oh, I am weary. I will sit on this tree-stump and rest awhile.

PRIEST.

Come! The sun is sinking; we must hasten on our way. Look, look at that
beggar there! It is a holy Stūpa that she is sitting on! I must tell her
to come off it.

Now then, what is that you are sitting on? Is it not a holy Stūpa, the
worshipful Body of Buddha? Come off it and rest in some other place.

KOMACHI.

Buddha's worshipful body, you say? But I could see no writing on it, nor
any figure carved. I thought it was only a tree-stump.

PRIEST.

Even the little black tree on the hillside  
When it has put its blossoms on  
Cannot be hid;  
And think you that this tree  
Cut fivefold in the fashion of Buddha's holy form  
Shall not make manifest its power?

KOMACHI.

I too am a poor withered bough.  
But there are flowers at my heart, <span id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_91.md)  
Good enough, maybe, for an offering.  
But why is this called Buddha's body?

PRIEST.

Hear then! This Stūpa is the Body of the Diamond Lord. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[3](#fn_92.md) It is the symbol of his incarnation.

KOMACHI.

And in what elements did he choose to manifest his body?

 

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

PRIEST.

Earth, water, wind, fire and space.

KOMACHI.

Of these five man also is compounded. Where then is the difference?

PRIEST.

The forms are the same, but not the virtue.

KOMACHI.

And what is the virtue of the Stūpa?

PRIEST.

"He that has looked once upon the Stūpa, shall escape forever from the
Three Paths of Evil." <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_93.md)

KOMACHI.

"One thought can sow salvation in the heart." <span
id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_94.md) Is that of less price?

SECOND PRIEST.

If your heart has seen salvation, how comes it that you linger in the
World?

KOMACHI.

It is my body that lingers, for my heart left it long ago.

PRIEST.

You have no heart at all, or you would have known the Body of Buddha.

KOMACHI.

It was because I knew it that I came to see it!

SECOND PRIEST.

And knowing what you know, you sprawled upon it without a word of
prayer?

KOMACHI.

It was on the ground already. What harm could it get by my resting on
it?

 

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

PRIEST.

It was an act of discord. <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_95.md)

KOMACHI.

Sometimes from discord salvation springs.

SECOND PRIEST.

From the malice of Daiba ... <span id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_96.md)

KOMACHI.

As from the mercy of Kwannon. <span id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_97.md)

PRIEST.

From the folly of Handoku ...  <span id="fr_100"></span>[4](#fn_98.md)

KOMACHI.

As from the wisdom of Monju. <span id="fr_101"></span>[5](#fn_99.md)

SECOND PRIEST.

That which is called Evil

KOMACHI.

Is Good.

PRIEST.

That which is called Illusion

KOMACHI.

Is Salvation. <span id="fr_102"></span>[6](#fn_100.md)

SECOND PRIEST.

For Salvation

 

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

KOMACHI.

Cannot be planted like a tree.

PRIEST.

And the Heart's Mirror

KOMACHI.

Hangs in the void.

CHORUS (*speaking for* KOMACHI).

"Nothing is real.  
Between Buddha and Man  
Is no distinction, but a seeming of difference planned  
For the welfare of the humble , the ill-instructed,  
Whom he has vowed to save.  
Sin itself may be the ladder of salvation."  
So she spoke, eagerly; and the priests,  
"A saint, a saint is this decrepit, outcast soul."  
And bending their heads to the ground,  
Three times did homage before her.

KOMACHI.

I now emboldened  
Recite a riddle, a jesting song.  
"Were I in Heaven  
The Stūpa were an ill seat;  
But here, in the world without,  
What harm is done?" <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_101.md)

CHORUS.

The priests would have rebuked her;  
But they have found their match.

PRIEST.

Who are you? Pray tell us the name you had, and we will pray  
for you when you are dead.

KOMACHI.

Shame covers me when I speak my name; but if you will pray for <span
id="page_120">p. 120</span> me, I will try to tell you. This is my name;
write it down in your prayer-list: I am the ruins of Komachi, daughter
of Ono no Yoshizane, Governor of the land of Dewa.

PRIESTS.

Oh piteous, piteous! Is this  
Komachi that once  
Was a bright flower,  
Komachi the beautiful, whose dark brows  
Linked like young moons;  
Her face white-farded ever;  
Whose many, many damask robes  
Filled cedar-scented halls?

KOMACHI.

I made verses in our speech  
And in the speech of the foreign Court.

CHORUS.

The cup she held at the feast  
Like gentle moonlight dropped its glint on her sleeve.  
Oh how fell she from splendour,  
How came the white of winter  
To crown her head?  
Where are gone the lovely locks, double-twined,  
The coils of jet?  
Lank wisps, scant curls wither now  
On wilted flesh;  
And twin-arches, moth-brows tinge no more  
With the hue of far hills. "Oh cover, cover  
From the creeping light of dawn  
Silted seaweed locks that of a hundred years  
Lack now but one.  
Oh hide me from my shame."

(KOMACHI *hides her face*.)

CHORUS (*speaking for the* PRIEST).

What is it you carry in the wallet string at your neck?

KOMACHI.

Death may come to-day--or hunger to-morrow. <span id="page_121">p.
121</span>  
A few beans and a cake of millet:  
That is what I carry in my bag.

CHORUS.

And in the wallet on your back?

KOMACHI.

A garment stained with dust and sweat.

CHORUS.

And in the basket on your arm?

KOMACHI.

Sagittaries white and black.

CHORUS.

Tattered cloak, <span id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_102.md)

KOMACHI.

Broken hat . . .

CHORUS.

She cannot hide her face from our eyes;  
And how her limbs

KOMACHI.

From rain and dew, hoar-frost and snow?

CHORUS (*speaking for* KOMACHI *while she mimes the actions they
describe*).

Not rags enough to wipe the tears from my eyes!  
Now, wandering along the roads  
I beg an alms of those that pass.  
And when they will not give,  
An evil rage, a very madness possesses me.  
My voice changes.  
Oh terrible!

 

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

KOMACHI (*thrusting her hat under the* PRIESTS' *noses and shrieking at
them menacingly*).

Grr! You priests, give me something: give me something ... Ah!

PRIEST.

What do you want?

KOMACHI.

Let me go to Komachi. <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_103.md)

PRIEST.

But you told us you were Komachi. What folly is this you are talking?

KOMACHI.

No, no.... Komachi was very beautiful.  
Many letters came to her, many messages,--  
Thick as raindrops out of a black summer sky.  
But she sent no answer, not even an empty word.  
And now in punishment she has grown old:  
She has lived a hundred years--  
I love her, oh I love her!

PRIEST.

You love Komachi? Say then, whose spirit has possessed you?

KOMACHI.

There were many who set their hearts on her,  
But among them all  
It was Shōshō who loved her best,  
Shii no Shōshō of the Deep Grass. <span id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_104.md)

CHORUS (*speaking for* KOMACHI*, i. e. for the spirit of Sōshō*).

The wheel goes back; I live again through the cycle of my woes.  
Again I travel to the shaft-bench.  
The sun ... what hour does he show? <span id="page_123">p. 123</span>  
Dusk. . . . Alone in the moonlight  
I must go my way.  
Though the watchmen of the barriers  
Stand across my path,  
They shall not stop me!

(*Attendants robe* KOMACHI *in the Court hat and travelling-cloak of
Shōshō*.)

Look, I go!

KOMACHI.

Lifting the white skirts of my trailing dress,

CHORUS (*speaking for* KOMACHI*, while she, dressed as her lover Shōshō,
mimes the night-journey*).

Pulling down over my ears the tall, nodding hat,  
Tying over my head the long sleeves of my hunting cloak,  
Hidden from the eyes of men,  
In moonlight, in darkness,  
On rainy nights I travelled; on windy nights,  
Under a shower of leaves; when the snow was deep,

KOMACHI.

And when water dripped at the roof-eaves,--tok, tok . . .

CHORUS.

Swiftly, swiftly coming and going, coming and going  
One night, two nights, three nights,  
Ten nights (and this was harvest night) . . .  
I never saw her, yet I travelled;  
Faithful as the cock who marks each day the dawn,  
I carved my marks on the bench.  
I was to come a hundred times;  
There lacked but one . . .

KOMACHI (*feeling the death-agony of Shōshō*).

My eyes dazzle. Oh the pain, the pain!

CHORUS.

Oh the pain! and desperate,  
Before the last night had come,  
He died,--Shii no Shōshō the Captain.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

(*Speaking for* KOMACHI*, who is now no longer possessed by Shōshō's
spirit*.)

Was it his spirit that possessed me,  
Was it his anger that broke my wits?  
If this be so, let me pray for the life hereafter,  
Where alone is comfort;  
Piling high the sands <span id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_105.md)  
Till I be burnished as gold. <span id="fr_108"></span>[2](#fn_106.md)  
See, I offer my flower <span id="fr_109"></span>[3](#fn_107.md) to
Buddha,  
1 hold it in both hands.  
Oh may He lead me into the Path of Truth,  
Into the Path of Truth.
