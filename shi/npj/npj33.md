### NOTE ON TANIKŌ AND IKENIYE.

BOTH of these plays deal with the ruthless exactions of religion; in
each the first part lends itself better to translation than the second.
*Tanikō* is still played; but *Ikeniye*, though printed by both Owada
and Haga, has probably not been staged for many centuries.

The pilgrims of *Tanikō* are *Yamabushi*, "mountaineers," to whom
reference has been made on page [33](npj06.htm#page_33.md). They called
themselves *Shugenja*, "portent-workers," and claimed to be the
knight-errants of Buddhism. But their conduct seems to have differed
little from that of the *Sōhei* (armed monks) who poured down in hordes
from Mount Hiyei to terrorize the inhabitants of the surrounding
country. Some one in the *Genji Monogatari* is said to have "collected a
crowd of evil-looking Yamabushi, desperate, stick-at-nothing fellows."

Ikeniye, the title of the second play, means "Pool Sacrifice," but also
"Living Sacrifice," i. e. human sacrifice.
