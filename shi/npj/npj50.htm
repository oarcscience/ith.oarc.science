<P ALIGN="CENTER">By SEAMI</P>
<P>GIO was the mistress of Kiyomori (1118-1181), the greatest of the Tairas. One day there arrived at his camp a famous dancing-.girl called Hotoke. Kiyomori was for sending her away; but Gi&#333;, who had heard wonderful stories of Hotoke's beauty, was anxious to see her, and persuaded Kiyomori to let Hotoke dance before him.</P>
<P>Kiyomori fell in love with the dancer, and after a while Gi&#333; was dismissed. She became a nun, and with her mother and sister lived in a hut in the wilds of Sagano.</P>
<P>Hotoke, full of remorse at her rival's dismissal, found no pleasure in her new honours, and saying "It was I who brought her to this," fled in nun's clothing to the hut at Sagano. Here the four women lived together, singing ceaseless prayers to Buddha.</P>
<P>In the play the ghost of Hotoke appears to a "travelling priest" and tells the story, which is indeed a curious and arresting one.</P>
