### TŌRU

BY KWANAMI OR SEAMI

TŌRU was a prince who built a great palace at Rokujō-kawara, near Kyōto.
In its grounds was a counterfeit of the bay of Naniwa, which was filled
and emptied twice a day in imitation of the tides. Labourers toiled up
from the sea-shore, which was many miles distant, carrying pails of salt
water.

In the play a priest passing through Rokujō-kawara meets an old man
carrying salt-water pails. It is the ghost of Tōru. In the second part
he rehearses the luxury and splendour of his life at the great palace
Rokujō-kawara no In.
