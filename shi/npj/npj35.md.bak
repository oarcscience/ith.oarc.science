### IKENIYE (THE POOL-SACRIFICE)

PART I

By SEAMI <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_184.md)

PERSONS

THE TRAVELLER.  
THE INNKEEPER.  
HIS WIFE.  
THE PRIEST.  
HIS DAUGHTER.  
THE ACOLYTE.  
CHORUS.

TRAVELLER.

I am a man who lives in the Capital. Maybe because of some great wrong I
did in a former life ... I have fallen into trouble and cannot go on
living here.

I have a friend in the East country. Perhaps he would help me. I will
take my wife and child and go at once to the ends of the East.

(*He travels to the East, singing as he goes a song about the places
through which he passes*.)

We are come to the Inn. (*Knocks at the door*.) We are travellers. Pray
give us shelter.

INNKEEPER.

Lodging, do you say? Come in with me. This way. Tell me, where have you
come from?

TRAVELLER.

I come from the Capital, and I am going down to the East to visit my
friend.

INNKEEPER.

Listen. I am sorry. There is something I must tell you privately.
Whoever passes this night at the Inn must go to-morrow to the drawing
<span id="page_197">p. 197</span> of lots at the sacrifice. I am sorry
for it, but you would do best to leave the Inn before dawn. Tell no one
what I have said, and mind you start early.

TRAVELLER.

If we may sleep here now we will gladly start at dawn.

(*They lie down and sleep in the open courtyard. After a while they rise
and start on their journey*.)

Enter the PRIEST.

PRIEST.

Hey! where are you?

Enter the ACOLYTE

ACOLYTE.

Here I am.

PRIEST.

I hear that three travellers stayed at the Inn last night and have left
before dawn. Go after them and stop them.

ACOLYTE.

I listen and obey. Hey, you travellers, go no further!

TRAVELLER.

Is it at us you are shouting?

ACOLYTE.

Yes, indeed it is at you.

TRAVELLER.

And why should we stop? Tell me the reason.

ACOLYTE.

He is right. It is not to be wondered at that he should ask the reason.
(*To the* TRAVELLER.) Listen. Each year at this place there is a
sacrifice at the Pool. To-day is the festival of this holy rite, and we
ask you to join in it.

TRAVELLER.

I understand you. But it is for those that live here, those that were
born children of this Deity, to attend his worship. Must a wanderer go
with you because he chances to lodge here for a night?

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

(*He turns to go*.)

ACOLYTE.

No, No! For all you say, this will not do.

PRIEST.

Stay! Sir, we do not wonder that you should think this strange. But
listen to me. From ancient times till now no traveller has ever lodged
this night of the year at the Inn of Yoshiwara without attending the
sacrifice at the Pool. If you are in a hurry, come quickly to the
sacrifice, and then with a blessing set out again on your journey.

TRAVELLER.

I understand you. But, as I have said, for such rites as these you
should take men born in the place. . . . No, I still do not understand.
Why should a fleeting traveller be summoned to this Pool-Sacrifice?

PRIEST.

It is a Great Custom.

TRAVELLER.

That may be. I do not question that that is your rule. But I beg you,
consider my case and excuse me.

PRIEST.

Would you be the first to break a Great Custom that has been observed
since ancient times?

TRAVELLER.

No, that is not what I meant. But if we are to discuss this matter, I
must be plain with you. . . . I am a man of the Capital. Perhaps because
of some ill deed done in a former life I have suffered many troubles. At
last I could no longer build the pathway of my life, so I took my wife
and child and set out to seek my friend who lives in the East. Pray let
me go on my way.

PRIEST.

Indeed, indeed you have cause for distress. But from ancient times till
now  
    Parents have been taken <span id="page_199">p. 199</span>  
    And countless beyond all knowing  
    Wives and husbands parted.  
Call this, if you will, the retribution of a former life. But now come
with us quickly to the shores of the Holy Pool.

(*Describing his own actions*.)

So saying, the Priest and acolytes went forward.

WIFE and DAUGHTER.

And the wife and child, crying "Oh what shall we do?" clutched at the
father's sleeve.

TRAVELLER.

But the father could find no words to speak. He stood baffled, helpless.
. . .

PRIEST.

They must not loiter. Divide them and drive them on!

ACOLYTE.

So he drove them before him and they walked like . . .

TRAVELLER.

If true comparison were made . . .

CHORUS.

Like guilty souls of the Dead  
Driven to Judgment  
By fiends reproachful;  
Whose hearts unknowing  
Like dew in day-time  
To nothing dwindle.  
Like sheep to shambles  
They walk weeping,  
No step without a tear  
Till to the Pool they come.

PRIEST.

Now we are come to the Pool, and by its edge are ranged the Priest, the
acolytes, the virgins and dancing-boys.

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

CHORUS.

There is one doom-lot;  
Yet those that are thinking  
"Will it be mine?"  
They are a hundred,  
And many times a hundred.

PRIEST.

Embracing, clasping hands . . .

CHORUS.

Pale-faced

PRIEST.

Sinking at heart

CHORUS.

"On whom will it fall?"  
Not knowing, thick as snow,  
White snow of winter fall their prayers  
To their clan-gods, "Protect us"  
Palm pressed to palm.

PRIEST.

At last the Priest mounted the daïs, raised the lid of the box and
counted the lots to see that there was one for each to take.

CHORUS.

Then all the people came forward  
To draw their lots.  
And each when he unfolded his lot  
And found it was not the First,  
How glad he was!  
But the traveller's daughter,  
Knowing her fate,  
Fell weeping to the earth.

PRIEST.

Are there not three travellers? They have only drawn two lots. The First
Lot is still undrawn. Tell them that one of them must draw it.

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

ACOLYTE.

I listen and obey. Ho, you travellers, it is to you I am speaking. There
are three of you, and you have only drawn two lots. The Priest says one
of you must draw the First Lot.

TRAVELLER.

We have all drawn.

ACOLYTE.

No, I am sure the young girl has not drawn her lot. Look, here it is.
Yes, and it is the Doom-lot!

WIFE.

The First Lot! How terrible!

Hoping to rear you to womanhood, we wandered blindly from the City and
came down to the unknown country of the East. For your sake we set our
hearts on this sad journey. If you are taken, what will become of us?
How hideous!

DAUGHTER.

Do not sob so! If you or my father had drawn this lot, what should I
have done? But now it has fallen to me, and it is hard for you to let me
go.

TRAVELLER.

What brave words! "If you or my father had drawn this lot . . ." There
is great piety in that saying. (*To his* WIFE.) Come, do not sob so
before all these people. We are both parents and must have like
feelings. But from the time I set out to this holy lottery something
told me that of the three of us one would be taken. Look! I am not
crying.

WIFE.

I thought as you did, yet . . .

It is too much! Can it all be real?

TRAVELLER.

The father said "I will not show weakness," yet while he was
[speaking](errata.htm#3.md) bravely  
Because she was his dear daughter  
His secret tears  
Could not be checked.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

WIFE.

Is this a dream or is it real?

(*She clings to the daughter, wailing*.)

PRIEST.

Because the time had come  
The Priest and his men  
Stood waiting on the shore

CHORUS.

They decked the boat with ribands  
And upon a bed of water-herbs  
They laid the maiden of the Pool.

PRIEST.

The priest pulled the ribands  
And spoke the words of prayer.

\[In the second part of the play the dragon of the Pool is appeased and
the girl restored to life.\]
