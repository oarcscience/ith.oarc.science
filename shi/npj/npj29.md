### THE HŌKA PRIESTS

### (HŌKAZŌ)

By ZENCHIKU UJINOBU (1414-1499)

PERSONS

MAKINO.  
NOBUTOSHI (their father's murderer).  
HIS BROTHER.  
NOBUTOSHI'S SERVANT.

MAKINO.

My name is Kojirō; I am the son of one Makino no Sayemon who lived in
the land of Shimotsuke. You must know that my father had a quarrel with
Nobutoshi, a man of Sagami, and was done to death by him. So this man
was my father's murderer and I ought to kill him. But he has many bold
fellows to stand by him, while I am all alone. So the days and months
slip by with nothing done.  
A brother indeed I have, but he left home when he was a child, made
himself into a priest, and lives at the seminary near by.

I am much puzzled how to act. I think I will go across and speak to my
brother of this matter. (*He goes to the curtain at the end of the
hashigakari*.) May I come in?

(*The curtain is raised and the* BROTHER *appears*.)

BROTHER.

Who is it?

MAKINO.

It is I.

BROTHER.

Come in, brother. What has brought you hither?

MAKINO.

I will tell you. It is this matter of our father's murder that has
brought me. I have been thinking that I ought to kill his enemy, and
would have done so but he has many bold fellows to stand by him <span
id="page_166">p. 166</span> and I am all alone. So the days and months
slip by and nothing is done.

For pity's sake, decide with me what course we must pursue.

BROTHER.

Brother, what you have said is true enough. But have you forgotten that
I left my home when I was but a child and made myself a priest? Since
that is so, I cannot help you.

MAKINO.

So you are pleased to think; but men say he is a bad son who does not
kill his father's foe.

BROTHER.

Can you tell me of any that have ministered to piety by slaying a
parent's foe?

MAKINO.

Why, yes. It was in China, I think. There was one whose mother had been
taken by a savage tiger. "I will take vengeance," he cried, and for a
hundred days he lay ambushed in the fields waiting for the tiger to
come. And once when he was walking on the hillside at dusk, he thought
he saw his enemy, and having an arrow already on his bow-string, he shot
with all his might. It was nothing but a great rock that he had seen,
shaped like a tiger. But his arrow stuck so deep in the stone that blood
gushed out from it. If then the strength of piety is such that it can
drive an arrow deep into the heart of a stone, take thought, I beseech
you, whether you will not resolve to come with me.

BROTHER.

You have cited me a notable instance. I am persuaded to resolve with you
how this thing may be effected.

Come now, by what strategy may we get access to our foe?

MAKINO.

A plan has suddenly come into my head. You know that these *hōka* plays
are become the fashion of the day. Why should not I dress up as a *hōka*
and you as a *hōka* priest? They say that our man is a great lover of
the Zen doctrine; so you may talk to him of Zen.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

BROTHER.

That is indeed a pretty notion; let me lose no time in effecting it.  
I am resolved; in a pilgrim guise  
I mask my limbs.

MAKINO.

And I, glad-thoughted,  
In a minstrel's garb go forth.

BROTHER.

Secretly

MAKINO.

We steal from a home

CHORUS.

"Where fain we would stay, but now  
Long as life lasts,  
Life fickle as the moon of dawn,  
No refuge know we  
But the haven of our intent.

(*The* BROTHERS *leave the stage. Enter their enemy* NOBUTOSHI*,
followed by his Servant*.)

NOBUTOSHI.

   To the home of gods my footsteps turn  
   To the Sacred Fence that bars  
   No suppliant's desire.  
I am called Tone no Nobutoshi. My home is in the land of Sagami. Because
for much time past I have been troubled with evil dreams, I have
resolved to visit the Three Isles of Seto.

(*Re-enter the Brothers:* MAKINO *with bow and arrow in his hand and
bamboo sprigs stuck in his belt behind; the* BROTHER *carrying a long
staff to which a round fan is attached*.)

BROTHER.

A fine sight are we now!  
From priest and laic way alike removed,  
Scarce men in speech or form!

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

MAKINO.

This antic garb shall hide us from the World  
More safe than hermit cell;  
All earthly thoughts shut out here might we bide  
Cloistered in ease. Oh why,  
Why back to the bitter World  
Are we borne by our intent?

MAKINO and BROTHER.

The flower that has fallen dreams that Spring is done,  
There are white clouds to cover  
The green hillside . . .

MAKINO.

To match the scarlet  
Of the autumn leaves  
Red sunlight glitters  
On the flowing stream.

CHORUS.

Wind at morning, rain at night;  
To-day and to-morrow  
Shall be part of long ago.  
We who pass through a world  
Changeful as the dews of evening,  
Uncertain as the skies of Spring,  
We that are as foam upon the stream,--  
Can *any* be our foe?

SERVANT (*seeing them and going towards the hashigakari*).

You're a merry pair of guys! What may your names be?

BROTHER.

Floating Cloud; Running Water.

SERVANT.

And what is your friend's name?

MAKINO.

Floating Cloud; Running Water.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

SERVANT.

Have you then but one name between you?

BROTHER.

I am Floating Cloud and he is Running Water. And now, pray, tell us your
master's name.

SERVANT.

Why, he comes from the land of Sagami, and Nobutoshi . . . (*here the*
SERVANT *suddenly remembers that he is being indiscreet and stuffs his
hand into his mouth*) . . . is not his name.

BROTHER.

That's no matter. Whoever he is, tell him that we are only two *hōka*
come to speak with him.

SERVANT.

I will tell him. Do you wait here.

(*He goes over to* NOBUTOSHI *and whispers with him, then comes back to
the* BROTHERS.)

Come this way.

(NOBUTOSHI *comes to meet them, covering his face with a fan*.)

NOBUTOSHI.

Listen, gentlemen, I desire an explanation from you.

BROTHER.

What would you know?

NOBUTOSHI.

It is this. They alone can be called priests round whose fingers is
twisted the rosary of Tenfold Power, who are clad in cloak of
Forbearance, round whose shoulders hangs the stole of Penitence. Such is
everywhere the garb of Buddha's priests, I know no other habit. But you,
I see, carry a round fan tied to your pillar-staff. By what verse do you
justify the wearing of a fan?

BROTHER.

  "In motion, a wind;  
  In stillness, a bright moon."  
And even as in this one substance <span id="page_170">p. 170</span>  
Both wind and moon inhere,  
So Thought alone is Truth, and from the mind  
Spring all component things.  
Such is the sermon of the fan, as a sign we bear it  
Of the heart's omnipotence. It is an emblem  
Fools only would decry!

NOBUTOSHI.

The fan indeed teaches an agreeable lesson; but one of you carries a bow
and arrow at his side. Are these too reckoned fit gear for men of your
profession?

MAKINO.

The bow? Why, surely!  
Are not its two horns fashioned  
In likeness of the Hare and Crow,  
Symbols of the Moon and Sun, of Night and Day?  
Here is the primal mystery displayed  
Of fair and foul conjoined. <span id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_160)  
Bears not the God of Love, unsullied king,  
A magical bow? Does he not stretch upon its string  
Arrows of grace whereby  
The armies of the Four Fiends <span id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_161) know
no rest

CHORUS.

And thus we two are armed,  
For though the bow be not bent nor the arrow loosed,  
Yet falls the prey unmasked.

(MAKINO *draws his bow as though about to shoot; his* BROTHER *checks
him with his staff*.)

So says the song. Now speak no more  
Of things you know not of.

NOBUTOSHI.

Tell me, pray, from which patriarch do the hōka priests derive their
doctrine? To what sect do you adhere?

BROTHER.

We are of no sect; our doctrine stands apart. It cannot be spoken <span
id="page_171">p. 171</span> nor expounded. To frame it in sentences is
to degrade our faith; to set it down in writing is to be untrue to our
Order; but by the bending of a leaf is the wind's journey known.

NOBUTOSHI.

I thank you; your exposition delights me. Pray tell me now, what is the
meaning of this word "Zen"?

MAKINO.

Within, to sound to their depths the waters of Mystery;  
Without, to wander at will through the portals of Concentration.

NOBUTOSHI.

And of the doctrine that Buddha is in the bones of each one of us . . .?

BROTHER.

He lurks unseen; like the golden dragon <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_162) when he leaps behind the clouds.

NOBUTOSHI.

If we believe that life and death are real . . .

BROTHER.

Then are we caught in the wheel of sorrow.

NOBUTOSHI.

But if we deny them . . .

BROTHER.

We are listed to a heresy. <span id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_163)

NOBUTOSHI.

And the straight path to knowledge . . .

MAKINO (*rushing forward sword in hand*).

"With the triple stroke is carved." <span
id="fr_166"></span>[3](#fn_164)

 

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

Hold! (*turning to* NOBUTOSHI *who has recoiled and drawn his sword*.)

"To carve a way to knowledge by the triple stroke" . . . .  
These are Zen words; he was but quoting a text.  
This perturbation does little honour to your wits.

CHORUS.

Thus do men ever  
Blurt out or blazen on the cheek  
Red as rock-rose <span id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_165) the thing they
would not speak.  
Now by the Trinity, how foolish are men's hearts!

SERVANT (*aside*).

While my masters are fooling, I'll to my folly too.

(*He slips out by the side door*.)

BROTHER (*embarking upon a religious discourse in order to allay*
NOBUTOSHI'S *suspicions*).

It matters not whether faith and words be great or small,  
Whether the law be kept or broken.

CHORUS.

Neither in the "Yea" nor "Nay" is the Truth found;  
There is none but may be saved at last.

BROTHER.

Not man alone; the woods and fields  
Show happy striving.

CHORUS.

The willow in his green, the peony  
In crimson dressed.

(*The* BROTHER *here begins his first dance; like that which follows, it
is a "shimai," or dance without instrumental music*.)

On mornings of green spring  
When at the valley's shining gate  
First melt the hawthorn-warbler's frozen tears,  
Or when by singing foam  
Of snow-fed waters echoes the discourse  
Of neighbourly frogs;--then speaks <span id="page_173">p. 173</span>  
The voice of Buddha's heart.  
Autumn, by eyes unseen,  
Is heard in the wind's anger; the clamorous descent  
And the clash of river-reeds,  
Of wild-geese searching  
The home-field's face,  
Clouds shaped like leaves of rice,--all these  
To watchful eyes foretell the evening storm.  
He who has seen upon a mountain-side  
Stock-still beneath the moon  
The young deer stand in longing for his mate,  
That man may read the writing, and forget  
The finger on the page.

BROTHER.

Even so the fisher's boats that ride  
The harbour of the creek,

CHORUS.

Bring back the fish, but leave the net behind.  
These things you have heard and seen;  
In the wind of the hill-top, in the valley's song,  
In the film of night, in the mist of morning  
Is it proclaimed that Thought alone  
Was, is and Shall be.

BROTHER.

Conceive this truth and wake!  
As a cloud that hides the moon, so Matter veils

CHORUS.

The face of Thought.

BROTHER (*begins his second dance, while the* CHORUS *sings the ballad
used by the "hōka" players*).

Oh, a pleasant place is the City of Flowers;

CHORUS.

No pen could write its wonders. <span id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_166)
<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>  
In the east, Gion and the Temple of Clear Waters  
Where torrents tumble with a noise of many wings;  
In the storm-wind flutter, flutter  
The blossoms of the Earth-lord's tree. <span
id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_167)  
In the west, the Temple of the Wheel of Law,  
The Shrine of Saga (Turn, if thou wilt,  
Wheel of the Water Mill!),  
Where river-waves dance on the weir  
And river-willows by the waves are chafed;  
     Oxen of the City by the wheels are chafed;  
     And the tea-mortar by the pestle is chafed.  
     Why, and I'd forgot! In the *hōka's* hands  
     The *kokiriko* <span id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_168) is chafed.  
     Now long may our Lord rule  
     Age notched on age, like the notches  
     Of these gnarled sticks!

MAKINO and BROTHER.

Enough! Why longer hide our plot?

(*They draw their swords and rush upon NOBUTOSHI, who places his hat
upon the ground and slips out at the side-door. The hat henceforward
symbolically represents NOBUTOSHI, an actual representation of slaughter
being thus avoided*.)

CHORUS.

Then the brothers drew their swords and rushed upon him,  
The foe of their desire.

(MAKINO *gets behind the hat, to signify that* NOBUTOSHI *is
surrounded*.)

They have scaled the summit of their hate,  
The rancour of many months and years.  
The way is open to the bourne of their intent.

(*They strike*.)

They have laid their enemy low.  
So when the hour was come  
Did these two brothers <span id="page_175">p. 175</span>  
By sudden resolution  
Destroy their father's foe.  
For valour and piety are their names remembered  
Even in this aftertime.
