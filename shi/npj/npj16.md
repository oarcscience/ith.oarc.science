### KAGEKIYO

By SEAMI

PERSONS

A GIRL (Kagekiyo's daughter).  
HER ATTENDANT.  
KAGEKIYO THE PASSIONATE.  
A VILLAGER.  
CHORUS.

GIRL and ATTENDANT.

Late dewdrops are our lives that only wait  
Till the wind blows, the wind of morning blows.

GIRL.

I am Hitomaru. I live in the valley of Kamegaye. My father Kagekiyo the
Passionate fought for the House of Hei <span
id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_66.md), and for this was hated by the
Genji. <span id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_67.md) I am told they have banished
him to Miyazaki in the country of Hyūga, and there in changed estate he
passes the months and years. I must not be downcast at the toil of the
journey; <span id="fr_70"></span>[3](#fn_68.md) for hardship is the lot of
all that travel on unfamiliar roads, and I must bear it for my father's
sake.

GIRL and ATTENDANT.

Oh double-wet our sleeves  
With the tears of troubled dreaming and the dews  
That wet our grassy bed.  
We leave Sagami; who shall point the way  
To Tōtōmi, far off not only in name? <span
id="fr_71"></span>[4](#fn_69.md)  
Over the sea we row: <span id="page_90">p. 90</span>  
And now the eight-fold Spider Bridge we cross  
To Mikawa. How long, O City of the Clouds, <span
id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_70.md)  
Shall we, inured to travel, see you in our dreams?

ATTENDANT.

We have journeyed so fast that I think we must already have come to
Miyazaki in the country of Hyūga. It is here you should ask for your
father.

(*The voice of* KAGEKIYO *is heard from within his hut*.)

KAGEKIYO.

Behind this gate,  
This pine-wood barricade shut in alone  
I waste the hours and days;  
By me not numbered, since my eyes no longer  
See the clear light of heaven, but in darkness,  
Unending darkness, profitlessly sleep  
In this low room.  
For garment given but one coat to cover  
From winter winds or summer's fire  
This ruin, this anatomy!

CHORUS (*speaking for* KAGEKIYO).

Oh better had I left the world, to wear  
The black-stained sleeve.  
Who will now pity me, whose withered frame  
Even to myself is hateful?  
Or who shall make a care to search for me  
And carry consolation to my woes?

GIRL.

How strange! That hut is so old, I cannot think that any one can live
there. Yet I heard a voice speaking within. Perhaps some beggar lodges
there; I will not go nearer. (*She steps back*.)

KAGEKIYO.

Though my eyes see not autumn  
Yet has the wind brought tiding

 

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

GIRL.

Of one who wanders  
By ways unknown bewildered,  
Finding rest nowhere

KAGEKIYO.

For in the Three Worlds of Being  
Nowhere is rest, <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) but only  
In the Void Eternal.  
None is, and none can answer  
Where to thy asking.

ATTENDANT (*going up to* KAGEKIYO'S *hut*).

I have come to your cottage to ask you something.

KAGEKIYO.

What is it you want?

ATTENDANT.

Can you tell me where the exile lives?

KAGEKIYO.

The exile? What exile do you mean? Tell me his name.

ATTENDANT.

We are [looking](errata.htm#0.md) for Kagekiyo the Passionate who fought
for the Taira.

KAGEKIYO.

I have heard of him indeed. But I am blind, and have not seen him. I
have heard such sad tales of his plight that I needs must pity him.

Go further; ask elsewhere.

ATTENDANT (*to* GIRL, *who has been waiting*).

It does not seem that we shall find him here. Let us go further and ask
again. (*They pass on*.)

 

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

KAGEKIYO.

Who can it be that is asking for me? What if it should be the child of
this blind man? For long ago when I was at Atsuta in Owari I courted a
woman and had a child by her. But since the child was a girl, I thought
I would get no good of her and left her with the head. man of the valley
of Kamegaye. But she was not content to stay with her foster-parents and
has come all this way to meet her true father.

CHORUS.

To hear a voice,  
To hear and not to see!  
Oh pity of blind eyes!  
I have let her pass by;  
I have not told my name;  
But it was love that bound me,  
Love's rope that held me.

ATTENDANT (*calling into the side-bridge*).

Hie! Is there any villager about?

VILLAGER (*raising the curtain that divides the side-bridge from the
stage*).

What do you want with me?

ATTENDANT.

Do you know where the exile lives?

VILLAGER.

The exile? What exile is it you are asking for?

ATTENDANT.

One called Kagekiyo the Passionate who fought for the Taira.

VILLAGER.

Did you not see some one in a thatched but under the hillside as you
came along?

ATTENDANT.

Why, we saw a blind beggar in a thatched hut.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

VILLAGER.

That blind beggar is your man. *He* is Kagekiyo.

(*The* GIRL *starts and trembles*.)

But why does your lady tremble when I tell you that he is Kagekiyo? What
is amiss with her?

ATTENDANT.

No wonder that you ask. I will tell you at once; this lady is Kagekiyo's
daughter. She has borne the toil of this journey because she longed to
meet her father face to face. Please take her to him.

VILLAGER.

She is Kagekiyo's daughter? How strange, how strange! But, lady, calm
yourself and listen.

Kagekiyo went blind in both his eyes, and finding himself helpless,
shaved his head and called himself the beggar of Hyūga. He begs a little
from travellers; and we villagers are sorry for him and see to it that
he does not starve. Perhaps he would not tell you his name because he
was ashamed of what he has become. But if you will come with me I will
shout "Kagekiyo" at him. He will surely answer to his own name. Then you
shall go to him and talk of what you will, old times or now. Please come
this way.

(*They go towards the hut*.)

Hie, Kagekiyo, Kagekiyo! Are you there, Kagekiyo the Passionate?

KAGEKIYO (*stopping his ears with his hands, irritably*).

Noise, noise!

Silence! I was vexed already. For a while ago there came travellers from
my home! Do you think I let them stay? No, no. I could not show them my
loathsomeness. . . . It was hard to let them go,--not tell them my name!

A thousand rivers of tears soften my sleeve!  
A thousand, thousand things I do in dream  
And wake to idleness! Oh I am resolved  
To be in the world as one who is not in the world.  
Let them shout "Kagekiyo, Kagekiyo":  
Need beggars answer?  
Moreover, in this land I have a name.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

CHORUS.

"In Hyūga sunward-facing  
A fit name found I.  
Oh call me not by the name  
Of old days that have dropped  
Like the Low from a stricken hand!  
For 1 whom passion  
Had left for ever  
At the sound of that wrathful name  
Am angry, angry."

(*While the* CHORUS *speaks his thought* KAGEKIYO *mimes their words,
waving his stick and finally beating it against his thigh in a crescendo
of rage*.)

KAGEKIYO (*suddenly lowering his voice, gently*).

But while I dwell here

CHORUS.

"But while I dwell here  
To those that tend me  
Should I grow hateful.  
Then were I truly  
A blind man staffless.  
Oh forgive  
Profitless anger, tongue untended,  
A cripple's spleen."

KAGEKIYO.

For though my eyes be darkened

CHORUS.

"Though my eyes be darkened  
Yet, no word spoken,  
Men's thoughts I see.  
Listen now to the wind  
In the woods upon the hill:  
Snow is coming, snow!  
Oh bitterness to wake  
From dreams of flowers unseen!  
And on the shore,  
Listen, the waves are lapping <span id="page_95">p. 95</span>  
over rough stones to the cliff.  
The evening tide is in.

(KAGEKIYO *fumbles for his staff and rises, coming just outside the hut.
The mention of "waves," "shore," "tide," has reminded him of the great
shore-battle at Yashima in which the Tairas triumphed*.)

"I was one of them, of those Tairas. If you will listen, I will tell you
the tale . . ."

KAGEKIYO (*to the* VILLAGER).

There was a weight on my mind when I spoke to you so harshly. Pray
forgive me.

VILLAGER.

No, no! you are always so! I do not heed you. But tell me, did not some
one come before, asking for Kagekiyo?

KAGEKIYO.

No,--you are the only one who has asked.

VILLAGER.

It is not true. Some one came here saying that she was Kagekiyo's
daughter. Why did you not tell her? I was sorry for her and have brought
her back with me.

(To the GIRL.)

Come now, speak with your father.

GIRL (*going to* KAGEKIYO'S *side and touching his sleeve*).

It is I who have come to you.  
I have come all the long way,  
Through rain, wind, frost and dew.  
And now--you have not understood; it was all for nothing.  
Am I not worth your love? Oh cruel, cruel! (*She weeps*.)

KAGEKIYO.

All that till now I thought to have concealed  
Is known; where can I hide,  
I that have no more refuge than the dew  
That finds no leaf to lie on?  
Should you, oh flower delicately tended,<span id="page_96">p.
96</span>  
Call me your father, then would the World know you  
A beggar's daughter. Oh think not ill of me  
That I did let you pass!

(*He gropes falteringly with his right hand and touches her sleeve*.)

CHORUS.

Oh sad, sad!  
He that of old gave welcome  
To casual strangers and would raise an angry voice  
If any passed his door,  
Now from his own child gladly  
Would hide his wretchedness.  
He that once  
Among all that in the warships of Taira  
Shoulder to shoulder, knee locked with knee,  
Dwelt crowded--  
Even Kagekiyo keen  
As the clear moonlight--  
Was ever called on to captain  
The Royal Pinnace.  
And though among his men  
Many were brave and many of wise counsel,  
Yet was he even as the helm of the boat.  
And of the many who served him  
None cavilled, disputed.  
But now  
He that of all was envied  
Is like Kirin <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_72.md) grown old,  
By every jade outrun.

VILLAGER (*seeing the* GIRL *standing sadly apart*).

Poor child, come back again.

(*She comes back to her father's side*.)

Listen, Kagekiyo, there is something your daughter wants of you.

KAGEKIYO.

What is it she wants?

 

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

VILLAGER.

She tells me that she longs to bear the story of your high deeds at
Yashima. Could you not tell us the tale?

KAGEKIYO.

That is a strange thing for a girl to ask. Yet since kind love brought
her this long, long way to visit me, I cannot but tell her the tale.
Promise me that when it is finished you will send her back again to her
home.

VILLAGER.

I will. So soon as your tale is finished, I will send her home.

KAGEKIYO.

It was in the third year of Juyei, <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_73.md)  
At the close of the third month.  
We of Heike were in our ships,  
The men of Genji on shore.  
Two armies spread along the coast  
Eager to bid in battle  
For final mastery.  
Then said Noritsune, Lord of Noto,  
"Last year at Muro Hill in the land of Harima,  
At Water Island, even at Jackdaw Pass,  
We were beaten again and again; outwitted  
By Yoshitsune's strategy.  
Oh that some plan might be found, some counsel given  
For the slaying of Kurō." <span id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_74.md) So spoke
he.  
Then thought Kagekiyo in his heart,  
"Though he be called 'Judge,'  
Yet is he no god or demon, this Yoshitsune.  
An easy task! Oh easy for one that loves not  
His own life chiefly!  
So he took leave of Noritsune  
And landed upon the beach.  
The soldiers of Genji  
"Death to him, death to him!" cried  
As they swept towards him.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

CHORUS.

And when he saw them,  
"What great to-do!" he cried, then waving  
His sword in the evening sunlight  
He fell upon them swiftly.  
They fled before his sword-point,  
They could not withstand him, those soldiers;  
This way, that way, they scuttled wildly, and he cried,  
"They shall not escape me!"

KAGEKIYO (*breaking in excitedly*).

Cowards, cowards all of you!

CHORUS.

Cowards, all of you!  
Sight shameful alike for Gen and Hei.  
Then, thinking that to stop one man  
Could not but be easy,  
Sword under arm,  
"I am Kagekiyo," he cried,  
"Kagekiyo the Passionate, a captain of the soldiers of Hei."  
And swiftly pursued, with naked hand to grasp  
The helm that Mionoya wore.  
He clutched at the neck-piece,  
Twice and again he clutched, but it slipped from him, slid through his
fingers.  
Then crying "He shall not escape me, this foe I have chosen,"  
Swooped like a bird, seized upon the helmet,  
"Eya, eya," he cried, tugging,  
Till "Crack"--the neck-piece tore from the helm and was left in his
hand,  
While the master of it, suddenly free, ran till he was come  
A good way off, then turning,  
"O mighty Kagekiyo, how terrible the strength of your arm!"  
And the other called back to him, "Nay, say rather 'How strong the
shaft  
Of Mionoya's neck!"' So laughed they across the battle,  
And went off each his way.

(KAGEKIYO, *who has been miming the battle, breaks off abruptly and
turns to the* VILLAGER. *The* CHORUS *speaks for him*.)

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

CHORUS.

"I am old: I have forgotten--things unforgettable!  
My thoughts are tangled: I am ashamed.  
But little longer shall this world,  
This sorrowful world torment me.  
The end is near: go to your home;  
Pray for my soul departed, child, candle to my darkness,  
Bridge to salvation!

(*He rises to his feet groping with his stick, comes to the GIRL, and
gently pushes her before him towards the wing*.)

"I stay," he said; and she "I go."  
The sound of this word  
Was all he kept of her,  
Nor passed between them  
Remembrance other.
