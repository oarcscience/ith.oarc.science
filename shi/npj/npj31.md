### HAGOROMO

By SEAMI

PERSONS

HAKURYŌ (a Fisherman).  
ANOTHER FISHERMAN.  
ANGEL.  
CHORUS.

FISHERMAN.

Loud the rowers' cry  
Who through the storm-swept paths of Mio Bay  
Ride to the rising sea.

HAKURYŌ.

I am Hakuryō, a fisherman whose home is by the pine-woods of Mio.

BOTH.

"On a thousand leagues of lovely hill clouds suddenly close;  
But by one tower the bright moon shines in a clear sky." <span
id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_169.md)  
A pleasant season, truly: on the pine-wood shore  
The countenance of Spring;  
Early mist close-clasped to the swell of the sea;  
In the plains of the sky a dim, loitering moon.  
Sweet sight, to gaze enticing  
Eyes even of us earth-cumbered  
Low souls, least for attaining  
Of high beauty nurtured.  
Oh unforgettable! By mountain paths  
Down to the sea of Kiyomi I come  
And on far woodlands look,  
Pine-woods of Mio, thither  
Come, thither guide we our course.  
Fishers, why put you back your boats to shore,  
No fishing done?<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>  
Thought you them rising waves, those billowy clouds  
Wind-blown across sea?  
Wait, for the time is Spring and in the trees  
The early wind his everlasting song  
Sings low; and in the bay  
Silent in morning calm the little ships,  
Ships of a thousand fishers, ride the sea.

(*The second* FISHERMAN *retires to a position near the leader of the*
CHORUS *and takes no further part in the action*.)

HAKURYŌ.

Now I have landed at the pine-wood of Mio and am viewing the beauty of
the shore. Suddenly there is music in the sky, a rain of flowers,
unearthly fragrance wafted on all sides. These are no common things; nor
is this beautiful cloak that hangs upon the pine-tree. I come near to
it. It is marvellous in form and fragrance. This surely is no common
dress. I will take it back with me and show it to the people of my home.
It shall be a treasure in my house.

(*He walks four steps towards the Waki's pillar carrying the feather
robe*.)

ANGEL (*entering through the curtain at the end of the gallery*).

Stop! That cloak is mine. Where are you going with it?

HAKURYŌ.

This is a cloak I found here. I am taking it home.

ANGEL.

It is an-angel's robe of feathers, a cloak no mortal man may wear. Put
it back where you found it.

HAKURYŌ.

How? Is the owner of this cloak an angel of the sky? Why, then, I will
put it in safe keeping. It shall be a treasure in the land, a marvel to
men unborn. <span id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_170.md) I will not give back
your cloak.

ANGEL.

Oh pitiful! How shall I cloakless tread  
The wing-ways of the air, how climb <span id="page_180 ">p. 180</span>  
The sky, my home?  
Oh, give it back, in charity give it back.

HAKURYŌ.

No charity is in me, and your moan  
Makes my heart resolute.  
Look, I take your robe, hide it, and will not give it back.

(*Describing his own actions. Then he walks away*.)

ANGEL.

Like a bird without wings,  
I would rise, but robeless

HAKURYŌ.

To the low earth you sink, an angel dwelling  
In the dingy world.

ANGEL.

This way, that way.  
Despair only.

HAKURYŌ.

But when she saw he was resolved to keep it

ANGEL.

Strength failing.

HAKURYŌ.

Help none ...

CHORUS.

Then on her coronet,  
Jewelled as with the dew of tears,  
The bright flowers drooped and faded. <span
id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_171.md)  
O piteous to see before the eyes,  
Fivefold the signs of sickness  
Corrupt an angel's form.

ANGEL.

I look into the plains of heaven,<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>  
The cloud-ways are hid in mist, The path is lost.

CHORUS.

Oh, enviable clouds,  
At your will wandering  
For ever idle in the empty sky  
That was my home!  
Now fades and fades upon my ear  
The voice of Kalavink, <span id="fr_174"></span>[1](#fn_172.md)  
Daily accustomed song.  
And you, oh you I envy,  
Wild-geese clamorous  
Down the sky-paths returning;  
And you, O seaward circling, shoreward sweeping  
Swift seagulls of the bay:  
Even the wind, because in heaven it blows,  
The wind of Spring I envy.

HAKURYŌ.

Listen. Now that I have seen you in your sorrow, I yield and would give
you back your mantle.

ANGEL.

Oh, I am happy! Give it me then!

HAKURYŌ.

Wait. I have heard tell of the dances that are danced in heaven.  
Dance for me now, and I will give back your robe.

ANGEL.

I am happy, happy. Now I shall have wings and mount the sky again.  
And for thanksgiving I bequeath  
A dance of remembrance to the world,  
Fit for the princes of men:  
The dance-tune that makes to turn  
The towers of the moon,  
I will dance it here and as an heirloom leave it  
To the sorrowful men of the world. <span id="page_182">p. 182</span>  
Give back my mantle, I cannot dance without it.  
Say what you will, I must first have back the robe.

HAKURYŌ.

Not yet, for if I give back your robe, not a step would you dance, but
fly with it straight to the sky.

ANGEL.

No, no. Doubt is for mortals;  
In heaven is no deceit.

HAKURYŌ.

I am ashamed. Look, I give back the robe.

(*He gives it to her and she takes it in both hands*.)

ANGEL.

The heavenly lady puts on her garment,  
She dances the dance of the Rainbow Skirt, of the Robe of Feathers.

HAKURYŌ.

The sky-robe flutters; it yields to the wind.

ANGEL.

Sleeve like a flower wet with rain . . .

HAKURYŌ.

The first dance is over.

ANGEL.

Shall I dance?

CHORUS.

The dance of Suruga, with music of the East?  
Thus was it first danced.

(*The* ANGEL *dances, while the* CHORUS *sings the words of the dance,
an ancient Shintō chant*.)

"Why name we  
Wide-stretched and everlasting.  
The sky of heaven?  
Two gods <span id="fr_175"></span>[1](#fn_173.md) there came of old <span
id="page_183">p. 183</span>  
And built, upon ten sides shut in,  
A measured world for men;  
But without limit arched they  
The sky above, and named it  
Wide-stretched and everlasting."

ANGEL.

Thus is the Moon-God's palace:  
Its walls are fashioned  
With an axe of jade.

CHORUS.

In white dress, black dress,  
Thrice ten angels  
In two ranks divided,  
Thrice five for the waning,  
Thrice five for nights of the waxing moon,  
One heavenly lady on each night of the moon  
Does service and fulfils  
Her ritual task assigned.

ANGEL.

I too am of their number,  
A moon-lady of heaven.

CHORUS.

"Mine is the fruit of the moon-tree, <span
id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_174.md) yet came I to the East incarnate, <span
id="fr_177"></span>[2](#fn_175.md)  
Dwelt with the people of Earth, and gave them  
A gift of music, song-dance of Suruga.

Now upon earth trail the long mists of Spring;  
Who knows but in the valleys of the moon  
The heavenly moon-tree puts her blossom on?  
The blossoms of her crown win back their glory:  
It is the sign of Spring.  
Not heaven is here, but beauty of the wind and sky.  
Blow, blow, you wind, and build  
Cloud-walls across the sky, lest the vision leave us  
Of a maid divine!  
This tint of springtime in the woods, <span id="page_184">p.
184</span>  
This colour on the headland,  
Snow on the mountain, <span id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_176.md)  
Moonlight on the clear shore,--  
Which fairest? Nay, each peerless  
At the dawn of a Spring day.  
Waves lapping, wind in the pine-trees whispering  
Along the quiet shore. Say you, what cause  
Has Heaven to be estranged  
From us Earth-men; are we not children of the Gods,  
Within, without the jewelled temple wall, <span
id="fr_179"></span>[2](#fn_177.md)  
Born where no cloud dares dim the waiting moon,  
Land of Sunrise?"

ANGEL.

May our Lord's life  
Last long as a great rock rubbed  
Only by the rare trailing  
Of an angel's feather-skirt. <span id="fr_180"></span>[3](#fn_178.md)  
Oh, marvellous music!  
The Eastern song joined  
To many instruments;  
Harp, zither, pan-pipes, flute,  
Belly their notes beyond the lonely clouds.  
The sunset stained with crimson light  
From Mount Sumeru's side; <span id="fr_181"></span>[4](#fn_179.md)  
For green, the islands floating on the sea;  
For whiteness whirled  
A snow of blossom blasted  
By the wild winds, a white cloud  
Of sleeves waving.

(*Concluding the dance, she folds her hands and prays*.)

NAMU KIMYO GWATTEN-SHI.  
To thee, O Monarch of the Moon,  
Be glory and praise,  
Thou son of Seishi Omnipotent! <span id="fr_182"></span>[5](#fn_180.md)

 

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

CHORUS.

This is a dance of the East.

(*She dances three of the five parts of the dance called "Yo no Mai,"
the Prelude Dance*.)

ANGEL.

I am robed in sky, in the empty blue of heaven.

CHORUS.

Now she is robed in a garment of mist, of Spring mist.

ANGEL.

Wonderful in perfume and colour, an angel's skirt,--left, right, left,
left, right.

(*Springing from side to side*.)

The skirt swishes, the flowers nod, the feathery sleeves trail out and
return, the dancing-sleeves.

(*She dances "Ha no Mai" the Broken Dance*.)

CHORUS.

She has danced many dances,  
But not yet are they numbered,  
The dances of the East.  
And now she, whose beauty is as the young moon,  
Shines on us in the sky of midnight,  
The fifteenth night,  
With the beam of perfect fulfilment,  
The splendor of Truth.  
The vows <span id="fr_183"></span>[1](#fn_181.md) are fulfilled, and the
land we live in  
Rich with the Seven Treasures  
By this dance rained down on us,  
The gift of Heaven.  
But, as the hours pass by,  
Sky-cloak of feathers fluttering, fluttering,  
Over the pine-woods of Mio,  
Past the Floating Islands, through the feet of the clouds she flies,  
Over the mountain of Ashitaka, the high peak of Fuji,  
Very faint her form,  
Mingled with the mists of heaven;  
Now lost to sight.
