### AYA NO TSUZUMI

(THE DAMASK DRUM)

ATTRIBUTED TO SEAMI, BUT PERHAPS EARLIER.

PERSONS

A COURTIER.  
AN OLD GARDENER.  
THE PRINCESS.

COURTIER.

I am a courtier at the Palace of Kinomaru in the country of Chikuzen.
You must know that in this place there is a famous pond called the
Laurel Pond, where the royal ones often take their walks; so it happened
that one day the old man who sweeps the garden here caught sight of the
Princess. And from that time he has loved her with a love that gives his
heart no rest.

Some one told her of this, and she said, "Love's equal realm knows no
divisions," <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_116.md) and in her pity she
said, "By that pond there stands a laurel-tree, and on its branches
there hangs a drum. Let him beat the drum, and if the sound is heard in
the Palace, he shall see my face again."

I must tell him of this.

Listen, old Gardener! The worshipful lady has heard of your love and
sends you this message: "Go and beat the drum that hangs on the tree by
the pond, and if the sound is heard in the Palace, you shall see my face
again." Go quickly now and beat the drum!

GARDENER.

With trembling I receive her words. I will go and beat the drum.

COURTIER.

Look, here is the drum she spoke of. Make haste and beat it!

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

(*He leaves the* GARDENER *standing by the tree and seats himself at the
foot of the "Waki's pillar*.")

GARDENER.

They talk of the moon-tree, the laurel that grows in the Garden of the
Moon. . . . But for me there is but one true tree, this laurel by the
lake. Oh, may the drum that hangs on its branches give forth a mighty
note, a music to bind up my bursting heart.

Listen! the evening bell to help me chimes;  
But then tolls in  
A heavy tale of day linked on to day,

CHORUS (*speaking for the* GARDENER).

And hope stretched out from dusk to dusk.  
But now, a watchman of the hours, I beat  
The longed-for stroke.

GARDENER.

I was old, I shunned the daylight,  
I was gaunt as an aged crane;  
And upon all that misery  
Suddenly a sorrow was heaped,  
The new sorrow of love.  
The days had left their marks,  
Coming and coming, like waves that beat on a sandy shore . . .

CHORUS.

Oh, with a thunder of white waves  
The echo of the drum shall roll.

GARDENER.

The after-world draws near me,  
Yet even now I wake not  
From this autumn of love that closes  
In sadness the sequence of my years.

CHORUS.

And slow as the autumn dew  
Tears gather in my eyes, to fall  
Scattered like dewdrops from a shaken flower  
On my coarse-woven dress.  
See here the marks, imprint of tangled love,  
That all the world will read.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

GARDENER.

I said "I will forget,"

CHORUS.

And got worse torment so  
Than by remembrance. But all in this world  
Is as the horse of the aged man of the land of Sai; <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_117.md)  
And as a white colt flashes  
Past a gap in the hedge, even so our days pass. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_118.md)  
And though the time be come,  
Yet can none know the road that he at last must tread,  
Goal of his dewdrop-life.  
All this I knew; yet knowing,  
Was blind with folly.

GARDENER.

"Wake, wake," he cries--

CHORUS.

The watchman of the hours--  
"Wake from the sleep of dawn!"  
And batters on the drum.  
For if its sound be heard, soon shall he see  
Her face, the damask of her dress  
Aye, damask! He does not know  
That on a damask drum he beats,  
Beats with all the strength of his hands, his aged hands,  
But bears no sound.  
"Am I grown deaf?" he cries, and listens, listens:  
Rain on the windows, lapping of waves on the pool  
Both these he hears, and silent only  
The drum, strange damask drum.  
Oh, will it never sound?  
I thought to beat the sorrow from my heart,  
Wake music in a damask drum; an echo of love  
From the voiceless fabric of pride!

 

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

GARDENER.

Longed for as the moon that hides  
In the obstinate clouds of a rainy night  
Is the sound of the watchman's drum,  
To roll the darkness from my heart.

CHORUS.

I beat the drum. The days pass and the hours.  
It was yesterday, and it is to-day.

GARDENER.

But she for whom I wait

CHORUS.

Comes not even in dream. At dawn and dusk

GARDENER.

No drum sounds.

CHORUS.

She has not come. Is it not sung that those  
Whom love has joined  
Not even the God of Thunder can divide?  
Of lovers, I alone  
Am guideless, comfortless.  
Then weary of himself and calling her to witness of his woe,  
"Why should I endure," he cried,  
"Such life as this?" and in the waters of the pond  
He cast himself and died.

(GARDENER *leaves the stage*.)

Enter the PRINCESS.

COURTIER.

I would speak with you, madam.

The drum made no sound, and the aged Gardener in despair has flung
himself into the pond by the laurel tree, and died. The soul of .such a
one may cling to you and do you injury. Go out and look upon him

PRINCESS (*speaking wildly, already possessed by the* GARDENER'S *angry
ghost, which speaks through her*). <span id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_119.md)

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

Listen, people, listen!  
In the noise of the beating waves  
I hear the rolling of a drum.  
Oh, joyful sound, oh joyful!  
The music of a drum,

COURTIER.

Strange, strange!  
This lady speaks as one  
By phantasy possessed.  
What is amiss, what ails her?

PRINCESS.

Truly, by phantasy I am possessed.  
Can a damask drum give sound?  
When I bade him beat what could not ring,  
Then tottered first my wits.

COURTIER.

She spoke, and on the face of the evening pool  
A wave stirred.

PRINCESS.

And out of the wave

COURTIER.

A voice spoke.

(*The voice of the* GARDENER *is heard; as he gradually advances along
the hashigakari it is seen that he wears a "demon mask," leans on a
staff and carries the "demon mallet" at his girdle*.)

GARDENER'S GHOST.

I was driftwood in the pool, but the waves of bitterness

CHORUS.

Have washed me back to the shore.

GHOST.

Anger clings to my heart,  
Clings even now when neither wrath nor weeping  
Are aught but folly.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

CHORUS.

One thought consumes me,  
The anger of lust denied  
Covers me like darkness.  
I am become a demon dwelling  
In the hell of my dark thoughts,  
Storm-cloud of my desires.

GHOST.

"Though the waters parch in the fields  
Though the brooks run dry,  
Never shall the place be shown  
Of the spring that feeds my heart." <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_120.md)  
So I had resolved. Oh, why so cruelly  
Set they me to win  
Voice from a voiceless drum,  
Spending my heart in vain?  
And I spent my heart on the glimpse of a moon that slipped  
Through the boughs of an autumn tree. <span
id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_121.md)

CHORUS.

This damask drum that hangs on the laurel-tree

GHOST.

Will it sound, will it sound?

(*He seizes the* PRINCESS *and drags her towards the drum*.)

Try! Strike it!

CHORUS.

"Strike!" he cries;  
"The quick beat, the battle-charge!  
Loud, loud! Strike, strike," he rails,  
And brandishing his demon-stick  
Gives her no rest.  
"Oh woe!" the lady weeps,  
"No sound, no sound. Oh misery!" she wails.  
And he, at the mallet stroke, "Repent, repent!"  
Such torments in the world of night  
Abōrasetsu, chief of demons, wields, <span id="page_140">p. 140</span>  
Who on the Wheel of Fire  
Sears sinful flesh and shatters bones to dust.  
Not less her torture now!  
"Oh, agony!" she cries, "What have I done,  
By what dire seed this harvest sown?"

GHOST.

Clear stands the cause before you.

CHORUS.

Clear stands the cause before my eyes;  
                             I know it now.  
By the pool's white waters, upon the laurel's bough  
The drum was hung.  
He did not know his hour, but struck and struck  
Till all the will had ebbed from his heart's core;  
Then leapt into the lake and died.  
And while his body rocked  
Like driftwood on the waves,  
His soul, an angry ghost,  
Possessed the lady's wits, haunted her heart with woe,  
The mallet lashed, as these waves lash the shore,  
Lash on the ice of the eastern shore.  
The wind passes; the rain falls  
On the Red Lotus, the Lesser and the Greater. <span
id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_122.md)  
The hair stands up on my head.  
"The fish that leaps the falls  
To a fell snake is turned," <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_123.md)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In the Kwanze School this play is replaced by another called *The Burden
of Love*, also attributed to Seami, who writes (*Works*, p. 166): "*The
Burden of Love* was formerly *The Damask Drum*." The task set in the
later play is the carrying of a burden a thousand times round the
garden. The Gardener seizes the burden joyfully and begins to run with
it, but it grows heavier and heavier, till he sinks crushed to death
beneath it.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

I have learned to know them;  
Such, such are the demons of the World of Night.  
"O hateful lady, hateful!" he cried, and sank again  
Into the whirlpool of desire.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_116"></span>[134:1](npj23.htm#fr_118.md) A twelfth-century
folk-song (*Ryōjin Hisshō*, p. 126), speaks of "The Way of Love which
knows no castes of 'high' and 'low."

<span id="fn_117"></span>[136:1](npj23.htm#fr_119.md) A story from
*Huai-nan Tzŭ*. What looks like disaster turns out to be good fortune
and vice versa. The horse broke away and was lost. A revolution occurred
during which the Government seized all horses. When the revolution was
over the man of Sai's horse was rediscovered. If he had not lost it the
Government would have taken it.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[136:2](npj23.htm#fr_120.md) This simile, which
passed into a proverb in China and Japan, occurs first in *Chuang Tzŭ*,
chap. xxii.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[137:1](npj23.htm#fr_121.md) Compare the
"possession" in *Sotoba Komachi*.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[139:1](npj23.htm#fr_122.md) Adapted from a poem

<span id="fn_122"></span>[140:1](npj23.htm#fr_124.md) The names of two of
the Cold Hells in the Buddhist Inferno.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[140:2](npj23.htm#fr_125.md) There is a legend
that the fish who succeed in leaping a certain waterfall turn into
dragons. So the Gardener's attempt to raise himself to the level of the
Princess has changed him into an evil demon.
