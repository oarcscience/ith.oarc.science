### TANIKŌ

(THE VALLEY-HURLING)

PART I

By ZENCHIKU

PERSONS

A TEACHER.  
A YOUNG BOY.  
THE BOY'S MOTHER.  
LEADER OF THE PILGRIMS.  
PILGRIMS.  
CHORUS.

TEACHER.

I am a teacher. I keep a school at one of the temples in the City. I
have a pupil whose father is dead; he has only his mother to look after
him. Now I will go and say good-bye to them, for I am soon starting on a
journey to the mountains. (*He knocks at the door of the house*.) May I
come in?

BOY.

Who is it? Why, it is the Master who has come out to see us!

TEACHER.

Why is it so long since you came to my classes at the temple?

BOY.

I have not been able to come because my mother has been ill.

TEACHER.

I bad no idea of that. Please tell her at once that I am here.

BOY (*calling into the house*).

Mother, the Master is here.

MOTHER.

Ask him to come in.

BOY.

Please come in here.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

TEACHER.

It is a long time since I was here. Your son says you have been ill. Are
you better now?

MOTHER.

Do not worry about my illness. It is of no consequence.

TEACHER.

I am glad to hear it. I have come to say good-bye, for I am soon
starting on a ritual mountain-climbing.

MOTHER.

A mountain-climbing? Yes, indeed; I have heard that it is a dangerous
ritual. Shall you take my child with you?

TEACHER.

It is not a journey that a young child could make.

MOTHER.

Well,--I hope you will come back safely.

TEACHER.

I must go now.

BOY.

I have something to say.

TEACHER.

What is it?

BOY.

I will go with you to the mountains.

TEACHER.

No, no. As I said to your mother, we are going on a difficult and
dangerous excursion. You could not possibly come with us. Besides, how
could you leave your mother when she is not well? Stay here. It is in
every way impossible that you should go with us.

BOY.

Because my mother is ill I will go with you to pray for her.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

TEACHER.

I must speak to your mother again. (*He goes back into the inner room*.)
I have come back,--your son says he is going to come with us. I told him
he could not leave you when you were ill and that it would be a
difficult and dangerous road. I said it was quite impossible for him to
come. But he says he must come to pray for your health. What is to be
done?

MOTHER.

I have listened to your words. I do not doubt what the boy says,--that
he would gladly go with you to the mountains: (*to the* BOY) but since
the day your father left us I have had none but you at my side. I have
not had you out of mind or sight for as long a time as it takes a
dewdrop to dry! Give back the measure of my love. Let your love keep you
with me.

BOY.

This is all as you say. Yet nothing shall move me from my purpose. I
must climb this difficult path and pray for your health in this life.

CHORUS.

They saw no plea could move him.  
Then master and mother with one voice:  
"Alas for such deep piety,  
Deep as our heavy sighs."  
The mother said,  
"I have no strength left;  
If indeed it must be,  
Go with the Master.  
But swiftly, swiftly  
Return from danger."

BOY.

Checking his heart which longed for swift return  
At dawn towards the hills he dragged his feet. <span

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

TEACHER.

We have climbed so fast that we have already reached the first hut. We
will stay here a little while.

LEADER.

We obey.

BOY.

I have something to say.

TEACHER.

What is it?

BOY.

I do not feel well.

TEACHER.

Stay! Such things may not be said by those who travel on errands like
ours. Perhaps you are tired because you are not used to climbing. Lie
there and rest.

LEADER.

They are saying that the young boy is ill with climbing. I must ask the
Master about it.

PILGRIMS.

Do so.

LEADER.

I hear that this young boy is ill with climbing. What is the matter with
him? Are you anxious about him?

TEACHER.

He is not feeling well, but there is nothing wrong with him. He is only
tired with climbing.

LEADER.

So you are not troubled about him?

(*A pause*.)

PILGRIM.

Listen, you pilgrims. Just now the Master said this boy was only <span
id="page_194">p. 194</span> tired with climbing. But now he is looking
very strange. Ought we not to follow our Great Custom and hurl him into
the valley?

LEADER.

We ought to indeed. I must tell the Master. Sir, when I enquired before
about the child you told me he was only tired with climbing; but now he
is looking very strange.

Though I say it with dread, there has been from ancient times a Great
Custom that those who fail should be cast down. All the pilgrims are
asking that he should he thrown into the valley.

TEACHER.

What, you would hurl this child into the valley?

LEADER.

We would.

TEACHER.

It is a Mighty Custom. I cannot gainsay it. But I have great pity in my
heart for that creature. I will tell him tenderly of this Great Custom.

LEADER.

Pray do so.

TEACHER.

Listen carefully to me. It has been the law from ancient times that if
any pilgrim falls sick on such journey as these he should be hurled into
the valley,--done suddenly to death. If I could take your place, how
gladly I would die. But now I cannot help you.

BOY.

I understand. I knew well that if I came on this journey I might lose my
life.

Only at the thought  
Of my dear mother,  
How her tree of sorrow  
For me must blossom With flower of weeping.--  
I am heavy-hearted.

CHORUS.

Then the pilgrims sighing <span id="page_195">p. 195</span>  
For the sad ways of the world  
And the bitter ordinances of it,  
Make ready for the hurling.  
Foot to foot  
They stood together  
Heaving blindly,  
None guiltier than his neighbour.  
And clods of earth after  
And flat stones they flung. <span id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_183.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_182"></span>[192:1](npj34.htm#fr_184.md) Here follows a long
lyric passage describing their journey and ascent. The frequent
occurrence of place-names and plays of word on such names makes it
impossible to translate.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[195:1](npj34.htm#fr_185.md) I have only
summarized the last chorus. When the pilgrims reach the summit, they
pray to their founder, En no Gyōja, and to the God Fudō that the boy may
be restored to life. In answer to their prayers a Spirit appears
carrying the boy in her arms. She lays him at the Priest's feet and
vanishes again, treading the Invisible Pathway that En no Gyōja trod
when he crossed from Mount Katsuragi to the Great Peak without
descending into the valley.
