### KANTAN

PERSONS

HOSTESS.  
TWO LITTER BEARERS.  
ROSEI.  
BOY DANCER.  
ENVOY.  
TWO COURTIERS.  
CHORUS.

HOSTESS

I who now stand before you am a woman of the village of Kantan in China.
A long while ago I gave lodging to one who practised the arts of
wizardry; and as payment be left here a famous pillow, called the Pillow
of Kantan. He who sleeps on this pillow sees in a moment's dream the
past or future spread out before him, and so awakes illumined. If it
should chance that any worshipful travellers arrive today, pray send for
me.

(*She takes the pillow and lays it on the covered "daïs" which
represents at first the bed and afterwards the palace*.)

ROSEI (*enters*).

Lost on the journey of life, shall I learn at last  
That I trod but a path of dreams?

My name is Rosei, and I have come from the land of Shoku. Though born to
man's estate, I have not sought Buddha's way, but have drifted from dusk
to dawn and dawn to dusk.

They tell me that on the Hill of the Flying Sheep in the land of
So <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_146.md) there lives a mighty sage; and
now I am hastening to visit him that he may tell by what rule I should
conduct my life.

(*Song of Travel*.)

Deep hid behind the alleys of the sky  
Lie the far lands where I was wont to dwell.  
Over the hills I trail  
A tattered cloak; over the hills again:  
Fen-dusk and mountain-dusk and village-dusk <span id="page_157">p.
157</span>  
Closed many times about me, till to-day  
At the village of Kantan,  
Strange to me save in name, my journey ends.

I have travelled so fast that I am already come to the village of
Kantan. Though the sun is still high, I will lodge here to-night.
(*Knocking*.) May I come in?

HOSTESS.

Who is it?

ROSEI.

I am a traveller; pray give me lodging for the night.

HOSTESS.

Yes, I can give you lodging; pray come this way. You seem to be
travelling all alone. Tell me where you have come from and where you are
going.

ROSEI.

1 come from the land of Shoku. They tell me that on the Hill of the
Flying Sheep there lives a sage; and I am visiting him that he may tell
me by what rule I should conduct my life.

HOSTESS.

It is along way to the Hill of the Flying Sheep. Listen! A wizard once
lodged here and gave us a marvellous pillow called the Pillow of Kantan:
he who sleeps on it sees all his future in a moment's dream.

ROSEI.

Where is this pillow?

HOSTESS.

It is on the bed.

ROSEI.

I will go and sleep upon it.

HOSTESS.

And I meanwhile will heat you some millet at the fire.

ROSEI (*going to the bed*).

So this is the pillow, the Pillow of Kantan that I have heard such <span
id="page_158">p. 158</span> strange tales of? Heaven has guided me to
it, that I who came out t. learn the secret of life may taste the world
in a dream.

As one whose course swift summer-rain has stayed,  
Unthrifty of the noon he turned aside  
To seek a wayside dream;  
Upon the borrowed Pillow of Kantan  
He laid his head and slept.

(*While* ROSEI *is still chanting these words, the* ENVOY *enters,
followed by two* ATTENDANTS *who carry a litter. The* ENVOY *raps on the
post of the bed*.)

ENVOY.

Rosei, Rosei! I must speak with you.

(ROSEI*, who has been lying with his fan over his face, rises when the*
ENVOY *begins to speak*.)

ROSEI.

But who are you?

ENVOY.

I am come as a messenger to tell you that the Emperor of the Land of
So <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_147.md) resigns his throne and commands
that Rosei shall reign in his stead.

ROSEI.

Unthinkable! I a king? But for what reason am I assigned this task?

ENVOY.

I cannot venture to determine. Doubtless there were found in your
Majesty's countenance auspicious tokens, signs that you must rule the
land. Let us lose no time; pray deign to enter this palanquin.

ROSEI (*looking at the palanquin in astonishment*).

What thing is this? A litter spangled with a dew of shining stones? I am
not wont to ride. Such splendour! Oh, little thought I <span
id="page_159">p. 159</span>

When first my weary feet trod unfamiliar roads  
In kingly state to be borne to my journey's end.  
is it to Heaven I ride?

CHORUS.

In jewelled palanquin  
On the Way of Wisdom you are borne; here shall you learn  
That the flower of glory fades like a moment's dream.  
See, you are become a cloud-man of the sky. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_148.md)  
The palaces of ancient kings  
Rise up before you, Abō's Hall, the Dragon's Tower; <span
id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_149.md)  
High over the tall clouds their moonlit gables gleam.  
The light wells and wells like a rising tide. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_150.md)  
Oh splendid vision! A courtyard strewn  
With golden and silver sand;  
And they that at the four sides  
Pass through the jewelled door are canopied  
With a crown of woven light.  
In the Cities of Heaven, in the home of Gods, I had thought,  
Shine such still beams on walls of stone;  
Never on palace reared by hands of men.  
Treasures, a thousand kinds, ten thousand kinds,  
Tribute to tribute joined, a myriad vassal-kings  
Cast down before the Throne.  
Flags of a thousand lords, ten thousand lords  
Shine many-coloured in the sky,  
And the noise of their wind-flapping  
Rolls round the echoing earth.

ROSEI.

And in the east

CHORUS.

Over a silver hill of thirty cubits height  
A golden sun-wheel rose.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

ROSEI.

And in the west  
Over a golden hill of thirty cubits height  
A silver moon-wheel rose,  
To prove his words who sang  
"In the Palace of Long Life <span id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_151.md)  
The Springs and Autumns cease.  
Before the Gate of Endless Youth <span id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_152.md)  
The days and months pass slow." <span id="fr_155"></span>[3](#fn_153.md)

COURTIER.

I would address your Majesty. Your Majesty has reigned for fifty years.
Deign but to drink this drink and you shall live a thousand years. See!
I bring you the nectar and the grail.

ROSEI.

The nectar?

COURTIER.

It is the wine that Immortals drink.

ROSEI.

The grail?

COURTIER.

It is the cup from which they drink.

ROSEI.

The magic wine! A thousand generations shall pass

COURTIER.

Or ever the springtime of your glory fade.

ROSEI.

I bountiful . . .

COURTIER.

Your people prosperous.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

CHORUS.

For ever and ever  
The land secure;  
The flower of glory waxing;  
The "herb of increase," joy-increasing  
Into the cup we pour.  
See! from hand to hand it goes.  
"I will drink," he cries.

ROSEI.

Go circling, magic cup,

CHORUS.

Circling from hand to hand; <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_154.md)  
As at the Feast of Floating Cups <span id="fr_157"></span>[2](#fn_155.md)  
Hands thrust from damask sleeves detain  
The goblet whirling in the eager stream;  
Now launched, now landed! <span id="fr_158"></span>[3](#fn_156.md)  
Oh merry flashing light, that shall endure  
Long as the Silver Chalice <span id="fr_159"></span>[4](#fn_157.md) circles
space.

BOY DANCER.

The white chrysanthem-dew,

CHORUS.

"The dew of the flowers dripping day by day  
In how many thousand years  
Will it have grown into a pool?" <span id="fr_160"></span>[5](#fn_158.md)  
It shall not fail, it shall not fail,  
The fountain of our Immortality;  
He draws, and yet it wells;  
He drinks, and to his taste it is as sweet  
As the Gods' deathless food.  
His heart grows airy; day and night  
In unimagined revel, incomparable pride and glory  
Eternally shall pass.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

(*End of the* BOY DANCER'S *dance.* ROSEI*, who has been watching this
dance, now springs up in ecstasy to dance the Gaku or Court Dance*.)

ROSEI.

The spring-time of my glory fades not . . .

CHORUS.

Many times shall you behold  
The pale moon of dawn . . .

ROSEI.

This is the moon-men's dance;  
Cloud-like the feathery sleeves pile up; the song of joy  
From dusk to dawn I sing.

CHORUS.

All night we sing.  
The sun shines forth again,  
Sinks down, and it is night . . .

ROSEI.

Nay, dawn has come!

CHORUS.

We thought the morning young, and lo! the moon

ROSEI.

Again is bright.

CHORUS.

Spring scarce has opened her fresh flowers,

ROSEI.

When leaves are crimson-dyed.

CHORUS.

Summer is with us yet;

ROSEI.

Nay, the snow falls.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

CHORUS (*speaking for* ROSEI).

"I watched the seasons pass:  
Spring, summer, autumn, winter; a thousand trees,  
A thousand flowers were strange and lovely in their pride.  
So the time sped, and now  
Fifty years of glory have passed by me,  
And because they were a dream,

(*At this point an* ATTENDANT *brings back the pillow, and places it in
the "palace," which becomes a bed again*.)

All, all has vanished and I wake  
On the pillow where I laid my head,  
The Pillow of Kantan.

(*The BOY DANCER and the two COURTIERS slip out by the side-door
"kirido"; ROSEI has mounted the bed and is asleep*.)

HOSTESS (*tapping twice with her fan*).

Listen, traveller! Your millet is ready. Come quickly and eat your
dinner.

ROSEI (*rising slowly from the bed*).

Rosei has woken from his dream . . .

CHORUS.

Woken from his dream! The springs and autumns of fifty years  
Vanished with all their glory; dazed he rises from the bed.

ROSEI.

Whither are they gone that were so many . . .

CHORUS.

"The queens and waiting-ladies? What I thought their voices"

ROSEI.

Were but the whisperings of wind in the trees.

CHORUS.

The palaces and towers

ROSEI.

Were but the baiting-house of Kantan.

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

CHORUS.

The time of my glory,

ROSEI.

Those fifty years,

CHORUS.

Were but the space of a dream,

ROSEI.

Dreamed while a bowl of millet cooked!

CHORUS.

It is the Inscrutable, the Mystery.

ROSEI.

Yet when I well consider  
Man's life in the world of men . . .

CHORUS.

Then shall you find that a hundred years of gladness  
Fade as a dream when Death their sequence closes.  
Thus too has ended  
This monarch's fifty years of state.  
Ambition, length of days,  
Revels and kingly rule,  
All, all has ended thus, all was a dream  
Dreamed while the millet cooked.

ROSEI.

Glory be to the Trinity, <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_159.md)  
Glory to the Trinity!

CHORUS.

Seek you a sage to loose  
The bonds that bound you to life's woes?  
This pillow is the oracle you sought.  
Now shall the wayfarer, content to learn  
What here he learnt, that Life is but a dream,  
Turn homeward from the village of Kantan.
