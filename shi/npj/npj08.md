# ATSUMORI

### By SEAMI

PERSONS

THE PRIEST RENSEI (formerly the warrior Kumagai).  
A YOUNG REAPER, who turns out to be the ghost of Atsumori.  
HIS COMPANION.  
CHORUS.

PRIEST.

Life is a lying dream, he only wakes  
Who casts the World aside.

I am Kumagai no Naozane, a man of the country of Musashi. I have left my
home and call myself the priest Rensei; this I have done because of my
grief at the death of Atsumori, who fell in battle by my hand. Hence it
comes that I am dressed in priestly guise.

And now I am going down to Ichi-no-Tani to pray for the salvation of
Atsumori's soul.

(*He walks slowly across the stage, singing a song descriptive of his
journey*.)

I have come so fast that here I am already at Ichi-no-Tani, in the
country of Tsu.

Truly the past returns to my mind as though it were a thing of to-day.

But listen! I hear the sound of a flute coming from a knoll of rising
ground. I will wait here till the flute-player passes, and ask him to
tell me the story of this place.

REAPERS (*together*).

To the music of the reaper's flute  
No song is sung  
But the sighing of wind in the fields.

YOUNG REAPER.

They that were reaping,  
Reaping on that hill,<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>  
Walk now through the fields  
Homeward, for it is dusk.

REAPERS (*together*).

Short is the way that leads <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)  
From the sea of Suma back to my home.  
This little journey, up to the hill  
And down to the shore again, and up to the hill,--  
This is my life, and the sum of hateful tasks.  
If one should ask me  
I too <span id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md) would answer  
That on the shores of Suma  
I live in sadness.  
Yet if any guessed my name,  
Then might I too have friends.  
But now from my deep misery  
Even those that were dearest  
Are grown estranged. Here must I dwell abandoned  
To one thought's anguish:  
That I must dwell here.

PRIEST.

Hey, you reapers! I have a question to ask you.

YOUNG REAPER.

Is it to us you are speaking? What do you wish to know?

PRIEST.

Was it one of you who was playing on the flute just now?

YOUNG REAPER.

Yes, it was we who were playing.

PRIEST.

It was a pleasant sound, and all the pleasanter because one does not
look for such music from men of your condition.

YOUNG REAPER.

Unlocked for from men of our condition, you say! Have you not read:--

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

"Do not envy what is above you  
Nor despise what is below you"?  
Moreover the songs of woodmen and the flute-playing of herdsmen,  
Flute-playing even of reapers and songs of wood-fellers  
Through poets' verses are known to all the world.  
Wonder not to hear among us  
The sound of a bamboo-flute.

PRIEST.

You are right. Indeed it is as you have told me.  
Songs of woodmen and flute-playing of herdsmen . . .

REAPER.

Flute-playing of reapers . . .

PRIEST.

Songs of wood-fellers

REAPERS.

Guide us on our passage through this sad world.

PRIEST.

Song . . .

REAPER.

And dance

PRIEST.

And the flute . . .

And music of many instruments . . .

REAPER.

CHORUS.

These are the pastimes that each chooses to his taste.  
Of floating bamboo-wood  
Many are the famous flutes that have been made;  
Little-Branch and Cicada-Cage,  
And as for the reaper's flute,  
Its name is Green-leaf;  
On the shore of Sumiyoshi  
The Corean flute they play.<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>  
And here on the shore of Suma  
On Stick of the Salt-kilns  
The fishers blow their tune.

PRIEST.

How strange it is! The other reapers have all gone home, but you alone
stay loitering here. How is that?

REAPER.

How is it, you ask? I am seeking for a prayer in the voice of the
evening waves. Perhaps you will pray the Ten Prayers for me?

PRIEST.

I can easily pray the Ten Prayers for you, if you will tell me who you
are.

REAPER.

To tell you the truth--I am one of the family of Lord Atsumori.

PRIEST.

One of Atsumori's family? How glad I am!  
Then the priest joined his hands (*he kneels down*) and prayed:--

NAMU AMIDABU.

Praise to Amida Buddha!

"If I attain to Buddhahood,  
In the whole world and its ten spheres  
Of all that dwell here none shall call on my name  
And be rejected or cast aside."

CHORUS.

"Oh, reject me not!  
One cry suffices for salvation,  
Yet day and night  
Your prayers will rise for me.  
Happy am I, for though you know not my name,  
Yet for my soul's deliverance  
At dawn and dusk henceforward I know that you will pray."

So he spoke. Then vanished and was seen no more.

(*Here follows the Interlude between the two Acts, in which a recitation
concerning Atsumori's death takes place. These* <span id="page_40">p.
40</span> *interludes are subject to variation and are not considered
part of the literary text of the play*.)

PRIEST.

Since this is so, I will perform all night the rites of prayer for the
dead, and calling upon Amida's name will pray again for the salvation of
Atsumori.

(*The ghost of* ATSUMORI *appears, dressed as a young warrior*.)

ATSUMORI.

Would you know who I am  
That like the watchmen at Suma Pass  
Have wakened at the cry of sea-birds roaming  
Upon Awaji shore?  
Listen, Rensei. I am Atsumori.

PRIEST.

How strange! All this while I have never stopped beating my gong and
performing the rites of the Law. I cannot for a moment have dozed, yet I
thought that Atsumori was standing before me. Surely it was a dream.

ATSUMORI.

Why need it be a dream? It is to clear the karma of my waking life that
I am come here in visible form before you.

PRIEST.

Is it not written that one prayer will wipe away ten thousand sins?
Ceaselessly I have performed the ritual of the Holy Name that clears all
sin away. After such prayers, what evil can be left? Though you should
be sunk in sin as deep . . .

ATSUMORI.

As the sea by a rocky shore,  
Yet should I be salved by prayer.

PRIEST.

And that my prayers should save you . . .

ATSUMORI.

This too must spring <span id="page_41">p. 41</span>  
From kindness of a former life. <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)

PRIEST.

Once enemies . . .

ATSUMORI.

But now . . .

PRIEST.

In truth may we be named . . .

ATSUMORI.

Friends in Buddha's Law.

CHORUS.

There is a saying, "Put away from you a wicked friend; summon to your
side a virtuous enemy." For you it was said, and you have proven it
true.

And now come tell with us the tale of your confession, while the night
is still dark.

CHORUS.

He <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) bids the flowers of Spring  
Mount the tree-top that men may raise their eyes  
And walk on upward paths;  
He bids the moon in autumn waves be drowned  
In token that he visits laggard men  
And leads them out from valleys of despair.

ATSUMORI.

Now the clan of Taira, building wall to wall,  
Spread over the earth like the leafy branches of a great tree:

CHORUS.

Yet their prosperity lasted but for a day;  
It was like the flower of the convolvulus.  
There was none to tell them <span id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_14.md) <span
id="page_42">p. 42</span>

That glory flashes like sparks from flint-stone,  
And after,--darkness.  
Oh wretched, the life of men!

ATSUMORI.

When they were on high they afflicted the humble;  
When they were rich they were reckless in pride.  
And so for twenty years and more  
They ruled this land.  
But truly a generation passes like the space of a dream.  
The leaves of the autumn of Juyei <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md)  
Were tossed by the four winds;  
Scattered, scattered (like leaves too) floated their ships.  
And they, asleep on the heaving sea, not even in dream  
Went back to home.  
Caged birds longing for the clouds,--  
Wild geese were they rather, whose ranks are broken  
As they fly to southward on their doubtful journey.  
So days and months went by; Spring came again  
And for a little while  
Here dwelt they on the shore of Suma  
At the first valley. <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md)  
From the mountain behind us the winds blew down  
Till the fields grew wintry again.  
Our ships lay by the shore, where night and day  
The sea-gulls cried and salt waves washed on our sleeves.  
We slept with fishers in their buts  
On pillows of sand.  
We knew none but the people of Suma.  
And when among the pine-trees  
The evening smoke was rising,  
Brushwood, as they call it, <span id="fr_17"></span>[3](#fn_17.md)  
Brushwood we gathered  
And spread for carpet.  
Sorrowful we lived  
On the wild shore of Suma,  
Till the clan Taira and all its princes  
Were but villagers of Suma.

 

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

ATSUMORI.

But on the night of the sixth day of the second month  
My father Tsunemori gathered us together.  
"To-morrow," he said, "we shall fight our last fight.  
To-night is all that is left us."  
We sang songs together, and danced.

PRIEST.

Yes, I remember; we in our siege-camp  
Heard the sound of music  
Echoing from your tents that night,;  
There was the music of a flute . . .

ATSUMORI.

The bamboo-flute! I wore it when I died.

PRIEST.

We heard the singing . . .

ATSUMORI.

Songs and ballads . . .

PRIEST.

Many voices

ATSUMORI.

Singing to one measure.

(ATSUMORI *dances*.)

First comes the Royal Boat.

CHORUS.

The whole clan has put its boats to sea.  
He <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) will not be left behind;  
He runs to the shore.  
But the Royal Boat and the soldiers' boats  
Have sailed far away.

ATSUMORI.

What can he do? <span id="page_44">p. 44</span>  
He spurs his horse into the waves.  
He is full of perplexity. And then

CHORUS.

He looks behind him and sees  
That Kumagai pursues him;  
He cannot escape.  
Then Atsumori turns his horse  
Knee-deep in the lashing waves,  
And draws his sword.  
Twice, three times he strikes; then, still saddled,  
In close fight they twine; roll headlong together  
Among the surf of the shore.  
So Atsumori fell and was slain, but now the Wheel of Fate  
Has turned and brought him back.

(ATSUMORI *rises from the ground and advances toward the* PRIEST *with
uplifted sword*.)

"There is my enemy," he cries, and would strike,  
But the other is grown gentle  
And calling on Buddha's name  
Has obtained salvation for his foe;  
So that they shall be re-born together  
On one lotus-seat.  
"No, Rensei is not my enemy.  
Pray for me again, oh pray for me again."
