### HANAKATAMI

(THE FLOWER BASKET)

By KWANAMI; REVISED BY SEAMI

BEFORE he came to the throne, the Emperor Keitai <span
id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_196.md) loved the Lady Teruhi. On his accession
he sent her a letter of farewell and a basket of flowers. In the play
the messenger meets her On the road to her home; she reads the letter,
which in elaborately ceremonial language announces the Emperor's
accession and departure to the Capital.

TERUHI.

The Spring of our love is passed! Like a moon left lonely  
In the sky of dawn, back to the hills I go,  
To the home where once we dwelt.

(*She slips quietly from the stage, carrying the basket and letter. In
the next scene the* EMPEROR <span id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_197.md) *is
carried on to the stage in a litter borne by two attendants. It is the
coronation procession. Suddenly* TERUHI, *who has left her home
distraught, wanders on to the stage followed by her maid, who carries
the flower-basket and letter*.)

TERUHI (*speaking wildly*).

Ho, you travellers! Show me the road to the Capital! I am mad, you
say?  
Mad I may be; but love bids me ask. O heartless ones! why will they not
answer me?

MAID.

Madam, from these creatures we shall get no answer. Yet there is a sign
that will guide our steps to the City. Look, yonder the wild-geese are
passing!

 

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

TERUHI.

Oh well-remembered! For southward ever  
The wild-geese pass  
Through the empty autumn sky; and southward lies  
The city of my lord.

Then follows the "song of travel," during which Teruhi and her companion
are supposed to be journeying from their home in Echizen to the Capital
in Yamato. They halt at last on the *hashigakari*, announcing that they
have "arrived at the City." Just as a courtier (who together with the
boy-Emperor and the two litter-bearers represents the whole coronation
procession) is calling: "Clear the way, clear the way! The Imperial
procession is approaching," Teruhi's maid advances on to the stage and
crosses the path of the procession. The courtier pushes her roughly
back, and in doing so knocks the flower-basket to the ground.

MAID.

Oh, look what he has done! O madam, he has dashed your basket to the
ground, the Prince's flower-basket!

TERUHI.

What! My lord's basket? He has dashed it to the ground? Oh hateful deed!

COURTIER.

Come, mad-woman! Why all this fuss about a basket? You call it your
lord's basket; what lord can you mean?

TERUHI.

What lord should I mean but the lord of this land of Sunrise? Is there
another?

Then follow a "mad dance" and song. The courtier orders her to come
nearer the Imperial litter and dance again, that her follies may divert
the Emperor.

She comes forward and dances the story of Wu Ti and Li Fu-jēn. <span
id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_198.md) Nothing could console him for her death.
He ordered her portrait to be painted on the walls of his palace. But,
because the face neither laughed nor grieved, the sight of it increased
his sorrow. <span id="page_223">p. 223</span> Many wizards laboured at
his command to summon her soul before him. At last one of them projected
upon a screen some dim semblance of her face and form. But when the
Emperor would have touched it, it vanished, and he stood in the palace
alone.

COURTIER.

His Majesty commands you to show him your flower-basket.

(*She holds the basket before the* EMPEROR.)

COURTIER.

His Majesty has deigned to look at this basket. He says that without
doubt it was a possession of his rural days. <span
id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_199.md) He bids you forget the hateful letter
that is with it and be mad no more. He will take you back with him to
the palace.
