### TORI-OI

BY KONGŌ YAGORŌ

Bears a strong resemblance to *Take no Yuki*.  
The date of the author is unknown.

A CERTAIN lord goes up to the city to settle a lawsuit, leaving his
steward in charge of his estate. In his absence the steward grows
overbearing in his manner towards his mistress and her
[little](errata.htm#5.md) son, Hanawaka, finally compelling them to take
part in the arduous labour of "bird-scaring," rowing up and down the
river among the rice-fields, driving away the birds that attack the
crop.
