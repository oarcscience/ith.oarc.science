### NOTE ON UKAI.

SEAMI tells us (*Works*, p. 246) that this play was written by Enami no
Sayemon. "But as I removed bad passages and added good ones, I consider
the play to be really my work"--(p. 247).

On p. 245 he points out that the same play on words occurs in Ukai three
times, and suggests how one passage might be amended. The text of the
play which we possess to-day still contains the passages which Seami
ridiculed, so that it must be Enami no Sayemon's version which has
survived, while Seami's amended text is lost.

It is well known that Buddhism forbids the taking of life, especially by
cruel means or for sport. The cormorant-fisher's trade had long been
considered particularly wicked, as is shown by an early folksong: <span

"Woe to the [cormorant](errata.htm#2)-fisher  
Who binds the heads of his cormorants  
And slays the tortoise whose span is ten thousand æons!  
In this life he may do well enough,  
But what will become of him at his next birth?"

This song, which is at least as old as the twelfth century, and may be
much earlier, seems to be the seed from which the Nō play Ukai grew.
