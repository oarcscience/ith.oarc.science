# CHAPTER II

### KUMASAKA

### EBOSHI-ORI

### BENKEI ON THE BRIDGE

THESE three plays deal with the boyhood of the hero Yoshitsune, whose
child-name was Ushiwaka.

Eboshi-ori is a *genzai-mono*, that is to say a play which describes
events actually in progress. In *Kumasaka* these same events are
rehearsed by the ghost of one who participated in them. There are two
other well-known Yoshitsune plays, *Funa-Benkei* and *Ataka*. In the
former the phantoms of the dead Taira warriors attack the boat in which
Yoshitsune and Benkei are riding; in the latter occurs the famous scene
called the *Kwanjinchō*, in which Benkei pretends to read out from a
scroll a long document which he is in reality improvising on the spot.
(See Mr. Sansom's translations of these two plays in the *Transactions
of the Asiatic Society of Japan*, 1911.) The *Kwanjinchō* was borrowed
by the popular stage, and became one of the favourite "turns" of the
great Danjūrō (1660-1703) and his successors.
