### YAMAUBA

(THE DAME OF THE MOUNTAINS)

REVISED BY KOMPARU ZENCHIKU UJINOBU FROM AN ORIGINAL BY SEAMI

YAMAUBA is the fairy of the mountains, which have been under her care
since the world began. She decks them with snow in winter, with blossoms
in spring; her task carrying her eternally from hill to valley and
valley to hill. She has grown very old. Wild white hair hangs down her
shoulders; her face is very thin.

There was a courtesan of the Capital who made a dance representing the
wanderings of Yamauba. It had such success that people called this
courtesan "Yamauba" though her real name was Hyakuma.

Once when Hyakuma was travelling across the hills to Shinano to visit
the Zenkō Temple, she lost her way, and took refuge in the hut of a
"mountain-girl," who was none other than the real Yamauba.

In the second part of the play the aged fairy appears in her true form
and tells the story of her eternal wanderings--"round and round, on and
on, from hill to hill, from valley to valley." In spring decking the
twigs with blossom, in autumn clothing the hills with moonlight, in
winter shaking snow from the heavy clouds. "On and on, round and round,
caught in the Wheel of Fate. . . . Striding to the hill-tops, sweeping
through the valleys. . . ."

CHORUS.

On and on, from hill to hill.  
Awhile our eyes behold her, but now  
She is vanished over the hills,  
Vanished we know not where.

The hill, says a commentator, is the Hill of Life, where men wander from
incarnation to incarnation, never escaping from the Wheel of Life and
Death.
