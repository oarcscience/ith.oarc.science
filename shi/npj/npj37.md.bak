### HAKU RAKUTEN

By SEAMI

INTRODUCTION

THE Chinese poet Po Chü-i, whom the Japanese call Haku Rakuten, was horn
in 772 A. D. and died in 847. His works enjoyed immense contemporary
popularity in China, Korea and Japan. In the second half of the ninth
century the composition of Chinese verse became fashionable at the
Japanese Court, and native forms of poetry were for a time threatened
with extinction.

The Nō play *Haku Rakuten* deals with this literary peril. It was
written at the end of the fourteenth century, a time when Japanese art
and literature were again becoming subject to Chinese influence.
Painting and prose ultimately succumbed, but poetry was saved.

Historically, Haku Rakuten never came to Japan. But the danger of his
influence was real and actual, as may be deduced from reading the works
of Sugawara no Michizane, the greatest Japanese poet of the ninth
century. Michizane's slavish imitations of Po Chü-i show an unparalleled
example of literary prostration. The plot of the play is as follows:

Rakuten is sent by the Emperor of China to "subdue" Japan with his art.
On arriving at the coast of Bizen, he meets with two Japanese fishermen.
One of them is in reality the god of Japanese poetry, Sumiyoshi no Kami.
In the second act his identity is revealed. He summons other gods, and a
great dancing-scene ensues. Finally the wind from their dancing-sleeves
blows the Chinese poet's ship back to his own country.

Seami, in his plays, frequently quotes Po Chü-i's poems; and in his
lament for the death of his son, Zemparu Motomasa, who died in 1432, he
refers to the death of Po Chü-i's son, A-ts'ui.

PERSONS

RAKUTEN (a Chinese poet).  
AN OLD FISHERMAN, SUMIYOSHI NO KAMI, who in Act II becomes the God of
Japanese Poetry.  
ANOTHER FISHERMAN. CHORUS OF FISHERMEN.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

SCENE: The coast of Bizen in Japan.

HAKU.

I am Haku Rakuten, a courtier of the Prince of China. There is a land in
the East called Nippon. <span id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_187.md) Now, at my
master's bidding, I am sent to that land to make proof of the wisdom of
its people. I must travel over the paths of the sea.

I will row my boat towards the rising sun,  
    The rising sun;  
And seek the country that lies to the far side  
Over the wave-paths of the Eastern Sea.  
    Far my boat shall go,  
    My boat shall go,--  
With the light of the setting sun in the waves of its wake  
And a cloud like a banner shaking the void of the sky.  
Now the moon rises, and on the margin of the sea  
                      A mountain I discern.  
I am come to the land of Nippon,  
                      The land of Nippon.

So swiftly have I passed over the ways of the ocean that I am come
already to the shores of Nippon. I will cast anchor here a little while.
I would know what manner of land this may be.

THE TWO FISHERMEN (*together*).

Dawn over the Sea of Tsukushi,  
                      Place of the Unknown Fire.  
Only the moonlight--nothing else left!

THE OLD FISHERMAN.

The great waters toss and toss;  
The grey waves soak the sky.

THE TWO FISHERMEN.

So was it when Han Rei <span id="fr_190"></span>[2](#fn_188.md) left the
land of Etsu <span id="page_209">p. 209</span>  
And rowed in a little boat  
Over the misty waves of the Five Lakes.

How pleasant the sea looks!  
From the beach of Matsura  
Westward we watch the hill -less dawn.  
A cloud, where the moon is setting,  
Floats like a boat at sea,  
                       A boat at sea  
That would anchor near us in the dawn.  
Over the sea from the far side,  
From China the journey of a ship's travel  
Is a single night's sailing, they say.  
And lo! the moon has vanished!

HAKU.

I have borne with the billows of a thousand miles of sea and come at
last to the land of Nippon. Here is a little ship anchored near me. An
old fisherman is in it. Can this be indeed an inhabitant of Nippon?

OLD FISHERMAN.

Aye, so it is. I am an old fisher of Nihon. And your Honour, I think, is
Haku Rakuten of China.

HAKU.

How strange! No sooner am I come to this land than they call me by my
name! How can this be?

SECOND FISHERMAN.

Although your Honour is a man of China, your name and fame have come
before you.

HAKU.

Even though my name be known, yet that you should know my face is
strange surely!

THE TWO FISHERMEN.

It was said everywhere in the Land of Sunrise that your Honour, Rakuten,
would come to make trial of the wisdom of Nihon. And when, as we gazed
westwards, we saw a boat coming in from the open sea, the hearts of us
all thought in a twinkling, "This is he."

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

CHORUS.

"He has come, he has come."  
So we cried when the boat came in  
To the shore of Matsura,  
The shore of Matsura.  
Sailing in from the sea  
Openly before us--  
A Chinese ship  
And a man from China,--  
How could we fail to know you,  
     Haku Rakuten?  
But your halting words tire us.  
Listen as we will, we cannot understand  
     Your foreign talk.  
Come, our fishing-time is precious.  
     Let us cast our hooks,  
     Let us cast our hooks!

HAKU.

Stay! Answer me one question. <span id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_189.md)
Bring your boat closer and tell me, Fisherman, what is your pastime now
in Nippon?

FISHERMAN.

And in the land of China, pray how do your Honours disport yourselves?

HAKU.

In China we play at making poetry.

FISHERMAN.

And in Nihon, may it please you, we venture on the sport of making
"uta." <span id="fr_192"></span>[2](#fn_190.md)

HAKU.

And what are "uta"?

FISHERMAN.

You in China make your poems and odes out of the Scriptures of <span
id="page_211">p. 211</span> India; and we have made our "uta" out of the
poems and odes of China. Since then our poetry is a blend of three
lands, we have named it Yamato, the great Blend, and all our songs
"Yamato Uta." But I think you question me only to mock an old man's
simplicity.

HAKU.

No, truly; that was not my purpose. But come, I will sing a Chinese poem
about the scene before us.

"Green moss donned like a cloak  
Lies on the shoulders of the rocks;  
White clouds drawn like a belt  
Surround the flanks of the mountains."

How does that song please you?

FISHERMAN.

It is indeed a pleasant verse. In our tongue we should say the poem
thus:

Koke-goromo  
Kitaru iwao wa  
Samonakute,  
Kinu kinu yama no  
Obi wo, suru kana!

HAKU.

How strange that a poor fisherman should put my verse into a sweet
native measure! Who can he be?

FISHERMAN.

A poor man and unknown. But as for the making of "uta," it is not only
men that make them. "For among things that live there is none that has
not the gift of song." <span id="fr_193"></span>[1](#fn_191.md)

HAKU (*taking up the other's words as if hypnotized*).

"Among things that have life,--yes, and birds and insects--"

FISHERMAN.

They have sung Yamato songs.

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

HAKU.

In the land of Yamato ...

FISHERMAN.

... many such have been sung.

CHORUS.

"The nightingale singing on the bush,  
Even the frog that dwells in the pond  
I know not if it be in your Honour's land,  
But in Nihon they sing the stanzas of the "uta."  
And so it comes that an old man  
Can sing the song you have heard,  
A song of great Yamato.

CHORUS (*changing the chant*).

And as for the nightingale and the poem it made,-  
They say that in the royal reign  
Of the Emperor Kōren  
In the land of Yamato, in the temple of High Heaven  
A priest was dwelling. <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_192.md)  
Each year at the season of Spring  
There came a nightingale  
To the plum-tree at his window.  
And when he listened to its song  
He heard it singing a verse:

"*Sho-yō mei-chō rai  
Fu-sō gem-bon sei*."

And when he wrote down the characters,  
Behold, it was an "uta"-song  
Of thirty letters and one.  
And the words of the song--

FISHERMAN.

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

Thus first the nightingale,  
And many birds and beasts thereto,  
Sing "uta," like the songs of men.  
And instances are many;  
Many as the myriad pebbles that lie  
On the shore of the sea of Ariso.  
"For among things that live  
There is none that has not the gift of song."

Truly the fisherman has the ways of Yamato in his heart. Truly, this
custom is excellent.

FISHERMAN.

If we speak of the sports of Yamato and sing its songs, we should show
too what dances we use; for there are many kinds.

CHORUS.

Yes, there are the dances; but there is no one to dance.

FISHERMAN.

Though there be no dancer, yet even I--

CHORUS.

For drums-the beating of the waves.  
For flutes--the song of the sea-dragon.  
For dancer--this ancient man  
Despite his furrowed brow  
Standing on the furrowed sea  
Floating on the green waves  
Shall dance the Sea Green Dance.

FISHERMAN.

And the land of Reeds and Rushes . . .

CHORUS.

Ten thousand years our land inviolate!

\[*The rest of the play is a kind of "ballet"*; the words are merely a
commentary on the dances.\]

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

ACT II.

FISHERMAN (*transformed into* SUMIYOSHI NO KAMI*, the God of Poetry*).

Sea that is green with the shadow of the hills in the water!  
Sea Green Dance, danced to the beating of the waves.

(*He dances the Sea Green Dance*.)

Out of the wave-lands,  
Out of the fields of the Western Sea

CHORUS.

He rises before us,  
The God of Sumiyoshi,  
The God of Sumiyoshi!

THE GOD.

I rise before you  
The god--

CHORUS.

The God of Sumiyoshi whose strength is such  
That he will not let you subdue us, O Rakuten!  
So we bid you return to your home,  
Swiftly over the waves of the shore!  
First the God of Sumiyoshi came.  
Now other gods <span id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_193.md) have come--  
     Of Isé and Iwa-shimizu,  
     Of Kamo and Kasuga,  
     Of Ka-shima and Mi-shima,  
     Of Suwa and Atsuta.  
And the goddess of the Beautiful Island,  
The daughter of Shakāra  
King of the Dragons of the Sea--  
Skimming the face of the waves  
They have danced the Sea Green Dance.  
And the King of the Eight Dragons--  
With his Symphony of Eight Musics.  
As they hovered over the void of the sea,  
Moved in the dance, the sleeves of their dancing-dress <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span>  
Stirred up a wind, a magic wind  
That blew on the Chinese boat  
And filled its sails  
And sent it back again to the land of Han.  
Truly, the God is wondrous;  
The God is wondrous, and thou, our Prince,  
Mayest thou rule for many, many years  
     Our Land Inviolate!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_187"></span>[208:1](npj37.htm#fr_189.md) The fact that Haku is
a foreigner is conventionally emphasized by his pronunciation of this
word. The fishermen, when using the same word later on, called it
"Nihon."

<span id="fn_188"></span>[208:2](npj37.htm#fr_190.md) The Chinese call him
Fan Li. He lived in China in the fifth century B. C. Having rendered
important services to the country of Yüeh (Etsu), he went off with his
mistress in a skiff, knowing that if he remained in public life his
popularity was bound to decline. The Fishermen are vaguely groping
towards the idea of "a Chinaman" and a "boat." They are not yet
consciously aware of the arrival of Rakuten.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[210:1](npj37.htm#fr_191.md) Haku throughout omits
the honorific turns of speech which civility demands. The Fishermen
speak in elaborately deferential and honorific language. The writer
wishes to portray Haku as an ill-bred foreigner.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[210:2](npj37.htm#fr_192.md) "Uta," i.e. the
thirty-one syllable Japanese stanza.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[211:1](npj37.htm#fr_193.md) Quotation from the
Preface to the *Kokinshū* ("Collection of Songs Ancient and Modern").
The fact that Haku continues the quotation shows that he is under a sort
of spell and makes it clear for the first time that his interlocutor is
not an ordinary mortal. From this point onwards, in fact, the Fisherman
gradually becomes a God.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[212:1](npj37.htm#fr_194.md) The priest's acolyte
had died. The nightingale was the boy's soul.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[214:1](npj37.htm#fr_195.md) They do not appear on
the stage.
