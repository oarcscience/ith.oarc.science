### NOTE ON AOI NO UYE.

AT the age of twelve Prince Genji went through the ceremony of marriage
with Aoi no Uye (Princess Hollyhock), the Prime Minister's daughter. She
continued to live at her father's house and Genji at his palace. When he
was about sixteen he fell in love with Princess Rokujō, the widow of the
Emperor's brother; she was about eight years older than himself. He was
not long faithful to her. The lady Yūgao next engaged his affections. He
carried her one night to a deserted mansion on the outskirts of the
City. "The night was far advanced and they had both fallen asleep.
Suddenly the figure of a woman appeared at the bedside. "I have found
you!" it cried. "What stranger is this that lies beside you? What
treachery is this that you flaunt before my eyes?" And with these words
the apparition stooped over the bed, and made as though to drag away the
sleeping girl from Genji's side." <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_124.md)

Before dawn Yūgao was dead, stricken by the "living phantom" of Rokujō,
embodiment of her baleful jealousy.

Soon after this, Genji became reconciled with his wife Aoi, but
continued to visit Rokujō. One day, at the Kamo Festival, Aoi's way was
blocked by another carriage. She ordered her attendants to drag it
aside. A scuffle ensued between her servants and those of Rokujō (for
she was the occupant of the second carriage) in which Aoi's side
prevailed. Rokujō's carriage was broken and Aoi's pushed into the front
place. After the festival was over Aoi returned to the Prime Minister's
house in high spirits.

Soon afterwards she fell ill, and it is at this point that the play
begins.

There is nothing obscure or ambiguous in the situation. Fenollosa seems
to have misunderstood the play and read into it complications and
confusions which do not exist. He also changes the sex of the Witch,
though the Japanese word, *miko*, always has a feminine meaning. The
"Romance of Genji" (*Genji Monogatari*) was written by Lady Murasaki
Shikibu and was finished in the year 1004 A. D. Of its fifty-four
chapters only seventeen have been translated. <span

of which *Suma Genji* (Genji's exile

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

at Suma), *No no Miya* (his visit to Rokujō after she became a nun),
*Tamakatsura* (the story of Yūgao's daughter), and *Hajitomi* (in which
Yūgao's ghost appears) are the best known.

There is some doubt about the authorship of the play. Seami saw it acted
as a Dengaku by his father's contemporary Inūo. He describes Inūo's
entry on to the stage in the rôle of Rukujō and quotes the first six
lines of her opening speech. These lines correspond exactly with the
modern text, and it is probable that the play existed in some. thing
like its present form in the middle of the fourteenth century. Kwanze
Nagatoshi, the great-grandson of Seami, includes it in a list of Seami's
works; while popular tradition ascribes it to Seami's son-in-law
Zenchiku.
