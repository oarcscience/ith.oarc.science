### OMINAMESHI

By SEAMI

THE play is written round a story and a poem. A man came to the capital
and was the lover of a woman there. Suddenly he vanished and she, in
great distress, set out to look for him in the country he came from. She
found his house, and asked his servants where he was. They told her he
had just married and was with his wife. When she heard this she ran out
of the house and leapt into the Hōjō River.

GHOST OF THE LOVER.

When this was told him,  
Startled, perturbed, he went to the place;  
But when he looked,  
Pitiful she lay,  
Limp-limbed on the ground.  
Then weeping, weeping--

GHOST OF GIRL

He took up the body in his arms,  
And at the foot of this mountain  
Laid it to rest in earth.

GHOST OF LOVER.

And from that earth sprang up  
A lady-flower <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_200.md) and blossomed  
Alone upon her grave.  
Then he:  
"This flower is her soul."  
And still he lingered, tenderly  
Touched with his hand the petals' hem,  
Till in the flower's dress and on his own  
The same dew fell.  
But the flower, he thought, <span id="page_225">p. 225</span>  
Was angry with him, for often when he touched it  
It drooped and turned aside.

Such is the story upon which the play is founded. The poem is one by
Bishop Henjō (816-890):

O lady-flowers  
That preen yourselves upon the autumn hill,  
Even you that make so brave a show,  
Last but "one while."

Hito toki, "one while," is the refrain of the play. It was for "one
while" that they lived together in the Capital; it is for "one while"
that men are young, that flowers blossom, that love lasts. In the first
part of the play an aged man hovering round a clump of lady-flowers begs
the priest not to pluck them. In the second part this aged man turns
into the soul of the lover. The soul of the girl also appears, and both
are saved by the priest's prayers from that limbo (half death, half
life) where all must linger who die in the coils of *shūshin*,
"heart-attachment."
