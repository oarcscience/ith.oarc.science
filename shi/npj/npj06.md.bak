### NOTE ON BUDDHISM

The Buddhism of the Nō plays is of the kind called the "Greater
Vehicle," which prevails in China, Japan and Tibet. Primitive Buddhism
(the "Lesser Vehicle"), which survives in Ceylon and Burma, centres
round the person of Shākyamuni the historical Buddha and uses Pāli as
its sacred language. The "Greater Vehicle," which came into being about
the same time as Christianity and sprang from the same religious
impulses, to a large extent replaces Shākyamuni by a timeless, ideal
Buddha named Amida "Lord of Boundless Light," perhaps originally a
sun-god, like Ormuzd of the Zoroastrians. Primitive Buddhism had taught
that the souls of the faithful are absorbed into Nirvāna, in other words
into Buddha. The "Greater Vehicle" promised to its adherents an
after-life in Amida's Western Paradise. It produced scriptures in the
Sanskrit language, in which Shākyamuni himself describes this Western
Land and recommends the worship of Amida; it inculcated too the worship
of the Bodhisattvas, half-Buddhas, intermediaries between Buddha and
man. These Bodhisattvas are beings who, though fit to receive
Buddhahood, have of their own free will renounced it, that they may
better alleviate the miseries of mankind.

Chief among them is Kwannon, called in India Avalokiteshvara, who
appears in the world both in male and female form, but it is chiefly
thought of as a woman in China and Japan; Goddess of Mercy, to whom men
pray in war, storm, sickness or travail.

The doctrine of Karma and of the transmigration of souls was common both
to the earlier and later forms of Buddhism. Man is born to an endless
chain of re-incarnations, each one of which is, as it were, the fruit of
seed sown in that which precedes.

The only escape from this "Wheel of Life and Death" lies in *satori*
"Enlightenment," the realization that material phenomena are thoughts,
not facts.

Each of the four chief sects which existed in medieval Japan had its own
method of achieving this Enlightenment.

\(1\) The Amidists sought to gain *satori* by the study of the *Hokke
Kyō*, called in Sanskrit *Saddharma Pundarika Sūtra* or "Scripture of"

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

the Lotus of the True Law," or even by the mere repetition of its
complete title "Myōhō Renge Hokke Kyō." Others of them maintained that
the repetition of the formula "Praise to Amida Buddha" (*Namu Amida
Butsu*) was in itself a sufficient means of salvation.

\(2\) Once when Shākyamuni was preaching before a great multitude, he
picked up a flower and twisted it in his fingers. The rest of his
hearers saw no significance in the act and made no response; but the
disciple Kāshyapa smiled.

In this brief moment a perception of transcendental truth had flashed
from Buddha's mind to the mind of his disciple. Thus Kāshyapa became the
patriarch of the Zen Buddhists, who believe that Truth cannot be
communicated by speech or writing, but that it lies hidden in the heart
of each one of us and can he discovered by "Zen" or contemplative
introspection.

At first sight there would not appear to he any possibility of
reconciling the religion of the Zen Buddhists with that of the Amidists.
Yet many Zen masters strove to combine the two faiths, teaching that
Amida and his Western Paradise exist, not in time or space, but
mystically enshrined in men's hearts.

Zen denied the existence of Good and Evil, and was sometimes regarded as
a dangerous sophistry by pious Buddhists of other sects, as, for
example, in the story of Shunkwan (see [p. 227](npj41.htm#page_227).md) and
in The *Hōka Priests* (see [p. 165](npj29.htm#page_165).md), where the
murderer's interest in Zen doctrines is, I think, definitely regarded as
a discreditable weakness and is represented as the cause of his undoing.

The only other play, among those I have here translated, which deals
much with Zen tenets, is *Sotoba Komachi*. Here the priests represent
the *Shingon Shū* or Mystic Sect, while Komachi, as becomes a poetess,
defends the doctrines of Zen. For Zen was the religion of artists; it
had inspired the painters and poets of the Sung dynasty in China; it was
the religion of the great art-patrons who ruled Japan in the fifteenth
century. <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md)

It was in the language of Zen that poetry and painting were discussed;
and it was in a style tinged with Zen that Seami wrote of his own art.
But the religion of the Nō plays is predominantly Amidist; it is the
common, average Buddhism of medieval Japan.

\(3\) I have said that the priests in *Sotoba Komachi* represent the
Mystic Sect. The followers of this sect sought salvation by means of
charms and spells, corruptions of Sanskrit formulae. Their principal

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Buddha was Dainichi, "The Great Sun." To this
sect belonged the Yamabushi, mountain ascetics referred to in *Tanikō*
and other plays.

\(4\) Mention must be made of the fusion between Buddhism and Shintō.
The Tendai Sect which had its headquarters on Mount Hiyei preached an
eclectic doctrine which aimed at becoming the universal religion of
Japan. It combined the cults of native gods with a Buddhism tolerant in
dogma, but magnificent in outward pomp, with a leaning towards the
magical practices of Shingon.

The Little Saint of Yokawa in the play *Aoi no Uye* is an example of the
Tendai ascetic, with his use of magical incantations.
