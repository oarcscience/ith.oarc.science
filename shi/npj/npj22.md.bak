### UKAI (THE CORMORANT-FISHER)

By ENAMI NO SAYEMON (c.1400).

PERSONS

PRIEST.  
FISHER.  
SECOND PRIEST.  
YAMA, KING OF HELL.  
CHORUS.

PRIEST.

I am a priest from Kiyosumi in Awa. I have never yet seen the country of
Kai, so now I am minded to go there on pilgrimage.

(*Describing the journey*.)

On the foam of white waves  
From Kiyosumi in the land of Awa riding  
To Mutsura I come; to the Hill of Kamakura,  
Lamentably tattered, yet because the World  
Is mine no longer, unashamed on borrowed bed,  
Mattress of straw, to lie till the bell swings  
Above my pillow. Away, away! For dawn  
Is on the hemp-fields of Tsuru. Now the noonday sun  
Hangs high above us as we cross the hills.  
Now to the village of Isawa we come.  
Let us lie down and rest awhile in the shelter of this shrine.

(*The* FISHER *comes along the hashigakari towards the stage carrying a
lighted torch*.)

FISHER.

When the fisher's torch is quenched  
What lamp shall guide him on the dark road that lies before?  
Truly, if the World had tasked me hardly  
I might be minded to leave it, but this bird-fishing,  
Cruel though it be in the wanton taking of life away, <span
id="page_129">p. 129</span>  
Is a pleasant trade to ply  
Afloat on summer streams.

I have heard it told that Yūshi and Hakuyō vowed their love-vows  
by the moon, and were changed to wedded stars of heaven. And  
even to-day the high ones of the earth are grieved by moonless nights.  
Only 1 grow weary of her shining and welcome nights of darkness.  
But when the torches on the boats burn low,

Then, in the dreadful darkness comes repentance  
Of the crime that is my trade,  
My sinful sustenance; and life thus lived  
Is loathsome then.  
Yet I would live, and soon  
Bent on my oar I push between the waves  
To ply my hateful trade.

I will go up to the chapel as I am wont to do, and give my cormorants  
rest. (*Seeing the* PRIESTS.) What, have travellers entered here?

PRIEST.

We are pilgrim-priests. We asked for lodging in the village. But they
told us that it was not lawful for them to receive us, so we lay down in
the shelter of this shrine.

FISHER.

Truly, truly: I know of none in the village that could give you lodging.

PRIEST.

Pray tell me, sir, what brings you here?

FISHER.

Gladly. I am a cormorant-fisher. While the moon is shining I rest at
this shrine; but when the moon sinks, I go to ply my trade.

PRIEST.

Then you will not mind our lodging here. But, sir, this work of
slaughter ill becomes you; for I see that the years lie heavy on you.
Pray leave this trade and find yourself another means of sustenance.

FISHER.

You say well. But this trade has kept me since I was a child. I cannot
leave it now.

 

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

SECOND PRIEST.

Listen. The sight of this man. has brought back something to my mind.
Down this river there is a place they call Rock-tumble. And there, when
I passed that way three years ago, I met just such a fisherman as this.
And when I told him this cormorant-fishing was reckoned a sin against
life, I think he listened; for he brought me back to his house and
lodged me! with uncommon care.

FISHER.

And you are the priest that came then?

SECOND PRIEST.

Yes, I am he.

FISHER.

That cormorant-fisher died.

PRIEST.

How came he to die?

FISHER.

Following his trade, more shame to him. Listen to his story and give his
soul your prayers.

PRIEST.

Gladly we will.

FISHER (*seats himself facing the audience and puts down his torch*).

You must know that on this river of Isawa, for a stretch of three
leagues up stream and down, the killing of any living creature is
forbidden. Now at that Rock-tumble you spoke of there were many
cormorant-fishers who every night went secretly to their fishing. And
the people of the place, hating the vile trade, made plans to catch them
at their task. But he knew nothing of this; and one night he went there
secretly and let his cormorants loose.

There was an ambush set for him; in a moment they were upon him. "Kill
him!" they cried; "one life for many," was their plea. Then he pressed
palm to palm. "Is the taking of life forbidden in this place? Had I but
known it! But now, never again . . ." So with clasped hands he prayed
and wept; but none helped him; and as fishers set their stakes they
planted him deep in the stream. He cried, but no <span id="page_131">p.
131</span> sound came. (*Turning to the* PRIEST *suddenly*.) I am the
ghost of that fisherman.

PRIEST.

Oh strange! If that be so, act out before me the tale of your
repentance. Show me your sin and I will pray for you tenderly.

FISHER.

I will act before your eyes the sin that binds me, the cormorant-fishing
of those days. Oh give my soul your prayer!

PRIEST.

I will.

FISHER (*rising and taking up his torch*).

The night is passing. It is fishing-time.  
I must rehearse the sin that binds me.

PRIEST.

I have read in tales of a foreign land <span
id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_109.md)  
How sin-laden the souls of the dead  
Have toiled at bitter tasks;  
But strange, before my eyes  
To see such penance done!

FISHER (*describing his own action*).

He waved the smeared torches.

PRIEST (*describing the* FISHER'S *action*).

Girt up his coarse-spun skirts.

FISHER (*going to the "flute-pillar" and bending over as if opening a
basket*).

Then he opened the basket,

PRIEST.

And those fierce island-birds

FISHER.

Over the river-waves suddenly he loosed . . .

 

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

CHORUS.

See them, see them clear in the torches' light  
Hither and thither darting,  
Those frightened fishes. <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_110.md)  
Swift pounce the diving birds,  
Plunging, scooping,  
Ceaselessly clutch their prey:  
In the joy of capture  
Forgotten sin and forfeit  
Of the life hereafter!  
Oh if these boiling waters would be still,  
Then would the carp rise thick  
As goldfinch in a bowl.  
Look how the little *ayu* leap <span id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_111.md)  
Playing in the shallow stream.  
Hem them in: give them no rest!  
Oh strange!  
The torches burn still, but their light grows dim;  
And I remember suddenly and am sad.  
It is the hated moon!

(*He throws down the torch*.)

The lights of the fishing-boat are quenched;  
Homeward on the Way of Darkness <span id="fr_114"></span>[3](#fn_112.md)  
In anguish I depart.

(*He leaves the stage*.)

PRIEST (*sings his "machi-utai" or waiting-song, while the actor who has
taken the part of the* FISHER *changes into the mask and costume of the*
KING OF HELL.)

I dip my hand in the shallows,  
I gather pebbles in the stream.  
I write Scripture upon them,  
Upon each stone a letter of the Holy Law.<span id="page_133">p.
133</span>  
Now I cast them back into the waves and their drowned spell  
Shall raise from its abyss a foundered soul.

(*Enter* YAMA, KING OF HELL*; he remains on the hashigakari*.)

YAMA.

Hell is not far away:  
All that your eyes look out on in the world  
Is the Fiend's home.

I am come to proclaim that the sins of this man, who from the days of
his boyhood long ago has fished in rivers and streams, were grown so
many that they filled the pages of the Iron Book; <span
id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) while on the Golden Leaves there was not
a mark to his name. And he was like to have been thrown down into the
Deepest Pit; but now, because he once gave lodging to a priest, I am
commanded to carry him quickly to Buddha's Place.

The Demon's rage is stilled,  
The fisher's boat is changed  
To the ship of Buddha's Vow, <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_114.md)  
Lifeboat of the Lotus Law. <span id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_115.md)

Empress Jingō, who caught an *ayu* at Tamashima when on her way to fight
the Coreans.

twelve concluding lines, too full of Buddhist technicalities to interest
a general reader.
