### TANGO-MONOGURUI

By I-AMI

THERE are several plays which describe the fatal anger of a father on
discovering that his child has no aptitude for learning. One of these,
*Nakamitsu* or *Manjū*, has been translated by Chamberlain. The
*Tango-Monogurui*, a similar play, has usually been ascribed to Seami,
but Seami in his Works says that it is by a certain I-ami. The father
comes on to the stage and, after the usual opening, announces that he
has sent a messenger to fetch his son, whom he has put to school at a
neighbouring temple. He wishes to see what progress the boy is making,

FATHER (*to his* SERVANT).

I sent some one to bring Master Hanamatsu back from the temple. Has he
come yet?

SERVANT.

Yes, sir. He was here last night.

FATHER.

What? He came home last night, and I heard nothing about it?

SERVANT.

Last night he had drunk a little too much, so we thought it better not
to say that he was here.

FATHER.

Oho! Last night he was tipsy, was he? Send him to me.

(*The* SERVANT *brings* HANAMATSU.)

Well, you have grown up mightily since I saw you last.

I sent for you to find out how your studies are progressing. How far
have you got?

HANAMATSU.

I have not learnt much of the difficult subjects. Nothing worth <span
id="page_242">p. 242</span> mentioning of the Sūtras or Shāstras or
moral books. I know a little of the graduses and Eight Collections of
Poetry; but in the Hokke Scripture I have not got to the Law-Master
Chapter, and in the Gusha-shāstra I, have not got as far as the Seventh
Book.

FATHER.

This is unthinkable! He says he has not learnt anything worth
mentioning. Pray, have you talents in any direction?

SERVANT (*wishing to put in a good word for the boy*).

He's reckoned a wonderful hand at the chop-sticks and drum. <span
id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_208.md)

FATHER (*angrily*).

Be quiet! Is it your child I was talking of?

SERVANT.

No, sir, you were speaking of Master Hanamatsu.

FATHER.

Now then, Hanamatsu. Is this true? Very well then; just listen quietly
to me. These childish tricks--writing odes, capping verses and the like
are not worth anything. They're no more important than playing ball or
shooting toy darts. And as for the chop-sticks and drum--they are the
sort of instruments street urchins play on under the Spear <span
id="fr_211"></span>[2](#fn_209.md) at festival-time. But when I ask about
your studies, you tell me that in the Hokke you have not got to the
Law-Master Chapter, and in the Gusha-shāstra you have not reached the
Seventh Book. Might not the time you spent on the chop-sticks have been
better employed in studying the Seventh Book? Now then, don't excuse
yourself! Those who talk most do least. But henceforth you are no son of
mine. Be off with you now!

(*The boy hesitates, bewildered*.)

Well, if you can't get started by yourself I must help you.

(*Seizes him by the arm and thrusts him off the stage*.)

In the next scene Hanamatsu enters accompanied by a pious ship's
captain, who relates that he found the lad on the point of drowning
<span id="page_243">p. 243</span> himself, but rescued him, and, taking
him home, instructed him in the most recondite branches of knowledge,
for which he showed uncommon aptitude; now he is taking him back to
Tango to reconcile him with his father.

At Tango they learn that the father, stricken with remorse, has become
demented and is wandering over the country in search of his son.

Coming to a chapel of Manjushrī, the captain persuades the lad to read a
service there, and announces to the people that an eminent and learned
divine is about to expound the scriptures. Among the worshippers comes
an eccentric character whom the captain is at first unwilling to admit.

MADMAN.

Even madmen can school themselves for a while. I will not rave while the
service is being read.

CAPTAIN.

So be it. Then sit down here and listen quietly. (*To* HANAMATSU.) All
the worshippers have come. You had better begin the service at once.

HANAMATSU (*describing his own actions*).

Then because the hour of worship had come  
The Doctor mounted the pulpit and struck the silence-bell;  
Then reverently prayed:  
Let us call on the Sacred Name of Shākyamuni, once incarnate;  
On the Buddhas of the Past, the Present and the Time to Come.  
To thee we pray, Avalokita, Lord of the Ten Worlds;  
And all Spirits of Heaven and Earth we invoke.  
Praised be the name of Amida Buddha!

MADMAN (*shouting excitedly*).

Amida! Praise to Amida!

CAPTAIN.

There you go! You promised to behave properly, but now are
disturbing <span id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_210.md) the whole congregation
by your ravings. I never heard such senseless shouting.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

(*A lyrical dialogue follows full of poetical allusions, from which it
is apparent that the* MADMAN *is crying to Amida to save a child's
soul*.)

CAPTAIN.

Listen, Madman! The Doctor heard you praying for a child's soul. He
wishes you to tell him your story.

The father and son recognize one another. The son flings him, self down
from the pulpit and embraces his father. They go home together,
attributing their reunion to the intervention of Manjushrī, the God of
Wisdom.
