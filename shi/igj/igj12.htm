<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Japanese Buddhist Proverbs</H1>
<P>AS representing that general quality of moral experience which remains almost unaffected by social modifications of any sort, the proverbial sayings of a people must always possess a special psychological interest for thinkers. In this kind of folklore the oral and the written literature of Japan is rich to a degree that would require a large book to exemplify. To the subject as a whole no justice could be done within the limits of a single essay. But for certain classes of proverbs and proverbial phrases something can be done within even a few pages; and sayings related to Buddhism, either by allusion or derivation, form a class which seems to me particularly worthy of study. Accordingly, with the help of a Japanese friend, I have selected and translated the following series of examples,--choosing the more simple and</P>
<P>{p. 168}</P>
<P>familiar where choice was possible, and placing the originals in alphabetical order to facilitate reference. Of course the selection is imperfectly representative; but it will serve to illustrate certain effects of Buddhist teaching upon popular thought and speech.</P>
<P>1.--<I>Akuji mi ni tomaru</I>.</P>
<P>All evil done clings to the body.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>2.--<I>Atama soru yori kokoro wo sor&eacute;.</P>
</I><P>Better to shave the heart than to shave the head.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>3.--<I>Au wa wakar&eacute; no hajim&eacute;</I>.</P>
<P>Meeting is only the beginning of separation.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The consequence of any evil act or thought never,--so long as karma endures,--will cease to act upon the existence of the person guilty of it.</P>
<P>2. Buddhist nuns and priests have their heads completely shaven. The proverb signifies that it is better to correct the heart,--to conquer all vain regrets and desires,--than to become a religious. In common parlance the phrase "to shave the head" means to become a monk or a nun.</P>
<P>3. Regret and desire are equally vain in this world of impermanency; for all joy is the beginning of an experience that must have its pain. This proverb refers directly to the sutra-text,--<I>Sh&ocirc;ja hitsumetsu &eacute;-sha-jori</I>,--"All that live must surely die; and all that meet will surely part."]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 169}</P>
<P>4.--<I>Banji wa yum&eacute;</I>.</P>
<P>All things<SUP>[1]</SUP> are merely dreams.</P>
<P>5.--<I>Bonbu mo sator&eacute;ba hotok&eacute; nari.</P>
</I><P>Even a common man by obtaining knowledge becomes a Buddha.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>6.--<I>Bonn&ocirc; kun&ocirc;.</P>
</I><P>All lust is grief.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><P>7.--<I>Bupp&ocirc; to wara-ya no am&eacute;, d&eacute;t&eacute; kik&eacute;.</P>
</I><P>One must go outside to hear Buddhist doctrine or the sound of rain on a straw roof.<SUP>[4]</P>
</SUP><P>8.--<I>Bussh&ocirc; en yori okoru.</P>
</I><P>Out of karma-relation even the divine nature itself grows.<SUP>[5]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Literally, "ten thousand things."</P>
<P>2. The only real differences of condition are differences in knowledge of the highest truth.</P>
<P>3. All sensual desire invariably brings sorrow.</P>
<P>4. There is an allusion here to the condition of the <I>shukk&eacute;</I> (priest): literally, "one who has left his house." The proverb suggests that the higher truths of Buddhism cannot be acquired by those who continue to live in the world of follies and desires.</P>
<P>5. There is good as well as bad karma. Whatever happiness we enjoy is not less a consequence of the acts and thoughts of previous lives, than is any misfortune that {footnote p. 170} comes to us. Every good thought and act contributes to the evolution of the Buddha-nature within each of us. Another proverb [No. 10],--<I>En naki shuj&ocirc; wa doshi gatashi</I>,--further illustrates the meaning of this one.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 170}</P>
<P>9.--<I>Enk&ocirc; ga tsuki wo toran to suru ga gotoshi.</P>
</I><P>Like monkeys trying to snatch the moon's reflection on water.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>10.--<I>En naki shuj&ocirc; wa doshi gatashi.</P>
</I><P>To save folk having no karma-relation would be difficult indeed!<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>11.--<I>Fuji sepp&ocirc; suru h&ocirc;shi wa, hiratak&eacute; ni umaru.</P>
</I><P>The priest who preaches foul doctrine shall be reborn as a fungus.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Allusion to a parable, said to have been related by the Buddha himself, about some monkeys who found a well under a tree, and mistook for reality the image of the moon in the water. They resolved to seize the bright apparition. One monkey suspended himself by the tail from a branch overhanging the well, a second monkey clung to the first, a third to the second, a fourth to the third, and so on,--till the long chain of bodies had almost reached the water. Suddenly the branch broke under the unaccustomed weight; and all the monkeys were drowned.</P>
<P>2. No karma-relation would mean an utter absence of merit as well as of demerit.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 171}</P>
<P>12.--<I>Gaki mo ninzu.</P>
</I><P>Even gaki (<I>pr&ecirc;tas</I>) can make a crowd.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>13.--<I>Gaki no m&eacute; ni midzu mi&eacute;zu.</P>
</I><P>To the eyes of gaki water is viewless.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>14.--<I>Gosh&ocirc; wa daiji.</P>
</I><P>The future life is the all-important thing.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><P>15.--<I>Gun-m&ocirc; no tai-z&ocirc; wo saguru ga gotoshi.</P>
</I><P>Like a lot of blind men feeling a great elephant.<SUP>[4]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Literally: "Even gaki are a multitude (or, 'population')." This is a popular saying used in a variety of ways. The ordinary meaning is to the effect that no matter how poor or miserable the individuals composing a multitude, they collectively represent a respectable force. Jocosely the saying is sometimes used of a crowd of wretched or tired-looking people,--sometimes of an assembly of weak boys desiring to make some demonstration,--sometimes of a miserable-looking company of soldiers.--Among the lowest classes of the people it is not uncommon to call a deformed or greedy person a "gaki."</P>
<P>2 Some authorities state that those <I>pr&ecirc;tas</I> who suffer especially from thirst, as a consequence of faults committed in former lives, are unable to see water. This proverb is used in speaking of persons too stupid or vicious to perceive a moral truth.</P>
<P>3. The common people often use the curious expression "<I>gosho-daiji</I>" as an equivalent for "extremely important."</P>
<P>4. Said of those who ignorantly criticise the doctrines of {footnote p. 172} Buddhism.--The proverb alludes to a celebrated fable in the <I>Avad&acirc;nas</I>, about a number of blind men who tried to decide the form of an elephant by feeling the animal. One, feeling the leg, declared the elephant to be like a tree; another, feeling the trunk only, declared the elephant to be like a serpent; a third, who felt only the side, said that the elephant was like a wall; a fourth, grasping the tail, said that the elephant was like a rope, etc.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 172}</P>
<P>16.--<I>Gwai-men nyo-Bosatsu; nai shin nyo-Yasha.</P>
</I><P>In outward aspect a Bodhisattva; at innermost heart a demon.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>17.--<I>Hana wa n&eacute; ni kaeru.</P>
</I><P>The flower goes back to its root.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>18.--<I>Hibiki no ko&euml; ni ozuru ga gotoshi.</P>
</I><P>Even as the echo answers to the voice.<SUP>[3]</SUP></P>
<P>19.--<I>Hito wo tasuk&eacute;ru ga shukk&eacute; no yuku.</P>
</I><P>The task of the priest is to save mankind.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Yasha (Sanscrit <I>Yaksha</I>), a man-devouring demon.</P>
<P>2. This proverb is most often used in reference to death,--signifying that all forms go back into the nothingness out of which they spring. But it may also be used in relation to the law of cause-and-effect.</P>
<P>3. Referring to the doctrine of cause-and-effect. The philosophical beauty of the comparison will be appreciated only if we bear in mind that even the tone of the echo repeats the tone of the voice.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 173}</P>
<P>20.--<I>Hi wa kiyur&eacute;domo t&ocirc;-shin wa hiy&eacute;dzu.</P>
</I><P>Though the flame be put out, the wick remains.<SUP>[1]</SUP></P>
<P>21.--<I>Hotok&eacute; mo motowa bonbu.</P>
</I><P>Even the Buddha was originally but a common man.</P>
<P>22.--<I>Hotok&eacute; ni naru mo shami wo heru.</P>
</I><P>Even to become a Buddha one must first become a novice.</P>
<P>23.--<I>Hotok&eacute; no kao mo sando.</P>
</I><P>Even a Buddha's face,--only three times.<SUP><SUP>[2]</SUP></P>
</SUP><P>24.--<I>Hotok&eacute; tanond&eacute; Jigoku &eacute; yuku.</P>
</I><P>Praying to Buddha one goes to hell.<SUP>[3]</SUP></P>
<P>2 5.--<I>Hotok&eacute; tsukutt&eacute; tamashii ir&eacute;dzu.</P>
</I><P>Making a Buddha without putting in the soul.<SUP>[4]</SUP></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Although the passions may be temporarily overcome, their sources remain. A proverb of like meaning is, <I>Bonn&ocirc; no inu o&euml;domo sarazu</I>: "Though driven away, the Dog of Lust cannot be kept from coming back again."</P>
<P>2. This is a short popular form of the longer proverb, <I>Hotok&eacute; no kao mo sando nazur&eacute;ba, hara wo tatsu:</I> "Stroke even the face of a Buddha three times, and his anger will be roused."</P>
<P>3. The popular saying, <I>Oni no Nembutsu</I>,"--a devil's praying,"--has a similar meaning.</P>
<P>4. That is to say, making an image of the Buddha without giving it a soul. This proverb is used in reference to {footnote p. 174} the conduct of those who undertake to do some work, and leave the most essential part of the work unfinished. It contains an allusion to the curious ceremony called <I>Kai-gen</I>, or--"Eye-Opening." This <I>Kai-gen</I> is a kind of consecration, by virtue of which a newly-made image is supposed to become animated by the real presence of the divinity represented.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 174}</P>
<P>26.--<I>Ichi-ju no kag&eacute;, ichi-ga no nagar&eacute;, tash&ocirc; no en.</P>
</I><P>Even [the experience of] a single shadow or a single flowing of water, is [made by] the karma-relations of a former life.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>2 7.--<I>Ichi-m&ocirc; sh&ucirc;-m&ocirc; wo hiku.</P>
</I><P>One blind man leads many blind Men.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>28.--<I>Ingwa na ko.</P>
</I><P>A karma-child.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Even so trifling an occurrence as that of resting with another person under the shadow of a tree, or drinking from the same spring with another person, is caused by the karma-relations of some previous existence.</P>
<P>2. From the Buddhist work <I>Dai-chi-d&ocirc;-ron</I>.--The reader will find a similar proverb in Rhys-David's "<I>Buddhist Suttas</I>" (Sacred Books of the East), p. 173,--together with a very curious parable, cited in a footnote, which an Indian commentator gives in explanation.</P>
<P>3. A common saying among the lower classes in reference to an unfortunate or crippled child. Here the word <I>ingwa</I> is used especially in the retributive sense. It usually signifies evil karma; <I>kwab&ocirc;</I> being the term used in speaking of meritorious {footnote p. 175} karma and its results. While an unfortunate child is spoken of as "a child of <I>ingwa</I>," a very lucky person is called a "<I>kwab&ocirc;-mono</I>,"--that is to say, an instance, or example of <I>kwab&ocirc;</I>.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 175}</P>
<P>29.--<I>Ingwa wa, kuruma no wa.</P>
</I><P>Cause-and-effect is like a wheel.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>30.--<I>Innen ga fukai.</P>
</I><P>The karma-relation is deep.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>31.--<I>Inochi wa f&ucirc;-zen no tomoshibi.</P>
</I><P>Life is a lamp-flame before a wind.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><P>32.--<I>Issun no mushi ni mo, gobu no tamashii.</P>
</I><P>Even a worm an inch long has a soul half-an-inch long.<SUP>[4]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The comparison of karma to the wheel of a wagon will be familiar to students of Buddhism. The meaning of this proverb is identical with that of the <I>Dhammapada</I> verse:--"If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage."</P>
<P>2. A saying very commonly used in speaking of the attachment of lovers, or of the unfortunate results of any close relation between two persons.</P>
<P>3. Or, "like the flame of a lamp exposed to the wind." A frequent expression in Buddhist literature is, "the Wind of Death."</P>
<P>4. Literally, "has a soul of five bu,"--five <I>bu</I> being equal to half of the Japanese inch. Buddhism forbids all taking {footnote p. 176} of life, and classes as <I>living</I> things (<I>Uj&ocirc;</I>) all forms having sentiency. The proverb, however,--as the use of the word "soul" (<I>tamashii</I>) implies,--reflects popular belief rather than Buddhist philosophy. It signifies that any life, however small or mean, is entitled to mercy.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 176}</P>
<P>33.--<I>Iwashi</I><SUP>[1]</SUP><I> no atama mo shinjin kara.</P>
</I><P>Even the head of an <I>iwashi</I>, by virtue of faith, [will have power to save, or heal].</P>
<P>34. <I>Jig&ocirc;-jitoku.</I><SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>The fruit of one's own deeds [in a previous state of existence].</P>
<P>35. <I>Jigoku d&eacute; hotok&eacute;.</P>
</I><P>Like meeting with a Buddha in hell.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The <I>iwashi</I> is a very small fish, much resembling a sardine. The proverb implies that the object of worship signifies little, so long as the prayer is made with perfect faith and pure intention.</P>
<P>2. Few popular Buddhist phrases are more often used than this. <I>Jig&ocirc;</I> signifies one's own acts or thoughts; <I>jitoku</I>, to bring upon oneself,--nearly always in the sense of misfortune, when the word is used in the Buddhist way. "Well, it is a matter of <I>Jig&ocirc;-jitoku</I>," people will observe on seeing a man being taken to prison; meaning, "He is reaping the consequence of his own faults."</P>
<P>3 Refers to the joy of meeting a good friend in time of misfortune. The above is an abbreviation. The full proverb is, <I>Jigoku d&eacute; hotok&eacute; ni &ocirc;ta yo da.</I>]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 177}</P>
<P>36.--<I>Jigoku Gokuraku wa kokoro ni ari.</P>
</I><P>Hell and Heaven are in the hearts of men.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>37.--<I>Jigoku mo sumika.</P>
</I><P>Even Hell itself is a dwelling-place.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>38.--<I>Jigoku ni mo shiru hito.</P>
</I><P>Even in hell old acquaintances are welcome.</P>
<P>39.--<I>Kag&eacute; no katachi ni shitagau gotoshi.</P>
</I><P>Even as the shadow follows the shape.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><P>40.--<I>Kan&eacute; wa Amida yori hikaru.</P>
</I><P>Money shines even more brightly than Amida.<SUP>[4]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. A proverb in perfect accord with the higher Buddhism.</P>
<P>2. Meaning that even those obliged to live in hell must learn to accommodate themselves to the situation. One should always try to make the best of circumstances. A proverb of kindred signification is, <I>Sumeha, Miyako:</I> "Wheresover one's home is, that is the Capital [or, Imperial City]."</P>
<P>3. Referring to the doctrine of cause-and-effect. Compare with verse 2 of the <I>Dhammapada</I>.</P>
<P>4. Amit&acirc;bha, the Buddha of Immeasurable Light. His image in the temples is usually gilded from head to foot.--There are many other ironical proverbs about the power of wealth,-such as <I>Jigoku no sata mo kan&eacute; shidai:</I> "Even the Judgments of Hell may be influenced by money."]</P>

<P>{p. 179}</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/17900.jpg" ALT="Emma Dai-&ocirc;"></P>
<P>{p. 180}</P>
<P>41.--<I>Karu-toki no Jiz&ocirc;-gao; nasu-toki no Emma-gao.</P>
</I><P>Borrowing-time, the face of Jiz&ocirc;; repaying-time, the face of Emma.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>42.--Kitt&eacute; Gokuraku, mit&eacute; Jigoku.</P>
<P>Heard of only, it is Paradise; seen, it is Hell.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>43.--<I>K&ocirc;ji mon wo id&eacute;zu: akuji sen ri wo hashiru.</P>
</I><P>Good actions go not outside of the gate: bad deeds travel a thousand <I>ri</I>.</P>
<P>44.--<I>Kokoro no koma ni tadzuna wo yurusuna.</P>
</I><P>Never let go the reins of the wild colt of the heart.</P>
<P>4 5.--<I>Kokoro no oni ga mi wo s&eacute;m&eacute;ru.</P>
</I><P>The body is tortured only by the demon of the heart.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Emma is the Chinese and Japanese Yama,--in Buddhism the Lord of Hell, and the Judge of the Dead. The proverb is best explained by the accompanying drawings, which will serve to give an idea of the commoner representations of both divinities.</P>
<P>2. Rumor is never trustworthy.</P>
<P>3. Or "mind." That is to say that we suffer only from the consequences of our own faults.--The demon-torturer in the Buddhist hell says to his victim:--"Blame not me!--I am only the creation of your own deeds and thoughts: you made me for this!"--Compare with No. 36.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 181}</P>
<P>46.--<I>Kokoro no shi to wa nar&eacute;; kokoro wo shi to sezar&eacute;.</P>
</I><P>Be the teacher of your heart: do not allow your heart to become your teacher.</P>
<P>47.--<I>Kono yo wa kari no yado.</P>
</I><P>This world is only a resting-place.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>48.--<I>Kori wo chiribam&eacute;; midzu ni &eacute;gaku.</P>
</I><P>To inlay ice; to paint upon water.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>49.--</P><DIR>

<I><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korokoro to<BR>
Naku wa yamada no<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hototogisu,<BR>
Chichi nit&eacute;ya aran,<BR>
Haha nit&eacute;ya aran.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P>The bird that cries <I>korokoro</I> in the mountain rice--field I know to be a <I>hototogisu</I>;--yet it may</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. "This world is but a travellers' inn," would be an almost equally correct translation. <I>Yado</I> literally means a lodging, shelter, inn; and the word is applied often to those wa side resting-houses at which Japanese travellers halt during a journey. <I>Kari</I> signifies temporary, transient, fleeting,--as in the common Buddhist saying, <I>Kono yo kari no yo:</I> "This world is a fleeting world." Even Heaven and Hell represent to the Buddhist only halting places upon the journey to Nirv&acirc;na.</P>
<P>2. Refers to the vanity of selfish effort for some merely temporary end.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 182}</P>
<P>have been my father; it may have been my mother.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>50.--<I>Ko wa Sangai no kubikase.</P>
</I><P>A child is a neck-shackle for the Three States of Existence.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>51.--<I>Kuchi wa wazawai no kado.</P>
</I><P>The mouth is the front-gate of all misfortune.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This verse-proverb is cited in the Buddhist work <I>W&ocirc;j&ocirc; Y&ocirc;sh&ucirc;</I>, with the following comment:--"Who knows whether the animal in the field, or the bird in the mountain-wood, has not been either his father or his mother in some former state of existence?"--The <I>hototogisu</I> is a kind of cuckoo.</P>
<P>2. That is to say, The love of parents for their child may impede their spiritual progress--not only in this world, but through all their future states of being,--just as a <I>kubikas&eacute;</I>, or Japanese cangue, impedes the movements of the person upon whom it is placed. Parental affection, being the strongest of earthly attachments, is particularly apt to cause those whom it enslaves to commit wrongful acts in the hope of benefiting their offspring.--The term <I>Sangai</I> here signifies the three worlds of Desire, Form, and Formlessness,--all the states of existence below Nirv&acirc;na. But the word is sometimes used to signify the Past, the Present, and the Future.</P>
<P>3. That is to say, The chief cause of trouble is unguarded speech. The word <I>Kado</I> means always the main entrance to a residence.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 183}</P>
<P>52.--<I>Kwah&ocirc; wa, n&eacute;t&eacute; mat&eacute;.</P>
</I><P>If you wish for good luck, sleep and wait.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>53.--<I>Makanu tan&eacute; wa ha&euml;nu.</P>
</I><P>Nothing will grow, if the seed be not sown.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>54.--<I>Mat&eacute;ba, kanr&ocirc; no hiyori.</P>
</I><P>If you wait, ambrosial weather will come.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><P>55.--<I>Meid&ocirc; no michi ni &Ocirc; wa nashi.</P>
</I><P>There is no King on the Road of Death.<SUP>[4]</P>
</SUP><P>56.--<I>Mekura hebi ni ojizu.</P>
</I><P>The blind man does not fear the snake.<SUP>[5]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. <I>Kwah&ocirc;</I>, a purely Buddhist term, signifying good fortune as the result of good actions in a previous life, has come to mean in common parlance good fortune of any kind. The proverb is often used in a sense similar to that of the English saying: "Watched pot never boils." In a strictly Buddhist sense it would mean, "Do not be too eager for the reward of good deeds."</P>
<P>2. Do not expect harvest, unless you sow the seed. Without earnest effort no merit can be gained.</P>
<P>3. Kanr&ocirc;, the sweet dew of Heaven, or <I>amrita</I>. All good things come to him who waits.</P>
<P>4 Literally, "on the Road of Meid&ocirc;." The <I>Meid&ocirc;</I> is the Japanese Hades,--the dark under-world to which all the dead must journey.</P>
<P>5 The ignorant and the vicious, not understanding the law of cause-and-effect, do not fear the certain results of their folly.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 184}</P>
<P>57.--<I>Mitsur&eacute;ba, kakuru.</P>
</I><P>Having waxed, wanes.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>58.--<I>Mon zen no koz&ocirc; narawanu ky&ocirc; wo yomu.</P>
</I><P>The shop-boy in front of the temple-gate repeats the s&ucirc;tra which he never learned.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>59.--<I>Muj&ocirc; no kaz&eacute; wa, toki erabazu.</P>
</I><P>The Wind of Impermanency does not choose a time.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. No sooner has the moon waxed full than it begins to wane. So the height of prosperity is also the beginning of fortune's decline.</P>
<P>2. <I>Koz&ocirc;</I> means "acolyte" as well as "shop-boy," "errand-boy," or "apprentice;" but in this case it refers to a boy employed in a shop situated near or before the gate of a Buddhist temple. By constantly hearing the s&ucirc;tra chanted in the temple, the boy learns to repeat the words. A proverb of kindred meaning is, <I>Kangaku-In no suzum&eacute; wa, M&ocirc;gy&ucirc; wo say&eacute;zuru:</I> "The sparrows of Kangaku-In [an ancient seat of learning] chirp the M&ocirc;gy&ucirc;,"--a Chinese text formerly taught to young students. The teaching of either proverb is excellently expressed by a third:--<I>Narau yori wa nar&eacute;ro:</I> "Rather than study [an art], get accustomed to it,"--that is to say, "keep constantly in contact with it." Observation and practice are even better than study.</P>
<P>3. Death and Change do not conform their ways to human expectation.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 185}</P>
<P>60.--<I>Neko mo Bussh&ocirc; ari.</P>
</I><P>In even a cat the Buddha-nature exists.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>61.--<I>N&eacute;ta ma ga Gokuraku.</P>
</I><P>The interval of sleep is Paradise.<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>62.--<I>Nijiu-go Bosatsu mo sor&eacute;-sor&eacute; no yaku.</P>
</I><P>Even each of the Twenty-five Bodhisattvas has his own particular duty to perform.</P>
<P>63.--<I>Nin mit&eacute;, h&ocirc; tok&eacute;.</P>
</I><P>[First] see the person, [then] preach the doctrine.<SUP>[3]</SUP></P>
<P>64.--<I>Ninshin uk&eacute;gataku Bupp&ocirc; aigatashi.</P>
</I><P>It is not easy to be born among men, and to meet with [<I>the good fortune of hearing the doctrine of</I>] Buddhism.<SUP>[4]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Notwithstanding the legend that only the cat and the <I>mamushi</I> (a poisonous viper) failed to weep for the death of the Buddha.</P>
<P>2. Only during sleep can we sometimes cease to know the sorrow and pain of this world. (Compare with No. 83.)</P>
<P>3. The teaching of Buddhist doctrine should always be adapted to the intelligence of the person to be instructed. There is another proverb of the same kind,--Ki ni yorit&eacute;, h&ocirc; wo tok&eacute;: "According to the understanding [of the person to be taught], preach the Law."</P>
<P>4 Popular Buddhism teaches that to be born in the {footnote p. 186} world of mankind, and especially among a people professing Buddhism, is a very great privilege. However miserable human existence, it is at least a state in which some knowledge of divine truth may be obtained; whereas the beings in other and lower conditions of life are relatively incapable of spiritual progress.]</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1.

They are not to be confounded with the <I>Ma, Yasha, Kijin</I>, and other classes of evil spirits. In Buddhist art they are represented as beings of enormous strength, with the heads of bulls and of horses. The bull-headed demons are called <I>Go-zu</I>; the horse-headed <I>M&eacute;-zu</I>.</P>
<P>2. Meaning that great power should be given only to the strong.]</P>

</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Meaning that a wicked man usually marries a wicked woman.</P>
<P>2. Said of the parents of crippled or deformed children. But the popular idea here expressed is not altogether in accord with the teachings of the higher Buddhism.</P>
<P>3.

<P>2. Monj&ucirc; Bosatsu [<I>Ma&ntilde;djus'ri Bodhisattva</I>] figures in Japanese Buddhism as a special divinity of wisdom--The proverb signifies that three heads are better than one. A saying. of like meaning is, <I>Hiza to mo dank&ocirc;:</I> "Consult even with your own knee;" that is to say, Despise no advice, no matter how humble the source of it.]</P>

<P>2. Nothing can happen except as a result of eternal and irrevocable law.</P>
<P>3. Bodai is the same word as the Sanscrit <I>Bodhi</I>, signifying the supreme enlightenment,--the knowledge that leads to Buddhahood; but it is often used by Japanese Buddhists in the sense of divine bliss, or the Buddha-state itself.]</P>

<P>3. Said especially in reference to the result of sensual indulgence.</P>
<P>4. That is to say, "As dangerous as for a clay Buddha to play with water." Children often amuse themselves by making little Buddhist images of mud, which melt into shapelessness, of course, if placed in water.]</P>

</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The beauty of the moon is obscured by masses of clouds; the trees no sooner blossom than their flowers are scattered by the wind. All beauty is evanescent.</P>
<P>2. That is, a pious device for effecting conversion, Such a device is justified especially by the famous parable of the third chapter of the <I>Saddharma Pundar&icirc;ka</I>.</P>
<P>8 Meaning that one most reveres the <I>hotok&eacute;</I>--the spirits of the dead regarded as Buddhas--in one's own household-shrine. There is an ironical play upon the word <I>hotok&eacute;</I>, which may mean either a dead person simply, or a Buddha. Perhaps the spirit of this proverb may be better explained by the help of another: <I>Nig&eacute;ta sakana ni</I> {footnote p. 193} <I>chisai wa nai; shinda kodomo ni warui ko wa nai</I>--"fish that escaped was never small; child that died was never bad."]</P>

</I><P>Promised [or, destined] from a former birth.<SUP>[3]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This curious saying is the only one in my collection containing the word <I>Neban</I> (Nirv&acirc;na), and is here inserted chiefly for that reason, The common people seldom speak of <I>Neban</I>, and have little knowledge of those profound doctrines to which the term is related. The above phrase, as might be inferred, is not a popular expression: it is rather an artistic and poetical reference to the aspect of a landscape covered with snow to the horizon-line,--so that beyond the snow-circle there is only the great void of the sky.</P>
<P>2. Not so commonplace a proverb as might appear at first sight; for it refers especially to the Buddhist belief that every kindness shown to us in this life is a return of kindness done to others in a former life, and that every wrong inflicted upon us is the reflex of some injustice which we committed in a previous birth.</P>
<P>3. A very common saying,--often uttered as a comment upon the unhappiness of separation, upon sudden misfortune, {footnote p. 194}upon sudden death, etc. It is used especially in relation to <I>shinj&ucirc;</I>, or lovers' suicide. Such suicide is popularly thought to be a result of cruelty in some previous state of being, or the consequence of having broken, in a former life, the mutual promise to become husband and wife.]</P>
