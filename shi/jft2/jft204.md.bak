### LORD BAG OF RICE

A SOLDIER in Japan was once about to cross a bridge near a lake when he
saw a huge snake coiled on the bridge so that no one could pass. Now, do
you think that this soldier turned and ran away, as many others had that
day? No, indeed! He knew that a bridge was not the place for a snake, so
he walked up and stamped on its head.

As he stepped on him, the snake was gone. Only a dwarf stood before him,
who at once began bowing his head to the ground with respect.

"Now, at last I have found some one who is not a coward!'' cried the
dwarf. "Here I have been waiting for days to find a man who was brave
enough to help me, but none dared cross the bridge. Everyone turned and
ran at the sight of me. But you are strong-hearted. Will you do me a
great kindness and save many lives?"

The soldier answered:

"I am a soldier of the Emperor, and I am here to save life and right
wrong. Tell me your trouble and I will see what can be done to help it."

"There is a terrible centipede," said the dwarf, "and he lives in the
woods on the mountain. Every day he comes down to the shore to drink. He
dips his thousand poisonous feet into the beautiful water, turning it
all foul and dirty. It kills all the fishes in the lake, too. I am the
king of the lake, and I am trying to find some way to save my fishes."

"I do not know that I can help you," said the soldier, ''but I will
gladly go with you and try. "

The dwarf took him to his home in the bottom of the lake. It was a
beautiful house, all made of coral and pearl. His servants, the crabs
and sunfishes, brought them rice, fruit, and tea, served on tiny green
leaves. The tea looked like water and the rice looked like seafoam, but
they tasted all right, so what matter?

Just as they were in the middle of their feast they heard a mighty
roaring and rumbling. It sounded as though a mountain were being torn
up.

''There he is!" he cried. "That is the noise of his thousand feet as
they crunch on the stones of the mountain side. We must hurry or he will
get to the water and poison it again. "

They hurried to the edge of the lake and saw the centipede already very
near. He looked. like an army marching with colored lanterns, for each
one of his thousand legs glowed with many beautiful shades of crimson
and green and gold.

The soldier drew his great bow and let an arrow fly at the monster's
head. He never missed his aim, and the arrow struck the ugly head of the
centipede, but bounced away. A second arrow flew, but that, too, bounced
away.

He had but one arrow left and the monster was almost at the water's
edge.

Suddenly he remembered that when he was a boy his grandfather had told
him that if you wet the head of an arrow in your mouth it will kill any
monster.

It took just a second to wet the head of his last precious arrow and
send it whizzing at the centipede. It struck him on the forehead and he
fell over dead.

Suddenly the soldier found himself back in his own house, which was now
changed into a castle. Before him were five gifts, on each of which he
read, ''With the loving thanks of the Dwarf."

The first of these gifts was a huge bronze bell, on the outside of which
was told in pictures the story of the centipede. The second was a sword
which would always give its owner the victory. The third was a suit of
armor so strong that no swords or arrows could go through it.

The last two were the most wonderful of all. One was a roll of silk of
any color he wished, and the more he used of the silk the more the roll
grew. The other was a bag of rice which never grew less, although he
used all he wished for his friends and himself.

This last gift seemed so wonderful to the people that they called him
Lord Bag of Rice from that day.
