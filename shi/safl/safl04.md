|      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\.  | Okikurumi<span id="page_124_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_124_note_1) and Samai<span id="page_124_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_124_note_2.md) came to harpoon the sword-fish.                    |
| 2\.  | And we waited for them at the fishing place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3\.  | When they came they effectually harpooned a large fish.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4\.  | From this point the fish went from one end of the sea to the other, taking the boat with it.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5\.  | Now Samai collapsed for want of strength.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6\.  | Upon this Okikurumi put forth all his strength <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> and wrought with the grunt of a young man.                                                                                                                                  |
| 7\.  | Then there arose upon the palms and back of his hands two blood-stained blisters.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 8\.  | And with temper depicted upon his countenance Okikurumi said:—                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 9\.  | Oh, this bad sword-fish, as you are doing this I will cut the harpoon-line.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 10\. | And because upon the harpoon head there is metal, you shall greatly suffer from the noise of striking iron and grinding bones in your stomach;                                                                                                               |
| 11\. | Because the line is made of hemp, a plain of hemp shall grow out of thee;                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 12\. | Because the rope is made of *Nipesh*<span id="page_125_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_125_note_3.md), a *Nipesh* forest shall grow from <span id="page_126">p. 126</span> thy back;                                               |
| 13\. | And when you die you shall be cast into the mouth of the Shishirimuka<span id="page_126_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_126_note_4.md) river, and crows and many kinds of dogs shall congregate upon thee and defile thee.         |
| 14\. | Now, though the sword-fish said it understood, and thought it was Ainu that was spoken, yet it secretly laughed and went its way.                                                                                                                            |
| 15\. | But before it had gone any great distance, mighty pains seized it, and in its stomach was heard the sound of striking iron and of grinding bones.                                                                                                            |
| 16\. | And plains of hemp and forests of *Nipesh* and *Shiuri*<span id="page_126_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_126_note_5.md) sprouting forth from its body, it was cast ashore in a dying <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> condition. |
| 17\. | Then the dogs and crows congregated upon it and defiled it.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 18\. | Upon this Okikurumi came down from the mountains and said:—                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 19\. | Oh! you bad sword-fish, it is by your own fault and for your own doings that you are thus punished.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 20\. | Your lower jaw shall be used in the outhouse, and your upper one shall be sunk with a stone, and you must die a very hard and painful death.                                                                                                                 |
| 21\. | Do not treat this Ainu tale of the sword-fish slightingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

 

   The object of this tradition appears to be threefold.

   First to preserve and hand down to posterity the fact that Yoshitsune
and Benkei once resided among the Ainu race and taught the people how to
catch the larger kinds of fish. That these two persons really came to
Yezo (and there can be but little doubt as to their having gone to
Saghalien also) and dwelt <span id="page_128">p. 128</span> at Saru for
a time seems almost indisputable, but what eventually became of them we
are unable to determine, at least from what Ainu traditions have
hitherto been obtained. We may perhaps learn more in time.

   The second object of this tradition is to teach people not to despise
a new-comer or stranger, but rather to see what he can do and what
useful things may be learned from him, e.g., the tradition says:—*Ru
etok oroge chiaiwakte okai ash awa*, "and we waited for them at the
fishing place." The Ainu interpret this by saying that the ancients took
their boats and went to the point where the fishing was to commence, and
waited for the appearance of Yoshitsune and Benkei. Their motive,
however, was to see beforehand where the best fish might be caught and
to return more successful than their Japanese friends. They did not so
much desire to learn from them as to parade their own skill. But it
turned out that the Ainu caught no fish, whilst Yoshitsune secured the
very king of the sword-fish!

   In the third place this tradition teaches the Ainu not to forget the
exceeding great power of Yoshitsune. Though Benkei dropped down in the
boat through sheer exhaustion, and the harpoon line had to be cut, yet
Yoshitsune turned out to be the conqueror. He cursed the fish with a
mighty curse. Forests of trees and plains of hemp were to grow from its
body and its interior was to resound again with the noise of iron
striking together and of grinding bones. It was to die a hard and
painful death, be cast into the mouth of the Saru river and be horribly
defiled by crows and dogs. Such was the curse, and so indeed, say the
Ainu, did all surely come to pass. The tradition finishes up with a
caution, not to treat this Ainu tale in a slighting manner.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_124">p. 124</span>

<span id="page_124_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_124_fr_*.md) *Tusunabanu* is
the name of the tune or voice in which this legend is recited.

<span id="page_124_note_1"></span>[1](#page_124_fr_1.md) *Okikurumi* is the
Ainu name of the Japanese hero Kurohonguwan Minamoto no Yoshitsune, who
was driven to Yezo by his younger brother in the 12th century of our
era, and who is said by the Ainu to have taught their ancestors the arts
of hunting and fishing.

<span id="page_124_note_2"></span>[2](#page_124_fr_2.md) *Samai un guru*
stands for *Benkei*, who was the servant and retainer of Yoshitsune, and
who is said to have accompanied him to Yezo. *Samai un guru* merely
means "a Japanese" *Samai* being short for *Samoro*, which is the Ainu
name for "Japan," e.g. *Samoro kotan*, " Japan," *Samoro un guru* or
*Samai un guru*, "a Japanese." Here I may add, the name of the famous
volcanic mountain, the *Fuji Yama* of the Japanese, is possibly none
other than a corruption of the Ainu name *Huchi Kamui*, who is supposed
to be the goddess of fire.

<span id="footnotes_page_125">p. 125</span>

<span id="page_125_note_3"></span>[3](#page_125_fr_3.md) *Nipesh* is the
name of the tree with the bark of which the Ainu make their fishing
ropes. It is called in Japanese *Shina no ki*.

<span id="footnotes_page_126">p. 126</span>

<span id="page_126_note_4"></span>[4](#page_126_fr_4.md) *Shishiri-muka* is
the name of the Saru river.

<span id="page_126_note_5"></span>[5](#page_126_fr_5.md) *Shiuri*. This is
the name of the wood out of which harpoon shafts are made. The Japanese
of Yezo call this wood *Nigaki*.
