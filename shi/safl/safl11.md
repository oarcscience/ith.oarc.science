## XI.—WHY THERE ARE SNAKES IN AINU-LAND, <span class="small">AND</span> WHY THEY SWALLOW FROGS.

   The following is a tale of ancient times:—

   The snake said, "I cannot stay in this country for there is no food;
I will, therefore, migrate to a foreign land."

   Thereupon the frog replied:—

   "There is no necessity for you to go away." Upon this the snake
asked, "Why do you say so?" The frog answered: "If in staying in this
country you find you cannot obtain sufficient food, you will, if you
swallow one of my legs, be fully satisfied; <span id="page_226">p.
226</span> there is therefore no necessity for you to go away." And so
the snake did not migrate but stayed in the land; and now, whenever it
sees a frog it always has a great desire to swallow it."
