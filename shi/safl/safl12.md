## XII.—WHY WESTERN YEZO IS SO ROUGH AND DANGEROUS.

   "This is the way in which the maker of places is said have created
the world.<span id="page_226_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

   He and his younger sister made it between them; the sister's portion
was the Western part of Yezo while the male deity made the Eastern part,
and, it is said, they vied with each other in their work. Now, as the
younger sister was but a woman, she, happening to fall in with the
younger sister of the Divine Oina, instead of doing her work stopped to
chatter. While this was going on the male deity came near completing
<span id="page_227">p. 227</span> his portion of the task; seeing this,
she, being surprised, made the Western part after the slovenly manner it
now is. It was therefore because she did her work in too great a hurry
that it was done so exceedingly badly; and hence it is that the Western
part of Yezo has so many dangerous places about it. So runs the tale."
