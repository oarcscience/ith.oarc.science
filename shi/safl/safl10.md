## X.—THE LEGEND OF HOW THE YOUNGER SISTER OF THE WOLF-GOD WAS GIVEN TO ME (*to wife*.)

   I was brought up by my elder sister and always remained at home. I
was reared in this wise:—

   The iron<span id="page_216_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_216_note_1.md) and wooden beams (*of
our house*) were painted in diverse colours. Upon the iron beams were
placed<span id="page_216_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_216_note_2.md) pictures of swords <span
id="page_217">p. 217</span> and spears. By night these pictures of
swords and spears became living gods<span
id="page_217_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_217_note_3.md) and flashed about
blindingly.<span id="page_217_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_217_note_4.md) The brightness of these
tools and sharp instruments lit up the inside of the house during the
darkness.

   Whilst things were in this state it was said that, the inhabitants of
Kunashiri and Shumashiri<span id="page_217_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_217_note_5.md) were beyond measure
brave, and pursued war as a profession. I was so angry at this that I
was unable to sleep.

   On a certain occasion my elder sister cooked two days'<span
id="page_217_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_217_note_6.md) food.

   After this she covered me up with the bed clothes<span
id="page_217_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_217_note_7.md) <span id="page_218">p.
218</span> and, when I judged her to be fast asleep, I arose and girded
on my sword.

   I then set out for Kunashiri and Shumashiri.

   As I went along a pretty little water-way opened up (*before me*). So
I came to the river's mouth, and, a little mountain<span
id="page_218_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_218_note_8) like fog was (*I saw*.md)
sitting upon a log of wood which had been cast up by the waves of the
sea.

   I went up to it; and this is what I saw:—An Ainu woman dressed in
white clothing. The little woman looked as though she had come with a
message; nevertheless I spake thus her:—"Look here, I am a person so
brave that I cut down fast speakers ere they have finished talking, and
slow talkers at the beginning of their speech. (*So*) speak quickly."

   As I spake the little woman trembled exceedingly;<span
id="page_218_fr_9"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">9</span></sup>](#page_218_note_9.md) and, <span
id="page_219">p. 219</span> chewing the sleeve of her dress (*as in
fear*) spake as follows:—"At the source of this little river I have a
blood-relation<span id="page_219_fr_10"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">10</span></sup>](#page_219_note_10.md)—the Wolf-god. I am his
younger sister and have been sent to say this:—The inhabitants of
Kunashiri and Shumashiri are men so brave that neither gods nor men dare
approach them, (*so that*) if even you go there, and alone, it will be
bad (*for you*). My younger sister is a poor worthless creature,<span
id="page_219_fr_11"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">11</span></sup>](#page_219_note_11.md) but I will make up for
that by giving you some presents with her. So now return from here; it
was to say these things (*to you*) that my elder brother sent me here."
So spake she. I was angry at this and therefore struck her fiercely with
my sword. I killed her whilst she was rising. Her soul departed with a
great sound; but Lo, the shadow of a man appeared at my side; it was,
<span id="page_220">p. 220</span> without doubt, the aforesaid Wolf-god.
He had anger depicted upon his countenance. Now this is what he
said:—"It is ridiculous of you, my young Ainu brother, to get angry in
this way. What was there improper in the speech I sent my younger sister
to deliver to you that made you slay her so suddenly? If it is death
that you are seeking, I will slay you as quickly as you slew her."

   When he had so spoken he set upon me with his sword, but as I had no
wish to be killed outright I turned myself into wind<span
id="page_220_fr_12"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">12</span></sup>](#page_220_note_12.md) and jumped above his
sword-sweep. I (*then*) attacked him as he had done me. I cut him down
as he was rising up. His soul departed with a great sound, he became a
new man<span id="page_220_fr_13"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">13</span></sup>](#page_220_note_13.md) and went round the
mountains towards the source of the little river. <span id="page_221">p.
221</span> After this there was peace. When this was over, I walked fast
till I arrived at Kunashiri and Shumashiri.

   After this, having arrived at Kunashiri I stirred up a grievous war
from one end of the land to the other. And, as I was carrying on this
war single-handed, both day I and night, I found that my clothes (*were
torn so much that*) nothing but the front of my garment hung from my
arms. By and by there arose over the distant mountain tops, such a
mighty wind<span id="page_221_fr_14"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">14</span></sup>](#page_221_note_14.md) and shadow, and above
all, there was the sound of the approach of a great company of the gods.
Yea, they came to the place where I was fighting. On seeing the gods fly
before the great wind (*I recognised them as being*) the spears and
swords which were placed upon the iron beams of our house; they had
become living gods. When they came, the war with the people of Kunashiri
and Shumashiri was as nothing, for in a moment their country <span
id="page_222">p. 222</span> was completely laid waste. When this was
over, the spears and swords rose up in the air and departed in the same
manner as they had come, before a mighty wind.

   And so I returned home. When going along there appeared a great host
of gods riding upon a mighty wind. Hovering over me a voice from a god
came forth, which said: "Look here, my lad, I have something to say, so
pay attention. As for me I am that Poiyaumbe.<span
id="page_222_fr_15"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">15</span></sup>](#page_222_note_15.md) I left my home at
Shinutapka in wrath because there was nothing but war in the land. And,
as I was coming along I heard the voice of a lad crying among the
stones; I went therefore to see what it was and found it to be a little
lad weeping. Now, Okikurumi<span id="page_222_fr_16"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">16</span></sup>](#page_222_note_16.md) was the governor of
<span id="page_223">p. 223</span> the middle of Ainu-land; and (*once
upon a time*) the devils made war against him with one accord and slew
every one of his<span id="page_223_fr_17"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">17</span></sup>](#page_223_note_17.md) men, for the devils
were numerous. The wife of Okikurumi took her child upon her back and
came to avenge the death of her husband, but she was slain. You were
that little child which she took and wrapped up in a garment and put
among the stones. As we much desired to avenge you we brought you up in
our home; and after our elder sister had reared you and the younger
sister of the Wolf-god had come to you, it was settled that you were to
govern the middle of Ainu-land. And now without cause you have warred
against Kunashiri and Shumashiri, but above all, what evil had the
Wolf-god and his sister done that you should have so quickly killed
<span id="page_224">p. 224</span> them? I am angry with you for this and
therefore your sister has been led away into captivity, yea, she is even
now being taken away. However, these swords and spears, some of which
are of your age and some of which are your elders, are your friends and
relations."<span id="page_224_fr_18"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">18</span></sup>](#page_224_note_18.md) So spake the voice
which came down from the gods.

   Then again I, was angry, and, weeping very bitterly, called after my
sister. While weeping I thought to myself—"however much you weep it will
not bring your sister to you"—so I wiped my face. On arriving at my home
I found that my sister and all her furniture and ornaments had, in
truth, entirely disappeared. After this I lived alone. Now, one day, I
was much surprised to hear people outside. It was the Wolf-god and his
sister whom I had killed that were coming; they were bringing a very
large bundle<span id="page_224_fr_19"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">19</span></sup>](#page_224_note_19.md) with <span
id="page_225">p. 225</span> them. After this they stayed as servants;
then the pictures of spears and swords came to life at night and did
nothing but exercise and talk together of old times. I then married the
younger sister of the Wolf-god and we live together.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_216">p. 216</span>

<span id="page_216_note_1"></span>[1](#page_216_fr_1.md) The word here
translated "iron" is, in the original, *kane*; by some Ainus also
pronounced *kani*. It is doubtful whether *kane* would not be better
rendered by the word "beautiful" than by "iron;" thus we should
read,—"the beautiful wooden beams," &c., ([*see Legend VI Vol. XVI.,
Part II. note on verses 1 and 2.*](safl06.htm#notes).md)

<span id="page_216_note_2"></span>[2](#page_216_fr_2.md) "Placed."
*Charuwatore* really means "to be placed in order;" "to be set in
rotation." Hence it is doubtful whether the "spears" and "swords" here
spoken of were not real rather than mere pictures or paintings, and were
carefully placed in order upon the beams as may sometimes be seen in
some few Ainu huts to-day.

<span id="footnotes_page_217">p. 217</span>

<span id="page_217_note_3"></span>[3](#page_217_fr_3.md) "Became living
gods." Probably some secret drill was carried on by night with a view to
future war.

<span id="page_217_note_4"></span>[4](#page_217_fr_4.md) "Flashed about
blindingly." *Arutam* is suid by the Ainus to mean a "flash" like a
"flash" of lightning. *Kochupuchupu* means "to blink the eyes at." The
flashes were here caused by the spears and swords knocking together when
at drill.

<span id="page_217_note_5"></span>[5](#page_217_fr_5.md) *Kunashiri* and
*Shumashiri* are Islands to the Northeast of Ezo.

<span id="page_217_note_6"></span>[6](#page_217_fr_6.md) "Two days' food."
A poetical way of saying "much food," or "a large quantity of food."

<span id="page_217_note_7"></span>[7](#page_217_fr_7.md) "Bed clothes;"
Ainu *hotke kosonde*. *Kosonde* appears to be the Japanese word
*kosode*, a wadded silk garment, and *hotke* is "to lie down to sleep;"
hence *hotke kosonde*, "sleeping clothes" or "bed clothes." None but a
"well to do" Ainu could have a *kosonde*, and most likely the word is
here used to show that our hero was a chief of the people. The Ainus,
however, mainttain that *kosonde* is a real word whatever *kosode* may
be.

<span id="footnotes_page_218">p. 218</span>

<span id="page_218_note_8"></span>[8](#page_218_fr_8.md) "Mountain like
fog." *Urat* or *urara* is "fog," and *tapkop* a single, solitary
mountain or hill; or a mountain standing quite alone. The "fog" which
looked like a "little mountain" turned out to be an Ainu woman, as will
be seen hereafter.

<span id="page_218_note_9"></span>[9](#page_218_fr_9.md) "Trembled
exceedingly." The Ainu words are *hottoro kata kotususatki*, lit: "she
trembled upon her fore-head." This is a phrase used to express great
fear; her forehead shook through fear.

<span id="footnotes_page_219">p. 219</span>

<span id="page_219_note_10"></span>[10](#page_219_fr_10.md) "Blood
relation." *Iriwak* are one's own blood-relations, while distant
relations are called *iritak*.

<span id="page_219_note_11"></span>[11](#page_219_fr_11.md) "Poor,
worthless creature." *Shirikasak* means, "destitute;" "poor;"
"worthless;" "ugly." The Wolf-god meant to say that his sister was
utterly unworthy of the hand of our hero. However, he would make up for
that by giving a large dowry or marriage portion with her. It was
customary among to Ainus to give some dowry with a bride when she got
married.

<span id="footnotes_page_220">p. 220</span>

<span id="page_220_note_12"></span>[12](#page_220_fr_12.md) *Peken' rera
ne* is "became bright wind." Though the Ainus say that their ancestors
had power themselves invisible by turning into air, yet all our hero
intends to say here is that he made haste to escape the sword sweep
aimed at him.

<span id="page_220_note_13"></span>[13](#page_220_fr_13.md) "Became a new
man." *Pito* is often used in Ainu legends and seems to be from the
Japanese word *hito*, "man." The Wolf-god's spirit having been released
from the body was renewed, and went off beyond the mountains. The
victory belonged to the Ainu.

<span id="footnotes_page_221">p. 221</span>

<span id="page_221_note_14"></span>[14](#page_221_fr_14.md) "A mighty
wind." *Kamui man*, lit.: a wind of god.

<span id="footnotes_page_222">p. 222</span>

<span id="page_222_note_15"></span>[15](#page_222_fr_15.md) *Poiyaumbe*,
"Brave Ainu." The speaker here makes known to one hero that he is a well
known person—in fact—a brave man whose fame has spread far and wide. No
further introduction was needed than "that Poiyaumbe." \[See Trans: Vol.
XVI. Pt. ii, Page 147 Note 1\].

<span id="page_222_note_16"></span>[16](#page_222_fr_16.md) Okikurumi is
the Ainu name for *Kurōhangwan Minamoto no Yoshitsune*, who was driven
to Yezo by his younger brother in the 12th century of our era, and who
is said by the Ainus to have taught their ancestors the arts of fishing
and hunting.

<span id="footnotes_page_223">p. 223</span>

<span id="page_223_note_17"></span>[17](#page_223_fr_17.md) We learn from
this legend that Yoshitsune was slain while fighting. Who the "devils"
were that slew him is not stated, but I have been told privately that he
was killed in Karafto by the Karafto Ainus in one of their feuds with
the inhabitants of Yezo. Yoshitsune, it is here stated, left one son. He
also, we are told, was afterwards killed in battle.

<span id="footnotes_page_224">p. 224</span>

<span id="page_224_note_18"></span>[18](#page_224_fr_18.md) "Relations." It
is here clearly stated that the spears and swords which have hitherto
been spoken of as having been painted on the beams of the hut, were, in
reality, living men, or warriors.

<span id="page_224_note_19"></span>[19](#page_224_fr_19.md) "Large bundle."
The marriage portion spoken of above.
