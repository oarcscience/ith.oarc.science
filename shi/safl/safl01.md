## I.—AN AINU LEGEND OF A FAMINE.

I<span class="small">NUSA</span>-I<span class="small">NUSA</span>.<span
id="page_112_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_112_note_*.md)

1\.

There was a woman who was ever sitting by the window and doing some kind
of needle-work or other;

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

2\.

In the window<span id="fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#note_1.md) of the house there was a large
cup filled to the brim with wine, upon which floated a ceremonial
moustache-lifter.<span id="fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#note_2.md)

3\.

The ceremonial moustache-lifter was dancing<span
id="fr_3"></span>[<sup><span class="small">3</span></sup>](#note_3.md)
about upon the top of the winecup.

4\.

In explaining the subject from the beginning, and setting it forth from
the end, the tale runs thus:—

5\.

Now look, do you think that the great God, do you think that the true
God was blind?

6\.

In Ainu land there was a great famine, and the Ainu were dying from want
of food; yet with what little rice-malt and with what little millet they
had they made (a cup of) wine.

7\.

Now, the great God had mercy, and, in order that our relatives might
eat, produced both deer and fish.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

8\.

And the great God had mercy upon us, therefore He looked upon us and, in
truth, saw that in Ainu-land there was a famine and that the Ainu had
nothing to eat.

9\.

Then was that cup of wine emptied into six<span
id="fr_4"></span>[<sup><span class="small">4</span></sup>](#note_4.md)
lacquer-ware<span id="fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#note_5.md) vessels.

10\.

In a very little while the scent of the wine filled the whole house.

11\.

Therefore were all the gods led<span id="fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#note_6.md) in, and the gods of places were
brought from everywhere;

12\.

And they were all well pleased with that delicious wine.

13\.

Then the goddesses<span id="fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#note_7.md) of the rivers and the goddesses
of the mouths of rivers danced back and forth in the house.

14\.

Upon this all the gods <span id="page_115">p. 115</span> laughed with
smiles upon their faces;

15\.

And whilst they looked at the goddesses, they saw them pluck out two
hairs from a deer;

16\.

And, as it were, blow them over the tops of the mountains; then appeared
two herds of deer skipping upon the mountain tops, one of bucks and the
other of does.

17\.

Then they plucked out two scales from a fish, and, as it were, blew them
over the rivers, and the beds of the rivers were so crowded with fish
that they scraped upon the stones, and the tops of the rivers were so
full that the fish stood out like the porches of houses and were dried
up by the sun.

18\.

So the things called fish filled all the rivers to the brim.

19\.

Then the Ainu went fishing and caused their <span id="page_116">p.
116</span> boats to dance upon the rivers.

20\.

The young men now found fish and venison in rich abundance.

21\.

Hence it is that Ainu-land is so good. Hence it is that from ancient
times till now there has been hunting. Hence it is that there are
inheritors to this hunting.

 

<span class="small"><span id="notes"></span></span>

 

N<span class="small">OTE ON</span> V<span class="small">ERSE</span> 2.

   <span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1.md) This *puyara* or window is always
placed in the east end of a hut. It is the sacred window, and no person
may look into a hut through it without incurring the penalty of great
displeasure from the owner thereof. The Ainu often worship towards the
sun rising through it, and always, in their libations, three drops of
wine are thrown towards it. Outside of this window there are always
clusters of whittled willow sticks, called *inao* or *nusa*, to be seen.

   These are placed there as offerings to the gods, as a sign to them of
the devoutness of the worshipper. Besides these willow offerings, one
may often see long poles stuck into the earth having the skulls of bears
or deer placed upon them as a sign of thankfulness for success in the
hunt. This window, then, being so sacred and, in a sense, the peculiar
property of the gods, we may easily understand why a large, well filled
cup of wine was placed before it. It was an offering, and was placed
there to solicit the favour of the gods.

   <span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2.md) The ceremonial moustache-lifters
are peculiarly made, and are used for special religious purposes. They
are of different patterns. Some have bears and some have deer carved
upon them. The present one, however, is called *Kikeush bashui*, i.e., a
moustache-lifter with shavings left upon the top of it. It is especially
used at worship when supplications are made for any particular benefits.
Those which have animals carved upon them are generally used when thanks
are made to the gods, whilst a common moustache-lifter, having no
particular carving upon it, is used on general occasions, as for
instance, when some news of any kind is being made known, or when a
friend or relative makes a call.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

   The use of these moustache-lifters is peculiar. The *raison d'être*
seems to be: *First*, to keep the moustache out of the wine, and
*secondly*, to offer drops of drink to the gods with. Three drops must
be given to the fire goddess, three thrown towards the east window,
three towards the north-east corner of the hut where the Ainu treasures
are kept, and then three drops must be offered to any special god for
whose benefit libations are offered or to whom the Ainu are paying
worship.

   Wine enters very largely into the religious worship of the Ainu, and
they often make religion a pretext for getting intoxicated. It has
occurrcd to me that perhaps this legend of the famine is kept alive only
in order to show how good a thing it is to make wine and how
well-pleasing to the gods it is to offer libations to them. It was the
smell of the wine which drew the gods together, it was wine which
pleased the goddesses and made them dance, it was wine again which
caused the male gods to smile; in short, it was all owing to this one
large cup of wine that food was brought to the Ainu and that there are
any of them alive now. It was the wine which even caused the
moustache-lifter to float about and dance upon the top of the cup! What
a sight is a full cup of wine to an Ainu! How quickly his eyes sparkle
and dance with delight when he sees it! The very sound of the word
*sake* or *tonoto* makes him smack his lips.

 

N<span class="small">OTE ON</span> V<span class="small">ERSE</span> 3.

   <span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3.md) The word *tereke-tereke*, which I
have here translated by "dancing about," really means to "jump," "skip,"
or "hop about." Here two ideas are introduced:—*First* the cup was so
full of wine that the very moustache-lifter could float upon it without
touching the brim; *secondly* the moustache-lifter was so pleased that
it could not contain itself, but must needs skip, jump, hop or dance
about with delight! So good and pwerful was the wine.

 

N<span class="small">OTE ON</span> V<span class="small">ERSE</span> 4.

   This is merely an Ainu idiom and expresses the idea that this
particular subject should be thoroughly explained and set forth.

 

N<span class="small">OTE ON</span> V<span class="small">ERSE</span> 5.

   The idea contained in these lines seems to be this:—Though the Aiuu
were in such straits, yet it was not without the knowledge of the gods;
and it was not possible that they should neglect this large cup of
delicious wine which was placed in the window for their special
delectation. It was made and placed there in order to get the gods
together that they might talk over this mighty famine, to put them into
a good temper and cause them to help the Ainu in this their sad
calamity. No! the gods were not blind.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

 

N<span class="small">OTE ON</span> V<span class="small">ERSE</span> 6.

   Though food was so very scarce, yet what little rice or millet the
Ainu had they gave it up to the gods. They made a little choice wine as
an offering and presented it to them. Hence may be seen the devoutness
of the ancients. The result was as is stated in the 7th verse; fish and
venison were caused to abound! The prayer was heard and answered.

 

N<span class="small">OTE ON</span> V<span class="small">ERSE</span> 9.

   <span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4.md) Six appears to be the sacred or
perfect number of the Ainu; hence, a little of the wine was put into
each of the six lacquer-ware vessels.

   <span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5.md) These lacquer-ware vessels are of
Japanese make and are highly prized by the Ainu. In fact, they look upon
them as special treasures, and the importance of a man is measured by
the number of these vessels in his possession, and by the number of old
swords he has. It is said that, in ancient times, the Japanese rulers
used to sell these vessels to the Ainu, well filled with *sake*, of
course, for fish and the skins of animals. Money was never paid for
these things. Hence, at a drinking ceremony the very best lacquer-ware
vessels are produced; the wine is poured into them and then ladled out
into wine-cups, and handed round. Strange to say, the women are allowed
to come in and sit behind their husbands and drink, if anything is
handed to them, though they must never take part in the prayers. The
women, however, get very little wine indeed! Wine was made for gods and
men, not for women. The mistress in whose house the libations are
offered is allowed to produce a bottle—not a large one, to be sure, but
still a bottle—which is filled and kept for her private use! The lucky
woman generally hides this bottle, lest her loving husband should steal
it and relieve her of the contents thereof!

 

N<span class="small">OTE ON</span> V<span class="small">ERSE</span> 11.

   <span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6.md) The work *ashke auk*, which I
have here translated by "led in," really means "to be led in by the
hand." The Ainu have a very curious custom of taking persons by the hand
and leading them into the house; it is a sign of great honour to be so
led. It is considered to be the height of disrespect to enter an Ainu
hut without first giving warning of one's presence; but as there are no
doors on the huts, a caller thus being unable to knock before entering,
he must wait outside and cough or make a noise with his throat til some
one comes out and either asks him to walk in or takes him by the hand
and leads him to a seat by the fire. Thus, out of great respect, the
gods were led into the hut by the hand.

   <span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7.md) *Petru-ush mat* is the goddess of
rivers from their source to their outlet, and *Chiwashekot mat* presides
over their mouths.
