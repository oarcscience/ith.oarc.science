<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this tradition appears to be threefold.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First to preserve and hand down to posterity the fact that Yoshitsune and Benkei once resided among the Ainu race and taught the people how to catch the larger kinds of fish. That these two persons really came to Yezo (and there can be but little doubt as to their having gone to Saghalien also) and dwelt

<!------------------------page 128------------------------>

<A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A>

at Saru for a time seems almost indisputable, but what eventually became of them we are unable to determine, at least from what Ainu traditions have hitherto been obtained. We may perhaps learn more in time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second object of this tradition is to teach people not to despise a new-comer or stranger, but rather to see what he can do and what useful things may be learned from him, e.g., the tradition says:&#8212;<I>Ru etok oroge chiaiwakte okai ash awa</I>, "and we waited for them at the fishing place." The Ainu interpret this by saying that the ancients took their boats and went to the point where the fishing was to commence, and waited for the appearance of Yoshitsune and Benkei. Their motive, however, was to see beforehand where the best fish might be caught and to return more successful than their Japanese friends. They did not so much desire to learn from them as to parade their own skill. But it turned out that the Ainu caught no fish, whilst Yoshitsune secured the very king of the sword-fish!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third place this tradition teaches the Ainu not to forget the exceeding great power of Yoshitsune. Though Benkei dropped down in the boat through sheer exhaustion, and the harpoon line had to be cut, yet Yoshitsune turned out to be the conqueror. He cursed the fish with a mighty curse. Forests of trees and plains of hemp were to grow from its body and its interior was to resound again with the noise of iron striking together and of grinding bones. It was to die a hard and painful death, be cast into the mouth of the Saru river and be horribly defiled by crows and dogs. Such was the curse, and so indeed, say the Ainu, did all surely come to pass. The tradition finishes up with a caution, not to treat this Ainu tale in a slighting manner.</P>

Here I may add, the name of the famous volcanic mountain, the <I>Fuji Yama</I> of the Japanese, is possibly none other than a corruption of the Ainu name <I>Huchi Kamui</I>, who is supposed to be the goddess of fire.</P>
