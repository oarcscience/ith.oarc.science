## VIII.—THE LEGEND OF THE LADY OF KUNNEPET. (A LEGEND OF LOVE AND WAR.)

   There was a person who was reared as a slave<span
id="page_25_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_25_note_1.md) at <span id="page_26">p.
26</span> Shinutapka.<span id="page_26_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_26_note_2.md) Now, once upon a time he
heard it noised abroad that there was a lady residing at Kunnepet<span
id="page_26_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_26_note_3.md) who was famous for her
beauty. So, one day, after he had cooked and eaten some food, our slave
buckled on his belt,<span id="page_26_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_26_note_4.md) stuck his trusty sword
into his girdle, and fastened on his helmet; then, being taken up by the
winds which arose from the head of the fireplace,<span
id="page_26_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_26_note_5.md) he was hastily carried
through the upper window;<span id="page_26_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_26_note_6.md) and his <span
id="page_27">p. 27</span> inspiring<span
id="page_27_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_27_note_7.md) guardian god having
rested upon him with a sound, he went before the mighty winds<span
id="page_27_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_27_note_8.md) till he arrived at the
village of Kunnepet.

   So he came to the lady of *Kunnepet*. When he looked at her he saw
that she was weeping<span id="page_27_fr_9"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">9</span></sup>](#page_27_note_9.md) very exceedingly. <span
id="page_28">p. 28</span> Still shedding tears, she spake and said:—"The
thunder-gods who live in the heavens above are two in number,<span
id="page_28_fr_10"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">10</span></sup>](#page_28_note_10.md) and the younger of them
does nothing but make advances to me and is about to marry me. This
being so, O *Poiyaumbe*,<span id="page_28_fr_11"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">11</span></sup>](#page_28_note_11.md) we cannot marry though
you have come for me; nevertheless I will cook<span
id="page_28_fr_12"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">12</span></sup>](#page_28_note_12.md) some food that you may
eat." When she had so said she swung a pretty little pot over the fire
and put some of her choice treasured-up food into it. She then dipped in
her ladle and stirred up the delicious food. Next she took a pretty
eating cup and set it upon a beautiful tray; then, heaping it up high,
carried it to him and bowed profusely.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

   When he had but just commenced to eat, flashes of white<span
id="page_29_fr_13"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">13</span></sup>](#page_29_note_13.md) lightning came through
the upper window and hung upon the beams in curious forms. Upon looking
up he saw a lady even more beautiful than the lady of Kunnepet,
reclining in a white chariot.<span id="page_29_fr_14"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">14</span></sup>](#page_29_note_14.md) She had anger depicted
upon her countenance; and, in her wrath said:—"O Poiyaumbe listen to me
for I have something to say. I am the younger sister of the wolf-god and
the benefactress of the lady of Kunnepet, whilst you are watched over by
my elder brother.<span id="page_29_fr_15"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">15</span></sup>](#page_29_note_15.md) This being so, I am
here to tell you that the thunder-god is angry with you for coming to
visit this lady and is going to make grievous war against you. Nay, the
war is at <span id="page_30">p. 30</span> hand. Though I am a
worthless<span id="page_30_fr_16"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">16</span></sup>](#page_30_note_16.md) woman, I have come to
assist you. Get into my white chariot;" so spake the younger sister of
the wolf-god.

   So he got into the chariot, which immediately went out of the upper
window. Then the trappings<span id="page_30_fr_17"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">17</span></sup>](#page_30_note_17.md) of the chariot whistled
and rattled. As they went on their way, they skirted the mountains
towards the source of the river, and, proceeding along, they saw white
and black lightning playing about in the clouds of the lower<span
id="page_30_fr_18"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">18</span></sup>](#page_30_note_18.md) heavens. As he was
looking at it, he saw the aforementioned thunder-god sitting in a black
chariot; he was unmistakably a very little man. There too sat a little
woman, who, without doubt, was his younger sister. She held a wand in
her hand; with <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> which she continually
struck first one end of the chariot and then the other, as they hung and
waved about over the tops of the mountains.

   The thunder-god, having anger expressed upon his countenance,
said:—"Look here, O Poiyaumbe, listen well to me for I have something to
say. You have been paying your addresses to and flirting with the lady
of *Kunnepet*, whom I have determined to take to myself as wife. I take
this as a cause for war. Be very careful, my fine fellow, for I will
bring down your haughty looks." When he had so spoken, he set upon him
mightily with his sword; so that his blows rattled upon the sides of the
white chariot. Upon this Poiyaumbe also drew his sword and set upon the
thunder-god as determinately as he was attacked by him. So they fought
with might and main, but the black chariot rose and fell to meet the
attack. So that the blows of the sword upon its sides and floor sent
forth a clashing sound.

   And now there was a tremendous roaring sound of <span id="page_32">p.
32</span> thunder over the world, together with a mighty wind blowing;
and both day and night they did nothing but fight. After the war had
raged for twice ten months, the god of thunder said:—

   "I observe that as we fight upon this land in which men dwell, we are
wasting and wearing out the country, for, as you see, its foundations
(back-bones) consist of rocks; we ought to be more careful of the world.
Now then, come, the foundations (backbones) of the world above are made
of iron, let us go up there and fight; for there we may wage war without
having any regard to the spoilation of the place." So spake he.

   He then withdrew into the air and I followed close behind him. The
younger sister of the wolf-god, having the wand in her hand, continued
to strike first one end and then the other of the chariot. The thin
trappings whistled and the thick trappings rattled, as the white chariot
followed close upon the black one. The gates of heaven opened with a
sound, and, having passed through, were shut upon us with another <span
id="page_33">p. 33</span> noise. Now, what we saw was on this wise. A
splendid country lay before us and a very beautiful waterway opened up
to our view. On the sides of the river were forests of magificient oaks,
and the clouds upon the horizon were floating gently along. Now, the
thunder-god said:—"This country is, in truth, the high heaven. Its
foundations consist of iron so that if we fight here for two or three
years we need have no fear of damaging it. This is indeed a place in
which we can especially measure our strength."

   Having so said, he set upon me mightily with his sword, and I too
turned upon him as fiercely. Nevertheless, the edge of the black chariot
clashed against the sword and warded off the blows, so there was only
the sound of clashing iron. In the same way our white chariot, also
rising up and guarding with its floor, sent forth a clashing sound. And
now, fighting fiercely, we chased each other from one end of heaven to
the other, till at length we chanced to pass over a metal house which
was covered in with a lid, and, <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> over
this we stayed and fought; whilst doing so, there came forth a voice
from the inside of the house which said:—

   "Look here, O Poiyaumbe and thunder-god, I have something to say, so
pay attention. It is indeed true that the foundations of Ainu-land are
rocks, and it is also true that the foundations of heaven above consist
of metal. But as ye continue to carry on your battles here, heaven has
grown weary and waxed hot for the reason that its foundations are iron.
Ye should be careful. Now then, come, underneath Ainu-land there are six
countries, and beneath these again there is another, a beautiful land.
The name of that country is *Chirama*,<span
id="page_34_fr_19"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">19</span></sup>](#page_34_note_19.md) and its foundations
consist of earth. Go ye to that land and fight, for unless ye do, our
country and villages will be all spoiled." So sounded forth the voice of
God.

   Upon this the thunder-god sheathed his sword and I also sheathed
mine. Then, as we entered heaven, so we went out—with a rush. We passed
down through space <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> head-first, like
snipes, and, piercing our land, we went through six countries. Having
done this, we came, as we were told we should, to a truly beautiful
country; without doubt this was *Chirama*-land, upon which we had
descended.

   And now we chased one another from one end of the country to the
other, fighting, as before, most fiercely. Nevertheless, whenever and
however we fought, the black chariot rising, falling, and swinging to
and fro, kept off my blows with its sides and floor, so that the result
was nothing but the sound of clashing metal. In the same way the white
chariot also rose up and fenced the blows with its sides and floor like
a shield. However much I strove, I could by no means touch the body of
the thunder-god. I therefore aimed at nothing but to cut the trappings
by which the black chariot was suspended. And fighting hard with this
intent, I was able, after a time and by the help of God, to sever them.
So, too, all the trappings of our white chariot were cut asunder. We
therefore all fell down to the <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> ground.
Then the thunder-god got out of his black chariot and came to me,
walking by the help of his hands.

   Upon this the younger sister of the thunder-god shed many tears and
said:— "Oh my elder brother, you are a god; and if you would but marry a
goddess you would have no need to carry on this fierce combat with
Poiyaumbe. Why do you set your affections on this Lady of Kunnepet as
though she were the only woman? Now our<span
id="page_36_fr_20"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">20</span></sup>](#page_36_note_20.md) charmed black chariot
has been quite broken up and you are as one fighting without armour. Be
careful or Poiyaumbe will slay you." So spake the sister of the
thunder-god through her tears.

   After she had said this, the sister of the wolf-god went out and
fought against her. Then the thunder-god set upon me most fiercely and I
returned the attack just as vehemently. Thus fighting together, I
managed with great difficulty to strike him now and then, so that his
garments <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> were hanging about him in rags.
But he was not to be beaten; for he also in like manner cut my clothes
into many pieces. Whilst things were going on so, a mighty sound as if
the true gods were coming to us, issued forth from the east of
*Chirama*-land, and all at once my Lady of Kunnepet, more beautiful than
ever, and shedding many tears, alighted and came to the side of the
wolf-god. And now the sister of the thunder-god fought mightily, but
after two or three final struggles, she was cut down and slain. Her
divine spirit roared loudly as it ascended into the skies. She went up
to heaven a living goddess; and, when she had departed the roaring
ceased.

   After this my Lady of Kunnepet, in company with the sister of the
wolf-god came to my side and we three together fought against the
thunder-god. So that after a time he was, though with difficulty, cut
down and slain. His spirit roared as it went up; but, as it was not
possible for it to go into the western<span
id="page_37_fr_21"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">21</span></sup>](#page_37_note_21.md) end of *Chirama*-land
it ascended <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> to the high heavens with a
great noise. It went up a new god and then the sound died away.

   When all was over, my Lady of Kunnepet and the younger sister of the
wolf-god saluted one another with their swords, and then, after we had
come to our country and to the village of Kunnepet, the sister of the
wolf-god said:—"As I am a goddess, I must take a husband from among the
gods, but as you are a man, it would be well for you to marry the Lady
of Kunnepet. Now, you are watched over by my elder brother the wolf-god,
so henceforth do no more fighting, but when you have wine, be careful
that you make some *inao*<span id="page_38_fr_22"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">22</span></sup>](#page_38_note_22.md) and offer libations to
the wolf-god."

   When she had finished speaking, she departed with a great sound. Then
my Lady of Kunnepet worked away with a willing heart and great pleasure,
and, having prepared food, she heaped up very full a pretty cup, and,
setting it on a beautiful tray, brought it to me with many bows. After
eating a little of it, I pushed the remainder <span id="page_39">p.
39</span> to her and she, lifting it up and down in thankfulness,
finished it.<span id="page_39_fr_23"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">23</span></sup>](#page_39_note_23.md) Then, when the meal was
over, my Lady of Kunnepet proceeded to get the house in order and we
have lived happily ever since.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_25">p. 25</span>

<span id="page_25_note_1"></span>[1](#page_25_fr_1.md) The word here
translated "slave" is, in Ainu, a compound noun *Usshiu ne guru*. By
comparing it with itself in certain other places in legends where it
occurs, always, of course, taking the context into consideration, we are
led to the conclusion that it really refers to persons who have been
taken prisoners during war or in night raids. We learn from the Ainus
that it used to be the custom of their ancestors when at war with one
another to kill as many male adults as possible and take the women and
children for "slaves" and concubines. All these were called by the word
here translated "slaves." However, the hero of the present legend
appears to have been a "lad in waiting" or "page," something after the
manner, only greatly modified, of course, of the old chivalric times in
Europe. Elsewhere he is called by a word meaning "the brave Ainu;" hence
from these two names we are led to adopt the opinion that he was the son
of a female prisoner or slave by her master, though he may have been
only a son of two slaves born in the house. All children born in a
person's house, whether they were the natural offspring of the master or
the slave, were alike counted as members of one family and accompanied
their lord on his war expeditions. Hence what would appear quite
unnatural to us, namely, that a "slave" should go to war on his own
account, would be quite natural among the Ainus.

<span id="footnotes_page_26">p. 26</span>

<span id="page_26_note_2"></span>[2](#page_26_fr_2.md) *Shinutapka*,
elsewhere called *Shinutapkashi* is the ancient name of some mountains
in the north of Yezo, distant from Ishkari about ten or twelve Japanese
*ri*, and is said to have been the home of a race of especially brave
Ainu warriors. Upon the highest point of this mountain there is said to
be the remains of one of their old forts still in existence. However
this may be, it is certain that *Shinutapka* enters very much into the
Ainu legends, and the people of the present day point to the districts
of Ishkari and Mashki as the locality of these famous mountains.
*Shinutapka* means "the top of the very high mountain peak."

<span id="page_26_note_3"></span>[3](#page_26_fr_3.md) The name *Kunnepet*
means "the black river," but it seems that no one now knows the locality
or river which once bore this name.

<span id="page_26_note_4"></span>[4](#page_26_fr_4.md) The word translated
"belt" is, in Ainu, *Uokkane kut* whose exact meaning is "girdle with
metal fastenings." This would seem to show us that the Ainus used to
wear "belts" rather than the girdles they have now. In fact, the word
cannot be applied to any kind of girdle unless it has either a buckle or
a hook and eye at the ends.

<span id="page_26_note_5"></span>[5](#page_26_fr_5.md) The head of the
fireplace (i.e. that part of a hut between the fireplace and east
window) is sacred. It is here especially that the great drinking-bouts
are held.

<span id="page_26_note_6"></span>[6](#page_26_fr_6.md) The "upper window"
here referred to is a hole left in the west end of a hut for the purpose
of allowing the smoke to escape. Some of the Ainus, however, those of
Ishkari for example, have the aperture left in the south side of the
roof.

<span id="footnotes_page_27">p. 27</span>

<span id="page_27_note_7"></span>[7](#page_27_fr_7.md) The Ainu words I
have translated "inspiring gods" are full of deep theology, and cast a
side-light upon Ainu religious ideas. They show us that the Ainu race is
a deeply religious one. The words are *ituren Kamui*. *Kamui* means
"God" or "gods." *Turen* signifies "to be inspired by the gods" as when
a prophet prophecies; "to be possessed with a devil;" "to be afflicted
with disease as a punishment for evil;" "to receive special blessings
from the gods;" "to have God's protection" as when engaged in some great
and dangerous undertaking. The particle *i* prefixed to *turen*
intensifies its meaning. Hence in this particular place *ituren Kamui*
really means "the inspiring, guiding, guarding, keeping, protecting
gods." Such words as these speak for themselves as regards the religious
instincts of the Ainus. I may as well note in passing that every Ainu
household is supposed to have its special guardian god. It is called
*Turen Kamui*, and is thought to sit upon the roof the house when the
master is at home, but to accompany him when he goes on a journey. So
here, our hero was accompanied by his "inspiring, guardian god."

<span id="page_27_note_8"></span>[8](#page_27_fr_8.md) The words "mighty
wind" are, in the original, "the winds of god." When the Ainus desire to
express greatness, mightiness, beauty and such like ideas they often use
the word *Kamui*, "god." Thus for "great trees" we hear "trees of God;"
for "high mountains" we have "mountains of God;" for "beautiful
flowers," "flowers of God," for "great rivers," "rivers of God," and
here for "Mighty winds" we find "winds of God." We can thus understand
that "bears" are called "animals of God" because they are to the Ainus
the "Kings of the forest."

When it is said that he went before the "Mighty winds" or "the winds of
God" we must remember that the Ainus have an idea that their ancestors
had power, by the help of their *Turen Kamui*—"inspiring guardian gods,"
to fly through the air or even to wage war in the air. These particular
"winds of God" may therefore be called "delightful, pleasant winds" with
as much propriety as "mighty winds."

<span id="page_27_note_9"></span>[9](#page_27_fr_9.md) The words "weeping
very exceedingly" are, when translated literally, "two bad weeps."
Severity or excessiveness are often expressed in Ainu by "two or three"
or "twice or thrice." Thus, "he was struck twice or thrice" sometimes
means "he was severely beaten;" and, as here, "she had two bad weeps" we
get "she wept very exceedingly," or "she wept exceeding bitterly."

<span id="footnotes_page_28">p. 28</span>

<span id="page_28_note_10"></span>[10](#page_28_fr_10.md) We are here let
into the secret of Ainu ideas concerning thunder. In bodily form the
thunder-gods are supposed to resemble men, and they have the same kind
of affections as human beings. It will also be seen later on that they
speak with the language of men. Nor, speaking from what we know of other
so called Ainu gods, must we suppose that the thunder-gods are all males
and but two in number, for analogy would lead us to conclude that the
Ainus consider the thunder-gods to be very numerous and to marry and be
given in marriage and therefore to be of both sexes. Though they may be
born they can never die. Thunder itself is caused by the movements of
these gods.

<span id="page_28_note_11"></span>[11](#page_28_fr_11.md) Poiyaumbe means
"the brave Ainu" or "the brave hero." The Ainus sometimes call Yezo by
the name *Ya un moshiri* so that *Ya un guru* or *Yaumbe* comes to mean
"an Ainu." This term was discussed in Vol XVI., Pt. II., p. 47, note 1,
of the Transactions of this Society.

<span id="page_28_note_12"></span>[12](#page_28_fr_12.md) The lady of
Kunnepet says she would cook some food for her visitor. It would be
considered a great breach of etiquette and very forward in a young woman
to do such a thing for a bachelor unless she was commanded to do so by
her guardians or parents. This is perfectly natural because part of the
Ainu marriage ceremony consists in the act of the bride cooking food and
giving it to her betrothed.

<span id="footnotes_page_29">p. 29</span>

<span id="page_29_note_13"></span>[13](#page_29_fr_13.md) The Ainus
consider white to be the best and purest colour. It is the colour of the
gods and all that is good, whilst black is supposed to represent evil
and the devil. I once saw an Ainu corpse with its feet clothed in white
rags which we had sometime before given to a person to dress some wounds
with. It was thought that the white rags would assist the dead in its
journey to heaven.

<span id="page_29_note_14"></span>[14](#page_29_fr_14.md) The word here
translated *chariot* now means *cradle*, but in this legend *chariot*
suits the sense better. The chariot is conceived of as being suspended
from above by means of strings and cords in the same way as the Ainus
suspend their cradles from the roof of their huts.

<span id="page_29_note_15"></span>[15](#page_29_fr_15.md) Here we have the
curious idea that the use of animals is partly to watch over human
beings. Thus the male wolf was the guardian of *Poiyaumbe*, our hero,
whilst the female wolf protected the Lady of Kunnepet. We can therefore
partly understand why the Ainus worship animals and offer libations of
wine to them.

<span id="footnotes_page_30">p. 30</span>

<span id="page_30_note_16"></span>[16](#page_30_fr_16.md) The goddess does
not mean to say that she is of no account; but to call oneself
"worthless" and "bad" is Ainu etiquette, though probably originally
borrowed from their Japanese neighbours.

<span id="page_30_note_17"></span>[17](#page_30_fr_17.md) These trappings
are simply the cords by which the chariot was suspended from heaven.

<span id="page_30_note_18"></span>[18](#page_30_fr_18.md) "The lower
heaven." The Ainus consider the heavens to be three in number. The first
in order is called *Shi-nish kando*, "the greatest skies;" this is
supposed to be the home of the chief of the gods, i.e. the Creator. The
second order of heavens is called *Nochiu-o kando*, "the skies which
bear the stars;" the second order of gods is supposed to dwell here. The
last or lowest heavens are named *range kando* or *urara kando*, i.e.
"the hanging skies" or "the fog skies;" the lowest orders of gods and
some of the demons, especially the demons of thunder, are supposed to
live here.

<span id="footnotes_page_34">p. 34</span>

<span id="page_34_note_19"></span>[19](#page_34_fr_19.md) *Chirama* means
"lowest."

<span id="footnotes_page_36">p. 36</span>

<span id="page_36_note_20"></span>[20](#page_36_fr_20.md) The chariots
were, we learn, charmed and acted as shields to the combatants.

<span id="footnotes_page_37">p. 37</span>

<span id="page_37_note_21"></span>[21](#page_37_fr_21.md) i.e. To die.

<span id="footnotes_page_38">p. 38</span>

<span id="page_38_note_22"></span>[22](#page_38_fr_22.md) Pieces of
whittled willow wood.

<span id="footnotes_page_39">p. 39</span>

ceremony was concluded and they were married.
