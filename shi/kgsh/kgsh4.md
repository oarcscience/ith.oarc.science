## A SCROLL OF GLEANINGS <span class="small">FROM</span> ANCIENT STORIES TOGETHER WITH A PREFACE <span class="small">BY <span class="small">IMBE-NO-SUKUNE-HIRONARI, LOWER GRADE OF THE JUNIOR FIFTH COURT RANK</span></span>

 Tradition says that writing was unknown in old Japan, so that all
people, whether high or low, youthful or aged, handed down from hoary
antiquity their sacred traditions verbally among themselves, memorizing
them from one generation to another. When, however, the art of writing
was introduced, the Japanese began to discard the old simple way of
transmitting orally their family traditions under the prevailing
influence of the new tendency to ostentation and frivolity which caused
the people to revolt against the ancient simplicity and despise those
who remained faithful to the old mode of oral transmission. Hence change
after change occurred in the traditional accounts they handed down
during long centuries, and, obviously, no one nowadays is competent to
decide the true origin and the exact nature of those cherished venerable
traditions. Even though <span id="page_16">p. 16</span> there certainly
exist some offical histories and private family records which describe
ancient things as they actually were, yet Your Imperial Majesty’s humble
servant Hironari finds that there still survive some others not
mentioned in those written documents, which would probably by degrees
sink into oblivion, unless Your Imperial Majesty’s humble servant
Hironari make so bold as to endeavour to bring them to light. The
gracious message which Your Imperial Majesty was pleased to grant your
humble servant has induced him gratefully to avail himself of this
opportunity to submit to the Throne all the historical details that have
been handed down and preserved in his family,—but which, nevertheless,
to his great regret have not yet been published. Therefore now, animated
by the spirit of righteous indignation, burning so long within him, he
ventures to record his own dear old family tradition:—

 According to one tradition, when Heaven and Earth began, the two Gods,
Izanagi or the Divine Male and Izanami or the Divine Female, having
entered into conjugal relations begat the
Great-Eight-Island-Country,<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](kgsh5.htm#note_1.md)<span
id="page_16_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_16_note_*.md) its mountains and rivers,
trees and herbs, the Sun-Goddess<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](kgsh5.htm#note_2.md) and the Moon-God,<span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](kgsh5.htm#note_3.md) and finally the God Susano-O, the
Impetuous Male God.<span id="fr_4"></span>[4](kgsh5.htm#note_4.md)

 This God Susano-O, however, wept and wailed so much that he caused
people to die untimely deaths and the mountain greens to wither.
Therefore his Divine Parents wrathfully decreed: <span id="page_17">p.
17</span> “Now that thou art so exeeedingly wicked, thou shalt no longer
remain with us, but must descend to the Ne-no-Kuni or Underworld.”

 Another legend says that when Heaven and Earth separated the names of
the Gods who were born in the midst of Heaven were, (*1*)
Ame-no-Minakanushi-no-Kami<span id="fr_5"></span>[5](kgsh5.htm#note_5.md)
or the Divine Lord of the Very Centre of Heaven, (*2*)
Takami-Musubi-no-Kami<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](kgsh5.htm#note_6.md) or the
Divine Male (or Lofty) Producer (otherwise known as
Sumeragamutsu-Kamurogi-no-Mikoto<span
id="fr_7"></span>[7](kgsh5.htm#note_7) or the Divine Ancestor.md),<span
id="page_17_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_17_note_*) (*3*.md)
Kamumi-Musubi-no-Kami or the Divine Female Producer (otherwise called
Sumeragamutsu-Kamuromi-no-Mikoto or the Divine Ancestress, whose son,
Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto, became the ancestor of the Nakatomi family of
Asomi rank<span id="fr_8"></span>[8](kgsh5.htm#note_8).md).

 Takuhatachichi-Hime-no-Mikoto (Mother of the heavenly ancestor
Amatsu-Hiko-no-Mikoto<span id="fr_9"></span>[9](kgsh5.htm#note_9).md) was
the daughter of Takami-Musubi-no-Kami, and Ame-no-Oshihi-no-Mikoto
(Ancestor of the Ōtomo family of Sukune rank<span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](kgsh5.htm#note_10).md) and Ame-no-Futotama-no-Mikoto
(Ancestor of the Imbe family of Sukune rank) were his sons. Among the
adherents of Futotama-no-Mikoto are Ame-no-Hiwashi-no-Mikoto (Ancestor
of the Imbe family of Awa \[阿波\] Province), Taokiho-Oi-no-Mikoto<span
id="fr_11"></span>[11](kgsh5.htm#note_11.md) (Ancestor of the Imbe family
of Sanuki Province), Hikosashiri-no-Mikoto (Ancestor of the Imbe family
of Ki-I Province), Kushi-Akarutama-no-Mikoto<span
id="fr_12"></span>[12](kgsh5.htm#note_12.md) (Ancestor of the <span
id="page_18">p. 18</span> Tamatsukuri family of Izumo Province), and
Ame-no-Mahitotsu-no-Mikoto (Ancestor of the Imbe family of the Tsukushi
and Ise Provinces). When Susano-O-no-Kami was ascending to Heaven, in
order to bid farewell to the Sun-Goddess (Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami),
Kushi-Akarutama-no-Mikoto met him on the way and offered him some sacred
large curved jewels. Susano-O-no-Kami accepted the gift, and presented
the jewels to the Sun-Goddess, and thus established a Covenant between
those two deities, and by virtue of those jewels<span
id="fr_13"></span>[13](kgsh5.htm#note_13.md), the child
Akatsu-no-Mikoto,<span id="fr_14"></span>[14](kgsh5.htm#note_14.md) one of
the Heavenly Ancestors, was born. Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami brought up this
child, Akatsu-no-Mikoto, with maternal affection and especial care,
frequently carrying it under her protecting arms. So, the beloved child
was called “wakigo.” This word denotes a child held under its mother’s
arm (the current Japanese term for an infant, “wakago,” is derived from
the word “wakigo”).

 When Susano-O-no-Kami’s conduct towards Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami became also
excessively rude and he often resorted to one or another form of
violence, such as breaking down the divisions of the rice-fields;
filling up the irrigating channels; opening the flood-gate of the
sluices; sowing seed over again; erecting rods in the rice-fields<span
id="fr_15"></span>[15](kgsh5.htm#note_15.md); flaying live animals
backwards, and spreading excrement over the doors<span
id="fr_16"></span>[16](kgsh5.htm#note_16.md) (When the Sun-Goddess was
toiling in her rice-fields, Susano-O-no-Kami would stealthily creep
there and erect rods in order to demonstrate <span id="page_19">p.
19</span> his right of ownership over the fields; sowing seed again in
the fields which had been already sown by Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami, so as to
injure her first sown seed, thereby causing the quality of the rice to
deteriorate; breaking down the low, narrow dykes, which divide rice
fields from each other; filling up the channels of ditches through which
the Sun-Goddess made the streams of water flow in order to irrigate the
rice plants, mischievously leaving open the flood-gates of the sluices
when unnecessary. For example, when Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami was about to
celebrate the Nīnae-Matsuri or Autumnal Harvest Festival,
Susano-O-no-Kami sacrilegiously polluted her Festival-Hall by spreading
excreta upon the doors of her sacred hall, and while the Goddess was
occupied in weaving, Susano-O-no-Kami flayed a living colt backwards and
flung it into her sacred hall. Thus one readily sees that the origin of
both agriculture and the art of weaving dates back to the Divine Age.
Susano-O-no-Kami’s misdeeds are styled “heavenly offences” and nowadays
we are familiarized with them through the “Ritual of the Great
Purification,” which is recited from time to time by Shintō priests of
the Nakatomi family).

 Whereupon Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami was greatly incensed, and entering into
the Heavenly Rock-Cave, closed its door and concealed herself therein.
Consequently, the eternal night of darkness prevailed, so that no one
could distinguish between the day and the night. And all the gods were
dismayed and, to their great inconvenience, all business was transacted
by artificial light. Then <span id="page_20">p. 20</span>
Takami-Musubi-no-Kami summoned a council of the Eighty Myriads of Gods
on the Dry-Bed-of-the-Eight-Sand-Bank-River in Heaven<span
id="fr_17"></span>[17](kgsh5.htm#note_17.md), and enquired what measures
should be taken in order to rectify matters. In response
Omoikane-no-Kami, the God of Profound Knowledge and Foresight, proposed
the following scheme to induce Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami to return from her
hiding place in the Rock-Cave. Futotama-no-Kami was to be appointed to
make “nigite,” *i.e.*, offerings of fine cloth, in aid of the gods of
different callings. Ishiko-ritome-no-Kami (from whom the Kagamitsukuri
or Mirror-making family is sprung and who is the child of
Ame-no-Nukado-no-Mikoto) was to construct a mirror, resembling in form
the disc of the sun, *i.e.*, an image of Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami, out of
copper brought from the Heavenly Mt. Kagu. Nagashiraha-no-Kami (Ancestor
of the Omi family in Ise Province—“shiraha,” the ordinary name of cloth
at the present day, originated from the name of this god) was to plant
hemp and make “aonigite,” *i.e.*, offerings of fine blue-coloured hempen
cloth. Ame-no-Hiwashi-no-Kami and Tsukuimi-no-Kami were bidden to make
“shiranigite,” *i.e.*, offerings of fine white cloth woven from the
paper mulberry (tradition says that at that time, both hemp and mulberry
grew luxuriantly in a night after being planted).
Ame-no-Hazuchio-no-Kami (Ancestor of the Shizuri family) was to weave
cloth of lovely variegated colours. The Goddess Ame-no-Tanabata-Hime was
to weave the fine divine robes. The task allotted to
Kushi-Akarutama-no-Kami was to link together five hundred large jewels
on an <span id="page_21">p. 21</span> august string. Taokiho-Oi-no-Kami
and Hikosashiri-no-Kami were to build according to the heavenly standard
of measurement (*i.e.*, measures<span
id="fr_18"></span>[18](kgsh5.htm#note_18.md) of varying size and some
measuring tools) a beautiful sacred hall of choicest timber brought from
different valleys, and also were to make hats, spears, and shields.
Lastly, Ame-no-Mahitotsu-no-Kami was ordered to make various kinds of
swords and axes, and to cast tinkling bells of iron.

 When all was finished, they were to bring a fine sacred Sakaki tree
with five hundred branches from the Heavenly Mt. Kagu, and hang
jewels<span id="fr_19"></span>[19](kgsh5.htm#note_19.md) on its upper
branches, a mirror on its central branches, offerings of fine cloth both
blue and white in colour on the lower branches. Then Futotama-no-Mikoto,
holding the Sakaki tree in his hands, was earnestly to eulogize
Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami, while Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto was to recite a
liturgy invoking the Goddess.

 Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto (“uzume” siginfies a strong, brave woman, and
therefore such a woman is still called “osushi,” which is identical in
meaning with “uzume” and differs only in pronunciation) was then to
arrange a wreath of spindle-tree and throw a scarf made of club moss
around her shoulders, and, holding bamboo grass and leaves from the
“oke” tree<span id="fr_20"></span>[20](kgsh5.htm#note_20.md) in one hand
and a spear adorned with tinkling bells in the other, was to perform
skilfully in company with the other gods an inspired religious dance,
*placing a tub bottom upwards*<span
id="fr_21"></span>[21](kgsh5.htm#note_21) (signifying an oath.md) and
kindling sacred bonfires, before the Heavenly Rock-Cave.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

 Thus doing, as Omoikane-no-Kami had suggested, they first tried to
construct a mirror, as an image of the Sun-Goddess; but as the first
mirror made by Ishikoritome-no-Kami was slightly defective and therefore
unfit for use (this Mirror is the Deity at Hinokuma in Ki-I Province), a
second was moulded which was ideally beautiful (this Mirror is the Deity
of the Ise Shrine). When all this was completed, Futotama-no-Mikoto
prayerfully recired a liturgy full of eulogizing words:—

 “The august Mirror in my hands is spotless and indescribably beautiful
as though it were Thine own august person. Pray open the Cave-door and
behold it.”

 Then Futotama-no-Mikoto and Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto conjointly offered
prayers to Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami.

 Whereupon Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami bethought herself, “How is it that the
Gods can enjoy such merry-making even when the world is wrapt in
darkness, since I have concealed myself in this Cave?” And so saying,
she slightly opened the Cave-door and gazed secretly at the joyous scene
without. Then, as pre-arranged, Ame-no-Tachikara-O-no-Kami opened the
Rock-Cave door fully and induced the Goddess to remove to the new palace
they had constructed for her, and Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto and
Futotama-no-Mikoto encircled the new divine dwelling place with an
august sun-rope (now called “shirikumenawa”<span
id="fr_22"></span>[22](kgsh5.htm#note_22.md) or bottom-tied rope to
represent the shadow of the sun). Ō-Miya-no-Me-no-Kami<span
id="fr_23"></span>[23](kgsh5.htm#note_23.md) waited upon Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami
(Ō-Miya-no-Me-no-Kami <span id="page_23">p. 23</span> is a goddess
miraculously born of Futotama-no-Mikoto, and she waits upon
Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami, just as a Maid of Honour in the Imperial Court waits
upon the Emperor to please His Imperial Majesty by soothing, cheerful
and kindly words, and thus, serving as an intermediary between sovereign
and subject, she thereby brings both into affectionate and harmonious
relationship), and Toyo-Iwamado-no-Mikoto<span
id="fr_24"></span>[24](kgsh5.htm#note_24.md) together with
Kushi-Iwamado-no-Mikoto<span id="fr_25"></span>[25](kgsh5.htm#note_25.md)
was on guard duty at the gates (these two Gods were born of
Futotama-no-Mikoto).

 The Sun-Goddess coming forth from the Rock-Cave now illumined the sky
and consequently the spectators were enlibled to distinguish one
another’s faces once more. Over flowing with joy, they loudly cried:

“*Ahare! ahare!*” (signifying that the sky is now illuminated)

“*Ana omoshiroshi!*” (“O how delightful it is again clearly to see one
another’s faces!”)

“*Ana tanoshi!*” (“What joy to dance with outstretched hands!”)

“*Ana sayake oke!*” (“How refreshing and reviving! just like the
rustling sound of breezes softly whispering in bamboo grass, or through
the leaves of the trees playing sweet melodies of natural music!”)

 Then the two Gods Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto and Futotama-no-Mikoto
respectfully besought the Sun-Goddess never more to hide her face.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

 As a punishment for bringing about this catastrophe the Gods inflicted
on Susano-O-no-Kami a heavy expiatory fine—the hair of his head, and his
finger and toe nails being also cut off for his offence; and thus
satisfied, they banished that evil God Susano-O from Heaven.
Susano-O-no-Kami then descended to the banks of the River Hi in Izumo
Province, where with his heavenly ten-span sword (the sword, otherwise
called Ame-no-Hahakiri, is now preserved at the Isonokami Shrine—the
archaic Japanese word for “serpent” is “haha”, so that the
Ame-no-Hahakiri Sword signifies the weapon by which the monster serpent
was slain), he slew a serpent with an eight-forked head and tail, in
whose tail was concealed the divine sword “Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi”
or the “Heavenly Sword of Assembled Clouds” (So named, because above the
monster serpent there always hung a mass of miraculous clouds. The
Imperial Prince Yamatotakeru-no-Mikoto on his expedition in the eastern
provinces, thanks to the miraculous virtue of this same divine sword,
narrowly escaped falling a victim to the enemy’s treacherous strategy by
mowing away the grass of the wilderness of Sagami Province. From that
time on, owing to the Prince’s providential escape from danger, the
sword “Ame-no-Murakumo” was re-named “Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi,” signifying
“Herb-quelling or Grass-mowing Sword”). Susano-O-no-Kami presented the
Heavenly Gods with this sword.

 Then Susano-O-no-Kami married a daughter of a local god <span
id="page_25">p. 25</span> who bore him a son named Ōnamuchi-no-Kami
(this God is variously known as Ōmononushi-no-Kami, Ōkuninushi-no-Kami,
and Ōkunitama-no-Kami, who being now at Ōmiwa in Shiki-no-Kami District,
Yamato Province, is also called Ōmiwa-no-Kami<span
id="fr_26"></span>[26](kgsh5.htm#note_26).md), and then Susano-O-no-Kami
passed over to the Ne-no-Kuni or Underworld.

 Ōnamuchi-no-Kami, together with Sukunahikona-no-Kami (this God was the
son of Takami-Musubi-no-Mikoto, and he went over later to the
Tokoyo-no-Kuni<span id="fr_27"></span>[27](kgsh5.htm#note_27.md)—a far
distant land), did his best to carry out his programme of ministering to
the welfare of both men and domestic animals: for example, these two
Gods instructed living beings how to heal diseases by means of medicine
and magical incantations or witchcraft by which all calamities inflicted
upon them by birds, beasts, reptiles, and insects could be expelled. All
that our ancestors then learned from these two divine healers was so
important and efficacious that they and their descendants have ever
since enjoyed the gracious protection of these divinities. The heavenly
ancestor Akatsu-no-Mikoto took to wife Takuhatachichi-Hime, daughter of
Takami-Musubi-no-Kami, who bore him a son. This heavenly son was called
Amatsuhiko-no-Mikoto, *i.e.*, the Sovran August Grandson (because he was
the grandson of Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami and Takami-Musubi-no-Kami.

 It was, then, the intention of Amateresu-Ō-Mikami and
Takami-Musubi-no-Mikoto that the August Grandson should be brought up
<span id="page_26">p. 26</span> in Heaven above and become Lord of the
Central Land of Luxuriant Reed Plains below. So the two Heavenly
Messenger Gods Futsunushi-no-Kami (the son of Iwatsutsume-no-Kami, and
now worshipped at Katori in Shimōsa Proviuce) and
Takemi-katsuchi-no-Kami (the son of Mikahayahi-no-Kami, and now
worshipped at Kashima in Hitachi Province) descended from the Plain of
High Heaven to this land of Japan and completely subdued those who
opposed their divine troops.

 Ōnamuchi-no-Kami presented his pacifying spear to the Heavenly
Messenger-Gods, and withdrew with his son, Kotoshiro-nushi-no-Kami,
saying:

 “With this spear, I subdued my foes on the earth, so in future it will
be most useful for the Heavenly Grandson to preserve the country in
pence and order. Now, therefore, we shall humbly withdraw before the
Heavenly Grandson.”

 Both Ōnamuchi-no-Kami and Kotoshironushi-no-Kami thenceforth
disappeared from the face of the earth, leaving the two Heavenly
Messenger-Gods to carry on their work of subduing hostile powers, and
when it was completed they triumphantly reported the result of their
mission to the Heavenly Throne. Then the Divine Ancestress
Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami and Takami-Musubi-no-Mikoto issued an Imperial
Edict,<span id="fr_28"></span>[28](kgsh5.htm#note_28.md) saying:

 “The Luxuriant Land of Reed Plains is a country which our descendants
are to inherit. Go, therefore, our Imperial Grandson, and rule over it!
and may our Imperial lineage continue <span id="page_27">p. 27</span>
unbroken and proseperous, co-eternal with Heaven and Earth!”

 Then, the Heavenly Ancestors presented the Heavenly Grandson with the
two Sacred Treasures,<span id="fr_29"></span>[29](kgsh5.htm#note_29.md) the
Yata-no-Kagami or Eight-hand-span Mirror or Large Mirror and the
Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi or Herb-quening Sword, *i.e.*, the Divine Imperial
Regalia, together with the jewels and the spear, and said:—

 “Our child, whenever you gaze upon this Sacred Mirror, let it be as if
you were gazing upon us. So regarding it, you will find it holy, and
must therefore reverently worship it, ever keeping it beside your couch
and in the privacy of your own room.”<span
id="fr_30"></span>[30](kgsh5.htm#note_30.md)

 Moreover, the Heavenly Ancestors caused Ame-no-Koyano-no-Mikoto,
Futotama-no-Mikoto and Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto<span
id="fr_31"></span>[31](kgsh5.htm#note_31.md) to descend from Heaven, in
attendance on the Heavenly Grandson, and then issued the following
Divine Imperial Edict:

 “We,<span id="fr_32"></span>[32](kgsh5.htm#note_32.md) on our own part,
shall worship in the Sacred Precincts of Divine Trees and Holy Stones on
behalf of the Heavenly Grandson, and ye, Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto and
Futotama-no-Mikoto, shall go down to the Central Land of Reed Plains
with the Divine Trees and reverently pray to the gods for the welfare of
the Heavenly Grandson, guarding<span
id="fr_33"></span>[33](kgsh5.htm#note_33.md) him in your attendance under
the same roof against all emergencies, and serving<span
id="fr_34"></span>[34](kgsh5.htm#note_34.md) him with the rice of the
consecrated paddy fields of which we partake in Heaven above (the
original rice-seeds brought thence here below), and Futotama-no-Mikoto
shall perform his duties on the earth with the gods belonging to
different hereditary corporations just as they were wont to <span
id="page_28">p. 28</span> do in Heaven.”

 Thus those Gods<span id="fr_35"></span>[35](kgsh5.htm#note_35.md) were
transferred from Heaven to the suite of the Heavenly Grandson when he
descended to this earth. On the same occasion the Imperial Edict<span
id="fr_36"></span>[36](kgsh5.htm#note_36.md) addressed to
Ōmono-nushi-no-Kami ran as follows:—

 “Henceforth thou shalt guard the Heavenly Grandson against danger by
the aid of the Eighty Myriads of Gods under your command.”

 Then, Ame-no-Oshihi-no-Mikoto, ancestor of the Ōtomo family,
accompanied by Ame-no-Kushitsu-Ō-Kume, ancestor of the Kume family—all
heavily armed—was ordered to descend from Heaven, at the head of the
Imperial Body Guards.

 When the Heavenly Grandson was about to descend, the advance guard
returned and raised an alarm, saying:

 “There is a strange god at the Eight-forked Cross-Ways of Heaven, whose
nose measures seven-hand-spans long and whose back some seven feet long,
and whose mouth and posteriors brightly shine and whose fiery eyeballs
closely resemble a luminous eight-hand-span or large mirror.”

 Then the Gods in the Heavenly Grandson’s suite were to be sent to
challenge the monstrous stranger upon the road but not one of the Eighty
Myriads of Gods was bold enough to do so. Then, by divine command,
Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto, the Heavenly Lady of Dauntless Spirit, was sent
to confront him, with her waist band lowered below the navel and with
her <span id="page_29">p. 29</span> breast laid bare, and she laughed at
him mockingly. The God of the Cross-Ways<span
id="fr_37"></span>[37](kgsh5.htm#note_37.md) asked, “What do you mean by
that?” Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto responded, “Who are you? and, why do you
obstruct the way whilst the Heavenly Grandson descends to the earthly
land?” The God of the Cross-Ways replied, “On hearing the news of the
Heavenly Grandson’s descent to earth, I came respectfully to meet and
guide him. I am the Great God Saruta-Hiko.”<span
id="fr_38"></span>[38](kgsh5.htm#note_38.md)

 Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto then enquired, saying: “Will you be his herald,
or shall I?” “Will I? of course, I will,” answered Saruta-Hiko. Then
Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto asked again, “Where are you going, and, whither
do you intend to lead the Heavenly Grandson on?” To this Saruta-Hiko
replied, “The Heavenly Grandson is to go to the Wondrous Peak of
Takachiho in Hyūga, Tsukushi, and I shall proceed to the River Isuzu at
Sanagata in Ise; and as you are the first to make my acquaintance, you
will please accompany me thither.” Then Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto returned
to the Heavenly Grandson and reported these things. The Heavenly
Grandson descended to the Wondrous Mountain Peak from the Plain of High
Heaven, as Saruta-Hiko respectfully directed, and Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto
accompanied Saruta-Hiko to Ise, as he had invited her
(Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto is the ancestress of the Sarume<span
id="fr_39"></span>[39](kgsh5.htm#note_39.md) family of Kimi rank, the word
“Sarume” meaning “she-monkey” and being derived from the name of the God
Saruta-Hiko, whom <span id="page_30">p. 30</span> Uzume-no-Mikoto first
encountered on the descent from Heaven to the earthly land. So this is
the reason why both the male and the female of the Sarume family of Kimi
rank are alike styled “Sarume-no-Kimi”).

 Thus, from generation to generation, we see that all the gods were in
the Heavenly Grandson’s service and each with his own hereditary
calling, as the Heavenly Imperial Edict had dictated. The Heavenly
Ancestor Hikaha-no-Mikoto married Toyotama-Hime, the Sea-God’s daughter,
and she bore him Hikanagisa-na-Mikoto.<span
id="fr_40"></span>[40](kgsh5.htm#note_40).md) When this son was expected a
new hut was built on the seashore for his birth.
Ame-no-Oshihito-no-Mikoto, ancestor of the Kani-Mori family of Muraji
rank, waited upon the divine son, clearing away the “kani,” *i.e.*,
crabs, with a broom, and laying mats around for his mother’s comfort.
From this incident originated the hereditary title of Kani-Mori (now
called “Kamu-Mori,” which is a modification of the words “Kani-Mori,”
*i.e.*, one who brushes away the kani or crabs).

 When the Emperor Jimmu<span id="fr_41"></span>[41](kgsh5.htm#note_41.md)
conquered the eastern provinces,<span
id="fr_42"></span>[42](kgsh5.htm#note_42.md) Hi-no-Omi-no-Mikoto, ancestor
of the Ōtomo family, commanded the Imperial forces, and rendered the
most distinguished services to His Majesty, subduing all the hostile
powers, and Nigihayahi-no-Mikoto, ancestor of the Mononobe family,
surrendered respectfully with his numerous soldiers, killing one<span
id="fr_43"></span>[43](kgsh5.htm#note_43.md) who obstinately resisted the
Imperial army to the last. Therefore Nigihayahi-no-Mikoto was deservedly
rewarded for his loyal submission <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> to the
Emperor, and Shiinetsu-Hiko, ancestor of the Ōyamato family, rendered
distinguished services to the Imperial fleet on the sea,<span
id="fr_44"></span>[44](kgsh5.htm#note_44.md) thus fulfilling the duties
allotted to him on Mt. Kagu. Lastly, Yatagarasu, ancestor of the
hereditary lords of Kamo-no-Agata, came flying in the form of a crow,
and this very fact being regarded as in itself an auspicious omen, he
served as an encouraging guide to the Imperial army in the rugged Uda
mountains.<span id="fr_45"></span>[45](kgsh5.htm#note_45.md)

 After a hard fight the Imperial army succeeded in vanquishing all the
diabolic foes, and peace and order reigned throughout the whole Empire,
and in consequence thereof Kashihara in Yamato became the capital of
Japan, and the Imperial Court was established there.

 The descendants of both Taokiho-Oi-no-Mikoto and
Hikosa-shiri-no-Mikoto, under the guidance of Ame-no-Tomi-no-Mikoto (a
descendant of Futotama-no-Mikoto), obtained the needful timber from the
mountains, to build the “Mi-Araka”<span
id="fr_46"></span>[46](kgsh5.htm#note_46) (August or Divine Abode.md),
felling the trees with consecrated axes and mattocks. Their success in
so building it is often phrased: “Making stout the pillars of the august
abode upon the nethermost rock-bottom and raising the cross-beams of the
roof to the Plain of High Heaven for the august residence of the
Sovereign Grandson.”<span id="fr_47"></span>[47](kgsh5.htm#note_47.md) Even
at the present day we have amongst us the two branches of the Imbe
family, who are descended from those who procured the timber required
for the erection of the Imperial <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> Palace,
and from those who served as carpenter on that occasion. They are now
respectively dwelling at the Miki<span
id="fr_48"></span>[48](kgsh5.htm#note_48.md) and Araka villages, in
Nakusa-Kōri, Ki-I Province. And this proves how important a part the
Imbe family played in the erection of the Imperial Palace there at that
early date. By Imperial command Ame-no-Tomi-no-Mikoto, together with all
the branches of the Imbe family, made several sacred treasures, such as
mirrors, jewels, spears, shields, cloth made from the paper-mulberry and
hemp, etc.

 The descendants of Kushi-Akarutama-no-Mikoto made “miho-gitama” or
august, auspicious, sacred jewels (in archaic Japanese, “mi” means
“august” or “sacred,” and “hogi” or “hogu” literally means “to
congratulate,” hence “mihogi-tama” means “august, auspicious, sacred
jewels”) and their descendants still reside in Izumo Province, and some
jewels appear among their annual tribute to the Imperial Court. The
descendants of Ame-no-Hiwashi-no-Mikoto employed themselves in
cultivating hemp and paper-mulberry trees and in weaving coarse cloth
out of these materials. In obedience to the Emperor’s command,
Ame-no-Tomi-no-Mikoto, taking with him the descendants of
Hiwashi-no-Mikoto, migrated to Awa \[阿波\] Province in search of
fertile soil suitable for the cultivation of the above plants. The
descendants of this family are still dwelling in that district and at
the celebration of the Great Harvest Festival after the enthronement of
a new Emperor, they pay tribute of <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> the
bark of the paper-mulberry, hempen fibre, coarse cloth made from them,
and several other things to the Imperial House. The survival of the name
O-e—literally, hemp planting—in that locality of Awa \[阿波\] Province
proves that there was formerly a district where such useful plants as
paper-mulberry trees, the hemp plants, etc., were highly cultivated.

 Ame-no-Tomi-no-Mikoto next proceeded to the eastern districts of Japan
with some members of the above-mentioned Imbe family of Awa \[阿波\] to
search for another fertile land wherein to cultivate similar plants.
Hence that land, when found, being very suitable for growing hemp,
paper-mulberry trees, etc., was called Fusa-no-Kuni (in archaic Japanese
“asa” or “hemp” is called “fusa,” and we still have the “Upper and Lower
Districts of Fusa”).

 The land where the “yū,” paper-mulberry trees, grew abundantly, was
called Yūki-Kōri.

 The district occupied by some branches of the Imbe family is now known
as Awa-Kōri (*i.e.*, the present Awa<span
id="fr_49"></span>[49](kgsh5.htm#note_49) \[安房\] Province.md). Here
Ame-no-Tomi-no-Mikoto erected a Shintō shrine to his ancestral God,
Futotama-no-Mikoto. It is called the “Awa Shrine,” and consequently we
find a branch of the Imbe family among the people attached to it. Those
who being descended from Taokiho-Oi-no-Mikoto were in charge of making
spear-rods, when they settled in Sanuki Province, used to present
tribute to the Imperial Court in the form of eight hundred <span
id="page_34">p. 34</span> spear-rods in addition to the ordinary
tributary goods. All these historical facts prove that my contentions
are indisputable. Then, in strict obedience to the ordinance of the two
ancestral Heavenly Gods,<span id="fr_50"></span>[50](kgsh5.htm#note_50.md)
a holy site with sacred trees and stones was erected in the Imperial
Court and in consequence the following divinities were worshipped there,
*viz.*,—Takami-Musubi<span id="fr_51"></span>[51](kgsh5.htm#note_51.md) or
the Divine Male Producer, Kamumi-Musubi<span
id="fr_52"></span>[52](kgsh5.htm#note_52.md) or the Divine Female Producer,
Tamatsume-Musubi<span id="fr_53"></span>[53](kgsh5.htm#note_53.md) or the
Soul-detaining Producer, Iku-Musubi<span
id="fr_54"></span>[54](kgsh5.htm#note_54.md) or the Vivifying Producer,
Taru-Musubi<span id="fr_55"></span>[55](kgsh5.htm#note_55.md) or the
Producer of Perfect Bodily Health and Strength,
Ō-Miya-no-Me-no-Kami,<span id="fr_56"></span>[56](kgsh5.htm#note_56.md)
Kotoshironushi-no-Kami,<span id="fr_57"></span>[57](kgsh5.htm#note_57.md)
Miketsu-Kami<span id="fr_58"></span>[58](kgsh5.htm#note_58.md) (homage is
now paid to these Eight Gods by the Court Priestesses<span
id="fr_59"></span>[59](kgsh5.htm#note_59) of Shintō.md),
Kushi-Iwamado-no-Kami,<span id="fr_60"></span>[60](kgsh5.htm#note_60.md)
Toyo-Iwamado-no-Kami (homage is now tendered to these Gods by the Shintō
Priestess of the August Gates), the Gods of Ikushima<span
id="fr_61"></span>[61](kgsh5.htm#note_61.md) (the Guardian-Spirits of the
Great-Eight-Island-Country,<span
id="fr_62"></span>[62](kgsh5.htm#note_62.md) whose worship is in charge of
the Shintō priests of Ikushima), and the Gods of Ikasuri<span
id="fr_63"></span>[63](kgsh5.htm#note_63.md) (the Guardian-Spirits of the
Imperial Court Grounds whose worship is entrusted to the Shintō
Priestesses of Ikasuri). Hi-no-Omi-no-Mikoto, Chief of the Kume family,
served as a guardian at the Imperial Gates, while Nigihayahi-no-Mikoto,
with some of the Mononobe family who were attached to the Court under
him, prepared a number of spears and shields as protective weapons for
the Emperor. When they had assured themselves that all was right,
Ame-no-Tomi-no-Mikoto, assisted by the <span id="page_35">p. 35</span>
members of the Imbe family, raised up the Sacred Mirror and Sacred
Sword,<span id="fr_64"></span>[64](kgsh5.htm#note_64.md) the Divine
Imperial Regalia, and with deep reverence placed them in the Chief
Imperial Hall, hanging the jewels, and laying out the offerings in due
order, before reciting a liturgy, called “Ōtonohogai,”<span
id="fr_65"></span>[65](kgsh5.htm#note_65.md) *i.e.*, the Ritual for
Bringing Good Fortune or invoking Blessing to the Great Palace
(mentioned in the book annexed hereto<span
id="fr_66"></span>[66](kgsh5.htm#note_66).md), then the religious service
for the Guardian Gods of the Imperial Gates was solemnized (the Ritual
being that named in the above book<span
id="fr_67"></span>[67](kgsh5.htm#note_67).md).

 At the close of these functions, the members of the Mononobe family
displayed the spears and shields to the general public, whilst those of
the Kume family serving under the Ōtomo family exhibited the weapons.
The men who represented these two families opened the gates wide to
allow those who desired to tender homage to the Central Court, and
permit them to witness the august scene, so that they might realize the
imposing majesty of the Imperial Throne.

 In those olden days, when the gods and the sovereigns were not widely
differentiated, they were wont to share the same couch, under the same
roof, so that the distinction between the two kinds of property, divine
and sovereign, not being yet observed, the storehouse attached to the
Palace called “Imikura,” *i.e.*, Sacred Treasury, was in the hereditary
charge of the Imbe family.

 Ame-no-Tomi-no-Mikoto was commanded to make the great <span
id="page_36">p. 36</span> offerings to the gods together with the
members of the different families under his rule, and after that
Ame-no-Taneko-no-Mikoto (the grandson of Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto) took a
priestly office in order to expiate the Heavenly<span
id="fr_68"></span>[68](kgsh5.htm#note_68.md) and Earthly<span
id="fr_69"></span>[69](kgsh5.htm#note_69.md) Offences (I have already
explained what the Heavenly Offences are, and as regards the details of
the Earthly Offences committed by people here on earth, see the “Ritual
of the Great Purification,”<span
id="fr_70"></span>[70](kgsh5.htm#note_70.md) customarily recited by the
Nakatomi family), and then in the Sacred Enclosure newly erected in the
Tomi Mountains, Ame-no-Tomi-no-Mikoto laid out various offerings in the
newly-built Sanctuary and recited a liturgy in honour of the Heavenly
Gods, and in deep gratitude offered to the Gods of Heaven and Earth, on
the Emperor’s behalf, thanks for the divine favours bestowed on His
Majesty. This office for the divine worship at the Imperial Court was
held by the Nakatomi and Imbe families, whilst the sacred symbolic dance
or pantomime was the hereditary duty of the Sarume<span
id="fr_71"></span>[71](kgsh5.htm#note_71.md) family of Kimi rank, and the
other families had each an hereditary right of service to the Imperial
Court.

 Whilst reigning at the Mizukaki Palace in Shiki<span
id="fr_72"></span>[72](kgsh5.htm#note_72), the Emperor (Sujin.md) began to
feel uneasy at dwelling on the same couch and under the same roof beside
the Mirror sacred to Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami and the divine Herb-quelling
Sword, and being greatly overwhelmed by their awe-inspiring divine
influence, His Majesty ordered his daughter Toyosuki-Iri-Hime-no-Mikoto
to remove these Sacred Objects to Kasanui<span
id="fr_73"></span>[73](kgsh5.htm#note_73.md) village in Yamato <span
id="page_37">p. 37</span> Province, and there established a new holy
site, or enclosure, planting sacred trees and setting up sacred stones,
in order to enshrine these Divine Emblems, and he appointed the Imperial
Princess Toyosuki-Iri-Hime-no-Mikoto to be the Guardian Priestess
thereof, and His Majesty directed the descendants of
Ishikori-tome-no-Mikoto and Ame-no-Mahitotsu-no-Kami to make a Mirror
and a Sword under the guidance of the Imbe family, like unto the
originals. The new Mirror and Sword are the identical sacred emblems
which the Imbe family offer to the Emperor at his enthronement ceremony
as the Divine Imperial Heirlooms which protect the legitimate sovereign
against powers of evil. On the evening when the solemn religious
ceremonies were conducted at the removal of the Divine Imperial Emblems,
all the courtiers were present and entertained through the whole night
at a consecrated repast, singing:

<table data-align="CENTER">

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

 In the 6th year of his reign, the same Emperor having worshipped the
Eighty Myriads of Gods, the shrines in honour of the Gods of Heaven and
Earth were erected, and land and houses alloted for the Divine
service.<span id="fr_76"></span>[76](kgsh5.htm#note_76.md) It was in the
reign of this Emperor that regular taxes were for the first time imposed
upon men and women. Men were to pay them by presenting the produce of
the hunting of wild animals in the mountains and fields, whilst women
were to pay by means of their home handicraft. Established once for all
as a State Institution, this ordinance has never been abrogated, and we
Japanese still bring to the shrines the skins of bears and deer, stags’
horns, and cloth as offerings, when worshipping the gods.

 In the days of the Emperor (Suinin) reigning at the Tamaki Palace in
Makimuku<span id="fr_77"></span>[77](kgsh5.htm#note_77.md) His Majesty
appointed Yamato-Hime-no-Mikoto (who was his second daughter by his
consort Saho-Hime<span id="fr_78"></span>[78](kgsh5.htm#note_78).md) to be
the Imperial Guardian Priestess sacred to Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami, and in
obedience to a divine revelation she erected a shrine to that Goddess
beside the River Isuzu in Ise Province, and an Abstinence Palace<span
id="fr_79"></span>[79](kgsh5.htm#note_79.md) was attached thereto in which
consecrated abode the Imperial priestess as consecrated Abbess dwelt. As
these matters were previously ordained by Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami and
Chimata-no-Kami in Heaven, they were now actually carried out on earth.
Chimata-no-Kami had already settled in Ise long before this Emperor
dedicated the Shrine of Isuzu to Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

 It was in the same Emperor’s reign that bows, arrows and swords were
first offered as votive gifts to the Gods, and land and houses again
appointed to the divine service.

 It was also in that reign that Ame-no-Hihoko,<span
id="fr_80"></span>[80](kgsh5.htm#note_80.md) a prince of Shiragi \[Silla\],
arrived in Japan, and the Grand Shrine sacred to that Korean Prince is
the Shrine in Izuehi-Kōri, Tajima Province.

 During the Emperor (Keikō)’s reign at the Hishiro Palace in
Makimuku,<span id="fr_81"></span>[81](kgsh5.htm#note_81.md) he ordered the
Imperial Prince Yamatotakeru to subdue the eastern barbarians. That
dauntless prince, making a detour, first proceeded to Ise to worship at
the Shrine of the Sun-Goddess, and there the Guardian Priestess
Yamato-Hime-no-Mikoto bestowed on him the Kusanagi Sword or Divine
Herb-quelling Sword and thus admonished him: “Be prudent and careful of
yourself, and be never remiss in your duties.”

 Prince Yamatotakeru, returning in triumph from his eastern expedition,
spent over a month in Owari Province with Miyasu-Hime as his consort.
Then, leaving the Divine Sword<span
id="fr_82"></span>[82](kgsh5.htm#note_82.md) in her charge, he went alone
on foot up Mt. Ibuki and there poisoned by the noxious vapour, died.
From that time forward the Kusanagi Sword was enshrined at Atsuta in
Owari. And to my regret the Atsuta Shrine has not enjoyed any of the
epecial privileges due to its divine honour<span
id="fr_83"></span>[83](kgsh5.htm#note_83.md).

 In the days of the Empress (Jingō) who was reigning at the
Wakasakura<span id="fr_84"></span>[84](kgsh5.htm#note_84.md) Palace in
Iware, the Gods of Suminoe<span
id="fr_85"></span>[85](kgsh5.htm#note_85.md) revealed themselves. An
expedition was sent to Shiragi \[Silla\], and <span id="page_40">p.
40</span> Shiragi was subdued. Consequently the Three Kara—nearly all
Korea—were put under Japan’s suzerainty, and especially the King of
Kudara \[Pèkché\] sincerely welcomed the Japanese authority in the
Korean peninsula and thenceforward he ever remained loyal to Japan.

 During the reign of the Emperor (Ōjin) at the Toyoakira Palace in
Karushima,<span id="fr_86"></span>[86](kgsh5.htm#note_86.md) the King<span
id="fr_87"></span>[87](kgsh5.htm#note_87.md) of Kudara \[Pèkché\] sent as
tribute to the Imperial Court a learned man named Wani \[Wang-In\], who
founded the Fumi family of Obito rank dwelling in Kōchi. Yutsuki,<span
id="fr_88"></span>[88](kgsh5.htm#note_88.md) ancestor of the Hata family of
Kimi rank, was also naturalized in Japan, with a number of people under
him who were living in his one hundred and twenty estates in Korea.
Achi-no-Omi, ancestor of the Aya family of Atae rank, arrived in Japan
and offered allegiance to the Emperor, bringing with him to the Empire
the numerous inhabitants of his seventeen estates in Korea. The
Hata<span id="fr_89"></span>[89](kgsh5.htm#note_89.md) \[Shin or Chin\] and
Aya \[Kan or Han\] immigrants, and those from Kudara, became naturalized
in this country. Each of these groups of people was numbered by tens of
thousands, nevertheless, it is most deeply to be regretted that their
services to Japan have, so far, not been publicly recognized; and, still
further, that the homage due to the divine spirits of their respective
ancestors is not yet paid with due religious ceremonies under the
auspices of the Imperial Government, although their respective shrines
were privately erected for worship by their own descendants.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

 In the reign of the Emperor (Richū) who dwelt at the
Nochi-no-Iware-Wakasakura<span id="fr_90"></span>[90](kgsh5.htm#note_90.md)
Palace in Iware, an Imperial Household Treasury beside the Sacred
Treasury<span id="fr_91"></span>[91](kgsh5.htm#note_91.md) which had
hitherto been used for both Deity and Sovereign was erected to lodge,
the Imperial Household property, because ever since the Empress Jingō’s
conquest, Korea had continued to pay tribute to Japan, and, consequently
in the course of years our national wealth had greatly increased.
Achi-no-Omi<span id="fr_92"></span>[92](kgsh5.htm#note_92.md) and the
learned sage Wani of Kudara \[Pèkché\] were therefore appointed
recording officers in charge of the Treasury accounts, and then for the
first time the institution of an hereditary corporation attached to the
Treasuries was established.

 In the days of the Emperor (Yūryaku) who reigned at the Asakura Palace
in Hatsuse,<span id="fr_93"></span>[93](kgsh5.htm#note_93.md) the members
of the Hata family became dependent on other families unrelated to their
original house. The Emperor, however, graciously favouring the Hata
chieftain, Sake-no-Kimi, who served at the Imperial Court, was pleased
to collect all the scattered members of that family and place them under
the control of Sake-no-Kimi, who with one hundred and eighty excellent
corporations of his work people, presented taxes to the Imperial Court
of fine silks, with which he filled the palace courtyard. Therefore, he
was styled “Uzumasa”<span id="fr_94"></span>[94](kgsh5.htm#note_94.md)
(This word “Uzumasa” signifies “to increase and pile up.” These fine
silks when worn are very pleasing to the skin, and so the family name
Hata or Hada meaning “skin” originated. With these <span id="page_42">p.
42</span> same silks they covered the hilt of the sacred sword when
worshipping at the Shintō shrine, and that ancient custom still remains
unchanged<span id="fr_95"></span>[95](kgsh5.htm#note_95.md). Thus we see
how the silk weaving industry was originated by the Hata family in
Japan). As years rolled on, the quantity of the tributary goods paid
into the Imperial Court from the different provinces increased
exceedingly, so that a Great Treasure-House had to be constructed for
their reception and Soga-no-Machi-no-Sukune was appointed Superintendent
of the Three Treasuries (namely, the Imikura or Sacred Treasury, the
Uchikura or Treasury of the Imperial Household, and the Ōkura or Great
Treasury<span id="fr_96"></span>[96](kgsh5.htm#note_96).md), whilst the
Hata family were entrusted with depositing, putting in and taking out
the tributary goods, and the two Fumi families on the East and West of
the Capital<span id="fr_97"></span>[97](kgsh5.htm#note_97.md) were
appointed officers in charge of the account books for the tribute
preserved in the Three Treasuries. Hence the two family names “Uchikura”
and “Ōkura” were conferred on the Aya<span
id="fr_98"></span>[98](kgsh5.htm#note_98.md) \[Kan\] family, and this is
the reason why the descendants of the Hata \[Shin\] and Aya \[Kan\]
families belong to the Kura-Be or Hereditary Corporation attached to the
Treasuries and are still entrusted with the superintendence thereof.

 When the Empress (Suiko) reigned at the Oharida Palace,<span
id="fr_99"></span>[99](kgsh5.htm#note_99.md) the descendants of Futotama
fell into insignificance, but, thanks to the Imperial grace, they were
still permitted to retain the office of a Court Shintō Priest, although
greatly reduced <span id="page_43">p. 43</span> or impoverished and far
inferior in rank to that of their ancestors.

 In the 4th year of Byakuhō<span
id="fr_100"></span>[100](kgsh5.htm#note_100) when the Emperor (Kōtoku.md)
reigned at the Toyosaki<span
id="fr_101"></span>[101](kgsh5.htm#note_101.md) Palace at Nagara<span
id="fr_102"></span>[102](kgsh5.htm#note_102.md) in Naniwa,<span
id="fr_103"></span>[103](kgsh5.htm#note_103.md) Sakashi<span
id="fr_104"></span>[104](kgsh5.htm#note_104.md) a member of the Imbe
family, holding Obito rank, whose cap grade was the Lesser Shōke<span
id="fr_105"></span>[105](kgsh5.htm#note_105.md) or Smaller Flower, was
appointed Chief of the Shintō Priests at court (the present
Jingihaku<span id="fr_106"></span>[106](kgsh5.htm#note_106.md) or
Sacerdotal Chief of Shintō), and the census registration of Imperial
Princes and Princesses, court ceremonies, marriage of Government
officals of the upper classes, divination for Emperors and the Imperial
Government were all entrusted to Sakashi. Thus the Divination
Ceremony<span id="fr_107"></span>[107](kgsh5.htm#note_107.md) for the
Emperor held at the Imperial Court twice a year—in summer and in
winter—under the guidance of the Imbe family dates back only to this
period, but, nevertheless, the descendants of Sakashi lost their power
and were by degrees ousted from, or relieved of, this important sacred
mission, and the present insignificant offical position of the Imbe
family among Court officals is the result.

 During the reign of the Emperor (Temmu) who ruled at the Kiyomihara
Palace<span id="fr_108"></span>[108](kgsh5.htm#note_108.md), the hereditary
titles of all the families were revised and re-arranged in eight
classes. To my great regret, however, the titles were bestowed in
recognition of the services then performed to the Government, without
taking into account any of the past duties rendered to the Heavenly
Grandson by the forefathers of the respective families when he descended
to <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> earth from Heaven. The second class
title “Asomi” together with a larger sword was conferred on the Nakatomi
family; and the third class title “Sukune” together with a smaller sword
was bestowed on the Imbe family. The fourth class title “Imiki” was
awarded to the three familles, Hata, Aya, and Fumi of Kudara (The title
Imiki being probably derived from the expression “Imikura,” or “Sacred
Treasury,” when it was placed in the joint charge of Imbe and Imiki.
Hence, at the Great Purification Ceremony, the two Fumi families of the
East and West or the Yamato and Kōchi Provinces are accustomed—“by use
and wont"—to present a sword to the Emperor).

 It was in the Taihō<span id="fr_109"></span>[109](kgsh5.htm#note_109.md)
Era that Japan first possessed offical records<span
id="fr_110"></span>[110](kgsh5.htm#note_110.md) of the Shintō Gods. Even
then, however, a complete list of the names of Shintō Gods and Shrines
was lacking and the national Shintō rites were not well established.
When the Government Authorities began to compile a book on the Shintō
Shrines officially registered during the Tempyō<span
id="fr_111"></span>[111](kgsh5.htm#note_111.md) Era, the Nakatomi
family,<span id="fr_112"></span>[112](kgsh5.htm#note_112.md) being then
most influential at court in religious affairs, took arbitrary measures,
strictly superintended the compilation, and consequently, the shrines,
no matter how insignificant, were all recorded in the registry, if they
had any connection with the Nakatomi, whilst, on the contrary, even the
greater, more renowned shrines, if not related to that house, were
omitted from all mention therein. Thus, the Nakatomi family, being then
all-powerful, made an unwarranted use of its <span id="page_45">p.
45</span> authority in Shintō matters to the detriment of the other
families. The Nakatomi alone enjoyed the large income derived from the
public tributes paid by the people attached to each shrine. All the
names of the divine attendants<span
id="fr_113"></span>[113](kgsh5.htm#note_113.md) who escorted the Heavenly
Grandson to earth or those who accompanied the first human Emperor<span
id="fr_114"></span>[114](kgsh5.htm#note_114.md) on his eastern expedition
mentioned in our old historical books<span
id="fr_115"></span>[115](kgsh5.htm#note_115.md) are familiar to us, and
some of them served by guarding His Majesty against his foes in
obedience to the command of the celestial deities,<span
id="fr_116"></span>[116](kgsh5.htm#note_116.md) whilst the rest rendered
distinguished services to the Emperor in aiding him to carry out his
plans for establishing Imperial rule and thus assure the prosperity of
the Empire. Therefore, each one of them should have been justly and
impartially rewarded with posthumous divine honours in recognition of
those past meritarious services, yet, to my profound regret, just as in
the case of Kaisui<span id="fr_117"></span>[117](kgsh5.htm#note_117.md)
\[Chieh-Tui\], the opposite has occurred, for in these days they do not
all receive the same divine honour of homage from the Imperial
Government. Permit me, gracious Sovereign, to mention those things which
the Authorities concerned have unfairly omitted.

 First of all, the God of the Atsuta Shrine whose divine emblem is the
Kusanagi Sword, unlike the Gods in some other shrines, has never yet
enjoyed the annual offical Government homage notwithstanding the fact
that the Sword, the Divine Heirloom of the Mikados from generation to
generation, has been enshrined at Atsuta in Owari Province, ever since
Prince Yamato-takeru <span id="page_46">p. 46</span> returned in triumph
from his eastern campaign against the Emishi or Ainu, and also that its
supernatural virtue was reported as having once defeated the
sacrilegious attempt of a foreign intruder,<span
id="fr_118"></span>[118](kgsh5.htm#note_118.md) who secretly entered the
shrine in order to steal the Sword and make off with it across to his
own land of Korea.

 Second, it is of prime importance for public morality that every one
should ceremoniously revere his own forefathers, therefore each august
Emperor,<span id="fr_119"></span>[119](kgsh5.htm#note_119.md) when he
ascends the Throne, as a rightful successor of the Great Ancestral
Goddess, pays homage to all the gods, both heavenly and earthly. Now
since Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami is the Greatest Ancestral Goddess, no Shintō
god can claim equality, just as a son is ever inferior to his father, or
a vassal to his lord. The Government Authorities of the Shintō Bureau
nowadays, however, when annually distributing offerings to the gods of
the Shintō shrines, scattered all over the land, do not take special
care to honour the Great Deity of the Ise Shrine by presenting the
sacrificial offerings from the Government first to Her who is the
highest among the gods and goddesses worshipped throughout the whole
country. Is this not a matter for deep regret?

 Third, of old, Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami, symbolized by the Sacred Mirror,
remained in the same house with the Emperor,<span
id="fr_120"></span>[120](kgsh5.htm#note_120.md) so both the Deity and the
Emperor were waited upon exactly in the same manner by the attendants
from the beginning in Heaven, there being no discrimination between the
Deity and the <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> Sovereign at all. Imbe and
Nakatomi conjointly prayed the Sun-Goddess graciously to re-appear from
the Heavenly Rock-Cave,<span
id="fr_121"></span>[121](kgsh5.htm#note_121.md) and it was the
ancestress<span id="fr_122"></span>[122](kgsh5.htm#note_122.md) of the
Sarume family who succeeded in propitiating the incensed Goddess. The
Govemment, therefore, should appoint the descendants of the three
families conjointly, to the office of Shintō service, yet nevertheless,
the Nakatomi family alone nowadays enjoy the exclusive privilege of
holding the priestly office of the Ise Shrine, the two other families
being utterly ignored.

 Fourth, ever since the Divine Age it had been the sacred prerogative of
the Imbe family to be entrusted with the offical work of constructing
Shintō shrines: thus the official head of the Imbe family, with his
kinsfolk of the Miki and Araka Districts,<span
id="fr_123"></span>[123](kgsh5.htm#note_123.md) began the work by cutting
down forest trees with consecrated axes, turning the sod with
consecrated mattocks, and finished the entire structure with the aid of
craftsmen. When completed, the shrines and their gates were consecrated
by the Imbe family with the prescribed ceremonial rites of Shintō,<span
id="fr_124"></span>[124](kgsh5.htm#note_124.md) and thus became actually
fit for divine abodes. In violation of these dear old Shintō customs and
usages, the services of the Imbe family are today wholly dispensed with,
whether for re-building the Ise Shrine or erecting the sacrcd
tabernacles<span id="fr_125"></span>[125](kgsh5.htm#note_125.md) or
pavilions for the Great Harvest Festival<span
id="fr_126"></span>[126](kgsh5.htm#note_126.md) at the enthronement of a
new Emperor. Is this not a gross injustice to the time-honoured
privilege of the Imbe family?

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

 Fifth, the Ōtonohogai or Shintō Ceremony for Blessing the Great Palace
and the Religious Service for the Guardian Gods of the Imperial Gates
were both originally entrusted to Futotama-no-Mikoto,<span
id="fr_127"></span>[127](kgsh5.htm#note_127.md) so it is beyond dispute
that the Imbe family alone should enjoy the time-honoured hierarchic
privilege in both cases of Shintō worship, while, as the Nakatomi and
the Imbe, who are the officially commissioned priests of the Shintō
Bureau, used to attend to the Shintō rites and ceremonies conjointly, an
officer of the Imperial Household Department was accustomed to report
himself in the following words: “Both Nakatomi and Imbe are present at
the August Gates in order that they may solemnize the Shintō Ceremony
for Blessing the Great Palace.” In the Hōki<span
id="fr_128"></span>[128](kgsh5.htm#note_128.md) Era, however, it was
Nakatomi-no-Asomi-Tsune of the Lower Grade of the Junior Fifth Court
Rank<span id="fr_129"></span>[129](kgsh5.htm#note_129.md) and the Third
Rank of the Imperial Household Department that arbitrarily changed the
words in the report to the Emperor, saying: “Nakatomi with Imbe<span
id="fr_130"></span>[130](kgsh5.htm#note_130.md) *under him* is now at the
August Gates.” In this way the Imbe, once placed in a position inferior
to that of the Nakatomi, have, owing to the procrastination and
negligence of the officals of the Imperial Household Department, never
been restored to their former rightful place all this time. This is a
thing that I feel keenly regrettable.

 Sixth, beginning with the Divine Age, the Nakatomi and the Imbe<span
id="fr_131"></span>[131](kgsh5.htm#note_131.md) families took equal charge
of the Shintō State Affairs, <span id="page_49">p. 49</span> and yet,
later on, the authority of one was increased at the expense of the
other. For example, at the beginning of the Enryaku Era,<span
id="fr_132"></span>[132](kgsh5.htm#note_132.md) when the Imperial Princess
Asahara<span id="fr_133"></span>[133](kgsh5.htm#note_133.md) was appointed
Guardian Priestess of the Sun-Goddess at Ise, so low a rank as the
Eighth Court Rank<span id="fr_134"></span>[134](kgsh5.htm#note_134.md) was
given afresh to the Imbe family, and they remain in that rank until now,
though like the Nakatomi they had previously held the Seventh Court
Rank—in this case by the Nakatomi and Imbe families we mean the members
of both families as Shintō priests attached to the Bureau for the
Imperial Guardian Priestess. This is, indeed, a matter of deep regret.

 Seventh, it was one of the sacred duties of both the Nakatomi and the
Imbe, to distribute sacrificial offerings to the gods and goddesses
throughout the land, but now only the Nakatomi, to the exclusion of the
Imbe family, by Government permission, enjoys the monopoly of hierarchic
authority given to the Dazaifu or Civil and War Administration
Office<span id="fr_135"></span>[135](kgsh5.htm#note_135.md) in Kyūshū. To
my great regret, this is contrary to the way among us of old.

 Eighth, it is deeply to be regretted that, to the exclusion of the Imbe
family, the Nakatomi family alone enjoys the privilege of being
entrusted with the hierarchic functions of the Greater Shrines
throughout Japan.

 Ninth, the time-honoured “Mitamashizume-no-Matsuri,” or “Chinkonsai,”
the “Spirit-quieting Ceremony for the Emperor’s Sake”<span
id="fr_136"></span>[136](kgsh5.htm#note_136.md) dates from the inspired
Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto, so it <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> is the
hereditary right of her descendants alone to hold the office of a
diviner or mediator standing between Deity and Sovereign, but now, the
same right is frequently given to members of other families. Is this not
a matter for serious regret?

 Tenth, in preparing the great offerings for the divine service the
chieftain of the Imbe family should be entrusted as formerly with the
charge of making them up, and lead all the other families to whom their
hereditary callings respectively belonged. Hence, among those serving in
the Shintō Bureau there should be officals related to such families, as
the Nakatomi, the Imbe, the Sarume, the Kagamitsukuri, the Tamatsukuri,
the Tatenui, the Kanhatori, the Shizuri, the Omi, etc., and yet, in the
present state of things, we do not find any in the same Bureau, except
the Nakatomi, the Imbe, and some few others. Those families unrelated to
the Nakatomi and the Imbe are not admitted into the service of the
Shintō Bureau, and all their descendants, not excepting even those of
divine origin,<span id="fr_137"></span>[137](kgsh5.htm#note_137.md) have
been reduced to poor and miserable circumstances, and are greatly
decreasing in number. Is this not a cause for deep regret?

 Eleventh, and lastly, in the 9th year of Shōhō,<span
id="fr_138"></span>[138](kgsh5.htm#note_138.md) the
Hidari-no-Ōtomohi-no-Tsukasa, or Left Scribe, issued a verbal order, in
the Emperor’s name, saying, “From now on the members of the Nakatomi
family alone, and not those of other families, should be appointed
Imperial Envoys to convey the sacred offerings to <span id="page_51">p.
51</span> the Ise Shrine.” It is true that this Imperial Ordinance has
never come into practice,<span
id="fr_139"></span>[139](kgsh5.htm#note_139.md) yet it did appear once in a
government document, and has not yet been rescinded. This is indeed most
regrettable.

 On one occasion in the Divine Age, when cultivating rice in a paddy
field, Ōtokonushi-no-Kami<span
id="fr_140"></span>[140](kgsh5.htm#note_140.md) served his men with beef,
while the son of the Rice-God Mitoshi-no-Kami,<span
id="fr_141"></span>[141](kgsh5.htm#note_141.md) when visiting that field,
spat in disgust upon the dainty offered to him, and returning home,
reported the matter to his father. Then Mitoshi-no-Kami in wrath sent a
number of noxious insects, or locusts, to Ōtokonushi-no-Kami’s paddy
field to kill the young rice-plants and in consequence the leafless
rice-plants appeared like “shino” or short bamboo grass. When
Ōtokonushi-no-Kami tried to ascertain the true cause of the
incomprehensible disaster, he bade a “katakannagi” or “kata-augur”<span
id="fr_142"></span>[142](kgsh5.htm#note_142.md) (by means of a Japanese
meadow bunting) and a “hiji-kannagi” or “hiji-diviner” (by means of rice
grains or a domestic cooking furnace ring now popular among us)
ascertain the divine will. The interpretation was as follows:
“Mitoshi-no-Kami has sent a curse, which makes the young rice plants
die, so that you should not fail to appease the offended God with
offerings of a white wild boar,<span
id="fr_143"></span>[143](kgsh5.htm#note_143.md) a white horse, and white
domestic fowls.” The conditions revealed in the divination being obeyed,
the God was appeased. Mitoshi-no-Kami disclosed the secret thus: “It is
I that brought the curse. Make a reel of hempenstalks, and therewith
<span id="page_52">p. 52</span> clear the rice-plants, by expelling the
locusts with the hemp leaves. Drive them out of the paddy field with
Heavenly figwort,<span id="fr_144"></span>[144](kgsh5.htm#note_144.md) and
sweep them thoroughly away with fan-shaped leopard flowers.<span
id="fr_145"></span>[145](kgsh5.htm#note_145.md) If, nevertheless, they will
not retreat, place some beef at the mouth of the ditch in the field
together with a phallic symbol (as a spell to appease the divine wrath),
and put corn-beads,<span id="fr_146"></span>[146](kgsh5.htm#note_146.md)
toothache trees,<span id="fr_147"></span>[147](kgsh5.htm#note_147.md)
walnut-leaves,<span id="fr_148"></span>[148](kgsh5.htm#note_148.md) and
salt beside the dykes.” These divine orders were obeyed, and so the
young rice-plants which, because of the divine wrath, were dying,
revived and throve, and that autumn the people’s hearts were gladdened
by an abundant rice-crop. The custom having been started,
Mitoshi-no-Kami is still worshipped in the present Shintō Bureau with
offerings of a white wild boar, a white horse, and white domestic fowls.

 Nowadays people discredit the above traditions handed down from the
Divine Age, which remind us of the Chinese legend of Pan-Ku,<span
id="fr_149"></span>[149](kgsh5.htm#note_149.md) just as a summer
insect<span id="fr_150"></span>[150](kgsh5.htm#note_150.md) does not credit
the existence of winter ice, and yet things divine or miraculous,
however incredible they may appear, are often revealed for the benefit
of a nation even in the present age of unbelief—a proof of their actual
existence. And in the ages prior to our own the Japanese civilization
not being in an advanced condition, State ceremonies were not then
perfected, and the national institutions were irregular and
unsatisfactory. Now that Your Imperial Majesty has inaugurated over our
Eight-Islands<span id="fr_151"></span>[151](kgsh5.htm#note_151.md) the
present glorious rule <span id="page_53">p. 53</span> which embodies the
ideal of the ancient Chinese Emperor Gyō \[Yao\]<span
id="fr_152"></span>[152](kgsh5.htm#note_152.md) and this New Era has
brought peace such as that which prevailed all over the Four Seas<span
id="fr_153"></span>[153](kgsh5.htm#note_153.md) under the venerable Chinese
Emperor Shun \[Shun\]; and now that Your Imperial Majesty is
endeavouring to bring the people back from the present deteriorated
manners and customs to the purity of the good old past, and reform the
imperfect system of Government, which has survived, by establishing
Government institutions, such as the circumstances now require, and
thereby preserve and propagate the essence of the fine customs of the
past among your subjects in the hope of perfecting the observance of the
ancient laws and State ceremonies by restoring the dear old customs and
usages that have now lapsed almost into oblivion, I, Your Imperial
Majesty’s humble servant, sincerely pray that Your Imperial Majesty will
be pleased to promulgate the ceremonial rules and regulations for
worshipping the Shintō gods, utilizing this opportunity, wherever the
State institutions are to be re-established, otherwise I dread that our
posterity will have cause to complain of us just as we now do of our own
forefathers. I, Your Majesty’s humble servant Hironari, instinctively
loyal to the Imperial Court and deeply revering my cherished old
traditions, being now over eighty years of age and having idled my time
away to such an advanced age,—if I should ever die suddenly without
publishing all the traditions preserved in my family in response to a
gracious Imperial special message, my poor soul would be restless in its
tomb. <span id="page_54">p. 54</span> Sometimes even the idle tales and
poor ideas circulating amongst uneducated persons are worth while
noting, therefore, Your Imperial Majesty having deigned to enquire about
my family traditions, I, Your Imperial Majesty’s humble servant, taking
advantage of this happiest opportunity, am overjoyed by the thought that
the occasion will enable me to submit all my family traditional
documents to the Imperial Throne, and I trust most sincerely that this
appeal will be honoured by Your Majesty’s gracious inspection.

 On the 13th day of the 2nd Month in the 2nd Year of Daidō.<span
