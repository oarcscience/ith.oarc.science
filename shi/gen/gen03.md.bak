**CHAPTER I**

THE CHAMBER OF KIRI <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the reign of a certain Emperor, whose
name is unknown to us, there was, among the Niogo <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2) and Kôyi <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_2.md)
of the Imperial Court, one who, though she was not of high birth,
enjoyed the full tide of Royal favor. Hence her superiors, each one of
whom had always been thinking—"I shall be the *one*," gazed upon her
disdainfully with malignant eyes, and her equals and inferiors were more
indignant still.

Such being the state of affairs, the anxiety which she had to endure was
great and constant, and this was probably the reason why her health was
at last so much affected, that she was often compelled to absent herself
from Court, and to retire to the residence of her mother.

Her father, who was a Dainagon, <span id="fr_4"></span>[3](#fn_3.md) was
dead; but her mother, being a woman of good sense, gave her every
possible guidance in the due performance of Court ceremony, so that in
this respect she seemed but little different from those whose fathers
and mothers were still alive to bring them before public notice, yet,
nevertheless, her friendliness made her oftentimes feel very diffident
from the want of any patron of influence.

These circumstances, however, only tended to make the favor shown to her
by the Emperor wax warmer and warmer, and it was even shown to such an
extent as to become a warning to after-generations. There had been
instances in China in which favoritism such as this had caused national
disturbance and disaster; and thus the matter became a subject of public

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

animadversion, and it seemed not improbable that people would begin to
allude even to the example of Yô-ki-hi. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[4](#fn_4.md)

In due course, and in consequence, we may suppose, of the Divine
blessing on the sincerity of their affection, a jewel of a little prince
was born to her. The first prince who had been born to the Emperor was
the child of Koki-den-Niogo, <span id="fr_6"></span>[5](#fn_5.md) the
daughter of the Udaijin (a great officer of State). Not only was he
first in point of age, but his influence on his mother's side was so
great that public opinion had almost unanimously fixed upon him as
heir-apparent. Of this the Emperor was fully conscious, and he only
regarded the new-born child with that affection which one lavishes on a
domestic favorite. Nevertheless, the mother of the first prince had, not
unnaturally, a foreboding that unless matters were managed adroitly her
child might be superseded by the younger one. She, we may observe, had
been established at Court before any other lady, and had more children
than one. The Emperor, therefore, was obliged to treat her with due
respect, and reproaches from her always affected him more keenly than
those of any others.

To return to her rival. Her constitution was extremely delicate, as we
have seen already, and she was surrounded by those who would fain lay
bare, so to say, her hidden scars. Her apartments in the palace were
Kiri-Tsubo (the chamber of Kiri); so called from the trees that were
planted around. In visiting her there the Emperor had to pass before
several other chambers, whose occupants universally chafed when they saw
it. And again, when it was her turn to attend upon the Emperor, it often
happened that they played off mischievous pranks upon her, at different
points in the corridor, which leads to the Imperial quarters. Sometimes
they would soil the skirts of her attendants, sometimes they would shut
against her the door of the covered portico, where no other passage
existed; and thus, in every possible way, they one and all combined to
annoy her.

The Emperor at length became aware of this, and gave her, for her
special chamber, another apartment, which was in the Kôrô-Den, and which
was quite close to those in which he himself

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

resided. It had been originally occupied by another lady who was now
removed, and thus fresh resentment was aroused.

When the young Prince was three years old the Hakamagi <span
id="fr_7"></span>[6](#fn_6.md) took place. It was celebrated with a pomp
scarcely inferior to that which adorned the investiture of the first
Prince. In fact, all available treasures were exhausted on the occasion.
And again the public manifested its disapprobation. In the summer of the
same year the Kiri-Tsubo-Kôyi became ill, and wished to retire from the
palace. The Emperor, however, who was accustomed to see her indisposed,
strove to induce her to remain. But her illness increased day by day;
and she had drooped and pined away until she was now but a shadow of her
former self. She made scarcely any response to the affectionate words
and expressions of tenderness which her Royal lover caressingly bestowed
upon her. Her eyes were half-closed: she lay like a fading flower in the
last stage of exhaustion, and she became so much enfeebled that her
mother appeared before the Emperor and entreated with tears that she
might be allowed to leave. Distracted by his vain endeavors to devise
means to aid her, the Emperor at length ordered a Te-gruma <span
id="fr_8"></span>[7](#fn_7.md) to be in readiness to convey her to her own
home, but even then he went to her apartment and cried despairingly:
"Did not we vow that we would neither of us be either before or after
the other even in travelling the last long journey of life? And can you
find it in your heart to leave me now?" Sadly and tenderly looking up,
she thus replied, with almost failing breath:–

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Since my departure for this dark journey,  
    Makes you so sad and lonely,  
  Fain would I stay though weak and weary,  
    And live for your sake only!"</span>

</div>

"Had I but known this before—"

She appeared to have much more to say, but was too weak to continue.
Overpowered with grief, the Emperor at one moment would fain accompany
her himself, and at another moment would have her remain to the end
where she then was.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

At the last, her departure was hurried, because the exorcism for the
sick had been appointed to take place on that evening at her home, and
she went. The child Prince, however, had been left in the Palace, as his
mother wished, even at that time, to make her withdrawal as privately as
possible, so as to avoid any invidious observations on the part of her
rivals. To the Emperor the night now became black with gloom. He sent
messenger after messenger to make inquiries, and could not await their
return with patience. Midnight came, and with it the sound of
lamentation. The messenger, who could do nothing else, hurried back with
the sad tidings of the truth. From that moment the mind of the Emperor
was darkened, and he confined himself to his private apartments.

He would still have kept with himself the young Prince now motherless,
but there was no precedent for this, and it was arranged that he should
be sent to his grandmother for the mourning. The child, who understood
nothing, looked with amazement at the sad countenances of the Emperor,
and of those around him. All separations have their sting, but sharp
indeed was the sting in a case like this.

Now the funeral took place. The weeping and wailing mother, who might
have longed to mingle in the same flames, <span
id="fr_9"></span>[8](#fn_8.md) entered a carriage, accompanied by female
mourners. The procession arrived at the cemetery of Otagi, and the
solemn rites commenced. What were then the thoughts of the desolate
mother? The image of her dead daughter was still vividly present to
her—still seemed animated with life. She must see her remains become
ashes to convince herself that she was really dead. During the ceremony,
an Imperial messenger came from the Palace, and invested the dead with
the title of Sammi. The letters patent were read, and listened to in
solemn silence. The Emperor conferred this title now in regret that
during her lifetime he had not even promoted her position from a Kôyi to
a Niogo, and wishing at this last moment to raise her title at least one
step higher. Once more several tokens of disapprobation were manifested
against the proceeding. But, in other respects, the beauty of the
departed, and her gracious bearing, which had ever commanded admiration,
made people begin to think of her with sympathy. It was the excess of
the Emperor's favor which had created so many detractors

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

during her lifetime; but now even rivals felt pity for her; and if any
did not, it was in the Koki-den. "When one is no more, the memory
becomes so dear," may be an illustration of a case such as this.

Some days passed, and due requiem services were carefully performed. The
Emperor was still plunged in thought, and no society had attractions for
him. His constant consolation was to send messengers to the grandmother
of the child, and to make inquiries after them. It was now autumn, and
the evening winds blew chill and cold. The Emperor—who, when he saw the
first Prince, could not refrain from thinking of the younger one—became
more thoughtful than ever; and, on this evening, he sent Yugei-no
Miôbu <span id="fr_10"></span>[9](#fn_9.md) to repeat his inquiries. She
went as the new moon just rose, and the Emperor stood and contemplated
from his veranda the prospect spread before him. At such moments he had
usually been surrounded by a few chosen friends, one of whom was almost
invariably his lost love. Now she was no more. The thrilling notes of
her music, the touching strains of her melodies, stole over him in his
dark and dreary reverie.

The Miôbu arrived at her destination; and, as she drove in, a sense of
sadness seized upon her.

The owner of the house had long been a widow; but the residence, in
former times, had been made beautiful for the pleasure of her only
daughter. Now, bereaved of this daughter, she dwelt alone; and the
grounds were overgrown with weeds, which here and there lay prostrated
by the violence of the winds; while over them, fair as elsewhere,
gleamed the mild lustre of the impartial moon. The Miôbu entered, and
was led into a front room in the southern part of the building. At first
the hostess and the messenger were equally at a loss for words. At
length the silence was broken by the hostess, who said:–

"Already have I felt that I have lived too long, but doubly do I feel it
now that I am visited by such a messenger as you." Here she paused, and
seemed unable to contend with her emotion.

"When Naishi-no-Ske returned from you," said the Miôbu, "she reported to
the Emperor that when she saw you, face to face, her sympathy for you
was irresistible. I, too, see now

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

how true it is! " A moment's hesitation, and she proceeded to deliver
the Imperial message:–

"The Emperor commanded me to say that for some time he had wandered in
his fancy, and imagined he was but in a dream; and that, though he was
now more tranquil, he could not find that it was only a dream. Again,
that there is no one who can really sympathize with him; and he hopes
that you will come to the Palace, and talk with him. His Majesty said
also that the absence of the Prince made him anxious, and that he is
desirous that you should speedily make up your mind. In giving me this
message, he did not speak with readiness. He seemed to fear to be
considered unmanly, and strove to exercise reserve. I could not help
experiencing sympathy with him, and hurried away here, almost fearing
that, perhaps, I had not quite caught his full meaning."

So saying, she presented to her a letter from the Emperor. The lady's
sight was dim and indistinct. Taking it, therefore, to the lamp, she
said, "Perhaps the light will help me to decipher," and then read as
follows, much in unison with the oral message: "I thought that time only
would assuage my grief; but time only brings before me more vividly my
recollection of the lost one. Yet, it is inevitable. How is my boy? Of
him, too, I am always thinking. Time once was when we both hoped to
bring him up together. May he still be to you a memento of his mother!"

Such was the brief outline of the letter, and it contained the
following:–

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The sound of the wind is dull and drear  
    Across Miyagi's <span id="fr_11"></span>[10](#fn_10.md) dewy lea,  
  And makes me mourn for the motherless deer  
    That sleeps beneath the Hagi tree."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> She put gently the
letter aside, and said, "Life and the world are irksome to me; and you
can see, then, how reluctantly I should present myself at the Palace. I
cannot go myself, though it is painful to me to seem to neglect the
honored command. As for the little Prince, I know not why he thought of
it. but he seems quite willing to go. This is very natural.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Please to inform
his Majesty that this is our position. Very possibly, when one remembers
the birth of the young Prince, it would not be well for him to spend too
much of his time as he does now."

Then she wrote quickly a short answer, and handed it to the Miôbu. At
this time her grandson was sleeping soundly.

"I should like to see the boy awake, and to tell the Emperor all about
him, but he will already be impatiently awaiting my return," said the
messenger. And she prepared to depart.

"It would be a relief to me to tell you how a mother laments over her
departed child. Visit me, then, sometimes, if you can, as a friend, when
you are not engaged or pressed for time. Formerly, when you came here,
your visit was ever glad and welcome; now I see in you the messenger of
woe. More and more my life seems aimless to me. From the time of my
child's birth, her father always looked forward to her being presented
at Court, and when dying he repeatedly enjoined me to carry out that
wish. You know that my daughter had no patron to watch over her, and I
well knew how difficult would be her position among her fellow-maidens.
Yet, I did not disobey her father's request, and she went to Court.
There the Emperor showed her a kindness beyond our hopes. For the sake
of that kindness she uncomplainingly endured all the cruel taunts of
envious companions. But their envy ever deepening, and her troubles ever
increasing, at last she passed away, worn out, as it were, with care.
When I think of the matter in that light, the kindest favors seem to me
fraught with misfortune. Ah! that the blind affection of a mother should
make me talk in this way!"

"The thoughts of his Majesty may he even as your own," said the Miôbu.
"Often when he alluded to his overpowering affection for her, he said
that perhaps all this might have been because their love was destined
not to last long. And that though he ever strove not to injure any
subject, yet for Kiri-Tsubo, and for her alone, he had sometimes caused
the ill-will of others; that when all this has been done, she was no
more! All this he told me in deep gloom, and added that it made him
ponder on their previous existence."

The night was now far advanced, and again the Miôbu rose to take leave.
The moon was sailing down westward and the cool breeze was waving the
herbage to and fro, in which

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

numerous *mushi* were plaintively singing. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[11](#fn_11.md) The messenger, being still somehow
unready to start, hummed–

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Fain would one weep the whole night long,  
  As weeps the Sudu-Mushi's song,  
  Who chants her melancholy lay,  
  Till night and darkness pass away."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As she still
lingered, the lady took up the refrain–

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To the heath where the Sudu-Mushi sings,  
    From beyond the clouds <span id="fr_13"></span>[12](#fn_12.md) one
comes from on high  
  And more dews on the grass around she flings,  
    And adds her own, to the night wind's sigh."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A Court dress and
a set of beautiful ornamental hairpins, which had belonged to
Kiri-Tsubo, were presented to the Miôbu by her hostess, who thought that
these things, which her daughter had left to be available on such
occasions, would be a more suitable gift, under present circumstances,
than any other.

On the return of the Miôbu she found that the Emperor had not yet
retired to rest. He was really awaiting her return, but was apparently
engaged in admiring the Tsubo-Senzai—or stands of flowers—which were
placed in front of the palaces, and in which the flowers were in full
bloom. With him were four or five ladies, his intimate friends, with
whom he was conversing. In these days his favorite topic of conversation
was the "Long Regret." <span id="fr_14"></span>[13](#fn_13.md) Nothing
pleased him more than to gaze upon the picture of that poem, which had
been painted by Prince Teishi-In, or to talk about the native poems on
the same subject, which had been composed, at the Royal command, by Ise,
the poetess, and by Tsurayuki, the poet. And it was in this way that he
was engaged on this particular evening.

To him the Miôbu now went immediately, and she faithfully reported to
him all that she had seen, and she gave to him also

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

the answer to his letter. That letter stated that the mother of
Kiri-Tsubo felt honored by his gracious inquiries, and that she was so
truly grateful that she scarcely knew how to express herself. She
proceeded to say that his condescension made her feel at liberty to
offer to him the following:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Since now no fostering love is found,  
    And the Hagi tree is dead and sere,  
  The motherless deer lies on the ground,  
    Helpless and weak, no shelter near."</span>

</div>

The Emperor strove in vain to repress his own emotion; and old memories,
dating from the time when he first saw his favorite, rose up before him
fast and thick. "How precious has been each moment to me, but yet what a
long time has elapsed since then," thought he, and he said to the Miôbu,
"How often have I, too, desired to see the daughter of the Dainagon in
such a position as her father would have desired to see her. ’Tis in
vain to speak of that now!"

A pause, and he continued, "The child, however, may survive, and fortune
may have some boon in store for him; and his grandmother's prayer should
rather be for long life."

The presents were then shown to him. "Ah," thought he, "could they be
the souvenirs sent by the once lost love," as he murmured—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Oh, could I find some wizard sprite,  
    To bear my words to her I love,  
  Beyond the shades of envious night,  
    To where she dwells in realms above!"</span>

</div>

Now the picture of beautiful Yô-ki-hi, however skilful the painter may
have been, is after all only a picture. It lacks life and animation. Her
features may have been worthily compared to the lotus and to the willow
of the Imperial gardens, but the style after all was Chinese, and to the
Emperor his lost love was all in all, nor, in his eyes, was any other
object comparable to her. Who doubts that they, too, had vowed to unite
wings, and intertwine branches! But to what end? The murmur of winds,
the music of insects, now only served to cause him melancholy.

In the meantime, in the Koki-Den was heard the sound of music. She who
dwelt there, and who had not now for a long

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

time been with the Emperor, was heedlessly protracting her strains until
this late hour of the evening.

How painfully must these have sounded to the Emperor!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Moonlight is gone, and darkness reigns  
    E’en in the realms ‘above the clouds,’  
  Ah! how can light, or tranquil peace,  
    Shine o’er that lone and lowly home!"</span>

</div>

Thus thought the Emperor, and he did not retire until "the lamps were
trimmed to the end!" The sound of the night watch of the right
guard <span id="fr_15"></span>[14](#fn_14.md) was now heard. It was five
o'clock in the morning. So, to avoid notice, he withdrew to his bedroom,
but calm slumber hardly visited his eyes. This now became a common
occurrence.

When he rose in the morning he would reflect on the time gone by when
"they knew not even that the casement was bright." But now, too, he
would neglect "Morning Court." His appetite failed him. The delicacies
of the so-called "great table" had no temptation for him. Men pitied him
much. "There must have been some divine mystery that predetermined the
course of their love," said they, "for in matters in which she is
concerned he is powerless to reason, and wisdom deserts him. The welfare
of the State ceases to interest him." And now people actually began to
quote instances that had occurred in a foreign Court.

Weeks and months had elapsed, and the son of Kiri-Tsubo was again at the
Palace. In the spring of the following year the first Prince was
proclaimed heir-apparent to the throne. Had the Emperor consulted his
private feelings, he would have substituted the younger Prince for the
elder one. But this was not possible, and, especially for this
reason:—There was no influential party to support him, and, moreover,
public opinion would also have been strongly opposed to such a measure,
which, if effected by arbitrary power, would have become a source of
danger. The Emperor, therefore, betrayed no such desire, and repressed
all outward appearance of it. And now the public expressed its
satisfaction at the self-restraint of the Emperor, and the mother of the
first Prince felt at ease.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

In this year, the mother of Kiri-Tsubo departed this life. She may not
improbably have longed to follow her daughter at an earlier period; and
the only regret to which she gave utterance, was that she was forced to
leave her grandson, whom she had so tenderly loved.

From this time the young Prince took up his residence in the Imperial
palace; and next year, at the age of seven, he began to learn to read
and write under the personal superintendence of the Emperor. He now
began to take him into the private apartments, among others, of the
Koki-den, saying, "The mother is gone! now at least, let the child be
received with better feeling."And if even stony-hearted warriors, or
bitter enemies, if any such there were, smiled when they saw the boy,
the mother of the heir-apparent, too, could not entirely exclude him
from her sympathies. This lady had two daughters, and they found in
their half-brother a pleasant playmate. Every one was pleased to greet
him, and there was already a winning coquetry in his manners, which
amused people, and made them like to play with him. We need not allude
to his studies in detail, but on musical instruments, such as the flute
and the *koto*, <span id="fr_16"></span>[15](#fn_15.md) he also showed
great proficiency.

About this time there arrived an embassy from Corea, and among them was
an excellent physiognomist. When the Emperor heard of this, he wished to
have the Prince examined by him. It was, however, contrary to the
warnings of the Emperor Wuda, to call in foreigners to the Palace. The
Prince was, therefore, disguised as the son of one Udaiben, his
instructor, with whom he was sent to the Kôro-Kwan, where foreign
embassies are entertained.

When the physiognomist saw him, he was amazed, and, turning his own head
from side to side, seemed at first to be unable to comprehend the lines
of his features, and then said, "His physiognomy argues that he might
ascend to the highest position in the State, but, in that case, his
reign will be disturbed, and many misfortunes will ensue. If, however,
his position should only be that of a great personage in the country,
his fortune may be different.

This Udaiben was a clever scholar. He had with the Corean pleasant
conversations, and they also interchanged

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

with one another some Chinese poems, in one of which the Corean said
what great pleasure it had given him to have seen before his departure,
which was now imminent, a youth of such remarkable promise. The Coreans
made some valuable presents to the Prince, who had also composed a few
lines, and to them, too, many costly gifts were offered from the
Imperial treasures.

In spite of all the precautions which were taken to keep all this
rigidly secret, it did, somehow or other, become known to others, and
among those to the Udaijin, who, not unnaturally, viewed it with
suspicion, and began to entertain doubts of the Emperor's intentions.
The latter, however, acted with great prudence. It must be remembered
that, as yet, he had not even created the boy a Royal Prince. He now
sent for a native physiognomist, who approved of his delay in doing so,
and whose observations to this effect, the Emperor did not receive
unfavorably. He wisely thought to be a Royal Prince, without having any
influential support on the mother's side, would be of no real advantage
to his son. Moreover, his own tenure of power seemed precarious, and he,
therefore, thought it better for his own dynasty, as well as for the
Prince, to keep him in a private station, and to constitute him an
outside supporter of the Royal cause.

And now he took more and more pains with his education in different
branches of learning; and the more the boy studied, the more talent did
he evince—talent almost too great for one destined to remain in a
private station. Nevertheless, as we have said, suspicions would have
been aroused had Royal rank been conferred upon him, and the
astrologists, whom also the Emperor consulted, having expressed their
disapproval of such a measure, the Emperor finally made up his mind to
create a new family. To this family he assigned the name of Gen, and he
made the young Prince the founder of it. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[16](#fn_16.md)

Some time had now elapsed since the death of the Emperor's favorite, but
he was still often haunted by her image. Ladies were introduced into his
presence, in order, if possible, to divert his attention, but without
success.

There was, however, living at this time a young Princess, the fourth
child of a late Emperor. She had great promise of

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

beauty, and was guarded with jealous care by her mother, the
Empress-Dowager. The Naishi-no-Ske, who had been at the Court from the
time of the said Emperor, was intimately acquainted with the Empress and
familiar with the Princess, her daughter, from her very childhood. This
person now recommended the Emperor to see the Princess, because her
features closely resembled those of Kiri-Tsubo.

"I have now fulfilled," she said, "the duties of my office under three
reigns, and, as yet, I have seen but one person who resembles the
departed. The daughter of the Empress-Dowager does resemble her, and she
is singularly beautiful."

"There may be some truth in this," thought the Emperor, and he began to
regard her with awakening interest. This was related to the
Empress-Dowager. She, however, gave no encouragement whatever to the
idea. "How terrible! " she said. "Do we not remember the cruel harshness
of the mother of the Heir-apparent, which hastened the fate of
Kiri-Tsubo!"

While thus discountenancing any intimacy between her daughter and the
Emperor, she too died, and the princess was left parentless. The Emperor
acted with great kindness, and intimated his wish to regard her as his
own daughter. In consequence of this her guardian, and her brother,
Prince Hiôb-Kiô, considering that life at Court would be better for her
and more attractive for her than the quiet of her own home, obtained for
her an introduction there.

She was styled the Princess Fuji-Tsubo (of the Chamber of Wistaria),
from the name of the chamber which was assigned to her.

There was, indeed, both in features and manners a strange resemblance
between her and Kiri-Tsubo. The rivals of the latter constantly caused
pain both to herself and to the Emperor; but the illustrious birth of
the Princess prevented any one from ever daring to humiliate her, and
she uniformly maintained the dignity of her position. And to her alas!
the Emperor's thoughts were now gradually drawn, though he could not yet
be said to have forgotten Kiri-Tsubo.

The young Prince, whom we now style Genji (the Gen), was still with the
Emperor, and passed his time pleasantly enough in visiting the various
apartments where the inmates of the palace resided. He found the
companionship of all of them

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

sufficiently agreeable; but beside the many who were now of maturer
years, there was one who was still in the bloom of her youthful beauty,
and who more particularly caught his fancy, the Princess Wistaria. He
had no recollection of his mother, but he had been told by Naishi-no-Ske
that this lady was exceedingly like her; and for this reason he often
yearned to see her and to be with her.

The Emperor showed equal affection to both of them, and he sometimes
told her that he hoped she would not treat the boy with coldness or
think him forward. He said that his affection for the one made him feel
the same for the other too, and that the mutual resemblance of her own
and of his mother's face easily accounted for Genji's partiality to her.
And thus as a result of this generous feeling on the part of the
Emperor, a warmer tinge was gradually imparted both to the boyish humor
and to the awakening sentiment of the young Prince.

The mother of the Heir-apparent was not unnaturally averse to the
Princess, and this revived her old antipathy to Genji also. The beauty
of her son, the Heir-apparent, though remarkable, could not be compared
to his, and so bright and radiant was his face that Genji was called by
the public Hikal-Genji-no-Kimi (the shining Prince Gen).

When he attained the age of twelve the ceremony of Gem-buk <span
id="fr_18"></span>[17](#fn_17) (or crowning.md) took place. This was also
performed with all possible magnificence. Various *fêtes*, which were to
take place in public, were arranged by special order by responsible
officers of the Household. The Royal chair was placed in the Eastern
wing of the Seiriô-Den, where the Emperor dwells, and in front of it
were the seats of the hero of the ceremony and of the Sadaijin, who was
to crown him and to regulate the ceremonial.

About ten o'clock in the forenoon Genji appeared on the scene. The
boyish style of his hair and dress excellently became his features; and
it almost seemed matter for regret that it should be altered. The
Okura-Kiô-Kurahito, whose office it was to rearrange the hair of Genji,
faltered as he did so. As to the Emperor, a sudden thought stole into
his mind. "Ah! could his mother but have lived to have seen him now!"

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This thought,
however, he at once suppressed. After he had been crowned the Prince
withdrew to a dressing-room, where he attired himself in the full robes
of manhood. Then descending to the Court-yard he performed a measured
dance in grateful acknowledgment. This he did with so much grace and
skill that all present were filled with admiration; and his beauty,
which some feared might be lessened, seemed only more remarkable from
the change. And the Emperor, who had before tried to resist them, now
found old memories irresistible.

Sadaijin had by his wife, who was a Royal Princess, an only daughter.
The Heir-apparent had taken some notice of her, but her father did not
encourage him. He had, on the other hand, some idea of Genji, and had
sounded the Emperor on the subject. He regarded the idea with favor, and
especially on the ground that such a union would be of advantage to
Genji, who had not yet any influential supporters.

Now all the Court and the distinguished visitors were assembled in the
palace, where a great festival was held; Genji occupied a seat next to
that of the Royal Princess. During the entertainment Sadaijin whispered
something several times into his ear, but he was too young and diffident
to make any answer.

Sadaijin was now summoned before the dais of the Emperor, and, according
to custom, an Imperial gift, a white Ô-Uchiki (grand robe), and a suit
of silk vestments were presented to him by a lady. Then proffering his
own wine-cup, the Emperor addressed him thus:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In the first hair-knot <span
id="fr_19"></span>[18](#fn_18.md) of youth,  
  Let love that lasts for age be bound!"</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This evidently
implied an idea of matrimony. Sadaijin feigned surprise and responded:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Aye! if the purple <span
id="fr_20"></span>[19](#fn_19.md) of the cord,  
  I bound so anxiously, endure!"</span>

</div>

He then descended into the Court-yard, and gave expression to his thanks
in the same manner in which Genji had previously

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

done. A horse from the Imperial stables and a falcon from the
Kurand-Dokoro <span id="fr_21"></span>[20](#fn_20.md) were on view in the
yard, and were now presented to him. The princes and nobles were all
gathered together in front of the grand staircase, and appropriate gifts
were also presented to each one of them. Among the crowd baskets and
trays of fruits and delicacies were distributed by the Emperor's order,
under the direction of Udaiben; and more rice-cakes and other things
were given away now than at the Gembuk of the Heir-apparent.

In the evening the young Prince went to the mansion of the Sadaijin,
where the espousal with the young daughter of the latter was celebrated
with much splendor. The youthfulness of the beautiful boy was well
pleasing to Sadaijin; but the bride, who was some years older than he
was, and who considered the disparity in their age to be unsuitable,
blushed when she thought of it.

Not only was this Sadaijin himself a distinguished personage in the
State, but his wife was also the sister of the Emperor by the same
mother, the late Empress; and her rank therefore was unequivocal. When
to this we add the union of their daughter with Genji, it was easy to
understand that the influence of Udaijin, the grandfather of the
Heir-apparent, and who therefore seemed likely to attain great power,
was not after all of very much moment.

Sadaijin had several children. One of them, who was the issue of his
Royal wife, was the Kurand Shiôshiô.

Udaijin was not, for political reasons, on good terms with this family;
but nevertheless he did not wish to estrange the youthful Kurand. On the
contrary, he endeavored to establish friendly relations with him, as was
indeed desirable, and he went so far as to introduce him to his fourth
daughter, the younger sister of the Koki-Den.

Genji still resided in the palace, where his society was a source of
much pleasure to the Emperor, and he did not take up his abode in a
private house. Indeed, his bride, Lady Aoi (Lady Hollyhock), though her
position insured her every attention from others, had few charms for
him, and the Princess Wistaria much more frequently occupied his
thoughts. "How pleasant her society, and how few like her!" he was
always

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

thinking; and a hidden bitterness blended with his constant reveries.

The years rolled on, and Genji being now older was no longer allowed to
continue his visits to the private rooms of the Princess as before. But
the pleasure of overhearing her sweet voice, as its strains flowed
occasionally through the curtained casement, and blended with the music
of the flute and *koto*, made him still glad to reside in the Palace.
Under these circumstances he seldom visited the home of his bride,
sometimes only for a day or two after an absence of five or six at
Court.

His father-in-law, however, did not attach much importance to this, on
account of his youth; and whenever they did receive a visit from him,
pleasant companions were invited to meet him, and various games likely
to suit his taste were provided for his entertainment.

In the Palace, Shigeisa, his late mother's quarters, was allotted to
him, and those who had waited on her waited on him. The private house,
where his grandmother had resided, was beautifully repaired for him by
the Shuri Takmi—the Imperial Repairing Committee—in obedience to the
wishes of the Emperor. In addition to the original loveliness of the
landscape and the noble forest ranges, the basin of the lake was now
enlarged, and similar improvements were effected throughout with the
greatest pains. "Oh, how delightful would it not be to be in a place
like that which such an one as one might choose!" thought Genji within
himself.

We may here also note that the name Hikal Genji is said to have been
originated by the Corean who examined his physiognomy.
