**CHAPTER IX**

HOLLYHOCK

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Emperor has at last abdicated his
throne, as he has long intended, in favor of the Heir-apparent, and the
only child of the Princess Wistaria is made Heir-apparent to the new
Emperor.

The ex-Emperor now lived in a private palace with this Princess in a
less royal style; and the Niogo of Kokiden, to whom was given the
honorary title of ex-Empress, resided in the Imperial Palace with the
Emperor, her son, and took up a conspicuous position. The ex-Emperor
still felt some anxiety about the Heir-apparent, and appointed Genji as
his guardian, as he had not yet a suitable person for that office.

This change in the reigning Emperor, and the gradual advancement of
Genji's position, gave the latter greater responsibility, and he had to
restrain his wandering.

Now, according to usage, the Saigû <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)
and Saiin <span id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_80.md) were selected; for the
latter the second sister of the Emperor was chosen, and for the former
the only daughter of the Lady of Rokjiô, whose husband had been a Royal
Prince.

The day of the departure of the Saigû for Ise was not yet fixed; and the
mind of her mother, who had some reasons for dissatisfaction with Genji,
was still wavering in her indecision, whether or not she should go to
Ise with her daughter.

The case of the Saiin, however, was different, and the day of her
installation was soon fixed. She was the favorite child of her mother as
well as of her father, and the ceremonies for the day of consecration
were arranged with especial splendor. The number of persons who take a
share in the procession on this occasion is defined by regulations; yet
the selection of this number was most carefully made from the most
fashionable

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

of the nobles of the time, and their dresses and saddles were all chosen
of beautiful appearance. Genji was also directed by special order to
take part in the ceremony.

As the occasion was expected to be magnificent, every class of the
people showed great eagerness to witness the scene, and a great number
of stands were erected all along the road. The day thus looked forward
to at last arrived.

Lady Aoi seldom showed herself on such occasions; besides, she was now
in a delicate state of health, near her confinement, and had, therefore,
no inclination to go out. Her attendants, however, suggested to her that
she ought to go. "It is a great pity," they said, "not to see it; people
come from a long distance to see it." Her mother also said, "You seem
better today. I think you had better go. Take these girls with you."

Being pressed in this way, she hastily made up her mind, and went with a
train of carriages. All the road was thronged by multitudes of people,
many dressed in a style which is called Tsubo-Shôzok. Many of great age
prostrated themselves in an attitude of adoration, and many others,
notwithstanding their natural plainness, looked almost blooming, from
the joy expressed in their countenances—nay, even nuns and aged women,
from their retreats, were to be seen amongst them. Numerous carriages
were also squeezed closely together, so that the broad thoroughfare of
the Ichijiô road was made almost spaceless. When, however, the carriages
of the Lady Aoi's party appeared, her attendants ordered several others
to make way, and forced a passage to the spot where the best view could
be obtained, and where the common people were not allowed. Among these
happened to be two *ajir*o <span id="fr_82"></span>[3](#fn_81.md)
carriages, and their inmates were plainly incognito and persons of rank.

These belonged to the party of the Lady of Rokjiö. When these carriages
were forced to give place, their attendants cried out, "These carriages
do not belong to people who ought to be so abruptly forced away." But
the attendants of the Lady Aoi, who were slightly under the influence of
drink, would not listen to their expostulations, and they at last made
their way and took up their position, pushing the other two back where
nothing could be seen, even breaking their poles.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

The lady so maltreated was of course extremely indignant, and she would
fain have gone home without seeing the spectacle, but there was no
passage for retiring. Meanwhile the approach of the procession was
announced, and only this calmed her a little.

Genji was as usual conspicuous in the procession. There were several
carriages along the roads on whose occupants his glance was cast; that
of Lady Aoi, however, was the most striking, and as he passed by the
attendants saluted him courteously, which act Genji acknowledged. What
were the feelings of the Lady of Rokjiô, who had been driven back, at
this moment!

In due course the procession passed, and the exciting scene of the day
was over. The quarrels about the carriage naturally came to the ears of
Genji. He thought that Lady Aoi was too modest to be the instigator of
such a dispute; but her house was one of great and powerful families
famous for overweening pride, a tendency shared by its domestics; and
they, for other motives, also of rivalry, were glad to have an
opportunity of mortifying the Lady of Rokjiô.

He felt for the wounded lady, and hastened to see her; but she, under
some pretext, refused to see him.

The day of the hollyhock *fête* of the same temple came. It was
especially grand, as it was the first one after the installation of the
new Saiin, but neither Lady Aoi or the Lady of Rokjiô was present, while
Genji privately took Violet with him in a close carriage to see the
festival, and saw the horse-races.

We have already mentioned that the mind of the Lady of Rokjiô was still
wavering and unsettled whether or not she should go to Ise with her
daughter; and this state of mind became more and more augmented and
serious after the day of the dispute about the carriages, which made her
feel a bitter disdain and jealousy towards the Lady Aoi. Strange to say,
that from about the same time, Lady Aoi became ill, and began to suffer
from spiritual influences. All sorts of exorcisms were duly performed,
and some spirits came forth and gave their names. But among them was a
spirit, apparently a "living one," <span id="fr_83"></span>[4](#fn_82.md)
which obstinately refused to be transmitted to the

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

third party. It caused her great suffering, and seemed not to be of a
casual nature, but a permanent hostile influence. Some imagined this to
be the effect of fearful jealousy of some one who was intimately known
to Genji and who had most influence over him; but the spirit gave no
information to this effect. Hence some even surmised that the wandering
spirit of some aged nurse, or the like, long since dead, still haunted
the mansion, and might have seized the opportunity of the lady's
delicate health, and taken possession of her. Meanwhile at the mansion
of Rokjiô, the lady, when she was informed of the sufferings of Lady
Aoi, felt somewhat for her, and began to experience a sort of
compassion.

This became stronger when she was told that the sufferings of the Lady
Aoi were owing to some living spirit. She thought that she never wished
any evil to her; but, when she reflected, there were several times when
she began to think that a wounded spirit, such as her own, might have
some influence of the kind. She had sometimes dreams, after weary
thinking, between slumber and waking, in which she seemed to fly to some
beautiful girl, apparently Lady Aoi, and to engage in bitter contention
and struggle with her. She became even terrified at these dreams; but
yet they took place very often. "Even in ordinary matters," she thought,
"it is too common a practice, to say nothing of the good done by people,
but to exaggerate the bad; and so, in such cases, if it should be
rumored that mine was that living spirit which tormented

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lady Aoi, how
trying it would be to me! It is no rare occurrence that one's
disembodied spirit, after death, should wander about; but even that is
not a very agreeable idea. How much more, then, must it be disagreeable
to have the repute that one's living spirit was inflicting pain upon
another!"

These thoughts still preyed upon her mind, and made her listless and
depressed.

In due course, the confinement of Lady Aoi approached. At the same time,
the jealous spirit still vexed her, and now more vigorous exorcising was
employed. She became much affected by it, and cried out, "Please release
me a little; I have something to tell the Prince."

Hereupon he was ushered into the room. The curtain was dropped, and the
mother of the lady left the room, as she thought her daughter might
prefer to speak to him in private. The sound of the spells performed in
the next chamber ceased, and Hoke-kiô was read in its place. The lady
was lying on her couch, dressed in a pure white garment, with her long
tresses unfastened. He approached her, and taking her hand, said: "What
sad affliction you cause us!" She then lifted her heavy eyelids, and
gazed on Genji for some minutes.

He tried to soothe her, and said, "Pray don't trouble yourself too much
about matters. Everything will come right. Your illness, I think, will
soon pass away. Even supposing you quit this present world, there is
another where we shall meet, and where I shall see you once more
cheerful, and there will be a time when your mother and father will also
join you."

"Ah! no. I only come here to solicit you to give me a little rest. I
feel extremely disturbed. I never thought of coming here in such a way;
but it seems the spirit of one whose thoughts are much disconcerted
wanders away unknown even to itself.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Oh, bind my wandering spirit, pray,  
Dear one, nor let it longer stray."</span>

</div>

The enunciation of these words was not that of Lady Aoi herself; and
when Genji came to reflect, it clearly belonged to the Lady of Rokjiô.
Always before, when anyone had talked with him about a living spirit
coming to vex Lady Aoi, he felt inclined to suppress such ideas; but now
he began to think that

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

such things might really happen, and he felt disturbed. "You speak
thus," said Genji, as if he was addressing the spirit, "but you do not
tell me who you are. Do, therefore, tell me clearly." At these words,
strange to say, the face of the Lady Aoi seemed momentarily to assume
the likeness of that of Rokjiô. On this, Genji was still more perplexed
and anxious, and put a stop to the colloquy. Presently she became very
calm, and people thought that she was a little relieved. Soon after
this, the lady was safely delivered of a child.

Now, to perform due thanksgiving for this happy deliverance, the head of
the monastery on Mount Hiye and some other distinguished priests were
sent for. They came in all haste, wiping off the perspiration from their
faces as they journeyed; and, from the Emperor and Royal princes down to
the ordinary nobles, all took an interest in the ceremony of Ubyashinai
(first feeding), and the more so as the child was a boy.

To return to the Lady of Rokjiô. When she heard of the safe delivery of
Lady Aoi, a slightly jealous feeling once more seemed to vex her; and
when she began to move about, she could not understand how it was, but
she perceived that her dress was scented with a strange odor. <span
id="fr_84"></span>[5](#fn_83.md) She thought this most surprising, and took
baths and changed her dress, in order to get rid of it; but the odor
soon returned, and she was disgusted with herself.

Some days passed, and the day of autumn appointments arrived. By this
time, Lady Aoi's health seemed progressing favorably, and Genji left her
in order to attend the Court.

When he said good-by to her, there was a strange and unusual look in her
eyes. Sadaijin also went to Court, as well as his sons, who had some
expectation of promotion, and there were few people left in the mansion.

It was in the evening of that day that Lady Aoi was suddenly attacked by
a spasm, and before the news of this could be carried to the Court, she
died.

These sad tidings soon reached the Court, and created great distress and
confusion: even the arrangements for appointments and promotion were
disturbed. As it happened late in

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

the evening there was no time to send for the head of the monastery, or
any other distinguished priest. Messengers of inquiry came one after
another to the mansion, so numerous that it was almost impossible to
return them all answers. We need not add how greatly affected were all
her relations.

As the death took place from a malign spiritual influence, she was left
untouched during two or three days, in the hope that she might revive;
but no change took place, and now all hope was abandoned. In due course
the corpse was taken to the cemetery of Toribeno. Numerous mourners and
priests of different churches crowded to the spot, while representatives
of the ex-Emperor, Princess Wistaria, and the Heir-apparent also were
present. The ceremony of burial was performed with all solemnity and
pathos.

Thus the modest and virtuous Lady Aoi passed away forever.

Genji forthwith confined himself to his apartment in the grand mansion
of Sadaijin, for mourning and consolation. Tô-no-Chiûjiô, who was now
elevated to the title of Sammi, constantly bore him company, and
conversed with him both on serious and amusing subjects. Their struggle
in the apartment of Gen-naishi, and also their rencontre in the garden
of the "Saffron Flower," were among the topics of their consoling
conversation.

It was on one of these occasions that a soft shower of rain was falling.
The evening was rendered cheerless, and Tô-no-Chiûjiô came to see him,
walking slowly in his mourning robes of a dull color. Genji was leaning
out of a window, his cheek resting on his hand; and, looking out upon
the half-fading shrubberies, was humming—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Has she become rain or cloud?  
  ’Tis now unknown."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Tô-no-Chiûjiô
gently approached him. They had, as usual, some pathetic conversation,
and then the latter hummed, as if to himself—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Beyond the cloud in yonder sky,  
    From which descends the passing rain,  
  Her gentle soul may dwell,  
    Though we may cease to trace its form in vain."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

This was soon responded to by Genji:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That cloudy shrine we view on high,  
    Where my lost love may dwell unseen,  
  Looks gloomy now to this sad eye  
    That looks with tears on what has been."</span>

</div>

There was among the faded plants of the garden a solitary
Rindô-nadeshko. <span id="fr_85"></span>[6](#fn_84.md) When Tô-no-Chiûjiô
had gone, Genji picked this flower, and sent it to his mother-in-law by
the nurse of the infant child, with the following:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In bowers where all beside are dead  
    Survives alone this lovely flower,  
  Departed autumn's cherished gem,  
    Symbol of joy's departed hour." <span
id="fr_86"></span>[7](#fn_85.md)</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Genji still felt
lonely. He wrote a letter to the Princess Momo-zono (peach-gardens). He
had known her long. He admired her, too. She had been a spectator, with
her father, on the day of the consecration of the Saiin, and was one of
those to whom the appearance of Genji was most welcome. In his letter he
stated that she might have a little sympathy with him in his sorrow, and
he also sent with it the following:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Many an autumn have I past  
    In gloomy thought, but none I ween  
  Has been so mournful as the last,  
    Which rife with grief and change hath been."</span>

</div>

There was, indeed, nothing serious between Genji and this princess; yet,
as far as correspondence was concerned, they now and then exchanged
letters, so she did not object to receiving this communication. She felt
for him much, and an answer was returned, in which she expressed her
sympathy at his bereavement.

Now, in the mansion of Sadaijin every performance of requiem was
celebrated. The forty-ninth day had passed, and the mementoes of the
dead, both trifling and valuable, were distributed in a due and
agreeable manner; and Genji at length left the grand mansion with the
intention of first going to the ex-Emperor, and then of returning to his
mansion at Nijiô. After his departure, Sadaijin went into the apartment
occupied till lately by him. The room was the same as before, and

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

everything was unchanged; but his only daughter, the pride of his old
days, was no more, and his son-in-law had gone too.

He looked around him for some moments. He saw some papers lying about.
They were those on which Genji had been practising penmanship for
amusement—some in Chinese, others in Japanese; some in free style,
others in stiff. Among these papers he saw one on which the words "Old
pillows and old quilts" were written, and close to these the following:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"How much the soul departed, still  
    May love to linger round this couch,  
  My own heart tells me, even I  
    Reluctant am to leave it now."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And on another of
these papers, accompanying the words, "The white frost lies upon the
tiles," the following:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"How many more of nights shall I  
  On this lone bed without thee lie;  
  The flower has left its well-known bed,  
  And o’er its place the dews are shed."</span>

</div>

As Sadaijin was turning over these papers a withered flower, which seems
to have marked some particular occasion, dropped from amongst them.

Return we now to Genji. He went to the ex-Emperor, to whom he still
seemed thin and careworn. He had some affectionate conversation with
him, remained till evening, and then proceeded to his mansion at Nijiô.
He went to the western wing to visit the young Violet. All were habited
in new winter apparel, and looked fresh and blooming.

"How long it seems since I saw you!" he exclaimed. Violet turned her
glance a little aside. She was apparently shy, which only increased her
beauty.

He approached, and after having a little conversation, said, "I have
many things to say to you, but now I must have a little rest," and
returned to his own quarters.

The next morning, first of all he sent a letter to Sadaijin's, making
inquiry after his infant child.

At this time he confined himself more than usual to his own house, and
for companionship he was constantly with Violet, who was now approaching
womanhood. He would sometimes talk with her differently from the manner
in which he would speak to a mere girl; but on her part she seemed not
to notice

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

the difference, and for their daily amusement either Go or
[Hentski](errata.htm#0) <span id="fr_87"></span>[8](#fn_86.md) was resorted
to, and sometimes they would play on till late in the evening.

Some weeks thus passed away, and there was one morning when Violet did
not appear so early as usual. The inmates of the house, who did not know
what was the reason, were anxious about her, thinking she was
indisposed. About noon Genji came. He entered the little room, saying,
"Are you not quite well? Perhaps you would like to play at Go again,
like last night, for a change;" but she was more than ever shy.

"Why are you so shy?" he exclaimed; "be a little more cheerful—people
may think it strange," said he, and stayed with her a long time trying
to soothe her; but to no effect—she still continued silent and shy.

This was the evening of Wild Boar's day, and some *mochi* (pounded rice
cake) was presented to him, according to custom, on a tray of plain
white wood.

He called Koremitz before him and said, "To-day is not a very opportune
day; I would rather have them to-morrow evening. Do send in some
to-morrow. <span id="fr_88"></span>[9](#fn_87.md) It need not be of so many
colors." So saying, he smiled a little, and sharp Koremitz soon
understood what he meant. And this he accordingly did on the morrow, on
a beautiful flower-waiter.

Up to this time nothing about Violet had been publicly known, and Genji
thought it was time to inform her father about his daughter; but he
considered he had better have the ceremony of Mogi first performed, and
ordered preparations to be made with that object.

Let us here notice that the young daughter of Udaijin, after she saw
Genji, was longing to see him again. This inclination was perceived by
her relations. It seems that her father was not quite averse to this
liking, and he told his eldest daughter, the reigning Emperor's mother,
that Genji was recently bereaved of his good consort, and that he should
not feel discontented if his daughter were to take the place of Lady
Aoi; but this the royal mother did not approve. "It would be far better
for her to be introduced at Court," she said, and began contriving to
bring this about.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[149:4](gen11.htm#fr_83.md) Before proceeding with
the story, it is necessary for the reader to peruse the following note:
In Japan there existed. and still more or less exists, a certain
superstition which is entertained, that the spirits of the dead have the
power of inflicting injury on mankind; for instance, a woman when
slighted or deserted, <span id="page_150">p. 150</span> dies, her spirit
often works evil on the man who forsook her, or on her rival. This is
the spirit of the dead. There is also another belief that the spirits of
the living have sometimes the same power, but in this case it only takes
place when one is fiercely jealous. When this spirit works upon the
rival, the owner of the spirit is not aware of it; but she herself
becomes more gloomy, as if she had, as it were, lost her own spirit.
These spirits can be exorcised, and the act is performed by a certain
sect of priests; but the living one is considered far more difficult to
exorcise than the other, because it is imagined that the dead spirit can
be easily "laid," or driven back to the tomb, while the living one,
being still in its present state, cannot be settled so easily. The
method of exorcism is as follows: Certain spells are used on the
sufferer, and certain religious addresses are read from the Buddhist
bibles, and then the sufferer is made to speak out all his subjects of
complaint; but it is supposed not to be the man himself who speaks and
tells these causes of complaint, but the spirit of which he is
possessed. This process is sometimes performed on a third party; in that
case the priest temporarily transmits the spirit from the sufferer to
the substitute and makes it speak with his mouth. When he has told all
the causes of his complaint and wrongs, the priest sometimes argues with
him, sometimes chides, sometimes soothes, and sometimes threatens, and
at last says to the spirit, "If you do not go out quietly, I will
confine you by my sacred power." By such means the spirit is exorcised;
the process resembles mesmerism in some points, but of course has no
sensible foundation. In other cases the spirits of those who have either
recently, or even years before, met with cruel wrongs or death, may in
their wanderings seize upon some person in the vicinity, though totally
unconnected with the crime done upon them, and may cause them suffering,
or even spirits, who from any cause, are unable to obtain rest, may do
the same thing.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[152:5](gen11.htm#fr_84.md) In the ceremony of
exorcism a sacred perfume is burnt, and it was this scent which the Lady
of Rokjiô perceived in her garment because her spirit was supposed to go
to and fro between herself and Lady Aoi, and to bring with it the smell
of this perfume.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[154:6](gen11.htm#fr_85.md) A kind of pink; some
translate it Gentian.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[154:7](gen11.htm#fr_86.md) Here the flower is
compared to the child, and autumn to the mother.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[156:8](gen11.htm#fr_87.md) "Hentski," a children's
game. It consists in choosing beforehand a "hen" or half-character,
opening a book and seeing which of the players can most quickly pick out
the words beginning with this "hen."

<span id="fn_87"></span>[156:9](gen11.htm#fr_88.md) It seemed to have been
the ancient custom, that on the third night of a wedding, the same kind
of rice cake, but only of one color, was served up.
