{Transcription note: in this text, long Japanese vowels are indicated by
the circumflex rather than the macron as in the original typography, due
to the limitations of the standard HTML character set. The circumflex
vowels in transliterated Sanskrit terms are verbatim from the original.
Page numbers for blank pages in the original are not inserted in the
transcription, this explains page numbering gaps. Also note that Hearn
uses ellipsis (...) throughout this text as a stylistic device: this
does *not* indicate missing material.--JBH}
