### LATER TOKUGAWA PERIOD

1700-1850 A.D.

THE Tokugawas, in their eagerness for consolidation and discipline,
crushed out the vital spark from art and life. It was only their
educational institutions which in later days reached the lower classes,
and to some slight extent redeemed these defects.

In their prime of power, the whole of society--and art was not
exempt--was cast in a single mould. The spirit which secluded Japan from
all foreign intercourse, and regulated every daily routine, from that of
the daimyo to that of the lowest peasant, narrowed and cramped artistic
creativeness also.

The Kano academies--filled with the disciplinary instincts of
Iyeyasu--of which

195

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

four were under the direct patronage of the Shoguns and sixteen under
the Tokugawa government, were constituted on the plan of regular feudal
tenures. Each academy had its hereditary lord, who followed his
profession, and, whether or not he was an indifferent artist, had under
him students who flocked from various parts of the country, and who
were, in their turn, official painters to different daimyos in the
provinces. After graduating at Yedo (Tokyo), it was *de rigueur* for
these students, returning to the country, to conduct their work there on
the methods and according to the models given them during instruction.
The students who were not vassals of daimyos were, in a sense,
hereditary fiefs of the Kano lords. Each had to pursue the course of
studies laid down by Tannyu and Tsunenobu, and each painted and drew
certain subjects in a certain manner. From this routine, departure meant
ostracism, which would

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

reduce the artist to the position of a common craftsman, for he would
not in that case be allowed to retain the distinction of wearing two
swords. Such a condition of things could not but be detrimental to
originality and excellence.

Besides the Kanos, the house of Tosa, with its younger branch,
Sumiyoshi, was re-established with hereditary honours at the beginning
of the Tokugawa rule, but the Tosa inspiration and tradition had been
lost ever since the days of Mitsunobu, who had clung heroically to his
old school during the Ashikaga period. In thus standing out against the
national stream, he had shown a weakness, it is true. Yet we must not
forget that, when all other artists were painting in ink, he had still
maintained the glorious tradition of colour. The new Tosa School,
however, imitated only the mannerisms of their ancestors, and any
vitality which they threw into this was reflected from

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

the work of the Kanos, as the pictures of Mitsuoki and Gukei show.

The sordid aristocracy of the day looked upon all this as natural, for
their own lives were regulated on the same basis. The son would order a
picture from a contemporary Kano or Tosa as his father had done from the
preceding academician. Meanwhile, the life of the people was entirely
apart. Their loves and aspirations were utterly different, though their
round of existence was equally stereotyped. Forbidden the high honours
of the court and intercourse with aristocratic society, they sought
their freedom in mundane pleasures, in the theatre, or in the gay life
of Yoshiwara. And as their literature forms another world from that of
the writings of the Samurai, so their art expresses itself in the
delineation of gay life and in the illustration of theatrical
celebrities.

The Popular School, which was their only expression, though it attained
skill

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

in colour and drawing, lacks that ideality which is the basis of
Japanese art. Those charmingly coloured wood-cuts, full of vigour and
versatility, made by Outamaro, Shunman, Kionobu, Harunobu, Kionaga,
Toyokuni, and Hokusai, stand apart from the main line of development of
Japanese art, whose evolution has been continuous ever since the Nara
period. The inros, the netsukes, the sword-guards, and the delightful
lacquer-work articles of the period, were playthings, and as such no
embodiment of national fervour, in which all true art exists. Great art
is that before which we long to die. But the art of the late Tokugawa
period only allowed a man to dwell in the delights of fancy. It is
because the prettiness of the works of this period first came to notice,
instead of the grandeur of the masterpieces hidden in the daimyos'
collections and the temple treasures, that Japanese art is not yet
seriously considered in the West.

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

The bourgeois art of Yedo (Tokyo), under the dread shadow of the
Shoguns, was limited thus to a narrow round of expression. It was due to
the freer atmosphere of Kyoto that another and higher form of democratic
art was evolved. Kyoto, where the imperial seat remained, was on that
account comparatively free from the Tokugawa discipline, for the Shoguns
dared not assert themselves here as openly as in Yedo and in other parts
of the country. Here it was, therefore, that scholars and free-thinkers
flocked to take refuge, so making it, a century and a half later, the
fulcrum on which would turn the lever of the Meiji restoration. It was
here that artists who disdained the Kano yoke could venture to indulge
in wilful deviations from tradition, here that the rich middle classes
could permit themselves to admire their originality. Here was Busson
trying to formulate a new style by illustrating the popular poetry; here
was Watanabe-Shiko, who tried to

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

revive Korin's style, and Shohaku, who, with Blake-like instinct,
revelled in wild imagery based on Jasoku of the Ashikaga period; and
here, finally, was Jakuchu, a fanatic, who loved to paint impossible
birds.

Kyoto, however, had two real influences. First was the introduction and
revival of the later Ming (1368-1662) and earlier Manchu-Shin style,
which had been inaugurated in China by dilettantes and æsthetes, who
considered a painting to he worthless when it came from the hands of a
professional, and prized the playful sketches of a great scholar above
the works of a master-artist. In its own way, even this must be
understood as a demonstration of the immense power of the Chinese mind
in breaking away from the formalism of the Gen academic style imposed
during the Mongol dynasty. Artists from Kyoto crowded to Nagasaki, the
one port then open, to study from Chinese traders this new style,
already

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

hardened into mannerism before it reached Japan.

The second important effort of Kyoto was the study which it initiated of
European realistic art. Matteo-Ricci had been a Roman Catholic
missionary, who had entered China during the Ming dynasty, and given the
impulse which had now made the new school of Realism prominent in the
cities at the mouth of the Yang-tse. Chinnan-ping, a Chinese artist of
this school who was noted for his birds and flowers, resided in Nagasaki
for three years, and laid the foundation of the Natural School of Kyoto.

Dutch prints were eagerly sought and copied, and Maruyama Okio, the
founder of the Maruyama School, devoted himself in his youth to copying
them. It is pathetic to note that he copied the lines of the engravings
with his brush. It was due to this artist that the movement was brought
to a focus, for he, with an early Kano training, was able to combine the

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

new methods with a style of his own. He was an ardent student of nature,
serving her moods in all their detail, and his delicacy and softness and
exquisite gradation of effects on silk give him his right to be called
the representative artist of this period.

Goshun, his rival, the founder of the Shijo School, follows closely in
his steps, though his Chinese mannerisms of later Ming differentiate
him.

Ganku, another realist, ancestor of the Kisshi School, differs from the
first two by his closer similarity to Chinnan-ping.

These three streams of tendency together constitute the modern Kyoto
School of Realism. They sound a different note from the Kanos, yet, with
all their dexterity and skill, they also fail to catch the truly
national element in art, as their brethren in Yedo failed to do in the
Popular School. Their works are delightful and full of grace, but never
grasp the essential character of the subject as

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Sesshu and other artists used to do. The
occasions when Okio rises to great heights are when he reverts
unconsciously to those methods which governed the old masters.

Kyoto art, since the death of these three great workers, consists only
of attempts by their followers to combine in different proportions the
individual excellence of their respective styles. Yet, up to the rise of
contemporary Japanese art, in the second decade of the Meiji restoration
in 1881, the Kyoto artists were the leading creative spirits in
pictorial art.

NOTES

*Kano Academies*.--These owe their name to a family of artists who were
appointed painters-in-ordinary to the Tokugawas.

Inros.--Small lacquer medicine-cases, to be hung on the obi or girdle.

Netsukis.--Ornamental buttons by which the inro or the tobacco-pouch was
hung.
