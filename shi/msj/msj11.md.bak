### THE LIGHTNING

<span class="smallcaps">By Minamoto no Jun—10th Century</span>

Out of the murky clouds the lightning's glare  
Dimly reveals the brooding Autumn plain, <span id="page_62">p.
62</span>  
Shown for an instant in its 'broidery rare,  
Then the dense darkness covers it again.  
Such is our life, an instant in the light,  
Then the Unknown, impenetrable night!

### EVANESCENCE

<span class="smallcaps">By Minamoto no Jun</span>

Even as the beads of evening dew that lie  
Upon the morning-glory through the night,  
And vanish ere the fading of the flower  
  With the day's dawning  
  Such is human life!

### THE SLEEVE

UNKNOWN

Would that my sleeve were long and wide enough  
To cover all the sky, and shelter thus  
The fair Spring blossoms from the scattering wind!

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

### DEW-SPRINKLED

<span class="smallcaps">By Minamoto no Jun</span>

The tangled crowd of blossoms in the field,  
Their mingled perfumes to the morning yield.  
As I pass on, where fallen petals strew  
The narrow path, with aromatic dew  
My sleeve is wet and faded.

### EVENING MISTS

<span class="smallcaps">By Minamoto no Jun</span>

The lonely wanderer with dismay  
Sees the dusk fall, as he pursues  
His path towards the wane of day,  
And mists begin to blot the views  
And hide the Adzuma highway,  
Where, clear to sight, a while ago  
The folk were passing to and fro!

### THE WHITE CLOUD

<span class="smallcaps">By Minamoto no Jun</span>

The white cloud blown from the mountain-peak  
       Drifts lightly by;  
Whither it goes we would vainly seek,  
       And know not why

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

The white cloud feels the breath of the wind,  
       A shuddering sigh:  
Even thus is the life of a man  
       Who is born—to die!

### THE FROGS AND THE KERRIA BLOOMS

The crying of the frogs comes hither,  
Silent no longer, since they fear  
To see the Yamabuki wither,  
The golden blooms they hold so dear,  
   And now the heartless flowers  
   Make haste to disappear!

### DAWN

(From the "Manyôshiu")

     It is the Dawn, and I—  
I cannot sleep, nor have the long night through,  
     For thoughts of her I love!  
     The cuckoo's weary cry,  
Full of sad yearning, loud and louder grew,  
     And still though Day draws nigh,  
It maddens me with lamentations new!

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

### WISTARIA

(From the "Manyôshiu")

The pale mauve wavelets of wistaria,  
Which I had planted by my dwelling-place  
That it might bring me thoughts of thee I love,  
At length are blooming: pure ethereal  
As their own fragrance, fugitive and rare.

### IN PRAISE OF SAKE

<span class="smallcaps">By Ōtomo no Yakamochi</span>

Why talk of jewels? Though by night  
Their hearts with changeful colours shine,  
Can they impart the deep delight  
That lives within the golden wine  
   And drives away one's care?

  If in this Lifetime  
My heart be light and joyous,  
  What does it matter  
Though in the next existence  
I change to bird or insect?
