### TRANSCIENCE

<span class="smallcaps">By Komachi</span>

Swift fade the hues of hill and wold,  
Glories of Spring and Fall depart,  
More evanescent still, behold  
The fading blossoms of the heart!

### OLD SAMURAI PRAYER

May the Springs purely flow  
  And sickness cease;  
May victory crown our House  
And treasure-stores increase;  
Evil no longer grow,  
And all the world know peace!

### ANCIENT WEDDING SONG

The waves are still on the four seas,  
Soft blow the time-winds, yet the trees  
Sway not, nor rustling foliage stirs.  
In such an age blest are the firs  
That meet and age together.  
Nor heavenward look and reverent gaze,  
Nor words of gratitude and praise  
Our thanks can tell, that all our days  
Pass in this age with blessings stored  
By bounty of our Sovereign Lord!

### AT SAKUSA

(<span class="smallcaps">Verse on the Gate of Miya-Yaegaki</span>)

On the wild hills that tower to the sky,  
     There where they fell,  
The dead leaves lie  
In rustling heaps piled high,  
   There the gods dwell!

### THE HILL OF MEETING

(AU-SAKA, LAKE BIWA)

<span class="smallcaps">By Semi-Maro</span>

Known and Unknown, the stranger guest,  
Returning friends whom comrades greet,  
Up to the Hill of Meeting's <span id="fr_4"></span>[\*](#fn_4) crest,  
Press the wayfarers' eager feet.  
For here the fateful Barrier stands,  
And some will part—and some will meet.

### SLUMBER SONG OF IZUMO

Sleep, baby, sleep!  
On mountains steep <span id="page_72">p. 72</span>  
The children of the hare are straying.  
Why are their soft brown ears so long and slender,  
Peeping above the rocks where they are playing?

Because their mother, ere they yet were born,  
Ate the Loquat leaves in the dewy morn,  
And the bamboo grass long and slender—  
That's why the ears of baby-hares are long!  
Sleep, baby, sleep! to the lilt of my song!
