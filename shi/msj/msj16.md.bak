### SEA-FOAM—FLOWERS OF THE SEA-WAVES

(<span class="smallcaps">Namino-Hana</span>)

<span class="smallcaps">By Yasuhide</span>

The wild flowers fade, the maple-leaves,  
Touched by frost-fingers, float to earth;  
But on the bosom of the sea,  
The flowers to which her waves give birth  
Fade not, like blossoms of the land,  
Nor feel the chill of Autumn's hand.

### POVERTY

<span class="smallcaps">By Ransetsu</span>

On a cold, snowy morning,  
Somebody's child picking up,  
With stiff, chilled fingers,  
Empty tins in the street.

### ISOLATION

<span class="smallcaps">By Isé</span>

Cold as the wind of early Spring,  
Chilling the buds that still lie sheathed <span id="page_88">p.
88</span>  
In their brown armour, with its sting  
And the bare branches withering—  
  So seems the human heart to me!  
  Cold as the March wind's bitterness;  
  I am alone, none comes to see  
  Or cheer me in these days of stress.

### SPRING DAYS AND BLOSSOM

When the Spring comes, in all green things that grow  
New pulse of Life beats warmly, all aglow,  
Long are the golden days.  
Fragrant and moist the gentle zephyrs blow  
Through the warm haze.  
Why should the flowers alone make haste to go,  
Swift to depart from us, who love them so?

### OVER THE FENCE

<span class="smallcaps">By Isé</span>

In summer-time awhile the breeze will bring  
Over the fence a drift of petals fair,  
From the next garden's cherry blossoming;  
I would that rather the strong wind would bear  
The tree itself in fragrant beauty there  
          Into my garden

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

### PASSING OF THE SPRING

I know all blooms must wither at the last—  
Fair is their life, but limited and brief;  
Yet when I see their fragile beauty past,  
Filled is my heart with an unreasoning grief,  
Through the unchanging pageant of the years  
The passing of the Spring is sad to tears!

### FADED HUES

<span class="smallcaps">By Motoyoshi no Mikō</span>

Fair and unchanged in hue the flowers appear,  
As in last Springtime, exquisite to see,  
But one with whom I saw them bloom last year  
         Hath changed to me!

### THE FROGS CROAKING

The croaking frogs that find their lodging here,  
Would seem to feel the loneliness of night  
As much as I, so plaintive is their cry  
Through the long hours until the morning light.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

### CLOUD OF BLOSSOM

The stranger viewing from afar  
Yoshino's far-famed cherry-trees,  
Veiling each mountain crag and scar,  
A soft white cloud is all he sees!

### ABSENT

<span class="smallcaps">By Sugawara Adaijin</span>

O cherry-blossom loved so well,  
If you do not forget your lord,  
Absent from you this April-time,  
Send me your fragrant message, stored  
In the safe keeping of the breeze,  
Blowing towards me! Flowers adored,  
          I think of you!

### HOTOTOGISU—THE CUCKOO

<span class="smallcaps">By Sanesada</span>

     I hear the cuckoo calling,  
Calling, while the dawn's cold dews are falling,  
     A lonely lullaby.  
Yet when my eyes would seek her,

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

Nought can my gaze descry  
But grey mists fainter growing,  
But white moon ghostly showing  
Pale in the morning sky!

### HOTOTOGISU

None but the waning moon of morn  
Heard the Hototogisu's cry  
In anguish from her heart's-blood torn  
Thrill upwards to the paling sky!

### BROCADE OF AUTUMN

   The Autumn Plain  
Is robed in rich brocade,  
   With flowered pattern  
Lavishly displayed.  
   Whence come those dyes  
Of variegated hue?  
   Since crystal clear  
And colourless the dew?
