### KAMO NO CHŌMEI

<span class="small">Kamo no Chōmei, the author of that charming little
classic the "Hōjōki," written in A.D. 1212, was guardian of the Shinto
shrine of Kamo in Kioto. He was appointed by the retired Mikado Go Toba
to a post in the Department of Japanese Poetry. Being refused the
succession to his father as superior guardian of Kamo, ho retired to a
hermitage on Oharayama, near Kioto. He is the author of several essays
on poetical subjects, and many poems.</span>

### THE MOONRISE

<span class="smallcaps">By Kamo no Chōmei</span>

Neither at twilight nor at grey of dawn,  
Would I appear the sacred West to spurn,  
Yet at this evening hour am I forsworn!  
Though in the West the lingering glories burn,  
Le! in the East I watch with reverent eyes,  
Through purple mist, the full-orbed moon arise! <span id="page_102">p.
102</span>  
How can I help it! Though my face I turn  
From the blest Regions <span id="fr_6"></span>[\*](#fn_6) to the Eastern
skies.

### THE MOON AND THE RIVER

<span class="smallcaps">By Chōmei</span>

Since bright and clear the little river winds  
Over its shining pebbles to the sea,  
The fair moon seeks its limpid stream and finds  
A mirror for her radiant purity.

### MOONLIGHT ON THE PINE-TREES

<span class="smallcaps">By Chōmei</span>

Here, while I stand alone,  
Shadows mysterious thrown  
By the dark mountain pines  
Lie at my feet.  
At the clear moon I gaze,  
Muse in a thousand ways  
On what my soul divines  
Dimly of life.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

### THE FALLEN MAPLE-LEAVES

<span class="smallcaps">By Chōmei</span>

The scattered maple-leaves are blown  
From wooded hill and mountain-side,  
And in a rich confusion thrown,  
Mass in the valley far and wide.  
Hushed is the little streamlet's tone  
By the red splendour on its tide.

### BRIGHT MOON IN AUTUMN

<span class="smallcaps">Unknown</span>

The frosty moonlight cold and white  
Shines it so clear, that we may see  
Each maple-leaf float from its tree,  
And weave a perfect tapestry  
In silence of the Autumn night?

### THE BUTTERFLY

<span class="smallcaps">By Arakida Moritake</span> (1472-1540)

Where the soft drifts lie  
Of fallen blossoms, dying,  
Did one flutter now,  
From earth to its own brown bough?

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

Ah, no! ’twas a butterfly,  
Like fragile blossom flying!

### WHITE CHRYSANTHEMUMS

<span class="smallcaps">By Ochikochi no Mitsune</span>

’Tis hard indeed to choose which bloom to pluck  
Of all these gleaming white chrysanthemums,  
So thickly spangled with the earliest frost!

### THE MORNING GLORY

<span class="smallcaps">By Matsunaga Teitoku</span> (1564-1645)

Brief be my life as Heaven wills;  
Give me, O gods, the true heart of a flower;  
The morning-glory who fulfils  
Her perfect destiny within the hour,  
With the same energy that thrills  
The sturdy fir-trees that for centuries tower!

### SIESTA

<span class="smallcaps">By Matsunaga</span>

’Tis now the season of the Harvest Moon.  
Men gaze the livelong night, and sow the seed  
That brings a sweet siesta on the morrow!
