### THE RIVERSIDE

The Tatsuta's clear waters redly flow  
This placid eventide, whereby I know  
On the high hills the maples flame afar,  
And down the stream, a floating fiery star,  
Drifts the red leaf in splendour. Yet alas!  
To see the glory of the Autumn pass!

### THE CUT CHRYSANTHEMUM

Who could have cut this fair chrysanthemum,  
Regardless of its beauty as it grew  
In nature's harmony of leaf and stem?  
One who perchance has plucked it ere its prime,  
Mistakenly, to save it from chill winds,  
Or lest it perish in the heavy dew.

### THE FIRST SNOW

In my black hair white threads begin to stray,  
Gleam in the winter sunlight. Now I gaze  
On the year's earliest snow with vague dismay  
Soon shall I see the winter of my days.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

### WHY?

It grieves me, on this Life to contemplate,  
This Life that seems but as a summer cloud  
In a vast sky—floats up, and drifts away,  
Knowing no whence nor whither!

### MIRAGE

I say not that this Life is pitiful,  
Or that unending woe is mortals’ lot,  
For Life is but a mirage of the mind,  
And who can say if it exist or not?

### ACROSS THE HILLS

Who in the wild hills strays,  
These late October days,  
   A gift receives  
Upon his shoulders laid—  
A cloak of rich brocade  
(Yet all unwoven)  
   Of the maple leaves.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

### FALLEN LEAVES

At the tree's foot, with gorgeous colours fraught,  
The scarlet maple leaves rest as they fell.  
Where is the Autumn in whose hand was brought  
That splendid foliage? Rests she here as well  
Under the mantle she herself has wrought?

### IN WINTER-TIDE

My garden's fairest scenes, from now will show,  
Susuki-grass-plumes, graceful bending low,  
Under their burden of fresh-fallen snow!

### FLOWERING GRASSES

<span class="smallcaps">By Motosuki</span>

Flowering Susuki's many sleeves invite  
  In this fair field a lingering stay,  
But coldly turns the Autumn from their sight,  
  And leaves the scene to Winter grey.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

### REJOICING

Bright gleam the buds a-shine against the blue,  
While from green woods trills many a joyous voice.  
All hearts are gladsome: must it not be true,  
That "when the happy laugh the gods rejoice"?

### LIGHT OF DHARMAKÂYA

Many the paths that twist and wind  
Through stream-cleft vale or forest maze;  
But those who reach the hill-top find  
(Though they have climbed by different ways)  
On the wide summit, clear and kind,  
Just the same moonlight softly plays,  
Shining on all with equal rays!

### GHOST DRAGON-FLIES

At the brief home-returning of the dead,  
Bright is the air with flashing dragon-flies,  
Like gossamers at sunset shining red;  
The spirits’ burnished steeds flit through the skies,  
Each to its bourne, by viewless riders sped!

<span class="small">*Note*.—During the three days’ festival of the
dead—"Bon" (the Spirits of departed ancestors) are believed to be
carried by dragonflies to their old homes.</span>

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

### A PLAINT

As Autumn closes in, and fitful blows  
The dreary wind, that passes moaning by,  
My heart, already sorrow-laden, grows  
Sadder to hear the wild geese pensive cry—  
Leave me hereafter to my sad repose,  
O kindly birds of passage! Come not nigh!

### BROCADE

Fair goddess of the paling Autumn skies,  
Fain would I know how many looms she plies,  
Wherein through skilful tapestry she weaves  
Her fine brocade of fiery maple leaves—  
Since on each hill, with every gust that blows,  
In varied hues her vast embroidery glows?

### AT JIZŌ'S SHRINE

Fronting the kindly Jizō's shrine  
The cherry-blooms are blowing now,  
Pink cloud of flower on slender bough,  
And hidden tracery of line.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

Rose-dawn against moss-mellowed grey,  
Through which the wind-tost sprays allow  
Glimpse of calm smile and placid brow,  
Of carven face where sunbeams play.

Dawn-time, I pluck a branch, and swift  
Flutters a flight of petals fair;  
Through the fresh-scented morning air  
Down to the waving grass they drift.

Noon-tide my idle fingers stray,  
Through the fair maze of bud and flower,  
Sending a sudden blossom-shower  
From the sweet fragrance-haunted spray.

Low in the west the red fire dies,  
Vaguely I lift my hand, but now  
Jizō is not—nor cherry bough—  
Only the dark of starless skies!

### THE BLOSSOM-OFFERING

<span class="smallcaps">By Hujyō</span>

If I should pluck this fair flower blossoming,  
I might defile its beauty with my hand,  
So let it stay, ungathered where it grows.  
I offer its unsullied loveliness  
To Buddhas past, and present, and to come

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

### LATE CHERRY-BLOOM

<span class="smallcaps">By Shōni no Myōfu</span>

Here, sheltered by the hill,  
Lonely wild cherry still  
   I find in bloom.  
Let not the wild wind know!  
   Or it will surely blow  
And scatter this last trace  
   Of passing Spring!

### TEARS

<span class="smallcaps">By Fujiwara Tada-Kuni</span>

I thought that tears, the gems of Sorrow's crown,  
Were human only, yet I see each blade  
Of slender grass with shining drops weighed down,  
White dewdrop tears, that glimmer in the shade;  
Even the grass would seem all passion-filled,  
As my own heart, with grief not to be stilled!

### PERFUME AND BEAUTY

<span class="smallcaps">By Kawara no Sadaijin</span>

I'll gather dewdrops from the cherry-trees,  
And bathe me in their perfume through and through, <span id="page_87">p.
87</span>  
Ere yet there comes the rough and envious breeze  
To carry off both flowers and fragrance too!
