# THE MASTER-SINGERS OF JAPAN

### INTRODUCTION

IN times when everything relating to the history and literature of Japan
has become of such vivid interest to the people of this allied
Island-Empire, these attempted renderings into English of well-known
Japanese poems may prove acceptable, especially to those who may not
have time or opportunity to study the works of great Oriental scholars.
The dainty grace and beauty of the original poems, with their
impressionist word-pictures, are unfortunately easily lost in the
endeavour to "English" them. It is scarcely possible to convey the full
meaning of the shorter poems to English readers, without elaboration of
the original theme, when at once they cease to be "Japanesque"; just as
the unerring instinct and delicate harmonies of Japanese bird and flower
paintings would be ruined by over-elaboration

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

of details. Mr. Stewart-Dick has well said, "In art, the European
requires that everything should be stated with the utmost fulness of a
tedious realism, before he can grasp its meaning, but to the more
cultured Japanese a mere hint or slight suggestion is sufficient." The
majority of Japanese poems are little odes of five lines, of thirty-one
syllables; some "Hokku" contain but seventeen. There are, of course,
some of greater length, such as the "Naga Uta"—Long Lays of the
Manyôshiu. Wherever possible I have tried to give as literal a rendering
as I could, but here and there an additional line has seemed necessary
in order to convey the meaning to readers unacquainted with the
original. Most of the earlier poems in the book are taken from the
Manyôshiu, or "myriad leaves collection," an anthology of verse (to
quote Mr. Dickins) "wholly Japanese in diction and phrasing . . . and
exhibiting almost the oldest, perhaps the truest, certainly the most
pleasing portraiture extant of the Japanese world in its archaic age."
The exact date of its compilation is matter of controversy, some writers
contending that it was compiled by Yakamochi (who died A.D. 785); others
claim that Mōroye (died 767) commenced the task, which was completed by
Yakamochi. The dates of the Lays range from. about A.D. 347 to 759, a
period of over four hundred years. Some of the Lays appear to be
elaborations of

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

still earlier poems, found in the Kojiki, or Ancient Annals, A.D. 712,
containing the mythology and primitive history of the nation. The
following, from its pages, is said to be the oldest poem in Japanese
language—the version is that of Mr. Dickins:

*Lay attributed to the God of Eight Thousand Spears*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

   Of spears countless, His Majesty the God,  
   In all wide Yashima He sought, but found no spouse.  
In far-off Koshi, a virtuous damsel dwelt,  
So heard the God—So went He, her well wooing,  
His glaive in belt still girded, His veil unloosed.  
"And here I stand," quoth He, her door to open!  
The while the owl-bird screameth, the green hills midmost,  
And moorland pheasant echoeth, and nigh her dwelling,  
The cock too, loud be croweth!  
    I would these birds all  
    Would stop scream, call and crow,  
    These fowls too wretched  
    That fill the air with rumor!

Japanese poetry is wanting in narrative poems; even ballads are few and
far between; political and (strange to say in so soldierly a race) war
songs are mostly absent. Emotional poems and those dealing with the
various aspects of nature form the majority, and except for the "Wasau"
or Buddhist hymns, there are few of an exclusively religious character.
The Nara period—eighth century—was the Golden Age of Japanese Poetry.
Among the higher classes, the

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

art of verse-writing was universally cultivated. The poetry of the
Nation was, however, almost exclusively written by, and for, the Court
and officials; hence the subjects of many of the Lays, such as the
journeyings of the Court to different capitals, elegies on the deaths of
Royal Personages, love incidents of lords and ladies of the Court, the
sending of officials to distant march-lands, etc.

Among the poets of this period stand conspicuous the "twin stars of
Japanese poetry," Hitómaro and Akáhito, whose rival claims to supremacy
are even yet undecided. There is a pretty story of the former told by
Mr. Chamberlain of a warrior, Ayabe, who found a child of more than
mortal beauty under a persimmon tree. Asked who he was, the child
replied, "No father or mother have I, but the moon and winds obey me,
and in poetry I find my joy." The boy was adopted, and became Kakinomoto
(under the persimmon tree) no Asomi, Hitómaro, prince of Japanese poets.
Scarcely less distinguished is Omi Okura, whose verses breathe a sturdy
loyalty, perhaps tinged with the practical common sense of Confucianism,
yet at the same time often echoing the higher sentiments of Buddhism.
Then Yakamochi, compiler of the anthology of which his own charming and
polished verse forms a most attractive part, and whose poetical
correspondence with his friend Ikenushi gives us a

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

delightful glimpse into the life and literature of Court and official
life in the eighth century. In the Fujiwara and Nara periods
Confucianism and Buddhism became ruling influences in Japan, yet, with
very few exceptions, there is little trace of the influence of either in
the Manyôshiu. Not until much later do we find in the shorter poems or
"Tanka" allusions to the impermanence of life, the vanity of egoistic
desires, etc., as in the poems of Saigyō and Chōmei. The influence of
Chinese learning, continuing up to the ninth century, temporarily
checked the growth of native literature; but a revival took place in the
reign. of Mikado Dayo, A.D. 905, when Kino Tsurayuki and other poets
were instructed to collect the anthology known as Kokinshiu. This
collection, however, contains but five Naga-Uta—long lays; and from
henceforward until the present day the poetry of Japan has been chiefly
confined to Tanka or thirty-one-syllable poems. This of necessity
cramped within narrow limits the poetic expression of the race; within
such boundaries there was no room for the outpourings of a Shakespeare
or a Milton. Yet within those limits what perfect word-paintings, what
dainty impressionist sketches, what little gems of perfect fancy lie
enshrined! and these in spite of certain conventions of choice of
subjects, and the introduction of word-plays and pivot-words—no doubt of
Chinese origin—which to a western mind are

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

wearisome. I have already touched on the influences of Buddhism and
Confucianism, but there is another pervading Japanese literature and
poetry, far deeper and more permanent because indigenous to the race—the
influence of "Yamato Damashü" (Soul of Japan): born in archaic days, it
was fostered by the ancient beliefs of Shinto, gathering strength
through the ages, till it found outward expression in "Bushido" (the
Knightly Way). It breathes through the early Lays of the Manyôshiu, in
whole-souled devotion to the Liege Lord, in passionate belief that
Yamato is the land of the gods, chosen of the Sun Goddess—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Of lands the fairest, of lands the most
divine.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Later in
innumerable Tanka, painting with loving touches the beauty of the cherry
blossom, emblem of the warrior, and all the lovely mountains "whereon
the high gods dwelt" within the Mikado's realm. It survives triumphant,
through the stifling conventionalism of Chinese influences, sings to us
in the eighteenth century, in the words of Motoori, "Shikishima no,
Yamato Gokoro wo!" and rings out victorious and eternal in the swan-song
of Hirosé, before Port Arthur:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Would that I could be born seven times,  
To sacrifice each life for my Country.  
Resolved to die for it, my mind is firm,  
And again expecting to win success,  
Smiling I go on board!</span>

</div>

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

I would like to express my deep sense of the debt of gratitude I owe to
Mr. D. T. Suzuki, the distinguished Buddhist scholar, who most kindly
volunteered to transcribe many of the poems into the Romaji for me, and
further helped me by invaluable criticism. I also owe much to kind help
given me by Mr. S. Uchida, whose translation of "Bushidō" is included in
this book, and to the kindness of Professor Kanazawa. For many of the
poems from the Manyôshiu and Kokinshiu, and "The Bamboo Flute," I am
indebted to the prose and literal translations in the Japanese texts of
F. V. Dickins, C.B., and W. G. Aston's "Japanese Literature." Other
books consulted were those of the late Lafcadio Hearn, "Altjapanische
Winterlieder," "Gramatzky," and Professor Chamberlain's "Things
Japanese." Lay 78, Manyôshiu, "On Tanabata Night," "Blossom-time" and
"Dragon-fly" poems, are included by kind permission of the proprietors
of "T. P.'s Weekly," in which they originally appeared.
