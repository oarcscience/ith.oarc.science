### KEICHIU

A.D. 1610–1701

A Priest whose reputation as a scholar attracted the attention of the
famous Daimio of Mito, Mitsukuni, who caused a vast library to be
collected and maintained scholars for researches which resulted in the
compilation of the Dainihoushi = "History of Japan."

### THE COMING OF SPRING

<span class="smallcaps">By Keichiu</span>

The Spring hath bent its magic bow  
The heavens eterne, the earth below  
Rich with its hidden ore, are veiled  
       In mist-wreaths grey.  
High on the mountain-ledge the snow  
Melts, and once-frozen ponds o’erflow  
       This first Spring day.  
The plum-trees’ branches gently sway  
From the young blossoms’ fair array  
The nightingale trills forth her song  
       So tender-sweet.

Now memories of the bygone year  
Fade in our hearts, new joys appear  
       Our hopes to greet.

When can we to the meadows pass,  
To pluck the herbs among the grass?  
When will the budding willows flame  
       In living gold?  
When will the cherry-blossoms glow?  
To-day, in minds of high and low,  
       These thoughts unfold!
