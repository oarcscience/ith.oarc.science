<p><small>Ohotomo no Sukune Yakamochi was a noble of the Ohotomo clan. He held high rank at Court, being made Daishi&#8212;great teacher&#8212;an honour conferred upon learned and virtuous persons. To him probably is due the collection of poems of the " Many&ocirc;shiu "&#8212;to which his own poems form a considerable an valuable contribution. He died September 785 A.D. Professor Dickins says, "His poetical correspondence with Ikenushi is a most interesting example of the literary life of the court and official world of the eighth century."</small></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE CUCKOO AND WISTARIA</h3>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">May 19th</span>, 750 A.D.</p>  
<p>See the fair maid expectant stand,<br> All in the golden morning light.<br> Mirror-case held in tiny hand,<br> Whose lids have veiled its surface bright.<br> Peach-tinted cheeks and smile-curved brows,<br> Graceful as arching willow boughs.</p>  
<p>On the high twin peaks of the hill,<br> Through the mist-scattered deep green vales,<br> Loud rings the cuckoo's note and clear,<br> Or near the moonlit moorland wails.<br> Darts he through rippling fuji-blooms,<br> Through the wing-shaken perfumed showers<br> Of scattered petals. Thence I cull<br> A fragrant spray of well-loved flowers.</p>  
<p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></A></p>  
<p>The purple wavelets in my sleeve<br> I place&#8212;and if, all fair to see<br> Yet they should stain its surface bright,<br> What care I? Purple let it be!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE PEARLS OF AWABI</h3>  
<p align="center">WHICH HE WOULD FAIN SEND TO HIS WIFE, AT THE ROYAL CITY</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Yakamochi</span>&#8212;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">June 5th</span>, A.D. 749</p>  
<p>In the great Sea-god Susu's realm<br> The divers brave the awful deep,<br> There the awabi's gleaming pearls<br> Pluck from the shadows where they sleep.</p>  
<p>Would that a hundred pearls were mine,<br> Hundreds of gleaming orbs to twine<br> And send to thee, where thou dost pine<br> In Royal City desolate!<br> Where the nights pass in dreary round,<br> And thou, with tresses all unbound,<br> The days of parting countest!<br> Lonely our alcove&#8212;still apart<br> Our sleeves&#8212;and thou with weary heart&#8212;<br> The creeping days, thou countest?</p>  
<p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></A></p>  
<p>Pearls I would send, that thou shouldst find<br> Solace in twining them to hind<br> Garlands of orange-blossom white,<br> Dark leaves with golden fruit alight,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweet-flag flowers,<br> In this fifth moon-month when by day<br> And night the cuckoo sings his lay.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE NEW YEAR</h3>

<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Yakamochi&#8212;New Year's Day, Feb. 2nd</span>, A.D. 759</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Tis the New Year.<br> Already dawneth Spring, with promise bright.<br> On our dear Land may countless blessings light,<br> As countless as the snowflakes that are falling!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE PINK AND THE LILY</h3>  
<p align="center">(Part of Lay 232, "Many&ocirc;shiu")</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Yakamochi&#8212;July 16th</span>, A.D. 749</p>  
<p>To soothe my heart, afar from thee,<br> A wild pink from the green hillside<br> I planted in my garden court.<br> Then, for its flower-spouse I brought<br> A lily from the moorland wide.<br> So should their hues and fragrance be<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together mingled.</p>  
<p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></A></p>  
<p>As side by side, I watch them grow,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It calms my sorrow,<br> Else, heaven-far from thee, I know<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not, could not stay<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more brief day,<br> But fain must seek thee on the morrow!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">ON THE CUCKOO SINGING IN ANOTHER'S GARDEN</h3>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Yakamochi&#8212;June 2nd</span>, A.D. 750</p>  
<p>Within thy garden lies<br> A sheltered dell where alders grow,<br> From thence to morning skies<br> The cuckoo's notes unceasing flow,<br> And every eve, far, far away<br> Among the Fuji trails<br> Purple with bloom, his roundelay<br> Of joyance never fails.<br> But in my garden here,<br> Though orange-flowers unwithered blow,<br> No cuckoo ventures near,<br> Nor song doth he bestow!<br> Why tells he to thine ear?<br> The tale I may not know</p>

<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Part of Lay Sent to his Wife in the Capital</span></p>  
<p>From friends and kin apart,<br> In lonely wilds I pined,<br> And solace to my heart,<br> A-hawking sought to find.<br> Ihas&eacute;'s moor towards<br> Where the bush-clover grows,<br> Over the Autumn sward<br> Gaily my party goes.<br> Men through the wooded dells<br> Beating for wild-fowl press,<br> While my hawk's silver bells<br> Tinkle with eagerness.<br> With that sweet music near,<br> Gazing on wide-spread view,<br> Gone are my musings drear,<br> Gladness is born anew!<br> Now in our chamber here,<br> Where our twin-pillows lie,<br> My dappled falcon dear<br> Perches his master nigh.<br> Here dainty hits I bring,<br> Here smooth his mottled wing!</p>

<p align="center">(Lay 238 from the Many&ocirc;shiu")</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Yakamochi&#8212;April 20th</span>, A.D. 750</p>  
<p>Since that far day when Heaven and Earth were new,<br> Plain to mankind hath been the certainty<br> That this our world is all impermanence.<br> Gaze on the heavens, and mark the gleaming moon,<br> That ever waxes, evermore to wane.<br> The steep hillsides, tree-clad, flow's-wreathed Spring,<br> Are fair with blossom; but the Autumn comes,<br> The cold dew falls, and hoar-frosts&#8217; searing touch<br> Sets the hillside aflame with ruddy leaves&#8212;<br> The red leaf falls, and leaves the branches bare!<br> So with mankind. Too soon the youthful cheek<br> Loses its freshness, and the jetty hair<br> Changes its shining darkness into grey.<br> The smiling morn turns to the tearful eve,<br> As the wind blows, unseen of mortal eye.<br> As the tide flows, nor for an instant stays;<br> So all things pass, and all are mutable,<br> And I&#8212;I weep, and cannot stay my tears!</p>  
<p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">YAKAMOCHI TO HIS WIFE</h3>  
<p>Together dwelt my Lady-wife and I,<br> And with the years so grew our mutual love,<br> While each new Spring, when on the earliest flowers<br> We gazed together, so in form and soul<br> She seemed to draw new loveliness herself<br> From their young beauty&#8212;Wife! so far from me!<br> When, in obedience to my Sov&#8217;reign Lord,<br> I crossed through frowning passes thick with trees,<br> And o&#8217;er wild moors, to frontiers heaven-far.<br> Since we were parted, months have come and gone,<br> The cherry-flowers have bloomed and passed away,<br> And thou, sweet wife! not one short glimpse of thee<br> My heart has gladdened! Sorrowful and wan<br> Each night my sleeve I backward turn, if so<br> Haply in dreams to see thee! Yet I would<br> Thy very self, and not thy dream-form see.<br> Would I could seek thee, and the long night through<br> Make thy white arm my pillow.&#8212;But alas!<br> Long lie the spear-ways, as a barrier<br> Parting us, till a happier time be ours!<br> Ay! when the cuckoo blithely singing comes,<br> In his own month (ah t would that it were here!)</p>  
<p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></A></p>  
<p>When all the hills are white with hare-bush blooms,<br> Then shall I gaze across the shining space<br> Of Omi's waters, to our distant home;<br> Nara, the City-Royal, and our home!<br> Like the sad Nuy&eacute; bird, impatient too,<br> I shall set forth, my eager heart and soul<br> One great glad longing for the sight of thee!<br> Sight of thee standing in our doorway dear,<br> Listening to passing words as oracles,<br> Searching with earnest gaze the distant road<br> (Sad, at the evening shadows lengthening)<br> For me who come apace to meet my love?</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHINESE POEM</h3>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Yakamochi</span></p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Written when ill, in answer to Letter and Verses from his Friend Ikenushi, April 8th</span>, A.D. 748</p>  
<p>Fair is the land in waning Spring,<br> The light wind passes like a sigh,<br> Swift through the blue on sweeping wing<br> The swallow, clay in beak, goes by.<br> Gladly he darts through shadowing leaves<br> To his house-building &#8217;neath the eaves.<br> To the wide ocean far away<br> The wild geese, reeds in bill, take flight,<br> Streaming across the moonlit bay<br> Through the vast silence of the night.</p>  
<p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></A></p>  
<p>You write, "I sing, where old friends throng,<br> New songs, and, duly purified, I drink and pass the cup along,<br> Adrift upon the crystal tide."<br> Glad would I join your feast. Alas!<br> Weak from disease I may not pass<br> To revel by your side!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">PLUM-BLOSSOM</h3>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Yakamochi</span></p>  
<p>Boldly the white plum-blossoms raise<br> Their fragrant beauty through the haze<br> Of winter gloom, where sleet and snow<br> Contending, round my dwelling blow.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">A HERO</h3>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Yakamochi</span></p>  
<p>A hero's fame should so established stand,<br> That through the endless ages yet to be<br> His name should thrill, inspiriting and grand,<br> Upon the lips of far posterity!</p>

<p>In dread obeisance thy way<br> To distant Marchlands didst thou wend,<br> O&#8217;er craggy hill and barren waste;<br> A loyal liege-man thou, O friend!<br> &#8217;Tis true thou liest all alone<br> On bed of sickness close-confined,<br> Full of sad thoughts, but such the way<br> Of this poor world, time beyond mind!<br> What say our neighbours, that may cheer<br> Thy saddened thoughts, beloved friend!<br> They say, on all the hillsides bloom<br> The sprays of cherry, that down-bend<br> With shining blossom &#8217;mid whose snows<br> Ceaseless the warblers&#8217; love-lilts ring,<br> While o&#8217;er the moorland wander maids<br> Plucking the violets of Spring;<br> Neatly they fold their shining sleeves,<br> Lift their red skirts above the dew,<br> And wait with heartfelt sympathy,<br> For thee to pluck the flowers anew.<br> Cheer thee, O brother, Spring is young,<br> And ere it fades, thou yet shalt share<br> The revels of its blossom-time,<br> The fragrance of its perfumed air!</p>
