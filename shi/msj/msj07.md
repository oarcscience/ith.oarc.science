### YAKAMOCHI

<span class="small">Ohotomo no Sukune Yakamochi was a noble of the
Ohotomo clan. He held high rank at Court, being made Daishi—great
teacher—an honour conferred upon learned and virtuous persons. To him
probably is due the collection of poems of the " Manyôshiu "—to which
his own poems form a considerable an valuable contribution. He died
September 785 A.D. Professor Dickins says, "His poetical correspondence
with Ikenushi is a most interesting example of the literary life of the
court and official world of the eighth century."</span>

### THE CUCKOO AND WISTARIA

<span class="smallcaps">May 19th</span>, 750 A.D.

See the fair maid expectant stand,  
All in the golden morning light.  
Mirror-case held in tiny hand,  
Whose lids have veiled its surface bright.  
Peach-tinted cheeks and smile-curved brows,  
Graceful as arching willow boughs.

On the high twin peaks of the hill,  
Through the mist-scattered deep green vales,  
Loud rings the cuckoo's note and clear,  
Or near the moonlit moorland wails.  
Darts he through rippling fuji-blooms,  
Through the wing-shaken perfumed showers  
Of scattered petals. Thence I cull  
A fragrant spray of well-loved flowers.

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

The purple wavelets in my sleeve  
I place—and if, all fair to see  
Yet they should stain its surface bright,  
What care I? Purple let it be!

### THE PEARLS OF AWABI

WHICH HE WOULD FAIN SEND TO HIS WIFE, AT THE ROYAL CITY

<span class="smallcaps">By Yakamochi</span>—<span class="smallcaps">June
5th</span>, A.D. 749

In the great Sea-god Susu's realm  
The divers brave the awful deep,  
There the awabi's gleaming pearls  
Pluck from the shadows where they sleep.

Would that a hundred pearls were mine,  
Hundreds of gleaming orbs to twine  
And send to thee, where thou dost pine  
In Royal City desolate!  
Where the nights pass in dreary round,  
And thou, with tresses all unbound,  
The days of parting countest!  
Lonely our alcove—still apart  
Our sleeves—and thou with weary heart—  
The creeping days, thou countest?

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

Pearls I would send, that thou shouldst find  
Solace in twining them to hind  
Garlands of orange-blossom white,  
Dark leaves with golden fruit alight,  
   And sweet-flag flowers,  
In this fifth moon-month when by day  
And night the cuckoo sings his lay.

### THE NEW YEAR

(Last Lay of the "Manyôshiu")

<span class="smallcaps">By Yakamochi—New Year's Day, Feb. 2nd</span>,
A.D. 759

             ’Tis the New Year.  
Already dawneth Spring, with promise bright.  
On our dear Land may countless blessings light,  
As countless as the snowflakes that are falling!

### THE PINK AND THE LILY

(Part of Lay 232, "Manyôshiu")

<span class="smallcaps">By Yakamochi—July 16th</span>, A.D. 749

To soothe my heart, afar from thee,  
A wild pink from the green hillside  
I planted in my garden court.  
Then, for its flower-spouse I brought  
A lily from the moorland wide.  
So should their hues and fragrance be  
    Together mingled.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

As side by side, I watch them grow,  
    It calms my sorrow,  
Else, heaven-far from thee, I know  
    I could not, could not stay  
      One more brief day,  
But fain must seek thee on the morrow!

### ON THE CUCKOO SINGING IN ANOTHER'S GARDEN

<span class="smallcaps">By Yakamochi—June 2nd</span>, A.D. 750

Within thy garden lies  
A sheltered dell where alders grow,  
From thence to morning skies  
The cuckoo's notes unceasing flow,  
And every eve, far, far away  
Among the Fuji trails  
Purple with bloom, his roundelay  
Of joyance never fails.  
But in my garden here,  
Though orange-flowers unwithered blow,  
No cuckoo ventures near,  
Nor song doth he bestow!  
Why tells he to thine ear?  
The tale I may not know

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

### YAKAMOCHI AND HIS HAWK

<span class="smallcaps">Part of Lay Sent to his Wife in the
Capital</span>

From friends and kin apart,  
In lonely wilds I pined,  
And solace to my heart,  
A-hawking sought to find.  
Ihasé's moor towards  
Where the bush-clover grows,  
Over the Autumn sward  
Gaily my party goes.  
Men through the wooded dells  
Beating for wild-fowl press,  
While my hawk's silver bells  
Tinkle with eagerness.  
With that sweet music near,  
Gazing on wide-spread view,  
Gone are my musings drear,  
Gladness is born anew!  
Now in our chamber here,  
Where our twin-pillows lie,  
My dappled falcon dear  
Perches his master nigh.  
Here dainty hits I bring,  
Here smooth his mottled wing!

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

### IMPERMANENCE

(Lay 238 from the Manyôshiu")

<span class="smallcaps">By Yakamochi—April 20th</span>, A.D. 750

Since that far day when Heaven and Earth were new,  
Plain to mankind hath been the certainty  
That this our world is all impermanence.  
Gaze on the heavens, and mark the gleaming moon,  
That ever waxes, evermore to wane.  
The steep hillsides, tree-clad, flow's-wreathed Spring,  
Are fair with blossom; but the Autumn comes,  
The cold dew falls, and hoar-frosts’ searing touch  
Sets the hillside aflame with ruddy leaves—  
The red leaf falls, and leaves the branches bare!  
So with mankind. Too soon the youthful cheek  
Loses its freshness, and the jetty hair  
Changes its shining darkness into grey.  
The smiling morn turns to the tearful eve,  
As the wind blows, unseen of mortal eye.  
As the tide flows, nor for an instant stays;  
So all things pass, and all are mutable,  
And I—I weep, and cannot stay my tears!

### YAKAMOCHI TO HIS WIFE

Together dwelt my Lady-wife and I,  
And with the years so grew our mutual love,  
While each new Spring, when on the earliest flowers  
We gazed together, so in form and soul  
She seemed to draw new loveliness herself  
From their young beauty—Wife! so far from me!  
When, in obedience to my Sov’reign Lord,  
I crossed through frowning passes thick with trees,  
And o’er wild moors, to frontiers heaven-far.  
Since we were parted, months have come and gone,  
The cherry-flowers have bloomed and passed away,  
And thou, sweet wife! not one short glimpse of thee  
My heart has gladdened! Sorrowful and wan  
Each night my sleeve I backward turn, if so  
Haply in dreams to see thee! Yet I would  
Thy very self, and not thy dream-form see.  
Would I could seek thee, and the long night through  
Make thy white arm my pillow.—But alas!  
Long lie the spear-ways, as a barrier  
Parting us, till a happier time be ours!  
Ay! when the cuckoo blithely singing comes,  
In his own month (ah t would that it were here!)

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

When all the hills are white with hare-bush blooms,  
Then shall I gaze across the shining space  
Of Omi's waters, to our distant home;  
Nara, the City-Royal, and our home!  
Like the sad Nuyé bird, impatient too,  
I shall set forth, my eager heart and soul  
One great glad longing for the sight of thee!  
Sight of thee standing in our doorway dear,  
Listening to passing words as oracles,  
Searching with earnest gaze the distant road  
(Sad, at the evening shadows lengthening)  
For me who come apace to meet my love?

### CHINESE POEM

<span class="smallcaps">By Yakamochi</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Written when ill, in answer to Letter and Verses
from his Friend Ikenushi, April 8th</span>, A.D. 748

Fair is the land in waning Spring,  
The light wind passes like a sigh,  
Swift through the blue on sweeping wing  
The swallow, clay in beak, goes by.  
Gladly he darts through shadowing leaves  
To his house-building ’neath the eaves.  
To the wide ocean far away  
The wild geese, reeds in bill, take flight,  
Streaming across the moonlit bay  
Through the vast silence of the night.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

You write, "I sing, where old friends throng,  
New songs, and, duly purified, I drink and pass the cup along,  
Adrift upon the crystal tide."  
Glad would I join your feast. Alas!  
Weak from disease I may not pass  
To revel by your side!

### PLUM-BLOSSOM

<span class="smallcaps">By Yakamochi</span>

Boldly the white plum-blossoms raise  
Their fragrant beauty through the haze  
Of winter gloom, where sleet and snow  
Contending, round my dwelling blow.

### A HERO

<span class="smallcaps">By Yakamochi</span>

A hero's fame should so established stand,  
That through the endless ages yet to be  
His name should thrill, inspiriting and grand,  
Upon the lips of far posterity!

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

### BY IKENUSHI TO HIS FRIEND YAKAMOCHI , THE POET, WHO WAS LYING ILL

In dread obeisance thy way  
To distant Marchlands didst thou wend,  
O’er craggy hill and barren waste;  
A loyal liege-man thou, O friend!  
’Tis true thou liest all alone  
On bed of sickness close-confined,  
Full of sad thoughts, but such the way  
Of this poor world, time beyond mind!  
What say our neighbours, that may cheer  
Thy saddened thoughts, beloved friend!  
They say, on all the hillsides bloom  
The sprays of cherry, that down-bend  
With shining blossom ’mid whose snows  
Ceaseless the warblers’ love-lilts ring,  
While o’er the moorland wander maids  
Plucking the violets of Spring;  
Neatly they fold their shining sleeves,  
Lift their red skirts above the dew,  
And wait with heartfelt sympathy,  
For thee to pluck the flowers anew.  
Cheer thee, O brother, Spring is young,  
And ere it fades, thou yet shalt share  
The revels of its blossom-time,  
The fragrance of its perfumed air!
