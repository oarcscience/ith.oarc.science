### SAIGYŌ-HŌSHI

(Born 11—; died 1198)

<span class="small">A famous poet of noble birth. He was one of the
pages at the Court of the Mikado. One day he parted with a fellow-page,
saying good-bye cheerfully, and promising to call on him on his way to
Court next day, The same evening Saigyō was surprised and horrified to
hear of his friend's sudden death. This impressed him so much, that he
left the Court and his companions, and his happy family, and became a
monk, travelling through the country for many years, and composing many
beautiful poems.</span>

### FELLOW-TRAVELLERS

<span class="smallcaps">By Saigyō—12th Century</span>

Passing along the highway, when we see  
The shadows of the willows floating cool  
In a clear spring of water, then we pause  
As fellow-travellers to rest awhile;  
  Loth to pass on, we linger.

### AT ISÉ TEMPLE

<span class="smallcaps">By Saigyō</span>

We know not what the Temple may enshrine,  
Yet feel the influence of things divine,  
  And pray with grateful tears!

### THE MOON-NIGHT

<span class="smallcaps">By Saigyō</span>

The sadness of the moon-night fills my thoughts  
With vague reflections of past hopes and fears.  
Sad as the clouded moon my countenance  
     With eyes bedewed with tears.

### THE SPRING

<span class="smallcaps">By Saigyō</span>

The deep snow piled upon the mountain-peaks,  
Melting, transforms the river's clear cascade  
Into a foaming torrent whose white waves  
Rush on their course resistless and unstayed.

### AUTUMN EVENING'S LONELINESS

<span class="smallcaps">By Saigyō</span>

Strong blows the evening wind and cool,  
  There where the marshlands silent lie,  
Where the lone snipe stands by the pool,  
  Mirrored against a sullen sky.  
Filled with compassion undefined,  
  Into my heart the silence steals.  
To the vague loneness of the mind  
  The Autumn loneliness appeals!
