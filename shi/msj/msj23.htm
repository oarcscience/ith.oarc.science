<p><small>He was born A.D. 1730 at Matsuzaka-Is&eacute;. One of the great names of Japanese literature. He was a pupil of Mabuchi. He was chiefly instrumental in restoring Shint&#333; to its original supremacy, and revived interest in the ancient literature. His works are numerous, one of the greatest being the Commentary on the Kojiki, in forty-four volumes, which is an encyclopedia of ancient literature.</small></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">YAMATO-DAMASH&Uuml; (SOUL OF JAPAN)</h3>

<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Shiroi Uk&#333;</span></p>  
<p align="center">(From "Hana Momiji," 1898)</p>  
<p align="center">PART I</p>  
<p>Under the shadow of the ancient firs<br> That clothe with sombre green the craggy height,<br> Again the hush of mystic silence stirs:<br> Whose bamboo flute speaks music to the night?<br> Is it some sun-bronzed fisher-lad would sigh<br> For other joys than those his work-day world,<br> Bitter with salt and seaweed, can supply&#8212;<br> So pours his soul in music to the sky?</p>  
<p>Night after night he seeks the fir-grove's shade;<br> To the vague moonbeams filtering from above,<br> To the dense darkness, or the stars displayed,<br> Still sound those yearning cadences of love.<br> And first the fisher's flute was heard to play,<br> When a whole day had passed since courtiers proud<br> Of our great Lord had wandered by this way,<br> And the long night their revelry held sway.<br> They wandered forth upon the beach, the night<br> Rang with keen wit, and laughter unsubdued,<br> The while upon her course of crystal light<br> The Autumn moon's fair barque her course pursued.</p>  
<p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></A></p>  
<p>A day had passed, since ladies of our Lord,<br> Mooring their pleasure-barge, in revel gay,<br> Tuned all their golden lutes in sweet accord<br> With the wind's song that through the fir-tops soared.</p>  
<p align="center">PART II</p>  
<p>On nights when the dew fell coldly<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the reeds of the sullen shore,<br> He came&#8212;and his flute sang boldly<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To the waves, and the swirling roar<br> Of the winds of the pines, in the distant crags<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As its fierce gusts downward tore.</p>  
<p>On nights when the hail beat wildly<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the waves on the beach ice-bound,<br> He came&#8212;and his flute sang mildly,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Subdued with a mournful sound.</p>  
<p>On nights when the rain poured madly<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And merged with the sea's weird moan,<br> He came&#8212;and his flute sang sadly,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Languid and faint of tone.</p>  
<p align="center">PART III</p>  
<p>Changed has the Autumn-moon to-night,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;So long his love endures, <a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></A><br> And still with ever-new delight<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The bamboo flute allures.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the wild storm's acclaim,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troubled its notes became;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoes from pine-trees blown,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear grew its liquid tone;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mad with the maddened sea,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frenzied its song would be!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stifled with rocks wave-swept,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dully its slow notes crept.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the cloud that floats<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over Onoy&eacute; stayed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to silver notes,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to some fainter played.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What wonder, there descends<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the high bower<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some one absorbed in thought<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this still hour!</p>  
<p>Awhile the flute had ceased to pour<br> Its importunities to earth and sky;<br> But hark! how, louder than before,<br> The music of the bamboo thrills on high.<br> Now a new harmony the air pervades,<br> And in accord, how sweetly! with the flute;<br> Clear as the trill of warbler in the glades<br> Ring the soft accents of a golden lute!</p>  
<p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></A></p>  
<p>Sometime the clouds from Onoy&eacute; descending<br> From the pine-scented rocks beneath them bore,<br> On their wide wings, the sweet musicians, tending<br> To those fair seas whereon, with altered helm,<br> The moon's fair barque steered straight towards them, wending<br> Her course eternal to the eternal Realm.</p>
