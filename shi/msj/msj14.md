### CHILDREN'S SONGS

### BUTTERFLY SONG

Butterfly, butterfly! light upon the Na-leaf, pray!  
     Or if Na-leaf tempt you not,  
     On my hand alight and sway:  
   Hand and Na-leaf both are nigh—  
   Light upon one, butterfly!

### SNAIL SONG

Put out your horns for a little, snail!  
The rain falls soft, and the wind blows warm,  
And rustles the leaves of the bamboo grass.  
Put out your horns, ere the showers pass,  
For the rain falls soft, and the wind blows warm!

### SIEGE SONG

     To West and East  
   The Land is full of foes!  
     To North and South  
   The foeman's standard blows,  
And countless as the pebbles on the sand,  
     From south of Tsukushi,  
   And Satsuma's wild strand,  
     Still gather foes!

  Into the void  
Of pathless space may fall  
  High Heaven itself—  
The solid mountain's wall  
  Melt in the torrents.  
Yet one thing is sure,  
  The Imperial Realm  
Unshaken shall endure  
  Firm above all!

### LOVER'S LAMENT IN THE EMPTY WESTERN PAVILION

(From the "Isé Monogatari," about 901–922)

Moon! it is gone, with all its charm sublime;  
Spring I nay, the Spring of "Once upon a time"  
Comes nevermore with blossoms in its train;  
All else is changed—but I unchanged remain!

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

### THE FROGS AT NIGHT

The croaking frogs that find their lodging here,  
Would seem to feel the loneness of the night,  
As well as I, so plaintive is their cry!

### FUJI

<span class="smallcaps">By Arikoto</span>

A thousand times I gaze upon thy form,  
A thousand times—and each more wonderful!

Swift, with the drifting clouds, tumultuous storm,  
The driving winds—so dost thou smile or frown—  
Yet always beauteous, whether storm or shine,  
O magic Mountain! Fuji the Divine

### THE SPRING WIND AND THE WILLOWS

<span class="smallcaps">By Tahira no Kanemori</span>

The goddess of the Spring has spread  
  Upon the budding willow-tree  
Her lovely mesh of silken strands:  
  O wind of Spring, blow lovingly  
And gently, lest the willow thread  
       Entangled be!

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

### THE SNOWFALL

(From the Kokinshiu")

<span class="smallcaps">By Kujohara no Fukayabu</span>

Midwinter gloom the earth enshrouds,  
       Yet from the skies  
       The blossoms fall  
       A flutt’ring shower,  
       White petals all!  
       Can Spring be come  
So soon beyond the clouds?

### ILLUSION

(From the "Kokinshiu")

<span class="smallcaps">By Sakanohe no Korenori</span>

In Yoshino at dawn meseemed  
Around me paling moonlight gleamed,  
But ’twas new-fallen snow that lay  
Cold-shining in the light of day.

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

### THE DESERTED GARDEN

<span class="smallcaps">By Biwa Sadaijin</span>

Once more the garden that I loved I seek,  
Where once the footsteps of my dear ones trod,  
Now all deserted, desolate and bleak.  
The brown leaf flutters to the frosted sod.  
Only the maple-foliage as of old  
Weaves its embroidery of red and gold!

### CHERRY-BLOSSOM TIME

<span class="smallcaps">By Norinobu</span>

All round the year, with careful pride,  
My court-yard here is neatly kept,  
Save at sweet cherry-blossom tide,  
When ’tis untrodden and upswept.  
White scented petals softly blow,  
And, downward fluttering, create  
A perfumed carpeting of snow,  
Nor foot nor hand must desecrate.

### AT THE END OF THE YEAR

<span class="smallcaps">By Harumichi no Tsuraki</span>

One speaks of yesterday,  
Lives through to-day, <span id="page_77">p. 77</span>  
And on the morrow  
Hastening away  
Like Asu's river,  
Ceaselessly and fast,  
The fleeting months and days  
Are with the past.

### JEWELS OF AUTUMN

<span class="smallcaps">By Fujiwara Kiyomasa</span>

The varied grasses of the Autumn meads  
Are gemmed with dewdrops, as with pure white beads,  
Yet all unthreaded. As the grasses sway,  
So, one by one, the dew-pearls slip away  
And vanish from the radiance of the day!

### DEW-DRENCHED AUTUMN LEAVES

Whence come these colours of the grass  
That glorify the Autumn field?  
The dew that glistens where I pass  
One hue alone methought could yield,  
Its crystal orbs no dyes can hold,  
Yet the leaves change to red and gold!

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

### SECLUSION

My humble dwelling, creeper-clad,  
So lonely lies,  
That day by day none visit me  
Save the fire-flies!

### THE OLD BATTLE-FIELD

<span class="smallcaps">By Yorihira</span>

Evanescent as dew their existence,  
These warriors of long-vanished ages;  
Of all their fierce contests and striving,  
Lo! the end is the Autumn wind sighing  
Its dirge o’er the waste place of battle!

### AUTUMN MOON THOUGHTS

I look upon the harvest moon to-night,  
She lifts my soul upon her silver rays;  
My thoughts are tangled in a web of light  
With vague reflections in a thousand ways.  
Dreaming they wander in a world unknown,  
Though Autumn's witchery is not mine alone!

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

### THE WIND IN AUTUMN

The Autumn wind tightening its plaintive strings,  
Plays a weird nocturne, that sad thought inspires.  
And every gust new desolation brings  
To my lone heart, a thrill of vain desires.

### ILLUSIONS

Call not the frosted branches of the trees,  
This winter morn, all desolate and bare!  
While the snow lies unmelted upon these,  
I think I see the white Spring-blossom there!

### HAILSTONES

Would that this hail might shower, a sparkling stream,  
All the grey day, until the moon arise,  
And shine upon this court, which then would gleam  
As though a rich-gemmed pavement dazed our eyes—  
White, glittering jewels, fresh from Paradise!
