### XXVII

### SAGAMI BAY

HATSUSHIMA ISLAND is probably unknown to all foreigners, and to 9999 out
of every 10,000 Japanese; consequently, it is of not much importance.
Nevertheless, it has produced quite a romantic little story, which was
told to me by a friend who had visited there some six years before.

The island is about seven miles south-east of Atami, in Sagami Bay (Izu
Province). It is so far isolated from the mainland that very little
intercourse goes on with the outer world. Indeed, it is said that the
inhabitants of Hatsushima Island are a queer people, and prefer keeping
to themselves. Even to-day there are only some two hundred houses, and
the population cannot exceed a thousand. The principal production of the
island is, of course, fish; but it is celebrated also for its jonquil
flowers (suisenn). Thus it will be seen that there is hardly any trade.
What little the people buy from or sell to the mainland they carry in
their own fishing-boats. In matrimony also they keep to themselves, and
are generally conservative and all the better for it.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

There is a well-known fisherman's song of Hatsushima Island. It means
something like the following, and it is of the origin of that queer
verse that the story is:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">To-day is the tenth of June. May the rain fall in
torrents!  
For I long to see my dearest O Cho San.  
Hi, Hi, Ya-re-ko-no-sa! Ya-re-ko-no-sa!</span>

</div>

Many years ago there lived on the island the daughter of a fisherman
whose beauty even as a child was extraordinary. As she grew, Cho—for
such was her name—improved in looks, and, in spite of her lowly birth,
she had the manners and refinement of a lady. At the age of eighteen
there was not a young man on the island who was not in love with her.
All were eager to seek her hand in marriage; but hardly any dared to
ask, even through the medium of a third party, as was usual.

Amongst them was a handsome fisherman of about twenty years whose name
was Shinsaku. Being less simple than the rest, and a little more bold,
he one day approached Gisuke, O Cho's brother, on the subject. Gisuke
could see nothing against his sister marrying Shinsaku; indeed, he
rather liked Shinsaku; and their families had always been friends. So he
called his sister O Cho down to the beach, where they were sitting, and
told her that Shinsaku had proposed for her hand in marriage, and that
he thought it an excellent match, of which her mother would have
approved had she been alive. He added: 'You must marry soon, you know.
You are eighteen, and we want no spinsters on Hatsushima, or girls
brought here from the mainland to marry our bachelors.'

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

'Stay, stay, my dear brother! I do not want all this sermon on
spinsterhood,' cried O Cho. 'I have no intention of remaining single, I
can tell you; and as for Shinsaku I would rather marry him than any one
else—so do not worry yourself further on that account. Settle the day of
the happy event.'

Needless to say, young Gisuke was delighted, and so was Shinsaku; and
they settled that the marriage should be three days thence.

Soon, when all the fishing-boats had returned to the village, the news
spread; and it would be difficult to describe the state of the younger
men's feelings. Hitherto every one had hoped to win the pretty O Cho
San; all had lived in that happy hope, and rejoiced in the uncertain
state of love, which causes such happiness in its early stages. Shinsaku
had hitherto been a general favourite. Now the whole of their hopes were
dashed to the ground. O Cho was not for any of them. As for Shinsaku,
how they suddenly hated him! What was to be done? they asked one
another, little thinking of the comical side, or that in any case O Cho
could marry only one of them.

No attention was paid to the fish they had caught; their boats were
scarcely pulled high enough on the beach for safety; their minds were
wholly given to the question how each and every one of them could marry
O Cho San. First of all, it was decided to tell Shinsaku that they would
prevent his marriage if possible. There were several fights on the quiet
beach, which had never before been disturbed by a display of
ill-feeling. At last Gisuke, O Cho's brother, consulted with his sister
and Shinsaku; and they decided, for the peace of the island, to break

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

off the marriage, O Cho and her lover determining that at all events
they would marry no one else.

However, even this great sacrifice had no effect. There were fully
thirty men; in fact, the whole of the bachelors wanted to marry O Cho;
they fought daily; the whole island was thrown into a discontent. Poor O
Cho San! What could she do? Had not she and Shinsaku done enough already
in sacrificing happiness for the peace of the island? There was only one
more thing she could do, and, being a Japanese girl, she did it. She
wrote two letters, one to her brother Gisuke, another to Shinsaku,
bidding them farewell. 'The island of Hatsushima has never had trouble
until I was born,' she said. 'For three hundred years or more our
people, though poor, have lived happily and in peace. Alas! now it is no
longer so, on account of me. Farewell! I shall be dead. Tell our people
that I have died to bring them back their senses, for they have been
foolish about me. Farewell!'

After leaving the two letters where Gisuke slept, O Cho slipped
stealthily out of the house (it was a pouring-wet and stormy night and
the 10th of June), and cast herself into the sea from some rocks near
her cottage, after well loading her sleeves with stones, so that she
might rise no more.

Next morning, when Gisuke found the letters, instinctively he knew what
must have happened, and rushed from the house to find Shinsaku. Brother
and lover read their letters together, and were stricken with grief, as,
indeed, was every one else. A search was made, and soon O Cho's straw
slippers were found on the point of rocks near her house. Gisuke knew
she must have jumped into the sea

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

here, and he and Shinsaku dived down and found her body lying at the
bottom. They brought it to the surface, and it was buried just beyond
the rocks on which she had last stood.

From that day Shinsaku was unable to sleep at night. The poor fellow was
quite distracted. O Cho's letter and straw slippers he placed beside his
bed and surrounded them with flowers. His days he spent decorating and
weeping over her tomb.

At last one evening Shinsaku resolved to make away with his own body,
hoping that his spirit might find O Cho; and he wandered towards her
tomb to take a last farewell. As he did so he thought he saw O Cho, and
called her aloud three or four times, and then with outstretched arms he
rushed delightedly at her. The noise awoke Gisuke, whose house was close
to the grave. He came out, and found Shinsaku clasping the stone pillar
which was placed at its head.

Shinsaku explained that he had seen the spirit of O Cho, and that he was
about to follow her by taking his life; but from this he was dissuaded.

'Do not do that; devote your life, rather, and I will help with you in
building a shrine dedicated to Cho. You will join her when you die by
nature; but please her spirit here by never marrying another.'

Shinsaku promised. The young men of the place now began to be deeply
sorry for Shinsaku. What selfish beasts they had been! they thought.
However, they would mend their ways, and spend all their spare time in
building a shrine to O Cho San; and this they did. The shrine is called
'The Shrine of O Cho San of Hatsushima,'

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

and a ceremony is held there every 10th of June. Curious to relate, it
invariably rains on that day, and the fishermen say that the spirit of O
Cho comes in the rain. Hence the song:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">To-day is the tenth of June. May the rain fall in
torrents!  
For I long to see my dearest O Cho San.  
Hi, Hi, Ya-re-ko-no-sa! Ya-re-ko-no-sa!</span>

</div>

The shrine still stands, I am told.
