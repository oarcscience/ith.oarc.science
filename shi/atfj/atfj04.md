### THE SPIRIT OF THE WILLOW TREE

ABOUT one thousand years ago (but according to the dates of the story
744 years ago) the temple of 'San-jû-san-gen Do' was founded. That was
in 1132. 'San-jû-san-gen Do' means hall of thirty-three spaces; and
there are said to be over 33,333 figures of the Goddess Kwannon, the
Goddess of Mercy, in the temple to-day. Before the temple was built, in
a village near by stood a willow tree of great size. It marked the
playing-ground of all the village children, who swung on its branches,
and climbed on its limbs. It afforded shade to the aged in the heat of
summer, and in the evenings, when work was done, many were the village
lads and lasses who vowed eternal love under its branches. The tree
seemed an influence for good to all. Even the weary traveller could
sleep peacefully and almost dry under its branches. Alas, even in those
times men were often ruthless with regard to trees. One day the
villagers announced an intention to cut it down and use it to build a
bridge across the river.

There lived in the village a young farmer named

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

Heitaro, a great favourite, who had lived near the old tree all his
days, as his forefathers had done; and he was greatly against cutting it
down.

Such a tree should be respected, thought he. Had it not braved the
storms of hundreds of years? In the heat of summer what pleasure it
afforded the children! Did it not give to the weary shelter, and to the
love-smitten a sense of romance? All these thoughts Heitaro impressed
upon the villagers. 'Sooner than approve your cutting it down,' he said,
'I will give you as many of my own trees as you require to build the
bridge. You must leave this dear old willow alone for ever.'

The villagers readily agreed. They also had a secret veneration for the
old tree.

Heitaro was delighted, and readily found wood with which to build the
bridge.

Some days later Heitaro, returning from his work, found standing by the
willow a beautiful girl.

Instinctively he bowed to her. She returned the bow. They spoke together
of the tree, its age and beauty. They seemed, in fact, to be drawn
towards each other by a common sympathy. Heitaro was sorry when she said
that she must be going, and bade him good-day. That evening his mind was
far from being fixed on the ordinary things of life. 'Who was the lady
under the willow tree? How I wish I could see her again!' thought he.
There was no sleep for Heitaro that night. He had caught the fever of
love.

Next day he was at his work early; and he remained at it all day,
working doubly hard, so as to try and forget the lady of the willow
tree; but on his way home in the

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

evening, behold, there was the lady again! This time she came forward to
greet him in the most friendly way.

'Welcome, good friend!' she said. 'Come and rest under the branches of
the willow you love so well, for you must be tired.'

Heitaro readily accepted this invitation, and not only did he rest, but
also he declared his love.

Day by day after this the mysterious girl (whom no others had seen) used
to meet Heitaro, and at last she promised to marry him if he asked no
questions as to her parents or friends. 'I have none,' she said. 'I can
only promise to be a good and faithful wife, and tell you that I love
you with all my heart and soul. Call me, then, "Higo," <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) and I will be your wife.'

Next day Heitaro took Higo to his house, and they were married. A son
was born to them in a little less than a year, and became their
absorbing joy. There was not a moment of their spare time in which
either Heitaro or his wife was not playing with the child, whom they
called Chiyodô. It is doubtful if a more happy home could have been
found in all Japan than the house of Heitaro, with his good wife Higo
and their beautiful child.

Alas, where in this world has complete happiness ever been known to
last? Even did the gods permit this, the laws of man would not.

When Chiyodô had reached the age of five years—the most beautiful boy in
the neighbourhood—the ex-Emperor Toba decided to build in Kyoto an
immense temple to Kwannon. He would contribute 1001 images of the
Goddess of Mercy. (Now, in 1907, as we said at

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

the beginning, this temple is known as 'San-jû-san-gen Do,' and contains
33,333 images.)

The ex-Emperor Toba's wish having become known, orders were given by the
authorities to collect timber for the building of the vast temple; and
so it came to pass that the days of the big willow tree were numbered,
for it would be wanted, with many others, to form the roof.

Heitaro tried to save the tree again by offering every other he had on
his land for nothing; but that was in vain. Even the villagers became
anxious to see their willow tree built into the temple. It would bring
them good luck, they thought, and in any case be a handsome gift of
theirs towards the great temple.

The fatal time arrived. One night, when Heitaro and his wife and child
had retired to rest and were sleeping, Heitaro was awakened by the sound
of axes chopping. To his astonishment, he found his beloved wife sitting
up in her bed, gazing earnestly at him, while tears rolled down her
cheeks and she was sobbing bitterly.

'My dearest husband,' she said with choking voice, pray listen to what I
tell you now, and do not doubt me. This is, unhappily, not a dream. When
we married I begged you not to ask me my history, and you have never
done so; but I said I would tell you some day if there should be a real
occasion to do so. Unhappily, that occasion has now arrived, my dear
husband. I am no less a thing than the spirit of the willow tree you
loved, and so generously saved six years ago. It was to repay you for
this great kindness that I appeared to you in human form under the tree,
hoping that I could

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

live with you and make you happy for your whole life. Alas, it cannot
be! They are cutting down the willow. How I feel every stroke of their
axes! I must return to die, for I am part of it. My heart breaks to
think also of leaving my darling child Chiyodô and of his great sorrow
when he knows that his mother is no longer in the world. Comfort him,
dearest husband! He is old enough and strong enough to be with you now
without a mother and yet not suffer. I wish you both long lives of
prosperity. Farewell, my dearest! I must be off to the willow, for I
hear them striking with their axes harder and harder, and it weakens me
each blow they give.'

Heitaro awoke his child just as Higo disappeared, wondering to himself
if it were not a dream. No: it was no dream. Chiyodô, awaking, stretched
his arms in the direction his mother had gone, crying bitterly and
imploring her to come back.

My darling child,' said Heitaro, 'she has gone. She cannot come back.
Come: let us dress, and go and see her funeral. Your mother was the
spirit of the Great Willow.'

A little later, at the break of day, Heitaro took Chiyodô by the hand
and led him to the tree. On reaching it they found it down, and already
lopped of its branches. The feelings of Heitaro may be well imagined.

Strange! In spite of united efforts, the men were unable to move the
stem a single inch towards the river, in which it was to be floated to
Kyoto.

On seeing this, Heitaro addressed the men.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

'My friends,' said he, 'the dead trunk of the tree which you are trying
to move contains the spirit of my wife. Perhaps, if you will allow my
little son Chiyodô to help you, it will be more easy for you; and he
would like to help in showing his last respects to his mother.'

The woodcutters were fully agreeable, and, much to their astonishment,
as Chiyodô came to the back end of the log and pushed it with his little
hand, the timber glided easily towards the river, his father singing the
while an 'Uta.' <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) There is a well-known
song or ballad in the 'Uta' style said to have sprung from this event;
it is sung to the present day by men drawing heavy weights or doing hard
labour:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Muzan naru kana  
Motowa kumanono yanagino tsuyu de  
Sodate-agetaru kono midorigo wa  
Ŷoi, Ŷoi, Ŷoito na! <span id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md)</span>

</div>

In Wakanoura the labourers sing a working or hauling song, which also is
said to have sprung from this story of the '*Yanagi no Sé*':—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Wakano urani wa meishoga gozaru  
Ichini Gongen  
Nini Tamatsushima <span id="page_18">p. 18</span>  
Sanni Sagari Matsu  
Shini Shiogama  
Ŷoi, Ŷoi, ŷoi to na. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)</span>

</div>

A third 'Uta' sprang from this story, and is often applied to small
children helping.

The waggon could not be drawn when it came to the front of Heitaro's
house, so his little five-year-old boy Chiyodô was obliged to help, and
they sang:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Muzan naru kana  
Motowa Kumanono yanagino tsuyu de
