### THE KING OF TORIJIMA <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md)

MANY years ago there lived a Daimio called Tarao. His castle and home
were at Osaki, in Osumi Province, and amongst his retinue was a faithful
and favourite servant whose name was Kume Shuzen. Kume had long been
land-steward to the Lord Tarao, and indeed acted for him in everything
connected with business.

One day Kume had been despatched to the capital, Kyoto, to attend to
business for his master, when the Daimio Toshiro of Hyuga quarrelled
with the Daimio of Osumi over some boundary question, and, Kume not
being there to help his master, who was a hasty person, the two clans
fought at the foot of Mount Kitamata.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Lord Tarao of
Osumi was killed, and so were most of his men. They were most completely
beaten. The survivors retired to their lord's castle at Osaki; but the
enemy followed them up, and again defeated them, taking the castle.

Messengers had been despatched to bring back Kume, of course; but Kume
decided that there was only one honourable thing to do, and that was to
gather the few remaining samurai he could and fight again in his dead
master's behalf. Unfortunately, only some fifty men came to his call.
These, with Kume, hid in the mountains with the intention of waiting
until they had recruited more. One of Toshiro's spies found this out,
and all except Kume were taken prisoners.

Being hotly pursued, Kume hid himself in the daytime, and made for the
sea by night. After three clays he reached Hizaki, and there, having
bought all the provision he could carry, hid himself until an
opportunity should come of seizing a boat in the darkness, hoping to
baffle his pursuers.

Kume was no sailor; in fact, he had hardly ever been in a boat, and
never except as a passenger. There was no difficulty in finding a boat.
He pushed it off and let it drift, for he could not use the oar, and
understood nothing about a sail. Fortunately, Hizaki is a long cape on
the S.E. coast, facing the open Pacific, and therefore there was no
difficulty in getting away, the wind being favourable and the tide as
well; besides, there is here a strong current always travelling south
towards the Loochoos. Kume was more or less indifferent as to where he
went, and even if he had cared he could not

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

have helped himself, for, though his knowledge of direction on land was
very good, as soon as he found himself out of sight of land he was lost.
All he knew was that where the sun rose there was no land which he could
reach, that China lay in the direction in which it set, and that to the
south there were islands which were reputed to hold savages, Nambanjin
(foreign southern savages). Thus Kume drifted on, he knew not whither,
lying in the bottom of the boat, and in no way economising his
provisions; and it naturally came to pass that at the end of the second
day he had no water left, and suffered much in consequence.

Towards morning on the fifth day Kume lay half-asleep in the bottom of
the boat. Suddenly he felt it bump.

'What ho, she bumps!' said he to himself in his native tongue, and,
sitting up, he found he had drifted on to a rocky island. Kume was not
long in scrambling ashore and dragging his boat as high as he was able.
The first thing he set about doing was to find water to quench his
thirst. As he wandered along the rocky shore hunting for a stream, Kume
knew that the island could not be inhabited, for there were tens of
thousands of sea-fowl perched upon the rocks, feeding along the beach
and floating on the water; others were sitting on eggs. Kume could see
that he was not likely to starve while the birds were breeding, and he
could see, moreover, that fish were there in abundance, for birds of the
gannet species were simply gorging themselves with a kind of iwashi
(sardine), which made the surface of the calm sea frizzle into foam in
their endeavours to

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

escape the larger fish that were pursuing them from underneath. Shoals
of flying-fish came quite close to shore, pursued by the magnificent
albacore; which clearly showed that fishermen did not visit these parts.
Shell-fish were in plenty in the coral pools, and among them lay,
thickly strewn, the smaller of the pearl mussels with which Kume was
familiar in his own country.

There was no sand on this island—that is to say, on the seashore.
Everything seemed to be of coral formation, except that there was a
thick reddish substance on the top of all, out of which grew low scrubby
trees bearing many fruits, which Kume found quite excellent to eat.
There was no trouble in finding water: there were several streams
flowing down the beach and coming from the thick scrub.

Kume returned to his boat, to make sure that it was safe, and, having
found a better cove for it, he moved it thither. Then, having eaten some
more fruit and shellfish and seaweed, Kume lay down to sleep, and to
think of his dead master, and wonder how he could eventually avenge him
on the Daimio Toshiro of Hyuga.

When morning broke Kume was not a little surprised to see some eight or
nine figures of people, as he first thought, sleeping; but when it grew
lighter he found that they were turtles, and it was not long before he
was on shore and had turned one; but then, recollecting that there was
plenty of food without taking the life of a beast so much venerated, he
let it go. 'Perhaps,' thought he, like Urashima, my kindness to the
turtle may save me. Indeed, these turtles may be messengers or retainers
of the Sea King's Palace!'

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

One thing that Kume now decided was to learn to row and sail his boat.
He set to that very morning, and almost mastered the art of using the
immense sculling oar used by present and ancient Japanese alike. In the
afternoon he visited the highest part of his island; but it was not high
enough to enable him to see land, though he thought at one time that he
could discern that faint line of blue on the horizon which prophesies
distant land.

However, he was safe for the time; he had food in plenty, and water;
true, the birds somewhat bothered him, for they did not act as might
have been expected. There seemed something uncanny in the way they sat
on their perches and watched him. He did not like that, and often threw
a stone at them; but even that had little effect—they only seemed to
look more serious.

Though Kume was no sailor, he was a good enough swimmer, as are most
Japanese who live anywhere along the sea provinces, and he was quite
able to dive in moderation and up to a depth of three Japanese
fathoms—fifteen feet. Thus it was that Kume spent all the time he was
not practising in his boat in diving for shellfish; he soon found that
there were enormous quantities of pearl oysters, which contained
beautiful pearls; and, having collected some fifty or sixty, large and
small, he cut one of the sleeves of his coat and made a bag which he
determined to fill. One day while Kume was diving about after his pearls
and shell-fish, he found that by looking in the holes of rocks beneath
the low-tide level he could find pearls that had fallen from the dead
and rotten shells above; in one case they were like gravel, and he took
them out of a cavity by handfuls. Discoloured

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

they certainly were; but Kume knew them from their roundness of shape,
and rubbing with sand or earth soon proved them to be pearls. Thus it
was that he worked with renewed energy, hoping all the time to make
sufficient money to be able eventually to avenge his dead master.

One day, some six weeks after he had landed on the island, he saw a
distant sail. Through the day he watched it carefully; but it did not
seem to come or go much nearer, and Kume came to the conclusion that it
must be the sail of a stationary fishing-boat, for there was breeze
enough to have taken it oil out of sight twice over since he had
watched, if it had wanted to go.

'Surely there must be land somewhere over there beyond the boat: it
would not be there for half a day if not. To-morrow, now that I can
manage to sail and row my boat, I will start on an expedition and see. I
do not expect to find my own countrymen there; but I may find Chinese
who may be friendly, and if I find the southern savages I shall not,
with my good Japanese sword, be afraid of them!'

Next morning Kume provisioned his boat with fruit, water, shell-fish,
and eggs, and, tying his bag of pearls about him, set sail in a
south-westerly direction. There was little wind, and the boat went
slowly; but Kume steered steadily all night, as was natural, considering
the little he knew. He dared not go to sleep and thus perhaps lose all
idea of the direction whence he had come. Thus it came that when morning
broke the sun rose on his port side, and he found himself not more than
some four miles from an island which lay

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

right ahead of him. Quite elated with his first success in navigation,
Kume seized his oars and helped the boat along. On reaching the land his
reception was anything but pleasant. At least one hundred angry savages
were on the beach with spears and staves; but what were they (as my
translator asks) to a Japanese samurai? Fifteen of them were put out of
action without his getting a scratch, for Kume was well up in all the
defensive arts that his military training had given him, and the tricks
in jujitsu were familiar to him.

The rest of his adversaries became frightened and began to run. Kume
caught one of them, and tried to ask what island this was, and what kind
of people they were. By signs he explained that he was a Japanese and in
no way an enemy, but on the contrary wished to be friendly, and, as they
could see, he was alone. Greatly impressed with Kume's prowess, and glad
that he did not wish to resume hostilities, the natives stuck their
spears point-downwards in the sand, and came forward to Kume, who
sheathed his sword and proceeded to examine the fifteen men he had laid
low. Eleven of these had fallen by some clever jujitsu trick, and were
to all intents and purposes dead; but Kume took them in various ways and
restored them to life by a well-known art called kwatsu (really
artificial breathing), which has been practised in Japan for hundreds of
years in connection with some secret jujitsu tricks which are said to
kill you—unless some one is present who knows the art of kwatsu you must
die if left for over two hours without being restored. At present it is
illegal to kill temporarily even though you know the art of kwatsu. Kume
restored nine of his

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

fallen enemies, which in itself was considered to be a marvellous
performance, and gained him much respect. Two others were dead. The rest
had wounds from which they recovered.

Peace being established, Kume was escorted by the chief to the village
and given a hut to himself, and he found the people kind and agreeable.
A wife was given to him, and Kume settled down to the life of the
island, and to learn the language, which in many ways resembled his own.

Sugar and yams were the principal things planted,—with, of course, rice
in the hills and where there was sufficient water for terracing,—but
fishing formed the principal occupation of all. Four or five times
a-year the islanders were visited by a junk which bought their produce,
and exchanged things they wanted for it—such as beds, iron rods, calico,
and salt. After three months' residence Kume was able to talk the
language a little, and had managed to narrate his adventures; moreover,
he had explained that the island from which he had sailed—he had named
it Torijima, <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md) on account of the birds
there—was a far better island than their own for all marine produce.
'Do, my friends,' said Kume, 'accompany me over there and see. I have
shown you my pearls. I am not much of a diver; but, for those that are
divers there are as many as you can wish—also sea-slugs, bêche-de-mer,
and namako of the very best kinds.'

'Do you know that the island which you call "Tori" is bewitched?' they
asked. 'It is impossible to go there, for there is a gigantic bird which
comes twice a-year and

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

kills all men who have ventured to land. It could not have been there
when you were, or you could not have lived a day.'

'Well, my friends,' said Kume, 'I am not afraid of a bird, and, as you
have been very kind to me, I should like to show you my Torijima, for,
though small, it is better than your island for all the things which
come from the sea, and you would say so if you came. Please say that
some of you will accompany me.'

At last thirty men said they would go; that would be three boat-loads of
them.

Accordingly, next evening they started, and, as the direction was well
known to the Loochooans, they reached the shores of Torijima just as the
sun arose.

Kume's boat arrived first. Though he had been fully warned of the great
bird which must have been absent when he was in the island, Kume landed
alone, and was proceeding up the shore when an immense eagle with a body
larger than his own swept down on him and began to fight. Kume, being a
Japanese, immediately cut the monster in half.

From that day Torijima has been settled on by fishermen, and has
afforded more pearls, coral, and fish than the other, which they named
Kumijima, and sometimes Shuzen shima (both being his names); moreover,
Kume Shuzen was made the king of both islands. Kume never got back to
Japan to avenge his master the Lord Tarao. Indeed, he was better off
than he had ever been before, and lived a happy life on the two wild
Loochoo islands, which had not yet come under the Chinese rule, being
too small to be thought of.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

After some fifteen years Kume died and was buried on Kumijima. My
story-teller says that those who visit the Loochoos and pass Kumijima
will notice from the sea a monument erected to Kume Shuzen.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_31"></span>[168:1](atfj30.htm#fr_31.md) It is impossible to
say exactly to which of the Torijima islands this story relates. There
are two—one a rock islet some sixty miles east of Okinawajima, the main
island on which is the capital of all the islands, Nafa; and the other
or larger Torijima, between longitude 128° and 129°, and not far south
of latitudinal line 38°. My story-teller declares the tale to be about
the Rocky Island South, which charts show as 60 feet above water at high
tide, by reason of there being an island adjacent called Kumeshima;
while I argue that it is more probably about the northern Torijima,
adjacent to which is a large island named Takuneshima, which might very
well have been meant for Kumeshima. With Japanese, Chinese, and English
names, these islands are very puzzling. The Japanese, though excellent
map-makers, are bad geographers, changing names as they think fit.
