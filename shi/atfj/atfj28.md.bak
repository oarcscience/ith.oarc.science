### HOW MASAKUNI REGAINED HIS SIGHT

SOME seventy years ago there dwelt in Kyoto a celebrated swordmaker, a
native of the province of Awa, in Tokushima. Awanokami Masakuni—for such
was his name—dwelt in Kyoto for the purpose of business, and because he
was nearer the homes of the grandees, for whom it paid him best to make
swords. With him lived his beautiful little daughter Ai, or O Ai San
('Ai' meaning 'love'). She was fourteen, and only a child; but her
beauty was enough to make her an object of affection to any one who
happened to see her. O Ai thought of no one but her father, and of him
she was extremely fond.

As time went on Masakuni so improved in the art of making swords and
forging blades that he came to be regarded with much jealousy by the
other swordmakers, all of whom, including Masakuni, lived in the
Karasu-Tengu district of Kyoto, where it was the fashion for swordmakers
to dwell in those days. Alas, the skill of Masakuni cost him an eye!
Though the samurai and wearers of swords held ethical ideas of honour
and Bushi said to be far above the average, it does not appear that

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

the swordmakers were the same. They often committed the most horrible
and cowardly crimes. One of these was to put out either one or both of
the eyes of their sword-making rivals while they slept. Thus it came to
pass one night that little O Ai San was awakened from her sleep by the
piercing cry of her father, and found him writhing on the floor in
agony, with his right eye stabbed and burst.

O Ai summoned aid; but nothing could save the eye. It was done for; and,
though the place could be healed, Masakuni must give up all idea of ever
having the use of his right eye again. There was not even the
satisfaction of catching his assailant, for he did not know who it was.
Amid these circumstances it was evident that Masakuni could no longer
remain a swordmaker: after the loss of his eye it would be impossible
for him to carry out any of the fine work needed to keep up his
reputation. Consequently, he returned to his native village, Ohara, in
the province of Awa, with his daughter.

Poor Masakuni had not been long settled in his old home before his left
eye began to feel bad, and in less than a week there appeared to be
every chance of his losing its use altogether.

Ai was disconsolate. For her dear father to lose the use of both eyes
was terrible. She loved him dearly, and knew that his only remaining
pleasures in life were herself and beautiful scenery. What could she do,
poor child? She waited on him day and night, cooked, and was his nurse.
When she had exhausted every means in her power to do good, and her
father's left eye grew worse, she betook herself to praying. Daily she
toiled up the

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

wild and rocky mountain of Shiratake, near the summit of which there was
a little shrine dedicated to Fudo, sometimes thought of as the God of
Wisdom. There, day after day, she prayed that she might be led to the
knowledge that would cure her father, and, though it was now the icy
month of January, after so doing she divested herself of clothing and
stood for nearly half an hour under the waterfall from which the
mountain takes its name, as was the custom of all who wished to impress
upon the Deity the earnestness and sincerity of their prayers.

For three months O Ai had thus gone up the mountain daily to pray and
undergo the terrible cold of the waterfall; yet her prayer seemed
unanswered, for there was no improvement in her father. O Ai, however,
did not lose heart. Towards the end of February she climbed again. In
spite of the severe cold (ice was hanging on to many parts of the rock),
O Ai, after praying to Fudo San, divested herself of clothing and
stepped under the fall, there to continue her prayers as long as she
could possibly stand and live. So great was the cold, in a few moments
she lost consciousness, and slipped down into the basin of the fall,
receiving a severe blow on the head.

Just then, by unusual good fortune, an old man, followed by his servant,
came up the mountain and was looking at and admiring the waterfall. The
white body of O Ai San caught his eye while it was being churned in the
basin of the fall not thirty feet from where he stood. The old man and
the servant hastened to pull out the body and began to rub it, and found
that life was not extinct. O Ai was half-drowned and numbed,

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

insensible from cold and the blow, and the blood was flowing freely from
the wound.

They made up their minds to save this beautiful girl, and set to with
vigour. A fire was lit; her clothes were warmed and put on; and in less
than twenty minutes she had opened her eyes and was able to speak.
Seeing this, the old man asked:

'Is it by accident we find you thus nearly dead, or have you tried to
take your own life?'

'No,' said the girl: 'it is not that I wish to take my own life. It is
to save the eyesight of my father that I have come here to pray; this is
the hundredth day of my prayer. To-morrow and every following day I
shall be here to pray again, and so continue; for it is against the
teachings of Buddha to despair.' O Ai then related the history of her
father's blindness.

The old man, answering, said:

'If devotion to duty has its reward, yours, young lady, has come.
Perhaps you are not aware who I am. My name is Uozumi, Dr. Uozumi. I am
the chief doctor in Kyoto, and am the only one at present who has passed
his full degrees in the Medical Sciences of the Dutch. I have just been
to the Palace at Yedo, and am now on my return to Kyoto. I have only put
in here with my ship for to-day, and have come up this mountain to
admire the scenery. Now I have found you, and so grieve with you in your
trouble that I will stay here a week or two and see what can be done for
your father. Do not let us lose time: put on the rest of your clothes,
and let us go to your house.'

O Ai San was delighted. At last, she thought, her

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

prayer had been answered by Fudo San. With joy in her heart, she almost
ran down the mountain, forgetting all about her own narrow escape and
the long gash she had received in her head. Dr. Uozumi found it hard to
keep anywhere near this healthy young maid.

Arrived at the house, Uozumi made an examination of the patient and
ordered remedies after the Dutch prescriptions, the medicines for which
he fortunately had with him. Day after day the doctor and O Ai attended
on Masakuni, and at the end of the tenth day his left eye was perfectly
cured.

Masakuni was delighted at the partial recovery of his sight, and, like
his daughter, attributed the good fortune of the celebrated doctor's
arrival to the mercy of Fudo San. Having purified his body and soul by
living on a vegetable diet and bathing in cold water for ten days, he
began making two swords, which some time afterwards he finished. One he
presented to the god Fudo, and the other to Doctor Uozumi. They were
afterwards known as the celebrated swords made by the semi-blind
Masakuni.

The doctor thought it a pity to allow such a skilled artist as Masakuni
to remain in this remote village of Awa Province, and also that the
beautiful O Ai should be allowed to rust there: so he persuaded them to
join him in Kyoto. Subsequently he obtained a place as maid of honour in
the palace of the Duke of Karasumaru for O Ai San, where she was
perfectly happy.

Five years later Masakuni died, and was buried in the cemetery of
Toribeyama, at the eastern end of Kyoto. So my story-teller, Fukuga,
tells me.
