### A LIFE SAVED BY A SPIDER AND TWO DOVES

OF Yoritomo *Murray* says that 'he lived from 1147 to 1199. He was the
founder of the Shogunate—the first Japanese Mayor of the Palace, if one
may so phrase it. A scion of the great house of Minamoto, as shrewd and
ambitious as he was unscrupulous and inhuman, he was left an orphan at
an early age, and barely escaped death as a lad at the hands of
Kiyomori, the then all-powerful minister who belonged to the rival house
of Taira.'

In this excellently-concentrated epitome of Yoritomo's fifty-two years
of life, it will readily be seen that he must have had innumerable
adventures. Fighting went on throughout his career; yet oddly enough, in
spite of all this, he died comfortably in bed.

In the earlier half of Yoritomo's time he was once severely defeated at
a battle against Oba Kage-chika in the Ishibashi mountains, in the
province of Izu. So bad had been his defeat that Yoritomo, with six of
his most faithful followers, to use vulgar language, made a bolt of it.
They ran, not over-boldly, but to save their skins,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

and in their haste to escape Oba Kage-chika's men they took, like hunted
hares, to a large forest, hoping there to escape by lying concealed.
After they had pushed their way into the thickest and heaviest part of
the forest, they came to an enormous hi no ki tree, partly rotten, and
containing a hollow which was large enough to hide them all. Yoritomo
and his six followers eagerly sought refuge within the tree, for in
their state of tiredness they could not long hope to escape the large
and active forces of Oba Kage-chika, which were following up their
victory by hunting out and cutting off all those who had fled. When he
reached the edge of the forest, Oba Kage-chika sent his cousin Oba
Kagetoki to search for Yoritomo, saying: 'Go, my cousin, and bring in
our enemy Yoritomo. It is the opportunity of your life, for sure it is
that he must be in this forest. I myself will endeavour, as our men come
up, to place them so as to surround the forest.' Oba Kagetoki was not
pleased with his mission, for at one time he had known and been friendly
with Yoritomo. However, he bowed low to his cousin and went off. Half an
hour after starting Oba Kagetoki came to the enormous tree, and found
his old friend Yoritomo and his six faithful attendants. His heart
softened, and, instead of carrying out his duty, he returned to Oba
Kage-chika, saying that he had been unable to find the enemy, and that
in his opinion Yoritomo had escaped from the wood.

Oba Kage-chika was very angry, and openly said that he did not believe
his cousin—that to escape from the wood was impossible in such a short
time.

'Come!' said he. 'Follow me, some fifteen or twenty

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

of you; and you, my cousin, lead the way and show us where you went, and
play fair, or you shall suffer for it!'

Thus bid, Kagetoki led the way, carefully avoiding the big tree, for he
was determined to save the life of Yoritomo if he could. By some
misfortune, however, he chose an abominably bad path, and Kage-chika,
having on a particularly heavy suit of armour, cried out, 'Enough of
your leading! Let us stick to the road by which we started. It is more
likely to be the one which our fugitives took. In any case, this is no
road at all where you lead us, and with heavy armour on it is
impossible.'

Thus it was that in due time they reached the huge tree. Kagetoki was
much afraid that his cousin would go into the hollow and find Yoritomo,
and set to think how he could save him.

Kage-chika was about to enter the hollow tree when a bright idea
occurred to Kagetoki.

'Hold!' said he. 'It is no use wasting time by going in there. Can't you
see that there is a spider's web right across the entrance? It would
have been quite impossible for any one to get inside without breaking
it.

Kage-chika was half-inclined to agree that his cousin was right; but,
being still a little suspicious about him, he put in his bow to feel
what was inside. Just as his bow was about to be thrust against
Yoritomo's heavy armour (which would naturally have revealed his
presence), two beautiful white doves flew out of the top of the hole.

You are right, cousin,' said Kage-chika, laughing, when he saw the
doves: 'I am wasting time here, for no

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

one can be in this tree with wild doves in it, besides the entrance
being closed by a cobweb.'

Thus it was that Yoritomo's life was saved by a spider and two doves.
When he became Shogun in later years, and fixed upon Kamakura as his
place of residence and as the seat of government, two shrines were built
in the temple of Tsuru-ga-oka, which itself is dedicated to Hachiman,
the God of War. One is dedicated to the Emperor Nintoku, son of Ojin,
the God of War, and the other to Yoritomo, called Shirahata Jinja. The
shrines were erected to show Yoritomo's gratitude to the God of War, for
doves are known in Japan as the messengers of war, not of peace.

NOTE.—I think that the shrine called by *Murray* 'Shirahata,' which
means *White Flag*, is really '*Shiro hato*,' *the white doves*. The
following is from Murray:—

The Temple of Hachiman, the God of War, dating from the end of the
twelfth century, stands in a commanding position on a hill called
Tsuru-ga-oka, and is approached by a stately avenue of pine trees
leading up the whole way from the seashore. Though both avenue and
temple have suffered from the ravages of time, enough still remains to
remind one of the ancient glories of the place. Three stone *torii* lead
up to the temple, which stands at the head of a broad flight of stone
steps. Notice the magnificent icho tree, nearly 20 feet in
circumference, and said to be over a thousand years old, and the
flowering trees scattered about the grounds.

Before ascending the flight of steps, the minor shrines to the rear
deserve notice. The nearer one, painted red and called Wakamiya, is
dedicated to the Emperor Nintoku, son of the God of War. The farther
one, renovated in 1890, is called Shirahata Jinja, and dedicated to
Yoritomo. The style and structure are

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

somewhat unusual, black and gold being the only colours employed, and
iron being the material of the four main pillars. The interior holds a
small wooden image of Yoritomo.

A side path leads up hence to the main temple, which is enclosed in a
square colonnade painted red. The temple, which was re-erected in 1828,
after having been destroyed by fire seven years previously, is in the
Ryobu Shinto style, with red pillars, beams, and rafters, and is
decorated with small painted carvings, chiefly of birds and animals. In
the colonnade are several religious palanquins (mikoshi) used on the
occasion of the semi-annual festivals (April 15 and December 15), a
wooden image of Sumiyoshi by Unkei, and a few relics of Yoritomo. Most
of the relics once preserved in the temple have been removed to the
residence of the Chief Priest (Hakozaki Oyatsu-kwan), and are only
exhibited at festival times.

Immediately behind the temple of Hachiman is a small hill called
Shirabata-yama, whence Yoritomo is said to have often admired the
prospect. The base of the hill is enclosed and laid out as a garden.
