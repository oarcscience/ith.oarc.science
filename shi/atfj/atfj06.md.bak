### GHOST STORY OF THE FLUTE'S TOMB <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md)

LONG ago, at a small and out-of-the-way village called Kumedamura, about
eight miles to the south-east of Sakai city, in Idsumo Province, there
was made a tomb, the Fuezuka or Flute's Tomb, and to this day many
people go thither to offer up prayer and to worship, bringing with them
flowers and incense-sticks, which are deposited as offerings to the
spirit of the man who was buried there. All the year round people flock
to it. There is no season at which they pray more particularly than at
another.

The Fuezuka tomb is situated on a large pond called Kumeda, some five
miles in circumference, and all the places around this pond are known as
of Kumeda Pond, from which the village of Kumeda took its name.

Whose tomb can it be that attracts such sympathy The tomb itself is a
simple stone pillar, with nothing artistic to recommend it. Neither is
the surrounding scenery interesting; it is flat and ugly until the
mountains of Kiushu are reached. I must tell, as well as I can, the
story of whose tomb it is.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

Between seventy and eighty years ago there lived near the pond in the
village of Kumedamura a blind amma <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)
called Yoichi. Yoichi was extremely popular in the neighbourhood, being
very honest and kind, besides being quite a professor in the art of
massage—a treatment necessary to almost every Japanese. It would be
difficult indeed to find a village that had not its amma.

Yoichi was blind, and, like all men of his calling, carried an iron wand
or stick, also a flute or 'fuezuka'—the stick to feel his way about
with, and the flute to let people know he was ready for employment. So
good an amma was Yoichi, he was nearly always employed, and,
consequently, fairly well off, having a little house of his own and one
servant, who cooked his food.

A little way from Yoichi's house was a small teahouse, placed upon the
banks of the pond. One evening (April 5; cherry-blossom season), just at
dusk, Yoichi was on his way home, having been at work all day. His road
led him by the pond. There he heard a girl crying piteously. He stopped
and listened for a few moments, and gathered from what he heard that the
girl was about to drown herself. Just as she entered the lake Yoichi
caught her by the dress and dragged her out.

'Who are you, and why in such trouble as to wish to die?' he asked.

'I am Asayo, the teahouse girl,' she answered. 'You know me quite well.
You must know, also, that it is not possible for me to support myself
out of the small pittance which is paid by my master. I have eaten
nothing for two days now, and am tired of my life.'

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

'Come, come!' said the blind man. 'Dry your tears. I will take you to my
house, and do what I can to help you. You are only twenty-five years of
age, and I am told still a fair-looking girl. Perhaps you will marry! In
any case, I will take care of you, and you must not think of killing
yourself. Come with me now; and I will see that you are well fed, and
that dry clothes are given you.'

So Yoichi led Asayo to his home.

A few months found them wedded to each other. Were they happy? Well,
they should have been, for Yoichi treated his wife with the greatest
kindness; but she was unlike her husband. She was selfish, bad-tempered,
and unfaithful. In the eyes of Japanese infidelity is the worst of sins.
How much more, then, is it against the country's spirit when advantage
is taken of a husband who is blind?

Some three months after they had been married, and in the heat of
August, there came to the village a company of actors. Among them was
Sawamura Tamataro, of some repute in Asakusa.

Asayo, who was very fond of a play, spent much of her time and her
husband's money in going to the theatre. In less than two days she had
fallen violently in love with Tamataro. She sent him money, hardly
earned by her blind husband. She wrote to him love-letters, begged him
to allow her to come and visit him, and generally disgraced her sex.

Things went from bad to worse. The secret meetings of Asayo and the
actor scandalised the neighbourhood. As in most such cases, the husband
knew nothing about

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

them. Frequently, when he went home, the actor was in his house, but
kept quiet, and Asayo let him out secretly, even going with him
sometimes.

Every one felt sorry for Yoichi; but none liked to tell him of his
wife's infidelity.

One day Yoichi went to shampoo a customer, who told him of Asayo's
conduct. Yoichi was incredulous.

'But yes: it is true,' said the son of his customer. 'Even now the actor
Tamataro is with your wife. So soon as you left your house he slipped
in. This he does every day, and many of us see it. We all feel sorry for
you in your blindness, and should be glad to help you to punish her.'

Yoichi was deeply grieved, for he knew that his friends were in earnest;
but, though blind, he would accept no assistance to convict his wife. He
trudged home as fast as his blindness would permit, making as little
noise as possible with his staff.

On reaching home Yoichi found the front door fastened from the inside.
He went to the back, and found the same thing there. There was no way of
getting in without breaking a door and making a noise. Yoichi was much
excited now; for he knew that his guilty wife and her lover were inside,
and he would have liked to kill them both. Great strength came to him,
and he raised himself bit by hit until he reached the top of the roof.
He intended to enter the house by letting himself down through the
'tem-mado.' <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) Unfortunately, the straw
rope he used in doing this was rotten, and gave way, precipitating him
below, where he

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

fell on the kinuta. <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) He fractured his
skull, and died instantly.

Asayo and the actor, hearing the noise, went to see what had happened,
and were rather pleased to find poor Yoichi dead. They did not report
the death until next day, when they said that Yoichi had fallen
downstairs and thus killed himself.

They buried him with indecent haste, and hardly with proper respect.

Yoichi having no children, his property, according to the Japanese law,
went to his bad wife, and only a few months passed before Asayo and the
actor were married. Apparently they were happy, though none in the
village of Kumeda had any sympathy for them, all being disgusted at
their behaviour to the poor blind shampooer Yoichi.

Months passed by without event of any interest in the village. No one
bothered about Asayo and her husband; and they bothered about no one
else, being sufficiently interested in themselves. The scandal-mongers
had become tired, and, like all nine-day wonders, the history of the
blind amma, Asayo, and Tamataro had passed into silence.

However, it does not do to be assured while the spirit of the injured
dead goes unavenged.

Up in one of the western provinces, at a small village called Minato,
lived one of Yoichi's friends, who was closely connected with him. This
was Okuda Ichibei. He and Yoichi had been to school together. They had
promised when Ichibei went up to the north-west always

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

to remember each other, and to help each other in time of need, and when
Yoichi had become blind Ichibei came down to Kumeda and helped to start
Yoichi in his business of amma, which he did by giving him a house to
live in—a house which had been bequeathed to Ichibei. Again fate decreed
that it should be in Ichibei's power to help his friend. At that time
news travelled very slowly, and Ichibei had not immediately heard of
Yoichi's death or even of his marriage. Judge, then, of his surprise,
one night on awaking, to find, standing near his pillow, the figure of a
man whom by and by he recognised as Yoichi!

'Why, Yoichi! I am glad to see you,' he said; 'but how late at night you
have arrived! Why did you not let me know you were coming? I should have
been up to receive you, and there would have been a hot meal ready. But
never mind. I will call a servant, and everything shall be ready as soon
as possible. In the meantime be seated, and tell me about yourself, and
how you travelled so far. To have come through the mountains and other
wild country from Kumeda is hard enough at best; but for one who is
blind it is wonderful.'

'I am no longer a living man,' answered the ghost of Yoichi (for such it
was). 'I am indeed your friend Yoichi's spirit, and I shall wander about
until I can be avenged for a great ill which has been done me. I have
come to beg of you to help me, that my spirit may go to rest. If you
listen I will tell my story, and you can then do as you think best.'

Ichibei was very much astonished (not to say a little

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

nervous) to know that he was in the presence of a ghost; but he was a
brave man, and Yoichi had been his friend. He was deeply grieved to hear
of Yoichi's death, and realised that the restlessness of his spirit
showed him to have been injured. Ichibei decided not only to listen to
the story but also to revenge Yoichi, and said so.

The ghost then told all that had happened since he had been set up in
the house at Kumedamura. He told of his success as a masseur; of how he
had saved the life of Asayo, how he had taken her to his house and
subsequently married her; of the arrival of the accursed acting company
which contained the man who had ruined his life; of his own death and
hasty burial; and of the marriage of Asayo and the actor. 'I must be
avenged. Will you help me to rest in peace?' he said in conclusion.

Ichibei promised. Then the spirit of Yoichi disappeared, and Ichibei
slept again.

Next morning Ichibei thought he must have been dreaming; but he
remembered the vision and the narrative so clearly that he perceived
them to have been actual. Suddenly turning with the intention to get up,
he caught sight of the shine of a metal flute close to his pillow. It
was the flute of a blind amma. It was marked with Yoichi's name.

Ichibei resolved to start for [Kumedamura](errata.htm#0.md) and ascertain
locally all about Yoichi.

In those times, when there was no railway and a rickshaw only here and
there, travel was slow. Ichibei took ten days to reach
[Kumedamura](errata.htm#1.md). He immediately went to the house of his
friend Yoichi, and was there told

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

the whole history again, but naturally in another way. Asayo said:

'Yes: he saved my life. We were married, and I helped my blind husband
in everything. One day, alas, he mistook the staircase for a door,
falling down and killing himself. Now I am married to his great friend,
an actor called Tamataro, whom you see here.'

Ichibei knew that the ghost of Yoichi was not likely to tell him lies,
and to ask for vengeance unjustly. Therefore he continued talking to
Asayo and her husband, listening to their lies, and wondering what would
be the fitting procedure.

Ten o'clock passed thus, and eleven. At twelve o'clock, when Asayo for
the sixth or seventh time was assuring Ichibei that everything possible
had been done for her blind husband, a wind storm suddenly arose, and in
the midst of it was heard the sound of the amma's flute, just as Yoichi
played it; it was so unmistakably his that Asayo screamed with fear.

At first distant, nearer and nearer approached the sound, until at last
it seemed to be in the room itself. At that moment a cold puff of air
came down the tem-mado, and the ghost of Yoichi was seen standing
beneath it, a cold, white, glimmering and sad-faced wraith.

Tamataro and his wife tried to get up and run out of the house; but they
found that their legs would not support them, so full were they of fear.

Tamataro seized a lamp and flung it at the ghost; but the ghost was not
to be moved. The lamp passed through him, and broke, setting fire to the
house, which burned instantly, the wind fanning the flames.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

Ichibei made his escape; but neither Asayo nor her husband could move,
and the flames consumed them in the presence of Yoichi's ghost. Their
cries were loud and piercing.

Ichibei had all the ashes swept up and placed in a tomb. He had buried
in another grave the flute of the blind amma, and erected on the ground
where the house had been a monument sacred to the memory of Yoichi.

It is known as FUEZUKA NO KWAIDAN. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)
