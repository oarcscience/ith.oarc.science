------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a memorable collection of historical legends and folktales from
Japan. Nearly all of them are set in a well-defined time and place,
instead of 'once upon a time.' Themes include ghosts; unrequited love
across social boundaries; Shinto landscape, tree and ocean spirits; and
tales driven by Bushido and Buddhist ethics. Not a few of these yarns
end up with someone committing Seppuku.

Smith does not try to dress up the language or narrative for westerners,
or sentimentalize the stories. Instead, he tells each story very
literally, even when they include supernatural elements. The result is
an anthology of Japanese 'magical realist' tales which contemporary
readers will find appealing.

Each chapter, with one exception, is illustrated by one or more colorful
plates done in a typical 19th century Japanese style, all of which are
included in this etext.
