### THE HEIR-APPARENT MOTO-YOSHI

### MOTO-YOSHI SHINNŌ

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Wabi nureba  
Ima hata onaji  
  Naniwa naru  
Mi wo tsukushite mo  
Awamu to zo omou.

WE met but for a moment, and  
  I'm wretched as before;  
The *tide* shall *measure* out my life,  
  Unless I see once more  
  The maid, whom I adore.

</div>

The composer of this verse was the son of the Emperor Yōzei, who reigned
A.D. 877-884; he was noted for his love-affairs, and he died in the year
943.

*Mi wo tsukushite mo* means 'even though I die in the attempt', but
*miotsukushi* is a graduated stick, set up to measure the rise and fall
of the tide; and Naniwa, the modern seaport of Osaka, seems to have been
inserted chiefly as the place where this tide-gauge was set up. The poet
may have meant, that the river of his tears was so deep as to require a
gauge to measure it; or, as Professor MacCauley reads it, he was
hinting, that if he could not attain his ends his body would be found at
the tide-gauge in Naniwa Bay. The picture seems to show the poet on the
verandah and his lady-love looking through the screen.
