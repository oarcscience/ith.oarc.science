### PRINCESS SHIKISHI

### SHIKISHI NAISHINNŌ

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Tama no o yo  
Taenaba taene  
  Nagaraeba  
Shinoburu koto no  
Yowari mo zo suru.

THE ailments of advancing years  
  Though I should try to hide,  
Some day the thread will break, the pearls  
  Be scattered far and wide;  
  Age cannot be defied.

</div>

The Princess was the daughter of the Emperor Goshirakawa, who reigned
A.D. 1156-1158. In this short reign, however, the country suffered from
a very severe earthquake and a devastating civil war.

The second line is a play upon the two verbs *tae*, which are both
pronounced the same, but which are written with different ideographic
characters. The first couplet, taken literally, reads, 'If the string of
pearls (i.e. my life) *break*, I must *bear* it.'

The illustration seems to show the Princess sitting down with a nobleman
in attendance.
