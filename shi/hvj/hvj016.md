### 15

### THE EMPEROR KWŌKŌ

### KWŌKŌ TENNŌ

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Kimi ga tame  
Haru no no ni idete  
  Wakana tsumu  
Waga koromode ni  
Yuki wa furi-tsutsu.

MOTHER, for thy sake I have been  
  Where the wakana grow,  
To bring thee back some fresh green leaves  
  And see—my koromo  
  Is sprinkled with the snow!

</div>

Kwōkō was raised to the throne by the Fujiwara family, when the mad
Emperor Yōzei was deposed; he reigned A.D. 885-887, and is said to have
composed this verse in honour of his grandmother.

*Wakana*, literally 'young leaves', is a vegetable in season at the New
Year; a *koromo* is really a priest's garment, but is used here for the
Emperor's robe.

In the picture we see the Emperor gathering the fresh green leaves, and
the snow falling from the sky.
