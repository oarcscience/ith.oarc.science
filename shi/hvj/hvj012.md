<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Wada no hara  
Yasoshima kakete  
  Kogi idenu to  
Hito ni wa tsugeyo  
Ama no tsuribune.

OH! Fishers in your little boats,  
  Quick! tell my men, I pray,  
They'll find me at Yasoshima,  
  I'm being rowed away  
  Far off across the bay.

</div>

<span class="small">Takamura, a well-known scholar, rose from poverty to
riches on being appointed a Custom-house officer for the ships trading
to and from China. His enemies reported him to the Emperor as an
extortioner and a thief, and he was deported to Yasoshima, a group of
small islands off the coast; he is said to have composed this song and
sung it to the fishing-boats, as he was being carried off. He was
afterwards pardoned and reinstated, dying in the year 852.</span>
