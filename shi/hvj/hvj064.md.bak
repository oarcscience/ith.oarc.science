<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Ima wa tada  
Omoi-taenamu  
  Tobakari wo  
Hitozute narade  
Iu yoshi mo gana.

IF we could meet in privacy,  
  Where no one else could see,  
Softly I'd whisper in thy ear  
  This little word from me—  
  'I'm dying, Love, for thee.'

</div>

<span class="small">Michimasa was a member of the Fujiwara family, who
lived about the year 1030. He fell in love with the Princess Masako, a
priestess of Ise; but when the Emperor heard of this, he put the
Princess into confinement, where she was strictly guarded by female
warders, and this verse was Michimasa's request to her to try to arrange
a private meeting with him. The words *omoi-taenamu*, which is the
message he sends to her, mean, 'I shall die of love'; but they can also
mean 'I shall think no more about you'; so perhaps he intended the verse
to be read in different ways, according to whether it reached the
Princess, or fell into the hands of her guards. In the picture Michimasa
is shown outside the fortress, where the Princess is confined.</span>
