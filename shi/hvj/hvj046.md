### 45

### PRINCE KEN-TOKU

### KEN-TOKU KO

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Aware to mo  
Iu beki hito wa  
  Omohoede  
Mi no itazura ni  
Narinu beki kana.

I DARE not hope my lady-love  
  Will smile on me again;  
She knows no Pity, and my life  
  I care not to retain,  
  Since all my prayers are vain.

</div>

The real name of the writer of this verse was Koretada Fujiwara; he died
in the year 972, and Prince Ken-toku is his posthumous name.

*Aware to mo* means, in conjunction with the next line, 'that she would
give me words of pity'; but *aware tomo* can also mean 'to meet as a
friend.'

In spite of the Prince's fears, the illustration seems to suggest that
his lady-love changed her mind, and came to visit him once more.
