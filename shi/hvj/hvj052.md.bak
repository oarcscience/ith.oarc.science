### 51

### THE MINISTER SANEKATA FUJIWARA

### FUJIWARA NO SANEKATA ASON

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Kaku to dani  
Eyawa Ibuki no  
  Sashi-mogusa  
Sashimo shiraji na  
Moyuru omoi wo.

THOUGH love, like blisters made from leaves  
  Grown on Mount Ibuki,  
Torments me more than I can say,  
  My lady shall not see,  
  How she is paining me.

</div>

<span class="small">The writer lived some time at the close of the tenth
century. The artemisia plant (or mugwort) is used in Japan for
cauterizing; a conical wad of the leaves or blossoms is placed on the
spot, lit at the top, and allowed to burn down to the skin; this
produces a blister, and is extremely painful. Ibuki is a hill, between
the Provinces of Omi and Mino, famous for its artemisia, but *ibuki* can
also stand for *iu beki*, which, in conjunction with *e ya wa*, would
mean, 'Ah! how could I tell her!' But *eyawa* as one word means
'indescribable!' Notice also *sashimo* in the third and fourth lines
*sashi-mogusa* means 'the artemisia plant', but *sashi mo* means 'even
though it is smarting'; *sashimo*, in one word, can also mean 'in such a
way'. This verse is a very good example of the way the Japanese love to
play upon words. The picture seems to show Mount Ibuki with the mugwort
growing on it.</span>
