<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hana sasou<br> Arashi no niwa no<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yuki narade<br> Furi yuku mono wa<br> Waga mi nari keri.</p>  
<p>THIS snow is not from blossoms white<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Wind-scattered, here and there,<br> That whiten all my garden paths<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the branches bare;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Tis age that snows my hair!</div></p>  
<p><small>The writer's name was Kintsune; he retired from office to enter the church, and died in the year 1244, aged seventy-six.</p>  
<p>Note the play upon <i>yuki</i>, 'snow,' and <i>yuku</i>, the verb 'to go'; <i>furi yuku</i> means 'going to fall' (as snow), but <i>furi</i> also suggests the idea of 'growing old'. He says it is really he himself that is fading and falling, rather than the petals of his garden flowers blown by the storm.</p>  
<p>The picture does not seem to illustrate the verse very well; it is probably meant to show Kintsune on his verandah, lamenting over his increasing years; but in the original edition, from which the pictures were taken, fallen cherry blossoms are shown underneath the verse at the bottom of the page.</small></p>
