<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Chi haya furu<br> Kami yo mo kikazu<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Tatsuta gawa<br> Kara kurenai ni<br> Mizu kuguru to wa.</p>  
<p>ALL red with leaves Tatsuta's stream<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;So softly purls along,<br> The everlasting Gods themselves,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who judge 'twixt right and wrong,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ne'er heard so sweet a song.</div></p>  
<p><small>The writer, who lived A.D. 825-880, was the grandson of the Emperor Saga, and was the Don Juan of Old Japan; he was banished because of an intrigue he had with the Empress, and his adventures are fully related in the Ise-Monogatari. The Tatsuta stream is not far from Nara, and is famous for its maples in autumn. <i>Chi haya furu</i>, literally 'thousand quick brandishing (swords)', is a 'pillow-word', or recognized epithet, for the Gods, and almost corresponds to Virgil's <i>Pious &AElig;neas</i>, and Homer's '<i>Odysseus, the son of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices</i>'. It may be noted that these 'pillow-words' only occur in the five-syllable lines, never in the longer lines.</p>  
<p>In the picture we see the poet looking at a screen, on which is depicted the river with the red maple leaves floating on it.</small></p>
