<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashibiki no<br> Yamadori no o no<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Shidario no<br> Naga-nagashi yo wo<br> Hitori ka mo nemu.</p>  
<p>LONG is the mountain pheasant's tail<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That curves down in its flight;<br> But longer still, it seems to me,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Left in my lonely plight,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is this unending night.</div></p>  
<p><small>The writer was a foundling, picked up and adopted by Abaye at the foot of a persimmon tree, which is in Japanese kaki, from which he got his name. He was an attendant on the Emperor Mommu, who reigned A.D. 697-707, and was one of the great poets of the early days of Japan; he is known as the rival of Akahito Yamabe (see next verse), and after death was deified as a God of Poetry. There is a temple erected in his honour at Ichi-no-Moto, and another at Akashi, not far from Kobe; he died in the year 737.</p>  
<p>In the fourth line <i>nagashi</i> may be taken as the adjective 'long', or the verb 'to drift along'; and <i>yo</i> may mean either 'night' or 'life'; so that this line, which I have taken as 'long, long is the night', may also mean 'my life is drifting, drifting along'. <i>Yamadori</i> (pheasant) is literally 'mountain bird', and <i>ashibiki</i> is a pillow-word for mountain, which is itself the first half of the word for pheasant.</small></p>
