### THE MOTHER OF THE MINISTER OF STATE

### GIDŌ-SANSHI NO HAHA

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Wasureji no  
Yukusue made wa  
  Katakereba  
Kyō wo kagiri no  
Inochi tomo gana.

HOW difficult it is for men  
  Not to forget the past!  
I fear my husband's love for me  
  Is disappearing fast;  
  This day must be my last.

</div>

<span class="small">The real name of this lady was Taka, and her son's
name was Korechika Fujiwara. She lived about A.D. 1004, and it is
supposed that this verse was written in a fit of jealousy against her
husband; she is shown in the picture all alone at home bewailing her
lot.</span>
