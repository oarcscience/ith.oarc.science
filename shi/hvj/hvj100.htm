<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hito mo oshi<br> Hito mo urameshi<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ajiki-naku<br> Yo wo omou yue ni.<br> Mono omou mi wa.</p>  
<p>How I regret my fallen friends<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How I despise my foes!<br> And, tired of life, I only seek<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To reach my long day's close,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And gain at last repose.</div></p>  
<p><small>The Emperor Gotoba, or Toba II, reigned A.D. 1186-1198. He was the son of the retired Emperor Takakura, and was banished to Amagori, in the Oki Islands, where he took the name of Sen-Tei, busied himself in making swords, and died in the year 1239. He was very sensitive to noises, and it is said that the frogs of the pool of Shike-kuro have been dumb ever since the year 1200; for their croaking at night disturbed his rest, and he commanded them to be silent. It was in the eleventh year of his reign that the title of Sh&#333;gun was created and conferred upon the great General Yoritomo; which title, down to the year 1868, was borne by the real rulers of the country, the Emperor himself being not much more than a figure-head.</p>
