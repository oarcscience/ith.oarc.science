### THE NOBLEMAN KAKI-NO-MOTO

### KAKI-NO-MOTO NO HITOMARO

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Ashibiki no  
Yamadori no o no  
  Shidario no  
Naga-nagashi yo wo  
Hitori ka mo nemu.

LONG is the mountain pheasant's tail  
  That curves down in its flight;  
But longer still, it seems to me,  
  Left in my lonely plight,  
  Is this unending night.

</div>

The writer was a foundling, picked up and adopted by Abaye at the foot
of a persimmon tree, which is in Japanese kaki, from which he got his
name. He was an attendant on the Emperor Mommu, who reigned A.D.
697-707, and was one of the great poets of the early days of Japan; he
is known as the rival of Akahito Yamabe (see next verse), and after
death was deified as a God of Poetry. There is a temple erected in his
honour at Ichi-no-Moto, and another at Akashi, not far from Kobe; he
died in the year 737.

In the fourth line *nagashi* may be taken as the adjective 'long', or
the verb 'to drift along'; and *yo* may mean either 'night' or 'life';
so that this line, which I have taken as 'long, long is the night', may
also mean 'my life is drifting, drifting along'. *Yamadori* (pheasant)
is literally 'mountain bird', and *ashibiki* is a pillow-word for
mountain, which is itself the first half of the word for pheasant.
