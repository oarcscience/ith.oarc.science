<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Tare wo ka mo  
Shiru hito nisemu  
  Takasago no  
Matsu mo mukashi no  
Tomo nara-naku ni.

GONE are my old familiar friends,  
  The men I used to know;  
Yet still on Takasago beach  
  The same old pine trees-grow,  
  That I knew long ago.

<span class="small">Oki-kaze, the son of Michinari, was an official in
the Province of Sagami in the year 911; the date of his death is
unknown, but he is mentioned as being alive as late as the year 914.
Takasago, which is mentioned again in verse No.
[73](hvj074.htm#page_73.md), is a seaside place in the Province of Harima,
famous for its pine trees; the pine tree is one of the recognized
emblems of long life in Japan, because it is believed that after a
thousand years its sap turns to amber.</span>
