# Of the Ordeal of the Art Magical

\(1953\)

Learn of the spirit that goeth with burdens that have not honour, for
'tis the spirit that stoopeth the shoulders and not the weight. Armour
is heavy, yet it is a proud burden and a man standeth upright in it.
Limiting and constraining any of the senses serves to increase the
concentration of another. Shutting the eyes aids the hearing. So the
binding of the initiate's hands increases the mental perception, while
the scourge increaseth the inner vision. So the initiate goeth through
it proudly, like a princess, knowing it but serves to increase her
glory. But this can only be done by the aid of another intelligence and
in a circle, to prevent the power thus generated being lost. Priests
attempt to do the same with their scourgings and mortifications of the
flesh. But lacking the aid of bonds and their attention being distracted
by their scourging themselves and what little power they do produce
being dissipated, as they do not usually work within a circle, it is
little wonder that they oft fail. Monks and hermits do better, as they
are apt to work in tiny cells and coves, which in some way act as
circles. The Knights of the Temple, who used mutually to scourge each
other in an octagon, did better still; but they apparently did not know
the virtue of bonds and did evil, man to man. But perhaps some did know?
What of the Church's charge that they wore girdles or cords?
