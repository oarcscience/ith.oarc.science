# The Sabbat Rituals

### November Eve

\(1949\)

Walk or slow dance, Magus leading High Priestess, both carrying Phallic
wand or broom, people with torches or candles.

Witch chant or song: "Eko, eko, Azarak Eko, eko, Zomelak Bazabi lacha
bachabe Lamac cahi achababe Karrellyos Lamac lamac Bachalyas cabahagy
sabalyos Baryolos Lagoz atha cabyolas Samahac atha famolas Hurrahya!"

Form circle.

High Priestess assumes Goddess position.

Magus gives her Fivefold Kiss and is scourged.

All are purified \[that is, bound and scourged with forty strokes, as in
the initiation rituals\].

Magus assumes God position.

High Priestess invokes with Athame: "Dread Lord of the shadows, god of
life and the giver of life. Yet is the knowledge of thee the knowledge
of death. Open wide, I pray thee, thy gates through which all must pass.
Let our dear ones who have gone before, return this night to make merry
with us. And when our time comes, as it must, O thou the comforter, the
consoler, the giver of peace and rest, we will enter thy realms gladly
and unafraid, for we know that when rested and refreshed among our dear
ones, we shall be born again by thy grace and the grace of the Great
Mother. Let it be in the same place and the same time as our beloved
ones, and may we meet and know, and love them again. Descend, we pray
thee, upon thy servant and Priest (name)."

High Priestess gives Fivefold Kiss to Magus.

Initiations if any; all others are purified.

(Note: Couples may purify each other if they will.)

Cakes and Wine.

The Great Rite if possible, either in token or truly.

Dismiss \[the guardians, and close down the magic circle; the people
then stay to\] feast and dance.
