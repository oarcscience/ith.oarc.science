# The Working Tools

\(1953\)

There are no magical supply shops, so unless you are lucky enough to be
given or sold tools, a poor witch must extemporize. But when made you
should be able to borrow or obtain an Athame. So having made your
circle, erect an altar. Any small table or chest will do. There must be
fire on it (a candle will suffice) and your book. For good results
incense is best if you can get it, but coals in a chafing dish burning
sweet-smelling herbs will do. A cup if you would have cakes and wine,
and a platter with the signs drawn into the same in ink, showing a
pentacle. A scourge is easily made (note, the scourge has eight tails
and five knots in each tail). Get a white-hilted knife and a wand (a
sword is not necessary). Cut the marks with Athame. Purify everything,
then consecrate your tools in proper form and ever be properly prepared.
But ever remember, magical operations are useless unless the mind can be
brought to the proper attitude, keyed to the utmost pitch. Affirmations
must be made clearly, and the mind should be inflamed with desire. With
this frenzy of will, you may do as much with simple tools as with the
most complete set. But good and especially ancient tools have their own
aura. They do help to bring about that reverential spirit, the desire to
learn and develop your powers. For this reason witches ever try to
obtain tools from sorcerers, who, being skilled men, make good tools and
consecrate them well, giving them mighty power. But a great witch's
tools also gain much power; and you should ever strive to make any tools
you manufacture of the finest materials you can obtain, to the end that
they may absorb your power the more easily. And of course if you may
inherit or obtain another witch's tools, power will flow from them. It
is an old belief that the best substances for making tools are those
that have once had life in them, as opposed to artificial substances.
Thus wood or ivory is better for a wand than metal, which is more
appropriate for knives or swords. Virgin parchment is better than
manufactured paper for talismans, etc. And things which have been made
by hand are good, because there is life in them.
