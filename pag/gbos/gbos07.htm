<p>Magus assumes God position.</p> 
<p>High Priestess invokes with Athame: "Dread Lord of the shadows, god of life and the giver of life. Yet is the knowledge of thee the knowledge of death. Open wide, I pray thee, thy gates through which all must pass. Let our dear ones who have gone before, return this night to make merry with us. And when our time comes, as it must, O thou the comforter, the consoler, the giver of peace and rest, we will enter thy realms gladly and unafraid, for we know that when rested and refreshed among our dear ones, we shall be born again by thy grace and the grace of the Great Mother. Let it be in the same place and the same time as our beloved ones, and may we meet and know, and love them again. Descend, we pray thee, upon thy servant and Priest (name)."</p> 
<p>High Priestess gives Fivefold Kiss to Magus.</p> 
<p>Initiations if any; all others are purified.</p> 
<p>(Note: Couples may purify each other if they will.)</p> 
<p>Cakes and Wine.</p> 
<p>The Great Rite if possible, either in token or truly.</p> 
<p>Dismiss [the guardians, and close down the magic circle; the people then stay to] feast and dance.</p>
