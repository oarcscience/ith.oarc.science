------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the text of the Gardnerian Book of Shadows. In one sense, this
is the central sacred text of the Wicca religion. However, it is
important to point out that there is no 'official' Book of Shadows.
Typically each coven has a hand-written copy of *a* Book of Shadows,
sometimes in cypher or code, which reflects its own practices and
knowledge. This particular text is derived from a file posted on the
Internet in the early 90s, and quotes previously published material
which was known to be in use by Gardner and his group.

The Book of Shadows was attributed by Gardner to an ancient, clandestine
witch cult, which he claimed to have been initiated into. However,
modern researchers have concluded that it was composed by Gardner. The
text shows influences from English and Celtic Folk-lore, the Enochian
system of John Dee, Thelema, the Golden Dawn, Stregaria, Tantric Yoga,
the KJV Bible and even Kipling. This version organizes the material in
chronological order and has estimated dates for each section, ranging
from 1949 to 1961.

The copyright status of this text can best be described as 'orphaned.'
This version was compiled by Aidan A. Kelly. It was originally posted on
the Internet in the mid-90s as part of the [Internet Book of
Shadows](../../bos/index.md) material. Text in square brackets is Kelly's
commentary.
