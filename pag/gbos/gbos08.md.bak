### February Eve

After usual opening, all are doubly purified \[that is, with eighty
strokes\].

Dance round outside circle, High Priestess with sword girded on and
drawn, Phallic wand in left hand.

Enter circle.

Magus assumes God position.

High Priestess gives Fivefold Kiss, invokes: "Dread Lord of death and
Resurrection, life and the giver of life, Lord within ourselves, whose
name is Mystery of Mysteries, encourage our hearts. Let the light
crystalize in our blood, fulfilling us of resurrection, for there is no
part of us that is not of the gods. Descend, we pray thee, upon this thy
servant and Priest (name)."

All should be purified in sacrifice before him. He then purifies the
High Priestess with his own hands, and others if he will.

Cakes and wine.

Great Rite if possible, in token or real.

Games and dance as the people will.

Dismiss \[the guardians, and close down the magic circle; the people
then stay to\] feast and dance.
