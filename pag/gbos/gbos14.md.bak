# The Priestess and the Sword

\(1953\)

It is said, "When a woman takes the main part in worship of the Male
God, she must be girt with a sword." Note. This hath been explained as
meaning that a man should be Magus representing the God, but if no one
of sufficient rank and knowledge be present, a woman armed as a man may
take his place. The sheath should be worn in a belt. She should carry
the sword in hand, but if she has to use her hands, she should sheath
the sword. Any other woman in the circle while this worship is performed
shall be sword in hand. Those outside the circle only have the athame. A
woman may impersonate either the God or the Goddess, but a man may only
impersonate the God.
