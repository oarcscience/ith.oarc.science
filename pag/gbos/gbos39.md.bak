# The Verse Charge

\(1961\)

I the Mother, darksome and divine, Say to thee, Oh children mine (All ye
assembled at mine Shrine), Mine the scourge and mine the kiss The
five-point star of love and bliss Here I charge ye in this sign. (Assume
Goddess position.)

All ye assembled here tonight Bow before my spirit bright Aphrodite,
Arianrhod, Lover of the Horned God, Mighty Queen of Witchery and night

Astarte, Hecate, Ashtaroth, Dione, (Morrigan, Etain, Nisene), Diana,
Brigid, Melusine, Am I named of old by men, Artemis and Cerridwen,
Hell's dark mistress, Heaven's Queen.

(Whene'er trouble comes anoon) All who would learn of me a Rune Or would
ask of me a boon, Meet ye in some secret glade Dance my round in
greenwood shade, by the light of the full moon.

(In a place wild and lone) With the comrades alone Dance about my altar
stone. Work my holy Magistry,Ye who are fain of sorcery, I bring ye
secrets yet unknown.

(Whate'er troubles come to thee), No more shall ye know slavery Who give
due worship unto me, Who tread my round on Sabbat-night. Come ye all
naked to the rite, In token ye be truly free.

I teach the mystery of rebirth, Keep ye my mysteries in mirth Heart
joined to heart, and lip to lip, Five are the points of fellowship That
bring ye ecstasy on Earth.

I ask no offerings, do but bow, No other law but love I know, By naught
but love I may be known, All that liveth is mine own From me they come,
to me they go.
