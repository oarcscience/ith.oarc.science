### May Eve

If possible ride poles, brooms, etc. High Priestess leading, quick dance
step, singing

"O do not tell the priests of our arts. For they would call it sin, For
we will be in the woods all night Aconjuring conjuring summer in.

And we bring you good news by word of mouth. For women, cattle, and
corn: The sun is coming up from the south,With oak and ash, and thorn."

Meeting dance if possible.

Form circle as usual, and purify.

High Priestess assumes Goddess position; officers all give her the
fivefold kiss.

She purifies all.

High Priestess again assumes Goddess position.

Magus invokes, draws down moon, "I invoke thee and call upon thee, O
mighty Mother of us all, bringer of all fruitfulness, By seed and root,
by stem and bud, by leaf and flower and fruit, by life and love, do we
invoke thee, to descend upon the body of thy servant and Priestess
here."

Magus gives Fivefold Kiss to High Priestess.

All should be purified in sacrifice before her, and she should purify
Magus and some others with her own hands.

Cakes and wine.

Games.

Great Rite if possible, in token or truly.

Dismiss \[the guardians, and close down the magic circle; the people
then stay to\] feast and dance.
