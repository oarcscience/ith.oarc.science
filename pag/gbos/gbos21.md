# The Meeting Dance.

\(1953\)

The Maiden should lead. A man should place both hands on her waist,
standing behind her, and alternate men and women should do the same, the
Maiden leading and they dance following her. She at last leads them into
a right-hand spiral. When the center is reached (and this had better be
marked by a stone), she suddenly turns and dances back, kissing each man
as she comes to him. All men and women turn likewise and dance back, men
kissing girls and girls kissing men. All in time to music, it is a merry
game, but must be practiced to be done well. Note, the musicians should
watch the dancers and make the music fast or slow as is best. For the
beginners it should be slow, or there will be confusion. It is most
excellent to get people to know each other at big gatherings.
