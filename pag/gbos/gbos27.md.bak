# CAKES AND WINE

\(1957\)

High Priestess seated on Altar, God position.

Magus, kneeling, kisses her feet, then knees, bows with head below her
knees, extends arms along her thighs, and adores.

Magus fills cup and offers it to High Priestess, who, holding Athame
between palms, places point in cup.

Magus says: "As the Athame is the male, so the cup is the female, and
conjoined they bring blessedness."

High Priestess lays Athame aside, and takes Cup and drinks, gives Cup to
server, who puts a little in each glass.

Magus presents Pentacle with cakes to High Priestess, saying, "Oh Queen
most secret, bless this food unto our bodies, bestowing health, wealth,
strength, joy and peace, and that fulfillment of love that is perpetual
happiness".

High Priestess blesses them with Athame, takes Cake and eats, while the
Magus gives her the Cup again and kisses knees and adores.

All sit as Witches, and invite High Priestess to join them.
