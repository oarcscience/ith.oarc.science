# Properly Prepared.

\(1953\)

Naked, but sandals (not shoes) may be worn. For initiation, tie hands
behind back, pull up to small of back, and tie ends in front of throat,
leaving a cable-tow to lead by, hanging down in front. (Arms thus form a
triangle at back.) When initiate is kneeling at altar, the cable-tow is
tied to a ring in the altar. A short cord is tied like a garter round
the initiate's left leg above the knee, with ends tucked in. Another is
tied round right ankle and ends tucked in so as to be out of the way
while mov ing about. These cords are used to tie feet together while
initiate is kneeling at the altar and must be long enough to do this
firmly. Knees must also be firmly tied. This must be carefully done. If
the aspirant complains of pain, the bonds must be loosened slightly;
always remember the object is to retard the blood flow enough to induce
a trance state. This involves slight discomfort, but great discomfort
prevents the trance state; so it is best to spend some little time
loosening a nd tightening the bonds until they are just right. The
aspirant alone can tell you when this is so. This, of course, does not
apply to the initiation, as then no trance is desired; but for the
purpose of ritual it is good that the initiates be bound firmly enough
to feel they are absolutely helpless but without discomfort.
