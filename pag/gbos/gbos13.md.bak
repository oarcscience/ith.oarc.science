# The Scourge and the Kiss.

\(1953\)

\[1\] Invocation

(Feet, knees, and wrists should be tightly bound to retard blood.)
Scourge 40 or more, to make skin tingle, then say, invoking Goddess,

Hail, Aradia, from the Amalthean horn Pour forth thy store of Love. I
lowly bend Before Thee! I invoke thee at the end When other Gods are
fallen and put to scorn. Thy foot is to my lips! My sighs inborn Rise,
touch, curl about thy heart. Then spend, Pitiful Love, loveliest Pity,
descend And bring me luck who am lonely and forlorn.

Ask the Goddess to help you to obtain your desires, then Scourge again
to bind the spell. This be powerful in ill luck and for sickness. It
must be said in a Circle, and you must be properly prepared and well
purified, both before and after saying, to bind the spell. Before
starting you must make a very clear picture in your mind of what you
wish. Make yourself see the wish obtained. Be sure in your own mind
exactly what it is and how it is to be fulfilled. This spell is the one
that was taught to me long ago and I have found it works, but I don't
think there is any special virtue in these words. Any others can be

substituted provided they ask the goddess's (or gods') help, and say
clearly what you wish and you form the clear mental image; and if it
doesn't work at first, keep on trying till it works. Your helper, who
wields the scourge, must know what you wish, and also form the mental
image. And at first at any rate, it will be better for you to work the
spell, then for the girl to take your place and work it also; you
scourge her. Don't try anything difficult at first, and do it at least
once a week till it works. You have to get into sympathy with each
other, before anything happens, and regular working helps this. Of
spells, the exact words matter little if the intent be clear and you
raise the true power, and sufficient thereof. Always in rhyme they are.
There is something queer about rhyme. I have tried, and the same seem to
lose their power if you miss the rhyme. Also in rhyme, the words seem to
say themselves. You do not have to pause and think: "What comes next?"
Doing this takes away much of your intent.

\[2\] Order and discipline must be kept. A High Priest or Priestess may
and should punish all faults to this end, and all of the Cult must
accept such corrections willingly. All are brothers and sisters, for
this reason: that even the High Priestess must submit to the scourge.
Each fault should be corrected separately. The Priest or Priestess must
be properly prepared and call the culprit to trial. They must be
prepared as for initiation and kneel, be told their fault and sentence
pronounced. Punishment should be the scourge, followed by a forfeit such
as several fivefold kisses or something of this nature. The culprit must
acknowledge the justice of the punishment by kissing hands and scourge
on receiving sentence and again when thanking for punishment
received. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

\[3\] The scourgings are 3, 7, 9 (thrice three), and 21 (thrice seven)
40 in all. It is not meet to make offerings \[scourgings\] of less than
two score to the Goddess, for here be a mystery. The fortunate numbers
be: 3 and 5. For three added to two (the Perfect Couple) be five. And
three and five be eight; eight and five be thirteen; thirteen and eight
be twenty-one. The Fivefold Kiss is called 5, but there are 8 kisses,
for there be 2 feet and 2 knees and genitals and 2 breasts and the lips.
And 5 times 8 be two score. Also, fortunate numbers be 3, 7, 8, and 21,
which total 40, or two score. For each man and woman hath ten fingers
and ten toes, so each totals a score. And a perfect couple be two score.
So a lesser number would not be perfect prayer. If more are required
make it a perfect number, as four score or six score. Also there be
Eight Elemental Weapons.

\[4\] To make the anointing ointment, take some glazed pans filled half
full with grease or olive oil. Put in one sweet mint, marjoram in
another, ground thyme in a 3rd, and it you may have it, patchouli, dried
leaves pounded. Place pans in hot water bath. Stir and cook for several
hours, then pout into linen bags, and squeeze grease through into pans
again, and fill up with fresh leaves. After doing this several times,
the grease will be highly perfumed. Then mix all together and store in a
well-corked jar. Anoint behind ears, throat, armpits, breasts, and womb.
Also, for all ceremonies where the feet are kissed, they should also be
anointed.
