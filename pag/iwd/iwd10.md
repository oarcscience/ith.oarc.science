### A.D. 1807 TO PRESENT DAY

MARY BUTTERS, THE CARNMONEY WITCH--BALLAD ON HER--THE HAND OF GLORY--A
JOURNEY THROUGH THE AIR--A "WITCH" IN 1911--SOME MODERN ILLUSTRATIONS OF
CATTLE- AND MILK-MAGIC--TRANSFERENCE OF DISEASE BY A
*cailleach*--BURYING THE. SHEAF--J.P.'S COMMISSION--CONCLUSION

OLD beliefs die hard, especially when their speedy demise is a
consummation devoutly to be wished; if the Island-Magee case was the
last instance of judicial condemnation of witchcraft as an offence
against the laws of the realm it was very far indeed from being the last
occasion on which a witch and her doings formed the centre of attraction
in an Irish law-court. Almost a century after the Island-Magee incident
the town of Carrigfergus again became the scene of action, when the
celebrated "Carnmoney witch," Mary Butters, was put forward for trial at
the Spring Assizes in March 1808. It is an instance of black

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

magic versus white (if we may dignify the affair with the title of
*magic*!), though it should be borne in mind that in the persecution of
witches many women were put to death on the latter charge, albeit they
were really benefactors of the human race; the more so as their skill in
simples and knowledge of the medicinal virtue of herbs must have added
in no small degree to, the resources of our present pharmacopœia. The
following account of this is taken from the *Belfast News-Letter* for
21st August 1807, as well as from some notes by M'Skimin in Young's
*Historical Notice of Old Belfast*.

One Tuesday night (evidently in August 1807) an extraordinary affair
took place in the house of a tailor named Alexander Montgomery, who
lived hard by Carnmoney Meeting-House. The tailor had a cow which
continued to give milk as usual, but of late no butter could be produced
from it. An opinion was unfortunately instilled into the mind of
Montgomery's wife, that whenever such a thing occurred, it was
occasioned by the cow having been bewitched. Her belief in this was

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

strengthened by the fact that every old woman in the parish was able to
relate some story illustrative of what she had seen or heard of in times
gone by with respect to the same. At length the family were informed of
a woman named Mary Butters, who resided at Carrigfergus. They went to
her, and brought her to the house for the purpose of curing the cow.
About ten o'clock that night war was declared against the unknown
magicians. Mary Butters ordered old Montgomery and a young man named
Carnaghan to go out to the cow-house, turn their waistcoats inside out,
and in that dress to stand by the head of the cow until she sent for
them, while the wife, the son, and an old woman named Margaret Lee
remained in the house with her.

Montgomery and his ally kept their lonely vigil until daybreak, when,
becoming alarmed at receiving no summons, they left their post and
knocked at the door, but obtained no response. They then looked through
the kitchen window, and to their horror saw the four inmates stretched
on the floor as dead. They immediately burst

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

in the door, and found that the wife and son were actually dead, and the
sorceress and Margaret Lee nearly so. The latter soon afterwards
expired; Mary Butters was thrown out on a dung-heap, and a restorative
administered to her in the shape of a few hearty kicks, which had the
desired effect. The house had a sulphureous smell, and on the fire was a
large pot in which were milk, needles, pins, and crooked nails. At the
inquest held at Carnmoney on the 19th of August, the jurors stated that
the three victims had come by their deaths from suffocation, owing to
Mary Butters having made use of some noxious ingredients, after the
manner of a charm, to recover a sick cow. She was brought up at the
Assizes, but was discharged by proclamation. Her version of the story
was, that a black man had appeared in the house armed with a huge club,
with which he killed the three persons and stunned herself.

Lamentable though the whole affair was, as well for the gross
superstition displayed by the participants as for its tragical ending,
yet it seems to have aroused no other feelings amongst the inhabitants
of Carnmoney

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

and Carrigfergus than those of risibility and derision. A clever racy
ballad was made upon it by a resident in the district, which, as it is
probably the only poem on the subject of witchcraft in Ireland, we print
here in its entirety from the *Ulster Journal of Archæology* for 1908,
though we have not had the courage to attempt a glossary to the "braid
Scots." It adds some picturesque details to the more prosaic account of
the *News-Letter*.

"In Carrick town a wife did dwell  
   Who does pretend to conjure witches.  
Auld Barbara Goats, or Lucky Bell,  
   Ye'll no lang to come through her clutches,  
A waeful trick this wife did play  
   On simple Sawney, our poor tailor.  
She's mittimiss'd the other day  
   To lie in limbo with the jailor.  
This simple Sawney had a cow,  
   Was aye as sleekit as an otter;  
It happened for a month or two  
   Aye when they churn'd they got nae butter,  
Rown-tree tied in the cow's tail,  
   And vervain glean'd about the ditches;  
These freets and charms did not prevail,  
   They could not banish the auld witches.  
The neighbour wives a' gathered in  
   In number near about a dozen;  
Elspie Dough, and Mary Linn,  
   An' Kate M'Cart, the tailor's cousin. <span id="page_229">p.
229</span>  
Aye they churn'd and aye they swat,  
   Their aprons loos'd, and coost their mutches  
But yet nae butter they could get,  
   They blessed the cow but curst the witches.  
Had Sawney summoned all his wits  
   And sent awa for Huie Mertin,  
He could have gall'd the witches' guts,  
   An' cur't the kye to Nannie Barton. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md)  
But he may shew the farmer's wab,  
   An' lang wade through Carnmoney gutters;  
Alas! it was a sore mis-jab  
   When he employ'd auld Mary Butters.  
The sorcerest open'd the scene  
   With magic words of her invention,  
To make the foolish people keen  
   Who did not know her base intention,  
She drew a circle round the churn,  
   And washed the staff in south-run water, <span
id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md)  
And swore the witches she would burn,  
   But she would have the tailor's butter.  
When sable Night her curtain spread  
   Then she got on a flaming fire;  
The tailor stood at the cow's head  
   With his turn'd waistcoats <span id="fr_57"></span>[3](#fn_57.md) in the
byre.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

The chimney covered with a scraw  
   An' every crevice where it smoak'd,  
But long before the cock did craw  
   The people in the house were choak'd.  
The muckle pot hung on all night,  
   As Mary Butters had been brewing  
In hopes to fetch some witch or wight,  
   Whas entrails by her art were stewing.  
In this her magic a' did fail;  
   Nae witch nor wizard was detected.  
Now Mary Butters lies in jail  
   For the base part that she has acted.  
The tailor lost his son and wife,  
   For Mary Butters did them smother;  
But as he hates a single life  
   In four weeks' time he got another.  
He is a crouse auld canty chiel,  
   An' cares nae what the witches mutter  
He'll never mair employ the Deil,  
   Nor his auld agent Mary Butters.  
At day the tailor left his post  
   Though he had seen no apparition,  
Nae wizard grim, nae witch, nor ghost,  
   Though still he had a stray suspicion  
That some auld wizard wrinkled wife  
   Had cast her cantrips o'er poor brawney  
Cause she and he did live in strife,  
   An' whar's the man can blame poor Sawney.  
Wae sucks for our young lasses now,  
   For who can read their mystic matters,  
Or tell if their sweethearts be true,  
   The folks a' run to Mary Butters.  
To tell what thief a horse did steal,  
   In this she was a mere pretender,  
An' has nae art to raise the Deil <span id="page_231">p. 231</span>  
   Like that auld wife, the Witch of Endor.  
If Mary Butters be a witch  
   Why but the people all should know it,  
An' if she can the muses touch  
   I'm sure she'll soon descry the poet.  
Her ain familiar aff she'll sen'  
   Or paughlet wi' a tu' commission  
To pour her vengeance on the man  
   That tantalizes her condition."

There also exists a shorter version of the ballad, which seems to be a
rather clumsy adaptation of what we have given above; in it the witch is
incorrectly termed *Butlers*. That the heroine did not evolve the
procedure she had adopted out of her own fervent imagination, but that
she followed a method generally recognised and practised in the
country-side is shown by a case that occurred at Newtownards in January
1871. <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) A farm-hand had brought an
action against his employer for wages alleged to be due to him. It
transpired in the course of the evidence that on one occasion he had
been set to banish witches that were troubling the cows. His method of
working illustrates the Carnmoney case. All left the house except the
plaintiff, who locked himself

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

in, closed the windows, stopped all keyholes and apertures, and put sods
on top of the chimneys. He then placed a large pot of sweet milk on the
fire, into which he threw three rows of pins that had never been used,
and three packages of needles; all were allowed to boil together for
half an hour, and, as there was no outlet for the smoke, the plaintiff
narrowly escaped being suffocated.

It is strange to find use made in Ireland of that potent magical
instrument, the Hand of Glory, and that too in the nineteenth century.
On the night of the 3rd of January 1831, some Irish thieves attempted to
commit a robbery on the estate of Mr. Naper, of Loughcrew, co. Meath.
They entered the house, armed with a dead man's hand with a lighted
candle in it, believing in the superstitious notion that if such a hand
be procured, and a candle placed within its grasp, the latter cannot be
seen by anyone except him by whom it is used; also that if the candle
and hand be introduced into a house it will prevent those who may be
asleep from awaking. The inhabitants, however, were alarmed, and

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

the robbers fled, leaving the hand behind them. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md) No doubt the absolute failure of this
gruesome dark lantern on this occasion was due to the fact that neither
candle nor candlestick had been properly prepared! The orthodox recipe
for its preparation and consequent effectual working may be found in
full in Mr. Baring Gould's essay on Schamir in his *Curious Myths of the
Middle Ages*.

The following tale comes from an article in the *Dublin University
Magazine*, vol. lxiv.; it has rather a Cross-Channel appearance, but may
have been picked up locally in Ireland. A man named Shamus Rua (Red
James) was awakened one night by a noise in the kitchen. He stole down,
and found his old housekeeper, Madge, with half a dozen of her kidney,
sitting by the fire drinking his whisky. When the bottle was finished
one of them cried, "It's time to be off," and at the same moment she put
on a peculiar red cap, and added

"By yarrow and rue,  
And my red cap, too,  
Hie over to England!"

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

And seizing a twig she soared up the chimney, whither she was followed
by all save Madge. As the latter was making her preparations Shamus
rushed into the kitchen, snatched the cap from her, and placing himself
astride of her twig uttered the magic formula. He speedily found himself
high in the air over the Irish Sea, and swooping through the empyrean at
a rate unequalled by the fastest aeroplane. They rapidly neared the
Welsh coast, and espied a castle afar off, towards the door of which
they rushed with frightful velocity; Shamus closed his eyes and awaited
the shock, but found to his delight that he had slipped through the
keyhole without hurt. The party made their way to the cellar, where they
caroused heartily, but the wine proved too heady, and somehow Shamus was
captured and dragged before the lord of the castle, who sentenced him to
be hanged. On his way to the gallows an old woman in the crowd called
out in Irish "Ah, Shamus *alanna*! Is it going to die you are in a
strange place without your little red cap?" He craved, and obtained,
permission to put it on. On reaching the

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

place of execution he was allowed to address the spectators, and did so
in the usual ready-made speech, beginning,

"Good people all, a warning take by me."

But when he reached the last line,

"My parents reared me tenderly"

instead of stopping be unexpectedly added,

"By yarrow and rue," &c.,

with the result that he shot up through the air, to the great dismay of
all beholders.

Our readers will at once recall Grandpapa's Tale of the Witches' Frolic
in the *Ingoldsby Legends*. Similar tales appear in Scotland, for which
see Sharpe, pp. 56, 207; the same writer (p. 2 12) makes mention of a
red cap being worn by a witch.

After the opening years of the eighteenth century, when once it had
ceased to attract the unwelcome attentions of judge, jury, and
executioner, witchcraft degenerated rapidly. It is said by some writers
that a belief in the old-fashioned witch of history may still be found
in the remoter parts of rural England; the same can hardly be said of

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

Ireland, this being due to the fact that witchcraft was never, at its
best (or worst) period, very prevalent in this country. But its place is
taken by an ineradicable belief in *pishogues*, or in the semi-magical
powers of the bone-setter, or the stopping of bleeding wounds by an
incantation, or the healing of diseases in human beings or animals by
processes unknown to the medical profession, or in many other quaint
tenets which lie on the borderland between folklore and witchcraft, and
at best only represent the complete degeneracy and decay of the latter.
Yet these practices sometimes come, for one reason or another, within
the wide reach of the arm of the law, though it is perhaps unnecessary
to state that they are not treated as infringements of the Elizabethan
Statute. For example, some years ago a case was tried at New Pallas in
co. Limerick, where a woman believed that another desired to steal her
butter by *pishogues*, flew in a passion, assaulted her and threw her
down, breaking her arm in the fall. <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md)
That appalling tragedy, the "witch-burning"

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

case that occurred near Clonmel in 1895, is altogether misnamed. The
woman was burnt, not because she was a witch, but in the belief that the
real wife had been taken away and a fairy changeling substituted in her
place; when the latter was subjected to the fire it would disappear, and
the wife would be restored. Thus the underlying motive was kindness, but
oh, how terribly mistaken! Lefanu in his *Seventy Years of Irish Life*
relates a similar incident, but one which fortunately ended humorously
rather than tragically: while Crofton Croker mentions instances of wives
being taken by the fairies, and restored to their husbands after the
lapse of years.

Even as late as the summer of 1911 the word "witch" was heard in an
Irish law-court, when an unhappy poor woman was tried for killing
another, an old-age pensioner, in a fit of insanity. <span
id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) One of the witnesses deposed that he met
the accused on the road on the morning of the murder. She had a statue
in her hand, and repeated three times: "I have the old witch killed I
got power from

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

the Blessed Virgin to kill her. She came to me at 3 o'clock yesterday,
and told me to kill her, or I would be plagued with rats and mice." She
made much the same statement to another witness, and added: "We will be
all happy now. I have the devils hunted away. They went across the hill
at 3 o'clock yesterday." The evidence having concluded, the accused made
a statement which was reduced to writing: "On the day of the thunder and
lightning and big rain there did a rat come into my house, and since
then I was annoyed and upset in my mind. . . A lady came to me when I
was lying in bed at night, she was dressed in white, with a wreath on
her head, and said that I was in danger. I thought that she was
referring to the rat coming into the house. . . . The lady who appeared
to me said, If you receive this old woman's pension-book without taking
off her clothes and cleaning them, and putting out her bed and cleaning
up the house, you will receive dirt for ever, and rats and mice."

Imagine the above occurring in 1611 instead of 1911! The ravings of the
poor

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

demented creature would be accepted as gospel-truth; the rat would be
the familiar sent by the witch to torment her, the witnesses would have
many more facts to add to their evidence, the credulous people would
rejoice that the country-side had been freed from such a malignant witch
(though they might regret that she had been given her *congé* so
easily), while the annals of Irish witchcraft would be the richer by
nearly as extraordinary a case as that of Florence Newton, and one which
would have lost nothing in the telling or the printing. Shorn of their
pomp and circumstance, no doubt many witch-stories would be found to be
very similar in origin to the above.

As is only to be expected in a country where the majority of the
inhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits, most of the tales of
strange doings are in connection with cattle. At Dungannon Quarter
Sessions in June 1890, before Sir Francis Brady, one farmer sued another
for breach of warranty in a cow. <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md) It
was suggested

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

that the animal was "blinked," or in other words was under the influence
of the "evil eye," or had a *pishogue* put upon it. The defendant had
agreed to send for the curative charm to a wise woman in the mountains.
The *modus operandi* was then proceeded with. Three locks of hair were
pulled from the cow's forehead, three from her back, three from her
tail, and one from under her nostrils. The directions continued as
follows: The operators were to write the names of eight persons in the
neighbourhood whom they might suspect of having done the harm (each name
three times), and the one of these eight who was considered to be the
most likely to have "blinked" the cow was to be pointed out. When this
had been done there was to be a bundle of thatch pulled from the roof of
the suspected person. The owner of the cow was then to cut a sod, and
take a coal out of the fire on a shovel on which to burn the hair, the
thatch, and the paper on which the names had been written. The sod was
then to be put to the cow's mouth, and if she licked it she would live.

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

His Honour to defendant: "And did she lick it?"

Defendant: "Ave, lick it; she would have ate it." (Roars of laughter.)
It then transpired that the burning of the thatch had been omitted, and
this necessitated another journey to the wise woman.

We may also expect to find traces of strange doings with respect to the
produce of cows, viz. milk and butter. Various tales are related to the
following effect. A herdsman having wounded a hare, which he has
discovered sucking one of the cows under his charge, tracks it to a
solitary cabin, where he finds an old woman, smeared with blood and
gasping for breath, extended almost lifeless on the floor. Similar
stories are to be found in England, and helped to make up the
witch-element there, though it may be noted that as early as the twelfth
century we are informed by Giraldus Cambrensis that certain old hags in
Ireland had the power of turning themselves into hares and in that shape
sucking cows. The preservation of hares for coursing, which is being
taken up in parts of this country, will probably deal the death-blow to
this

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

particular superstition. With regard to the stealing of butter many
tales are told, of which the following may be taken as an illustration.
A priest was walking in his field early one summer's morning when he
came upon an old woman gathering the dew from the long grass, and
saying, "Come all to me!" The priest absent-mindedly muttered, "And half
to me!" Next morning he discovered in his dairy three times as much
butter as he ought to have, while his neighbours complained that they
had none at all. On searching the old beldame's house three large tubs
of freshly-churned butter were discovered, which, as her entire flocks
and herds consisted of a solitary he-goat, left little doubt of her
evildoing! <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md)

The witch of history is now a thing of the past. No longer does she
career on a broomstick to the nocturnal Sabbath, no longer does she sell
her soul to the Devil and receive from him in return many signal tokens
of his favour, amongst which was generally the gift of a familiar spirit
to do her behests. No longer does the judge

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

sentence, no longer does the savage rabble howl execrations at the old
witch come to her doom. The witch of history is gone, and can never be
rehabilitated--would, that superstition had died with her. For in
Ireland, as probably in every part of the civilised world, many things
are believed in and practised which seem repugnant to religion and
common-sense. Scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land
there are to be found persons whom the country-folk credit with the
power of performing various extraordinary actions. *From what source*
they derive this power is not at all clear--probably neither they
themselves nor their devotees have ever set themselves the task of
unravelling that psychological problem. Such persons would be extremely
insulted if they were termed wizards or witches, and indeed they only
represent white witchcraft in a degenerate and colourless stage. Their
entire time is not occupied with such work, nor, in the majority of
cases, do they take payment for their services; they are ready to
practise their art when occasion arises, but apart from such moments
they pursue

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

the ordinary avocations of rural life. The gift has come to them either
as an accident of birth, or else the especial recipe or charm has
descended from father to son, or has been bequeathed to them by the
former owner; as a rule such is used for the benefit of their friends.

An acquaintance told the writer some marvellous tales of a man who had
the power of stopping bleeding, though the ailing person might be many
miles off at the time; he promised to leave the full *modus operandi* to
the writer's informant, but the latter was unable to go and see him
during his last moments, and so lost the charm, and. as well deprived
the writer of the pleasure of satisfying himself as to the efficacy of
its working--for in the interests of Science he was fully prepared to
cut his finger (slightly) and let the blood flow!

The same informant told the writer of a most respectable woman who had
the power of healing sores. Her method is as follows. She thrusts two
sally-twigs in the fire until they become red-hot. She then takes one,
and makes circles, round the sore (without touching the

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

flesh), all the while repeating a charm, of which the informant, who
underwent the process, could not catch the words. When the twig becomes
cool, she thrusts it back into the fire, takes out the other, and does
as above. The whole process is repeated about ten or twelve times, but
not more than two twigs are made use of. She also puts her patients on a
certain diet, and this, together with the general air of mystery, no
doubt helps to produce the desired results.

Instances also occur in Ireland of persons employing unhallowed means
for the purpose of bringing sickness and even death on some one who has
fallen foul of them, or else they act on behalf of those whose
willingness is circumscribed by their powerlessness. From the Aran
Islands a story comes of the power of an old woman to transfer disease
from the afflicted individual to another, with the result that the first
recovered, while the newly-stricken person died; the passage reads more
like the doings of savages in Polynesia or Central Africa than of
Christians in Ireland. In 1892 a man stated that a friend of his

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

was sick of an incurable disease, and having been given over by the
doctor, sought, after a struggle with his conscience, the services of a
*cailleach* who had the power to transfer mortal sickness from the
patient to some healthy object who would sicken and die as an
unconscious substitute. When fully empowered by her patient, whose
honest intention to profit by the unholy remedy was indispensable to its
successful working, the *cailleach* would go out into some field close
by a public road, and setting herself on her knees she would pluck an
herb from the ground, looking out on the road as she did so. The first
passer-by her baleful glance lighted upon would take the sick man's
disease and die of it in twenty-four hours, the patient mending as the
victim sickened and died. <span id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md)

A most extraordinary account of the Black Art, as instanced in the
custom known as "burying the sheaf" comes from co. Louth. The narrator
states that details are difficult to obtain, at which we are not
surprised, but from what

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

he has published the custom appears to be not only exceedingly
malignant, but horribly blasphemous. The person working the charm first
goes to the chapel, and says certain words with his (or her) back to the
altar; then he takes a sheaf of wheat, which he fashions like the human
body, sticking pins in the joints of the stems, and (according to one
account) shaping a heart of plaited straw. This sheaf he buries, in the
name of the Devil, near the house of his enemy, who he believes will
gradually pine away as the sheaf decays, dying when it finally
decomposes. If the operator of the charm wishes his enemy to die quickly
he buries the sheaf in wet ground where it will soon decay; but if on
the other hand he desires his victim to linger in pain he chooses a dry
spot where decomposition will be slow. Our informant states that a case
in which one woman tried to kill another by this means was brought to
light in the police court at Ardee a couple of years before he wrote the
above account (*i.e.* before 1895). <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md)

Though the Statutes against witchcraft

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

in England and Scotland were repealed (the latter very much against the
will of the clergy), it is said that that passed by the Irish Parliament
was not similarly treated, and consequently is, theoretically, still in
force. Be that as it may, it will probably be news to our readers to
learn that witchcraft is still officially recognised in Ireland as an
offence against the law. In the Commission of the Peace the
newly-appointed magistrate is empowered to take cognisance of, amongst
other crimes, "Witchcraft, Inchantment, Sorcery, Magic Arts," a curious
relic of bygone times to find in the twentieth century, though it is
more than unlikely that any Bench in Ireland will ever have to
adjudicate in such a case.

In the foregoing pages we have endeavoured to trace the progress of
witchcraft in Ireland from its first appearance to the present day, and
as well have introduced some subjects which bear indirectly on the
question. From the all too few examples to be obtained we have noted its
gradual rise to the zenith (which is represented by the period
1661-1690), and from thence its downward progress to the

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

strange beliefs of the day, which in some respects are the degenerate
descendants of the witch craft-conception, in others represent ideas
older than civilisation. We may pay the tribute of a tearful smile to
the ashes of witchcraft, and express our opinion of the present-day
beliefs of the simple country-folk by a pitying smile, feeling an the
time how much more enlightened we are than those who believed, or still
believe, in such absurdities! But the mind of man is built in
water-tight compartments. What better embodies the spirit of the young
twentieth century than a powerful motor car, fully equipped with the
most up-to-date appliances for increasing speed or lessening vibration;
in its tuneful hum as it travels at forty-five miles an hour without an
effort, we hear the triumph-song of mind over matter. The owner
certainly does not believe in witchcraft or *pishogues* (or perhaps in
anything save himself!), yet he fastens on the radiator a "Teddy Bear"
or some such thing by way of a mascot. Ask him why he does it--he cannot
tell, except that others do the same, while all the time at the back of
his mind there

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

exists almost unconsciously the belief that such a thing will help to
keep him from the troubles and annoyances that beset the path of the
motorist. The connection between cause and effect is unknown to him; he
cannot tell you why a Teddy Bear will keep the engine from overheating
or prevent punctures--and in this respect he is for the moment on
exactly the same intellectual level as., let us say, his brother-man of
New Zealand, who carries a baked yam with him at night to scare away
ghosts.

The truth of the matter is that we all have a vein of superstition in
us, which makes its appearance at some period in our lives under one
form or another. A. will laugh to scorn B.'s belief in witches or
ghosts, while he himself would not undertake a piece of business on a
Friday for all the wealth of Crœsus; while C., who laughs at both, will
offer his hand to the palmist in full assurance of faith. Each of us
dwells in his own particular glass house, and so cannot afford to hurl
missiles at his neighbours; milk-magic or motor-mascots, pishogues or
palmistry, the method of

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

manifestation is of little account in comparison with the underlying
superstition. The latter is an unfortunate trait that has been handed
down to us from the infancy of the race; we have managed to get rid of
such physical features as tails or third eyes, whose day of usefulness
has passed; we no longer masticate our meat raw, or chip the rugged
flint into the semblance of a knife, but we still acknowledge our
descent by giving expression to the strange beliefs that lie in some
remote lumber-room at the back of the brain.

But it may be objected that belief in witches, ghosts, fairies, charms,
evil-eye, &c. &c., need not be put down as unreasoning superstition,
pure and simple, that in fact the trend of modern thought is to show us
that there are more things in heaven and earth than were formerly dreamt
of. We grant that man is a very complex machine, a microcosm peopled
with possibilities of which we can understand but little. We know that
mind acts on mind to an extraordinary degree, and that the imagination
can affect the body to an extent not yet fully realised, and indeed has
often

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

carried men far beyond the bounds of common-sense; and so we consider
that many of the elements of the above beliefs can in a general way be
explained along these lines. Nevertheless that does not do away with the
element of superstition and, we may add, oftentimes of
deliberately-planned evil that underlies. There is no need to resurrect
the old dilemma, whether God or the Devil was the principal agent
concerned; we have no desire to preach to our readers, but we feel that
every thinking man will be fully prepared to admit that such beliefs and
practices are inimical to the development of true spiritual life, in
that they tend to obscure the ever-present Deity and bring into
prominence primitive feelings and emotions which are better left to fall
into a state of atrophy. In addition they cripple the growth of national
life, as they make the individual the fearful slave of the unknown, and
consequently prevent the development of an independent spirit in him
without which a nation is only such in name. The dead past utters
warnings to the heirs of all the ages. It tells us already we have
partially

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

entered into a glorious heritage, which may perhaps be as nothing in
respect of what will ultimately fall to the lot of the human race, and
it bids us give our upward-soaring spirits freedom, and not fetter them
with the gross beliefs of yore that should long ere this have been
relegated to limbo.

"He cured the kye for Nanny Barton,"

home safely was to turn one's coat inside out and wear it in that
