<p align="center">(<i>Persian</i>)</p>  
<p><DIR>SOUL of the Soul!<br> Neither thought nor reason comprehend thy essence, and no one knows thy attributes.<br> Souls have no idea of thy being. The prophets themselves sink in the dust of thy road.<br> Although intellect exists by thee, has it ever yet found the path of thy existence?<br> O thou, who art in the interior and in the exterior of the soul! Thou art and thou art not that which I say.<br> In thy presence reason grows dizzy; it loses the thread that would direct it in thy way.<br> I perceive clearly the universe in thee, and yet discover thee not in the world.<br> All beings are marked with thy impress, but thyself hast no impress visible;<br> Thou reservest the secret of thine existence.</DIR></p>
