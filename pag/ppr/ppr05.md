### APACHE PRAYER

(*American*)

STENATLIHAN, You are good!  
I pray for a long life.  
I pray for your good looks.  
I pray for good breath.  
I pray for good speech.  
I pray for feet like yours to carry me through a long life.  
I pray for a life like yours.  
I walk with people, ahead of me all is well.  
I pray for people to smile as long as I live.  
I pray to live long.  
I pray, I say, for a long life to live with you where the good people
are.  
I live in poverty.  
I wish the people there to speak of goodness and to talk to me.  
I wish you to divide your good things with me, as a brother.  
Ahead of me is goodness, lead me on.

(Stenatlihan is the supreme sky goddess)
