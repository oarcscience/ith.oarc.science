### NAVAJO LITURGY

(American)

OH YOU!  
Who dwell in the house made of the Dawn.  
In the home of evening twilight.  
In the house made of dark cloud,  
In the house made of the he rains,  
In the house made of the dark mist,  
In the house made of the she rain,  
In the house made of peace;  
Where the dark mist curtains the door  
The path to which is on the rainbow,  
Where the zig-zag lightning on high it stands  
Male deity divine!  
With your moccasins of dark cloud, come to us!  
With your headdress of dark cloud, come to us!  
With clouds dark, your mind enveloping, come to us!  
You above thunder dark, high-flying, come to us!  
With cloud having shape at your feet, high-flying, come to us!  
With the dark cloud over your head made of far darkness, high-flying,
come to us!  
With the far darkness made of the he rain over your head, high-flying,
come to us!  
With your head over mist-dark made of far darkness, high-flying, come to
us!  
With the she rain over your head, made of far darkness, high-flying,
come to us!  
With your head over zig-zag lightning far out-flung, high-flying, come
to us!  
With your head over far hanging rainbow, high-flying, come to us!  
With clouds dark on the ends of your wings, made of far darkness,
high-flying, come to us.  
With the far darkness made of the he rain on the ends of your wings,
high-flying, come to us!  
With the dark mist on the ends of your wings, made of far darkness,
high-flying, come to us!  
With the far darkness made of the she rain on the ends of your wings,
high-flying, come to us!  
With zig-zag lightning flung out afar on the ends of your wings,
high-flying, come to us!  
With the rainbow hanging far on the ends of your wings, high-flying,
come to us!  
With the near darkness made of dark cloud, of he rain, of dark mist, of
she rain, high-flying, come to us!  
In the earth darkness come to us!  
With these also the foam to float on the flowing water over the roots of
the great corn, that I wish.  
Your sacrifice I have made,  
For you the smoke have I prepared.  
My feet for me restore,  
My body for me restore,  
My mind for me restore,  
My voice for me restore,  
This day your spell from me take out,  
This day your spell for me remove! Away from me you have taken it!  
Far off from me it is taken!  
Far off you have done it. In a way of beauty I recover,  
Happily my eyes regain their power,  
Happily for me the spell is taken off,  
[Impervious](errata.htm#0.md) to pain I walk,  
Feeling light within, I walk,  
Thus happily you accomplish your tasks.  
Happily the old men will regard you,  
Happily the children will regard you,  
Happily as they approach their homes they will regard you.  
Happily may their trails home be in the way of peace.  
Happily may all return!  
With beauty before me I walk.  
With beauty above me I walk.  
With beauty it is finished!  
With beauty again it is finished!
