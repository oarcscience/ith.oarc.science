### HYMN OF TLA-LOC

(*Mexican*)

(Tla-loc is the God of Storms. He dwells in Tlalocan where the spirits
of the elements toss the balls of thunder, and cast the reeds of
lightning. This is a masked dramatized ceremony to the rain god)

*Priests*

TO OUR land the god appears! His banner unfolds to the Four Ways and no
one weeps!"

*Tla-loc*

"I, the god, have returned again! I have turned again to the place of
abundance of sacrifices. West-ward, when the day grows old I am beheld
as a god."

*High Priest*

"Thy work is that of a magician divine! Truly thou hast made thyself to
be of our flesh. Thou hast made thyself, and who dare affront thee?"

*Tla-loc*

"Truly he who affronts me faces the dangers; My fathers took by the
heads the tigers and serpents!"

*Priests*

"In Tla-locan, the Place of the Divine, they play at ball! They cast the
reeds!"

*High Priest to Devotees*

"Go forth! Go forth to where the clouds are spread--where the thick mist
marks the cloudy house of Tla-loc!"

*Tla-loc*

"Go ye out to seek me! Seek for the voice I send forth as I rise--a
terrible god--a cry on the winds!"
