### HYMN TO THE UNKNOWN GOD

(*Peruvian*)

O RULER! Lord of the universe,  
Whether thou art male,  
Whether thou art female,  
Lord of reproduction  
Wherever thou mayest be!  
O Lord of divination  
Where art thou?  
Thou mayest be above,  
Thou mayest be below,  
Or perhaps around  
Thy splendid throne and sceptre.  
O hear me!  
From the sky above,  
In which thou mayest be,  
From the sea beneath  
In which thou mayest be.  
Creator of the world,  
Maker of all men;  
Lord of all Lords  
My eyes fail me for longing to see thee  
For the sole desire to know thee.  
O look down upon me  
For thou knowest me.  
The sun--the moon--  
The day--the night--  
Spring--winter,  
Are not ordained in vain  
By thee, O Deity!  
They all travel  
To the assigned place;  
They all arrive  
At their destined ends  
Whithersoever thou pleasest.  
Thy royal sceptre  
Thou holdest.  
O hear me!  
O choose me!  
Let it not be  
That I should tire,  
That I should die!
