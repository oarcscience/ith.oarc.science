### PRAYER OF TRANSFORMATION INTO A LOTUS

(*Egyptian*)

HAIL, thou lotus! Thou type of the god Nefer-Temu!

I am the man that knoweth you, and I know your names among those of the
gods, the lords of the under-world, and I am one of you.

Grant ye that I may see the gods who are the divine guides in the
underworld, and grant ye unto me a place in the underworld near unto the
lords of Amentet.

Let me arrive at a habitation in the land of Tchesert, and receive me, O
all ye gods, in the presence of the lords of eternity!

Grant that my soul may come forth whithersoever it pleaseth, and let it
not be driven away from the presence of the great company of the gods!
