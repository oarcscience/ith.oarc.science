### PRAYER OF THE SOWER

(*Finnish*)

BLESSING to the seed I scatter,  
Where it falls upon the meadow,  
By the grace of Ukko mighty,  
Through the open finger spaces  
Of the hand that all things fashioned.  
Queen of meadow-land and pasture!  
Bid the earth unlock her treasures.  
Bid the soil the young seed nourish,  
Never shall their teeming forces  
Never shall their strength prolific  
Fail to nourish and sustain us  
If the Daughters of Creation,  
They, the free and bounteous givers  
Still extend their, gracious favor  
Offer still their strong protection.  
Rise, O Earth! from out thy slumbers  
Bid the soil unlock her treasures!
