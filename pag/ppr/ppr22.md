### PRAYER OF THE GAMBLER

(*Hindu*)

THESE dice that have grown in the air on the great Vibhidaka tree, drive
me wild when they roll on the board! This Vibhidaka seems to me
intoxicating like a draught of Soma that has grown on Mount Mugovat.

When I think that I shall not play with them again, then am I left by my
friends who go afar. But when the brown dice are thrown down and utter
speech, then I rush to their rendezvous, like a love-sick maid.

These dice hook, prick, undo, burn and inflame. After the gift of
childish playthings they ruin the winner; yet to the gambler they are
covered with honey.

They do not bend before the anger of the mighty, even the king bends
down before them.

Though having no hands, they resist him who has hands. These playing
coals, though cold, when thrown on the board, burn the heart through and
through!

Make other friends, O dice--have mercy on us! Do not bewitch us with
powerful enchantment! May your wrath abate, and your enmity--let some
one else be held in the power of the brown dice!
