### HYMN TO AGNI

(*Hindu*)

(Agni, god of fire in every form, worshipped in every
manifestation--sun, lightning, earth, fire--also adored as the spark of
life in all of growth, is here invoked as both the sacred flame on the
altar, and the highest priest officiating)

I IMPLORE Agni, the chief priest, the divine minister of the sacrifice,
the Hotri priest, the best giver of wealth.  
Agni, worthy to be implored by former poets and by new, may he bring the
gods hither!  
Through Agni man gained wealth, satisfying even day by day, glorious
wealth of vigorous kindred.  
Agni, the offering which thou encirclest on all sides, that alone goes
to the gods.  
Agni, the Hotri priest, the wise counsellor, the truthful, the most
glorious, may he, the God, come with the gods!  
Whatever wealth thou, Agni, shalt bestow on the sacrificer, thine it
will be, forsooth, Agni.  
To thee, O Agni, we come day by day, bringing praise in mind, O
Illuminator of Darkness!  
To thee, the Lord of sacrifices, the bright Guarder of the Law, who art
growing in thy own house.  
Thou then, O Agni, be gracious to us like as a father to his son; stay
with us for our welfare!
