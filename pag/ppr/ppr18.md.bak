### HYMN TO PANU

(*Finnish*)

(Panu, God of fire, child of the Sun-mother)

O PANU, Son of the Sun!  
Offspring thou of the dear day.  
Lift the fire up to the sky.  
In the middle of the golden ring,  
Within the rock of copper,  
Carry it as a child to its mother  
Into the lap of the ancient mother.  
Place the fire to shine by day,  
And to rest at night.  
Let it rise every morning!  
Let it rest every evening!
