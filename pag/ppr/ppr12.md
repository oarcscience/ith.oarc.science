### CHINESE LITURGY

ONE in spirit,  
We invoke thee!  
Hail, Amit-abha of the world!  
O would that our merciful teacher, Sakya-muni,  
And our great Father Amit-abha Would now descend and be present with
us.  
Would that the perfect compassion-ate heart would now draw near And
receive our offerings.  
May the omnipotent and omniscient Holy Spirit  
Come to us while we recite these divine sentences.
