### HYMN TO CIHUA-COATL

(*Mexican*)

(Cihua-coatl, mythic, mother of earth-born people)

SERPENT Woman, plumed with eagle feathers, with the crest of eagles,
comes, beating her drum, from the Place of the Old.

She alone, who is our flesh, goddess of the fields and shrubs, is strong
to support us.

Our mother is as twelve eagles, goddess of drums calling the gods,
filling the fields.

She is our mother--a goddess of war, our mother, a companion from the
Home of Ancestors.

She comes forth, she appears when war is waged, she protects us in war
that we be not destroyed--an example and companion from the Home of the
Ancestors.

She comes adorned in the ancient manner with the eagle's crest,--in the
ancient manner with the eagle's crest!
