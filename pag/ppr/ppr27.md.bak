### HYMN OF THE GOD OF FLOWERS

(*Mexican*)

(High Priest, masked as the god, chants)  
(Kin-teotl--God of maize)  
(Tla-loc--God of storms and the wide plains)

O FRIENDS! The quetzal bird sings--it sings its song at midnight to
Kin-teotl.  
The god now hears my song by night, he will hear my song as the night
brings in the dawn.  
I send forth the priests to the house of Tla-loc.  
The priests to the house of Tla-loc do I send forth.  
I shall go forth to the plains. I shall join myself to them. I shall go
where is Kin-teotl. I shall follow the trail to him.  
The priests go forth to the house of Tla-loc, to the home of the god of
the plains!
