### MOHAMMEDAN PRAYER OF ADORATION

(*Persian*)

SOUL of the Soul!  
Neither thought nor reason comprehend thy essence, and no one knows thy
attributes.  
Souls have no idea of thy being. The prophets themselves sink in the
dust of thy road.  
Although intellect exists by thee, has it ever yet found the path of thy
existence?  
O thou, who art in the interior and in the exterior of the soul! Thou
art and thou art not that which I say.  
In thy presence reason grows dizzy; it loses the thread that would
direct it in thy way.  
I perceive clearly the universe in thee, and yet discover thee not in
the world.  
All beings are marked with thy impress, but thyself hast no impress
visible;  
Thou reservest the secret of thine existence.
