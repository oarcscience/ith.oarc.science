### HYMN TO AMUN-RA

(*Egyptian*)

HAIL to thee, Amun-Ra, Lord of the thrones of the earth, the oldest
existence, ancient of heaven, support of all things;  
Chief of the gods, lord of truth; father of the gods, maker of men and
beasts and herbs; maker of all things above and below;  
Deliverer of the sufferer and oppressed, judging the poor;  
Lord of wisdom, lord of mercy; most loving, opener of every eye, source
of joy, in whose goodness the gods rejoice, thou whose name is hidden.  
Thou art the one, maker of all that is, the one; the only one; maker of
gods and men; giving food to all.  
Hail to thee, thou one with many heads; sleepless when all others sleep,
adoration to thee.  
Hail to thee from all creatures from every land, from the height of
heaven, from the depth of the sea.  
The spirits thou hast made extol thee, saying, welcome to thee, father
of the fathers of the gods; we worship thy spirit which is in us.
