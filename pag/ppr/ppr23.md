### PRAYER TO KAMI-DANA

(*Japanese*)

REVERENTLY adoring the great god of the two palaces of Ise,
.............................. and the gods of the branch temples and
branch palaces, and Sohodo no kami, whom I have invited to the shrine
set upon this divine altar, and to whom I offer praises day by day.

I pray with awe that they will deign to correct the unwitting faults,
which, heard and seen by them, I have committed, and blessing and
favoring me according to the powers which they severally wield, cause me
to follow the divine example and to perform good works in the Way.

(The House God)
