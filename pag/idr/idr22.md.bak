### SUN-WORSHIP.

WHATEVER the earlier savage races may have thought of religion, if they
thought at all about it, those who came after, with more or less touch
of civilization, were led, in Ireland, as elsewhere, to contemplate
Deity in the Sun. Sun-worship may have superseded other and grosser
forms of Nature worship.

Stuart-Glennie has well expressed our thoughts thus--"We should be quite
unable truly to understand how the central myths and poesies originated,
if we cannot, in some degree at least, realize the wonder with which men
saw the daily and yearly renewed sublime spectacle of the birth, the
life course, and the death of the life-and-light-giving Creator actually
visible in the Heavens.--A wonder of eternal Re-birth."

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

Dr. Tylor has reason when saying, "In early philosophy throughout the
world, the sun and moon were alive, and, as it were, human in their
nature." Professor Rhys refers to the tendency of the savage "to endow
the sun, moon, the sky, or any feature of the physical world admitting
of being readily acknowledged with a soul and body, with parts and
passions, like their own."

In all ages, in all climes, and in all nations, the Sun, under various
names and symbols, was regarded as the Creator and as sustainer of all
things.

Egypt, the primeval seat of learning, was the high seat of Sun
adoration. The Sphinx, with the face to the east, represents Harmachus,
young Horus, or the rising Sun. The orb is Osiris, the ruling god of
day. In its descent it is the dying deity, going below to the land of
Shades; but only to be resurrected as the victorious Horns, piercing the
head of the dragon of darkness. Twice a year did the bright; rays enter
the great hail of the Nile temple, to fall straight upon the shrine.

The ancient Persian bowed to Mithra as the Sun, for it was said--

"May he come to us for protection, for joy,  
For mercy, for healing, for victory, for hallowing.  
Mithra will I honour with offerings,  
Will I draw near to us as a Friend with prayer."

The Assyrians, the Akkadians, the Phœnicians, Greeks, the Romans, all
alike worshipped the sun, Merodach, Baal, Apollo, or Adonis. Rabbi
Issaaki reads Tammuz of Ezek. ch. viii, as the *burning one*: i. e.
Moloch.

India has down to this day reverenced the Sun. Its Vedic names grew into
some sort of active personality "We can follow," writes Max Müller, "in
the Vedic hymn step by step, the development which changes the sun fro a
mere luminary into a creator, preserver, ruler." "As the

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

sun sees everything, and knows everything, he is asked to forgive and
forget what he alone has seen and knows." He may be Indra, Varuna,
Savritri, or Dyaus, the shining one. What to us is poetry was in India
prose.

Even in Homer, Hyperion, the sun-god, was the father of all gods.
According to Plato, Zeu-pater, or Jupiter, was the Father of Life.
Minerva, or Pallas, the early dawn, sprang from the head of Jove every
morning, fully armed, to fight the clouds of darkness. Baldur, the
*white god*, or sun, was killed, said our Norseman and Saxon
forefathers, by an arrow from the blind Höder, or night. Africa has in
all time been a centre of sun-worship. The Spaniards found the cult both
in Mexico and Peru.

There are survivals of the worship in the customs and languages of
Europe. Up to this century, a singular ceremony took place in the church
of the Carmine, Naples, attended by civic officials in procession. The
day after Christmas Day, when the new sun of the year began then first
to move in position, there was a solemn cutting of the hair of an image,
symbol of the sun's rays, as in the old heathen times.

A Scotch dance, the *Reel*, still keeps up the memory of the old Celtic
circular dance. There is, also, the *Deisol*, or practice of turning
sun-ways, to bless the sun. This was from right to left, as with Dancing
Dervishes now, or the old Bacchic dance from east to west. Plautus
wrote, "When you worship the gods, do it turning to the right hand."
Poseidonius the Stoic, referring to the Celts, said, "At their feasts,
the servant carries round the wine from right to left. Thus they worship
their gods, turning to the right." The Highland mother, with a choking
child, cries out, "*Deas-iul*! the way of the South." A *Dîsul* Sunday
is still kept up in Brittany.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

A stone was dug up in the road from Glasgow to Edinburgh, on which was
an inscription to *Grannius*, the Latin form of *grian*, the sun.
Enclosures in the Highlands were called *Grianan*, the house of the sun.
On Harris Island is a stone circle, with a stone in the centre, known as
*Clack-na-Greine*, the stone of the sun. At Elgin, the bride had to lead
her husband to the church following the sun's course.

But did the Irish indulge in this form of idolatry?

Some writers, zealous for the honour of their countrymen, have denied
the impeachment. Even the learned O'Curry was of that school,
declaring--"There is no ground whatever for imputing to them human
sacrifice--none whatever for believing that the early people of Erinn
adored the sun, moon, or stars, nor that they worshipped fire."

But what was St. Patrick's teaching?

The Saint is recorded to have said of the sun, "All, who adore him shall
unhappily fall into eternal punishment" In his *Confessio*, he
exclaimed, "Woe to its unhappy worshippers, for punishment awaits them
But we believe in and adore the true Sun, Christ!"

Morien, the modern and enthusiastic Welsh Bard, is equally desirous to
remove from his sires the reproach of being sun-worshippers "One of the
Welsh names of the sun," he remarks, "proves that they believed in a
personal God, and that they believed He dwelt in the sun That name of
the sun is *Huan*, the abode of *Hu*" (the Deity) Elsewhere he writes,
"There was no such a being as a Sun-God in the religious systems of the
Druids. They named the sun the *House of God* (Huan-Annedd Hu)." Again,
"The Gwyddorr (*High Priest*), was emblematical of the Spirit of God in
the sun. The Gwyddon was clad in robe of virgin white, symbolizing light
and holiness. His

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

twelve disciples, representing the twelve constellations, formed the
earthly zodiac. They too were robed in white." Morien is the ablest
living advocate of Welsh Druidism, but his views on that subject are
somewhat governed by his extensive reading, his love of symbolism, and
his poetic temperament.

St. Patrick gives, according to an Erse poem, no such credit to the
Irish; crying out, "O blasphemous Cumhal, that honour you pay to the
sun, through ignorance of the omnipotent King, is no more perfect than
if you worshipped your shield." The Milligans, in their learned story of
the Irish under the Druids, say, "They worshipped the sun as their
principal Deity, and the moon as their second Deity, like the
Phœnicians."

Donald Ross, Scotch Inspector of Schools, writes in a similar way of his
ancient northern kindred--"The noblest strains in all Gaelic literature
are in praise of the sun, and which is also represented as the
ultimately inexplicable factor in the universe. In the sun the Gaels
found the two highest attributes of divinity, power, and purity."

There is a remarkable passage from St. Patrick's *Confession*, which
refers to his being tempted by Satan in a dream--"It was suggested to me
in the spirit that I should invoke *Helia* (*Elias* or *Eli*); and
meanwhile I saw the sun rising in the heaven. And while I was calling
out *Helia* with all my might, behold the splendour of that sun fell
upon me, and immediately struck from me the oppressive weight." Probus
had this version of the event, "When he had thrice invoked the true Sun,
immediately the sun rose upon him."

The language of the country has much association with sun adoration. The
mythical Simon Brek of Irish history may be *Samen*, the sun. Waterford
was *Cuan-na-Grioth*, the harbour of the sun. One Irish name for the sun
is

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

*Chrishna*, of Eastern origin; but the Welsh *Hu Gadarn*, the sun, was
*Finn Mac Haul* in Erse.

Griann, Greine, Grianan, Greienham, have relations to the sun. The hill
*Grianan Calry* is a sunny spot. The word *Grange* is from *Griann*.
There is a *Grianoir* in Wexford Bay. The *Grange*, near Drogheda, is a
huge cone of stones, piled in honour of the sun. Greane, of Ossory, was
formerly *Grian Airbh*. As *Graine*, the word occurs in a feminine form.
The beautiful story of Diarmuid, or Dermot, and Graine is clearly a
solar myth The runaway pair were pursued by the irate husband, Finn Mac
Coul, for a whole year, the lovers changing their resting-place every
night. One bard sings of "Diarmuid with a fiery face" The last Danaan
sovereign was *Mac Grene* The, cromlech on a hill of Kilkenny is known
as the *Sleigh Grian*, hill of the sun. The women's quarter of that
dwelling, was the *Grianan*, so-called from its brightness.

The cromlech at Castle Mary, near Cloyne, is *Carrig Croath*, Rock of
the Sun General Vallencey traces some appellations for the sun to the
Chaldaic and Sanscrit The Celts of Brittany borrowed their *Sul*, for
sun, from the Roman *Sol*. *Caer Sedi* was an Irish cycle.

Bel is also the sun in Irish, as in eastern lands. Beli was their god of
fire *Bel-ain* were wells sacred to the sun. The Irish vernal equinox
was *Aiche Baal tinne* the night of Baal's fire. The sun's circuit was
*Bel-ain*, or Bel's ring. A cycle of the sun, or an anniversary, was
Aonach (pro. Enoch); and it is singular that we are told that the days
of Enoch were 365 years.

Easter, as is well known, is connected with sun-worship. The Irish
Dancing Easter Sunday is thus alluded to in an old poem --

"But, Dick, she dances in such a way,  
No sun upon an Easter day  
     Is half so fine a sight."

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

People used to be out early on Easter Sunday to see the sun dance in
honour of the Resurrection.

The sun and moon, according to the *Chronicles of St. Columba*, were to
be seen on an altar of glass in the temple of the Tuath-de-Danaan, in
Tyrconnal. For centuries, an Irish oath was accompanied with the hand on
forehead, and the eyes turned to the sun. The round mounds, or Raths,
enclosing the round dwelling, related to early sun-worship; the same may
be said of the tradition that the battle of Ventry, between the Fenians
and their foes, lasted 366 days.

Hecateus mentions the Hyperboreans of an island north of Gaul
worshipping the sun. Diodorus speaks of the island's idolatry, saying,
"The citizens are given up to music, harping, and chanting in honour of
the sun." In Walker's *Bards*, we read of the Feast of Samhuin, or the
moon, in the temple of Tiachta. "The moon," says Monier Williams, the
great Vedas authority, "is but a form of the sun."

The circular dance in honour of the sun was derived from the East.
Lucian says "it consisted of a dance imitating this god" (the sun). The
priests of Baal indulged in it. A Druid song has this account--"Ruddy
was the sea-beach while the circular revolution was performed by the
attendants, and the white bands in graceful extravagance."

An ancient sculpture at Glendalough represents the long-haired Apollo,
or Sun, attended by his doves. These were sun-images in Erin. In 2
Chron. xiv. 5, we read of Asa putting "away out of all cities of Judah
the high places and the images"; or *sun-images* of the Revised Version.

At the *Lucaid-lamh-fada*, or festival of love, from Aug. 1 to Aug. 16,
games were held in honour of the sun

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

and moon. Fosbroke alludes to the revolving, with the sun, as a
superstition. "At Inismore, or Church Island, in Sligo, in a rock near
the door of the church, is a cavity, called *Our Lady's Bed*, into which
pregnant women going, and turning thrice round, with the repetition of
certain prayers, fancy that they would then not die in child-birth."

A Scotch writer observes--"The hearty Celts of Ireland say, 'The top of
the morning to you.' Are these expressions to be regarded as remnants of
Dawn-worship? It may be so, for many similar traces of the worship of
the sun and moon, as givers of good fortune, are still to be found."

An Ode to the Sun in the *Leabhar breac* has been thus rendered by an
Erse authority:--"Anticipate, my lays, O Sun! thou mighty Lord of the
seven heavens--mighty governor of the heaven--sole and general God of
man--thou gracious, just, and supreme King--whose bright image
constantly forces itself on my attention. To whom heroes pray in perils
of war--all the world praise and adore thee. For thou art the only
glorious and sovereign object of universal love, praise, and adoration."

Similarly sang Orpheus of old--"O Sun! thou art the genial parent of
Nature, splendent with various hues, shedding streams of golden light."
The Rig Veda, however, in one place calls the sun, "the most beautiful
work of God"; while another of the Hindoo sacred books has this--"Let us
adore the supremacy of the Divine Sun, the godhead." Well might Capella
exclaim in his Hymn to the Sun, "The whole world adores thee under a
great number of different names"

Ossian sang--"When wilt thou rise in thy beauty, first of Erin's maids?
Thy sleep is long in the tomb. The sun shall not come to thy bed, and
sing, 'Awake Darthula! Awake, thou first of women! The voice of spring

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

is abroad. The flowers shake their heads on the green hills. The woods
wave their growing leaves.' Retire, O Sun! The daughter of Colla is
asleep. She will not come forth in her beauty. She will not move in the
steps of her loveliness."

Crowe, who observes, "The sun was a chief deity with us as well as the
Greeks,"--adds, "I have long thought that the great moat of Granard was
the site of a temple to the sun." The Rev. F. Leman, in 1811, spoke of
an inscription upon a quartzose stone, at Tory Hill, Kilkenny, in old
Irish characters, which he read *Sleigh-Grian*, hill of the sun. "Within
view of this hill," said he, "towards the west, on the borders of
Tipperary, rises the more elevated mountain of Sleigh-na-man, which,
from its name, was probably consecrated to the moon."

When Martin was in the Hebrides, he came across observances reminding
him of solar worship. "In the Island of Rona," said he, "off Ness, one
of the natives needs express his high esteem for my person, by making a
turn round about me, sun-ways, and at the same time blessing me, and
wishing me all happiness." Again--"When they get into the Island
(Flannan) all of them uncover their heads, and make a turn sun-ways
round, thanking God for their safety." The Rev. Mac Queen mentions that
every village in Skye had a rude stone, called *Grugach*, or
fair-haired, which represented the sun; and he declares that milk
libations were poured into Gruaich stones.

Travellers have written of Hebridean boats, going out to sea, having
their heads rowed sun-ways at first for fear of ill-luck on the voyage.
Quite recently one observed the same thing done by Aberdeen fishermen,
who objected to turn their boat against the sun.

In all myths, sun-gods are very successful in their war-like

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

enterprises during the summer, but frequently lose a battle in winter,
In Egyptian paintings, the winter sun is represented with only a single
hair on the head; this reminds one of Samson,--a word derived from
*Shemesh*, the sun--losing strength in the loss of hair.

The shaving of the head, so as to leave a circular, bare spot, is a very
ancient practice, and was done in honour of the sun, by certain priests
of Jupiter and other deities. Mahomet forbade that idolatrous habit of
his Arab disciples. Rhys calls the tonsure in Britain and Ireland,
"merely a druidical survival?'

While the image of the sun was, down to the great Revolution, carried in
the priestly processions of Brittany, while Christians now, as the
Peruvians used to do formerly, stand the plate-image of the sun upon the
altar, and while we, though aesthetically, honour the sun-flower, we
cannot too rudely condemn the ancient Irish for their reverent bowing to
the material author of all earthly life.
