### GERMAN DRUIDISM.

Louis de Baecker, 1854, gave an account of Teutonic Druidism, similar to
that of the Belgæ of Britain, in his *De la Religion du Nord de la
France avant le Christianisme*. He, unlike men of the Welsh Druidic
school, joins Dr. Ledwich, and some Irish authorities, in tracing
Druidism to the German and Scandinavian races; saying, "The religion of
our pagan ancestors was that of Odin or Woden." But he evidently refers
to north-eastern France rather than north-western, as he derives the
religion from the Edda. In the book *Volu-Spa*, or the Priestess, the
first song of the poetic Edda, he discovers what Ossian and other
British and Irish bards describe as Spirits of the air, of earth, of
waters, of plains, and woods. "Cæsar was deceived," says he, "when he
said that the Germans had neither priests nor religious ceremonies; for
Tacitus mentions them in his *Germania* in the most formal manner." By
the way, if Cæsar was so mistaken about the Germans, whom he knew so
well, is his evidence about Gaulish Druids worth much?

Baecker's northern Gauls had priests of various kinds. The sacrificers
were called *Blodmanner*, or *Pluostari*; the sustainers of order were
*Ewart* and *Gotes-ewart*; the protectors of sacred woods, *Harugari*,
*Parawari*, or *Wihesmart*; the prophets, *Spamadhr, Wizago, Vitega,
Veitsga, Weissager, Wetekey*. The Priestesses were the *Vaulur*. The
horse, bull, boar, and sheep were sacrificed. "It was in the middle of
the wood," he writes, "that the Belgæ offered their sacrifices." The
Belgic Britons, doubtless, had a similar Druidism.

Cæsar asserts that the Germans had no Druids, while be credits the
German Belgæ of South Britain with having them.
