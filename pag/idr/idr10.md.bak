### FRENCH DRUIDISM.

The *Deroo* of Brittany were more ancient, said Henri Martin, than those
Druids known to Romans; being "primitive Druids, a sacerdotal caste of
old Celts." Yet Forlong, who believed the Gallic coast tribes long
traded and intermarried with the Phœnicians, saw "abundant evidences for
their worshipping Astarte and Herakles." They were Saronidæ, or judges.
They were the builders, masons, or like Gobhan Saer, free smiths. Of
Saer, O'Brien in his *Round Towers* says--"The first name ever given to
this body (Freemasons) was *Saer*, which has three significations:
firstly, *free*; secondly, *mason*; and thirdly,

son of

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

*God*." Keane calls him "one of the Guabhres or Cabiri, such as you have
ever seen him represented on the Tuath de Danaan Cross at Clonmacnoise."

A Breton poem, *Ar Rannou*, a dialogue between a Druid and his pupil, is
still sung by villagers, as it may have been by their ancestors, the
*Venite* of Cæsar's story. The seat of the Archdruid of Gaul was at
Dreux.

French writers have interested themselves in the Druidic question. The
common impression is that Druids were only to be found in Brittany; but
other parts of France possessed those priests arid bards. Certainly the
northwest corner, the region of megalithic remains, continued later to
be their haunt, being less disturbed there. It was in Brittany, also,
that the before-mentioned Oriental mysticism found so safe a home, and
was nurtured so assiduously. But Druids were equally known in the south,
centre, and north-east of France.

Dijon Druids, or the *Vacies*, were described in 1621 by Guenebauld of
Dijon in *Le Reveil de Chyndonax, Prince des Vacies Drvydes Celtiqves
Düonois*. Upon the tomb of the Archdruid Chyndonax was found an
inscription in Greek, thus rendered by the Dijon author--

"En ce tombeau, dans le sacré boccage  
Du Dieu Mithras, est contenu le corps  
De Chyndonax grand Prestre; mechant hors,  
Les Dieux Sanneurs le gardent de dommage."

Numbers of the learned went to view the inscription, and an urn found
within the tomb. Mithras was a form of Apollo, or the Sun. There are
other evidences of the southern Gaulish Druids using Greek characters,
beyond Cæsar's assertions.

Guenebauld spoke of the prohibition of the Druidical religion by the
Emperors Augustus, Tiberias, and Claudius; adding that the Druids
"furent chassez du mont Drvys or

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

Drvyde proche d'ostum, a cause de leur trop cruel sacrifice d'hommes."
He declared that after the general Edict of Claudius "il ne s'en treuva
plus, parmy les Gaulois." When banished from Gaul, they retired to
Britain, though Druidesses were mentioned as being at Dijon in the time
of Aurelian.

Beaudeau, in 1777, published *Memoire à consuilter pour les anciens
Druides Gaulois*, intended as a vindication of them against the
strictures of Bailly in his letters to Voltaire. He had a great belief
in the astronomical skill of the Druids, from their use of the thirty
years cycle, the revolution period of the planet Saturn.

At the Congress of Arras, in 1853, the question debated was--"Up to what
period Roman polytheism had penetrated into Belgic Gaul;--and up to what
period continued the struggle between Polytheism and Christianity?" The
French author remarks, "The Romans did but one thing--gave the names of
their gods to the divinities of the people of Fleanderland. And these
divinities--what were they? Evidently those of the country from which
the people had been forced to flee."

Dezobry and Bachelets, in their *Dictionnaire de Biographie, &c*.,
affirm that "the Celtic word *derouyd* (from *de* or *di*, God, and
*rhoud* or *rhouid*, speaking) signifies Interpreter of the gods, or one
who speaks from the gods. According to others, the etymology should be,
in the Gaelic language, *druidheacht*, divination, magic; or, better,
*dern*, oak, and *wydd*, mistletoe." Acknowledging the ancient renown of
their knowledge, it is admitted to be imperfectly known to us, though
Pythagoreans pretended to be the founders thereof. The French authors
had the following account of the Druids' great charm--

"They carried suspended from their neck, as a mark of dignity, a
serpent's egg--a sort of oval ball of crystal,

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

that in the time of Pliny tradition pretended to be the product of the
foam of a quantity of serpents, grouped and interlaced together. This
egg has been the origin of a crowd of superstitions, which, up to a
century ago, were in vogue in Cornwall, Wales, and the mountains of
Scotland; they continued to carry these balls of glass, called *serpent
stones*, to which they attributed particular virtues."

Druidesses of Gaul had a sanctuary on the Isle of Sena, Finisterre.
Druidism in France was condemned as late as 658, by the Council of
Nantes; and, later on, by the Capitularies of Charlemagne. Renan
supposed that Druidism remained a form exclusively national. Justin's
remark, that "the Greek colony of Marseilles civilized the Gauls," may
help to explain how Gaulish Druids knew Greek, and how some French
writers traced Druidism to the Phocians of Southern Gaul. Then, again,
we have Ammianus Marcellinus saying, "The Druids were formed into
fraternities as the authority of Pythagoras decreed." Cæsar, in his
account of Gaulish Druids, had clearly in his mind his own country's
faith. They were like his own augurs, and their Archdruid was his
*pontifex maximus*.

D'Arbois de Jubainville, in his account of Irish Mythology, has, of
course, references to the Druids. He lays emphasis on the difference
between those of Gaul and those of our islands. The judicial authority
was vested in the *Filé*. These need not, like the Druids proper
celebrate sacrifices. He traces the word *file*, a seer, from the same
root as the Breton *givelout*, to see.

The French author records that Polyhistor, Timagenus, Valerius Maximus,
and others wrote of the north-western men holding Pythagorean doctrines;
but he adds, that while a second birth was regarded by the Pythagoreans
as a punishment of evil, it was esteemed by the others as a privilege of
heroes.
