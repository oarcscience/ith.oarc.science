### THE SACRED TARA HILL

TARA, Temor, Temhuir, or Temoria, is intimately connected with the early
religion of Ireland, and has been associated with singular theories. As
*Tea-mur*, it was the mount or home of Queen Tea, wife of the Milesian
King Heremon. The centre of Druidical song and power, the seat of
ancient royalty, Tara was a favourite subject of glorification by
ancient annalists, and has been immortalized in the poem of Moore. But,
while bards record

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

a great assembly being held there 921 B.C., Dr. Petrie, the eminent
antiquary, is disposed to regard the place as existing only between 200
and 300 years after Christ.

The high civilization at Tara has been a favourite subject for Bards.
The old lady guide at Tara told us that only gold and silver vessels
were used at the banquets. Dr. Ledwich laughs at the yarns about its
twenty-seven kitchens, and its amazing bill of daily fare. He assures us
that the story of Tara rests only upon the fragment of a fragment in the
Seabright collection, that had neither the name of its author nor a
date. The earliest Romish ecclesiastics, and mediæval writers, knew
nothing of early Irish culture or wealth.

We must refer to the works of Dr Petrie for a description of the several
halls, mounds, raths, cairns, and tombs still to be traced, with
distinguished appellations connect with heroes and prophets of old. The
*Feis*, or Irish Parliaments, were wont to meet in the so-styled
Banqueting Hall. An ancient Celtic bard had this account of the grave of
the Queen that came from Spain--

"Tephi was her name! She excelled all virgins!  
Wretched for him who had to entomb her.  
Sixty feet of correct measurement  
Were marked as a sepulchre to enshrine her."

The Tara stone, or the *Dallan*, Stone of Destiny, refer to by writers
of the tenth century, is declared by Petrie to be the cylindrical
obelisk still seen six feet of the ground, with other so called
Druidical monuments. The tourist is shown the spot where Lucad the Druid
burned in the house from which Benen, St Patrick disciple, had escaped.
The story, as told in Latin Maccuthenius, contains one of the traditions
connected with the reputed life of Ireland's apostle, and illustrates
the contest at Tara between the Saint and the Druids--

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

"All these things being done in the sight of the King between the
magicians and Patrick, the King says to them, 'Cast your books into the
water, and him whose books shall escape uninjured we will adore.'
Patrick answered, 'I will do so.' And the magician said,' I am unwilling
to come to the trial by water with that man, because he has water as his
god' (alluding to baptism). The contest was to be settled, therefore, by
fire. A house was constructed of boughs, half green and half dry. The
magician went into the green part, and Benin into the dry. The fire came
and consumed the green, with the Druid, but the Christian was not hurt."

Other stories connected with the preacher at Tara are narrated elsewhere
in the present work, and relate to a period subsequent to the
institution of the Ollamh Fodhla college at Tara. But the modern school
of Anglo-Israel attach other ideas to that ancient seat of sanctity.
Heber of the bards is to them Hebrew. Tara is named from Terah. Jeremiah
fled thither after the siege of Jerusalem, carrying away the treasures
of the temple; as, the ark, the sceptre of David, the Urim and Thummim,
and others. Some persons at this day affect to believe that in the Hill
of Tara might yet be found these memorials of Judaism, and hope to
recover thence David's harp, carried to Ireland by Jeremiah and the
Princess Scota, daughter of Pharaoh.

The Rev. F. R. A. Glover, M.A., has no doubt about its possession of the
sacred stone; saying, "The Foundation Pillar which the Jews regarded for
six hundred years with veneration, as Jacob's Pillow, in their temple on
Araunah's threshing-floor, and which, being lost in the destruction of
their sanctuary, B.C. 588, has appeared in Ireland as the precious *Liag
Phail*, brought thither by Hebrew men in a ship of Dan, *cir*. 584."

The same authority elsewhere advances the following--

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

"In Ireland, in the royal precincts of Tara, *cir*. B.C. 582-3, there
was a Hebrew system and transplanted Jerusalem, set up in a sort of
abeyance in sanctuary; actual, operative,; but unknown; real, but for
some wise purpose kept out of sight; a throne set up by a Hebrew prophet
(Jeremiah) reset in sanctuary." Some pious friends of the Anglo-Israel
movement have desired a digging search over Tara, now a wilderness
region, to discover the missing treasures from Solomon's temple.

The romance connected with Tara we thus perceive still blossoming at the
end of the nineteenth century. It began with heathens, was discoursed on
by Catholics, is reverenced by Protestants. We still dream and sing of
"The harp that once through Tara's halls."

The Rath on the slope, between the hill of Tara and river Boyne on the
west, was the site of the burial of the heroes of the Battle of Gavra.
The grave of Oscar is still shown.

"We buried Oscar of the red arms  
On the north side of the great Gavra."

The palace of Teamair, or Tara, was held by the Tuatha. The chief
college of the Druids was at Tara. There were held the national
convention of the Teamorian Fes. It was associated with the marriage
sports of the Tailtean The foundation is attributed to the wise Ollam
Fodhla.

O'Hartigan, of the tenth century, the author of the *Book of Ballymote*,
spoke of it --

"Fair was its many-sided tower,  
Where assembled heroes famed in story;  
Many were the tribes to which it was inheritance,  
Though decay lent a green grassy land."

He sang its praises under Cormac O'Cusinn, when it was a fortress; when,
at banquets, three hundred cup-bearers

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

handed round three times fifty goblets, "which cups were of gold or of
silver all."

"In Meath," said Hollinshed, "is a hill called the Hill of Taragh,
wherein is a plaine twelve score long, which was named the Kempe his
Hall; where the countrie had their meetings and folkmotes at a place
that was accounted the high palace of the monarch.--The Irish hammer
manic fables in this forge, of Fin Mac Coile and his chieftains. But
doubtless the place seemeth to beare a show of an ancient and famous
monument."

When Widow Feelin, the guide,--wrinkled, freckled, wasted, wizen, bent
at an angle of 45 degrees,--hurried over the ground with the weight of
75 years to show us the wonders of Tara, she pointed out the "plaine
twelve score long," as the site of the far-famed Banqueting Hall. She
told us of the vessels of gold and silver, served by three hundred
butlers. She could show no stone remains, for sure, the palace was of
polished oak. She gloated over the graves of fifty croppies (soldiers);
and, seating herself on the turf, sang a long ballad of past glory, in
which O'Connell was duly remembered, and the Repeal meeting on Tara
Hill, at which she had been present. Looking round upon nine counties,
she mourned the loss of Erin's pride, as an aged Fenian Druidess might
have done. She said that some persons wanted to search the grave-mounds
over Tara's departed heroes, but that she had roused the villagers, who
drove off the sacrilegious party. To her patriotic ardour, the sanctity
of Tara and its departed Druids and Princes may be safely confided.

Mrs. Wilkes reads in the antiquity of Temora as the Teman of Edom, of
Midian as the old name for Meath, of Padan Aram, of Laban, of Levi now
Lewes, of Danaans from Dan, of Jacob's pillow Lia Fail, of the Irish
genealogy in the first of Chronicles, of the tablets of Druids being the

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

*peeled rods* of Jacob, &c., &c., testifying to the glory of Tara. The
old Patriarchal religion of Chaldæa was one. with the ancient faith of
Erin.

Lastly, and not to be forgotten, the association of the Holy Stone with
Tara signifies the place above all in some persons' estimation. Dr.
Petrie discourses eloquently upon the *Bod Thearghais*, which bears,
however, a surprising phallic signification. "It is," says he, "an
interesting fact that a large obeliscal pillar stone, in a prostrate
position, occupied, until a recent period, the very situation on the
Hill of Tara, pointed out as the place of the Lia Fail by the Irish
writers of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries; and that this was
a monument of pagan antiquity, an Idol Stone, as the Irish writers call
it, will see evident from its form and character."

Tara, therefore, occupies no mean position in the history of religion in
Ireland.

HOWTH HILL, overlooking Dubhlinn or Dublin Bay not far from *Eblana*,
Dublin, and rising 578 feet above the water, was a hallowed spot long
before St. Patrick was at Tara. It was the *Ben Edir* or *Edair* of the
Fenians, a so called from its oaks. The Danes destroyed its Halls in
819. The *Book of Howth* chronicles events from 432 to 1370. The Danish
word *Howeth* is from *Hoved*, a head, Ptolemy's *Edras* became *Edar*.
A Fenian poem runs thus:--

"How sweet from proud Ben Edir's height  
To see the ocean roll in sight;  
And fleets, swift bounding on the gale,  
With warriors clothed in shining mail.  
Most beauteous hill, around whose head  
Ten thousand sea-birds' pinions spread;  
May joy thy lord's true bosom thrill,  
Chief of the Fenians' happy hill."

 

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

Ireland' Eye, a little isle north of Howth harbour, is also associated
with early religious history. It was the *Inis Nessan*, from St. Mac
Nessan, of the Royal family of Leinster, who, in the sixth century, had
his oratory at *Inis Erean*, as then it was called. The word *Eye* is
from the Danish *Ey*, Island. There it was that the holy man was
assailed, as the story goes, by the formidable chief of hell, who sought
to terrify him by his gigantic and terrible form. The Saint, excited,
threw his book at the fiend, driving him against a rock which, splitting
open, received him within itself.

The Abbey of Howth was erected in 1235. Fin Mac Coul's *Quoit*, a stone
of many tons weight, is now seen covering a cromlech, upon which these
verses were written by S. Ferguson, Q.C., recording the burial of the
fair Fenian, Aideen--

"They hewed the stone; they heaped the cairn:  
      Said Ossian, 'In a queenly grave  
We leave her 'mong her fields of fern,  
      Between the cliff and wave.'  
The cliff behind stands clear and bare,  
      And bare above, the heathery steep  
Scales the blue heaven's expanse to where  
      The Danaan Druids sleep.

And here hard by her natal bower,  
      On lone Ben Adair's side we strive  
With lifted rock, and signs of power,  
      To keep her name alive.  
That while from circling year to year,  
      The ogham letter'd stone is seen,  
The Gael shall say, 'Our Fenians here  
      Entombed their loved Aideen.'"
