# Irish Druids And Old Irish Religions

#### by James Bonwick

#### \[1894\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This scholarly, but very readable, book covers what was known about
Druids and Irish Paganism at the end of the nineteenth century. It
discusses many of the concepts which later would be utilized by the
Wiccan movement to construct Celtic Neo-Paganism.
