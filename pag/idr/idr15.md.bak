### DRUIDICAL MYSTICISM.

However orthodox the Irish of the present day may be esteemed, there
must have been a fair amount of mysticism in the past amongst so
imaginative a race. Perhaps this quality brought them into some
disrepute with the Church, down to the time when the Pope gave their
country to the Norman King of England, in order to bring the people into
more consistent faith. Even St. Bernard, in his *Life of Malachy*,
referred to the Irish as "Pagans, while calling themselves Christians."

John Scotus Erigena, the learned Irishman of the ninth century, was
certainly mystical in his views. He spoke of God as the essence of all
things; of the Divine *Dark* and Supreme *Nothing*; of creation being
only an eternal self-unfolding of the Divine Nature; of all things
resolved or self-drawn to God; of time and space, of modes of conception
of the present state, &c.

Gould's *History of Freemasonry* refers to the connection between the
Druids and Freemasons. The Papal Bull of 1751 against the latter might
have been applied to the former:--

"The strict bond of secrecy--the oath to keep secret--at variance with
civil and canon law--of ill repute amongst wise and good men." Clement
XII. was followed in his condemnation of Freemasons by Benedict XIV.

The Zohar of the Kabbala taught that the "narrative of the Doctrine was
its cloak--the simple look only at

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

the garment." Clement of Alexandria wrote, "The mysteries of the Faith
are not to be divulged to all.--It is requisite to hide in a mystery the
wisdom spoken." Even Augustine admitted that what "is now called the
Christian religion really was known to the ancients." Druidism may,
therefore, have had its secrets.

It is well to recollect, as Professor Rhys points out, that "what may
seem to one generation of men a mere matter of mythology, is frequently
found to have belonged to the serious theology of a previous one;" and
that "early man is not beneath contempt, especially when he proves to
have had within him the makings of a great race, with its highest
notions of duty and right."

No one can deny that Wales--somehow or other, at a certain period,
assuredly long after the establishment of Christianity in these Islands,
and suspected by many, from philological investigations, to have been
about the twelfth century--received a flood of mystical learning,
conveyed in Welsh *Triads* of great beauty, but great obscurity. This
mystical learning, conveyed in a Christian guise, is asserted to be a
re-statement, in refined symbolism, of those ancient creeds, and
associated with ideas drawn from megalithic monuments, as cromlechs and
circles.

The Irish literature of the same period in the Middle Ages, though less
tinctured than the Welsh with the Medieval mysticism, is not without a
trace of it. England, judging from the sudden admixture of religious
symbols, previously unknown in the Churches of that same era, was
likewise affected. French literature shares the same suspicion, Brittany
in particular, and especially in connection with the myths of Arthur,
and the Quest of the Holy Grail. Morien is right in placing this French
development of Pagan mysticism alongside that of his Welsh.

The Early Lives of St. Patrick, containing many foolish

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

stories of Druids, of raising the dead, and striking dead the opponents
of the Saint, have no reference to this Oriental mysticism; but the
latter appears in later Lives of the Irish and Welsh Saints.

Whence came this occultism into the Church?

The introduction of it may be largely attributed to the Templars. They
were accused of magic, and lost everything thereby. As students, not
less than fighting monks, they learned much of Oriental mysticism, and
may have been a prominent means of introducing ancient heresies into
Britain and France. Their destruction from the orthodox point of view
was justified. No one can look at that symbol in the roof of London
Temple Church, and on English Church banners elsewhere, without
recognizing the heathenism so conspicuous in Welsh Druidism.

But why this Eastern philosophy should find a special retreat in the
Triads of mediæval Wales is by no means clear. It is, however, a
singular fact that the introduction of this mysticism appeared almost
simultaneously in the *Sufuism* of Persian Mahometanism, as exhibited in
the poems of Hafiz, Sadi, &c., and is still to be found in the sect of
the Dancing Dervishes. Did it reach Wales through Spain and France?
There is little or no evidence of Gnosticism--so full of more ancient
and pagan symbolism--penetrating to the British Isles; though the later
development of the Middle Ages abounded in Gnostic ideas.

As this peculiarity would appear to have entered Wales in the early
Norman period, during the Crusades, why was it not evidenced in Ireland?
Did the Norman conquerors, who became more Irishy than the Irish, from
their devotion to the Irish Brehon law, which gave chiefs so much power
and property, decline to patronize therein the new learning?

The Irish King of Ulster, Mongân, recollected his first life as *Find*,
though two centuries before. Tuan was twice

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

born as a man. "The idea," says Jubainville, "that a soul could in this
world re-clothe successively several different physical forms, was a
natural consequence of a Celtic doctrine well known in antiquity. This
doctrine is that the deceased who have left in the tomb their body
deprived of life, find in exchange a living body in the mysterious
country which they go to inhabit, under the bewitching sceptre of the
powerful King of the Dead."

That there has been an esoteric learning in the Past, which has come
down to us in the form of Christian and Masonic Symbolism, is now by
many accepted as a truth. The Mason's Tools must have been used once,
though now merely badges of the worthy Craft. We may, therefore, be
excused citing a remarkable letter, reproduced in Melville's costly
work, *Veritas*, professedly dealing with the esoteric laws of the Medes
and Persians, which cannot alter. The letter is signed by Mr. Henry
Melville, and by Mr. Frederick Tennyson, brother of the late Lord
Tennyson, and is addressed as follows:--

"TO THE MOST WORSHIPFUL THE GRAND MASTER OF IRELAND,

HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF LEINSTER:

"The Petition of the Undersigned,

"Humbly Sheweth--

"That we, Master Masons, are in possession of the knowledge of the 'Lost
Secrets of Masonry.' We can prove that the Mysteries were Masonic,
inasmuch as by the usage of the Symbols now unwittingly worn by
Companions and Masters, Celestial Laws are framed in accordance with the
Sacred Writings, and by these Laws are obtained the true interpretation
of the Lost Mysteries.

"That in former ages the learned rulers retained the Masonic mysteries
for the use and benefit of the Craft, and these Mysteries were not to be
divulged under a lesser penalty than Death. Such mystic secresy might
have been advisable and requisite in ages past, but such retention of
knowledge your Petitioners verily believe to be no longer necessary, as
the advancement of truth is now the policy of the civilized world, more
especially so of the British nation.

"Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray, Most Worshipful Sir,

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

that you will be pleased to order a Commission of learned and
intelligent Brethren to be appointed to inquire and decide--

"1st--Whether the knowledge we profess was in former times considered
Masonic.

"2nd--Whether the Lost Mysteries were, and consequently still are,
celestial truths.

"3rd--Whether truth should be published to mankind under the sanction of
the Grand Lodge, provided always that these Lost truths interfere not
with the Mysteries and Ritual of Modern Masonry.

"And, lastly, whether, under all considerations, the Grand Lodge of
Ireland will assist, fraternally, the dissemination of the recovered
truths, which will enlighten the most enlightened Chiefs' of this
present generation.

(*Signed*) HENRY MELVILLE,  
FREDERICK TENNYSON."

We were acquainted with Mr. Melville in Tasmania some fifty years ago,
when he had been long engaged in an investigation of ancient learning,
and had even then come to the conclusion that heathen mythology was but
a disguise, concealing scientific truths.

Occultism, in these modern days, as in Madame Blavatsky's *Theosophy*,
or Morien's *Light of Britannia*, attempts to explain, even to the
vulgar many, the secret mysteries supposed to have been cherished by the
IRISH DRUIDS.
