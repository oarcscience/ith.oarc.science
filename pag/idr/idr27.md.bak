### WELL-WORSHIP

THAT so wet a country as Ireland should have so great a reverence for
wells, is an evidence how early the primitive

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

and composite races there came under the moral influence of oriental
visitors and rulers, who had known in their native lands the want of
rain, the value of wells. So deep was this respect, that by some the
Irish were known as the *People of Wells*.

In remote ages and realms, worship has been celebrated at fountains or
wells. They were dedicated to *Soim* in India. Sopar-soma was the
fountain of knowledge. Oracles were delivered there. But there were
Cursing as well as Blessing wells.

Wells were feminine, and the feminine principle was the object of
adoration there, though the specific form thereof changed with the times
and the faith. In Christian lands they were dedicated, naturally enough,
to the Virgin Mary. It is, however, odd to find a change adopted in some
instances after the Reformation. Thus, according to a clerical writer in
the *Graphic*, 1875, a noted Derbyshire well had its annual festival on
Ascension Day, when the place was adorned with crosses, *poles*, and
arches. All was religiously done in honour of the Trinity, the vicar
presiding. Catholic localities still prefer to decorate holy wells on
our Lady's Assumption Day.

It was in vain that the Early Church, the Medieval Church, and even the
Protestant Church, sought to put down well-worship, the inheritance of
extreme antiquity. Strenuous efforts were made by Councils. That of
Rouen in the seventh century declared that offerings made, there in the
form of flowers, branches, rags, &c., were sacrifices to the devil.
Charlemagne issued in 789 his decree against it--as did our Edgar and
Canute.

As Scotland caught the infection by contact with Ireland, it was needful
for the Presbyterian Church to restrain the folly. This was done by the
Presbytery of Dingwall in 1656, though even worse practices were then
condemned;

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

as, the adoration of stones, the pouring of milk on hills, and the
sacrifice of bulls. In 1628 the Assembly, prohibiting visits to Christ's
well at Falkirk on May mornings, got a law passed sentencing offenders
to a fine of twenty pounds Scot, and the exhibition in sackcloth for
three Sundays in church. Another act put the offenders in prison for a
week on bread and water.

Mahomet even could not hinder the sanctity attached to the well Zamzam
at Mecca. More ancient still was holy Beersheba, the *seven wells*.

Wales, especially North Wales, so long and intimately associated with
Ireland, had many holy wells, as St Thecla's at Llandegla, and St
Winifrede's of Flintshire Holywell. St Madron's well was useful in
testing the loyalty of lovers. St. Breward's well cured bad eyes, and
received offerings in cash and pins. St Cleer's was good for nervous
ailments, and benefited the insane. The Druid magician Tregeagle is said
still to haunt Dozmare Pool. Henwen is the Old Lady Well. The Hindoo
Vedas proclaim that "all healing power is in the waters"

Hydromancy, or divination by the appearance of water in a well, is
cherished to the present time. One Christian prayer runs thus:--

"'Water, water, tell me truly,  
Is the man that I love duly,  
On the earth, or under the sod,  
Sick or well--in the name of God."

Irish wells have been re-baptized, and therefore retain their sanctity.
A stout resistance to their claims seems to have been made awhile by the
early missionaries, since Columba exorcised a demon from a well
possessed by it. They all, however, liked to resort to wells for their
preaching stations. In one of the Lives of St. Patrick, it

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

is related that "he preached at a fountain (well) which the Druids
worshipped as a God."

Milligan assures us, "The Celtic tribes, starting from hot countries,
where wells were always of the utmost value, still continued that
reverence for them which had been handed down in their traditions." This
opinion may be controverted by ethnologists. But Croker correctly
declares that even now in Ireland, "near these wells little altars or
shrines are frequently constructed, often in the rudest manner, and
kneeling before them, the Irish peasant is seen offering up his
prayers."

It is not a little singular that these unconfined Irish churches should
be in contiguity with Holy Oaks or Holy Stones. Prof. Harttung, in his
Paper before the Historical Society, remarked of the Irish--"They have
from time immemorial been inclined to superstition." He even believed in
their ancient practice of human sacrifices.

Pilgrimages to wells are frequent to this day. The times are fixed for
them; as the first of February, in honour of Tober Brigid, or St.
Bridget's well, of Sligo. The bushes are draped with offerings, and the
procession must move round as the sun moves, like the heathen did at the
same spot so long ago. At Tober Choneill, or St. Connell's well, the
correct thing is to kneel, then wish for a favour, drink the water in
silence, and quietly retire, never telling the wish, if desiring its
fulfilment.

Unfortunately, these pilgrimages--often to wild localities--are attended
with characteristic devotion to whisky and free fights. At the Holy
Well, Tibber, or Tober, Quan, the water is first soberly drunk on the
knees. But when the whisky, in due course, follows, the talking,
Singing, laughing, and love-making may be succeeded by a liberal use of
the blackthorn.

In the story of the *Well of Kilmore* is an allusion to

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

mystical fishes. An old writer says, "They do call the said fishes *Easa
Seant*, that is to say, holie fishes." In the charming poem of
*Diarmuid*, there is an account of the Knight of the Fountain, and the
sacred silver cup from which the pilgrim drank.

Giraldus, the Welsh Seer, beheld a man washing part of his head in the
pool at the top of Slieve Gullion, in Ireland, when the part immediately
turned grey, the hair having, been black before. The opposite effect
would be a virtue.

Prof. Robertson Smith, while admitting Well-worship as occurring with
the most primitive of peoples, finds it connected with agriculture, when
the aborigines had no better, knowledge of a God. The source of a
spring, said he, "is honoured as a Divine Being, I had almost said a
divine animal." "Such springs," remarks Rhys, "have in later times been
treated as Holy Wells."

River-worship, as is well known, has been nearly universal among rude
peoples, and human sacrifices not uncommonly followed. The river god of
Esthonia some times appeared to the villagers as a little man with blue
and-white stockings. Streams, like wells, are under care of local
deities. Even our river Severn was ado in the time of the Roman
occupation, as we know by Latin inscriptions.

Wells varied in curative powers. St. Tegla's was good for epilepsy.
Rickety children benefit from a thrice dipping. Some, by the motion of
the waters when something is thrown in, will indicate the coming
direction wind. Some will cure blindness, like that at Rathlogan while
others will cause it, except to some favoured mortals.

Offerings must be made to the spirit in charge of well, and to the
priestess acting as guardian. If in any, way connected with the person,
so much the better. A piece of a garment, money touched by the hand, or
even

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

a pin from clothes, is sufficient. Pins should be dropped on a Saint's
day, if good luck be sought. As Henderson's *Folklore* remarks, "The
country girls imagine that the well is in charge of a fairy, or spirit,
who must be propitiated by some offering." Some well-spirits, as Peg
O'Nell of the Ribble, can be more than mischievous. Besides the dropping
of metal, or the slaughter of fowls, a cure requires perambulation,
sunwise, three times round the well. On Saints' day wells are often
dressed with flowers.

Otway has asserted that "no religious place in Ireland can be without a
holy well." But Irish wells are not the only ones favoured with presents
of pins and rags, for Scotland, as well as Cornwall and other parts of
England, retain the custom. Mason names some rag-wells:---Ardclines of
Antrim, Erregall-Keroge of Tyrone, Dungiven, St. Bartholomew of
Waterford, St. Brigid of Sligo.

The spirits of the wells may appear as frogs or fish. Gomme, who has
written so well on this subject, refers to a couple of trout, from time
immemorial, in the Tober or well Kieran, Meath. Of two enchanted trout
in the Galway Pigeon Hole, one was captured. As it immediately got free
from the magic, turning into a beautiful young lady, the fisher, in
fright, pitched it back into the well. Other trout-protected wells are
recorded. Salmon and eels look after Tober Monachan, the Kerry well of
Ballymorereigh. Two black fish take care of Kilmore well. That at
Kirkmichael of Banff has only a fly in charge.

"The point of the legend is," writes Robertson Smith, "that the sacred
source is either inhabited by a demoniac being, or imbued with demoniac
life." It is useful, in the event of a storm near the coast, to let off
the water from a well into the sea. This draining off was the practice
of the Islanders of Inn is Murray. The Arran Islanders derive much
comfort from casting into wells flint-heads used by

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

their forefathers in war. Innis Rea has a holy well near the Atlantic.

What was the age of Well-worship? The President of the Folklore Society,
who deems the original worshippers Non-Aryan, *i.e.* before Celts came
to Ireland, identifies the custom with the erection of stone circles.
The scientific anthropologist, General Pitt-Rivers, tells us, "It is
impossible to believe that so singular a custom as this, invariably
associated with cairns, megalithic monuments, holy wells, or some such
early Pagan institutions, could have arisen independently in all these
countries."

Enough has been said to show, as Wood-Martin observes, that
"Water-worship, recommended by Seneca, tolerated by the Church in times
of yore, is a cult not yet gone out." But one has written, "The
printer's blanket somehow smothers miracles, and small pica plays the
very mischief with sanctified wells."
