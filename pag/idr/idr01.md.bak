# PREFACE

IRELAND, whether viewed from an antiquarian or an ethnological point of
view, is one of the most interesting countries in the world. It is not
the less an object of attention from the fact, that in its early history
there are traces of nearly every kind of pagan belief.

It is curious that its literary treasures should have been so long
neglected. Of late years, thanks to literary and scientific societies,
including the new association fostered by Sir C. Gavan Duffy, Irish MSS.
have engaged much thoughtful investigation.

The author of this work, conscious of the importance of inquiry into
ancient faiths, has collected such information upon Irish religions as a
lengthened course of general reading has thrown in his way, since it may
benefit those who have less leisure or opportunity for research. He is
content to state various views, presented in quotations from writers,
rather than to put forth any special conjectures of his own.
Examinations of old myths and folklore will often throw light upon
current notions of nationalities.

This sketch of the ancient Irish mind might help to confirm the
conviction that Religion, in the sense of a reverence for something
beyond the individual, has been

ever associated with human nature. Anything, however apparently absurd
to some of us, that tends to restrain vice, and exalt virtue, is not to
be despised in the development of our race. The heathen Irish had a
worshipful spirit. As to their morals, they certainly honoured woman
more than did the favoured Jews or accomplished Greeks.

The Druids, forming one subject of this publication, are still an enigma
to us. They were, doubtless, neither so grandly wise, nor so low in
reputation, as represented by tradition. Their ethical lessons must have
assuredly prepared the way for Christian missions.

However open to criticism in literary merit, the book claims some kindly
consideration, as coming from one who, in his seventy-seventh year,
retains a confiding hope in the march of human intellect, and the growth
of human brotherhood.
