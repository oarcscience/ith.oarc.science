### *WHAT DROVE the MIDDLE AGES to DESPAIR*

"BE YE like unto new-born babes" (*quasi modo geniti infantes*); be
little children for innocence of heart, and peacefulness and
forgetfulness of all causes of offence, calm and serene, under the hand
of Jesus.

Such is the sweet counsel the Church gives this stormy world on the
morrow of the great catastrophe. In other words: "Volcanoes, scoriæ,
ashes, lava, grow green and lush with grass. Fields burned up with fire,
come, carpet yourselves with flowers."

One circumstance, it is true, then was promised the peace that
revivifies,—all the schools were ended, the path of logic abandoned and
deserted. A method of infinite simplicity rendered all discussion
futile, and set before the feet of all the easy downward road they must
needs follow henceforth. If the *Credo* was of doubtful interpretation,
still life was all traced out plainly enough in the track of legend. The
first word, and the last, was the same,—*Imitation*.

"*Imitate*, and all will be well; only repeat and copy." Yes! but is
this really and truly the way of genuine *infancy*, the infancy that
vivifies the heart of man, makes him find new sources of refreshment and
fertility? To begin with, I can see in this world that moulds childhood
and infancy only attributes of senility, over-refinement, servility,
impotence. What is this literature compared with the sublime monuments
of Greeks and Jews? even compared with the Roman genius? We find
precisely the same literary decline that befell in India, from
Brahminism to Buddhism; a garrulous verbiage succeeding to lofty
inspiration.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> One book
plagiarises another, till presently they cannot even copy correctly.
They rob one from the other, and the marbles of Ravenna are torn down to
adorn Aix-la-Chapelle. The whole fabric of society is of a piece; the
bishop who is lord of a city, the barbarian prince of a half-savage
tribe, model themselves on the Roman magistrature. Our monks we think so
original, are only repeating in their monastery the *villa* of an
earlier day, as Chateaubriand well observes. They have no notion of
fashioning a new society, any more than of refertilising the old. Mere
imitators of the Eastern monks, they would fain have had their
dependants poor monkish taskmen, a sterile population of celibate lay
brothers. It was in their despite family life renewed itself, and so
renewed the world.

When we observe how quickly these old monks are ageing, how in a single
century the level drops from the wise monk St. Benedict to the pedant
Benedict of Ariane, we clearly realise that these gentry were purely and
entirely innocent of the grand popular creation that grew up about the
ruins; I refer to the Lives of the Saints. The monks wrote them, but it
was the people made them. This young vegetation may throw its luxuriance
of leaf and blossom over the crumbling walls of the old Roman building
converted into a monastery, but it does not grow out of it, we may be
very sure. It has roots deep in the soil; the people sowed it there, the
family worked the ground, all took a hand in its production—men, women,
and children. The precarious, restless life of those times of violence
made these poor countryfolk imaginative, ready to put faith in their own
dreams that consoled them in their misery,—wild dreams, teeming with
wonders and full of absurdities, equally ludicrous and delightful.

These families, living isolated in the woods or on the mountains (as men
live still in the Tyrol and the High Alps), coming down to the plains
but one day in the week, were filled with the hallucinations their
loneliness encouraged. A child had seen this, a woman had dreamed that.
A brand-new Saint arose in the district; his story ran through the
countryside, like a ballad, in

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

rough-and-ready rhyme. It was sung and danced at evening under the oak
by the fountain. The priest who came on Sunday to say Mass in the forest
chapel found the legendary song in every mouth already. Then he said to
himself: "Well! after all, the tale is a beautiful one and an edifying;
. . . it does honour to the Church. *Vox populi, vox Dei!* . . . But
however did they come across it?" Then would they show him authentic
witnesses, of unimpeachable veracity,—the tree, the rock, that saw the
apparition, the miracle. What more could be said after that?

Reported at the Abbey, the legend will soon find a monk, *good for
nothing better*, whose only craft is the pen, both curious and
credulous, ready to believe anything and everything miraculous. He
writes it all out, embroiders the simple tale with his vapid rhetoric,
spoils it somewhat. But at any rate here it is duly recorded and
recognised, read in refectory, and before long in church. Recopied,
loaded, overloaded with embellishments, often grotesque embellishments,
it will descend from age to age, till at last it takes honourable rank
and place in the *Golden Legend*.

 

Even to-day, when we read these beautiful tales, when we listen to the
simple, artless, solemn melodies into which these rustic populations put
all their young enthusiasm, we cannot but recognise a very real
inspiration, and bewail the irony of fate when we think what was to be
their eventual lot.

These people had taken literally the Church's touching appeal: "Be ye as
little children." But they applied it to the very thing least dreamed in
the original conception. The more Christianity had feared and abhorred
Nature, the more these folk loved her and held her good and
harmless,—even sanctified her, giving her a part to play in the legend.

The animals which the Bible so harshly calls *hairy beasts*, and which
the monk mistrusts, fearing to find demons incarnated in them, come into
these charming tales in the most touching way, as, for instance, the
hind that warms and comforts Geneviève de Brabant.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

Even apart from the life of legends, in everyday existence, these humble
fireside friends, these gallant helpers in the day's work, gain a higher
place in men's esteem. They have their proper rights, <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) and their proper estate. If in God's
infinite goodness there is room for the lowliest, if He ever seems to
have a preference for such out of pity, why should not my ass be allowed
in church? He has his defects, no doubt,—which makes him only the more
like me. He is a sturdy fellow to work, but thickskulled; he is
intractable and obstinate, in one word, he is my very counterpart.

Hence those grand festivals, the most beautiful of the Middle Ages, of
the *Innocents*, of *Fools*, of the *Ass*. It is the very people of that
day which in the ass presents its own likeness in person before the
altar, ugly, ludicrous, and down-trodden! Truly a touching sight! Led by
Balaam, he enters solemnly between the Sibyl and Virgil, <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) enters to bear witness. If of old he kicked
against Balaam, this was because he saw flashing before him the sword of
the old Law. But here the Law is abrogated and done with, and the world
of Grace seems to open wide its doors to receive the lowliest, the
simple ones of the earth. The people believes it all in the innocency of
its heart. Hence the sublime canticle, in which it addressed the ass, as
it might have addressed itself:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A genoux, et dis *Amen!*  
Assez mangé d'herbe et de foin!  
Laisse les vieilles choses, et va! <span id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_8.md)

</div>

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Le neuf emporte le vieux!  
La vérité fait fuir l’ombre!  
La lumière chasse la nuit!  <span id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9.md)

</div>

What insolence and wrong-headedness! Is *this* what they required of
you, disobedient, unruly children, when they told you to be as little
children? They offered you milk; you drink strong wine instead. They
would lead you gently, bridle in hand, by the narrow way. Gentle, timid
creatures, you seemed afraid to put one foot before another. Then
behold! of a sudden the bridle is broken . . . one leap, and you swap
over the course.

Ah! how unwise it was to let you invent your saints, and raise your
altar, then bedeck and load and bury it in flowers, till its original
form is all but indistinguishable. What *can* be discerned is the old
heresy, long ago condemned by the Church, the *innocence of Nature*. An
old heresy do I say? Nay! rather a new heresy that will live many a long
day yet,—the *emancipation of mankind*.

Now listen and obey:

It is expressly forbidden to invent, to create. No more originality; no
more legends; no more new saints. There are enough already. Forbidden to
innovate in the forms of worship with new melodies; inspiration is
prohibited. Any martyrs that should come to light are to keep quiet in
their graves, and wait with becoming humility till the Church recognises
them. Forbidden for clergy or monks to confer on peasants the tonsure
that enfranchises them. Such the narrow, timid spirit of the
Carlovingian Church, <span id="fr_10"></span>[4](#fn_10.md) which
deliberately contradicts herself, gives herself the lie, now says to
little children, "Be ye old men!"

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

What a change is here! But can it be meant seriously? Did they not tell
us to be young? Nay! the priest is no longer [identical](errata.htm#1.md)
with the people. A mighty divorce is beginning, an infinite gulf of
separation. Henceforth the priest, a great lord now or a prince, will
sing the Office in a golden cope, using the sovereign tongue of the
great empire that is no more. We, poor cattle of the field, having lost
the language of mankind, the only one God will deign to hear, what can
we do now but low and bleat, in company with the innocent companion that
never scorns us, that in wintertime warms us in the stall and covers us
with his fleece? We will live with the dumb beasts, and be dumb
ourselves.

In very truth, we have then the less need to go to Church. But she will
not let us off; she orders us back, to listen to words we cannot
understand.

From that day forth a monstrous fog, a heavy, grey, leaden fog, enwraps
the world. Say, for how long? for a thousand long, dreary, terrible
years! For ten whole centuries, a languor no previous age has known
oppressed the Middle Ages, even to some extent later times, in a
condition midway between sleep and waking, under the empire of a dismal,
an intolerable phenomenon,—that convulsion of supreme boredom we call a
yawn.

The indefatigable church bell rings out the accustomed hours,—and folks
yawn; a nasal chant drones on in antiquated Latin,—and folks yawn.
Everything is foreseen; no room is left for hope in all the world. Day
after day events will recur in [identically](errata.htm#2.md) the same way.
The inevitable oppression of to-morrow makes men yawn before to-day is
done, and the never-ending perspective of days, and years, of weary
sameness still to come, weighs on the spirits beforehand and sickens of
life. From brain to stomach, from stomach to mouth, the automatic, the
fatally irresistible, convulsion travels, distending the jaws in an
endless and cureless gape. A veritable disease, which pious Bretons
openly avow, imputing it, it is true, to the Devil's machinations. He
lies crouching in the woods, say the Breton peasants; to the herdsman as
he passes with his beasts, he sings Vespers and all

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

the other Offices, and sets him yawning, yawning till he is like to
die. <span id="fr_11"></span>[5](#fn_11.md)

 

*To be old* is to be feeble. When the Saracens, when the North-men,
threaten us, what will be our fate, if the people is still old and
decrepit? Charlemagne weeps unavailing tears, and the Church with him,
confessing that the holy relics, against these barbarian demons, can no
longer protect the altars. <span id="fr_12"></span>[6](#fn_12.md) Were it
not well to appeal to the arm of the intractable child they were going
to bind, the arm of the young giant they were fain to paralyse? A
self-contradictory movement marks the ninth century throughout,—at one
time the people is held back, at another pushed forward, at one time
feared, at another appealed to for help. With the people's aid, by the
people's hands, barriers are thrown up, shelters contrived, to stop the
barbarian invaders, to protect the priests, and the saints, escaped from
their churches.

Despite the Bald Emperor's prohibition, a castle-keep rises on the
mountain height. There the fugitive arrives, "Take me in, in God's
name,—at any rate my wife and children. I will camp with my bestial in
your outer bailey." The castle restores his courage and he feels himself
a man at last. It shelters him; he defends it, and so protects his
protector.

In earlier days the poor, under stress of famine, surrendered themselves
to the rich and powerful as serfs. Now it is very different; he gives
himself as *vassal*, that is to say, brave and valiant champion. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[7](#fn_13.md)

He gives himself, yet remains his own man, keeping the right to renounce
his allegiance. "I am for higher things; the world is

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

wide. I too, as well as another, may raise my castle on the steep. . . .
I have defended the outside; I shall know how to guard my head in the
inside."

Here we have the grand, noble origin of the Feudal world. The man of the
keep received his vassals, but said to them, "You shall leave me when
you will, and I will even help you to do it, if needful; so far, indeed,
that if you are mired, I will get down off my horse myself to succour
you." This is the ancient formula word for word. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[8](#fn_14.md)

 

But one morning what is this I see? Do my eyes deceive me? The Lord of
the Valley sallies forth to raid the lands round about, sets up
landmarks none may overpass, and even invisible lines of demarcation.
"What is it? What does it mean?" . . . It means that the Lordship is
enclosed: "The Feudal Lord, under lock and key, holds all immured,
between sky and earth."

Alas! alas! By virtue of what right is the *vassus* (the valiant man,
that is) henceforth to be a prisoner? Nay! *vassus*, they will maintain,
may equally be equivalent to *slave*.

In the same way *servus*, meaning *servant* (often a high-born servant,
a Count or Prince of the Empire), will signify for the weak and lowly, a
*serf*, a villein whose life is valued at a denier.

This is the hateful net they are taken in. But yonder on his plot of
ground is one who maintains his land is free, an *allod* (*allodium*,
*aleu*), a "fief of the sun." He sits on his boundary-stone, crushes his
hat down firm on his head, and watches the Feudal Lord, the Emperor
himself, pass by. <span id="fr_15"></span>[9](#fn_15.md)

"Go your ways, ride on, Emperor, you sit tight in your saddle, and I on
my boundary-stone yet tighter. You pass, but I remain. . . . For I am
Freedom."

But . . . I have not the heart to tell the man's eventual fate. The air
thickens round him, and his breath fails more and more. He seems
bewitched. He cannot move, he is as if paralysed. His

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

beasts too grow thinner and thinner, as though a spell were on them. His
servants die of hunger. His land is fallen barren. He is hag-ridden o’
nights.

Still he holds on; he says, "A poor man's house is his castle."

But they will not leave him alone. He is cited, and must answer, to the
Imperial Court. He repairs thither, a survival from a vanished world, a
spectre of the past, a thing unrecognisable. "What is it?" the younger
men ask each other. "He is neither Seigneur nor serf! Why, then, what is
he? He is nothing."

"'Who am I?' ask you? I am he who built the first castle-keep, and
defended it in your behoof; he who, leaving its walls, strode bravely to
the bridge to meet the heathen Northmen. . . . More than that, I dammed
the river, I reclaimed the alluvial waste, I created the very soil, like
God who made 'the dry land appear.' . . . This soil, who shall drive me
off it?"

"Nay, my friend," answered his neighbour, "you shall not be driven off
it. You shall cultivate it still, this soil . . . only on other
conditions from what you think. . . . Remember, good friend, how in the
heedlessness of youth (it is fifty years agone now) you wedded
Jacqueline, a little maid of my father's serfs. . . . Remember the
maxim: 'Who treads my hen, is my cock.' You belong to my hen-roost.
Come, off belt and away sword! . . . Henceforth you are my serf."

There is no invention here; it is all bare truth. The atrocious story
recurs over and over again in the Middle Ages. And what a bitter weapon
of tyranny it was! I have abridged and omitted much, for every time one
returns to these incidents, the same sharp point of pity and indignation
pierces the heart.

One there was who, under so dire an outrage, fell into such a passion of
fury he could find never a word to say. ’Twas like Roland betrayed at
Roncesvaux. All the blood of his body rose to his throat and choked him.
. . . His eyes flashed fire, his poor dumb mouth, dumb but so fiercely
eloquent, turned all the assemblage pale. . . . They shrank back in
terror. . . . He was

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

dead. His veins had burst. . . . His arteries shot the red blood into
the very faces of his murderers. <span id="fr_16"></span>[10](#fn_16.md)

 

This instability of condition and tenure, this horrid, shelving
declivity, down which a man slips from free man to *vassal*,—from vassal
to *servant*,—from servant to *serf*, is the great terror of the Middle
Ages, the basis of its despair. There is no way of escape; one step, and
the man is lost. He is an *alien*, a *waif and stray*, a head of *wild
game;* serfdom or death, these are the only alternatives. The heavy soil
clogs the feet, and entangles and engulfs the passer-by in its miry
depths. The poisoned air kills him, lays its *dead hand* on him, turns
him into a dead man, a nonentity, a brute beast, a life priced at ten
farthings,—a life anyone may take and expiate the murder for ten
farthings down. Such were the two main, external features of Mediæval
wretchedness, the two great hardships that drove men to give themselves
to Satan. Now to look at the internal aspect, to examine the foundations
of life and character, and sound the depths of human existence, at the
same unhappy period.
