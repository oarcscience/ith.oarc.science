### *BLACK MASS Continued LOVE and DEATH SATAN DISAPPEARS*

THE people is enfranchised and emboldened. The poor serf, free for once,
is king for a few hours’ space. But his time is short; already the night
is passing, the stars verging to their setting. Very soon the cruel dawn
will send him back to slavery, set him once more, under the malignant
eye of his taskmaster, under the shadow of his lord's castle and that of
the Church, to the monotonous labour, the everlasting weary round
regulated by the two bells, whereof the one says *Ever* and the other
says *Never*. Each peasant among them, with glum, submissive looks and
an air of jog-trot habit, will be seen sallying forth to his day's work.

At least let them enjoy their momentary respite! Let each one of earth's
disinherited sons be fully happy for once, and find his utmost dreams
fulfilled! . . . What heart so miserable, so dead and withered, as not
to have some day-dreams, some wild aspirations,—to say sometimes, "Ah!
if only such or such a thing could happen"?

 

The only detailed descriptions we possess are comparatively modern, as I
have already mentioned, dating from a period of peace and prosperity,
viz. the last years of the reign of Henri IV. when France was once more
flourishing. These were years of luxury and plenty, altogether different
from the black days when the Witches’ Sabbath was first organised.

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

If we were to trust implicitly to M. Lancre and his fellows, we should
picture this Third Act to our mind's eye as a sort of Rubens’ kermesse,
a wild, confused orgy, a vast masked ball, giving licence to every sort
of illicit intercourse, and particularly to incest between closely
connected relatives. According to these authors, whose only wish is to
inspire horror and make their readers shudder, the chief end of the
whole festival, its main lesson and express doctrine, was incest; they
would have us believe that at these huge gatherings (sometimes as many
as twelve thousand souls were present) the most monstrous acts were
openly committed before the assembled spectators.

This is hard to believe. The very same writers tell us other facts which
seem diametrically opposed to such cynicism. They say the folk only came
there in couples, that they only sat at the feast two by two, that
supposing an individual arrived unaccompanied, a young demon was
actually told off on purpose to shepherd the lonely visitor and do the
honours of the festival. They inform us that jealous lovers were not
afraid to attend and bring with them their fair companions, curious to
see the strange sight.

Again we have seen how the great majority attended by families, their
children accompanying them. These they sent away only for the First Act,
not for the banquet or the religious (or rather anti-religious)
ceremonial, and not even for the Third Act here in question. This proves
the existence of a certain degree of decency. Besides, the performance
was twofold. The family groups remained on the brilliantly lighted
heath. It was only beyond the fantastic curtain of pitchy smoke clouds
that a darkling outer region began, to which those who wished could slip
away.

Judges and inquisitors, bitterly hostile as these were are forced to
admit that a noble spirit of gentleness and peace prevailed generally.
Of the three things that shocked decorum so much at the feasts of the
nobles nothing was found here. No brawling, no duels, no tables stained
with blood. No vile treachery

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

in the name of gallantry to outrage the brother in arms. Lastly, the
foul promiscuity of the Templars, for all that has been said to the
contrary, was unknown, indeed unneeded; at the Sabbath woman was
everything.

With regard to incest, we must distinguish. Then every connexion with
relations, even such as are held the most legitimate in our days, was
reckoned a crime. Modern law, which is charity personified, understands
the human heart and the good of families. It permits the widower to
marry his wife's sister,—in other words, to give his children the best
and kindest of new mothers. It permits the uncle to afford his niece
necessary protection by making her his wife. Above all, it permits
marriage with a female cousin, a trusty and familiar bride, often the
object of affection since childhood, companion of youthful sport, and an
acceptable daughter-in-law to the mother, who has long ago taken her to
her heart. In the Middle Ages all this was incest!

The peasant, whose affections never go beyond his own family circle, was
driven to sheer desperation. In the sixth degree even, it would have
been held monstrous to wed his cousin. Impossible to marry in his own
village, where the ties of relationship imposed so many barriers; he was
bound to look elsewhere, further away. But in those days
intercommunication was of the slightest, mutual knowledge non-existent,
and neighbours cordially detested. Different villages, on fête days,
would fight each other without a notion why they did so,—as is the case
to this hour in countries ever so little removed from each other. A man
would hardly dare to go look for a wife at the very spot where the
battle had occurred, and the peril of wounds and death confronted.

Another difficulty. The feudal lord of a young serf would not allow him,
if he wished, to marry in the fief of a neighbouring baron. He would
have become the serf of the wife's over-lord, and so been lost to his
own.

Thus while *the priest barred the cousin, the feudal forbade the
stranger;* and so many men never married at all.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

The result was precisely what they most wished to guard against. At the
Witches’ Sabbath the natural affections had their way in double force.
There the young man encountered once more the girl he knew and loved
already, who when he was a lad of ten had been called his *little wife*.
Be sure he liked her best, and treated the canonical objections with
supreme indifference.

A thorough study of mediæval family life throws entire discredit on all
those rhetorical declamations we hear about a wide general promiscuity
affecting crowds of human beings. The exact opposite is perceived to be
the case,—that each separate little group, constituted on the narrowest
basis and in the most concentrated form, is to the last degree averse to
admit any foreign element whatever.

The serf, anything but jealous—towards his own kinsfolk, but miserably
poor and wretched in his circumstances, is excessively apprehensive of
worsening his lot yet further by multiplying a long family he cannot
possibly feed. The priest and the baron both would have him augment the
number of their serfs, would like to see his wife everlastingly with
child; and the strangest sermons were preached on this subject, <span
id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md)—occasionally savage recriminations and
murderous threats indulged in. All this only made the husband more
obstinate in his precautions. As for the wife, who poor creature could
never hope to rear children under such conditions, and found only cause
for tears in their arrival, she dreaded nothing so much as pregnancy.
She only ventured to attend the nocturnal festival on the express
assurance repeated again and again that "no woman ever returned
therefrom heavier than she came." <span id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50.md)

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

They came no doubt, but drawn to the ceremony by the banquet, the dance,
the gay lights, and the love of amusement; in no way by the incitements
of the flesh. Some indeed found only pain and suffering there; while
others abhorred the icy purification that followed instantly on the act
of love to nullify its effects. No matter; they were ready to undergo
anything rather than increase their poverty, bring another unfortunate
into the world, give the over-lord another serf.

Strong was the common determination, trusty the mutual agreement that
limited love to the family and excluded the stranger from all
participation. No reliance was felt but in kinsfolk united in the same
serfdom, who, sharing the same burdens, were duly careful not to
increase these.

Hence no general movement of population, no mixing and mingling
confusedly of divers elements; but, on the contrary, only a series of
narrow and mutually exclusive family groups. This very fact was bound to
render the Witches’ Sabbath powerless as an instrument of revolt,
ineffectual as a means of stirring and combining the masses. The family,
careful above all things to avoid a prolific offspring, secured its
object by strict limitation in matters of love to very near relations,
in other words, to those pledged to the same interest. A sad,
depressing, unhallowed state of things, darkening and degrading the
sweetest moments of life. Alas, alas! even in love and marriage all was
mere squalid wretchedness and revolt against untoward circumstance.

 

Society was very cruel. Authority kept on saying, "Marry"; but it made
marriage next door to impossible, as well by excess of abject poverty as
by the senseless rigour of canonical prohibitions.

The result was the exact opposite of the purity the Church was for ever
preaching. Under a Christian disguise, the old patriarchal system of
Asia was the only existing reality.

The eldest son only could marry. The younger brothers and

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

the sisters all worked under him and for him. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[3](#fn_51.md) In the isolated mountain farmsteads of the
south, far removed from all intercourse with neighbours or other women,
the brothers lived with their sisters, who were their servants and
belonged to them body and soul,—a state of morals corresponding to that
described in the Book of Genesis, and analogous to the marriage customs
of the Parsees and the usages subsisting to this day among some of the
pastoral tribes of the Himalayas.

What was even more shocking was the lot of the mother of the family. She
found herself unable to marry off her son; she could not unite him with
a kinswoman and so make sure of a daughter-in-law who would have some
consideration and respect for her. Her son would marry, if marry he
could, a girl from a distant village, often a hostile one; then her
arrival was a veritable and terrible invasion, whether to the children
of the first bed or to the poor mother, who often found herself turned
out of doors by the stranger. It will scarce be credited, but there is
no doubt about the fact. At best she was ill treated,—driven
ignominiously from the fireside and the domestic board.

A Swiss law expressly forbids depriving the mother of her place at the
chimney corner.

She dreaded above all things the event of her son's marrying. Yet her
lot was not much more tolerable supposing he did not. She was just as
much an inferior—servant of the young *master of the house*, who
succeeded to all his father's rights, even to that of beating her. I
have myself seen instances at the present day in the south of France of
this horror,—a son of twenty-five chastising his own mother when she got
drunk.

How much more in these ruder times! . . . It was more likely to be the
son that would return from village merrymakings in a condition of
semi-intoxication, scarcely knowing what he was after. Same bedchamber,
same bed—for two was an absolutely unknown luxury. The mother was far
from feeling secure. He

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

had seen his friends married, and the sight had roused his evil
passions. Hence floods of tears, extreme prostration, the most
deplorable self-abandonment. The unhappy woman, thus threatened with
violence by her only god, her son, wounded in her fondest affections,
reduced to such a hideous, unnatural plight, was in despair. She would
try to sleep, to feign unconsciousness. Then there happened, without
either quite realising the enormity, what so often happens to this day
in the poor quarters of great cities, where some poor creature,
constrained by terror or perhaps by blows, submits to the last
indignity. Submissive henceforth, and spite all her scruples, far too
readily resigned, the mother became the victim of a piteous servitude. A
shameful and an agonising, anxious life, for year by year the
discrepancy of age would increase, and more and more tend to separate
them. A woman of thirty-six could still hold the affections of a boy of
twenty; but at fifty, alas! and at a more advanced age still, what then?
From the Great Sabbath, when distant villages met together, he might any
day bring home a strange woman to be the young mistress of the house—an
unfamiliar, hard outsider, without heart or pity, who would rob her of
her son, her fireside, her bed, all the household gods she had got
together by her own labour.

By what Lancre and others tell us, Satan held it a great merit on the
son's part to remain faithful to his mother, made this particular crime
into a virtue. If this is true, we may easily guess the reason how one
woman naturally stood up for another, how the Sorceress was a ready
partisan on the mother's side, to help her hearth against the son's
wife, who, stick in hand, would have turned her out to beg her bread.

Lancre goes further and declares, "never was thoroughpaced Witch yet but
was the child of incest, born of mother and son." The same rule held
good in Persia for the birth of the genuine Mage, who must be the
offspring, so men said, of this odious mystery of iniquity. In this way
the lore of the Wise Men, the magic of the East, was confined to the
narrowest limits,

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

within a family that was renewed perpetually from its own blood.

By an impious misreading of Nature, they believed themselves to be
copying in this hateful ritual the innocent mystery of the rustic year,
the ever-renewed cycle of vegetation growth, whereby the corn, reaped
and again sown in the furrow, comes up once again as corn.

Less monstrous forms of union (of brother and sister), common among the
Jews and Greeks, were unloving and very seldom fruitful. Very wisely
they were abandoned before long, and would never have been resorted to
again, but for the spirit of revolt which, exasperated by ridiculous
prohibitions, drove men recklessly into every extreme most violently
contrasted with use and wont.

In this way unnatural laws, acting on the evil passions, the hate, of
mankind, produced unnatural crimes.

A hard, an accursed time! and the inevitable mother of despair!

 

So far so good,—or rather so bad; but lo! the dawn of a brighter day is
all but come. In a moment, the hour strikes that puts all evil spirits
to flight. The Sorceress feels the gloomy flowers of sin withering on
her brow. Farewell her royal state! her very life, it may be! . . . What
would happen if the dayspring found her still exposed to its beams?

What will she make of Satan? a flame of fire? a heap of ashes? He asks
nothing better. He knows very well, the wily schemer, that to live, to
be born again, the only way is to die.

Shall he die, the mighty evoker of the dead, he who gave weeping friends
the only joy they knew in this world, the dream, the image of their
vanished dear ones? Nay! he is very sure to live.

Shall he die, the mighty spirit who finding Creation accursed and Nature
lying rejected in the mire, that Nature which the Church had tossed
disdainfully from her lap like an unlovely,

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

unloved foster-child, took her up again and laid her softly in his
bosom? Nay! the thing cannot be.

Shall he die, the sole and only healer of the Middle Ages, that age of
sore disease, who saved the people by his poisons and told them to "Live
on, foolish folk, love on"?

As he is assured of life, the sturdy rogue, he dies quietly and
comfortably enough. He "slips off this mortal coil" like a conjuring
trick, dexterously burns his fine black goat-skin, and vanishes in a
flash of fire and the brilliant light of the coming dawn.

But she, she who made Satan, who made everything, good and ill alike,
who fostered and favoured so many causes,—love, self-devotion, crime! .
. . What is her fate? Behold her all alone on the deserted heath!

She is far, very far, from being, as represented, the horror of all
mankind. Many will bless her name. <span id="fr_52"></span>[4](#fn_52.md)
More than one has found her fair, more than one would sell his share of
Paradise if he dared but approach her. . . . But round about her is a
great gulf,—the admiration she excites passes all bounds, and the terror
is excessive of this all-puissant Medea, of her wondrous deep-set eyes
and the voluptuous snaky ringlets of coal-black hair that flood her
shoulders.

Alone for ever; for ever loveless and alone! Who and what is left her?
Naught but the dread Spirit who stole away from her side but now.

"Well, then, good Satan, let us away. . . . I am in haste to be in those
regions down below. Hell is better than earth. Farewell this world and
all its shows!"

She who first invented, first played the awful drama, could hardly
survive her companion long. Satan, submissive to her behest, had near by
and ready saddled a gigantic black horse, whose eyes and nostrils shot
fire. She sprang to his back with one bound,—and away. . . .

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

The eyes of the bystanders followed her vanishing form. . The good folks
asked in terror, "Oh, what, what will become of her?" As she went she
laughed, a horrid peal of fiendish mirth, and disappeared from sight
like an arrow from a bow. Men fain would know, but know they never
shall, what was the unhappy creature's final doom. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_49"></span>[112:1](sor14.htm#fr_49.md) It is only a very short
while ago that my witty and accomplished friend, M. Génin, brought
together a mass of most curious information on the point in question.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[112:2](sor14.htm#fr_50.md) Boguet, Lancre, all the
authorities are at one on this point. A flat contradiction on Satan's
part, but a state of things entirely agreeable to the serf, the peasant,
the poor man. The Devil makes the harvest sprout, but renders woman
barren; wheat in abundance, but never a child.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[114:3](sor14.htm#fr_51.md) A very common condition
of things in France, I have often been told by the learned and accurate
M. Monteil.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[117:4](sor14.htm#fr_52.md) Lancre speaks of
Sorceresses who won both love and adoration.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[118:5](sor14.htm#fr_53.md) This is almost exactly
the end of an English Witch whose history is told by Wyer.
