### INTRODUCTION

SPRENGER said, before 1500: "We should speak of the *Heresy of the
Sorceresses*, not of the Sorcerers; the latter are of small account." So
another writer under Louis XIII.: "For one Sorcerer, ten thousand
Sorceresses."

"Nature makes them Sorceresses,"—the genius peculiar to woman and her
temperament. She is born a creature of Enchantment. In virtue of
regularly recurring periods of exaltation, she is a Sibyl; in virtue of
love, a Magician. By the fineness of her intuitions, the cunning of her
wiles—often fantastic, often beneficent—she is a Witch, and casts
spells, at least and lowest lulls pain to sleep and softens the blow of
calamity.

All primitive peoples start alike; this we see again and again in the
accounts given by travellers. Man hunts and fights. Woman contrives and
dreams; she is the mother of fancy, of the gods. She possesses glimpses
of the *second sight*, and has wings to soar into the infinitude of
longing and imagination. The better to count the seasons, she scans the
sky. But earth has her heart as well. Her eyes stoop to the amorous
flowers; a flower herself in her young beauty, she learns to know them
as playfellows and intimates. A woman, she asks them to heal the men she
loves.

Pathetic in their simplicity these first beginnings of Religion and
Science! Later on, each province will be separated, we shall see mankind
specialise—as medicine-man, astrologer or prophet, necromancer, priest,
physician. But in these earliest days woman is all in all, and plays
every part.

A strong and bright and vigorous religion, such as was Greek Paganism,
begins with the Sibyl, to end with the Sorceress. The

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

first, a virgin fair and beautiful, brilliant in the full blaze of dawn,
cradled it, gave it its charm and glamour. In later days, when sick and
fallen, in the gloom of the Dark Ages, on heaths and in forests, it was
concealed and protected by the Sorceress; her dauntless pity fed its
needs and kept it still alive. Thus for religions it is woman is mother,
tender protectress and faithful nurse. Gods are like men; they are born
and they die on a woman's breast.

 

But what a price she paid for her fidelity! . . . Magian queens of
Persia, enchanting Circé, sublime Sibyl, alas! how are you fallen, how
barbarous the transformation you have suffered! . . . She who, from the
throne of the Orient, taught mankind the virtues of plants and the
motions of the stars, she who, seated on the Delphic tripod and,
illumined by the very god of light, gave oracles to a kneeling world, is
the same that, a thousand years later, is hunted like a wild beast,
chased from street to street, reviled, buffeted, stoned, scorched with
red-hot embers! . . .

The clergy has not stakes enough, the people insults, the child stones,
for the unhappy being. The poet, no less a child, throws yet another
stone at her, a crueller one still for a woman. Gratuitously insulting,
he makes her out always old and ugly. The very word Sorceress or *Witch*
calls up the image of the Weird Sisters of *Macbeth*. Yet the cruel
witch trials prove exactly the opposite; many perished just because they
were young and pretty.

The Sibyl foretold the future; but the Sorceress makes it. Here is the
great, the vital distinction. She evokes, conjures, guides Destiny. She
is not like Cassandra of old, who foresaw the coming doom so clearly,
and deplored it and awaited its approach; she creates the future.
Greater than Circé, greater than Medea, she holds in her hand the magic
wand of natural miracle, she has Nature to aid and abet her like a
sister. Foreshadowings of the modern Prometheus are to be seen in her,—a
beginning

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

of industry, above all of the sovereign industry that heals and
revivifies men. Unlike the Sibyl, who seemed ever gazing towards the
dayspring, she fixes her eyes on the setting sun; but it is just this
sombre orb of the declining luminary that shows long before the dawn
(like the glow on the peaks of the High Alps) a dawn anticipatory of the
true day.

The Priest realises clearly where the danger lies, that an enemy, a
menacing rival, is to be feared in this High-priestess of Nature he
pretends to despise. Of the old gods she has invented new ones. Beside
the old Satan of the past, a new Satan is seen burgeoning in her, a
Satan of the future.

 

For a thousand years the people had one healer and one only,—the
Sorceress. Emperors and kings and popes, and the richest barons, had
sundry Doctors of Salerno, or Moorish and Jewish physicians; but the
main body of every State, the whole world we may say, consulted no one
but the *Saga*, the *Wise Woman*. If her cure failed, they abused her
and called her a Witch. But more generally, through a combination of
respect and terror, she was spoken of as the *Good Lady*, or *Beautiful
Lady* (Bella Donna), the same name as that given to fairies.

Her fate resembled that which still often befalls her favourite herb,
the belladonna, and other beneficent poisons she made use of, and which
were antidotes of the great scourges of the Middle Ages. Children and
ignorant passers-by cursed these sombre flowers, without understanding
their virtues, scared by their suspicious colour. They shudder and fly
the spot; yet these are the Comforting plants (*Solanaceæ*), which,
wisely administered, have worked so many cures and soothed so much human
agony.

They are found growing in the most sinister localities, in lonely,
ill-reputed spots, amid ruins and rubbish heaps,—yet another resemblance
with the Sorceress who utilises them. Where, indeed, could she have
taken up her habitation, except on savage heaths, this child of
calamity, so fiercely persecuted,

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

so bitterly cursed and proscribed? She gathered poisons to heal and
save; she was the Devil's bride, the mistress of the Incarnate Evil One,
yet how much good she effected, if we are to credit the great physician
of the Renaissance! Paracelsus, when in 1527, at Bâle, he burned the
whole pharmacopœia of his day, declared he had learned from the
Sorceresses all he knew.

Had they not earned some reward? Yes! and reward they had. Their
recompense was torture and the stake. New punishments were devised for
their especial benefit, new torments invented. They were brought to
trial *en masse*, condemned on the slightest pretext. Never was such
lavish waste of human life. To say nothing of Spain, the classic land of
the *auto-da-fé*, where Moor and Jew are always associated with Witches,
seven thousand were burned at Trèves, and I know not how many at
Toulouse; at Geneva five hundred in three months (1513); eight hundred
at Wurzburg, in one batch almost, and fifteen hundred at Bamberg,—both
of these quite small bishoprics! Ferdinand II. himself, the bigot, the
cruel Emperor of the Thirty Years’ War, was forced to restrain these
worthy bishops, else they would have burned all their subjects. I find,
in the Wurzburg list, a wizard of eleven, a schoolboy, and a witch of
fifteen, at Bayonne, two sorceresses of seventeen, damnably pretty.

Mark this, at certain epochs the mere word of *Sorceress* or *Witch* is
an arm wherewith Hate can kill at discretion. Female jealousy, masculine
avarice, are only too ready to grasp so convenient a weapon. Such and
such a neighbour is rich? . . . Witch! witch! Such and such is pretty? .
. . *Ah! witch!* We shall see Murgin, a little beggar-girl, casting this
terrible stone at a great lady, whose only crime was being too
beautiful, the Châtelaine de Lancinena, and marking her white forehead
with the death sign.

Accused of sorcery, women anticipate, if they can, the torture that is
inevitable by killing themselves. Remy, that worthy judge of Lorraine
who burned eight hundred of them, boasts of this Reign of Terror: "So
sure is my justice," he declared, "that

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

sixteen witches arrested the other day, never hesitated, but strangled
themselves incontinently."

 

In the long course of study for my history during the thirty years I
have devoted to it, this horrible literature of Sorcery, or Witchcraft,
has passed through my hands again and again. First I exhausted the
Manuals of the Inquisition, the asinine collections of the
Dominicans—the *Whips*, *Hammers*, *Ant-Swarms*, *Fustigations*,
*Lanterns*, etc., to give some of the absurd titles these books bear.
Next I read the men of the Law, the lay judges who take the place of
these monks, and who despise them without being much less idiotic
themselves. I say a word or two of these elsewhere; for the present I
have only one observation to make, viz. that from 1300 down to 1600, and
even later, the administration of justice is identically the same. With
the exception of one small interlude in the *Parlement* of Paris, we
find always and everywhere the same ferocity of folly. Ability and
talent make no difference. The wise and witty De Lancre, a magistrate of
Bordeaux under Henri IV., a man of enlightened ideas in politics,
directly he has to deal with witchcraft, falls back to the level of a
Nider or a Sprenger, two imbecile monks of the fifteenth century.

One is filled with amazement to see all these widely different epochs,
all these men of varying cultivation, unable to make one step in
advance. But the explanation is simple; they were one and all arrested,
let us rather say, blinded, hopelessly intoxicated and made cruel
savages of, by the poison of their first principle, the doctrine of
Original Sin. This is the fundamental dogma of universal injustice: "All
lost for one alone, not only punished but deserving punishment, undone
even before they were born and desperately wicked, dead to God from the
beginning. The babe at its mother's breast is a damned soul already."

Who says so? All do, even Bossuet. A Roman theologian of weight, Spina,
Master of the Sacred Palace, formulates the

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

doctrine in precise words: "Why does God permit the death of the
innocent? He does so justly. For if they do not die by reason of the
sins they have committed, yet they are guilty of death by reason of
original sin" <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

From this monstrous theory two consequences follow, in justice and in
logic. The judge is always sure of doing justice; anyone brought before
him is inevitably guilty, and if he defends himself, doubly guilty. No
call for Justice to sweat, and rack its brains in order to distinguish
true and false; in every case the decision is a foregone conclusion. The
logician likewise and the schoolman may spare themselves the trouble of
analysing the soul of man, of examining the phases through which it
passes, of considering its complexity, its internal disparities and
self-contradictions. No need, as *we* feel ourselves bound to do, to
explain how, by slow and subtle degrees, the soul may grow vicious
instead of virtuous. These refinements, these doubts and difficulties
and scruples, if they understood them at all, how they would laugh at
them, and shake their heads in scorn, and how gracefully would the fine
long ears that ornament their empty pates waggle to and fro!

Particularly when the *Compact with the Devil* comes into question, that
ghastly covenant where, for some small ephemeral gain, the soul sells
itself into everlasting torment, we philosophers should endeavour to
trace out the accursed path, the appalling ladder of calamities and
crimes, capable of having brought it so low. But our theologian can
ignore all such considerations! For him Soul and Devil were created for
each other; so that at the first temptation, for a caprice, a sudden
longing, a passing fancy, the soul flies headlong to this dreadful
extremity.

 

Nor can I see any traces of modern writers having made much inquiry into
the moral chronology of Sorcery. They confine themselves far too much to
the connections between the Middle

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ages and Classical
Antiquity. The connection is real enough, but slight and of quite minor
importance. Neither the ancient Enchantress, nor yet the Celtic and
Germanic Seeress, are yet the true Sorceress. The harmless *Sabasia*
(festivals of Bacchus Sabasius), a miniature rustic "Sabbath" which
survived down to Mediæval times, are far from identical with the *Black
Mass* of the fourteenth century, that deliberate and deadly defiance of
Jesus. These gloomy conceptions were not passed on down the long thread
of tradition; they sprang ready made from the horrors of the time.

From when does the Sorceress date? I answer unhesitatingly, "From the
ages of despair."

From the profound despair the World owed to the Church. I say again
unhesitatingly, "The Sorceress is the Church's crime."

I pass over the string of plausible explanations by which the priests
attempt to mitigate her guilt: "Weak and frivolous by nature, open to
every temptation, women were led astray by concupiscence." Alas! in the
wretchedness and famine of those dreadful times, this was no force
sufficient to rouse to demoniac frenzy. Loving women, jealous and
forsaken, children driven out of doors by a cruel stepmother, mothers
beaten by their sons (all hackneyed subjects of legendary tales), may
indeed have been tempted to invoke the Evil Spirit; but all this does
not constitute the Sorceress, the Witch. Because the unhappy creatures
call upon Satan, it does not follow that he accepts their service. They
are still far, very far, from being ripe for him. They have yet to learn
to *hate God*.

 

To understand this better, read the accursed Registers still extant of
the Inquisition, not in the extracts compiled by Llorente,
Lamotte-Langon, etc., but in what is extant of the original Registers of
Toulouse. Read them in their vapid sameness, their dismal aridity, their
shocking unconscious savagery. A few pages, and you are cold at heart, a
cruel chill strikes home

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

to the vitals. Death, death, always death, you feel it in every page.
You are already in the tomb, or immured in a little chamber of stone
with damp-stained walls. The happiest gate is death. The dreadful thing
is the *in pace*. One word recurs continually, like a bell of horror
tolled, and tolled again, to drive the dead in life into despair,—always
the same word, *Immured*.

Dread apparatus for crushing and annihilating souls, cruel press for
breaking hearts. The screw turns, and turns, till breath fails and the
very bones crack, and she springs from the horrid engine a mystery in an
unknown world!

The Sorceress has neither father nor mother, neither son, nor mate, nor
kindred. She appears none knows from whence, a monster, an aërolite from
the skies. Who so bold, great God! as to come nigh her?

Where is her lurking-place? In untracked wilds, in impenetrable forests
of bramble, on blasted heaths, where entangled thistles suffer no foot
to pass. She must be sought by night, cowering beneath some old-world
dolmen. If you find her, she is isolated still by the common horror of
the countryside; she has, as it were, a ring of fire round her haunts.

’Tis hard to credit it, but she is a woman still. Even this fearful life
has its spring of womanhood, its feminine electricity, in virtue of
which she is dowered with two gifts

*The* [*half-sane*](errata.htm#0.md)*, half-insane madness, illuminism*, of
the seer, which according to its degree is poetry, second sight,
preternatural vision, a faculty of speech at once simple and astute,
above all else the power of believing in her own falsehoods. This gift
is unknown to the male Sorcerer; the Wizard fails to comprehend its very
elements.

From it flows a second, the sublime faculty of *solitary conception*,
that parthenogenesis our physiologists of to-day recognise as existing
among the females of numerous species. The same fecundity of body is no
less procreative where conceptions of the spirit are involved.

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

All alone, she conceived and brought forth. Whom or what? Another of her
own kind, so like the original as to cheat the eyes.

Child of hate, conceived of love; for without love nothing can be
created. The Sorceress, terror-struck as she is at her strange
offspring, yet sees herself so faithfully reproduced, finds such content
in contemplating this new idol, that instantly she sets it on the altar,
worships it, immolates herself to it, giving her own body as victim and
living sacrifice.

We shall often and often find her telling the judge: "There is only one
thing I am afraid of,—not to suffer enough for him." <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)

Do you know how the newborn infant salutes the new world he enters? With
a horrid scream of laughter. And has he not good cause to be glad, there
on the free and open plains, far from the dungeons of Spain, and the
*immured* victims of Toulouse? His *in pace* is wide as the world
itself. He comes and goes, roaming where he will. His the boundless
forest! his the vast heath that stretches away to the farthest horizon!
his the round world and the riches thereof! The Sorceress calls him
tenderly, "*Robin*, Robin mine! "—from the name of that gallant outlaw,
the gay Robin Hood, that lived under the greenwood tree. Another pet
name she loves to give him is *Verdelet*, *Joli-Bois*, *Vert-Bois*. The
green woods, indeed, are the frolicsome scamp's favourite haunts; one
glimpse of bush and briar, and he is off, a wild truant of Nature.

 

The astounding thing is that at the first essay the Sorceress really and
truly made a living being. He has every mark of actuality. He has been
seen and heard, and everybody can describe him.

The saints, those children of affection, the sons of the house, pay
little heed, only watch and dream; they *wait in patient waiting*,
confident of getting their share of the Elect in God's

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

good time. The small degree of activity they possess is concentrated
within the narrow circle of *Imitation*—the word sums up the Middle
Ages. But for him, the bastard all curse, whose share is only the lash,
he has no thought of waiting. He is for ever prying and searching, never
an instant still, trying all things in heaven and earth. He is to the
last degree curious and inquisitive, scrutinising, rummaging, sounding,
poking his nose everywhere. At the solemn *Consummatum est* he grins,
and makes a derisive mow. His word is always "Not yet!" and "Forward
still!"

All the same, he is not hard to please. Nothing rebuffs him; what Heaven
throws in his way, he picks up with alacrity. For instance the Church
has rejected Nature as something impure and suspect. Satan seizes on it,
and makes it his pride and ornament. Better still, he utilises it, turns
it to profit, originates the arts from it, accepting gladly the great
name they would fain cast at him as a stigma and a disgrace, that of
*Prince of this World*.

"Alas for them that laugh!"—they had declared with startling unwisdom;
for what was this but giving Satan a fine initial advantage to start
with, the monopoly of laughter, and proclaiming him *amusing?* Let us
say *necessary* at once; for laughter is an essential function of human
nature. How support life at all, if we cannot laugh,—at any rate when we
are in sorrow?

The Church, which sees in our life below only a test and trial for one
to come, takes care not to prolong it needlessly. Her medicine is
resignation, a waiting and a hoping for death. Here is a great field
opened to Satan; he becomes physician, healer of living men. Nay more!
consoler as well; he has the compassion to show us our dead, to evoke
the shades of the dear ones we have loved and lost.

Another trifle the Church has cast away and condemned—Logic, the free
exercise of Reason. Here again is an appetising dainty *the Enemy* snaps
up greedily.

The Church had built of solid stone and tempered mortar a

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

narrow *in pace*, vaulted, low-browed and confined, lighted by the
merest glimmer of day through a tiny slit. This they called the
*schools*. A few shavelings were let loose in it, and told "to be free";
they one and all grew halting cripples. Three hundred, four hundred
years, only made them more helplessly paralysed. Between Abelard and
Occam the progress made is—nil!

A pretty tale, to say we must look there for the origin of the
Renaissance! The Renaissance came about, no doubt of that; but how? by
the satanic effort of men who broke through the vault, the struggles of
condemned criminals who *would* see the light of heaven. It came about
in the main far away from schools and scholastics, in that school of
wild nature where Satan lectured a truant band of Sorceresses and
shepherd lads.

A dangerous curriculum, if ever there was one! But its very risks
stimulated the love of knowledge, the frantic longing to see and know.
It was there began the black sciences, the forbidden Chemistry of
poisons, and the accursed thing, Anatomy. The shepherd, first to scan
the stars, along with his discoveries in Astronomy, brought to the
common stock his sinister recipes and his experiments on animals. Then
the Sorceress would contribute a corpse filched from the nearest
graveyard; and for the first time—at the risk of the stake—men could
contemplate that miracle of God's handicraft "which" (as M. Serres so
well said) "we hide in silly prudishness instead of trying to
understand."

The only Doctor admitted to these classes, Paracelsus, noted a third as
well, who now and again would glide in to join the sinister conclave,
bringing Surgery with him as his contribution. This was the surgeon of
those gentle times,—the Public Executioner, the man of unflinching hand,
whose plaything was the branding-iron, who broke men's bones and could
set them again, who could slay and make alive, and hang a felon up to a
certain point and no further.

This criminal University of the Sorceress, the Shepherd, and the
Hangman, by means of its experiments—a sacrilege every

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

one—emboldened the other and rival seat of learning and forced its
scholars to study. For each was fain to live; and otherwise the Witch
would have monopolised all, and the Schoolmen turned their backs for
good and all on Medicine. The Church *had* to submit, and wink at these
crimes. She allowed there were *good poisons* (Grillandus); she
permitted dissection in public, though reluctantly and under dire
constraint. In 1306 the Italian Mondino opened and dissected a woman,
and another in 1315. It was a solemn and beneficent revelation, the
veritable discovery of a new world,—far more so than Christopher
Columbus's. Fools shuddered, and howled in protest; wise men dropped on
their knees.

 

With victories like these to his credit, Satan could not but live. Alone
the Church would never have had strength to crush him. Fire and stake
were of no avail, but a certain line of policy was more successful.

With no little astuteness the kingdom of Satan was divided against
itself. In opposition to his daughter and bride, the Sorceress, was set
her son, the Healer.

The Church, deeply and from the bottom of her heart as she hated the
latter, none the less established his monopoly, to secure the
Sorceress's ruin. She declares, in the fourteenth century, that if a
woman dare to cure *without having studied*, she is a Witch and must
die.

But how should she study publicly? Imagine the scene, at once ludicrous
and terrible, that would have occurred if the poor savage creature had
ventured to enter the schools! What merriment and wild gaiety! In the
bale-fires of St. John's day, cats chained together were burned to
death. But think of the Sorceress bound to this caterwauling rout of
hell, the Witch screaming and roasting in the flames, what a treat for
the gentle band of young shavelings and sucking pedants!

We shall see Satan's decadence all in good time,—a sorry tale. We shall
see him pacified, grown a *good old sort*. He is

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

robbed and pillaged, till at last, of the two masks he wore at the
Witches’ Sabbath, the foulest is adopted by Tartuffe.

His spirit is everywhere. But for himself, for his own personality, in
losing the Witch, he lost all. The Wizards were bores, and nothing more.

Now that his fall has been so far consummated, do his foes quite realise
what they have done? Was he not a necessary actor, an indispensable
factor in the great engine of religious faith,—something out of gear
nowadays? Every organism that works well is double, has two sides; life
is hardly possible otherwise. A certain balance between two forces is
necessary, forces mutually opposed and symmetrical, but unequal. The
inferior acts as counterpoise, corresponding to the other. The superior
grows impatient at the check, and is for abolishing it altogether. But
the wish is a mistaken one.

When Colbert, in 1672, shelved Satan with so little ceremony, forbidding
the Judges of the Realm to hear cases of Witchcraft, the Norman
*Parlement*, in its obstinate conservatism, its sound Norman logicality,
demonstrated the dangers attending such a decision. The Devil is nothing
less than a dogma closely bound up with all the rest. Touch the
vanquished of the ages—are you not touching the victor too? Doubt the
acts of the one—is not this paving the way to doubt those of the other,
those very miracles he did to fight the Devil? The pillars of heaven are
based in the abyss. The rash man who shakes this infernal foundation may
well crack the walls of paradise.

Colbert paid no heed; he had so many other things to do. But it may be
the Devil heard. And his wounded spirit is greatly consoled. In the
petty trades where he now gains his living—Spiritualism, Table-turning,
and the like—he resigns himself to insignificance, and thinks, at any
rate, he is not the only time-hallowed institution that is a-dying.
