> <span class="small">But the greatest revolution the Sorceress brought
> about, the chief movement of all in contradiction, in direct
> contradiction to the spirit of the Middle Ages, is what we might well
> call a rehabilitation of the belly and its digestive functions. They
> boldly proclaimed the doctrine that "nothing is impure and nothing
> unclean." From that moment the study of physical science was
> enfranchised, its shackles loosed, and true medicine became a
> possibility.--[p. 86](sor11.htm#page_86)</span>
>
> This is a translation of Jules Michelet's La Sorcière, originally
> published in Paris in 1862. I have titled this text The Sorceress
> because that is a literal translation of the original French title.
> The original title of this translation was Satanism and Witchcraft,
> and it was later retitled Witchcraft, Sorcery and Superstition.
> However there is no need to sensationalize this book; the material is
> already sensational enough. And *women* are at the center of this
> book: peasant healers, aristocratic noblewomen, and nuns; we get an
> unparalleled look at the misery that medieval women faced, and some of
> the ways they rebelled.
>
> Michelet was one of the first to attempt a sociological explanation of
> the Witch trials. Like his successor [Margaret Murray](../wcwe/index),
> he interprets the source material very literally. Unlike Murray, he
> presents a proto-Marxist explanation for the phenomena; the witch cult
> as a primal rebellion against conventional society, one of many
> 'heretical' movements quashed by the Church. As time went on, the cult
> became institutionalized, which led to tacit toleration in some
> quarters. Michelet's portrayal of the lone sorceress as a pioneer of
> medicine and science is also memorable. Towards the end, a different
> kind of diabolical intervention is analyzed; the 'possession' of nuns
> in the 17th century, and how it was stage-managed by sadistic male
> clerics.
>
> Michelet uses a style popular in the 19th century, of interspersing
> fictional but representative incidents in with the exposition. A more
> academic style would quote pages and pages of heavily footnoted and
> very repetitive accounts. By condensing these into an short story,
> Michelet makes the book infinitely more readable. If you want an
> academically cited study, you'll have to look elsewhere, but that
> doesn't prevent this book from being a classic study of the burning
> times.
