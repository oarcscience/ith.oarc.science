### *THE NUNS of LOUDUN URBAIN GRANDIER* *1633*, *1634*

IN the *Mémoires d’État* composed by the renowned Father Joseph, known
to us only in fragments, having doubtless been prudently suppressed as
too instructive, the worthy Father explained how in the year 1633 he had
had the good fortune to discover a heresy, an enormously widespread
heresy, affecting a countless multitude of confessors and directors of
consciences.

The Capuchins, an admirably organised legion of defenders of the Church,
good watch-dogs of the holy flock, had scented out and unearthed, not in
the deserts, but in mid-France, in the centre, at Chartres, in Picardy
and everywhere, a formidable quarry, the *alumbrados* of Spain
(*illuminati* or Quietists), who too fiercely persecuted in that
country, had taken refuge in France, and who among women, and above all
in the nunneries, were instilling the soft poison ticketed later on with
the name of Molinos.

The wonder is the thing had not been discovered sooner. It could not
very well be hidden, being so widely disseminated; the Capuchins swore
that in Picardy alone (a land where the women are weak and the blood
more fiery than in the South itself) this mania of mystic love had sixty
thousand professors. Was the whole body of clergy involved then? all the
confessors, all the directors? It must no doubt be understood that the
official directors of consciences were supplemented by a great number of
laymen burning with the same zeal for the salvation

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

of female souls. One of this class, who was conspicuous at a later date
no less for talent than for bold originality, was the author of the
*Délices Spirituelles* (Spiritual Joys), Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin.

 

It is impossible to realise or understand the enormous power exercised
by the Confessor over nuns, a hundred-fold more absolute at this time
than in any previous age, unless the new conditions of the period are
taken into account.

The reforms decided upon at the Council of Trent with regard to the
closer seclusion of the inmates of Religious Houses, which had been
largely ignored under Henri IV., when nuns entertained their fashionable
friends, gave balls and danced at them, etc., these reforms began to be
seriously enforced under Louis XIII. Cardinal de la Rochefoucauld, or
rather the Jesuits who acted through him, insisted upon a high degree of
external propriety. Need we say all entry into convents was prohibited
for the male sex? One man, and one man only, went there every day,
penetrating not only into the house, but wherever he wished, into each
cell,—this comes out clearly in several cases, especially in the
evidence given by David at Louviers. This reformation, this close
seclusion, shut the door in the face of the world at large and excluded
all inconvenient rivals, giving the right of familiar intercourse with
Religious Women and the exclusive opportunity of influencing their minds
to the Father Confessor.

What was likely to follow? This may be problematical, a matter of
speculation, to dreamers; but practical men, and doctors, know better.
As early as the sixteenth century the physician Wyer makes it clear
enough to us by very plain examples. In his Book IV. he cites numerous
cases of nuns having gone mad with love; while in Book III. he mentions
a well-reputed Spanish priest, who having gone by chance when at Rome
into a convent of nuns, left it a maniac, declaring that as brides of
Christ, they were his, those of the priest, Christ's Vicar.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He had Masses said
praying that God might grant him the grace to wed soon with the convent
in question. <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md)

If a mere passing visit could produce such an effect, we can understand
what must have been the state of mind of the regular Director of
nunneries of women, when he was alone with them, in the seclusion of the
cloister, could spend all day with them, and receive at any hour the
perilous confidences of their languors and weaknesses.

Nor are temptations of the senses the only factor to be reckoned with in
these cases. We must likewise take account of the ennui and the
irresistible craving to vary the conditions of existence, to escape from
a monotonous life by the indulgence of some caprice or some fancy. Then
what an age of new discoveries, of novelties of all sorts, it was!
Travel, the Indies, discoveries of new worlds! Printing! last but not
least, Romances! . . . When everything is on the move out of doors,
every mind on the stretch, how suppose it possible to endure the
crushing uniformity of monastic life, the long, weary services,
unrelieved by anything more exciting than a dull sermon intoned through
the nose?

 

Even laymen, in the midst of so many distractions, demand insistently of
their confessors the pleasing variety of an occasional escapade,
absolution for a certain degree of inconsistency of life.

The priest is hurried along by the current, and constrained to concede
point after point. A vast, various, and learned literature develops out
of Casuistry, or the art of making everything permissible,—a rapidly
progressive literature moreover, in which yesterday's leniency would
seem stern severity to-day.

Casuistry was for the laity, Mysticism for the cloister.

The complete suppression of individuality and the death of free will,
this is the great principle of Mysticism. Desmarets gives us very
clearly the true moral purport of it all. The pious

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

devotee, he says, sacrificed in and for himself and annihilated, exists
henceforth only in God. *Henceforth he can do no wrong*. His higher part
is so divinely perfect, he has no consciousness left of what the other
part is doing. <span id="fr_67"></span>[2](#fn_67.md)

One would have supposed that the zealous Father Joseph, after uttering
so loud a cry of alarm against these corruptors of morals, would not
have stopped there, that a full and searching inquiry would have been
held, that this countless host, that in one province alone numbered
sixty thousand Doctors of the Church, would be made known and minutely
scrutinised. But no! they simply disappear, and no news is to be heard
of them. Some, it is said, were cast in prison; but no trial was held,
nothing done to break the deep silence. To all appearance, Richelieu had
no mind to fathom the matter. For all his tenderness for the Capuchins,
he was not so blinded by partiality as to follow their lead in a matter
which would have put into their hands the duty of making inquiry into
the conduct of all the confessors in the country.

As a rule, the monk both envied and hated the secular clergy. He was
absolute master of the women of Spain; but was less appreciated by their
French sisters on account of the dirtiness of his person; they preferred
to call in the priest, or the Jesuit Father, an amphibious director, so
to speak, half monk, half

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

man of the world. If once Richelieu let loose the pack on Capuchins,
Recollets, Carmelites, Dominicans, and the rest, no one would be safe
among the clergy either. What director, what priest, however well
meaning, had not on occasion used—yea, and abused—the pleasant jargon of
the Quietists when dealing with his penitents?

Richelieu took good care not to worry the clergy at a time when he was
already preparing for the General Diet at which he asked for a
contribution for the war. One prosecution was allowed the monks, and
only one, against a curé,—but a curé accused of Magic, which made it
competent to confuse issues (as in the Gauffridi affair) to such good
purpose that no single confessor, no single director, recognised the
case as being like his own, and each could say in perfect security, "I
have nothing to do with it."

 

Thanks to these judicious precautions, a certain degree of obscurity
really envelopes the case of Urbain Grandier. <span
id="fr_68"></span>[3](#fn_68.md) The historian of the affair, the Capuchin
Tranquille, proves conclusively and satisfactorily he was a Sorcerer,
and more than a Sorcerer, a Devil, and he is entitled in the documents
of the trial (as they might have said of the goddess Ashtoreth)
*Grandier of the Dominations!* 

Ménage, on the contrary, taking a diametrically opposite view, is almost
ready to rank him in the list of great men falsely accused of Magic,
among the martyrs of liberty of conscience.

To see somewhat more clearly into the affair, we must not

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

isolate Grandier, but let him occupy his proper place in the great
diabolic Trilogy of those days, of which he and his doings formed only
the Second Act; we must seek enlightenment on his case from the First
Act, played out in Provence, as we have seen, in the dreadful business
of La Sainte-Baume that ruined Gauffridi, and further enlightenment
again from the Third Act, the affair of Louviers, which was a copy of
Loudun (in the same way as Loudun had copied La Sainte-Baume), and which
in its turn produced a Gauffridi and an Urbain Grandier.

The three affairs are one and identical. In all of them the libertine
Priest, in all the jealous Monk and the maniac Nun by whose mouth they
make the Devil speak,—and all end in the same way, by the death of the
Priest at the stake.

One difference throws a strong light on these matters, and lets us have
a clearer view than we can ever obtain in the fetid darkness of the
Spanish and Italian monasteries,—the fact that while the nuns of these
lands of Southern sloth were astonishingly passive and readily submitted
to the life of the seraglio and worse things still, <span
id="fr_69"></span>[4](#fn_69.md) their French sisters were of a very
different temper. Their personality was vigorous, ardent, exacting; very
devils (in no figurative sense) at once of jealousy and hate, they were
equally indiscreet, loquacious, and spiteful. Their revelations were
very precise, so extremely so towards the end as to arouse universal
shame and disgust, the result being that in the course of thirty years
three several scandals, forced into prominence by sheer horror and
indignation, eventually died out drearily and ignominiously amid the
groans of sick repulsion.

It was hardly at Loudun, in mid-Poitou, among the Huguenots and exposed
to their scrutiny and jeers, in the very town where they held their
great National Synods, that we should have expected a great scandal for
the Catholics to have occurred. But it was just in these old Protestant
towns that the latter were accustomed to live like conquerors in a
subdued country, allowing themselves a very wide liberty of action, not
unnaturally

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

supposing that people so often massacred and only recently defeated,
would enter no protests. The Catholic inhabitants,—magistrates, priests,
monks, a few nobles and a handful of artisans,—lived apart from the rest
of the population quite like a colony of conquering aliens. This colony
was further subdivided, as might be guessed, by the opposition existing
between priests and monks.

 

The monks, a haughty and numerous band, as missionaries among a heretic
population took the wall of the Protestant inhabitants, and acted as
confessors to the Catholic ladies of the town. Such was the state of
things when one day there arrived from Bordeaux a young curé, a pupil of
the Jesuits, a cultivated and agreeable man, writing well and speaking
better. He made a sensation in the pulpit, and soon afterwards in
society as well. He was a native of Mantes and a born dialectician, but
by education a *Meridional*, with the well-oiled tongue of Bordeaux and
all the boasting, light-hearted effrontery of a Gascon. In a very short
time he had contrived to set the whole of the little town by the ears,
having the women on his side, the men against him,—all or very nearly
all. He waxed superb, insolent, and insupportable, lost to all sense of
proper reverence. He rained torrents of sarcasm at the Carmelites, and
held forth publicly in the pulpit against the monks in general. The
crowds were suffocating when he preached. Dignified and richly dressed,
he paraded the streets of Loudun like a Father of the Church, while by
night in a quieter way he would be lurking down back alleys or slipping
in by back doors.

The women were at his beck and call. The wife of the "Avocat du Roi" was
not insensible to his graces, and far more so the daughter of the
"Procureur Royal," who had a child by him. Nor was this enough; this
triumphant squire of dames, pushing his advantage farther and farther,
began to assail the denizens of the nunneries.

There were to be found everywhere at that period Sisters of

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

the Ursuline Order, nuns vowed to the education of the young, lady
missionaries in a Protestant land, expert at flattering and winning over
the mothers and drawing the little girls under their influence. The
Ursulines of Loudun formed a small convent of the daughters of poor but
noble houses. The convent itself was ill supplied with this world's
goods; the community having been endowed, at its first foundation, with
little more than the house itself, a former Huguenot college. The Lady
Superior, a person of good family and very well connected, burned with
zeal to raise the status of her convent, to increase its numbers, to
enrich and make it famous. She would very possibly have chosen Grandier,
the man of the hour, for Confessor and Director, if she had not already
had in these capacities a priest who possessed influence in the district
for quite other reasons, being nearly related to the two principal
magistrates. The Canon Mignon, such was his name, had no little
influence over the Lady Superior. Both he and she learned in confession
(the Ladies Superior of Convents used to confess the inmates) the
hateful truth that the younger nuns dreamed of nothing else but this
Grandier who was so much talked about.

Thus the Confessor whose authority was menaced, the husband whose honour
was attacked, the father whose feelings were outraged, all these united
their jealousy and indignation at the wrong done to family life, and
swore a great oath to be Grandier's undoing. To attain this object, they
had only to give him rope enough, as the saying is, and he would hang
himself. Nor was it long before a scandal exploded that made noise
enough to shake the town down pretty nearly.

 

The nuns, in the old Huguenot mansion they were settled in, did not feel
altogether at their ease. Their boarders, children of the townsfolk, the
younger Sisters possibly helping them, had found it a diverting
amusement to terrify their companions by playing at ghosts, phantoms,
and apparitions. Discipline was not over-strict among this miscellaneous
collection of little girls,

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

the spoilt children of rich parents. At night they would be scampering
up and down the corridors, till they frightened both themselves and each
other. Some were really ill with the effects, if not in body, at any
rate in mind. But the object of all these terrors and illusions,
complicated by the town talk they heard only too much of during the day,
the ghost of these agitated nights was always Grandier. Several declared
they had seen him, felt him of nights at their side, venturesome and
victorious, and that they only awoke to full consciousness when it was
too late. Was it all a case of self-deception,—or some trick of the
novices? Was it really Grandier, who had bribed the portress or boldly
climbed the convent walls? The matter has never been cleared up.

However, from that moment the three champions of family honour felt they
had their man in their power. First of all they got from among the
number of their humbler protégées two worthy souls to make declaration
they could endure no longer to have as curé a debauchee, a sorcerer, a
demon, a freethinker, who at church "bent one knee only and not two," a
man who laughed at rules and regulations, and granted dispensations
contrary to the Bishop's prerogatives. This last cleverly imagined
charge set the Bishop of Poitiers against him, otherwise the natural
defender of the priest, while giving up the latter to the malevolence of
the monks.

The whole case was got up with consummate ability, it must be confessed.
While having him accused by a couple of poor parishioners, it was found
a further help to get him cudgelled by a nobleman. In this age of
duelling the man who took a cudgelling inevitably lost ground with the
public and was humiliated in the eyes of the fair sex; and Grandier
fully realised the severity of the blow his prestige had received.
Loving notoriety as he did, he went straight to the King himself, and
throwing himself on his knees, claimed satisfaction for the insult to
his cloth. The King was a pious king, and would probably have granted
what was asked, had there not been people about him who told

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

his Majesty it was a question of intrigue and the reprisals of injured
husbands.

Brought before the Ecclesiastical Tribunal of Poitiers, Grandier was
condemned to penance and to be banished from Loudun, in other words,
degraded and dishonoured as a priest. However, the Civil Tribunal
reopened the case, and found him innocent. He had, moreover, on his side
the superior ecclesiastical authority to which Poitiers was subordinate,
viz. the Archbishop of Bordeaux, Sourdis. This warlike prelate, an
admiral and a gallant sailor quite as much as a priest, or more so,
merely shrugged his shoulders at the tales of these peccadilloes. He
acquitted the curé, but at the same time gave him the very judicious
advice to go and live anywhere else rather than at Loudun.

This was just what the proud priest had no sort of mind to do. He was
for savouring his triumph on the scene of battle and marching past
before the ladies. He re-entered Loudun in broad daylight,—drums beating
and flags flying; he carried a laurel brand as he walked, and all the
fairest eyes of the city looked at his progress from the windows.

 

Not satisfied with this silly triumph, he now began to threaten and hint
at compensation. His enemies, thus driven to bay and now in peril
themselves, remembered the Gauffridi affair, in which the Devil, the
Father of Lies, had been duly and honourably rehabilitated and accepted
in court as a good truth-telling witness, worthy of credit and belief on
the part both of the Church and the King's servants. In their desperate
strait, they invoked a devil; and he came prompt to command, putting in
his first appearance in the Ursuline convent.

The thing was risky, of course, but then, how many were interested in
its success! The Lady Superior very soon found her convent, poor and
obscure till now, attracting the eyes of the Court, the provinces, the
whole world of France. The monks saw in it the triumph of their cause
over their rivals the priests;

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

and an opportunity for reviving those fights with the Devil so popular
in the preceding century, very often (as at Soissons) held before the
church doors, and in which the populace with mingled terror and
exultation beheld God's victory over his diabolic adversary, the
admission "that God is in the elements" dragged reluctantly from the
Devil, and the Huguenots convinced and brought to confusion out of the
Demon's own mouth.

In this tragi-comedy the exorcist represented Almighty God, or if not
quite that, at any rate the Archangel treading down the Dragon. He would
step down from the platform, exhausted and dripping with sweat, but
triumphant, to be borne shoulder high by the crowd and receive the
blessings of the women who wept for joy to see such things.

This was why something of Sorcery must always be an ingredient in legal
cases of this sort; the Devil supplied the only really interesting
*motif*. Of course he could not always be shown leaving the accused's
body in the form of a black toad, as at Bordeaux in 1610; but at any
rate the *mise en scène* was grand and imposing enough. The grim
loneliness of poor Madeleine, the honours of La Sainte-Baume, in the
Provence business, were no insignificant factors of success. Loudun had
for its part the noisy rout and delirious frenzy of a whole army of
exorcists distributed among several different churches. Last but not
least, Louviers, as we shall see presently, by way of reviving interest
in these rather out-of-date proceedings, inaugurated a series of
midnight episodes, where, by the flickering torchlight, the devils,
disguised as nuns, dug pits and extracted from them the magic talismans
that had been there secreted.

 

The Loudun affair began with the Lady Superior and a lay Sister in
attendance upon her,—who fell into convulsions and indulged in long
diabolic rigmaroles. Other nuns copied them,—especially one bold spirit
who recreated the rôle formerly played by Sister Louise at Marseilles,
representing the same devil, Leviathan, the head demon of all cunning
and calumny.

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

The little town is shaken to its foundations. The monks of all colours
take possession of the nuns, divide them between them, proceed to
exorcise them by threes and fours. They partition the churches between
them, the Capuchins alone possessing themselves of two. These are
crowded to excess, the whole female population flocking thither, and
among the frightened, excitable congregation thus formed, more than one
woman is heard screaming she also feels devils working within her. Six
young women of Loudun are *possessed;* while the mere recital of these
dreadful doings produces a like effect on two more at Chinon.

Everywhere it formed the absorbing subject of conversation,—at Paris, at
Court. The Queen of France, a Spaniard by birth and a woman of ardent
imagination and enthusiastic piety, sends her own Almoner; more
important still, Lord Montagu, the old papal partisan and her Majesty's
faithful servant, who saw everything and believed everything, reported
everything to the Pope. The miracle was proved and confirmed; with his
own eyes he had seen the wounds on a nun's body, the stigmata impressed
by the Devil on the hands of the Lady Superior.

What had the King of France to say to it all? All his devotion was
turned in the direction of the Devil, to Hell, to religious fear; and it
is said Richelieu was delighted to keep it concentrated there. I doubt
this myself; the devils were essentially Spanish and of the Spanish
faction,—if they had talked politics at all, it would have been against
Richelieu. It may be this was what he dreaded; at any rate he paid them
the compliment of sending his niece to display a proper interest in the
matter.

 

The Court was ready to believe; but it was not so on the spot, at
Loudon. The local devils, wretched plagiarists of the demons of
Marseilles, merely repeated by rote in the morning what had been taught
them overnight from the well-known Manual of Michaëlis. They would never
have known what to say, had not secret exorcisms, carefully rehearsed
every evening

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

for next day's comedy, taught them the proper graces of deportment and
style for an effective appearance in public.

A firm and determined magistrate, the *Bailli* of the town, detected the
fraud and came in person to expose its perpetrators, threatening and
denouncing them. The Archbishop of Bordeaux tacitly coincided, when
Grandier appealed to him. He sent an order to regulate the exorcists’
zeal at any rate and put an end to their arbitrary proceedings; more
than this his surgeon, who visited the young women, declared them not to
be possessed at all. According to him they were not mad, not even
touched with insanity,—but undoubted impostors and arrant shams.

Thus the century continues the great duel of Doctor against Devil, of
Science and Enlightenment against the spirit of Falsehood and
Obscurantism. We saw its commencement with Agrippa and Wyer; and now
another physician, a man called Duncan, gallantly continued the same
struggle at Loudun, and fearlessly printed the statement that the whole
affair was only deserving of ridicule.

The Devil, reputed so stubborn, showed the white feather and uttered not
another word. But the angry passions of both sides were too much excited
for things to stop here. The tide flowed so strong in Grandier's favour
that those attacked now became the attacking party. A kinsman of the
accusers, an apothecary, was brought to book by a rich and well-born
lady of the town, whom he had stated to be the curé's mistress, and was
condemned, as a common slanderer, to make proper reparation.

The Lady Superior felt herself on the verge of ruin. It could easily
have been proved, what an eye-witness saw later on, that her so-called
stigmata were merely painted on, the colouring being freshened up every
day. But she was related to a member of the King's Council,
Laubardemont, and he saved her. At the moment he was entrusted with a
commission to clear the

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

ground at Loudun; and he now got himself nominated to bring Grandier to
trial. The Cardinal was given to understand that the accused priest was
the curé and friend of the *Cordonnière de Loudun*, one of the numerous
agents of Marie de Médicis; that he had constituted himself secretary to
his parishioner and had under her name composed a scandalous and
unworthy pamphlet.

For the matter of that, Richelieu would gladly have shown himself
magnanimous and treated the matter with contempt, but it was hardly
possible for him to have done so. The Capuchins and Father Joseph
speculated on this; for Richelieu would have given him a fine hold over
him with the King, if he had shown a want of proper zeal. A certain M.
Quillet, who had kept a careful eye on things, went to see Richelieu and
warned him. But the Cardinal was afraid to listen to him, and appeared
so ill-disposed towards his would-be benefactor that the latter judged
it prudent to take refuge in Italy.

 

Laubardemont arrives on December 6th, 1663, with unlimited discretionary
powers,—and his arrival marks the commencement of a reign of terror. He
is the King's direct representative, wielding the whole weight of the
Government of France,—a grim, ponderous sledge-hammer, to crush a fly.

The magistrates felt the affront; and the *Lieutenant Civil* notified
Grandier of his intention to arrest him on the morrow. The latter paid
no heed, and was duly arrested, instantly hurried out of the place
without legal formalities of any sort, and thrown into the dungeons of
Angers. Subsequently he was brought back again and confined (of all
places in the world) in the house and bedchamber of one of his personal
enemies, who had the windows walled up in an attempt to suffocate him.
The detestable examination carried out on the suspected Sorcerer's
person by driving in needles to discover the Devil's mark, was conducted
by the very hands of his accusers themselves, who

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

thus exacted a preliminary vengeance on him, a foretaste of more deadly
penalties to follow.

He is dragged to churches to confront the mad women, to whom
Laubardemont's arrival has restored the power of speech. There he finds
a band of furious Bacchanals whom the condemned apothecary was busy
intoxicating with his potions, throwing them into such paroxysms of rage
that on one occasion Grandier came near perishing under their nails.

Unable to vie with the eloquence of the Devil-possessed Louise of
Marseilles, they made up for the want of it by impudent cynicism. A vile
sight truly!—young girls, taking advantage of the devils supposed to be
prompting them to let loose the floodgates of their sensual delirium for
the public delectation! For it was this and nothing else that attracted
such crowds; they came to hear from women's mouths things that no modest
female lips ever dare to utter.

And the absurdity of these scenes increased *pari passu* with the
odiousness. The scraps of Latin that were whispered in their ears they
pronounced all wrong. The public said scornfully that the devils had not
passed their Fourth Standard. The Capuchins, not in the least
disconcerted, replied that if the demons were weak in Latin, they spoke
Troquois to perfection and very fine Double Dutch.

 

This ignoble farce, when seen from a distance of sixty leagues, from
Saint-Germain or the Louvre, appeared something miraculous, terrifying,
and appalling. The French Court wondered and shuddered; while Richelieu
(no doubt to win popularity) condescended to a cowardly proceeding,
having both exorcists and nuns paid for what they did.

So signal a favour encouraged the cabal, which now lost all sense of
decorum and moderation. Words of senseless folly were succeeded by
shameful acts. The exorcists, under pretext of the fatigued condition of
the nuns, sent them on pleasure excursions

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

outside the town, sometimes themselves accompanying them. The result was
one of the number became enceinte, or at any rate seemed to be so. At
the end of the fifth or sixth month this appearance vanished completely,
and the demon that was in her confessed the trick he had played, in
order to bring discredit on the poor nun by an illusory pregnancy. It is
the learned historian of Louviers who supplies us with this fragment of
the history of Loudun. <span id="fr_70"></span>[5](#fn_70.md)

It is credibly affirmed that Father Joseph arrived incognito, but seeing
the case was hopeless, quietly withdrew again. The Jesuits also came,
performed sundry exorcisms without much success, noted which way the
wind of public opinion blew, and likewise beat a retreat.

But the monks, the Capuchins above all, were so deeply involved that
only one course was left them, to save their own skins by inspiring
terror in their neighbours. They laid cunning snares to catch the
stout-hearted *Bailli* and his lady, whom they would fain have ruined
and so stifled any retributive measures on the part of justice. Lastly,
they urged the Commission to press the case against Grandier to a
conclusion. Things were at a standstill, even their allies the nuns
failing them at this crisis. After their fearful orgy of carnal frenzy
and their shameless cries for human blood, two or three of them had
swooned away, and filled with a sick disgust at their own vileness,
became a horror and a loathing to themselves. In spite of the awful fate
they must expect if they spoke out, in spite of the certainty of ending
in a dungeon, <span id="fr_71"></span>[6](#fn_71.md) they openly declared
within the church walls that they were lost souls, that they had played
into the Devil's hands, that Grandier was an innocent man.

They ruined themselves, but did nothing to stop the course of events;
and a general protest addressed by the town to the King was equally
unavailing. Grandier was condemned to be burned (August 18th, 1634). So
savage was his enemies’ temper

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

that before he went to the stake, they insisted on a second application
of the needle to every part of his body in search of the Devil's mark.
One of the judges would actually have liked his nails to be torn off,
but the surgeon refused.

His persecutors dreaded the final scene and the victim's last words from
the scaffold. Having found among his papers a written argument against
the celibacy of the clergy, the same men who had pronounced him a
Sorcerer, now thought him a freethinker. They remembered the bold words
the martyrs of freedom of thought had hurled at their judges’ heads,
recalling the last, tremendous words of Giordano Bruno <span

arranged a compromise with Grandier. He was told that, if he kept a
judicious silence, he should be spared the flames and should be
strangled before the pile was kindled. The weak priest, a man of the
flesh, yielded yet another and a last concession to the feeble flesh,
and promised not to speak. He never opened his lips either on the road
to his death or on the scaffold itself. Then when they saw him securely
tied to the stake, everything ready and the embers so arranged as to
wrap him swiftly in flame and smoke, a monk, his own confessor, without
waiting for the executioner, set light to the faggots. The deluded
victim had only time to exclaim, "Ah, you have cheated me!" before the
rolling smoke rose round him and through the furnace of his torment only
his shrieks were audible.

Richelieu in his *Memoirs* passes lightly over the affair, being
evidently ashamed of the whole matter. He leaves it to be understood
that he acted according to the reports supplied him, following the voice
of public opinion in what he did. But there can be no doubt that by
subsidising the exorcists, by giving the rein to the Capuchins’ violence
and ensuring their triumph throughout the country, he had directly
encouraged knavery and imposture. Gauffridi, whose rôle had been
recreated by Grandier, is

soon to appear once more under still fouler circumstances in the affair
of Louviers.

This very year of 1634 the devils, driven out of Poitou, appear in
Normandy, copying and recopying the old absurdities of La Sainte-Baume,
devoid equally of originality, fresh initiative, and creative
imagination. The wild, fierce Leviathan of Provence, as travestied at
Loudun, has lost his southern verve, and can only conclude the affair by
making nuns and virgins speak volubly the vile language of the Cities of
the Plain. Alas! presently, at Louviers, he will lose even this much of
his old audacity; we shall find him succumbing to the heaviness of the
northern atmosphere and growing a poor, mean-spirited creature of tricks
and subterfuges.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[192:2](sor21.htm#fr_67.md) A very old doctrine,
which reappears frequently in the Middle Ages. In the seventeenth
century it is common in the French and Spanish cloisters, nowhere more
clearly and naively expressed than in the lessons of a Normandy angel to
a nun, reported in the papers relating to the Louviers affair (see
following chapter). The angel teaches the nun in the first place
"contempt for the body and indifference to the flesh. So much did Jesus
despise the flesh that He exposed it naked to flagellation and open to
the eyes of all men. . . ." He teaches her "complete abandonment of soul
and will, holy, blessed, purely passive obedience; for example, the
Blessed Virgin, who feared not Gabriel, but obeyed, and conceived. . . .
Herein she exposed herself to no risk. For a spirit can cause no
impurity. Quite the contrary, he purifies." At Louviers this noble
doctrine was in the ascendant as early as 1623, and was taught
systematically by a confessor of ripe age and well-supported authority,
Father David by name. The gist of his teaching was "to kill sin by sin,
the better to return to a state of innocence. This is what our first
parents did." Esprit de Bosroger (Capuchin), *La Piété affligée* (Piety
Afflicted), 1645; pp. 167, 171, 173, 174, 181, 189, 190, 196.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[193:3](sor21.htm#fr_68.md) The work entitled
*L’Histoire des diables de Loudun* (History of the Devils of Loudun), by
the Protestant Aubin, is a serious and painstaking book, and its
statements are confirmed by the Official Reports even of Laubardemont.
On the contrary, Tranquille's book is a grotesque production. The
*Procédure* is in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris. M. Figuier has
given a lengthy and excellent account of the whole matter (*Histoire du
merveilleux*,—History of the Miraculous). I am, as the sequel will show,
against the judges, but by no means in favour of the condemned. It is
absurd to make a martyr of him, out of dislike for Richelieu. The fact
is he was a fool, a fop, and libertine, who deserved, not the stake, but
imprisonment for life.

addressed to his judges after hearing his sentence pronounced, were:
"This sentence, delivered in the name of a God of mercy, is perhaps more
a cause of fear to you than to me." He was burned at the stake at Rome,
February 17th, 1600.
