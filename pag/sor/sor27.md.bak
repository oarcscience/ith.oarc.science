### EPILOGUE

A WOMAN of genius, in a very noble burst of enthusiasm, represents
herself as seeing the two spirits, whose mutual struggle made the Middle
Ages, coming at last to an understanding, drawing together, uniting.
Examining one another at nearer hand, they discover, late in the day it
may be, traces of kinship between them. What if they were brothers, and
their age-long strife nothing more than a misunderstanding? The heart
speaks, and they are melted. The proud and gallant outlaw, the
tenderhearted persecutor, forgetting the embittered past, spring forward
eagerly to throw themselves into each other's arms (George Sand,
*Consuelo*).

Amiable fancy of a great-souled woman; and others too have entertained
the same beautiful dream. The gentle Montanelli wrote a fine poem
embodying the notion. Indeed, who would not welcome the alluring hope of
seeing the combat here below end in peace and a reconciliation so
touching?

What thinks the wise bard Merlin <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101.md)
on the point? In the mirror of his lake, whose depth he alone can plumb,
what has he seen? What has he to say in the colossal *épopée* he gave us
in 1860? <span id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_102.md) That Satan, if he disarm,
will do so only on the Day of Judgment. Then, and not till then,
pacified at last, both powers will repose side by side in one common
death.

Doubtless it is not difficult, by a travesty of their true nature, to
arrive at a compromise. The exhaustion of long-continued struggles, by
enervating every fibre, makes way for certain combinations. The last
chapter showed us two shadows agreeing to make covenant in falsehood;
the shadow of Satan, the

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

shadow of Jesus, rendering little services one to the other, the devil
posing as friend of Loyola, pious enthusiasm and diabolic possession
going hand in hand, hell melted in the Sacred Heart!

These are mild times of ours, and hate far less virulent. Nowadays
indeed men's animosity is pretty well confined to their friends. I have
seen Methodists admire the Jesuits. I have seen those whom the Church
throughout the Middle Ages brands as sons of Satan, whether legists or
physicians, making prudent compact with the old vanquished spirit.

But, leaving mere fancies on one side, let us ask, Those who seriously
expect Satan to come to terms and agree to peace, have they really
weighed the problem involved?

The obstacle is not any surviving rancour. The dead are dead; the
millions of victims, Albigensians, Vaudois, Protestants, Moors, Jews,
American Indians, sleep in peace. The standing martyr of the Middle
Ages, the Sorceress, says no word; her ashes are scattered to the winds.

Well, what is it, can you say, that protests, what is the solid barrier
that divides the two spirits, and bars their coming together? It is a
prodigious reality that has taken shape in the last five hundred
years,—that Titanic work the Church has declared accursed, the vast
edifice of the sciences and of modern institutions which she
excommunicated stone by stone, but which each anathema only made more
imposing and raised higher by yet another story. Is there one science
you can name that was not originally a revolt against authority?

There is only one way to reconcile the two spirits and unite the two
Churches. This is to demolish the new one, the one which, from its
earliest beginnings, was declared sinful and damnable. Let us destroy,
if we can, all the sciences of nature, demolish the observatory, the
museum, the botanic garden, the school of medicine, every library of
modern books. Let us burn our legal enactments and our codes. Let us go
back to the Canon Law.

These novelties, one and all, were Satanic; no progress ever made but
was his guilty work.

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

The same wicked logician it was who, heedless of clerical law, preserved
and refashioned that of the philosophers and Jesuits, based on the
impious doctrine of Free Will.

The same dangerous magician it was who, while Churchmen were disputing
about the sex of angels and the like sublime questions, stuck
obstinately to facts and created chemistry and physics and mathematics.
Yes! Mathematics no less than the rest had to be begun afresh,—another
revolt against authority, for had not men been burned for saying, three
make three, and not One?

Medicine above all was truly and indeed Satanic, a revolt against
disease, the merited scourge of an offended God. Plainly a sinful act to
stay the soul on its road towards heaven and replunge it in the life of
this world!

How expiate all this? How suppress and rage to earth this accumulated
pile of successive revolts, which to-day constitutes the whole of modern
life? To re-enter the path of the angels, will Satan undo this great
work? Never! for it rests on three eternal foundation-stones,—Reason,
Right, and Nature.

 

So triumphantly victorious is the new spirit, it clean forgets its
previous struggles, and scarcely deigns to-day to give a thought to its
own triumph. It has been no useless task to recall the pitifulness of
its earliest beginnings, the humble shapes, so rough and barbarous, so
cruelly grotesque, it assumed in the days of persecution, when a woman,
the unhappy Sorceress, gave the first impetus to its scientific and
popular vogue. Bolder far than the heretic, the doubting half-Christian,
the man of knowledge who still kept one foot within the sacred circle,
she eagerly fled from such constraints, and free on the free soil,
strove to build herself an altar of the rude wild boulders of
untrammelled nature.

She perished in her turn, as she was bound to do. But how? Mainly by the
progress of those very sciences she first originated, by the hands of
the physician, the naturalist, for whom she had worked so well.

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

The Sorceress has perished for ever, but not so the fairy. She will
appear afresh under this form, which is immortal.

Woman, busied during the later centuries with men's affairs, has in
requital lost her own true rôle,—that of *healing*, and *consoling*,
that of the fairy that restores to health and happiness.

This is her true priestesshood,—hers by right divine, no matter what the
Church may have said to the contrary.

With her delicate organs, her love of the finest detail, her tender
appreciation of life, she is called to be its quick-eyed confidante in
every science of observation. With her gentle heart and sweet pity, her
instinctive kindness, she is a heaven-sent healer. Sick folk and
children are very much alike; both need a woman to tend them.

She will pursue the sciences, and bring into their domain gentleness and
humanity, like a smile on Nature's face.

Anti-Nature pales in death; and the day is not far off when her final
setting will mark a dawn of blessed augury to mankind.

 

The gods wane, but not God. Quite otherwise; the more they wane, the
more He waxes strong. He resembles an eclipsing light, that after each
period of obscuration only shines out the brighter.

It is a good sign to see these things openly discussed, in the
newspapers even. The feeling is taking root that all questions go back
to the great fundamental and sovereign questions—education,
organisation, the child, the woman. Such is God, and such the world.

All this proclaims the times are ripe.

 

So near is it, this religious dayspring, that again and again I thought
I saw it dawning in the desert where I have completed this book of mine.

How bright and sunlit, how rugged and how lovely my desert home is! My
nest was perched on a rock in the great roads of Toulon, in a humble
villa, amid aloes and cypresses, cactuses

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

and wild roses. In front, this vast basin of flashing sea; behind, the
bare amphitheatre, where might sit at ease the States General of the
world.

The countryside is quite African in general aspect, and has a steely
splendour by day that dazzles the eyes. But on winter mornings,
especially in December, the spot was full of divine mystery. I used to
rise exactly at six, when the Arsenal gun gives the signal to begin
work. From six to seven I enjoyed an entrancing hour. The keen, *steely*
(if this is a permissible expression) scintillation of the stars put the
moon to shame and stood out against the coming dawn. Before the day
broke, and afterwards during the struggle between the two lights, the
extraordinary translucency of the air allowed me to see and hear at
incredible distances. I could make out every object at two leagues away.
The smallest details of the distant mountains, trees, rocks, houses,
contours of surfaces, all showed up with the most delicate and precise
definition. My senses seemed multiplied, and I felt myself a new being,
free, winged, emancipated. The moment was one of crystal clearness, of
an austere beauty and infinite purity! . . . Involuntarily I would find
myself exclaiming, "How now! can it be I am still a man?"

An intangible shade of blue—a blue the rosy dawn as yet respected and
did not dare disturb, a holy ether, a sublimated spirit—made all Nature
spiritual.

But a subtle change was in progress, a gradual, a gentle transformation
could be felt approaching. A mighty marvel was at hand, soon to demolish
and eclipse these quiet beauties. The impending transformation, the
expected glories of the day, detracted nothing from the charm of being
yet in the *divine night*, of lurking half-hid in the half-light, still
enwrapped in the same enchanted wonderland. . . . Come, Sun! We stand
all ready with our adorations, yet would fain enjoy yet another, a last,
moment of waking dreams. . . .

The Sun is rising. . . . Let us await his coming in good hope and
thoughtful reverence.
