The Witch-Cult in Western Europe was the first book in which Margaret
Murray developed her controversial literal interpretation of the Witch
trial evidence. This work is of importance because it is a source-book
of the Witch trials, with extensive quotes from the original documents,
presented in the original Elizabethan English, French and German. The
names of hundreds of accused witches are given in an appendix, a somber
roll call of the 'burning times.' The main body of this work aims to
show that the consistent narrative of the cult is evidence of a
wide-spread, underground pagan religion existing in Europe up through
the Renaissance. Murray, as if not having stirred things up enough, adds
appendices with her controversial take on the Fairies, Joan of Arc and
Gilles de Rais, as well as one truly dangerous recipe. This book is one
of those crucial works which every scholar of Neopaganism must come to
terms with, one way or another.<span class="small">--J.B. Hare, April
