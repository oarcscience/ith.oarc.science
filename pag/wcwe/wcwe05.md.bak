# V. THE RITES

## 1. General

THE exact order of the ceremonies is never given and probably varied in
different localities, but the general rule of the ritual at the Sabbath
seems to have been that proceedings began by the worshippers paying
homage to the Devil, who sat or stood in a convenient place. The homage
consisted in renewing the vows of fidelity and obedience, in kissing the
Devil on any part of his person that he chose to indicate, and sometimes
in turning a certain number of times widdershins. Then followed the
reports of all magic worked since the previous Sabbath, either by
individuals or at the Esbats, and at the same time the witches consulted
the Master as to their cases and received instructions from him how to
proceed; after which came admissions to the society or marriages of the
members. This ended the business part of the meeting. Immediately after
all the business was transacted, the religious service was celebrated,
the ceremonial of which varied according to the season of the year; and
it was followed by the 'obscene' fertility rites. The whole ceremony
ended with feasting and dancing, and the assembly broke up at dawn.

This was apparently the usual course of the ritual of the Sabbath; the
Esbat had less ceremonial, and the religious service was not performed.
The Devil himself often went round and collected the congregation; and,
not being in his 'grand arroy', he appeared as a man in ordinary dress.
Instead of the religious service with the adoration of the god, the
witches worked the spells and charms with which they bewitched or
unbewitched their enemies and friends, or they exercised new methods
which they learnt from their Master, or received instructions how to
practise the arts of healing and secret poisoning, of causing and
blasting fertility.

There are a few general accounts of the usual course of the Sabbath
ritual. Danaeus (1575) does not distinguish clearly between the two
classes of meetings, but at the same time he seems to have realized that
a certain order was followed:

'Satan calleth them togither into a Diuelish Sinagoge, and that he may
also vnderstand of them howe well and diligently they haue fulfilled
their office of intoxicating committed vnto them, and whõ they haue
slaine wherefore they meete togither in certen apointed places . . .
Whe\[n\] they meete together he appeareth visibly vnto them in sundrie
fourmes, as the head and chiefe of that congregation. . . . Then doe
they all repeate the othe which they haue geuen vnto him, in
acknowledging him to be their God, the\[n\] fal they to dauncing . . .
Whiche beeing all finished, then he demaundeth agayne of them what they
woulde require of him. . . . Vnto some he geueth poysons ready made, and
others he teacheth howe to make and mingle new. . . . Finally, if in any
thing they neede his presence and helpe, by couenant he promiseth to be
present with them.'\[1\]

Boguet (1589) is more exact, as he obtained his knowledge at first hand:

'Les Sorciers estans assemblez en leur Synagogue adorent premierement
Satan . . . ils luy offrent des chandelles, & le baisent aux parties
honteuses de derriere. Quelquefois encor il tient vne image noire, qu'il
faut baiser aux Sorciers. . . . Les Sorciers en second lieu dansent. . .
. Les danses finies, les Sorciers viennent à s'accoupler. . . . Les
Sorciers, apres s'estre veautrez parmy les plaisirs immondes de la
chair, banquettent & se festoient. . . . Les Sorciers rendent conte à
Satan de ce qu'ils ont fait dés la derniere assemblée. . . . Il fait
renoncer de nouueau à ces miserables, Dieu, Chresme, & Baptesme. Il leur
fait rafraischir le serment solennel qu'ils ont fait.'\[2\]

The English account is put together from foreign sources to a great
extent:

'They are carryed out of the house, either by the Window, Door, or
Chimney, mounted on their Imps. . . . Thus brought to the designed
place, they find a great number of others arrived there by the same
means: who, before Lucifer takes his place in his throne as King, do
make their accustomed homage, Adoring, and Proclaiming him their Lord,
and rendring him all Honour. This Solemnity being finished, they sit to
Table where no delicate meats are wanting. . . . At the sound of many
pleasant Instruments the table is taken away, and the pleasant consort
invites them to a Ball. . . . At

\[1. Danaeus, ch. iv.

2\. Boguet, pp. 131-9.\]

the last, the lights are put out. The Incubus's in the shape of proper
men satisfy the desires of the Witches, and the Succubus's serve for
whores to the Wizards. At last before Aurora brings back the day, each
one mounts on his spirit, and so returns to his respective dwelling
place. . . . Sometimes at their solemn assemblies, the Devil commands,
that each tell what wickedness he hath committed. . . . When the
assembly is ready to break up, and the Devil to dispatch them, he
publisheth this law with a loud voice, *Revenge your selves or else you
shall dye*, then each one kissing the Posteriors of the Devil returns
upon their aiery Vehicles to their habitations.'\[1\]

## 2. Homage

In some places the witches saluted their Chief by falling on their
knees, and also by certain manual gestures; in other places by curtsies
and obeisances. In Scotland, France, and Belgium, another rite was also
in vogue, that of kissing the Devil on any part of his person that he
might direct. At Como and Brescia the witches, 'when they paid reverence
to the presiding demon, bent themselves backwards, lifting a foot in the
air forwards.'\[2\]

Remigius, writing of the Lorraine witches in 1589, says:

'Es erzehlte die Beatrix Bayona dass einer unter ihnen allen der
Oberster wer, welcher in einer Zell auff einem lichen Stuhl sässe, sehr
ernsthafftig und prächtig heraus, zu demselbigen trete je einer nach dem
andern, mit Furcht und Zittern, falle ihm zum Zeichen seiner
Ehrerbietung für die Füsse, und umbfange ihn mit aller Demuth und
Reverentz.--Erstlich fallen sie nieder auff ihre Knie; darnach legen sie
die Hände ausswendig zusammen, als diejenigen pflegen zu thun, welche
obtestiren, jedoch auff dem Rücken und verkehrter Weise, sie haben den
Rücken zu ihm gewandt, bleiben so lang kniend, biss er selbsten zu ihnen
sagt, class es genugsam sey.'\[3\]

In Somerset (1664) the witches always mention the salutation:

'At their first meeting the Man in black bids them welcome, and they all
make low obeysance to him.--\[Elizabeth Style, Alice Duke, Anne Bishop,
Mary Penny\] met about nine of the Clock in the Night, in the Common
near *Trister* Gate,

\[1. *Pleasant Treatise*, pp. 5-7.

2\. Lea, iii, p. 501.

3\. Remigius, pt. i, pp. 89, 91.\]

where they met a Man in black Clothes with a little Band, to whom they
did Courtesie and due observance.--Mary Green \[went with others to\]
Hussey's Knap in the Forrest in the Night time, where met them the Fiend
in the shape of a little Man in black Clothes with a little band, to him
all made obeysances. . . . On Thursday Night before Whitsunday last
\[she met several others\] and being met they called out *Robin*. Upon
which instantly appeared a little Man in black Clothes to whom all made
obeysance, and the little Man put his hand to his Hat, saying, How do
ye? speaking *low* but *big*. Then all made low obeysances to him
again.'\[1\]

As late as the eighteenth century there is a similar account.

Danaeus (1575) and Cooper (1617) are the only writers who mention the
kiss in their general accounts of the ceremonies. The former says: 'Then
biddeth lie the\[m\] that they fall down & worship him, after what
matter and gesture of body he pleaseth, and best liketh of. Thus some of
them falle downe at his knees, some offre vnto him black burning cãdles,
other kisse him in some part of his body where he appeareth
visibly.'\[3\] Cooper mentions it as part of the admission ceremony:
'Secondly, when this acknowledgement is made, in testimoniall of this
subiection, Satan offers his back-parts to be kissed of his
vassall.'\[4\]

The ceremony is one of the earliest of which there is any record. In
1303 a Bishop of Coventry was accused at Rome of a number of crimes,
amongst others 'quod diabolo homagium fecerat, et eum fuerit osculatus
in tergo'.\[1\] Guillaume Edeline was tried in 1453; he was 'docteur en
théologie, prieur de S. Germain en Laye, et auparavant Augustin, et
religieux de certaines aultres ordres. Confessa ledit sire Guillaume, de
sa bonne et franche voulenté, avoir fait hommage audit ennemy en
l'espèce et semblance d'ung mouton, en le baisant par le fondement en
signe de révérence et d'hommage.'\[6\] Martin Tulouff, tried in Guernsey
in 1563, went to a meeting, 'ou ly avoet chinq ou vi chatz, d'ou il y en
avoet ung qui estoit noir, qui menoit la dance, et d<sup>t</sup> q il
estoit sur ses pieds plat, et que ladite Collennette le besa p de
derriere, et luy p la crysse.

Et luy dist ladite vieillesse q ledit chat estoit le diable.'\[1\]
Estebène de Cambrue, in 1567, described the ceremonies at the Sabbath:
'Ils se mettent à dancer à l'entour d'une pierre, sur laquelle est assis
vn grand homme noir, qu'elles appellent Mõsieur, & chacun de l'assemblee
luy va baiser le derriere.'\[2\] The witches of Poictiers in 1574
'dansoyent à l'entour du bouc: puis vn chacun luy baisoit le
derriere'.\[3\] The same ceremony took place at North Berwick in 1590:
'Now efter that the deuell had endit his admonitions, he cam down out of
the pulpit, and caused all the company to com and kiss his ers, quhilk
they said was cauld lyk yce.'\[4\] Jane Bosdeau confessed that at
meetings at Puy-de-Dôme in 1594 'all the Witches had Candles which they
lighted at his, and danced in a Circle Back to Back. They kiss'd his
Backside, and pray'd that he would help them.'\[5\] Andro Man of
Aberdeen in 1597 confessed 'that all thay quha convenis with thame
kissis Christsonday and the Quene of Elphenis airss'.\[1\] Rolande de
Vernois in 1598 'confessa que le Diable se presenta pour lors au Sabbat
en forme d'vn gros chat noir. Que tous ceux, qui estoient au Sabbat,
alloient baiser ce gros chat noir au derriere.'\[7\] Cornélie van
Beverwyck, aged 75, at Ghent in 1598, was accused that 'vous n'avez pas
craint de vous agenouiller devant lui, de lui rendre hommage et de
baiser son derriere en signe de soumission'.\[1\] Claire Goessen in 1603
went to 'l'assemblée nocturne de Lembeke, où, après la danse, elle a,
comme tous les assistans, baisé un bouc à l'endroit de sa queue'.\[9\]
Jeannette d'Abadie in 1609 in the Basses-Pyrénées said, regarding the
renunciation which she made on admission, 'il luy faisoit renouueller
toutes les fois qu'elle alloit au sabbat, puis elle l'alloit baiser au
derriere.'\[10\] At the celebrated trial of Louis Gaufredy at Aix in
1610, Magdalene de Demandouls gave a detailed account of the homage
rendered by the witches:

'First the hagges and witches, who are people of a sordid and base
condition, are the first that come to adore the Prince of the Synagogue,
who is Lucifers lieftenant, and he that now holdeth that place is Lewes
Gaufridy: then they adore the Princesse of the Synagogue who is a woman
placed at his right hand. Next they goe and worship the Diuell who is
seated in a Throne like a Prince. In the second place come the Sorcerers
and Sorceresses, who are people of a middle condition, and these
performe the same kind of adoration with the former, kneeling vpon the
ground, but not prostrating themselves as doe the other; although they
kisse the hands and feet of the Diuell as the first likewise doe. In the
third place come the Magicians who are Gentlemen and people of a higher
ranke.'\[1\]

Isobel Gowdie of Auldearne in 1662 said, 'Somtym he vold be lyk a stirk,
a bull, a deir, a rae, or a dowg, and he vold hold wp his taill wntill
we wold kiss his arce.'\[2\] The explanation of this rite is given in
the French authorities:

'Le Diable estoit en forme de bouc, ayant vne queue, & au dessoubs vn
visage d'homme noir, où elle fut contrainte le baiser.--\[Elle\] depose,
Que la premiere fois qu'elle luy fut presentee elle le baisa à ce visage
de derriere au dessoubs d'vne grande queuë: qu'elle l'y a baisé par
trois fois, & qu'il auoit aussi ce visage faict comme le museau d'vn
bouc.--Il a vne grande queuë au derriere, & vne forme de visage au
dessoubs: duquel visage il ne profere aucune parole, ains luy sert pour
le donner à baiser à ceux qui bon luy semble.--Es festes solemnelles on
baisoit le Diable au derriere, mais les notables sorcieres le baisoient
au visage.'\[3\] The two faces are thus distinctly vouched for, and the
use of them seems to have been to distinguish the position of the witch
in the society. The mask or disguise is clearly indicated in the
evidence of Isaac de Queyron, who with others 'le baiserent á vne fesse
qui estoit blanche & rouge, & auoit la forme d'vne grande cuisse d'vn
homme, & estoit velue'.\[4\]

The Devil was also kissed on other parts of his person. Marion Grant of
the Aberdeen witches (1597) confessed that he 'causit the kis him in
dyvers pairtis, and worship him on thy kneis as thy lord'.\[5\] Some of
the Lyons witches 'le baiserent aux parties honteuses de derriere: les
autres le

baisent sur l'espaule.'\[1\] Jeannette d'Abadie in the Basses-Pyrénées
(1609) confessed 'que le Diable luy faisoit baiser son visage, puis le
nombril, puis le membre viril, puis son derriere'.\[2\] In connexion
with this last statement, it is worth comparing Doughty's account of an
Arab custom: 'There is a strange custom, (not only of nomad women, but
in the Arabic countries even among Christians, which may seem to remain
of the old idolatry among them,) of mothers, their gossips, and even
young maidens, visiting married women to kiss with a kind of devotion
the *hammam* of the male children.'\[3\]

## 2. The Dances

Dances as an important part of fertility rites are too well known to
need description. The witches' dances, taken in conjunction with the
dates of the four great Sabbaths of the year, point to the fact that
they also were intended to promote fertility. There were several forms
of ritual dances, varying apparently according to the form of fertility
required, whether of crops, animals, or human beings. The jumping dance
seems to have had for its object the growth of the crops; the higher the
performers jumped the higher the crops would grow. The so-called
'obscene' or 'indecent' dance was for the promotion of fertility among
animals and women. When the dancers were disguised as animals, the dance
was for the increase of the animals represented; when undisguised, for
the fertility of human beings.

Although the dances took place at English witch meetings, they are
merely mentioned and not described. The Scotch trials give rather fuller
accounts, but the chief details are from France.

The two principal forms of the dance were the ring-dance and the
follow-my-leader dance, but there was also a very complicated form which
was not understood by the Inquisitors, who therefore dismiss it with the
words 'tout est en confusion'. It still survives, however, in the
Basses-Pyrénées, in some of the very villages which were inhabited by
witches in the

\[1. Boguet, p. 131.

2\. De Lancre, *Tableau*, pp. 721 131

3\. Doughty, *Travels in Arabia Deserta*, i, 89.\]

sixteenth century--those witches whose proceedings de Lancre describes
so vividly.\[1\]

The ring dances were usually round some object; sometimes a stone,
sometimes the Devil stood or was enthroned in the middle. Thomas Leyis,
with a great number of other witches, 'came to the Market and Fish Cross
of Aberdeen, under the conduct and guiding of the Devil present with
you, all in company, playing before you on his kind of instruments: Ye
all danced about both the said crosses, and the meal market, a long
space of time; in the which Devil's dance, thou the said Thomas was
foremost and led the ring, and dang the said Kathren Mitchell, because
she spoiled your dance, and ran not so fast about as the rest. Testified
by the said Kathrein Mitchell, who was present with thee at the time
forsaid dancing with the Devil.'\[2\] Margaret Og was indicted for going
to Craigleauch 'on Hallow even last, and there, accompanied by thy own
two daughters, and certain others, your devilish adherents and
companions, ye danced all together, about a great stone, under the
conduct of Satan, your master, a long space'.\[3\] Jonet Lucas was
accused of 'danceing in ane ring' on the same occasion.\[4\] Beatrice
Robbie was 'indited as a notorious witch, in coming, under the conduct
of the Devil thy master, with certain others, thy devilish adherents, to
Craigleauche, and there dancing altogether about a great stone, a long
space, and the Devil your master playing before you'.\[5\] In the
Basses-Pyrénées, 'Ils se mettent à dancer à l'entour d'une pierre, qui
est plantée audit lieu, sur laquelle est assis un grand homme
noir.'\[6\] Jane Bosdeau, who 'confessed freely and without Torture and
continued constant in it in the midst of the Flames in which she was
burnt', said that she had been to a witch-meeting, 'and danced in a
circle back to back'.\[7\]

'Les Sorciers dansent, & font leurs danses en rond, doz contre doz. Les
boiteux y vont plus dispostement que les

autres \[et\] incitoient les autres à sauter & danser.\[1\] . . .
Quelquefois, mais rarement, ils dansent deux à deux, & par fois l'vn çà
& l'autre là, & tousiours en confusion: estans telles danses semblables
à celles des Fées, vrais Diables incorporez, qui regnoient il n'y a pas
lõg temps.'\[2\] 'On y dance tousiours le dos tourné au centre de la
dance, qui faict que les filles sont si accoutumées à porter les mains
en arriere en cette dãce ronde, qu'elles y trainent tout le corps, & luy
donnent vn ply courbé en arriere, ayant les bras à demy tournez: si bien
que la plupart ont le ventre communement grand, enfIé & avancé, & vn peu
penchant sur le deuant. On y dance fort peu souuent vn à vn, c'est à
dire vn homme seul auec vne femme ou fille. . . . On n'y dançoit que
trois sortes de bransles, communement se tournant les espaules l'vn à
l'autre, & le dos d'vn chascun visant dans le rond de la dance, & le
visage en dehors. La premiere c'est à la Bohemienne . . . La seconde
c'est à sauts; ces deux sont en rond.'\[3\] 'Ils apperceurent à l'entrée
\[d'vn bois\], vn rond, ou cerne, dans lequel il y auoit plusieurs
vestiges de pieds d'hom\[m\]es, d'e\[n\]fans, & d'Ours, ou bien d'autres
bestes semblables,\[4\] lesquels estoient seulement enfoncez d'vn demy
doigt dans la neige, quoy que pour eux ils y entrassent iusques à la
ceinture.'\[5\]

The Swedish witches danced in the same manner. I We used to go to a
gravel pit which lay hard by a cross-way, and there we put on a garment
over our heads, and then danced round.''\[6\] The round dance was so
essentially a witch dance that More says, 'It might be here very
seasonable to enquire into the nature of those large *dark Rings* in the
grass, which they call *Fairy Circles*, whether they be the *Rendezvouz*
of Witches, or the dancing places of those little Puppet Spirits which
they call *Elves* or *Fairies*.'\[7\]

It will be seen from the above quotations that there were many varieties
in the ring dance; this was the case also in the follow-my-leader dance.
There seems to have been also a combination of the two dances; or
perhaps it would be more correct to say that sometimes the ring and
follow-my-leader figures were used together so as to form one complete
dance,

as in the modern Lancers. In both forms of the dance one of the chief
members of the society was the 'ring-leader', or leader of the dance. In
the follow-my-leader dance this was often the Devil, but in the ring
dances this place was usually taken by the second in command. When,
however, the Devil was the leader, the second-in-command was in the rear
to keep up those who could not move so quickly as the others. As pace
was apparently of importance, and as it seems to have been a punishable
offence to lag behind in the dance, this is possibly the origin of the
expression 'The Devil take the hindmost'.

At North Berwick Barbara Napier met her comrades at the church, 'where
she danced endlong the Kirk yard, and Gelie Duncan played on a trump,
John Fian, missellit, led the ring; Agnes Sampson and her daughters and
all the rest following the said Barbara, to the number of seven score of
persons." Isobel Gowdie was unfortunately not encouraged to describe the
dances in which she had taken part, so that our information, instead of
being full and precise, is very meagre. 'Jean Martein is Maiden to the
Coven that I am of; and her nickname is "Over the dyke with it", because
the Devil always takes the Maiden in his hand next him, when we dance
Gillatrypes; and when he would loup from \[words broken here\] he and
she will say, "Over the dyke with it."'\[2\] Another Scotch example is
Mr. Gideon Penman, who had been minister at Crighton. He usually 'was in
the rear in all their dances, and beat up all those that were
slow'."\[3\] Barton's wife 'one night going to a dancing upon Pentland
Hills, he \[the Devil\] went before us in the likeness of a rough tanny
Dog, playing on a pair of Pipes'.\[4\] De Lancre concludes his
description of the dances (see above, p. 13 1) by an account of an '
endlong' dance. 'La troisieme est aussi le dos tourné, mais se tenant
tous en long, & sans se deprendre des mains, ils s'approchent de si près
qu'ils se touchent, & se rencontrent dos à dos, vn homme auec vne femme;
& à certaine cadance ils se choquent & frapent impudemment cul contre
cul.'\[5\] It was perhaps this

dance which the Devil led: 'Le Diable voit parfois dancer simplement
comme spectateur; parfois il mene la dance, changeant souuent de main &
se mettant à la main de celles qui luy plaisent le plus.'\[1\] In
Northumberland in 1673 'their particular divell tooke them that did most
evill, and danced with them first.--The devill, in the forme of a little
black man and black cloaths, called of one Isabell Thompson, of Slealy,
widdow, by name, and required of her what service she had done him. She
replyd she had gott power of the body of one Margarett Teasdale. And
after he had danced with her he dismissed her, and call'd of one
Thomasine, wife of Edward Watson, of Slealy." Danaeus also notes that
the Devil was the leader: 'The\[n\] fal they to dauncing, wherin he
leadeth the daunce, or els they hoppe and daunce merely about him.'\[3\]
This is perhaps what de Lancre means when he says that 'apres la dance
ils se mettent par fois à sauter'.\[4\] A curious variation of the
follow-my-leader dance was practised at Aberdeen on Rood Day, a date
which as I have shown elsewhere corresponds with the Walpurgis-Nacht of
the German witches. The meeting took place upon St. Katherine's Hill,
'and there under the conduct of Satan, present with you, playing before
you, after his form, ye all danced a devilish dance, riding on trees, by
a long space.'\[5\]

Other variations are also given. 'The dance is strange, and wonderful,
as well as diabolical, for turning themselves back to back, they take
one another by the arms and raise each other from the ground, then shake
their heads to and fro like Anticks, and turn themselves as if they were
mad.'\[6\] Reginald Scot, quoting Bodin, says: 'At these magicall
assemblies, the witches neuer faile to danse; and in their danse they
sing these words, Har bar, divell divell, danse here danse here, plaie
here plaie here, Sabbath sabbath. And whiles they sing and

graves of the cemetery of Shaizar.' Wellhausen, p. 159.

danse, euerie one hath a broome in hir hand, and holdeth it vp aloft.
Item he saith, that these night-walking or rather night-dansing witches,
brought out of *Italie* into *France*, that danse which is called *La
Volta*.'\[1\] There is also a description of one of the dances of the
Italian witches: 'At Como and Brescia a number of children from eight to
twelve years of age, who had frequented the Sabbat, and had been
re-converted by the inquisitors, gave exhibitions in which their skill
showed that they had not been taught by human art. The woman was held
behind her partner and they danced backward, and when they paid
reverence to the presiding demon they bent themselves backwards, lifting
a foot in the air forwards.'\[2\]

In Lorraine the round dance always moved to the left. As the dancers
faced outwards, this would mean that they moved 'widdershins', i.e.
against the sun. 'Ferner, class sie ihre Täntze in einem ronden Kreiss
rings umbher führen, und die Rücke zusammen gekehret haben, wie eine
unter den dreyen Gratiis pfleget fürgerissen zu werden, und also
zusammen tanzen. Sybilla Morelia sagt, dass der Reyhen allezeit auff der
lincken Hand umbher gehe.'\[3\]

One form of the witches' dance seems to survive among the children in
the Walloon districts of Belgium. It appears to be a mixture of the
ordinary round dance and the third of de Lancre's dances; for it has no
central personage, and the striking of back against back is a marked
feature. 'Les enfants font une ronde et répètent un couplet. Chaque
fois, un joueur désigné fait demi-tour sur place et se remet à tourner
avec les autres en faisant face à l'extérieur du cercle. Quand tous les
joueurs sont retournés, ils se rapprochent et se heurtent le dos en
cadence.'\[4\]

## 4. The Music

The music at the assemblies was of all kinds, both instrumental and
vocal. The English trials hardly mention music, possibly because the
Sabbath had fallen into a decadent condition; but the Scotch and French
trials prove that it was an integral part of the celebration. The Devil
himself was the

waltz.

usual performer, but other members of the society could also supply the
music, and occasionally one person held the position of piper to the
Devil. The music was always as an accompaniment of the dance; the
instrument in general use was a pipe, varied in England by a cittern, in
Scotland by I the trump' or Jew's harp, also an instrument played with
the mouth.

The Somerset witches said that 'the Man in black sometimes playes on a
Pipe or Cittern, and the company dance'.'

The North Berwick witches (1590), when at the special meeting called to
compass the death of the king, 'danced along the Kirk-yeard, Geilis
Duncan playing on a Trump.'\[3\] The instrument of the Aberdeen Devil
(1597), though not specified, was probably a pipe; it is usually called
'his forme of instrument' in the dittays. Isobel Cockie of Aberdeen was
accused of being at a Sabbath on All-hallow Eve: 'Thou wast the
ringleader, next Thomas Leyis; and because the Devil played not so
melodiously and well as thou crewit, thou took his instrument out of his
mouth, then took him on the chaps therewith, and played thyself thereon
to the whole company.'\[3\] At another meeting, Jonet Lucas was present:
'Thou and they was under the conduct of thy master, the Devil, dancing
in ane ring, and he playing melodiously upon ane instrument, albeit
invisibly to you.'\[4\] At Tranent (1659) eight women and a man named
John Douglas confessed to 'having merry meetings with Satan, enlivened
with music and dancing. Douglas was the pyper, and the two favourite
airs of his majesty were "Kilt thy coat, Maggie, and come thy way with
me", and "Hulie the bed will fa'."'\[5\] Agnes Spark at Forfar (1661)
'did see about a dozen of people dancing, and they had sweet music
amongst them, and, as she thought, it was the music of a pipe'.\[6\]
Barton's wife was at a meeting in the Pentland Hills, where the Devil
'went before us in the likeness of a rough tanny Dog, playing on a pair
of Pipes. The

Spring he played (says she) was, 'The silly bit Chiken, gar cast it a
pickle and it will grow meikle.'\[1\] At Crook of Devon (1662) the two
old witches, Margaret Huggon and Janet Paton, confessed to being at a
meeting, and 'the foresaids hail women was there likeways and did all
dance and ane piper play'.\[2\]

In France the instruments were more varied. Marie d'Aspilcouette, aged
nineteen, 'voyoit dancer auec violons, trompettes, ou tabourins, qui
rendoyent vne tres grande harmonie'.\[3\] Isaac de Queyran, aged
twenty-five, said that a minor devil (*diabloton*) played on a
tambourine, while the witches danced.\[4\] But as usual de Lancre is at
his best when making a general summary:

'Elles dancent au son du petit tabourin & de la fluste, & par fois auec
ce long instrument qu'ils posent sur le col, puis s'allongeant
iusqu'auprés de la ceinture; ils le battent auec vn petit baston: par
fois auec vn violon. Mais ce ne sont les seuls instrumès du sabbat, car
nous auõs apprins de plusieurs, qu'on y oyt toute sorte d'instrumens,
auec vne telle harmonie, qu'il n'y a concert au monde qui le puisse
esgaler.'\[5\]

Vocal music was also heard at the meetings, sometimes as an
accompaniment of the dance, sometimes as an entertainment in itself.
When it was sung as a part of the dance, the words were usually
addressed to the Master, and took the form of a hymn of praise. Such a
hymn addressed to the god of fertility would be full of allusions and
words to shock the sensibilities of the Christian priests and ministers
who sat in judgement on the witches. Danaeus gives a general account of
these scenes: 'Then fal they to dauncing, wherin he leadeth the daunce,
or els they hoppe and daunce merely about him, singing most filthy
songes made in his prayse.'\[6\] Sinclair had his account from a
clergyman: 'a reverend Minister told me, that one who was the Devils
Piper, a wizzard confest to him, that at a Ball of dancing, the Foul
Spirit taught him a Baudy song to sing and play, as it were this night,
and ere two days past all the Lads and Lasses of the town were lilting
it throw

the street. It were abomination to rehearse it.'\[1\] At Forfar Helen
Guthrie told the court that Andrew Watson 'made great merriment by
singing his old ballads, and Isobell Shirrie did sing her song called
'Tinkletum Tankletum'.\[2\] Occasionally the Devil himself was the
performer, as at Innerkip, where according to Marie Lamont 'he sung to
us and we all dancit'.\[3\] Boguet notes that the music was sometimes
vocal and sometimes instrumental: 'Les haubois ne manquent pas à ces
esbats: car il y en a qui sont commis à faire le devoir de menestrier;
Satan y iouë mesme de la flutte le plus souuent; & à d'autrefois les
Sorciers se contentent de chanter à la voix, disant toutefois leurs
chansons pesle-mesle, & auec vne confusion telle, qu'ils ne s'entendent
pas les vns les autres.'\[4\] At Aix in 1610 'the Magicians and those
that can reade, sing certaine Psalmes as they doe in the Church,
especially *Laudate Dominum de Coelis: Confitemini domino quoniam
bonus*, and the *Canticle Benedicte*, transferring all to the praise of
Lucifer and the Diuels: And the Hagges and Sorcerers doe houle and vary
their hellish cries high and low counterfeiting a kinde of villanous
musicke. They also daunce at the sound of Viols and other instruments,
which are brought thither by those that were skild to play vpon
them.\[5\] At another French trial in 1652 the evidence showed that 'on
dansait sans musique, aux chansons'.\[6\]

## 5. The Feast

The feast, like the rest of the ritual, varied in detail in different
places. It took place either indoors or out according to the climate and
the season; in Southern France almost invariably in the open air, in
Scotland and Sweden almost always under cover; in England sometimes one,
sometimes the other. Where it was usual to have it in the open, tables
were carried out and the food laid upon them; indoor feasts were always
spread on tables; but in the English accounts of the open-air meal the
cloth was spread, picnic-fashion, on the ground. The food was supplied
in different ways; sometimes

\[1. Sinclair, p. 219.

2\. Kinloch, p. 120.

3\. Sharpe, p. 131.

4\. Boguet, p. 132.

5\. Michaelis, *Hist*., p. 336.

6\. Van Elven, v (1891), p. 215.\]

entirely by the devil, sometimes entirely by one member of the
community, and sometimes-picnic-fashion again-all the company brought
their own provisions. Consequently the quality of the food varied
considerably; on some occasions it was very good, on others very homely.
But no matter who provided it, the thanks of the feasters were solemnly
and reverently given to the Master, to whose power the production of all
food was due.

In a certain number of cases it is said that the food eaten at the
feasts was of an unsatisfying nature. This statement is usually made in
the general descriptions given by contemporary writers; it is rarely
found in the personal confessions. When it does so occur, it is worth
noting that the witch is generally a young girl. If this were always the
case, it would be quite possible that then, as now, dancing and
excitement had a great effect on the appetite, and that the ordinary
amount of food would appear insufficient.

The taboo on salt is interesting, but it does not appear to have been by
any means universal. It does not seem to occur at all in Great Britain,
where the food at the feasts was quite normal.

Some authorities appear to think that the witches ate the best of
everything. 'They sit to Table where no delicate meats are wanting to
gratifie their Appetites, all dainties being brought in the twinckling
of an Eye, by those spirits that attend the Assembly'.\[1\] Though this
is dramatically expressed it is confirmed by the statements of the
witches themselves. The Lancashire witches had a great feast when they
met in Malking Tower to consult as to the rescue of Mother Demdike.

' The persons aforesaid had to their dinners Beefe, Bacon, and roasted
Mutton; which Mutton (as this Examinates said brother said) was of a
Wether of Christopher Swyers of Barley: which Wether was brought in the
night before into this Examinates mothers house by the said lames
Deuice, this Examinates said brother: and in this Examinates sight
killed and eaten. . . . And before their said parting away, they all
appointed to meete at the said Prestons wiues house that day
twelue-moneths; at which time the said Prestons wife promised to make
them a great Feast.'\[2\]

\[1. Pleasant Treatise of Witches, p. 5.

2\. Potts, G 3, 13, P 3.\]

The feast of the Faversham witches was also indoors. 'Joan Cariden
confessed that Goodwife Hott told her within these two daies that there
was a great meeting at Goodwife Panterys house, and that Goodwife Dodson
was there, and that Goodwife Gardner should have been there, but did not
come, and the Divell sat at the upper end of the Table.'\[1\] This was
always the Devil's place at the feast, and beside him sat the chief of
the women witches. The Somerset trials give more detail than any of the
other English cases. Elizabeth Style said that 'at their meeting they
have usually Wine or good Beer, Cakes, Meat or the like. They eat and
drink really when they meet in their bodies, dance also and have Musick.
The Man in black sits at the higher end, and *Anne Bishop* usually next
him. He useth some words before meat, and none after, his voice is
audible, but very low.'\[2\] She enters into a little more detail in
another place: 'They had Wine, Cakes, and Roastmeat (all brought by the
Man in black) which they did eat and drink. They danced and were merry,
and were bodily there, and in their Clothes.'\[3\] Alice Duke gave a
similar account: 'All sate down, a white Cloth being spread on the
ground, and did drink Wine, and eat Cakes and Meat.'\[4\] The Scotch
trials show that it was usually the witches who entertained the Master
and the rest of the band. Alison Peirson, whose adventures among the
fairies are very interesting, stated that a man in green 'apperit to
hir, ane lustie mane, with mony mene and wemen with him: And that scho
sanit her and prayit, and past with thame fordir nor scho could tell;
and saw with thame pypeing and mirrynes and gude scheir, and wes careit
to Lowtheane, and saw wyne punchounis with tassis with thame'.\[5\] On
another occasion a very considerable meeting took place 'in an old house
near Castle Semple, where a splendid feast was prepared, which pleased
the royal visitor so much, that he complimented his entertainers for
their hospitality, and endearingly addressed them as "his bairns"'.\[6\]
The Forfar witches had many feasts; Helen Guthrie says of one occasion:

\[1. *Examination of Joan Williford*, p. 6.

2\. Glanvil, pt. ii, pp. 139-40.

3\. Id., p. 138.

4\. Id., p. 149.

6\. *Spottiswoode Misc*., ii, p. 67.\]

They went to Mary Rynd's house and sat doune together at the table, the
divell being present at the head of it; and some of them went to Johne
Benny's house, he being a brewer, and brought ale from hence . . . and
others of them went to Alexander Hieche's and brought aqua vitae from
thence, and thus made themselfes mirrie; and the divill made much of
them all, but especiallie of Mary Rynd, and he kist them all except the
said Helen herselfe, whose hand onlie he kist; and shee and Jonet Stout
satt opposite one to another at the table.'\[1\]

Of the meeting at Muryknowes there are several accounts. The first is by
little Jonet Howat, Helen Guthrie's young daughter: 'At this meiting
there wer about twenty persones present with the divill, and they
daunced togither and eat togither, having bieff, bread, and ale, and
shoe did eat and drink with them hir self, bot hir bellie was not
filled, and shoe filled the drink to the rest of the company.'\[2\]
Elspet Alexander confirms this statement, 'The divill. and the witches
did drinke together having flesh, bread, and aile';\[3\] and so also
does the Jonet Stout who sat opposite to Helen Guthrie at the table,
'The divill and the said witches did eat and drinke, having flesh,
bread, and aile upon ane table, and Joanet Huit was caper and filled the
drinke'.\[1\] On one occasion they tried to wreck the Bridge of
Cortaquhie; 'when we had done, Elspet \[Bruce\] gaive the divell ane
goose in hir own house, and he dated hir mor than them all, because shee
was ane prettie wornan.'\[5\] The Kinross-shire witches obtained their
food from the Devil, and this is one of the few instances of complaints
is to the quality of it. 'Sathan gave you \[Robert Wilson\] both meat
and drink sundry times, but it never did you any good';\[6\] and Janet
Brugh 'confessed that ye got rough bread and sour drink from Sathan at
the Bents of Balruddrie'.\[7\] According to Marie Lamont, 'the devill.
came to Kattrein Scott's house, in the midst of the night. He gave them
wyn to drink, and wheat bread to eat, and they warr all very
mirrie.'\[8\] Isobel Gowdie's confession gives a wealth of detail as
usual:

'We would go to several houses in the night time. We

were at Candlemas last in Grangehill, where we got meat and drink
enough. The Devil sat at the head of the table, and all the Coven about.
That night he desired Alexander Elder in Earlseat to say the grace
before meat, which he did; and is this:\[1\] "We eat this meat in the
Devil's name " \[etc.\]. And then we began to eat. And when we had ended
eating, we looked steadfastly to the Devil, and bowing ourselves to him,
we said to the Devil, We thank thee, our Lord, for this.--We killed an
ox, in Burgie, about the dawing of the day, and we brought the ox with
us home to Aulderne, and did eat all amongst us in an house in Aulderne,
and feasted on it.'\[2\]

At Borrowstowness the witches went to different houses for their feasts,
which seem to have been supplied partly by the hostess, partly by the
Devil and the guests.

'Ye and each person of you was at several meetings with the devil in the
links of Borrowstowness, and in the house of you Bessie Vickar, and ye
did eat and drink with the devil, and with one another, and with witches
in her house in the night time; and the devil and the said William Craw
brought the ale which ye drank, extending to about seven gallons, from
the house of Elizabeth Hamilton.'\[3\]

In 1692 Goodwife Foster of Salem gave a rather charming description of
the picnic feast with the Coven from Andover:

'I enquired what she did for Victuals' \[at the meeting\]; 'She answered
that she carried Bread and Cheese in her pocket, and that she and the
Andover Company came to the Village before the Meeting began, and sat
down together under a tree, and eat their food, and that she drank water
out of a Brook to quench her thirst.'\[4\]

The Continental evidence varies very little from the British. Except in
a few details, the main facts are practically the same. De Lancre
summarizes the evidence which he himself collected, and contrasts it
with what other authorities said on the subject:

'Les liures disent que les sorciers mangent au Sabbat de ce que le
Diable leur a appresté: mais bien souue\[n\]t il ne s'y

trouue que des viandes qu'ils ont porté eux mesmes. Parfois il y a
plusieurs tables seruies de bons viures, & d'autres fois de tres
meschans: & à table on se sied selon sa qualité, ayant chacun son Demon
assis auprés, & parfois vis à vis. Ils benissent leur table inuoquant
Beelzebub, & le tenant pour celui qui leur faict ce bien.'\[1\]

The young man-witch, Isaac de Queyran, told de Lancre that the witches
sat at a table with the Black Man at the end, and had bread and meat
which was spread on a cloth.\[2\] The evidence at the trial of Louis
Gaufredy at Aix in 1610 gives other details, though the eating of
children's flesh is probably an exaggeration:

'They prouide a banquet, setting three tables according to the three
diuersities of the people above named. They that haue the charge of
bread, doe bring in bread made of corne. The drink which they haue is
Malmsey. The meate they ordinarily eate is the flesh of young children,
which they cooke and make ready in the Synagogue, sometimes bringing
them thither aliue by stealing them from those houses where they haue
opportunity to come. They haue no vse of kniues at table for feare least
they should be laid a crosse. They haue also no salt.'\[3\]

Boguet also collected a considerable amount of information from the
witches who fell into his hands:

'Les Sorciers, apres s'estre veautrez parmi les plaisirs immondes de la
chair, banquettent & se festoient: leurs banquets estans composez de
plusieurs sortes de viandes, selon les lieux, & qualitez des personnes.
Par deçà la table estoit couuerte de beurre, de fromage, & de chair.
Clauda Ianguillaume, Iaquema Paget, & quelques autres adioustoient qu'iI
y auoit vne grande chaudiere sur le feu, dans laquelle chacun alloit
prendre de la chair. On y boit aussi du vin, & le plus souuent de 1'eau.
. . . Antoine Tornier a confessé qu'elle en auoit beu \[le vin\] dans vn
goubelet de bois; les autrés parloient seulement d'eau. Mais il n'y a
iamais sel en ces repas . . . Les Sorciers auant que de prendre leur
repas benissent la table, mais auec des parolles remplies de blasphemes,
faisans Beelzebub autheur & conseruateur de toutes choses . . . Ils
accordent tous, qu'il n'y a point de gout aux viandes qu'ils mangent au
Sabbat, & que la chair n'est autre chair que de cheual. Et adioustent en
outre, que lors qu'ils sortent de

\[1. De Lancre, *Tableau*, p. 197.

2\. Id. ib., p. 148.

3\. Michaelis, *Historie*, pp. 335-6.\]

table, ils sont aussi affamez que quand ils entrent. Antide Colas
racontoit particulierement que les viandes estoient froides. . . .
Toutesfois il faut croire que bien souuent l'on mange au Sabbat à bon
escient, & non par fantaisie & imagination.'\[1\]

The cold food occurs also in the accusation against a Belgian witch,
Elizabeth Vlamynx, in 1595: 'Vous-même vous avez apporté aux convives un
hochepot \[hutsepot\] froid, que vous aviez préparé d'avance.'\[2\]

In Sweden the witches collected the food and sent it to the Devil, who
gave them as much of it as he thought fit. The feast was always held
indoors in the house known as Blockula.

'In a huge large Room of this House, they said, there stood a very long
Table, at which the Witches did sit down. . . . They sate down to Table,
and those that the Devil esteemed most, were placed nearest to him, but
the Children must stand at the door, where he himself gives them meat
and drink. The diet they did use to have there, was, they said, Broth
with Colworts and Bacon in it, Oatmeal, Bread spread with Butter, Milk
and Cheese. And they added that sometimes it tasted very well, and
sometimes very ill.'\[3\]

## 6. Candles

At first sight it would seem that the candles were naturally used only
to illuminate the midnight festivities, but the evidence points to the
burning lights being part of the ritual. This is also suggested by the
importance, in the cult, of the early-spring festival of Candlemas; a
festival which has long been recognized as of pre-Christian origin.

The light is particularly mentioned in many instances as being carried
by the Devil, usually on his head; the witches often lit their torches
and candles at this flame, though sometimes it seems that the Devil lit
the torch and then presented it to the witch. To call the chief of the
cult Lucifer was therefore peculiarly appropriate, especially at the
Candlemas Sabbath.

In 1574 the witches of Poictiers went to a cross-roads: 'là se trouuoit
vn grand bouc noir, qui parloit comme vne personne

\[1. Boguet, pp. 135-9.

2\. Cannaert, p. 45

3\. Horneck, pp. 321-2, 327.\]

aux assistans, & dansoyent a l'entour du bouc: puis vn chacun luy
baisoit le derriere, auec vne chandelle ardente.'\[1\] The witches of
North Berwick in 1590 mention candles as part of the ritual:

'At ther meting be nycht in the kirk of Northberick, the deuell, cled in
a blak gown with a blak hat upon his head, preachit vnto a gret nomber
of them out of the pulpit, having lyk leicht candles rond about
him.'--John Fian blew up the Kirk doors, and blew in the lights, which
were like mickle black candles, holden in an old man's hand, round about
the pulpit.\[3\]--\[John Fian\] was taken to North Berwick church where
Satan commanded him to make him homage with the rest of his servants;
where he thought he saw the light of a candle, standing in the midst of
his servants, which appeared blue lowe \[flame\].'\[4\]

In 1594 at Puy-de-Dòme Jane Bosdeau went 'at Midnight on the Eve of St
John into a Field, where there appeared a great Black Goat with a Candle
between his Horns'.\[5\] At Aberdeen in 1597 Marion Grant confessed that
'the Deuill apperit to the, within this auchteine dayis or thairby,
quhome thow callis thy god, about ane hour in the nicht, and apperit to
the in ane gryte man his lickness, in silkin abuilzeament
\[habiliment\], withe ane quhyt candill in his hand'.\[6\] In 1598 the
witches whom Boguet tried said that--

'les Sorciers estans assemblez en leur Synagogue adorent premierement
Satan, qui apparoit là, tantost en forme d'vn grand homme noir, tantost
en forme de bouc, & pour plus grand hommage, ils luy offrent des
chandelles, qui rendent vne flamme de couleur bleüe. Quelquefois encor
il tient vne image noire, qu'il fait baiser aux Sorciers. Antide Colas &
ses compagnes, en baisant ceste image, offroient vne chandelle ou buche
d'estrain ardente. Ces chandelles leur sont baillées par le Diable, & se
perdent & esuanouissent dés lors qu'elles luy ont esté offertes. Il s'en
est trouué qui ont confessé qu'ils alloient allumer le plus soutient
leurs chandelles à vne autre chandelle, que le Demon, estant en forme de
bouc, portoit au dessus de la teste entre les deux cornes.'\[7\]

Some of the witches of the Basses-Pyrénées, tried in 1609, said that the
Devil was--

'comme vn grand bouc, ayãt deux cornes deuant & deux en derriere. Mais
le commun est qu'il a seulement trois cornes, & qu'il a quelque espece
de lumiere en celle du milieu, de laquelle il a accoustumé au sabbat
d'esclairer, & donner du feu & de la lumiere, mesmes à ces Sorcieres qui
tiennent quelques chandelles alumees aux ceremonies de la Messe qu'ils
veulent contrefaire. On luy voit aussi quelque espece de bonet on
chapeau au dessus de ses cornes.--Toute l'assemblee le vient adorer le
baisant sous la queuë, & allumant des chandelles noires.'\[1\]

Barthélemy Minguet of Brécy, a man of twenty-five, tried in 1616,
described the ceremonies of the Sabbath; after the sermon the
worshippers 'vont à l'offerte, tenant en leurs mains des chandelles de
poix noire qui leur sont données par le Diable . In 1646 Elizabeth Weed
of Great Catworth, Hunts, .confessed that the Devil came to her at
night, 'and being demanded what light was there, she answered, none but
the light of the Spirit.'\[3\] In 1652 a French witch stated that at the
Sabbath 'on dansait sans musique, aux chansons. Toutes les femmes y
étoient tenues par les diables par lors il y avoit de la lumière une
chandelle tenue au millieu par une femme que ne connoit. . . Au milieux
il y auoit une feme masquée tenant une chandelle.'\[4\] Barton's wife
was at a witch meeting in the Pentland Hills, 'and coming down the hill
when we had done, which was the best sport, he \[the Devil\] carried the
candle in his bottom under his tail, which played ey wig wag wig wag.",
Helen Guthrie in 1661 does not expressly mention candles or torches, but
her description of the flickering light on the ground suggests their
use. She I was at a meiting in the churchyeard of Forfar in the Holfe
therof, and they daunced togither, and the ground under them wes all
fyre

flauchter'.\[1\] The Somerset witches stated that, when they met, 'the
Man in Black bids them welcome, and they all make low obeysance to him,
and he delivers some Wax Candles like little Torches, which they give
back again at parting.'\[2\] The light seems to have been sometimes so
arranged, probably in a lantern, as to be diffused. This was the case at
Torryburn, where the assembly was ht by a light 'which came from
darkness', it was sufficiently strong for the dancers to see one
another's faces, and to show the Devil wearing a cap or hood which
covered his neck and ears.'\[3\] The latest account of a witch-meeting
in the eighteenth century describes how the witches of Strathdown went
to Pol-nain and there were 'steering themselves to and fro in their
riddles, by means of their oars the brooms, hallooing and skirling worse
than the bogles, and each holding in her left hand a torch of fir'.\[4\]

There is one account where the candle was for use and not for ritual.
John Stuart of Paisley, in 1678, admitted the Devil and some witches
into his room one night in order to make a clay image of an enemy.
'Declares, that the black man did make the figure of the Head and Face
and two Arms to the said Effigies. Declares, that the Devil set three
Pins in the same, one in each side, and one in the Breast: And that the
Declarant did hold the Candle to them all the time the Picture was
making.'\[5\] John Stuart was the principal person on this occasion, and
therefore had the honour of holding the light. The description of the
event suggests that the saying 'To hold a candle to the Devil' took its
rise in actual fact.

The material of which the candles or torches were made was pitch,
according to de Lancre, and at North Berwick the lights were 'like
lighted candles' burning with a blue flame. The white candle seems to
have been essentially the attribute of the devil, the black candles or
torches being distinctive of the witches. That the lights burned blue is
due to the material of which the torches were made. The evanescent
character of the light, when a wisp of straw was used, is noted in the
evidence of Antide Colas.

## 7. The Sacrament

The earliest example of the religious services occurs in 1324 in the
trial of Lady Alice Kyteler: 'In rifeling the closet of the ladie, they
found a Wafer of sacramentall bread, hauing the diuels name stamped
thereon in stead of Jesus Christ.'\[1\] According to Boguet (1589) the
Devil did not always perform the religious service himself, but mass was
celebrated by a priest among his followers; this custom is found in all
countries and seems to have been as common as that the Devil himself
should perform the service.

'Celuy, qui est commis à faire l'office, est reuestu d'vne chappe noire
sans croix, & apres auoir mis de l'eau dans le calice, it tourne le doz
à l'autel, & puis esleue vn rond de raue teinte en noir, au lieu de
l'hostie, & lors tous les Sorciers crient à haute voix, *Maistre, aide
nous*. Le Diable en mesme temps pisse dans vn trou à terre, & fait de
l'eau beniste de son vrine, de laquelle celuy, qui dit la messe, arrouse
tous les assistans auec vn asperges noir.'\[2\]

The Devil of the Basses Pyrénées (1609) performed the religious ceremony
himself:

'Il s'habille en Prestre pour dire Messe, laquelle it fait semblant de
celebrer auec mille fourbes & souplesses, auprés d'vn arbre, ou parfois
auprés d'vn rocher, dressant quelque forme d'autel sur des coloñes
infernales, & sur iceluy sans dire le *Confiteor*, ny *1'Alleluya*,
tournant les feuillets d'vn certain liure qu'il a en main, it commence à
marmoter quelques mots de la Messe, & arriuant à l'offertoire it
s'assiet, & toute l'assemblee le vient adorer le baisant sous la queuë,
& allumant des chandelles noires: Puis luy baisent la main gauche,
tremblans auec mille angoisses, & luy offrent du pain, des œufs, & de
l'argent: & la Royne du Sabbat les reçoit, laquelle est assise à son
costé gauche, & en sa main gauche elle tient vne paix ou platine, dans
laquelle est grauee l'effigie de Lucifer, laquelle on ne baise qu'aprés
l'auoir premierement baisée à elle. Puis it se met à prescher, son
subiect est communément de la vaine gloire. . . . Il finit son sermon, &
continue ses autres ceremonies, leuant vne certaine Hostie laquelle est
noire & ronde, auec sa figure imprimée au dessus: & disant ces paroles,
*Cecy est mon corps*, it leue l'Hostie sur ses cornes & à cette
esleuatiõ tous ceux de l'assemblee I'adore\[n\]t

\[1. Holinshed, *Ireland*, p. 58.

2\. Boguet, p. 141.\]

en disant ces mots, *Aquerra Goity, Aquerra Beyty, Aquerra Goity,
Aquerra Beyty*, qui veut dire, *Cabron arriba, Cabron abaro*, de mesme
en font its au Calice repetant ces mots, iusqu'à ce qu'il a vuidé tout
ce qui est dans iceluy. Puis toute l'assemblee enuironnant l'autel en
forme de croissant ou demy-lune, prosternez par terre, it leur fait vn
autre sermon, puis leur baille à communier par ordre, donnant à chacun
vn petit morceau de l'hostie, & pour leur donner moyen de l'aualer
aisément, il leur donne deux gorgees de quelque medicine infernale, &
certain breuuage de si mauuais goust & odeur, que l'aualant its suent, &
neantmoins it est si froid, ou'il leur gele le corps, les nerfs, & les
moüelles. Puis il s'accouple auec elles, & leur commande d'en faire de
mesme, si bien qu'ils commettent mille incestes & autres pechez contre
nature. Puis it les inuite à se mettre à table.'\[1\]

At Aix in 1610 Magdalene de Demandouls 'said that that accursed Magician
Lewes \[Gaufredy\] did first inuent the saying of Masse at the Sabbaths,
and did really consecrate and present the sacrifice to Lucifer. . . .
She also related, that the said Magician did sprinkle the consecrated
wine vpon all the company, at which time euery one cryeth, *Sanguis eius
super nos & filios nosotros*.'\[2\]

Lord Fountainhall remarks, 'In 1670 we heard that the Devil appeared in
the shape of a Minister, in the copper mines of Sweden, and attempted
the same villainous apery.'\[3\] The Scotch witches, like the Swedish,
performed the rite after the manner of the Reformed Churches. In 1678--

'the devill had a great meeting of witches in Loudian, where, among
others, was a warlock who formerly had been admitted to the ministrie in
the presbyterian tymes, and when the bishops came in, conformed with
them. But being found flagitious and wicked, was deposed by them, and
now he turnes a preacher under the devill of hellish doctrine; for the
devill at this tyme preaches to his witches really (if I may so term it)
the doctrine of the infernall pitt, viz. blasphemies against God and his
son Christ. Among other things, he told them that they were more happy
in him than they could be in God; him they saw, but God they could not
see; and in mockrie of Christ and his holy ordinance of the sacrament

\[1. De Lancre, *Tableau*, pp. 401-2.

2\. Michaelis, *Hist*., p. 337. The use of this phrase suggests that the
sprinkling was a fertility rite.

3\. Fountainhall, i, pp. 14, 15.\]

of his supper, he gives the sacrament to them, bidding them eat it and
to drink it in remembrance of himself. This villan was assisting to
Sathan in this action, and in preaching.'\[1\]

Fountainhall in writing of the same convention of witches says that the
Devil 'adventured to give them the communion or holy sacrament, the
bread was like wafers, the drink was sometimes blood sometimes black
moss-water. He preached and most blasphemously mocked them, if they
offered to trust in God who left them miserable in the world, and
neither he nor his Son Jesus Christ ever appeared to them when they
called on them, as he had, who would not cheat them.'\[2\]

The Abbé Guibourg (1679), head of the Paris witches, 'a fait chez la
Voisin, revêtu d'aube, d'étole et de manipule, une conjuration.'\[3\]
The same Abbé celebrated mass more than once over the body of a woman
and with the blood of a child, sacrificed for the occasion, in the
chalice (see section on Sacrifice). The woman, who served as the altar
for these masses, was always nude, and was the person for whose benefit
the ceremony was performed. Marguerite Montvoisin makes this clear:

'It est vrai aussi qu'une sage-femme qui demeurait au coin de la rue des
Deux-Portes, distilla aussi les entrailles d'un enfant dont la mère y
avait accouché. . . . Avant la distillation, les entrailles de l'enfant
et l'arrière-faix de la mère avaient été portés à Saint-Denis, à
Guibourg, par sa mère, la sage-femme et la mère de l'enfant, sur le
ventre de laquelle sa mère, à son retour, lui dit que Guibourg avait dit
la messe.'\[4\]

Guibourg acknowledged that, besides the one just quoted, he celebrated
three masses in this way. At the first he used a conjuration. 'It dit la
deuxième messe dans une masure sur les remparts de Saint-Denis, sur la
même femme, avec les mêmes cérémonies. . . . Dit la troisième à Paris
chez la Voisin sur la même femme.'\[5\] The woman mentioned in
Guibourg's confession was Madame de Montespan herself. The following
conjuration was used at the first mass:

'sur le ventre d'une femme': 'Astaroth, Asmodée, princes d'amitié, je
vous conjure d'accepter le sacrifice que je vous

l'amitié du Roi, de Mgr le Dauphin me soit continuée et être honorée des
princes et princesses de la cour, que rien ne me soit dénié de tout ce
que je demanderai au Roi, tant pour mes parents que serviteurs.'\[1\]

A very interesting case is that of the Rev. George Burroughs in New
England (1692):

'He was Accused by Eight of the Confessing Witches, as being an Head
Actor at some of their Hellish Randezvouses, and one who had the promise
of being a King in Satan's kingdom, now going to be Erected. . . . One
*Lacy* testify'd that she and the prisoner \[Martha Carrier\] were once
Bodily present at a *Witch-meeting* in *Salem Village*; and that she
knew the prisoner to be a Witch, and to have been at a Diabolical
sacrament. . . . Another *Lacy* testify'd that the prisoner was at the
*Witch-meeting*, in *Salem Village*, where they had Bread and Wine
Administred unto them. . . . Deliverance Hobbs affirmed that this
\[Bridget\] *Bishop* was at a General Meeting of the Witches, in a Field
at Salem-Village, and there partook of a Diabolical Sacrament in Bread
and Wine then administred.'\[2\]

Hutchinson had access to the same records and gives the same evidence,
though even more strongly: 'Richard Carrier affirmed to the jury that he
saw Mr. George Burroughs at the witch meeting at the village and saw him
administer the sacrament. Mary Lacy, sen<sup>r</sup>. and her daughter
Mary affirmed that Mr. George Burroughs was at the witch meetings with
witch sacrements, and that she knows Mr. Burroughs to be of the company
of witches.'\[3\] John Hale has a similar record: 'This D. H.
\[Deliverance Hobbs\] confessed she was at a Witch Meeting at Salem
Village. . . . And the said G. B. preached to them, and such a Woman was
their Deacon, and there they had a Sacrament.'\[4\] Abigail Williams
said 'that the Witches had a Sacrament that day at an house in the
Village, and that they had *Red Bread* and *Red Drink*.'\[5\] With the
evidence before him Mather seems justified in saying that the witches
had 'their Diabolical Sacraments, imitating the *Baptism* and the
*Supper* of our Lord'.\[6\]

## 8. Sacrifices

There are four forms of sacrifice: (1) the blood sacrifice, which was
performed by making an offering of the witch's own blood; (2) the
sacrifice of an animal; (3) the sacrifice of a human being, usually a
child; (4) the sacrifice of the god.

1\. The *blood-sacrifice* took place first at the admission of the
neophyte. Originally a sacrifice, it was afterwards joined to the other
ceremony of signing the contract, the blood serving as the writing
fluid; it also seems to be confused in the seventeenth century with the
pricking for the Mark, but the earlier evidence is clear. A writer who
generalizes on the witchcraft religion and who recognizes the
sacrificial nature of the act is Cooper; as he wrote in 1617 his
evidence belongs practically to the sixteenth century. He says:

'In further *token* of their subiection unto Satan in yeelding vp
themselues wholy vnto his deuotion, behold yet *another ceremony* heere
vsually is performed: namely, *to let themselues bloud* in some apparant
place of the body, yeelding the same to be *sucked by Satan*, as a
sacrifice vnto him, and testifying thereby the full *subiection* of
their liues and *soules* to his deuotion.'\[1\]

The earliest account of the ceremony is at Chelmsford in 1556. Elizabeth
Francis 'learned this arte of witchcraft from her grandmother. When shee
taughte it her, she counseiled her to geue of her bloudde to Sathan (as
she termed it) whyche she delyuered to her in the likenesse of a whyte
spotted Catte. Euery time that he \[the cat\] did any thynge for her,
she sayde that he required a drop of bloude, which she gaue him by
prycking herselfe.' Some time after, Elizabeth Francis presented the
Satan-cat to Mother Waterhouse, passing on to her the instructions
received from Elizabeth's grandmother. Mother Waterhouse 'gaue him for
his labour a chicken, which he fyrste required of her and a drop of her
blod. And thys she gaue him at all times when he dyd any thynge for her,
by pricking her hand or face and puttinge

\[1. Cooper, p. 91.\]

the blond to hys mouth whyche he sucked.'\[1\] In 1566 John Walsh, a
Dorset witch, confessed that 'at the first time when he had the Spirite,
hys sayd maister did cause him to deliuer one drop of his blud, whych
bloud the Spirite did take away vpon hys paw'.\[2\] In Belgium in 1603
Claire Goessen, 'après avoir donné à boire de son sang à Satan, et avoir
bu du sien, a fait avec lui un pacte.'\[3\]

In the case of the Lancashire witch, Margaret Johnson, in 1633, it is
difficult to say whether the pricking was for the purpose of marking or
for a blood sacrifice; the slight verbal alterations in the two MS.
accounts of her confession suggest a confusion between the two ideas;
the one appears to refer to the mark, the other (quoted here) to the
sacrifice: 'Such witches as have sharp bones given them by the devill to
pricke them, have no pappes or dugges whereon theire devil may sucke;
but theire devill receiveth bloud from the place, pricked with the bone;
and they are more grand witches than any y<sup>t</sup> have marks.'\[4\]
In Suffolk in 1645 'one Bush of Barton widdow confessed that the Deuill
appeared to her in the shape of a young black man . . . and asked her
for bloud, which he drew out of her mouth, and it dropped on a
paper'.\[5\] At Auldearne, in 1662, the blood was drawn for baptizing
the witch; Isobel Gowdie said, 'The Divell marked me in the showlder,
and suked owt my blood at that mark, and spowted it in his hand, and,
sprinkling it on my head, said, "I baptise the, Janet, in my awin
name."' Janet Breadheid's evidence is practically the same: 'The Divell
marked me in the shoulder, and suked out my blood with his mowth at that
place; he spowted it in his hand, and sprinkled it on my head. He
baptised me thairvith, in his awin nam, Christian.'\[6\]

2\. The *sacrifice of animals* was general, and the accounts give a
certain amount of detail, but the ceremony was not as a rule
sufficiently dramatic to be considered worth recording. The actual
method of killing the animal is hardly ever given. The rite was usually
performed privately by an individual; on

\[1. *Chelmsford Witches*, pp. 24, 26, 29, 30. Philobiblon Society,

4\. Whitaker, p. 216.

7\. Stearne, p. 29.

6 Pitcairn, iii, pp. 603, 617.\]

rare occasions it was celebrated by a whole Coven, but it does not occur
at the Great Assembly, for there the sacrifice was of the God himself.
The animals offered were generally a dog, a cat, or a fowl, and it is
noteworthy that these were forms in which the Devil often appeared to
his worshippers.

The chief authorities all agree as to the fact of animal sacrifices.
Cotta compares it with the sacrifices offered by the heathen:

' Some bring their cursed Sorcery vnto their wished end by sacrificing
vnto the Diuell some liuing creatures, as *Serres* likewise witnesseth,
from the confession of Witches in *Henry* the fourth of *France*
deprehended, among whom, one confessed to haue offered vnto his Deuill
or Spirit a Beetle. This seemeth not improbable, by the Diabolicall
litations (*sic*) and bloudy sacrifices, not onely of other creatures,
but euen of men, wherewith in ancient time the heathen pleased their
gods, which were no other then Diuels.'\[1\]

The number of sacrifices in the year is exaggerated by the writers on
the subject, but the witches themselves are often quite definite in
their information when it happens to be recorded. It appears from their
statements that the rite was performed only on certain occasions, either
to obtain help or as a thank-offering. Danaeus, speaking of the newly
admitted witch, says, 'Then this vngracious and new servant of satan,
euery day afterward offreth something of his goods to his patrone, some
his dogge, some his hen, and some his cat.'\[2\] Scot, who always
improves on his original, states that the witches depart after the
Sabbath, 'not forgetting euery daie afterwards to offer to him, dogs,
cats, hens, or bloud of their owne.'\[3\]

The earliest witch-trial in the British Isles shows animal sacrifice. In
1324 in Ireland Lady Alice Kyteler 'was charged to haue nightlie
conference with a spirit called Robin Artisson, to whom she sacrificed
in the high waie .ix. red cocks'.\[4\] In 1566 at Chelmsford Mother
Waterhouse 'gaue him \[i.e. the Satan-cat\] for his labour a chicken,
which he fyrste required of her, and a drop of her blod . . . Another
tyme she rewarded hym as before, wyth a chicken and a droppe

\[1. Cotta, p. 114.

of her bloud, which chicken he eate vp cleane as he didde al the rest,
and she cold fynde remaining neyther bones nor fethers.'\[1\] Joan
Waterhouse, daughter of Mother Waterhouse, a girl of eighteen, said that
the Deuil came in the likeness of a great dog, 'then asked hee her what
she wolde geue hym, and she saide a red kocke'.\[2\] John Walsh of
Dorset, in 1566, confessed that 'when he would call him \[the Spirit\],
hee sayth hee must gene hym some Iyuing thing, as a Chicken, a Cat, or a
Dog. And further he sayth he must geue hym twoo lyuing thynges once a
yeare.'\[3\] In Lorraine in 1589 Beatrix Baonensis said, 'Etliche geben
junge Hüner, oder wohI alte Hüner, wie Desideria Pari iensis, und
Cathelonia Vincentia gethan hatten: Etliche schneiden ihre Haar ab und
lieffern dieselbe dahin, etliche geben Späher, etliche Vögel oder sonst
nicht viel besonders, als da sein möchte gemüntz Geld aus Rindern
Ledder, und wenn sie dergleichen nichts haben, so verschafft es ihnen
ihr Geist, auff dass sie staffirt seyn.'\[4\] In Aberdeen in 1597 Andro
Man gave evidence that 'the Devill thy maister, whom thow termis
Christsunday . . . is rasit be the speking of the word *Benedicte*, and
is laid agane be tacking of a dog vnder thy left oxster in thi richt
hand, and casting the same in his mouth, and speking the word
*Maikpeblis*.'\[5\] At Lang Niddry in 1608 the whole Coven performed a
rite, beginning at the 'irne zet of Seatoun', where they christened a
cat by the name of Margaret, 'and thaireftir come all bak agane to the
Deane-fute, quhair first thai convenit, and cuist the kat to the
Devill.'\[6\] In 1630 Alexander Hamilton had consultations with the
Devil near Edinburgh, 'and afoir the devill his away passing the said
Alexr was in use to cast to him ather ane kat or ane laif or ane dog or
any uther sic beast he come be.'\[7\] In Bute in

7\. From an unpublished trial in the Justiciary Court at Edinburgh. The
meaning of the word *laif* is not clear. The Oxford dictionary gives
*lop-eared*, the Scotch dictionary gives *loaf*. By analogy with the
other accounts one would expect here a word meaning a hen.\]

1622 Margaret NcWilliam 'renounced her baptisme and he baptised her and
she gave him as a gift a hen or cock'.\[1\] In modern France the
sacrifice of a fowl to the Devil still holds good: 'Celui qui veut
devenir sorcier doit aller à un *quatre chemins* avec une *poule noire*,
ou bien encore au *cimetière*, sur une *tombe* et toujours à *minuit*.
Il vient alors quelqu'un qui demande: "Que venez vous faire ici?" "Jai
une poule à vendre," répond-on. Ce quelqu'un \[est\] le Méchanté.'\[2\]

It is possible that the custom of burying a live animal to cure disease
among farm animals, as well as the charm of casting a live cat into the
sea to raise a storm, are forms of the animal sacrifice.

3\. *Child Sacrifice*.--'The child-victim was usually a young infant,
either a witch's child or unbaptized; in other words, it did not belong
to the Christian community. This last is an important point, and was the
reason why unbaptized children were considered to be in greater danger
from witches than the baptized. 'If there be anie children vnbaptised,
or not garded with the signe of the crosse, or orizons; then the witches
may, or doo catch them from their mothers sides in the night, or out of
their cradles, or otherwise kill them with their ceremonies.'\[3\] The
same author quotes from the French authorities the crimes laid to the
charge of witches, among which are the following: 'They sacrifice their
owne children to the diuell before baptisme, holding them vp in the aire
vnto him, and then thrust a needle into their braines'; and 'they burne
their children when they haue sacrificed them'.\[4\] Boguet says, 'Les
Matrones, & sages femmes sont accoustumé d'offrir à Satan les petits
enfans qu'elles reçoiuent, & puis les faire mourir auant qu'ils soient
baptizez, par le moye\[n\] d'vne grosse espingle qu'elles leur enfoncent
dans le cerueau.'\[5\] Boguet's words imply that this was done at every
birth at which a witch officiated; but it is impossible that this should
be the case; the sacrifice was probably made for some special purpose,
for which a new-born child was the appropriate victim.

The most detailed account of such sacrifices is given in the trial of
the Paris witches (1679-81), whom Madame de

\[1. *Highland Papers*, iii, p. 18.

Montespan consulted. The whole ceremony was performed to the end that
the love of Louis XIV should return to Madame de Montespan, at that time
his discarded mistress; it seems to be a kind of fertility rite, hence
its use on this occasion. The Abbé Guibourg was the sacrificing priest,
and from this and other indications he appears to have been the Chief or
Grand-master who, before a less educated tribunal, would have been
called the Devil. Both he and the girl Montvoisin were practically
agreed as to the rite; though from the girl's words it would appear that
the child was already dead, while Guibourg's evidence implies that it
was alive. Both witnesses gave their evidence soberly and gravely and
without torture. Montvoisin, who was eighteen years old, stated that she
had presented 'à la messe de Madame de Montespan, par l'ordre de sa
mère, un enfant paraissant né avant terme, le mit dans un bassin,
Guibourg l'égorgea, versa dans le calice, et consacra le sang avec
hostie'. Guibourg's evidence shows that the sacrifice was so far from
being uncommon that the assistants were well used to the work, and did
all that was required with the utmost celerity:

'Il avait acheté un écu l'enfant qui fut sacrifié à cette messe qui lui
fut présenté par une grande fille et ayant tiré du sang de l'enfant
qu'il piqua à la gorge avec un canif, it en versa dans le calice, après
quoi l'enfant fut retiré et emporté dans un autre lieu, dont ensuite on
lui rapporta le cœur et les entrailles pour en faire une deuxieme
\[oblation\].'\[1\]

In Scotland it was firmly believed that sacrifices of children took
place in all classes of society: 'The justices of the peace were seen
familiarly conversing with the foul fiend, to whom one in Dumfries-shire
actually offered up his firstborn child immediately after birth,
stepping out with it in his arms to the staircase, where the devil stood
ready, as it was suspected, to receive the innocent Victim.'\[2\] In the
later witch-trials the sacrifice of the child seems to have been made
after its burying, as in the case of the Witch of Calder in 1720, who
confessed that she had given the Devil 'the body of a dead child of her
own to make a roast of'.\[3\]

\[1. Ravaisson, p. 334, 335

2\. Sharpe, p. 147.

3\. Chambers, iii, p. 450.\]

It is possible that the killing of children by poison was one method of
sacrifice when the cult was decadent and victims difficult to obtain.
Reginald Scot's words, written in 1584, suggest that this was the case:
'This must be an infallible rule, that euerie fortnight, or at the least
euerie moneth, each witch must kill one child at the least for hir
part.' 'Sinistrari d'Ameno, writing about a century later, says the
same: 'They promise the Devil sacrifices and offerings at stated times:
once a fortnight or at least each month, the murder of some child, or an
homicidal act of sorcery.'\[2\] It is impossible to believe in any great
frequency of this sacrifice, but there is considerable foundation in
fact for the statement that children were killed, and it accounts as
nothing else can for the cold-blooded murders of children of which the
witches were sometimes accused. The accusations seem to have been
substantiated on several occasions, the method of sacrifice being by
poison.\[3\]

The sacrifice of a child was often performed as a means of procuring
certain magical materials or powers, which were obtained by preparing
the sacrificed bodies in several ways. Scot says that the flesh of the
child was boiled and consumed by the witches for two purposes. Of the
thicker part of the concoction 'they make ointments, whereby they ride
in the aire; but the thinner potion they put into flaggons, whereof
whosoeuer drinketh, obseruing certeine ceremonies, immediatelie
becommeth a maister or rather a mistresse in that practise and
facultie.'\[4\] The Paris Coven confessed that they 'distilled' the
entrails of the sacrificed child after Guibourg had celebrated the mass
for Madame de Montespan, the method being probably the same as that
described by Scot. A variant occurs in both France and Scotland, and is
interesting as throwing light on the reasons for some of the savage
rites of the witches: 'Pour ne confesser iamais le secret de l'escole,
on faict au sabbat vne paste de millet noir, auec de la poudre du foye
de quelque enfant non baptisé qu'on faict secher, puis

4\. Scot, Bk. III, p. 41.\]

meslant cette poudre avec ladicte paste, elle a cette vertu de
taciturnité: si bien que qui en mange ne confesse iamais.'\[1\] At
Forfar, in 1661, Helen Guthrie and four others exhumed the body of an
unbaptized infant, which was buried in the churchyard near the
south-east door of the church, 'and took severall peices therof, as the
feet, hands, a pairt of the head, and a pairt of the buttock, and they
made a py therof, that they might eat of it, that by this meanes they
might never make a confession (as they thought) of their
witchcraftis.'\[2\] Here the idea of sympathetic magic is very clear; by
eating the flesh of a child who had never spoken articulate words, the
witches' own tongue's would be unable to articulate.

4\. *Sacrifice of the God*.--The sacrifice of the witch-god was a
decadent custom when the records were made in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. The accounts of the actual rite come from France
and Belgium, where a goat was substituted for the human victim. The
sacrifice was by fire in both those countries, and there are indications
that it was the same in Great Britain. It is uncertain whether the
interval of time between the sacrifices was one, seven, or nine years.

Bodin and Boguet, each writing from his own knowledge of the subject,
give very similar accounts, Bodin's being the more detailed. In
describing a trial which took place in Poictiers in 1574, he says: 'Là
se trouuoit vn grand bouc noir, qui parloit comme vne personne aux
assistans, & dansoyent à l'entour du bouc: puis vn chacun luy baisoit le
derriere, auec vne chandelle ardente: & celà faict, le bouc se
consommoit en feu, & de la ce\[n\]dre chacun en prenoit pour faire
mourir le bœuf \[etc.\]. Et en fin le Diable leur disoit d'vne voix
terrible des mots, Vengez vous ou vous mourrez.'\[3\] Boguet says that
in the Lyons district in 1598 the Devil celebrated mass, and 'apres
auoir prins la figure d'vn Bouc, se consume en feu, & reduit en cendre,
laquelle les Sorciers recueillent, & cachent pour s'en seruir à
l'execution de leurs desseins pernicieux & abominables'.\[4\] In 1603, a
Belgian witch, Claire Goessen, was present at such a sacrifice, and her
account is therefore that of an eyewitness. 'Elle s'est laissée
transporter à l'assemblée

nocturne de Lembeke, où, après la danse, elle a, comme tous les
assistans, baisé un bouc à l'endroit de sa queue, lequel bouc fut
ensuite brûlè et ses cendres distribuées et emportées par les
convives.'\[1\] Jeanne de Belloc in 1609 'a veu le Grand maistre de
l'assemblee se ietter dans les flammes an sabbat, se faire brusler
iusques à ce qu'iI estoit reduit en poudre, & les grandes & insignes
sorcieres prendre les dictes poudres pour ensorceler les petits enfants
& les metier an sabbat, & en prenoient aussi dans la bouche pour ne
reueler iamais'.\[2\] A French witch in 16S2 declared that at the
Sabbath 'le diable s'y at mis en feu et en donné des cendres lesquelles
tous faisaient voller en I'air pour faire mancquer les fruits de la
terre'.\[3\] At Lille in 1661 the girls in Madame Bourignon's orphanage
stated that 'on y adoroit une bète; & qu'on faisoit avec elle des
infamies; & puis sur la fin on la brûloit, & chacun en prenoit des
cendres, avec lesquelles on faisoit languir ou mourir des personnes, ou
autres animaux.'\[4\]

The collection and use of the ashes by the worshippers point to the fact
that we have here a sacrifice of the god of fertility. Originally the
sprinkling of the ashes on fields or animals or in running water was a
fertility charm; but when Christianity became sufficiently powerful to
attempt the suppression of the ancient religion, such practices were
represented as evil, and were therefore said to be 'pour faire mancquer
les fruits de la terre'.

The animal-substitute for the divine victim is usually the latest form
of the sacrifice; the intervening stages were first the volunteer, then
the criminal, both of whom were accorded the power and rank of the
divine being whom they personated. The period of time during which the
substitute acted as the god varied in different places; so also did the
interval between the sacrifices. Frazer has pointed out that the human
victim, whether the god himself or his human substitute, did not content
himself by merely not attempting to escape his destiny, but in many
cases actually rushed on his fate, and died by his own hand or by
voluntary submission to the sacrificer.

The witch-cult being a survival of an ancient religion, many of the
beliefs and rites of these early religions are to be found in it. Of
these the principal are: the voluntary substitute, the temporary
transference of power to the substitute, and the self-devotion to death.
As times changed and the ceremonies could no longer be performed openly,
the sacrifices took on other forms. I have already suggested that the
child-murders, of which the witches were often convicted, were in many
cases probably offerings made to the God. In the same way, when, the
time came for the God or his substitute to be sacrificed, recourse was
had to methods which hid the real meaning of the ceremony; and the
sacrifice of the incarnate deity, though taking place in public, was
consummated at the hands of the public executioner. This explanation
accounts for the fact that the bodies of witches, male or female, were
always burnt and the ashes scattered; for the strong prejudice which
existed, as late as the eighteenth century, against any other mode of
disposing of their bodies; and for some of the otherwise inexplicable
occurrences in connexion with the deaths of certain of the victims.

Read in the light of this theory much of the mystery which surrounds the
fate of Joan of Arc is explained. She was put to death as a witch, and
the conduct of her associates during her military career, as well as the
evidence at her trial, bear out the fact that she belonged to the
ancient religion, not to the Christian. Nine years after her death in
the flames her commander, Gilles de Rais, was tried on the same charge
and condemned to the same fate. The sentence was not carried out
completely in his case; he was executed by hanging, and the body was
snatched from the fire and buried in Christian ground. Like Joan
herself, Gilles received a semi- canonization after death, and his
shrine was visited by nursing mothers. Two centuries later Major Weir
offered himself up and was executed as a witch in Edinburgh, refusing to
the end all attempts to convert him to the Christian point of view.

The belief that the witch must be burnt and the ashes scattered was so
ingrained in the popular mind that, when the severity of the laws began
to relax, remonstrances were made by or to the authorities. In 1649 the
Scotch General Assembly has a record: 'Concerning the matter of the
buriall of the Lady Pittadro, who, being vnder a great scandall of
witchcraft, and being incarcerat in the Tolbuith of this burgh during
her triall before the justice, died in prison, The Comission of the
Generall Assembly, having considered the report of the Comittee
appointed for that purpose, Doe give their advyse to the Presbyterie of
Dumfermling to show their dislike of that fact of the buriall of the
Lady Pittadro, in respect of the maner and place, and that the said
Presbyterie may labour to make the persons who hes buried her sensible
of their offence in so doeing; and some of the persons who buried hir,
being personallie present, are desired by the Comission to shew
themselvis to the Presbyterie sensible of their miscarriage
therein.'\[1\]

At Maidstone in 1652 'Anne Ashby, alias Cobler, Anne Martyn, Mary
Browne, Anne Wilson, and Mildred Wright of Cranbrook, and Mary Read, of
Lenham, being legally convicted, were according to the Laws of this
Nation, adjudged to be hanged, at the common place of Execution. Some
there were that wished rather, they might be burnt to Ashes; alledging
that it was a received opinion among many, that the body of a witch
being burnt, her bloud is prevented thereby from becomming hereditary to
her Progeny in the same evill.'\[2\] The witches themselves also held
the belief that they ought to die by fire. Anne Foster was tried for
witchcraft at Northampton in 1674: 'after Sentence of Death was past
upon her, she mightily desired to be Burned; but the Court would give no
Ear to that, but that she should be hanged at the Common place of
Execution.'\[3\]

## 9. Magic Words

The magic words known to the witches were used only for certain definite
purposes, the most important use being to raise the Devil. I have
omitted the charms which are founded on Christian prayers and formulas,
and quote only those which appear to belong to the witch-cult.

In the section on *Familiars* it will be seen how the witches

\[1. *Scot. Hist. Soc*., xxv, p. 348. See also Ross, *Aberdour and
Inchcolme*, p. 339.

2\. *Prod. and Trag. History*, p. 7.

3\. *Tryall of Ann Foster*, p. 8.\]

divined by means of animals, which animals were allotted to them by the
Chief. In auguries and divinations of this kind in every part of the
world a form of words is always used, and the augury is taken by the
first animal of the desired species which is seen after the charm is
spoken.

Agnes Sampson, the leading witch of the North Berwick Coven, 1590,
summoned her familiar by calling 'Elva', and then divined by a dog, whom
she dismissed by telling him to 'depart by the law he lives on'. She
also used the formula, 'Haill, hola!', and 'Hola!' was also the cry when
a cat was cast into the sea to raise a storm.' A man-witch of Alest,
1593, gave the devil's name as Abiron: 'quand il le vouloit voir il
disoit: vien Abiron, sinon ie te quitteray.'\[2\] Andro Man at Aberdeen,
1597, 'confessis that the Devill, thy maister, is rasit be the speking
of the word *Benedicite*, and is laid agane be tacking of a dog vnder
thy left oxster in thi richt hand, and casting the same in his mouth,
and speking the word *Maikpeblis*.--He grantit that this word
*Benedicite* rasit the Dewill, and *Maikpeblis* laid him againe, strikin
him on the faice with ane deice with the left hand.'\[2\] Alexander
Hamilton of East Lothian, 1630, when covenanting with the devil, had
'ane battoun of fir in his hand the devill than gave the said Alexr
command to tak that battoun quhan evir he had ado with him and therewt
to strek thruse upone the ground and to chairge him to ruse up foule
theiff'; the divining animals in this case were crows, cats, and
dogs.\[4\] Marie Lamont of Innerkip, 1662, was instructed to call the
Devil *Serpent* when she desired to speak with him.\[5\]

The Somerset witches, 1664, cried out *Robin* at an appointed place, and
the Master then appeared in his proper form as a man: Elizabeth Style
and Alice Duke also called him *Robin* when summoning him privately, and
Elizabeth Style added, 'O Sathan give me my purpose', before saying what
she wished done.\[6\] The Swedish witches, 1669, called their Chief

with the cry, 'Antecessor, come and carry us to Blockula'; this they did
at an appointed place, and the Devil then appeared as a man.\[1\]

The words used before starting to a meeting are rarely recorded; only a
few remain. The earliest example is from Guernsey in 1563, when Martin
Tulouff heard an old witch cry as she bestrode a broomstick, 'Va au nom
du diable et luciffer p dessq\[n\] roches et espyñes.' He then lost
sight of her, with the inference that she flew through the air, though
he acknowledged that he himself was not so successful.\[2\] The witches
of the Basses-Pyrénées, 1609, anointed themselves before starting, and
repeated the words 'Emen hetan, emen hetan', which de Lancre translates
'Ici et là, ici et là'. 'Quelquefois plus furieuses elles se batent
entre elles mesmes, en disant, le suis Ie Diable, ie n'ay rien qui ne
soit à toy, en ton nom Seigneur cette tien ne seruante s'oingt, & dois
estre quelque iour Diable & maling Esprit comme toy.' When crossing
water they cried, 'Haut la coude, Quillet,' upon which they could cross
without getting wet; and when going a long distance they said, 'Pic
suber hoeilhe, en ta la lane de bouc bien m'arrecoueille.'\[3\] Isobel
Gowdie, 1662, gives two variants of the magic words used on these
occasions: the first, 'Horse and hattock, in the Divellis name' is not
unlike the form given by Martin Tulouff; the second is longer, 'Horse
and hattock, horse and goe, Horse and pellattis, ho! ho!'\[4\] The
Somerset witches, 1664, when starting to the meeting, said, 'Thout, tout
a tout, tout, throughout and about'; and when returning, 'Rentum
tormentum'. At parting they cried, 'A Boy! merry meet, merry part'\[7\]
They also had a long form of words which were used when applying the
flying ointment, but these are not recorded.

Other magical words were used at the religious services of the witches
in the Basses-Pyrénées (1609). At the elevation

5\. Glanvil, pt. ii, pp. 139, 141. 1 have pointed out that the cry of A
Boy' is possibly the Christian recorder's method of expressing the
Bacchic shout 'Evoe'. See *Jour. Man. Or. Soc*., 1916-17, p. 65.\]

of the host the congregation cried, '"Aquerra goity, Aquerra beyty,
Aquerra goity, Aquerra beyty," qui veut dire *Cabron arriba Cabron
abaro* (*sic*)'; at the elevation of the chalice at a Christian service
they said, 'Corbeau noir, corbeau noir.' There were two forms of words
to be used when making the sign of the cross; the first was, 'In nomine
Patrica, Aragueaco Petrica, Agora, Agora Valentia, Iouanda, goure gaitz
goustia,' translated as 'Au nom de Patrique, Petrique, d'Arragon, à
cette heure à cette heure Valence, tout nostre mal est passé'. The
second roused de Lancre's horror as peculiarly blasphemous: 'In, nomine
patrica, Aragueaco Petrica, Gastellaco Ianicot, Equidae ipordian pot,'
'au nom de Patrique, petrique d'Arragon. Iannicot de Castille faictes
moy vn baiser au derriere.'\[1\] The mention of the ancient Basque god
Janicot makes this spell unusually interesting. As the dances were also
a religious rite the words used then must be recorded here. Bodin gives
the formula, 'Har, har, diable, diable, saute icy, saute là, iouë icy,
iouë là: Et les autres disoyent sabath sabath.'\[2\] The word *diable*
is clearly Bodin's own interpellation for the name of the God, for the
Guernsey version, which is currently reported to be used at the present
day, runs 'Har, har, Hou, Hou, danse ici', etc.; Hou being the name of
an ancient Breton god.\[3\] Jean Weir (1670) stated that at the
instigation of some woman unnamed she put her foot on a cloth on the
floor with her hand upon the crown of her head, and repeated thrice,
'All my cross and troubles go to the door with thee.'\[4\] This seems to
have been an admission ceremony, but the words are of the same sentiment
as the one recorded by de Lancre, 'tout notre mat est passé.'

There were also certain magical effects supposed to be brought about by
the use of certain words. Martin Tulouff (1563) claimed that he could
bewitch cows so that they gave blood instead of milk, by saying 'Butyrum
de armento', but he admitted that he also used powders to accomplish his

purpose.\[1\] Isobel Gowdie (1662) described how the witches laid a
broom or a stool in their beds to represent themselves during their
absence at a meeting. By the time that this record was made the witches
evidently believed that the object took on the exact appearance of the
woman, having forgotten its original meaning as a signal to show where
she had gone. The words used on these occasions show no belief in the
change of appearance of the object:

'I lay down this besom \[or stool\] in the Devil's name,  
Let it not stir till I come again.'

Her statements regarding the change of witches into animals I have
examined in the section on Familiars (p. 234). The words used to effect
these changes are given in full. When a witch wished to take on the form
of a hare she said:

'I sall goe intill ane haire,  
With sorrow, and sych, and meikle caire;  
And I sall goe in the Divellis nam,  
Ay quhill I com hom againe.'

To change into a cat or a crow the last two lines were retained
unaltered, but the first two were respectively,

'I sall goe intill ane catt,  
With sorrow, and sych, and a blak shot'

or

'I sall goe intill a craw,  
With sorrow, and sych, and a blak thraw.'

To return into human form the witch said:

'Haire, haire, God send thee caire.  
I am in an haire's liknes just now,  
Bot I sal be in a womanis liknes ewin now.'

From a cat or a crow, the words were 'Cat, cat, God send thee a blak
shott' or 'Craw, craw, God send thee a blak thraw', with the last two
lines as before. When the witch in animal form entered the house of
another witch, she would say 'I conjure thee, Goe with me'; on which the
second witch would turn into the same kind of animal as the first. If,
however, they met in the open, the formula was slightly different,
'Divell speid the, Goe thow with me,' the result being the same.

\[1. From a trial in the Guernsey Greffe.

2\. Pitcairn, iii, pp. 607-8, 611.\]

The Somerset trials record the words used for cursing anything. These
were simply 'A Pox take it', the curse being supposed to take effect at
once. If the curse were pronounced over an image of a person the words
were 'A Pox on thee, I'le spite thee'.\[1\]

Alexander Elder's grace over meat is probably a corrupt form of some
ancient rite:

We eat this meat in the Divellis nam,  
With sorrow, and sych, and meikle shame;  
We sall destroy hows and hald;  
Both sheip and noat in till the fald.  
Litle good sall come to the fore  
Of all the rest of the litle store.'\[2\]

The 'conjuring of cats' was a distinct feature, and is clearly derived
from an early form of sacrifice. The details are recorded only in
Scotland, and it is possible that Scotland is the only country in which
it occurred, though the sanctity of the cat in other places suggests
that the omission in the records is accidental.

In the dittay against John Fian, 1590, he was 'fylit, for the chaissing
of ane catt in Tranent; in the quhilk chaise, he was careit heich aboue
the ground, with gryt swyftnes, and as lychtlie as the catt hir selff,
ower ane heicher dyke, nor he was able to lay his hand to the heid
off:--And being inquyrit, to quhat effect he chaissit the samin?
Ansuerit, that in ane conversatioune haldin at Brumhoillis, Sathan
commandit all that were present, to tak cattis; tyke as he, for
obedience to Sathan, chaissit the said catt, purpoiselie to be cassin in
the sea, to raise windis for distructioune of schippis and boitis.'\[3\]
Agnes Sampson of the same Coven as Fian confessed 'that at the time when
his Majestie was in Denmark, shee being accompanied by the parties
before speciallie named, tooke a cat and christened it, and afterwards
bounde to each part of that cat, the cheefest parte of a dead man, and
severall joyntis of his bodie: And that in the night following, the
saide cat was convayed into the middest of the sea by all the witches,
sayling in their riddles or cives, as is aforesaid, and so left the

said cat right before the towne of Leith in Scotland. This doone, there
did arise such a tempest in the sea, as a greater hath not bene
seene.'\[1\] The legal record of this event is more detailed and less
dramatic; the sieves are never mentioned, the witches merely walking to
the Pier-head in an ordinary and commonplace manner. The Coven at
Prestonpans sent a letter to the Leith Coven that--

'they sould mak the storm vniuersall thro the sea. And within aucht
dayes eftir the said Bill \[letter\] wes delyuerit, the said Agnes
Sampsoune, Jonett Campbell, Johnne Fean, Gelie Duncan, and Meg Dyn
baptesit ane catt in the wobstaris hous, in maner following: Fyrst, twa
of thame held ane fingar, in the ane syd of the chimnay cruik, and ane
vther held ane vther fingar in the vther syd, the twa nebbis of the
fingars meting togidder; than thay patt the catt thryis throw the linkis
of the cruik, and passit itt thryis vnder the chimnay. Thaireftir, att
Begie Toddis hous, thay knitt to the foure feit of the catt, foure
jountis of men; quhilk being done, the sayd Jonet fechit it to Leith;
and about mydnycht, sche and the twa Linkhop, and twa wyfeis callit
Stobbeis, came to the Pier-heid, and saying thir words, 'See that thair

be thair sorcerie and inchantment, the boit perischit betuix Leith and
Kinghorne; quhilk thing the Deuill did, and went befoir, with ane stalf
in his hand.'\[2\]

Beigis Todd was concerned in another 'conjuring of cats', this time at
Seaton.

'Eftir thay had drukkin togidder a certane space, thay, in thair
devillische maner, tuik ane katt, and drew the samyn nyne tymes throw
