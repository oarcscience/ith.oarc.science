# APPENDIX I

### FAIRIES AND WITCHES

THE dwarf race which at one time inhabited Europe has left few concrete
remains, but it has survived in innumerable stories of fairies and
elves. Nothing, however, is known of the religious beliefs and cults of
these early peoples, except the fact that every seven years they made a
human sacrifice to their god--.'And aye at every seven years they pay
the teind to hell'--and that like the Khonds they stole children from
the neighbouring races and brought them up to be the victims.

That there was a strong connexion between witches and fairies has been
known to all students of fairy lore. I suggest that the cult of the
fairy or primitive race survived until less than three hundred years
ago, and that the people who practised it were known as witches. I have
already pointed out that many of the witch-beliefs and practices
coincide with those of an existing dwarf race, viz. the Lapps. The Devil
and the witches entered freely into the fairy mounds, the Devil is often
spoken of as a fairy man, and he consorts with the Queen of Elfhame;
fairy gold which turns to rubbish is commonly given by the Devil to the
witches; and the name Robin is almost a generic name for the Devil,
either as a man or as his substitute the familiar. The other name for
the fairy Robin Goodfellow is Puck, which derives through the Gaelic
Bouca from the Slavic Bog, which means God.

The evidence given below shows the close connexion between the fairies
and the witches, and shows also the witches' belief in the superiority
of the fairies to themselves in the matter of magic and healing powers.

1431\. Joan of Arc. Not far from Domremy there is a certain tree that is
called the Ladies' Tree \[Arbor Dominarum\], others call it the Fairies'
Tree, Arbor Fatalium, gallice *des Faées*\], beside which is a spring
\[which cured fevers\]. It is a great tree, a beech \[fagus\], from
which comes the may \[unde venit mayum, gallice *le beau may*\]. It
belongs to Seigneur Pierre de Bourlemont. Old people, not of her
lineage, said that fairy-ladies haunted there \[conversabantur\]. Had
heard her godmother Jeanne, wife of the Mayor, say she had seen
fairy-women there. She herself had never seen fairies at the tree that
she knew of. She made garlands at the tree, with other girls, for the
image of the Blessed Mary of Domremy. Sometimes with the other children
she hung garlands on the tree, sometimes they left them, sometimes they
took them away. 'She had danced there with the other children, but not
since she was grown up. She had sung there more than she had danced. She
had heard that it was said 'Jeanne received her mission at the tree of
the fairy-ladies'.' The saints \[Katharine and Margaret\] came and spoke
to her at the spring beside the Fairies' tree, but she would not say if
they came to the tree itself.\[2\]

Denied having a mandrake, but knew there was one near the Fairies'
tree.\[3\]

My godmother, who saw the fairy-ladies, was held as a good woman, not a
diviner or a witch.\[4\]

Refused to say if she believed fairies to be evil spirits.\[5\]

She did not put chaplets on the Fairies' tree in honour of SS. Katharine
and Margaret.\[6\]

Had never done anything with, or knew anything of, those who came in the
air with the fairies \[gallice *en l'erre avec les faées*\]. Had heard
they came on Thursdays, but considered it witchcraft.\[7\]

4th Article of Accusation. Jeanne was not instructed in her youth in the
belief and primitive faith, but was imbued by certain old women in the
use of witchcraft, divination, and other superstitious works or magic
arts; many inhabitants of those villages have been noted from antiquity
for the aforesaid misdeeds. Jeanne herself has said that she had heard
from her godmother, and from many people, of visions and apparitions of
Fairies, or Fairy spirits \[gallice *faées*\]; by others also she has
been taught and imbued with wicked and pernicious errors of such
spirits, insomuch that in the trial before you she confessed that up to
this time she did not know that Fairies were evil spirits. Answer: As to
the Fairy-ladies, she did not know what it was. As to instruction she
learnt to believe and was well and duly taught to do what a good child
should. As to her godmother she referred to what she had said
before.\[8\]

5th Article. Near the village of Domremy is a certain great, big, and
ancient tree called vulgarly The Charmed Fairy-tree of Bourlemont\[9\]
\[l'arbre charmine faée de Bourlemont\]; beside the tree is a spring;
round these gather, it is said, evil spirits called fairies, with whom
those who use witchcraft are accustomed to dance at night, going round
the tree and spring. Answer: as to the tree and spring, referred to her
previous answers; denied the rest.\[10\]

6th Article. Jeanne frequented the said tree and spring alone, chiefly
at night, sometimes in the day most often at the hour that

divine service was celebrated in church, in order to be alone: and
dancing went round the spring and tree; afterwards hung many garlands of
various herbs and flowers on the branches of the tree, made with her own
hands, saying and singing before and after, certain incantations and
songs with certain invocations, witch. crafts and other misdeeds; which
\[garlands\] the following morning, were not found. Answer: Referred for
part to previous answers, denied the rest.\[1\]

23rd Article. Her letters showed that she had consulted evil spirits.
Denied ever having done anything by inspiration of evil spirits.\[2\]

1566\. John Walsh, of Netherberry, Dorset. He being demaunded how he
knoweth when anye man is bewytched: He sayth that he knew it partlye by
the Feries, and saith that ther be iii. kindes of Feries, white, greene,

hyls, where as there is great heapes of earth, as namely in Dorsetshire.

and hee would blow into her a Fairy which should doe her good; and that
shee opened her mouth, and he did blow into her mouth; and that
presently after his blowing, there, came out of her mouth a Spirit,
which stood vpon the ground in the shape and forme of a Woman, which
Spirit did aske of her her Soule, which shee then promised vnto it.\[2\]

1633\. Isobel Sinclair of Orkney. Sex times at the reathes of the year,
shoe hath bein controlled with the Phairie.\[3\]

1653\. 'Yorkshire. There was (he saith) as I have heard the story
credibly reported in this Country a Man apprehended for suspicion of
Witchcraft, he was of that sort we call white Witches, which are such as
do cures beyond the ordinary reasons and deductions of our usual
practitioners, and are supposed (and most part of them truly) to do the
same by ministration of spirits (from whence under their noble favours,
most Sciences at first grow) and therefore are by good reason provided
against by our Civil Laws, as being ways full of danger and deceit, and
scarce ever otherwise obtained than by a devillish compact of the
exchange of ones Soul to that assistant spirit, for the honour of its
Mountebankery. What this man did was with a white powder which, he said,
he received from the Fairies, and that going to a Hill he knocked three
times, and the Hill opened, and he had access to, and conversed with a
visible people; and offered, that if any Gentleman present would either
go himself in person, or send his servant, he would conduct them
thither, or shew them the place and persons from whom he had his skill.'
\[Hotham's account ends here; Webster continues first in his own words
and then in inverted commas as if quoting, but gives no authority.\] To
this I shall only add thus much, that the man was accused for invoking
and calling upon evil spirits, and was a very simple and illiterate
person to any mans judgment, and had been formerly very poor, but had
gotten some pretty little meanes to maintain himself, his Wife and
diverse small children, by his cures done with this white powder, of
which there were sufficient proofs, and the judge asking him how he came
by the powder, he told a story to this effect. 'That one night before
day was gone, as he was going home from his labour, being very sad

\[1. *County Folklore*, iii, Orkney, pp. 112-14; *Maitland Club Misc*.,
ii, pp. 188-9.

2\. *Wonderfull Discoverie of Margaret and Phillip Flower*, E 3.

3\. Dalyell, p. 470.\]

and full of heavy thoughts, not knowing how to get meat and drink for
his Wife and Children, he met a fair Woman in fine cloaths, who asked
him why he was so sad, and he told her it was by reason of his poverty,
to which she said, that if he would follow her counsel she would help
him to that which would serve to get him a good living: to which he said
he would consent with all his heart, so it were not by unlawful ways:
she told him it should not be by any such ways, but by doing of good and
curing of sick people; and so warning him strictly to meet her there the
next night at the same time, she de parted from him, and he went home.
And the next night at the time appointed he duly waited, and she
(according to promise) came and told him that it was well he came so
duly, otherwise he had missed of that benefit, that she intended to do
unto him, and so bade him follow her and not be afraid. Thereupon she
led him to a little Hill and she knocked three times, and the Hill
opened, and they went in, and came to a fair hall, wherein was a Queen
sitting in great state, and many people about her, and the Gentlewoman
that brought him, presented him to the Queen, and she said he was
welcom, and bid the Gentlewoman give him some of the white powder, and
teach him how to use it. which she did, and gave him a little wood box
full of the white powder, and bad him give 2 or 3 grains of it to any
that were sick, and it would heal them, and so she brought him forth of
the Hill, and so they parted. And being asked by the judge whether the
place within the Hill, which he called a Hall, were light or dark, he
said indifferent, as it is with us in the twilight; and being asked how
he got more powder, he said when he wanted he went to that Hill, and
knocked three times, and said every time I am coming, I am coming,
whereupon it opened, and he going in was conducted by the aforesaid
Woman to the Queen, and so had more powder given him. This was the plain
and simple story (however it may be judged of) that he told before the
judge, the whole Court, and the jury, and there being no proof, but what
cures he had done to very many, the jury did acquit him.'\[1\]

1655\. It might be here very seasonable to enquire into the nature of
those large *dark Rings* in the grass, which they call *Fairy Circles*,
whether they be the *Rendezvouz* of Witches, or the dancing place of
those little Puppet Spirits which they call *Elves* or *Fairies*.\[2\]

1661\. Jonet Watson of Dalkeith. She confessed that three months before
the Devill apeired vnto her, in the liknes of ane prettie boy, in grein
clothes. As also about the tyme of the last Baille-fyre night, shoe was
at a Meitting in Newtoun-dein with the Deavill, who had grein cloathes
vpone him, and ane blak hatt vpone his head wher schoe denyd Christ, and
took her self to be the servant of the Deivill.\[3\]

1662\. Isobel Gowdie of Auldearne. I was in the Downie-hillis, and got
meat ther from the Qwein of Fearrie, mor than I could eat. The Qwein of
Fearrie is brawlie clothed in whyt linens, and in whyt and browne
cloathes, &c.; and the King of Fearrie is a braw mail, weill favoured,
and broad faced, &-c. Ther wes elf-bullis rowtting

Elf-arrow-heidis, the Devill shapes them with his awin hand, and syne
deliueris thame to Elf-boyes, who whyttis and dightis them with a sharp
thing lyk a paking needle . . . We went in to the Downie hillis; the
hill opened, and we cam to an fair and large braw rowme in the day tym.
Thair ar great bullis rowtting and skoylling ther, at the entrie, quhilk

1662\. Janet Breadheld of Auldearne. He gaw me ane piece of money, lyk a
testain . . . and gaw me an vthir piece of money, lyk the first, bot
they both turned read, and I got nothing for thaim.\[2\]

1662\. Bute. \[The devil\] 'gave her ane elf errow stone to shott him
\[a child of seven\] which she did ten dayes therafter that the child
dyed imediately therafter. Jonet Morisoune declares the devill told her
it was the fayries that took John Glas child's lyfe. Mcfersone in
Keretoule his dochter lay sick of a very unnaturall disease. The disease
quhilk ailed her was blasting with the faryes and that she healed her
with herbes. Item being questioned about her heileing of Alester
Bannatyne who was sick of the lyk disease answred that he was blasted
with the fairyes also and that she heiled him thereof with herbs and
being questioned anent hir heileing of Patrick Glas dochter Barbara Glas
answred that she was blasted with the faryes also. Being inquired quhat
difference was betwix shooting and blasting sayes that quhen they are
shott ther is no recoverie for it and if the shott be in the heart they
died presently bot if it be not at the heart they will die in a while
with it yet will at last die with it and that blasting is a whirlwinde
that the fayries raises about that persone quhich they intend to wrong
quhich may be healed two wayes ether by herbs or by charming.'\[3\]

1664\. Alice Duke of Wincanton, Somerset. When the Devil doth anything
for her, she calls for him by the name of *Robin*, upon which he
appears.\[4\]

1664\. Elizabeth Style of Wincanton, Somerset. When she hath a desire to
do harm, she calls the Spirit by the name of *Robin*.\[5\]

1670\. Jean Weir of Edinburgh. When she keeped a school at Dalkeith, and
teached childering, ane tall woman came to the declarant's hous when the
childering were there; she had, as appeared to her, ane chyld upon her
back, and on or two at her foot; and the said woman desyred that the
declarant should imploy her to spick for her to the Queen of Farie, and
strik and battle in her behalf with the said Queen (which was her own
words).\[6\]

1677\. Inveraray. Donald McIlmichall was tried 'for that horrid cryme of
corresponding with the devill'; the whole evidence being that he entered
a fairy hill where he met many men and women 'and he playd on trumps to
them quhen they danced'.\[7\]

Mark of it, and acknowledged that her Husband had brought her back from
the *Fairies*.\[1\]

1697\. James Lindsay, alias Curat, in Renfrewshire. He was called the
Gleid, or Squint-Ey'd Elff.\[2\]

Nineteenth century. It was the common rumour that Elphin Irving came not
into the world like the other sinful creatures of the earth, but was one
of the Kane-bairns of the fairies, whilk they had to pay to the enemy of
man's salvation every seventh year. The poor lady-fairy,--a mother's aye
a mother, be she Elve's flesh or Eve's flesh,--hid her Elf son beside
the christened flesh in Marion Irving's cradle, and the auld enemy lost
his prey for a time . . . And touching this lad, ye all ken his mother
was a hawk of an uncannie nest, a second cousin of Kate Kimmer, of
Barfloshan, as rank a witch as ever rode on ragwort.\[3\]
