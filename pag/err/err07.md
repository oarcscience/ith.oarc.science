# CHAPTER IV

### FAFLON

"Oh, Fufluns! Fufluns! awful deity!"--*Pumpus of Perusia in the
Gaudeamus* of W. SCHEFFEL

"But it went better with Bacchus than it did with Mars or Apollo after
the grand retreat of the gods."--HEINE, *The Gods in Exile*

![](img/06501.jpg)THE Arno, which rushes roaring before the window where
I am writing, swelled by much rain to a spring flood, is now a great
river, very muddy and somewhat unmanageable. I have seen it in summer
when it was limpid and clear, but then it was only a rivulet which went
from one shining pool to another, like a silken thread scantily strung
with sun-lit pearls, or a pilgrim wandering from shrine to shrine. It
would have been easy then for a hundred people to carry it all away in
barrels, or for all the population of the place to drink it up--as they
would assuredly have done like "Macpherson," had it been wine. Now all
the men in Tuscany, with all their buckets, could make no estimate of
its water.

APLU, FUFLUNS, AND SEMELE

 

This reminds me of the task on which I am engaged. If it were only to
gather, collate, and correct a collection of fairy tales, or proverbs,
or parables,

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

or games, or Exempla, it would be an easy, or at least a *defined* work.
Such pools are not hard to fathom, or count, or measure, or exhaust. But
this mass of old, obscure, unrecorded mythology, comes pouring and
foaming down like the Arno from the mountains of La Romagna, in whose
mysterious recesses still dwells

"the dragon's ancient brood,  
And rocks fall over roaring in the flood."

Well, it is a strange country little known--we have Goethe's word for
that--and it has sent me, all in a spring freshet, obscure deities of
doubtful name and fame, sorceries, rhymes, legends--dirt and
diamonds--*tutti confusi e misti*. What should I give? What should I
suppress? As compared to anything which I have as yet met in folk-lore
this has been more like counting Ossian's ghosts than aught else. Many a
time have I almost despaired over it, and many a time been awed.

But hope springs eternal in the human breast, and so I will proceed to
discuss my last discovery of a divinity who is generally supposed to
have utterly died out nearly two thousand years ago, and yet who lives
as a real *folletto* among a few old witches in La Romagna. I mean
*Faflon*.

FUFLUNUS was the Etruscan Bacchus. "His name," writes MÜLLER (Die
Etrusker, vol. ii., p. 79), "was sounded (*lautet*) Fuflunus, Fuflunu,
Fufluns--generally Fufluns. GERHARDT, i., 83, 84, 87, 90, &c.; CORSSEN
(i., p. 313-5). We find on goblets *Fufunl* (FAHR. P, Spl. n. 453) and
Fuflunsl (CORSSEN, i., p. 430), according to CORSSEN from *poculum*, and
*poculum Bacchi*. He derives the name of the god from the Indogennanic
root *fu*, to beget, *ab. Gerhard* from Populonia"--which is very
doubtful.

On inquiring from my best authority if there was in La Romagna Toscana a
spirit of the vineyards, or of wine, I was promptly informed that there
was such a being known as *Fardel*, or *Flavo*, but among the witches,
or those better informed in such mysteries, as *Faflon*. And at once
there was narrated to me a legend which was then written out:--

"*Faflon* is a spirit who lives in the vines, and when women or men have
gathered grapes and filled the panniers, then comes this *Faflon* and
scatters them all on the ground; but woe to the *contadini* should they
be angered at it, for then *Faflon* knocks them right and left, and
tramples (on the grapes), so that they get no profit. But if they take
it good-naturedly, he gathers them again, and replaces them in the
panniers.

"Now there was a peasant who greatly loved the spirits, and frequently
blessed them. One year everything went wrong with him, his crop of
grapes and all other fruit failed, yet for all this he still loved
Faflon and blessed him.

 

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

 

"One morning he rose to gather what little there was on the vines, but
found that even that little was gone. The poor peasant began to weep,
and said: '*Non mi resta che morire*. All that remains for me now is to
die, for I have lost what little crop I had in my little vineyard.' When
all at once Faflon appeared, but beautiful with a beauty like
enchantment--*ma tanto bello di una bellezza da fare incantare*--and
said: 'Oh, peasant with great coarse shoes, but with a fine brain, thou
hast loved me so well I will reward thee. Go to thy cellar, and there a
great quantity

"D'uva mastatata tu troverai  
E gran vino tu lo farai.

("Pressed grapes thou shalt see,  
And great thy store of wine will be.)

"Now what *Faflon* had said seemed to be like a dream to the peasant,
but he went to his cellar, and truly the wine which he had that year
made him rich, *e non ebbe piú biogna di fare il contadino*--he was no
longer obliged to live as a peasant."

No one can doubt that this Faflon--it was written in the MS. sometimes
*Flaflon*--is the Fufluns, or Fufunal, of the Etruscans. His appearance
as a very beautiful being is perfectly in accordance with that of
Bacchus. It is exactly in this manner that Bacchus flashes up in beauty
from disguise in classic tales. Bacchus of old carried off mortal
beauties for mistresses, and I now give word for word as related by a
witch a story of a modern Ariadne:--

"There was a contadino who had several vineyards, yet all went so ill
with them for several years that he had not wine enough to drink for his
family.

"Now he had a daughter--*di una belleza da fare incantare*--of
enchanting beauty. And one evening as he was sitting almost in despair,
his daughter said: 'Father, dear, do you not know how all this came to
pass? Have you forgotten that strange and beautiful youth who once came
to you and begged for me--he was so much in love? And when you denied
him what he asked, he replied: "If I cannot have her neither shall you
have any vintage."'

"Then the peasant was very angry, and beat his daughter, so that she had
to go to bed. Then he went into the cellar, but what a sight be saw! On
all the barrels were devils frolicking; fire flashed from their eyes and
flamed from their mouths, and as they danced they sang:--

Give Faflon that girl of thine,  
And henceforth thou shalt have wine  
If the maiden you deny,  
As a beggar thou shalt die.'

"Then the man gave his daughter to Faflon, and lo! all the barrels were
filled with the best, and from that time his vintages were abundant."

The picture of the cellar full of frisking Bacchanals and Fauns is good.
I suspect that a Catholic influence made them "devils with fire coming
out of their mouths." But perhaps it was only

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

 

"Il vino divino  
Che fiammeggia nel Sansovino."

The wine divine  
Which flames so red in Sansovine.")

 

I should have been really sorry if, after all this fine Bacchic lore, I
had not found a hymn to him. And here it is. When a peasant wants a good
vintage he may possibly pray for it in church, but to make sure of it he
repeats the following to the jovial god:--

 

"Faflon, Faflon, Faflon!  
A vuoi mi raccomando!  
Che l'uva nella mia vigna  
E multa scarsa,  
E vuoi mi raccomando,  
Che mi fate avere  
Buona vendemmia!

Faflon, Faflon, Faflon!  
A vuoi mi raccomando!  
Che il vino nella mia cantina  
Me lo fate venire fondante,  
E molto buono,  
Faflon, Faflon, Faflon!"

("Faflon, Faflon, Faflon!"  
Oh, listen to my prayer.  
I have a scanty vintage,  
My vines this year are bare  
Oh, listen to my prayer!  
And put, since thou canst do so,  
A better vintage there!

Faflon, Faflon, Faflon!  
Oh, listen to my prayer  
May all the wine in my cellar  
Prove to be strong and rare,  
And good as any grown,  
Faflon, Faflon, Faflon!")

 

There, reader, is the very last real and sincere hymn to Bacchus which
was ever sung in Italy-probably the last truly Bacchanalian song which
will ever be heard on earth. There have been whole libraries of such
lyrics--Della Cruscan Redi wrote a *Bacco in Toscana*; but that was
art--this is religion. And what is stranger is that this Bacchic hymn
was possibly, in some form, not much unlike it, also the first which was
ever composed.

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

I should add that after the above was written my two contadino friends,
who made a special business of going on market days to pick up the
testimony of old peasants from all parts of La Romagna, fully confirmed
the existence of this spirit, with this variation--that Ottavio Magrini
wrote the name Faflond, while Peppino declares, "*Il name legitimo di
questo spirito e Faflo*" ("The legitimate name of this spirit is
Faflo"). It was one of the gods who were specially inquired for or cried
at the market-place and elsewhere with satisfactory result.

Fufluns was also anciently known as Vertumnus. "Allied to him," says
Dennis, "probably more than in name, was Voltumna, the great goddess at
whose shrine the confederate princes of Etruria held their councils"
(*Cities, &c., of Etruria*, vol. i., p. lvii.).

#### LO SPIRITO DELLA CONTENTEZZA

The spirit of Content is certainly a very good one, and I wish with all
my heart that it may dwell with my reader, not only as regards this
book, but be in all his life in everything. It is very creditable to the
Italians that in such a terribly overtaxed country the idea of a spirit
of content can be entertained, however, it is certain that they do
invoke her when setting out on a journey to seek fortune. And it is
uttered as follows:--

"When one is about to travel to seek fortune he says to his friends:--

"'Vado in viaggio  
Per fare fortuna.'

("'I am going on my way  
To find a fortune if I may.')

"Then his friends reply:--

"'Che lo spirito della contentezza  
Ti possa guidare sempre!'

("'May the spirit of content  
Guide thy steps wherever bent!')

"Then the traveller may go his way joyous and at case, sure that he will
succeed, but he must never forget that it is due to the Spirit of
Content."

There can be no question but that this Spirit of Content is the *Fortuna
Redux*, "the goddess of happy journeys, and of prosperous returns, to
whom, after the long absence of the Emperor AUGUSTUS, altars, temples,
and sacrifices were ordained." When Augustus (B.C. 19) returned, October
12th, from a long absence

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

in Asia, this day was appointed for an annual celebration of the event,
and an altar raised which was consecrated on the 15th of the following
December.

It should not escape the notice of the reader that the Italian account
of this goddess concludes with an exhortation never to forget that one's
good fortune will be due to the spirit which has been invoked; that is
to say, it is to an old Roman deity under another name that you will owe
success, and that the traveller is to be grateful to Fortuna Redux. This
is in truth a most naïf unconscious survival of heathenism.

Still in our ashes glow the wonted fires."

Schedius gives in relation to this divinity the following inscription
from a monument:--

 

"FORTUNÆ  
REDUCI. LARI  
VIALI. ROMÆ  
AETERNÆ  
Q. AXIS. AELIA.  
NUS. VE. PROC.  
AUG.  
C."

#### CORREDOIO

![](img/07200.jpg)

IT may be observed as a very singular fact, that all these Tuscan
spirits of the forests and fields, the fireplace and vineyard, are of a
perfectly fresh, unaffected simplicity, befitting the out-of-door nature
from which they are derived. Herein they differ radically and entirely
from every personification of the Roman Catholic Church, from the
Trinity itself which is a "mystery," down to the Cupid--cherubim, gilt
lightnings, hammers and nails, hearts on fire, Madonnas in silks with
gold surroundings, jewelled shepherd's crooks, and the whole mass of
mystical theatrical properties which indeed take hold of vulgar nature
in part, but not of all. This natural simplicity was of yore heathen,
and its existence in folk-lore is always a proof of certain elements, at
least of antiquity.

I remarked in my *Gypsy Sorcery* that if the Pope and Cardinals of 1891
had lived in 1484 and dared to express what they all (with the exception
perhaps of the Spaniards), now think of witchcraft, they would all have
been tortured horribly, and then burned alive as heretics. So we may
observe, that the whole modern machinery of the Church would have been
utterly damned by the Fathers, from its immensely artificial, stagey
character. Very revolting to many would have been its miserably
affected, moping melancholy, its wretched ideal of life

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

without laughter, and innocence without smiles. Apropos of which I come
to the charming spirit Corredoio, who is purely heathen.

There is in the Romagna a spirit, fairy or goddess (male or female), who
is of a gay and festive nature. She is called Curedoia or Corredoio, and
loves dances and festivals. She is a *vera fanatica per la musica*--wild
after music--and though you may not suspect her presence, she is sure to
attend wherever there is a frolic or a ball. I offer with all modesty,
or even distrust, the suggestion that we may have in her the *beau
reste* or possible fragment of *Curitis* or *Quritis*--the *is* and *us*
of Latin are very commonly changed to vowels in Italian, which would
make *Curitoio* at once.

"Curitis," says MÜLLER, "was the name in Falerii, where she was
zealously worshipped, of Juno." Magnificent festivals with every
circumstance of splendour and gaiety were held in her honour. White cows
were sacrificed, the streets laid with carpets (OVID, iii., 12, 13, 24),
maidens wrapped, according to Greek custom, in white garments, bore as
*cannephoroe*, the holy utensils on their heads. The Etruscans surpassed
any race of antiquity in their passion for processions, festivals, and
the intensity of their frolics. The Romans seem to have taken their
*style* from Greece, but their keen relish for splendid pleasure from
the *Tuski*. And if Curitis was the popular name for Juno, and if she
was indeed above all others the goddess of the *pompa* and the festivals
and of joyousness, it is not impossible that the name survives in the
modern deity of the dance, and what most nearly corresponds to the grand
displays of the olden time. Of Corredoio I have the following:--

"*Corredoio e uno spirito che va molto nelle feste da ballo*, Corredoio
is a spirit who much frequents dances and who in every way diverts
himself. (There are conflicting accounts as to the sex of Corredoio or
Corredoia). He is delighted to come in like a *ventata*--a gust of
wind--*e cosi si alza le sallane a quelle Signore*--and so raise the
devil--or the skirts--among the ladies, then he (or she) bursts into
loud laughter, so that the ladies blush. Then Corredoio flies up into
the orchestra, and makes all the musicians whirl round, and then he
makes all the instruments sound of themselves, and everybody is amazed
to hear music and see no performers--at which he utters another roar of
laughter--*e se ne va*--and flies away."

There is an incantation or invocation to Corredoio which is extremely
curious:--

"Corredoio, Corredoio, Corredoio  
Corredoio, Corredoio, Corredoio  
Che siei tanto buono e gentile,  
Che tu non ai fatto mai male  
Quando viene del male in casa mia  
O bel Corredoio vai e la discacci  
Con una bella risata, <span id="page_74">p. 74</span>  
Tu o bel Corredoio sei un spirito  
E vero, ma sei anche lo spirito  
Dell' allegria; tu vai nelle case  
A mettere la buona armonia;  
Dunque bel Corredoio tu che sei  
Tanto bello, viene qualche volta  
In camera mia, e cosi  
Mi aiuterai a stare allegro,  
E non avere mai guai e cosi  
Se qualche grazia ti chiedero,  
Da te bel Corredoio, sono certo,  
Che quella grazia di te io l'avro.

("Corredoio, Corredoio, Corredoio!  
Thou who art so pleasant and benign,  
Thou who never dids't do harm to any,  
Should any sorrow come into my house  
Oh, fair Corredoio, send it flying  
With a ringing peal of merry laughter.  
Thou, fair Corredoio, art a spirit,  
Truly but thou also art a spirit  
Of all merriment, thou enterest houses  
To promote all loving peace and union,  
And so, fair spirit, since thou art so kind,  
Come now and then I pray thee to my room,  
And help me to maintain a merry mind,  
And never know a sorrow--and if thou  
Can'st grant me some small grace which I may ask  
Of thee, fair Corredoio, this is sure,  
That when I ask that grace thou'lt grant it me.")

The reader who understands Italian, if he will make allowance for the
fact that it is only that of a poor peasant woman, translated "as she
went along," from Romagnola, may admit that this is a very remarkable
and beautiful invocation with a ring as of Shakespeare in it. It is
utterly out of the pale of the Church and as heathen as can be. There is
in the whole Catholic--I may say Christian--religion, no trace of such a
glorious Robin Goodfellow as Corredoio--one who goes to all the balls,
plays on all the instruments, whirls all the women in a wild waltz, then
wends him laughing, ho, ho, ho! and yet makes it his constant occupation
to go into families and promote peace and harmony, or please and play
with the children, and depart, leaving everybody jolly.

This invocation is as earnest a prayer in the Romagna as any in the
Prayer Book, and it begs the deity to sometimes "look in on a fellow and
cheer him up in a friendly way"--a deity who is very beautiful,
graceful, accomplished; it is only in Italy that one could find a god
who can "do the whole orchestra," and

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

who makes it the business of his life to make people happy. Truly I
cannot but feel grateful that such a fragment of light-hearted Paganism
has survived, if only to show to an astonished world that Piety and
Jollity can go hand-in-hand. The priests in Italy have been teaching the
people that religion and salvation and everything saintly is of tears,
wails, fasting, blood, torture, and death--yet all the while under these
ashes of misery, the old heathen Roman-Etruscan spirit of human nature
and genial tenderness still survived. In all the religions current in
all the world there is nothing so *real*, so touching, and so beautiful
as this spirit of Corredoio.

Sancte Corredoio ride pro nobis!

#### ORCO

"Cast up the account of Orcus, the account thereof cast up."--*Codex
Nazaræus*.

It would hardly be worth while to mention Orco, the Italian form of
Orcus, who has passed into innumerable fairy tales as the Ogre, and who
is known to every Italian child, were it not for the peculiar
description of him given by my chief authority. "Orco," she said, "is a
terrible spirit who was once a great wizard." For this is all the world
over the earliest conception of spirits, and especially of those who are
feared. Among savage tribes in the early stages of Shamanism, like the
Red Indians of America, every remarkable spirit was once a man, always a
magician. We may say that the Latin Orcus was a personification of hell,
or of the horrible, just as Jupiter was of lightning, <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) but, etymology to the contrary, it is a fact
that rude races apply such names as hell and lightning to men. According
to Euhemerus of Messina, who derived all gods from men, in which he
appears to have been, to a certain degree, right, so far at least as
rude races are concerned.

#### TESANA

Tesana is "the Spirit of the Dawn," one may say Aurora--"lo spirito
della alba." She is good, and while a contadino is sleeping when the
morning red is first seen on the hills she comes to him in dreams and
says

 

"Svegliando li  
Pian piano,  
O buon uomo  
Sveglia te,  
Che l'alba spunta:

 

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

LALAE LINTHUN THESAN MEMRUN

 

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

 

Sono un spirito  
Consolatore,  
Che vengo per aiutarii  
AI buon coraggio,  
Ed alla buona fortuna,  
Ma pero sempre  
Col tuo lavoro,  
E cosi con la buona--  
Buona volenta  
Di lavorare  
Avrai sempre  
Buona salute  
E volenta di lavorar,  
Il ricco e nato ricco  
Per aiutar il povero.  
E il povero  
Per aiutar il ricco,  
Col suo lavoro,  
Perche il signore  
Non sarebbe copare  
Alle fatiche:  
Lavora o buon contadino!  
Che al momente  
Spunta il sole,  
Quando sei stanco  
Chiamami  
In tuo soccorso,  
Ed io saro sempre  
Il tuo angelo  
Consolatore!

Waking, awaking,  
Softly and gently,  
Thou truly good man,  
Rise from thy sleep!  
The day is dawning,  
I am a spirit;  
One who brings comfort;  
I come to thy aid,  
To give to thee courage,  
To give thee fortune,  
But it will come  
Ever from labour;  
Thus thou shalt have  
Always good health,  
And good will to work.  
The rich is born rich  
To give aid to the poor man,

 

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

 

The poor man to aid  
The rich by his labour,  
For the rich is unequal  
To such heavy labour;  
Work then, good peasant  
The sun is rising.  
When thou art weary,  
Call me to aid thee,  
And I will be ever  
An angel consoling.)

 

"And so the peasant awakes and goes to his work, contented and
*allegro*--gay at heart--believing that he has seen in a dream and
conversed with a saint-*santo, o una sauta*--when instead of that he has
been talking with a *spirit*."

This is absolutely heathen--witch-heathen--and a protest of "the old
religion" against the new. For "a spirit *instead* of a saint" means
here simply nothing but an old Romano-Etruscan or pure Etruscan deity.
There are no such very beautiful incarnations of the Dawn in the Roman
Catholic mythology with its wooden-plaster rococo saints who are all of
the stage stagey, and of the shop shoppy, even here in Italy. This
graceful Aurora--this *spirito della alba*--belongs to a purer and
better race of beings. She comes out of true love to the peasant, asking
neither tithes, prayers, or worship, fasting nor vigils, to please her
vanity, but simply cheering him. This is very heathenish indeed, and
quite in keeping with her simple old-time conservatism--that rich and
poor must exist and observe mutual obligations one to the other.

A learned friend who has revised this work, remarks of Tesana, that
Thesan, according to Corssen, is an Etruscan goddess of the dawn (*Die
Sprache der Etrusker*, i., p. 259).

It cannot have escaped the reader that Tesana appears strangely in this
legend as reflecting on stages, of society, human laws, and relations.
This is decidedly marked. And Gerhard (*Gottheiten d. Etrusker*, p. 39,
and *Etrus. Spiegeln*, plate 76) remarks that there was an identity
between Thesan and Themis. This if accidental is certainly
extraordinary. Before I had met with this observation I had been deeply
impressed with the remarkable character of the reflections as to social
rights which are so prominent in the song, and which were far above the
range of thought of the woman who sung it.

#### SPULVIERO

It is remarkable that as the ancient Tusci surpassed all other nations
in the number of their gods of thunder and storm--having, indeed, one
for every season--

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

so their descendants have also great fear not only of Tinia, or Jupiter,
but also of *Spulviero*,--the dreaded spirit of the wind and tempest, of
whom there is an account which might have originated among the Algonkin
Indians.

Spulviero, also Spolviero, is the Spirit of the Wind. His name literally
is probably derived from *polvere*--"dust," referring to the eddies or
whirls of dust caused by the wind--the Pau-pu-ke-wiss of the Chippeways.
It may conceal, however, a derivation from *pluvio*--"rain." But this is
the legend as recited to me and then written:--

"The Spirit of the Wind, called Spulviero, is an evil spirit--*spirito
chattivo*--who in his lifetime was a wizard, one of those wizards so
evil that he ruined many good families, people of good
hearts--*bonquore*--who did good to all--even those who had done good to
him. For he was so wicked that when any one had done him good, he at
once did them harm; nor could any one revenge himself on him, because he
flew swift as the wind.

"But, evil as he was, his turn came and he died, but before dying he was
in a hospital. And he commended himself to all there, patients and
servants, and asked if any one would take the inheritance of his
witchcraft; but none replied, for they knew him well. But a servant took
two brooms, and put them under his bed, and said: "Leave it to these,"
since but for this he could not die.

"So he died at once, but suddenly there arose a great, terrible wind so
that the hospital was nearly blown over, and his spirit departed in the
wind."

The legacy refers to the belief that a wizard or witch cannot die till
his or her power is transferred to another. The broom is an old Latin
charm against sorcery. What is very ancient and purely Shamanic in this
legend is the faith that all spirits or deities were once sorcerers. The
train of facts is intricate, but it may be followed out. The Etruscans
had risen to polytheism, still retaining Shamanic forms--but the people
have remained in an *earlier* stage, believing that every great spirit
was once a man. So that they have here really led back a myth to its
beginning. So Chuchulvia is declared to be a wizard, now become an evil
spirit.

But I doubt if this really be a relapse since it is not probable that
the peasants of Romagna have ever really changed since the beginning.
The Etruscan great and wise men developed gods, but the people while
accepting them always believed in Euhemerism--that they were only
developed magicians. And whether this legend be modern, or older than
the earliest Tuscan records, one thing is self. evident--that the spirit
of it is as old as anything recorded. Those who love the antique do not
always reflect that a pebble may be older than anything man ever made.

#### URFIA

Of this spirit I know nothing save that I heard it remarked, "*E una
donna che si presente nella casa*" ("It is a lady who manifests herself
in houses.") I believe she is a benevolent spirit.
