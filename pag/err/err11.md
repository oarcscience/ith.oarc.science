# CHAPTER VIII

### FLORIA

Dictes moy, en quel pays,  
Est Flora la belle Romaine."  
                         FRANÇOIS VILLON

![](img/13601.jpg)THIS very curious tale was one of my latest
discoveries:--

 

"This spirit, Floria, was once a fair girl who loved a youth who loved
her as well. But Floria had a female friend, and they trusted in and
told to one another everything. And Floria did not know that her friend
was a witch, or that she loved her own lover and hid it all from her.
But it was true, and the witch was very jealous and envious and evil.
And so one day when they were walking alone in the country the witch
slew Floria, and put on her garments. Then in the evening she came to
the lover.

"'Alla sera, 'la sera,  
Se presente al giovane  
Col nome di Floria,  
Essendo una strega.'

 

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

 

("'In the evening, the evening,  
She came unto the youth,  
With the name (form) of Floria,  
As a witch she had the power.')

"So the youth married her, and she had a beautiful boy. But one night as
the mother held it there came the spirit Floria, who took the child and
put it under the bed, and said to the husband--

"'Guarda che quella non é Floria!  
Floria son'io, io sempre,  
Quella che tu hai sposato,  
E l'amica che m'uccise  
Per sposarti, ma guarda  
Che a mezza notte ti scappa,  
Perche non e che una strega.

("'Seest thou that is not Floria  
I am Floria, I ever;  
She there whom thou hast married  
Is the evil friend who slew me  
That she might marry you; but watch  
Lest she slip away at midnight,  
For she is a sorceress truly.')

"And further that if he would slay the witch, she would ever protect him
and the babe, and come every night to visit him.

"Then the youth seized the witch by the hair and bound her to the bed,
and she howled and blasphemed horribly (from midnight) till three
o'clock. Then her witch-power left her, and she became as other women,
and said to her husband:--

"'Look at the baby,  
Look in his bed,  
There thou wilt find  
Crosses and garlands.  
It is a year now  
He has been enchanted.'

Then (the husband) gave her a blow with a hammer and slew her, so that
she died. And from this time he always loved the spirit of Floria."

 

In this tale, which was collected and sent to me by Peppino, it is
properly Floria who gives the blow with the hammer, and it is evident
that Floria is the real mother of the child, and that the witch came
after the marriage in the wife's form. Floria--Flora--was certainly
equivalent with Horta, who in Etruscan times was one with
Nortia--Fortuna--who drove the nails of Fate. I forget now whether it is
in the work of Inghirami or that of Eduard Gerhard that she is twice
depicted as holding a hammer. Padre Secchi follows Müller (*Etrusker*,
iii. 3, 7) in declaring that Horta, an Etruscan

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

goddess, equivalent to Salus, gave name to Orte, and that she is
distinct from Nortia, or Fortuna, the great goddess of Volsinii. "A
distinction between her and Fortuna is indicated by Tacitus" (*vide*
Dennis, *Cities of Etruria*, vol. i., p. 140 in note). But these very
objections prove that Nortia of the hammer was regarded as one with
Horta by many. And this legend of Peppino agrees curiously with it.
Dennis suggests that Horta was a goddess of gardens, therefore a
synonyme with Flora. Pomona was also a form of Flora, and in her legend,
by a strange change, it is not the witch who takes a female form, but
Vertumnus who appears to her as an old woman. Confused as all this
seems, I believe this legend to be ancient or classic. But it is very
significant indeed that on Etruscan vases the hammer specially occurs as
the implement of death in the hands of the equivalent of Nemesis, as in
this tale. It is, in fact, the invariable symbol of death, and is in the
hands of Charun and all the demons. Lanzi gives. a beautiful female
spirit holding it.

The crosses and garlands alluded to, refer to the "*guirlanda della
strege*," or Witches' Ladder, elsewhere described.

#### RA

I am indebted to Mrs. Hayllar for the information that there is a spirit
named Ra, who is much talked of in Volterra. I had not far to go for
knowledge as to this folletto, for the first native of the town, a young
shoemaker, who was questioned on the subject, at once narrated the
following:--

 

"Ra is a spirit who protects children. When they are in danger the
parents apply to him, and *li incanta*, charm him with these words:--

"'Dormi, dormi bambino mio  
Dormi il sonno degli angioli,  
Quando tu ti sveglierai,  
La felicita riaquisterai.'

("'Sleep, sleep, my little one!  
Sleep the sleep of angels,  
When thou shalt awaken  
Thou shalt be happy again.')

Then the child will awake free from pain or trouble, secured from all
danger, especially from that of falling into the *balze* (precipices,
subterranean pits or cavities) of San Giosto in Volterra.

"This spirit Ra was known in Volterra in the year 1001, for just in that
year he protected, a little child which had been enchanted to him, which
fell from a height of several yards in the balze, but upon

 

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

 

a pile of broom-plant (*ginestra*). Then the peasants came running to
save him, but he kept crying, 'Ra! Ra!' and when they had let him down a
ladder, he would not climb it. And while they stood above there came a
strange signore, who said: 'Ye cannot save him; I only can do it by
supernatural power. I am the spirit *Ra*, and now ye shall see how I
will effect it.'

"Saying this, he stamped thrice on the ground, when there rose a great
mass of broom-plants growing, by means of which, as from branch to
branch of a tree, they descended and brought up the child."

 

I am indebted to Professor Senator Comparetti for the suggestion that Ra
may be *Rhea Sylvia*. The Etruscans made all their deities male and
female. Rhea Cybele, the wife and sister of Cronos, and mother of
Jupiter, was specially the patroness of ravines, cliffs, and rocks (*Die
Götter und Heroen. von Stoll*). And it is as at home in ravines that Ra
appears. Rhea was also a nursing goddess, or protector of children. The
change of sex is of no consequence, for, as we have seen, Cupra and
Siera have changed theirs, and this was even commoner of yore. In the
story Ra raises a poor child from an abyss by means of the broom-plant,
and it is a curious coincidence that *Deus exaltat humiles* (God
exalteth the lowly) was always in the Middle Ages the motto accompanying
the ginestra, both being worn by Louis the Pious of France in 1234
(Helyot. *Description of knightly and Monkish orders*. German version,
1756).

 

#### BOVO

Come conosci tu Buovo? Mi sapresti dare notizia alcuna di esso?"--*I
Reali di Francia*.

It is an extraordinary fact that one may ask a hundred peasants or other
humble folk in Tuscany for mythical folk-lore and not find a trace
thereof, and then meet with one who would seem to be the chronicler, or
keeper of a museum of such curiosities. This is just the same among
American Red Indians, and it was explained to me in Florence, as it had
been in America, by the fact that in certain families only arc such
records preserved. Thus, while my very intelligent friend, Signora la
Marchesa di T., could not by the most masterly and adroit
cross-questioning elicit from her maid, who was of Volterra, the least
indication of any knowledge of such things as sorcery or spirits, I, on
the contrary, got from the young shoemaker of that ancient ville much
that was marvellous, and, thereamong, the following relative to the
spirit Bovo:--

"Volterra was not the first name of our city, for that was Antona, the
second Voltona, and the third Volterra. In the time when it was called
Antona there lived a prince called Bovo di Antona, who

 

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

 

was held by the people to be a stregone, or wizard; they also said he
was immensely rich, because he had made a golden chariot with four
horses of gold, and when in his last illness he reclined (*si fece
adagiare*) in it, and there died after long suffering. And when dead,
his spirit appeared and ordered that they should set in motion the grand
carriage bearing his body, and going forth from Volterra unto a mountain
called Chatini (Catini), which is in sight of the city, there bury him.
This was done, and the people believe that the chariot and the body of
the king still exist. For there have been many excavations in which they
have found relics of ancient days recording the epoch of this Bovo di
Antona, and in recent times they found, *le sue carte*, his records with
pictures representing his age (*raffiguranti i medesimi tempi*), but
they have not found as yet the great chariot.

"After this burial the spirit of Bovo returned at night to his palace,
which he adorned with all possible magnificence, and illuminated
brilliantly. <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) And all the multitude
seeing this illumination and festival could not imagine what it meant,
knowing that the prince Bovo was alone. But one evening certain bold
spirits among them, moved by curiosity, knocked at the gate, but there
was no reply. After midnight they heard merry laughter, and then they
knocked again, when the gate opened by magic, but in an instant all was
dark, and the people entering found all things as they had been in the
time of the late king's life.

"Then they knew not what had become of all that splendour which they had
seen from the outside, and concluded it must be done by the spirit of
Bovo. So it was decided that the boldest four among them should remain
there the following night, which they did. And at midnight all the
carpets and tapestries began to wave and move, and all the furniture
changed into objects of great value. Then they decided to invoke the
spirit of Bovo, which being done, he appeared, wrapped in a great white
cloak, and when asked what he required" (*i.e.*, what made him restless
and haunt the palace), "replied:--

"'Never having been loved by woman in all my life, I wish that this
palace shall be inhabited by a beautiful girl, to whom I will appear as
a beautiful youth. Should my subjects not succeed in finding such a
*bella donna*, then I shall be confined in this palace, disturbing the
peace of the citizens. But if it should be done, in recompense I will
appear to him who brought it to pass. At midnight he may invoke the
spirit of Bovo and I will ever aid to do him good.'"

This is evidently only the beginning of a legend. Buovo of Antona as a
hero of popular romance is well known. There are poems on him, and
Reiner has written a monograph on the subject, showing that he was one
of the champions of Christendom, and, in fact, our old friend Bevis of
Southampton. But I suspect that in this particular case a local
*folletto* with a similar name has borrowed the fame of the mediæval
hero. For, having read the popular romance of *Buovo di Antona*, which
forms the fourth part, or 142 pages, of the *Reali di Francia*
(Florence, 1890), I find that there is not in it a *single point* of
resemblance to the hero of this story, and that, far from having lived
unloved, the champion wooed and wedded the beautiful Drusiana, who died
of grief for him forty days after his death. The only Antona recognised
in the chronicle is very evidently the seaport of Southampton in
England, founded by Bovetto and named after his queen, Librantona:

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

#### ATTILIO

Attilio, Atiglio, Ottilio or Tilio--for I cannot quite determine his
name-is a *buon folletto*--a merry devil, very much the same as Dusio,
or a jolly Brownie in English folk-lore. But he is an awful tease,
especially of servant-girls, to whom, however, he makes love and with
whom he behaves quite like Dusio, sharing their couch, and in grateful
return doing all the housework for them, and making them no end of
presents. And it must be reluctantly admitted that despite his immoral
character Attilio, is very popular with them.

GUISEPRE PITRÉ, who certainly cannot be accused of credulity remarks
(Bib., vol. xviii., p. 163), that if we listen to what people of the
lower class relate, in all honesty, we must remain uncertain whether
these men and women are a prey to continual visions, or whether we
ourselves are dreaming with our eyes wide open. For my. own part, I
firmly believe that in very credulous communities there are people,
especially girls, who honestly believe that they see, and sometimes hear
and touch, supernatural beings. There are powers latent in us of which
we have no comprehension whatever, and one of these is that of creating
sensations, that is of reproducing or forming from Memory any
sensations, be they of touch or taste, which we have once experienced.

Unless this be true, I absolutely cannot explain many things which I met
with among the believers in all these marvels. The *strege*, with all
their tricks, believe in their own art, and carry fetishes. And that
there are girls who have Attilios and Dusios, and people who catch
glances of Faflon in the vineyards at sunset and in the wine cellar at
midnight, cannot be denied. So all life is for them a fine-land
fairyland, or a witch and devil dream, according to their disposition or
freedom from dyspepsia.

The following is the history and mystery of ATTILIO, as it was narrated
to me on the ist of January, 1891, by a Maddalena from Rocca Casciano:--

 

"Attilio is a good goblin, but he does everything he can think of to
worry servant-girls. There was once a very pretty one, but she had harsh
and exacting *padroni*" (superiors--master or mistress). "Well, it
happened that every day for three days, when the poor girl had cooked
the dinner, and gone to spread the table, she found on returning that
all the food had been overturned and scattered about. The maid wept
bitterly, but she did not know what to do. *Was she scolded?*--indeed
she was, till she was almost mad.

"But when the dinner was ruined on the third day in the same manner, the
master and mistress were *tutti arrabiati*. Then they said that they
were tired of going out to the *trattoria* to dinner, and that she must
do the best she could *a rifare* to dress up the remains. So she went
into the kitchen, sorrowfully enough, and felt more sorrowful still when
she looked over the wreck, and saw how little could be made of it. When
all at once she heard the sweetest voice close by her sing these
words:--

 

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

 

"'Dimmi a me Attilio,  
Se ami Attilio,  
Perche se mi ami,  
Il pranzo sara gia pronto.'

"And as she stood amazed and speechless, lo there stood before her the
most beautiful young fellow she had ever seen in all her life. He was
dressed in old style with long stockings, and velvet tunic, with long
curling golden locks and a little velvet cap with a white feather, and
the maid felt as if she could fall down and worship him, he was so
elegant and stylish." And what he sang was in English:--

"'Say you love Attilio,  
For his love is steady,  
And if you will love me  
Dinner shall soon be ready.'

To which the girl, quite enraptured, could only answer, 'Si--si--yes,
indeed!' Then Attilio sang:--

"'Attilio son io,  
Ed io' bisogna d'amare,  
E tu sei quella,  
Chi mi ai ispirato  
Tanto amore.'

("'I am Attilio,  
My heart for love doth call  
And thou art the beauty  
Who inspired it all.')

You may suppose that the girl was pleased. And he sang on:--

"'Si ti amo  
E ti amo, tanto  
Siei tu mi ami  
Sono Attilio.  
E sono un spirto folletto!'

("'If thou wilt love me  
I'll come at thy call  
All because I love thee,  
For I am Attilio,  
The merriest sprite of all.')

When lo! at a touch the dinner was all right again, and when the girl
served it the *padroni* said they had never enjoyed such a nice meal.
And every day Attilio did most of the work and was always with her, and
she could see him though he was invisible to every one else."

 

It is remarkable that while in all the Oriental and German or French
mediæval tales it is a knight or favoured man who wins the love of a
spirit, the Italian rather give the fairy lovers to girls. This is a
very curious point in folk-lore.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

The Dusio and Faun, and every one of the *prototypes* of Robin
Goodfellow and Puck, and the House-Brownie are represented as frolicking
sprites, always misleading girls. In the North, under chaster
influences, these wanton sprites soon sobered down into very moral
beings, not going beyond boyish mischief. But in Italy nothing has
changed, and so they still remain the same rogues among the girls which
they were even while satyrs hopped about in the woods, and lemures
prowled near tombs and witches took out men's hearts-and people were all
so happy!

Attilio is certainly here a *lar familiaris*, a spirit of the fireplace,
a sprite who ever since the days of Tarquin and Tanquil has seduced the
servant-maid in Tuscan families, even as he seduced Ocris, "she who
waited on the table" of yore. He is in the kitchen and he cooks the
dinner, and is altogether of the fireplace. Of his existence I have but
a single authority or witness. He corresponds altogether to the French
Lutin.

 

#### LA BELLA MARTA

(*La Madre del Giorno, or Mother of the Day*)

"Nam et Romulus post mortem Quirinus factus est, et Leda Nemesis, et
Circe Marica, et Ino, Postquam se precipitavit in Mare, Lucothea, Mater
que Matuta."--LACTANTIUS, *Div. Institut. de falsa Religione*, lib. i.,
cap. 21

By far the most prominent character in the popular mythology of Tuscany,
or of that which is not Catholic, is *La bella Marta*, also called
*Madre del Giorno*, or the Mother of the Day. I was at first misled by
the name into believing that it was Saint Martha confused, as are Saints
Antony and Simeon, with old heathen deities. But I soon found that she
had nothing in common with the Martha of the Bible, nor the one of Roman
Catholic hagiology whose image conquering the Tarascon I copied in the
cloister at Arles in 1846. I have, indeed, very little doubt that this
beautiful Martha is a transformation of the ancient *Mater Matuta*, in
which I am guided not so much by the resemblance of name as by the fact
that she has as *Beinahme*, or attribute, that of *del giorno*, "of the
day."

 

"There was," writes MÜLLER, "in the haven Pyrgoi, the great and richly
endowed temple of a goddess who was generally called by the Greeks
Leukothea. . . . It was doubtless the honoured Mater Matuta, worshipped
since the time of Servius in Rome in the Volscican land and also in
Etruria. The Greek and Roman antiquaries classed the two as one.
However, in Rome this Mater Matuta was regarded much more as a goddess
of the morning than as of the sea, for her name clearly means the
*Mother of the Day*, and when the Greeks translated it to Leukothea, or
white goddess, they may have thought more of early morning light than on
the white foam of the sea. The mother of the light of day could readily
be regarded as the deity which led man to daylight; for which reason, as
it would appear, STRABO called her Eileithyia. According to this the
goddess of Pyrgoi was one of the dawn, and of mankind."

 

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

The Bella Marta of Tuscany dwells in forests or fields, and, though a
spirit of the day, is worshipped by night. This, however, is to be
explained by the fact that all "spirits" are connected with the old
religion, now called witchcraft, and that its rites are conducted in
secrecy and obscurity. Martha is favourable to lovers and conjugal love.
The following incantation, which tells its own story, indicates clearly
as can be the fact that the sylvan gods are still literally worshipped
like saints, and are not merely evoked like goblins. A wife or girl who
is jealous of her lover goes by night to the most beautiful garden to
which she has access, and kneeling pronounces--

 

THE PRAYER TO LA BELLA MARTA

Bella Marta! Bella Marta! Bella Marta!  
Tu sei bella come una stella,  
Io ti vengo a rimirare,  
E da te mi vengo ad inginnochiare  
Per poter ti meglio pregare.  
La mezza notte e ora suonata,  
E da te sono inginnochiata,  
In mezzo ad un bel giardino,  
Che tu Marta Bella ne sei regina,  
Io ti porto un fazzoletto  
In una punta troverai,  
I capelli del mio amor  
E tu bella Marta fannecio  
Che vuoi, purche il mio bene  
Tu faccia tribolare,  
E mio marito tu lo faccia diventare,  
E che altra donna non possa mai amare:  
Se questa grazia mi farai,  
Tutte le sere una candela  
Accesa tu l'avrai,  
Questa grazia certo tu mi ai fatto,  
Bella Marta ti ringrazio;

 

In English:--

 

Beautiful Martha! Beautiful Martha! Beautiful Martha!  
Thou art beautiful as a star.  
I come to behold you once more,  
Once more to kneel before you,  
That I may adore you better.  
Midnight has struck,  
I am kneeling before you  
Kneeling in a fair garden,  
Where thou, beautiful Martha, art queen.  
I bring thee a handkerchief; <span id="page_145">p. 145</span>  
In a comer thou wilt find  
The hairs of my beloved,  
And thou, oh Martha, cause  
What thou wilt that my trouble may pass to my good,  
Cause him to marry me,  
May he never love other women  
Grant me this grace,  
And thou shalt have  
Every evening a lighted candle.  
This thou wilt surely grant me,  
Beautiful Martha, I thank thee!"

 

In the next incantation *La bella Marta* is distinctly invoked from
hell. I do not think that she is at all popularly regarded as infernal
or evil, but that this was done to distinctly distinguish her from the
*saints*--a matter which is strictly observed among the sorcerers. And
as the priests have always taught the people that all spirits not
sanctioned by the Church are devils, it indicates great constancy to the
customs of their ancestors that the peasants continue to adore them even
as infernal.

THE INVOCATION TO LA BELLA MARTA BY NIGHT

 

For this you should go into a wood or forest at midnight and look at a
star, and say

"Buena notte o Donna Marta,  
Non chiamo la Marta di casa del Paradiso,  
Ma chiamo quella di casa dell' inferno,  
Prenditi dei panni belli  
Alla presenza de . . .  
Prima mi em tanto amico,  
Ora mi e tanto nemico,  
Amici e nemici,  
Tutti gli sembrino, brutta gente,  
Fuor che io la sua stella rilucente,  
A stella stella da levante oscie,  
Da lui portante:  
Cinque dita per lui io batto al muro.  
Cinque anime io scongiuro,  
Cinque preti, cinque frati,  
Cinque anime dannate,  
All anima, alla vita  
Del tal. . . .  
In vita ne anderete,  
In pensiero la porterete,  
Per la barba e capelli lo piglierete,  
Col pensiero da me la strascinerete;  
Se questo mi farete,  
Tre segni mi darete, <span id="page_146">p. 146</span>  
Ports, picchiare,  
Cane abbiare,  
Unno fistiare;  
Se questo mi farai,  
Tre segni mi darai!"

 

Or in English:--

 

Good evening, O Lady Martha  
I do not call thee Martha called of heaven,  
I call upon the Martha named of bell.  
Take these fine cloths  
In the presence of . . . (here the name is given).  
Once he was so much my friend,  
Now he is so much my foe;  
May enemies and friends  
All seem the same to him  
Save me, his shining star.

I beat five fingers for him on the wall,  
Five souls do I conjure,  
Five priests, five friars,  
Five damned souls,  
Into the soul, into the life  
Of . . .  
May they pass into the life  
Bear this into his thoughts,  
Drag him by beard and hair,  
Drag him by remembrances of me!  
If you will do this for me,  
Three signs you will give me-  
A knocking at the door,  
A dog barking,  
A man whistling.  
Should'st thou favourable be,  
These three signs thou'lt grant to me!"

 

This is considered as a very serious, terrible, and powerful incantation
or imprecation. The looking steadily at a star connects Martha
apparently with Mater Matuta or Leucothea, the goddess of light, and
Marta of the Day, for this star I suppose is Venus or the Morning Star.
There is a portion of this incantation which occurs in others. This is
the invoking several *fives* of priests and devils to enter into the
soul and life of the one banned. This, both as regards a category of
numbers and calling on the spirits to enter into the life and soul and
body of some one, corresponds precisely to what is found in Chaldæan
spells.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

A Paracelsian, or almost any writer of the sixteenth century, would have
recognised in this regarding the star an invocation of the astral
spirit, especially as it is mysteriously connected with ordering spirits
to *possess* a certain person. I do not doubt that there are in it
strange relics of ancient beliefs; one thing is certain, it is regarded
as very powerful by the witches, who recite it with deep feeling. And it
is remarkable how passionately this witch spirit manifests itself when
seriously relating spells or even while writing them down.

Bella Marta appears in one narrative as one of the benevolent witches of
Benevento, and also as a dryad.

#### BELLA MARTA AND THE YOUNG CONTADINO

 

Once there was in Benevento a great tree--*a sia una quercia*--probably
an oak, in which there was a cavity. The peasants passing by it often
saw a very beautiful woman, who disappeared they knew not where.

"But there was one young man who, moved by curiosity, said: 'I will come
here early, and I will follow the lady, and find out where she dwells.'
So he went to the wood, and quietly waited till she appeared, and then
went after her till she came to the great oak and entered it as if it
were a door.

"And then he also stepped in after, and lo, he found himself in a great
and splendid palace! One might have walked three days in it from room to
room without entering a new one--*camininando tre giorni, non si sarebbe
mai finito di girare*--and all of marvellous beauty.

"And so the peasant stood amazed,  
As on the wondrous scene he gazed,  
When entering the oak-tree there,  
He found a palace wondrous fair:  
He knew not where to turn his feet,  
To forward go or back retreat--

When all at once a small white hand was laid on his shoulder, and a soft
sweet voice was heard saying, 'Welcome!' And turning, he saw the
beautiful lady of the forest whom he had followed, and she said: 'Be not
afraid, I welcome thee, and will make thee happy, for thou art a good
youth, And I am the Bella Marta. Go thou and play, and always win, and
when thou wilt have anything, pronounce this spell:--

"'Bella Marta! bella Marta! bella Marta!  
Sei più bella d'una santa  
Al albero tuo vengo a pregare,  
Se una grazia mi vuoi fare,  
Se questa grazia mi farai,  
La mia padrona tu sarai,  
Qualunque casa mi chiederai,  
Bella Marta tu l'avrai.'

"'Lovely Martha, this I vow,  
Fairer than any saint art thou.  
Here I stand before thy tree,  
Grant, I pray, a grace to me, <span id="page_148">p. 148</span>  
And thou my patron ever shalt be,  
And if there's aught beneath the sun  
Which I can do, it shall be done  
For thee, thou ever lovely one.'

"*Qalunque cosa mi chiederai--bella Marta tu l'avrai*. So, whenever you
see a great oak in the forest, and repeat to it this incantation, you
will do well."

 

Here Marta is unquestionably a dryad, and the *contadino* is RHŒCUS.
Rhœcus was a great player--it was because he was absorbed in a game of
draughts that he beat the bee who told the nymph who blinded the boy who
cut down the tree which fell on the youth who had such a passion for
gambling.

This may be all guess-work and pot-shot hunting or point-blank firing,
but here in Tuscany the spirit of the olden time is still alive, and I
am writing in sight of olive-trees and crumbling towers of the Middle
Ages, and these stories of Rhœcus and the fair Martha, and the mystic
oak, seem, I will not say more credible, but more connected and
intelligible than they would in the North.

In the year 1846, in Florence, an English gentleman who had passed most
of his life in Italy, consulted me gravely and seriously as to what
numbers of several which he had chosen would win in a lottery. This
spirit of play and chance and of inspiration connected with it enters
deeply here into all Italian life, as it did of yore. Therefore I am not
astonished that it was the first thought of the beautiful nymph. She
knew her man.

It is worth noting that in Sicily the Mother of Light is invoked when
salt is spilt (PITRÉ, *Bib*., vol. iv., p. 144)--

"Matri di lu lumi, cugghitivillu lui."

La bella Marta is invoked when three girls, always stark-naked, consult
the *tarocco*, or cards, to know whether a lover is true or who shall be
married. This is, indeed, connected with the two incantations already
given. According to PITRÉ, Saint Martha is one of those who are
sometimes consulted in sorcery. Thus Archbishop TORRES (*Ricordi di
Confessori*, &c.; PITRÉ, *Bib*., vol. iv., p. 148) excommunicates "those
who utter prayers which are not approved, or even disapproved of by the
Holy Church, to bring about lascivious and dishonest love, and such are
the prayers falsely attributed to Saint Daniel, Saint *Marta*, Saint
Helena, and the like." The Mater Matuta, or Mother of the Dawn--that is,
Venus--may very well have been the patroness of lovers and the *Donna
del Giorno*, but it is difficult to connect the Martha of the Bible or
the Provencal conqueror of the Tarascon with any such aiding and
abetting of amours (to say

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

nothing of card-playing or divination) as we find in this Queen of
Beauty and Fortune-telling.

As regards the *three* girls meeting to divine who shall be married, I
think it is DION CASSIUS who remarks as regards divination by means of
ashes, "Vel cum aliquem tres personas cogitate jubet, quibuscum
matrimonii inire optet, tum tres ducunt sulcos in cinere" ("When three
meet to find out whom they are to marry, they draw three lines in the
ashes"). This confirms in the main the antiquity of the rite. The reader
will find more as regards this in the chapter on Divination by Ashes.

It may be observed that in the last incantation Bella Marta is addressed
as being "fairer than *any* saint." Here the Romagnola *stregeria*, or
witchcraft, which is utterly heathen and always jealous of Roman
Catholic influence, shows itself.

The festivals of the Mater Matuta, which were widely spread in Italy,
were called *Matralia* or Martralia, may give some clue to the modern
name of Marta. But I repeat here that I at first attached no
significance to the resemblance of the word Martha or Marta to *Mater*,
though there is absolutely no reason why it may not have been derived
from the latter, just as "pattering," or talking slang has been
conjectured to have come from *pater* in the *paternoster*. But I have
since found that M. L. F. Alfred Maury, in *Les Fées du Moyen Age*, had
the same idea as to a perfectly analogous conception. He writes:--

"Les epithetes données sans cesse aux fées, sont celles de bonnes,
bonnes dames, bonnes et franches pucelles. Ces qualifications ne sont
évidemment que la traduction du titre de *bonæ* donné aux parques,
plutôt sans doute par anti phrase que par reconnaissance, et de *puellæ*
attribué aussi bien aux nymphes qu'aux fata. Le nom de *Matte* donné à
une fée célère d'Eauze, pour laquelle on avait reproduit la fable du
Minotaure, semble venir du mort *mater* abrégè."

On this name Fraser (The Etruscans) has the following --

 

"Max Müller also speculates (Science of Languages, vol. ii., p. 152) on
the derivation of *mane* and *matutæ*. He says: 'From this it would
appear that in Latin the root *man*, which in the other Aryan languages
is best known in the sense of thinking, was at a very early time put
aside, like the Sanskrit *budh*, to express the revived consciousness of
the whole of Nature at the approach of the light of the Morning, unless
there was another totally distinct root peculiar to Latin expression of
that idea."'

 

Was this root possibly *mat*? It is worth observing that Tertullian
observes that the Etruscan Venus was called Murtia (*vide* Dennis,
*Cities of Et*., vol. i., p. 58). And as Bella Marta is called the most
beautiful of the spirits, is associated

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

with cards, and is identified with the morning star, it seems probable
that she is a form of Aphrodite or Venus.

#### DIANA AND HERODIAS

(*The Queens of the Witches in Italy*)

"Horsù dimmi, o buona. Strega, che vuoi dire che non andavi a questi
balli e giuochi di Diana o di Herodiade, ovvero si come le chiamate, a
quelli de la Donna?"--*La Strega di Pico delta Mirandola*.

"Hecate trium potestatum numen est. Ipsa est enim Luna, Diana
Proserpina."--SERVIUS.

It is remarkable that while witchcraft was regarded in later times among
Northern races as a creation of Satan, it never lost in Italy a classic
character. In this country the witch is only a sorceress, and she is
often a beneficent fairy. Her ruler is not the devil, but DIANA, with
whom, as I shall show, there is associated HERODIAS. The latter, as
presiding at the dances of the witches, was naturally connected with the
Herodias of the New Testament, but there was an older Herodias, a
counterpart of Lilith, the first wife of Adam, by whom she became the
mother of all the minor devils or goblins.

It is evident that in this capacity Herodias was confused with Diana.
The latter had been as Hecate the ruler of all the witches, while
Lilith-Herodias was the same among the Jews. There is a passage in
Odericus Vitalis (born in England in 1075--*Hist. Eccl.* v. 556) which
illustrates this, that Diana was parent or protectress of goblins. It is
as follows:--

 

"Deinde Taurinus fanum Dianæ intravit. Zabulon que coram populo
visibilem adstare coegit, quo viso ethnica plebs valde timuit. Nam
manifeste apparuit eis æthiops niger et fuligo, barbam habens prolixam
et scintillas igneas ex ore mittens. . . . Dæmon adhuc in eadem urbe
degit et in variis frequenter formis apparens, neminem laedit. Hanc
vulgus Gobelinurn appellat."

("Then Taurinus entered the temple of Diana and compelled Zabulon to
appear visibly before the people, who, being seen, was greatly dreaded
by the heathen folk. For he plainly showed himself as a black, grimy
Ethiopian, having a full beard and emitting sparks of fire from his
mouth. The demon went forth often in the same town, appearing in many
forms, yet injured no one. The common people called him Goblin, and
declare that by the merits of Saint Taurinus be was withheld from doing
harm.")

 

Here we have the Goblin as the familiar spirit of the temple of Diana,
the witch-mother, just as the Jews declared that goblins were the
children of Lilith-Herodias. How it was that the Shemitic myth came to
unite with the Græco-Roman is a matter for investigation. That it
existed is proved by the testimony of several old writers.

In the *Dæmonomagie* of HORST (1818), a writer who was far beyond his
time, I find the following:--

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

 

In the indictments of witches it is generally stated that ------, the
party accused, acted with" (worshipped) "Diana and Herodias. It is very
remarkable that we find this among the declarations of public Church
council--that of Ancyra in the middle of the fifth century--just as in
later witch-trials. It was asserted that certain women imagined that
they flew by night through the air with Diana and Herodias. But as this
was spoken of at the Council of Ancyra as a well-known thing, the belief
must be much older, and I do not doubt that there exist much earlier
historical records of this, which are unknown to me."

 

PAULUS GRILLANDUS, in his Treatise on Witches (1547), a great authority
in its time, speaks several times to the same effect, that
witches--*putant Dianam et Herodiam esse veras deas*--"think that Diana
and Herodias are true goddesses, so deeply are they involved in the
error of the pagans." And he deduces all the evil of their ways from
this false and heathenish beginning--*ex qua omnes alii errores et
illusiones successive dependent cum credant illas Dianam et Herodiadem
esse veras deas*. In which he very inconsistently ignores the fact that
he has elsewhere declared Satan to be sole master of the entire
sisterhood.

JEROME CARDANUS (*De Subtilitate*, 1. 19), in describing an altogether
diabolical evocation by a sorcerer of his time (*Quoties veneficus ille
rem non divinam sed diabolicam facturus esset*) says no word of the
devil whatever, but represents Hecate, or Diana, as the leading spirit
(*Execratur illis precibus, Hecate dictante, primum adorandam*, &c.).
That Diana-Hecate was Queen of the witches in classic times is known
from many authors; also that she was invoked in all *chthonic*, dark, or
nocturnal sorcery. She was compared, as the goddess of the moon, to a
cat which chases the star-mice. Herein she was like Bast of Bubastis,
the cat-goddess of Egypt; and Freya, of the North, whose car is drawn by
cats, is clearly a Norse Diana. What is remarkable, and to my purpose,
is that while witches in Italy are supposed to do harm like Canidia of
yore, they do it simply as *sorceresses*. The Catholic Church imposed on
the popular belief in witchcraft much that was foreign to it, in
Christian diabolism, and yet it is most remarkable that even to-day
Diana, and not Satan, is the leader and ruler of Italian witches.

And there are many points in this popular belief which are much more
ancient than Christianity. Thus in Venice, as in Florence, witchcraft is
not at all a result of a compact with the devil, but a peculiar
endowment, which may be transferred, even by a trick, to an innocent
person. I will illustrate this with a story which I heard told in good
faith in 1886 as having happened in Florence, and which has already
appeared in my book on *Gypsy Sorcery*:--

 

"There was a girl here in the city who became a witch against her will.
And how? She was ill in a hospital, and by her in a bed was *una vecchia
ammalata gravamente, e non poteva morire*--an old woman seriously ill,
yet who could not die. And the old woman groaned and cried continually,
'

Oimé! muoio!

 

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

 

*A chi lasció? Non diceva che*' ('Alas, I die! To whom shall I leave--')
But she did not say what. Then the poor girl, thinking, of course, she
meant property, said: '*Lasciate à me--son tanto povera*!' ('Leave it to
me--I am so poor'). At once the old woman died, and *la povera giovana
se é trovato in eredita della streghoneria* (the poor girl found she had
inherited witchcraft).

"Now the girl went home to where she lived with her mother and brother.
And having become a witch, she began to go out often by night; which the
mother observing, said to her son: '*Qualche volta tu troverai tua
sorella colla pancia grassa*' ('Some day you will find your sister with
child'). 'Don't think such a thing, mamma,' he replied. 'However, I will
find out where it is she goes.'

"So be watched, and one night he saw his sister go out of the door
*sulla punto della mezza-notte* (just at midnight). Then he caught her
by the hair and twisted it round his arm. She began to scream terribly,
when--*ecco!*--there came running a great number of cats (*e
cominciarono à miolare, e fare un gran chiasso*) they began to mew and
make a great row, and for an hour the sister struggled to escape, but in
vain, for her hair was fast, and screamed, while the cats screeched,
till it struck one, when the cats vanished, and the sorella was
insensible. But from that time she had no witchcraft in her and became a
*buona donna*, or a good girl--*come era prima*--as she had been
before."

 

There is nothing of a compact with Satan in this--it is a witch of
Diana, bound to the spell of the moon, one of the cats of the night. In
the Venetian stories a witch loses all her power if she is wounded and
spills a drop of blood, or even if detected. It is true enough that the
monks imported and forced into popular Italian superstition strong
infusions of the devil. Yet with all this, in the main, the real Italian
witch has nothing to do with Satan or a Christian hell, and remains as
of yore a daughter of Diana. There is something almost reviving or
refreshing in the thought that there is one place in the world--and that
in papal Italy itself--where the poison of diabolism did not utterly
prevail. There are in the treatise on the Magic Walnut Tree of
Benevento, by P. Pipernus (Naples, 1647), several passages in reference
to Diana as Queen of the Witches, one of which is curious as it seems in
a manner to identify Lamia with Lilith and Diana. It is to the effect
that the witches who of yore seduced youths to their death, were the
same with Lamia--*a Lilith hebraeo*, whence the Empusæ, Marmoliciæ or
Lares and Lemures, appearing on one foot in various figures dedicated to
Diana--in variis figuris Dianæ dedicatis. But Elias Schedius (see Dis
Germanis, Amsterdam, 1648), has with great industry brought together
from many sources, Hebrew and others, strong proof that Diana was
identical with Lilith, the two being identified in the Roman Lucina:--

Tu Lucina volentibus  
Juno dicta puerperis  
Dicta lumine Luna."  
                (*Catullus Epigr*., 35)

Luna meaning here, Diana.

Another singular remark is to the effect that there were as communities
of

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

witches in ancient times the Eriphiæ, from Eriphia, the Michaleiæ, from
Michala, Hecateiæ, Medeæ Circeæ, Thessalæ, in Sicilia Cyclopas
Lestrygonas and Herodiades--"communiori vocabulo in aliquibus regionibus
nuncupantur ex Idumæa *Herodiade* prope Jordani flumen habitante,
choreis, ludisquc venereis effuse fruente, quæ multos et multas ad suum
convictum trahebat, Dianæ ludorum memorans." In another passage Pipernus
conjectures that there was a Herodias earlier than the one who was the
cause of the death of Saint John.

In the Slavonian spells and charms, which are generally very ancient,
and of Oriental origin, Lilith appears the same as Herodias. She has
twelve daughters who are the twelve kinds of fever. This arrangement of
diseases, or evil spirits, into categories of sevens, twelves, &c., is
found in the Chaldæan magic as given by Lenormant. All things duly
considered, I agree with Pipernus that there was a Herodias long before
the lady of the New Testament who danced Herod off his head and the head
off Saint John.

In regard to which transaction I marvel that I have never yet seen it
treated by any writer from a modern society-Christian practical point of
view. Suppose a lady, an intelligent, accomplished widow, who had a good
thing of it as wife of the governor-general of--say Cathay. The governor
dies and his brother succeeds to the appointment, and marries the widow
(a thing actually commanded in the Old Testament, and a common custom in
the later time), or it may be the fraternal divorced wife. Uprises a
clergyman of a new sect, with eccentric new views, who has tremendous
influence among the people, and informs the governor that his marriage
is illegal. And then fancy the feelings of Herodias! On one hand,
divorce--perhaps death or poverty--with a charming daughter just coming
out; on the other, a prophet of the wildest description. And it was
considered to be such a remarkably natural, trifling, and commonplace
thing in those days to put anybody to death who was in your way, if you
had the power to do it--just as CALVIN did with SERVETUS when the latter
got in his way, or as some millions of heretics were disposed of--some
for their money--by Mother Church. And so Herodias did what I believe a
very great majority of worldly-minded High or Low Church Christian
matrons and mammas would do to-day under the same circumstances--if they
*could*--and put Saint John out of the way.

What I most wonder at in this story is, who was this Herodias--what was
her blood, what were her "havings," or belongings? There is nothing
whatever, after all, in this story of commonplace revenge to account for
her being taken up and made to occupy the position of joint-queen with
Diana of an immensely widely-spread confederacy of sorcerers and
witches. Above all, how came it that her daughter, presumably a Roman or
Jewish young lady, who had been respectably

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

brought up, danced a gypsy can-can *pas seul* before Herod and his
court? The mediæval writers have it that she "tombelede," or tumbled,
*i.e.,* threw flip-flaps, and "made the wheel" (as POCAHONTAS used to do
for the common soldiers in Virginia--as I have read), but then they knew
nothing about it. Or was she perhaps really one of those
Syrian-Hindoo-with-a-touch-of- Persian dancers--actually *gypsies*--who
in those days strayed about to every corner of the Roman empire?

There were mixed marriages in those days, even as there are now, and
there lives at present in England a lady with a very great title, who
was once a dancing Hungarian gypsy. One of these *ballerine* might have
wedded Herod's brother. Assuredly the dance which Miss Herodias executed
was not the holy *Chagag* which David danced before the Lord (2 Sam.
vi.), the sight of which had, however, such an effect on the king's
daughter Michal. And yet even the holy *Chagag* was considered a vulgar
performance--Princess MICHAL called it shameless--from which we may
infer what kind of a wasp or busy-bee performance the after-supper
tipsy-chorean bayadere *posing* of Mademoiselle Erodiade must have been!
No, it was *not* the *Chagag* which Rabbi DAVID KIMICHI says was danced
to the singing of the forty-seventh Psalm, but a very different kind of
a gag indeed, and in faster time.

But admitting that there was--'tis a mere conjecture, my cousin--a
strain of Syrian-gipsy-witch and devil-blood in these Herodiades--I can
well understand how the whole sisterhood of fortune-tellers and
sorceresses took up the story, and made the most of it--how one of their
kind had bewitched a tetrarch, and played Lola Montez queen in a kind of
Hamlet drama.

The dance was in ancient days something so wild and passionate, so
bewildering and maddening, that we of the present day can form no
conception of its real nature. I can remember when TAGLIONI, and
ELLSLER, and CARLOTTA GRISI, and CERITO turned the heads of the world,
as no dancer has ever done since. Before them others had maddened the
multitude still more, so it went back in compound ratio till we come to
the witch-times. Now, whether witches and wizards ever practised sorcery
or not--whatever that was--one thing is certain, that bands of male and
female sinners believing themselves to be inspired by the devil--and I
doubt not being very much inclined to raise him in a general way--went
forth by moonlight, armed with sundry brooms, divers pitchforks, certain
goats, *et cætera*, and did drink, dissipate, and dance all night.

Dance! I should think so! PRÆTORIUS says: "But the dances of the
sorcerers make people mad and raging, so that the women lose the fruit
of their bodies." Now it may be natural for certain females everywhere
in every country

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

to dance naked and mad--even among those in the first court circles--but
I must declare that the traditions of antiquity all point to a certain
Syrian-Indo-Persian origin for all this. MOSES MAIMOND tells us that
when the sun rose the daughters of the ancient Persians danced naked,
singing to music. DELANCRE, writing of witches, observed that witches
did the same as Persian girls at sacrifices in this respect. Now to this
day the dancing women of India and Persia are of common stock and
origin. Tradition says that a certain king of India once sent ten
thousand dancers and musicians as a present to the king of Persia, and
that they all turned out to be irreclaimable vagabonds. And all of these
dancers in all times formed a close corporation. It was only
professionals who danced. So that, taking everything into consideration,
I think it possible, if not probable, that Herodias, mother and
daughter, belonged to the very ancient if not honourable company of
witches and gypsies, and that their name, while coinciding with that of
Herod, had been attached in earlier times to a form of Lilith. And it is
not impossible that the chance coincidence of this name of Herodias with
that of the earlier witch-queen, had as much to do with raising the
Idumean damsel to celebrity among the witches as her share in the
decapitation of Saint John. For, justly considered, this latter gives us
no reason at all why she should have been preferred to such position,
while her bearing such a name would account for it all.

There are many people in Italy, and I have met such, who, while knowing
nothing about Diana as a Roman goddess, are quite familiar with her as
Queen of the Witches. One day I had brought to me as an invaluable
secret of witch-lore something which had been treasured up by the
sisterhood for a long time. What was my astonishment to find that it was
an old chemical trick, which, discovered by some disciple of Paracelsus
or Scheele, became common in books of "natural magic" in the last
century, and was familiar to me in my tenth year in the Boy's Own Book.
This is simply a composition of nitrate of silver and mercury, or silver
and mercury in aqua-fortis, which, when put into a flask, causes an
incrustation like foliage, whence it is called the Tree of Diana. That
name was enough for my innocent witches who, not doubting that it was a
deep work of dark magic, had treasured it up accordingly, perhaps for
generations, and gave it to me with the superscription: *Albero di
Diana--la Mga: (magia) delle Streghe* (The Tree of Diana, the magic
mistress of the Witches).

On one occasion I was given as a great find in the way of sorcery and
witchcraft, some poetry which I soon found consisted of about one
hundred and fifty lines from Ariosto. Truly it was full of, supernatural
diabolical description, but it was not exactly what I wanted. At which
my friend who had written it out was very much astonished, declaring
that as it was all about supernatural things she

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

thought it must be all right. And--"Dove diavolo avete pigliato tutto
questo coglionerie?" I asked in the words of Cardinal d'Este--"Where
didst thou rake out this trash?" "*Ma Signore*, I got it from an old
woman who had kept it for a long time as *streghoneria*," *i.e.,* magic.

As regards Diana, it may be observed that in the Roman times she was
specially worshipped by fugitive slaves, "perhaps because they hid
themselves in the forests." Thus it may be that the witches and wizards
as outcasts inherited a certain predilection for her. As goddess of
secrecy and of sorcery she would also be the patroness of those who
shunned the day and intercourse with mankind, Witches, outlaws, broken
men, runaway slaves, minions of the moon, and all the Children of the
Night were under her protection, and it is pleasant to think that in
ages when there was such enormous oppression of the unfortunate, that
the victims had, if not a God, at least a goddess to whom they could
pray.

#### OFFERINGS TO SPIRITS

As the same spirits of rock and river, fountain, cavern, and forest, are
believed in and invoked as in the earliest Tuscan time, so the same
offerings continue to be made to them as of yore. And when asking for
information on the subject, I promptly received several explanations or
illustrations of what the auditors understood by votive gifts. It must
be understood that these differ entirely in spirit and in form from
anything which is given to saints.

 

"Yes. For instance, if a *contadino* passes by a grove or a rock where
folletti or fairies or spirits live, he will there put into the ground
money or pins to please them, and say:--

 

"'Questo lo sotterro  
Per far piacere  
Agli spiriti (o alle strege)  
Che ne potrebbero  
Avere bisogna,  
E cosi a me  
Pure mi contra,  
Cambierrano  
Colla buona fortuna!'

("'These things I bury,  
That I may gratify  
Spirits or witches!  
That they may never  
Such things be wanting  
Or go against me,  
Changing my fortune  
From good unto evil!')

 

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

Or it may he that he passes by a fountain or a stream, when he will
throw his gift into it and repeat the same words, adapted to it."

 

But I was further informed on the subject in these words:--

 

"Offerings to spirits or *folletti*? *Si*. When a spirit comes by night
into a house and causes much annoyance as a nightmare, sitting on
people's breasts, and stifling them, when, if they show fear, the
*folletto* will tear all the covering from them, pull them out of bed,
and depart with a roar of laughter.

"To prevent this, make him an offering. What he likes best is three
sunflowers, laid outside on the window-sill. Then say:--

"'Metto questi tre girasoli  
Alla finestra, perche lo spirito  
Non mi venga tormentare,  
Dove si trova il sole a girare,  
Se in casa mia vuol venire,  
Almeno non mi faccia ingrullire,  
La notte in pace mi faccia dormire!'

("'In the window sunflowers three  
I put; and may the spirit be  
Here no longer to torment me,  
And with that I will content me,  
If so long as the sun goes round  
He may ne'er in my house he found;  
Let at least his troubling cease,  
So that I may sleep in peace!')

And when this is done and said, the spirit will cease from
troubling--*non potra più darle noia*--and the weary will he at rest."

 

The next illustration is very curious:--

 

"Sometimes goblins and witches meet in groves or gardens, and should any
one care to know who or what they are, let him watch from a window at
midnight. And he will see forms assembling under the trees, with one who
is *capo*, or their head, who gives orders. If they appear in human
forms they are spirits who pass freely as they will, and therefore
remain as they are. But if they are witches and wizards, they come in
the shapes of goats, kids, moles, or other animals, because when they
leave their homes they also leave their human forms asleep in their
beds, even to their shirts, and so must assume the appearance of or
become animals.

"Now, these witches do much harm by pulling up plants and breaking
boughs to make beds for their love-making, and so the *contadini*, or
the owners of the gardens or groves, spread hay or leaves or herbs as an
offering, and say while so doing:--

"'Questa erba fresca per terra  
Voglio spandere perche le strege  
Vengono a riposare coll'amante.'

("'I lay this grass upon the ground,  
So that if witches here are found  
They may comfortably rest,  
Each with him whom she likes best.')

 

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

 

"And this is the power which they have, that if they assume the form of
goats, they can take people who are not witches, be they gentle or
simple, in their sleep, away to their witch-meetings, and so they choose
the most beautiful youths and girls to make love with. Now, among the
wizards and witches are even princes and princesses, who, to conceal
their debauchery and dishonour, take the goat form and carry away
partners for the dance, bearing them on their backs; and so they fly
many miles in a few minutes, and go with them to distant cities or other
places, where they feast, drink, dance, and make love. But when dawn
approaches they carry these partners home again, and when they awake
they think they have had pleasant dreams. But indeed their diversion was
more real than they suppose.

"But if they look about they will always find in their room some money,
be it copper or silver, for this witch-money must always be paid. And
when they find it, or any pins or needles, they ought to cast then, all
into a running river or current, for thus they will be freed (revenged
on *potrebbe essere vendetta*) from witchcraft."

 

The object of laying sunflowers on the window-sill, according to ancient
symbolism, is to detect or find out the offender; that is to signify to
him that he is found out or known. Thus, in accordance with this,
ALBERTUS MAGNUS informs us that if any man has been robbed, if he will
sleep with sunflowers under his pillow, he will dream who was the thief.
For it is an emblem of the sun which shines on--that is, who sees and
searches out--all things. And as an image of the day it frightens away
spirits of darkness.

The third illustration, while it apparently flies wide of the mark, is
extremely valuable in really explaining one reason at least why coins
and pins are thrown into fountains. And it is of very great importance
as casting quite a new light on the cause of the transformation of
witches into animals. For in all the many works which I have read on
witchcraft I do not remember to have seen it explained why witches
assume the shapes of animals. According to this probably ancient theory,
their bodies--as BAPTISTA PORTA and many more believed--remain asleep
while the soul goes forth, or else the witch-ride is only dreamed.
According to my Romagnola authority, the witch-soul, for want of a
better shape, enters into some animal.

And yet further. In the works of PRÆTORIUS and others I have met with
mention of people who had often gone on goats to the Sabbat and
returned, yet who had never been wizards or witches. There is a story in
several books of a man who said he was wicked enough to have done so
several times in his youth, but who had discontinued the practice. I
confess that this puzzled me much, and often till I heard this
explanation of it. Those who took the goat-ride were not wizards, but
the mere dupes or victims of the *stregoni*. Still, they had enjoyed the
frolic, and were willing to have such dreams again. What the basis for
it all was I do not know, but incline to think that persons, while under
the influence of opiates or narcotics, were taken to wild-dances, then
dosed again and taken home, as happened to the shoemaker described by
Shakespeare.
