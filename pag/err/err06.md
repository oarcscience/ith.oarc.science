# CHAPTER III

### FERONIA

"The Etruscan Feronia--the Dawn--is also the goddess of trade."--The
Etruscans, by JOHN FRASER

"Vividi gaudens Feronia luco."--VIRGIL, *Æneid*, viii., 800.

"Ora manusque tus lavimus,  
Feronia, lympha."--HORACE, *Sat*. i., V. 24

![](img/05401.jpg)THERE is a kind of argument very much in vogue among
historians of the Mommsen class. It consists in picking a small flaw in
a legend or incident, or even offering an unproved conjecture of one's
own, as Mommsen does, and then boldly assuming from it that all is
false. No heed whatever is taken of the fact that this incident, or
narrative, taken with others *as a whole*, may have a basis of
truth--no--all must go at a guess.

I beg the reader to bear this in mind as regards several chapters, of
which the following is a type, requiring a broader and more liberal
method of judgment.

There is a goddess of whose identity with a modern spirit, or
*folletto*, there can be very little question. Feronia, according to
MÜLLER, was

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

the ancient goddess of the market-place and fairs. This would, as a
matter of course, identify her with, and make her the patron of, all
strolling characters who frequent such places. MÜLLER expresses a doubt
whether she was really a member of the Etruscan *Heiligthum*, or
mythology, since VARRO claims her as Sabine. But as she had temples in
Etruria, he deems it possible that she was common to both races. The
ancients were at a loss where to place her among the deities; she
appears, however, to be a goddess of the earth, and allied to Mania,
"which makes it intelligible how it was in her power to give to the
Prænestic Herilus three souls from the lower world." But what is most
important of all for my purpose is that she was feared, and that people
brought her offerings.

Feronia is at the present day "a *strega-folletta*--a witch-spirit who
goes wandering about the country begging alms in disguise. When the
peasants are liberal to her all goes well with them; but should they
give her nothing then they suffer for it. She bewitches children, oxen,
horses, and all the beasts *che tengona nella stalla*--which are kept in
stables."

A wandering witch, who exacts offerings, and who is rather evil than
good, is a very legitimate descendant from a goddess of the markets, and
who, as a form of Mania, is prone to mischief and revenge. There can be
no question but that the ancient Feronia was Persephonic or chthonic, or
a queen of the realm below--therefore a witch now, who, if not
propitiated, inflicts on the peasants what they most dread--loss of
children and cattle. Sabine or Etruscan, she still lives, and is much
feared in Tuscany.

Since writing the last line I have learned that Feronia haunts
market-places, specially "*Perche e le spirito del mercato*." I have,
regarding her, also the following, which was attributed to *Impusa*, but
which, I am quite sure, was an error of the copyist:--

"*Feronia* was an old woman who went about begging in the country, yet
she always had a *gran pulitica*--that is, she was intelligent or shrewd
or very cunning in manners--and, as one would have believed, she was a
witch. All who gave her alms were very fortunate, and their affairs
prospered. And if people could give her nothing because of their
poverty, when they returned home after the sun rose (dopo chiaro) they
found abundant gifts--enough to support all the family--so that
henceforth all went well with them; but if any who were rich gave her
nothing, and had evil hearts, she cursed them thus;--

"'Siate maledetti  
Da me che vi maladisco  
Di vero cuore!  
E cosi i vostr 'affari  
Possono andare  
A rotto di collo  
Fame e malattie  
Cosi non avrete,  
Non avrete piu bene!'

 

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

 

("'Be ye all accursed  
By me who curse you  
With my heart and soul  
May your lives for ever  
Go to utter ruin;  
Illness and starvation  
Be ever in your dwelling!')

 

By this they knew she was a witch. But when she was dead she became
terrible, and did much harm. However, when those who had wronged her,
and knew it, went to her tomb and begged pardon they were always sure to
obtain it."

The incident of the begging, and the elegant style and distinguished air
indicate a character like that of Juno and Ceres combined. The curse
attributed to her has a great strength, and may be of extreme antiquity.
The connection of Feronia with Mania explains why she was feared as a
witch. And it is very remarkable indeed that while MÜLLER lays stress on
the fact that. she had offerings brought to her, the modern Tuscan
account makes it a main incident. Taking her altogether, Feronia appears
to be exactly what such a goddess would naturally come to be in the
minds of the people at a stage while they still believed in and feared
her, and before she had sunk to a mere reminiscence in a *Märchen*. And
it is the *Märchen*, or child's tale, alone which is chiefly sought by
folk-lorists who have no conception of the extent to which the, as yet,
living myth exists.

The Roman-Etruscan Feronia was very famous for the extent of the
offerings made to her. "All who dwelt near brought her the first fruits,
and many offerings, so that in time an immense quantity of gold and
silver formed a treasure in her temple, which was all carried away by
the soldiers of Hannibal" (Livy, xxvi., II; Silius Italicus, *Pun*.
xiii.; Preller, Rom. *Myth*. 377). This agrees with the modern story of
her exacting tribute. Again, she was the special protectress of the
freed slaves--that is a friend of the poor--and the *Libertini* in Rome
made offerings to her (Livy, xxii., 1.). This is curiously identical
with the legend. If, as MÜLLER asserts, Feronia was a duplicate of
Persephone, who was often a counterpart of the charitable Ceres, this
would explain the very singular statement that the poor always received
their gifts from her "after the sun rose, *i.e.*, they came, or were
given, during the night. Her market and temple were also a great resort
for merchants and traders, which seems to cast some light on the
otherwise uncalled-for statement that she was of *gran pulitica*--very
shrewd. The modern Feronia is also a great friend to the poor.

But there is yet another reason why Feronia may have retained a
reputation as a witch or wonder-worker. She was of old especially
identified with the great miracle, of which so much was made during the
Middle Ages, of walking on red-hot

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

ploughshares or glowing coals. As appears by the following passage from
Strabo, Lib. 5:--

"Sub monte Soracte urbs est Feronia, quo nomine et Dea quædam
nuncupatur, quam finitimi miro dignantur honore. Eodem in loco ipsius
templum est, mirificum sacrigenus habens. Nam qui ejus numine afflantur,
nudis pedibus prunas calcant. Eò ingens mortalium multitudo convenit, et
celebritatis ipsius, quæ quotannis celebratur, gratia, paritur et
spectaculi."

The ordeal of hot coals was very commonly applied to witches, and it is
not improbable that the accused appealed to Feronia to protect them,
owing to some tradition. One thing is apparent both in the ancient and
modern Feronia, that she is, or was, a protector and friend of the poor,
one of slaves and refugees, as now of paupers. The identification of the
elder goddess with the ordeal indicates protection and benevolence. On
which interesting subject the reader may consult: I. Roth, *De more quo
apud plerosque Europæos populos per ferrum candens ardentes prunas
rogumque probatur*, Ulm, 1676. Lescher, *De probatione rerum dubiarum
per ignem facto*, Leipzig, 1695. Eckard, *De ritu antiquissimo per ignes
et carbones candendes incedendi, 1791, and Nork, Sitten und Gebräuche
der Deutschen*.

It will be seen, therefore, that the modern Feronia corresponds to the
ancient character of the same name in many ways. And I would call
attention to the fact that beyond the name itself (for which I indeed
inquired) nothing was by me suggested or demanded.

According to Fraser (*The Etruscans*), "Feronia in Etruria held an
honourable position, for not only was she goddess of Falerii, but she
had a sanctuary also at the Etruscan town of Losna, (Latin, Luna). The
name of this town, Losna, is another proof that Feronia is the goddess
of the Dawn, for it comes from the Greek *los* or *las*, light."

Monti has written a very beautiful, though rather feeble poem, called
the *Feroniade*, in which the heroine, as a goddess, approaches much
more closely to the same character as set forth in modern popular legend
than to the stately goddess Feronia of classic tradition. For she is
with him at first only a small sylvan Etruscan deity, the queen of the
violets, who wanders through ravines and forests, or "a nymph."

                 "Ella per fiere  
Balze e foreste erro gran tempo  
Una *ninfa* già fu delle propinque  
Selve leggiadra, abitatrice, ed era  
Il suo nome Feronia."

This is altogether our Feronia, and not the great goddess of the olden
time,

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

which she is subsequently represented as being--the reason for which
very evidently was that Monti began with an inspiration derived from the
popular Tuscan legend, and, as he wrote, by going back into classic lore
for material, entirely changed the character of his heroine. This is
absolutely the only explanation which can be offered of this manifest
blunder.

#### SILVIANO

"Silvanus"(the god of fields and cattle) "has still dominion in the
land."--The Cities of Etruria, by GEORGE DENNIS, vol. i., p. 229.

"Quin et Silvanos Faunusque et deorum genera silvis ac sua numina
tanquam et cœlo attributa credimus."--PLINY, *Hist. Nat.*, xii., 2.

"Fama est, Cyparissum puerum ab ipso fuisse amatum, quare ubi in arborem
sui nominis mutatus fuisset, Cupressum manibus semper gestasse Sylvanus
dictus finit."--De Hermaphroditorum, Monstrosorum, &c., *Caspari
Bauhini*, 1614.

Silviano was described to me, as "Lo spirito dei boschi" ("the spirit of
the forests or woods"), and his peculiarities were set forth as
follows:--

"Silviano is very fond of annoying the peasants who burn charcoal (*che
fanno le cataste di carbone*--literally, who pile up the heaps and then
ignite them). And when all the sticks are piled, then comes Silviano and
upsets them, and the *contadini* begin to quarrel among themselves,
accusing one another of the deed. So they have to begin their work over
again. Then Silviano roars with laughter, and the men begin to swear and
perhaps to fight, every one thinking that the other is laughing at him.
And while all this is going on Silviano piles up the wood again--to
their great amazement when they return to work.

"This happened once to two men, and they thought it must be a miracle
worked by some saint. So they went to the *parocco*, or parish priest,
and told him of it. So he went there and examined, but found nothing
remarkable, and told them they were fools for their pains, and so
returned with all his *precissione* (procession), persuaded that nothing
wonderful had happened.

"But good-natured as Silviano is, he is *altrettanto
vendiecativa*--tolerably revengeful. And from that day, whether in wood
or grove--*nella macchia o sia nel boscho*--nothing went well with them.
Other men found their work all done to hand for them, while theirs was
spoiled. And this time they went to an old witch who understood the
business, and knew what to do. And she said:--

"'E it folletto Silviano,  
Che l'avete contradito,  
E ora li vi fa tutti  
I dispetti, ma dell'erba  
Che vi daro vi fara tornare  
In la sua buona grazia.

("' 'Tis the spirit Silviano,  
Unto him ye were ungracious,  
Therefore he has made these troubles  
For you--but I'll give you something,  
'Tis an herb which will restore you  
Once again to his good graces.')

 

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

 

Then she took the herb called *silvestra* and also *ginestra*, or broom,
and made of it a small square, and said, putting it on their backs:--

 

![](img/05900.jpg)

SILVANUS (SILVIANO) AND NYMPH

 

"'Questo e to spirito  
Di Silviano che mi protegge!

("'This is in truth the spirit  
O Silviano, who protects me!')

 

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

 

"So they returned again into his good graces, and never did anything
more to offend him. And they learned from this a lesson not to go and
call on priests when there had been a spirit present."

Silvianus is plainly enough the old Roman Silvanus, of whom Preller
remarks: "He was like Faunus, a good spirit, but now and then a *spuk
Geist* who frightened people. He was identified with everything
beautiful, romantic, and rural. Planted pleasant fields, openings in the
forest, wherever there was a cool shelter, a shady grotto, or where a
murmuring brook attracted the shepherd in the mid-day heat, there was a
spot always sacred to Silvanus." So he became very dear to all rural
folk; he was like one of themselves, and traces of this love are to be
felt in this Tuscan tale.

For reasons, which I have not space to give, I would here say that the
ancient identification of Sylvanus with the *cypress*-tree fully
explains his connection with charcoal-burning and burners. And as a
spirit who specially haunts such men Silviano is identical with Rubezahl
of Germany. PRELLER declares that the Silvanæ, or Silviæ wood-nymphs,
belong rather to the German, Celtic, and Slavic races, than to the
Latin. But why? May not Rubezahl himself be of Italian birth? Silvanus
was the son of a river-god and a she-goat, and everything related of him
is far more suggestive of pastoral Italy than of wild Germany.

The utter heathenism of this story and its "moral" cannot have escaped
the reader. The narrator was as absolutely a heathen herself as any who
ever lived in the time of Tarquin, and never missed an opportunity to
show that she considered the worship of the spirits of the olden time,
and all its incantations and ceremonies, far superior to the Roman
Catholic, for which latter she had a special aversion. With the old
*strege* this religion of ancient times is not *folk-lore* but a living
faith, and I was often as strangely moved by this reality as if I had
been taken back two thousand years.

This chapter, and others, therefore suggest the possibility that the
Northern mythology of goblins may have been originally of Italian
origin, or from a common source.

#### PALÓ

This deity was described to me in the following words:--

"Paló is a spirit of the fields, vines, meadows, for all kinds of crops,
and when men work, be it in planting maize, or in the vineyards, they
must never forget to say

'"Lo spirito Paló  
Sara quello  
Che mi fara  
La buona fortuna!'

 

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

 

("'The spirit Paló  
He shall be  
The one who brings  
Good luck to me!')

And thus the peasant will be sure to ever have good fortune.'

It is not difficult to recognise in Paló the Pales of the Romans, or the
ancient deity of agriculture of all kinds. To him or to her--for *Pales*
appears to have been recognised both as male and female--offerings were
made by the peasants who also drank much, and leaped over flames.
PRELLER writes that in the morning the shepherd uttered four times an
invocation to Pales, then drank a mixture of milk and new wine, and then
jumped over blazing straw. Therefore the invocation must have been very
short, since it was so often repeated. It would be strange--and yet it
is not impossible--that in the four lines here given there is an echo at
least of the early invocation. There is so much which is unquestionably
ancient in these Tuscan traditions that I find it almost impossible
sometimes to believe that there is anything modern in them. Critics may
very reasonably indicate many errors and inconsistencies in details, but
a comparison of the whole must leave the impression of antiquity. A
single negro would not absolutely prove the existence of a black race,
but a number of them would render it extremely probable.

As was the case with most deities, Pales had a town named after him. It
is the modern Palo, half way between Rome and Civita Vecchia. I mention
this because it may be thought--as was indeed urged as to Norcia--that
the modern Tuscan deity was so called after the town.

#### ESTA

"Nec tu aliud Vestam quam vivam intellige flammam,  
Nataque de flammis corpora nulla vides."

                                         OVID, *Fast*. 6

When a light is suddenly and mysteriously extinguished or goes out
apparently of its own accord, especially when two lovers are sitting
together, it is commonly said in jest that "Esta did it." Esta is
supposed to be a spirit who pays particular attention to lights, but
beyond this I could learn nothing of her.

Hestia was an ancient name for Vesta, and CICERO thought that Vesta was
derived from ?Εστήα {Greek *?Estía*}. In any case the sudden
extinguishment of a light or fire,

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

and the satirical covert allusion to love in the dark, seems to indicate
that the goddess of chastity and her light are here alluded to. However,
this is a matter which those who are best able to determine must settle
for themselves if they think it worth the while. I do but record the
fact that Esta put out the light, and *then* put out the light which was
extinguished over Evelyn's bower.

#### CARMENTA

When I asked if the name Carmenta was known it was promptly recognised
as that of a spirit who gives, presides over, and loves children, who
aids in birth, and who is dear to mothers. Then the following was
repeated

Carmenta, Carmenta!  
Che tanta bella sei!  
E inamorata sei  
Tanto dei fanciulli!  
Tante spose sono venute  
A te a raccomandare  
Che dei figli tu gli facesse fare,  
E tu buona quanto e,  
Bella i suoi voti tu ai,  
Ascoltati ti prego pure  
I miei di volere ascoltare  
Perche sono molto infelice,  
Il mio marito non mi ama piú  
Che tanto m'amava perche figli crear  
Non so, ma date, o bella Carmenta,  
Mi vengo a raccomandare  
Che un figlio tu mi possa far fare,  
E la pace con mio marito possa ritornare!"

("Carmenta, Carmenta!  
Thou who art so fair,  
Thou who truly lovest  
Children, everywhere!  
As I come to thee,  
So have many others,  
Knelt before thy shrine,  
Seeking to be mothers!  
Thou didst grant their wishes,  
Thou as good as fair,  
Listen unto me,  
Grant my humble prayer!  
Once my husband loved me,  
Now he loves no more <span id="page_63">p. 63</span>  
Because I bear no children  
All his love is o'er,  
Make me once a mother,  
He will love me as before!")

This corresponds in name and in every detail to the Latin Carmenta or
Carmentis, who was another form of the Fauna or Bona Dea. Of her PRELLER
says: "The Goddess of Birth, Carmenta, was so zealously worshipped near
the *Porta Carmentalis*, which was named from her, that there was a
*Flamen Carmentalis*, and two calendar days, the eleventh and the
fifteenth of January, called the Carmentalia, devoted to her worship.
These were among the most distinguished festivals of the Roman matrons.
She was peculiarly the goddess of pregnancy.

#### IL SENTIERO

The boundary-stones which determine the limits of fields are believed in
Tuscany to have in or attached to them spirits called *Spiriti dei
sentieri*, which means, however, "spirits of the paths," or lines of
demarcation. It was, however, distinctly asserted that they lived in the
stones. "And if any one removes them the spirit will quite ruin him."
The single spirit is a *sentiero*.

This spirit is exactly the *Terminus* of the Romans, or the divinity of
the boundaries. Fearful penalties were attached to the removal of such
landmarks. The inscription of a *terminus* reads: *Quisquis hoc
sustulerit aut læserit, ultimus suorum moriatur* ("Should any one remove
or injure this stone, may he die the last of his race!"). There is
indeed quite a litany of old Latin curses, almost equal to a Roman
Catholic excommunication, extant, as applied to these "land-grabbers."
That the memory of these has survived is evident from the only comment
which my informant made---*Il spirito lo guasta* (" The spirit ruins
them").

Lactantius, heaping ridicule on the heathen for worshipping many deities
of small duties, specifies Terminus as one because he was rough and
rude.

"He was the stone which Saturn swallowed thinking it was Jupiter. When
Tarquin wished to build the Capitol and found these shrines of many
ancient gods, he consulted them by augury whether they would yield to
Jupiter. All agree to go save *Terminus*, who was suffered to remain.
Hence the poet calls him the immovable rock of the Capitol. And what can
I say of people who worship such stocks and stones (*lapides et
stipites*) save that they are stocks and stones themselves?" (*Adversus
Gentes*, book i., chap. xx.)

It is a pity that Lactantius could not have lived to the end of the
nineteenth century, when he might have seen among Christians an array of
saints of small

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

things, compared to whom all the heathen gods whom he mentions as
laughable are grave and respectable deities. Terminus, a rock, as the
emblem of stability (for he was truly nothing more), is a sound and
sensible image, but what shall we think of Antony as the saint of pigs
and truffles; Simeon of lotteries, or the Roco-co saint of dogs; or why
is the Latin Cunina, who presided over children in the cradle, and whom
Lactantius calls on us to laugh at, more ridiculous than Santa Anna who
does the same, or even the Madonna herself--the incarnation of nursing
motherhood? But the saints--and even the Virgin--had not "come up" as
yet in those days! Taking them all through,--the most crushing and
terrible condemnations of the later Catholic Church and its Hagiology
are to be found in the arguments of the Fathers against the Gentiles,
and especially in the vigorous satire of "the Christian Cicero."
