# INTRODUCTION

![](img/00100.jpg) THERE is in Northern Italy a mountain district known
as La Romagna Toscana, the inhabitants of which speak a rude form of the
Bolognese dialect. These Romagnoli are manifestly a very ancient race,
and appear to have preserved traditions

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

and observances little changed from an incredibly early time. It has
been a question of late years whether the Bolognese are of Etrurian
origin, and it seems to have been generally decided that they are not.
With this I have nothing whatever to do. They were probably there before
the Etruscans. But the latter at one time held all Italy, and it is very
likely that they left in remote districts those traces of their culture
to which this book refers. The name Romagna is applied to their district
because it once formed part of the Papal or Roman dominion, and it is
not to be confounded with La Romagna proper. Roughly speaking, the
region to which I refer may be described as lying between Forli and
Ravenna. Among these people, *stregeria*, or witchcraft--or, as I have
heard it called, "la vecchia religione" (or "the old religion")--exists
to a degree which would even astonish many Italians. This *stregeria*,
or old religion, is something more than a sorcery, and something less
than a faith. It consists in remains of a mythology of spirits, the
principal of whom preserve the names and attributes of the old Etruscan
gods, such as *Tinia*, or Jupiter, *Faflon*, or Bacchus, and *Teramo*
(in Etruscan *Turms*), or Mercury. With these there still exist, in a
few memories, the most ancient Roman rural deities, such as Silvanus,
Palus, Pan, and the Fauns. To all of these invocations or prayers in
rude metrical form are still addressed, or are at least preserved, and
there are many stories current regarding them. All of these names, with
their attributes, descriptions of spirits or gods, invocations and
legends, will be found in this work.

Closely allied to the belief in these old deities, is a vast mass of
curious tradition, such as that there is a spirit of every element or
thing created, as for instance of every plant and mineral, and a
guardian or leading spirit of all animals; or, as in the case of
silkworms, two--one good and one evil. Also that sorcerers and witches
are sometimes born again in their descendants; that all kinds of
goblins, brownies, red-caps and three-inch mannikins, haunt forests,
rocks, ruined towers, firesides and kitchens, or cellars, where they
alternately madden or delight the maids--in short, all of that quaint
company of familiar spirits which are boldly claimed as being of
Northern birth by German archæologists, but which investigation
indicates to have been thoroughly at home in Italy while Rome was as yet
young, or, it may be, unbuilt. Whether this "lore" be Teutonic or
Italian, or due to a common Aryan or Asian origin, or whether, as the
new school teaches, it "growed" of itself, like Topsy, spontaneously and
sporadically everywhere, I will not pretend to determine; suffice to say
that I shall be satisfied should my collection prove to be of any value
to those who take it on themselves to settle the higher question.

Connected in turn with these beliefs in *folletti*, or minor spirits,
and their

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

attendant observances and traditions, are vast numbers of magical cures
with appropriate incantations, spells, and ceremonies, to attract love,
to remove all evil influences or bring certain things to pass; to win in
gaming, to evoke spirits, to insure good crops or a traveller's happy
return, and to effect divination or deviltry in many curious ways--all
being ancient, as shown by allusions in classical writers to whom these
spells were known. And I believe that in some cases what I have gathered
and given will possibly be found to supply much that is missing in
earlier authors--*sit verbo venia*.

Many peasants in the Romagna Toscana are familiar with scores of these
spells, but the skilled repetition and execution of them is in the hands
of certain cryptic witches, and a few obscure wizards who belong to
mystic families, in which the occult art is preserved from generation to
generation, under jealous fear of priests, cultured people, and all
powers that be, just as gypsies and tramps deeply distrust everything
that is not "on the road," or all "honest folk," so that it is no
exaggeration to declare that "travellers" have no confidence or faith in
the truth of any man, until they have caught him telling a few lies. As
it indeed befell me myself once in Bath, where it was declared in a
large gypsy encampment that I must be either Romany or of Romany blood,
because I was the biggest liar they had ever met--the lie in this case
having been an arrogant and boastful, yet true, assertion on my part,
that though penniless at the moment to stand treat, I had, at home,
twenty-four gold sovereigns, eighteen shillings in silver, and twopence
in bronze. "And I don't believe," added the gypsy, "that he had a d----d
sixpence to his name. *But he's all right*." So these travellers on the
darkened road of sorcery soon recognised in the holder of the Black
Stone of the Voodoo, the pupil of the Red Indian *medaolin*, and the
gypsy *rye* (and one who had, moreover, his pocket always full of
fetishes in little red bags)--a man who was worthy of confidence--none
the less so since he was not ungenerous of pounds of coffee, small
bottles of rum, cigars, and other minor requisites which greatly promote
conviviality and mutual understanding in wisdom. Among these priestesses
of the hidden spell an elder dame has generally in hand some younger
girl whom she instructs, firstly in the art of bewitching or injuring
enemies, and secondly in the more important processes of annulling or
unbinding the spells of others, or causing mutual love and conferring
luck. And here I may observe that many of the items given in this book
are so jealously guarded as secrets, that, as I was assured, unless one
was in the confidence of those who possess such lore, he might seek it
in vain. Also that a great portion has become so nearly extinct that it
is now in *articulo mortis, vel in extremis*, while other details are
however still generally known.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

An interesting and very curious portion of my book consists of a number
of Occult remedies, still preserved from remote antiquity among the
mountain peasantry. Marcellus Burdigalensis, court physician to the
Emperor Honorius made a collection, in the fourth century, of one
hundred magical cures for disorders, such as were current in his time
among the rural classes. He gathered them, as he informs us in a work
entitled *De Medicamentis Empiricis*, "*ab agrestibus et plebeis*"
("from rustics and common people"). The collection has been edited by
Jacob Grimm in a work entitled *Über Marcellus Burdigalensis*, Berlin,
1849. These "charms" were very ancient even in the time of Marcellus,
and, like most early Roman magic, were probably of Tuscan or Etrurian
origin. Of these one hundred sorceries I have found about one-half still
in current use, or at least known. As given by Marcellus they are often
imperfect, many incantations being wanting. Some of these I have been
able to supply, and I think that no critical reader, who will compare
all that I have collected, will doubt that these Italian formulas
contain at least the spirit of antique originals.

In addition to this I have included a number of curious tales,
anecdotes, and instances, many of which are identical with, or allied
to, much which is narrated by Ovid, Virgil, Pliny, Cato, Varro, and
others--the result of it all being that a careful comparison of the
whole can hardly fail to convince us that the peasantry of the Romagna
Toscana, who have lived with little change since prehistoric times, have
preserved, through Etruscan, Latin, and Christian rule, a primæval
Shamanism or a rude animism--that is, worship of spirits--and a very
simple system of sorcery which can hardly fail to deeply interest every
student of ethnology.

The result of my researches has been the collection of such a number of
magic formulas, tales, and poems as would have exceeded reasonable
limits, both as to pages and my readers' patience, had I published them
all. What I have given will, I believe, be of very great interest to all
students of classical lore of every kind, and extremely curious as
illustrating the survival to the present day of "the Gods in Exile " in
a far more literal manner, and on a much more extensive scale than Heine
ever dreamed of And I think that it will be found to illustrate many
minor questions. Thus, for example, Müller in his great work on the
Etruscans could hardly have doubted that the *Lases* were the same as
the *Lares*, had he known that the spirits of ancestors are still called
in the Romagna, *Lasii*, *Lasi*, or *Ilasii*.

I must here express my great obligations and gratitude to my friend,
Professor--now Senator--D. Comparetti, of Florence, who not only placed
his admirable library at my disposal, but also aided me materially by
"advice, cautions, and criticism." Also to his son-in-law, Professor
Milani, the Director of the Archæological

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

and Etruscan Museum, and who, as an Etruscan antiquary is, I believe,
second to none. I would here direct attention to his great forthcoming
work, *Le Divinite è la religione degli Etrusci* ("On the Deities and
religion of the Etruscans which is a complete account of all which is
known on the subject.

As regards truthfulness or authenticity, I must observe that the persons
from whom these items were obtained were in every instance far too
illiterate to comprehend my real object in collecting. They were
ignorant of everything classical to a degree which is supposed to be
quite unusual in Italy. I have read many times lists of the names of
Roman deities without having one recognised, till all at once I would be
called on to stop--generally at an Etruscan name--there would be a
minute's reflection, and then the result given. It was the same with
regard to accounts of superstitions, tales, or other lore--they were
very often not recognised at all, or else they would be recalled with
very material alterations. Had there been deceit in the case, there
would have been of course a prompt "yes" to everything. But in most
cases my informants gave me no answer at the time, but went to consult
with other witches, or delayed to write to friends in La Romagna. Thus
it often happened that I was from weeks to years in collecting certain
items. The real pioneer in folk-lore like this, has always a most
ungrateful task. He has to overcome difficulties of which few readers
have any conception, and must struggle with the imperfect language,
memories, and intelligences of ignorant old people who have
half-forgotten traditions, or of more ignorant younger ones who have
only half learned them. Now I have been, as regards all this, as exact
as circumstances permitted, and should any urge that *nìhil est, quod
cura et diligentia perfici haud possit*, I can only reply that in this
work I exhausted mine. And it is unfortunately true that in collecting
folk-lore, as in translation, the feeblest critic can pick out no end,
of errors as he will, or show how *he* could have bettered it, in
reviewing the very best books on the subject--which is one great cause
in this our day why many of the best books are never written. For truly
there is not much money to be made thereby, and if discredit be added
thereunto, one can only say as the Scotch "meenister" did to his wife:
"If ye have nae fortune, and nae *grace*, God knows I have got but a
sair bairgain in ye."

It should be observed that *all* these superstitions, observances,
legends, names, and attributes of spirits are at present *far* from
being generally known. Much of the lore was originally confined to the
*strege*, or witches--who are few and far between--as constituting
secrets of their unlawful profession. Again, of late, the younger
generation have ceased to take any interest in such matters, and as
regards the names of certain spirits., it is with difficulty that a few
old people, or even one here and there, can be found who remember them.
Mindful of this, I took great

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

pains to verify by every means in my power the authenticity of what I
have given, especially the names and attributes of spirits or gods. My
most intelligent collector did her best to aid by referring to more than
one *vecchia*, or old woman. An intelligent young *contadino* was
specially employed at this work. He went on market days when the
peasantry came down in numbers from the mountains, and asked the old
women and men from different places, if they knew this or that spirit.
He was eminently successful in verifying nearly all the names which I
have here given. But he declared that he found it very difficult as
regarded some of them, firstly, because only a very few old people knew
the names which I was *specially* desirous of confirming, such as those
of Tinia, Faflon, and Téramó, and that, secondly, these people were very
averse to communicating what they knew, because such subjects are
*scongiurati*, or prohibited by the priests. Adhering closely to the
letters of his instructions, he however not only obtained the
verifications, but induced a number of old peasants to write
certificates, or *fogliettini*, as to what they had affirmed. These,
written on strips of writing-paper of different colours, have a curious
effect, looking something like testimonials of character of the ancient
deities, as if the latter were seeking situations or charity. The
following are specimens of these documents:--

"The Lasii are spirits of our ancestors, and are known at Santa Sofia.

"AUGUSTO FIERRARI.

"*March*, 1891."

"Fafflond (*Faflon*) or Fardel is the spirit of wine. He is known at
Politeo (*i.e.*, Portico).

"OTTAVIO MAGRINI."

"Tigna, the great spirit of lightning, has been generally known here in
Dovadola from ancient times.

"V. DEL' VIVO."

"Teramo is the spirit of merchants, thieves and messengers. He is known
at San Benedetto, where the deeds of this spirit have been related for
many years.

"TITO FORCONI.

"*March*, 1891."

Enrico Rossi testifies of *Mania della Notte*--the nightmare--that, "She
was remembered once by many, but now it is a long time since any one at
Galeata has spoken of her." I have more of these certificates; suffice
it to say that the youth, aided by his father and friends, succeeded in
abundantly verifying all the names, save three or four. I should say,
however, that these agents were exceptionally well qualified for the
task, there being a very wise woman--in fact two--in the family. In some
few cases they varied the orthography of the names. Thus "Peppino"
declares in a letter that the correct name of Faflon is *Faflo*, and
that the *Lasii* are *Ilasie*. What I would say is that I took all the
pains in my power to verify the truth as to the actual existence of the
names and

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

attributes of these spirits, as well as of the other subjects of
folk-lore given in this work.

There is another difficulty or contradiction to be noted. Many
superstitions and observances are recorded as if they were still in
familiar current use, or well known, which are in reality almost
forgotten; while others again are tolerably familiar to the multitude. I
have often spoken of things as living which are rapidly becoming
obsolete because my informants did so, after the fashion of old
people--*ut est à nobis pauloantè commemoratum*. I have been told that
these stories and rites are perishing very rapidly, that twenty years
ago an incredibly vast and curious collection of them could have been
made, and that ten years hence it will probably be impossible to find
the names of the old deities, or more than a mere fragment of what I
have preserved, and that a great deal has perished or vanished from
among the people even since I first began to collect it. For all of this
I crave due allowance. I have also to request it for what may strike
some readers as a defect. A great deal of this folk-lore came from
persons who had learned it long ago, and who, consciously or
unconsciously, had often only a dim recollection of a song or
incantation, and so, voluntarily or involuntarily, repeated it, perhaps
imperfectly, just as it would have been done among the *contadini*, who
are by no means accurate in such matters, and yet are endowed with a
great gift for improvising, That the *motive* or tradition existed in
every case, and that its sense is preserved, I am sure. I simply urge
that I have collected and published *as well as I could*, doing my best
to select from a terribly mixed and confused mass of material, and that
I can do no more. Further sifting must be done by those better qualified
than I am.

What will seem strange to many readers is that so many of the
incantations and other portions of narrative which I have given in
measure or rhyme, are in the original quite devoid of both, and seem to
be mere prose. I call special attention to this, because it has been to
me a special difficulty. What I have heard sung to airs, so that it
sounded melodiously, I have rendered in something like poetic form what
is called *cantare alla contadinesca* ("singing country fashion") means
to sing prose in a peculiar kind of chant. To illustrate this I may
mention that there is one very popular little song:--

Ma guerda la Rusena  
A fazeda a la finestra,"

which has not either in Romagnolo nor in Italian a trace of rhyme or
rhythm, and which, as it was given to me in writing, seemed much more
prosaic than are the majority of the incantations, or poems, in this
work.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

I am indebted to Senator COMPARETTI, of Florence, for pointing out to me
the fact that this would strike many readers as a fault, and I have
therefore devoted to it a special explanation. But I also owe to his
extensive knowledge the remark that it is not less true that in many
countries, as for instance the Slavonian, we see popular incantations
now passing rapidly from poetry into mere prose. For this is the first
stage of decay, and it is natural enough that those who have acquired
folk-lore in this uncertain, half-changed, shifting form should give it
again imperfectly. When the next generation comes it will be altogether
lost, and then perhaps antiquaries would be thankful for such books,
even if they were as full of defects as this of mine. Of which it may be
observed that those who insist that all which is collected and published
shall be absolutely and unquestionably *faultless* as regards *every*
detail, while they certainly secure for themselves the gold all smelted
and certified for them to manufacture or coin, exclude from commerce all
ore or alloyed metal from which more skilful metallurgists may extract
even greater values. I do not by saying this offer an apology for
*carelessness*, or worse, but a hint that by exacting too much we may
lose a great deal, as did the ancient Greeks who threw away as refuse
from the mines of Laurium a vast amount of precious metal which modern
science has turned to great profit.

But I have what I think is a good reason for giving translations of so
many incantations and songs in measure and rhyme. There is a remark by
Heine to the effect that many people think that when they have caught a
butterfly, put a pin through it, and preserved it with some chemical,
that they really have a perfect specimen; and it is in this spirit that
many study folk-lore. But that is not a butterfly at all. For to such a
"flying flower," as the Chinese call it, there belongs the exquisite
fluttering in sunshine, the living grace of its moving wings, and lines
of flight-curves within curves, as in a living arabesque of motion--from
shade to sunlight among summer flowers." One of these *contadina* songs,
as sung with melody and expression, is a living butterfly, but when
written down--with a pen through it--it has lost its life. And as rhyme
and measure to a degree restore this, I have thought that by giving
these songs such form I have come somewhat nearer to the spirit of the
originals. I could also have given in every instance the
Romagnolo-Bolognese, but this my limits positively forbid. Many, perhaps
most, of my readers will understand Italian, but very few Romagnolo or
Bolognese. As regards the very bad quality of the Italian, every reader
will understand that I have given it with very little correction.

I will not, however, be understood as going to the very extreme limits
of humility and apology as regards these poems. A great many are in
themselves

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

strikingly beautiful, original, and imbued with a classic and often
delicately appropriate spirit--as in those to Pan and Faflon--and the
women from whom they were derived could absolutely have no more invented
them than they could have invented the flying-machine of the future or
settled "the great national Italian problem" of flaying peasants without
hurting them, or eating a cake and having it. This is simply true, and
as not a line or letter of them came ever so indirectly from me, the
question is simply, how could women, so illiterate as to hardly
understand what they repeated, have invented it all--much more, how
could they have woven into them, as is done in most cases, the most
classical and appropriate allusions, characteristics, and colour? Of all
of which I can truly say, that if my informants really manufactured
these incantations, the interest and value of my book is thereby
augmented a hundredfold, as being the most remarkable *piéce de
manufacture* ever presented to the public.

What will strike many readers as strange is that there should have
existed to the present day--though it is now rapidly disappearing--in a
Roman Catholic country, an ancient heathen religion of sorcery, from
earliest Tuscan times. That such a survival under such a *stratum* is
not without parallel, I have shown by an incident, which is thus
described in my *Gypsy Sorcery*:--

"It has been discovered of late years in India, that during thousands of
years of Brahminic, Buddhistic and Mahometan rule, there always existed
among the people a rude Shamanism, or worship of spirits and stones,
eked out with coarse sorcery, which formed a distinct religion by
itself, and which came to light as soon as British government removed
religious oppression. This religion consisted of placing small rocks
after the fashion of Stonehenge and other 'Druidic' monuments, and in
other rites of the most primitive kind. And it is very evident that the
oldest religions everywhere are founded on such a faith."

But I was much more astonished to find that in Tuscany, the most
enlightened portion of Italy, under all Roman rule an old pagan faith,
or something like it, has existed to a most extraordinary degree. For it
is really not a mere chance survival of superstitions here and there, as
in England or France, but a complete system, as this work will
abundantly prove. A few years ago Count ANGELO DE GUBERNATIS informed
Mr. GLADSTONE, in conversation, that there was actually among the Tuscan
peasantry ten times as much heathenism as Catholicism. I repeated this
remark to a woman whom I employed to collect folk-lore, and her reply
was: "Certainly, there is ten times more faith in *la vecchia
religione*" ("the old religion"). "For the peasants have recourse to the
priests and the saints on great occasions, but they use magic all the
time for everything."

At another time when I expressed my astonishment that a certain girl who
had grown up in the country was utterly ignorant of the name of a single
spirit,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

and could recall nothing relating to witchcraft, she became scornful,
and then excited, exclaiming:--

"And how should such a stupid fool, who is afraid of the priests and
saints, know anything? I call myself a Catholic--oh, yes--and I wear a
medal to prove it"--here she, in excitement, pulled from her bosom a
saint's medal--"but I believe in none of it all. You know what I
believe."

"S*i; la vecchia religione*" ("the old faith"), I answered, by which
faith I meant that strange, diluted old Etrusco-Roman sorcery which is
set forth in this book. Magic was her real religion.

Much of this magic is mixed up with Catholic rites and saints, but these
in their turn were very often of heathen origin. Some saints such as
Antony, Simeon, and Elisha, appear as absolutely sorcerers or goblins,
and are addressed with ancient heathen ceremonies in cellars with
magical incantations. The belief in *folletti*, a generic term for
goblins, and other familiar spirits, has not sunk as yet to the
"fairy-tale" level of beings only mentioned for entertainment--as in
Grimm's Tales--they enter into popular belief as a part of the religion,
and are invoked in good faith. There is actually in Tuscany a culture or
worship of fetishes which are not Catholic, *i.e.*, of strange stones
and many curious relics.

But there is, withal, as I have remarked, a great deal of mystery and
secrecy observed in all this cult. It has its professors: men, but
mostly women, who collect charms and spells, and teach them to one
another, and hold meetings; that is, there is a kind of college of
witches and wizards, which, for many good reasons, eludes observation.
It was my chance to become acquainted in Florence with the
fortune-teller referred to, who was initiated in these secrets, and
whose memory was stocked to an extraordinary and exceptional degree with
not only magical formulas but songs and tales. Such familiarity with
folk-lore and sorcery as I possess, resulted in confidence--the end
being that I succeeded in penetrating this obscure and strange forest
inhabited by witches and shadows, faded gods and forgotten goblins of
the olden time, where folk-lore of every kind abounded to such excess
that, as this book shows, I in time had more thereof than I could
publish. To do this I went to strange places and made strange
acquaintance, so that if the reader will kindly imagine something much
out of common life, and often wild and really *weird*--*i.e.*,
prophetic--when fortune-telling was on the cards, as the dramatic
accompaniment of every charm and legend in this book, he will but do it
justice. To collect volumes of folk-lore among very reticent Red
Indians, and reserved Romanys is not unknown to me, but the extracting
witchcraft from Italian *strege* far surpasses it. "I too was among the
shadows."

There are many people, even Italians, who will say, "It is very
remarkable

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

that we never heard of any association of witches nor met with any of
all this mythology or lore--we who know the people so well." just the
same might have been said of almost every respectable white native of
Philadelphia when I was there a few years ago, as to the Voodoo
sorcerers, who, silent and unseen, conjured and worked in darkness among
the coloured people of that city. What did any of us know about even our
own black servants in their homes? And the class which corresponds to
the Voodoo acts in Tuscany, in opposition--unlike the American--to a
powerful national religion which till of late ruled by the strong hand,
and it fears everybody.

The extraordinary tenacity and earnestness with which the peasant
Tuscans have clung to these fragments of their old faith is quite in
accordance with their ancient character. Livy said of them they were "a
race which excelled all in devotion to religious rites and in the art of
cultivating them" (v. I. 6). But as KARL OTTFRIED MÜLLER remarks in *Die
Etrusker*--a work which has been of great use to me--"while the Greeks
expressed their religious feelings with boldness in varied forms . . .
the Tusker (Tuscans) blended them in the most intimate manner with every
domestic practical interest. Tuscan divination was consequently the most
characteristic trait of the nation and the *Hauptpunkt*, or beginning of
their intellectual action and education." And this spirit still
survives. Among all the wars and convulsions of Italy the peasants of
Tuscany have remained *the same race*. Englishmen and Frenchmen are the
result of modern mixtures of peoples, but the Italians, like HAWTHORNE'S
Marble Faun, are absolutely ancient, if not prehistoric. There are
families in Italy who find their family names in Etrurian monuments on
their estates. And CICERO, TACITUS, LIVY, VIRGIL, and many more, testify
that all their divination and religious observances were drawn from and
based on Etruscan authority. "This," says MÜLLER, "was shared *by the
common people*. There were in Italy schools, like those of the Jewish
prophets and Gallic Druids, in which the system was thoroughly taught."
And there is the last relic of these still existing among the Tuscan "
witches." In later times the Chaldæan sorcerers took the upper hand in
Rome with their astrology, but the Etruscan *augures* were still
authorities, so late as the fifth century, A.D., since they were
consulted at the birth of CLAUDIUS. In 4o8, they protected Narnia by
invoking lightning against the Goths (MÜLLER).

The Etruscan books of magic were common among the Romans. In Cicero's
time (*Cic. de Div.* i. 33), there were many of them. I have been
assured that there is in existence a manuscript collection of charms and
spells such as are now in use--in fact it was promised me as a gift, but
I have not succeeded in obtaining it. I have, however, a large MS. of
this kind which was written for me from collection

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

and memory, which I have used in writing this book. It is true that all
I have is only the last sparks, or dead ashes, and coals of the ancient
fire, but it is worth something.

I have freely illustrated my collection with instances drawn from
reading, and have added to it certain tales, or stories, which have very
curious connections with classic lore and superstitions. There are also
a few records of certain plants, showing how the belief that many herbs
and flowers have an indwelling fairy, and are in fact fairies
themselves, still survives, with a degree of *personification* which has
long since disappeared in most other European countries. There has been
much collection of plant-lore of late years by many writers, but I am
not aware that any one has observed this faith *in the plant itself* as
a creature with a soul.

There is the same superstition as regards minerals, the reason being
very curious. For there are in the earth deep mysteries; the earth-worm
and mole are full of them because *the foot of the sorcerer* passes over
them, and gives power, the *salagrana*, or stalagmite, and different
metallic ores arc really holy, from being subterranean, and yet
sparkling with hidden occult light when broken they meet the sun; and
plants which send their roots deep down into the earth draw from it
mystic force which takes varied magic forms according to their nature
when brought up into light and air. Owing to the inability of my
informant to express herself clearly, I had difficulty for a long time
in understanding this properly chthonic theory; when I did master it, I
was struck by its Paracelsian character--this belief in a "geomantic
force" which Chinese recognise as *Feugshui*.

Should the reader be astonished at the number of incantations which
occur in this work, I would remind him that among the peasantry in
Italy, but especially in the Tuscan Romagna there is, or has been, till
of late years, some formula of the kind uttered for almost every
conceivable event in life. And this is perhaps a proof of their
antiquity. PRELLER, in his Roman Mythology, speaks as follows on this
subject:--

"The belief in a *fate* in every form conceivable, such as Fortuna, the
goddess of destiny, oracles, and all varieties of divination, was always
very active in Italy, especially in divine omens, warnings, forebodings
which developed themselves in the most varied phases and kinds, and it
resulted in Rome in such a mass of marvels and superstitions running
into every possible shape, as never was heard of in such a high stage of
civilisation."

For every one of these fancies there was an incantation: if salt upset
they said, "*Dii avertite omen!*" But the great source of it all was
Etruria, from which the Romans derived the laws of their religion--that
is to say, a divination which had a spell for almost everything which
the heart of man could conceive. And it was from Etrurian Tuscany that I
took these spells, which, by comparison with those which remain from
Roman times, *all* bear unmistakable marks of antiquity.

1 would also observe that though I have spoken of these sorceries and
superstitions as passing away rapidly, they are very far from having
disappeared. While I was writing the foregoing, that is to say, on the
second day of March, 1891, there was going on in Milan one of the most
serious outbursts of a mob which had occurred for years. It being
believed that a child had been bewitched by a certain woman, the
populace in wrath pursued the sorceress with much abuse into a church.
The details of this outrage, which occupy a column in the *Secolo* of
April 3 and 4, 1891, will be given in the following pages. Milan, be it
remembered, is "far away" the least superstitious city in Italy, and
much in advance of Florence as regards such matters, while Florence is
as light to darkness compared to the Romagna.

Since the manuscript of this work was put in my publisher's hands
something has occurred which should properly have found an earlier place
in this Preface. It is this: Some years ago I published a work on the
Algonkin Legends of New England. Within a few months a contributor to
the English *Folk-Lore Journal* has made a remark to the effect that he
had always doubted the authenticity of these Legends, while another has
said in *The American Folk-Lore Journal* that Mr. Leland is throughout
inaccurate when reporting what Indians had told him. This last writer
had gone to the same tribe, though probably to other Indians, and taken
down with a *phonograph*, in the original Indian tongue, the same tales.
His contribution consists in a measure of comments on my stories, which
do not suffer in the least by his subsequent collection.

When I began to collect those Indian legends, all that I knew of them
was that a Catholic missionary, who had lived many years among the
Penobscot or Passamaquoddy tribes, had succeeded in getting only one
story, so reticent were the Indians towards white men regarding their
myths. During an entire summer I was very intimate and confidential with
a very intelligent Abenaki, or Saint Francis, Indian, who, as he spoke
and wrote well both French and English, might be supposed to have been
superior to vulgar prejudice. I endeavoured constantly--sometimes by
artful wiles or chance remarks--to draw from him something like a
legend, but he constantly declared that he did not know one, or anything
relating to old beliefs, and that all had long since perished. There was
also a jolly old Indian woman, one of the same tribe, who told fortunes
by cards, and she sang the same song. A year after I succeeded better
with Tomah or Tomaquah, a Passamaquoddy, who not only related to and
collected for me a vast number of remarkable legends, myths, and
folk-lore items of all kinds, but who told me that my two Abenaki
friends were noted repositories or living chronicles Of such learning.
As for the authenticity of the legends, there is hardly one

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

which has not its close parallel, in some particulars at least, in the
MS. folio of Mic Mac legends, collected by Rev. S. Rand, or among the
cognate Chippeway records of Schoolcraft and Kohl. As for accuracy, the
pioneer who first makes his way into such a jungle, or cane-brake, has
enough to do to keep the twigs out of his eyes and clear away the brush,
without thinking of leaving a macadamised road for his followers.

After I had made a beginning, the Indians, finding that one or another
had let out a cat, or told a legend, and also that the telling thereof
was productive of dollars and tobacco and pounds of tea, did somewhat
abate their ancient reticence, and the path having been cleared, several
followers walked in it--among others the gentleman with the phonograph,
who, as is usual, grumbled at the road. It was easy enough to collect
stories *then*, and to detect inaccuracies in the first reported.

But the difficulties which I had in collecting Red Indian legends were
but an inch of pin-wire compared to a crowbar with what I had to
encounter in gathering these Italian relics. Very recently, as I write,
I told my chief authority that I expected to publish all these accounts
of spirits, tales, and conjurations in a book, and that if there was
aught in it *not perfectly authentic* that I should incur *un gran'
disgrazia*. To which she with some excitement replied:--

"Signore, you know very well how difficult it has been for you to gather
all this. I do not believe that any other signore in Italy could collect
it among the people. For all the strange things of antiquity which you
seek are mostly known only in a very few families, or to some old people
or witches who are mortally afraid of the priests, and who are very
timid, and conceal everything from their betters. And then there is the
much greater number of those who really believe that when a learned man
asks them for such things that he himself is a *stregone*, or
wizard--oh, the people are *very* superstitious and fearful as to
*that*! And you must remember that, as regards what I have told you, I
have had to go about among old people, and question many, and have been
often seeking for weeks and months before I could answer many of your
questions."

To which she might have added that much was only half-recollected or
jumbled up, or, worse than all, restored by lively Italian minds gifted
with the fatal gift of improvisation, as, for instance, when a sorceress
retains only the idea or general features of an incantation, but
proceeds to utter it boldly, believing that it is "about the thing." And
bearing in mind what has been said in reputable journals of my work on
Algonkin Legends, every fraction of which was honestly given from good
authorities, every one of which I named, I would here declare that I
received everything in this book from Italians who declared that all had

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

been derived from tradition, and that where it was possible--which was
often not the case--I verified this as well as I could. But as regards
possible imposture, or error, or lies, or mistakes, I hold myself
responsible for nothing whatever, limiting everything to this simple
fact--that I very accurately recorded what was told me by others. I
believe that the names of the old Etruscan gods, as I have given them,
still exist, because "Peppino" actually, with much trouble, verified
them from the memories of old people, and if he, a *contadino*, and one
of themselves, had to complain that he elicited this information with
great trouble, because it was forbidden knowledge, and "accursed by the
priests," it may be inferred how hard it would be for a superior to
obtain it. As for the incantations, or aught else--bearing in mind the
criticisms which I have received--I utterly disclaim all responsibility,
and wash my hands clear of the whole concern, saving and except this,
that I myself believe-unconscious errors excepted--that it is all
honest, earnest, and true. In the main I propose it as a guide to be
followed by other and more learned or better qualified scholars and
seekers, who may correct its errors, only begging them to do so in civil
language, and not accuse me directly or indirectly of recklessness or
untruthfulness or carelessness.

And a nice time they will have of it if they walk the ways which I have
walked, in the paths which I have trod. I have just heard that one old
woman who is several times cited as authority in this book has died in a
den of infamy, and that on the day of her decease <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) her son, who had been doing three years for
a murder, "in the heat of passion," left prison. There has always been a
dread sense of the existence of a Prefect and the police hovering like a
dark shadow over me while pursuing my researches among my Etruscan
friends; to them, unfortunately, these powers that be occasionally
assumed a far more tangible form, and even the best and most respectable
among them was once cited before the former, only escaping durance vile
by a fine, which is recorded in my diary as "Expenses in collecting
Folk-Lore." *Feliciter evasit*--and to this escape the recovery of three
lost Etruscan gods is truly due! There are records of several great
works written in consequence of their authors having been in
prison--this portion of my book is; I

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

believe the only literary labour described which was due to the author's
keeping out of the penitentiary, which--it must be candidly admitted--is
a much cleverer and far more difficult feat.

That there are a few docent Italians who know something of this
witch-lore is proved, for instance, by the shoemaker to whom I owe the
legends of Ra and Bovo. But the sorceries, and all relating to them, are
chiefly in the hands of "witches," who tell fortunes and prepare spells
and charms, and who, far from being desirous of fame, or "greedy for
glory as authority," rather shrink from celebrity, albeit from no marked
sense of modest merit, but rather from a vivid sense of justice--that
is, of the manner in which it may be meted out unto them. Therefore I,
in this book, have made no great parade of my authorities. Something of
this may be due to the fact that, as chief of the English gypsies--or at
least as President of the English Gypsy-Lore Society, which amounts to
the same thing--I have a natural proclivity for ways that are dark and
low society, *et cetera*;--it may be so, the spell was wrought by other
hands than mine--but so far as I know, this manner of Folk-Lore cometh
not from going among a poor but virtuous peasantry, or by collecting
penny broadsides, or walking in the paths of grace according to the
handbooks of criticism.

I bring you not the metal, but rude ore  
I gathered as I knew--what would you more?

Now, to meet all queries from critics, I declare distinctly that, as
regards all authenticity, I am one with the man of the tale told by
Panurge in the Chronicles of Rabelais. This worthy, who was a beggar in
Paris, went about with two little girls in panniers, one hung before and
the other behind him. And he being asked if they were truly maids,
replied, "As for the one whom I carry in front, I am not sure, but I
incline to believe that she really is what you inquire; but as for the
one behind, of her I will assert nothing." So I declare that, as for the
names of the Etruscan gods which I have given in front, I believe they
are authentic, but do not swear to it; while as for all the rest, I
affirm nothing. If all the bishops in England had sworn to it, somebody
would have denied it; and those from whom I obtained it were not even
bishops' daughters, albeit they may have been those of priests.

For there has sprung up. of late years a decided tendency in critics to
*utterly* condemn books, no matter how valuable they may be, for small
faults or defects, just as a friend of mine treated all the vast mass of
learning and ingenious observation in the works of De Gubernatis as
worthless trash, because the Count has carried the Solar Myth too far.
To all such I can only say that they need

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

read no further in this work of mine, for it is not written for them,
nor by their standard, nor to suit their ideas. It is simply the setting
down of a quantity of strange lore as given by certain old women, living
or dead (among which latter I class divers deceased antiquaries)--and
further than this the deponent sayeth not.

The moral of all which is that if a work like the Algonkin Legends,
which is very accurate in all save, perhaps, in a few very trivial
details, and whose absolute truth is confirmed by a thunder-cloud of
witnesses, can be openly accused in the two leading Folk-Lore journals
of England and America of sinning in these respects, what may not be
alleged or said of this, which was compiled, collected, and corrected
under circumstances where I had, so to speak, to feel my way in the
lurid fog of a sorcerers' *sabbat*, in a bewildering, strangely scented
"witch-aura," misled ever and anon by goblins' mocking cries, the
tittering cheeping of bats on the wing, the hoots of owls--yea, and the
rocking of the earth itself--as the text abundantly witnesseth, seeing
how often I in it go blindly feeling my way from the corner of one
ruined conjecture to another, ever apprehending that I have found a
mare's-nest-or, more properly, that of a nightmare of the most evasive
kind? Now, as it is no light thing to be accused in high places before
the world of folly and falsehood, when the author has done his work with
very careful honesty, it may well be understood that as "the combusted
infant manifests apprehension of the igneous element," so I, knowing
very well that a crafty Italian is not in the same boat with an "honest
Injun," naturally take precautions against the captious critic by
admitting *all* possible imperfections. To which there will be others of
these noble souls to cry, "*Qui s'excuse, s'accuse*." Certainly there
will be, as ever.

Ah well, and let them cry it an they will!  
There never yet was castle built so fair,  
So strong, or deeply founded, but some thief  
Or petty spy did worm his way therein.

<span id="fn_0"></span>[15:1](err03.htm#fr_0.md) The manner of her death
was characteristic, as described to me by another. "She was all her life
a very wicked old woman, believing nothing, and she died in extreme sin
because she would hear nothing of priest or prayer; and what was more,
had all my *biancheria* (underclothing), which I had asked her to keep,
but which she would not return, and so I lost it utterly. Add the night
she died there was another old woman watching by her, and the other one
fell asleep. After a while she was awakened by something on her chest,
and thinking it was the little dog, grasped it and cast it from her, and
slept again. And it came again, and this time, still thinking it was the
old. woman's little dog, searched all the room closely for it, but found
nothing. And going to the bed she found that the old woman was dead. And
it was her soul which had awakened the one sleeping." "Did she die a
witch?" "*Sicuro*--certainly."
