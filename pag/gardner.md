# Books of Gerald Gardner

Gerald Gardner was the central figure in the Wiccan renaissance of the
1950s and 1960s. He wrote several key texts of modern Wicca, including
[the Gardnerian Book of Shadows](gbos/index.md).

For copyright reasons, Gardners' books cannot be posted on the Internet
for free distribution. However, they can be purchased through
Amazon.com:

-   [High Magic's
    Aid](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0963065785/internetsacredte.md)
    (1949). This is a novel which is set in Medieval England, based very
    closely on [Margaret Murray's](murray.md) works and the magical system
    described in [The Key of Solomon](../grim/kos/index.md). Gardner sold
    copies of this book at his Witchcraft Museum on the Isle of Man. The
    fictional setting was necessitated by the harsh laws against
    witchcraft which were still on the books as of 1949, and (reputedly)
    secrecy requirements placed on him by the traditionalist coven which
    he had joined. Although High Magic's Aid may not quite succeed as a
    historical novel, it is quite readble and is a significant document
    in the evolution of modern Wicca.
-   [Witchcraft
    Today](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0939708035/internetsacredte) (1951.md)
    and the [Meaning of
    Witchcraft](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0939708027/internetsacredte.md)
    (1959) (Note: these books are currently out of print, but should be
    obtainable on the used book market). These books are non-fictional,
    popularized recitations of Gardners' evolving views on Wicca. After
    the repeal of the witchcraft laws in England in 1951, Gardner
    finally convinced his traditionalist coven to allow him to publish
    some of the details of their previously secret beliefs and
    practices. Or so the story goes; in any case, these are transitional
    books in which Gardner is weaving together the various strands of
    modern Wicca. These books created a sensation and Gardner became
    what amounted to the first Wiccan media star.
