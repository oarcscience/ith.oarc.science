# CHAPTER III

GYPSY CONJURATIONS AND EXORCISMS—THE CURE OF CHILDREN-HUNGARIAN GYPSY
SPELLS—A CURIOUS OLD ITALIAN "SECRET"—THE MAGIC VIRTUE OF GARLIC—A
FLORENTINE INCANTATION LEARNED FROM A WITCH—LILITH, THE CHILD-STEALER,
AND QUEEN OF THE WITCHES

<span id="img_04101"></span> ![](img/04101.jpg)IN all the schools of
Shamanic sorcery, from those of the Assyrian Accadian to the
widely-spread varieties of the present day, the Exorcism forms the
principal element. An exorcism is a formula, the properties or power of
which is that when properly pronounced, especially if this be done with
certain fumigations and ceremonies, it will drive away devils, diseases,
and disasters of every description; nay, according to very high, and
that by no means too ancient, authority, it is efficacious in banishing
bugs, mice, or locusts, and it is equal to Persian powder as a *fuge*
for fleas, but is, unfortunately, too expensive to be used for that
purpose save by the very wealthy. It has been vigorously applied against
the grape disease, the Colorado beetle, the army worm, and the blizzard
in

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

the United States, but, I believe, without effect, owing possibly to
differences of climate or other antagonistic influences.

Closely allied to the Exorcism is the Benediction, which soon grew out
of it as a cure. The former being meant to repel and drive away evil,
the latter very naturally suggested itself, by a law of moral polarity,
as a means of attracting good fortune, blessings, health, and peace. As
the one was violently curative, the other was preventive. The
benediction would keep the devils and all their works away from a man or
his home—in fact, if stables be only well blessed once a year, no
mishaps can come to any of the animals who inhabit them; and I myself
have known a number of donkeys to receive a benediction in Rome, the
owner being assured that it would keep them safe from all the ills which
donkeys inherit. And in the year 1880, in one of the principal churches
of Philadelphia, blessed candles were sold to a congregation under
guarantee that the purchase of one would preserve its possessor for one
year against all disorders of the throat, on which occasion a sermon was
preached, in the which seven instances were given in which people had
thus been cured.

Between blessing and banning it soon became evident that many formulas
of words could be used to bring about mysterious results. It is probable
that the Exorcism in its original was simply the angry, elevated tone of
voice which animals as well as men instinctively employ to repel an
enemy or express a terror. For this *unusual* language would be chosen,
remembered, and repeated. With every new utterance this outcry or curse
would be more seriously pronounced or enlarged till it became an
Ernulphian formula. The next step would be to give it metric form, and
its probable development is very interesting. It does not seem to have
occurred to many investigators that in early ages all things whatever
which were remembered and repeated were droned and intoned, or
*sing-sung*, until they fell of themselves into a kind of metre. In all
schools at the present day, where boys are required to repeat aloud and
all together the most prosaic lessons, they end by chanting them in rude
rhythm. All monotone, be it that of a running brook, falls into cadence
and metre. All of the sagas, or legends,

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

of the Algonkin-Wabanaki were till within even fifty years chants or
songs, and if they are now rapidly losing that character it is because
they are no longer recited with the interest and accuracy which was once
observed in the narrators. But it was simply because all things often
repeated were thus intoned that the exorcisms became metrical. It is
remarkable that among the Aryan races it assumed what is called the
staff-rhyme, like that which SHAKESPEARE, and BEN JONSON, and BYRON, and
many more employ, as it would seem, instinctively, whenever witches
speak or spells or charms are uttered. It will not escape the reader
that, in the Hungarian gypsy incantations in this work, the same measure
is used as that which occurs in the Norse sagas, or in the scenes of
Macbeth. It is also common in Italy. This is intelligible—that its
short, bold, deeply-marked movement has in itself something mysterious
and terrible. If that wofully-abused word "weird" has any real
application to anything, it is to the staff-rhyme. I believe that when a
man, and particularly a woman, does not know what else to say, he or she
writes "lurid," or "weird," and I lately met with a book of travels in
which I found the latter applied seventy-six times to all kinds of
conundrums, until I concluded that, like the coachman's definition of an
idea in HEINE'S "Reisebilder," it meant simply "any d——d nonsense that a
man gets into his head." But if *weird* really and only means that which
is connected with fate or destiny, from the Anglo-Saxon *Weordan*, to
become, German, *Werden*, then it is applicable enough to rhymes setting
forth the future and spoken by the "weird sisters," who are so-called
*not* because they are awful or nightmarish, or pokerish, or mystical,
or bug-a-boorish, but simply because they predict the future or destiny
of men." The Athenians as well as Gentiles excelled in these songs of
sorcery, hence we are told (VARRO, "Q. de Fascin") that in Achaia, when
they learned that a certain woman who used them was an Athenian they
stoned her to death, declaring that the immortal gods bestowed on man
the power of healing with stones, herbs, and animals, not with words"
("De Rem. Superstit. Cognoscendis"). Truly, doctors never agree.

It was in 1886 that I learned from a girl in Florence two exorcisms or

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

invocations which she was accustomed to repeat before telling fortunes
by cards. This girl, who was of the Tuscan Romagna and who looked
Etruscan with a touch of gypsy blood, was a repertory of popular
superstitions, especially witch-lore, and a maker and wearer of
fetishes, always carrying a small bag full of them. *Bon sang ne peut
mentir*.

The two formulas were as follows. I omit a portion from each

"Venti cinque carte siete!  
Venti cinque diavoli diventerete,  
Diventerete, anderete  
Nel' corpo, nel' sangue nell' anima,  
Nell' sentimenti del corpo;  
Del mio amante non posso vivere,  
Non passa stare ne bere,  
Ne mangiare ne . . .  
Ne con uomini ne con donne non passa favellare,  
Finche a la porta di casa mia  
Non viene picchiare!"

"Ye are twenty-five cards.  
Become twenty-five devils  
Enter into the body, into the blood, into the soul .  
Into the feelings of the body  
Of my lover, from whom I cannot live.  
For I cannot stand (exist), or drink,  
Or eat . . .  
Nor can I converse with men or women  
Till at the door of my house  
He shall come to knock."

The second incantation was the same, but beginning with these words:—

"I put five fingers on the wall,  
I conjure five devils,  
Five monks and five friars,  
That they may enter the body  
Into the blood, into the soul," &c.

If the reader will take Le Normant's "Magie Chaldaienne," and

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

carefully compare these Italian spells with those of ancient Nineveh, he
will not only find a close general resemblance, but all the several
details or actual identity of words. And it is not a little curious that
the same formulas which were repeated—

"Once on a time when Babylon was young"—

should still be current in Italy. So it passed through the ages—races
came and went—and among the people the old sorcery was handed across and
adown, so that it still lives. But in a few years more the Folk-lorist
will be its only repository.

This chapter is devoted to conjuring diseases of children by gypsies. It
bears a great likeness to one in the very devout work of PETER PIPERNUS,
"De Pueris affectis morbis magicis" ("Of Boys who have been Bewitched
into Disease"), only that PIPERNUS uses Catholic incantations, which he
also employs "pro ligatis in matrimonio," "pro incubo magico," "de
dolóribus stomachi magicis," &c., for to him, as he declares, all
disease is of magic origin.

The magic of the gypsies is not all deceit, though they deceive with it.
They put faith themselves in their incantations, and practise them on
their own account. "And they believe that there are women, and sometimes
men, who possess supernatural power, partly inherited and partly
acquired." The last of seven daughters born in succession, without a
boy's coming into the series, is wonderfully gifted, for she can see
hidden treasure or spirits, or enjoy second sight of many things
invisible to men. And the same holds good for the ninth in a series of
boys, who may become a seer of the same sort. Such a girl, *i.e.*, a
seventh daughter, being a fortune in herself, never lacks lovers. In
1883 the young Vojvode, or leader, of the Kukaya gypsy tribe, named
DANKU NICULAI, offered the old gypsy woman, PALE BOSHE, one hundred
ducats if she would persuade her seventh daughter to marry him. In the
United States of America there are many women who advertise in the
newspapers that they also are seventh daughters

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

of seventh daughters at that, and who make a good thing of it as
fortunetellers; but they have a far more speedy, economical, and
effective way of becoming the last note in an octave, than by awaiting
the slow processes of being begotten or born, inasmuch as they boldly
declare themselves to be sevenths, which I am assured answers every
purpose, as nobody ever asks to see their certificates of baptism any
more than of marriage. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

Most of these witch-wives—also known in Hungary as *cohalyi*, or "wise
women," or *gule romni*, "sweet" or "charming women"—are trained up from
infancy by their mothers in medicine and magic. A great part of this
education consists in getting by heart the incantations or formulas of
which specimens will be given anon, and which, in common with their
fairy tales, show intrinsic evidence of having been drawn at no very
distant period from India, and probably in common with the lower or
Shamanic religion of India from Turanian sources. But there is among the
Hungarian gypsies a class of female magicians who stand far above their
sisters of the hidden spell in power. These are the *lace romni*, or
"good women," who draw their power directly from the *Nivasi* or
*Pchuvusi*, the spirits of water and earth, or of flood and fell. For
the Hungarian gypsies have a beautiful mythology of their own which at
first sight would seem to be a composition of the Rosicrucian as set
forth by Paracelsus and the Comte de GABALIS, with the exquisite
Indo-Teutonic fairy tales of the Middle Ages. In fact, in some of the
incantations used we find the *Urme*, or fairies, directly appealed to
for help.

With the gypsies, as among the early Accadians, diseases are supposed to
be caused by evil supernatural influences. This is more naturally the
case among people who lead very simple lives, and with whom sickness is

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

not almost a natural or normal condition, as it is with ladies and
gentlemen, or the inhabitants of cities, who have "always something the
matter with them." Nomadic life is conducive to longevity. "Our
grandfathers died on the gallows—we die from losing our teeth," said an
old gypsy to Doctor von WLISLOCKI, when asked what his age was.
Therefore among all people who use charms and spells those which are
devoted to cure occupy the principal position. However, the Hungarian
Romany have many medicines, more or less mysterious, which they also
apply in connection with the "healing rhymes." And as in the struggle
for life the weakest go first to the wall, the remedies for the diseases
of children are predominant.

When a mother begins to suffer the pangs of childbirth, a fire is made
before her tent, which is kept up till the infant is baptized, in order
to drive away evil spirits. Certain women feed this fire, and while
fanning it (fans being used for bellows) murmur the following rhyme:—

"Oh yakh, oh yakh pçabuva,  
                     Pçabuva,  
Te čavéstár tu trada,  
                      Tu trada,  
Pçávushen te Nivashen  
Tire tçuva the traden!  
Lače Urmen ávená,  
Čaves báçtáles dena,  
Káthe hin yov báçtáles,  
Andre lime báçtáles!  
Motura te ráná,  
Te átunci but' ráná,  
Matura te ráná,  
Te átunci, but' rana,  
Me dav' andre yákherá!  
Oh yákh, oh yákh pçabuva,  
Rovel čavo: áshuna!"

It may here be remarked that the pronunciation of all these words is the
same as in German, with the following additions . Č = *teh* in English,
or to *ch* in church. C = *ch* in German as in *Buch*. J = *azs*, or the
English

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

*j*, in James; *ñ*, as in Spanish, or *nj* in German, while *sh* and *y*
are pronounced as in English. Á is like *ah*. The literal translation is

"Oh Fire, oh Fire, burn!  
                    Burn!  
And from the child (do) thou drive away  
                    Drive away!  
Pçuvuse and Nivashi  
And drive away thy smoke (pl.)  
(Let) good fairies come (and)  
Give luck to the child,  
Here it is lucky (or fortunate)  
In the world fortunate  
Brooms and twigs (fuel)  
Arid then more twigs,  
And then yet more twigs  
I put (give) to the fire.  
Oh fire, oh fire—burn!  
The child weeps: listen!"

In South Hungary the gypsy women on similar occasions sing the following
charm:—

"Eitrá Pçuvushá, efta Niváshá  
André mal avená  
Pçabuven, pçabuven, oh yákhá!  
Dáyákri punro dindálen,  
Te gule čaves mudáren  
Pçabuven, pçabuven, oh yákhá;  
Ferinen o čaves te daya!"

"Seven Pçuvushe, seven Nivasi  
Come into the field,  
Burn, burn, oh fire  
They bite the mother's foot,  
They destroy the sweet child;  
Fire, fire, oh burn!  
Protect the child and the mother!"

When the birth is very difficult, the mother's relations come to help,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

and one of them lets an egg fall, *zwischen den Beinen derselben*. On
this occasion the gypsy women in Southern Hungary sing:—

"Anro, ánro in obles,  
Te e pera in obles:  
Ava čavo sástávestes!  
Devlá, devlá, tut akharel!"

The egg, the egg is round,  
And the belly is round,  
Come child in good health  
God, God calls thee!"

If a woman dies in child-bed two eggs are placed under her arms and the
following couplet is muttered:—

"Kana anro kirnes hin,  
Kathe nañi tçudá him!"

"When this egg is (shall be) decayed,  
Here (will be) is no milk!"

When the after-pains begin it is the custom with some of the gypsy
tribes in the Siebenburgen to smoke the sufferer with decayed
willow-wood which is burned for the purpose while the women in
attendance sing:—

"Sik te sik o tçu urál,  
Te urál o čon urál!  
Kana len hádjináven  
Sasčipená tut' áven;  
Káná o tçu ná urál—  
Tute nañi the dukhal,  
Tute náñi the dukhál."

"Fast and fast the smoke flies,  
And flies, the moon flies,  
When they find (themselves)  
Health (yet) will come to thee,  
When the smoke no (longer) flies  
Thou wilt feel pain no more!"

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

There is a strange, mysterious affinity between gypsies and the moon. A
wonderful legend, which they certainly brought from India since in it
Mekran is mentioned as the place where its incident occurred, details
that there, owing to the misrepresentations of a sorcerer, the gypsy
leader, CHEN, was made to, marry his sister GUIN, or KAN, which brought
the curse of wandering upon his people. Hence the Romany are called
Chen-Guin. It is very evident that here we have CHON and KAN, or KAM,
the Moon and Sun, which is confirmed by another gypsy legend which
declares that the Sun, because he once violated or still seeks to seduce
his sister, the Moon, continually follows her, being destined to wander
for ever. And as the name Chen-Kan, or Zingan, or Zigeuner, is known all
over the East, and, as this legend shows, is of Indian origin, it is
hardly worth while to believe with MIKLOSICH that it is derived from an
obscure Greek heretical sect of Christians—the more so as it is most
difficult to believe that the Romany were originally either Greeks or
Christians or Christian heretics.

When a gypsy woman is with child she will not, if she can help it, leave
her tent by full moonshine. A child born at this time it I's believed
will make a happy marriage. So it is said of birth in the Western
World:—

"Full moon, high sea,  
Great man thou shalt be;  
Red dawning, cloudy sky,  
Bloody death shalt thou die.

"Pray to the Moon when she is round,  
Luck with you will then abound,  
What you seek for shall be found  
On the sea or solid ground."

Moon-worship is very ancient; it is alluded to as a forbidden thing in
the Book of Job. From early times witches and other women worked their
spells when stark-naked by the light of the full moon, which is
evidently derived from the ancient worship of that planet and the

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

shameless orgies connected with it. Dr. WLISLOCKI simply remarks on this
subject that the moon has, in the gypsy incantation, "eine Phallische
Bedeutung." In ancient symbolism the horns of the moon were regarded as
synonymous with the horns of the ox-hence their connection with
agriculture, productiveness, and fertility, or the generative principle,
and from this comes the beneficent influence not only of the horns, but
of horse-shoes, boars' tusks, crabs' claws, and pieces of coral
resembling them.

The great love of gypsy mothers for their children, says WLISLOCKI,
induces their friends to seek remedies for the most trifling disorders.
At a later period, mother and child are left to Mother Nature—or the
*vis medicatrix Naturæ*. What is greatly dreaded is the *Berufen*, or
being called on, "enchanted," in English "overlooked," or subjected to
the evil eye. An universal remedy for this is the following:—

A jar is filled with water from a stream, and it must be taken *with*,
not against, the current as it runs. In it are placed seven coals, seven
handfuls of meal, and seven cloves of garlic, all of which is put on the
fire. When the water begins to boil it is stirred with a three-forked
twig, while the wise woman repeats:—

"Miseç' yakhá tut dikhen,  
Te yon káthe mudáren  
Te átunci eftá coká  
Te çaven miseçe yakhá;  
Miseç' yakhá tut dikhen,  
Te yon káthe mudáren  
But práhestár e yakhá  
Atunci kores th'ávená;  
Miseç' yakhá tut dikhen  
Te yon káthe mudáren  
Pçábuvená pçábuvená  
Andre develeskero yakhá!"

"Evil eyes look on thee,  
May they here extinguished be  
And then seven ravens  
Pluck out the evil eyes <span id="page_52">p. 52</span>  
Evil eyes (now) look on thee.  
May they soon extinguished be!  
Much dust in the eyes,  
Thence may they become blind,  
Evil eyes now look on thee;  
May they soon extinguished be!  
May they burn, may they burn  
In the fire of God!"

Dr. WLISLOCKI remarks that the "seven ravens" are probably represented
by the seven coals, while the three-pointed twig, the meal and the
garlic, symbolize lightning. He does not observe that the stick may be
the triçula or trident of Siva—whence probably the gipsy word *trushul*,
a cross; but the connection is very obvious. It is remarkable that the
gypsies assert that lightning leaves behind it a smell like that of
garlic. As garlic forms an important ingredient in magic charms, the
following from "The Symbolism of Nature" ("Die Symbolik und Mythologie
der Natur"), by J. B. FRIEDRICH, will be found interesting:—

"We find in many forms spread far and wide the belief that garlic
possesses the magic power of protection against poison and sorcery. This
comes, according to Pliny, from the fact that when it is hung up in the
open air for a time, it turns black, when it is supposed to attract evil
into itself—and, consequently, to withdraw it from the wearer. The
ancients believed that the herb which Mercury gave to Ulysses to protect
him from the enchantment of Circe, and which Homer calls *moly*, was the
*alium nigrum*, or garlic, the poison of the witch being a narcotic.
Among the modern Greeks and Turks, garlic is regarded as the most
powerful charm against evil spirits, magic, and misfortune. For this
reason they carry it with them, and hang it up in their houses as a
protection against storms and bad weather. So their sailors carry with
them a sack of it to avert shipwreck. If any one utters a word of praise
with the intention of fascinating or of doing harm, they cry aloud
'Garlic!' or utter it three times rapidly. In AULUS PERSIUS FLACCUS
(*Satyr. V*.) to bite garlic averts magic and the evils which the gods
send to those who are wanting in reverence for them. According to a
popular belief the mere pronunciation of 'Garlic!' protects one from
poison."

It appears to be generally held among them and the Poles that this word
prevents children from "*beschreien werden*," that is, from being
banned, or overlooked, or evil-eyed. And among the Poles garlic

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

is laid under children's pillows to protect them from devils and
witches. (BRATRANECK, "*Beiträge zur Æsthetik der Pflanzenweit*," p.
56). The belief in garlic as something sacred appears to have been very
widely spread, since the Druids attributed magic virtues to it; hence
the reverence for the nearly allied leek, which is attached to King
David and so much honoured by the Welsh.

"Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate  
Upon Saint David's Day."—SHAKESPEARE.

The magic virtues of garlic were naturally enough also attributed to
onions and leeks, and in a curious Italian work, entitled "Il Libro del
Comando," attributed (falsely) to Cornelius Agrippa, I find the
following:—

"*Segreto magico d'indovinare, colle cipole, la salute d'una persona
lontana*. A magic secret to divine with onions the health of a person
far distant. Gather onions on the Eve of Christmas and put them on an
altar, and under every onion write the name of the persons as to whom
one desires to be informed, *ancorche non scrivano*, even if they do not
write.

"The onion (planted) which sprouts the first will clearly announce that
the person whose name it bears is well.

"And in the same manner we can learn the name of the husband or wife
whom we should choose, and this divination is in use in many cantons of
Germany."

Very much allied to this is the following love charm from an English
gypsy:—

"Take an onion, a tulip, or any root of the kind (*i.e.* a bulbous
root?), and plant it in a clean pot never used before; and while you
plant it repeat the name of the one whom you love, and every day,
morning and evening, say over it

'As this root grows  
And as this blossom blows,  
May her heart be  
Turned unto me!'

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

"And it will come to pass that every day the one whom you love will be
more and more inclined to you, till you get your heart's desire."

A similar divination is practised by sowing cress or lettuce seed in the
form of names in gardens. If it grows well the one who plants it will
win the love of the person indicated.

As regards the use of coals in incantations, MARCELLUS
BURDIGALENSIS, <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) a Latin physician of
the third century, who has left us a collection of Latin and Gaelic
charms, recommends for a cure for toothache: "Salis granum, panis micam,
carbonem mortuum in phœnicio alligabis," *i.e.*, to carry a grain of
salt, a crumb of bread, and a coal, in a red bag.

When the witch-brew of coals, garlic, and meal is made, and boiled down
to a dry residuum, it is put into a small three-cornered bag, and hung
about the child's neck, on which occasion the appropriate rhyme is
repeated nine times. "And it is of special importance that the bag shall
be made of a piece of linen, which must be stolen, found, or begged."

To learn whether a child has been overlooked, or evil-eyed, or
enchanted, the "wise woman" takes it in her arms, and goes to the next
running stream. There she holds the face of the babe as nearly as she
can to the water, and repeats:—

"Páñi, páñi sikova,  
Dikh the upré, dikh télé!  
Buti páñi sikovel  
Buti pál yákh the dikhel  
Te ákáná mudárel."

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

"Water, water, hasten!  
Look up, look down  
Much water hastens  
(May) as much come into the eye  
Which looked evil on thee,  
And may it now perish."

If the running brook makes a louder sound than usual then it is supposed
to say that the child is enchanted, but if it runs on as before then
something else is the matter, and to ascertain what it is other charms
and ceremonies are had recourse to. This incantation indicates, like
many others, a constant dwelling in lonely places, by wood and stream,
as gypsies wont to do, and sweet familiarity with Nature, until one
hears sermons in stones, books in the running brooks, and voices in the
wind. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) Civilized people who read about
Red Indian sorcerers and gypsy witches very promptly conclude that they
are mere humbugs or lunatics—they do not realize how these people, who
pass half their lives in wild places watching waving grass and falling
waters, and listening to the brook until its cadence speaks in real
song, believe in their inspirations, and feel that there is the same
mystical feeling and presence in all things that live and move and
murmur as well as in themselves. Now we have against this the life of
the clubs and family, of receptions and business, factories and
stock-markets, newspapers and "culture." Absolutely no one who lives in
"the movement" can understand this sweet old sorcery. But nature is
eternal, and while grass grows and rivers run man is ever likely to fall
again into the eternal enchantments. And truly until he does he will
have no new poetry, no fresh

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

art, and must go on copying old ideas and having wretchedly worn-out
exhibitions in which there is not one original idea.

If it appears that the child is overlooked, or "berufen," many means are
resorted to, "one good if another fails," but we have here to do only
with those which are connected with incantations. A favourite one is the
following: Three twigs are cut, each one from a different tree, and put
into a pipkin which has been filled with water dipped or drawn *with*,
not against, the current of a stream. Three handfuls of meal are then
put in and boiled down to a *Brei*, or pudding. A horse hair is then
wound round a needle, which is stuck not by the point but by the head
into the inner bottom of a tube, which is filled with water, and placed
upon this is the pipkin with the pudding. Then the "overlooked," or
evil-seen child is held over the tub while the following rhyme is
chanted

"Páñi, páñi lunjárá,  
Páñi, páñi isbiná;  
Te náshválipen çucá  
Náshválipen mudárá,  
Mudára te ákáná,  
Káthe beshá ñikáná,  
Sár práytiña sutyárel,  
Káthe ándre piri, ándre piri,  
Nivasheshe les dávás!"

"Water, water, spread  
Water, water, stretch  
And sickness disappear,  
Sickness be destroyed,  
Be destroyed now.  
Remain not here at all  
Who ever has overlooked this child  
As this leaf in the pot (maybe)  
Be given to the Nivashi!"

This is repeated nine times, when the water in the tub, with the pipkin
and its contents, are all thrown into the stream from which the

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

water was drawn. This is a widely-spread charm, and it is extremely
ancient. The pipkin placed across the tub or trough—*trog*—here
signifies a bridge, and WLISLOCKI tells us that no Transylvanian
tent-gypsy will cross a bridge without first spitting thrice over the
rails into the water. The bridge plays an important part in the
mythology and Folk-lore of many races. The ancient Persians had their
holy mountain, Albordi, or Garotman, the abode of gods and blessed
souls, to which they passed by the bridge Cin-vat, or Chinevad, whence
the creed: "I believe in the resurrection of the dead; that all bodies
shall live renewed again, and I believe that by the bridge Cin-vat all
good deeds will be rewarded, and all evil deeds punished." The
punishment is apparent from the parallel of the bridge Al Sirat,
borrowed by the Mahommedans from the Persians, over which the good souls
passed to reward, and from which the wicked tumbled down into hell.

When I first met EMERSON in 1849 I happened to remark that a bridge in a
landscape was like a vase in a room, the point on which an eye trained
to the picturesque involuntarily rested. Nearly thirty years after, when
we were both living at Shepherd's Hotel in Cairo, he reminded me of this
one day when by the Nile we were looking at a bridge. As a bridge must
cross a stream, or a torrent which is generally beautiful by itself, and
as the cross or span has the effect of defining and framing the picture,
as a circlet or tiara sets off a beautiful head, it is not remarkable
that in all ages men have made such objects subjects of legend and song.
Hence the oft-repeated Devil's Bridge, so-called because it seemed to
simple peasants impossible for mere mortals to build, although bridges
are habitually and more naturally connected with salvation and saints.
He who in early ages built a bridge, did a great deed in times when
roads were rare; hence the great priest was called the Pontifex.

Another spell for the purpose of averting the effects of the evil eye is
as follows: The mother of the overlooked child fills her mouth with salt
water, and lets it drop or trickle on the limbs of the infant, and when
this has been done, repeats:

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

"Miseç yákhá tut dikhen  
Sár páñori—  
Mudaren!  
Náshvalipen prejia:  
Andral t'ro shero  
Andral t're kolyin,  
Andral t're per  
Andral t're punrá  
Andral t're vástá  
Kathe prejánen,—  
Andre yákhá yon jánen!"

"False (evil) eyes see thee,  
Like this water  
May they perish  
Sickness depart  
From thy head,  
From thy breast,  
From thy belly,  
From thy feet  
From thy hands,  
May they go hence  
Into the evil eyes!"

It may be observed that meal forms an ingredient in several of these
sorceries. It is a very ancient essential to sacrifices, and is offered
to the spirits of the stream to appease them, as it was often given for
the same purpose to the wind. The old Germans, says PRÆTORIUS, imagined
the storm-wind as a starving, ravenous being, and sought to appease it
by throwing meal to it. So it happened once even of later years near
Bamberg when a mighty wind was raging one night that an old woman took
her meal-bag and threw its contents out of the window, saying:—

"Lege dich, lieber Wind,  
Bringe diss deinem Kind!"

"Dear Wind, be not so wild,  
Take that unto thy child!"

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

"In which thing," adds the highly Protestant PRÆTORIUS ("Anthropodemus
Plutonicus," p. 429), "she was like the Papists who would fain appease
the *Donnerwetter*, or thunderstorms, with the sound of baptized bells,
as though they were raging round like famished lions, or grim wolves, or
a soldier foraging, seeking what they may devour." The Wind here
represents the Wild Hunter, or the Storm, the leader of the *Wüthende
Heer*, or "raging army," who, under different names, is the hero of so
many German legends.

That the voice of the wind should seem like that of wild beasts roaring
for food would occur naturally enough to any one who was familiar with
both.

When a child refuses the breast the gypsies believe that a Pçuvus-wife,
or a female spirit of the earth has secretly sucked it. In such a case
they place between the mother's breasts onions, and repeat these words:—

"Pçuvushi, Pçuvushi,  
Ac tu náshvályi  
Tito tçud ač yakhá,  
Andre pçuv tu pçábuvá!  
Thávdá, thávdá miro tçud,  
Thávdá, thávdá, parno tçud,  
Thávdá, thávdá, sár kámáv,—  
Mre čáveske bokhale!"

"Earth-spirit! Earth-spirit  
Be thou ill.  
Let thy milk be fire  
Burn in the earth!  
Flow, flow, my milk!  
Flow, flow, white milk!  
Flow, flow, as I desire  
To my hungry child!"

The same is applied when the milk holds back or will not flow, as it is
then supposed that a Pçuvus-wife has secretly suckled her own child at
the mother's breast. It is an old belief that elves put their own
offspring in the place of infants, whom they sometimes steal. This
subject of elf-changelings

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

is extensively treated by all the writers on witchcraft. There is even a
Latin treatise, or thesis, devoted to defining the legal and social
status, rights, &c., of such beings. It is entitled, "De Infantibus
Supposititiis, vulgo Wechsel-Bälgen," Dresden, 1678. "Such infants,"
says the author (JOHN VALENTINE MERBITZ), "are called Cambiones,
Vagiones (*à continuo vagitu*), Germanis Küllkräpfe, Wechselkinder,
Wechselbälge, all of which indicates, in German belief, children which
have nothing human about them except the skin."

When the child is subject to convulsive weeping or spasms, and loses its
sleep, the mother takes a straw from the child's sleeping-place and puts
into her mouth. Then, while she is fumigated with dried cow-dung, into,
which the hair of the father and mother have been mingled, she chants:—

"Bala, bálá pçubuven,  
Čik te bálá pçubuven,  
Čik te bálá pçubuven,  
Pçábuvel náshvályipen!"

"Hair, hair, burn!  
Dirt and hair burn  
Dirt and hair burn  
Illness be burned!"

This bears manifest mark of Hindoo origin, and I have no doubt that the
same ceremony in every detail is practised in India at the present day.
In Southern Hungary convulsive weeping in children is cured as follows:
In the evening, when the fire burns before the tent, the mother takes
her child in her arms and carries it three times around the fire,
putting on it a pipkin full of water, into which she puts three coals.
With this water she washes the head of her child, and pours some of it
on a black dog. Then she goes to the next stream or brook, and lets fall
into it a red twist, saying:—

"Lává Niváshi ádá bolditori te láhá m're čaveskro rovipen! Káná
sástavestes ánáv me tute pçábáyá te yándrá."

"Nivashi take this twist, and with it the weeping of my child. When it
is well I will bring thee apples and eggs."

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

When a child "bumps" its head the swelling is pressed with the blade of
a knife, and the following spell is muttered thrice, seven, or nine
times, according to the gravity of the injury:—

"Ač tu, ač in, ač kovles,  
The may sik tu mudarés!  
Andre pcuv tu jiá,  
Dikav tut me ñikáná!  
Shuri, shuri áná,  
De pal pçuv!"

"Be thou, be thou, be thou weak (*i.e.*, soft)  
And very soon perish!  
Go thou into the earth,  
May I see thee never more  
Bring knives, knives,  
Give (*i.e.*, put) into the earth."

Then the knife is stuck three, seven, or nine times into the earth. If
the child or a grown person has a bleeding at the nose, some of the
blood is covered with earth, and the following verse repeated

"Pçuvush, dáv tute  
Pcuvush, lává mánge,  
De tre cáveske  
Hin may táte!  
Sik lava!"

"Pcuvus, I give to thee,  
Pcuvus, oh take from me,  
Give it to thy child,  
It is very warm,  
Take it quickly!"

If the child has pains in the stomach, the hair of a black dog is burned
to powder and kneaded with the mother's milk and some of the feces of
the child into a paste. This prescription occurs in the magical medical
formulas Of MARCEI.LUS BURDIGALENIS, the court-physician at Rome in the
fourth century: "Cape mel atticum et stercus infantis quod primum

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

demittit, statim ex lacte mulieris quæ puerum allactat permiscebis et
sic inunges," &c. Most of the prescriptions of Marcellus were of ancient
Etrurian origin, and I have found many of them still in use in the
Romagna Toscana. This is put into a cloth and bound on the belly of the
child. When it falls asleep a hole is bored in a tree and the paste put
into it. The hole is then stopped up with a wooden plug, and while this
is being done the following is repeated:—

"Andrál por prejiá,  
André selene beshá!  
Beshá beshá tu káthe!  
Penáv, penáv me tu te!"

"Depart from the belly  
Live in the green! (tree)  
Remain, remain thou here  
I say, I say to thee!"

The black dog is in many countries associated with sorcery and
diabolical influences, and "in European heathendom it was an emblem of
the evil principle. The black demon Černobog was represented by the
Slavs as a black dog. Among the Wallachians there is a horrible
vampire-like creature called Priccolitsh, or Priculics, who appears as a
man in fine healthy condition, but by night he becomes a dog, kills
people by the mere touch, and devours them." The black dogs of Faust and
of Cornelius Agrippa will occur to most readers.

Gypsies have always been regarded as sorcerers and child-stealers, and
it is remarkable that Lilith, the mother of all witchcraft, did the
same. At the present day the Slavonian gypsies have spells against such
a spirit.

In the Chaldæan magic, as set forth by Lenormant, as I have already
stated, the powers of evil are incarnate diseases, they are seven in
number, and they are invoked by means of verses which bear an
extraordinary resemblance to those which are still current in Italy as
well as in other countries. According to some writers this is all mere
chance coincidence, or due to concurrent causes and similar conditions
in different countries.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

That diseases, like hunger, or death, or the terrors of the night, may
have been incarnated as evil spirits naturally by all mankind may be
granted, but when we find them arranged in categories of numbers, in
widely different countries, employing the same means of banishing
them—that is, by short songs and drum-beating—when we find these
incantations in the same general forms, often with the same words, our
belief as to the identity of origin is confirmed at every step. We can
admit that the Jews were in Babylon and wandered thence all over the
world, but that any other religious or superstitious system should have
done the same would be obstinately denied. And by an incredible
inconsistency, scholars who admit the early migrations of whole races on
a vast scale, from the remotest regions of the East to Western Europe,
deny that legends and myths come with them or that they could have
spread in like manner.

One of the attributes of the witch of the Middle Ages in which she has
been confused with the Queen of the Fairies, and fairies in general, is
that she steals newly-born children. This is a very ancient attribute of
the female demon or sorceress or *strega*, and it is found among Jews at
the present day who believe in the *Benemmerinnen*, or witches who haunt
women in childbirth as well as in Lilith. "The Jews banish this first
wife of Adam by writing on the walls, '*Adam chava chuz Lilith*,' ('Keep
away from here, Lilith!')" ("Anthropodemus Plutonicus," by JOHN
PRÆTORIUS, 1666). That it is very ancient is rendered probable because
the famous Bogomile formula of incantation against the twelve fever-fits
(*Tresevica*), or kinds of fever, turns entirely on the legend of six
children stolen by the demon who is compelled to restore them. Here we
have the very oldest form of witchcraft known, that is incarnate disease
in numbers allied to child-stealing. This spell of the Tresevica. is
attributed, says Dr. GASTER, to Pope JEREMIA, the founder of Bogomilism
(the great Oriental Slavonian heresy which spread over Europe in the
Middle Ages and prepared the way for [Protestantism](errata.htm#1.md).
"There is no doubt, therefore, that the spell is derived from the East,
and I have else

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

where proved its existence in that quarter as early as the eighth
century. It may have been of Manichæan origin. It has been preserved up
to the present day in all the lands of Eastern Europe and, with certain
modifications, exists among Germans and Jews." Though attributed to
Sisynios, the immediate follower Of MANES, as chief of the Manichæans,
it seems to have been derived from an earlier Oriental tale which became
the basis of all later formulæ. I give it here in the Roumanian form,
which closely resembles the old one. Here, as in all the other variants,
the demon is a feminine one. The following is the legend:—

"I, Sisveas, I came down from the Mount of Olives, saw the Archangel
Gabriel as he met the Avestitza, wing of Satan, and seized her by the
hair and asked her where she was going. And she answered that she was
going to cheat the holy Virgin by her tricks, steal the new-born child,
and drink its blood. The archangel asked her how she could get into
houses so as to steal the children, and she answered that she changed
herself into a fly or a cat or such forms. But whosoever knew her twelve
and a half (nineteen) names and wrote them out she could not touch. She
told him these names, and they were written down."

There is a Coptic as well as a Greek parallel to this. The fairy who
steals the children is called Lilith, and is further identified with
Herodias and her twelve daughters as personifications of different kinds
of fever. This is extremely interesting, as it casts some light on a
question which has greatly puzzled all writers on witchcraft as to how
or why *Herodias* was so generally worshipped in company with Diana by
witches as a goddess in Italy. This is mentioned by PIPERNUS,
GRILLANDUS, MIRANDOLA, and HORST. The name is probably much older than
that of the Herodias of the New Testament.

newly-killed ox or sheep, and left him in some wild ravine by a roaring
torrent to pass the night. From such sights and sounds there resulted
impressions which were reflected in his dreams (*Vide* Scott, "Lady of
the Lake," and notes). The fact that running water often makes sounds
like the human voice has been observed by the Algonkin Indians of Maine
and Nova Scotia (*Vide* "The Algonkin Legends of New England," by
Charles G. Leland).
