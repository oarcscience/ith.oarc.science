# CHAPTER XV

### GYPSY AMULETS

"Knew many an amulet and charm  
Which would do neither good nor harm,  
In Rosicrucian lore as learned  
As he that *veré adeptus* earned."—HUDIBRAS.

<span id="img_23001"></span> ![](img/23001.jpg)WITH pleasant
plausibility HEINE has traced the origin of one kind of fairy-lore to
the associations and feelings which we form for familiar objects. A
coin, a penknife, a pebble, which has long been carried in the pocket or
worn by any one, seems to become imbued with his or her personality. If
it could speak, we should expect to hear from it an

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

echo of the familiar voice of the wearer; as happened, indeed, in
Thuringia in the year 1562, when a fair maid, Adelhait von Helbach, was
carried into captivity by certain ill-mannered persons. "Now her
friends, pursuing, knew not whither to go, when they heard her voice,
albeit very small and feeble, calling to them; and, seeking, they found
in the bush by the road a silver image of the Virgin, which she had
worn: and this image told them which road to take. Following the
direction, they recovered her; the Raubritter who bore her away being
broken on the wheel, and the image hung up for the glory of the Virgin,
who had spoken by it, in the Church of our Lady of Kalbrunn." Again,
these objects have such strange ways of remaining with one that we end
by suspecting that they have a will of their own. With certain persons
these small familiar friends become at last fetishes, which bring luck,
giving to those who firmly believe in them great comfort and endurance
in adversity.

Who has not been amazed at the persistency with which some button or
pebble picked up, or placed perchance in the pocket, remains in all the
migrations of keys and pencils and coins, faithful to the charge? How
some card or counter will lurk in our pocket-book (misnamed "purse") or
porte-monnaie, until it becomes clear as daylight that it has a
reasonable intelligence, and stays with us because it wants to. As soon
as this is recognized—especially by some person who is accustomed to
feel mystery in everything, and who doubts nothing—the object becomes
something which knows, possibly, a great deal which we do not. Therefore
it is to be treated with care and respect, and in due time it becomes a
kind of god, or at least the shrine of a small respectable genius, or
fairy. I have heard of a gentleman in the Western United States who had
a cane in which, as he seriously believed, a spirit had taken up its
abode, and he reverenced it accordingly. The very ancient and
widely-spread belief in the efficiency of magic wands probably came from
an early faith in such implements as had been warranted to have magic
virtues as weapons, or to aid a pedestrian in walking. Hence it

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

happened that swords which had been enchanted, or which had taken lives,
were supposed to have some indwelling intelligence. Hence also the names
given to swords, and indeed to all weapons, by the Norsemen. It was
believed that the sword of an executioner, after it had beheaded a
certain number of men, pined for more victims, and manifested its desire
by unearthly rattling or ringing. *Apropos* of which I have in my
possession such a gruesome implement, which if experience in death could
give it life, or make it ring in the silent watches of the night, would
be a ghastly, noisy guest indeed. I once told the story in "The Gypsies"
(Boston; 1881)—now I have something to add to it. I had met in London
with an Indian gypsy named NANO, who informed me that in India he had
belonged to a wandering tribe or race who called themselves Rom, or
Romani, who spoke Romani *jib*, and who were the Gypsies of the Gypsies.
I have in my possession a strange Hindu knife with an enormously broad
blade, six inches across towards the end, with a long handle richly
mounted in bronze with a little silver. I never could ascertain till I
knew NANO what it had been used for. Even the old king of Oude, when he
examined it, went wrong and was uncertain. Not so the gypsy. When he was
in my library, and his keen black eyes rested on it, he studied it for a
moment, and then said: "I know well enough that knife. I have seen it
before; it is very old, and it was long in use—it was the knife used by
the public executioner in Bhotan. It is Bhotanî."

NANO had volunteered the explanation, and whatever his moral character
might be, he was not given to romantic invention. Time passed, I went to
America, stayed there four years, and returned. In 1888 I became a
member of the National Association for the Advancement of Art, and was
on the Central Committee. One day we had a meeting at the house of a
distinguished architect. When it was over, my host showed me his many
treasures of art or archæology. While examining these, my attention was
attracted by an Indian knife. It was precisely like mine, but smaller. I
asked what it was, and learned that it had long been used in some place
in the East for the express purpose of sacrificing

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

young girls. And in all respects It was what we might call the feminine
counterpart of my knife. And if I ever had any lingering doubt as to the
accuracy of NANO's account, it disappeared when I saw the one whose
history was perfectly authentic. A few years ago in Heidelburg there
were sold at auction a great number of executioners' swords, some of
which had been used for centuries. A gentleman who had a special
fondness for this kind of *bric-à-brac*, had for many years collected
them.

It may be here observed that the *knife* forms a special feature in all
witch-lore, and occurs frequently among the Hungarian and Italian gypsy
charms, or spells. It is sometimes stuck into a table, while a spell is
muttered, protesting that it is not the *wood* which one wishes to hurt;
but the heart of an enemy. Here the knife is supposed in reality to have
an indwelling spirit which will pass to the heart or health of the one
hated. In Tam O'Shanter there is a knife on the witches' table, and in
Transylvania, as in Tuscany, a new knife, not an old one, is used in
divers ceremonies. Sometimes an old and curious knife becomes an amulet
and is supposed to bring luck, although the current belief is that any
pointed gift causes a quarrel.

But to return to the fetish or pocket-deity which is worn in so many
forms, be they written scrolls, crosses, medals or relics—*cést tout
un*. Continental gypsies are notable believers in amulets. Being in a
camp of very wild Cigany in Hungary a few years ago, I asked them what
they wore for *bakt*, or luck; whereupon they all produced small
seashells, which I was assured were potent against ordinary misfortunes.
But for a babe which was really ill they had provided an "appreciable"
dose in the form of three Maria Theresa silver dollars, which were hung
round its neck, but hidden under its clothes. And I may here remark that
all through many lands, even into the heart of Africa, this particular
dollar is held in high esteem for magical purposes. From one to another
the notion has been transferred, and travellers and traders are often
puzzled to know why the savages will have no coin

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

save this. From Russia to the Cape it is the same story, and one to be
specially studied by those ethnologists who do not believe in
transmission, and hold that myths and legends are of local growth and
accounted for by similar local conditions.

The gypsies were very desirous to know what my charm was. Fortunately I
had in my pocket a very fine fossil shark's tooth which I had purchased
in Whitby, and this was greatly admired by the learned of the tribe.
Mindful of good example, I obtained for myself specimens of the mystic
shells, foreseeing that they would answer as passes and signs among the
fraternity in Germany and elsewhere. Which, indeed, came to pass a few
days ago in the town of Homburg, when looking from my window in the
Schwedenpfad I saw two very honest-looking gypsies go by. Walking forth,
I joined them, and led them into a garden, where over beer and cigars we
discussed "the affairs of Egypt." These Romanys were from the Tyrol, and
had the frank bold manner of the mountain-men blended with the natural
politeness of the better class of gypsy. I had taken with me in my
pocket, foreseeing its use, a small bag or purse, containing an
assortment of objects such as would have puzzled anybody except a Red
Indian, a negro, or any believer in *medaolin* or Voodoo, or my new
acquaintance; and after a conversation on *dúrkepen* (in Anglo-gypsy,
*dukkerin*) or fortune-telling, I asked the men what they wore. They
wished to see my amulets first. So I produced the shells; which were at
once recognized and greatly admired, especially one, which is something
of a curiosity, since in its natural markings is the word NAV very
plainly inscribed: *Nav*, in gypsy, meaning "the name." The elder gypsy
said he had no charm; he had long been seeking a good one, but had not
as yet met with the correct article. And then he begged me-gracious
powers, how he *did* beg!—to bestow on him one of my shells. I resolved
to do so—but at another time.

The younger gypsy, who was a *pasche-paskero*, a musician, and had with
him a rare old violin in a wonderfully carved wooden case at least two
centuries old, was "all right" on the fetish question. He had his

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

shell, sewn up in a black leather bag, which he wore by a cord round his
neck. Then I exhibited my small museum. Every object in it was carefully
and seriously examined. My shark's tooth was declared to be a very good
fetish, a black pebble almost equal to the shell, and an American Indian
arrow-head of quartz passed muster as of possible though somewhat
doubtful virtue. But an English sixpence with a hole in it was rejected
as a very petty and contemptible object. I offered it in vain as a
present to my friends: they would not accept it. Neither did they want
money: my dross might perish with me. It was the shell—the precious
beautiful little shell on which the Romany in search of a fetish had set
his heart; the shell which would bring him luck, and cause him to be
envied, and ensure him admiration in the tents of the wanderers from
Paris to Constantinople. He admitted that it was the very shell of
shells—*a baro seréskeri sharkûni*, or famous sea-snail. I believe the
gypsies would have given me their fine old Stainer violin and the carved
case for it. Failing to get the shell, he implored me to give him the
black pebble. I resolved to give him both in free gift the next time we
met, or as a parting souvenir. Alas for the Romany chal!—we never met
again. The police allow no gypsies in Homburg, and so they had to move
on. I sought them that night and I sought them next day; but they were
over the hills and far away. But I have no doubt that the fame of the
shell on which Nature has written the Name—the very *logos* of magic
itself—spread ere the summer was past even to the Carpathians. Something
tells me that it is not played out yet, and that I shall hear anon
something regarding it.

The cult of the shell is widely spread. One day in a public-house, in
the West End of London, I, while taking my glass of bitter, entered into
conversation with a rather tall, decently-attired brunette Alsatian
girl, who spoke French and German, and who knew a few words of Romany,
which she said she had picked up by [accident](errata.htm#4.md)—at least
she professed not to be gypsy, and to know no more. Being minded to test
the truth of this, I casually exhibited one of my shells

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

and said it was a Hungarian gypsy amulet for *la bonne fortune*. She
began to beg earnestly for it, without getting it. On several occasions
at long intervals, when I met her in the street, she again implored me
for the treasure, saying that she believed "if she had it, her luck
would turn to good." And, being convinced of her gypsyism, I said, "It
will do you no good unless you have *faith*." To which she replied, in a
tone which indicated truth itself: "But I *have* faith—absolute, entire
faith in it." Which seeing, and finding that she was a true convert to
the power of the holy shell, I gave it to her with my blessing, knowing
that it would be a joy and comfort to her in all the trial, of life.

This reminds me that I have seen, and indeed possess, a pearl-shell
bearing the image of Saint Francis of Assisi, such as is sold by
thousands at his shrine, and which are supposed to possess certain
miraculous innate or intrinsic virtues. Thus, if worn by children, they
are a cure for croup.—Ah—but *that* is a *very* different thing, you
know."

An idol is an object, generally an image, worshipped for its *own*
sake—being supposed to not only represent a god, but to have some
immanent sanctity. The Catholic priest, and for that matter all Brahmins
or bonzes, assure us that *their* sacred images are "only symbols, not
regarded as really dwelling-places of divinity." They are not, so to
speak, magnified amulets. Yet how is it that, if this he true, so many
images and pictures are regarded and represented by priests as being
able *of themselves* by the touch to cure tooth-ache, and all other ills
which flesh and bones are heirs to. Why is *one* image especially good
for tooth-ache, while *another* of the same person cures cramp? Why, if
they are all only "symbols," is one more healing or holy than another?
How can our Lady of Embrun be of greater aid than our Lady of Paris? The
instant we ascribe to an image or a shell real power to act, we make of
it an inspired being in itself, and all the sophistry in the world as to
its being a means of faith, or a symbol, or

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

causing a higher power to act on the suppliant, is rubbish. The devotee
believes *tout bonnement* that the *image* works the cure, and if he did
not, any other image of the Virgin or Saint would answer the same
purpose. This chaff has been thrashed out a thousand times—or many tens
of thousand times in vain,—as vain so far as effects go as is the
remarkably plain First Commandment. And it will last, while one fetish
endures, that the hierophant will call it a mere "symbol," and the
ignorant worshipper, absolutely unable to comprehend him, *will* worship
the symbol as the thing itself—as he is really expected to do.

According to J. B. FRIEDRICH, "Symbolik der Natur," the seashell, on
account of its being a product of the sea, or of the all-generating
moisture; and much more probably from its shape, is an emblem of woman
herself. Therefore as 'Venus, Love's goddess, was born of the sea,"
shells are dedicated to her. ("Museo Bourbonico," Vol. vi. p. 10.
KUGLER, "Handbuch Geschichte der Malerei," Berlin, 1837, Vol. iv. p.
311. Also translated by Sir H. AUSTIN LAYARD). Being one of the great
emblems of productive Nature, or of life and light, and opposed to
barrenness, absence of pleasure, darkness, or negation, it was of course
a charm against witchcraft or evil. That the gypsies have retained it as
a powerful agent for "luck," is extremely interesting, showing to what a
degree they are still influenced by the early symbolism which
effectively formed not one but many mythologies. Among the Hungarian
gypsies the virtue or magical power of a shell is in proportion to the
degree of resemblance above mentioned, which it possesses, as Wlislocki
expressly declares.

This association of shells, with the mysterious and magical, is to be
found among gypsies in the East, as is shown by the following: from my
work entitled "The Gypsies." It describes something which I saw many
times in Cairo—

"Beyond the door which, when opened, gave this sight, was a dark,
ancient archway, twenty yards long, which opened on the glaring, dusty
street, where camels with their drivers, and screaming *saïs* or
carriage-runners and donkey-boys and crying

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

venders kept up the wonted Oriental din. But in the archway, in its
duskiest corner, there sat in silence and immovable, a living picture-a
dark, handsome woman, of thirty years, who was unveiled. She had before
her on the gateway floor, a square of cloth and a few shells. Sometimes
an Egyptian of the lower class stopped, and there would be a grave
consultation. She was a fortune-teller, and from the positions which the
shells assumed when thrown she predicted what would come to pass. And
then there would be a solemn conference and a thoughtful stroking of the
beard, if the applicant was a man, and then the usual payment to the
oracle, and a departure. And it was all world-old primæval Egyptian, as
it was Chaldæan, for the woman was a Rhagarin, or gypsy, and as she sat
so sat the diviners of ancient days by the wayside, casting shells for
auspices, even as arrows were cast of old, to be cursed by Israel.

"It is not remarkable that among the myriad *manteias* of olden days
there should have been one by shells. The sound of the sea when heard in
a nautilus or conch is marvellously—like that of ocean surges murmuring
far."

"Shake me and it awakens—then apply  
Its polished lips to your attentive ear,  
And it remembers its august abodes  
And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there."

All of this is very strange to children and not less so to all
unsophisticated folk, and I can remember how in boyhood I was told and
listened with perfect faith to the distant roaring, and marvelled at the
mystery of the ocean song being thus for ever kept alive inland. The
next step to this is to hear in the sea-murmuring something like voices,
and this is as curious as it is true—that if the mind be earnestly given
to it, and the process be continued for a long time during several days,
many persons, and probably all in time, will come to distinguish or hear
human utterances and eventually words. There is no special faith
required here; the mind even of the most sceptical or unimaginative will
often turn back on itself, and by dint of mere perseverance produce such
effects. An old pitcher or jug of a peculiar shape is also declared to
be admirably adapted for this purpose, and I have one of Elizabeth's
time which was trawled up from the sea near Lowestoft which would fulfil
every requisition.

In 1886 I was by moonlight in a camp of gypsies in the old Roman
amphitheatre near Budapest. It was a very picturesque sight, what with

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

the blazing fire, the strangely-dressed men, the wild shrieking,
singing, and dancing women. And when, as I have before mentioned, they
showed me the shells which they carried for amulets, they exhibited one
much larger o conch-like form, the tip of which had been removed and to
which there was attached a flexible tube. This was used in a very
remarkable trick. The shell, or one like it, is put into the hands of
the person consulting the oracle, who is directed to listen to the voice
of the Nivashi, or spirit of the air. Then he is blindfolded, the tube
applied, and through it the gypsy speaks in a trained soft voice. Thus,
in *conchomanteia*, the oracles still live and devotees still hear the
fairies talk.

Now, be it observed that hearing is the most deceptive of the senses—as
the reader may have seen exemplified by a lecturer, when the audience
were persuaded that he was fiddling on one cane with another, or blowing
a flute tune on one, when the music was made by a confederate behind a
screen. I myself, a few days since, when in the Köppern Thal, verily
believed I heard the murmur and music of children's voices—when lo! it
proved to be the babbling brook. Some years ago—I forget where it
happened in England, but I guarantee the truth of what I tell—it was
found that the children in a certain village were in the habit of going
to an ancient tomb in which there was a round hole, putting their ears
to it, and, as they said, of listening to what the dead people were
saying. It is facile enough to understand that among them there would be
some whose unconscious creative faculty would lead them to literally
hearing words or songs. There is another ancient and beautiful mystical
association with shells. The conch when pierced formed a trumpet, whose
notes seemed to be allied to the murmuring of the wind and waves heard
in the shell when applied to the ear. The sea-god Triton blew upon a
shell—"meaning thereby the roaring of the waves." "And in analogous wise
a shell is represented on the Tower of the Winds in Athens, to represent
Boreas, the north-east wind, and the roaring of the storm" (MILLIN,
"Gallerie Mythologique"). The resemblance of wind to the human voice has
probably occurred to every human being, and has furnished

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

similes for every poet. That these voices should be those of spirits is
a natural following. So the last Hebrew oracle, the Bath Kol, or
Daughter of the Voice, survives in shells and lives in gypsy-lore. And
so we find in rags and patches on the garments of Egyptian fellahin the
edges of Pharaoh's garment, which in olden time it was an honour for
kings to kiss.

Deception of this kind by means of voices, apparently supernatural, is
of great antiquity. The high priest Savan the Asmunian, of Egypt, is
said to have used acoustic tubes for this purpose, and it is very
evident that the long corridors or passages in the stone temples must
have suggested it as well as whispering galleries. The Hebrew Cabalists
are believed to have made one form of the mysterious Teraphim by taking
the head of a child and so preparing it by magic ceremonies that when
interrogated it would reply. These ceremonies consisted in fact of
skilfully adjusting a phonetic tube to the head. It is very probable
that the widely-spread report of this oracle gave rise to the belief
that the Jews slaughtered and sacrificed children. "Eliphaz Levi," or
the Abbé Constant, a writer of no weight whatever as an authority, but
not devoid of erudition, and with occasional shrewd insights, gives it
as his belief that the terrible murders of hundreds of children by
Gilles de Retz—the absurdly so-called original of Blue-beard—were
suggested by a recipe for sanguinary sorcery, drawn from some Hebrew
Cabalistical book. Nicephorus (Lib. 7 c. 33) and Cedrenus, as cited by
Grosius in his "Magica" (1597), tell us that when Constantine was ill a
number of children were collected to be slain that the emperor might
bathe in their blood (*in quo si se Imperator ablueret, certo
recuperaret*), and that because he was moved by the tears of their
mothers to spare their lives, was restored to health by the saints. It
seems to have escaped the attention of writers that at the very time
during the Middle Ages when the Jews were being most bitterly persecuted
for offering children at the Passover, it was really a common thing
among Christians to sacrifice children, maids, or grown-up people, by
burying them alive under the foundations of castles, &c., to insure
their stability—a ghastly sacrifice, which in after-times took the form
of walling-up a

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

cock and finally an egg. But from an impartial and common-sense
standpoint: there could be no difference between the sacrifice of a
child by a Cabalist and the torturing and burning witches and heretics
by ecclesiastics, unless, indeed, that the latter was the wickeder of
the two, since the babes were simply promptly killed, while the
Inquisitors put their victims to death with every refinement of mental
and physical torture. Both Cabalist and priest were simply engaged in
different forms of one and the same fetish-work which had been handed
down from the days of witchcraft. Nor did Calvin, when he burnt
Servetus, differ in anything from a Voodoo sacrificing "a goat without
horns."

Punishing a heretic to please or placate the Deity differs in nothing
from killing any victim to get luck. Other sentiments may be mingled
with this "conjuring," but the true foundation of black witchcraft (and
all witchcraft is black which calls for blood, suffering, starvation,
and the sacrifice of natural instincts), is the mortar of the fear of
punishment, and the stones of the hope of reward, the bulk of the latter
being immeasurably greater than that of the former, which is a mere
*Bindemittel*, or means of connection.

It is remarkable that nowhere, not even in England, do the gypsies
regard the witch as utterly horrible, diabolical, and damnable. She is
with them simply a woman who has gained supernatural power, which she
uses for good or misuses for evil according to her disposition. The
witch of the Church—Catholic or Protestant—when closely examined is a
very childish conception. She sets forth personal annoyance without any
regard whatever as to whether it is really good in disguise or a natural
result of our own follies. Thus witches caused thunder-storms, which,
because they were terrifying and more or less destructive, were
seriously treated by the Church as unmitigated evils, therefore as
phenomena directly due to the devil and his servants. Theology the
omniscient did not know that storms cleared the air. Witches were
responsible for all pestilences, and very often for all disorders of any
kind—as it was very convenient for the ignorant leech to attribute to
sorcery or moral delinquency

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

or to God a disease which he could not cure. For "Theology, the science
of sciences," had not as yet ascertained that plagues and black deaths,
and most of the ills of man are the results of neglect of cleanliness,
temperance, and other sanitary laws. It is only a few years since a very
eminent clergyman and president of a college in America attributed to
"Divine dispensation" the deaths of a number of students, which were
directly due to palpable neglect of proper sanitary arrangements by the
reverend gentleman himself, and his colleagues. But, admitting the
"divine dispensation," according to the mediæval theory, the president,
as the agent, must have been a "wizard"—or conjuror—a delusion which the
most superficial examination of his works would at once dissipate. But
to return—there can be no denial whatever that according to what is
admitted to be absolutely true to-day by everybody, be he orthodox or
liberal, witches, had they existed, must have been agents of God, busied
in preventing plagues instead of causing them—by raising storms which
cleared the air. Even the Algonkin Indians knew more than the Church in
this respect, for they have a strange old legend to the effect that when
the god of Storms, *Wuch-ow-sen*, the giant eagle, was hindered by a
magician from his accustomed work, the sea and air grew stagnant, and
people died. <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) The witch was simply
another form of the Hebrew Azrael, God's Angel of Death.

Which may all lead to the question: If a belief in witches as utterly
evil servants of the devil could be held as an immutable dogma of the
Church and a matter of eternal truth for eternal belief-to prove which
there is no end of ingenious argument and an appalling array of
ecclesiastical authority cited in the black-letter "Liber de
Sortilegiis" Of PAULUS GRILLANDUS, now lying before me (Lyons, 1547), as
well as in the works of SPRENGER, BODINUS, DELRIO, and the Witch-bull of
Pope Innocent—and if this belief be now exploded even among the priests,
what proof have we that any of the dogmas which went with it are
*absolutely* and for ever true? This is the question of *dogmatik*,
*versus* development or evolution, and witchcraft

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

is its greatest solvent. For when people believe, or make believe, in a
thing so very much as to torture like devils and put to death hundreds
of thousands of fellow-beings, mostly helpless and poor old women, not
to mention many children, it becomes a matter of very serious import to
all humanity to determine once for all whether the system or code
according to which this was done was absolutely *right for ever*, or
not. For if it was true, these executions and the old theory of
witchcraft were all *quite* right, as the Roman Church still declares,
since the Pope has sanctioned of late years several very entertaining
works in which modern spiritualists, banjo-twangers, table-turners, &c.,
are declared to be really wizards, who perform their stupendous and
appalling miracles directly by the aid of devils. And, by the way,
somebody might make an interesting work not only on the works in the
*Index Librum Prohibitorum*, which it entails seventy-six distinct kinds
of damnation to read, but also on those which the Pope *sanctions*—I
believe, blesses. Among the later of the latter is one which pretends to
prove that Jews do really still continue to sacrifice Christian children
at the Passover feast—and, for aught I know, to eat them, fried in oil,
or "buttered with goose-grease"—apropos of which, I marvel that the
Hebrews, instead of tamely denying it, do not boldly retort on the
Christians the charge of torturing their own women and children to death
as witches, which was a thousand times wickeder than simply bleeding
them with a pen-knife, as young Hugh of Lincoln was said to have been
disposed of by the Jew's daughter.

But people all say now—that was the *age*, and the Church was still
under the influence of barbarism, and so on. Exactly; but that admission
plainly knocks down and utterly destroys the whole platform of dogmatism
and the immutable and eternal truth of any dogma whatever, for it admits
evolution—and to seize on its temporary fleeting forms and proclaim that
they are immutable, is to mistake the temporal for the eternal, the
infinitesimal fraction for the whole. This is not worshipping GOD, the
illimitable, unknown tremendous Source of Life, but His minor

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

temporary forms, "essences," or "angels," as the Cabalists termed the
successive off-castings of His manifestations.

In Being's flood, in action's storm,  
I work and weave—above, beneath,  
Work and weave in endless motion  
Birth and death, an infinite ocean  
    A seizing and giving  
    The fire of the living.  
'Tis thus at the roaring loom of Time I ply  
And weave for God the garment thou seest Him by.

Now there are infinite numbers of these garments, but none of them are
GOD, though the Church declared that what they had of them were truly
Divine. So Oriental princes sent their old clothes to distant provinces
to be worshipped, as GESSLER sent his hat: it is an old, old story, and
one which will be long repeated in many lands.

I have, not far back, mentioned a work on witchcraft by PAULUS
GRILLANDUS. Its full title is "Tractatus de Hereticis et sortilegiis,
omnifariam Coitio eorumque penis. Item de Questionibus et Tortura ac de
Relaxatione Carceratorum"—that is, in brief, a work on Heretics, Witches
breakers of the Seventh Commandment of all kinds, Examination by
Torture, and Imprisonment. It was a leading *vade mecum*, or standard
guide, in its time for lawyers and the clergy, especially the latter,
and reads as if it had come from the library of hell, and been written
by a devil, though composed, according to the preface, to promote the
dignity and glory of the Christian Church. I can well believe that a
sensitive humane person could be really maddened by a perusal and full
comprehension of all the diabolical horrors which this book reveals, and
the glimpses which it gives of what must have been endured literally by
millions of heretics and "witches," and all men or women merely
*accused* by anybody of any kind of "immorality," especially of
"heresy." I say suspected or accused—for either was sufficient to
subject a victim to horrible agonies until he or she confessed. What is
most revolting is the calm, icy-cold-blooded

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

manner in which the most awful, infernal cruelties are carefully
discussed—as, for instance, if one has already had any limbs amputated
for punishment whether further tortures may then be inflicted? It is
absolutely a relief to find that among the six kinds of persons legally
exempted from the rack, &c.—there are *only six* and these do not
include invalids—are pregnant women. But such touches of common humanity
are rare indeed in it. I do not exaggerate in the least when I say that
the whole spirit of this work—which faithfully reflects the whole spirit
of the "justice" of the Middle Ages—inclines in a ferocious, wolfish
manner to *extend* and multiply punishment of the most horrible kinds to
every small offence against the Church—to manufacture and increase crime
as if it were capital for business, and enlarge the sphere of torture so
as to create power and awe.

Nous avons changé tout cela, say the descendants of those fiends in
human form. But if it was wrong *then* why did you do it if you were
*infallible* inspired judges? And if you now believe that to be
*atrocious* which was once holy, and a vast portion of your whole
system, how can you say that the Church does not follow the laws of
evolution and progress—and if so, where will it stop? It is a curious
reflection that if the Pope and Cardinals of 1890 had lived four hundred
years ago they would (with the exception, perhaps, of the Spaniards)
have all been burned alive for heresy. Which is literally true.

Within a minute's walk from where I sit and indeed visible from my
window in this town of Homburg vor der Höhe, are two round towers of
other days—grim and picturesque relics of the early Middle Ages. One is
called the *Hexenthurm* or Witches' Tower. In it gypsies, witches, and
heretics were confined—it was the hotel specially reserved for them when
they visited Homburg, and in its cells which are of the smallest between
walls of the thickest, I or you, reader, Might be confined to-day, but
for one MARTIN LUTHER and certain laws of evolution or progress of which
Paulus Grillandus did not dream.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

As I was sketching the tower, an old woman told me that there were many
strange tales about it. That I can well believe but I dare

say they are all summed up in the following ballad from the German of
HEINE

"THE WITCH."

"FOLKS said when my granny Eliza bewitched,  
    She must die for her horrid transgression;  
Much ink from his pen the old magistrate pitched,  
    But he could not extort a confession.

And when in the kettle my granny was thrown  
    She yelled 'Death' and 'Murder!' while dying.  
And when the black smoke all around us was blown.  
    As a raven she rose and went flying.

Little black grandmother, feathered so well,  
    Oh, come to the tower where I'm sitting  
Bring cakes and bring cheese to me here in the cell,  
    Through the iron-barred window flitting.

Little black grandmother, feathered and wise,  
    Just give my aunt a warning,  
Lest she should come flying and pick out my eyes  
    When I merrily swing in the morning."

HORST in his "Dæmonomagie," a History of the Belief in Magic, Demoniac
marvels, Witchcraft, &c., gives the picture of a Witch-tower, at
Lindheim in the Wetterau, with all its terrible history, extracted from
the town archives. It is a horrible history of torturing and burning at
the stake of innumerable women of all ages, the predominant feature

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

being that any accusation by anybody whatever, or any rumour set afloat
in any way, amply sufficed to bring an enemy to death, or to rob a
person who had money. Hysterical women and perverse or eccentric
children frequently originated these accusations merely to bring
themselves into notice.

There was till within a few years a Witches' Tower in Heidelberg. It was
a very picturesque structure in an out-of-the-way part of the town, in
nobody's way, and was therefore of course pulled down by the good
Philistine citizens, who have the same mania in Heidelberg as "their
ignorant-like" in London, Philadelphia, or any other town, for removing
all relics of the olden time.

In connection with sorcery and gypsies, it is worth observing that ill
1834 the latter, in Swabia, or South Germany, frequently went about
among the country-people, with puppet-shows, very much of the Punch
kind, and that they had a rude drama of Faust, the great wizard, which
had nothing to do with that of Goethe. It was derived from the early
sources, and had been little by little gypsified into a melodrama
peculiar to the performers. August Zoller, in his "Bilder aus Schwaben"
(Stuttgard, 1834), gives the following description of it. The book has a
place in all Faust libraries, and has been kept alive by this single
passage:—

"There is a blast of a trumpet, and the voice of a man proclaims behind
the scenes that the play is to begin. The curtain is drawn, and Faust
leaning against the background—which represents a city-soliloquizes!

"'I am the cleverest doctor in the world, but all my cleverness does not
help me to make the beautiful princess love me, I will call up Saran
front the under-world to aid me in my plans to win her. Devil—I call
thee!'

"Meanwhile Faust's servant—the funny man—has entered and amused the
public with comical gestures. The appearance of the devil is announced
by a firework (Sprühteufel) fizzing and cracking. He descends from the
air, there being no arrangements for his coming up. The servant bursts
into a peal of laughter, and the devil asks:

"'Faust thou hast called me; now, what is thy wish?'

"'I love the lovely princess—canst thou make her love me?'

"'Nothing is easier. Cut thy finger and sign to me thy life; then all my
devilish art will be at thy service till thou hast committed four
murders.'

"Faust and the devil fly forth, the servant making sarcastic remarks as
to the folly of his master, and the curtain falls.

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

"In the second act the fair princess enters—she is three times as large
as Faust, but bewails his absence in a plaintive voice and departs.
Faust enters and calls for a *Furio* who shall carry him to Mantua.
Enter three *Furios* (witches) who boast their power. 'I can carry you
as swiftly as a moor-cock flies,' says one. This is not swift enough for
Faust. 'I fly as fast as bullet from a gun,' says the second. The master
answers:

"'A right good pace, but not enough for Faust.' To the third: 'How fast
art *thou*?'

"'As quick as Thought.'

"'That will suffice—there's naught so swift as Thought. Bear me to
Mantua, to her I love, the princess of my heart!'

"The Furio takes Faust on her back, and they fly through the air. The
servant makes, as before, critical and sarcastic remarks on what has
passed, and the curtain falls.

"In the third act the devil persuades Faust to murder his father, so as
to inherit his treasures, 'for the old man has a tough life.' In the
fourth, maddened by jealousy, he stabs the Princess and her supposed
lover. The small sarcastic servant takes the murdered pair by the legs,
and drags them about, cracking jokes, and giving the corpses cuff's on
their ears to bring them again to life.

"In the fifth act, the clock strikes eleven. Faust has now filled to the
brim the measure of his iniquity. The devil appears, proves to him that
it is time to depart; it strikes twelve; the smoke of a fizzling squib
and several diabolical fire-crackers fills the air, and Faust is carried
away, while the small servant, as satanical and self-possessed as ever,
makes his jokes on the folly of Faust—and the curtain falls."

This is the true Faust drama of the Middle Ages, with the
ante-Shakespearian blending of tragedy and ribald fun. But this same
mixture is found to perfection in the early Indian drama—for instance,
in "Sakuntala"—and it would be indeed a very curious thing should it be
discovered that the gypsies, who were in all ages small actors and
showmen of small plays, had brought from the East some rude drama of a
sorcerer, who is in the end cheated by his fiend. Such is, in a measure,
the plot of the *Baital Pachisi* or *Vikram and the Vampire*, which is
borrowed from or founded on old traditions, and the gypsies, from their
familiarity with magic, and as practical actors, would, in all
probability, have a Faust play of some kind, according to the laws of
cause and effect. In any case the suggestion may be of value to some
investigator.

Gypsies in England—that is those "of the old sort"—regard a shoestring
as a kind of amulet or protection. Many think it is unlucky to

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

have one's [photograph](errata.htm#5.md) taken but no harm can come of it
if the one who receives the picture gives the subject a shoe-string or a
pair of laces.

Dr. F. S. KRAUSS in his curious work, "Sreća, or Fortune and Fate in the
popular belief of the South Slavonians" (Vienna, 1886), draws a line of
distinction between the fetish and amulet. "The fetish," he declares,
"has virtue from being the dwelling of a protecting spirit. The amulet,
however, is only a symbol of a higher power," that is of a power whose
attention is drawn by or through it to the believer or wearer. This,
however, like the distinction between idolatry and worshipping images as
symbols of higher beings, becomes in the minds of the multitude (and for
that matter, in all minds), a distinction without a dot of difference.
The amulet may "rest upon a higher range of ideas, while the fetish
stands on its own feet," but if both are regarded as *bringing luck*,
and if, for instance, one rosary or image of the same person is believed
to bring more luck than another, it is a fetish and nothing else. An
amulet may pretend to be a genteeler kind of fetish, but they are all of
the same family.

The gypsies prepare among the Bosniacs, "on the high plains of Malwan,"
a fetish in the form of a cradle made of nine kinds of wood, to bring
luck to the child who sleeps in it. But Dr. KRAUSS falls, I presume,
into a very great error, when he attributes to her Majesty the Queen of
England a belief in fetish, on the strength of the following remarkable
pas sage from the *Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung*:—

"By command of Queen VICTORIA, Mr. MARTIN, Director of the Institute for
the Blind, has attended to the making a cradle for the newly-born child
of the Princess of Battenberg. The cradle is to be made entirely by
blind men and women. The Queen firmly believes that objects made by
blind people bring luck."

Truly, if anything could bring luck it ought to be something ordered
with a kind and charitable view from poor and suffering people, but it
is rather hard to promptly conclude that her Majesty believes in fetish
because she benevolently ordered a cradle from the blind, and that she
had no

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

higher motive than to get something which would bring luck to her
grandchild.

It may be observed in connection with this superstition that among the
Hungarian gypsies several spells depend on using different kinds of
wood, and that four are said to have been taken for the true cross.

Gypsies, in common with the rest of the "fetishioners" of all the world,
believe in the virtue of a child's caul. Dr. KRAUSS found in Kobaš on
the Save an amulet which contained such a caul with garlic and
four-leaved clover. This must have been a very strong charm indeed,
particularly if the garlic was fresh.

Another very great magic protector in every country among gypsies as
well as Gentiles, is the thunderbolt, known in Germany as the
*Donneraxt*, *Donnerstein*, *Donnerkeil*, *Albschoss*, *Strahlstein*,
and *Teufelsfinger*. It was called by the Greeks *Astropelákia*, by the
Latins *Gemma cerauniæ*, by the Spaniards *Piedras de rayo*, by the
dwellers in the French High Alps *Peyras del tron* (*pierres de
tonerre*), by the Birmans *Mogio* (the child of lightning), by the
Chinese *Ra-fu-seki* (the battle-axe of Tengu, the guardian of Heaven),
by the Hindoos *Swayamphu*, or "the self-originated." Dr. KRAUSS, from
whom I have taken these remarks, adds that in America and Australia it
is also regarded as a charm protective and luck-bringing. But here there
is a confusion of objects. The thunderbolt described by Dr. KRAUSS is, I
believe, a petrified shell, a kind of *mucro* or belemnite. The
thunderbolt of the Red Indians really resembles it, but is entirely
different in its nature. The latter results from lightning entering the
sand fusing it. It sometimes makes in this way a very long tube or rod,
with a point. People, finding these, naturally believed that they were
thunderbolts. I knew an old Penobscot Indian who, seeing the lightning
strike the earth, searched and found such a thunderbolt, which he
greatly prized. In process of time people who found *mucrones* in rocks
believed them to be the same as the glass-like points of fused sand
which they so much resembled.

The so-called thunderbolt is confused with the prehistoric stone axe,

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

both bearing the same name in many lands. As this axe is often also a
hammer it is evident that it may have been sacred to Thor. "The South
Slavonian"—or gypsy—"does not distinguish," says Dr. KRAUSS, "between
the thunderbolt and prehistoric axe. He calls both *strelica*. The
possession of one brings luck and prosperity in all business, but it
must be constantly carried on the person. Among the "thirties" there
lived in Gaj in Slavonia a poor Jewish peddler named DAVID. Once he
found a *strelica*. He always carried it about with him. The peasants
envied him greatly its possession. They came to him in the market-place
and cried, "*Al si sretan, Davide*!" ("Ha, how lucky thou art, David!")
The Slavonian Jews called him, for a joke, "*Strelica*."

The prehistoric axe was probably regarded as gifted with fetish power,
even in the earliest age, especially when it was made of certain rare
materials. Thus among the Red Indians of Massachusetts stone "tomahawks"
of veined, petrified wood were specially consecrated to burial-places,
while in Europe axe-heads of jade were the most coveted of possessions.
A. B. MEYER has written a large work, "Jade und Nephrit Objecte aus dem
Ethriographische Museum zu Dresden, America und Europe" (Leipzig, 1882).
It has always been supposed that the objects of true jade came only from
Tartary, and I believe that I was the first person to discover that it
existed in quantities in Western Europe. The history of this "finding"
is not without interest.

It has been usual—it is said for a thousand years—for pilgrims to Iona
to bring away with them as souvenirs a few green pebbles of a peculiar
kind, and to this day, as every tourist will remember, the children who
come to the steamboat offer handsful of them for sale. When I was there
many years ago—in Iona—I also went away with perhaps twenty of them. One
evening, after returning to London, there were at my home three Chinese
gentlemen attached to the Legation. The conversation turned on Buddhist
pilgrimages and Fusang, and the question, founded on passages in the
Chinese annals, as to whether certain monks had really passed from the
Celestial Kingdom to Mexico in the fifth century and returned. This

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

reminded me of Iona, and I produced my green pebbles, and told what I
knew about them.

My visitors regarded the stones with great interest and held an animated
conversation over them in Chinese, which I did not understand. Observing
this I made them presents of the pebbles, and was thanked with an
earnestness which seemed to me to be out of all proportion to the value
of the gifts. Thinking this over the next day, I wrote to the clergyman
at Iona asking him to be so kind as to send me some of the pebbles, and
offering to pay for them. He did so, sending me by mail a box of the
stones. Two or three were very pretty, one especially. It is of a dark
green colour and slightly transparent.

Two years after, when in Philadelphia, meeting with an old friend, Dr.
JOSEPH LEIDY, well known as a man of science, and, *inter alia*, as a
mineralogist. I showed him my pebble and asked him what it was. He
replied, "It is jade." To my query whether it might not be nephrite he
answered no, that it was true jade of fine quality.

Jade is in China a talismanic stone, many occult virtues and
luck-bringing qualities being ascribed to it. It is very curious, and
possibly something more than a mere chance coincidence, that the green
pebbles of Iona were also carried as charms. It would be remarkable if
even in prehistoric times, or in the stone age, Iona and Tartary had
been connected by superstition and tradition.

Among the gypsies as well as Christians in Servia, *nuts*, especially
those which are heart-shaped (*i.e.*, double), are carried as fetishes
or amulets. In very early times a nut, as containing like a seed the
principle of germination and self-reproduction, was typical of life.
Being enclosed in a shell it seemed to be in a casket or box which was
of itself a mystical symbol. Hence nuts are often found in ancient
graves. There are many stories accordingly in all countries in which a
nut or egg is represented as being connected with the life of some
particular being or person. The ogre in several tales can live until a
certain egg is broken. In the Graubunden or Grisons there is the
following legend:—

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

"Once there lived near *Fideriseau* a rich peasant. To him came a poor
beggar, who asked for alms in vain. Then the man replied, 'If thou wilt
give me nothing yet will I give thee something. Thou shalt keep thy
treasure and also thy daughter after thee; yea, and for years after she
is dead her spirit shall know no rest for taking care of it. But I give
thee this nut. Plant it by yonder great stone, thou stony-hearted fool.
From the nut will grow a tree, and from the tree twigs from which a
cradle will be made in which a child will be rocked who will redeem thy
daughter from her penance.' And after the girl died, a spirit of a pale
woman with dark hair was seen flying nightly near Fideris, and that for
many years, for it takes a long time for an acorn to grow up into an
oak. But as she is no longer seen it is believed that the cradle has
been made and the child born who became the deliverer."

A. B. Elysseeff, in his very interesting article based on Kounavine's
"Materials for the Study of the Gypsies," gives the representation of
four gypsy amulets, also "a cabalistic token" that brings good luck to
its wearer.

"The amulets," writes M. Elysseeff, "are made of wrought iron and belong
to M. Kounavine. The cabalistic sign is designed" (copied?) "by
ourselves, thanks to the amiability of a gypsy *djecmas* (sorcerer) of
the province of Novogorod. The amulet A was found by M. Kounavine among
the gypsies who roam with their camps in the Ural neighbourhood; some
Bessarabian gypsies supplied B; C was obtained from a gypsy sorcerer of
the Persian frontier, and D formed a part of some ornaments placed with
their dead by gypsies of Southern Russia.

"The cabalistic sign" (*vide* illustration at head of chapter)
"represents roughly a serpent, the symbol of Auromori, the evil
principle in gypsy mythology. The figure of an arch surrounded with
stars is, according to M. Kounavine, held by the gypsies as symbolizing
the earth, the meaning of the triangle A is not known. The moon and
stars which surround the earth and which are, so to speak, enclosed in
the serpent's coils, symbolize the world lying in evil. This sign is
engraved by gypsies upon the plates of the harness of the horses, of
garments, and as designed ornaments."

It may be here remarked that the symbolism of M. Kounavine, while it may
be quite accurate, must be taken with great reserve. If the "arch" he
simply a horse-shoe, all these ornaments, except the serpent, may be
commonly found on the trappings of London dray-horses.

"Amulet A, which also represents the sun, the moon, the stars, earth,
and a serpent, can equally serve as a symbol of the universe. According
to M. Kounavine, Ononi" (the Ammon of the Egyptians) "and Auromori, are
symbolized upon this amulet. Amulet B represents a man surrounded by a
halo, aided by the moon and the stars, and armed with a sword and

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

arrows. Beneath is represented the horse; the serpent symbolizes
Auromori. As a whole this amulet represents the conflict between the
good and evil principle, Jandra (Indra) against Auromori.

"Amulet C represents a gleaming star and the serpent, and is called
Baramy (Brama), symbolizing, according to M. Kounavine, the gypsy
proto-divinity.

"Or amulet D, which represents a flaming pyre and some hieroglyphics,
may also symbolize the prayer addressed to the divinity of the fire."

If these explanations were given by gypsy sorcerers the amulets are
indeed very curious. But, abstractly, the serpent, arrows, stars, the
moon, an archer, a fox, and a plant, occur, all the world over., on
coins or in popular art, with or without symbolism, and I confess that I
should have expected something very different as illustrating such a
remarkable mythology as that given by M. Kounavine. However, the art of
a nation—as, for instance, that of the Algonkin, Indians—may be very far
indeed behind its myths and mental conceptions.
