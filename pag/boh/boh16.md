# CHAPTER XIV

### MORE HALLOWTIDE BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS

ONLY the Celts and the Teutonics celebrate an occasion actually like our
Hallowe'en. The countries of southern Europe make of it a religious
vigil, like that already described in France.

In Italy on the night of All Souls', the spirits of the dead are thought
to be abroad, as in Brittany. They may mingle with living people, and
not be remarked. The Miserere is heard in all the cities. As the people
pass dressed in black, bells are rung on street corners to remind them
to pray for the souls of the dead. In Naples the skeletons in the
funeral vaults are dressed up, and the place visited on All Souls' Day.
In Salerno before the people go to the all-night services at church they
set out a banquet for the dead. If any food is left in the morning, evil
is in store for the house.

"Hark! Hark to the wind! 'T is the night, they say,  
When all souls come back from the far away--  
The dead, forgotten this many a day!

"And the dead remembered--ay! long and well--  
And the little children whose spirits dwell  
In God's green garden of asphodel.

"Have you reached the country of all content,  
O souls we know, since the day you went  
From this time-worn world, where your years were spent?

"Would you come back to the sun and the rain,  
The sweetness, the strife, the thing we call pain,  
And then unravel life's tangle again?

"I lean to the dark--Hush!--was it a sigh?  
Or the painted vine-leaves that rustled by?  
Or only a night-bird's echoing cry?"

--SHEARD: Hallowe'en.

In Malta bells are rung, prayers said, and mourning worn on All Souls'
Day. Graves are decorated, and the inscriptions on tombs read and
reread. For the poor is prepared an All Souls' dinner, as cakes are
given to the poor in England and Wales. The custom of decorating graves
with flowers and offering flowers to the dead comes from the crowning of
the dead by the ancients with short-lived blooms, to signify the brevity
of life.

In Spain at dark on Hallowe'en cakes and nuts are laid on graves to
bribe the spirits not to disturb the vigils of the saints.

In Germany the graves of the dead are decorated with flowers and lights,
on the first and second of November. To drive away ghosts from a church
a key or a wand must be struck three times against a bier. An All Souls'
divination in Germany is a girl's going out and asking the first young
man she meets his name. Her husband's will be like it. If she walks
thrice about a church and makes a wish, she will see it fulfilled.

Belgian children build shrines in front of their homes with figures of
the Madonna and candles, and beg for money to buy cakes. As many cakes
as one eats, so many souls he frees from Purgatory.

The races of northern Europe believed that the dead returned, and were
grieved at the lamentations of their living relatives. The same belief
was found in Brittany, and among the American Indians.

"Think of this, O Hiawatha!  
Speak of it to all the people,  
That henceforward and forever  
They no more with lamentations  
Sadden souls of the departed  
In the Islands of the Blessed!"

--LONGFELLOW: Hiawatha.

The Chinese fear the dead and the dragons of the air. They devote the
first three weeks in April to visiting the graves of their ancestors,
and laying baskets of offerings on them. The great dragon, Feng-Shin,
flies scattering blessings upon the houses. His path is straight, unless
he meets with some building. Then he turns aside, and the owner of the
too lofty edifice misses the blessing.

At Nikko, Japan, where there are many shrines to the spirits of the
dead, masques are held to entertain the ghosts who return on Midsummer
Day. Every street is lined with lighted lanterns, and the spirits are
sent back to the otherworld in straw boats lit with lanterns, and
floated down the river. To see ghosts in Japan one must put one hundred
rush-lights into a large lantern, and repeat one hundred lines of
poetry, taking one light out at the end of each line; or go out into the
dark with one light and blow it out. Ghosts are identified with witches.
They come back especially on moonlit nights.

"On moonlight nights, when the coast-wind  
whispers in the branches of the tree, O-Matsue  
and Teoyo may sometimes be seen, with bamboo  
racks in their hands, gathering together the  
needles of the fir."

--RINDER: Great Fir-Tree of Takasago.

There is a Chinese saying that a mirror is the soul of a woman. A pretty
story is told of a girl whose mother before she died gave her a mirror,
saying:

"Now after I am dead, if you think longingly of me, take out the thing
that you will find inside this box, and look at it. When you do so my
spirit will meet yours, and you will be comforted." When she was lonely
or her stepmother was harsh with her, the girl went to her room and
looked earnestly into the mirror. She saw there only her own face, but
it was so much like her mother's that she believed it was hers indeed,
and was consoled. When the stepmother learned what it was her daughter
cherished so closely, her heart softened toward the lonely girl, and her
life was made easier.

By the Arabs spirits were called Djinns (or genii). They came from fire,
and looked like men or beasts. They might be good or evil, beautiful or
horrible, and could disappear from mortal sight at will. Nights when
they were abroad, it behooved men to stay under cover.

"Ha! They are on us, close without!  
Shut tight the shelter where we lie;  
With hideous din the monster rout,  
Dragon and vampire, fill the sky."

--HUGO: The Djinns.
