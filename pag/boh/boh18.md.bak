# FOUR POEMS

### HALLOWE'EN

Bring forth the raisins and the nuts--  
To-night All Hallows' Spectre struts  
Along the moonlit way.  
No time is this for tear or sob,  
Or other woes our joys to rob,  
But time for Pippin and for Bob,  
And Jack-o'-lantern gay.

Come forth, ye lass and trousered kid,  
From prisoned mischief raise the lid,  
And lift it good and high.  
Leave grave old Wisdom in the lurch,  
Set Folly on a lofty perch,  
Nor fear the awesome rod of birch  
When dawn illumes the sky.

'Tis night for revel, set apart  
To reillume the darkened heart,  
And rout the hosts of Dole.  
'Tis night when Goblin, Elf, and Fay,  
Come dancing in their best array  
To prank and royster on the way,  
And ease the troubled soul.

The ghosts of all things, past parade,  
Emerging from the mist and shade  
That hid them from our gaze,  
And full of song and ringing mirth,  
In one glad moment of rebirth,  
Again they walk the ways of earth,  
As in the ancient days.

The beason light shines on the hill,  
The will-o'-wisps the forests fill  
With flashes filched from noon;  
And witches on thier broomsticks spry  
Speed here and yonder in the sky,  
And lift their strident voices high  
Unto the Hunter's moon.

The air resounds with tuneful notes  
From myriads of straining throats,  
All hailing Folly Queen;  
So join the swelling choral throng,  
Forget your sorrow and your wrong,  
In one glad hour of joyous song  
To honor Hallowe'en.

--J.K. BANGS in Harper's Weekly, Nov. 5, 1910.

### HALLOWE'EN FAILURE

Who's dat peekin' in de do'?  
Set mah heart a-beatin'!  
Thought I see' a spook for sho  
On mah way to meetin'.  
Heerd a rustlin' all aroun',  
Trees all sort o' jiggled;  
An' along de frosty groun'  
Funny shadders wriggled.

Who's dat by de winder-sill?  
Gittin' sort o' skeery;  
Feets is feelin' kind o' chill,  
Eyes is sort o' teary.  
'Most as nervous as a coon  
When de dawgs is barkin',  
Er a widder when some spoon  
Comes along a-sparkin'.

Whass dat creepin' up de road,  
Quiet like a ferret,  
Hoppin' sof'ly as a toad?  
Maybe hit's a sperrit!  
Lordy! hope dey ain't no ghos'  
Come to tell me howdy.  
I ain't got no use for those  
Fantoms damp an' cloudy.

Whass dat standin' by de fence  
Wid its eyes a-yearnin',  
Drivin' out mah common-sense  
Wid its glances burnin'?  
Don't dass skeercely go to bed  
Wid dem spookses roun' me.  
Ain't no res' fo' dis yere head  
When dem folks surroun' me.

Whass dat groanin' soun' I hear  
Off dar by de gyardin?  
Lordy! Lordy! Lordy dear,  
Grant dis sinner pardon!  
I won't nebber--I declar'  
Ef it ain't my Sammy!  
Sambo, what yo' doin' dar?  
Yo' can't skeer yo' mammy!

--CARLYLE SMITH in Harper's Weekly, Oct. 29, 1910.

### HALLOWE'EN

Pixie, kobold, elf, and sprite  
All are on their rounds to-night,--  
In the wan moon's silver ray  
Thrives their helter-skelter play.

Fond of cellar, barn, or stack  
True unto the almanac,  
They present to credulous eyes  
Strange hobgoblin mysteries.

Cabbage-stumps--straws wet with dew--  
Apple-skins, and chestnuts too,  
And a mirror for some lass  
Show what wonders come to pass.

Doors they move, and gates they hide  
Mischiefs that on moonbeams ride  
Are their deeds,--and, by their spells,  
Love records its oracles.

Don't we all, of long ago  
By the ruddy fireplace glow,  
In the kitchen and the hall,  
Those queer, coof-like pranks recall?

Eery shadows were they then--  
But to-night they come again;  
Were we once more but sixteen  
Precious would be Hallowe'en.

--JOEL BENTON in Harper's Weekly, Oct. 31, 1896.

### HALLOWE'EN

A gypsy flame in on the hearth,  
Sign of this carnival of mirth.  
Through the dun fields and from the glade  
Flash merry folk in masquerade--  
It is the witching Hallowe'en.

Pale tapers glimmer in the sky,  
The dead and dying leaves go by;  
Dimly across the faded green  
Strange shadows, stranger shades, are seen,--  
It is the mystic Hallowe'en.

Soft gusts of love and memory  
Beat at the heart reproachfully;  
The lights that burn for those who die  
Were flickering low, let them flare high--  
It is the haunting Hallowe'en.

--A.F. MURRAY in Harper's Weekly, Oct. 30, 1909.
