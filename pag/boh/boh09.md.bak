# CHAPTER VII

### HALLOWE'EN BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS IN IRELAND

IRELAND has a literature of Hallowe'en, or "Samhain," as it used to be
called. Most of it was written between the seventh and the twelfth
centuries, but the events were thought to have happened while paganism
still ruled in Ireland.

The evil powers that came out at Samhain lived the rest of the time in
the cave of Cruachan in Connaught, the province which was given to the
wicked Fomor after the battle of Moytura. This cave was called the
"hell-gate of Ireland," and was unlocked on November Eve to let out
spirits and copper-colored birds which killed the farm animals. They
also stole babies, leaving in their place changelings, goblins who were
old in wickedness while still in the cradle, possessing superhuman
cunning and skill in music. One way of getting rid of these demon
children was to ill-treat them so that their people would come for them,
bringing the right ones back; or one might boil egg-shells in the sight
of the changeling, who would declare his demon nature by saying that in
his centuries of life he had never seen such a thing before.

Brides too were stolen.

"You shall go with me, newly married bride,  
And gaze upon a merrier multitude;  
White-armed Nuala and Aengus of the birds,  
And Feacra of the hurtling foam, and him  
Who is the ruler of the western host,  
Finvarra, and the Land of Heart's Desire,  
Where beauty has no ebb, decay no flood,  
But joy is wisdom, time an endless song."  
--YEATS: Land of Heart's Desire.

In the first century B.C. lived Ailill and his queen Medb. As they were
celebrating their Samhain feast in the palace,

"Three days before Samhain at all times,  
And three days after, by ancient custom  
Did the hosts of high aspiration  
Continue to feast for the whole week."  
--O'CIARAIN: Loch Garman.

they offered a reward to the man who should tie a bundle of twigs about
the feet of a criminal who had been hanged by the gate. It was dangerous
to go near dead bodies on November Eve, but a bold young man named Nera
dared it, and tied the twigs successfully. As he turned to go he saw

"the whole of the palace as if on fire before him, and the heads of the
people of it lying on the ground, and then he thought he saw an army
going into the hill of Cruachan, and he followed after the army."  
--GREGORY: Cuchulain of Muirthemne.

The door was shut. Nera was married to a fairy woman, who betrayed her
kindred by sending Nera to warn King Ailill of the intended attack upon
his palace the next November Eve. Nera bore summer fruits with him to
prove that he had been in the fairy sid. The next November Eve, when the
doors were opened Ailill entered and discovered the crown, emblem of
power, took it away, and plundered the treasury. Nera never returned
again to the homes of men.

Another story of about the same time was that of Angus, the son of a
Tuatha god, to whom in a dream a beautiful maiden appeared. He wasted
away with love for her, and searched the country for a girl who should
look like her. At last he saw in a meadow among a hundred and fifty
maidens, each with a chain of silver about her neck, one who was like
the beauty of his dream. She wore a golden chain about her throat, and
was the daughter of King Ethal Anbual. King Ethal's palace was stormed
by Ailill, and he was forced to give up his daughter. He gave as a
reason for withholding his consent so long, that on Samhain Princess
Caer changed from a maiden to a swan, and back again the next year.

"And when the time came Angus went to the loch, and he saw the three
times fifty white birds there with their silver chains about their
necks, and Angus stood in a man's shape at the edge of the loch, and he
called to the girl:  
'Come and speak with me, O Caer!'  
"'Who is calling me?' said Caer.  
"'Angus calls you,' he said, 'and if you do come, I swear by my word I
will not hinder you from going into the loch again.'"  
--GREGORY: Cuchulain of Muirthemne.

She came, and he changed to a swan likewise, and they flew away to King
Dagda's palace, where every one who heard their sweet singing was
charmed into a sleep of three days and three nights.

Princess Etain, of the race of the Tuatha, and wife of Midir, was born
again as the daughter of Queen Medb, the wife of Ailill. She remembers a
little of the land from which she came, is never quite happy,

"But sometimes--sometimes--tell me; have you heard,  
By dusk or moonset have you ever heard  
Sweet voices, delicate music? Never seen  
The passage of the lordly beautiful ones  
Men call the Shee?"  
--SHARP: Immortal Hour.

even when she wins the love of King Eochaidh. When they have been
married a year, there comes Midir from the Land of Youth. By winning a
game of chess from the King, he gets anything he may ask, and prays to
see the Queen. When he sees her he sings a song of longing to her, and
Eochaidh it troubled because it is Samhain, and he knows the great power
the hosts of the air "have then over those who wish for happiness."

"Etain, speak!  
What is the song the harper sings, what tongue  
Is this he speaks? for in no Gaelic lands  
Is speech like this upon the lips of men.  
No word of all these honey-dripping words  
Is known to me. Beware, beware the words  
Brewed in the moonshine under ancient oaks  
White with pale banners of the mistletoe  
Twined round them in their slow and stately death.  
It is the feast of Saveen" (Samhain).  
--SHARP: Immortal Hour.

In vain Eochaidh pleads with her to stay with him. She had already
forgotten all but Midir and the life so long ago in the Land of Youth.

"In the Land of Youth  
There are pleasant places;  
Green meadows, woods,  
Swift grey-blue waters.

"There is no age there,  
Nor any sorrow.  
As the stars in heaven  
Are the cattle in the valleys.

"Great rivers wander  
Through flowery plains.  
Streams of milk, of mead,  
Streams of strong ale.

"There is no hunger  
And no thirst  
In the Hollow Land,  
In the Land of Youth."

--SHARP: Immortal Hour.

She and Midir fly away in the form of two swans, linked by a chain of
gold.

Cuchulain, hopelessly sick of a strange illness brought on by Fand and
Liban, fairy sisters, was visited the day before Samhain by a messenger,
who promised to cure him if he would go to the Otherworld. Cuchulain
could not make up his mind to go, but sent Laeg, his charioteer. Such
glorious reports did Laeg bring back from the Otherworld,

"If all Erin were mine,  
And the kingship of yellow Bregia,  
I would give it, no trifling deed,  
To dwell for aye in the place I reached."

--Cuchulain's Sick-bed. (Meyer trans.)

that Cuchulain went thither, and championed the people there against
their enemies. He stayed a month with the fairy Fand. Emer, his wife at
home, was beset with jealousy, and plotted against Fand, who had
follower her hero home. Fand in fear returned to her deserted husband,
Emer was given a Druidic drink to drown her jealousy, and Cuchulain
another to forget his infatuation, and they lived happily afterward.

Even after Christianity was made the vital religion in Ireland, it was
believed that places not exorcised by prayers and by the sign of the
cross, were still haunted by Druids. As late as the fifth century the
Druids kept their skill in fortune-telling. King Dathi got a Druid to
foretell what would happen to him from one Hallowe'en to the next, and
the prophecy came true. Their religion was now declared evil, and all
evil or at any rate suspicious beings were assigned to them or to the
devil as followers.

"Maire Bruin:  
Are not they, likewise, the children of God?  
Father Hart:  
Colleen, they are the children of the fiend,  
And they have power until the end of Time,  
When God shall fight with them a great pitched battle  
And hack them into pieces."

--YEATS: Land of Heart's Desire.

The power of fairy music was so great that St. Patrick himself was put
to sleep by a minstrel who appeared to him on the day before Samhain.
The Tuatha De Danann, angered at the renegade people who no longer did
them honor, sent another minstrel, who after laying the ancient
religious seat Tara under a twenty-three years' charm, burned up the
city with his fiery breath.

These infamous spirits dwelt in grassy mounds, called "forts," which
were the entrances to underground palaces full of treasure, where was
always music and dancing. These treasure-houses were open only on
November Eve

""For the fairy mounds of Erinn are always opened about Hallowe'en."

--Expedition of Nera. (Meyer trans.)

when the throngs of spirits, fairies, and goblins trooped out for revels
about the country. The old Druid idea of obsession, the besieging of a
person by an evil spirit, was practised by them at that time.

"This is the first day of the winter, and to-day the  
Hosts of the Air are in their greatest power."

--WARREN: Twig of Thorn.

If the fairies wished to seize a mortal--which power they had as the
sun-god could take men to himself-- they caused him to give them certain
tokens by which he delivered himself into their hands. They might be
milk and fire--

"Maire Bruin:  
A little queer old woman cloaked in green,  
Who came to beg a porringer of milk.  
Bridget Bruin:  
The good people go asking milk and fire  
Upon May Eve--woe to the house that gives,  
For they have power over it for a year."

--YEATS: Land of Heart's Desire.

or one might receive a fairy thorn such as Oonah brings home, which
shrivels up at the touch of St. Bridget's image;

"Oh, ever since I kept the twig of thorn and hid it, I have seen strange
things, and heard strange laughter and far voices calling."

--WARREN: Twig of Thorn.

or one might be lured by music as he stopped near the fort to watch the
dancing, for the revels were held in secret, as those of the Druids had
been, and no one could look on them unaffected.

A story is told of Paddy More, a great stout uncivil churl, and Paddy
Beg, a cheerful little hunchback. The latter, seeing lights and hearing
music, paused by a mound, and was invited in. Urged to tell stories, he
complied; he danced as spryly as he could for his deformity; he sang,
and made himself so agreeable that the fairies decided to take the hump
off his back, and send him home a straight manly fellow. The next
Hallowe'en who should come by the same place but Paddy More, and he
stopped likewise to spy at the merrymaking. He too was called in, but
would not dance politely, added no stories nor songs. The fairies
clapped Paddy Beg's hump on his back, and dismissed him under a double
burden of discomfort.

A lad called Guleesh, listening outside a fort on Hallowe'en heard the
spirits speaking of the fatal illness of his betrothed, the daughter of
the King of France. They said that if Guleesh but knew it, he might boil
an herb that grew by his door and give it to the princess and make her
well. Joyfully Guleesh hastened home, prepared the herb, and cured the
royal girl.

Sometimes people did not have the luck to return, but were led away to a
realm of perpetual youth and music.

"Father Hart. What are you reading?  
Maire Bruin. How a Princess Edane,  
A daughter of a King of Ireland, heard  
A voice singing on a May Eve like this,  
And followed, half awake and half asleep,  
Until she came into the land of faery,  
Where nobody gets old and godly and grave,  
Where nobody gets old and crafty and wise,  
Where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue;  
And she is still there, busied with a dance,  
Deep in the dewy shadow of a wood,  
Or where stars walk upon a mountain-top."

--YEATS: Land of Heart's Desire.

If one returned, he found that the space which seemed to him but one
night, had been many years, and with the touch of earthly sod the age he
had postponed suddenly weighed him down. Ossian, released from fairy
land after three hundred years dalliance there, rode back to his own
country on horseback. He saw men imprisoned under a block of marble and
others trying to lift the stone. As he leaned over to aid them the girth
broke. With the touch of earth "straightway the white horse fled away on
his way home, the Ossian became aged, decrepit, and blind."

No place as much as Ireland has kept the belief in all sorts of
supernatural spirits abroad among its people. From the time when on the
hill of Ward, near Tara, in pre-Christian days, the sacrifices were
burned and the Tuatha were thought to appear on Samhain, to as late as
1910, testimony to actual appearances of the :little people" is to be
found.

"'Among the usually invisible races which I have seen in Ireland, I
distinguished five classes. There are the Gnomes, who are earth-spirits,
and who seem to be a sorrowful race. I once saw some of them distinctly
on the side of Ben Bulbin. They had rather round heads and dark thick-
set bodies, and in stature were about two and one-half feet. The
Leprechauns are different, being full of mischief, though they, too, are
small. I followed a Leprechaun from the town of Wicklow out to the
Carraig Sidhe, "Rock of the Fairies," a distance of half a mile or more,
where he disappeared. He had a very merry face, and beckoned to me with
his finger. A third class are the Little People, who, unlike the Gnomes
and Leprechauns, are quite good-looking; and they are very small. The
Good People are tall, beautiful beings, as tall as ourselves. . . . They
direct the magnetic currents of the earth. The Gods are really the
Tuatha De Danann, and they are much taller than our race.'"

--WENTZ: Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.

The sight of the apparitions on Hallowe'en is believed to be fatal to
the beholder.

"One night my lady's soul walked along the wall like a cat. Long Tom
Bowman beheld her and that day week fell he into the well and was
drowned."

--PYLE: Priest and the Piper.

One version of the Jack-o'-lantern story comes from Ireland. A stingy
man named Jack was for his inhospitality barred from all hope of heaven,
and because of practical jokes on the Devil was locked out of hell.
Until the Judgement Day he is condemned to walk the earth with a lantern
to light his way.

The place of the old lord of the dead, the Tuatha god Saman, to whom
vigil was kept and prayers said on November Eve for the good of departed
souls, was taken in Christian times by St. Colomba or Columb Kill, the
founder of a monastery in Iona in the fifth century. In the seventeenth
century the Irish peasants went about begging money and goodies for a
feast, and demanding in the name of Columb Kill that fatted calved and
black sheep be prepared. In place of the Druid fires, candles were
collected and lighted on Hallowe'en, and prayers for the souls of the
givers said before them. The name of Saman is kept in the title "Oidhche
Shamhna," "vigil of Saman," by which the night of October 31st was until
recently called in Ireland.

There are no Hallowe'en bonfires in Ireland now, but charms and tests
are tried. Apples and nuts, the treasure of Pomona, figure largely in
these. They are representative winter fruits, the commonest. They can be
gathered late and kept all winter.

A popular drink at the Hallowe'en gathering in the eighteenth century
was milk in which crushed roasted apples had been mixed. It was called
Lambs'-wool (perhaps from "La Mas Ubhal," "the day of the apple fruit").
At the Hallowe'en supper "callcannon," mashed potatoes, parsnips, and
chopped onions, is indispensable. A ring is buried in it, and the one
who finds it in his portion will be married in a year, or if he is
already married, will be lucky.

"They had colcannon, and the funniest things were found in it--tiny
dolls, mice, a pig made of china, silver sixpences, a thimble, a ring,
and lots of other things. After supper was over all went into the big
play-room, and dived for apples in a tub of water, fished for prizes in
a basin of flour; then there were games---"

--TRANT: Hallowe'en in Ireland.

A coin betokened to the finder wealth; the thimble, that he would never
marry.

A ring and a nut are baked in a cake. The ring of course means early
marriage, the nut signifies that its finder will marry a widow or
widower. If the kernel is withered, no marriage at all is prophesied. In
Roscommon, in central Ireland, a coin, a sloe, and a bit of wood were
baked in a cake. The one getting the sloe would live longest, the one
getting the wood was destined to die within the year.

A mould of flour turned out on the table held similar tokens. Each
person cut off a slice with a knife, and drew out his prize with his
teeth.

After supper the tests were tried. In the last century nut-shells were
burned. The best-known nut test is made as follows: three nuts are named
for a girl and two sweethearts. If one burns more steadily with the
girl's nut, that love is faithful to her, but if either hers or one of
the other nuts starts away, there will be no happy friendship between
them.

Apples are snapped from the end of a stick hung parallel to the floor by
a twisted cord which whirls the stick rapidly when it is let go. Care
has to be taken not to bite the candle burning on the other end.
Sometimes this test is made easier by dropping the apples into a tub of
water and diving for them, or piercing them with a fork dropped straight
down.

Green herbs called "livelong" were plucked by the children and hung up
on Midsummer Eve. If a plant was found to be still green on Hallowe'en,
the one who had hung it up would prosper for the year, but if it had
turned yellow or had died, the child would also die.

Hemp-seed is sown across three furrows, the sower repeating: "Hemp-seed,
I saw thee, hemp-seed, I saw thee; and her that is to be my true love,
come after me and draw thee." On looking back over his shoulder he will
see the apparition of his future wife in the act of gathering hemp.

Seven cabbage stalks were named for any seven of the company, then
pulled up, and the guests asked to come out, and "see their sowls."

"One, two, three, and up to seven;  
If all are white, all go to heaven;  
If one is black as Murtagh's evil,  
He'll soon be screechin' wi' the devil."

Red Mike "was a queer one from his birth, an' no wonder, for he first
saw the light atween dusk an' dark o' a Hallowe'en Eve." When the
cabbage test was tried at a party where Mike was present, six stalks
were found to be white, but Mike's was "all black an' fowl wi' worms an'
slugs, an' wi' a real bad smell ahint it." Angered at the ridicule he
received, he cried: "I've the gift o' the night, I have, an' on this day
my curse can blast whatever I choose." At that the priest showed Mike a
crucifix, and he ran away howling, and disappeared through a bog into
the ground.

--SHARP: Threefold Chronicle.

Twelve of the party may learn their future, if one gets a clod of earth
from the churchyard, sets up twelve candles in it, lights and names
them. The fortune of each will be like that of the candle-light named
for him,--steady, wavering, or soon in darkness.

A ball of blue yarn was thrown out of the window by a girl who held fast
to the end. She wound it over on her hand from left to right, saying the
Creed backwards. When she had nearly finished, she expected the yarn
would be held. She must ask "Who holds?" and the wind would sigh her
sweetheart's name in at the window.

In some charms the devil was invoked directly. If one walked about a
rick nine times with a rake, saying, "I rake this rick in the devil's
name," a vision would come and take away the rake.

If one went out with nine grains of oats in his mouth, and walked about
until he heard a girl's name called or mentioned, he would know the name
of his future wife, for they would be the same.

Lead is melted, and poured through a key or a ring into cold water. The
form each spoonful takes in cooling indicated the occupation of the
future husband of the girl who poured it.

"Now something like a horse would cause the jubilant maiden to call out,
'A dragoon!' Now some dim resemblance to a helmet would suggest a
handsome member of the mounted police; or a round object with a spike
would seem a ship, and this of course meant a sailor; or a cow would
suggest a cattle-dealer, or a plough a farmer."

--SHARP: Threefold Chronicle.

After the future had been searched, a piper played a jig, to which all
danced merrily with a loud noise to scare away the evil spirits.

Just before midnight was the time to go out "alone and unperceived" to a
south-running brook, dip a shirt-sleeve in it, bring it home and hang it
by the fire to dry. One must go to bed, but watch till midnight for a
sight of the destined mate who would come to turn the shirt to dry the
other side.

Ashes were raked smooth on the hearth at bedtime on Hallowe'en, and the
next morning examined for footprints. If one was turned from the door,
guests or a marriage was prophesied; if towards the door, a death.

To have prophetic dreams a girl should search for a briar grown into a
hoop, creep through thrice in the name of the devil, cut it in silence,
and go to bed with it under her pillow. A boy should cut ten ivy leaves,
throw away one and put the rest under his head before he slept.

If a girl leave beside her bed a glass of water with a sliver of wood in
it, and say before she falls asleep:

"Husband mine that is to be,  
Come this night and rescue me,"

she will dream of falling off a bridge into the water, and of being
saved at the last minute by the spirit of her future husband. To receive
a drink from his hand she must eat a cake of flour, soot, and salt
before she goes to bed.

The Celtic spirit of yearning for the unknown, retained nowhere else as
much as in Ireland, is expressed very beautifully by the poet Yeats in
the introduction to his Celtic Twilight.

"The host is riding from Knocknarea  
And over the grave of Clooth-na-bare;  
Caolte tossing his burning hair,  
And Niam calling: 'away, come away;

"'And brood no more where the fire is bright,  
Filling thy heart with a mortal dream;  
For breasts are heaving and eyes a-gleam;  
Away, come away to the dim twilight

"'Arms are heaving and lips apart;  
And if any gaze on our rushing band,  
We come between him and the deed of his hand,  
We come between him and the hope of his heart.'

"The host is rushing twixt night and day,  
And where is there hope or deed as fair?  
Caolte tossing his burning hair,  
And Niam calling: 'Away, come away.'"
