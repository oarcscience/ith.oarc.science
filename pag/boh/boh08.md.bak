# CHAPTER VI

### ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF HALLOWE'EN OMENS

THE custom of making tests to learn the future comes from the old system
of augury from sacrifice. Who sees in the nuts thrown into the fire,
turning in the heat, blazing and growing black, the writhing victim of
an old-time sacrifice to an idol?

Many superstitions and charms were believed to be active at any time,
but all those and numerous special ones worked best on November Eve. All
the tests of all the Celtic festivals have been allotted to Hallowe'en.
Cakes from the May Eve fire, hemp-seed and prophetic dreams from
Midsummer, games and sports from Lugnasad have survived in varied forms.

Tests are very often tried blindfold, so that the seeker may be guided
by fate. Many are mystic--to evoke apparitions from the past or future.
Others are tried with harvest grains and fruits. Because skill and
undivided attention is needed to carry them through successfully, many
have degenerated into mere contests of skill, have lost their meaning,
and become rough games.

Answers are sought to questions about one's future career; chiefly to:
when and whom shall I marry? what will be my profession and degree of
wealth, and when shall I die?
