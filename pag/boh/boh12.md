# CHAPTER X

### IN WALES

IN Wales the custom of fires persisted from the time of the Druid
festival-days longer than in any other place. First sacrifices were
burned, the creatures merely passed through the fire; and with the rise
of Christianity fire was thought to be a protection against the evil
power of the same gods.

Pontypridd, in South Wales, was the Druid religious center of Wales. It
is still marked by a stone circle and an altar on a hill. In after years
it was believed that the stones were people changed to that form by the
power of a witch.

In North Wales the November Eve fire, which each family built in the
most prominent place near the house, was called Coel Coeth. Into the
dying fire each member of the family threw a white stone marked so that
he could recognize it again. Circling about the fire hand-in-hand they
said their prayers and went to bed. In the morning each searched for his
stone, and if he could not find it, he believed that he would die within
the next twelve months. This is still credited. There is now the custom
also of watching the fires till the last spark dies, and instantly
rushing down the hill, "the devil (or the cutty black sow) take the
hindmost." A Cardiganshire proverb says:

"A cutty \[short-tailed\] black sow  
On every stile,  
Spinning and carding  
Every Allhallows' Eve."

November Eve was called "Nos-Galan-Gaeof," the night of the winter
Calends, that is, the night before the first day of winter. To the Welsh
it was New Year's Eve.

Welsh fairy tradition resembles that in the near-by countries. There is
an old story of a man who lay down to sleep inside a fairy ring, a
circle of greener grass where the fairies danced by night. The fairies
carried him away and kept him seven years, and after he had been rescued
from them he would neither eat nor speak.

In the sea was the Otherworld, a

"Green fairy island reposing  
In sunlight and beauty on ocean's calm breast."  
--PARRY: Welsh Melodies.

This was the abode of the Druids, and hence of all supernatural beings,
who were

"Something betwixt heaven and hell,  
Something that neither stood nor fell."  
--SCOTT: The Monastery.

As in other countries the fairies or pixies are to be met at crossroads,
where happenings, such as funerals, may be witnessed weeks before they
really occur.

At the Hallow Eve supper parsnips and cakes are eaten, and nuts and
apples roasted. A "puzzling jug" holds the ale. In the rim are three
holes that seem merely ornamental. They are connected with the bottom of
the jug by pipes through the handle, and the unwitting toper is well
drenched unless he is clever enough to see that he must stop up two of
the holes, and drink through the third.

Spells are tried in Wales too with apples and nuts. There is dicking and
snapping for apples. Nuts are thrown into the fire, denoting prosperity
if they blaze brightly, misfortune if they pop, or smoulder and turn
black.

"Old Pally threw on a nut. It flickered and then blazed up. Maggee
tossed one into the fire. It smouldered and gave no light."

-MARKS: All-Hallows Honeymoon.

Fate is revealed by the three luggies and the ball of yarn thrown out of
the window: Scotch and Irish charms. The leek takes the place of the
cabbage in Scotland. Since King Cadwallo decorated his soldiers with
leeks for their valor in a battle by a leek-garden, they have been held
in high esteem in Wales. A girl sticks a knife among leeks at
Hallowe'en, and walks backward out of the garden. She returns later to
find that her future husband has picked up the knife and thrown it into
the center of the leek-bed.

Taking two long-stemmed roses, a girl goes to her room in silence. She
twines the stems together, naming one for her sweetheart and the other
for herself, and thinking this rhyme:

"Twine, twine, and intertwine.  
Let his love be wholly mine.  
If his heart be kind and true,  
Deeper grow his rose's hue."

She can see, by watching closely, her lover's rose grow darker.

The sacred ash figures in one charm. The party of young people seek an
even-leaved sprig of ash. The first who finds one calls out "cyniver."
If a boy calls out first, the first girl who finds another perfect shoot
bears the name of the boy's future wife.

Dancing and singing to the music of the harp close the evening.

Instead of leaving stones in the fire to determine who are to die,
people now go to church to be by the light of a candle held in the hand
the spirits of those who will not be alive next Hallowe'en.

On the Eve of All Souls' Day, twenty-four hours after Hallowe'en,
children in eastern Wales go from house to house singing for

"An apple or a pear, a plum or a cherry,  
Or any good thing to make us merry."

It is a time when charity is given freely to the poor. On this night and
the next day, fires are burned, as in England, to light souls through
Purgatory, and prayers are made for a good wheat harvest next year by
the Welsh, who keep the forms of religion very devoutly.
