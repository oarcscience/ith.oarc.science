# CHAPTER XIII

### WALPURGIS NIGHT

WALPURGA was a British nun who went to Germany in the eighth century to
found holy houses. After a pious life she was buried at Eichstatt, where
it is said a healing oil trickled from her rock-tomb. This miracle
reminded men of the fruitful dew which fell from the manes of the
Valkyries' horses, and when one of the days sacred to her came on May
first, the wedding-day of Frau Holda and the sun-god, the people thought
of her as a Valkyrie, and identified her with Holda. As, like a
Valkyrie, she rode armed on her steed, she scattered, like Holda, spring
flowers and fruitful dew upon the fields and vales. When these deities
fell into disrepute, Walpurga too joined the pagan train that swept the
sky on the eve of May first, and met afterwards on mountain-tops to
sacrifice and adore Holda, as the priests had sacrificed for a
prosperous season and a bountiful harvest.

So this night was called Walpurgis Night, when evil beings were abroad,
and with them human worshippers who still guarded the old faith in
secret.

This is very like the occasion of November Eve, which shared with May
first Celtic manifestations of evil. Witches complete the list of
supernatural beings which are out on Hallowe'en. All are to be met at
crossroads, with harm to the beholders. A superstition goes, that if one
wishes to see witches, he must put on his clothes wrong side out, and
creep backward to a crossroads, or wear wild radish, on May Eve.

On Walpurgis Night precaution must be taken against witches who may harm
cattle. The stable doors are locked and sealed with three crosses.
Sprigs of ash, hawthorn, juniper, and elder, once sacred to the pagan
gods, are now used as a protection against them.

Horseshoes are nailed prongs up on the threshold or over the door. Holy
bells are hung on the cows to scare away the witches, and they are
guided to pasture by a goad which has been blessed. Shots are fired over
the cornfield. If one wishes, he may hide in the corn and hear what will
happen for a year.

Signs and omens on Walpurgis Night have more weight that at other times
except on St. John's Day.

"On Walpurgis Night rain  
Makes good crops of autumn grain,"

but rain on May Day is harmful to them.

Lovers try omens on this eve, as they do in Scotland on Hallowe'en. If
you sleep with one stocking on, you will find on May morning in the toe
a hair the color of your sweetheart's. Girls try to find out the
temperament of their husbands-to-be by keeping a linen thread for three
days near an image of the Madonna, and at midnight on May Eve pulling it
apart, saying:

"Thread, I pull thee;  
Walpurga, I pray thee,  
That thou show to me  
What my husband's like to be."

They judge of his disposition by the thread's being strong or easily
broken, soft or tightly woven.

Dew on the morning of May first makes girls who wash in it beautiful.

"The fair maid who on the first of May  
Goes to the fields at break of day  
And washes in dew from the hawthorn tree  
Will ever after handsome be."

--Encyclopedia of Superstitions.

A heavy dew on this morning presages a good "butter-year." You will find
fateful initials printed in dew on a handkerchief that has been left out
all the night of April thirtieth.

On May Day girls invoke the cuckoo:

"Cuckoo! cuckoo! on the bough,  
Tell me truly, tell me how  
Many years there will be  
Till a husband comes to me."

Then they count the calls of the cuckoo until he pauses again.

If a man wears clothes made of yarn spun on Walpurgis Night to the
May-shooting, he will always hit the bull's-eye, for the Devil gives
away to those he favors, "freikugeln," bullets which always hit the
mark.

On Walpurgis Night as on Hallowe'en strange things may happen to one.
Zschokke tells a story of a Walpurgis Night dream that is more a vision
than a dream. Led to be unfaithful to his wife, a man murders the
husband of a former sweetheart; to escape capture he fires a haystack,
from which a whole village is kindled. In his flight he enters an empty
carriage, and drives away madly, crushing the owner under the wheels. He
finds that the dead man is his own brother. Faced by the person whom he
believes to be the Devil, responsible for his misfortunes, the wretched
man is ready to worship him if he will protect him. He finds that the
seeming Devil is in reality his guardian-angel who sent him this dream
that he might learn the depths of wickedness lying unfathomed in his
heart, waiting an opportunity to burst out.

Both May Eve and St. John's Eve are times of freedom and unrestraint.
People are filled with a sort of madness which makes them unaccountable
for their deeds.

"For you see, pastor, within every one of us a spark of paganism is
glowing. It has out-lasted the thousand years since the old Teutonic
times. Once a year is flames up high, and we call it St. John's Fire.
Once a year comes Free-night. Yes, truly, Free-night. Then the witches,
laughing scornfully, ride to Blocksberg, upon the mountain-top, on their
broomsticks, the same broomsticks with which at other times their
witchcraft is whipped out of them,--then the whole wild company skims
along the forest way,--and then the wild desires awaken in our hearts
which life has not fulfilled."

--SUDERMANN: St. John's Fire. (Porter trans.)
