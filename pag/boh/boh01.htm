<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PREFACE</H1>
<P>THIS book is intended to give the reader an account of the origin and history of Hallowe'en, how it absorbed some customs belonging to other days in the year,--such as May Day, Midsummer, and Christmas. The context is illustrated by selections from ancient and modern poetry and prose, related to Hallowe'en ideas.</P>
<P>Those who wish suggestions for reading, recitations, plays, and parties, will find the lists in the appendix useful, in addition to the books on entertainments and games to be found in any public library.</P>
<P>Special acknowledgment is made to Messrs. E.P. Dutton and Company for permission to use the poem entitled "Hallowe'en" from "The Spires of Oxford and Other Poems," by W. M. Letts; to Messrs. Longmans, Green and Company for the poem "Pomona," by William Morris; and to the Editors of The Independent for the use of five poems.</P>
