# Chapter 19. Tabooed Acts.

## Section 3. Taboos on Showing the Face.

IN SOME of the preceding cases the intention of eating and drinking in
strict seclusion may perhaps be to hinder evil influences from entering
the body rather than to prevent the escape of the soul. This certainly
is the motive of some drinking customs observed by natives of the Congo
region. Thus we are told of these people that “there is hardly a native
who would dare to swallow a liquid without first conjuring the spirits.
One of them rings a bell all the time he is drinking; another crouches
down and places his left hand on the earth; another veils his head;
another puts a stalk of grass or a leaf in his hair, or marks his
forehead with a line of clay. This fetish custom assumes very varied
forms. To explain them, the black is satisfied to say that they are an
energetic mode of conjuring spirits.” In this part of the world a chief
will commonly ring a bell at each draught of beer which he swallows, and
at the same moment a lad stationed in front of him brandishes a spear
“to keep at bay the spirits which might try to sneak into the old
chief’s body by the same road as the beer.” The same motive of warding
off evil spirits probably explains the custom observed by some African
sultans of veiling their faces. The Sultan of Darfur wraps up his face
with a piece of white muslin, which goes round his head several times,
covering his mouth and nose first, and then his forehead, so that only
his eyes are visible. The same custom of veiling the face as a mark of
sovereignty is said to be observed in other parts of Central Africa. The
Sultan of Wadai always speaks from behind a curtain; no one sees his
face except his intimates and a few favoured persons.   1
