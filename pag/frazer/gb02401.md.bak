# Chapter 24. The Killing of the Divine King.

## Section 1. The Mortality of the Gods.

MAN has created gods in his own likeness and being himself mortal he has
naturally supposed his creatures to be in the same sad predicament. Thus
the Greenlanders believed that a wind could kill their most powerful
god, and that he would certainly die if he touched a dog. When they
heard of the Christian God, they kept asking if he never died, and being
informed that he did not, they were much surprised, and said that he
must be a very great god indeed. In answer to the enquiries of Colonel
Dodge, a North American Indian stated that the world was made by the
Great Spirit. Being asked which Great Spirit he meant, the good one or
the bad one, “Oh, neither of them,” replied he, “the Great Spirit that
made the world is dead long ago. He could not possibly have lived as
long as this.” A tribe in the Philippine Islands told the Spanish
conquerors that the grave of the Creator was upon the top of Mount
Cabunian. Heitsi-eibib, a god or divine hero of the Hottentots, died
several times and came to life again. His graves are generally to be met
with in narrow defiles between mountains. When the Hottentots pass one
of them, they throw a stone on it for good luck, sometimes muttering,
“Give us plenty of cattle.” The grave of Zeus, the great god of Greece,
was shown to visitors in Crete as late as about the beginning of our
era. The body of Dionysus was buried at Delphi beside the golden statue
of Apollo, and his tomb bore the inscription, “Here lies Dionysus dead,
the son of Semele.” According to one account, Apollo himself was buried
at Delphi; for Pythagoras is said to have carved an inscription on his
tomb, setting forth how the god had been killed by the python and buried
under the tripod.   1

  The great gods of Egypt themselves were not exempt from the common
lot. They too grew old and died. But when at a later time the discovery
of the art of embalming gave a new lease of life to the souls of the
dead by preserving their bodies for an indefinite time from corruption,
the deities were permitted to share the benefit of an invention which
held out to gods as well as to men a reasonable hope of immortality.
Every province then had the tomb and mummy of its dead god. The mummy of
Osiris was to be seen at Mendes; Thinis boasted of the mummy of Anhouri;
and Heliopolis rejoiced in the possession of that of Toumou. The high
gods of Babylon also, though they appeared to their worshippers only in
dreams and visions, were conceived to be human in their bodily shape,
human in their passions, and human in their fate; for like men they were
born into the world, and like men they loved and fought and died.   2
