# Chapter 21. Tabooed Things.

## Section 5. The Head tabooed.

MANY peoples regard the head as peculiarly sacred; the special sanctity
attributed to it is sometimes explained by a belief that it contains a
spirit which is very sensitive to injury or disrespect. Thus the Yorubas
hold that every man has three spiritual inmates, of whom the first,
called Olori, dwells in the head and is the man’s protector, guardian,
and guide. Offerings are made to this spirit, chiefly of fowls, and some
of the blood mixed with palmoil is rubbed on the forehead. The Karens
suppose that a being called the tso resides in the upper part of the
head, and while it retains its seat no harm can befall the person from
the efforts of the seven Kelahs, or personified passions. “But if the
tso becomes heedless or weak certain evil to the person is the result.
Hence the head is carefully attended to, and all possible pains are
taken to provide such dress and attire as will be pleasing to the tso.”
The Siamese think that a spirit called khuan or kwun dwells in the human
head, of which it is the guardian spirit. The spirit must be carefully
protected from injury of every kind; hence the act of shaving or cutting
the hair is accompanied with many ceremonies. The kwun is very sensitive
on points of honour, and would feel mortally insulted if the head in
which he resides were touched by the hand of a stranger. The Cambodians
esteem it a grave offence to touch a man’s head; some of them will not
enter a place where anything whatever is suspended over their heads; and
the meanest Cambodian would never consent to live under an inhabited
room. Hence the houses are built of one story only; and even the
Government respects the prejudice by never placing a prisoner in the
stocks under the floor of a house, though the houses are raised high
above the ground. The same superstition exists amongst the Malays; for
an early traveller reports that in Java people “wear nothing on their
heads, and say that nothing must be on their heads … and if any person
were to put his hand upon their head they would kill him; and they do
not build houses with storeys, in order that they may not walk over each
other’s heads.”   1

  The same superstition as to the head is found in full force throughout
Polynesia. Thus of Gattanewa, a Marquesan chief, it is said that “to
touch the top of his head, or anything which had been on his head, was
sacrilege. To pass over his head was an indignity never to be
forgotten.” The son of a Marquesan high priest has been seen to roll on
the ground in an agony of rage and despair, begging for death, because
some one had desecrated his head and deprived him of his divinity by
sprinkling a few drops of water on his hair. But it was not the
Marquesan chiefs only whose heads were sacred. The head of every
Marquesan was taboo, and might neither be touched nor stepped over by
another; even a father might not step over the head of his sleeping
child; women were forbidden to carry or touch anything that had been in
contact with, or had merely hung over, the head of their husband or
father. No one was allowed to be over the head of the king of Tonga. In
Tahiti any one who stood over the king or queen, or passed his hand over
their heads, might be put to death. Until certain rites were performed
over it, a Tahitian infant was especially taboo; whatever touched the
child’s head, while it was in this state, became sacred and was
deposited in a consecrated place railed in for the purpose at the
child’s house. If a branch of a tree touched the child’s head, the tree
was cut down; and if in its fall it injured another tree so as to
penetrate the bark, that tree also was cut down as unclean and unfit for
use. After the rites were performed these special taboos ceased; but the
head of a Tahitian was always sacred, he never carried anything on it,
and to touch it was an offence. So sacred was the head of a Maori chief
that “if he only touched it with his fingers, he was obliged immediately
to apply them to his nose, and snuff up the sanctity which they had
acquired by the touch, and thus restore it to the part from whence it
was taken.” On account of the sacredness of his head a Maori chief
“could not blow the fire with his mouth, for the breath being sacred,
communicated his sanctity to it, and a brand might be taken by a slave,
or a man of another tribe, or the fire might be used for other purposes,
such as cooking, and so cause his death.”   2
