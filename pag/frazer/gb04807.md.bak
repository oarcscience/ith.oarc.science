# Chapter 48. The Corn-Spirit as an Animal.

## Section 7. The Corn-spirit as a Bull, Cow, or Ox.

ANOTHER form which the corn-spirit often assumes is that of a bull, cow,
or ox. When the wind sweeps over the corn they say at Conitz, in West
Prussia, “The Steer is running in the corn”; when the corn is thick and
strong in one spot, they say in some parts of East Prussia, “The Bull is
lying in the corn.” When a harvester has overstrained and lamed himself,
they say in the Graudenz district of West Prussia, “The Bull pushed
him”; in Lorraine they say, “He has the Bull.” The meaning of both
expressions is that he has unwittingly lighted upon the divine
corn-spirit, who has punished the profane intruder with lameness. So
near Chambéry when a reaper wounds himself with his sickle, it is said
that he has “the wound of the Ox.” In the district of Bunzlau (Silesia)
the last sheaf is sometimes made into the shape of a horned ox, stuffed
with tow and wrapt in corn-ears. This figure is called the Old Man. In
some parts of Bohemia the last sheaf is made up in human form and called
the Buffalo-bull. These cases show a confusion of the human with the
animal shape of the corn-spirit. The confusion is like that of killing a
wether under the name of a wolf. All over Swabia the last bundle of corn
on the field is called the Cow; the man who cuts the last ears “has the
Cow,” and is himself called Cow or Barley-cow or Oats-cow, according to
the crop; at the harvest-supper he gets a nosegay of flowers and
corn-ears and a more liberal allowance of drink than the rest. But he is
teased and laughed at; so no one likes to be the Cow. The Cow was
sometimes represented by the figure of a woman made out of ears of corn
and corn-flowers. It was carried to the farmhouse by the man who had cut
the last handful of corn. The children ran after him and the neighbours
turned out to laugh at him, till the farmer took the Cow from him. Here
again the confusion between the human and the animal form of the
corn-spirit is apparent. In various parts of Switzerland the reaper who
cuts the last ears of corn is called Wheat-cow, Corn-cow, Oats-cow, or
Corn-steer, and is the butt of many a joke. On the other hand, in the
district of Rosenheim, Upper Bavaria, when a farmer is later of getting
in his harvest than his neighbours, they set up on his land a
Straw-bull, as it is called. This is a gigantic figure of a bull made of
stubble on a framework of wood and adorned with flowers and leaves.
Attached to it is a label on which are scrawled doggerel verses in
ridicule of the man on whose land the Straw-bull is set up.   1

  Again, the corn-spirit in the form of a bull or ox is killed on the
harvest-field at the close of the reaping. At Pouilly, near Dijon, when
the last ears of corn are about to be cut, an ox adorned with ribbons,
flowers, and ears of corn is led all round the field, followed by the
whole troop of reapers dancing. Then a man disguised as the Devil cuts
the last ears of corn and immediately slaughters the ox. Part of the
flesh of the animal is eaten at the harvest-supper; part is pickled and
kept till the first day of sowing in spring. At Pont à Mousson and
elsewhere on the evening of the last day of reaping, a calf adorned with
flowers and ears of corn is led thrice round the farmyard, being allured
by a bait or driven by men with sticks, or conducted by the farmer’s
wife with a rope. The calf chosen for this ceremony is the calf which
was born first on the farm in the spring of the year. It is followed by
all the reapers with their tools. Then it is allowed to run free; the
reapers chase it, and whoever catches it is called King of the Calf.
Lastly, it is solemnly killed; at Lunéville the man who acts as butcher
is the Jewish merchant of the village.   2

  Sometimes again the corn-spirit hides himself amongst the cut corn in
the barn to reappear in bull or cow form at threshing. Thus at
Wurmlingen, in Thüringen, the man who gives the last stroke at threshing
is called the Cow, or rather the Barley-cow, Oats-cow, Peas-cow, or the
like, according to the crop. He is entirely enveloped in straw; his head
is surmounted by sticks in imitation of horns, and two lads lead him by
ropes to the well to drink. On the way thither he must low like a cow,
and for a long time afterwards he goes by the name of the Cow. At
Obermedlingen, in Swabia, when the threshing draws near an end, each man
is careful to avoid giving the last stroke. He who does give it “gets
the Cow,” which is a straw figure dressed in an old ragged petticoat,
hood, and stockings. It is tied on his back with a straw-rope; his face
is blackened, and being bound with straw-ropes to a wheelbarrow he is
wheeled round the village. Here, again, we meet with that confusion
between the human and animal shape of the corn-spirit which we have
noted in other customs. In Canton Schaffhausen the man who threshes the
last corn is called the Cow; in Canton Thurgau, the Corn-bull; in Canton
Zurich, the Thresher-cow. In the last-mentioned district he is wrapt in
straw and bound to one of the trees in the orchard. At Arad, in Hungary,
the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is enveloped in straw and
a cow’s hide with the horns attached to it. At Pessnitz, in the district
of Dresden, the man who gives the last stroke with the flail is called
Bull. He must make a straw-man and set it up before a neighbour’s
window. Here, apparently, as in so many cases, the corn-spirit is passed
on to a neighbour who has not finished threshing. So at Herbrechtingen,
in Thüringen, the effigy of a ragged old woman is flung into the barn of
the farmer who is last with his threshing. The man who throws it in
cries, “There is the Cow for you.” If the threshers catch him they
detain him over night and punish him by keeping him from the
harvest-supper. In these latter customs the confusion between the human
and the animal shape of the corn-spirit meets us again.   3

  Further, the corn-spirit in bull form is sometimes believed to be
killed at threshing. At Auxerre, in threshing the last bundle of corn,
they call out twelve times, “We are killing the Bull.” In the
neighbourhood of Bordeaux, where a butcher kills an ox on the field
immediately after the close of the reaping, it is said of the man who
gives the last stroke at threshing that “he has killed the Bull.” At
Chambéry the last sheaf is called the sheaf of the Young Ox, and a race
takes place to it in which all the reapers join. When the last stroke is
given at threshing they say that “the Ox is killed”; and immediately
thereupon a real ox is slaughtered by the reaper who cut the last corn.
The flesh of the ox is eaten by the threshers at supper.   4

  We have seen that sometimes the young corn-spirit, whose task it is to
quicken the corn of the coming year, is believed to be born as a
Corn-baby on the harvest-field. Similarly in Berry the young corn-spirit
is sometimes supposed to be born on the field in calf form; for when a
binder has not rope enough to bind all the corn in sheaves, he puts
aside the wheat that remains over and imitates the lowing of a cow. The
meaning is that “the sheaf has given birth to a calf.” In Puy-de-Dôme
when a binder cannot keep up with the reaper whom he or she follows,
they say “He (or she) is giving birth to the Calf.” In some parts of
Prussia, in similar circumstances, they call out to the woman, “The Bull
is coming,” and imitate the bellowing of a bull. In these cases the
woman is conceived as the Corn-cow or old corn-spirit, while the
supposed calf is the Corn-calf or young corn-spirit. In some parts of
Austria a mythical calf (Muhkälbchen) is believed to be seen amongst the
sprouting corn in spring and to push the children; when the corn waves
in the wind they say, “The Calf is going about.” Clearly, as Mannhardt
observes, this calf of the spring-time is the same animal which is
afterwards believed to be killed at reaping.   5
