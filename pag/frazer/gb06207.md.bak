# Chapter 62. The Fire-Festivals of Europe.

## Section 7. The Midwinter Fires.

IF THE HEATHEN of ancient Europe celebrated, as we have good reason to
believe, the season of Midsummer with a great festival of fire, of which
the traces have survived in many places down to our own time, it is
natural to suppose that they should have observed with similar rites the
corresponding season of Midwinter; for Midsummer and Midwinter, or, in
more technical language, the summer solstice and the winter solstice,
are the two great turningpoints in the sun’s apparent course through the
sky, and from the standpoint of primitive man nothing might seem more
appropriate than to kindle fires on earth at the two moments when the
fire and heat of the great luminary in heaven begin to wane or to
wax.   1

  In modern Christendom the ancient fire-festival of the winter solstice
appears to survive, or to have survived down to recent years, in the old
custom of the Yule log, clog, or block, as it was variously called in
England. The custom was widespread in Europe, but seems to have
flourished especially in England, France, and among the South Slavs; at
least the fullest accounts of the custom come from these quarters. That
the Yule log was only the winter counterpart of the midsummer bonfire,
kindled within doors instead of in the open air on account of the cold
and inclement weather of the season, was pointed out long ago by our
English antiquary John Brand; and the view is supported by the many
quaint superstitions attaching to the Yule log, superstitions which have
no apparent connexion with Christianity but carry their heathen origin
plainly stamped upon them. But while the two solstitial celebrations
were both festivals of fire, the necessity or desirability of holding
the winter celebration within doors lent it the character of a private
or domestic festivity, which contrasts strongly with the publicity of
the summer celebration, at which the people gathered on some open space
or conspicuous height, kindled a huge bonfire in common, and danced and
made merry round it together.   2

  Down to about the middle of the nineteenth century the old rite of the
Yule log was kept up in some parts of Central Germany. Thus in the
valleys of the Sieg and Lahn the Yule log, a heavy block of oak, was
fitted into the floor of the hearth, where, though it glowed under the
fire, it was hardly reduced to ashes within a year. When the new log was
laid next year, the remains of the old one were ground to powder and
strewed over the fields during the Twelve Nights, which was supposed to
promote the growth of the crops. In some villages of Westphalia, the
practice was to withdraw the Yule log (Christbrand) from the fire so
soon as it was slightly charred; it was then kept carefully to be
replaced on the fire whenever a thunderstorm broke, because the people
believed that lightning would not strike a house in which the Yule log
was smouldering. In other villages of Westphalia the old custom was to
tie up the Yule log in the last sheaf cut at harvest.   3

  In several provinces of France, and particularly in Provence, the
custom of the Yule log or tréfoir, as it was called in many places, was
long observed. A French writer of the seventeenth century denounces as
superstitious “the belief that a log called the tréfoir or Christmas
brand, which you put on the fire for the first time on Christmas Eve and
continue to put on the fire for a little while every day till Twelfth
Night, can, if kept under the bed, protect the house for a whole year
from fire and thunder; that it can prevent the inmates from having
chilblains on their heels in winter; that it can cure the cattle of many
maladies; that if a piece of it be steeped in the water which cows drink
it helps them to calve; and lastly that if the ashes of the log be
strewn on the fields it can save the wheat from mildew.”   4

  In some parts of Flanders and France the remains of the Yule log were
regularly kept in the house under a bed as a protection against thunder
and lightning; in Berry, when thunder was heard, a member of the family
used to take a piece of the log and throw it on the fire, which was
believed to avert the lightning. Again, in Perigord, the charcoal and
ashes are carefully collected and kept for healing swollen glands; the
part of the trunk which has not been burnt in the fire is used by
ploughmen to make the wedge for their plough, because they allege that
it causes the seeds to thrive better; and the women keep pieces of it
till Twelfth Night for the sake of their chickens. Some people imagine
that they will have as many chickens as there are sparks that fly out of
the brands of the log when they shake them; and others place the extinct
brands under the bed to drive away vermin. In various parts of France
the charred log is thought to guard the house against sorcery as well as
against lightning.   5

  In England the customs and beliefs concerning the Yule log used to be
similar. On the night of Christmas Eve, says the antiquary John Brand,
“our ancestors were wont to light up candles of an uncommon size, called
Christmas Candles, and lay a log of wood upon the fire, called a
Yule-clog or Christmas-block, to illuminate the house, and, as it were,
to turn night into day.” The old custom was to light the Yule log with a
fragment of its predecessor, which had been kept throughout the year for
the purpose; where it was so kept, the fiend could do no mischief. The
remains of the log were also supposed to guard the house against fire
and lightning.   6

  To this day the ritual of bringing in the Yule log is observed with
much solemnity among the Southern Slavs, especially the Serbians. The
log is usually a block of oak, but sometimes of olive or beech. They
seem to think that they will have as many calves, lambs, pigs, and kids
as they strike sparks out of the burning log. Some people carry a piece
of the log out to the fields to protect them against hail. In Albania
down to recent years it was a common custom to burn a Yule log at
Christmas, and the ashes of the fire were scattered on the fields to
make them fertile. The Huzuls, a Slavonic people of the Carpathians,
kindle fire by the friction of wood on Christmas Eve (Old Style, the
fifth of January) and keep it burning till Twelfth Night.   7

  It is remarkable how common the belief appears to have been that the
remains of the Yule log, if kept throughout the year, had power to
protect the house against fire and especially against lightning. As the
Yule log was frequently of oak, it seems possible that this belief may
be a relic of the old Aryan creed which associated the oak-tree with the
god of thunder. Whether the curative and fertilising virtues ascribed to
the ashes of the Yule log, which are supposed to heal cattle as well as
men, to enable cows to calve, and to promote the fruitfulness of the
earth, may not be derived from the same ancient source, is a question
which deserves to be considered.   8
