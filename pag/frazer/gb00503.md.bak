# Chapter 5. The Magical Control of the Weather.

## Section 3. The Magical Control of the Sun.

AS THE MAGICIAN thinks he can make rain, so he fancies he can cause the
sun to shine, and can hasten or stay its going down. At an eclipse the
Ojebways used to imagine that the sun was being extinguished. So they
shot fire-tipped arrows in the air, hoping thus to rekindle his expiring
light. The Sencis of Peru also shot burning arrows at the sun during an
eclipse, but apparently they did this not so much to relight his lamp as
to drive away a savage beast with which they supposed him to be
struggling. Conversely during an eclipse of the moon some tribes of the
Orinoco used to bury lighted brands in the ground; because, said they,
if the moon were to be extinguished, all fire on earth would be
extinguished with her, except such as was hidden from her sight. During
an eclipse of the sun the Kamtchatkans were wont to bring out fire from
their huts and pray the great luminary to shine as before. But the
prayer addressed to the sun shows that this ceremony was religious
rather than magical. Purely magical, on the other hand, was the ceremony
observed on similar occasions by the Chilcotin Indians. Men and women
tucked up their robes, as they do in travelling, and then leaning on
staves, as if they were heavy laden, they continued to walk in a circle
till the eclipse was over. Apparently they thought thus to support the
failing steps of the sun as he trod his weary round in the sky.
Similarly in ancient Egypt the king, as the representative of the sun,
walked solemnly round the walls of a temple in order to ensure that the
sun should perform his daily journey round the sky without the
interruption of an eclipse or other mishap. And after the autumnal
equinox the ancient Egyptians held a festival called “the nativity of
the sun’s walking-stick,” because, as the luminary declined daily in the
sky, and his light and heat diminished, he was supposed to need a staff
on which to lean. In New Caledonia when a wizard desires to make
sunshine, he takes some plants and corals to the burial-ground, and
fashions them into a bundle, adding two locks of hair cut from a living
child of his family, also two teeth or an entire jawbone from the
skeleton of an ancestor. He then climbs a mountain whose top catches the
first rays of the morning sun. Here he deposits three sorts of plants on
a flat stone, places a branch of dry coral beside them, and hangs the
bundle of charms over the stone. Next morning he returns to the spot and
sets fire to the bundle at the moment when the sun rises from the sea.
As the smoke curls up, he rubs the stone with the dry coral, invokes his
ancestors and says: “Sun! I do this that you may be burning hot, and eat
up all the clouds in the sky.” The same ceremony is repeated at sunset.
The New Caledonians also make a drought by means of a disc-shaped stone
with a hole in it. At the moment when the sun rises, the wizard holds
the stone in his hand and passes a burning brand repeatedly into the
hole, while he says: “I kindle the sun, in order that he may eat up the
clouds and dry up our land, so that it may produce nothing.” The Banks
Islanders make sunshine by means of a mock sun. They take a very round
stone, called a vat loa or sunstone, wind red braid about it, and stick
it with owls’ feathers to represent rays, singing the proper spell in a
low voice. Then they hang it on some high tree, such as a banyan or a
casuarina, in a sacred place.   1

  The offering made by the Brahman in the morning is supposed to produce
the sun, and we are told that “assuredly it would not rise, were he not
to make that offering.” The ancient Mexicans conceived the sun as the
source of all vital force; hence they named him Ipalnemohuani, “He by
whom men live.” But if he bestowed life on the world, he needed also to
receive life from it. And as the heart is the seat and symbol of life,
bleeding hearts of men and animals were presented to the sun to maintain
him in vigour and enable him to run his course across the sky. Thus the
Mexican sacrifices to the sun were magical rather than religious, being
designed, not so much to please and propitiate him, as physically to
renew his energies of heat, light, and motion. The constant demand for
human victims to feed the solar fire was met by waging war every year on
the neighbouring tribes and bringing back troops of captives to be
sacrificed on the altar. Thus the ceaseless wars of the Mexicans and
their cruel system of human sacrifices, the most monstrous on record,
sprang in great measure from a mistaken theory of the solar system. No
more striking illustration could be given of the disastrous consequences
that may flow in practice from a purely speculative error. The ancient
Greeks believed that the sun drove in a chariot across the sky; hence
the Rhodians, who worshipped the sun as their chief deity, annually
dedicated a chariot and four horses to him, and flung them into the sea
for his use. Doubtless they thought that after a year’s work his old
horses and chariot would be worn out. From a like motive, probably, the
idolatrous kings of Judah dedicated chariots and horses to the sun, and
the Spartans, Persians, and Massagetae sacrificed horses to him. The
Spartans performed the sacrifice on the top of Mount Taygetus, the
beautiful range behind which they saw the great luminary set every
night. It was as natural for the inhabitants of the valley of Sparta to
do this as it was for the islanders of Rhodes to throw the chariot and
horses into the sea, into which the sun seemed to them to sink at
evening. For thus, whether on the mountain or in the sea, the fresh
horses stood ready for the weary god where they would be most welcome,
at the end of his day’s journey.   2

  As some people think they can light up the sun or speed him on his
way, so others fancy they can retard or stop him. In a pass of the
Peruvian Andes stand two ruined towers on opposite hills. Iron hooks are
clamped into their walls for the purpose of stretching a net from one
tower to the other. The net is intended to catch the sun. Stories of men
who have caught the sun in a noose are widely spread. When the sun is
going southward in the autumn, and sinking lower and lower in the Arctic
sky, the Esquimaux of Iglulik play the game of cat’s cradle in order to
catch him in the meshes of the string and so prevent his disappearance.
On the contrary, when the sun is moving northward in the spring, they
play the game of cup-and-ball to hasten his return. When an Australian
blackfellow wishes to stay the sun from going down till he gets home, he
puts a sod in the fork of a tree, exactly facing the setting sun. On the
other hand, to make it go down faster, the Australians throw sand into
the air and blow with their mouths towards the sun, perhaps to waft the
lingering orb westward and bury it under the sands into which it appears
to sink at night.   3

  As some people imagine they can hasten the sun, so others fancy they
can jog the tardy moon. The natives of New Guinea reckon months by the
moon, and some of them have been known to throw stones and spears at the
moon, in order to accelerate its progress and so to hasten the return of
their friends, who were away from home for twelve months working on a
tobacco plantation. The Malays think that a bright glow at sunset may
throw a weak person into a fever. Hence they attempt to extinguish the
glow by spitting out water and throwing ashes at it. The Shuswap Indians
believe that they can bring on cold weather by burning the wood of a
tree that has been struck by lightning. The belief may be based on the
observation that in their country cold follows a thunder-storm. Hence in
spring, when these Indians are travelling over the snow on high ground,
they burn splinters of such wood in the fire in order that the crust of
the snow may not melt.   4
