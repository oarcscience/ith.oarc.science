# Chapter 52. Killing the Divine Animal.

## Section 3. Killing the Sacred Serpent.

WEST AFRICA appears to furnish another example of the annual killing of
a sacred animal and the preservation of its skin. The negroes of
Issapoo, in the island of Fernando Po, regard the cobra-capella as their
guardian deity, who can do them good or ill, bestow riches or inflict
disease and death. The skin of one of these reptiles is hung tail
downwards from a branch of the highest tree in the public square, and
the placing of it on the tree is an annual ceremony. As soon as the
ceremony is over, all children born within the past year are carried out
and their hands made to touch the tail of the serpent’s skin. The latter
custom is clearly a way of placing the infants under the protection of
the tribal god. Similarly in Senegambia a python is expected to visit
every child of the Python clan within eight days after birth; and the
Psylli, a Snake clan of ancient Africa, used to expose their infants to
snakes in the belief that the snakes would not harm true-born children
of the clan.   1
