# Chapter 22. Tabooed Words.

## Section 3. Names of the Dead tabooed.

THE CUSTOM of abstaining from all mention of the names of the dead was
observed in antiquity by the Albanians of the Caucasus, and at the
present day it is in full force among many savage tribes. Thus we are
told that one of the customs most rigidly observed and enforced amongst
the Australian aborigines is never to mention the name of a deceased
person, whether male or female; to name aloud one who has departed this
life would be a gross violation of their most sacred prejudices, and
they carefully abstain from it. The chief motive for this abstinence
appears to be a fear of evoking the ghost, although the natural
unwillingness to revive past sorrows undoubtedly operates also to draw
the veil of oblivion over the names of the dead. Once Mr. Oldfield so
terrified a native by shouting out the name of a deceased person, that
the man fairly took to his heels and did not venture to show himself
again for several days. At their next meeting he bitterly reproached the
rash white man for his indiscretion; “nor could I,” adds Mr. Oldfield,
“induce him by any means to utter the awful sound of a dead man’s name,
for by so doing he would have placed himself in the power of the malign
spirits.” Among the aborigines of Victoria the dead were very rarely
spoken of, and then never by their names; they were referred to in a
subdued voice as “the lost one” or “the poor fellow that is no more.” To
speak of them by name would, it was supposed, excite the malignity of
Couit-gil, the spirit of the departed, which hovers on earth for a time
before it departs for ever towards the setting sun. Of the tribes on the
Lower Murray River we are told that when a person dies “they carefully
avoid mentioning his name; but if compelled to do so, they pronounce it
in a very low whisper, so faint that they imagine the spirit cannot hear
their voice.” Amongst the tribes of Central Australia no one may utter
the name of the deceased during the period of mourning, unless it is
absolutely necessary to do so, and then it is only done in a whisper for
fear of disturbing and annoying the man’s spirit which is walking about
in ghostly form. If the ghost hears his name mentioned he concludes that
his kinsfolk are not mourning for him properly; if their grief were
genuine they could not bear to bandy his name about. Touched to the
quick by their hard-hearted indifference the indignant ghost will come
and trouble them in dreams.   1

  The same reluctance to utter the names of the dead appears to prevail
among all the Indian tribes of America from Hudson’s Bay Territory to
Patagonia. Among the Goajiros of Colombia to mention the dead before his
kinsmen is a dreadful offence, which is often punished with death; for
if it happens on the rancho of the deceased, in presence of his nephew
or uncle, they will assuredly kill the offender on the spot if they can.
But if he escapes, the penalty resolves itself into a heavy fine,
usually of two or more oxen.   2

  A similar reluctance to mention the names of the dead is reported of
peoples so widely separated from each other as the Samoyeds of Siberia
and the Todas of Southern India; the Mongols of Tartary and the Tuaregs
of the Sahara; the Ainos of Japan and the Akamba and Nandi of Eastern
Africa; the Tinguianes of the Philippines and the inhabitants of the
Nicobar Islands, of Borneo, of Madagascar, and of Tasmania. In all
cases, even where it is not expressly stated, the fundamental reason for
this avoidance is probably the fear of the ghost. That this is the real
motive with the Tuaregs we are positively informed. They dread the
return of the dead man’s spirit, and do all they can to avoid it by
shifting their camp after a death, ceasing for ever to pronounce the
name of the departed, and eschewing everything that might be regarded as
an evocation or recall of his soul. Hence they do not, like the Arabs,
designate individuals by adding to their personal names the names of
their fathers; they never speak of So-and-so, son of So-and-so; they
give to every man a name which will live and die with him. So among some
of the Victorian tribes in Australia personal names were rarely
perpetuated, because the natives believed that any one who adopted the
name of a deceased person would not live long; probably his ghostly
namesake was supposed to come and fetch him away to the spirit-land.   3

  The same fear of the ghost, which moves people to suppress his old
name, naturally leads all persons who bear a similar name to exchange it
for another, lest its utterance should attract the attention of the
ghost, who cannot reasonably be expected to discriminate between all the
different applications of the same name. Thus we are told that in the
Adelaide and Encounter Bay tribes of South Australia the repugnance to
mentioning the names of those who have died lately is carried so far,
that persons who bear the same name as the deceased abandon it, and
either adopt temporary names or are known by any others that happen to
belong to them. A similar custom prevails among some of the Queensland
tribes; but the prohibition to use the names of the dead is not
permanent, though it may last for many years. In some Australian tribes
the change of name thus brought about is permanent; the old name is laid
aside for ever, and the man is known by his new name for the rest of his
life, or at least until he is obliged to change it again for a like
reason. Among the North American Indians all persons, whether men or
women, who bore the name of one who had just died were obliged to
abandon it and to adopt other names, which was formally done at the
first ceremony of mourning for the dead. In some tribes to the east of
the Rocky Mountains this change of name lasted only during the season of
mourning, but in other tribes on the Pacific Coast of North America it
seems to have been permanent.   4

  Sometimes by an extension of the same reasoning all the near relations
of the deceased change their names, whatever they may happen to be,
doubtless from a fear that the sound of the familiar names might lure
back the vagrant spirit to its old home. Thus in some Victorian tribes
the ordinary names of all the next of kin were disused during the period
of mourning, and certain general terms, prescribed by custom, were
substituted for them. To call a mourner by his own name was considered
an insult to the departed, and often led to fighting and bloodshed.
Among Indian tribes of North-western America near relations of the
deceased often change their names “under an impression that spirits will
be attracted back to earth if they hear familiar names often repeated.”
Among the Kiowa Indians the name of the dead is never spoken in the
presence of the relatives, and on the death of any member of a family
all the others take new names. This custom was noted by Raleigh’s
colonists on Roanoke Island more than three centuries ago. Among the
Lengua Indians not only is a dead man’s name never mentioned, but all
the survivors change their names also. They say that Death has been
among them and has carried off a list of the living, and that he will
soon come back for more victims; hence in order to defeat his fell
purpose they change their names, believing that on his return Death,
though he has got them all on his list, will not be able to identify
them under their new names, and will depart to pursue the search
elsewhere. Nicobarese mourners take new names in order to escape the
unwelcome attentions of the ghost; and for the same purpose they
disguise themselves by shaving their heads so that the ghost is unable
to recognise them.   5

  Further, when the name of the deceased happens to be that of some
common object, such as an animal, or plant, or fire, or water, it is
sometimes considered necessary to drop that word in ordinary speech and
replace it by another. A custom of this sort, it is plain, may easily be
a potent agent of change in language; for where it prevails to any
considerable extent many words must constantly become obsolete and new
ones spring up. And this tendency has been remarked by observers who
have recorded the custom in Australia, America, and elsewhere. For
example, with regard to the Australian aborigines it has been noted that
“the dialects change with almost every tribe. Some tribes name their
children after natural objects; and when the person so named dies, the
word is never again mentioned; another word has therefore to be invented
for the object after which the child was called.” The writer gives as an
instance the case of a man whose name Karla signified “fire”; when Karla
died, a new word for fire had to be introduced. “Hence,” adds the
writer, “the language is always changing.” Again, in the Encounter Bay
tribe of South Australia, if a man of the name of Ngnke, which means
“water,” were to die, the whole tribe would be obliged to use some other
word to express water for a considerable time after his decease. The
writer who records this custom surmises that it may explain the presence
of a number of synonyms in the language of the tribe. This conjecture is
confirmed by what we know of some Victorian tribes whose speech
comprised a regular set of synonyms to be used instead of the common
terms by all members of a tribe in times of mourning. For instance, if a
man called Waa ( “crow”) departed this life, during the period of
mourning for him nobody might call a crow a waa; everybody had to speak
of the bird as a narrapart. When a person who rejoiced in the title of
Ringtail Opossum (weearn) had gone the way of all flesh, his sorrowing
relations and the tribe at large were bound for a time to refer to
ringtail opossums by the more sonorous name of manuungkuurt. If the
community were plunged in grief for the loss of a respected female who
bore the honourable name of Turkey Bustard, the proper name for turkey
bustards, which was barrim barrim, went out, and tillit tilliitsh came
in. And so mutatis mutandis with the names of Black Cockatoo, Grey Duck,
Gigantic Crane, Kangaroo, Eagle, Dingo, and the rest.   6

  A similar custom used to be constantly transforming the language of
the Abipones of Paraguay, amongst whom, however, a word once abolished
seems never to have been revived. New words, says the missionary
Dobrizhoffer, sprang up every year like mushrooms in a night, because
all words that resembled the names of the dead were abolished by
proclamation and others coined in their place. The mint of words was in
the hands of the old women of the tribe, and whatever term they stamped
with their approval and put in circulation was immediately accepted
without a murmur by high and low alike, and spread like wildfire through
every camp and settlement of the tribe. You would be astonished, says
the same missionary, to see how meekly the whole nation acquiesces in
the decision of a withered old hag, and how completely the old familiar
words fall instantly out of use and are never repeated either through
force of habit or forgetfulness. In the seven years that Dobrizhoffer
spent among these Indians the native word for jaguar was changed thrice,
and the words for crocodile, thorn, and the slaughter of cattle
underwent similar though less varied vicissitudes. As a result of this
habit, the vocabularies of the missionaries teemed with erasures, old
words having constantly to be struck out as obsolete and new ones
inserted in their place. In many tribes of British New Guinea the names
of persons are also the names of common things. The people believe that
if the name of a deceased person is pronounced, his spirit will return,
and as they have no wish to see it back among them the mention of his
name is tabooed and a new word is created to take its place, whenever
the name happens to be a common term of the language. Consequently many
words are permanently lost or revived with modified or new meanings. In
the Nicobar Islands a similar practice has similarly affected the speech
of the natives. “A most singular custom,” says Mr. de Roepstorff,
“prevails among them which one would suppose must most effectually
hinder the ‘making of history,’ or, at any rate, the transmission of
historical narrative. By a strict rule, which has all the sanction of
Nicobar superstition, no man’s name may be mentioned after his death! To
such a length is this carried that when, as very frequently happens, the
man rejoiced in the name of ‘Fowl,’ ‘Hat’, ‘Fire,’ ‘Road,’ etc., in its
Nicobarese equivalent, the use of these words is carefully eschewed for
the future, not only as being the personal designation of the deceased,
but even as the names of the common things they represent; the words die
out of the language, and either new vocables are coined to express the
thing intended, or a substitute for the disused word is found in other
Nicobarese dialects or in some foreign tongue. This extraordinary custom
not only adds an element of instability to the language, but destroys
the continuity of political life, and renders the record of past events
precarious and vague, if not impossible.”   7

  That a superstition which suppresses the names of the dead must cut at
the very root of historical tradition has been remarked by other workers
in this field. “The Klamath people,” observes Mr. A. S. Gatschet,
“possess no historic traditions going further back in time than a
century, for the simple reason that there was a strict law prohibiting
the mention of the person or acts of a deceased individual by using his
name. This law was rigidly observed among the Californians no less than
among the Oregonians, and on its transgression the death penalty could
be inflicted. This is certainly enough to suppress all historical
knowledge within a people. How can history be written without
names?”   8

  In many tribes, however, the power of this superstition to blot out
the memory of the past is to some extent weakened and impaired by a
natural tendency of the human mind. Time, which wears out the deepest
impressions, inevitably dulls, if it does not wholly efface, the print
left on the savage mind by the mystery and horror of death. Sooner or
later, as the memory of his loved ones fades slowly away, he becomes
more willing to speak of them, and thus their rude names may sometimes
be rescued by the philosophic enquirer before they have vanished, like
autumn leaves or winter snows, into the vast undistinguished limbo of
the past. In some of the Victorian tribes the prohibition to mention the
names of the dead remained in force only during the period of mourning;
in the Port Lincoln tribe of South Australia it lasted many years. Among
the Chinook Indians of North America “custom forbids the mention of a
dead man’s name, at least till many years have elapsed after the
bereavement.” Among the Puyallup Indians the observance of the taboo is
relaxed after several years, when the mourners have forgotten their
grief; and if the deceased was a famous warrior, one of his descendants,
for instance a great-grandson, may be named after him. In this tribe the
taboo is not much observed at any time except by the relations of the
dead. Similarly the Jesuit missionary Lafitau tells us that the name of
the departed and the similar names of the survivors were, so to say,
buried with the corpse until, the poignancy of their grief being abated,
it pleased the relations “to lift up the tree and raise the dead.” By
raising the dead they meant bestowing the name of the departed upon some
one else, who thus became to all intents and purposes a reincarnation of
the deceased, since on the principles of savage philosophy the name is a
vital part, if not the soul, of the man.   9

  Among the Lapps, when a woman was with child and near the time of her
delivery, a deceased ancestor or relation used to appear to her in a
dream and inform her what dead person was to be born again in her
infant, and whose name the child was therefore to bear. If the woman had
no such dream, it fell to the father or the relatives to determine the
name by divination or by consulting a wizard. Among the Khonds a birth
is celebrated on the seventh day after the event by a feast given to the
priest and to the whole village. To determine the child’s name the
priest drops grains of rice into a cup of water, naming with each grain
a deceased ancestor. From the movements of the seed in the water, and
from observations made on the person of the infant, he pronounces which
of his progenitors has reappeared in him, and the child generally, at
least among the northern tribes, receives the name of that ancestor.
Among the Yorubas, soon after a child has been born, a priest of Ifa,
the god of divination, appears on the scene to ascertain what ancestral
soul has been reborn in the infant. As soon as this has been decided,
the parents are told that the child must conform in all respects to the
manner of life of the ancestor who now animates him or her, and if, as
often happens, they profess ignorance, the priest supplies the necessary
information. The child usually receives the name of the ancestor who has
been born again in him.   10
