# Chapter 65. Balder and the Mistletoe.

THE READER may remember that the preceding account of the popular
fire-festivals of Europe was suggested by the myth of the Norse god
Balder, who is said to have been slain by a branch of mistletoe and
burnt in a great fire. We have now to enquire how far the customs which
have been passed in review help to shed light on the myth. In this
enquiry it may be convenient to begin with the mistletoe, the instrument
of Balder’s death.   1

  From time immemorial the mistletoe has been the object of
superstitious veneration in Europe. It was worshipped by the Druids, as
we learn from a famous passage of Pliny. After enumerating the different
kinds of mistletoe, he proceeds: “In treating of this subject, the
admiration in which the mistletoe is held throughout Gaul ought not to
pass unnoticed. The Druids, for so they call their wizards, esteem
nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the tree on which it grows,
provided only that the tree is an oak. But apart from this they choose
oak-woods for their sacred groves and perform no sacred rites without
oak-leaves; so that the very name of Druids may be regarded as a Greek
appellation derived from their worship of the oak. For they believe that
whatever grows on these trees is sent from heaven, and is a sign that
the tree has been chosen by the god himself. The mistletoe is very
rarely to be met with; but when it is found, they gather it with solemn
ceremony. This they do above all on the sixth day of the moon, from
whence they date the beginnings of their months, of their years, and of
their thirty years’ cycle, because by the sixth day the moon has plenty
of vigour and has not run half its course. After due preparations have
been made for a sacrifice and a feast under the tree, they hail it as
the universal healer and bring to the spot two white bulls, whose horns
have never been bound before. A priest clad in a white robe climbs the
tree and with a golden sickle cuts the mistletoe, which is caught in a
white cloth. Then they sacrifice the victims, praying that God may make
his own gift to prosper with those upon whom he has bestowed it. They
believe that a potion prepared from mistletoe will make barren animals
to bring forth, and that the plant is a remedy against all poison.”   2

  In another passage Pliny tells us that in medicine the mistletoe which
grows on an oak was esteemed the most efficacious, and that its efficacy
was by some superstitious people supposed to be increased if the plant
was gathered on the first day of the moon without the use of iron, and
if when gathered it was not allowed to touch the earth; oak-mistletoe
thus obtained was deemed a cure for epilepsy; carried about by women it
assisted them to conceive; and it healed ulcers most effectually, if
only the sufferer chewed a piece of the plant and laid another piece on
the sore. Yet, again, he says that mistletoe was supposed, like vinegar
and an egg, to be an excellent means of extinguishing a fire.   3

  If in these latter passages Pliny refers, as he apparently does, to
the beliefs current among his contemporaries in Italy, it will follow
that the Druids and the Italians were to some extent agreed as to the
valuable properties possessed by mistletoe which grows on an oak; both
of them deemed it an effectual remedy for a number of ailments, and both
of them ascribed to it a quickening virtue, the Druids believing that a
potion prepared from mistletoe would fertilise barren cattle, and the
Italians holding that a piece of mistletoe carried about by a woman
would help her to conceive a child. Further, both peoples thought that
if the plant were to exert its medicinal properties it must be gathered
in a certain way and at a certain time. It might not be cut with iron,
hence the Druids cut it with gold; and it might not touch the earth,
hence the Druids caught it in a white cloth. In choosing the time for
gathering the plant, both peoples were determined by observation of the
moon; only they differed as to the particular day of the moon, the
Italians preferring the first, and the Druids the sixth.   4

  With these beliefs of the ancient Gauls and Italians as to the
wonderful medicinal properties of mistletoe we may compare the similar
beliefs of the modern Aino of Japan. We read that they, “like many
nations of the Northern origin, hold the mistletoe in peculiar
veneration. They look upon it as a medicine, good in almost every
disease, and it is sometimes taken in food and at others separately as a
decoction. The leaves are used in preference to the berries, the latter
being of too sticky a nature for general purposes… . But many, too,
suppose this plant to have the power of making the gardens bear
plentifully. When used for this purpose, the leaves are cut up into fine
pieces, and, after having been prayed over, are sown with the millet and
other seeds, a little also being eaten with the food. Barren women have
also been known to eat the mistletoe, in order to be made to bear
children. That mistletoe which grows upon the willow is supposed to have
the greatest efficacy. This is because the willow is looked upon by them
as being an especially sacred tree.”   5

  Thus the Aino agree with the Druids in regarding mistletoe as a cure
for almost every disease, and they agree with the ancient Italians that
applied to women it helps them to bear children. Again, the Druidical
notion that the mistletoe was an “all-healer” or panacea may be compared
with a notion entertained by the Walos of Senegambia. These people “have
much veneration for a sort of mistletoe, which they call tob; they carry
leaves of it on their persons when they go to war as a preservative
against wounds, just as if the leaves were real talismans (gris-gris).”
The French writer who records this practice adds: “Is it not very
curious that the mistletoe should be in this part of Africa what it was
in the superstitions of the Gauls? This prejudice, common to the two
countries, may have the same origin; blacks and whites will doubtless
have seen, each of them for themselves, something supernatural in a
plant which grows and flourishes without having roots in the earth. May
they not have believed, in fact, that it was a plant fallen from the
sky, a gift of the divinity?”   6

  This suggestion as to the origin of the superstition is strongly
confirmed by the Druidical belief, reported by Pliny, that whatever grew
on an oak was sent from heaven and was a sign that the tree had been
chosen by the god himself. Such a belief explains why the Druids cut the
mistletoe, not with a common knife, but with a golden sickle, and why,
when cut, it was not suffered to touch the earth; probably they thought
that the celestial plant would have been profaned and its marvellous
virtue lost by contact with the ground. With the ritual observed by the
Druids in cutting the mistletoe we may compare the ritual which in
Cambodia is prescribed in a similar case. They say that when you see an
orchid growing as a parasite on a tamarind tree, you should dress in
white, take a new earthenware pot, then climb the tree at noon, break
off the plant, put it in the pot and let the pot fall to the ground.
After that you make in the pot a decoction which confers the gift of
invulnerability. Thus just as in Africa the leaves of one parasitic
plant are supposed to render the wearer invulnerable, so in Cambodia a
decoction made from another parasitic plant is considered to render the
same service to such as make use of it, whether by drinking or washing.
We may conjecture that in both places the notion of invulnerability is
suggested by the position of the plant, which, occupying a place of
comparative security above the ground, appears to promise to its
fortunate possessor a similar security from some of the ills that beset
the life of man on earth. We have already met with examples of the store
which the primitive mind sets on such vantage grounds.   7

  Whatever may be the origin of these beliefs and practices concerning
the mistletoe, certain it is that some of them have their analogies in
the folk-lore of modern European peasants. For example, it is laid down
as a rule in various parts of Europe that mistletoe may not be cut in
the ordinary way but must be shot or knocked down with stones from the
tree on which it is growing. Thus, in the Swiss canton of Aargau “all
parasitic plants are esteemed in a certain sense holy by the country
folk, but most particularly so the mistletoe growing on an oak. They
ascribe great powers to it, but shrink from cutting it off in the usual
manner. Instead of that they procure it in the following manner. When
the sun is in Sagittarius and the moon is on the wane, on the first,
third, or fourth day before the new moon, one ought to shoot down with
an arrow the mistletoe of an oak and to catch it with the left hand as
it falls. Such mistletoe is a remedy for every ailment of children.”
Here among the Swiss peasants, as among the Druids of old, special
virtue is ascribed to mistletoe which grows on an oak: it may not be cut
in the usual way: it must be caught as it falls to the ground; and it is
esteemed a panacea for all diseases, at least of children. In Sweden,
also, it is a popular superstition that if mistletoe is to possess its
peculiar virtue, it must either be shot down out of the oak or knocked
down with stones. Similarly, “so late as the early part of the
nineteenth century, people in Wales believed that for the mistletoe to
have any power, it must be shot or struck down with stones off the tree
where it grew.”   8

  Again, in respect of the healing virtues of mistletoe the opinion of
modern peasants, and even of the learned, has to some extent agreed with
that of the ancients. The Druids appear to have called the plant, or
perhaps the oak on which it grew, the “all-healer”; and “all-healer” is
said to be still a name of the mistletoe in the modern Celtic speech of
Brittany, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. On St. John’s morning (Midsummer
morning) peasants of Piedmont and Lombardy go out to search the
oak-leaves for the “oil of St. John,” which is supposed to heal all
wounds made with cutting instruments. Originally, perhaps, the “oil of
St. John” was simply the mistletoe, or a decoction made from it. For in
Holstein the mistletoe, especially oak-mistletoe, is still regarded as a
panacea for green wounds and as a sure charm to secure success in
hunting; and at Lacaune, in the south of France, the old Druidical
belief in the mistletoe as an antidote to all poisons still survives
among the peasantry; they apply the plant to the stomach of the sufferer
or give him a decoction of it to drink. Again, the ancient belief that
mistletoe is a cure for epilepsy has survived in modern times not only
among the ignorant but among the learned. Thus in Sweden persons
afflicted with the falling sickness think they can ward off attacks of
the malady by carrying about with them a knife which has a handle of oak
mistletoe; and in Germany for a similar purpose pieces of mistletoe used
to be hung round the necks of children. In the French province of
Bourbonnais a popular remedy for epilepsy is a decoction of mistletoe
which has been gathered on an oak on St. John’s Day and boiled with
rye-flour. So at Bottesford in Lincolnshire a decoction of mistletoe is
supposed to be a palliative for this terrible disease. Indeed mistletoe
was recommended as a remedy for the falling sickness by high medical
authorities in England and Holland down to the eighteenth century.   9

  However, the opinion of the medical profession as to the curative
virtues of mistletoe has undergone a radical alteration. Whereas the
Druids thought that mistletoe cured everything, modern doctors appear to
think that it cures nothing. If they are right, we must conclude that
the ancient and widespread faith in the medicinal virtue of mistletoe is
a pure superstition based on nothing better than the fanciful inferences
which ignorance has drawn from the parasitic nature of the plant, its
position high up on the branch of a tree seeming to protect it from the
dangers to which plants and animals are subject on the surface of the
ground. From this point of view we can perhaps understand why mistletoe
has so long and so persistently been prescribed as a cure for the
falling sickness. As mistletoe cannot fall to the ground because it is
rooted on the branch of a tree high above the earth, it seems to follow
as a necessary consequence that an epileptic patient cannot possibly
fall down in a fit so long as he carries a piece of mistletoe in his
pocket or a decoction of mistletoe in his stomach. Such a train of
reasoning would probably be regarded even now as cogent by a large
portion of the human species.   10

  Again the ancient Italian opinion that mistletoe extinguishes fire
appears to be shared by Swedish peasants, who hang up bunches of
oak-mistletoe on the ceilings of their rooms as a protection against
harm in general and conflagration in particular. A hint as to the way in
which mistletoe comes to be possessed of this property is furnished by
the epithet “thunder-bosom,” which people of the Aargau canton in
Switzerland apply to the plant. For a thunder-besom is a shaggy, bushy
excrescence on branches of trees, which is popularly believed to be
produced by a flash of lightning; hence in Bohemia a thunder-besom burnt
in the fire protects the house against being struck by a thunder-bolt.
Being itself a product of lightning it naturally serves, on homoeopathic
principles, as a protection against lightning, in fact as a kind of
lightning-conductor. Hence the fire which mistletoe in Sweden is
designed especially to avert from houses may be fire kindled by
lightning; though no doubt the plant is equally effective against
conflagration in general.   11

  Again, mistletoe acts as a master-key as well as a
lightning-conductor; for it is said to open all locks. But perhaps the
most precious of all the virtues of mistletoe is that it affords
efficient protection against sorcery and witchcraft. That, no doubt, is
the reason why in Austria a twig of mistletoe is laid on the threshold
as a preventive of nightmare; and it may be the reason why in the north
of England they say that if you wish your dairy to thrive you should
give your bunch of mistletoe to the first cow that calves after New
Year’s Day, for it is well known that nothing is so fatal to milk and
butter as witchcraft. Similarly in Wales, for the sake of ensuring good
luck to the dairy, people used to give a branch of mistletoe to the
first cow that gave birth to a calf after the first hour of the New
Year; and in rural districts of Wales, where mistletoe abounded, there
was always a profusion of it in the farmhouses. When mistletoe was
scarce, Welsh farmers used to say, “No mistletoe, no luck”; but if there
was a fine crop of mistletoe, they expected a fine crop of corn. In
Sweden mistletoe is diligently sought after on St. John’s Eve, the
people “believing it to be, in a high degree, possessed of mystic
qualities; and that if a sprig of it be attached to the ceiling of the
dwelling-house, the horse’s stall, or the cow’s crib, the Troll will
then be powerless to injure either man or beast.”   12

  With regard to the time when the mistletoe should be gathered opinions
have varied. The Druids gathered it above all on the sixth day of the
moon, the ancient Italians apparently on the first day of the moon. In
modern times some have preferred the full moon of March and others the
waning moon of winter when the sun is in Sagittarius. But the favourite
time would seem to be Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day. We have seen that
both in France and Sweden special virtues are ascribed to mistletoe
gathered at Midsummer. The rule in Sweden is that “mistletoe must be cut
on the night of Midsummer Eve when sun and moon stand in the sign of
their might.” Again, in Wales it was believed that a sprig of mistletoe
gathered on St. John’s Eve (Midsummer Eve), or at any time before the
berries appeared, would induce dreams of omen, both good and bad, if it
were placed under the pillow of the sleeper. Thus mistletoe is one of
the many plants whose magical or medicinal virtues are believed to
culminate with the culmination of the sun on the longest day of the
year. Hence it seems reasonable to conjecture that in the eyes of the
Druids, also, who revered the plant so highly, the sacred mistletoe may
have acquired a double portion of its mystic qualities at the solstice
in June, and that accordingly they may have regularly cut it with solemn
ceremony on Midsummer Eve.   13

  Be that as it may, certain it is that the mistletoe, the instrument of
Balder’s death, has been regularly gathered for the sake of its mystic
qualities on Midsummer Eve in Scandinavia, Balder’s home. The plant is
found commonly growing on pear-trees, oaks, and other trees in thick
damp woods throughout the more temperate parts of Sweden. Thus one of
the two main incidents of Balder’s myth is reproduced in the great
midsummer festival of Scandinavia. But the other main incident of the
myth, the burning of Balder’s body on a pyre, has also its counterpart
in the bonfires which still blaze, or blazed till lately, in Denmark,
Norway, and Sweden on Midsummer Eve. It does not appear, indeed, that
any effigy is burned in these bonfires; but the burning of an effigy is
a feature which might easily drop out after its meaning was forgotten.
And the name of Balder’s balefires (Balder’s Ba˘lar), by which these
midsummer fires were formerly known in Sweden, puts their connexion with
Balder beyond the reach of doubt, and makes it probable that in former
times either a living representative or an effigy of Balder was annually
burned in them. Midsummer was the season sacred to Balder, and the
Swedish poet Tegner, in placing the burning of Balder at midsummer, may
very well have followed an old tradition that the summer solstice was
the time when the good god came to his untimely end.   14

  Thus it has been shown that the leading incidents of the Balder myth
have their counterparts in those fire-festivals of our European
peasantry which undoubtedly date from a time long prior to the
introduction of Christianity. The pretence of throwing the victim chosen
by lot into the Beltane fire, and the similar treatment of the man, the
future Green Wolf, at the midsummer bonfire in Normandy, may naturally
be interpreted as traces of an older custom of actually burning human
beings on these occasions; and the green dress of the Green Wolf,
coupled with the leafy envelope of the young fellow who trod out the
midsummer fire at Moosheim, seems to hint that the persons who perished
at these festivals did so in the character of tree-spirits or deities of
vegetation. From all this we may reasonably infer that in the Balder
myth on the one hand, and the fire-festivals and custom of gathering
mistletoe on the other hand, we have, as it were, the two broken and
dissevered halves of an original whole. In other words, we may assume
with some degree of probability that the myth of Balder’s death was not
merely a myth, that is, a description of physical phenomena in imagery
borrowed from human life, but that it was at the same time the story
which people told to explain why they annually burned a human
representative of the god and cut the mistletoe with solemn ceremony. If
I am right, the story of Balder’s tragic end formed, so to say, the text
of the sacred drama which was acted year by year as a magical rite to
cause the sun to shine, trees to grow, crops to thrive, and to guard man
and beast from the baleful arts of fairies and trolls, of witches and
warlocks. The tale belonged, in short, to that class of nature myths
which are meant to be supplemented by ritual; here, as so often, myth
stood to magic in the relation of theory to practice.   15

  But if the victims—the human Balders—who died by fire, whether in
spring or at midsummer, were put to death as living embodiments of
tree-spirits or deities of vegetation, it would seem that Balder himself
must have been a tree-spirit or deity of vegetation. It becomes
desirable, therefore, to determine, if we can, the particular kind of
tree or trees, of which a personal representative was burned at the
fire-festivals. For we may be quite sure that it was not as a
representative of vegetation in general that the victim suffered death.
The idea of vegetation in general is too abstract to be primitive. Most
probably the victim at first represented a particular kind of sacred
tree. But of all European trees none has such claims as the oak to be
considered as pre-eminently the sacred tree of the Aryans. We have seen
that its worship is attested for all the great branches of the Aryan
stock in Europe; hence we may certainly conclude that the tree was
venerated by the Aryans in common before the dispersion, and that their
primitive home must have lain in a land which was clothed with forests
of oak.   16

  Now, considering the primitive character and remarkable similarity of
the fire-festivals observed by all the branches of the Aryan race in
Europe, we may infer that these festivals form part of the common stock
of religious observances which the various peoples carried with them in
their wanderings from their old home. But, if I am right, an essential
feature of those primitive fire-festivals was the burning of a man who
represented the tree-spirit. In view, then, of the place occupied by the
oak in the religion of the Aryans, the presumption is that the tree so
represented at the fire-festivals must originally have been the oak. So
far as the Celts and Lithuanians are concerned, this conclusion will
perhaps hardly be contested. But both for them and for the Germans it is
confirmed by a remarkable piece of religious conservatism. The most
primitive method known to man of producing fire is by rubbing two pieces
of wood against each other till they ignite; and we have seen that this
method is still used in Europe for kindling sacred fires such as the
need-fire, and that most probably it was formerly resorted to at all the
fire-festivals under discussion. Now it is sometimes required that the
need-fire, or other sacred fire, should be made by the friction of a
particular kind of wood; and when the kind of wood is prescribed,
whether among Celts, Germans, or Slavs, that wood appears to be
generally the oak. But if the sacred fire was regularly kindled by the
friction of oak-wood, we may infer that originally the fire was also fed
with the same material. In point of fact, it appears that the perpetual
fire of Vesta at Rome was fed with oak-wood, and that oak-wood was the
fuel consumed in the perpetual fire which burned under the sacred oak at
the great Lithuanian sanctuary of Romove. Further, that oak-wood was
formerly the fuel burned in the midsummer fires may perhaps be inferred
from the custom, said to be still observed by peasants in many mountain
districts of Germany, of making up the cottage fire on Midsummer Day
with a heavy block of oak-wood. The block is so arranged that it
smoulders slowly and is not finally reduced to charcoal till the expiry
of a year. Then upon next Midsummer Day the charred embers of the old
log are removed to make room for the new one, and are mixed with the
seed-corn or scattered about the garden. This is believed to guard the
food cooked on the hearth from witchcraft, to preserve the luck of the
house, to promote the growth of the crops, and to keep them from blight
and vermin. Thus the custom is almost exactly parallel to that of the
Yule-log, which in parts of Germany, France, England, Serbia, and other
Slavonic lands was commonly of oak-wood. The general conclusion is, that
at those periodic or occasional ceremonies the ancient Aryans both
kindled and fed the fire with the sacred oak-wood.   17

  But if at these solemn rites the fire was regularly made of oakwood,
it follows that any man who was burned in it as a personification of the
tree-spirit could have represented no tree but the oak. The sacred oak
was thus burned in duplicate; the wood of the tree was consumed in the
fire, and along with it was consumed a living man as a personification
of the oak-spirit. The conclusion thus drawn for the European Aryans in
general is confirmed in its special application to the Scandinavians by
the relation in which amongst them the mistletoe appears to have stood
to the burning of the victim in the midsummer fire. We have seen that
among Scandinavians it has been customary to gather the mistletoe at
midsummer. But so far as appears on the face of this custom, there is
nothing to connect it with the midsummer fires in which human victims or
effigies of them were burned. Even if the fire, as seems probable, was
originally always made with oak-wood, why should it have been necessary
to pull the mistletoe? The last link between the midsummer customs of
gathering the mistletoe and lighting the bonfires is supplied by
Balder’s myth, which can hardly be disjoined from the customs in
question. The myth suggests that a vital connexion may once have been
believed to subsist between the mistletoe and the human representative
of the oak who was burned in the fire. According to the myth, Balder
could be killed by nothing in heaven or earth except the mistletoe; and
so long as the mistletoe remained on the oak, he was not only immortal
but invulnerable. Now, if we suppose that Balder was the oak, the origin
of the myth becomes intelligible. The mistletoe was viewed as the seat
of life of the oak, and so long as it was uninjured nothing could kill
or even wound the oak. The conception of the mistletoe as the seat of
life of the oak would naturally be suggested to primitive people by the
observation that while the oak is deciduous, the mistletoe which grows
on it is evergreen. In winter the sight of its fresh foliage among the
bare branches must have been hailed by the worshippers of the tree as a
sign that the divine life which had ceased to animate the branches yet
survived in the mistletoe, as the heart of a sleeper still beats when
his body is motionless. Hence when the god had to be killed—when the
sacred tree had to be burnt—it was necessary to begin by breaking off
the mistletoe. For so long as the mistletoe remained intact, the oak (so
people might think) was invulnerable; all the blows of their knives and
axes would glance harmless from its surface. But once tear from the oak
its sacred heart—the mistletoe—and the tree nodded to its fall. And when
in later times the spirit of the oak came to be represented by a living
man, it was logically necessary to suppose that, like the tree he
personated, he could neither be killed nor wounded so long as the
mistletoe remained uninjured. The pulling of the mistletoe was thus at
once the signal and the cause of his death.   18

  On this view the invulnerable Balder is neither more nor less than a
personification of a mistletoe-bearing oak. The interpretation is
confirmed by what seems to have been an ancient Italian belief, that the
mistletoe can be destroyed neither by fire nor water; for if the
parasite is thus deemed indestructible, it might easily be supposed to
communicate its own indestructibility to the tree on which it grows, so
long as the two remain in conjunction. Or, to put the same idea in
mythical form, we might tell how the kindly god of the oak had his life
securely deposited in the imperishable mistletoe which grew among the
branches; how accordingly so long as the mistletoe kept its place there,
the deity himself remained invulnerable; and how at last a cunning foe,
let into the secret of the god’s invulnerability, tore the mistletoe
from the oak, thereby killing the oak-god and afterwards burning his
body in a fire which could have made no impression on him so long as the
incombustible parasite retained its seat among the boughs.   19

  But since the idea of a being whose life is thus, in a sense, outside
himself, must be strange to many readers, and has, indeed, not yet been
recognised in its full bearing on primitive superstition, it will be
worth while to illustrate it by examples drawn both from story and
custom. The result will be to show that, in assuming this idea as the
explanation of Balder’s relation to the mistletoe, I assume a principle
which is deeply engraved on the mind of primitive man.   20
