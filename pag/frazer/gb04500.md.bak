# Chapter 45. The Corn-Mother and the Corn-Maiden in Northern Europe.

IT has been argued by W. Mannhardt that the first part of Demeter’s name
is derived from an alleged Cretan word deai, “barley,” and that
accordingly Demeter means neither more nor less than “Barley-mother” or
“Corn-mother”; for the root of the word seems to have been applied to
different kinds of grain by different branches of the Aryans. As Crete
appears to have been one of the most ancient seats of the worship of
Demeter, it would not be surprising if her name were of Cretan origin.
But the etymology is open to serious objections, and it is safer
therefore to lay no stress on it. Be that as it may, we have found
independent reasons for identifying Demeter as the Corn-mother, and of
the two species of corn associated with her in Greek religion, namely
barley and wheat, the barley has perhaps the better claim to be her
original element; for not only would it seem to have been the staple
food of the Greeks in the Homeric age, but there are grounds for
believing that it is one of the oldest, if not the very oldest, cereal
cultivated by the Aryan race. Certainly the use of barley in the
religious ritual of the ancient Hindoos as well as of the ancient Greeks
furnishes a strong argument in favour of the great antiquity of its
cultivation, which is known to have been practised by the lake-dwellers
of the Stone Age in Europe.   1

  Analogies to the Corn-mother or Barley-mother of ancient Greece have
been collected in great abundance by W. Mannhardt from the folk-lore of
modern Europe. The following may serve as specimens.   2

  In Germany the corn is very commonly personified under the name of the
Corn-mother. Thus in spring, when the corn waves in the wind, the
peasants say, “There comes the Corn-mother,” or “The Corn-mother is
running over the field,” or “The Corn-mother is going through the corn.”
When children wish to go into the fields to pull the blue corn-flowers
or the red poppies, they are told not to do so, because the Corn-mother
is sitting in the corn and will catch them. Or again she is called,
according to the crop, the Rye-mother or the Pea-mother, and children
are warned against straying in the rye or among the peas by threats of
the Rye-mother or the Pea-mother. Again the Corn-mother is believed to
make the crop grow. Thus in the neighbourhood of Magdeburg it is
sometimes said, “It will be a good year for flax; the Flax-mother has
been seen.” In a village of Styria it is said that the Corn-mother, in
the shape of a female puppet made out of the last sheaf of corn and
dressed in white, may be seen at mid-night in the corn-fields, which she
fertilises by passing through them; but if she is angry with a farmer,
she withers up all his corn.   3

  Further, the Corn-mother plays an important part in harvest customs.
She is believed to be present in the handful of corn which is left
standing last on the field; and with the cutting of this last handful
she is caught, or driven away, or killed. In the first of these cases,
the last sheaf is carried joyfully home and honoured as a divine being.
It is placed in the barn, and at threshing the corn-spirit appears
again. In the Hanoverian district of Hadeln the reapers stand round the
last sheaf and beat it with sticks in order to drive the Corn-mother out
of it. They call to each other, “There she is! hit her! Take care she
doesn’t catch you!” The beating goes on till the grain is completely
threshed out; then the Corn-mother is believed to be driven away. In the
neighbourhood of Danzig the person who cuts the last ears of corn makes
them into a doll, which is called the Corn-mother or the Old Woman and
is brought home on the last waggon. In some parts of Holstein the last
sheaf is dressed in woman’s clothes and called the Corn-mother. It is
carried home on the last waggon, and then thoroughly drenched with
water. The drenching with water is doubtless a rain-charm. In the
district of Bruck in Styria the last sheaf, called the Corn-mother, is
made up into the shape of a woman by the oldest married woman in the
village, of an age from fifty to fifty-five years. The finest ears are
plucked out of it and made into a wreath, which, twined with flowers, is
carried on her head by the prettiest girl of the village to the farmer
or squire, while the Corn-mother is laid down in the barn to keep off
the mice. In other villages of the same district the Corn-mother, at the
close of harvest, is carried by two lads at the top of a pole. They
march behind the girl who wears the wreath to the squire’s house, and
while he receives the wreath and hangs it up in the hall, the
Corn-mother is placed on the top of a pile of wood, where she is the
centre of the harvest supper and dance. Afterwards she is hung up in the
barn and remains there till the threshing is over. The man who gives the
last stroke at threshing is called the son of the Corn-mother; he is
tied up in the Corn-mother, beaten, and carried through the village. The
wreath is dedicated in church on the following Sunday; and on Easter Eve
the grain is rubbed out of it by a seven-year-old girl and scattered
amongst the young corn. At Christmas the straw of the wreath is placed
in the manger to make the cattle thrive. Here the fertilising power of
the Corn-mother is plainly brought out by scattering the seed taken from
her body (for the wreath is made out of the Corn-mother) among the new
corn; and her influence over animal life is indicated by placing the
straw in the manger. Amongst the Slavs also the last sheaf is known as
the Rye-mother, the Wheat-mother, the Oats-mother, the Barley-mother,
and so on, according to the crop. In the district of Tarnow, Galicia,
the wreath made out of the last stalks is called the Wheat-mother,
Rye-mother, or Pea-mother. It is placed on a girl’s head and kept till
spring, when some of the grain is mixed with the seed-corn. Here again
the fertilising power of the Corn-mother is indicated. In France, also,
in the neighbourhood of Auxerre, the last sheaf goes by the name of the
Mother of the Wheat, Mother of the Barley, Mother of the Rye, or Mother
of the Oats. They leave it standing in the field till the last waggon is
about to wend homewards. Then they make a puppet out of it, dress it
with clothes belonging to the farmer, and adorn it with a crown and a
blue or white scarf. A branch of a tree is stuck in the breast of the
puppet, which is now called the Ceres. At the dance in the evening the
Ceres is set in the middle of the floor, and the reaper who reaped
fastest dances round it with the prettiest girl for his partner. After
the dance a pyre is made. All the girls, each wearing a wreath, strip
the puppet, pull it to pieces, and place it on the pyre, along with the
flowers with which it was adorned. Then the girl who was the first to
finish reaping sets fire to the pile, and all pray that Ceres may give a
fruitful year. Here, as Mannhardt observes, the old custom has remained
intact, though the name Ceres is a bit of schoolmaster’s learning. In
Upper Brittany the last sheaf is always made into human shape; but if
the farmer is a married man, it is made double and consists of a little
corn-puppet placed inside of a large one. This is called the
Mother-sheaf. It is delivered to the farmer’s wife, who unties it and
gives drink-money in return.   4

  Sometimes the last sheaf is called, not the Corn-mother, but the
Harvest-mother or the Great Mother. In the province of Osnabrück,
Hanover, it is called the Harvest-mother; it is made up in female form,
and then the reapers dance about with it. In some parts of Westphalia
the last sheaf at the rye-harvest is made especially heavy by fastening
stones in it. They bring it home on the last waggon and call it the
Great Mother, though they do not fashion it into any special shape. In
the district of Erfurt a very heavy sheaf, not necessarily the last, is
called the Great Mother, and is carried on the last waggon to the barn,
where all hands lift it down amid a fire of jokes.   5

  Sometimes again the last sheaf is called the Grandmother, and is
adorned with flowers, ribbons, and a woman’s apron. In East Prussia, at
the rye or wheat harvest, the reapers call out to the woman who binds
the last sheaf, “You are getting the Old Grandmother.” In the
neighbourhood of Magdeburg the men and women servants strive who shall
get the last sheaf, called the Grandmother. Whoever gets it will be
married in the next year, but his or her spouse will be old; if a girl
gets it, she will marry a widower; if a man gets it, he will marry an
old crone. In Silesia the Grandmother—a huge bundle made up of three or
four sheaves by the person who tied the last sheaf—was formerly
fashioned into a rude likeness of the human form. In the neighbourhood
of Belfast the last sheaf sometimes goes by the name of the Granny. It
is not cut in the usual way, but all the reapers throw their sickles at
it and try to bring it down. It is plaited and kept till the (next?)
autumn. Whoever gets it will marry in the course of the year.   6

  Often the last sheaf is called the Old Woman or the Old Man. In
Germany it is frequently shaped and dressed as a woman, and the person
who cuts it or binds it is said to “get the Old Woman.” At Altisheim, in
Swabia, when all the corn of a farm has been cut except a single strip,
all the reapers stand in a row before the strip; each cuts his share
rapidly, and he who gives the last cut “has the Old Woman.” When the
sheaves are being set up in heaps, the person who gets hold of the Old
Woman, which is the largest and thickest of all the sheaves, is jeered
at by the rest, who call out to him, “He has the Old Woman and must keep
her.” The woman who binds the last sheaf is sometimes herself called the
Old Woman, and it is said that she will be married in the next year. In
Neusaass, West Prussia, both the last sheaf—which is dressed up in
jacket, hat, and ribbons—and the woman who binds it are called the Old
Woman. Together they are brought home on the last waggon and are
drenched with water. In various parts of North Germany the last sheaf at
harvest is made up into a human effigy and called “the Old Man”; and the
woman who bound it is said “to have the Old Man.”   7

  In West Prussia, when the last rye is being raked together, the women
and girls hurry with the work, for none of them likes to be the last and
to get “the Old Man,” that is, a puppet made out of the last sheaf,
which must be carried before the other reapers by the person who was the
last to finish. In Silesia the last sheaf is called the Old Woman or the
Old Man and is the theme of many jests; it is made unusually large and
is sometimes weighted with a stone. Among the Wends the man or woman who
binds the last sheaf at wheat harvest is said to “have the Old Man.” A
puppet is made out of the wheaten straw and ears in the likeness of a
man and decked with flowers. The person who bound the last sheaf must
carry the Old Man home, while the rest laugh and jeer at him. The puppet
is hung up in the farmhouse and remains till a new Old Man is made at
the next harvest.   8

  In some of these customs, as Mannhardt has remarked, the person who is
called by the same name as the last sheaf and sits beside it on the last
waggon is obviously identified with it; he or she represents the
corn-spirit which has been caught in the last sheaf; in other words, the
corn-spirit is represented in duplicate, by a human being and by a
sheaf. The identification of the person with the sheaf is made still
clearer by the custom of wrapping up in the last sheaf the person who
cuts or binds it. Thus at Hermsdorf in Silesia it used to be the regular
practice to tie up in the last sheaf the woman who had bound it. At
Weiden, in Bavaria, it is the cutter, not the binder, of the last sheaf
who is tied up in it. Here the person wrapt up in the corn represents
the corn-spirit, exactly as a person wrapt in branches or leaves
represents the tree-spirit.   9

  The last sheaf, designated as the Old Woman, is often distinguished
from the other sheaves by its size and weight. Thus in some villages of
West Prussia the Old Woman is made twice as long and thick as a common
sheaf, and a stone is fastened in the middle of it. Sometimes it is made
so heavy that a man can barely lift it. At Alt-Pillau, in Samland, eight
or nine sheaves are often tied together to make the Old Woman, and the
man who sets it up grumbles at its weight. At Itzgrund, in Saxe-Coburg,
the last sheaf, called the Old Woman, is made large with the express
intention of thereby securing a good crop next year. Thus the custom of
making the last sheaf unusually large or heavy is a charm, working by
sympathetic magic, to ensure a large and heavy crop at the following
harvest.   10

  In Scotland, when the last corn was cut after Hallowmas, the female
figure made out of it was sometimes called the Carlin or Carline, that
is, the Old Woman. But if cut before Hallowmas, it was called the
Maiden; if cut after sunset, it was called the Witch, being supposed to
bring bad luck. Among the Highlanders of Scotland the last corn cut at
harvest is known either as the Old Wife (Cailleach) or as the Maiden; on
the whole the former name seems to prevail in the western and the latter
in the central and eastern districts. Of the Maiden we shall speak
presently; here we are dealing with the Old Wife. The following general
account of the custom is given by a careful and well-informed enquirer,
the Rev. J. G. Campbell, minister of the remote Hebridean island of
Tiree: “The Harvest Old Wife (a Cailleach).—In harvest, there was a
struggle to escape from being the last done with the shearing, and when
tillage in common existed, instances were known of a ridge being left
unshorn (no person would claim it) because of it being behind the rest.
The fear entertained was that of having the ‘famine of the farm’ (gort a
bhaile), in the shape of an imaginary old woman (cailleach), to feed
till next harvest. Much emulation and amusement arose from the fear of
this old woman… . . The first done made a doll of some blades of corn,
which was called the ‘old wife,’ and sent it to his nearest neighbour.
He in turn, when ready, passed it to another still less expeditious, and
the person it last remained with had ‘the old woman’ to keep for that
year.”   11

  In the island of Islay the last corn cut goes by the name of the Old
Wife (Cailleach), and when she has done her duty at harvest she is hung
up on the wall and stays there till the time comes to plough the fields
for the next year’s crop. Then she is taken down, and on the first day
when the men go to plough she is divided among them by the mistress of
the house. They take her in their pockets and give her to the horses to
eat when they reach the field. This is supposed to secure good luck for
the next harvest, and is understood to be the proper end of the Old
Wife.   12

  Usages of the same sort are reported from Wales. Thus in North
Pembrokeshire a tuft of the last corn cut, from six to twelve inches
long, is plaited and goes by the name of the Hag (wrach); and quaint old
customs used to be practised with it within the memory of many persons
still alive. Great was the excitement among the reapers when the last
patch of standing corn was reached. All in turn threw their sickles at
it, and the one who succeeded in cutting it received a jug of
home-brewed ale. The Hag (wrach) was then hurriedly made and taken to a
neighbouring farm, where the reapers were still busy at their work. This
was generally done by the ploughman; but he had to be very careful not
to be observed by his neighbours, for if they saw him coming and had the
least suspicion of his errand they would soon make him retrace his
steps. Creeping stealthily up behind a fence he waited till the foreman
of his neighbour’s reapers was just opposite him and within easy reach.
Then he suddenly threw the Hag over the fence and, if possible, upon the
foreman’s sickle. On that he took to his heels and made off as fast as
he could run, and he was a lucky man if he escaped without being caught
or cut by the flying sickles which the infuriated reapers hurled after
him. In other cases the Hag was brought home to the farmhouse by one of
the reapers. He did his best to bring it home dry and without being
observed; but he was apt to be roughly handled by the people of the
house, if they suspected his errand. Sometimes they stripped him of most
of his clothes, sometimes they would drench him with water which had
been carefully stored in buckets and pans for the purpose. If, however,
he succeeded in bringing the Hag in dry and unobserved, the master of
the house had to pay him a small fine; or sometimes a jug of beer “from
the cask next to the wall,” which seems to have commonly held the best
beer, would be demanded by the bearer. The Hag was then carefully hung
on a nail in the hall or elsewhere and kept there all the year. The
custom of bringing in the Hag (wrach) into the house and hanging it up
still exists in some farms of North Pembrokeshire, but the ancient
ceremonies which have just been described are now discontinued.   13

  In County Antrim, down to some years ago, when the sickle was finally
expelled by the reaping machine, the few stalks of corn left standing
last on the field were plaited together; then the reapers, blindfolded,
threw their sickles at the plaited corn, and whoever happened to cut it
through took it home with him and put it over his door. This bunch of
corn was called the Carley—probably the same word as Carlin.   14

  Similar customs are observed by Slavonic peoples. Thus in Poland the
last sheaf is commonly called the Baba, that is, the Old Woman. “In the
last sheaf,” it is said, “sits the Baba.” The sheaf itself is also
called the Baba, and is sometimes composed of twelve smaller sheaves
lashed together. In some parts of Bohemia the Baba, made out of the last
sheaf, has the figure of a woman with a great straw hat. It is carried
home on the last harvest-waggon and delivered, along with a garland, to
the farmer by two girls. In binding the sheaves the women strive not to
be last, for she who binds the last sheaf will have a child next year.
Sometimes the harvesters call out to the woman who binds the last sheaf,
“She has the Baba,” or “She is the Baba.” In the district of Cracow,
when a man binds the last sheaf, they say, “The Grandfather is sitting
in it”; when a woman binds it, they say, “The Baba is sitting in it,”
and the woman herself is wrapt up in the sheaf, so that only her head
projects out of it. Thus encased in the sheaf, she is carried on the
last harvest-waggon to the house, where she is drenched with water by
the whole family. She remains in the sheaf till the dance is over, and
for a year she retains the name of Baba.   15

  In Lithuania the name for the last sheaf is Boba (Old Woman),
answering to the Polish name Baba. The Boba is said to sit in the corn
which is left standing last. The person who binds the last sheaf or digs
the last potato is the subject of much banter, and receives and long
retains the name of the Old Rye-woman or the Old Potato-woman. The last
sheaf—the Boba—is made into the form of a woman, carried solemnly
through the village on the last harvest-waggon, and drenched with water
at the farmer’s house; then every one dances with it.   16

  In Russia also the last sheaf is often shaped and dressed as a woman,
and carried with dance and song to the farmhouse. Out of the last sheaf
the Bulgarians make a doll which they call the Corn-queen or
Corn-mother; it is dressed in a woman’s shirt, carried round the
village, and then thrown into the river in order to secure plenty of
rain and dew for the next year’s crop. Or it is burned and the ashes
strew on the fields, doubtless to fertilise them. The name Queen, as
applied to the last sheaf, has its analogies in Central and Northern
Europe. Thus, in the Salzburg district of Austria, at the end of the
harvest a great procession takes place, in which a Queen of the
Corn-ears (Ährenkönigin) is drawn along in a little carriage by young
fellows. The custom of the Harvest Queen appears to have been common in
England. Milton must have been familiar with it, for in Paradise Lost he
says:

“Adam the while

Waiting desirous her return, had wove

Of choicest flow’rs a garland to adorn

Her tresses, and her rural labours crown,

As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.”    17

  Often customs of this sort are practised, not on the harvest-field but
on the threshing-floor. The spirit of the corn, fleeing before the
reapers as they cut down the ripe grain, quits the reaped corn and takes
refuge in the barn, where it appears in the last sheaf threshed, either
to perish under the blows of the flail or to flee thence to the still
unthreshed corn of a neighbouring farm. Thus the last corn to be
threshed is called the Mother-Corn or the Old Woman. Sometimes the
person who gives the last stroke with the flail is called the Old Woman,
and is wrapt in the straw of the last sheaf, or has a bundle of straw
fastened on his back. Whether wrapt in the straw or carrying it on his
back, he is carted through the village amid general laughter. In some
districts of Bavaria, Thüringen, and elsewhere, the man who threshes the
last sheaf is said to have the Old Woman or the Old Corn-woman; he is
tied up in straw, carried or carted about the village, and set down at
last on the dunghill, or taken to the threshing-floor of a neighbouring
farmer who has not finished his threshing. In Poland the man who gives
the last stroke at threshing is called Baba (Old Woman); he is wrapt in
corn and wheeled through the village. Sometimes in Lithuania the last
sheaf is not threshed, but is fashioned into female shape and carried to
the barn of a neighbour who has not finished his threshing.   18

  In some parts of Sweden, when a stranger woman appears on the
threshing-floor, a flail is put round her body, stalks of corn are wound
round her neck, a crown of ears is placed on her head, and the threshers
call out, “Behold the Corn-woman.” Here the stranger woman, thus
suddenly appearing, is taken to be the corn-spirit who has just been
expelled by the flails from the corn-stalks. In other cases the farmer’s
wife represents the corn-spirit. Thus in the Commune of Saligné
(Vendée), the farmer’s wife, along with the last sheaf, is tied up in a
sheet, placed on a litter, and carried to the threshing machine, under
which she is shoved. Then the woman is drawn out and the sheaf is
threshed by itself, but the woman is tossed in the sheet, as if she were
being winnowed. It would be impossible to express more clearly the
identification of the woman with the corn than by this graphic imitation
of threshing and winnowing her.   19

  In these customs the spirit of the ripe corn is regarded as old, or at
least as of mature age. Hence the names of Mother, Grandmother, Old
Woman, and so forth. But in other cases the corn-spirit is conceived as
young. Thus at Saldern, near Wolfenbuttel, when the rye has been reaped,
three sheaves are tied together with a rope so as to make a puppet with
the corn ears for a head. This puppet is called the Maiden or the
Corn-maiden. Sometimes the corn-spirit is conceived as a child who is
separated from its mother by the stroke of the sickle. This last view
appears in the Polish custom of calling out to the man who cuts the last
handful of corn, “You have cut the navel-string.” In some districts of
West Prussia the figure made out of the last sheaf is called the
Bastard, and a boy is wrapt up in it. The woman who binds the last sheaf
and represents the Corn-mother is told that she is about to be brought
to bed; she cries like a woman in travail, and an old woman in the
character of grandmother acts as midwife. At last a cry is raised that
the child is born; whereupon the boy who is tied up in the sheaf
whimpers and squalls like an infant. The grandmother wraps a sack, in
imitation of swaddling bands, round the pretended baby, who is carried
joyfully to the barn, lest he should catch cold in the open air. In
other parts of North Germany the last sheaf, or the puppet made out of
it, is called the Child, the Harvest-Child, and so on, and they call out
to the woman who binds the last sheaf, “you are getting the child.”   20

  In some parts of Scotland, as well as in the north of England, the
last handful of corn cut on the harvest-field was called the kirn, and
the person who carried it off was said “to win the kirn.” It was then
dressed up like a child’s doll and went by the name of the kirn-baby,
the kirn-doll, or the Maiden. In Berwickshire down to about the middle
of the nineteenth century there was an eager competition among the
reapers to cut the last bunch of standing corn. They gathered round it
at a little distance and threw their sickles in turn at it, and the man
who succeeded in cutting it through gave it to the girl he preferred.
She made the corn so cut into a kirn-dolly and dressed it, and the doll
was then taken to the farmhouse and hung up there till the next harvest,
when its place was taken by the new kirn-dolly. At Spottiswoode in
Berwickshire the reaping of the last corn at harvest was called “cutting
the Queen” almost as often as “cutting the kirn.” The mode of cutting it
was not by throwing sickles. One of the reapers consented to be
blindfolded, and having been given a sickle in his hand and turned twice
or thrice about by his fellows, he was bidden to go and cut the kirn.
His groping about and making wild strokes in the air with his sickle
excited much hilarity. When he had tired himself out in vain and given
up the task as hopeless, another reaper was blindfolded and pursued the
quest, and so on, one after the other, till at last the kirn was cut.
The successful reaper was tossed up in the air with three cheers by his
brother harvesters. To decorate the room in which the kirn-supper was
held at Spottiswoode as well as the granary, where the dancing took
place, two women made kirn-dollies or Queens every year; and many of
these rustic effigies of the corn-spirit might be seen hanging up
together.   21

  In some parts of the Highlands of Scotland the last handful of corn
that is cut by the reapers on any particular farm is called the Maiden,
or in Gaelic Maidhdeanbuain, literally, “the shorn Maiden.”
Superstitions attach to the winning of the Maiden. If it is got by a
young person, they think it an omen that he or she will be married
before another harvest. For that or other reasons there is a strife
between the reapers as to who shall get the Maiden, and they resort to
various stratagems for the purpose of securing it. One of them, for
example, will often leave a handful of corn uncut and cover it up with
earth to hide it from the other reapers, till all the rest of the corn
on the field is cut down. Several may try to play the same trick, and
the one who is coolest and holds out longest obtains the coveted
distinction. When it has been cut, the Maiden is dressed with ribbons
into a sort of doll and affixed to a wall of the farmhouse. In the north
of Scotland the Maiden is carefully preserved till Yule morning, when it
is divided among the cattle “to make them thrive all the year round.” In
the neighbourhood of Balquhidder, Perthshire, the last handful of corn
is cut by the youngest girl on the field, and is made into the rude form
of a female doll, clad in a paper dress, and decked with ribbons. It is
called the Maiden, and is kept in the farmhouse, generally above the
chimney, for a good while, sometimes till the Maiden of the next year is
brought in. The writer of this book witnessed the ceremony of cutting
the Maiden at Balquhidder in September 1888. A lady friend informed me
that as a young girl she cut the Maiden several times at the request of
the reapers in the neighbourhood of Perth. The name of the Maiden was
given to the last handful of standing corn; a reaper held the top of the
bunch while she cut it. Afterwards the bunch was plaited, decked with
ribbons, and hung up in a conspicuous place on the wall of the kitchen
till the next Maiden was brought in. The harvest-supper in this
neighbourhood was also called the Maiden; the reapers danced at it.   22

  On some farms on the Gareloch, in Dumbartonshire, about the year 1830,
the last handful of standing corn was called the Maiden. It was divided
in two, plaited, and then cut with the sickle by a girl, who, it was
thought, would be lucky and would soon be married. When it was cut the
reapers gathered together and threw their sickles in the air. The Maiden
was dressed with ribbons and hung in the kitchen near the roof, where it
was kept for several years with the date attached. Sometimes five or six
Maidens might be seen hanging at once on hooks. The harvest-supper was
called the Kirn. In other farms on the Gareloch the last handful of corn
was called the Maidenhead or the Head; it was neatly plaited, sometimes
decked with ribbons, and hung in the kitchen for a year, when the grain
was given to the poultry.   23

  In Aberdeenshire “the last sheaf cut, or ‘Maiden,’ is carried home in
merry procession by the harvesters. It is then presented to the mistress
of the house, who dresses it up to be preserved till the first mare
foals. The Maiden is then taken down and presented to the mare as its
first food. The neglect of this would have untoward effects upon the
foal, and disastrous consequences upon farm operations generally for the
season.” In the north-east of Aberdeenshire the last sheaf is commonly
called the clyack sheaf. It used to be cut by the youngest girl present
and was dressed as a woman. Being brought home in triumph, it was kept
till Christmas morning, and then given to a mare in foal, if there was
one on the farm, or, if there was not, to the oldest cow in calf.
Elsewhere the sheaf was divided between all the cows and their calves or
between all the horses and the cattle of the farm. In Fifeshire the last
handful of corn, known as the Maiden, is cut by a young girl and made
into the rude figure of a doll, tied with ribbons, by which it is hung
on the wall of the farm-kitchen till the next spring. The custom of
cutting the Maiden at harvest was also observed in Inverness-shire and
Sutherlandshire.   24

  A somewhat maturer but still youthful age is assigned to the
corn-spirit by the appellations of Bride, Oats-bride, and Wheat-bride,
which in Germany are sometimes bestowed both on the last sheaf and on
the woman who binds it. At wheat-harvest near Müglitz, in Moravia, a
small portion of the wheat is left standing after all the rest has been
reaped. This remnant is then cut, amid the rejoicing of the reapers, by
a young girl who wears a wreath of wheaten ears on her head and goes by
the name of the Wheat-bride. It is supposed that she will be a real
bride that same year. Near Roslin and Stonehaven, in Scotland, the last
handful of corn cut “got the name of ‘the bride,’ and she was placed
over the bress or chimney-piece; she had a ribbon tied below her
numerous ears, and another round her waist.”   25

  Sometimes the idea implied by the name of Bride is worked out more
fully by representing the productive powers of vegetation as bride and
bridegroom. Thus in the Vorharz an Oats-man and an Oats-woman, swathed
in straw, dance at the harvest feast. In South Saxony an Oats-bridegroom
and an Oats-bride figure together at the harvest celebration. The
Oats-bridegroom is a man completely wrapt in oats-straw; the Oats-bride
is a man dressed in woman’s clothes, but not wrapt in straw. They are
drawn in a waggon to the ale-house, where the dance takes place. At the
beginning of the dance the dancers pluck the bunches of oats one by one
from the Oats-bridegroom, while he struggles to keep them, till at last
he is completely stript of them and stands bare, exposed to the laughter
and jests of the company. In Austrian Silesia the ceremony of “the
Wheat-bride” is celebrated by the young people at the end of the
harvest. The woman who bound the last sheaf plays the part of the
Wheat-bride, wearing the harvest-crown of wheat ears and flowers on her
head. Thus adorned, standing beside her Bridegroom in a waggon and
attended by bridesmaids, she is drawn by a pair of oxen, in full
imitation of a marriage procession, to the tavern, where the dancing is
kept up till morning. Somewhat later in the season the wedding of the
Oats-bride is celebrated with the like rustic pomp. About Neisse, in
Silesia, an Oats-king and an Oats-queen, dressed up quaintly as a bridal
pair, are seated on a harrow and drawn by oxen into the village.   26

  In these last instances the corn-spirit is personified in double form
as male and female. But sometimes the spirit appears in a double female
form as both old and young, corresponding exactly to the Greek Demeter
and Persephone, if my interpretation of these goddesses is right. We
have seen that in Scotland, especially among the Gaelic-speaking
population, the last corn cut is sometimes called the Old Wife and
sometimes the Maiden. Now there are parts of Scotland in which both an
Old Wife (Cailleach) and a Maiden are cut at harvest. The accounts of
this custom are not quite clear and consistent, but the general rule
seems to be that, where both a Maiden and an Old Wife (Cailleach) are
fashioned out of the reaped corn at harvest, the Maiden is made out of
the last stalks left standing, and is kept by the farmer on whose land
it was cut; while the Old Wife is made out of other stalks, sometimes
out of the first stalks cut, and is regularly passed on to a laggard
farmer who happens to be still reaping after his brisker neighbour has
cut all his corn. Thus while each farmer keeps his own Maiden, as the
embodiment of the young and fruitful spirit of the corn, he passes on
the Old Wife as soon as he can to a neighbour, and so the old lady may
make the round of all the farms in the district before she finds a place
in which to lay her venerable head. The farmer with whom she finally
takes up her abode is of course the one who has been the last of all the
countryside to finish reaping his crops, and thus the distinction of
entertaining her is rather an invidious one. He is thought to be doomed
to poverty or to be under the obligation of “providing for the dearth of
the township” in the ensuing season. Similarly we saw that in
Pembrokeshire, where the last corn cut is called, not the Maiden, but
the Hag, she is passed on hastily to a neighbour who is still at work in
his fields and who receives his aged visitor with anything but a
transport of joy. If the Old Wife represents the corn-spirit of the past
year, as she probably does wherever she is contrasted with and opposed
to a Maiden, it is natural enough that her faded charms should have less
attractions for the husbandman than the buxom form of her daughter, who
may be expected to become in her turn the mother of the golden grain
when the revolving year has brought round another autumn. The same
desire to get rid of the effete Mother of the Corn by palming her off on
other people comes out clearly in some of the customs observed at the
close of threshing, particularly in the practice of passing on a hideous
straw puppet to a neighbour farmer who is still threshing his corn.   27

  The harvest customs just described are strikingly analogous to the
spring customs which we reviewed in an earlier part of this work. (1) As
in the spring customs the tree-spirit is represented both by a tree and
by a person, so in the harvest customs the corn-spirit is represented
both by the last sheaf and by the person who cuts or binds or threshes
it. The equivalence of the person to the sheaf is shown by giving him or
her the same name as the sheaf; by wrapping him or her in it; and by the
rule observed in some places, that when the sheaf is called the Mother,
it must be made up into human shape by the oldest married woman, but
that when it is called the Maiden, it must be cut by the youngest girl.
Here the age of the personal representative of the corn-spirit
corresponds with that of the supposed age of the corn-spirit, just as
the human victims offered by the Mexicans to promote the growth of the
maize varied with the age of the maize. For in the Mexican, as in the
European, custom the human beings were probably representatives of the
corn-spirit rather than victims offered to it. (2) Again the same
fertilising influence which the tree-spirit is supposed to exert over
vegetation, cattle, and even women is ascribed to the corn-spirit. Thus,
its supposed influence on vegetation is shown by the practice of taking
some of the grain of the last sheaf (in which the corn-spirit is
regularly supposed to be present), and scattering it among the young
corn in spring or mixing it with the seed-corn. Its influence on animals
is shown by giving the last sheaf to a mare in foal, to a cow in calf,
and to horses at the first ploughing. Lastly, its influence on women is
indicated by the custom of delivering the Mother-sheaf, made into the
likeness of a pregnant woman, to the farmer’s wife; by the belief that
the woman who binds the last sheaf will have a child next year; perhaps,
too, by the idea that the person who gets it will soon be married.   28

  Plainly, therefore, these spring and harvest customs are based on the
same ancient modes of thought, and form parts of the same primitive
heathendom, which was doubtless practised by our forefathers long before
the dawn of history. Amongst the marks of a primitive ritual we may note
the following:   29

  1. No special class of persons is set apart for the performance of the
rites; in other words, there are no priests. The rites may be performed
by any one, as occasion demands.   30

  2. No special places are set apart for the performance of the rites;
in other words, there are no temples. The rites may be performed
anywhere, as occasion demands.   31

  3. Spirits, not gods, are recognised. (a) As distinguished from gods,
spirits are restricted in their operations to definite departments of
nature. Their names are general, not proper. Their attributes are
generic, rather than individual; in other words, there is an indefinite
number of spirits of each class, and the individuals of a class are all
much alike; they have no definitely marked individuality; no accepted
traditions are current as to their origin, life, adventures, and
character. (b) On the other hand gods, as distinguished from spirits,
are not restricted to definite departments of nature. It is true that
there is generally some one department over which they preside as their
special province; but they are not rigorously confined to it; they can
exert their power for good or evil in many other spheres of nature and
life. Again, they bear individual or proper names, such as Demeter,
Persephone, Dionysus; and their individual characters and histories are
fixed by current myths and the representations of art.   32

  4. The rites are magical rather than propitiatory. In other words, the
desired objects are attained, not by propitiating the favour of divine
beings through sacrifice, prayer, and praise, but by ceremonies which,
as I have already explained, are believed to influence the course of
nature directly through a physical sympathy or resemblance between the
rite and the effect which it is the intention of the rite to
produce.   33

  Judged by these tests, the spring and harvest customs of our European
peasantry deserve to rank as primitive. For no special class of persons
and no special places are set exclusively apart for their performance;
they may be performed by any one, master or man, mistress or maid, boy
or girl; they are practised, not in temples or churches, but in the
woods and meadows, beside brooks, in barns, on harvest fields and
cottage floors. The supernatural beings whose existence is taken for
granted in them are spirits rather than deities: their functions are
limited to certain well-defined departments of nature: their names are
general like the Barley-mother, the Old Woman, the Maiden, not proper
names like Demeter, Persephone, Dionysus. Their generic attributes are
known, but their individual histories and characters are not the subject
of myths. For they exist in classes rather than as individuals, and the
members of each class are indistinguishable. For example, every farm has
its Corn-mother, or its Old Woman, or its Maiden; but every Corn-mother
is much like every other Corn-mother, and so with the Old Women and
Maidens. Lastly, in these harvests, as in the spring customs, the ritual
is magical rather than propitiatory. This is shown by throwing the
Corn-mother into the river in order to secure rain and dew for the
crops; by making the Old Woman heavy in order to get a heavy crop next
year; by strewing grain from the last sheaf amongst the young crops in
spring; and by giving the last sheaf to the cattle to make them
thrive.   34
