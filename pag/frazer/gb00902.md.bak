# Chapter 9. The Worship of Trees.

## Section 2. Beneficent Powers of Tree-Spirits.

WHEN a tree comes to be viewed, no longer as the body of the
tree-spirit, but simply as its abode which it can quit at pleasure, an
important advance has been made in religious thought. Animism is passing
into polytheism. In other words, instead of regarding each tree as a
living and conscious being, man now sees in it merely a lifeless, inert
mass, tenanted for a longer or shorter time by a supernatural being who,
as he can pass freely from tree to tree, thereby enjoys a certain right
of possession or lordship over the trees, and, ceasing to be a
tree-soul, becomes a forest god. As soon as the tree-spirit is thus in a
measure disengaged from each particular tree, he begins to change his
shape and assume the body of a man, in virtue of a general tendency of
early thought to clothe all abstract spiritual beings in concrete human
form. Hence in classical art the sylvan deities are depicted in human
shape, their woodland character being denoted by a branch or some
equally obvious symbol. But this change of shape does not affect the
essential character of the tree-spirit. The powers which he exercised as
a tree-soul incorporate in a tree, he still continues to wield as a god
of trees. This I shall now attempt to prove in detail. I shall show,
first, that trees considered as animate beings are credited with the
power of making the rain to fall, the sun to shine, flocks and herds to
multiply, and women to bring forth easily; and, second, that the very
same powers are attributed to tree-gods conceived as anthropomorphic
beings or as actually incarnate in living men.   1

  First, then, trees or tree-spirits are believed to give rain and
sunshine. When the missionary Jerome of Prague was persuading the
heathen Lithuanians to fell their sacred groves, a multitude of women
besought the Prince of Lithuania to stop him, saying that with the woods
he was destroying the house of god from which they had been wont to get
rain and sunshine. The Mundaris in Assam think that if a tree in the
sacred grove is felled the sylvan gods evince their displeasure by
withholding rain. In order to procure rain the inhabitants of Monyo, a
village in the Sagaing district of Upper Burma, chose the largest
tamarind-tree near the village and named it the haunt of the spirit
(nat) who controls the rain. Then they offered bread, coco-nuts,
plantains, and fowls to the guardian spirit of the village and to the
spirit who gives rain, and they prayed, “O Lord nat have pity on us poor
mortals, and stay not the rain. Inasmuch as our offering is given
ungrudgingly, let the rain fall day and night.” Afterwards libations
were made in honour of the spirit of the tamarind-tree; and still later
three elderly women, dressed in fine clothes and wearing necklaces and
earrings, sang the Rain Song.   2

  Again, tree-spirits make the crops to grow. Amongst the Mundaris every
village has its sacred grove, and “the grove deities are held
responsible for the crops, and are especially honoured at all the great
agricultural festivals.” The negroes of the Gold Coast are in the habit
of sacrificing at the foot of certain tall trees, and they think that if
one of these were felled all the fruits of the earth would perish. The
Gallas dance in couples round sacred trees, praying for a good harvest.
Every couple consists of a man and woman, who are linked together by a
stick, of which each holds one end. Under their arms they carry green
corn or grass. Swedish peasants stick a leafy branch in each furrow of
their corn-fields, believing that this will ensure an abundant crop. The
same idea comes out in the German and French custom of the Harvest-May.
This is a large branch or a whole tree, which is decked with ears of
corn, brought home on the last waggon from the harvest-field, and
fastened on the roof of the farmhouse or of the barn, where it remains
for a year. Mannhardt has proved that this branch or tree embodies the
tree-spirit conceived as the spirit of vegetation in general, whose
vivifying and fructifying influence is thus brought to bear upon the
corn in particular. Hence in Swabia the Harvest-May is fastened amongst
the last stalks of corn left standing on the field; in other places it
is planted on the corn-field and the last sheaf cut is attached to its
trunk.   3

  Again, the tree-spirit makes the herds to multiply and blesses women
with offspring. In Northern India the Emblica officinalis is a sacred
tree. On the eleventh of the month Phalgun (February) libations are
poured at the foot of the tree, a red or yellow string is bound about
the trunk, and prayers are offered to it for the fruitfulness of women,
animals, and crops. Again, in Northern India the coco-nut is esteemed
one of the most sacred fruits, and is called Sriphala, or the fruit of
Sri, the goddess of prosperity. It is the symbol of fertility, and all
through Upper India is kept in shrines and presented by the priests to
women who desire to become mothers. In the town of Qua, near Old
Calabar, there used to grow a palm-tree which ensured conception to any
barren woman who ate a nut from its branches. In Europe the May-tree or
May-pole is apparently supposed to possess similar powers over both
women and cattle. Thus in some parts of Germany on the first of May the
peasants set up May-trees or May-bushes at the doors of stables and
byres, one for each horse and cow; this is thought to make the cows
yield much milk. Of the Irish we are told that “they fancy a green bough
of a tree, fastened on May-day against the house, will produce plenty of
milk that summer.”   4

  On the second of July some of the Wends used to set up an oak-tree in
the middle of the village with an iron cock fastened to its top; then
they danced round it, and drove the cattle round it to make them thrive.
The Circassians regard the pear-tree as the protector of cattle. So they
cut down a young pear-tree in the forest, branch it, and carry it home,
where it is adored as a divinity. Almost every house has one such
pear-tree. In autumn, on the day of the festival, the tree is carried
into the house with great ceremony to the sound of music and amid the
joyous cries of all the inmates, who compliment it on its fortunate
arrival. It is covered with candles, and a cheese is fastened to its
top. Round about it they eat, drink, and sing. Then they bid the tree
good-bye and take it back to the courtyard, where it remains for the
rest of the year, set up against the wall, without receiving any mark of
respect.   5

  In the Tuhoe tribe of Maoris “the power of making women fruitful is
ascribed to trees. These trees are associated with the navel-strings of
definite mythical ancestors, as indeed the navel-strings of all children
used to be hung upon them down to quite recent times. A barren woman had
to embrace such a tree with her arms, and she received a male or a
female child according as she embraced the east or the west side.” The
common European custom of placing a green bush on May Day before or on
the house of a beloved maiden probably originated in the belief of the
fertilising power of the tree-spirit. In some parts of Bavaria such
bushes are set up also at the houses of newly-married pairs, and the
practice is only omitted if the wife is near her confinement; for in
that case they say that the husband has “set up a May-bush for himself.”
Among the South Slavonians a barren woman, who desires to have a child,
places a new chemise upon a fruitful tree on the eve of St. George’s
Day. Next morning before sunrise she examines the garment, and if she
finds that some living creature has crept on it, she hopes that her wish
will be fulfilled within the year. Then she puts on the chemise,
confident that she will be as fruitful as the tree on which the garment
has passed the night. Among the Kara-Kirghiz barren women roll
themselves on the ground under a solitary apple-tree, in order to obtain
offspring. Lastly, the power of granting to women an easy delivery at
child-birth is ascribed to trees both in Sweden and Africa. In some
districts of Sweden there was formerly a bardträd or guardian-tree
(lime, ash, or elm) in the neighbourhood of every farm. No one would
pluck a single leaf of the sacred tree, any injury to which was punished
by ill-luck or sickness. Pregnant women used to clasp the tree in their
arms in order to ensure an easy delivery. In some negro tribes of the
Congo region pregnant women make themselves garments out of the bark of
a certain sacred tree, because they believe that this tree delivers them
from the dangers that attend child-bearing. The story that Leto clasped
a palm-tree and an olive-tree or two laurel-trees, when she was about to
give birth to the divine twins Apollo and Artemis, perhaps points to a
similar Greek belief in the efficacy of certain trees to facilitate
delivery.   6
