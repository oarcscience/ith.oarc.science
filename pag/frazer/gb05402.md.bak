# Chapter 54. Types of Animal Sacrament.

## Section 2. Processions with Sacred Animals.

THE FORM of communion in which the sacred animal is taken from house to
house, that all may enjoy a share of its divine influence, has been
exemplified by the Gilyak custom of promenading the bear through the
village before it is slain. A similar form of communion with the sacred
snake is observed by a Snake tribe in the Punjaub. Once a year in the
month of September the snake is worshipped by all castes and religions
for nine days only. At the end of August the Mirasans, especially those
of the Snake tribe, make a snake of dough which they paint black and
red, and place on a winnowing basket. This basket they carry round the
village, and on entering any house they say: “God be with you all! May
every ill be far! May our patron’s (Gugga’s) word thrive!” Then they
present the basket with the snake, saying: “A small cake of flour: a
little bit of butter: if you obey the snake, you and yours shall
thrive!” Strictly speaking, a cake and butter should be given, but it is
seldom done. Every one, however, gives something, generally a handful of
dough or some corn. In houses where there is a new bride or whence a
bride has gone, or where a son has been born, it is usual to give a
rupee and a quarter, or some cloth. Sometimes the bearers of the snake
also sing:

“Give the snake a piece of cloth, and he will send a lively bride!” 

When every house has been thus visited, the dough snake is buried and a
small grave is erected over it. Thither during the nine days of
September the women come to worship. They bring a basin of curds, a
small portion of which they offer at the snake’s grave, kneeling on the
ground and touching the earth with their foreheads. Then they go home
and divide the rest of the curds among the children. Here the dough
snake is clearly a substitute for a real snake. Indeed, in districts
where snakes abound the worship is offered, not at the grave of the
dough snake, but in the jungles where snakes are known to be. Besides
this yearly worship, performed by all the people, the members of the
Snake tribe worship in the same way every morning after a new moon. The
Snake tribe is not uncommon in the Punjaub. Members of it will not kill
a snake, and they say that its bite does not hurt them. If they find a
dead snake, they put clothes on it and give it a regular funeral.   1

  Ceremonies closely analogous to this Indian worship of the snake have
survived in Europe into recent times, and doubtless date from a very
primitive paganism. The best-known example is the “hunting of the wren.”
By many European peoples—the ancient Greeks and Romans, the modern
Italians, Spaniards, French, Germans, Dutch, Danes, Swedes, English, and
Welsh—the wren has been designated the king, the little king, the king
of birds, the hedge king, and so forth, and has been reckoned amongst
those birds which it is extremely unlucky to kill. In England it is
supposed that if any one kills a wren or harries its nest, he will
infallibly break a bone or meet with some dreadful misfortune within the
year; sometimes it is thought that the cows will give bloody milk. In
Scotland the wren is called “the Lady of Heaven’s hen,” and boys say:

“Malisons, malisons, mair than ten,

That harry the Ladye of Heaven’s hen!” 

At Saint Donan, in Brittany, people believe that if children touch the
young wrens in the nest, they will suffer from the fire of St. Lawrence,
that is, from pimples on the face, legs, and so on. In other parts of
France it is thought that if a person kills a wren or harries its nest,
his house will be struck by lightning, or that the fingers with which he
did the deed will shrivel up and drop off, or at least be maimed, or
that his cattle will suffer in their feet.   2

  Notwithstanding such beliefs, the custom of annually killing the wren
has prevailed widely both in this country and in France. In the Isle of
Man down to the eighteenth century the custom was observed on Christmas
Eve, or rather Christmas morning. On the twenty-fourth of December,
towards evening, all the servants got a holiday; they did not go to bed
all night, but rambled about till the bells rang in all the churches at
midnight. When prayers were over, they went to hunt the wren, and having
found one of these birds they killed it and fastened it to the top of a
long pole with its wings extended. Thus they carried it in procession to
every house chanting the following rhyme:

“We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin,

We hunted the wren for Jack of the Can,

We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin,

We hunted the wren for every one.” 

When they had gone from house to house and collected all the money they
could, they laid the wren on a bier and carried it in procession to the
parish churchyard, where they made a grave and buried it “with the
utmost solemnity, singing dirges over her in the Manks language, which
they call her knell; after which Christmas begins.” The burial over, the
company outside the churchyard formed a circle and danced to music.   3

  A writer of the eighteenth century says that in Ireland the wren “is
still hunted and killed by the peasants on Christmas Day, and on the
following (St. Stephen’s Day) he is carried about, hung by the leg, in
the centre of two hoops, crossing each other at right angles, and a
procession made in every village, of men, women, and children, singing
an Irish catch, importing him to be the king of all birds.” Down to the
present time the “hunting of the wren” still takes place in parts of
Leinster and Connaught. On Christmas Day or St. Stephen’s Day the boys
hunt and kill the wren, fasten it in the middle of a mass of holly and
ivy on the top of a broomstick, and on St. Stephen’s Day go about with
it from house to house, singing:

“The wren, the wren, the king of all birds,

St. Stephen’s Day was caught in the furze;

Although he is little, his family’s great,

I pray you, good landlady, give us a treat.” 

Money or food (bread, butter, eggs, etc.) were given them, upon which
they feasted in the evening.   4

  In the first half of the nineteenth century similar customs were still
observed in various parts of the south of France. Thus at Carcassone,
every year on the first Sunday of December the young people of the
street Saint Jean used to go out of the town armed with sticks, with
which they beat the bushes, looking for wrens. The first to strike down
one of these birds was proclaimed King. Then they returned to the town
in procession, headed by the King, who carried the wren on a pole. On
the evening of the last day of the year the King and all who had hunted
the wren marched through the streets of the town to the light of
torches, with drums beating and fifes playing in front of them. At the
door of every house they stopped, and one of them wrote with chalk on
the door vive le roi! with the number of the year which was about to
begin. On the morning of Twelfth Day the King again marched in
procession with great pomp, wearing a crown and a blue mantle and
carrying a sceptre. In front of him was borne the wren fastened to the
top of a pole, which was adorned with a verdant wreath of olive, of oak,
and sometimes of mistletoe grown on an oak. After hearing high mass in
the parish church of St. Vincent, surrounded by his officers and guards,
the King visited the bishop, the mayor, the magistrates, and the chief
inhabitants, collecting money to defray the expenses of the royal
banquet which took place in the evening and wound up with a dance.   5

  The parallelism between this custom of “hunting the wren” and some of
those which we have considered, especially the Gilyak procession with
the bear, and the Indian one with the snake, seems too close to allow us
to doubt that they all belong to the same circle of ideas. The
worshipful animal is killed with special solemnity once a year; and
before or immediately after death he is promenaded from door to door,
that each of his worshippers may receive a portion of the divine virtues
that are supposed to emanate from the dead or dying god. Religious
processions of this sort must have had a great place in the ritual of
European peoples in prehistoric times, if we may judge from the numerous
traces of them which have survived in folk-custom. For example, on the
last day of the year, or Hogmanay as it was called, it used to be
customary in the Highlands of Scotland for a man to dress himself up in
a cow’s hide and thus attired to go from house to house, attended by
young fellows, each of them armed with a staff, to which a bit of raw
hide was tied. Round every house the hide-clad man used to run thrice
deiseal, that is, according to the course of the sun, so as to keep the
house on his right hand; while the others pursued him, beating the hide
with their staves and thereby making a loud noise like the beating of a
drum. In this disorderly procession they also struck the walls of the
house. On being admitted, one of the party, standing within the
threshold, pronounced a blessing on the family in these words: “May God
bless the house and all that belongs to it, cattle, stones, and timber!
In plenty of meat, of bed and body clothes, and health of men may it
ever abound!” Then each of the party singed in the fire a little bit of
the hide which was tied to his staff; and having done so he applied the
singed hide to the nose of every person and of every domestic animal
belonging to the house. This was imagined to secure them from diseases
and other misfortunes, particularly from witchcraft, throughout the
ensuing year. The whole ceremony was called calluinn because of the
great noise made in beating the hide. It was observed in the Hebrides,
including St. Kilda, down to the second half of the eighteenth century
at least, and it seems to have survived well into the nineteenth
century.   6
