# Chapter 49. Ancient Deities of Vegetation as Animals.

## Section 4. Osiris, the Pig and the Bull.

IN ANCIENT Egypt, within historical times, the pig occupied the same
dubious position as in Syria and Palestine, though at first sight its
uncleanness is more prominent than its sanctity. The Egyptians are
generally said by Greek writers to have abhorred the pig as a foul and
loathsome animal. If a man so much as touched a pig in passing, he
stepped into the river with all his clothes on, to wash off the taint.
To drink pig’s milk was believed to cause leprosy to the drinker.
Swineherds, though natives of Egypt, were forbidden to enter any temple,
and they were the only men who were thus excluded. No one would give his
daughter in marriage to a swineherd, or marry a swineherd’s daughter;
the swineherds married among themselves. Yet once a year the Egyptians
sacrificed pigs to the moon and to Osiris, and not only sacrificed them,
but ate of their flesh, though on any other day of the year they would
neither sacrifice them nor taste of their flesh. Those who were too poor
to offer a pig on this day baked cakes of dough, and offered them
instead. This can hardly be explained except by the supposition that the
pig was a sacred animal which was eaten sacramentally by his worshippers
once a year.   1

  The view that in Egypt the pig was sacred is borne out by the very
facts which, to moderns, might seem to prove the contrary. Thus the
Egyptians thought, as we have seen, that to drink pig’s milk produced
leprosy. But exactly analogous views are held by savages about the
animals and plants which they deem most sacred. Thus in the island of
Wetar (between New Guinea and Celebes) people believe themselves to be
variously descended from wild pigs, serpents, crocodiles, turtles, dogs,
and eels; a man may not eat an animal of the kind from which he is
descended; if he does so, he will become a leper, and go mad. Amongst
the Omaha Indians of North America men whose totem is the elk, believe
that if they ate the flesh of the male elk they would break out in boils
and white spots in different parts of their bodies. In the same tribe
men whose totem is the red maize, think that if they ate red maize they
would have running sores all round their mouths. The Bush negroes of
Surinam, who practise totemism, believe that if they ate the capiaï (an
animal like a pig) it would give them leprosy; perhaps the capiaï is one
of their totems. The Syrians, in antiquity, who esteemed fish sacred,
thought that if they ate fish their bodies would break out in ulcers,
and their feet and stomach would swell up. The Chasas of Orissa believe
that if they were to injure their totemic animal they would be attacked
by leprosy and their line would die out. These examples prove that the
eating of a sacred animal is often believed to produce leprosy or other
skin-diseases; so far, therefore, they support the view that the pig
must have been sacred in Egypt, since the effect of drinking its milk
was believed to be leprosy.   2

  Again, the rule that, after touching a pig, a man had to wash himself
and his clothes, also favours the view of the sanctity of the pig. For
it is a common belief that the effect of contact with a sacred object
must be removed, by washing or otherwise, before a man is free to mingle
with his fellows. Thus the Jews wash their hands after reading the
sacred scriptures. Before coming forth from the tabernacle after the
sin-offering, the high priest had to wash himself, and put off the
garments which he had worn in the holy place. It was a rule of Greek
ritual that, in offering an expiatory sacrifice, the sacrificer should
not touch the sacrifice, and that, after the offering was made, he must
wash his body and his clothes in a river or spring before he could enter
a city or his own house. The Polynesians felt strongly the need of
ridding themselves of the sacred contagion, if it may be so called,
which they caught by touching sacred objects. Various ceremonies were
performed for the purpose of removing this contagion. We have seen, for
example, how in Tonga a man who happened to touch a sacred chief, or
anything personally belonging to him, had to perform a certain ceremony
before he could feed himself with his hands; otherwise it was believed
that he would swell up and die, or at least be afflicted with scrofula
or some other disease. We have seen, too, what fatal effects are
supposed to follow, and do actually follow, from contact with a sacred
object in New Zealand. In short, primitive man believes that what is
sacred is dangerous; it is pervaded by a sort of electrical sanctity
which communicates a shock to, even if it does not kill, whatever comes
in contact with it. Hence the savage is unwilling to touch or even to
see that which he deems peculiarly holy. Thus Bechuanas, of the
Crocodile clan, think it “hateful and unlucky” to meet or see a
crocodile; the sight is thought to cause inflammation of the eyes. Yet
the crocodile is their most sacred object; they call it their father,
swear by it, and celebrate it in their festivals. The goat is the sacred
animal of the Madenassana Bushmen; yet “to look upon it would be to
render the man for the time impure, as well as to cause him undefined
uneasiness.” The Elk clan, among the Omaha Indians, believe that even to
touch the male elk would be followed by an eruption of boils and white
spots on the body. Members of the Reptile clan in the same tribe think
that if one of them touches or smells a snake, it will make his hair
white. In Samoa people whose god was a butterfly believed that if they
caught a butterfly it would strike them dead. Again, in Samoa the
reddish-seared leaves of the banana-tree were commonly used as plates
for handing food; but if any member of the Wild Pigeon family had used
banana leaves for this purpose, it was supposed that he would suffer
from rheumatic swellings or an eruption all over the body like
chicken-pox. The Mori clan of the Bhils in Central India worship the
peacock as their totem and make offerings of grain to it; yet members of
the clan believe that were they even to set foot on the tracks of a
peacock they would afterwards suffer from some disease, and if a woman
sees a peacock she must veil her face and look away. Thus the primitive
mind seems to conceive of holiness as a sort of dangerous virus, which a
prudent man will shun as far as possible, and of which, if he should
chance to be infected by it, he will carefully disinfect himself by some
form of ceremonial purification.   3

  In the light of these parallels the beliefs and customs of the
Egyptians touching the pig are probably to be explained as based upon an
opinion of the extreme sanctity rather than of the extreme uncleanness
of the animal; or rather, to put it more correctly, they imply that the
animal was looked on, not simply as a filthy and disgusting creature,
but as a being endowed with high supernatural powers, and that as such
it was regarded with that primitive sentiment of religious awe and fear
in which the feelings of reverence and abhorrence are almost equally
blended. The ancients themselves seem to have been aware that there was
another side to the horror with which swine seemed to inspire the
Egyptians. For the Greek astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus, who
resided fourteen months in Egypt and conversed with the priests, was of
opinion that the Egyptians spared the pig, not out of abhorrence, but
from a regard to its utility in agriculture; for, according to him, when
the Nile had subsided, herds of swine were turned loose over the fields
to tread the seed down into the moist earth. But when a being is thus
the object of mixed and implicitly contradictory feelings, he may be
said to occupy a position of unstable equilibrium. In course of time one
of the contradictory feelings is likely to prevail over the other, and
according as the feeling which finally predominates is that of reverence
or abhorrence, the being who is the object of it will rise into a god or
sink into a devil. The latter, on the whole, was the fate of the pig in
Egypt. For in historical times the fear and horror of the pig seem
certainly to have outweighed the reverence and worship of which he may
once have been the object, and of which, even in his fallen state, he
never quite lost trace. He came to be looked on as an embodiment of Set
or Typhon, the Egyptian devil and enemy of Osiris. For it was in the
shape of a black pig that Typhon injured the eye of the god Horus, who
burned him and instituted the sacrifice of the pig, the sun-god Ra
having declared the beast abominable. Again, the story that Typhon was
hunting a boar when he discovered and mangled the body of Osiris, and
that this was the reason why pigs were sacrificed once a year, is
clearly a modernised version of an older story that Osiris, like Adonis
and Attis, was slain or mangled by a boar, or by Typhon in the form of a
boar. Thus, the annual sacrifice of a pig to Osiris might naturally be
interpreted as vengeance inflicted on the hostile animal that had slain
or mangled the god. But, in the first place, when an animal is thus
killed as a solemn sacrifice once and once only in the year, it
generally or always means that the animal is divine, that he is spared
and respected the rest of the year as a god and slain, when he is slain,
also in the character of a god. In the second place, the examples of
Dionysus and Demeter, if not of Attis and Adonis, have taught us that
the animal which is sacrificed to a god on the ground that he is the
god’s enemy may have been, and probably was, originally the god himself.
Therefore, the annual sacrifice of a pig to Osiris, coupled with the
alleged hostility of the animal to the god, tends to show, first, that
originally the pig was a god, and, second, that he was Osiris. At a
later age, when Osiris became anthropomorphic and his original relation
to the pig had been forgotten, the animal was first distinguished from
him, and afterwards opposed as an enemy to him by mythologists who could
think of no reason for killing a beast in connexion with the worship of
a god except that the beast was the god’s enemy; or, as Plutarch puts
it, not that which is dear to the gods, but that which is the contrary,
is fit to be sacrificed. At this later stage the havoc which a wild boar
notoriously makes amongst the corn would supply a plausible reason for
regarding him as the foe of the corn-spirit, though originally, if I am
right, the very freedom with which the boar ranged at will through the
corn led people to identify him with the corn-spirit, to whom he was
afterwards opposed as an enemy.   4

  The view which identifies the pig with Osiris derives not a little
support from the sacrifice of pigs to him on the very day on which,
according to tradition, Osiris himself was killed; for thus the killing
of the pig was the annual representation of the killing of Osiris, just
as the throwing of the pigs into the caverns at the Thesmophoria was an
annual representation of the descent of Persephone into the lower world;
and both customs are parallel to the European practice of killing a
goat, cock, and so forth, at harvest as a representative of the
corn-spirit.   5

  Again, the theory that the pig, originally Osiris himself, afterwards
came to be regarded as an embodiment of his enemy Typhon, is supported
by the similar relation of red-haired men and red oxen to Typhon. For in
regard to the red-haired men who were burned and whose ashes were
scattered with winnowing-fans, we have seen fair grounds for believing
that originally, like the red-haired puppies killed at Rome in spring,
they were representatives of the corn-spirit himself that is, of Osiris,
and were slain for the express purpose of making the corn turn red or
golden. Yet at a later time these men were explained to be
representatives, not of Osiris, but of his enemy Typhon, and the killing
of them was regarded as an act of vengeance inflicted on the enemy of
the god. Similarly, the red oxen sacrificed by the Egyptians were said
to be offered on the ground of their resemblance to Typhon; though it is
more likely that originally they were slain on the ground of their
resemblance to the corn-spirit Osiris. We have seen that the ox is a
common representative of the corn-spirit and is slain as such on the
harvest-field.   6

  Osiris was regularly identified with the bull Apis of Memphis and the
bull Mnevis of Heliopolis. But it is hard to say whether these bulls
were embodiments of him as the corn-spirit, as the red oxen appear to
have been, or whether they were not in origin entirely distinct deities
who came to be fused with Osiris at a later time. The universality of
the worship of these two bulls seems to put them on a different footing
from the ordinary sacred animals whose worships were purely local. But
whatever the original relation of Apis to Osiris may have been, there is
one fact about the former which ought not to be passed over in a
disquisition on the custom of killing a god. Although the bull Apis was
worshipped as a god with much pomp and profound reverence, he was not
suffered to live beyond a certain length of time which was prescribed by
the sacred books, and on the expiry of which he was drowned in a holy
spring. The limit, according to Plutarch, was twenty-five years; but it
cannot always have been enforced, for the tombs of the Apis bulls have
been discovered in modern times, and from the inscriptions on them it
appears that in the twenty-second dynasty two of the holy steers lived
more than twenty-six years.   7
