# Chapter 5. The Magical Control of the Weather.

## Section 2. The Magical Control of Rain.

OF THE THINGS which the public magician sets himself to do for the good
of the tribe, one of the chief is to control the weather and especially
to ensure an adequate fall of rain. Water is an essential of life, and
in most countries the supply of it depends upon showers. Without rain
vegetation withers, animals and men languish and die. Hence in savage
communities the rain-maker is a very important personage; and often a
special class of magicians exists for the purpose of regulating the
heavenly water-supply. The methods by which they attempt to discharge
the duties of their office are commonly, though not always, based on the
principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic. If they wish to make rain
they simulate it by sprinkling water or mimicking clouds: if their
object is to stop rain and cause drought, they avoid water and resort to
warmth and fire for the sake of drying up the too abundant moisture.
Such attempts are by no means confined, as the cultivated reader might
imagine, to the naked inhabitants of those sultry lands like Central
Australia and some parts of Eastern and Southern Africa, where often for
months together the pitiless sun beats down out of a blue and cloudless
sky on the parched and gaping earth. They are, or used to be, common
enough among outwardly civilised folk in the moister climate of Europe.
I will now illustrate them by instances drawn from the practice both of
public and private magic.   1

  Thus, for example, in a village near Dorpat, in Russia, when rain was
much wanted, three men used to climb up the fir-trees of an old sacred
grove. One of them drummed with a hammer on a kettle or small cask to
imitate thunder; the second knocked two fire-brands together and made
the sparks fly, to imitate lightning; and the third, who was called “the
rain-maker,” had a bunch of twigs with which he sprinkled water from a
vessel on all sides. To put an end to drought and bring down rain, women
and girls of the village of Ploska are wont to go naked by night to the
boundaries of the village and there pour water on the ground. In
Halmahera, or Gilolo, a large island to the west of New Guinea, a wizard
makes rain by dipping a branch of a particular kind of tree in water and
then scattering the moisture from the dripping bough over the ground. In
New Britain the rain-maker wraps some leaves of a red and green striped
creeper in a banana-leaf, moistens the bundle with water, and buries it
in the ground; then he imitates with his mouth the plashing of rain.
Amongst the Omaha Indians of North America, when the corn is withering
for want of rain, the members of the sacred Buffalo Society fill a large
vessel with water and dance four times round it. One of them drinks some
of the water and spirts it into the air, making a fine spray in
imitation of a mist or drizzling rain. Then he upsets the vessel,
spilling the water on the ground; whereupon the dancers fall down and
drink up the water, getting mud all over their faces. Lastly, they
squirt the water into the air, making a fine mist. This saves the corn.
In spring-time the Natchez of North America used to club together to
purchase favourable weather for their crops from the wizards. If rain
was needed, the wizards fasted and danced with pipes full of water in
their mouths. The pipes were perforated like the nozzle of a
watering-can, and through the holes the rain-maker blew the water
towards that part of the sky where the clouds hung heaviest. But if fine
weather was wanted, he mounted the roof of his hut, and with extended
arms, blowing with all his might, he beckoned to the clouds to pass by.
When the rains do not come in due season the people of Central
Angoniland repair to what is called the rain-temple. Here they clear
away the grass, and the leader pours beer into a pot which is buried in
the ground, while he says, “Master Chauta, you have hardened your heart
towards us, what would you have us do? We must perish indeed. Give your
children the rains, there is the beer we have given you.” Then they all
partake of the beer that is left over, even the children being made to
sip it. Next they take branches of trees and dance and sing for rain.
When they return to the village they find a vessel of water set at the
doorway by an old woman; so they dip their branches in it and wave them
aloft, so as to scatter the drops. After that the rain is sure to come
driving up in heavy clouds. In these practices we see a combination of
religion with magic; for while the scattering of the water-drops by
means of branches is a purely magical ceremony, the prayer for rain and
the offering of beer are purely religious rites. In the Mara tribe of
Northern Australia the rain-maker goes to a pool and sings over it his
magic song. Then he takes some of the water in his hands, drinks it, and
spits it out in various directions. After that he throws water all over
himself, scatters it about, and returns quietly to the camp. Rain is
supposed to follow. The Arab historian Makrizi describes a method of
stopping rain which is said to have been resorted to by a tribe of
nomads called Alqamar in Hadramaut. They cut a branch from a certain
tree in the desert, set it on fire, and then sprinkled the burning brand
with water. After that the vehemence of the rain abated, just as the
water vanished when it fell on the glowing brand. Some of the Eastern
Angamis of Manipur are said to perform a some-what similar ceremony for
the opposite purpose, in order, namely, to produce rain. The head of the
village puts a burning brand on the grave of a man who has died of
burns, and quenches the brand with water, while he prays that rain may
fall. Here the putting out the fire with water, which is an imitation of
rain, is reinforced by the influence of the dead man, who, having been
burnt to death, will naturally be anxious for the descent of rain to
cool his scorched body and assuage his pangs.   2

  Other people besides the Arabs have used fire as a means of stopping
rain. Thus the Sulka of New Britain heat stones red hot in the fire and
then put them out in the rain, or they throw hot ashes in the air. They
think that the rain will soon cease to fall, for it does not like to be
burned by the hot stones or ashes. The Telugus send a little girl out
naked into the rain with a burning piece of wood in her hand, which she
has to show to the rain. That is supposed to stop the downpour. At Port
Stevens in New South Wales the medicine-men used to drive away rain by
throwing fire-sticks into the air, while at the same time they puffed
and shouted. Any man of the Anula tribe in Northern Australia can stop
rain by simply warming a green stick in the fire, and then striking it
against the wind.   3

  In time of severe drought the Dieri of Central Australia, loudly
lamenting the impoverished state of the country and their own
half-starved condition, call upon the spirits of their remote
predecessors, whom they call Mura-muras, to grant them power to make a
heavy rain-fall. For they believe that the clouds are bodies in which
rain is generated by their own ceremonies or those of neighbouring
tribes, through the influence of the Mura-muras. The way in which they
set about drawing rain from the clouds is this. A hole is dug about
twelve feet long and eight or ten broad, and over this hole a conical
hut of logs and branches is made. Two wizards, supposed to have received
a special inspiration from the Mura-muras, are bled by an old and
influential man with a sharp flint; and the blood, drawn from their arms
below the elbow, is made to flow on the other men of the tribe, who sit
huddled together in the hut. At the same time the two bleeding men throw
handfuls of down about, some of which adheres to the blood-stained
bodies of their comrades, while the rest floats in the air. The blood is
thought to represent the rain, and the down the clouds. During the
ceremony two large stones are placed in the middle of the hut; they
stand for gathering clouds and presage rain. Then the wizards who were
bled carry away the two stones for about ten or fifteen miles, and place
them as high as they can in the tallest tree. Meanwhile the other men
gather gypsum, pound it fine, and throw it into a water-hole. This the
Mura-muras see, and at once they cause clouds to appear in the sky.
Lastly, the men, young and old, surround the hut, and, stooping down,
butt at it with their heads, like so many rams. Thus they force their
way through it and reappear on the other side, repeating the process
till the hut is wrecked. In doing this they are forbidden to use their
hands or arms; but when the heavy logs alone remain, they are allowed to
pull them out with their hands. “The piercing of the hut with their
heads symbolises the piercing of the clouds; the fall of the hut, the
fall of the rain.” Obviously, too, the act of placing high up in trees
the two stones, which stand for clouds, is a way of making the real
clouds to mount up in the sky. The Dieri also imagine that the foreskins
taken from lads at circumcision have a great power of producing rain.
Hence the Great Council of the tribe always keeps a small stock of
foreskins ready for use. They are carefully concealed, being wrapt up in
feathers with the fat of the wild dog and of the carpet snake. A woman
may not see such a parcel opened on any account. When the ceremony is
over, the foreskin is buried, its virtue being exhausted. After the
rains have fallen, some of the tribe always undergo a surgical
operation, which consists in cutting the skin of their chest and arms
with a sharp flint. The wound is then tapped with a flat stick to
increase the flow of blood, and red ochre is rubbed into it. Raised
scars are thus produced. The reason alleged by the natives for this
practice is that they are pleased with the rain, and that there is a
connexion between the rain and the scars. Apparently the operation is
not very painful, for the patient laughs and jokes while it is going on.
Indeed, little children have been seen to crowd round the operator and
patiently take their turn; then after being operated on, they ran away,
expanding their little chests and singing for the rain to beat upon
them. However, they were not so well pleased next day, when they felt
their wounds stiff and sore. In Java, when rain is wanted, two men will
sometimes thrash each other with supple rods till the blood flows down
their backs; the streaming blood represents the rain, and no doubt is
supposed to make it fall on the ground. The people of Egghiou, a
district of Abyssinia, used to engage in sanguinary conflicts with each
other, village against village, for a week together every January for
the purpose of procuring rain. Some years ago the emperor Menelik
forbade the custom. However, the following year the rain was deficient,
and the popular outcry so great that the emperor yielded to it, and
allowed the murderous fights to be resumed, but for two days a year
only. The writer who mentions the custom regards the blood shed on these
occasions as a propitiatory sacrifice offered to spirits who control the
showers; but perhaps, as in the Australian and Javanese ceremonies, it
is an imitation of rain. The prophets of Baal, who sought to procure
rain by cutting themselves with knives till the blood gushed out, may
have acted on the same principle.   4

  There is a widespread belief that twin children possess magical powers
over nature, especially over rain and the weather. This curious
superstition prevails among some of the Indian tribes of British
Columbia, and has led them often to impose certain singular restrictions
or taboos on the parents of twins, though the exact meaning of these
restrictions is generally obscure. Thus the Tsimshian Indians of British
Columbia believe that twins control the weather; therefore they pray to
wind and rain, “Calm down, breath of the twins.” Further, they think
that the wishes of twins are always fulfilled; hence twins are feared,
because they can harm the man they hate. They can also call the salmon
and the olachen or candle-fish, and so they are known by a name which
means “making plentiful.” In the opinion of the Kwakiutl Indians of
British Columbia twins are transformed salmon; hence they may not go
near water, lest they should be changed back again into the fish. In
their childhood they can summon any wind by motions of their hands, and
they can make fair or foul weather, and also cure diseases by swinging a
large wooden rattle. The Nootka Indians of British Columbia also believe
that twins are somehow related to salmon. Hence among them twins may not
catch salmon, and they may not eat or even handle the fresh fish. They
can make fair or foul weather, and can cause rain to fall by painting
their faces black and then washing them, which may represent the rain
dripping from the dark clouds. The Shuswap Indians, like the Thompson
Indians, associate twins with the grizzly bear, for they call them
“young grizzly bears.” According to them, twins remain throughout life
endowed with supernatural powers. In particular they can make good or
bad weather. They produce rain by spilling water from a basket in the
air; they make fine weather by shaking a small flat piece of wood
attached to a stick by a string; they raise storms by strewing down on
the ends of spruce branches.   5

  The same power of influencing the weather is attributed to twins by
the Baronga, a tribe of Bantu negroes who, inhabit the shores of Delagoa
Bay in South-eastern Africa. They bestow the name of Tilo—that is, the
sky—on a woman who has given birth to twins, and the infants themselves
are called the children of the sky. Now when the storms which generally
burst in the months of September and October have been looked for in
vain, when a drought with its prospect of famine is threatening, and all
nature, scorched and burnt up by a sun that has shone for six months
from a cloudless sky, is panting for the beneficent showers of the South
African spring, the women perform ceremonies to bring down the
longed-for rain on the parched earth. Stripping themselves of all their
garments, they assume in their stead girdles and head-dresses of grass,
or short petticoats made of the leaves of a particular sort of creeper.
Thus attired, uttering peculiar cries and singing ribald songs, they go
about from well to well, cleansing them of the mud and impurities which
have accumulated in them. The wells, it may be said, are merely holes in
the sand where a little turbid unwholesome water stagnates. Further, the
women must repair to the house of one of their gossips who has given
birth to twins, and must drench her with water, which they carry in
little pitchers. Having done so they go on their way, shrieking out
their loose songs and dancing immodest dances. No man may see these
leaf-clad women going their rounds. If they meet a man, they maul him
and thrust him aside. When they have cleansed the wells, they must go
and pour water on the graves of their ancestors in the sacred grove. It
often happens, too, that at the bidding of the wizard they go and pour
water on the graves of twins. For they think that the grave of a twin
ought always to be moist, for which reason twins are regularly buried
near a lake. If all their efforts to procure rain prove abortive, they
will remember that such and such a twin was buried in a dry place on the
side of a hill. “No wonder,” says the wizard in such a case, “that the
sky is fiery. Take up his body and dig him a grave on the shore of the
lake.” His orders are at once obeyed, for this is supposed to be the
only means of bringing down the rain.   6

  Some of the foregoing facts strongly support an interpretation which
Professor Oldenberg has given of the rules to be observed by a Brahman
who would learn a particular hymn of the ancient Indian collection known
as the Samaveda. The hymn, which bears the name of the Sakvari¯ song,
was believed to embody the might of Indra’s weapon, the thunderbolt; and
hence, on account of the dreadful and dangerous potency with which it
was thus charged, the bold student who essayed to master it had to be
isolated from his fellow-men, and to retire from the village into the
forest. Here for a space of time, which might vary, according to
different doctors of the law, from one to twelve years, he had to
observe certain rules of life, among which were the following. Thrice a
day he had to touch water; he must wear black garments and eat black
food; when it rained, he might not seek the shelter of a roof, but had
to sit in the rain and say, “Water is the Sakvari¯ song”; when the
lightning flashed, he said, “That is like the Sakvari¯ song”; when the
thunder pealed, he said, “The Great One is making a great noise.” He
might never cross a running stream without touching water; he might
never set foot on a ship unless his life were in danger, and even then
he must be sure to touch water when he went on board; “for in water,” so
ran the saying, “lies the virtue of the Sakvari¯ song.” When at last he
was allowed to learn the song itself, he had to dip his hands in a
vessel of water in which plants of all sorts had been placed. If a man
walked in the way of all these precepts, the rain-god Parjanya, it was
said, would send rain at the wish of that man. It is clear, as Professor
Oldenberg well points out, that “all these rules are intended to bring
the Brahman into union with water, to make him, as it were, an ally of
the water powers, and to guard him against their hostility. The black
garments and the black food have the same significance; no one will
doubt that they refer to the rain-clouds when he remembers that a black
victim is sacrificed to procure rain; ‘it is black, for such is the
nature of rain.’ In respect of another rain-charm it is said plainly,
‘He puts on a black garment edged with black, for such is the nature of
rain.’ We may therefore assume that here in the circle of ideas and
ordinances of the Vedic schools there have been preserved magical
practices of the most remote antiquity, which were intended to prepare
the rain-maker for his office and dedicate him to it.”   7

  It is interesting to observe that where an opposite result is desired,
primitive logic enjoins the weather-doctor to observe precisely opposite
rules of conduct. In the tropical island of Java, where the rich
vegetation attests the abundance of the rainfall, ceremonies for the
making of rain are rare, but ceremonies for the prevention of it are not
uncommon. When a man is about to give a great feast in the rainy season
and has invited many people, he goes to a weather-doctor and asks him to
“prop up the clouds that may be lowering.” If the doctor consents to
exert his professional powers, he begins to regulate his behaviour by
certain rules as soon as his customer has departed. He must observe a
fast, and may neither drink nor bathe; what little he eats must be eaten
dry, and in no case may he touch water. The host, on his side, and his
servants, both male and female, must neither wash clothes nor bathe so
long as the feast lasts, and they have all during its continuance to
observe strict chastity. The doctor seats himself on a new mat in his
bedroom, and before a small oil-lamp he murmurs, shortly before the
feast takes place, the following prayer or incantation: “Grandfather and
Grandmother Sroekoel” (the name seems to be taken at random; others are
sometimes used), “return to your country. Akkemat is your country. Put
down your water-cask, close it properly, that not a drop may fall out.”
While he utters this prayer the sorcerer looks upwards, burning incense
the while. So among the Toradjas the rain-doctor, whose special business
it is to drive away rain, takes care not to touch water before, during,
or after the discharge of his professional duties. He does not bathe, he
eats with unwashed hands, he drinks nothing but palm wine, and if he has
to cross a stream he is careful not to step in the water. Having thus
prepared himself for his task he has a small hut built for himself
outside of the village in a rice-field, and in this hut he keeps up a
little fire, which on no account may be suffered to go out. In the fire
he burns various kinds of wood, which are supposed to possess the
property of driving off rain; and he puffs in the direction from which
the rain threatens to come, holding in his hand a packet of leaves and
bark which derive a similar cloud-compelling virtue, not from their
chemical composition, but from their names, which happen to signify
something dry or volatile. If clouds should appear in the sky while he
is at work, he takes lime in the hollow of his hand and blows it towards
them. The lime, being so very dry, is obviously well adapted to disperse
the damp clouds. Should rain afterwards be wanted, he has only to pour
water on his fire, and immediately the rain will descend in sheets.   8

  The reader will observe how exactly the Javanese and Toradja
observances, which are intended to prevent rain, form the antithesis of
the Indian observances, which aim at producing it. The Indian sage is
commanded to touch water thrice a day regularly as well as on various
special occasions; the Javanese and Toradja wizards may not touch it at
all. The Indian lives out in the forest, and even when it rains he may
not take shelter; the Javanese and the Toradja sit in a house or a hut.
The one signifies his sympathy with water by receiving the rain on his
person and speaking of it respectfully; the others light a lamp or a
fire and do their best to drive the rain away. Yet the principle on
which all three act is the same; each of them, by a sort of childish
make-believe, identifies himself with the phenomenon which he desires to
produce. It is the old fallacy that the effect resembles its cause: if
you would make wet weather, you must be wet; if you would make dry
weather, you must be dry.   9

  In South-eastern Europe at the present day ceremonies are observed for
the purpose of making rain which not only rest on the same general train
of thought as the preceding, but even in their details resemble the
ceremonies practised with the same intention by the Baronga of Delagoa
Bay. Among the Greeks of Thessaly and Macedonia, when a drought has
lasted a long time, it is customary to send a procession of children
round to all the wells and springs of the neighbourhood. At the head of
the procession walks a girl adorned with flowers, whom her companions
drench with water at every halting-place, while they sing an invocation,
of which the following is part:

“Perperia all fresh bedewed,

Freshen all the neighbourhood;

By the woods, on the highway,

As thou goest, to God now pray:

O my God, upon the plain,

Send thou us a still, small rain;

That the fields may fruitful be,

And vines in blossom we may see;

That the grain be full and sound,

And wealthy grow the folks around.”    10

  In time of drought the Serbians strip a girl to her skin and clothe
her from head to foot in grass, herbs, and flowers, even her face being
hidden behind a veil of living green. Thus disguised she is called the
Dodola, and goes through the village with a troop of girls. They stop
before every house; the Dodola keeps turning herself round and dancing,
while the other girls form a ring about her singing one of the Dodola
songs, and the housewife pours a pail of water over her. One of the
songs they sing runs thus:

“We go through the village;

The clouds go in the sky;

We go faster,

Faster go the clouds;

They have overtaken us,

And wetted the corn and the vine.”    11

  At Poona in India, when rain is needed, the boys dress up one of their
number in nothing but leaves and call him King of Rain. Then they go
round to every house in the village, where the house-holder or his wife
sprinkles the Rain King with water, and gives the party food of various
kinds. When they have thus visited all the houses, they strip the Rain
King of his leafy robes and feast upon what they have gathered.   12

  Bathing is practised as a rain-charm in some parts of Southern and
Western Russia. Sometimes after service in church the priest in his
robes has been thrown down on the ground and drenched with water by his
parishioners. Sometimes it is the women who, without stripping off their
clothes, bathe in crowds on the day of St. John the Baptist, while they
dip in the water a figure made of branches, grass, and herbs, which is
supposed to represent the saint. In Kursk, a province of Southern
Russia, when rain is much wanted, the women seize a passing stranger and
throw him into the river, or souse him from head to foot. Later on we
shall see that a passing stranger is often taken for a deity or the
personification of some natural power. It is recorded in official
documents that during a drought in 1790 the peasants of Scheroutz and
Werboutz collected all the women and compelled them to bathe, in order
that rain might fall. An Armenian rain-charm is to throw the wife of a
priest into the water and drench her. The Arabs of North Africa fling a
holy man, willy-nilly, into a spring as a remedy for drought. In
Minahassa, a province of North Celebes, the priest bathes as a
rain-charm. In Central Celebes when there has been no rain for a long
time and the rice-stalks begin to shrivel up, many of the villagers,
especially the young folk, go to a neighbouring brook and splash each
other with water, shouting noisily, or squirt water on one another
through bamboo tubes. Sometimes they imitate the plump of rain by
smacking the surface of the water with their hands, or by placing an
inverted gourd on it and drumming on the gourd with their fingers.   13

  Women are sometimes supposed to be able to make rain by ploughing, or
pretending to plough. Thus the Pshaws and Chewsurs of the Caucasus have
a ceremony called “ploughing the rain,” which they observe in time of
drought. Girls yoke themselves to a plough and drag it into a river,
wading in the water up to their girdles. In the same circumstances
Armenian girls and women do the same. The oldest woman, or the priest’s
wife, wears the priest’s dress, while the others, dressed as men, drag
the plough through the water against the stream. In the Caucasian
province of Georgia, when a drought has lasted long, marriageable girls
are yoked in couples with an ox-yoke on their shoulders, a priest holds
the reins, and thus harnessed they wade through rivers, puddles, and
marshes, praying, screaming, weeping, and laughing. In a district of
Transylvania when the ground is parched with drought, some girls strip
themselves naked, and, led by an older woman, who is also naked, they
steal a harrow and carry it across the fields to a brook, where they set
it afloat. Next they sit on the harrow and keep a tiny flame burning on
each corner of it for an hour. Then they leave the harrow in the water
and go home. A similar rain-charm is resorted to in some parts of India;
naked women drag a plough across a field by night, while the men keep
carefully out of the way, for their presence would break the spell.   14

  Sometimes the rain-charm operates through the dead. Thus in New
Caledonia the rain-makers blackened themselves all over, dug up a dead
body, took the bones to a cave, jointed them, and hung the skeleton over
some taro leaves. Water was poured over the skeleton to run down on the
leaves. They believed that the soul of the deceased took up the water,
converted it into rain, and showered it down again. In Russia, if common
report may be believed, it is not long since the peasants of any
district that chanced to be afflicted with drought used to dig up the
corpse of some one who had drunk himself to death and sink it in the
nearest swamp or lake, fully persuaded that this would ensure the fall
of the needed rain. In 1868 the prospect of a bad harvest, caused by a
prolonged drought, induced the inhabitants of a village in the
Tarashchansk district to dig up the body of a Raskolnik, or Dissenter,
who had died in the preceding December. Some of the party beat the
corpse, or what was left of it, about the head, exclaiming, “Give us
rain!” while others poured water on it through a sieve. Here the pouring
of water through a sieve seems plainly an imitation of a shower, and
reminds us of the manner in which Strepsiades in Aristophanes imagined
that rain was made by Zeus. Sometimes, in order to procure rain, the
Toradjas make an appeal to the pity of the dead. Thus, in the village of
Kalingooa, there is the grave of a famous chief, the grandfather of the
present ruler. When the land suffers from unseasonable drought, the
people go to this grave, pour water on it, and say, “O grandfather, have
pity on us; if it is your will that this year we should eat, then give
rain.” After that they hang a bamboo full of water over the grave; there
is a small hole in the lower end of the bamboo, so that the water drips
from it continually. The bamboo is always refilled with water until rain
drenches the ground. Here, as in New Caledonia, we find religion blent
with magic, for the prayer to the dead chief, which is purely religious,
is eked out with a magical imitation of rain at his grave. We have seen
that the Baronga of Delagoa Bay drench the tombs of their ancestors,
especially the tombs of twins, as a raincharm. Among some of the Indian
tribes in the region of the Orinoco it was customary for the relations
of a deceased person to disinter his bones a year after burial, burn
them, and scatter the ashes to the winds, because they believed that the
ashes were changed into rain, which the dead man sent in return for his
obsequies. The Chinese are convinced that when human bodies remain
unburied, the souls of their late owners feel the discomfort of rain,
just as living men would do if they were exposed without shelter to the
inclemency of the weather. These wretched souls, therefore, do all in
their power to prevent the rain from falling, and often their efforts
are only too successful. Then drought ensues, the most dreaded of all
calamities in China, because bad harvests, dearth, and famine follow in
its train. Hence it has been a common practice of the Chinese
authorities in time of drought to inter the dry bones of the unburied
dead for the purpose of putting an end to the scourge and conjuring down
the rain.   15

  Animals, again, often play an important part in these weather-charms.
The Anula tribe of Northern Australia associate the dollar-bird with
rain, and call it the rain-bird. A man who has the bird for his totem
can make rain at a certain pool. He catches a snake, puts it alive into
the pool, and after holding it under water for a time takes it out,
kills it, and lays it down by the side of the creek. Then he makes an
arched bundle of grass stalks in imitation of a rainbow, and sets it up
over the snake. After that all he does is to sing over the snake and the
mimic rainbow; sooner or later the rain will fall. They explain this
procedure by saying that long ago the dollar-bird had as a mate at this
spot a snake, who lived in the pool and used to make rain by spitting up
into the sky till a rainbow and clouds appeared and rain fell. A common
way of making rain in many parts of Java is to bathe a cat or two cats,
a male and a female; sometimes the animals are carried in procession
with music. Even in Batavia you may from time to time see children going
about with a cat for this purpose; when they have ducked it in a pool,
they let it go.   16

  Among the Wambugwe of East Africa, when the sorcerer desires to make
rain, he takes a black sheep and a black calf in bright sunshine, and
has them placed on the roof of the common hut in which the people live
together. Then he slits the stomachs of the animals and scatters their
contents in all directions. After that he pours water and medicine into
a vessel; if the charm has succeeded, the water boils up and rain
follows. On the other hand, if the sorcerer wishes to prevent rain from
falling, he withdraws into the interior of the hut, and there heats a
rock-crystal in a calabash. In order to procure rain the Wagogo
sacrifice black fowls, black sheep, and black cattle at the graves of
dead ancestors, and the rain-maker wears black clothes during the rainy
season. Among the Matabele the rain-charm employed by sorcerers was made
from the blood and gall of a black ox. In a district of Sumatra, in
order to procure rain, all the women of the village, scantily clad, go
to the river, wade into it, and splash each other with the water. A
black cat is thrown into the stream and made to swim about for a while,
then allowed to escape to the bank, pursued by the splashing of the
women. The Garos of Assam offer a black goat on the top of a very high
mountain in time of drought. In all these cases the colour of the animal
is part of the charm; being black, it will darken the sky with
rain-clouds. So the Bechuanas burn the stomach of an ox at evening,
because they say, “The black smoke will gather the clouds and cause the
rain to come.” The Timorese sacrifice a black pig to the Earth-goddess
for rain, a white or red one to the Sun-god for sunshine. The Angoni
sacrifice a black ox for rain and a white one for fine weather. Among
the high mountains of Japan there is a district in which, if rain has
not fallen for a long time, a party of villagers goes in procession to
the bed of a mountain torrent, headed by a priest, who leads a black
dog. At the chosen spot they tether the beast to a stone, and make it a
target for their bullets and arrows. When its life-blood bespatters the
rocks, the peasants throw down their weapons and lift up their voices in
supplication to the dragon divinity of the stream, exhorting him to send
down forthwith a shower to cleanse the spot from its defilement. Custom
has prescribed that on these occasions the colour of the victim shall be
black, as an emblem of the wished-for rain-clouds. But if fine weather
is wanted, the victim must be white, without a spot.   17

  The intimate association of frogs and toads with water has earned for
these creatures a widespread reputation as custodians of rain; and hence
they often play a part in charms designed to draw needed showers from
the sky. Some of the Indians of the Orinoco held the toad to be the god
or lord of the waters, and for that reason feared to kill the creature.
They have been known to keep frogs under a pot and to beat them with
rods when there was a drought. It is said that the Aymara Indians often
make little images of frogs and other aquatic animals and place them on
the tops of the hills as a means of bringing down rain. The Thompson
Indians of British Columbia and some people in Europe think that to kill
a frog will cause rain to fall. In order to procure rain people of low
caste in the Central Provinces of India will tie a frog to a rod covered
with green leaves and branches of the nîm tree (Azadirachta Indica) and
carry it from door to door singing:

“Send soon, O frog, the jewel of water!

And ripen the wheat and millet in the field.”    18

  The Kapus or Reddis are a large caste of cultivators and landowners in
the Madras Presidency. When rain fails, women of the caste will catch a
frog and tie it alive to a new winnowing fan made of bamboo. On this fan
they spread a few margosa leaves and go from door to door singing, “Lady
frog must have her bath. Oh! rain-god, give a little water for her at
least.” While the Kapu women sing this song, the woman of the house
pours water over the frog and gives an alms, convinced that by so doing
she will soon bring rain down in torrents.   19

  Sometimes, when a drought has lasted a long time, people drop the
usual hocus-pocus of imitative magic altogether, and being far too angry
to waste their breath in prayer they seek by threats and curses or even
downright physical force to extort the waters of heaven from the
supernatural being who has, so to say, cut them off at the main. In a
Japanese village, when the guardian divinity had long been deaf to the
peasants’ prayers for rain, they at last threw down his image and, with
curses loud and long, hurled it head foremost into a stinking
rice-field. “There,” they said, “you may stay yourself for a while, to
see how you will feel after a few days’ scorching in this broiling sun
that is burning the life from our cracking fields.” In the like
circumstances the Feloupes of Senegambia cast down their fetishes and
drag them about the fields, cursing them till rain falls.   20

  The Chinese are adepts in the art of taking the kingdom of heaven by
storm. Thus, when rain is wanted they make a huge dragon of paper or
wood to represent the rain-god, and carry it about in procession; but if
no rain follows, the mock-dragon is execrated and torn to pieces. At
other times they threaten and beat the god if he does not give rain;
sometimes they publicly depose him from the rank of deity. On the other
hand, if the wished-for rain falls, the god is promoted to a higher rank
by an imperial decree. In April 1888 the mandarins of Canton prayed to
the god Lung-wong to stop the incessant downpour of rain; and when he
turned a deaf ear to their petitions they put him in a lock-up for five
days. This had a salutary effect. The rain ceased and the god was
restored to liberty. Some years before, in time of drought, the same
deity had been chained and exposed to the sun for days in the courtyard
of his temple in order that he might feel for himself the urgent need of
rain. So when the Siamese need rain, they set out their idols in the
blazing sun; but if they want dry weather, they unroof the temples and
let the rain pour down on the idols. They think that the inconvenience
to which the gods are thus subjected will induce them to grant the
wishes of their worshippers.   21

  The reader may smile at the meteorology of the Far East; but precisely
similar modes of procuring rain have been resorted to in Christian
Europe within our own lifetime. By the end of April 1893 there was great
distress in Sicily for lack of water. The drought had lasted six months.
Every day the sun rose and set in a sky of cloudless blue. The gardens
of the Conca d’Oro, which surround Palermo with a magnificent belt of
verdure, were withering. Food was becoming scarce. The people were in
great alarm. All the most approved methods of procuring rain had been
tried without effect. Processions had traversed the streets and the
fields. Men, women, and children, telling their beads, had lain whole
nights before the holy images. Consecrated candles had burned day and
night in the churches. Palm branches, blessed on Palm Sunday, had been
hung on the trees. At Solaparuta, in accordance with a very old custom,
the dust swept from the churches on Palm Sunday had been spread on the
fields. In ordinary years these holy sweepings preserve the crops; but
that year, if you will believe me, they had no effect whatever. At
Nicosia the inhabitants, bare-headed and bare-foot, carried the
crucifixes through all the wards of the town and scourged each other
with iron whips. It was all in vain. Even the great St. Francis of Paolo
himself, who annually performs the miracle of rain and is carried every
spring through the market-gardens, either could not or would not help.
Masses, vespers, concerts, illuminations, fire-works—nothing could move
him. At last the peasants began to lose patience. Most of the saints
were banished. At Palermo they dumped St. Joseph in a garden to see the
state of things for himself, and they swore to leave him there in the
sun till rain fell. Other saints were turned, like naughty children,
with their faces to the wall. Others again, stripped of their beautiful
robes, were exiled far from their parishes, threatened, grossly
insulted, ducked in horse-ponds. At Caltanisetta the golden wings of St.
Michael the Archangel were torn from his shoulders and replaced with
wings of pasteboard; his purple mantle was taken away and a clout wrapt
about him instead. At Licata the patron saint, St. Angelo, fared even
worse, for he was left without any garments at all; he was reviled, he
was put in irons, he was threatened with drowning or hanging. “Rain or
the rope!” roared the angry people at him, as they shook their fists in
his face.   22

  Sometimes an appeal is made to the pity of the gods. When their corn
is being burnt up by the sun, the Zulus look out for a “heaven bird,”
kill it, and throw it into a pool. Then the heaven melts with tenderness
for the death of the bird; “it wails for it by raining, wailing a
funeral wail.” In Zululand women sometimes bury their children up to the
neck in the ground, and then retiring to a distance keep up a dismal
howl for a long time. The sky is supposed to melt with pity at the
sight. Then the women dig the children out and feel sure that rain will
soon follow. They say that they call to “the lord above” and ask him to
send rain. If it comes they declare that “Usondo rains.” In times of
drought the Guanches of Teneriffe led their sheep to sacred ground, and
there they separated the lambs from their dams, that their plaintive
bleating might touch the heart of the god. In Kumaon a way of stopping
rain is to pour hot oil in the left ear of a dog. The animal howls with
pain, his howls are heard by Indra, and out of pity for the beast’s
sufferings the god stops the rain. Sometimes the Toradjas attempt to
procure rain as follows. They place the stalks of certain plants in
water, saying, “Go and ask for rain, and so long as no rain falls I will
not plant you again, but there shall you die.” Also they string some
fresh-water snails on a cord, and hang the cord on a tree, and say to
the snails, “Go and ask for rain, and so long as no rain comes, I will
not take you back to the water.” Then the snails go and weep, and the
gods take pity and send rain. However, the foregoing ceremonies are
religious rather than magical, since they involve an appeal to the
compassion of higher powers.   23

  Stones are often supposed to possess the property of bringing on rain,
provided they be dipped in water or sprinkled with it, or treated in
some other appropriate manner. In a Samoan village a certain stone was
carefully housed as the representative of the rain-making god, and in
time of drought his priests carried the stone in procession and dipped
it in a stream. Among the Ta-ta-thi tribe of New South Wales, the
rain-maker breaks off a piece of quartz-crystal and spits it towards the
sky; the rest of the crystal he wraps in emu feathers, soaks both
crystal and feathers in water, and carefully hides them. In the Keramin
tribe of New South Wales the wizard retires to the bed of a creek, drops
water on a round flat stone, then covers up and conceals it. Among some
tribes of North-western Australia the rain-maker repairs to a piece of
ground which is set apart for the purpose of rain-making. There he
builds a heap of stones or sand, places on the top of it his magic
stone, and walks or dances round the pile chanting his incantations for
hours, till sheer exhaustion obliges him to desist, when his place is
taken by his assistant. Water is sprinkled on the stone and huge fires
are kindled. No layman may approach the sacred spot while the mystic
ceremony is being performed. When the Sulka of New Britain wish to
procure rain they blacken stones with the ashes of certain fruits and
set them out, along with certain other plants and buds, in the sun. Then
a handful of twigs is dipped in water and weighted with stones, while a
spell is chanted. After that rain should follow. In Manipur, on a lofty
hill to the east of the capital, there is a stone which the popular
imagination likens to an umbrella. When rain is wanted, the rajah
fetches water from a spring below and sprinkles it on the stone. At
Sagami in Japan there is a stone which draws down rain whenever water is
poured on it. When the Wakondyo, a tribe of Central Africa, desire rain,
they send to the Wawamba, who dwell at the foot of snowy mountains, and
are the happy possessors of a “rain-stone.” In consideration of a proper
payment, the Wawamba wash the precious stone, anoint it with oil, and
put it in a pot full of water. After that the rain cannot fail to come.
In the arid wastes of Arizona and New Mexico the Apaches sought to make
rain by carrying water from a certain spring and throwing it on a
particular point high up on a rock; after that they imagined that the
clouds would soon gather, and that rain would begin to fall.   24

  But customs of this sort are not confined to the wilds of Africa and
Asia or the torrid deserts of Australia and the New World. They have
been practised in the cool air and under the grey skies of Europe. There
is a fountain called Barenton, of romantic fame, in those “wild woods of
Broceliande,” where, if legend be true, the wizard Merlin still sleeps
his magic slumber in the hawthorn shade. Thither the Breton peasants
used to resort when they needed rain. They caught some of the water in a
tankard and threw it on a slab near the spring. On Snowdon there is a
lonely tarn called Dulyn, or the Black Lake, lying “in a dismal dingle
surrounded by high and dangerous rocks.” A row of stepping-stones runs
out into the lake, and if any one steps on the stones and throws water
so as to wet the farthest stone, which is called the Red Altar, “it is
but a chance that you do not get rain before night, even when it is hot
weather.” In these cases it appears probable that, as in Samoa, the
stone is regarded as more or less divine. This appears from the custom
sometimes observed of dipping a cross in the Fountain of Barenton to
procure rain, for this is plainly a Christian substitute for the old
pagan way of throwing water on the stone. At various places in France it
is, or used till lately to be, the practice to dip the image of a saint
in water as a means of procuring rain. Thus, beside the old priory of
Commagny, there is a spring of St. Gervais, whither the inhabitants go
in procession to obtain rain or fine weather according to the needs of
the crops. In times of great drought they throw into the basin of the
fountain an ancient stone image of the saint that stands in a sort of
niche from which the fountain flows. At Collobrières and Carpentras a
similar practice was observed with the images of St. Pons and St. Gens
respectively. In several villages of Navarre prayers for rain used to be
offered to St. Peter, and by way of enforcing them the villagers carried
the image of the saint in procession to the river, where they thrice
invited him to reconsider his resolution and to grant their prayers;
then, if he was still obstinate, they plunged him in the water, despite
the remonstrances of the clergy, who pleaded with as much truth as piety
that a simple caution or admonition administered to the image would
produce an equally good effect. After this the rain was sure to fall
within twenty-four hours. Catholic countries do not enjoy a monopoly of
making rain by ducking holy images in water. In Mingrelia, when the
crops are suffering from want of rain, they take a particularly holy
image and dip it in water every day till a shower falls; and in the Far
East the Shans drench the images of Buddha with water when the rice is
perishing of drought. In all such cases the practice is probably at
bottom a sympathetic charm, however it may be disguised under the
appearance of a punishment or a threat.   25

  Like other peoples, the Greeks and Romans sought to obtain rain by
magic, when prayers and processions had proved ineffectual. For example,
in Arcadia, when the corn and trees were parched with drought, the
priest of Zeus dipped an oak branch into a certain spring on Mount
Lycaeus. Thus troubled, the water sent up a misty cloud, from which rain
soon fell upon the land. A similar mode of making rain is still
practised, as we have seen, in Halmahera near New Guinea. The people of
Crannon in Thessaly had a bronze chariot which they kept in a temple.
When they desired a shower they shook the chariot and the shower fell.
Probably the rattling of the chariot was meant to imitate thunder; we
have already seen that mock thunder and lightning form part of a
rain-charm in Russia and Japan. The legendary Salmoneus, King of Elis,
made mock thunder by dragging bronze kettles behind his chariot, or by
driving over a bronze bridge, while he hurled blazing torches in
imitation of lightning. It was his impious wish to mimic the thundering
car of Zeus as it rolled across the vault of heaven. Indeed he declared
that he was actually Zeus, and caused sacrifices to be offered to
himself as such. Near a temple of Mars, outside the walls of Rome, there
was kept a certain stone known as the lapis manalis. In time of drought
the stone was dragged into Rome, and this was supposed to bring down
rain immediately.   26
