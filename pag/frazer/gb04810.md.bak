# Chapter 48. The Corn-Spirit as an Animal.

## Section 10. On the Animal Embodiments of the Corn-spirit.

SO much for the animal embodiments of the corn-spirit as they are
presented to us in the folk-customs of Northern Europe. These customs
bring out clearly the sacramental character of the harvest-supper. The
corn-spirit is conceived as embodied in an animal; this divine animal is
slain, and its flesh and blood are partaken of by the harvesters. Thus
the cock, the hare, the cat, the goat, and the OX are eaten
sacramentally by the harvester, and the pig is eaten sacramentally by
ploughmen in spring. Again, as a substitute for the real flesh of the
divine being, bread or dumplings are made in his image and eaten
sacramentally; thus, pig-shaped dumplings are eaten by the harvesters,
and loaves made in boar-shape (the Yule Boar) are eaten in spring by the
ploughman and his cattle.   1

  The reader has probably remarked the complete parallelism between the
conceptions of the corn-spirit in human and in animal form. The parallel
may be here briefly resumed. When the corn waves in the wind it is said
either that the Corn-mother or that the Corn-wolf, etc., is passing
through the corn. Children are warned against straying in corn-fields
either because the Corn-mother or because the Corn-wolf, etc., is there.
In the last corn cut or the last sheaf threshed either the Corn-mother
or the Corn-wolf, etc., is supposed to be present. The last sheaf is
itself called either the Corn-mother or the Corn-wolf, etc., and is made
up in the shape either of a woman or of a wolf, etc. The person who
cuts, binds, or threshes the last sheaf is called either the Old Woman
or the Wolf, etc., according to the name bestowed on the sheaf itself.
As in some places a sheaf made in human form and called the Maiden, the
Mother of the Maize, etc., is kept from one harvest to the next in order
to secure a continuance of the corn-spirit’s blessing, so in some places
the Harvest-cock and in others the flesh of the goat is kept for a
similar purpose from one harvest to the next. As in some places the
grain taken from the Corn-mother is mixed with the seed-corn in spring
to make the crop abundant, so in some places the feathers of the cock,
and in Sweden the Yule Boar, are kept till spring and mixed with the
seed-corn for a like purpose. As part of the Corn-mother or Maiden is
given to the cattle at Christmas or to the horses at the first
ploughing, so part of the Yule Boar is given to the ploughing horses or
oxen in spring. Lastly, the death of the corn-spirit is represented by
killing or pretending to kill either his human or his animal
representative; and the worshippers partake sacramentally either of the
actual body and blood of the representative of the divinity, or of bread
made in his likeness.   2

  Other animal forms assumed by the corn-spirit are the fox, stag, roe,
sheep, bear, ass, mouse, quail, stork, swan, and kite. If it is asked
why the corn-spirit should be thought to appear in the form of an animal
and of so many different animals, we may reply that to primitive man the
simple appearance of an animal or bird among the corn is probably enough
to suggest a mysterious link between the creature and the corn; and when
we remember that in the old days, before fields were fenced in, all
kinds of animals must have been free to roam over them, we need not
wonder that the corn-spirit should have been identified even with large
animals like the horse and cow, which nowadays could not, except by a
rare accident, be found straying in an English corn-field. This
explanation applies with peculiar force to the very common case in which
the animal embodiment of the corn-spirit is believed to lurk in the last
standing corn. For at harvest a number of wild animals, such as hares,
rabbits, and partridges, are commonly driven by the progress of the
reaping into the last patch of standing corn, and make their escape from
it as it is being cut down. So regularly does this happen that reapers
and others often stand round the last patch of corn armed with sticks or
guns, with which they kill the animals as they dart out of their last
refuge among the stalks. Now, primitive man, to whom magical changes of
shape seem perfectly credible, finds it most natural that the spirit of
the corn, driven from his home in the ripe grain, should make his escape
in the form of the animal which is seen to rush out of the last patch of
corn as it falls under the scythe of the reaper. Thus the identification
of the corn-spirit with an animal is analogous to the identification of
him with a passing stranger. As the sudden appearance of a stranger near
the harvest-field or threshing-floor is, to the primitive mind, enough
to identify him as the spirit of the corn escaping from the cut or
threshed corn, so the sudden appearance of an animal issuing from the
cut corn is enough to identify it with the corn-spirit escaping from his
ruined home. The two identifications are so analogous that they can
hardly be dissociated in any attempt to explain them. Those who look to
some other principle than the one here suggested for the explanation of
the latter identification are bound to show that their theory covers the
former identification also.   3
