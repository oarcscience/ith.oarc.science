# Chapter 54. Types of Animal Sacrament.

## Section 1. The Egyptian and the Aino Types of Sacrament.

WE are now perhaps in a position to understand the ambiguous behaviour
of the Aino and Gilyaks towards the bear. It has been shown that the
sharp line of demarcation which we draw between mankind and the lower
animals does not exist for the savage. To him many of the other animals
appear as his equals or even his superiors, not merely in brute force
but in intelligence; and if choice or necessity leads him to take their
lives, he feels bound, out of regard to his own safety, to do it in a
way which will be as inoffensive as possible not merely to the living
animal, but to its departed spirit and to all the other animals of the
same species, which would resent an affront put upon one of their kind
much as a tribe of savages would revenge an injury or insult offered to
a tribesman. We have seen that among the many devices by which the
savage seeks to atone for the wrong done by him to his animal victims
one is to show marked deference to a few chosen individuals of the
species, for such behaviour is apparently regarded as entitling him to
exterminate with impunity all the rest of the species upon which he can
lay hands. This principle perhaps explains the attitude, at first sight
puzzling and contradictory, of the Aino towards the bear. The flesh and
skin of the bear regularly afford them food and clothing; but since the
bear is an intelligent and powerful animal, it is necessary to offer
some satisfaction or atonement to the bear species for the loss which it
sustains in the death of so many of its members. This satisfaction or
atonement is made by rearing young bears, treating them, so long as they
live, with respect, and killing them with extraordinary marks of sorrow
and devotion. So the other bears are appeased, and do not resent the
slaughter of their kind by attacking the slayers or deserting the
country, which would deprive the Aino of one of their means of
subsistence.   1

  Thus the primitive worship of animals conforms to two types, which are
in some respects the converse of each other. On the one hand, animals
are worshipped, and are therefore neither killed nor eaten. On the other
hand, animals are worshipped because they are habitually killed and
eaten. In both types of worship the animal is revered on account of some
benefit, positive or negative, which the savage hopes to receive from
it. In the former worship the benefit comes either in the positive shape
of protection, advice, and help which the animal affords the man, or in
the negative shape of abstinence from injuries which it is in the power
of the animal to inflict. In the latter worship the benefit takes the
material form of the animal’s flesh and skin. The two types of worship
are in some measure antithetical: in the one, the animal is not eaten
because it is revered; in the other, it is revered because it is eaten.
But both may be practised by the same people, as we see in the case of
the North American Indians, who, while they apparently revere and spare
their totem animals, also revere the animals and fish upon which they
subsist. The aborigines of Australia have totemism in the most primitive
form known to us; but there is no clear evidence that they attempt, like
the North American Indians, to conciliate the animals which they kill
and eat. The means which the Australians adopt to secure a plentiful
supply of game appear to be primarily based, not on conciliation, but on
sympathetic magic, a principle to which the North American Indians also
resort for the same purpose. Hence, as the Australians undoubtedly
represent a ruder and earlier stage of human progress than the American
Indians, it would seem that before hunters think of worshipping the game
as a means of ensuring an abundant supply of it, they seek to attain the
same end by sympathetic magic. This, again, would show—what there is
good reason for believing—that sympathetic magic is one of the earliest
means by which man endeavours to adapt the agencies of nature to his
needs.   2

  Corresponding to the two distinct types of animal worship, there are
two distinct types of the custom of killing the animal god. On the one
hand, when the revered animal is habitually spared, it is nevertheless
killed—and sometimes eaten—on rare and solemn occasions. Examples of
this custom have been already given and an explanation of them offered.
On the other hand, when the revered animal is habitually killed, the
slaughter of any one of the species involves the killing of the god, and
is atoned for on the spot by apologies and sacrifices, especially when
the animal is a powerful and dangerous one; and, in addition to this
ordinary and everyday atonement, there is a special annual atonement, at
which a select individual of the species is slain with extraordinary
marks of respect and devotion. Clearly the two types of sacramental
killing—the Egyptian and the Aino types, as we may call them for
distinction—are liable to be confounded by an observer; and, before we
can say to which type any particular example belongs, it is necessary to
ascertain whether the animal sacramentally slain belongs to a species
which is habitually spared, or to one which is habitually killed by the
tribe. In the former case the example belongs to the Egyptian type of
sacrament, in the latter to the Aino type.   3

  The practice of pastoral tribes appears to furnish examples of both
types of sacrament. “Pastoral tribes,” says Adolf Bastian, “being
sometimes obliged to sell their herds to strangers who may handle the
bones disrespectfully, seek to avert the danger which such a sacrilege
would entail by consecrating one of the herd as an object of worship,
eating it sacramentally in the family circle with closed doors, and
afterwards treating the bones with all the ceremonious respect which,
strictly speaking, should be accorded to every head of cattle, but
which, being punctually paid to the representative animal, is deemed to
be paid to all. Such family meals are found among various peoples,
especially those of the Caucasus. When amongst the Abchases the
shepherds in spring eat their common meal with their loins girt and
their staves in their hands, this may be looked upon both as a sacrament
and as an oath of mutual help and support. For the strongest of all
oaths is that which is accompanied with the eating of a sacred
substance, since the perjured person cannot possibly escape the avenging
god whom he has taken into his body and assimilated.” This kind of
sacrament is of the Aino or expiatory type, since it is meant to atone
to the species for the possible ill-usage of individuals. An expiation,
similar in principle but different in details, is offered by the
Kalmucks to the sheep, whose flesh is one of their staple foods. Rich
Kalmucks are in the habit of consecrating a white ram under the title of
“the ram of heaven” or “the ram of the spirit.” The animal is never
shorn and never sold; but when it grows old and its owner wishes to
consecrate a new one, the old ram must be killed and eaten at a feast to
which the neighbours are invited. On a lucky day, generally in autumn
when the sheep are fat, a sorcerer kills the old ram, after sprinkling
it with milk. Its flesh is eaten; the skeleton, with a portion of the
fat, is burned on a turf altar; and the skin, with the head and feet, is
hung up.   4

  An example of a sacrament of the Egyptian type is furnished by the
Todas, a pastoral people of Southern India, who subsist largely upon the
milk of their buffaloes. Amongst them “the buffalo is to a certain
degree held sacred” and “is treated with great kindness, even with a
degree of adoration, by the people.” They never eat the flesh of the cow
buffalo, and as a rule abstain from the flesh of the male. But to the
latter rule there is a single exception. Once a year all the adult males
of the village join in the ceremony of killing and eating a very young
male calf—seemingly under a month old. They take the animal into the
dark recesses of the village wood, where it is killed with a club made
from the sacred tree of the Todas (the Millingtonia). A sacred fire
having been made by the rubbing of sticks, the flesh of the calf is
roasted on the embers of certain trees, and is eaten by the men alone,
women being excluded from the assembly. This is the only occasion on
which the Todas eat buffalo flesh. The Madi or Moru tribe of Central
Africa, whose chief wealth is their cattle, though they also practise
agriculture, appear to kill a lamb sacramentally on certain solemn
occasions. The custom is thus described by Dr. Felkin: “A remarkable
custom is observed at stated times—once a year, I am led to believe. I
have not been able to ascertain what exact meaning is attached to it. It
appears, however, to relieve the people’s minds, for beforehand they
evince much sadness, and seem very joyful when the ceremony is duly
accomplished. The following is what takes place: A large concourse of
people of all ages assemble, and sit down round a circle of stones,
which is erected by the side of a road (really a narrow path). A very
choice lamb is then fetched by a boy, who leads it four times round the
assembled people. As it passes they pluck off little bits of its fleece
and place them in their hair, or on to some other part of their body.
The lamb is then led up to the stones, and there killed by a man
belonging to a kind of priestly order, who takes some of the blood and
sprinkles it four times over the people. He then applies it
individually. On the children he makes a small ring of blood over the
lower end of the breast bone, on women and girls he makes a mark above
the breasts, and the men he touches on each shoulder. He then proceeds
to explain the ceremony, and to exhort the people to show kindness… .
When this discourse, which is at times of great length, is over, the
people rise, each places a leaf on or by the circle of stones, and then
they depart with signs of great joy. The lamb’s skull is hung on a tree
near the stones, and its flesh is eaten by the poor. This ceremony is
observed on a small scale at other times. If a family is in any great
trouble, through illness or bereavement, their friends and neighbours
come together and a lamb is killed; this is thought to avert further
evil. The same custom prevails at the grave of departed friends, and
also on joyful occasions, such as the return of a son home after a very
prolonged absence.” The sorrow thus manifested by the people at the
annual slaughter of the lamb seems to show that the lamb slain is a
sacred or divine animal, whose death is mourned by his worshippers, just
as the death of the sacred buzzard was mourned by the Californians and
the death of the Theban ram by the Egyptians. The smearing each of the
worshippers with the blood of the lamb is a form of communion with the
divinity; the vehicle of the divine life is applied externally instead
of being taken internally, as when the blood is drunk or the flesh
eaten.   5
