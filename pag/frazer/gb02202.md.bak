# Chapter 22. Tabooed Words.

## Section 2. Names of Relations tabooed.

IT might naturally be expected that the reserve so commonly maintained
with regard to personal names would be dropped or at least relaxed among
relations and friends. But the reverse of this is often the case. It is
precisely the persons most intimately connected by blood and especially
by marriage to whom the rule applies with the greatest stringency. Such
people are often forbidden, not only to pronounce each other’s names,
but even to utter ordinary words which resemble or have a single
syllable in common with these names. The persons who are thus mutually
debarred from mentioning each other’s names are especially husbands and
wives, a man and his wife’s parents, and a woman and her husband’s
father. For example, among the Caffres a woman may not publicly
pronounce the birth-name of her husband or of any of his brothers, nor
may she use the interdicted word in its ordinary sense. If her husband,
for instance, be called u-Mpaka, from impaka, a small feline animal, she
must speak of that beast by some other name. Further, a Caffre wife is
forbidden to pronounce even mentally the names of her father-in-law and
of all her husband’s male relations in the ascending line; and whenever
the emphatic syllable of any of their names occurs in another word, she
must avoid it by substituting either an entirely new word, or, at least,
another syllable in its place. Hence this custom has given rise to an
almost distinct language among the women, which the Caffres call
“women’s speech.” The interpretation of this “women’s speech” is
naturally very difficult, “for no definite rules can be given for the
formation of these substituted words, nor is it possible to form a
dictionary of them, their number being so great—since there may be many
women, even in the same tribe, who would be no more at liberty to use
the substitutes employed by some others, than they are to use the
original words themselves.” A Caffre man, on his side, may not mention
the name of his mother-in-law, nor may she pronounce his; but he is free
to utter words in which the emphatic syllable of her name occurs. A
Kirghiz woman dares not pronounce the names of the older relations of
her husband, nor even use words which resemble them in sound. For
example, if one of these relations is called Shepherd, she may not speak
of sheep, but must call them “the bleating ones”; if his name is Lamb,
she must refer to lambs as “the young bleating ones.” In Southern India
wives believe that to tell their husband’s name or to pronounce it even
in a dream would bring him to an untimely end. Among the Sea Dyaks a man
may not pronounce the name of his father-in-law or mother-in-law without
incurring the wrath of the spirits. And since he reckons as his
father-in-law and mother-in-law not only the father and mother of his
own wife, but also the fathers and mothers of his brothers’ wives and
sisters’ husbands, and likewise the fathers and mothers of all his
cousins, the number of tabooed names may be very considerable and the
opportunities of error correspondingly numerous. To make confusion worse
confounded, the names of persons are often the names of common things,
such as moon, bridge, barley, cobra, leopard; so that when any of a
man’s many fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law are called by such names,
these common words may not pass his lips. Among the Alfoors of
Minahassa, in Celebes, the custom is carried still further so as to
forbid the use even of words which merely resemble the personal names in
sound. It is especially the name of a father-in-law which is thus laid
under an interdict. If he, for example, is called Kalala, his son-in-law
may not speak of a horse by its common name kawalo; he must call it a
“riding-beast” (sasakajan). So among the Alfoors of the island of Buru
it is taboo to mention the names of parents and parents-in-law, or even
to speak of common objects by words which resemble these names in sound.
Thus, if your mother-in-law is called Dalu, which means “betel,” you may
not ask for betel by its ordinary name, you must ask for “red mouth”; if
you want betel-leaf, you may not say betel-leaf (dalu ’mun), you must
say karon fenna. In the same island it is also taboo to mention the name
of an elder brother in his presence. Transgressions of these rules are
punished with fines. In Sunda it is thought that a particular crop would
be spoilt if a man were to mention the names of his father and
mother.   1

  Among the Nufoors of Dutch New Guinea persons who are related to each
other by marriage are forbidden to mention each other’s names. Among the
connexions whose names are thus tabooed are wife, mother-in-law,
father-in-law, your wife’s uncles and aunts and also her grand-uncles
and grand-aunts, and the whole of your wife’s or your husband’s family
in the same generation as yourself, except that men may mention the
names of their brothers-in-law, though women may not. The taboo comes
into operation as soon as the betrothal has taken place and before the
marriage has been celebrated. Families thus connected by the betrothal
of two of their members are not only forbidden to pronounce each other’s
names; they may not even look at each other, and the rule gives rise to
the most comical scenes when they happen to meet unexpectedly. And not
merely the names themselves, but any words that sound like them are
scrupulously avoided and other words used in their place. If it should
chance that a person has inadvertently uttered a forbidden name, he must
at once throw himself on the floor and say, “I have mentioned a wrong
name. I throw it through the chinks of the floor in order that I may eat
well.”   2

  In the western islands of Torres Straits a man never mentioned the
personal names of his father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and
sister-in-law; and a woman was subject to the same restrictions. A
brother-in-law might be spoken of as the husband or brother of some one
whose name it was lawful to mention; and similarly a sister-in-law might
be called the wife of So-and-so. If a man by chance used the personal
name of his brother-in-law, he was ashamed and hung his head. His shame
was only relieved when he had made a present as compensation to the man
whose name he had taken in vain. The same compensation was made to a
sister-in-law, a father-in-law, and a mother-in-law for the accidental
mention of their names. Among the natives who inhabit the coast of the
Gazelle Peninsula in New Britain to mention the name of a brother-in-law
is the grossest possible affront you can offer to him; it is a crime
punishable with death. In the Banks’ Islands, Melanesia, the taboos laid
on the names of persons connected by marriage are very strict. A man
will not mention the name of his father-in-law, much less the name of
his mother-in-law, nor may he name his wife’s brother; but he may name
his wife’s sister—she is nothing to him. A woman may not name her
father-in-law, nor on any account her son-in-law. Two people whose
children have intermarried are also debarred from mentioning each
other’s names. And not only are all these persons forbidden to utter
each other’s names; they may not even pronounce ordinary words which
chance to be either identical with these names or to have any syllables
in common with them. Thus we hear of a native of these islands who might
not use the common words for “pig” and “to die,” because these words
occurred in the polysyllabic name of his son-in-law; and we are told of
another unfortunate who might not pronounce the everyday words for
“hand” and “hot” on account of his wife’s brother’s name, and who was
even debarred from mentioning the number “one,” because the word for
“one” formed part of the name of his wife’s cousin.   3

  The reluctance to mention the names or even syllables of the names of
persons connected with the speaker by marriage can hardly be separated
from the reluctance evinced by so many people to utter their own names
or the names of the dead or of the dead or of chiefs and kings; and if
the reticence as to these latter names springs mainly from superstition,
we may infer that the reticence as to the former has no better
foundation. That the savage’s unwillingness to mention his own name is
based, at least in part, on a superstitious fear of the ill use that
might be made of it by his foes, whether human or spiritual, has already
been shown. It remains to examine the similar usage in regard to the
names of the dead and of royal personages.   4
