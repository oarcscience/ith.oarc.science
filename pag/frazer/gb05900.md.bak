# Chapter 59. Killing the God in Mexico.

BY NO PEOPLE does the custom of sacrificing the human representative of
a god appear to have been observed so commonly and with so much
solemnity as by the Aztecs of ancient Mexico. With the ritual of these
remarkable sacrifices we are well acquainted, for it has been fully
described by the Spaniards who conquered Mexico in the sixteenth
century, and whose curiosity was naturally excited by the discovery in
this distant region of a barbarous and cruel religion which presented
many curious points of analogy to the doctrine and ritual of their own
church. “They took a captive,” says the Jesuit Acosta, “such as they
thought good; and afore they did sacrifice him unto their idols, they
gave him the name of the idol, to whom he should be sacrificed, and
apparelled him with the same ornaments like their idol, saying, that he
did represent the same idol. And during the time that this
representation lasted, which was for a year in some feasts, in others
six months, and in others less, they reverenced and worshipped him in
the same manner as the proper idol; and in the meantime he did eat,
drink, and was merry. When he went through the streets, the people came
forth to worship him, and every one brought him an alms, with children
and sick folks, that he might cure them, and bless them, suffering him
to do all things at his pleasure, only he was accompanied with ten or
twelve men lest he should fly. And he (to the end he might be reverenced
as he passed) sometimes sounded upon a small flute, that the people
might prepare to worship him. The feast being come, and he grown fat,
they killed him, opened him, and ate him, making a solemn sacrifice of
him.”   1

  This general description of the custom may now be illustrated by
particular examples. Thus at the festival called Toxcatl, the greatest
festival of the Mexican year, a young man was annually sacrificed in the
character of Tezcatlipoca, “the god of gods,” after having been
maintained and worshipped as that great deity in person for a whole
year. According to the old Franciscan monk Sahagun, our best authority
on the Aztec religion, the sacrifice of the human god fell at Easter or
a few days later, so that, if he is right, it would correspond in date
as well as in character to the Christian festival of the death and
resurrection of the Redeemer. More exactly he tells us that the
sacrifice took place on the first day of the fifth Aztec month, which
according to him began on the twenty-third or twenty-seventh day of
April.   2

  At this festival the great god died in the person of one human
representative and came to life again in the person of another, who was
destined to enjoy the fatal honour of divinity for a year and to perish,
like all his predecessors, at the end of it. The young man singled out
for this high dignity was carefully chosen from among the captives on
the ground of his personal beauty. He had to be of unblemished body,
slim as a reed and straight as a pillar, neither too tall nor too short.
If through high living he grew too fat, he was obliged to reduce himself
by drinking salt water. And in order that he might behave in his lofty
station with becoming grace and dignity he was carefully trained to
comport himself like a gentleman of the first quality, to speak
correctly and elegantly, to play the flute, to smoke cigars and to snuff
at flowers with a dandified air. He was honourably lodged in the temple,
where the nobles waited on him and paid him homage, bringing him meat
and serving him like a prince. The king himself saw to it that he was
apparelled in gorgeous attire, “for already he esteemed him as a god.”
Eagle down was gummed to his head and white cock’s feathers were stuck
in his hair, which drooped to his girdle. A wreath of flowers like
roasted maize crowned his brows, and a garland of the same flowers
passed over his shoulders and under his armpits. Golden ornaments hung
from his nose, golden armlets adorned his arms, golden bells jingled on
his legs at every step he took; earrings of turquoise dangled from his
ears, bracelets of turquoise bedecked his wrists; necklaces of shells
encircled his neck and depended on his breast; he wore a mantle of
network, and round his middle a rich waistcloth. When this bejewelled
exquisite lounged through the streets playing on his flute, puffing at a
cigar, and smelling at a nosegay, the people whom he met threw
themselves on the earth before him and prayed to him with sighs and
tears, taking up the dust in their hands and putting it in their mouths
in token of the deepest humiliation and subjection. Women came forth
with children in their arms and presented them to him, saluting him as a
god. For “he passed for our Lord God; the people acknowledged him as the
Lord.” All who thus worshipped him on his passage he saluted gravely and
courteously. Lest he should flee, he was everywhere attended by a guard
of eight pages in the royal livery, four of them with shaven crowns like
the palace-slaves, and four of them with the flowing locks of warriors;
and if he contrived to escape, the captain of the guard had to take his
place as the representative of the god and to die in his stead. Twenty
days before he was to die, his costume was changed, and four damsels
delicately nurtured and bearing the names of four goddesses—the Goddess
of Flowers, the Goddess of the Young Maize, the Goddess “Our Mother
among the Water,” and the Goddess of Salt—were given him to be his
brides, and with them he consorted. During the last five days divine
honours were showered on the destined victim. The king remained in his
palace while the whole court went after the human god. Solemn banquets
and dances followed each other in regular succession and at appointed
places. On the last day the young man, attended by his wives and pages,
embarked in a canoe covered with a royal canopy and was ferried across
the lake to a spot where a little hill rose from the edge of the water.
It was called the Mountain of Parting, because there his wives bade him
a last farewell. Then, accompanied only by his pages, he repaired to a
small and lonely temple by the wayside. Like the Mexican temples in
general, it was built in the form of a pyramid; and as the young man
ascended the stairs he broke at every step one of the flutes on which he
had played in the days of his glory. On reaching the summit he was
seized and held down by the priests on his back upon a block of stone,
while one of them cut open his breast, thrust his hand into the wound,
and wrenching out his heart held it up in sacrifice to the sun. The body
of the dead god was not, like the bodies of common victims, sent rolling
down the steps of the temple, but was carried down to the foot, where
the head was cut off and spitted on a pike. Such was the regular end of
the man who personated the greatest god of the Mexican pantheon.   3

  The honour of living for a short time in the character of a god and
dying a violent death in the same capacity was not restricted to men in
Mexico; women were allowed, or rather compelled, to enjoy the glory and
to share the doom as representatives of goddesses. Thus at a great
festival in September, which was preceded by a strict fast of seven
days, they sanctified a young slave girl of twelve or thirteen years,
the prettiest they could find, to represent the Maize Goddess
Chicomecohuatl. They invested her with the ornaments of the goddess,
putting a mitre on her head and maize-cobs round her neck and in her
hands, and fastening a green feather upright on the crown of her head to
imitate an ear of maize. This they did, we are told, in order to signify
that the maize was almost ripe at the time of the festival, but because
it was still tender they chose a girl of tender years to play the part
of the Maize Goddess. The whole long day they led the poor child in all
her finery, with the green plume nodding on her head, from house to
house dancing merrily to cheer people after the dulness and privations
of the fast.   4

  In the evening all the people assembled at the temple, the courts of
which they lit up by a multitude of lanterns and candles. There they
passed the night without sleeping, and at midnight, while the trumpets,
flutes, and horns discoursed solemn music, a portable framework or
palanquin was brought forth, bedecked with festoons of maize-cobs and
peppers and filled with seeds of all sorts. This the bearers set down at
the door of the chamber in which the wooden image of the goddess stood.
Now the chamber was adorned and wreathed, both outside and inside, with
wreaths of maize-cobs, peppers, pumpkins, roses, and seeds of every
kind, a wonder to behold; the whole floor was covered deep with these
verdant offerings of the pious. When the music ceased, a solemn
procession came forth of priests and dignitaries, with flaring lights
and smoking censers, leading in their midst the girl who played the part
of the goddess. Then they made her mount the framework, where she stood
upright on the maize and peppers and pumpkins with which it was strewed,
her hands resting on two bannisters to keep her from falling. Then the
priests swung the smoking censers round her; the music struck up again,
and while it played, a great dignitary of the temple suddenly stepped up
to her with a razor in his hand and adroitly shore off the green feather
she wore on her head, together with the hair in which it was fastened,
snipping the lock off by the root. The feather and the hair he then
presented to the wooden image of the goddess with great solemnity and
elaborate ceremonies, weeping and giving her thanks for the fruits of
the earth and the abundant crops which she had bestowed on the people
that year; and as he wept and prayed, all the people, standing in the
courts of the temple, wept and prayed with him. When that ceremony was
over, the girl descended from the framework and was escorted to the
place where she was to spend the rest of the night. But all the people
kept watch in the courts of the temple by the light of torches till
break of day.   5

  The morning being come, and the courts of the temple being still
crowded by the multitude, who would have deemed it sacrilege to quit the
precincts, the priests again brought forth the damsel attired in the
costume of the goddess, with the mitre on her head and the cobs of maize
about her neck. Again she mounted the portable framework or palanquin
and stood on it, supporting herself by her hands on the bannisters. Then
the elders of the temple lifted it on their shoulders, and while some
swung burning censers and others played on instruments or sang, they
carried it in procession through the great courtyard to the hall of the
god Huitzilopochtli and then back to the chamber, where stood the wooden
image of the Maize Goddess, whom the girl personated. There they caused
the damsel to descend from the palanquin and to stand on the heaps of
corn and vegetables that had been spread in profusion on the floor of
the sacred chamber. While she stood there all the elders and nobles came
in a line, one behind the other, carrying saucers full of dry and
clotted blood which they had drawn from their ears by way of penance
during the seven days’ fast. One by one they squatted on their haunches
before her, which was the equivalent of falling on their knees with us,
and scraping the crust of blood from the saucer cast it down before her
as an offering in return for the benefits which she, as the embodiment
of the Maize Goddess, had conferred upon them. When the men had thus
humbly offered their blood to the human representative of the goddess,
the women, forming a long line, did so likewise, each of them dropping
on her hams before the girl and scraping her blood from the saucer. The
ceremony lasted a long time, for great and small, young and old, all
without exception had to pass before the incarnate deity and make their
offering. When it was over, the people returned home with glad hearts to
feast on flesh and viands of every sort as merrily, we are told, as good
Christians at Easter partake of meat and other carnal mercies after the
long abstinence of Lent. And when they had eaten and drunk their fill
and rested after the night watch, they returned quite refreshed to the
temple to see the end of the festival. And the end of the festival was
this. The multitude being assembled, the priests solemnly incensed the
girl who personated the goddess; then they threw her on her back on the
heap of corn and seeds, cut off her head, caught the gushing blood in a
tub, and sprinkled the blood on the wooden image of the goddess, the
walls of the chamber, and the offerings of corn, peppers, pumpkins,
seeds, and vegetables which cumbered the floor. After that they flayed
the headless trunk, and one of the priests made shift to squeeze himself
into the bloody skin. Having done so they clad him in all the robes
which the girl had worn; they put the mitre on his head, the necklace of
golden maize-cobs about his neck, the maize-cobs of feathers and gold in
his hands; and thus arrayed they led him forth in public, all of them
dancing to the tuck of drum, while he acted as fugleman, skipping and
posturing at the head of the procession as briskly as he could be
expected to do, incommoded as he was by the tight and clammy skin of the
girl and by her clothes, which must have been much too small for a grown
man.   6

  In the foregoing custom the identification of the young girl with the
Maize Goddess appears to be complete. The golden maize-cobs which she
wore round her neck, the artificial maize-cobs which she carried in her
hands, the green feather which was stuck in her hair in imitation (we
are told) of a green ear of maize, all set her forth as a
personification of the corn-spirit; and we are expressly informed that
she was specially chosen as a young girl to represent the young maize,
which at the time of the festival had not yet fully ripened. Further,
her identification with the corn and the corn-goddess was clearly
announced by making her stand on the heaps of maize and there receive
the homage and blood-offerings of the whole people, who thereby returned
her thanks for the benefits which in her character of a divinity she was
supposed to have conferred upon them. Once more, the practice of
beheading her on a heap of corn and seeds and sprinkling her blood, not
only on the image of the Maize Goddess, but on the piles of maize,
peppers, pumpkins, seeds, and vegetables, can seemingly have had no
other object but to quicken and strengthen the crops of corn and the
fruits of the earth in general by infusing into their representatives
the blood of the Corn Goddess herself. The analogy of this Mexican
sacrifice, the meaning of which appears to be indisputable, may be
allowed to strengthen the interpretation which I have given of other
human sacrifices offered for the crops. If the Mexican girl, whose blood
was sprinkled on the maize, indeed personated the Maize Goddess, it
becomes more than ever probable that the girl whose blood the Pawnees
similarly sprinkled on the seed corn personated in like manner the
female Spirit of the Corn; and so with the other human beings whom other
races have slaughtered for the sake of promoting the growth of the
crops.   7

  Lastly, the concluding act of the sacred drama, in which the body of
the dead Maize Goddess was flayed and her skin worn, together with all
her sacred insignia, by a man who danced before the people in this grim
attire, seems to be best explained on the hypothesis that it was
intended to ensure that the divine death should be immediately followed
by the divine resurrection. If that was so, we may infer with some
degree of probability that the practice of killing a human
representative of a deity has commonly, perhaps always, been regarded
merely as a means of perpetuating the divine energies in the fulness of
youthful vigour, untainted by the weakness and frailty of age, from
which they must have suffered if the deity had been allowed to die a
natural death.   8

  These Mexican rites suffice to prove that human sacrifices of the sort
I suppose to have prevailed at Aricia were, as a matter of fact,
regularly offered by a people whose level of culture was probably not
inferior, if indeed it was not distinctly superior, to that occupied by
the Italian races at the early period to which the origin of the Arician
priesthood must be referred. The positive and indubitable evidence of
the prevalence of such sacrifices in one part of the world may
reasonably be allowed to strengthen the probability of their prevalence
in places for which the evidence is less full and trustworthy. Taken all
together, the facts which we have passed in review seem to show that the
custom of killing men whom their worshippers regard as divine has
prevailed in many parts of the world.   9
