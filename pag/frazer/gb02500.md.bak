# Chapter 25. Temporary Kings.

IN SOME places the modified form of the old custom of regicide which
appears to have prevailed at Babylon has been further softened down. The
king still abdicates annually for a short time and his place is filled
by a more or less nominal sovereign; but at the close of his short reign
the latter is no longer killed, though sometimes a mock execution still
survives as a memorial of the time when he was actually put to death. To
take examples. In the month of Méac (February) the king of Cambodia
annually abdicated for three days. During this time he performed no act
of authority, he did not touch the seals, he did not even receive the
revenues which fell due. In his stead there reigned a temporary king
called Sdach Méac, that is, King February. The office of temporary king
was hereditary in a family distantly connected with the royal house, the
sons succeeding the fathers and the younger brothers the elder brothers
just as in the succession to the real sovereignty. On a favourable day
fixed by the astrologers the temporary king was conducted by the
mandarins in triumphal procession. He rode one of the royal elephants,
seated in the royal palanquin, and escorted by soldiers who, dressed in
appropriate costumes, represented the neighbouring peoples of Siam,
Annam, Laos, and so on. In place of the golden crown he wore a peaked
white cap, and his regalia, instead of being of gold encrusted with
diamonds, were of rough wood. After paying homage to the real king, from
whom he received the sovereignty for three days, together with all the
revenues accruing during that time (though this last custom has been
omitted for some time), he moved in procession round the palace and
through the streets of the capital. On the third day, after the usual
procession, the temporary king gave orders that the elephants should
trample under foot the “mountain of rice,” which was a scaffold of
bamboo surrounded by sheaves of rice. The people gathered up the rice,
each man taking home a little with him to secure a good harvest. Some of
it was also taken to the king, who had it cooked and presented to the
monks.   1

  In Siam on the sixth day of the moon in the sixth month (the end of
April) a temporary king is appointed, who for three days enjoys the
royal prerogatives, the real king remaining shut up in his palace. This
temporary king sends his numerous satellites in all directions to seize
and confiscate whatever they can find in the bazaar and open shops; even
the ships and junks which arrive in harbour during the three days are
forfeited to him and must be redeemed. He goes to a field in the middle
of the city, whither they bring a gilded plough drawn by gaily-decked
oxen. After the plough has been anointed and the oxen rubbed with
incense, the mock king traces nine furrows with the plough, followed by
aged dames of the palace scattering the first seed of the season. As
soon as the nine furrows are drawn, the crowd of spectators rushes in
and scrambles for the seed which has just been sown, believing that,
mixed with the seed-rice, it will ensure a plentiful crop. Then the oxen
are unyoked, and rice, maize, sesame, sago, bananas, sugar-cane, melons,
and so on, are set before them; whatever they eat first will, it is
thought, be dear in the year following, though some people interpret the
omen in the opposite sense. During this time the temporary king stands
leaning against a tree with his right foot resting on his left knee.
From standing thus on one foot he is popularly known as King Hop; but
his official title is Phaya Phollathep “Lord of the Heavenly Hosts.” He
is a sort of Minister of Agriculture; all disputes about fields, rice,
and so forth, are referred to him. There is moreover another ceremony in
which he personates the king. It takes place in the second month (which
falls in the cold season) and lasts three days. He is conducted in
procession to an open place opposite the Temple of the Brahmans, where
there are a number of poles dressed like May-poles, upon which the
Brahmans swing. All the while that they swing and dance, the Lord of the
Heavenly Hosts has to stand on one foot upon a seat which is made of
bricks plastered over, covered with a white cloth, and hung with
tapestry. He is supported by a wooden frame with a gilt canopy, and two
Brahmans stand one on each side of him. The dancing Brahmans carry
buffalo horns with which they draw water from a large copper caldron and
sprinkle it on the spectators; this is supposed to bring good luck,
causing the people to dwell in peace and quiet, health and prosperity.
The time during which the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts has to stand on one
foot is about three hours. This is thought “to prove the dispositions of
the Devattas and spirits.” If he lets his foot down “he is liable to
forfeit his property and have his family enslaved by the king, as it is
believed to be a bad omen, portending destruction to the state, and
instability to the throne. But if he stand firm he is believed to have
gained a victory over evil spirits, and he has moreover the privilege,
ostensibly at least, of seizing any ship which may enter the harbour
during these three days, and taking its contents, and also of entering
any open shop in the town and carrying away what he chooses.”   2

  Such were the duties and privileges of the Siamese King Hop down to
about the middle of the nineteenth century or later. Under the reign of
the late enlightened monarch this quaint personage was to some extent
both shorn of the glories and relieved of the burden of his office. He
still watches, as of old, the Brahmans rushing through the air in a
swing suspended between two tall masts, each some ninety feet high; but
he is allowed to sit instead of stand, and, although public opinion
still expects him to keep his right foot on his left knee during the
whole of the ceremony, he would incur no legal penalty were he, to the
great chagrin of the people, to put his weary foot to the ground. Other
signs, too, tell of the invasion of the East by the ideas and
civilisation of the West. The thoroughfares that lead to the scene of
the performance are blocked with carriages: lamp-posts and telegraph
posts, to which eager spectators cling like monkeys, rise above the
dense crowd; and, while a tatterdemalion band of the old style, in gaudy
garb of vermilion and yellow, bangs and tootles away on drums and
trumpets of an antique pattern, the procession of barefooted soldiers in
brilliant uniforms steps briskly along to the lively strains of a modern
military band playing “Marching through Georgia.”   3

  On the first day of the sixth month, which was regarded as the
beginning of the year, the king and people of Samarcand used to put on
new clothes and cut their hair and beards. Then they repaired to a
forest near the capital where they shot arrows on horseback for seven
days. On the last day the target was a gold coin, and he who hit it had
the right to be king for one day. In Upper Egypt on the first day of the
solar year by Coptic reckoning, that is, on the tenth of September, when
the Nile has generally reached its highest point, the regular government
is suspended for three days and every town chooses its own ruler. This
temporary lord wears a sort of tall fool’s cap and a long flaxen beard,
and is enveloped in a strange mantle. With a wand of office in his hand
and attended by men disguised as scribes, executioners, and so forth, he
proceeds to the Governor’s house. The latter allows himself to be
deposed; and the mock king, mounting the throne, holds a tribunal, to
the decisions of which even the governor and his officials must bow.
After three days the mock king is condemned to death; the envelope or
shell in which he was encased is committed to the flames, and from its
ashes the Fellah creeps forth. The custom perhaps points to an old
practice of burning a real king in grim earnest. In Uganda the brothers
of the king used to be burned, because it was not lawful to shed the
royal blood.   4

  The Mohammedan students of Fez, in Morocco, are allowed to appoint a
sultan of their own, who reigns for a few weeks, and is known as Sultan
t-tulba, “the Sultan of the Scribes.” This brief authority is put up for
auction and knocked down to the highest bidder. It brings some
substantial privileges with it, for the holder is freed from taxes
thenceforward, and he has the right of asking a favour from the real
sultan. That favour is seldom refused; it usually consists in the
release of a prisoner. Moreover, the agents of the student-sultan levy
fines on the shopkeepers and householders, against whom they trump up
various humorous charges. The temporary sultan is surrounded with the
pomp of a real court, and parades the streets in state with music and
shouting, while a royal umbrella is held over his head. With the
so-called fines and free-will offerings, to which the real sultan adds a
liberal supply of provisions, the students have enough to furnish forth
a magnificent banquet; and altogether they enjoy themselves thoroughly,
indulging in all kinds of games and amusements. For the first seven days
the mock sultan remains in the college; then he goes about a mile out of
the town and encamps on the bank of the river, attended by the students
and not a few of the citizens. On the seventh day of his stay outside
the town he is visited by the real sultan, who grants him his request
and gives him seven more days to reign, so that the reign of “the Sultan
of the Scribes” nominally lasts three weeks. But when six days of the
last week have passed the mock sultan runs back to the town by night.
This temporary sultanship always falls in spring, about the beginning of
April. Its origin is said to have been as follows. When Mulai Rasheed
II. was fighting for the throne in 1664 or 1665, a certain Jew usurped
the royal authority at Taza. But the rebellion was soon suppressed
through the loyalty and devotion of the students. To effect their
purpose they resorted to an ingenious stratagem. Forty of them caused
themselves to be packed in chests which were sent as a present to the
usurper. In the dead of night, while the unsuspecting Jew was slumbering
peacefully among the packing-cases, the lids were stealthily raised, the
brave forty crept forth, slew the usurper, and took possession of the
city in the name of the real sultan, who, to mark his gratitude for the
help thus rendered him in time of need, conferred on the students the
right of annually appointing a sultan of their own. The narrative has
all the air of a fiction devised to explain an old custom, of which the
real meaning and origin had been forgotten.   5

  A custom of annually appointing a mock king for a single day was
observed at Lostwithiel in Cornwall down to the sixteenth century. On
“little Easter Sunday” the freeholders of the town and manor assembled
together, either in person or by their deputies, and one among them, as
it fell to his lot by turn, gaily attired and gallantly mounted, with a
crown on his head, a sceptre in his hand, and a sword borne before him,
rode through the principal street to the church, dutifully attended by
all the rest on horseback. The clergyman in his best robes received him
at the churchyard stile and conducted him to hear divine service. On
leaving the church he repaired, with the same pomp, to a house provided
for his reception. Here a feast awaited him and his suite, and being set
at the head of the table he was served on bended knees, with all the
rites due to the estate of a prince. The ceremony ended with the dinner,
and every man returned home.   6

  Sometimes the temporary king occupies the throne, not annually, but
once for all at the beginning of each reign. Thus in the kingdom of
Jambi in Sumatra it is the custom that at the beginning of a new reign a
man of the people should occupy the throne and exercise the royal
prerogatives for a single day. The origin of the custom is explained by
a tradition that there were once five royal brothers, the four elder of
whom all declined the throne on the ground of various bodily defects,
leaving it to their youngest brother. But the eldest occupied the throne
for one day, and reserved for his descendants a similar privilege at the
beginning of every reign. Thus the office of temporary king is
hereditary in a family akin to the royal house. In Bilaspur it seems to
be the custom, after the death of a Rajah, for a Brahman to eat rice out
of the dead Rajah’s hand, and then to occupy the throne for a year. At
the end of the year the Brahman receives presents and is dismissed from
the territory, being forbidden apparently to return. “The idea seems to
be that the spirit of the Rájá enters into the Bráhman who eats the khir
(rice and milk) out of his hand when he is dead, as the Brahman is
apparently carefully watched during the whole year, and not allowed to
go away.” The same or a similar custom is believed to obtain among the
hill states about Kangra. The custom of banishing the Brahman who
represents the king may be a substitute for putting him to death. At the
installation of a prince of Carinthia a peasant, in whose family the
office was hereditary, ascended a marble stone which stood surrounded by
meadows in a spacious valley; on his right stood a black mother-cow, on
his left a lean ugly mare. A rustic crowd gathered about him. Then the
future prince, dressed as a peasant and carrying a shepherd’s staff,
drew near, attended by courtiers and magistrates. On perceiving him the
peasant called out, “Who is this whom I see coming so proudly along?”
The people answered, “The prince of the land.” The peasant was then
prevailed on to surrender the marble seat to the prince on condition of
receiving sixty pence, the cow and mare, and exemption from taxes. But
before yielding his place he gave the prince a light blow on the
cheek.   7

  Some points about these temporary kings deserve to be specially
noticed before we pass to the next branch of the evidence. In the first
place, the Cambodian and Siamese examples show clearly that it is
especially the divine or magical functions of the king which are
transferred to his temporary substitute. This appears from the belief
that by keeping up his foot the temporary king of Siam gained a victory
over the evil spirits, whereas by letting it down he imperilled the
existence of the state. Again, the Cambodian ceremony of trampling down
the “mountain of rice,” and the Siamese ceremony of opening the
ploughing and sowing, are charms to produce a plentiful harvest, as
appears from the belief that those who carry home some of the trampled
rice, or of the seed sown, will thereby secure a good crop. Moreover,
when the Siamese representative of the king is guiding the plough, the
people watch him anxiously, not to see whether he drives a straight
furrow, but to mark the exact point on his leg to which the skirt of his
silken robe reaches; for on that is supposed to hang the state of the
weather and the crops during the ensuing season. If the Lord of the
Heavenly Hosts hitches up his garment above his knee, the weather will
be wet and heavy rains will spoil the harvest. If he lets it trail to
his ankle, a drought will be the consequence. But fine weather and heavy
crops will follow if the hem of his robe hangs exactly half-way down the
calf of his leg. So closely is the course of nature, and with it the
weal or woe of the people, dependent on the minutest act or gesture of
the king’s representative. But the task of making the crops grow, thus
deputed to the temporary kings, is one of the magical functions
regularly supposed to be discharged by kings in primitive society. The
rule that the mock king must stand on one foot upon a raised seat in the
rice-field was perhaps originally meant as a charm to make the crop grow
high; at least this was the object of a similar ceremony observed by the
old Prussians. The tallest girl, standing on one foot upon a seat, with
her lap full of cakes, a cup of brandy in her right hand and a piece of
elm-bark or linden-bark in her left, prayed to the god Waizganthos that
the flax might grow as high as she was standing. Then, after draining
the cup, she had it refilled, and poured the brandy on the ground as an
offering to Waizganthos, and threw down the cakes for his attendant
sprites. If she remained steady on one foot throughout the ceremony, it
was an omen that the flax crop would be good; but if she let her foot
down, it was feared that the crop might fail. The same significance
perhaps attaches to the swinging of the Brahmans, which the Lord of the
Heavenly Hosts had formerly to witness standing on one foot. On the
principles of homoeopathic or imitative magic it might be thought that
the higher the priests swing the higher will grow the rice. For the
ceremony is described as a harvest festival, and swinging is practised
by the Letts of Russia with the avowed intention of influencing the
growth of the crops. In the spring and early summer, between Easter and
St. John’s Day (the summer solstice), every Lettish peasant is said to
devote his leisure hours to swinging diligently; for the higher he rises
in the air the higher will his flax grow that season.   8

  In the foregoing cases the temporary king is appointed annually in
accordance with a regular custom. But in other cases the appointment is
made only to meet a special emergency, such as to relieve the real king
from some actual or threatened evil by diverting it to a substitute, who
takes his place on the throne for a short time. The history of Persia
furnishes instances of such occasional substitutes for the Shah. Thus
Shah Abbas the Great, being warned by his astrologers in the year 1591
that a serious danger impended over him, attempted to avert the omen by
abdicating the throne and appointing a certain unbeliever named
Yusoofee, probably a Christian, to reign in his stead. The substitute
was accordingly crowned, and for three days, if we may trust the Persian
historians, he enjoyed not only the name and the state but the power of
the king. At the end of his brief reign he was put to death: the decree
of the stars was fulfilled by this sacrifice; and Abbas, who reascended
his throne in a most propitious hour, was promised by his astrologers a
long and glorious reign.   9
