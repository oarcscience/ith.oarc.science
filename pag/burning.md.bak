Witch Hunt

The following are all documented incidents in the killings of
"witches."  
ONLY incidents relating to witchcraft accusations have been included.
Bear in mind that this is assuredly not all of them.  
Interestingly, it is possible to document that of all the trials, only
one set (in 1390 Milan) involved women tried for practicing rites led by
the pagan Goddess Diana. The bulk of the trials between 1400 and 1700
involved diabolism, Luciferianism, and acts relating to the Devil.
Before 1400, the majority of trials were focused on the use of magics to
harm others, to practice treasonous divination and spells against a
monarch.  
It is therefore a reasonable assumption to make that the trials and
persecutions of the "Burning Times" were not aimed at actual practicing
"pagans," but rather at a whole other class of people.  
Some were guilty. Most were probably innocent and Christian. A few were
"satanists," most were not. Some were just senile. Or too ugly. Or too
pretty. Or just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
