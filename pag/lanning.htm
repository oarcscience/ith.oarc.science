1. INTRODUCTION<br>
<br>
Since 1981 I have been assigned to the Behavioral Science Unit at <br>
the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and have specialized in <br>
studying all aspects of the sexual victimization of children. The <br>
FBI Behavioral Science Unit provides assistance to criminal justice <br>
professionals in the United States and foreign countries. It <br>
attempts to develop practical applications of the behavioral <br>
sciences to the criminal justice system. As a result of training and <br>
research conducted by the Unit and its successes in analyzing <br>
violent crime, many professionals contact the Behavioral Science <br>
Unit for assistance and guidance in dealing with violent crime, <br>
especially those cases considered different, unusual, or bizarre. <br>
This service is provided at no cost and is not limited to crimes <br>
under the investigative jurisdiction of the FBI.<br>
<br>
In 1983 and 1984, when I first began to hear stories of what sounded <br>
like satanic or occult activity in connection with allegations of <br>
sexual victimization of children (allegations that have come to be <br>
referred to most often as &quot;ritual&quot; child abuse), I tended to believe <br>
them. I had been dealing with bizarre, deviant behavior for many <br>
years and had long since realized that almost anything is possible. <br>
Just when you think that you have heard it all, along comes another <br>
strange case. The idea that there are a few cunning, secretive <br>
individuals in positions of power somewhere in this country <br>
regularly killing a few people as part of some satanic ritual or <br>
ceremony and getting away with it is certainly within the realm of <br>
possibility. But the number of alleged cases began to grow and grow. <br>
We now have hundreds of victims alleging that thousands of offenders <br>
are abusing and even murdering tens of thousands of people as part <br>
of organized satanic cults, and there is little or no corroborative <br>
evidence. The very reason many &quot;experts&quot; cite for believing these <br>
allegations (i.e. many victims, who never met each other, reporting <br>
the same events), is the primary reason I began to question at least <br>
some aspects of these allegations. <br>
<br>
I have devoted more than seven years part-time, and eleven years <br>
full-time, of my professional life to researching, training, and <br>
consulting in the area of the sexual victimization of children. The <br>
issues of child sexual abuse and exploitation are a big part of my <br>
professional life's work. I have no reason to deny their existence <br>
or nature. In fact I have done everything I can to make people more <br>
aware of the problem Some have even blamed me for helping to create <br>
the hysteria that has led to these bizarre allegations. I can accept <br>
no outside income and am paid the same salary by the FBI whether or <br>
not children are abused and exploited - and whether the number is <br>
one or one million. As someone deeply concerned about and <br>
professionally committed to the issue, I did not lightly question <br>
the allegations of hundreds of victims child sexual abuse and <br>
exploitation.<br>
<br>
In response to accusations by a few that I am a &quot;satanist&quot; who has <br>
infiltrated the FBI to facilitate cover-up, how does anyone (or <br>
should anyone have to) disprove such allegations? Although reluctant <br>
to dignify such absurd accusations with a reply, all I can say to <br>
those who have made such allegations that they are wrong and to <br>
those who heard such allegations is to carefully consider the <br>
source.<br>
<br>
The reason I have taken the position I have is not because I support <br>
or believe in &quot;satanism&quot;, but because I sincerely believe that my <br>
approach is the proper and most effective investigative strategy. I <br>
believe that my approach is in the best interest of victims of child <br>
sexual abuse. It would have been easy to sit back, as many have, and <br>
say nothing publicly about this controversy. I have spoken out and <br>
published on this issue because I am concerned about the credibility <br>
of the child sexual abuse issue and outraged that, in some cases, <br>
individuals are getting away with molesting children because we <br>
can't prove they are satanic devil worshippers who engage in <br>
brainwashing, human sacrifice, and cannibalism as part of a large <br>
conspiracy.<br>
<br>
There are many valid perspectives from which to assess and evaluate <br>
victim allegations of sex abuse and exploitation. Parents may choose <br>
to believe simply because their children make the claims. The level <br>
of proof necessary may be minimal because the consequences of <br>
believing are within the family. One parent correctly told me, &quot;I <br>
believe what my child needs me to believe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Therapists may choose to believe simply because their professional <br>
assessment is that their patient believes the victimization and <br>
describes it so vividly. The level of proof necessary may be no more <br>
than therapeutic evaluation because the consequences are between <br>
therapist and patient. No independent corroboration may be required.<br>
<br>
A social worker must have more real, tangible evidence of abuse in <br>
order to take protective action and initiate legal proceedings. The <br>
level of proof necessary must be higher because the consequences <br>
(denial of visitation, foster care) are greater.<br>
<br>
The law enforcement officer deals with the criminal justice system. <br>
The levels of proof necessary are reasonable suspicion, probable <br>
cause, and beyond a reasonable doubt because the consequences <br>
(criminal investigation, search and seizure, arrest, incarceration) <br>
are so great. This discussion will focus primarily on the criminal <br>
justice system and the law enforcement perspective. The level of <br>
proof necessary for taking action on allegations of criminal acts <br>
must be more than simply the victim alleged it and it is possible. <br>
This in no way denies the validity and importance of the parental, <br>
therapeutic, social welfare, or any other perspective of these <br>
allegations.<br>
<br>
When, however, therapists and other professionals begin to conduct <br>
training, publish articles, and communicate through the media, the <br>
consequences become greater, and therefore the level of proof must <br>
be greater. The amount of corroboration necessary to act upon <br>
allegations of abuse is dependent upon the consequences of such <br>
action. We need to be concerned about the distribution and <br>
publication of unsubstantiated allegations of bizarre sexual abuse. <br>
Information needs to be disseminated to encourage communication and <br>
research about the phenomena. The risks, however, of intervenor and <br>
victim &quot;contagion&quot; and public hysteria are potential negative <br>
aspects of such dissemination. Because of the highly emotional and <br>
religious nature of this topic, there is a greater possibility that <br>
the spreading of information will result in a kind of self-<br>
fulfilling prophesy.<br>
<br>
If such extreme allegations are going to be disseminated to the <br>
general public, they must be presented in the context of being <br>
assessed and evaluated, at least, from the professional perspective <br>
of the disseminator and, at best, also from the professional <br>
perspective of relevant others. This is what I will attempt to do in <br>
this discussion. The assessment and evaluation of such allegations <br>
are areas where law enforcement, mental health, and other <br>
professionals (anthropologists, folklorists, sociologists, <br>
historians, engineers, surgeons, etc.) may be of some assistance to <br>
each other in validating these cases individually and in general. <br>
<br>
2. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW<br>
<br>
In order to attempt to deal with extreme allegations of what <br>
constitute child sex rings, it is important to have an historical <br>
perspective of society's attitudes about child sexual abuse. I will <br>
provide a brief synopsis of recent attitudes in the United States <br>
here, but those desiring more detailed information about such <br>
societal attitudes, particularly in other cultures and in the more <br>
distant past, should refer to Florence Rush's book _The Best Kept <br>
Secret: Sexual Abuse of Children_ (1980) and Sander J. Breiner's <br>
book _Slaughter of the Innocents_ (1990).<br>
<br>
Society's attitude about child sexual abuse and exploitation can be <br>
summed up in one word: *denial*. Most people do not want to hear <br>
about it and would prefer to pretend that child sexual victimization <br>
just does not occur. Today, however, it is difficult to pretend that <br>
it does not happen. Stories and reports about child sexual <br>
victimization are daily occurrences.<br>
<br>
It is important for professionals dealing with child sexual abuse to <br>
recognize and learn to manage this denial of a serious problem. <br>
Professionals must overcome the denial and encourage society to deal <br>
with, report, and prevent sexual victimization of children.<br>
<br>
Some professionals, however, in their zeal to make American society <br>
more aware of this victimization, tend to exaggerate the problem. <br>
Presentations and literature with poorly documented or misleading <br>
claims about one in three children being sexually molested, the $5 <br>
billion child pornography industry, child slavery rings, and 50,000 <br>
stranger-abducted children are not uncommon. The problem is bad <br>
enough; it is not necessary to exaggerate it. Professionals should <br>
cite reputable and scientific studies and note the sources of <br>
information. If they do not, when the exaggerations and distortions <br>
are discovered, their credibility and the credibility of the issue <br>
are lost.<br>
<br>
-- a. &quot;STRANGER DANGER&quot;.<br>
<br>
During the 1950s and 1960s the primary focus in the literature and <br>
discussions on sexual abuse of children was on &quot;stranger danger&quot; - <br>
the dirty old man in the wrinkled raincoat. If one could not deny <br>
the existence of child sexual abuse, one described victimization in <br>
simplistic terms of good and evil. The &quot;stranger danger&quot; approach to <br>
preventing child sexual abuse is clear-cut. We immediately know who <br>
the good guys and bad guys are and what they look like.<br>
<br>
The FBI distributed a poster that epitomized this attitude. It <br>
showed a man, with his hat pulled down, hiding behind a tree with a <br>
bag of candy in his hands. He was waiting for a sweet little girl <br>
walking home from school alone. At the top it read: &quot;Boys and Girls, <br>
color the page, memorize the rules.&quot; At the bottom it read: &quot;For <br>
your protection, remember to turn down gifts from strangers, and <br>
refuse rides offered by strangers.&quot; The poster clearly contrasts the <br>
evil of the offender with the goodness of the child victim.<br>
<br>
The myth of the child molester as the dirty old man in the wrinkled <br>
raincoat is now being reevaluated, based on what we now know about <br>
the kinds of people who victimize children. The fact is a child <br>
molester can look like anyone else and even be someone we know and <br>
like.<br>
<br>
There is another myth that is still with us and is far less likely <br>
to be discussed. This is the myth of the child victim as a <br>
completely innocent little girl walking down the street minding her <br>
own business. It may be more important to dispel this myth than the <br>
myth of the evil offender, especially when talking about the sexual <br>
exploitation of children and child sex rings. Child victims can be <br>
boys as well as girls, and not all victims are little &quot;angels&quot;.<br>
<br>
Society seems to have a problem dealing with any sexual abuse case <br>
in which the offender is not completely &quot;bad&quot; or the victim is not <br>
completely &quot;good&quot;. Child victims who, for example, simply behave <br>
like human beings and respond to the attention and affection of <br>
offenders by voluntarily and repeatedly returning to the offender's <br>
home are troubling. It confuses us to see the victims in child <br>
pornography giggling or laughing. At professional conferences on <br>
child sexual abuse, child prostitution is almost never discussed. It <br>
is the form of sexual victimization of children most unlike the <br>
stereotype of the innocent girl victim. Child prostitutes, by <br>
definition, participate in and often initiate their victimization. <br>
Furthermore child prostitutes and the participants in child sex <br>
rings are frequently boys. One therapist recently told me that a <br>
researcher's data on child molestation were misleading because many <br>
of the child victims in question were child prostitutes. This <br>
implies that child prostitutes are not &quot;real&quot; child victims. In a <br>
survey by the _Los Angeles Times_, only 37 percent of those <br>
responding thought that child prostitution constituted child sexual <br>
abuse (Timnik, 1985). Whether or not it seems fair, when adults and <br>
children have sex, the child is always the victim.<br>
<br>
-- b. INTRAFAMILIAL CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE.<br>
<br>
During the 1970s, primarily as a result of the women's movement, <br>
society began to learn more about the sexual victimization of <br>
children. We began to realize that most children are sexually <br>
molested by someone they know who is usually a relative - a father, <br>
step-father, uncle, grandfather, older brother, or even a female <br>
relative. Some mitigate the difficulty of accepting this by adopting <br>
the view that only members of socio-economic groups other than <br>
theirs engage in such behavior.<br>
<br>
It quickly became apparent that warnings about not taking gifts from <br>
strangers were not good enough to prevent child sexual abuse. <br>
Consequently, we began to develop prevention programs based on more <br>
complex concepts, such as good touching and bad touching. the <br>
&quot;yucky&quot; feeling, and the child's right to say no. These are not the <br>
kinds of things you can easily and effectively communicate in fifty <br>
minutes to hundreds of kids packed into a school auditorium. These <br>
are very difficult issues, and programs must he carefully developed <br>
and evaluated.<br>
<br>
In the late 1970s child sexual abuse became almost synonymous with <br>
incest, and incest meant father-daughter sexual relations. <br>
Therefore, the focus of child sexual abuse intervention became <br>
father-daughter incest. Even today, the vast majority of training <br>
materials, articles, and books on this topic refer to child sexual <br>
abuse only in terms of intrafamilial father-daughter incest.<br>
<br>
Incest is, in fact, sexual relations between individuals of any age <br>
too closely related to marry. It need not necessarily involve an <br>
adult and a child, and it goes beyond child sexual abuse. But more<br>
importantly child sexual abuse goes beyond father-daughter incest. <br>
Intrafamilial incest between an adult and child may be the most <br>
common form of child sexual abuse, but it is not the only form.<br>
<br>
The progress of the 1970s in recognizing that child sexual abuse was <br>
not simply a result of &quot;stranger danger&quot; was an important <br>
breakthrough in dealing with society's denial. The battle, however, <br>
is not over. The persistent voice of society luring us back to the <br>
more simple concept of &quot;stranger danger&quot; may never go away. It is <br>
the voice of denial.<br>
<br>
-- c. RETURN TO &quot;STRANGER DANGER&quot;.<br>
<br>
In the early 1980s the issue of missing children rose to prominence <br>
and was focused primarily on the stranger abduction of little <br>
children. Runaways, throwaways, noncustodial abductions, nonfamily <br>
abductions of teenagers - all major problems within the missing <br>
children's issue - were almost forgotten. People no longer wanted to <br>
hear about good touching and bad touching and the child's right to <br>
say &quot;no&quot;. They wanted to be told, in thirty minutes or less, how <br>
they could protect their children from abduction by strangers. We <br>
were back to the horrible but simple and clear-cut concept of <br>
&quot;stranger danger&quot;.<br>
<br>
In the emotional zeal over the problem of missing children, isolated <br>
horror stories and distorted numbers were sometimes used. The <br>
American public was led to believe that most of the missing children <br>
had been kidnapped by pedophiles - a new term for child molesters. <br>
The media, profiteers, and well-intentioned zealots all played big <br>
roles in this hype and hysteria over missing children.<br>
<br>
-- d. THE ACQUAINTANCE MOLESTER.<br>
<br>
Only recently has society begun to deal openly with a critical piece <br>
in the puzzle of child sexual abuse - acquaintance molestation. This <br>
seems to be the most difficult aspect of the problem for us to face. <br>
People seem more willing to accept a father or stepfather, <br>
particularly one from another socio-economic group, as a child <br>
molester than a parish priest, a next-door neighbor, a police <br>
officer, a pediatrician, an FBI agent, or a Scout leader. The <br>
acquaintance molester, by definition, is one of us. These kinds of <br>
molesters have always existed, but our society has not been willing <br>
to accept that fact.<br>
<br>
Sadly, one of the main reasons that the criminal justice system and <br>
the public were forced to confront the problem of acquaintance <br>
molestation was the preponderance of lawsuits arising from the <br>
negligence of many institutions.<br>
<br>
One of the unfortunate outcomes of society's preference for the <br>
&quot;stranger danger&quot; concept is what I call &quot;say no, yell, and tell&quot; <br>
guilt. This is the result of prevention programs that tell potential <br>
child victims to avoid sexual abuse by saying no, yelling, and <br>
telling. This might work with the stranger hiding behind a tree. <br>
Adolescent boys seduced by a Scout leader or children who actively <br>
participate in their victimization often feel guilty and blame <br>
themselves because they did not do what they were &quot;supposed&quot; to do. <br>
They may feel a need to describe their victimization in more <br>
socially acceptable but sometimes inaccurate ways that relieve them <br>
of this guilt.<br>
<br>
While American society has become increasingly more aware of the <br>
problem of the acquaintance molester and related problems such as <br>
child pornography, the voice calling us back to &quot;stranger danger&quot; <br>
still persists.<br>
<br>
-- e. SATANISM: A NEW FORM OF &quot;STRANGER DANGER&quot;.<br>
<br>
In today's version of &quot;stranger danger&quot;, it is the satanic devil <br>
worshipers who are snatching and victimizing the children. Many who <br>
warned us in the early 1980s about pedophiles snatching fifty <br>
thousand kids a year now contend they were wrong only about who was <br>
doing the kidnapping, not about the number abducted. This is again <br>
the desire for the simple and clear-cut explanation for a complex <br>
problem.<br>
<br>
For those who know anything about criminology, one of the oldest <br>
theories of crime is demonology: The devil makes you do it. This <br>
makes it even easier to deal with the child molester who is the <br>
&quot;pillar of the community&quot;. It is not his fault; it is not our fault. <br>
There is no way we could have known; the devil made him do it. This <br>
explanation has tremendous appeal because, like &quot;stranger danger&quot;, <br>
it presents the clear-cut, black-and-white struggle between good and <br>
evil as the explanation for child abduction, exploitation, and <br>
abuse.<br>
<br>
In regard to satanic &quot;ritual&quot; abuse, today we may not be where we <br>
were with incest in the 1960s, but where we were with missing <br>
children in the early 1980s. The best data now available (the 1990 <br>
_National Incidence Studies on Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and <br>
Thrownaway Children in America_) estimate the number of <br>
stereotypical child abductions at between 200 and 300 a year, and <br>
the number of stranger abduction homicides of children at between 43 <br>
and 147 a year. Approximately half of the abducted children are <br>
teenagers. Today's facts are significantly different from <br>
yesterday's perceptions, and those who exaggerated the problem, <br>
however well-intentioned, have lost credibility and damaged the <br>
reality of the problem.<br>
<br>
3. LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING<br>
<br>
The belief that there is a connection between satanism and crime is <br>
certainly not new. As previously stated, one of the oldest theories <br>
concerning the causes of crime is demonology. Fear of satanic or <br>
occult activity has peaked from time to time throughout history. <br>
Concern in the late 1970s focused primarily on &quot;unexplained&quot; deaths <br>
and mutilations of animals, and in recent years has focused on child <br>
sexual abuse and the alleged human sacrifice of missing children. In <br>
1999 it will probably focus on the impending &quot;end of the world&quot;.<br>
<br>
Today satanism and a wide variety of other terms are used <br>
interchangeably in reference to certain crimes. This discussion will <br>
analyze the nature of &quot;satanic, occult, ritualistic&quot; crime primarily <br>
as it pertains to the abuse of children and focus on appropriate <br>
*law enforcement* responses to it.<br>
<br>
Recently a flood of law enforcement seminars and conferences have <br>
dealt with satanic and ritualistic crime. These training conferences <br>
have various titles, such as &quot;Occult in Crime&quot;, &quot;Satanic Cults&quot;, <br>
'Ritualistic Crime Seminar&quot;, &quot;Satanic Influences in Homicide&quot;, <br>
&quot;Occult Crimes, Satanism and Teen Suicide&quot;, and &quot;Ritualistic Abuse <br>
of Children&quot;.<br>
<br>
The typical conference runs from one to three days, and many of them <br>
include the same presenters and instructors. A wide variety of <br>
topics are usually discussed during this training either as <br>
individual presentations by different instructors or grouped <br>
together by one or more instructors. Typical topics covered include <br>
the following:<br>
<br>
-- Historical overview of satanism, witchcraft, and paganism from <br>
ancient to modern times.<br>
<br>
-- Nature and influence of fantasy role-playing games, such as <br>
&quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot;.<br>
<br>
-- Lyrics, symbolism, and influence of rock and roll, Heavy Metal, <br>
and Black Metal music.<br>
<br>
-- Teenage &quot;stoner&quot; gangs, their symbols, and their vandalism.<br>
<br>
-- Teenage suicide by adolescents dabbling in the occult.<br>
<br>
-- Crimes committed by self-styled satanic practitioners, including <br>
grave and church desecrations and robberies, animal mutilations, and <br>
even murders.<br>
<br>
-- Ritualistic abuse of children as part of bizarre ceremonies and <br>
human sacrifices.<br>
<br>
-- Organized, Traditional, or Multigenerational satanic groups <br>
involved in organized conspiracies, such as taking over day care <br>
centers, infiltrating police departments, and trafficking in human <br>
sacrifice victims.<br>
<br>
-- The &quot;Big Conspiracy&quot; theory, which implies that satanists are <br>
responsible for such things as Adolph Hitler, World War II, <br>
abortion, illegal drugs, pornography, Watergate, and Irangate, and <br>
have infiltrated the Department of Justice, the Pentagon, and the <br>
White House.<br>
<br>
During the conferences, these nine areas are linked together through <br>
the liberal use of the word &quot;satanism&quot; and some common symbolism <br>
(pentagrams, 666, demons, etc.). The implication often is that all <br>
are part of a continuum of behavior, a single problem or some common <br>
conspiracy. The distinctions among the different areas are blurred <br>
even if occasionally a presenter tries to make them. The information <br>
presented is a mixture of fact, theory, opinion, fantasy, and <br>
paranoia, and because some of it can be proven or corroborated <br>
(symbols on rock albums, graffiti on walls, desecration of <br>
cemeteries, vandalism, etc.), the implication is that it is all true <br>
and documented. Material produced by religious organizations, <br>
photocopies and slides of newspaper articles, and videotapes of <br>
tabloid television programs are used to supplement the training and <br>
are presented as &quot;evidence&quot; of the existence and nature of the <br>
problem.<br>
<br>
All of this is complicated by the fact that almost any discussion of <br>
satanism and the occult is interpreted in the light of the religious <br>
beliefs of those in the audience. Faith, not logic and reason, <br>
governs the religious beliefs of most people. As a result, some <br>
normally skeptical law enforcement officers accept the information <br>
disseminated at these conferences without critically evaluating it <br>
or questioning the sources. Officers who do not normally depend on <br>
church groups for law enforcement criminal intelligence, who know <br>
that media accounts of their own cases are notoriously inaccurate, <br>
and who scoff at and joke about tabloid television accounts of <br>
bizarre behavior suddenly embrace such material when presented in <br>
the context of satanic activity. Individuals not in law enforcement <br>
seem even more likely to do so. Other disciplines, especially <br>
therapists, have also conducted training conferences on the <br>
characteristics and identification of &quot;ritual&quot; child abuse. Nothing <br>
said at such conferences will change the religious beliefs of those <br>
in attendance. Such conferences illustrate the highly emotional <br>
nature of and the ambiguity and wide variety of terms involved in <br>
this issue. <br>
<br>
4. DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
The words &quot;satanic&quot;, &quot;occult&quot;, and &quot;ritual&quot; are often used <br>
interchangeably. It is difficult to define &quot;satanism&quot; precisely. No <br>
attempt will be made to do so here However, it is important to <br>
realize that, for some people, any religious belief system other <br>
than their own is &quot;satanic&quot;. The Ayatollah Khomeini and Saddam <br>
Hussein referred to the United States as the &quot;Great Satan&quot;. In the <br>
British Parliament a Protestant leader called the Pope the <br>
Antichrist. In a book titled _Prepare For War_ (1987), Rebecca <br>
Brown, M.D. has a chapter entitled &quot;Is Roman Catholicism <br>
Witchcraft?&quot; Dr. Brown also lists among the &quot;doorways&quot; to satanic <br>
power and/or demon infestation the following: fortune tellers, <br>
horoscopes, fraternity oaths, vegetarianism, yoga, self-hypnosis, <br>
relaxation tapes, acupuncture, biofeedback, fantasy role-playing <br>
games, adultery, homosexuality, pornography, judo, karate, and rock <br>
music. Dr. Brown states that rock music &quot;was a carefully <br>
masterminded plan by none other than Satan himself&quot; (p. 84). The <br>
ideas expressed in this book may seem extreme and even humorous. <br>
This book, however, has been recommended as a serious reference in <br>
law enforcement training material on this topic.<br>
<br>
In books, lectures, handout material, and conversations, I have <br>
heard all of the following referred to as satanism: <br>
	<br>
-- Church of Satan<br>
-- Ordo Templi Orientis<br>
-- Temple of Set<br>
-- Demonology<br>
-- Witchcraft<br>
-- Occult<br>
-- Paganism<br>
-- Santeria<br>
-- Voodoo<br>
-- Rosicrucians<br>
-- Freemasonry<br>
-- Knights Templar<br>
-- Stoner Gangs<br>
-- Heavy Metal Music<br>
-- Rock Music<br>
-- KKK<br>
-- Nazis<br>
-- Skinheads<br>
-- Scientology<br>
-- Unification Church<br>
-- The Way<br>
-- Hare Krishna<br>
-- Rajneesh<br>
-- Religious Cults<br>
-- New Age<br>
-- Astrology<br>
-- Channeling<br>
-- Transcendental Meditation<br>
-- Holistic Medicine<br>
-- Buddhism<br>
-- Hinduism<br>
-- Mormonism<br>
-- Islam<br>
-- Orthodox Church<br>
-- Roman Catholicism<br>
<br>
At law enforcement training conferences, it is witchcraft, santeria, <br>
paganism, and the occult that are most often referred to as forms of <br>
satanism. It may be a matter of definition, but these things are not <br>
necessarily the same as traditional satanism. The worship of lunar <br>
goddesses and nature and the practice of fertility rituals are not <br>
satanism. Santeria is a combination of 17th century Roman<br>
Catholicism and African paganism.<br>
<br>
Occult means simply &quot;hidden&quot;. All unreported or unsolved crimes <br>
might be regarded as occult, but in this context the term refers to <br>
the action or influence of supernatural powers, some secret <br>
knowledge of them, or an interest in paranormal phenomena, and does <br>
not imply satanism, evil, wrongdoing, or crime. Indeed, <br>
historically, the principal crimes deserving of consideration as <br>
&quot;occult crimes&quot; are the frauds perpetrated by faith healers, fortune <br>
tellers and &quot;psychics&quot; who for a fee claim cures, arrange <br>
visitations with dead loved ones, and commit other financial crimes <br>
against the gullible.<br>
<br>
Many individuals define satanism from a totally Christian <br>
perspective, using this word to describe the power of evil in the <br>
world. With this definition, any crimes, especially those which are <br>
particularly bizarre, repulsive, or cruel, can be viewed as satanic <br>
in nature. Yet it is just as difficult to precisely define satanism <br>
as it is to precisely define Christianity or any complex spiritual <br>
belief system. <br>
<br>
-- a. WHAT IS RITUAL?<br>
<br>
The biggest confusion is over the word &quot;ritual&quot;. During training <br>
conferences on this topic, ritual almost always comes to mean <br>
&quot;satanic&quot; or at least &quot;spiritual&quot;. &quot;Ritual&quot; can refer to a <br>
prescribed religious ceremony, but in its broader meaning refers to <br>
any customarily-repeated act or series of acts. The need to repeat <br>
these acts can be cultural, sexual, or psychological as well as <br>
spiritual.<br>
<br>
Cultural rituals could include such things as what a family eats on <br>
Thanksgiving Day, or when and how presents are opened at Christmas. <br>
The initiation ceremonies of fraternities, sororities, gangs, and <br>
other social clubs are other examples of cultural rituals.<br>
<br>
Since 1972 I have lectured about sexual ritual, which is nothing <br>
more than repeatedly engaging in an act or series of acts in a <br>
certain manner because of a *sexual* need. In order to become <br>
aroused and/or gratified, a person must engage in the act in a <br>
certain way. This sexual ritual can include such things as the <br>
physical characteristics, age, or gender of the victim, the <br>
particular sequence of acts, the bringing or taking of specific <br>
objects, and the use of certain words or phrases. This is more than <br>
the concept of M.O. (Method of Operation) known to most police <br>
officers. M.O. is something done by an offender because it works. <br>
Sexual ritual is something done by an offender because of a need. <br>
Deviant acts, such as urinating on, defecating on, or even <br>
eviscerating a victim, are far more likely to be the result of <br>
sexual ritual than religious or &quot;satanic&quot; ritual.<br>
<br>
From a criminal investigative perspective, two other forms of <br>
ritualism must be recognized. The _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual <br>
of Mental Disorders_ (DSM-III-R) (APA, 1987) defines &quot;Obsessive- <br>
Compulsive Disorder&quot; as &quot;repetitive, purposeful, and intentional <br>
behaviors that are performed in response to an obsession, or <br>
according to certain rules or in a stereotyped fashion&quot; (p. 247). <br>
Such compulsive behavior frequently involves rituals. Although such <br>
behavior usually involves noncriminal activity such as excessive <br>
hand washing or checking that doors are locked, occasionally <br>
compulsive ritualism can be part of criminal activity. Certain <br>
gamblers or firesetters, for example, are thought by some <br>
authorities to be motivated in part through such compulsions. Ritual <br>
can also stem from psychotic hallucinations and delusions. A crime <br>
can be committed in a precise manner because a voice told the <br>
offender to do it that way or because a divine mission required it.<br>
<br>
To make this more confusing, cultural, religious, sexual, and <br>
psychological ritual can overlap. Some psychotic people are <br>
preoccupied with religious delusions and hear the voice of God or <br>
Satan telling them to do things of a religious nature. Offenders who <br>
feel little, if any, guilt over their crimes may need little <br>
justification for their antisocial behavior. As human beings, <br>
however, they may have fears, concerns, and anxiety over getting <br>
away with their criminal acts. It is difficult to pray to God for <br>
success in doing things that are against His Commandments. A <br>
negative spiritual belief system may fulfill their human need for <br>
assistance from and belief in a greater power or to deal with their <br>
superstitions. Compulsive ritualism (e.g., excessive cleanliness or <br>
fear of disease) can be introduced into sexual behavior. Even many <br>
&quot;normal&quot; people have a need for order and predictability and <br>
therefore may engage in family or work rituals. Under stress or in <br>
times of change, this need for order and ritual may increase.<br>
<br>
Ritual crime may fulfill the cultural, spiritual, sexual, and <br>
psychological needs of an offender. Crimes may be ritualistically <br>
motivated or may have ritualistic elements. The ritual behavior may <br>
also fulfill basic criminal needs to manipulate victims, get rid of <br>
rivals, send a message to enemies, and intimidate co-conspirators. <br>
The leaders of a group may want to play upon the beliefs and <br>
superstitions of those around them and try to convince accomplices <br>
and enemies that they, the leaders, have special or &quot;supernatural&quot; <br>
powers. <br>
<br>
The important point for the criminal investigator is to realize that <br>
most ritualistic criminal behavior is not motivated simply by <br>
satanic or any religious ceremonies. At some conferences, presenters <br>
have attempted to make an issue of distinguishing between &quot;ritual&quot;, <br>
&quot;ritualized&quot;, and &quot;ritualistic&quot; abuse of children. These subtle <br>
distinctions, however, seem to be of no significant value to the <br>
criminal investigator.<br>
<br>
-- c. WHAT IS &quot;RITUAL&quot; CHILD ABUSE?<br>
<br>
I cannot define &quot;ritual child abuse&quot; precisely and prefer not to use <br>
the term. I am frequently forced to use it (as throughout this <br>
discussion) so that people will have some idea what I am discussing. <br>
Use of the term, however, is confusing, misleading, and <br>
counterproductive. The newer term &quot;satanic ritual abuse&quot; <br>
(abbreviated &quot;SRA&quot;) is even worse. Certain observations, however, <br>
are important for investigative understanding.<br>
<br>
Most people today use the term to refer to abuse of children that is <br>
part of some evil spiritual belief system, which almost by <br>
definition must be satanic.<br>
<br>
Dr. Lawrence Pazder, coauthor of _Michelle Remembers_, defines <br>
&quot;ritualized abuse of children&quot; as &quot;repeated physical, emotional, <br>
mental, and spiritual assaults combined with a systematic use of <br>
symbols and secret ceremonies designed to turn a child against <br>
itself, family, society, and God&quot; (presentation, Richmond, Va., May <br>
7,1987). He also states that &quot;the sexual assault has ritualistic <br>
meaning and is not for sexual gratification&quot;.<br>
<br>
This definition may have value for academics, sociologists, and <br>
therapists, but it creates potential problems for law enforcement. <br>
Certain acts engaged in with children (i.e. kissing, touching, <br>
appearing naked, etc.) may be criminal if performed for sexual <br>
gratification. If the ritualistic acts were in fact performed for <br>
spiritual indoctrination, potential prosecution can be jeopardized, <br>
particularly if the acts can be defended as constitutionally <br>
protected religious expression. The mutilation of a baby's genitals<br>
for sadistic sexual pleasure is a crime. The circumcision of a <br>
baby's genitals for religious reasons is most likely *not* a crime. <br>
The intent of the acts is important for criminal prosecution.<br>
<br>
Not all spiritually motivated ritualistic activity is satanic. <br>
Santeria, witchcraft, voodoo, and most religious cults are not <br>
satanism. In fact, most spiritually- or religiously-based abuse of <br>
children has nothing to do with satanism. Most child abuse that <br>
could be termed &quot;ritualistic&quot; by various definitions is more likely <br>
to be physical and psychological rather than sexual in nature. If a <br>
distinction needs to be made between satanic and nonsatanic child <br>
abuse, the indicators for that distinction must be related to <br>
specific satanic symbols, artifacts, or doctrine rather than the <br>
mere presence of any ritualistic element.<br>
<br>
Not all such ritualistic activity with a child is a crime. Almost <br>
all parents with religious beliefs indoctrinate their children into <br>
that belief system. Is male circumcision for religious reasons child <br>
abuse? Is the religious circumcision of females child abuse? Does <br>
having a child kneel on a hard floor reciting the rosary constitute <br>
child abuse? Does having a child chant a satanic prayer or attend a <br>
black mass constitute child abuse? Does a religious belief in <br>
corporal punishment constitute child abuse? Does group care of <br>
children in a commune or cult constitute child abuse? Does the fact <br>
that any acts in question were performed with parental permission <br>
affect the nature of the crime? Many ritualistic acts, whether <br>
satanic or not, are simply not crimes. To open the Pandora's box of <br>
labeling child abuse as &quot;ritualistic&quot; simply because it involves a <br>
spiritual belief system means to apply the definition to all acts by <br>
all spiritual belief systems. The day may come when many in the <br>
forefront of concern about ritual abuse will regret they opened the <br>
box. <br>
<br>
When a victim describes and investigation corroborates what sounds <br>
like ritualistic activity. several possibilities must be considered. <br>
The ritualistic activity may be part of the excessive religiosity of <br>
mentally disturbed, even psychotic offenders. It may be a <br>
misunderstood part of sexual ritual. The ritualistic activity may be <br>
incidental to any real abuse. The offender may be involved in <br>
ritualistic activity with a child and also may be abusing a child, <br>
but one may have little or nothing to do with the other.<br>
<br>
The offender may be deliberately engaging in ritualistic activity <br>
with a child as part of child abuse and exploitation. The <br>
motivation, however, may be not to indoctrinate the child into a <br>
belief system, but to lower the inhibitions of, control, manipulate, <br>
and/or confuse the child. In all the turmoil over this issue, it <br>
would be very effective strategy for any child molester deliberately <br>
to introduce ritualistic elements into his crime in order to confuse <br>
the child and therefore the criminal justice system. This would, <br>
however, make the activity M.O. and not ritual.<br>
<br>
The ritualistic activity and the child abuse may be integral parts <br>
of some spiritual belief system. In that case the greatest risk is <br>
to the children of the practitioners. But this is true of all cults <br>
and religions, not just satanic cults. A high potential of abuse <br>
exists for any children raised in a group isolated from the <br>
mainstream of society, especially if the group has a charismatic <br>
leader whose orders are unquestioned and blindly obeyed by the <br>
members. Sex, money, and power are often the main motivations of the <br>
leaders of such cults.<br>
<br>
-- c. WHAT MAKES A CRIME SATANIC, OCCULT, OR RITUALISTIC?<br>
<br>
Some would answer that it is the offender's spiritual beliefs or <br>
membership in a cult or church. If that is the criterion, why not<br>
label the crimes committed by Protestants, Catholics, and Jews in <br>
the same way? Are the atrocities of Jim Jones in Guyana Christian <br>
crimes?<br>
<br>
Some would answer that it is the presence of certain symbols in the <br>
possession or home of the perpetrator. What does it mean then to <br>
find a crucifix, Bible, or rosary in the possession or home of a <br>
bank robber, embezzler, child molester, or murderer? If different <br>
criminals possess the same symbols, are they necessarily part of one <br>
big conspiracy?<br>
<br>
Others would answer that it is the presence of certain symbols such <br>
as pentagrams, inverted crosses, and 666 at the crime scene. What <br>
does it mean then to find a cross spray painted on a wall or carved <br>
into the body of a victim? What does it mean for a perpetrator, as <br>
in one recent case profiled by my Unit, to leave a Bible tied to his <br>
murder victim? What about the possibility that an offender <br>
deliberately left such symbols to make it look like a &quot;satanic&quot; <br>
crime?<br>
<br>
Some would argue that it is the bizarreness or cruelness of the <br>
crime: body mutilation, amputation, drinking of blood, eating of <br>
flesh, use of urine or feces. Does this mean that all individuals <br>
involved in lust murder, sadism, vampirism, cannibalism, urophilia, <br>
and coprophilia are satanists or occult practitioners? What does <br>
this say about the bizarre crimes of psychotic killers such as Ed <br>
Gein or Richard Trenton Chase, both of whom mutilated their victims <br>
as part of their psychotic delusions? Can a crime that is not <br>
sexually deviant, bizarre, or exceptionally violent be satanic? Can <br>
white collar crime be satanic?<br>
<br>
A few might even answer that it is the fact that the crime was <br>
committed on a date with satanic or occult significance (Halloween, <br>
May Eve, etc.) or the fact that the perpetrator claims that Satan <br>
told him to commit the crime. What does this mean for crimes <br>
committed on Thanksgiving or Christmas? What does this say about <br>
crimes committed by perpetrators who claim that God or Jesus told <br>
them to do it? One note of interest is the fact that in handout and <br>
reference material I have collected, the number of dates with <br>
satanic or occult significance ranges from 8 to 110. This is <br>
compounded by the fact that it is sometimes stated that satanists <br>
can celebrate these holidays on several days on either side of the <br>
official date or that the birthdays of practitioners can also be <br>
holidays. The exact names and exact dates of the holidays and the <br>
meaning of symbols listed may also vary depending on who prepared <br>
the material The handout material is often distributed without <br>
identifying the author or documenting the original source of the <br>
information. It is then frequently photocopied by attendees and <br>
passed on to other police officers with no one really knowing its <br>
validity or origin.<br>
<br>
Most, however, would probably answer that what makes a crime <br>
satanic, occult, or ritualistic is the motivation for the crime. It <br>
is a crime that is spiritually motivated by a religious belief <br>
system. How then do we label the following true crimes?<br>
<br>
-- Parents defy a court order and send their children to an <br>
unlicensed Christian school.<br>
<br>
-- Parents refuse to send their children to any school because they <br>
are waiting for the second coming of Christ.<br>
<br>
-- Parents beat their child to death because he or she will not <br>
follow their Christian belief.<br>
<br>
-- Parents violate child labor laws because they believe the Bible<br>
requires such work.<br>
<br>
-- Individuals bomb an abortion clinic or kidnap the doctor because <br>
their religious belief system says abortion is murder.<br>
<br>
-- A child molester reads the Bible to his victims in order to <br>
justify his sex acts with them.<br>
<br>
-- Parents refuse life-saving medical treatment for a child because <br>
of their religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
-- Parents starve and beat their child to death because their <br>
minister said the child was possessed by demonic spirits.<br>
<br>
Some people would argue that the Christians who committed the above <br>
crimes misunderstood and distorted their religion while satanists <br>
who commit crimes are following theirs. But who decides what <br>
constitutes a misinterpretation of a religious belief system? The <br>
individuals who committed the above-described crimes, however <br>
misguided, believed that they were following their religion as they <br>
understood it. Religion was and is used to justify such social <br>
behavior as the Crusades, the Inquisition, Apartheid, segregation, <br>
and recent violence in Northern Ireland, India, Lebanon and Nigeria.<br>
<br>
Who decides exactly what &quot;satanists&quot; believe? In this country, we <br>
cannot even agree on what Christians believe. At many law <br>
enforcement conferences The _Satanic Bible_ is used for this, and it <br>
is often contrasted or compared with the Judeo-Christian Bible. The <br>
_Satanic Bible_ is, in essence, a short paperback book written by <br>
one man, Anton LaVey, in 1969. To compare it to a book written by <br>
multiple authors over a period of thousands of years is ridiculous, <br>
even ignoring the possibility of Divine revelation in the Bible. <br>
What satanists believe certainly isn't limited to other people's <br>
interpretation of a few books. More importantly it is subject to <br>
some degree of interpretation by individual believers just as <br>
Christianity is. Many admitted &quot;satanists&quot; claim they do not even <br>
believe in God, the devil, or any supreme deity. The criminal <br>
behavior of one person claiming belief in a religion does not <br>
necessarily imply guilt or blame to others sharing that belief. In <br>
addition, simply claiming membership in a religion does not <br>
necessarily make you a member.<br>
<br>
The fact is that far more crime and child abuse has been committed <br>
by zealots in the name of God, Jesus, Mohammed, and other mainstream <br>
religion than has ever been committed in the name of Satan. Many <br>
people, including myself, don't like that statement, but the truth <br>
of it is undeniable. <br>
<br>
Although defining a crime as satanic, occult, or ritualistic would <br>
probably involve a combination of the criteria set forth above, I <br>
have been unable to clearly define such a crime. Each potential <br>
definition presents a different set of problems when measured <br>
against an objective, rational, and constitutional perspective. In a <br>
crime with multiple subjects, each offender may have a different <br>
motivation for the same crime. Whose motivation determines the label <br>
for the crime? It is difficult to count or track something you <br>
cannot even define.<br>
<br>
I have discovered, however, that the facts of so-called &quot;satanic <br>
crimes&quot; are often significantly different from what is described st <br>
training conferences or in the media. The actual involvement of <br>
satanism or the occult in these cases usually turns out to be <br>
secondary, insignificant, or nonexistent. Occult or ritual crime <br>
surveys done by the states of Michigan (1990) and Virginia (1991) <br>
have only confirmed this &quot;discovery&quot;. Some law enforcement officers, <br>
unable to find serious &quot;satanic&quot; crime in their communities, assume<br>
they are just lucky or vigilant and the serious problems must be in <br>
other jurisdictions. The officers in the other jurisdictions, also <br>
unable find it, assume the same. <br>
<br>
5. MULTlDlMENSlONAL CHILD SEX RINGS<br>
<br>
Sometime in early 1983 I was first contacted by a law enforcement <br>
agency for guidance in what was then thought to be an unusual case. <br>
The exact date of the contact is unknown because its significance <br>
was not recognized at the time. In the months and years that <br>
followed, I received more and more inquiries about &quot;these kinds of <br>
cases&quot;. The requests for assistance came (and continue to come) from <br>
all over the United States. Many of the aspects of these cases <br>
varied, but there were also some commonalties. Early on, however, <br>
one particularly difficult and potentially significant issue began <br>
to emerge.<br>
<br>
These cases involved and continue to involve unsubstantiated <br>
allegations of bizarre activity that are difficult either to prove <br>
or disprove. Many of the unsubstantiated allegations, however, do <br>
not seem to have occurred or even be possible. These cases seem to <br>
call into question the credibility of victims of child sexual abuse <br>
and exploitation. These are the most polarizing, frustrating, and <br>
baffling cases I have encountered in more than 18 years of studying <br>
the criminal aspects of deviant sexual behavior. I privately sought <br>
answers, but said nothing publicly about those cases until 1985.<br>
<br>
In October 1984 the problems in investigating and prosecuting one of <br>
these cases in Jordan, Minnesota became publicly known. In February <br>
1985, at the FBI Academy, the FBI sponsored and I coordinated the <br>
first national seminar held to study &quot;these kinds of cases&quot;. Later <br>
in 1985, similar conferences sponsored by other organizations were <br>
held in Washington, D.C.; Sacramento, California; and Chicago, <br>
Illinois. These cases have also been discussed at many recent <br>
regional and national conferences dealing with the sexual <br>
victimization of children and Multiple Personality Disorder. Few <br>
answers have come from these conferences. I continue to be contacted <br>
on these cases on a regular basis. Inquiries have been received from <br>
law enforcement officers, prosecutors, therapists, victims, families <br>
of victims, and the media from all over the United States and now <br>
foreign countries. I do not claim to understand completely all the <br>
dynamics of these cases. I continue to keep an open mind and to <br>
search for answers to the questions and solutions to the problems <br>
they pose. This discussion is based on my analysis of the several <br>
hundred of &quot;these kinds of cases&quot; on which I have consulted since <br>
1983.<br>
<br>
-- a. DYNAMICS OF CASES.<br>
<br>
What are &quot;these kinds of cases&quot;? They were and continue to be <br>
difficult to define. They all involve allegations of what sounds <br>
like child sexual abuse, but with a combination of some atypical <br>
dynamics. These cases seem to have the following four dynamics in <br>
common: (1) multiple young victims, (2) multiple offenders, (3) fear <br>
as the controlling tactic, and (4) bizarre or ritualistic activity.<br>
<br>
---- (1) MULTIPLE YOUNG VICTIMS.<br>
<br>
In almost all the cases the sexual abuse was alleged to have taken <br>
place or at least begun when the victims were between the ages of <br>
birth and six. This very young age may be an important key to <br>
understanding these cases. In addition the victims all described <br>
multiple children being abused. The numbers ranged from three or <br>
four to as many as several hundred victims.<br>
<br>
---- (2) MULTIPLE OFFENDERS.<br>
<br>
In almost all the cases the victims reported numerous offenders. The <br>
numbers ranged from two or three all the way up to dozens of <br>
offenders. In one recent case the victims alleged 400-500 offenders <br>
were involved. Interestingly many of the offenders (perhaps as many <br>
as 40-50 percent) were reported to be females. The multiple <br>
offenders were often family members and were described as being part <br>
of a cult, occult, or satanic group.<br>
<br>
---- (3) FEAR AS CONTROLLING TACTIC.<br>
<br>
Child molesters in general are able to maintain control and ensure <br>
the secrecy of their victims in a variety of ways. These include <br>
attention and affection, coercion, blackmail, embarrassment, <br>
threats, and violence. In almost all of these cases I have studied, <br>
the victims described being frightened and reported threats against <br>
themselves, their families, their friends, and even their pets. They <br>
reported witnessing acts of violence perpetrated to reinforce this <br>
fear. It is my belief that this fear and the traumatic memory of the <br>
events may be another key to understanding many of these cases.<br>
<br>
---- (4) BIZARRE OR RITUALISTIC ACTIVITY.<br>
<br>
This is the most difficult dynamic of these cases to describe. <br>
&quot;Bizarre&quot; is a relative term. Is the use of urine or feces in sexual <br>
activity bizarre, or is it a well-documented aspect of sexual <br>
deviancy, or is it part of established satanic rituals? As <br>
previously discussed, the ritualistic aspect is even more difficult <br>
to define. How do you distinguish acts performed in a precise manner <br>
to enhance or allow sexual arousal from those acts that fulfill <br>
spiritual needs or comply with &quot;religious&quot; ceremonies? Victims in <br>
these cases report ceremonies, chanting, robes and costumes, drugs, <br>
use of urine and feces, animal sacrifice, torture, abduction, <br>
mutilation, murder, and even cannibalism and vampirism. All things <br>
considered, the word &quot;bizarre&quot; is probably preferable to the word <br>
&quot;ritual&quot; to describe this activity.<br>
<br>
When I was contacted on these cases, it was very common for a <br>
prosecutor or investigator to say that the alleged victims have been <br>
evaluated by an &quot;expert&quot; who will stake his or her professional <br>
reputation on the fact that the victims are telling the &quot;truth&quot;. <br>
When asked how many cases this expert had previously evaluated <br>
involving these four dynamics, the answer was always the same: none! <br>
The experts usually had only dealt with one-on-one intrafamilial <br>
sexual abuse cases. Recently an even more disturbing trend has <br>
developed. More and more of the victims have been identified or <br>
evaluated by experts who have been trained to identify and <br>
specialize in satanic ritual abuse.<br>
<br>
-- b. CHARACTERISTICS OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL CHILD SEX RINGS.<br>
<br>
As previously stated, a major problem in communicating, training, <br>
and researching in this area is the term used to define &quot;these kinds <br>
of cases&quot;. Many refer to them as &quot;ritual, ritualistic, or ritualized <br>
abuse of children cases&quot; or &quot;satanic ritual abuse (SRA) cases&quot;. Such <br>
words carry specialized meanings for many people and might imply <br>
that all these cases are connected to occult or satanic activity. If <br>
ritual abuse is not necessarily occult or satanic, but is &quot;merely&quot; <br>
severe, repeated, prolonged abuse, why use a term that, in the minds <br>
of so many, implies such specific motivation?<br>
<br>
Others refer to these cases as &quot;multioffender/multivictim cases&quot;. <br>
The problem with this term is that most multiple offender and victim <br>
cases do not involve the four dynamics discussed above.<br>
<br>
For want of a better term, I have decided to refer to &quot;these kinds<br>
of cases&quot; as &quot;multidimensional child sex rings&quot;. Right now I seem to <br>
be the only one using this term. I am, however, not sure if this is <br>
truly a distinct kind of child sex ring case or just a case not <br>
properly handled. Following are the general characteristics of these <br>
multidimensional child sex ring cases as contrasted with more common <br>
historical child sex ring cases [see my monograph _Child Sex Rings: <br>
A Behavioral Analysis] (1989) for a discussion of the <br>
characteristics of historical child sex ring cases].<br>
<br>
---- (1) FEMALE OFFENDERS.<br>
<br>
As many as 40-50 percent of the offenders in these cases are <br>
reported to be women. This is in marked contrast to historical child <br>
sex rings in which almost all the offenders are men.<br>
<br>
---- (2) SITUATIONAL MOLESTERS.<br>
<br>
The offenders appear to be sexually interacting with the child <br>
victims for reasons other than a true sexual preference for <br>
children. The children are substitute victims, and the abusive <br>
activity may have little to do with pedophilia [see my monograph <br>
_Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis_ (1987) for a further <br>
explanation about types of molesters].<br>
<br>
---- (3) MALE AND FEMALE VICTIMS.<br>
<br>
Both boys and girls appear to be targeted, but with an apparent <br>
preference for girls. Almost all the adult survivors are female, but <br>
day care cases frequently involve male as well as female victims. <br>
The most striking characteristic of the victims, however, is their <br>
young age (generally birth to six years old when the abuse began).<br>
<br>
---- (4) MULTIDIMENSIONAL MOTIVATION.<br>
<br>
Sexual gratification appears to be only part of the motivation for <br>
the &quot;sexual&quot; activity. Many people today argue that the motivation <br>
is &quot;spiritual&quot; - possibly part of an occult ceremony. It is my <br>
opinion that the motivation may have more to do with anger, <br>
hostility, rage and resentment carried out against weak and <br>
vulnerable victims. Much of the ritualistic abuse of children may <br>
not be sexual in nature. Some of the activity may, in fact, be <br>
physical abuse directed at sexually-significant body parts (penis, <br>
anus, nipples). This may also partially explain the large percentage <br>
of female offenders. Physical abuse of children by females is well-<br>
documented.<br>
<br>
---- (5) PORNOGRAPHY AND PARAPHERNALIA.<br>
<br>
Although many of the victims of multidimensional child sex rings <br>
claim that pictures and videotapes of the activity were made, no <br>
such visual record has been found by law enforcement. In recent <br>
years, American law enforcement has seized large amounts of child <br>
pornography portraying children in a wide variety of sexual activity <br>
and perversions. None of it, however, portrays the kind of bizarre <br>
and/or ritualistic activity described by these victims. Perhaps <br>
these offenders use and store their pornography and paraphernalia in <br>
ways different from preferential child molesters (pedophiles). This <br>
is an area needing additional research and investigation.<br>
<br>
---- (6) CONTROL THROUGH FEAR.<br>
<br>
Control through fear may be the overriding characteristic of these <br>
cases. Control is maintained by frightening the children. A very <br>
young child might not be able to understand the significance of much <br>
of the sexual activity but certainly understands fear. The stories <br>
that the victims tell may be their perceived versions of severe<br>
traumatic memories. They may be the victims of a severely <br>
traumatized childhood in which being sexually abused was just one of <br>
the many negative events affecting their lives.<br>
<br>
-- c. SCENARIOS.<br>
<br>
Multidimensional child sex rings typically emerge from one of four <br>
scenarios: (1) adult survivors, (2) day care cases, (3) <br>
family/isolated neighborhood cases, and (4) custody/visitation <br>
disputes.<br>
<br>
---- (1) ADULT SURVIVORS.<br>
<br>
In adult survivor cases, adults of almost any age - nearly always <br>
women - are suffering the consequences of a variety of personal <br>
problems and failures in their lives (e.g., promiscuity, eating <br>
disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, failed relationships, self-<br>
mutilation, unemployment). As a result of some precipitating stress <br>
or crisis, they often seek therapy. They are frequently hypnotized, <br>
intentionally or unintentionally, as part of the therapy and are <br>
often diagnosed as suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder. <br>
Gradually, during the therapy, the adults reveal previously <br>
unrecalled memories of early childhood victimization that includes <br>
multiple victims and offenders, fear as the controlling tactic, and <br>
bizarre or ritualistic activity. Adult survivors may also claim that <br>
&quot;cues&quot; from certain events in their recent life &quot;triggered&quot; the <br>
previously repressed memories.<br>
<br>
The multiple offenders are often described as members of a cult or <br>
satanic group. Parents, family members, clergy, civic leaders, <br>
police officers (or individuals wearing police uniforms), and other <br>
prominent members of society are frequently described as present at <br>
and participating in the exploitation. The alleged bizarre activity <br>
often includes insertion of foreign objects, witnessing mutilations, <br>
and sexual acts and murders being filmed or photographed. The <br>
offenders may allegedly still be harassing or threatening the <br>
victims. They report being particularly frightened on certain dates <br>
and by certain situations. In several of these cases, women (called <br>
&quot;breeders&quot;) claim to have had babies that were turned over for human <br>
sacrifice. This type of case is probably best typified by books like <br>
_Michelle Remembers_ (Smith &amp; Pazder, 1980), _Satan's Underground_ <br>
(Stratford, 1988), and _Satan's Children_ (Mayer, 1991).<br>
<br>
If and when therapists come to believe the patient or decide the law <br>
requires it, the police or FBI are sometimes contacted to conduct an <br>
investigation. The therapists may also fear for their safety because <br>
they now know the &quot;secret&quot;. The therapists will frequently tell law <br>
enforcement that they will stake their professional reputation on <br>
the fact that their patient is telling the truth. Some adult <br>
survivors go directly to law enforcement. They may also go from <br>
place to place in an effort to find therapists or investigators who <br>
will listen to and believe them. Their ability to provide verifiable <br>
details varies and many were raised in apparently religious homes. A <br>
few adult survivors are now reporting participation in specific <br>
murders or child abductions that are known to have taken place.<br>
<br>
---- (2) DAY CARE CASES.<br>
<br>
In day care cases children currently or formerly attending a day <br>
care center gradually describe their victimization at the center and <br>
at other locations to which they were taken by the day care staff. <br>
The cases include multiple victims and offenders, fear, and bizarre <br>
or ritualistic activity, with a particularly high number of female <br>
offenders. Descriptions of strange games, insertion of foreign <br>
objects, killing of animals, photographing of activities, and <br>
wearing of costumes are common. The accounts of the young children,<br>
however, do not seem to be quite as &quot;bizarre&quot; as those of the adult <br>
survivors, with fewer accounts of human sacrifice.<br>
<br>
---- (3) FAMILY/ISOLATED NEIGHBORHOOD CASES.<br>
<br>
In family/isolated neighborhood cases, children describe their <br>
victimization within their family or extended family. The group is <br>
often defined by geographic boundary, such as a cul-de-sac, <br>
apartment building, or isolated rural setting. Such accounts are <br>
most common in rural or suburban communities with high <br>
concentrations of religiously conservative people. The stories are <br>
similar to those told of the day care setting, but with more male <br>
offenders. The basic dynamics remain the same, but victims tend to <br>
be more than six years of age, and the scenario may also involve a <br>
custody or visitation dispute.<br>
<br>
---- (4) CUSTODY/VISITATION DISPUTE.<br>
<br>
In custody/visitation dispute cases, the allegations emanate from a <br>
custody or visitation dispute over at least one child under the age <br>
of seven. The four dynamics described above make these cases <br>
extremely difficult to handle. When complicated by the strong <br>
emotions of this scenario, the cases can be overwhelming. This is <br>
especially true if the disclosing child victims have been taken into <br>
the &quot;underground&quot; by a parent during the custody or visitation <br>
dispute. Some of these parents or relatives may even provide <br>
authorities with diaries or tapes of their interviews with the <br>
children. An accurate evaluation and assessment of a young child <br>
held in isolation in this underground while being &quot;debriefed&quot; by a <br>
parent or someone else is almost impossible. However well-<br>
intentioned, these self-appointed investigators severely damage any <br>
chance to validate these cases objectively.<br>
<br>
-- d. WHY ARE VICTIMS ALLEGING THINGS THAT DO NOT SEEM TO BE TRUE?<br>
<br>
Some of what the victims in these cases allege is physically <br>
impossible (victim cut up and put back together, offender took the <br>
building apart and then rebuilt it); some is possible but improbable <br>
(human sacrifice, cannibalism, vampirism ); some is possible and <br>
probable (child pornography, clever manipulation of victims); and <br>
some is corroborated (medical evidence of vaginal or anal trauma, <br>
offender confessions).<br>
<br>
The most significant crimes being alleged that do not *seem* to be <br>
true are the human sacrifice and cannibalism by organized satanic <br>
cults. In none of the multidimensional child sex ring cases of which <br>
I am aware have bodies of the murder victims been found - in spite <br>
of major excavations where the abuse victims claim the bodies were <br>
located. The alleged explanations for this include: the offenders <br>
moved the bodies after the children left, the bodies were burned in <br>
portable high-temperature ovens, the bodies were put in double-<br>
decker graves under legitimately buried bodies, a mortician member <br>
of the cult disposed of the bodies in a crematorium, the offenders <br>
ate the bodies, the offenders used corpses and aborted fetuses, or <br>
the power of Satan caused the bodies to disappear. <br>
<br>
Not only are no bodies found, but also, more importantly, there is <br>
no physical evidence that a murder took place. Many of those not in <br>
law enforcement do not understand that, while it is possible to get <br>
rid of a body, it is even more difficult to get rid of the physical <br>
evidence that a murder took place, especially a human sacrifice <br>
involving sex, blood, and mutilation. Such activity would leave <br>
behind trace evidence that could be found using modern crime scene <br>
processing techniques in spite of extraordinary efforts to clean it <br>
up.<br>
<br>
The victims of these human sacrifices and murders are alleged to be <br>
abducted missing children, runaway and throwaway children, <br>
derelicts, and the babies of breeder women. It is interesting to <br>
note that many of those espousing these theories are using the long-<br>
since-discredited numbers and rhetoric of the missing children <br>
hysteria in the early 1980s. Yet &quot;Stranger-Abduction Homicides of <br>
Children&quot;, a January 1989 _Juvenile Justice Bulletin_, published by <br>
the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the <br>
U.S. Department of Justice, reports that researchers now estimate <br>
that the number of children kidnapped and murdered by nonfamily <br>
members is between 52 and 158 a year and that adolescents 14 to 17 <br>
years old account for nearly two-thirds of these victims. These <br>
figures are also consistent with the 1990 National Incident Studies <br>
previously mentioned.<br>
<br>
We live in a very violent society, and yet we have &quot;only&quot; about <br>
23,000 murders a year. Those who accept these stories of mass human <br>
sacrifice would have us believe that the satanists and other occult <br>
practitioners are murdering more than twice as many people every <br>
year in this country as all the other murderers combined.<br>
<br>
In addition, in none of the cases of which I am aware has any <br>
evidence of a well-organized satanic cult been found. Many of those <br>
who accept the stories of organized ritual abuse of children and <br>
human sacrifice will tell you that the best evidence they now have <br>
is the consistency of stories from all over America. It sounds like <br>
a powerful argument. It is interesting to note that, without having <br>
met each other, the hundreds of people who claim to have been <br>
abducted by aliens from outer space also tell stories and give <br>
descriptions of the aliens that are similar to each other. This is <br>
not to imply that allegations of child abuse are in the same <br>
category as allegations of abduction by aliens from outer space. It <br>
is intended only to illustrate that individuals who never met each <br>
other can sometimes describe similar events without necessarily <br>
having experienced them.<br>
<br>
The large number of people telling the same story is, in fact, the <br>
biggest reason to doubt these stories. It is simply too difficult <br>
for that many people to commit so many horrendous crimes as part of <br>
an organized conspiracy. Two or three people murder a couple of <br>
children in a few communities as part of a ritual, and nobody finds <br>
out? Possible. Thousands of people do the same thing to tens of <br>
thousands of victims over many years? Not likely. Hundreds of <br>
communities all over America are run by mayors, police departments, <br>
and community leaders who are practicing satanists and who regularly <br>
murder and eat people? Not likely. In addition, these community <br>
leaders and high-ranking officials also supposedly commit these <br>
complex crimes leaving no evidence, and at the same time function as <br>
leaders and managers while heavily involved in using illegal drugs. <br>
Probably the closest documented example of this type of alleged <br>
activity in American history is the Ku Klux Klan, which ironically <br>
used Christianity, not satanism, to rationalize its activity but <br>
which, as might be expected, was eventually infiltrated by <br>
informants and betrayed by its members.<br>
<br>
As stated, initially I was inclined to believe the allegations of <br>
the victims. But as the cases poured in and the months and years <br>
went by, I became more concerned about the lack of physical evidence <br>
and corroboration for many of the more serious allegations. With <br>
increasing frequency I began to ask the question: &quot;Why are victims <br>
alleging things that do not *seem* to be true?&quot; Many possible <br>
answers were considered. <br>
<br>
The first possible answer is obvious: clever offenders. The <br>
allegations may not seem to be true but they are true. The criminal <br>
justice system lacks the knowledge, skill, and motivation to get to<br>
the bottom of this crime conspiracy. The perpetrators of this crime <br>
conspiracy are clever, cunning individuals using sophisticated mind <br>
control and brainwashing techniques to control their victims. Law <br>
enforcement does not know how to investigate these cases.<br>
<br>
It is technically possible that these allegations of an organized <br>
conspiracy involving taking over day care centers, abduction, <br>
cannibalism, murder, and human sacrifice might be true. But if they <br>
are true, they constitute one of the greatest crime conspiracies in <br>
history.<br>
<br>
Many people do not understand how difficult it is to commit a <br>
conspiracy crime involving numerous co-conspirators. One clever and <br>
cunning individual has a good chance of getting away with a well- <br>
planned interpersonal crime. Bring one partner into the crime and <br>
the odds of getting away with it drop considerably. The more people <br>
involved in the crime, the harder it is to get away with it. Why? <br>
Human nature is the answer. People get angry and jealous. They come <br>
to resent the fact that another conspirator is getting &quot;more&quot; than <br>
they. They get in trouble and want to make a deal for themselves by <br>
informing on others.<br>
<br>
If a group of individuals degenerate to the point of engaging in <br>
human sacrifice, murder, and cannibalism, that would most likely be <br>
the beginning of the end for such a group. The odds are that someone <br>
in the group would have a problem with such acts and be unable to <br>
maintain the secret.<br>
<br>
The appeal of the satanic conspiracy theory is twofold:<br>
<br>
---- (1) First, it is a simple explanation for a complex problem. <br>
Nothing is more simple than &quot;the devil made them do it&quot;. If we do <br>
not understand something, we make it the work of some supernatural <br>
force. During the Middle Ages, serial killers were thought to be <br>
vampires and werewolves, and child sexual abuse was the work of <br>
demons taking the form of parents and clergy. Even today, especially <br>
for those raised to religiously believe so, satanism offers an <br>
explanation as to why &quot;good&quot; people do bad things. It may also help <br>
to &quot;explain&quot; unusual, bizarre, and compulsive sexual urges and <br>
behavior.<br>
<br>
---- (2) Second, the conspiracy theory is a popular one. We find it <br>
difficult to believe that one bizarre individual could commit a <br>
crime we find so offensive. Conspiracy theories about soldiers <br>
missing in action (MlAs), abductions by UFOs, Elvis Presley <br>
sightings, and the assassination of prominent public figures are the <br>
focus of much attention in this country. These conspiracy theories <br>
and allegations of ritual abuse have the following in common: (1) <br>
self-proclaimed experts, (2) tabloid media interest, (3) belief the <br>
government is involved in a coverup, and (4) emotionally involved <br>
direct and indirect victim/witnesses.<br>
<br>
On a recent television program commemorating the one hundredth <br>
anniversary of Jack the Ripper, almost fifty percent of the viewing <br>
audience who called the polling telephone numbers indicated that <br>
they thought the murders were committed as part of a conspiracy <br>
involving the British Royal Family. The five experts on the program, <br>
however, unanimously agreed the crimes were the work of one <br>
disorganized but lucky individual who was diagnosed as a paranoid <br>
schizophrenic. In many ways, the murders of Jack the Ripper are <br>
similar to those allegedly committed by satanists today.<br>
<br>
If your child's molestation was perpetrated by a sophisticated <br>
satanic cult, there is nothing you could have done to prevent it and <br>
therefore no reason to feel any guilt. I have been present when <br>
parents who believe their children were ritually abused at day care<br>
centers have told others that the cults had sensors in the road, <br>
lookouts in the air, and informers everywhere; therefore, the <br>
usually recommended advice of unannounced visits to the day care <br>
center would be impossible. <br>
<br>
6. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS<br>
<br>
Even if only part of an allegation is not true, what then is the <br>
answer to the question &quot;Why are victims alleging things that do not <br>
*seem* to be true?&quot; After consulting with psychiatrists, <br>
psychologists, anthropologists, therapists, social workers, child <br>
sexual abuse experts, and law enforcement investigators for more <br>
than eight years, I can find no single, simple answer. The answer to <br>
the question seems to be a complex set of dynamics that can be <br>
different in each case. In spite of the fact that some skeptics keep <br>
looking for it, there does not appear to be one answer to the <br>
question that fits every case. Each case is different, and each case <br>
may involve a different combination of answers.<br>
<br>
I have identified a series of possible alternative answers to this <br>
question. The alternative answers also do not preclude the <br>
possibility that clever offenders are sometimes involved. I will not <br>
attempt to explain completely these alternative answers because I <br>
cannot. They are presented simply as areas for consideration and <br>
evaluation by child sexual abuse intervenors, for further <br>
elaboration by experts in these fields, and for research by <br>
objective social scientists. The first step, however, in finding the <br>
answers to this question is to admit the possibility that some of <br>
what the victims describe may not have happened. Some child <br>
advocates seem unwilling to do this.<br>
<br>
-- a. PATHOLOGICAL DISTORTION.<br>
<br>
The first possible answer to why victims are alleging things that do <br>
not *seem* to be true is *pathological distortion*. The allegations <br>
may be errors in processing reality influenced by underlying mental <br>
disorders such as dissociative disorders, borderline or histrionic <br>
personality disorders, or psychosis. These distortions may be <br>
manifested in false accounts of victimization in order to gain <br>
psychological benefits such as attention and sympathy (factitious <br>
disorder). When such individuals repeatedly go from place to place <br>
or person to person making these false reports of their own <br>
&quot;victimization&quot;, it is called Munchausen Syndrome. When the repealed <br>
false reports concern the &quot;victimization&quot; of their children or <br>
others linked to them, it is called Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. I <br>
am amazed when some therapists state that they believe the <br>
allegations because they cannot think of a reason why the &quot;victim&quot;, <br>
whose failures are now explained and excused or who is now the <br>
center of attention at a conference or on a national television <br>
program, would lie. If you can be forgiven for mutilating and <br>
killing babies, you can be forgiven for anything.<br>
<br>
Many &quot;victims&quot; may develop pseudomemories of their victimization and <br>
eventually come to believe the events actually occurred. Noted <br>
forensic psychiatrist Park E. Dietz (personal communication, Nov. <br>
1991) states:<br>
<br>
&quot;Pseudomemories have been acquired through dreams (particularly if <br>
one is encouraged to keep a journal or dream diary and to regard <br>
dream content as 'clues' about the past or as snippets of history), <br>
substance-induced altered states of consciousness (alcohol or other <br>
drugs), group influence (particularly hearing vivid accounts of <br>
events occurring to others with whom one identifies emotionally such <br>
as occurs in incest survivor groups), reading vivid accounts of <br>
events occurring to others with whom one identifies emotionally, <br>
watching such accounts in films or on television, and hypnosis. The<br>
most efficient means of inducing pseudomemories is hypnosis.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is characteristic of pseudomemories that the recollections of <br>
complex events (as opposed to a simple unit of information, such as <br>
a tag number) are incomplete and without chronological sequence. <br>
Often the person reports some uncertainty because the pseudomemories <br>
are experienced in a manner they describe as 'hazy', 'fuzzy', or <br>
'vague'. They are often perplexed that they recall some details <br>
vividly but others dimly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pseudomemories are not delusions. When first telling others of <br>
pseudomemories, these individuals do not have the unshakable but <br>
irrational conviction that deluded subjects have, but with social <br>
support they often come to defend vigorously the truthfulness of the <br>
pseudomemories.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pseudomemories are not fantasies, but may incorporate elements from <br>
fantasies experienced in the past. Even where the events described <br>
are implausible, listeners may believe them because they are <br>
reported with such intense affect (i.e. with so much emotion <br>
attached to the story) that the listener concludes that the events <br>
must have happened because no one could 'fake' the emotional aspects <br>
of the retelling. It also occurs, however, that persons report <br>
pseudomemories in such a matter-of-fact and emotionless manner that <br>
mental health professionals conclude that the person has <br>
'dissociated' intellectual knowledge of the events from emotional <br>
appreciation of their impact.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- b. TRAUMATIC MEMORY.<br>
<br>
The second possible answer is *traumatic memory*. Fear and severe <br>
trauma can cause victims to distort reality and confuse events. This <br>
is a well-documented fact in cases involving individuals taken <br>
hostage or in life-and-death situations. The distortions may be part <br>
of an elaborate defense mechanism of the mind called &quot;splitting&quot; - <br>
The victims create a clear-cut good-and-evil manifestation of their <br>
complex victimization that is then psychologically more manageable.<br>
<br>
Through the defense mechanism of dissociation, the victim may escape <br>
the horrors of reality by inaccurately processing that reality. In a <br>
dissociative state a young child who ordinarily would know the <br>
difference might misinterpret a film or video as reality.<br>
<br>
Another defense mechanism may tell the victim that it could have <br>
been worse, and so his or her victimization was not so bad. They are <br>
not alone in their victimization - other children were also abused. <br>
Their father who abused them is no different from other prominent <br>
people in the community they claim also abused them. Satanism may <br>
help to explain why their outwardly good and religious parents did <br>
such terrible things to them in the privacy of their home. Their <br>
religious training may convince them that such unspeakable acts by <br>
supposedly &quot;good&quot; people must be the work of the devil. The <br>
described human sacrifice may be symbolic of the &quot;death&quot; of their <br>
childhood.<br>
<br>
It may be that we should anticipate that individuals severely abused <br>
as very young children by *multiple* offenders with *fear* as the <br>
primary controlling tactic will distort and embellish their <br>
victimization. Perhaps a horror-filled yet inaccurate account of <br>
victimization is not only not a counterindication of abuse, but is <br>
in fact a corroborative indicator of extreme physical, <br>
psychological, and/or sexual abuse. I do not believe it is a <br>
coincidence nor the result of deliberate planning by satanists that <br>
in almost all the cases of ritual abuse that have come to my <br>
attention, the abuse is alleged to have begun prior to the age of <br>
seven and perpetrated by multiple offenders. It may well be that<br>
such abuse, at young age by multiple offenders, is the most <br>
difficult to accurately recall with the specific and precise detail <br>
needed by the criminal justice system, and the most likely to be <br>
distorted and exaggerated when it is recalled. In her book _Too <br>
Scared to Cry_ (1990), child psychiatrist Lenore Terr, a leading <br>
expert on psychic trauma in childhood, states &quot;that a series of <br>
early childhood shocks might not be fully and accurately <br>
'reconstructed' from the dreams and behaviors of the adult&quot; (p. 5).<br>
 <br>
-- c. NORMAL CHILDHOOD FEARS AND FANTASY.<br>
<br>
The third possible answer may be *normal childhood fears and <br>
fantasy*. Most young children are afraid of ghosts and monsters. <br>
Even as adults, many people feel uncomfortable, for example, about <br>
dangling their arms over the side of their bed. They still remember <br>
the &quot;monster&quot; under the bed from childhood. While young children may <br>
rarely invent stories about sexual activity, they might describe <br>
their victimization in terms of evil as they understand it. In <br>
church or at home, children may be told of satanic activity as the <br>
source of evil. The children may be &quot;dumping&quot; all their fears and <br>
worries unto an attentive and encouraging listener.<br>
<br>
Children do fantasize. Perhaps whatever causes a child to allege <br>
something impossible (such as being cut up and put back together) is <br>
similar to what causes a child to allege something possible but <br>
improbable (such as witnessing another child being chopped up and <br>
eaten).<br>
<br>
-- d. MISPERCEPTION, CONFUSION, AND TRICKERY.<br>
<br>
Misperception, confusion, and trickery may be a fourth answer. <br>
Expecting young children to give accurate accounts of sexual <br>
activity for which they have little frame of reference is <br>
unreasonable. The Broadway play _Madame Butterfly_ is the true story <br>
of a man who had a 15-year affair, including the &quot;birth&quot; of a baby, <br>
with a &quot;woman&quot; who turns out to have been a man all along. If a <br>
grown man does not know when he has had vaginal intercourse with a <br>
woman, how can we expect young children not to be confused?<br>
<br>
Furthermore some clever offenders may deliberately introduce <br>
elements of satanism and the occult into the sexual exploitation <br>
simply to confuse or intimidate the victims. Simple magic and other <br>
techniques may be used to trick the children. Drugs may also be <br>
deliberately used to confuse the victims and distort their <br>
perceptions. Such acts would then be M.O., not ritual.<br>
<br>
As previously stated, the perceptions of young victims may also be <br>
influenced by any trauma being experienced. This is the most popular <br>
alternative explanation, and even the more zealous believers of <br>
ritual abuse allegations use it, but only to explain obviously <br>
impossible events.<br>
 <br>
-- e. OVERZEALOUS INTERVENORS.<br>
<br>
*Overzealous intervenors*, causing intervenor contagion, may be a <br>
fifth answer. These intervenors can include parents, family members, <br>
foster parents, doctors, therapists, social workers, law enforcement <br>
officers, prosecutors, and any combination thereof. Victims have <br>
been subtly as well as overtly rewarded and bribed by usually well-<br>
meaning intervenors for furnishing further details. In addition, <br>
some of what appears not to have happened may have originated as a <br>
result of intervenors making assumptions about or misinterpreting <br>
what the victims are saying. The intervenors then repeat, and <br>
possibly embellish, these assumptions and misinterpretations, and <br>
eventually the victims are &quot;forced&quot; to agree with or come to accept <br>
this &quot;official&quot; version of what happened.<br>
<br>
The judgment of intervenors may be affected by their zeal to uncover <br>
child sexual abuse, satanic activity, or conspiracies. However <br>
&quot;well-intentioned&quot;, these overzealous intervenors must accept <br>
varying degrees of responsibility for the unsuccessful prosecution <br>
of those cases where criminal abuse did occur. This is the most <br>
controversial and least popular of the alternative explanations.<br>
<br>
-- f. URBAN LEGENDS.<br>
<br>
Allegations of and knowledge about ritualistic or satanic abuse may <br>
also be spread through *urban legends*. In _The Vanishing <br>
Hitchhiker_ (1981), the first of his four books on the topic, Dr. <br>
Jan Harold Brunvand defines urban legends as &quot;realistic stories <br>
concerning recent events (or alleged events) with an ironic or <br>
supernatural twist&quot; (p. xi). Dr. Brunvand's books convincingly <br>
explain that just because individuals throughout the country who <br>
never met each other tell the same story does not mean that it is <br>
true. Absurd urban legends about the corporate logos of Proctor and <br>
Gamble and Liz Claiborne being satanic symbols persist in spite of <br>
all efforts to refute them with reality. Some urban legends about <br>
child kidnappings and other threats to citizens have even been <br>
disseminated unknowingly by law enforcement agencies. Such legends <br>
have always existed, but today the mass media aggressively <br>
participate in their rapid and more efficient dissemination. Many <br>
Americans mistakenly believe that tabloid television shows check out <br>
and verify the details of their stories before pulling them on the <br>
air. Mass hysteria may partially account for large numbers of <br>
victims describing the same symptoms or experiences.<br>
<br>
Training conferences for all the disciplines involved in child <br>
sexual abuse may also play a role in the spread of this contagion. <br>
At one child abuse conference I attended, an exhibitor was selling <br>
more than 50 different books dealing with satanism and the occult. <br>
By the end of the conference, he had sold nearly all of them. At <br>
another national child sexual abuse conference, I witnessed more <br>
than 100 attendees copying down the widely disseminated 29 &quot;Symptoms <br>
Characterizing Satanic Ritual Abuse&quot; in preschool-aged children. Is <br>
a four-year-old child's &quot;preoccupation with urine and feces&quot; an <br>
indication of satanic ritual abuse or part of normal development?<br>
<br>
-- g. COMBINATION.<br>
<br>
Most multidimensional child sex ring cases probably involve a <br>
*combination* of the answers previously set forth, as well as other <br>
possible explanations unknown to me at this time. Obviously, cases <br>
with adult survivors are more likely to involve some of these <br>
answers than those with young children. Each case of sexual <br>
victimization must be individually evaluated on its own merits <br>
without any preconceived explanations. All the possibilities must be <br>
explored if for no other reason than the fact that the defense <br>
attorneys for any accused subjects will almost certainly do so.<br>
<br>
Most people would agree that just because a victim tells you one <br>
detail that turns out to be true, this does not mean that every <br>
detail is true. But many people seem to believe that if you can <br>
disprove one part of a victim's story, then the entire story is <br>
false. As previously stated, one of my main concerns in these cases <br>
is that people are getting away with sexually abusing children or <br>
committing other crimes because we cannot prove that they are <br>
members of organized cults that murder and eat people.<br>
<br>
I have discovered that the subject of multidimensional child sex <br>
rings is a very emotional and polarizing issue. Everyone seems to <br>
demand that one choose a side. On one side of the issue are those <br>
who say that nothing really happened and it is all a big witch hunt<br>
led by overzealous fanatics and incompetent &quot;experts&quot;. The other <br>
side says, in essence, that everything happened; victims never lie <br>
about child sexual abuse, and so it must be true.<br>
<br>
There is a middle ground. It is the job of the professional <br>
investigator to listen to all the victims and conduct appropriate <br>
investigation in an effort to find out what happened, considering <br>
all possibilities. Not all childhood trauma is abuse. Not all child <br>
abuse is a crime. The great frustration of these cases is the fact <br>
that you are often convinced that something traumatic happened to <br>
the victim, but do not know with any degree of certainty exactly <br>
what happened, when it happened, or who did it. <br>
<br>
7. DO VICTIMS LIE ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE AND EXPLOITATION?<br>
<br>
The crucial central issue in the evaluation of a response to cases <br>
of multidimensional child sex rings is the statement &quot;Children never <br>
lie about sexual abuse or exploitation. If they have details, it <br>
must have happened.&quot; This statement, oversimplified by many, is the <br>
basic premise upon which some believe the child sexual abuse and <br>
exploitation movement is based. It is almost never questioned or <br>
debated at training conferences. In fact, during the 1970s, there <br>
was a successful crusade to eliminate laws requiring corroboration <br>
of child victim statements in child sexual abuse cases. The best way <br>
to convict child molesters is to have the child victims testify in <br>
court. If we believe them, the jury will believe them. Any challenge <br>
to this basic premise was viewed as a threat to the movement and a <br>
denial that the problem existed.<br>
<br>
I believe that children *rarely* lie about sexual abuse or <br>
exploitation, if a lie is defined as a statement deliberately and <br>
maliciously intended to deceive. The problem is the <br>
oversimplification of the statement. Just because a child is not <br>
lying does not necessarily mean the child is telling the truth. I <br>
believe that in the majority of these cases, the victims are not <br>
lying. They are telling you what they have come to believe has <br>
happened to them. Furthermore the assumption that children rarely <br>
lie about sexual abuse does not necessarily apply to everything a <br>
child says during a sexual abuse investigation. Stories of <br>
mutilation, murder, and cannibalism are not really about sexual <br>
abuse.<br>
<br>
Children rarely lie about sexual abuse or exploitation. but they do <br>
fantasize, furnish false information, furnish misleading <br>
information, misperceive events, try to please adults, respond to <br>
leading questions, and respond to rewards. Children are not adults <br>
in little bodies and do go through developmental stages that must be <br>
evaluated and understood. In many ways, however, children are no <br>
better and no worse than other victims or witnesses of a crime. They <br>
should not be automatically believed, nor should they be <br>
automatically disbelieved.<br>
<br>
The second part of the statement - if children can supply details, <br>
the crime must have happened - must also be carefully evaluated. The <br>
details in question in most of the cases of multidimensional child <br>
sex rings have little to do with sexual activity. Law enforcement <br>
and social workers must do more than attempt to determine how a <br>
child could have known about the sex acts. These cases involve <br>
determining how a victim could have known about a wide variety of <br>
bizarre and ritualistic activity. Young children may know little <br>
about specific sex acts, but they may know a lot about monsters, <br>
torture, kidnapping, and murder.<br>
<br>
Victims may supply details of sexual and other acts using <br>
information from sources other than their own direct victimization. <br>
Such sources must be evaluated carefully by the investigator of<br>
multidimensional child sex rings.<br>
<br>
-- a. PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE.<br>
<br>
The victim may have personal knowledge of the sexual or ritual acts, <br>
but not as a result of the alleged victimization. The knowledge <br>
could have come from viewing pornography, sex education, or occult <br>
material; witnessing sexual or ritual activity in the home; or <br>
witnessing the sexual abuse of others. It could also have come from <br>
having been sexually or physically abused, but by other than the <br>
alleged offenders and in ways other than the alleged offense.<br>
<br>
-- b. OTHER CHILDREN OR VICTIMS.<br>
<br>
Young children today are socially interacting more often and at a <br>
younger age than ever before. Many parents are unable to provide <br>
possibly simple explanations for their children's stories because <br>
they were not with the children when the events occurred. They do <br>
not even know what videotapes their children may have seen, what <br>
games they may have played, or what stories they may have been told <br>
or overheard. Children are being placed in day care centers for <br>
eight, ten, or twelve hours a day starting as young as six weeks of <br>
age. The children share experiences by playing house, school, or <br>
doctor. Bodily functions such as urination and defecation are a <br>
focus of attention for these young children. To a certain extent, <br>
each child shares the experiences of all the other children.<br>
<br>
The odds are fairly high that in any typical day care center there <br>
might be some children who are victims of incest; victims of <br>
physical abuse; victims of psychological abuse; children of cult <br>
members (even satanists); children of sexually open parents; <br>
children of sexually indiscriminate parents; children of parents <br>
obsessed with victimization; children of parents obsessed with the <br>
evils of satanism; children without conscience; children with a <br>
teenage brother or pregnant mother; children with heavy metal music <br>
and literature in the home; children with bizarre toys, games, <br>
comics, and magazines; children with a VCR and slasher films in <br>
their home; children with access to dial-a-porn, party lines, or <br>
pornography; or children victimized by a day care center staff <br>
member. The possible effects of the interaction of such children <br>
prior to the disclosure of the alleged abuse must be evaluated, <br>
Adult survivors may obtain details from group therapy sessions, <br>
support networks, church groups, or self-help groups. The <br>
willingness and ability of siblings to corroborate adult survivor <br>
accounts of ritual abuse varies. Some will support and partially <br>
corroborate the victim's allegations. Others will vehemently deny <br>
them and support their accused parents or relatives.<br>
<br>
-- c. MEDIA.<br>
<br>
The amount of sexually explicit, occult, anti-occult, or violence-<br>
oriented material available to adults and even children in the <br>
modern world is overwhelming. This includes movies, videotapes, <br>
television, music, toys, and books. There are also documentaries on <br>
satanism, witchcraft, and the occult that are available on <br>
videotape. Most of the televangelists have videotapes on the topics <br>
that they are selling on their programs.<br>
<br>
The National Coalition on Television Violence News (1988) estimates <br>
that 12% of the movies produced in the United States can be <br>
classified as satanic horror films. Cable television and the home <br>
VCR make all this material readily available even to young children. <br>
Religious broadcasters and almost all the television tabloid and <br>
magazine programs have done shows on satanism and the occult. Heavy <br>
metal and black metal music, which often has a satanic theme, is <br>
readily available and popular. In addition to the much-debated<br>
fantasy role-playing games, there are numerous popular toys on the <br>
market with an occult-oriented, bizarre, or violent theme.<br>
<br>
Books on satanism and the occult, both fiction and nonfiction, are <br>
readily available in most bookstores, especially Christian <br>
bookstores. Several recent books specifically discuss the issue of <br>
ritual abuse of children. Obviously, very young children do not read <br>
this material, but their parents, relatives, and therapists might <br>
and then discuss it in front of or with them. Much of the material <br>
intended to fight the problem actually fuels the problem and damages <br>
effective prosecution.<br>
<br>
-- d. SUGGESTIONS AND LEADING QUESTIONS.<br>
<br>
This problem is particularly important in cases stemming from <br>
custody/visitation disputes involving at least one child under the <br>
age of seven. It is my opinion that most suggestive, leading <br>
questioning of children by intervenors is inadvertently done as part <br>
of a good-faith effort to learn the truth. Not all intervenors are <br>
in equal positions to potentially influence victim allegations. <br>
Parents and relatives especially are in a position to subtly <br>
influence their young children to describe their victimization in a <br>
certain way. Children may also overhear their parents discussing the <br>
details of the case. Children often tell their parents what they <br>
believe their parents want or need to hear. Some children may be <br>
instinctively attempting to provide &quot;therapy&quot; for their parents by <br>
telling them what seems to satisfy them and somehow makes them feel <br>
better. In one case a father gave the police a tape recording to <br>
&quot;prove&quot; that his child's statements were spontaneous disclosures and <br>
not the result of leading, suggestive questions. The tape recording <br>
indicated just the opposite. Why then did the father voluntarily <br>
give it to the police? Probably because he truly believed that he <br>
was not influencing his child's statements - but he was. <br>
<br>
Therapists are probably in the best position to influence the <br>
allegations of adult survivors. The accuracy and reliability of the <br>
accounts of adult survivors who have been hypnotized during therapy <br>
is certainly open to question. One nationally-known therapist <br>
personally told me that the reason police cannot find out about <br>
satanic or ritualistic activity from child victims is that they do <br>
not know how to ask leading questions. Highly suggestive books and <br>
pictures portraying &quot;satanic&quot; activity have been developed and <br>
marketed to therapists for use during evaluation and treatment. <br>
Types and styles of verbal interaction useful in therapy may create <br>
significant problems in a criminal investigation. It should be <br>
noted, however, that when a therapist does a poor investigative <br>
interview as part of a criminal investigation, that is the fault of <br>
the criminal justice system that allowed it and not the therapist <br>
who did it.<br>
<br>
The extremely sensitive, emotional, and religious nature of these <br>
cases makes problems with leading questions more likely than in <br>
other kinds of cases. Intervenors motivated by religious fervor <br>
and/or exaggerated concerns about sexual abuse of children are more <br>
likely to lose their objectivity.<br>
<br>
-- e. MISPERCEPTION AND CONFUSION.<br>
<br>
In one case, a child's description of the apparently impossible act <br>
of walking through a wall turned out to be the very possible act of <br>
walking between the studs of an unfinished wall in a room under <br>
construction. In another case, pennies in the anus turned out to be <br>
copper-foil-covered suppositories. The children may describe what <br>
they believe happened. It is not a lie, but neither is it an <br>
accurate account of what happened.<br>
<br>
-- f. EDUCATION AND AWARENESS PROGRAMS.<br>
<br>
Some well-intentioned awareness programs designed to prevent child <br>
set abuse, alert professionals, or fight satanism may in fact be <br>
unrealistically increasing the fears of professionals, children, and <br>
parents and creating self-fulfilling prophesies. Some of what <br>
children and their parents are telling intervenors may have been <br>
learned in or fueled by such programs. Religious programs, books, <br>
and pamphlets that emphasize the power and evil force of Satan may <br>
be adding to the problem. In fact most of the day care centers in <br>
which ritualistic abuse is alleged to hate taken place are church-<br>
affiliated centers, and many of the adult survivors alleging it come <br>
from apparently religious families. <br>
<br>
8. LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE.<br>
<br>
The perspective with which one looks at satanic, occult, or <br>
ritualistic crime is extremely important. As stated, sociologists, <br>
therapists, religious leaders, parents, and just plain citizens each <br>
have their own valid concerns and views about this issue. This <br>
discussion, however, deals primarily with the law enforcement or <br>
criminal justice perspective.<br>
<br>
When you combine an emotional issue such as the sexual abuse of <br>
children with an even more emotional issue such as people's <br>
religious beliefs, it is difficult to maintain objectivity and <br>
remember the law enforcement perspective. Some police officers may <br>
even feel that all crime is caused by evil, all evil is caused by <br>
Satan, and therefore, all crime is satanic crime. This may be a <br>
valid religious perspective, but it is of no relevance to the <br>
investigation of crime for purposes of prosecution.<br>
<br>
Many of the police officers who lecture on satanic or occult crime <br>
do not even investigate such cases. Their presentations are more a <br>
reflection of their personal religious beliefs than documented <br>
investigative information. They are absolutely entitled to their <br>
beliefs, but introducing themselves as current or former police <br>
officers and then speaking as religious advocates causes confusion. <br>
As difficult as it might be, police officers must separate the <br>
religious and law enforcement perspectives when they are lecturing <br>
or investigating in their official capacities as law enforcement <br>
officers. Many law enforcement officers begin their presentations by <br>
stating that they are not addressing or judging anyone's religious <br>
beliefs, and then proceed to do exactly that.<br>
<br>
Some police officers have resigned rather than curtail or limit <br>
their involvement in this issue as ordered by their departments. <br>
Perhaps such officers deserve credit for recognizing that they could <br>
no longer keep the perspectives separate.<br>
<br>
Law enforcement officers and all professionals in this field should <br>
avoid the &quot;paranoia&quot; that has crept into this issue and into some of <br>
the training conferences. Paranoid type belief systems are <br>
characterized by the gradual development of intricate, complex, and <br>
elaborate systems of thinking based on and often proceeding <br>
logically from misinterpretation of actual events. Paranoia <br>
typically involves hypervigilance over the perceived threat, the <br>
belief that danger is around every corner, and the willingness to <br>
take up the challenge and do something about it. Another very <br>
important aspect of this paranoia is the belief that those who do <br>
not recognize the threat are evil and corrupt. In this extreme view, <br>
you are either with them or against them. You are either part of the <br>
solution or part of the problem.<br>
<br>
Overzealousness and exaggeration motivated by the true religious <br>
fervor of those involved is more acceptable than that motivated by<br>
ego or profit. There are those who are deliberately distorting and <br>
hyping this issue for personal notoriety and profit. Satanic and <br>
occult crime and ritual abuse of children has become a growth <br>
industry. Speaking fees, books, video and audio tapes, prevention <br>
material, television and radio appearances all bring egoistic and <br>
financial rewards.<br>
<br>
Bizarre crime and evil can occur without organized satanic activity. <br>
The professional perspective requires that we distinguish between <br>
what we know and what we're not sure of.<br>
<br>
The facts are:<br>
<br>
-- a. Some individuals believe in and are involved in something <br>
commonly called satanism and the occult.<br>
<br>
-- b. Some of these individuals commit crime.<br>
<br>
-- c. Some groups of individuals share these beliefs and involvement <br>
in this satanism and the occult.<br>
<br>
-- d. Some members of these groups commit crime together.<br>
<br>
The unanswered questions are:<br>
<br>
-- a. What is the connection between the belief system and the <br>
crimes committed?<br>
<br>
-- b. Is there an organized conspiracy of satanic and occult <br>
believers responsible for interrelated serious crime (e.g., <br>
molestation, murder)?<br>
<br>
After all the hype and hysteria are put aside, the realization sets <br>
in that most satanic/occult activity involves the commission of *no* <br>
crimes, and that which does usually involves the commission of <br>
relatively minor crimes such as trespassing, vandalism, cruelty to <br>
animals, or petty thievery.<br>
<br>
The law enforcement problems most often linked to satanic or occult <br>
activity are:<br>
<br>
-- a. Vandalism.<br>
<br>
-- b. Desecration of churches and cemeteries.<br>
<br>
-- c. Thefts from churches and cemeteries.<br>
<br>
-- d. Teenage gangs<br>
<br>
-- e. Animal mutilations.<br>
<br>
-- f. Teenage suicide.<br>
<br>
-- g. Child abuse.<br>
<br>
-- h. Kidnapping.<br>
<br>
-- i. Murder and human sacrifice<br>
<br>
Valid evidence shows some &quot;connection&quot; between satanism and the <br>
occult and the first six problems (#a-f) set forth above. The <br>
&quot;connection&quot; to the last three problems (#g-i) is far more <br>
uncertain.<br>
<br>
Even where there seems to be a &quot;connection&quot;, the nature of the <br>
connection needs to be explored. It is easy to blame involvement in<br>
satanism and the occult for behaviors that have complex motivations. <br>
A teenager's excessive involvement in satanism and the occult is <br>
usually a symptom of a problem and not the cause of a problem. <br>
Blaming satanism for a teenager's vandalism, theft, suicide, or even <br>
act of murder is like blaming a criminal's offenses on his tattoos: <br>
Both are often signs of the same rebelliousness and lack of self-<br>
esteem that contribute to the commission of crimes.<br>
<br>
The rock band Judas Priest was recently sued for allegedly inciting <br>
two teenagers to suicide through subliminal messages in their <br>
recordings. In 1991 Anthony Pratkanis of the University of <br>
California at Santa Cruz, who served as an expert witness for the <br>
defense, stated the boys in question &quot;lived troubled lives, lives of <br>
drug and alcohol abuse, run-ins with the law ... family violence, <br>
and chronic unemployment. What issues did the trial and the <br>
subsequent mass media coverage emphasize? Certainly not the need for <br>
drug treatment centers; there was no evaluation of the pros and cons <br>
of America's juvenile justice system, no investigation of the <br>
schools, no inquiry into how to prevent family violence, no <br>
discussion of the effects of unemployment on a family. Instead our <br>
attention was mesmerized by an attempt to count the number of <br>
subliminal demons that can dance on the end of a record needle&quot; (p. <br>
1).<br>
<br>
The law enforcement investigator must objectively evaluate the legal <br>
significance of any criminal's spiritual beliefs. In most cases, <br>
including those involving satanists, it will have little or no legal <br>
significance. If a crime is committed as part of a spiritual belief <br>
system, it should make no difference which belief system it is. The <br>
crime is the same whether a child is abused or murdered as part of a <br>
Christian, Hare Krishna, Moslem, or any other belief system. We <br>
generally don't label crimes with the name of the perpetrator's <br>
religion. Why then are the crimes of child molesters, rapists, <br>
sadists, and murderers who happen to be involved in satanism and the <br>
occult labeled as satanic or occult crimes? If criminals use a <br>
spiritual belief system to rationalize and justify or to facilitate <br>
and enhance their criminal activity, should the focus of law <br>
enforcement be on the belief system or on the criminal activity? <br>
<br>
Several documented murders have been committed by individuals <br>
involved in one way or another in satanism or the occult. In some of <br>
these murders the perpetrator has even introduced elements of the <br>
occult (e.g. satanic symbols at crime scene). Does that <br>
automatically make these satanic murders? It is my opinion that the <br>
answer is no. Ritualistic murders committed by serial killers or <br>
sexual sadists are not necessarily satanic or occult murders. <br>
Ritualistic murders committed by psychotic killers who hear the <br>
voice of Satan are no more satanic murders than murders committed by <br>
psychotic killers who hear the voice of Jesus are Christian murders.<br>
<br>
Rather a satanic murder should be defined as one committed by two or <br>
more individuals who rationally plan the crime and whose *primary* <br>
motivation is to fulfill a prescribed satanic ritual calling for the <br>
murder. By this definition I have been unable to identify even one <br>
documented satanic murder in the United States. Although such <br>
murders may have and can occur, they appear to be few in number. In <br>
addition the commission of such killings would probably be the <br>
beginning of the end for such a group. It is highly unlikely that <br>
they could continue to kill several people, every year, year after <br>
year, and not be discovered.<br>
<br>
A brief typology of satanic and occult practitioners is helpful in <br>
evaluating what relationship, if any, such practices have to crimes <br>
under investigation. The following typology is adapted from the <br>
investigative experience of Officer Sandi Gallant of the San <br>
Francisco Police Department, who began to study the criminal aspects<br>
of occult activity long before it became popular. No typology is <br>
perfect, but I use this typology because it is simple and offers <br>
investigative insights. Most practitioners fall into one of three <br>
categories, any of which can be practiced alone or in groups:<br>
<br>
-- a. &quot;YOUTH SUBCULTURE.<br>
<br>
&quot;Most teenagers involved in fantasy role-playing games, heavy metal <br>
music, or satanism and the occult are going through a stage of <br>
adolescent development and commit no significant crimes. The <br>
teenagers who have more serious problems are usually those from <br>
dysfunctional families or those who have poor communication within <br>
their families. These troubled teenagers turn to satanism and the <br>
occult to overcome a sense of alienation, to rebel, to obtain power, <br>
or to justify their antisocial behavior. For these teenagers it is <br>
the symbolism, not the spirituality, that is more important. It is <br>
either the psychopathic or the oddball, loner teenager who is most <br>
likely to get into serious trouble. Extreme involvement in the <br>
occult is a symptom of a problem, not the cause. This is not to <br>
deny, however, that satanism and the occult can be negative <br>
influences for a troubled teenager. But to hysterically warn <br>
teenagers to avoid this &quot;mysterious, powerful and dangerous&quot; thing <br>
called satanism will drive more teenagers right to it. Some <br>
rebellious teenagers will do whatever will most shock and outrage <br>
society in order to flaunt their rejection of adult norms.<br>
<br>
-- b. &quot;DABBLERS (SELF-STYLED).<br>
<br>
&quot;For these practitioners there is little or no spiritual motivation. <br>
They may mix satanism, witchcraft, paganism, and any aspects of the <br>
occult to suit their purposes. Symbols mean whatever they want them <br>
or believe them to mean. Molesters, rapists, drug dealers, and <br>
murderers may dabble in the occult and may even commit their crimes <br>
in a ceremonial or ritualistic way. This category has the potential <br>
to be the most dangerous, and most of the &quot;satanic&quot; killers fall <br>
into this category. Their involvement in satanism and the occult is <br>
a symptom of a problem, and a rationalization and justification of <br>
antisocial behavior. Satanic/occult practices (as well as those of <br>
other spiritual belief systems) can also be used as a mechanism to <br>
facilitate criminal objectives.<br>
<br>
-- c. &quot;TRADITIONAL (ORTHODOX).<br>
<br>
&quot;These are the so-called true believers. They are often wary of <br>
outsiders. Because of this and constitutional issues, such groups <br>
are difficult for law enforcement to penetrate. Although there may <br>
be much we don't know about these groups, as of now there is little <br>
or no hard evidence that as a group they are involved in serious, <br>
organized criminal activity. In addition, instead of being self-<br>
perpetuating master crime conspirators, &quot;true believers&quot; probably <br>
have a similar problem with their teenagers rebelling against their <br>
belief system. To some extent even these Traditional satanists are <br>
self-stylized. They practice what they have come to believe is <br>
&quot;satanism&quot;. There is little or no evidence of the much-discussed <br>
multigenerational satanists whose beliefs and practices have <br>
supposedly been passed down through the centuries. Many admitted <br>
adult satanists were in fact raised in conservative Christian <br>
homes.&quot;<br>
<br>
_Washington Post_ editor Walt Harrington reported in a 1986 story on <br>
Anton LaVey and his Church of Satan that &quot;sociologists who have <br>
studied LaVey's church say that its members often had serious <br>
childhood problems like alcoholic parents or broken homes, or that <br>
they were traumatized by guilt-ridden fundamentalist upbringings, <br>
turning to Satanism as a dramatic way to purge their debilitating <br>
guilt&quot; (p. 14).<br>
<br>
Some have claimed that the accounts of ritual abuse victims coincide <br>
with historical records of what traditional or multigenerational <br>
satanists are known to have practiced down through the ages. Jeffrey <br>
Burton Russell, Professor of History at the University of California <br>
at Santa Barbara and the author of numerous scholarly books on the <br>
devil and satanism, believes that the universal consensus of modern <br>
historians on satanism is (personal communication, Nov. 1991):<br>
<br>
&quot;(1) incidents of orgy, infanticide, cannibalism, and other such <br>
conduct have occurred from the ancient world down to the present; <br>
(2) such incidents were isolated and limited to local antisocial <br>
groups; (3) during the period of Christian dominance in European <br>
culture, such groups were associated with the Devil in the minds of <br>
the authorities; (4) in some cases the sectaries believed that they <br>
were worshiping Satan; (5) no organized cult of Satanists existed in <br>
the Christian period beyond localities, and on no account was there <br>
ever any widespread Satanist organization or conspiracy; (6) no <br>
reliable historical sources indicate that such organizations <br>
existed; (7) the black mass appears only once in the sources before <br>
the late nineteenth century.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Many police officers ask what to look for during the search of the <br>
scene of suspected satanic activity. The answer is simple: Look for <br>
evidence of a crime. A pentagram is no more criminally significant <br>
than a crucifix unless it corroborates a crime or a criminal <br>
conspiracy. If a victim's description of the location or the <br>
instruments of the crime includes a pentagram, then the pentagram <br>
would be evidence. But the same would be true if the description <br>
included a crucifix. In many cases of alleged satanic ritual abuse, <br>
investigation can find evidence that the claimed offenders are <br>
members only of mainstream churches and are often described as very <br>
religious.<br>
<br>
There is no way any one law enforcement officer can become <br>
knowledgeable about all the symbols and rituals of every spiritual <br>
belief system that might become part of a criminal investigation. <br>
The officer needs only to be trained to recognize the possible <br>
investigative significance of such signs, symbols, and rituals. <br>
Knowledgeable religious scholars, academics, and other true experts <br>
in the community can be consulted if a more detailed analysis is <br>
necessary.<br>
<br>
Any analysis, however, may have only limited application, especially <br>
to cases involving teenagers, dabblers, and other self-styled <br>
practitioners. The fact is signs, symbols, and rituals can mean <br>
anything that practitioners want them to mean and/or anything that <br>
observers interpret them to mean.<br>
<br>
The meaning of symbols can also change over time, place, and <br>
circumstance. Is a swastika spray-painted on a wall an ancient <br>
symbol of prosperity and good fortune, a recent symbol of Nazism and <br>
anti-Semitism, or a current symbol of hate, paranoia, and adolescent <br>
defiance? The peace sign which in the 1960s was a familiar antiwar <br>
symbol is now supposed to be a satanic symbol. Some symbols and <br>
holidays become &quot;satanic&quot; only because the antisatanists say they <br>
are. Then those who want to be &quot;satanists&quot; adopt them, and now you <br>
have &quot;proof&quot; they are satanic.<br>
<br>
In spite of what is sometimes said or suggested at law enforcement <br>
training conferences, police have no authority to seize any satanic <br>
or occult paraphernalia they might see during a search. A legally-<br>
valid reason must exist for doing so. It is not the job of law <br>
enforcement to prevent satanists from engaging in noncriminal <br>
teaching, rituals, or other activities. <br>
<br>
9. INVESTIGATING MULTIDIMENSIONAL CHILD SEX RINGS.<br>
<br>
Multidimensional child sex rings can be among the most difficult, <br>
frustrating, and complex cases that any law enforcement officer will <br>
ever investigate. The investigation of allegations of recent <br>
activity from multiple young children under the age of seven <br>
presents one set of problems and must begin quickly, with interviews <br>
of *all* potential victims being completed as soon as possible. The <br>
investigation of allegations of activity ten or more years earlier <br>
from adult survivors presents other problems and should proceed, <br>
unless victims are at immediate risk, more deliberately, with <br>
gradually-increasing resources as corroborated facts warrant.<br>
<br>
In spite of any skepticism, allegations of ritual abuse should be <br>
aggressively and thoroughly investigated, This investigation should <br>
attempt to corroborate the allegations of ritual abuse. but should <br>
*simultaneously* also attempt to identify alternative explanations. <br>
The only debate is over how much investigation is enough. Any law <br>
enforcement agency must be prepared to defend and justify its <br>
actions when scrutinized by the public, the media, elected <br>
officials, or the courts. This does not mean, however, that a law <br>
enforcement agency has an obligation to prove that the alleged <br>
crimes did not occur. This is almost always impossible to do and <br>
investigators should be alert for and avoid this trap.<br>
<br>
One major problem in the investigation of multidimensional child sex <br>
rings is the dilemma of recognizing soon enough that you have one. <br>
Investigators must be alert for cases with the potential for the <br>
four basic dynamics: (a) multiple young victims, (b) multiple <br>
offenders, (c) fear as the controlling tactic, and (d) bizarre or <br>
ritualistic activity. The following techniques apply primarily to <br>
the investigation of such multidimensional child sex rings:<br>
<br>
<br>
-- a. MINIMIZE SATANIC/OCCULT ASPECT.<br>
<br>
There are those who claim that one of the major reasons more of <br>
these cases have not been successfully prosecuted is that the <br>
satanic/occult aspect has not been aggressively pursued. One state <br>
has even introduced legislation creating added penalties when <br>
certain crimes are committed as part of a ritual or ceremony. A few <br>
states have passed special ritual crime laws. I strongly disagree <br>
with such an approach. It makes no difference what spiritual belief <br>
system was used to enhance and facilitate or rationalize and justify <br>
criminal behavior. It serves no purpose to &quot;prove&quot; someone is a <br>
satanist. As a matter of fact, if it is alleged that the subject <br>
committed certain criminal acts under the influence of or in order <br>
to conjure up supernatural spirits or forces, this may very well be <br>
the basis for an insanity or diminished capacity defense, or may <br>
damage the intent aspect of a sexually motivated crime. The defense <br>
may very well be more interested in all the &quot;evidence of satanic <br>
activity&quot;. Some of the satanic crime &quot;experts&quot; who train law <br>
enforcement wind up working or testifying for the defense in these <br>
cases.<br>
<br>
It is best to focus on the crime and all the evidence to corroborate <br>
its commission. Information about local satanic or occult activity <br>
is only of value if it is based on specific law enforcement <br>
intelligence and not on some vague, unsubstantiated generalities <br>
from religious groups. Cases are not solved by decoding signs, <br>
symbols, and dates using undocumented satanic crime &quot;manuals&quot;. In <br>
one case a law enforcement agency executing a search warrant seized <br>
only the satanic paraphernalia and left behind the other evidence <br>
that would have corroborated victim statements. Cases are solved by <br>
people- and behavior-oriented investigation. Evidence of satanic or <br>
occult activity may help explain certain aspects of the case, but<br>
even offenders who commit crimes in a spiritual context are usually <br>
motivated by power, sex, and money.<br>
<br>
-- b. KEEP INVESTIGATION AND RELIGIOUS BELIEFS SEPARATE.<br>
<br>
I believe that one of the biggest mistakes any investigator of these <br>
cases can make is to attribute supernatural powers to the offenders. <br>
During an investigation a good investigator may sometimes be able to <br>
use the beliefs and superstitions of the offenders to his or her <br>
advantage. The reverse happens if the investigator believes that the <br>
offenders possess supernatural powers. Satanic/occult practitioners <br>
have no more power than any other human beings. Law enforcement <br>
officers who believe that the investigation of these cases puts them <br>
in conflict with the supernatural forces of evil should probably not <br>
be assigned to them. The religious beliefs of officers should <br>
provide spiritual strength and support for them but should not <br>
affect the objectivity and professionalism of the investigation.<br>
<br>
It is easy to get caught up in these cases and begin to see <br>
&quot;satanism&quot; everywhere. Oversensitization to this perceived threat <br>
may cause an investigator to &quot;see&quot; satanism in a crime when it <br>
really is not there (quasi-satanism). Often the eye sees what the <br>
mind perceives. It may also cause an investigator not to recognize a <br>
staged crime scene deliberately seeded with &quot;satanic clues&quot; in order <br>
to mislead the police (pseudo-satanism). On rare occasions an <br>
overzealous investigator or intervenor may even be tempted to plant <br>
&quot;evidence of satanism&quot; in order to corroborate such allegations and <br>
beliefs. Supervisors need to be alert for and monitor these <br>
reactions in their investigators.<br>
<br>
-- c. LISTEN TO THE VICTIMS.<br>
<br>
It is not the investigator's duty to believe the victims; it is his <br>
or her job to listen and be an objective fact finder. Interviews of <br>
young children should be done by investigators trained and <br>
experienced in such interviews. Investigators must have direct <br>
access to the alleged victims for interview purposes. Therapists for <br>
an adult survivor sometimes want to act as intermediaries in their <br>
patient's interview. This should be avoided if at all possible. <br>
Adult survivor interviews are often confusing difficult and <br>
extremely time-consuming. The investigator must remember however <br>
that almost anything is possible. Most important the investigator <br>
must remember that there is much middle ground. Just because one <br>
event did happen does not mean that all reported events happened, <br>
and just because one event did not happen does not mean that all <br>
other events did not happen. Do not become such a zealot that you <br>
believe it all nor such a cynic that you believe nothing. Varying <br>
amounts and parts of the allegation may be factual. Attempting to <br>
find evidence of what did happen is the great challenge of these <br>
cases. *All* investigative interaction with victims must be <br>
carefully and thoroughly documented.<br>
<br>
-- d. ASSESS AND EVALUATE VICTIM STATEMENTS.<br>
<br>
This is the part of the investigative process in child sexual <br>
victimization cases that seems to have been lost. Is the victim <br>
describing events and activities that are consistent with law <br>
enforcement documented criminal behavior, or that are consistent <br>
with distorted media accounts and erroneous public perceptions of <br>
criminal behavior? Investigators should apply the &quot;template of <br>
probability&quot;. Accounts of child sexual victimization that are more <br>
like books, television, and movies (e.g. big conspiracies, child sex <br>
slaves, organized pornography rings) and less like documented cases <br>
should be viewed with skepticism but thoroughly investigated. <br>
Consider and investigate all possible explanations of events. It is <br>
the investigator's job, and the information learned will be<br>
invaluable in counteracting the defense attorneys when they raise <br>
the alternative explanations.<br>
<br>
For example, an adult survivor's account of ritual victimization <br>
might be explained by any one of at least four possibilities: First, <br>
the allegations may be a fairly accurate account what actually <br>
happened. Second, they may be deliberate lies (malingering), told <br>
for the usual reasons people lie (e.g. money, revenge, jealousy). <br>
Third, they may be deliberate lies (factitious disorder) told for <br>
atypical reasons (e.g. attention, forgiveness). Lies so motivated <br>
are less likely to be recognized by the investigator and more likely <br>
to be rigidly maintained by the liar unless and until confronted <br>
with irrefutable evidence to the contrary. Fourth, the allegations <br>
may be a highly inaccurate account of what actually happened, but <br>
the victim truly believes it (pseudomemory) and therefore is not <br>
lying. A polygraph examination of such a victim would be of limited <br>
value. Other explanations or combinations of these explanations are <br>
also possible. *Only* thorough *investigation* will point to the <br>
correct or most likely explanation. <br>
<br>
Investigators cannot rely on therapists or satanic crime experts as <br>
a shortcut to the explanation. In one case, the &quot;experts&quot; confirmed <br>
and validated the account of a female who claimed to be a 15-year-<br>
old deaf-mute kidnapped and held for three years by a satanic cult <br>
and forced to participate in bizarre rituals before recently <br>
escaping. Active investigation, however, determined she was a 27-<br>
year-old woman who could hear and speak, who had not been kidnapped <br>
by anyone, and who had a lengthy history of mental problems and at <br>
least three other similar reports of false victimization. Her <br>
&quot;accurate&quot; accounts of what the &quot;real satanists&quot; do were simply the <br>
result of having read, while in mental hospitals, the same books <br>
that the &quot;experts&quot; had. A therapist may have important insights <br>
about whether an individual was traumatized, but knowing the exact <br>
cause of that trauma is another matter. There have been cases where <br>
investigation has discovered that individuals diagnosed by <br>
therapists as suffering from Post-Vietnam Syndrome were never in <br>
Vietnam or saw no combat.<br>
<br>
Conversely, in another case, a law enforcement &quot;expert&quot; on satanic <br>
crime told a therapist that a patient's accounts of satanic murders <br>
in a rural Pacific Northwest town were probably true because the <br>
community was a hotbed of such satanic activity. When the therapist <br>
explained that there was almost no violent crime reported in the <br>
community, the officer explained that that is how you know it is the <br>
satanists. If you knew about the murders or found the bodies, it <br>
would not be satanists. How do you argue with that kind of logic?<br>
<br>
The first step in the assessment and evaluation of victim statements <br>
is to determine the disclosure sequence, including how much time has <br>
elapsed since disclosure was first made and the incident was <br>
reported to the police or social services. The longer the delay, the <br>
bigger the potential for problems. The next step is to determine the <br>
number and purpose of *all prior* interviews of the victim <br>
concerning the allegations. The more interviews conducted before the <br>
investigative interview, the larger the potential for problems. <br>
Although there is nothing wrong with admitting shortcomings and <br>
seeking help, law enforcement should never abdicate its control over <br>
the investigative interview. When an investigative interview is <br>
conducted by or with a social worker or therapist using a team <br>
approach, law enforcement must direct the process. Problems can also <br>
be created by interviews conducted by various intervenors *after* <br>
the investigative interview(s).<br>
<br>
The investigator must closely and carefully evaluate events in the <br>
victim's life before, during, and after the alleged abuse.<br>
<br>
Events to be evaluated *before* the alleged abuse include:<br>
<br>
---- (1) Background of victim.<br>
---- (2) Abuse of drugs in home.<br>
---- (3) Pornography in home.<br>
---- (4) Play, television, and VCR habits.<br>
---- (5) Attitudes about sexuality in home.<br>
---- (6) Extent of sex education in home.<br>
---- (7) Activities of siblings.<br>
---- (8) Need or craving for attention.<br>
---- (9) Religious beliefs and training.<br>
---- (10) Childhood fears.<br>
---- (11) Custody/visitation disputes.<br>
---- (12) Victimization of or by family members.<br>
---- (13) Interaction between victims.<br>
<br>
Events to be evaluated *during* the alleged abuse include:<br>
<br>
---- (1) Use of fear or scare tactics.<br>
---- (2) Degree of trauma.<br>
---- (3) Use of magic deception or trickery.<br>
---- (4) Use of rituals.<br>
---- (5) Use of drugs.<br>
---- (6) Use of pornography.<br>
<br>
Events to be evaluated *after* the alleged abuse include:<br>
<br>
---- (1) Disclosure sequence.<br>
---- (2) Background of prior interviewers.<br>
---- (3) Background of parents.<br>
---- (4) Co-mingling of victims.<br>
---- (5) Type of therapy received.<br>
<br>
-- e. EVALUATE CONTAGION.<br>
<br>
Consistent statements obtained from different multiple victims are <br>
powerful pieces of corroborative evidence - that is as long as those <br>
statements were not &quot;contaminated&quot;. Investigation must carefully <br>
evaluate both pre- and post-disclosure contagion, and both victim <br>
and intervenor contagion. Are the different victim statements <br>
consistent because they describe common experiences or events, or <br>
because they reflect contamination or urban legends?<br>
<br>
The sources of potential contagion are widespread. Victims can <br>
communicate with each other both prior to and after their <br>
disclosures. Intervenors can communicate with each other and with <br>
victims. The team or cell concepts of investigation are attempts to <br>
deal with potential investigator contagion. All the victims are not <br>
interviewed by the same individuals, and interviewers do not <br>
necessarily share information directly with each other. Teams report <br>
to a leader or supervisor who evaluates the information and decides <br>
what other investigators need to know.<br>
<br>
Documenting existing contagion and eliminating additional contagion <br>
are crucial to the successful investigation and prosecution of these <br>
cases. There is no way, however, to erase or undo contagion. The <br>
best you can hope for is to identify and evaluate it and attempt to <br>
explain it. Mental health professionals requested to evaluate <br>
suspected victims must be carefully selected. Having a victim <br>
evaluated by one of the self-proclaimed experts on satanic ritual <br>
abuse or by some other overzealous intervenor may result in the <br>
credibility of that victim's testimony being severely damaged.<br>
<br>
In order to evaluate the contagion element, investigators must <br>
meticulously and aggressively investigate these cases. The precise <br>
disclosure sequence of the victim must be carefully identified and<br>
documented. Investigators must verify through active investigation <br>
the exact nature and content of each disclosure outcry or statement <br>
made by the victim. Second-hand information about disclosure is not <br>
good enough.<br>
<br>
Whenever possible, personal visits should be made to all locations <br>
of alleged abuse and the victim's homes. Events prior to the alleged <br>
abuse must be carefully evaluated. Investigators may have to view <br>
television programs, films, and videotapes seen by the victims. It <br>
may be necessary to conduct a background investigation and <br>
evaluation of everyone, both professional and nonprofessional, who <br>
interviewed the victims about the allegations prior to and after the <br>
investigative interview(s). Investigators must be familiar with the <br>
information about ritual abuse of children being disseminated in <br>
magazines, books, television programs, videotapes, and conferences. <br>
Every possible way that a victim could have learned about the <br>
details of the abuse must be explored if for no other reason than to <br>
eliminate them and counter the defense's arguments.<br>
<br>
There may, however, be validity to these contagion factors. *They <br>
may explain some of the &quot;unbelievable&quot; aspects of the case and <br>
result in the successful prosecution of the substance of the case.* <br>
Consistency of statements becomes more significant if contagion is <br>
identified or disproved by independent investigation. The easier <br>
cases are the ones where there is a single, identifiable source of <br>
contagion. Most cases, however, seem to involve multiple contagion <br>
factors.<br>
<br>
Munchausen Syndrome and Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy are complex and <br>
controversial issues in these cases. No attempt will be made to <br>
discuss them in detail, but they are documented facts (Rosenberg, <br>
1987). Most of the literature about them focuses on their <br>
manifestation in the medical setting as false or self-inflicted <br>
illness or injury. They are also manifested in the criminal justice <br>
setting as false or self-inflicted crime victimization. If parents <br>
would poison their children to prove an illness, they might sexually <br>
abuse their children to prove a crime. &quot;Victims&quot; have been known to <br>
destroy property, manufacture evidence, and mutilate themselves in <br>
order to convince others of their victimization. The motivation is <br>
psychological gain (i.e. attention, forgiveness, etc.) and not <br>
necessarily money, jealousy, or revenge. These are the unpopular, <br>
but documented, realities of the world. Recognizing their existence <br>
does not mean that child sexual abuse and sexual assault are not <br>
real and serious problems.<br>
<br>
-- f. ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH PARENTS.<br>
<br>
The importance and difficulty of this technique in extrafamilial <br>
cases involving young children cannot be overemphasized. An <br>
investigator must maintain ongoing communication with the parents of <br>
victims in these abuse cases. Not all parents react the same way to <br>
the alleged abuse of their children. Some are very supportive and <br>
cooperative. Others overreact and some even deny the victimization. <br>
Sometimes there is animosity and mistrust among parents with <br>
different reactions. Once the parents lose faith in the police or <br>
prosecutor and begin to interrogate their own children and conduct <br>
their own investigation, the case may be lost forever. Parents from <br>
one case communicate the results of their &quot;investigation&quot; with each <br>
other, and some have even contacted the parents in other cases. Such <br>
parental activity is an obvious source of potential contamination.<br>
<br>
Parents must be made to understand that their children's credibility <br>
will be jeopardized when and if the information obtained turns out <br>
to be unsubstantiated or false. To minimize this problem, within the <br>
limits of the law and without jeopardizing investigative techniques, <br>
parents must be told on a regular basis how the case is progressing.<br>
Parents can also be assigned constructive things to do (e.g. <br>
lobbying for new legislation, working on awareness and prevention <br>
programs) in order to channel their energy, concern, and &quot;guilt&quot;.<br>
<br>
-- g. DEVELOP A CONTINGENCY PLAN.<br>
<br>
If a department waits until actually confronted with a case before a <br>
response is developed, it may be too late. In cases involving <br>
ongoing abuse of children, departments must respond quickly, and <br>
this requires advanced planning. There are added problems for small- <br>
to medium-sized departments with limited personnel and resources. <br>
Effective investigation of these cases requires planning, <br>
identification of resources, and, in many cases, mutual aid <br>
agreements between agencies. The U.S. Department of Defense has <br>
conducted specialized training and has developed such a plan for <br>
child sex ring cases involving military facilities and personnel. <br>
Once a case is contaminated and out of control, I have little advice <br>
on how to salvage what may once have been a prosecutable criminal <br>
violation. A few of these cases have even been lost on appeal after <br>
a conviction because of contamination problems.<br>
<br>
-- h. MULTIDISCIPLINARY TASK FORCES.<br>
<br>
Sergeant Beth Dickinson, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, <br>
was the chairperson of the Multi-Victim, Multi-Suspect Child Sexual <br>
Abuse Subcommittee. Sergeant Dickinson states (personal <br>
communication, Nov. 1989):<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the biggest obstacles for investigators to overcome is the <br>
reluctance of law enforcement administrators to commit sufficient <br>
resources early on to an investigation that has the potential to be <br>
a multidimensional child sex ring. It is important to get in and get <br>
on top of the investigation in a timely manner - to get it <br>
investigated in a timely manner in order to assess the risk to <br>
children and to avoid hysteria, media sensationalism, and cross-<br>
contamination of information. The team approach reduces stress on <br>
individual investigators, allowing for peer support and minimizing <br>
feelings of being overwhelmed.&quot;<br>
<br>
The team approach and working together does not mean, however, that <br>
each discipline forgets its role and starts doing the other's job.<br>
<br>
-- i. SUMMARY.<br>
<br>
The investigation of child sex rings can be difficult and time <br>
consuming. The likelihood, however, of a great deal of corroborative <br>
evidence in a multivictim/multioffender case increases the chances <br>
of a successful prosecution if the crime occurred. Because there is <br>
still so much we do not know or understand about the dynamics of <br>
multidimensional child sex rings, investigative techniques are less <br>
certain. Each new case must be carefully evaluated in order to <br>
improve investigative procedures.<br>
<br>
Because mental health professionals seem to be unable to determine, <br>
with any degree of certainty, the accuracy of victim statements in <br>
these cases, law enforcement must proceed using the corroboration <br>
process. If some of what the victim describes is accurate, some <br>
misperceived, some distorted, and some contaminated, what is the <br>
jury supposed to believe? Until mental health professionals can come <br>
up with better answers, the jury should be asked to believe what the <br>
*investigation* can corroborate. Even if only a portion of what <br>
these victims allege is factual, that may still constitute <br>
significant criminal activity. <br>
<br>
10. CONCLUSION.<br>
<br>
There are many possible alternative answers to the question of why <br>
victims are alleging things that don't seem to be true. The first <br>
step in finding those answers is to admit the possibility that some <br>
of what the victims describe may not have happened. Some experts <br>
seem unwilling to even consider this. Most of these victims are also <br>
probably not lying and have come to believe that which they are <br>
alleging actually happened. There are alternative explanations for <br>
why people who never met each other can tell the same story.<br>
<br>
I believe that there is a middle ground - a continuum of possible <br>
activity. Some of what the victims allege may be true and accurate, <br>
some may be misperceived or distorted, some may be screened or <br>
symbolic, and some may be &quot;contaminated&quot; or false. The problem and <br>
challenge, especially for law enforcement, is to determine which is <br>
which. This can only be done through active investigation. I believe <br>
that the majority of victims alleging &quot;ritual&quot; abuse are in fact <br>
victims of some form of abuse or trauma. That abuse or trauma may or <br>
may not be criminal in nature. After a lengthy discussion about <br>
various alternative explanations and the continuum of possible <br>
activity, one mother told me that for the first time since the <br>
victimization of her young son she felt a little better. She had <br>
thought her only choices were that either her son was a pathological <br>
liar or, on the other hand, she lived in a community controlled by <br>
satanists.<br>
<br>
Law enforcement has the obvious problem of attempting to determine <br>
what actually happened for criminal justice purposes. Therapists, <br>
however, might also be interested in what really happened in order <br>
to properly evaluate and treat their patients. How and when to <br>
confront patients with skepticism is a difficult and sensitive <br>
problem for therapists.<br>
<br>
Any professional evaluating victims' allegations of &quot;ritual&quot; abuse <br>
cannot ignore or routinely dismiss the lack of physical evidence (no <br>
bodies or physical evidence left by violent murders); the difficulty <br>
in successfully committing a large-scale conspiracy crime (the more <br>
people involved in any crime conspiracy, the harder it is to get <br>
away with it); and human nature (intragroup conflicts resulting in <br>
individual self-serving disclosures are likely to occur in any group <br>
involved in organized kidnapping, baby breeding, and human <br>
sacrifice). If and when members of a destructive cult commit <br>
murders, they are bound to make mistakes, leave evidence, and <br>
eventually make admissions in order to brag about their crimes or to <br>
reduce their legal liability. The discovery of the murders in <br>
Matamoros, Mexico in 1989 and the results of the subsequent <br>
investigation are good examples of these dynamics.<br>
<br>
Overzealous intervenors must accept the fact that some of their <br>
well-intentioned activity is contaminating and damaging the <br>
prosecutive potential of the cases where criminal acts did occur. We <br>
must all (i.e., the media, churches, therapists, victim advocates, <br>
law enforcement, and the general public) ask ourselves if we have <br>
created an environment where victims are rewarded, listened to, <br>
comforted, and forgiven in direct proportion to the severity of <br>
their abuse. Are we encouraging needy or traumatized individuals to <br>
tell more and more outrageous tales of their victimization? Are we <br>
making up for centuries of denial by now blindly accepting any <br>
allegation of child abuse no matter how absurd or unlikely? Are we <br>
increasing the likelihood that rebellious, antisocial, or attention-<br>
seeking individuals will gravitate toward &quot;satanism&quot; by publicizing <br>
it and overreacting to it? The overreaction to the problem can be <br>
worse than the problem.<br>
<br>
The amount of &quot;ritual&quot; child abuse going on in this country depends <br>
on how you define the term. One documented example of what I might <br>
call &quot;ritual&quot; child abuse was the horror chronicled in the book _A<br>
Death in White Bear Lake_ (Siegal, 1990). The abuse in this case, <br>
however, had little to do with anyone's spiritual belief system. <br>
There are many children in the United States who, starting early in <br>
their lives, are severely psychologically, physically, and sexually <br>
traumatized by angry, sadistic parents or other adults. Such abuse, <br>
however, is not perpetrated only or primarily by satanists. The <br>
statistical odds are that such abusers are members of mainstream <br>
religions. If 99.9% of satanists and 0.1% of Christians abuse <br>
children as part of their spiritual belief system, that still means <br>
that the vast majority of children so abused were abused by <br>
Christians.<br>
<br>
Until hard evidence is obtained and corroborated, the public should <br>
not be frightened into believing that babies are being bred and <br>
eaten, that 50,000 missing children are being murdered in human <br>
sacrifices, or that satanists are taking over America's day care <br>
centers or institutions. No one can prove with absolute certainty <br>
that such activity has *not* occurred. The burden of proof, however, <br>
as it would be in a criminal prosecution, is on those who claim that <br>
it has occurred.<br>
<br>
The explanation that the satanists are too organized and law <br>
enforcement is too incompetent only goes so far in explaining the <br>
lack of evidence. For at least eight years American law enforcement <br>
has been aggressively investigating the allegations of victims of <br>
ritual abuse. There is little or no evidence for the portion of <br>
their allegations that deals with large-scale baby breeding, human <br>
sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies. Now it is up to <br>
mental health professionals, not law enforcement, to explain why <br>
victims are alleging things that don't seem to have happened. <br>
Professionals in this field must accept the fact that there is still <br>
much we do not know about the sexual victimization of children, and <br>
that this area desperately needs study and research by rational, <br>
objective social scientists.<br>
<br>
If the guilty are to be successfully prosecuted, if the innocent are <br>
to be exonerated, and if the victims are to be protected and <br>
treated, better methods to evaluate and explain allegations of <br>
&quot;ritual&quot; child abuse must be developed or identified. Until this is <br>
done, the controversy will continue to cast a shadow over and fuel <br>
the backlash against the validity and reality of child sexual abuse. <br>

12. SUGGESTED READING.<br>
<br>
-- a. Cooper, John Charles, _The Black Mask: Satanism in America <br>
Today_. Old Tappen, N.J.: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1990.<br>
<br>
Probably the best of the large number of books available primarily <br>
in Christian bookstores and written from the Christian perspective. <br>
This one, however, is written without the hysteria and <br>
sensationalism of most. Recommended for investigators who want <br>
information from this perspective.<br>
<br>
-- b. Hicks, Robert D., _In Pursuit of Satan: The Police and the <br>
Occult_. Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1991.<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly the best book written to date on the topic of satanism <br>
and the occult from the law enforcement perspective. Robert D. Hicks <br>
is a former police officer who is currently employed as a criminal <br>
justice analyst for the state of Virginia. Must reading for any <br>
criminal justice professional involved in this issue. Unfortunately, <br>
in the chapter on &quot;Satanic Abuse of Children&quot;, the author appears to <br>
have been overly influenced by extreme skeptics with minimal or <br>
questionable credentials in this area. The book is easy to read, <br>
logical, and highly recomended.
