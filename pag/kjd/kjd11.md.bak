# A true discourse,

## Of the apprehension of sundrye

Witches lately taken in Scotland:  
wherof some are executed, and some are  
yet imprisoned.

With a particuler recitall of their examinations,  
*taken in the presence of the Kinges Maiestie*.

GOd by his omnipotent power, hath at al times and daily doth take such
care, and is so vigillant, for the weale and preseruation of his owne,
that thereby he disapointeth the wicked practises and euil intents of
all such as by any meanes whatsoeuer, seeke indirectly to conspire any
thing contrary to his holy will: yea and by the same power, he hath
lately ouerthrown and hindered the intentions and wicked dealinges of a
great number of vngodly creatures, no better then Diuels: who suffering
themselues to be allured and inticed by the Diuell whom they serued, and
to whome they were pritiatelye sworne: entered into y<sup>e</sup>
detestable Art of witch-

{p. 8}

craft, which they studied and practised so long time, that in the end
they had seduced by their sorcery a number of other to be as bad as
themselues: dwelling in the boundes of *Lowthian*, which is a principall
shire or parte of *Scotland*, where the Kings Maiestie vseth to make his
cheefest residence or abode: and to the end that their detestable
wickednes which they priuilye had pretended against the Kings Maiestie,
the Common-weale of that Country, with the Nobilitie and subiects of the
same, should come to light: God of his vnspeakeable goodnes did reueale
and lay it open in very strange sorte, therby to make knowne vnto the
worlde, that there actions were contrarye to the lawe of God, and the
naturall affection which we ought generallye to beare one to another:
the manner of the reuealing wherof was as followeth.

'Within the towne of *Trenent* in the Kingdome of *Scotland*, there
dwelleth one *Dauid Seaton*, who being deputie Bailiffe in the saide
Towne, had a maide seruant called *Geillis Duncane*, who vsed secretly
to be absent and to lye foorth of her Maisters house euery other night:
this *Geillis Duncane* took in hand to help all such as were troubled or
greeued with any kinde of sicknes or infirmitie: and in short space did
perfourme manye matters most miraculous, which thinges forasmuch as she
began to doe them vpon a sodaine, hauing neuer doon the like

{p. 9}

before, made her Maister and others to be in great admiracion, and
wondred thereat: by meanes wherof the saide *Dauid Seaton* had his maide
in some great suspition, that she did not those things by naturall and
lawfull wayes, but rather supposed it to be doone by some extraordinary
and vnlawfull meanes.

Whervpon, her Maister began to growe very inquisitiue, and examined her
which way and by what meanes she were able to perfourme matters of so
great importance: whereat she gaue him no answere, neuerthelesse, her
Maister to the intent that he might the better trye and finde out the
trueth of the same, did with the helpe of others, torment her with the
torture of the Pilliwinckes vpon her fingers, which is a greeuous
torture, and binding or wrinching her head with a corde or roape, which
is a most cruell torment also, yet would she not confesse any thing,
whereupon they suspecting that she had beene marked by the Diuell (as
commonly witches are) made dilligent search about her, and found the
enemies marke to be in her fore crag or foreparte of her throate: which
being found, she confessed that all her dooings was doone by the wicked
allurements and inticements of the Diuell, and that she did them by
witchcraft.

After this her confession, she was committed to prison, where she
continued for a season,

{p. 10}

where immediatly she accused these persons following to be notorious
witches, and caused them foorthwith to be apprehended one after an

<img src="nfs1000.jpg" width="300" height="283" />

other, vidz. *Agnis Sampson* the eldest Witch of them al, dwelling in
Haddington, *Agnes Tompson* of Edenbrough, Doctor *Fian*, alias *Iohn
Cunningham*, maister of the Schoole at Salt-

{p. 11}

pans in Lowthian, of whose life and strange actes, you shall heare more
largely in the ende of this discourse: these were by the saide *Geillis
Duncane* accused, as also *George Motts* wife dwelling in Saltpans,
*Robert Griersonn* skipper, and *Iennit Bandilandis*, with the Porters
wife of Seaton, the Smith at the brigge Hallis with innumerable others
in that partes, and dwelling in those bounds aforesaide: of whom some
are alreadye executed, the rest remaine in prison, to receiue the doome
of Iudgement at the Kings maiesties will and pleasure.

The said *Geillis Duncane* also caused *Ewphame Meealrean* to be
apprehended, who conspired and perfourmed the death of her Godfather,
and who vsed her art vpon a gentleman being one of the Lords and
Iustices of the Session, for bearing good will to her Daughter: she also
caused to be apprehended one *Barbara Naper*, for bewitching to death
*Archibalde*, last Earle of Angus, who languished to death by witchcraft
and yet the same was not suspected, but that he died of so strange a
disease, as the Phisition knew not how to cure or remedy the same: but
of all other the saide witches, these two last before recited, were
reputed for as ciuill honest women as any that dwelled within the Citie
of Edenbrough, before they were apprehended. Many other besides were
taken dwelling in

{p. 12}

Lieth, who are detayned in prison, vntill his Maiesties further will and
pleasure be known: of whose wicked dooings you shall particularly heare,
which was as followeth.

This aforeaside *Agnis Sampson* which was the elder Witch, was taken and
brought to Haliciud house before the Kings Maiestie and sundry other of
the nobility of Scotland, where she was straitly examined, but all the
perswasions which the Kings maiestie vsed to her with y<sup>e</sup> rest
of his counsell, might not prouoke or induce her to confesse any thing,
but stood stiffely in the deniall of all that was laide to her charge:
whervpon they caused her to be conueied awaye to prison, there to
receiue such torture as hath been lately prouided for witches in that
country: and forasmuch as by due examination of witchcraft and witches
in Scotland, it hath latelye beene found that the Deuill dooth
generallye marke them with a priuie marke, by reason the Witches haue
confessed themselues, that the Diuell dooth lick them with his tung in
some priuy part of their bodie, before hee dooth receiue them to be his
seruants, which marke commonly is giuen them vnder the haire in some
part of their bodye, wherby it may not easily be found out or seene,
although they be searched: and generally so long as the marke is not
seene to those which search them, so long the parties that hath the

{p. 13}

marke will neuer confesse any thing. Therfore by special commaundement
this *Agnis Sampson* had all her haire shauen of, in each parte of her
bodie, and her head thrawen with a rope according to the custome of that
Countrye, beeing a paine most greeuous, which she continued almost an
hower, during which time she would not confesse any thing vntill the
Diuels marke was found vpon her priuities, then she immediatlye
confessed whatsoeuer was demaunded of her, and iustifying those persons
aforesaid to be notorious witches.

Item, the saide *Agnis Tompson* was after brought againe before the
Kings Maiestie and his Counsell, and being examined of the meetings and
detestable dealings of those witches, she confessed that vpon the night
of *Allhollon* Euen last, she was accompanied aswell with the persons
aforesaide, as also with a great many other witches, to the number of
two hundreth: and that all they together went by Sea each one in a
Riddle or Ciue, {sieve?--*jbh*} and went in the same very substantially
with Flaggons of wine making merrie and drinking by the waye in the same
Riddles or Ciues, to the Kerke of North Barrick in Lowthian, and that
after they had landed, tooke handes on the land and daunced this reill
or short daunce, singing all with one voice.

{p. 14}

Commer goe ye before, commer goe ye,  
Gif ye will not goe before, commer let me.

At which time she confessed, that this *Geilles Duncane* did goe before
them playing this reill or daunce vpon a small Trump, called a Iewes
Trump, vntill they entred into the Kerk of north Barrick.

These confessions made the King in a woderful admiration and sent for
y<sup>e</sup> said *GeillisDuncane*, who vpon the like Trump did playe
the said daunce before the Kings Maiestie, who in respect of the
strangenes of these matters, tooke great delight to bee present at their
examinations.

Item, the said *Agnis Tompson* confessed that the Diuell being then at
North Barrick Kerke attending their comming in the habit or likenes of a
man, and seeing that they tarried ouer long, he at their comming
enioyned them all to a pennance, which was, that they should kisse his
Buttockes, in signe of duetye to him: which being put ouer the Pulpit
barre, euerye one did as he had enioyned them: and hauing made his
vngodly exhortations, wherein he did greatlye enveighe against the King
of Scotland, he receiued their oathes for their good and true seruice
towards him, and departed: which doone, they returned to Sea, and so
home againe.

{p. 15}

At which time the witches demaunded of the Diuel why he did beare such
hatred to the King, who answered, by reason the King is the greatest
enemy he hath in the worlde: all which their onfessions and depositions
are still extant vpon record.

Item, the saide *Agnis Sampson* confessed before the Kings Maiestie
sundrye thinges which were so miraculous and strange, as that his
Maiestie saide they were all extreame lyars, wherat she answered, she
would not wishe his Maiestie to suppose her woords to be false, but
rather to beleeue them, in that she would discouer such matter vnto him
as his maiestie should not any way doubt off.

And therupon taking his Maiestie a little aside, she declared vnto him
the verye woordes which passed betweene the Kings Maiestie and his
Queene at Vpslo in Norway the first night of their mariage, with their
answere eache to other: whereat the Kinges Maiestie wondered greatlye,
and swore by the liuing God, that he beleeued that all the Diuels in
hell could not haue discouered the same: acknowledging her woords to be
most true, and therefore gaue the more credit to the rest which is
before declared.

Touching this *Agnis Tompson*, she is the onlye woman, who by the Diuels
perswasion should haue entended and put in execution the

{p. 16}

Kings Maiesties death in this manner.

She confessed that she tooke a blacke Toade, and did hang the same vp by
the heeles, three daies, and collected and gathered the venome as it
dropped and fell from it in an Oister shell, and kept the same venome
close couered, vntill she should obtaine any parte or peece of foule
linnen cloth, that had appertained to the Kings Maiestie, as shirt,
handkercher, napkin or any other thing which she practised to obtaine by
meanes of one *Iohn Kers*, who being attendant in his Maiesties Chamber,
desired him for olde acquaintance betweene them, to helpe her to one or
a peece of such a cloth as is aforesaide, which thing the said *Iohn
Kers* denyed to helpe her too, saying he could not help her too it.

And the said *Agnis Tompson* by her depositions since her apprehension
saith, that if she had obtained any one peece of linnen cloth which the
King had worne and fouled, she had bewitched him to death, and put him
to such extraordinary paines, as if he had beene lying vpon sharp
thornes and endes of Needles.

Moreouer she confessed that at the time when his Maiestie was in
Denmarke, she being accompanied with the parties before specially named,
tooke a Cat and christened it, and afterward bound to each parte of that
Cat, the cheefest partes of a dead man, and seuerall ioynts of

{p. 17}

his bodie, and that in the night following the saide Cat was conueied
into the midst of the sea by all these witches sayling in their riddles
or Cities as is aforesaide, and so left the saide Cat right before the
Towne of Lieth in Scotland: this doone, there did arise such a tempest
in the Sea, as a greater hath not beene scene: which tempest was the
cause of the perrishing of a Boate or vessell comming ouer from the
towne of Brunt Iland to the towne of Lieth, wherein was sundrye Iewelles
and riche giftes, which should haue been presented to the now Queen of
Scotland, at her Maiesties comming to Lieth.

Againe it is confessed, that the said christened Cat was the cause that
the Kinges Maiesties Ship at his comming foorth of Denmarke, had a
contrary winde to the rest of his Ships, then being in his companye,
which thing was most strange and true, as the Kings Maiestie
acknowledgeth, for when the rest of the Shippes had a faire and good
winde, then was the winde contrarye and altogither against his Maiestie:
and further the saide witche declared, that his Maiestie had neuer come
safelye from the Sea, if his faith had not preuailed aboue their
ententions.

Moreouer the said Witches being demaun-

{p. 18}

ded how the Dwell would vse them when he was in their company, they
confessed that when the Diuell did receiue them for his seruants, and
that they had vowed themselues vnto him, then he would Carnallye vse
them, albeit to their little pleasure, in respect of his colde nature:
and would doo the like at sundry other times.

As touching the aforesaide Doctor *Fian*, *alias Iohn Cunningham*, the
examination of his actes since his apprehension, declareth the great
subtiltye of the diuell, and therfore maketh thinges to appeere the more
miraculous: for being apprehended by the accusation of the saide
*Geillis Duncane* aforesaide, who confessed he was their Regester, and
that there was not one man suffered to come to the Diuels readinges but
onlye he: the saide Doctor was taken and imprisoned, and vsed with the
accustomed paine, prouided for those offences, inflicted vpon the rest
as is aforesaide.

First by thrawing of his head with a roape, wherat he would confesse
nothing.

Secondly, he was perswaded by faire means to confesse his follies, but
that would preuaile as little.

Lastly he was put to the most seuere and cruell paine in the world,
called the bootes, who af-

{p. 19}

ter he had receiued three strokes, being enquired if he would confesse
his damnable acts and wicked life, his tung would not serue him to
speak, in respect wherof the rest of the witches willed to search his
tung, vnder which was found two pinnes thrust vp into the head,
whereupon the VVitches did laye, *Now is the Charme stinted*, and shewed
that those charmed Pinnes were the cause he could not confesse any
thing: then was he immediatly released of the bootes, brought before the
King, his confession was taken, and his owne hand willingly set
ther-vnto, which contained as followeth.

First, that at the generall meetinges of those witches, hee was alwayes
preasent: that he was Clarke to all those that were in subiection to the
Diuels seruice, bearing the name of witches, that alwaye he did take
their othes for their true seruice to the Diuell, and that he wrot for
them such matters as the Diuell still pleased to commaund him.

Item, he confessed that by his witchcrafte he did bewitch a Gentleman
dwelling neere to the Saltpans, where the said Doctor kept Schoole,
onely for being enamoured of a Gentlewoman whome he loued himselfe: by
meanes of which

{p. 20}

his Sorcerye, witchcraft and diuelish practises, he caused the said
Gentleman that once in xxiiij. howres he fell into a lunacie and madnes,
and so

<img src="nfs2000.jpg" width="300" height="228" />

cotinued one whole hower together, and for the veritie of the same, he
caused the Gentleman to be brought before the Kinges Maiestie, which was
vpon the xxiiij. day of December last, and being

{p. 21}

in his Maiesties Chamber, suddenly he gaue a great scritch and fell into
a madnes, sometime bending himselfe, and sometime capring so directly
vp, that his head did touch the seeling of the Chamber, to the great
admiration of his Maiestie and others then present: so that all the
Gentlemen in the Chamber were not able to holde him, vntill they called
in more helpe, who together bound him hand and foot: and suffering the
said gentleman to lye still vntill his furye were past, he within an
hower came againe to himselfe, when being demaunded of the Kings
Maiestie what he saw or did all that while, answered that he had been in
a sound sleepe.

Item the said Doctor did also confesse that he had vsed means sundry
times to obtain his purpose and wicked intent of the same Gentlewoman,
and seeing himselfe disapointed of his intention, he determined by all
waies he might to obtaine the same, trusting by coniuring, witchcraft
and Sorcery to obtaine it in this manner.

It happened this gentlewoman being vnmaried, had a brother who went to
schoole with the said Doctor, and calling his Scholler to him, demaunded
if he did lye with his sister, who answered he did, by meanes wherof he
thought to obtaine his purpose, and therefore secretlye promised to
teach him w<sup>t</sup>out stripes, so he would obtain for him three
haires of his sisters priuities.

{p. 22}

at such time as he should spye best occasion for it: which the youth
promised faithfullye to perfourme, and vowed speedily to put it in
practise, taking a peece of coniured paper of his maister to lappe them
in when he had gotten them: and therevpon the boye practised nightlye to
obtaine his maisters purpose, especially when his sister was a sleepe.

But God who knoweth the secrets of all harts, and reuealeth all wicked
and vngodlye practises, would not suffer the intents of this diuilish
Doctor to come to that purpose which he supposed it would, and therefore
to declare that he was heauilye offended with his wicked entent, did so
woorke by the Gentlewomans owne meanes, that in the ende the same was
discouered and brought to light: for she being one night a sleepe, and
her brother in bed with her, suddenlye cryed out to her mother,
declaring that her Brother would not suffer her to sleepe, wherevpon her
mother hauing a quick capacitie, did vehemently suspect Doctor *Fians*
entention, by reason she was a witche of her selfe, and therefore
presently arose, and was very inquisitiue of the boy to vnderstand his
intent, and the better to know y<sup>e</sup> same, did beat him with
sundry stripes, wherby he discouered the trueth vnto her.

{p. 23}

The Mother therefore being well practised in witchcrafte, did thinke it
most conuenient to meete with the Doctor in his owne Arte, and therevpon
tooke the paper from the boy, wherein hee should haue put the same
haires, and went to a young Heyfer which neuer had borne Calfe nor gone
to the Bull, and with a paire of sheeres, clipped off three haires from
the vdder of the Cow, and wrapt them in the same paper, which she againe
deliuered to the boy, then willing him to giue the same to his saide
Maister, which he immediatly did.

The Schoolemaister so soone as he had receiued them, thinking them
indeede to bee the Maides haires, went straight and wrought his arte
vpon them: But the Doctor had no sooner doone his intent to them, but
presentlye the Hayfer or Cow whose haires they were indeed, came vnto
the doore of the Church wherein the Schoolemaister was, into the which
the Hayfer went, and made towards the Schoolemaister, leaping and
dauncing vpon him, and following him foorth of the church and to what
place so euer he went, to the great admiration of all the townes men of
Saltpans, and many other who did beholde the same.

The reporte whereof made all men imagine

{p. 24}

that hee did woorke it by the Dwell, without whom it could neuer haue
beene so sufficientlye effected: and thervpon, the name of the said
Doctor *Fien* (who was but a very yong man) began to grow so common
among the people of Scotland, that he was secretlye nominated for a
notable Cuniurer.

<img src="nfs2400.jpg" width="300" height="298" />

{p. 25}

All which although in the beginning he denied, and would not confesse,
yet hauing felt the pain of the bootes (and the charme stinted, as
aforesayd) be confessed all the aforesaid to be most true, without
producing anie witnesses to iustifie the same, & thervpon before the
kings maiesty he subscribed the sayd confessions with his owne hande,
which for truth remaineth vpon record in *Scotland*.

After that the depositions and examinations of the sayd doctor *Fian
Alias Cuningham* was taken, as alreadie is declared, with his owne hand
willingly set therevnto, hee was by the master of the prison committed
to ward, and appointed to a chamber by himselfe, where forsaking his
wicked wayes, acknowledging his most vngodly lyfe, shewing that he had
too much folowed the allurements and entisements of sathan, and fondly
practised his conclusions by coniuring, witchcraft, inchantment,
sorcerie, and such like, hee renounced the deuill and all his wicked
workes, vowed to leade the life of a Christian, and seemed newly
connected towards God.

The morrow after vpon conference had with him, he granted that the
deuill had appeared vnto him in the night before, appareled all in
blacke, with a white wand in his hande, and that the deuill demaunded of
him if hee would continue his faithfull seruice, according to his first
oath and promise made to that effect. Whome (as hee then

{p. 26}

sayd) he vtterly renounced to his face, and sayde vnto him in this
manner, *Auoide Satan, auoide*, for I haue listned too much vnto thee,
and by the same thou hast vndone mee, in respect whereof I vtterly
forsake thee. To whome the deuill answered, *That once ere thou die thou
shalt bee mine*. And with that (as he sayde) the deuill brake the white
wande, and immediatly vanished foorth of his sight.

Thus all the daie this Doctor *Fian* continued verie solitarie, and
seemed to haue care of his owne soule, and would call vppon God, shewing
himselfe penitent for his wicked life, neuerthelesse the same night hee
founde such meanes, that hee stole the key of the prison doore and
chamber in the which he was, which in the night hee opened and fled
awaie to the Salt pans, where hee was alwayes resident, and first
apprehended. Of whose sodaine departure when the Kings maiestie had
intelligence, hee presently commanded diligent inquirie to bee made for
his apprehension, and for the better effecting thereof, hee sent publike
proclamations into all partes of his lande to the same effect. By meanes
of whose hot and harde pursuite, he was agayn taken and brought to
prison, and then being called before the kings highnes, hee was
reexamined as well touching his departure, as also touching all that had
before happened.

{p. 27}

But this Doctor, notwithstanding that his owne confession appeareth
remaining in recorde vnder his owne hande writing, and the same
therevnto fixed in the presence of the Kings maiestie and sundrie of his
Councell, yet did hee vtterly denie the same.

Wherevpon the kinges maiestie perceiuing his stubbourne wilfulnesse,
conceiued and imagined that in the time of his absence hee had entered
into newe conference and league with the deuill his master, and that hee
had beene agayne newly marked, for the which hee was narrowly searched,
but it coulde not in anie wise bee founde, yet for more tryall of him to
make him confesse, hee was commaunded to haue a most straunge torment
which was done in this manner following.

His nailes vpon all his fingers were riuen and pulled off with an
instrument called in Scottish a *Turkas*, which in England wee call a
payre of pincers, and vnder euerie nayle there was thrust in two needels
ouer euen up to the heads. At all which tormentes notwithstanding the
Doctor neuer shronke anie whit, neither woulde he then confesse it the
sooner for all the tortures inflicted vpon him.

Then was hee with all conuenient speed, by commandement, conuaied againe
to the torment

{p. 28}

of the bootes, wherein hee continued a long time, and did abide so many
blowes in them, that his legges were crushte and beaten togeather as
small as might bee, and the bones and flesh so brused, that the bloud
and marrowe spouted forth in great abundance, whereby they were made
unseruiceable for euer. And notwithstanding al these grieuous paines and
cruell torments hee would not confesse anie thing, so deepely had the
deuill entered into his heart, that hee vtterly denied all that which he
had before auouched, and woulde saie nothing therevnto but this, that
what hee had done and sayde before, was onely done and sayde for feare
of paynes which he had endured.

Upon great consideration therefore taken by the Kings maiestie and his
Councell, as well for the due execution of iustice vppon such detestable
malefactors, as also for example sake, to remayne a terrour to all
others heereafter, that shall attempt to deale in the lyke wicked and
vngodlye actions, as witchcraft, sorcery, cuniuration, &such lyke, the
sayde Doctor *Fian* was soone after araigned, condemned, and adiudged by
the law to die, and then to bee burned according to the lawe of that
lande, prouided in that behalfe. Wherevpon hee was put into a carte, and
beeing first strangled, hee was immediatly put into a great fire, being
readie prouided for that purpose, and there

{p. 29}

burned in the Castle hill of *Edenbrough* on a saterdaie in the ende of
Ianuarie last past. 1591.

The rest of the witches which are not yet executed, remayne in prison
till farther triall, and knowledge of his maiesties pleasure.

This strange discourse before recited, may perhaps giue some occasion of
doubt to such as shall happen to reade the same, and thereby coniecture
that the Kings maiestie would not hazarde himselfe in the presence of
such notorious witches, least therby might haue insued great danger to
his person and the generall state of the land, which thing in truth
might wel haue bene feared. But to answer generally to such, let this
suffice: that first it is well knowen that the King is the child &
seruant of God, and they but seruants to the deuil, hee is the Lords
annointed, and they but vesselles of Gods wrath: he is a true Christian,
and trusteth in God, they worse than Infidels, for they onely trust in
the deuill, who daily serue them, till he haue brought them to vtter
destruction. But heereby it seemeth that his Highnesse caried a
magnanimious and vndanted mind, not feared with their inchantmentes, but
resolute in this, that so long as God is with him, hee feareth not who
is against him. And trulie the whole scope of this treatise dooth so
plainely laie open the wonderfull prouidence of the Almightie, that if
he had not bene defended by his omnipotencie and power, his Highnes had
neuer returned aliue in his voiage fro<sup>\~</sup> Denmarke, so that
there is no doubt but God woulde as well defend him on the land as on
the sea, where they pretended their damnable practise.

FINIS.
