# To the Reader.

THE MANIFOLDE vntruthes which is spread abroade, concerning the
detestable actions and apprehension of those Witches wherof this
Historye following truely entreateth, hath caused me to publish the same
in print: and the rather for that sundrie written Copies are lately
dispersed therof, co<sup>\~</sup>taining, that the said witches were
first discouered, by meanes of a poore Pedler trauailing to the towne of
Trenent*, and that by a wonderfull manner he was in a moment conuayed at
midnight, from* Scotland *to* Burdeux *in* Fraunce *(beeing places of no
small distance between) into a Marchants Seller there, & after, being
sent from* Burdeux *into* Scotland

by certaine Scottish Marchants to the Kinges Maiestie, that he
discouered those Witches and was the cause of their apprehension: with a
number of matters miracu / lous and incredible: All which in truthe are
moste false. Neuertheles to satisfie a number of honest mindes, who are
desirous to be enformed of the veritie and trueth of their confessions,
which for certaintie is more stranger then the common reporte runneth,
and yet with more trueth I haue

{p. 6}

vndertaken to publish this short Treatise, which declareth the true
discourse of all that hath hapned, & aswell what was pretended b those
wicked and detestable Witches against the Kinges Maiestie, as also by
what meanes they wrought the same.

All which examinations (gentle Reader) I haue heere truelye published,
as they were taken and vttered in the presence of the Kings Maiestie,
praying thee to accept it for veritie, the same beeing so true as cannot
be reproued.
