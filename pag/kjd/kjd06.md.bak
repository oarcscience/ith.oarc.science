# THE THIRDE BOOKE

## OF Dæmonologie

ARGVMENT.

The description of all these kindes of Spirites that troubles men or
women. The conclusion of the whole Dialogue.

## CHAP. I. ARGV.

The diuision of spirites in foure principall kindes. The description of
the first kinde of them, called Spectra *&* vmbræ mortuorum*. What is
the best way to be free of their trouble*.

PHILOMATHES.

I Pray you now then go forward in telling what ye thinke fabulous, or
may be trowed in that case.

EPI. That kinde of the Deuils conuersing in the earth, may be diuided in
foure different kindes, whereby he affrayeth and troubleth the bodies of
men: For of the abusing of the soule,

{p. 57}

I haue spoken alreadie. The first is, where spirites troubles some
houses or solitarie places: The second, where spirites followes vpon
certaine persones, and at diuers houres troubles them: The thirde, when
they enter within them and possesse them: The fourth is these kinde of
spirites that are called vulgarlie the Fayrie. Of the three former
kindes, ye harde alreadie, how they may artificiallie be made by
Witch-craft to trouble folke: Now it restes to speake of their naturall
comming as it were, and not raysed by Witch-craft. But generally I must
for-warne you of one thing before I enter in this purpose: that is, that
although in my discourseing of them, I deuyde them in diuers kindes, yee
must notwithstanding there of note my Phrase of speaking in that: For
doubtleslie they are in effect, but all one kinde of spirites, who for
abusing the more of mankinde. takes on these sundrie shapes, and vses
diuerse formes of out-ward actiones, as if some were of nature better
then other. Nowe I returne to my purpose: As to the first kinde of these
spirites, that were called by the auncients by diuers names, according
as their actions were. For if they were spirites that haunted some
houses, by appearing in diuers and horrible formes, and making greate
dinne: they were called *Lemures* or *Spectra*. If they appeared in
likenesse of anie defunct to some friends of his, they wer called *vmbræ
mortuorum*: And so innumerable stiles they got, according to their
actiones, as I haue said alreadie. As we see by experience, how manie
stiles they haue gi-

{p. 58}

ven them in our language in the like maner: Of the appearing of these
spirites, wee are certified by the Scriptures, where the Prophet ESAY
13. and 34. cap. threatning the destruction of *Babell* and *Edom*:\[1\]
declares, that it shal not onlie be wracked, but shall become so greate
a solitude, as it shall be the habitackle of Howlettes, and of ZIIM and
IIM, which are the proper Hebrewe names for these Spirites. The cause
whie they haunte solitarie places, it is by reason, that they may
affraie and brangle the more the faith of suche as them alone hauntes
such places. For our nature is such, as in companies wee are not so
soone mooued to anie such kinde of feare, as being solitare, which the
Deuill knowing well inough, hee will not therefore assaile vs but when
we are weake: And besides that, G O D will not permit him so to
dishonour the societies and companies of Christians, as in publicke
times and places to walke visiblie amongst them. On the other parte,
when he troubles certaine houses that are dwelt in, it is a sure token
either of grosse ignorance, or of some grosse and slanderous sinnes
amongst the inhabitantes thereof: which God by that extraordinarie rod
punishes.

PHI. But by what way or passage can these Spirites enter in these
houses, seeing they alledge that they will enter, Doore and Window being
steiked?

EPI. They will choose the passage for their entresse, according to the
forme that they are in at

\[1. *Esay*. 13 *Iere*. 50\]

{p. 59}

that time. For if they haue assumed a deade bodie, whereinto they lodge
themselues, they can easely inough open without dinne anie Doore or
Window, and enter in thereat. And if they enter as a spirite onelie,
anie place where the aire may come in at, is large inough an entrie for
them: For as I said before, a spirite can occupie no quantitie.

PHI. And will God then permit these wicked spirites to trouble the reste
of a dead bodie, before the resurrection thereof? Or if he will so, I
thinke it should be of the reprobate onely.

EPI. What more is the reste troubled of a dead bodie, when the Deuill
carryes it out of the Graue to serue his turne for a space, nor when the
Witches takes it vp and joyntes it, or when as Swine wortes vppe the
graues? The rest of them that the Scripture speakes of, is not meaned by
a locall remaining continuallie in one place, but by their resting from
their trauelles and miseries of this worlde, while their latter
conjunction againe with the soule at that time to receaue full glorie in
both. And that the Deuill may vse aswell the ministrie of the bodies of
the faithfull in these cases, as of the vn-faithfull, there is no
inconvenient; for his haunting with their bodies after they are deade,
can no-waies defyle them: In respect of the soules absence. And for anie
dishonour it can be vnto them, by what reason can it be greater, then
the hanging, heading, or many such shameful deaths, that good men will
suffer?

{p. 60}

for there is nothing in the bodies of the faithfull, more worthie of
honour, or freer from corruption by nature, nor in these of the
vnfaithful, while time they be purged and glorified in the latter daie,
as is dailie seene by the vilde diseases and corruptions, that the
bodies of the faythfull are subject vnto, as yee will see clearelie
proued, when I speake of the possessed and Dæmoniacques.

PHI. Yet there are sundrie that affirmes to haue haunted such places,
where these spirites are alleaged to be: And coulde neuer heare nor see
anie thing.

EPI. I thinke well: For that is onelie reserued to the secreete
knowledge of God, whom he wil permit to see such thinges, and whome not.

PHI. But where these spirites hauntes and troubles anie houses, what is
the best waie to banishe them?

EPI. By two meanes may onelie the remeid of such things be procured: The
one is ardent prayer to God, both of these persones that are troubled
with them, and of that Church whereof they are. The other is the purging
of themselues by amende ment of life from such sinnes. as haue procured
that extraordinarie plague.

PHI. And what meanes then these kindes of spirites, when they appeare in
the shaddow of a person newlie dead, or to die, to his friendes?

EPI. When they appeare vpon that occasion, they are called Wraithes in
our language. Amongst the *Gentiles* the Deuill vsed that much, to make

{p. 61}

them beleeue that it was some good spirite that appeared to them then,
ether to forewarne them of the death of their friend; or else to
discouer vnto them, the will of the defunct, or what was the way of his
slauchter, as is written in the booke of the histories Prodigious. And
this way hee easelie decciued the *Gentiles*, because they knew not God:
And to that same effect is it, that he now appeares in that maner to
some ignorant Christians. For he dare not so illude anie that knoweth
that, neither can the spirite of the defunct returne to his friend, or
yet an Angell vse such formes.

PHI. And are not our war-woolfes one sorte of these spirits also, that
hauntes and troubles some houses or dwelling places?

EPI. There bath indeede bene an old opinion of such like thinges; For by
the *Greekes* they were called {Greek *lukanðrwpoi*} which signifieth
men-woolfes. But to tell you simplie my opinion in this, if anie such
thing hath bene, I take it to haue proceeded but of a naturall
super-abundance of Melancholie, which as wee reade, that it hath made
some thinke themselues Pitchers, and some horses, and some one kinde of
beast or other: So suppose I that it hath so viciat the imagination and
memorie of some, as *per lucida interualla*, it hath so highlie occupyed
them, that they haue thought themselues verrie Woolfes indeede at these
times: and so haue counterfeited their actiones in goeing on their
handes and feete, preassing to deuoure women and barnes, fighting and
snatching with all the towne

{p. 62}

dogges, and in vsing such like other bruitish actiones, and so to become
beastes by a strong apprehension, as *Nebucad-netzar* was seuen
yeares:\[1\] but as to their hauing and hyding of their hard & schellie
sloughes, I take that to be but eiked, by vncertaine report, the author
of all lyes.

### CHAP. II. ARGV.

The description of the next two kindes of Spirites, whereof the one
followes outwardlie, the other possesses inwardlie the persones that
they trouble. That since all Prophecies and visiones are nowe ceased,
all spirites that appeares in these formes are euill.

PHILOMATHES.

COme forward now to the reste of these kindes of spirites.

EPI. As to the next two kindes. that is, either these that outwardlie
troubles and followes some persones, or else inwardlie possesses them: I
will conjoyne them in one, because aswel the causes ar alike in the
persons that they are permitted to trouble: as also the waies whereby
they may be remedied and cured.

PHI. What kinde of persones are they that vses to be so troubled?

EPI. Two kindes in speciall: Either such as being guiltie of greeuous
offences, God punishes

\[1. Dan. 4.\]

{p. 63}

by that horrible kinde of scourdge, or else being persones of the beste
nature peraduenture, that yee shall finde in all the Countrie about
them, G O D permittes them to be troubled in that sort, for the tryall
of their patience, and wakening vp of their zeale, for admonishing of
the beholders, not to truste ouer much in themselues, since they are
made of no better stuffe, and peraduenture blotted with no smaller
sinnes (as CHRIST saide, speaking of them vppon whome the Towre in
*Siloam* fell:)\[1\] And for giuing likewise to the spectatators, matter
to prayse G O D, that they meriting no better, are yet spared from being
corrected in that fearefull forme.

PHI. These are good reasones for the parte of G O D, which apparantlie
mooues him so to permit the Deuill to trouble such persones. But since
the Deuil hath euer a contrarie respecte in all the actiones that G O D
employes him in: which is I pray you the end and mark he shoots at in
this turne?

EPI. It is to obtaine one of two thinges thereby, if he may: The one is
the tinsell of their life, by inducing them to such perrilous places at
such time as he either followes or possesses them, which may procure the
same: And such like, so farre as G O D will permit him, by tormenting
them to weaken their bodie, and caste them in incurable diseases. The
other thinge that hee preases to obteine by troubling of them, is the
tinsell of their Soule, by intising them to mistruste

\[1. *Luc*. 13.\]

{p. 64}

and blaspheme God: Either for the intollerablenesse of their tormentes,
as he assayed to haue done with IOB;\[1\] or else for his promising vnto
them to leaue the troubling of them, incase they would so do, as is
knowen by experience at this same time by the confession of a young one
that was so troubled.

PHI. Since ye haue spoken now of both these kindes of spirites
comprehending them in one: I must nowe goe backe againe in speering some
questions of euerie one of these kindes in speciall. And first for these
that followes certaine persones, yee know that there are two sortes of
them: One sorte that troubles and tormentes the persones that they haunt
with: An other sort that are seruiceable vnto them in all kinde of their
necessaries, and omittes neuer to forwarne them of anie suddaine perrell
that they are to be in. And so in this case, I would vnderstande whither
both these sortes be but wicked and damned spirites: Or if the last
sorte be rather Angells, (as should appeare by their actiones) sent by
God to assist such as he speciallie fauoures. For it is written in the
Scriptures, that *God sendes Legions of Angells to guarde and watch ouer
his elect*.\[2\]

EPI. I know well inough where fra that errour which ye alleage hath
proceeded: For it was the ignorant *Gentiles* that were the fountaine
thereof. Who for that they knew not God, they forged in their owne
imaginationes, euery man to be still accompanied with two spirites,
whereof they called

\[1. *Iob*. x.

2\. *Gen*. 32. 1. *Kin*. 6 *Psal*. 34.\]

{p. 65}

the one *genius bonus*, the other *genius malus*: the Greekes called
them {Greek *endaimona*} & {Greek *kakodaimona*}: wherof the former they
saide, perswaded him to all the good he did: the other entised him to
all the euill. But praised be God we that are christians, & walks not
amongst the *Cymmerian* conjectures of man, knowes well inough, that it
is the good spirite of God onely, who is the fountain of all goodnes,
that perswads vs to the thinking or doing of any good: and that it is
our corrupted fleshe and Sathan, that intiseth vs to the contrarie. And
yet the Deuill for confirming in the heades of ignoraunt Christians,
that errour first mainteined among the Gentiles, he whiles among the
first kinde of spirits that I speak of, appeared in time of *Papistrie*
and blindnesse, and haunted diuers houses, without doing any euill, but
doing as it were necessarie turnes vp and down the house: and this
spirit they called *Brownie* in our language, who appeared like a
rough-man: yea, some were so blinded, as to beleeue that their house was
all the sonsier, as they called it, that such spirites resorted there.

PHI. But since the Deuils intention in all his actions. is euer to do
euill,, what euill was there in that forme of doing, since their actions
outwardly were good.

EPI Was it not euill inough to deceiue simple ignorantes, in making them
to take him for an Angell of light, and so to account of Gods enemie, as
of their particular friend: where by the contrarie, all we that are
Christians, ought assuredly to know

{p. 66}

that since the comming of Christ in the flesh, and establishing of his
Church by the Apostles, all miracles, visions, prophecies, & appearances
of Angels or good spirites are ceased. Which serued onely for the first
sowing of faith, & planting of the Church. Where now the Church being
established, and the white Horse whereof I spake before, hauing made his
conqueste, the Lawe and Prophets are thought sufficient to serue vs, or
make vs inexcusable, as Christ saith in his parable of *Lazarus* and the
riche man.\[1\]

### CHAP. III. ARGV.

The description of a particular sort of that kind of following spirites,
called Incubi *and* Succubi*: And what is the reason wherefore these
kindes of spirites hauntes most the Northerne and barbarous partes of
the world*.

PHILOMATHES.

THE next question that I would speere, is likewise concerning this first
of these two kindes of spirites that ye haue conjoyned: and it is this;
ye knowe how it is commonly written and reported, that amongst the rest
of the sortes of spirites that followes certaine persons, there is one
more monstrous nor al the rest: in respect as it is alleaged, they
converse naturally with them whom they trouble and hauntes with: and
therefore I would knowe in two thinges your opinion herein: First if
suche a thing can be: and next if it be: whether there be a difference
of sexes amongst these spirites or not.

EPI. That abhominable kinde of the Deuils

\[1. *Luk*. 16.\]

{p. 67}

abusing of men or women, was called of old, *Incubi* and *Succubi*,
according to the difference of the sexes that they conuersed with. By
two meanes this great kinde of abuse might possibly be performed: The
one, when the Deuill onelie as a spirite, and stealing out the sperme of
a dead bodie, abuses them that way, they not graithlie seeing anie shape
or feeling anie thing, but that which he so conuayes in that part: As we
reade of a Monasterie of Nunnes which were burnt for their being that
way abused. The other meane is when he borrowes a dead bodie and so
visiblie, and as it seemes vnto them naturallie as a man converses with
them. But it is to be noted, that in whatsoeuer way he vseth it, that
sperme seemes intollerably cold to the person abused. For if he steale
out the nature of a quick person, it cannot be so quicklie carryed, but
it will both tine the strength and heate by the way, which it could
neuer haue had for lacke of agitation, which in the time of procreation
is the procurer & wakener vp of these two natural qualities. And if he
occupying the dead bodie as his lodging expell the same out thereof in
the dewe time, it must likewise be colde by the participation with the
qualities of the dead bodie whereout of it comes. And whereas yee
inquire if these spirites be diuided in sexes or not, I thinke the rules
of Philosophie may easelie resolue a man of the contrarie: For it is a
sure principle of that arte, that nothing can be diuided in sexes,
except such liuing bodies as must haue a naturall seede to ge-

{p. 68}

nere by. But we know spirites hath no seede proper to themselues, nor
yet can they gender one with an other.

PHI. How is it then that they say sundrie monsters haue bene gotten by
that way.

EPI. These tales are nothing but *Aniles fabulæ*. For that they haue no
nature of their owne, I haue shewed you alreadie. And that the cold
nature of a dead bodie, can woorke nothing in generation, it is more nor
plaine, as being already dead of it selfe as well as the rest of the
bodie is, wanting the naturall heate, and such other naturall operation,
as is necessarie for woorking that effect, and incase such a thing were
possible (which were all utterly against all the rules of nature) it
would bread no monster, but onely such a naturall of-spring, as would
haue cummed betuixt that man or woman and that other abused person,
in-case they both being aliue had had a doe with other. For the Deuilles
parte therein, is but the naked carrying or expelling of that substance:
And so it coulde not participate with no qualitie of the same. Indeede,
it is possible to the craft of the Deuill to make a womans bellie to
swel after he hath that way abused her, which he may do, either by
steiring vp her own humor, or by herbes, as we see beggars daily doe.
And when the time of her deliuery should come to make her thoil great
doloures, like vnto that naturall course, and then subtillie to slippe
in the Mid-wiues handes, stockes, stones, or some monstruous barne
brought from some other place, but this is more reported

{p. 69}

and gessed at by others, nor beleeued by me.

PHI. But what is the cause that this kinde of abuse is thought to be
most common in such wild partes of the worlde, as *Lap-land*, and
*Fin-land*, or in our North Iles of *Orknay* and *Schet-land*.

EPI. Because where the Deuill findes greatest ignorance and barbaritie,
there assayles he grosseliest, as I gaue you the reason wherefore there
was moe Witches of women kinde nor men.

PHI. Can anie be so vnhappie as to giue their willing consent to the
Deuilles vilde abusing them in this forme.

EPI. Yea, some of the Witches haue confessed, that he hath perswaded
them to giue their willing consent thereunto, that he may thereby haue
them feltred the sikarer in his snares; But as the other compelled sorte
is to be pittied and prayed for, so is this most highlie to be punished
and detested.

PHI. It is not the thing which we cal the *Mare*, which takes folkes
sleeping in their bedds, a kinde of these spirites, whereof ye are
speaking?

EPI. No, that is but a naturall sicknes, which the Mediciners hath giuen
that name of *Incubus* vnto *ab incubando*, because it being a thicke
fleume, falling into our breast vpon the harte, while we are sleeping,
intercludes so our vitall spirites, and takes all power from vs, as maks
vs think that there were some vnnaturall burden or spirite, lying vpon
vs and holding vs downe.

{p. 70}

### CHAP. IIII. ARGV.

The description of the Dæmoniackes

&possessed. By what reason the Papistes may haue power to cure them.

PHILOMATHES.

WEL, I haue told you now all my doubts, and ye haue satisfied me
therein, concerning the first of these two kindes of spirites that ye
haue conjoyned. Now I am to inquire onely two thinges at you concerning
the last kinde, I meane the Dæmoniackes. The first is, whereby shal
these possessed folks be discerned fra them that ar trubled with a
natural Phrensie or Manie. The next is, how can it be that they can be
remedied by the *Papistes* Church, whome wee counting as Hereticques, it
should appeare that one Deuil should not cast out an other, for then
would *his kingdome be diuided in it selfe*, as CHRIST said.\[1\]

EPI. As to your first question; there are diuers symptomes, whereby that
heauie trouble may be discerned from a naturall sickenesse, and
speciallie three, omitting the diuers vaine signes that the *Papistes*
attributes vnto it: Such as the raging at holie water, their fleeing a
back from the Croce, their not abiding the hearing of God named, and
innumerable such like vaine thinges that were alike fashious and feckles
to recite. But to come to these three symptomes then, whereof I spake, I
account the one of them to be the incredible strength of the possessed
creature, which will farre exceede the strength of six of the wightest
and wodest of any other men that are not so troubled. The next is the

\[1. *Mat*. 12 *Mark*. 3\]

{p. 71}

boldning vp so far of the patients breast and bellie, with such an
vnnaturall sturring and vehement agitation within them: And such an
ironie hardnes of his sinnowes so stiffelie bended out, that it were not
possible to prick out as it were the skinne of anie other person so far:
so mightely works the Deuil in all the members and senses of his body,
he being locallie within the same, suppose of his Soule and affectiones
thereof, hee haue no more power then of any other mans. The last is, the
speaking of sundrie languages, which the patient is knowen by them that
were acquainte with him neuer to haue learned, and that with an vncouth
and hollowe voice, and al the time of his speaking, a greater motion
being in his breast then in his mouth. But fra this last symptome is
excepted such, as are altogether in the time of their possessing bereft
of al their senses being possessed with a dumme and blynde spirite,
whereof Christ releiued one, in the 12. Of *Mathew*. And as to your next
demande, it is first to be doubted if the *Papistes* or anie not
professing the the onelie true Religion, can relieue anie of that
trouble. And next, in-case they can, vpon what respectes it is possible
vnto them. As to the former vpon two reasons, it is grounded: first that
it is knowen so manie of them to bee counterfite, which wyle the Clergie
inuentes for confirming of their rotten Religion. The next is, that by
experience we finde that few, who are possessed indeede, are fullie
cured by them: but rather the Deuill is content to release the bodelie
hurting of them, for a

{p. 72}

shorte space, thereby to obteine the perpetual hurt of the soules of so
many that by these false miracles may be induced or confirmed in the
profession of that erroneous Religion: euen as I told you before that he
doth in the false cures, or casting off of diseases by Witches. As to
the other part of the argument in-case they can, which rather (with
reuerence of the learned thinking otherwaies) I am induced to beleeue,
by reason of the faithfull report that men sound of religion, haue made
according to their sight thereof, I think if so be, I say these may be
the respectes, whereupon the *Papistes* may haue that power. CHRIST gaue
a commission and power to his Apostles to cast out Deuilles, which they
according thereunto put in execution: The rules he had them obserue in
that action, was fasting and praier: & the action it selfe to be done in
his name. This power of theirs proceeded not then of anie vertue in
them, but onely in him who directed them. As was clearly proued by
*Iudas* his hauing as greate power in that commission, as anie of the
reste. It is easie then to be vnderstand that the casting out of
Deuilles, is by the vertue of fasting and prayer, and in-calling of the
name of God, suppose manie imperfectiones be in the person that is the
instrumente, as CHRIST him selfe teacheth vs of the power that false
Prophets sall haue to caste out Devils.\[1\] It is no wounder then,
these respects of this action being considered, that it may be possible
to the *Papistes*, though erring in sundrie points of Religion to
accomplish this, if they vse the right

\[1. *Mat*. 7.\]

{p. 73}

forme prescribed by CHRIST herein. For what the worse is that action
that they erre in other thinges, more then their Baptisme is the worse
that they erre in the other Sacrament, and haue eiked many vaine
freittes to the Baptisme it selfe.

PHI. Surelie it is no little wonder that God should permit the bodies of
anie of the faithfull to be so dishonoured, as to be a dwelling place to
that vncleane spirite.

EPI. There is it which I told right now, would prooue and strengthen my
argument of the deuils entring in the dead bodies of the faithfull. For
if he is permitted to enter in their liuing bodies, euen when they are
ioyned with the soule: how much more will God permit him to enter in
their dead carions, which is no more man, but the filthie and
corruptible caise of man. For as CHRIST Sayth, *It is not any thing that
enters within man that defiles him, but onely that which proceedes and
commeth out of him*.\[1\]

### CHAP. V. ARGV.

The description of the fourth kinde of Spirites called the Phairie

: What is possible therein, and what is but illusiones. How far this
Dialogue entreates of all these thinges, and to what end.

PHILOMATHES.

NOW I pray you come on to that fourth kinde of spirites.

EPI. That fourth kinde of spirites, which by the Gentiles was called
*Diana*, and her wandring Court, and amongst vs was called the Phairie
(as I

\[1. *Mark*. 7\]

{p. 74}

tould you) or our good neighboures, was one of the sortes of illusiones
that was rifest in the time of *Papistrie*: for although it was holden
odious to Prophesie by the deuill, yet whome these kinde of Spirites
carryed awaie, and informed, they were thought to be sonsiest and of
best life. To speake of the many vaine trattles founded vpon that
illusion: How there was a King and Queene of *Phairie*, of such a iolly
court & train as they had, how they had a teynd, & dutie, as it were, of
all goods: how they naturallie rode and went, eate and drank, and did
all other actiones like naturall men and women: I thinke it liker
VIRGILS *Campi Elysij*, nor anie thing that ought to be beleeued by
Christians, except in generall, that as I spake sundrie times before,
the deuil illuded the senses of sundry simple creatures, in making them
beleeue that they saw and harde such thinges as were nothing so indeed.

PHI. But how can it be then, that sundrie Witches haue gone to death
with that confession, that they haue ben transported with the *Phairie*
to such a hill, which opening, they went in, and there saw a faire
Queene, who being now lighter, gaue them a stone that had sundrie
vertues, which at sundrie times hath bene produced in judgement?

EPI. I say that, euen as I said before of that imaginar rauishing of the
spirite foorth of the bodie. For may not the deuil object to their
fantasie, their senses being dulled, and as it were a sleepe, such
hilles & houses within them, such glistering courts and traines, and
whatsoeuer such like wherewith he pleaseth to delude them. And in the
meane

{p. 75}

time their bodies being senselesse, to conuay in their hande any stone
or such like thing, which he makes them to imagine to haue receiued in
such a place.

PHI. But what say ye to their fore-telling the death of sundrie
persones, whome they alleage to haue seene in these places? That is, a
sooth-dreame (as they say) since they see it walking.

EPI. I thinke that either they haue not bene sharply inough examined,
that gaue so blunt a reason for their Prophesie, or otherwaies, I thinke
it likewise as possible that the Deuill may prophesie to them when he
deceiues their imaginationes in that sorte, as well as when he plainely
speakes vnto them at other times for their prophesying, is but by a
kinde of vision, as it were, wherein he commonly counterfeits God among
the Ethnicks, as I told you before.

PHI. I would know now whether these kindes of spirites may only appeare
to Witches, or if they may also appeare to anie other.

EPI. They may do to both, to the innocent sort, either to affraie them,
or to seeme to be a better sorte of folkes nor vncleane spirites are,
and to the Witches, to be a cullour of safetie for them, that ignorant
Magistrates may not punish them for it, as I told euen now. But as the
one sorte, for being perforce troubled with them ought to be pittied, so
ought the other sorte (who may bee discerned by their taking vppon them
to Prophesie by them,) That sorte I say, ought as seuerely to be
punished as any other Witches, and rather the more, that

{p. 76}

that they goe dissemblingly to woorke.

PHI. And what makes the spirites haue so different names from others.

EPI. Euen the knauerie of that same deuil; who as hee illudes the
*Necromancers* with innumerable feyned names for him and his angels, as
in special, making *Sathan*, *Beelzebub*, & *Lucifer*, to be three
sundry spirites, where we finde the two former, but diuers names giuen
to the Prince of all the rebelling angels by the Scripture. As by
CHRIST, the Prince of all the Deuilles is called, *Beelzebub* in that
place, which I alleaged against the power of any hereticques to cast out
Deuils. By IOHN in the Reuelation, the old tempter is called, *Sathan
the Prince of all the euill angels*. And the last, to wit, *Lucifer*, is
but by allegorie taken from the *day Starre* (so named in diuers places
of the Scriptures) because of his excellencie (I meane the Prince of
them) in his creation before his fall. Euen so I say he deceaues the
Witches, by attributing to himselfe diuers names: as if euery diuers
shape that he trans formes himselfe in, were a diuers kinde of spirit.

PHI. But I haue hard many moe strange tales of this *Phairie*, nor ye
haue yet told me.

EPI. As well I do in that, as I did in all the rest of my discourse. For
because the ground of this conference of ours, proceeded of your
speering at me at our meeting, if there was such a thing as Witches or
spirites: And if they had any power: I therefore haue framed my whole
discours, only to proue that such things are and may be, by such number
of examples as I show to be possible by reason: & keepes

{p. 77}

me from dipping any further in playing the part of a Dictionarie, to
tell what euer I haue read or harde in that purpose, which both would
exceede fayth, and rather would seeme to teach such vnlawfull artes, nor
to disallow and condemne them, as it is the duetie of all Christians to
do.

### CHAP. VI. ARGV.

Of the tryall and punishment of Witches. What sorte of accusation ought
to be admitted against them. What is the cause of the increasing so far
of their number in this age.

PHILOMATHES.

THEN To make an ende of our conference, since I see it drawes late, what
forme of punishment thinke ye merites these *Magicians* and Witches? For
I see that ye account them to be all alike guiltie?

EPI. They ought to be put to death according to the Law of God, the
ciuill and imperial law, and municipall law of all Christian nations.

PHI. But what kinde of death I pray you?

EPI. It is commonly vsed by fire, but that is an indifferent thing to be
vsed in euery cuntrie, according to the Law or custome thereof.

PHI. But ought no sexe, age nor ranck to be exempted?

EPI. None at al (being so vsed by the lawful Magistrate) for it is the
highest poynt of Idolatrie, wherein no exception is admitted by the law
of God.

PHI. Then bairnes may not be spared?

EPI. Yea, not a haire the lesse of my conclusion.

{p. 78}

For they are not that capable of reason as to practise such thinges. And
for any being in company and not reueiling thereof, their lesse and
ignorant age will no doubt excuse them.

PHI. I see ye condemne them all that are of the counsell of such
craftes.

EPI. No doubt, for as I said, speaking of *Magie*, the consulters,
trusters in, ouer-seers, interteiners or sturrers vp of these
craftes-folkes, are equallie guiltie with themselues that are the
practisers.

PHI. Whether may the Prince then, or supreame Magistrate, spare or
ouer-see any that are guiltie of that craft? vpon som great respects
knowen to him?

EPI. The Prince or Magistrate for further tryals cause, may continue the
punishing of them such a certaine space as he thinkes conuenient: But in
the end to spare the life, and not to strike when God bids strike, and
so seuerelie punish in so odious a fault & treason against God, it is
not only vnlawful, but doubtlesse no lesse sinne in that Magistrate, nor
it was in SAVLES sparing of AGAG\[1\]. And so comparable to the sin of
Witch-craft it selfe, as SAMVELL alleaged at that time.

PHI. Surely then, I think since this crime ought to be so seuerely
punished. Iudges ought to beware to condemne any, but such as they are
sure are guiltie, neither should the clattering reporte of a carling
serue in so weightie a case.

EPI. Iudges ought indeede to beware whome they condemne: For it is as
great a crime (as SALOMON sayeth,) *To condemne the innocent, as to let
the guiltie escape free*;\[2\] neither ought the report of any

\[1. 1. *Sam*. 15.

2\. *Pro*. 17\]

{p. 79}

one infamous person, be admitted for a sufficient proofe, which can
stand of no law.

PHI. And what may a number then of guilty persons confessions, woork
against one that is accused?

EPI. The assise must serue for interpretour of our law in that respect.
But in my opinion, since in a mater of treason against the Prince,
barnes or wiues, or neuer so diffamed persons, may of our law serue for
sufficient witnesses and proofes. I thinke surely that by a far greater
reason, such witnesses may be sufficient in matters of high treason
against God: For who but Witches can be prooues, and so witnesses of the
doings of Witches.

PHI. Indeed, I trow they wil be loath to put any honest man vpon their
counsell. But what if they accuse folke to haue bene present at their
Imaginar conuentiones in the spirite, when their bodies lyes sencelesse,
as ye haue said.

EPI. I think they are not a haire the lesse guiltie: For the Deuill
durst neuer haue borrowed their shaddow or similitude to that turne, if
their consent had not bene at it: And the consent in these turnes is
death of the law.

PHI. Then SAMVEL was a Witch: For the Deuill resembled his shape, and
played his person in giuing response to SAVLE.

EPI. SAMVEL was dead aswell before that; and so none coulde slander him
with medling in that vnlawfull arte. For the cause why, as I take it,
that God will not permit Sathan to vse the shapes or similitudes of any
innocent persones at such vnlawful times, is that God wil not permit
that any inno-

{p. 80}

cent persons shalbe slandered with that vile defection: for then the
deuil would find waies anew, to calumniate the best. And this we haue in
proofe by them that are carryed with the *Phairie*, who neuer see the
shaddowes of any in that courte, but of them that thereafter are tryed
to haue bene brethren and sisters of that craft. And this was likewise
proued by the co<sup>\~</sup>fession of a young Lasse, troubled with
spirites, laide on her by Witchcraft. That although shee saw the shapes
of diuerse men & women troubling her, and naming the persons whom these
shaddowes represents: yet neuer one of them are found to be innocent,
but al clearely tried to be most guilty, & the most part of them
confessing the same. And besides that, I think it hath ben seldome harde
tell of, that any whome persones guiltie of that crime accused, as
hauing knowen them to be their marrowes by eye-sight, and not by
hear-say, but such as were so accused of Witch-craft. could not be
clearely tryed vpon them, were at the least publickly knowen to be of a
very euil life & reputation: so iealous is God I say, of the fame of
them that are innocent in such causes. And besides that, there are two
other good helpes that may be vsed for their trial: the one is the
finding of their marke, and the trying the insensiblenes thereof. The
other is their fleeting on the water: for as in a secret murther, if the
deade carcase be at any time thereafter handled by the murtherer, it wil
gush out of bloud, as if the blud wer crying to the heauen for reuenge
of the murtherer. God hauing appoynted that secret super-naturall signe,
for tryall of that secrete

{p. 81}

vnnaturall crime, so it appeares that God hath appoynted (for a
super-naturall signe of the monstruous impietie of the Witches) that the
water shal refuse to receiue them in her bosom, that haue shaken off
them the sacred Water of Baptisme, and wilfullie refused the benefite
thereof: No not so much as their eyes are able to shed teares (thretten
and torture them as ye please) while first they repent (God not
permitting them to dissemble their obstinacie in so horrible a crime)
albeit the women kinde especially, be able other-waies to shed teares at
euery light occasion when they will, yea, although it were dissemblingly
like the *Crocodiles*.

PHI. Well, wee haue made this conference to last as long as leasure
would permit: And to conclude then, since I am to take my leaue of you,
I pray God to purge this Cuntrie of these diuellishe practises: for they
were neuer so rife in these partes, as they are now.

EPI. I pray God that so be to. But the causes ar ouer manifest, that
makes them to be so rife. For the greate wickednesse of the people on
the one parte, procures this horrible defection, whereby God justlie
punisheth sinne, by a greater iniquitie. And on the other part, the
consummation of the worlde, and our deliuerance drawing neare, makes
Sathan to rage the more in his instruments, knowing his kingdome to be
so neare an ende. And so fare-well for this time.\[1\]
