from the series BODLEY HEAD QUARTOS published by John Lane, The Bodley
Head Ltd., London between 1922 and 1926

{Scanned at Intangible Textual Heritage, November 2001. The pagination
is that of the Bodley Head edition. Word breaks between pages and
typographical errors have been preserved. The letter 'o tilde' is
written o<sup>\~</sup>. The original 16th Century spelling has been
retained throughout.--*jbh*.}

### NOTE

THE ORIGINAL of this text is in the Bodleian Library (Douce. I. 230,
which, however, lacks pp. 9 and 10; these have been taken from 'Wood
B21'). The text (*not the Preface*) is reprinted line for line and page
for page; pages are numbered as in the original. The few corrections
which I have made are noted on p. 82.
