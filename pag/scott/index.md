This is a series of essays by Sir Walter Scott on the subject of the
witch-craze, demonology, and other occult topics. It is an early review
of the literature that others such as Murray would be analyzing in the
next century. Scott has an antiquarian mind, and obviously relishes
exposing the reader to the grotesque and the unusual.

Since this text was not scanned at Intangible Textual Heritage, I'm not
sure how this came about. Possibly a reader can clear this up. - *J.B.
