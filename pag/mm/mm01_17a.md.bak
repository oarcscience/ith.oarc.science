# Malleus Maleficarum Part 1

## Question XVII

### A Comparison of their Crimes under Fourteen Heads, with the Sins of the Devils of all and every Kind.

        So heinous are the crimes of witches that they even exceed the
sins and the fall of the bad Angels; and if this is true as to their
guilt, how should it not also be true of their punishments in hell? And
it is not difficult to prove this by various arguments with regard to
their guilt. And first, although the sin of Satan is unpardonable, this
is not on account of the greatness of his crime, having regard to the
nature of the Angels, with particular attention to the opinion of those
who say that the Angels were created only in a state of nature, and
never in a state of grace. And since the good of grace exceeds the good
of nature, therefore the sins of those who fall from a state of grace,
as do the witches by denying the faith which they received in baptism,
exceed the sins of the Angels. And even if we say that the Angels were
created, but not confirmed, in grace; so also witches, though they are
not created in grace, have yet of their own will fallen from grace; just
as Satan sinned of his own will.  
        Secondly, it is granted that Satan's sin is unpardonable for
various other reasons. For S. Augustine saus that he sinned at the
instigation of none, therefore his sin is justly remediable by none. And
S. John Damascene says that he sinned in his understanding against the
character of God; and that his sin was the greater by reason of the
nobility of his understanding. For the servant who knows the will of his
master, etc. The same authority says that, since Satan is incapable of
repentance, therefore he is incapable of pardon; and this is due to his
very nature, which, being spiritual, could only be changed once, when he
changed it for ever; but this is not so with men, in whom the flesh is
always warring against the spirit. Or because he sinned in the high
places of heaven, whereas man sins in the earth.  
        But notwithstanding all this, his sin is in many respects small
in comparison with the crimes of witches. First, as S. Anselm showed in
one of his *Sermons*, he sinned in his pride while there was yet no
punishment for sin. But witches continue to sin after great punishments
have been often inflicted upon many other witches, and after the
punishments which the Church teaches them have been inflicted by reason
of the devil and his fall; and they make light of all these, and hasten
to commit, not the least deadly of sins, as do other sinners who sin
through infirmity or wickedness yet not from habitual malice, but rather
the most horrible crimes from the deep malice of their hearts.  
        Secondly, although the Bad Angel fell from innocence to guilt,
and thence to misery and punishment; yet he fell from innocence once
only, in such a way that he was never restored. But the sinner who is
restored to innocence by baptism, and again falls from it, falls very
deep. And this is especially true of witches, as is proved by their
crimes.  
        Thirdly, he sinned against the Creator; but we, and especially
witches, sin against the Creator and the Redeemer.  
        Fourthly, he forsook God, who permitted him to sin but accorded
him no pity; whereas we, and witches above all, withdraw ourselves from
God by our sins, while, in spite of his permission of our sins, He
continually pities us and prevents us with His countless benefits.  
        Fifthly, when he sinned, God rejected him without showing him
and grace; whereas we wretches run into sin although God is continually
calling us back.  
        Sixthly, he keeps his heart hardened against a punisher; but we
against a merciful persuader. Both sin against God; but he against a
commanding God, and we against One who dies for us, Whom, as we have
said, wicked witches offend above all.  
  

*The Solutions of the Arguments again Declare the Truth by Comparison.*

  
        To the arguments. The answer to the first is clear from what was
said in the beginning of this whole question. It was submitted that one
sin ought to be thought heavier than another; and that the sins of
witches are heavier than all others in respect of guilt, but not in
respect of the penalties that they entail. To this it must be said that
the punishment of Adam, just as his guilt, may be considered two ways;
either as touching him personally, or as touching the whole of nature,
that is, the posterity whcih came after him. As to the first, greater
sins have been committed after Adam; for he sinned only in doing that
which was evil, not in itself, but because it was forbidden. Therefore
such sins deserve the heavier punishment.  
        As to the second, it is true that the greatest punishment
resulted from the first sin; but this is only indirectly true, in that
through Adam all posterity was infected with original sin, and he was
the first father of all those for whom the Only Son of God was able to
atone by the power which was ordained. Moreover, Adam in his own person,
with the mediation of Divine grace, repented, and was afterwards saved
through the Sacrifice of Christ. But the sins of witches are
incomparably greater, since they are not content with their own sins and
perdition, but ever draw countless others after them.  
        And thirdly, it follows from what has been said that it was by
accident that Adam's sin involved the greater injury. For he found
nature uncorrupted, and it was inevitable, and not of his own will, that
he left it defiled; therefore it does not follow that his sin was
intrinsically greater than others. And again, posterity would have
committed the same sin if it had found nature in the same state.
Similarly, he who has not found grace does not commit so deadly a sin as
he who has found it and lost it. This is the solution of S. Thomas (II,
21, art. 2), in his solution of the second argument. And if anyone
wishes fully to understand this solution, he must consider that even if
Adam had kept his original innocence, he would not have passed it down
to all posterity; for, as S. Anselm says, anyone coming after him could
still have sinned. See also S. Thomas, dist. 20, where he considers
whether new-born children would have been confirmed in grace; and in
dist. 101, whether men who are now saved would have been saved if Adam
had not sinned.

Here follows the Method of Preaching against and Controverting Five
Arguments of Laymen and Lewd Folk, which seem to be Variously Approved,
that God does not Allow so Great Power to the Devil and Witches as is
involved in the Performance of such Mighty Works of Witchcraft.
