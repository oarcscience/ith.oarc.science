<H2>Question X</H2>
<H3>Whether Witches can by some Glamour Change Men into Beasts.</H3></CENTER>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Here we declare the truth as to whether and how witches transform men into 
beasts. And it is argued that this is not possible, from the following 
passage of <I>Episcopus</I> (XXVI, 5): Whoever believes that it is possible 
for any creature to be changed for the better or for the worse, or to be 
transformed into any other shape or likeness, except by the Creator Himself, 
Who made all things, is without doubt an infidel, and worse than a pagan.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And we will quote the arguments of S. Thomas in the <I>2nd Book of Sentences</I>, 
VIII: Whether devils can affect the bodily sense by the delusion of a 
glamour. There he argues first that they cannot. For though that shape of a 
beast which is seen must be somewhere, it cannot exist only in the senses; 
for the sense perceive no shape that is not received from actual matter, and 
there is no actual beast there; and he adduces the authority of the Canon. 
And again, that which seems to be, cannot really be; as in the case of a 
woman who seems to be a beast, for two substantial shapes cannot exist at 
one and the same time in the same matter. Therefore, since that shape of a 
beast which appears cannot exist anywhere, no glamour or illusion can exist 
in the eye of the beholder; for the sight must have some object in which it 
terminates.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And if it is argued that the shape exists in the surrounding atmosphere, 
this is not possible; both because the atmosphere is not capable of taking 
any shape or form, and also because the air around that person is not always 
constant, and cannot be so on account of its fluid nature, especially when 
it is moved. And again because in that case such a transformation would be 
visible to everyone; but this is not so, because the devils seem to be 
unable to deceive the sight of Holy Men in the least.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Besides, the sense of sight, or the faculty of vision, is a passive faculty, 
and every passive faculty is set in motion by the active agent that 
corresponds to it. Now the active agent corresponding to sight is twofold: 
one is the origin of the act, or the object; the other is the carrier, or 
medium. But that apparent shape cannot be the object of the sense, neither 
can it be the medium through which it is carried. First, it cannot be the 
object, since it cannot be taken hold of by anything, as was shown in the 
foregoing argument, since it does not exist in the senses received from an 
object, neither is it in the actual object, nor even in the air, as in a 
carrying medium, as was treated of above in the third argument.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Besides, if the devil moves the inner consciousness, he does so either by 
projecting himself into the cognitive faculty, or by changing it. But he 
does not do so by projecting himself; for he would either have to assume a 
body, and even so could not penetrate into the inner organ of imagination; 
for two bodies cannot be at the same time in the same place; or he would 
assume a phantasmal body; and this again would be impossible, since no 
phantasm is quite without substance.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Similarly also he cannot do it by changing the cognition. For he would either 
change it by alteration, which he does not seem able to do, since all 
alteration is caused by active qualities, in which the devils are lacking; 
or he would change it by transformation or local motion; and this does not 
seem feasible for two reasons. First, because a transformation or an organ 
cannot be effect without a sense of pain. Secondly, because in this case the 
devil would only make things of a known shape appear; but S. Augustine says 
that he creates shapes of this sort, both known and unknown. Therefore it 
seems that the devils can in no way deceive the imagination or senses of a 
man.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<I>But against this</I>, S. Augustine says (<I>de Ciuitate Dei</I>, XVIII) 
that the transmutations of men into brute animals, said to be done by the art 
of devils, are not actual but only apparent. But this would not be possible 
if devils were not able to transmute the human senses. The authority of 
S. Augustine is again to the point in Book LXXXIII, which has already been 
quoted: This evil of the devil creeps in through all the sensual approaches, 
etc.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<I>Answer</I>. If the reader wishes to refer to the method of transmutation, 
he will find in the Second Part of this work, chapter VI, various methods. 
But proceeding for the present in a scholastic manner, let us say in 
agreement with the opinions of the three Doctors, that the devil can deceive 
the human fancy so that a man really seems to be an animal. The last of 
those opinions, which is that of S. Thomas, is more subtle than the rest. 
But the first is that of S. Antoninus in the 
first part of his <I>Summa</I>, V, 5, where he declares that the devil at 
times works to deceive a man's fancy, especially by an illusion of the 
senses; and he proves this by natural reasoning, by the authority of the 
Canon, and by a great number of examples.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And at first as follows: Our bodies naturally are subject to and obey the 
angelic nature as regards local motion. But the bad angels, although the 
have lost grace, have not lost their natural power, as has often been said 
before. And since the faculty of fancy or imagination is corporeal, that is, 
allied to a physical organ, it also is naturally subject to devils, so that 
they can transmute it, causing various phantasies, by the flow of the 
thoughts and perceptions to the original image received by them. So says 
S. Antoninus, and adds that it is proved by the following Canon 
(<I>Episcopus</I>, XXVI, 5): It must not be omitted that certain wicked 
women, perverted by Satan and seduced by the illusions and phantasms of 
devils, believe and profess that they ride in the night hours on certain 
beasts with Diana, the heathen goddess, or with Herodias, and with a 
countless number of women, and that in the untimely silence of night they 
travel over great distances of land. And later: Wherefore priests ought to 
preach to the people of God that they should know this to be altogether 
false, and that when such phantasms afflict the minds of the faithful, it 
is not of God, but of an evil spirit. For Satan himself transforms himself 
into the shape and likeness of different persons, and in dreams deluding 
the mind which he holds captive, leads it through devious ways.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Indeed the meaning of this Canon has been treated of in the First Question, 
as to the four things which are to be preached. But it would be to 
misunderstand its meaning to maintain that witches cannot be so transported, 
when they wish and God does not prevent it; for very often men who are not 
witches are unwillingly transported bodily over great distances of land.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But that these transmutations can be effected in both ways will be shown by 
the aforesaid <I>Summa</I>, and in the chapter where S. Augustine relates 
that it is read in the books of the Gentiles that a certain sorceress named 
Circe changed the companions of Ulysses into beasts; but that this was due 
to some glamour or illusion, rather than an actual accomplishment, by 
altering the fancies of men; and this is clearly proved by several examples.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
For we read in the <I>Lives of the Fathers</I>, that a certain girl would not 
consent to a young man who was begging her to commit a shameful act with 
him. And the young man, being angry because of this, caused a certain Jew 
to work a charm against her, by which she was changed into a filly. But this 
metamorphosis was not an actual fact, but an illusion of the devil, who 
changed the fancy and sense of the girl herself, and of those who looked at 
her, so that she seemed to be a filly, who was really a girl. For when she 
was led to the Blessed Macarius, the devil could not so work as to deceive 
his senses as he had those of other people, on account of his sanctity; 
for to him she seemed a true girl, not a filly. And at length by his prayer 
she was set free from that illusion, and it is said that this had happened 
to her because she did not give her mind to holy things, or attend the 
Sacraments as she ought; therefore the devil had power over her, although 
she was in other respects honest.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Therefore the devil can, by moving the inner perceptions and humours, effect 
changes in the actions and faculties, physical, mental, and emotional, 
working by means of any physical organ soever; and this accords with S. 
Thomas, I, 91. And of this sort we may believe to have been the acts of 
Simon Magus in the incantations which are narrated of him. But the devil can 
do none of these things without the permission of God, Who with His good 
Angels often restrains the wickedness of him who seeks to deceive and hurt 
us. Wherefore S. Augustine, speaking of witches, says: These are they who, 
with the permission of God, stir up the elements, and confuse the minds of 
those who do not trust in God (XXVI, 5).<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Also devils can by witchcraft cause a man to be unable to see his wife 
rightly, and the converse. And this comes from an affectation of the fancy, 
so that she is represented to him as an odious and horrible thing. The devil 
also suggests representations of loathsome things to the fancy of both the 
waking and the sleeping, to deceive them and lead them to son. But because 
sin does not consist in the imagination but in the will, therefore man does 
not sin in these fancies suggested by the devil, and these various 
transformations, unless of his own will he consents to sin.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The second opinion of the modern Doctors is to the same effect, when they 
declare what is glamour, and how many ways the devil can cause such 
illusions. Here we refer to what has already been said concerning the 
arguments of S. Antoninus, which there is no need to repeat.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The third opinion is that of S. Thomas, and is an answer to the argument 
where it is asked, Wherein lies the existence of the shape of a beast that 
is seen; in the senses, or in reality, or in the surrounding air? And his 
opinion is that the apparent shape of a beast only exists in the inner 
perception, which, through the force of imagination, sees it in some way as 
an exterior object. And the devil has two ways of effecting such a result.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In one way we may say that the forms of animals which are conserved in the 
treasury of the imagination pass by the operation of the devil into the 
organs of inner senses; and in this way it happens in dreams, as has been 
declared above. And so, when these forms are impressed on the organs of the 
outer senses, such as sight, they appear as if they were present as outer 
objects, and could actually be touched.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The other way results from a change in the inner organs of perception, 
through which the judgement is deceived; as is shown in the case of him who 
has his taste corrupted, so that everything sweet seems bitter; and this is 
not very different from the first method. Moreover, even men can accomplish 
this by the virtue of certain natural things, as when in the vapour of a 
certain smoke the beams of a house appear to be serpents; and many other 
instances of this are found, as had been mentioned above.


<CENTER><I>Solutions of the Arguments.</I></CENTER>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
As to the first argument, that text is often quoted, but it is badly 
understood. For as to where it speaks of transformation into another shape 
or likeness, it has been made clear how this can be done by prestidigitatory 
art. And as to where it says that no creature can be made by the power of 
the devil, this is manifestly true if Made is understood to mean Created. 
But if the word Made is taken to refer to natural production, it is certain 
that devils can make some imperfect creatures. And S. Thomas shows how this 
may be done. For he says that all transmutations of bodily matters which 
can be effected by the forces of nature, in which the essential thing is the 
semen which is found in the elements of this world, on land or in the waters 
(as serpents and frogs and such things deposit their semen), can be effected 
by the work of devils who have acquired such semen. So also it is when 
anything is changed into serpents or frogs, which can be generated by 
putrefaction.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But those transmutations of bodily matters which cannot be effected by the 
forces of nature can in no way be truly effected by the work of the devils. 
For when the body of a man is changed into the body of a beast, or a dead 
body is brought to life, such things only seem to happen, and are a glamour 
or illusion; or else the devil appears before men in an assumed body.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
These arguments are substantiated. For Blessed Albertus in his book <I>On 
Animals</I>, where he examines whether devils, or let us even say witches, 
can really make animals, says that they can, with God's permission, make 
imperfect animals. But they cannot do so in an instant, as God does, but by 
means of some motion, however sudden, as is clear in the case of witches. 
And touching the passage in <I>Exodus</I> vii, where Pharao called his wise 
men, he says: The devils run throughout the world and collect various germs, 
and by using them can evolve various species. And the gloss thereon says: 
When witches attempt to effect anything by the invocation of devils, they 
run about the world and bring the semen of those things which are in 
question, and by its means, with the permission of God, they produce new 
species. But this has been spoken of above.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Another difficulty may arise, whether such devils' works are to be deemed 
miraculous. The answer was made clear in the preceding arguments, that even 
the devils can perform certain miracles to which their natural powers are 
adapted. And although such things are true in fact, they are not done with 
a view to the knowledge of the truth; and in this sense the works of 
Antichrist may be said to be deceptions, since they are done with a view to 
the seduction of men.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The answer to the other argument, that concerning the shape, is also clear. 
The shape of a beast which is seen does not exist in the air, but only in 
the perception of the senses, as has been demonstrated above from the 
opinion of S. Thomas.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
For the argument that every passive is set in motion by its corresponding 
active, this is granted. But when it is inferred that the shape which is 
seen cannot be the original object which sets in motion the act of sight, 
since it arises from none of the sense, it is answered that it does not 
arise, since it originates from some sensible image conserved in the 
imagination, which the devil can draw out and present to the imagination or 
power of perception, as has been said above.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
For the last argument, it is to be said that the devil does not, as has been 
shown, change the perceptive and imaginative powers by projecting himself 
into them, but by transmuting them; not indeed by altering them, except in 
respect of local motion. For he cannot of himself induce new appearances, 
as has been said. But he changes them by transmutation, that is, local 
motion. And this again he does, not by dividing the substance of the organ 
of perception, since that would result in a sense of pain, but by a movement 
of the perceptions and humours.<BR>
