# Malleus Maleficarum Part 2

## Chapter XI

### Of the Method by which they can Inflict Every Sort of Infirmity, generally Ills of the Graver Kind.

        But there is no bodily infirmity, not even leprosy or epilepsy,
which cannot be caused by witches, with God's permission. And this is
proved by the fact that no sort of infirmity is excepted by the Doctors.
For a careful consideration of what has already been written concerning
the power of devils and the wickedness of witches will show that this
statement offers no difficulty. Nider also deals with this subject both
in his *Book of Precepts* and in his *Formicarius*, where he asks:
Whether witches can actually injure men by their witchcraft. And the
question makes no exception of any infirmity, however incurable. And he
there answers that they can do so, and proceeds to ask in what way and
by what means.  
        And as to the first, he answers, as has been shown in the First
Question of the First Part of this treatise. And it is proved also by S.
Isidore where he describes the operations of witches (*Etym.* 8, cap.
9), and says that they are called witches on account of the magnitude of
their crimes; for they disturb the elements by raising up storms with
the help of devils, they confuse the minds of men in the ways already
mentioned, by either entirely obstructing or gravely impeding the use of
their reason. He adds also that without the use of any poison, but by
the mere virulence of their incantations, they can deprive men of their
lives.  
        It is proved also by S. Thomas in the *Second Book of
Sentences*, dist. 7 and 8, and in Book IV, dist. 34, and in general all
the Theologians write that witches can with the help of the devil bring
harm upon men and their affairs in all the ways in which the devil alone
can injure or deceive, namely, in their affairs, their reputation, their
body, their reason, and their life; which means that those injuries
which are caused by the devil without any witch, can also be caused by a
witch; and even more readily so, on account of the greater offence which
is given to the Divine Majesty, as has been shown above.  
        In *Job* i and ii is found a clear case of the injury in
temporal affairs. The injury to reputation is shown in the history of
the Blessed Jerome, that the devil transformed himself into the
appearance of S. Silvanus, Bishop of Nazareth, a friend of S. Jerome.
And this devil approached a noble woman by night in her bed and began
first to provoke and entice her with lewd words, and then invited her to
perform the sinful act. And when she called out, the devil in the form
of the saintly Bishop hid under the woman's bed, and being sought for
and found there, he in lickerish language declared lyingly that he was
the Bishop Silvanus. On the morrow therefore, when the devil had
disappeared, the holy man was scandalously defamed; but his good name
was cleared when the devil confessed at the tomb of S. Jerome that he
had done this in an assumed body.  
        The injury to the body is shown in the case of the Blessed Job,
who was stricken by the devil with terrible sores, which are explained
as a form of leprosy. And Sigisbert and Vincent of Beauvais (*Spec.
Hist.* XXV, 37) both tell that in the time of the Emperor Louis II, in
the diocese of Mainz, a certain devil began to thrown stones and to beat
at the houses as if with a hammer. And then by public statements, and
secret insinuations, he spread discord ad troubled the minds of many.
Then he excited the anger of all against one man, whose lodging, where
he was resting, he set on fire, and said that they were all suffering
for his sins. So at last that man had to find his lodging in the fields.
And when the priests were saying a litany on this account, the devil
stoned many of the people with stones till he hurt them to bleeding; and
sometimes he would desist, and sometimes rage; and this continued for
three years, until all the houses there were burned down.  
        Exampled of the injury to the use of the reason, and of the
tormenting of the inner perceptions, are seen in those possessed and
frenzied men of whom the Gospels tell. And as for death, and that they
deprive some of their lives, it is proved in *Tobias* vi, in the case of
the seven husbands of the virgin Sara, who were killed because of their
lecherous lust and unbridled desired for the virgin Sara, of whom they
were not worthy to be the husbands. Therefore it is concluded that both
by themselves, and all the more with the help of witches, devils can
injure men in every way without exception.  
        But if it is asked whether injuries of this sort are to be
ascribed rather to devils than to witches, it is answered that, when the
devils cause injuries by their own direct action, then they are
principally to be ascribed to them. But when they work through the
agency of witches for the disparagement and offending of God and the
perdition of souls, knowing that by this means God is made more angry
and allows them greater power of doing evil; and because they do indeed
perpetuate countless witchcrafts which the devil would not be allowed to
bring upon men if he wished to injure men alone by himself, but are
permitted, in the just and hidden purpose of God, through the agency of
witches, on account of their perfidy and abjuration of the Catholic
Faith; therefore such injuries are justly ascribed to witches
secondarily, however much the devil may be the principal actor.  
        Therefore when a woman dips a twig in water and sprinkles the
water in the air to make it rain, although she does not herself cause
the rain, and could not be blamed on that account, yet, because she has
entered into a pact with the devil by which she can do this as a witch,
although it is the devil who causes the rain, she herself nevertheless
deservedly bears the blame, because she is an infidel and does the
devil's work, surrendering herself to his service.  
        So also when a witch makes a waxen image or some such thing in
order to bewitch somebody; or when an image of someone appears by
pouring molten lead into water, and some injury is done upon the image,
such as piercing it or hurting it in any other way, when it is the
bewitched man who is in imagination being hurt; although the injury is
actually done to the image by some witch or some other man, and the
devil in the same manner invisibly injures the bewitched man, yet it is
deservedly ascribed to the witch. For, without her, God would never
allow the devil to inflict the injury, nor would the devil on his own
account try to injure the man.  
        But because it has been said that in the matter of their good
name the devils can injure men on the own account and without the
co-operation of witches, there may arise a doubt whether the devils
cannot also defame honest women so that they are reputed to be witches,
when they appear in their likeness to bewitch someone; from which it
would happen that such a woman would be defamed without cause.  
        In answering this we must premise a few remarks. First, it has
been said that the devil can do nothing without the Divine permission,
as is shown in the First Part of this work in the last Question. It has
also been shown that God does not allow so great power of evil against
the just and those who live in grace, as against sinners; and as the
devils have more power against sinners (see the text: When a strong man
armed, etc.) so they are permitted by God to afflict them more than the
just. Finally, although they can, with God's permission, injure the just
in their affairs, their reputation, and their bodily health, yet,
because they know that this power is granted them chiefly for the
increase of the merits of the just, they are the less eager to injure
them.  
        Therefore it can be said that in this difficulty there are
several points to be considered. First, the Divine permission. Secondly,
the man who is thought to be righteous, for they who are so reputed are
not always actually in a state of grace. Thirdly, the crime of which an
innocent man would be suspected; for that crime in its very origin
exceeds all the crimes of the world. Therefore it is to be said that it
is granted that, with God's permission, an innocent person, whether or
not he is in a state of grace, may be injured in his affairs to this
particular crime and the gravity of the accusation (for we have often
quoted S. Isidore's saying that they are called witches from the
magnitude of their crimes), it can be said that for an innocent person
to be defamed by the devil in a way that has been suggested does not
seem at all possible, for many reasons.  
        In the first place, it is one thing to be defamed in respect of
vices which are committed without any expressed or tacit contract with
the devil, such as theft, robbery, or fornication; but quite another
matter to be defamed in respect of vices which it is impossible to
accuse a man of having perpetrated unless he has entered upon an
expressed contract with the devil; and such are the works of witches,
which cannot be laid at their door unless it is by the power of devils
that they bewitch men, animals and the fruits of the earth. Therefore,
although the devil can blacken men's reputations in respect of other
vices, yet it does not seem possible for him to do so in respect of this
vice which cannot be perpetrated without his co-operation.  
        Besides, it has never hitherto been known to have happened that
an innocent person has been defamed by the devil to such an extent that
he was condemned to death for this particular crime. Furthermore, when a
person is only under suspicion, he suffers no punishment except that
which the Canon prescribes for his purgation, as will be shown in the
Third Part of this work in the second method of sentencing witches.  
        And it is set down there that, if such a man fails in his
purgation, he is to be considered guilty, but that he should be solemnly
adjured before the punishment due to his sin is proceeded with and
enforced. But here we are dealing with actual events; and it has never
yet been known that an innocent person has been punished on suspicion of
witchcraft, and there is no doubt that God will never permit such a
thing to happen.  
        Besides, He does not suffer the innocent who are under Angelic
protection to be suspected of smaller crimes, such as robbery and such
things; then all the more will He preserve those who are under that
protection from suspicion of the crime of witchcraft.  
        And it is no valid objection to quote the legend of S.
Germanius, when devils assumed the bodies of other women and sat down at
table and slept with the husbands, deluding the latter into the belief
that those women were in their own bodies eating and drinking with them,
as we have mentioned before. For the women in this case are not to be
held guiltless. For in the Canon (*Episcopi* 26. q. 2) such women are
condemned for thinking that they are really and actually transported,
when they are so only in imagination; although, as we have shown above,
they are at times bodily transported by devils.  
        But our present proposition is that they can, with God's
permission, cause all other infirmities, with no exception; and it is to
be concluded from what we have said that this is so. For no exception is
made by the Doctors, and there is no reason why there should be any,
since, as we have often said, the natural power of devils is superior to
all corporeal power. And we have found in our experience that this is
true. For although greater difficulty may be felt in believing that
witches are able to cause leprosy or epilepsy, since these diseases
arise from some long-standing physical predisposition or defect, none
the less it has sometimes been found that even these have been caused by
witchcraft. For in the diocese of Basel, in the district of Alsace and
Lorraine, a certain honest labourer spoke roughly to a certain
quarrelsome woman, and she angrily threatened him that she would soon
avenge herself on him. He took little notice of her; but on the same
night he felt a pustule grow upon his neck, and he rubbed it a little,
and found his whole face and neck puffed up and swollen, and a horrible
form of leprosy appeared all over his body. He immediately went to his
friends for advice, and told them of the woman's threat, and said that
he would stake his life on the suspicion that this had been done to him
by the magic art of that same witch. In short, the woman was taken,
questioned, and confessed her crimes. But when the judge asked her
particularly about the reason for it, and how she had done it, she
answered: “When that man used abusive words to me, I was angry and went
home; and my familiar began to ask the reason for my ill humour. I told
him, and begged him to avenge me on the man. And he asked what I wanted
him to do to him; and I answered that I wished he would always have a
swollen face. And the devil went away and afflicted the man even beyond
my asking; for I had not hoped that he would infect him with such sore
leprosy.” And so the woman was burned.  
        And in the diocese of Constance, between Breisach and Freiburg,
there is a leprous woman (unless she has paid the debt of all flesh
within these two years) who used to tell to many people how the same
thing had happened to her by reason of a similar quarrel which took
place between her and another woman. For one night when she went out of
the house to do something in front of the door, a warm wind came from
the house of the other woman, which was opposite, and suddenly struck
her face; and from that time she had been afflicted with the leprosy
which she now suffered.  
        And lastly, in the same diocese, in the territory of the Black
Forest, a witch was being lifted by a gaoler on to the pile of wood
prepared for her burning, and she said: ”I will pay you”; and blew into
his face. And he was at once afflicted with a horrible leprosy all over
his body, and did not survive many days. For the sake of brevity, the
fearful crimes of this witch, and many more instances could be
recounted, are omitted. For we have often found that certain people have
been visited with epilepsy or the falling sickness by means of eggs
which have been buried with dead bodies, especially the dead bodies of
witches, together with other ceremonies of which we cannot speak,
particularly when these eggs have been given to a person either in food
or drink.
