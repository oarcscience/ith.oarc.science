# Malleus Maleficarum Part 1

## Question XI

### That Witches who are Midwives in Various Ways Kill the Child Conceived in the Womb, and Procure an Abortion; or if they do not this Offer New-born Children to Devils.

        Here is set forth the truth concerning four horrible crimes
which devils commit against infants, both in the mother's womb and
afterwards. And since the devils do these things through the medium of
women, and not men, this form of homicide is associated rather with
women than with men, And the following are the methods by which it is
done.  
        The Canonists treat more fully than the Theologians of the
obstructions due to witchcraft; and they say that is is witchcraft, not
only when anyone is unable to perform the carnal act, of which we have
spoken above; but also when a woman is prevented from conceiving, or is
made to miscarry after she has conceived. A third and fourth method of
witchcraft is when they have failed to procure an abortion, and then
either devour the child or offer it to a devil.  
        There is no doubt concerning the first two methods, since,
without the help of devils, a man can by natural means, such as herbs,
savin for example, or other emmenagogues, procure that a woman cannot
generate or conceive, as has bee mentioned above. But with the other two
methods it is different; for they are effected by witches. And there is
no need to bring forward the arguments, since very evident instances and
examples will more readily show the truth of this matter.  
        The former of these two abominations is the fact that certain
witches, against the instinct of human nature, and indeed against the
nature of all beasts, with the possible exception of wolves, are in the
habit of devouring and eating infant children. And concerning this, the
Inquisitor of Como, who has been mentioned before, has told us the
following: that he was summoned by the inhabitants of the County of
Barby to hold an inquisition, because a certain man had missed his child
from its cradle, and finding a congress of women in the night-time,
swore that he saw them kill his child and drink its blood and devour it.
Also, in one single year, which is the year now last passed, he says
that forty-one witches were burned, certain others taking flight to the
Lord Archduke of Austria, Sigismund. For confirmation of this there are
certain writings of John Nider in his *Formicarius*, of whom, as of
those events which he recounts, the memory is still fresh in men's
minds; wherefore it is apparent that such things are not incredible. We
must add that in all these matters witch midwives cause yet greater
injuries, as penitent witches have often told to us and to others,
saying: No one does more harm to the Catholic Faith than midwives. For
when they do not kill children, then, as if for some other purpose, they
take them out of the room and, raising them up in the air, offer them to
devils. But the method which they observe in crimes of this sort will be
shown in the Second Part, which we must soon approach. But first one
more question must be inquired into, namely, that of the Divine
permission. For it was said at the beginning that three things are
necessary for the effecting of witchcraft: the devil, a witch, and the
Divine permission.

Whether the Permission of Almighty God is an Accompaniment of
Witchcraft.
