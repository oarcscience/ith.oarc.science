# Malleus Maleficarum Part 2

## Chapter X

### Of the Method by which Devils through the Operations of Witches sometimes actually possess men.

        It has been shown in the previous chapter how devils can enter
the heads and other parts of the body of men, and can move the inner
mental images from place to place. But someone may doubt whether they
are able at the instance of witches to obsess men entirely; or fell some
uncertainty about their various methods of causing such obsession
without the instance of witches. And to clear up these doubts we must
undertake three explanations. First, as to the various methods of
possession. Secondly, how at the instance of witches and with God's
permission devils at time possess men in all those ways. Thirdly, we
must substantiate our arguments with facts and examples.  
        With references to the first, we must make an exception of that
general method by which the devil inhabits a man in any mortal sin. S.
Thomas, in Book 3, quest. 3, speaks of this method where he considers
the doubt whether the devil always substantially possesses a man when he
commits mortal sin; and the reason for the doubt is that the indwelling
Holy Ghost always forms a man with grace, according to I. *Corinthians*,
iii: Ye are the temple of God, and the spirit of God dwelleth in you.
And, since guilt is opposed to grace, it would seem that there were
opposing forces in the same place.  
        And there he proves that to possess a man can be understood in
two ways: either with regard to the soul, or with regard to the body.
And in the first way it is not possible for the devil to possess the
soul, since God alone can enter that; therefore the devil is not in this
way the cause of sin, which the Holy Spirit permits the soul itself to
commit; so there is no similitude between the two.  
        But as to the body, we may say that the devil can possess a man
in two ways, just as there are two classes of men: those who are in sin,
and those who are in grace. In the first way, we may say that, since a
man is by any mortal sin brought into the devil's service, in so far as
the devil provides the outer suggestion of sin either to the senses or
to the imagination, to that extent he is said to inhabit the character
of a man when he is moved by every stirring temptation, like a ship in
the sea without a rudder.  
        The devil can also essentially possess a man as is clear in the
case of frantic men. But this rather belongs to the question of
punishment than that of sin, as will be shown; and bodily punishments
are not always the consequence of sin, but are inflicted now upon
sinners and now upon the innocent. Therefore both those who are and
those who are not in a state of grace can, in the depth of the
incomprehensible judgement of God, be essentially possessed by devils.
And though this method of possession is not quite pertinent to our
inquire, we have set it down lest it should seem impossible to anyone
that, with God's permission, men should at times be substantially
inhabited by devils at the instance of witches.  
        We may say, therefore, that just as there are five ways in which
devils by themselves, without witches, can injure and possess men, so
they can also do so in those ways at the instance of witches; since then
God is the more offended, and greater power of molesting men is allowed
to the devil through witches. And the methods are briefly the following,
excepting the fact that they sometimes plague a man through his external
possessions: sometimes they injure men only in their own bodies;
sometimes in their and in their faculties; sometimes they only tempt
them inwardly and outwardly; others they at times deprive of the use of
their reason; others they change into the appearance of irrational
beasts. We shall speak of these methods singly.  
        But first we shall rehearse five reasons why God allows men to
be possessed, for the sake of preserving a due order in our matter. For
sometimes a man is possessed for his own advantage; sometimes for a
slight sin of another; and sometimes for his own venial sin; sometimes
for another's heavy sin. For all these reasons let no one doubt that God
allows such things to be done by devils at the instance of witches; and
it is better to prove each of them by the Scriptures, rather than by
recent examples, since new things are always strengthened by old
examples.  
        For an example of the first is clearly shown in the *Dialogue*
of Severus, a very dear disciple of S. Martin, where he tells that a
certain Father of very holy life was so gifted by grace with the power
of expelling devils, that they were put to flight not only by his words,
but even by his letters or his hair-shirt. And since the Father became
very famous in the world, and felt himself tempted with vainglory,
although he manfully resisted that vice, yet, that he might be the more
humiliated, he prayed with his whole heart to God that he might be for
five months possessed by a devil; and this was done. For he was at once
possessed and had to be put in chains, and everything had to applied to
him which is customary in the case of demoniacs. But at the end of the
fifth month he was immediately delivered both from all vainglory and
from the devil. But we do not read, nor is it for the present
maintained, that for this reason a man can be possessed by a devil
through the witchcraft of another man; although, as we have said, the
judgements of God are incomprehensible.  
        For the second reason, when someone is possessed because of the
light sin of another, S. Gregory gives an example. The Blessed Abbot
Eleutherius, a most devout man, was spending the night near a convent of
virgins, who unknown to him ordered to be put by his cell a young boy
who used to be tormented all night by the devil. But on that same night
the boy was delivered from the devil by the presence of the Father. When
the Abbot learned of this, and the boy now being placed in the holy
man's monastery, after many days he began to exult rather immoderately
over the boy's liberation, and said to his brother monks: The devil was
playing his pranks with those Sisters, but he had not presumed to
approach this boy since he came to the servants of God. And behold! the
devil at once began to torment the boy. And by the tears and fasting of
the holy man and his brethren he was with difficulty delivered, but on
the same day. And indeed that an innocent person should be possessed for
the slight fault of another is not surprising when men are possessed by
devils for their own light fault, or for another's heavy sin, or for
their own heavy sin, and some also at the instance of witches.  
        Cassia, in his *First Collation* of the Abbot Serenus, gives an
example of how one Moses was possessed for his own venial sin. This
Moses, he says, was a hermit of upright and pious life; but because on
one occasion he engaged in a dispute with the Abbot Macharius, and went
a little too far in the expression of a certain opinion, he was
immediately delivered up to a terrible devil, who caused him to void his
natural excrements through his mouth. And that this scourge was
inflicted by God for the sake of purgation, lest any stain of his
momentary fault should remain in him, is clear from his miraculous cure.
For by continual prayers and submission to the Abbot Macharius, the vile
spirit was quickly driven away and departed from him.  
        A similar case is that related by S. Gregory in his *First
Dialogue* of the nun who ate a lettuce without having first made the
sign of the Cross, and was set free by the Blessed Father Equitius.  
        In the same *Dialogue* St. Gregory tells an example of the
fourth case, where someone in possessed because of the heavy sin of
another. The Blessed Bishop Fortunatus had driven the devil from a
possessed man, and the devil began to walk about the streets of the city
in the guise of a pilgrim, crying out: Oh, the holy man Bishop
Fortunatus! See, he has cast me, a pilgrim, out of my lodging, and I can
find no rest anywhere. Then a certain man sitting with his wife and son
invited the pilgrim to lodge with him, and asking why he had been turned
out, was delighted with the derogatory story of the holy man which the
pilgrim had invented. And thereupon the devil entered his son, and cast
him upon the fire, and killed him. And then for the first time did the
unhappy father understand whom he had received as a guest.  
        And fifthly, we read many examples of men being possessed for
their own heavy sin, both in the Holy Scripture and in the passions of
the Saints. For in I. *Kings* xv, Saul was possessed for disobedience to
God. And, as we have said, we have mentioned all these so that it need
not seem to anyone impossible that men should also be possessed because
of the crimes of, and at the instance of, witches. And we shall be able
to understand the various methods of such possession by quoting actual
examples.  
        In the time of Pope Pius II the following was the experience of
one of us two Inquisitors before he entered upon his office in the
Inquisition. A certain Bohemian from the town of Dachov brought his only
son, a secular priest, to Rome to be delivered, because he was
possessed. It happened that I, one of us Inquisitors, went into a
refectory, and that priest and his father came and sat down at the same
table with me. We saluted each other, and talked together, as is
customary; and the father kept sighing and praying Almighty God that his
journey might prove to have been successful. I felt great pity for him,
and began to ask what was the reason of his journey and of his sorrow.
Then he, in the hearing of his son who was sitting next to me at the
table, answered: “Alas! I have a son possessed by a devil, and with
great trouble and expense I have brought him here to be delivered.” And
when I asked where the son was, he showed me him sitting by my side. I
was a little frightened, and looked at him closely; and because he took
his food with such modesty, and answered piously to all questions, I
began to doubt that he was not possessed, but that some infirmity had
happened to him. Then the son himself told what had happened, showing
how and for how long he had been possessed, and saying: “A certain witch
brought this evil upon me. For I was rebuking her on some matter
concerned with the discipline of the Church, upbraiding her rather
strongly since she was of an obstinate disposition, when she said that
after a few days that would happen to me which has happened. And the
devil which possesses me has told me that a charm was placed by the
witch under a certain tree, and that until it was removed I could not be
delivered; but he would not tell me which was the tree.” But I would not
in the least have believed his words if he had not at once informed me
of the facts of the case. For when I asked him about the length of the
intervals during which he had the use of his reason more than is usual
in the case of persons possessed, he answered: “I am only deprived of
the use of my reason when I wish to contemplate holy things or to visit
sacred places. For the devil specifically told me in his own words
uttered through my mouth that, because he had up to that time been much
offended by my sermons to the people, we would in no way allow me to
preach.” For according to his father, he was a preacher full of grace,
and loved by all. But I, the Inquisitor, wishing for proofs, had him
taken for a fortnight and more to various holy places, and especially to
the Church of S. Praxedes the Virgin, where there is part of the marble
pillar to which Our Saviour was bound when He was scourged, and to the
place where S. Peter the Apostle was crucified; and in all these places
he uttered horrible cries while he was being exorcised, now saying that
he wished to come forth, and after a little maintaining the contrary.
And as we have said before, in all his behaviour he remained a sober
priest without any eccentricity, except during the process of any
exorcisms; and when these were finished, and the stole was taken from
his neck, he showed no sign of madness or any immoderate action. But
when he passed any church, and genuflected in honour of the Glorious
Virgin, the devil made him thrust his tongue far out of his mouth; and
when he was asked whether he could not restrain himself from doing this,
he answered: “I cannot help myself at all, for so he uses all my limbs
and organs, my neck, my tongue, and my lungs, whenever he pleases,
causing me to speak or to cry out; and I hear the words as if they were
spoken by myself, but I am altogether unable to restrain them; and when
I try to engage in prayer he attacks me more violently, thrusting out my
tongue.” And there was in the Church of S. Peter a column brought from
Solomon's Temple, by virtue of which many who are obsessed with devils
are liberated, because Christ had stood near it when He preached in the
Temple; but even here he could not be delivered, owing to the hidden
purpose of God which reserved another method for his liberation. For
though he remained shut in by the column for a whole day and night, yet
on the following day, after various exorcisms had been performed upon
him, with a great concourse of people standing round, he was asked by
which part of the column Christ had stood; and he bit the column with
his teeth, and, crying out, showed the place, saying: “Here He stood!
Here He stood!” And at last he said, “I will not go forth.” And when he
was asked why, he answered in the Italian tongue (although the poor
priest did not understand that language), They all practise such and
such things, naming the worst vice of lustfulness. And afterwards the
priest asked me, saying, “Father, what did those Italian words mean
which came from my mouth?” And when I told him, he answered, “I heard
the words, but I could not understand them.” Eventually it proved that
this demoniac was of that sort of which the Saviour spoke in the Gospel,
saying: This sort goeth not out save by prayer and fasting. For a
venerable Bishop, who had been driven from his see by the Turks, piously
took compassion on him, and by fasting on bread and water for forty
days, and by prayers and exorcisms, at last through the grace of God
delivered him and sent him back to his home rejoicing.
