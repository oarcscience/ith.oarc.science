# Malleus Maleficarum Part 2

## Question II

### Introduction, wherein is Set Forth the Difficulty of this Question.

        Is it lawful to remove witchcraft by means of further
witchcraft, or by any other forbidden means?  
        It is argued that it is not; for it has already been shown that
in the *Second Book of Sentences*, and the 8th Distinction, all the
Doctors agree that it is unlawful to use the help of devils, since to do
so involves apostasy from the Faith. And, it is argued, no witchcraft
can be removed without the help of devils. For it is submitted that it
must be cured either by human power, or by diabolic, or by Divine power.
It cannot be by the first; for the lower power cannot counteract the
higher, having no control over that which is outside its own natural
capacity. Neither can it be by Divine power; for this would be a
miracle, which God performs only at His own will, and not at the
instance of men. For when His Mother besought Christ to perform a
miracle to supply the need for wine, He answered: Woman, what have I to
do with thee? And the Doctors explain this as meaning, “What association
is there between you and me in the working of a miracle?” Also it
appears that it is very rarely that men are delivered from a bewitchment
by calling on God's help or the prayers of the Saints. Therefore it
follows that they can only be delivered by the help of devils; and it is
unlawful to seek such help.  
        Again it is pointed out that the common method in practice of
taking off a bewitchment, although it is quite unlawful, is for the
bewitched persons to resort to wise women, by whom they are very
frequently cured, and not by priests or exorcists. So experience shows
that such curses are effected by the help of devils, which it is
unlawful to seek; therefore it cannot be lawful thus to cure a
bewitchment, but it must patiently be borne.  
        It is further argued that S. Thomas and S. Bonaventura, in Book
IV, dist. 34, have said that a bewitchment must be permanent because it
can have no human remedy; for if there is a remedy, it is either unknown
to men or unlawful. And these words are taken to mean that this
infirmity is incurable and must be regarded as permanent; and they add
that, even if God should provide a remedy by coercing the devil, and the
devil should remove his plague from a man, and the man should be cured,
that cure would not be a human one. Therefore, unless God should cure
it, it is not lawful for a man to himself to try in any way to look for
a cure.  
        In the same place these two Doctors add that it is unlawful even
to seek a remedy by the superadding of another bewitchment. For they say
that, granting this to be possible, and that the original spell be
removed, yet the witchcraft is none the less to be considered permanent;
for it is in no way lawful to invoke the devil's help through
witchcraft.  
        Further, it is submitted that the exorcisms of the Church are
not always effective in the repression of devils in the matter of bodily
afflictions, since such are cured only at the discretion of God; but
they are effective always against those molestations of devils against
which they are chiefly instituted, as, for example, against men who are
possessed, or in the matter of exorcising children.  
        Again, it does not follow that, because the devil has been given
power over someone on account of his sins, that power must come to an
end on the cessation of the sin. For very often a man may cease from
sinning, but his sins still remain. So it seems from these sayings that
the two Doctors we have cited were of the opinion that it is unlawful to
remove a bewitchment, but that it must be suffered, just as it is
permitted by the Lord God, Who can remove it when it seems good to
Him.  
        Against this opinion it is argued that just as God and Nature do
not abound in superfluities, so also they are not deficient in
necessities; and it is a necessity that there should be given to the
faithful against such devils' work not only a means of protection (of
which we treat in the beginning of this Second Part), but also curative
remedies. For otherwise the faithful would not be sufficiently provided
for by God, and the works of the devil would seem to be stronger than
God's work.  
        Also there is the gloss on that text in *Job*. There is no power
on earth, etc. The gloss says that, although the devil has power over
all things human, he is nevertheless subject to the merits of the
Saints, and even to the merits of saintly men in this life.  
        Again, S. Augustine (*De moribus Ecclesiae*) says: No Angel is
more powerful than our mind, when we hold fast to God. For if power is a
virtue in this world, then the mind that keeps close to God is more
sublime than the whole world. Therefore such minds can undo the works of
the devil.  
        *Answer*. Here are two weighty opinions which, it seems, are at
complete variance with each other.  
        For there are certain Theologians and Canonists who agree that
it is lawful to remove witchcraft even by superstitious and vain means.
And of this opinion are Duns Scotus, Henry of Segusio, and Godfrey, and
all the Canonists. But it is the opinion of the other Theologians,
especially the ancient ones, and of some of the modern ones, such as S.
Thomas, S. Bonaventura, Blessed Albert, Peter a Palude, and many others,
that in no case must evil be done that good may result, and that a man
ought rather to die than consent to be cured by superstitious and vain
means.  
        Let us now examine their opinions, with a view to bringing them
as far as possible into agreement. Scotus, in his Fourth Book, dist. 34,
on obstructions and impotence caused by witchcraft, says that it is
foolish to maintain that it is unlawful to remove a bewitchment even by
superstitious and vain means, and that to do so is in no way contrary to
the Faith; for he who destroys the work of the devil is not an accessory
to such works, but believes that the devil has the power and inclination
to help in the infliction of an injury only so long as the outward token
or sign of that injury endures. Therefore when that token is destroyed
he puts an end to the injury. And he adds that it is meritorious to
destroy the works of the devil. But, as he speaks of tokens, we will
give an example.  
        There are women who discover a witch by the following token.
When a cow's supply of milk has been diminished by witchcraft, they hang
a pail of milk over the fire, and uttering certain superstitious words,
beat the pail with a stick. And though it is the pail that the women
beat, yet the devil carries all those blows to the back of the witch;
and in this way both the witch and the devil are made weary. But the
devil does this in order that he may lead on the woman who beats the
pail to worse practices. And so, if it were not for the risk which it
entails, there would be no difficulty in accepting the opinion of this
learned Doctor. Many other examples could be given.  
        Henry of Segusio, in his eloquent *Summa* on genital impotence
caused by witchcraft, says that in such cases recourse must be had to
the remedies of physicians; and although some of these remedies seem to
be vain and superstitious cantrips and charms, yet everyone must be
trusted in his own profession, and the Church may well tolerate the
suppression of vanities by means of others vanities.  
        Ubertinus also, in his Fourth Book, uses these words: A
bewitchment can be removed either by prayer or by the same art by which
it was inflicted.  
        Godfrey says in his *Summa:* A bewitchment cannot always be
removed by him who caused it, either because he is dead, or because he
does not know how to cure it, or because the necessary charm is lost.
But if he knows how to effect relief, it is lawful for him to cure it.
Our author is speaking against those who said that an obstruction of the
carnal act could not be caused by witchcraft, and that it could never be
permanent, and therefore did not annul a marriage already contracted.  
        Besides, those who maintained that no spell is permanent were
moved by the following reasons: they thought that every bewitchment
could be removed either by another magic spell, or by the exorcisms of
the Church which are ordained for the suppression of the devil's power,
or by true penitence, since the devil has power only over sinners. So in
the first respect they agree with the opinion of the others, namely,
that a spell can be removed by superstitious means.  
        But S. Thomas is of the contrary opinion when he says: If a
spell cannot be revoked except by some unlawful means, such as the
devil's help or anything of that sort, even if it is known that it can
be revoked in that way, it is nevertheless to be considered permanent;
for the remedy is not lawful.  
        Of the same opinion are S. Bonaventura, Peter a Palude, Blessed
Albert, and all the Theologians. For, touching briefly on the question
of invoking the help of the devil either tacitly or expressedly, they
seem to hold that such spells may only be removed by lawful exorcism or
true penitence (as is set down in the Canon Law concerning sortilege),
being moved, as it seems, by the considerations mentioned in the
beginning of this Question.  
        But it is expedient to bring these various opinions of the
learned Doctors as far as possible into agreement, and this can be done
in one respect. For this purpose it is to be noted that the methods by
which a spell of witchcraft can be removed are as follows: - either by
the agency of another witch and another spell; or without the agency of
a witch, but by means of magic and unlawful ceremonies. And this last
method may be divided into two; namely, the use of ceremonies which are
both unlawful and vain, or the use of ceremonies which are vain but not
unlawful.  
        The first remedy is altogether unlawful, in respect both of the
agent and of the remedy itself. But it may be accomplished in two ways;
either with some injury to him who worked the spell, or without an
injury, but with magic and unlawful ceremonies. In the latter case it
can be included with the second method, namely, that by which the spell
is removed not by the agency of a witch, but by magic and unlawful
ceremonies; and in this case it is still to be judged unlawful, though
not to the same extent as the first method.  
        We may summarize the position as follows. There are three
conditions by which a remedy is rendered unlawful. First, when a spell
is removed through the agency of another witch, and by further
witchcraft, that is, by the power of some devil. Secondly, when it is
not removed by a witch, but by some honest person, in such a way,
however, that the spell is by some magical remedy transferred from one
person to another; and this again is unlawful. Thirdly, when the spell
is removed without imposing it on another person, but some open or tacit
invocation of devils is used; and then again it is unlawful.  
        And it is with reference to these methods that the Theologians
say that it is better to die than to consent to them. But there are two
other methods by which, according to the Canonists, it is lawful, or not
idle and vain, to remove a spell; and that such methods may be used when
all the remedies of the Church, such as exorcisms and the prayers of the
Saints and true penitence, have been tried and have failed. But for a
clearer understanding of these remedies we will recount some examples
known to our experience.  
        In the time of Pope Nicolas there had come to Rome on some
business a certain Bishop from Germany, whom it is charitable not to
name although he had now paid the debt of all nature. There he fell in
love with a girl, and sent her to his diocese in charge of two servants
and certain other of his possessions, including some rich jewels, which
were indeed very valuable, and began to think in her heart that, if only
the Bishop were to die through some witchcraft, she would be able to
take possession of the rings, the pendants and carcanets. The next night
the Bishop suddenly fell ill, and the physicians and his servants
gravely suspected that he had been poisoned; for there was such a fire
in his breast that he had to take continual draughts of cold water to
assuage it. On the third day, when there seemed no hope of his life, an
old woman came and begged that she might see him. So they let her in,
and she promised the Bishop that she could heal him if he would agree to
her proposals. When the Bishop asked what it was to which he had to
agree in order to regain his health, as he so greatly desired, the old
woman answered: Your illness has ben caused by a spell of witchcraft,
and you can only be healed by another spell, which will transfer the
illness from you to the witch who caused it, so that she will die. The
Bishop was astounded; and seeing that he could be healed in no other
way, and not wishing to come to a rash decision, decided to ask the
advice of the Pope. Now the Holy Father loved him very dearly, and when
he learned that he could only be healed by the death of the witch, he
agreed to permit the lesser of two evils, and signed this permission
with his seal. So the old woman was again approached and told that both
he and the Pope had agreed to the death of the witch, on condition that
he was restored to his former health; and the old woman went away,
promising him that he would be healed on the following night. And
behold! when about the middle of the night he felt himself cured and
free from all illness, he sent a messenger to learn what had happened to
the girl; and he came back and reported that she had suddenly been taken
ill in the middle of the night while sleeping by her mother's side.  
        It is to be understood that at the very same hour and moment the
illness left the Bishop and afflicted the girl witch, through the agency
of the old witch; and so the evil spirit, by ceasing to plague the
Bishop, appeared to restore him to health by chance, whereas it was not
he but God who permitted him to afflict im, and it was God Who properly
speaking restored him; and the devil, by reason of his compact with the
second witch, who envied the fortune of the girl, has to afflict the
Bishop's mistress. And it must be thought that those two evil spells
were not worked by one devil serving two persons, but by two devils
serving two separate witches. For the devils do not work against
themselves, but work as much as possible in agreement for the perdition
of souls.
