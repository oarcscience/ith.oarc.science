# Malleus Maleficarum (1486)

### translated by Montague Summers \[1928\]

This is the best known (i.e., the most infamous) of the witch-hunt
manuals. Written in Latin, the Malleus was first submitted to the
University of Cologne on May 9th, 1487. The title is translated as "The
Hammer of Witches". Written by James Sprenger and Henry Kramer (of which
little is known), the Malleus remained in use for three hundred years.
It had tremendous influence in the witch trials in England and on the
continent. This translation is in the public domain.

The Malleus was used as a judicial case-book for the detection and
persecution of witches, specifying rules of evidence and the canonical
procedures by which suspected witches were tortured and put to death.
Thousands of people (primarily women) were judically murdered as a
result of the procedures described in this book, for no reason than a
strange birthmark, living alone, mental illness, cultivation of
medicinal herbs, or simply because they were falsely accused (often for
financial gain by the accuser). The Malleus serves as a horrible warning
about what happens when intolerence takes over a society.

Although the Malleus is manifestly a document which displays the
cruelty, barbarism, and ignorance of the Inquisition, it has also been
interpreted as evidence of a wide-spread subterranean pagan tradition
which worshiped a pre-Christian horned deity, particularly by [Margaret
Murray](../murray).
