&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It has been recognized even from the very earliest times, during the first 
gropings towards the essential conveniences of social decency and social 
order, that witchcraft is an evil thing, an enemy to light, an ally of the 
powers of darkness, disruption, and decay. Sometimes, no doubt, primitive 
communities were obliged to tolerate the witch and her works owing to fear; 
in other words, witchcraft was a kind of blackmail; but directly Cities were 
able to to co-ordinate, and it became possible for Society to protect itself, 
precautions were taken and safeguards were instituted against this curse, 
this bane whose object seemed to blight all that was fair, all that was just 
and good, and that was well-appointed and honourable, in a word, whose aim 
proved to be set up on high the red standard of revolution; to overwhelm 
religion, existing order, and the comeliness of life in an abyss of anarchy, 
nihilism, and despair. In his great treatise <I>De Ciutate Dei</I> S. 
Augustine set forth the theory, or rather the living fact, of the two Cities, 
the City of God, and the opposing stronghold of all that is not for God, 
that is to say, of all that is against Him.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
This seems to be a natural truth which the inspired Doctor has so eloquently 
demonstrated in his mighty pages, and even before the era of Christianity 
men recognized the verity, and nations who had never heard the Divine 
command put into practice the obligation of the Mosaic maxim: Thou shalt 
not suffer a witch to live. (Vulgate: Maleficos non patieris uiuere. Douay: 
Wizards thou shalt not suffer to live. <I>Exodus</I>, xxii, 18.)<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It is true that both in the Greek and in the earlier Roman cults, worships 
often directly derived from secret and sombre sources, ancient gods, or 
rather demons, had their awful superstitions and their horrid rites, powers 
whom men dreaded but out of very terror placated; fanes men loathed but 
within whose shadowed portals they bent and bowed the knee perforce in 
trembling fear. Such deities were the Thracian Bendis, whose manifestation 
was heralded by the howling of her fierce black hounds, and Hecate the 
terrible &#0147;QUeen of the realm of ghosts,&#0148; as Euripides calls her, 
and the vampire Mormo and the dark Summanus who at midnight hurled loud 
thunderbolts and launched the deadly levin through the starless sky. Pliny 
tells us that the worship of this mysterious deity lasted long, and dogs 
with their puppies were sacrificed to him with atrocious cruelty, but S. 
Augustine says that in his day &#0147;one could scarce find one within a 
while, that had heard, nay more, that had read so much as the name of 
Summanus&#0148; (<I>De Ciuitate Dei</I>, iv, 23). Nevertheless there is only 
too much reason to believe that this devil-god had his votaries, although 
his liturgy was driven underground and his supplicants were obliged to 
assemble in remote and secret places. Towards the end of the fifth century, 
the Carthaginian Martianus Capella boldly declares that Summanus is none 
other than the lord of Hell, and he was writing, it may be remembered, only 
a few years before the birth of S. Benedict; 
some think that he was still alive when the Father of All Monks was born.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Although in Greek States the prosecution of witches was rare, in large 
measure owing to the dread they inspired, yet cases were not unknown, for 
Theoris, a woman of Lemnos, who is denounced by Demosthenes, was publicly 
tried at Athens and burned for her necromancy. It is perhaps not impertinent 
to observe that many strange legends attached to the island of Lemnos, which 
is situated in the Aegaean Sea, nearly midway between Mt. Athos and the 
Hellespoint. It is one of the largest of the group, having an area of some 
147 square miles. Lemnos was sacred to Hephaestus, who is said to have fallen 
here when hurled by Zeus from Olympus. The 
workshops of the Smith-God in ancient legend were supposed to be on the 
island, although recent geologists deny that this area was ever volcanic, 
and the fires which are spoken of as issuing from it must be considered 
gaseous. Later the <I>officinae</I> of Hephaestus were placed in 
Sicily and the Lipari Islands, particularly 
Hiera.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The worship of Hephaestus in later days seems to have degenerated and to 
have been identified with some of the secret cults of the evil powers. This 
was probably due to his connexion with fire and also to his extreme ugliness, 
for he was frequently represented as a swarthy man of grim and forbidding 
aspect. It should further be noted that the old Italian deity Volcanus, with 
whom he was to be identified, is the god of destructive fire - fire 
considered in its rage and terror, as contrasted with fire which is a comfort 
to the human race, the kindly blaze on the hearth, domestic fire, presided 
over by the gracious lady Vesta. It is impossible not to think of the fall 
of Lucifer when one considers the legend of Hephaestus. Our Lord replied, 
when the disciples reported: Domine, etiam 
daemonia subiiciuntur nobis in nomine tuo (Lord, the devils also are 
subject to us in Thy Name), Uidebam Satanam sicut fulgur de coelo cadentem 
(I saw Satan like lightning falling from Heaven); and 
Isaias says: &#0147;Quomodo cecidisti de 
coelo, Lucifer, qui mane oriebaris? Corruisti in terram qui uulnerabas 
gentes?&#0148; (How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise 
in the morning? How art thou fallen to the earth, that didst wound the 
nations?) Milton also has the following poetic 
allusion:<P>

<UL>

Nor was his name unheard or unador'd<BR>
In Ancient <I>Greece;</I> and in <I>Ausonian</I> land<BR>
Men called him <I>Mulciber;</I> and how he fell<BR>
From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry <I>Jove</I><BR>
Sheer o'er the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn<BR>
To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,<BR>
A Summers day; and with the setting Sun<BR>
Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,<BR>
On <I>Lemnos</I> th' <I>&#0198;g&#0230;an</I> Ile: thus they relate,<BR>
Erring; for he with his rebellious rout<BR>
Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now<BR>
To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape<BR>
By all his Engins, but was headlong sent<BR>
With his industrious crew to build in hell.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Accordingly, during the years 319-21 a number of laws were passed which 
penalized and punished the craft of magic with the utmost severity. A pagan 
diviner or haruspex could only follow his vocation under very definite 
restrictions. He was not allowed to be an intimate visitor at the house of 
any citizen, for friendship with men of this kind must be avoided. &#0147;The 
haruspex who frequents the houses of others shall die at the stake,&#0148; 
such is the tenor of the code. It is hardly 
an exaggeration to say that almost every year saw a more rigid application 
of the laws; although even as to-day, when fortune-telling and peering into 
the future are forbidden by the Statute-Book, diviners and mediums abound, 
so then in spite of every prohibition astrologers, clairvoyants, and 
palmists had an enormous <I>client&#0232;le</I> of rich and poor alike. 
However, under Valens, owing to his discovery of the damning fact that 
certain prominent courtiers had endeavoured by means ot table-rapping to 
ascertain who should be his successor upon the throne, in the year 367 a 
regular crusade, which in its details recalls the heyday of Master Matthew 
Hopkins, was instituted against the whole race of magicians, soothsayers, 
mathematici, and theurgists, which perhaps was the first general prosecution 
during the Christian era. Large numbers of persons, including no doubt many 
innocent as well as guilty, were put to death, and a veritable panic swept 
through the Eastern world.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The early legal codes of most European nations contain laws directed against 
witchcraft. Thus, for example, the oldest document of Frankish legislation, 
the Salic Law (<I>Lex salica</I>), which was reduced to a written form and 
promulgated under Clovis, who died 27 November, 511, mulcts (sic) those who 
practise magic with various fines, especially when it could be proven that 
the accused launched a deadly curse, or had tied the Witch's Knot. This 
latter charm was usually a long cord tightly tied up in elaborate loops, 
among whose reticulations it was customary to insert the feathers of a black 
hen, a raven, or some other bird which had, or was presumed to have, no 
speck of white. This is one of the oldest instruments of witchcraft and is 
known in all countries and among all nations. It was put to various uses. 
The wizards of Finland, when they sold wind in the three knots of a rope. 
If the first knot were undone a gentle breeze sprang up; if the second, it 
blew a mackerel gale; if the third, a hurricane. 
But the Witch's Ladder, as it was often known, could be used with far more 
baleful effects. The knots were tied with certain horrid maledictions, and 
then the cord was hidden away in some secret place, and unless it were 
found and the strands released the person at whom the curse was directed 
would pine and die. This charm continually occurs during the trials. Thus 
in the celebrated Island-Magee case, March 1711, when a coven of witches was 
discovered, it was remarked that an apron belonging to Mary Dunbar, a visitor 
at the house of the afflicted persons, had been abstracted. Miss Dunbar was 
suddenly seized with fits and convulsions, and sickened almost to death. 
After most diligent search the missing garment was found carefully hidden 
away and covered over, and a curious string which had nine knots in it had 
been so tied up with the folds of the linen that it was beyond anything 
difficult to separate them and loosen the ligatures. In 1886 in the old 
belfry of a village church in England there were accidentally discovered, 
pushed away in a dark corner, several yards of incle braided with elaborate 
care and having a number of black feathers thrust through the strands. It is 
said that for a long while considerable wonder was caused as to what it 
might be, but when it was exhibited and became known, one of the local 
grandmothers recognized it was a Witch's Ladder, and, what is extremely 
significant, when it was engraved in the <I>Folk Lore Journal</I> an old 
Italian woman to whom the picture was shown immediately identified it as 
<I>la ghirlanda delle streghe</I>.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The laws of the Visigoths, which were to some extent founded upon the Roman 
law, punished witches who had killed any person by their spells with death; 
whilst long-continued and obstinate witchcraft, if fully proven, was visited 
with such severe sentences as slavery for life. In 578, when a son of Queen 
Fredegonde died, a number of witches who were accused of having contrived 
the destruction of the Prince were executed. It has been said in these 
matters that the ecclesiastical law was tolerant, since for the most part it 
contented itself with a sentence of excommunication. But those who consider 
this spiritual outlawry lenient certainly do not appreciate what such a doom 
entailed. Moreover, after a man had been condemned to death by the civil 
courts it would have been somewhat superfluous to have repeated the same 
sentence, and beyond the exercise of her spiritual weapons, what else was 
there left for the Church to do?<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In 814, Louis le Pieux upon his accession to the throne began to take very 
active measures against all sorcerers and necromancers, and it was owing to 
his influence and authority that the Council of Paris in 829 appealed to the 
secular courts to carry out any such sentences as the Bishops might 
pronounce. The consequence was that from this time forward the penalty of 
witchcraft was death, and there is evidence that if the constituted authority, 
either ecclesiastical or civil, seemed to slacken in their efforts the 
populace took the law into their own hands with far more fearful results.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In England the early Penitentials are greatly concerned with the repression 
of pagan ceremonies, which under the cover of Christian festivities were 
very largely practised at Christmas and on New Year's Day. These rites were 
closely connected with witchcraft, and especially do S. Theodore, S. Aldhelm, 
Ecgberht of York, and other prelates prohibit the masquerade as a horned 
animal, a stag, or a bull, which S. Caesarius of Arles had denounced as a 
&#0147;foul tradition,&#0148; an &#0147;evil custom,&#0148; a &#0147;most 
heinous abomination.&#0148; These and even stronger expressions would not be 
used unless some very dark and guilty secrets had been concealed beneath 
this mumming, which, however foolish, might perhaps have been thought to be 
nothing worse, so that to be so roundly denounced as devilish and demoniacal 
they must certainly have had some very grim signification which did not 
appear upon the surface. The laws of King Athelstan (924-40), corresponsive 
with the early French laws, punished any person casting a spell which 
resulted in death by extracting the extreme penalty. During the eleventh 
and twelfth centuries there are few cases of witchcraft in England, and such 
accusations as were made appeared to have been brought before the 
ecclesiastical court. It may be remarked, however, that among the laws 
attributed to King Kenneth I of Scotland, who ruled from 844 to 860, and 
under whom the Scots of Dalriada and the Pictish peoples may be said to have 
been united in one kingdom, is an important statute which enacts that all 
sorcerers and witches, and such as invoke spirits, &#0147;and use to seek 
upon them for helpe, let them be burned to death.&#0148; Even then this was 
obviously no new penalty, but the statutory confirmation of a long-established 
punishment. So the witches of Forres who attempted the life of King Duffus 
in the year 968 by the old bane of slowly melting a wax image, when discovered, 
were according to the law burned at the stake.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The conversion of Germany to Christianity was late and very slow, for as 
late as the eighth century, in spite of the heroic efforts of S. Columbanus, 
S. Fridolin, S. Gall, S. Rupert, S. Willibrod, the great S. Boniface, and 
many others, in spite of the headway that had been made, various districts 
were always relapsing into a primitive and savage heathenism. For example, 
it is probably true to say that the Prussian tribles were not stable in 
their conversion until the beginning of the thirteenth century, when Bishop 
Albrecht reclaimed the people by a crusade. However, throughout the eleventh 
and the twelfth centuries there are continual instances of persons who had 
practised witchcraft being put to death, and the Emperor Frederick II, in 
spite of the fact that he was continually quarrelling with the Papacy and 
utterly indifferent to any religious obligation - indeed it has been said 
that he was &#0147;a Christian ruler only in name,&#0148; and &#0147;throughout 
his reign he remained virtually a Moslem free-thinker&#0148; - declared that 
a law which he had enacted for Lombardy should have force throughout the 
whole of his dominions. &#0147;Henceforth,&#0148; Vacandard remarks, 
&#0147;all uncertainty was at an end. The legal punishment for heresy 
throughout the empire was death at the stake.&#0148; It must be borne in 
mind that witchcraft and heresy were almost inextricably commingled. It is 
quite plain that such a man as Frederick, whose whole philosophy was entirely 
Oriental; who was always accompanied by a retinue of Arabian ministers, 
courtiers, and officers; who was perhaps not without reason suspected of 
being a complete agnostic, recked little whether heresy and witchcraft might 
be offences against the Church or not, but he was sufficiently shrewd to see 
that they gravely threatened the well-being of the State, imperilling the 
maintenance of civilization and the foundations of society.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
This brief summary of early laws and ancient ordinances has been given in 
order to show that the punishment of witchcraft certainly did not originate 
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and most assuredly was not 
primarily the concern of the Inquisition. In fact, curiously enough, Bernard 
Gui, the famous Inquisitor of Toulouse, laid down in his 
<I>Practica Inquisitionis</I> that sorcery 
itself did not fall within the cognizance of the Holy Office, and in every 
case, unless there were other circumstances of which his tribunal was bound 
to take notice when witches came before him, he simply passed them on to the 
episcopal courts.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It may be well here very briefly to consider the somewhat complicated history 
of the establishment of the Inquisition, which was, it must be remembered, 
the result of the tendencies and growth of many years, by no mens a judicial 
curia with cut-and-dried laws and a compete procedure suddenly called into 
being by one stroke of a Papal pen. In the first place, S. Dominic was in 
no sense the founder of the Inquisition. Certainly during the crusade in 
Languedoc he was present, reviving religion and reconciling the lapsed, but 
he was doing no more than S. Paul or any of the Apostles would have done. 
The work of S. Dominic was preaching and the organization of his new Order, 
which received Papal confirmation from Honorius III, and was approved in the 
Bull <I>Religiosam uitam</I>, 22 December, 1216. S. Dominic died 6 August, 
1221, and even if we take the word in a very broad sense, the first Dominican 
Inquisitor seems to have been Alberic, who in November, 1232, was travelling 
through Lombardy with the official title of &#0147;Inquisitor hereticae 
prauitatis.&#0148; The whole question of the episcopal Inquisitors, who were 
really the local bishop, his archdeacons, and his diocesan court, and their 
exact relationship with the travelling Inquisitors, who were mainly drawn 
from the two Orders of friars, the Franciscan and the Dominican, is extremely 
nice and complicated; whilst the gradual effacement of the episcopal courts 
with regard to certain matters and the consequent prominence of the Holy 
Office were circumstances and conditions which realized themselves slowly 
enough in all countries, and almost imperceptibly in some districts, as 
necessity required, without any sudden break or sweeping changes. In fact we 
find that the Franciscan or Dominican Inquisitor simply sat as an assessor 
in the episcopal court so that he could be consulted upon certain 
technicalities and deliver sentence conjointly with the Bishop if these 
matters were involved. Thus at the trial of Gilles de Rais in October, 1440, 
at Nantes, the Bishop of Nantes presided over the court with the bishops of 
Le Mans, Saint-Brieuc, and Saint-Lo as his coadjutors, whilst Pierre de 
l&#0146;Hospital, Chencellor of Brittany, watched the case on behalf of the 
civil authorities, and Fr&#0232;re Jean Blouin was present as the delegate 
of the Holy Inquisition for the city and district of Nantes. Owing to the 
multiplicity of the crimes, which were proven and clearly confessed in 
accordance with legal requirements, it was necessary to pronounce two 
sentences. The first sentence was passed by the Bishop of Nantes conjointly 
with the Inquisitor. By them Gilles de Rais was declared guilty of Satanism, 
sorcery, and apostasy, and there and then handed over to the civil arm to 
receive the punishment due to such offences. The second sentence, pronounced 
by the Bishop alone, declared the prisoner convicted of sodomy, sacrilege, 
and violation of ecclesiastical rights. The ban of excommunication was 
lifted since the accused had made a clean breast of his crimes and desired 
to be reconciled, but he was handed over to the secular court, who sentenced 
him to death, on multiplied charges of murder as well as on account of the 
aforesaid offences.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It must be continually borne in mind also, and this is a fact which is very 
often slurred over and forgotten, that the heresies of the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries, to cope with which the tribunal of the Inquisition 
was primarily organized and regularized, were by no means mere theoretical 
speculations, which, however erroneous and dangerous in the fields of 
thought, practically and in action would have been arid and utterly 
unfruitful. To-day the word &#0147;heresy&#0148; seems to be as obsolete 
and as redolent of a Wardour-street vocabulary as if one were to talk of a 
game of cards at Crimp or Incertain, and to any save a dusty mediaevalist 
it would appear to be an antiquarian term. It was far other in the twelfth 
century; the wild fanatics who fostered the most subversive and abominable 
ideas aimed to put these into actual practice, to establish communities and 
to remodel whole territories according to the programme which they had so 
carefully considered in every detail with a view to obtaining and enforcing 
their own ends and their own interests. The heretics were just as resolute 
and just as practical, that is to say, just as determined to bring about the 
domination of their absolutism as is any revolutionary of to-day. The aim 
and objects of their leaders, Tanchelin, Everwacher, the Jew Manasses, Peter 
Waldo, Pierre Autier, Peter of Bruys, Arnold of Brescia, and the rest, were 
exactly those of Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, and their fellows. There were, 
of course, minor differences and divergences in their tenets, that is to say, 
some had sufficient cunning to conceal and even to deny the extremer views 
which other were bold enough or mad enough more openly to proclaim. But 
just below the trappings, a little way beneath the surface, their motives, 
their methods, their intentions, the goal to which they pressed, were all 
the same. Their objects may be summed up as the abolition of monarchy, the 
abolition of private property and of inheritance, the abolition of marriage, 
the abolition of order, the total abolition of all religion. It was against 
this that the Inquisition had to fight, and who can be surprised if, when 
faced with so vast a conspiracy, the methods employed by the Holy Office may 
not seem - if the terrible conditions are conveniently forgotten - a little 
drastic, a little severe? There can be no doubt that had this most excellent 
tribunal continued to enjoy its full prerogative and the full exercise of 
its salutary powers, the world at large would be in a far happier and far 
more orderly position to-day. Historians may point out diversities and 
dissimilarities between the teaching of the Waldenses, the Albigenses, the 
Henricans, the Poor Men of Lyons, the Cathari, the Vaudois, the Bogomiles, 
and the Manichees, but they were in reality branches and variants of the 
same dark fraternity, just as the Third International, the Anarchists, the 
Nihilists, and the Bolsheviks are in every sense, save the mere label, 
entirely identical.

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In fact heresy was one huge revolutionary body, exploiting its forces 
through a hundred different channels and having as its object chaos and 
corruption. The question may be asked - What was their ultimate aim in 
wishing to destroy civilization? What did they hope to gain by it? Precisely 
the same queries have been put and are put to-day with regard to these 
political parties. There is an apparent absence of motive in this seemingly 
aimless campaign of destruction to extermination carried on by the Bolsheviks 
in Russia, which has led many people to inquire what the objective can 
possibly be. So unbridled are the passions, so general the demolition, so 
terrible the havoc, that hard-headed individuals argue that so complete a 
chaos and such revolting outrages could only be affected by persons who were 
enthusiasts in their own cause and who had some very definite aims thus 
positively to pursue. The energizing forces of this fanaticism, this fervent 
zeal, do not seem to be any more apparent than the end, hence more than one 
person has hesitated to accept accounts so alarming of massacres and 
carnage, or wholesale imprisonments, tortures, and persecutions, and has 
begun to suspect that the situation may be grossly exaggerated in the 
overcharged reports of enemies and the highly-coloured gossip of scare-mongers. 
Nay, more, partisans have visited the country and returned with glowing 
tales of a new Utopia. It cannot be denied that all this is a very clever 
game. It is generally accepted that from very policy neither an individual 
nor a junto or confederacy will act even occasionally, much less continually 
and consistently, in a most bloody and tyrannical way, without some very 
well-arranged programme is being thus carried out and determinate aim ensued, 
conditions and object which in the present case it seems extremely difficult 
to guess at and divine unless we are to attribute the revolution to causes 
the modern mind is apt to dismiss with impatience and intolerance.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Nearly a century and a half ago Anacharsis Clootz, 
&#0147;the personal enemy of Jesus Christ&#0148; as he openly declared 
himself, was vociferating &#0147;God is Evil,&#0148; 
&#0147;To me then Lucifer, Satan! whoever you 
may be, the demon that the faith of my fathers opposed to God and the 
Church.&#0148; This is the credo of the witch.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Although it may not be generally recognized, upon a close investigation it 
seems plain that the witches were a vast political movement, an organized 
society which was anti-social and anarchichal, a world-wide plot against 
civilization. Naturally, although the Masters were often individuals of high 
rank and deep learning, that rank and file of the society, that is to say, 
those who for the most part fell into the hands of justice, were recruited 
from the least educated classes, the ignorant and the poor. As one might 
suppose, many of the branches or covens in remoter districts knew nothing 
and perhaps could have understood nothing of the enormous system. 
Nevertheless, as small cogs in a very small wheel, it might be, they were 
carrying on the work and actively helping to spread the infection. It is an 
extremely significant fact that the last regularly official trial and 
execution for witchcraft in Western Europe was that of Anna Goeldi, who was 
hanged at Glaris in Switzerland, 17 June, 1782. 
Seven years before, in 1775, the villian Adam Weishaupt, who has been truly 
described by Louis Blac as &#0147;the profoundest conspirator that has ever 
existed,&#0148; formed his &#0147;terrible and formidable sect,&#0148; the 
Illuminati. The code of this mysterious movement lays down: &#0147;it is 
also necessary to gain the common people (das gemeine Volk) to our Order. 
The great means to that end is influence in the schools.&#0148; This is 
exactly the method of the organizations of witches, and again and again do 
writers lament and bewail the endless activities of this sect amongst the 
young people and even the children of the district. So in the prosecutions 
at W&#0252;rzburg we find that there were condemned boys of ten and eleven, 
two choir boys aged twelve, &#0147;a boy of twelve years old in one of the 
lower forms of the school,&#0148; &#0147;the two young sons of the Prince's 
cook, the eldest fourteen, the younger twelve years old,&#0148; several 
pages and seminarists, as well as a number of young girls, amongst whom 
&#0147;a child of nine or ten years old and her little sister&#0148; were 
involved.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The political operations of the witches in many lands were at their trials 
exposed time after time, and these activities are often discernible even 
when they did not so publicly and prominently come to light. A very few 
cases, to which we must make but brief and inadequate reference, will stand 
for many. In England in the year 1324 no less than twenty-seven defendants 
were tried at the King's Bench for plotting against and endeavouring to kill 
Edward II, together with many prominent courtiers and officials, by the 
practice of magical arts. A number of wealthy citizens of Coventry had hired 
a famous &#0147;nigromauncer,&#0148; John of Nottingham, to slay not only 
the King, but also the royal favourite, Hugh le Despenser, and his father; 
the Prior of Coventry; the monastic steward; the manciple; and a number of 
other important personages. A secluded old manor-house, some two or three 
miles out of Coventry, was put at the disposal of Master John, and there he 
and his servant, Robert Marshall, promptly commenced business. They went to 
work in the bad old-fashioned way of modelling 
wax dolls or mommets of those whom they 
wished to destroy. Long pins were thrust through the figures, and they were 
slowly melted before a fire. The first unfortunate upon whom this experiment 
was tried, Richard de Sowe, a prominent courtier and close friend of the 
King, was suddenly taken with agonizing pains, and when Marshall visited 
the house, as if casually, in order that he might report the results of this 
sympathetic sorcery to the wizard, he found their hapless victim in a high 
delirium. When this state of things was promptly conveyed to him, Master 
John struck a pin through the heart of the image, and in the morning the 
news reached them that de Sowe had breathed his last. Marshall, who was by 
now in an extremity of terror, betook himself to a justice and laid bare all 
that was happening and had happened, with the immediate result that Master 
John and the gang of conspirators were arrested. It must be remembered that 
in 1324 the final rebellion against King Edward II had openly broken forth 
on all sides. A truce of thirteen years had been arranged with Scotland, 
and though the English might refuse Bruce his royal title he was 
henceforward the warrior king of an independent country. It is true that in 
May, 1322, the York Parliament had not only reversed the exile of the 
Despensers, declaring the pardons which had been granted their opponents 
null and void, as well as voting for the repeal of the Ordinances of 1311, 
and the Despensers were working for, and fully alive to the necessity of, 
good and stable government, but none the less the situation was something 
more than perilous; the Exchequer was well-nigh drained; there was rioting 
and bloodshed in almost every large town; and worst of all, in 1323 the 
younger Roger Mortimer had escaped from the Tower and got away safely to the 
Continent. There were French troubles to boot; Charles IV, who in 1322 had 
succeeded to the throne, would accept no excuse from Edward for any 
postponement of homage, and in this very year, 1324, declaring the English 
possessions forfeited, he proceeded to occupy the territory with an army, 
when it soon became part of the French dominion. There can be not doubt that 
the citizens of Coventry were political intriguers, and since they were at 
the moment unable openly to rebel against their sovran lord, taking 
advantage of the fact that he was harassed and pressed at so critical a 
juncture, they proceeded against him by the dark and tortuous ways of black 
magic.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Very many similar conspiracies in which sorcery was mixed up with treasonable 
practices and attempts might be cited, but only a few of the most important 
must be mentioned. Rather more than a century later than the reign of 
Edward II, in 1441, one of the greatest and most influential ladies in all 
England, &#0147;the Duchesse of Gloucestre, was arrested and put to holt, 
for she was suspecte of treson.&#0148; This, of course, was purely a 
political case, and the wife of Duke Humphrey had unfortunately by her 
indiscretion and something worse given her husband's enemies an opportunity 
to attack him by her ruin. An astrologer, attached to the Duke's household, 
when taken and charged with &#0147;werchyrye of sorcery against the King,&#0148; 
confessed that he had often cast the horoscope of the Duchess to find out if 
her husband would ever wear the English crown, the way to which they had 
attempted to smooth by making a wax image of Henry VI and melting it before 
a magic fire to bring about the King's decease. A whole crowd of witches, 
male and female, were involved in the case, and among these was Margery 
Jourdemain, a known a notorious invoker of demons and an old trafficker in 
evil charms. Eleanor Cobham was incontinently brought before a court 
presided over by three Bishops, London, Lincoln, and Norwich. She was found 
guilty both of high treason and sorcery, and after having been compelled to 
do public penance in the streets of London, she was imprisoned for life, 
according to the more authoritative account at 
Peel Castle in the Isle of Man. Her 
accomplices were executed at London.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In the days of Edward IV it was commonly gossiped that the Duchess of Bedford 
was a witch, who by her spells had fascinated 
the King with the beauty of her daughter Elizabeth, whom he made his 
bride, in spite of the fact that he had plighted his troth to Eleanor Butler, 
the heiress of the Earl of Shrewsbury. So open did the scandal become that 
the Duchess of Bedford lodged an official complaint with the Privy Council, 
and an inquiry was ordered, but, as might have been suscepted, this 
completely cleared the lady. Nevertheless, five years later the charges were 
renewed by the Lord Protector, the Duke of Gloucester. Nor was this the 
first time in English history that some fair dame was said to have fascinated 
a monarch, not only by her beauty but also by unlawful means. When the 
so-called &#0147;Good Parliament&#0148; was convened in April, 1376, their 
first business seemed to be to attack the royal favourite, Alice Perrers, 
and amongst the multiplicity of charges which they brought against her, not 
the least deadly was the accusation of witchcraft. Her ascendancy over the 
King was attributed to the enchantments and experiments of a Dominican friar, 
learned in many a cantrip and cabala, whom she entertained in her house, and 
who had fashioned two pictures of Edward and Alive which, when suffumigated 
with the incense of mysterious herbs and gums, mandrakes, sweet calamus, 
caryophylleae, storax, benzoin, and other plants plucked beneath the full 
moon what time Venus was in ascendant, caused the old King to dote upon this 
lovely concubine. With great difficulty by a subtle ruse the friar was 
arrested, and he thought himself lucky to escape with relegation to a remote 
house under the strictest observance of his Order, whence, however, he was 
soon to be recalled with honour and reward, since the Good Parliament shortly 
came to an end, and Alice Perrers, who now stood higher in favour than ever, 
was not slow to heap lavish gifts upon her supporters, and to visit her 
enemies with condign punishment.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It is often forgotten that in the troublous days of Henry VIII the whole 
country swarmed with astrologers and sorcerers, to whom high and low alike 
made constant resort. The King himself, a prey to the idlest superstitions, 
ever lent a credulous ear to the most foolish prophecies and old wives' 
abracadabra. When, as so speedily happened, he wearied of Anne Boleyn, he 
openly gave it as his opinion that he had &#0147;made this marriage seduced 
by witchcraft; and that this was evident because God did not permit them to 
have any male issue.&#0148;<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
There was nobody more thoroughly scared of witchcraft than Henry's daughter, 
Elizabeth, and as John Jewel was preaching his famous sermon before her in 
February, 1560, he described at length how 
&#0147;this kind of people (I mean witches and sorcerers) within these few 
last years are marvellously increased within this Your Grace's realm;&#0148; 
he then related how owing to dark spells he had known many &#0147;pine away 
even to death.&#0148; &#0147;I pray God,&#0148; he unctuously cried, &#0147;they 
may never practise further than upon the subjects!&#0148; This was certainly 
enough to ensure that drastic laws should be passed particularly to protect 
the Queen, who was probably both thrilled and complimented to think that her 
life was in danger. It is exceedingly doubtful, whether there was any 
conspiracy at all which would have attempted Elizabeth's personal safety. 
There were, of course, during the imprisonment of the Queen of Scots, designs 
to liberate this unfortunate Princess, and Walsingham with his fellows used 
to tickle the vanity of Gloriana be regaling her with melodramatic accounts 
of dark schemes and secret machinations which they had, with a very shrewd 
knowledge of stagecraft, for the most part themselves arranged and contrived, 
so we may regard the Act of 1581, 23 Eliz., Cap. II, as mere finesse and 
chicane. That there were witches in England is very certain, but there seems 
no evidence at all that there were attempts upon the life of Elizabeth. None 
the less the point is important, since it shows that in men's minds sorcery 
was inexplicably mixed up with politics. The statute runs as follows: 
&#0147;That if any person . . . during the life of our said Sovereign Lady 
the Queen's Majesty that now is, either within her Highness' dominions or 
without, shall be setting or erecting any figure or by casting of nativities 
or by calculation or by any prophesying, witchcraft, conjurations, or other 
like unlawful means whatsoever, seek to know, and shall set forth by express 
words, deeds, or writings, how long her Majesty shall live, or who shall 
reign a king or queen of this realm of England after her Highness' decease . . . 
that then every such offence shall be felony, and every offender therein, 
and also all his aiders (etc.), shall be judged as felons and shall suffer 
pain of death and forfeit as in case of felony is used, without any benefit 
of clergy or sanctuary.&#0148;<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 


<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The famous Scotch witch trial or 1590, when it was proved that upon 31 
October in the preceding year, All Hallow E'en, a gang of more than two 
hundred persons had assembled for their rites at the old haunted church of 
North Berwick, where they consulted with their Master, &#0147the Devil,&#0148; 
how they might most efficaciously kill King James, is too well known to 
require more than a passing mention, but it may be remembered that Agnes 
Sampson confessed that she had endeavoured to poison the King in various 
ways, and that she was also avowed that she had fashioned a wax mommet, 
saying with certain horrid maledictions as she wrought the work: &#0147;This 
is King James the sext, ordinit to be consumed at the instance of a noble 
man Francis Erle of Bodowell.&#0148; The contriver of this far-reaching 
conspiracy was indeed none other than Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, 
who, as common knowledge bruited, almost overtly aspired to the throne and 
was perfectly reckless how he compassed his ends. It was he, no doubt, who 
figured as &#0147;the Devil&#0148 at the meeting in the deserted and 
ill-omened kirkyard. In fact this is almost conclusively shown by a statement 
of Barbara Napier when she was interrogated with regard to their objects in 
the attempted murder of the King. She gave as her reason &#0147;that another 
might have ruled in his Majesty's place, and the Government might have gone 
to the Devil.&#0148; That is to say, to Francis Bothwell. The birth of 
Prince Henry at Stirling, 19 February, 1594, and further of Prince Charles 
at Dunfermline, 19 November, 1600, must have dashed all Bothwell's hopes to 
the ground. Moreover, the vast organization of revolutionaries and witches 
had been completely broken up, and accordingly there was nothing left for 
him to do but to seek safety in some distant land. There is an extremely 
significant reference to him in Sandys, who, 
speaking of Calabria in the year 1610, writes: &#0147;Here a certaine 
<I>Calabrian</I> hearing that I was an <I>English</I> man, came to me, and 
would needs persuade me that I had insight in magicke: for the Earl 
<I>Bothel</I> was my countryman, who liues at <I>Naples</I>, and is in these 
parts famous for suspected negromancie.&#0148;<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In French history even more notorious than the case of the Berwick witches 
were the shocking scandals involving both poisoning and witchcraft that came 
to light and were being investigated in 1679-82. At least two hundred and 
fifty persons, of whom many were the representatives and scions of the 
highest houses in the land, were deeply implicated in these abominations, 
and it is no matter for surprise that a vast number of the reports and 
several entire dossiers and registers have completely disappeared. The 
central figures were the Abb&#0233; Guibourg and Catherine Deshayes, more 
generally known as La Voisin, whose house in the Rue Beauregard was for 
years the rendezvous of a host of inquirers drawn from all classes of 
societym from palaces and prisons, from the lowest slums of the vilest 
underworld. That it was a huge and far-reaching political conspiracy is 
patent form the fact that the lives of Louis XIV, the Queen, the Dauphin, 
Louise de la Valli&#0232;re, and the Duchesse de Fontanges had been 
attempted secretly again and again, whilst as for Colbert, scores of his 
enemies were constantly entreating for some swift sure poison, constantly 
participating in unhallowed rites which might lay low the all-powerful 
Minister. It soon came to light that Madame de Montespan and the Comtesse 
de Soisson (Olympe Mancini) were both deeply implicated, whilst the 
Comtesse de Rouse and Madame de Polignac in particular, coveting a lodging 
in the bed royal, had persistently sought to bring about the death of Louise 
de la Valli&#0232;re. It is curious indeed to recognize the author of <I>The 
Rehearsal</I> in this train, but there flits in and out among the witches 
and anarchists a figure who can almost certainly be identified with George 
Villiers, Duke of Buckingham. Yet this is the less surprising when we 
remember how very nearly he stirred up a mutiny, if not an insurrection, 
against the King who had so particularly favoured and honoured him, but who, 
in the words of a contemporary, &#0147;knew him to be capable of the blackest 
designs.&#0148; Of Buckingham it has been 
written without exaggeration: 
&#0147;As to his personal character it is impossible to say anything in its 
vindication; for though his severest enemies acknowledge him to have 
possessed great vivacity and a quickness of parts peculiarly adapted to the 
purposes of ridicule, yet his warmest advocates have never attributed to him 
a single virtue. His generosity was profuseness, his wit malevolence, the 
gratification of his passions his sole aim through life.&#0148; When we 
consider the alliance of Buckingham with the infamous Shaftesbury, we need 
hardly wonder that whilst in Paris he frequented the haunts of this terrible 
society, and was present at, nay, even participated in the Satanic mass and 
other of their horrible mysteries. At the house of La Voisin necromancy was 
continually practised, poisons were brewed, the liturgy of hell was 
celebrated, and it was undoubtedly the hub of every crime and ever infamy. 
Other instances, and not a few, might be quoted from French history to show 
how intimately politics were connected with witchcraft. Here Madame de 
Montespan, aiming at the French throne, an ambition which involved the death 
of the Queen, Maria Theresa of Austria, at once resorts to black magic, and 
attempts to effect her purpose by aid of those who were infamous as past 
adepts in this horrid craft.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Even in the Papal States themselves such abominations were not unknown, and 
in 1633 Rome was alarmed and confounded by an attempt upon the life of Urban 
VIII. It seems that some charlatan had announced to Giacinto Centini, nephew 
of the Cardinal d&#0146;Ascoli, that his uncle would succeed the reigning 
Pontiff in the Chair of S. Peter. The rash and foolish young man promptly 
attempted to hasten the event, and did not hesitate to resort to certain 
professors of occult arts to inquire when the next conclave would take place. 
He was so incredibly foolish that, far from attempting any subterfuge or 
disguise, he seems to have resorted to the houses of astrologers and other 
persons, who were already suspected of necromancy in the most open way, and 
further to have boasted among his intimates of the high honours which he 
expected his family would shortly enjoy. He first applied to one Fra Pietro, 
a Sicilian, who belonged to the Order of Augustinian Eremites. This occultist 
told him that the Cardinal d&#0146;Ascoli would be elected at the next 
conclave, but that the present Pope had many years to live. Upon seeing the 
young man's bitter disappointment the cunning mage whispered that it was in 
his power to bring about the event much sooner than it would happen in the 
ordinary course of affairs. Needless to say, the proposition was taken up with 
alacrity, but it was necessary to employ the services of two other diviners, 
and they accordingly selected for the task Fra Cherubino of Ancona, a 
Franciscan, and Fra Domenico of the Eremite monastery of S. Agostino at 
Fermo. The friars then deligently set to work to carry out their murderous 
projects. A number of ceremonies and incantations were performed which 
entailed considerable expense, and for which it was needful to procure exotic 
herbs and drugs and rare instruments of goetry that could not readily be had 
without attracting considerable curiosity. It appeared, however, as if all 
their charms and spells, their demoniac eucharists and litanies, were quite 
ineffective, since Urban at sixty-five years of age remained perfectly hale 
and hearty and was indeed extraordinarily active in his pontificate. Young 
Centini became manifestly impatient and spurred the wizards on to greater 
efforts. It really seems as if, vexed beyond measure and goaded to 
exasperation by his importunities, they flung all caution to the winds, 
whilst he himself proclaimed so magnificently what he would do for his 
friends in a few weeks or months after he had assumed the authority of Papal 
nephew, that it was hardly a matter of surprise when the Holy Office 
suddenly descended upon the four accomplices and brought them to the bar. 
Amongst the many charges which were put forward was one of causing &#0147;a 
statue of wax to be made of Urban VIII, in order that its dissolution might 
ensure that of the Pope.&#0148; This in itself would have been sufficiently 
damning, but there were many other criminal accounts all tending to the 
same end, all proven up to the hilt. The result was that Centini, Fra Pietro, 
and Fra Cherubino were executed in the Campo di Fiore, on Sunday, 22 April, 
1634, whilst Fra Domenico, who was less desperately involved, was relegated 
for life to the galleys.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
These few instances I have dwelt upon in detail and at some length in order 
to show how constantly and continually in various countries and at various 
times witchcraft and magical practices were mixed up with political plots 
and anarchical agitation. There can be no doubt - and this is a fact which 
is so often not recognized (or it may be forgotten) that one cannot emphasize 
it too frequently - that witchcraft in its myriad aspects and myriad 
ramifications is a huge conspiracy against civilization. It was as such that 
the Inquisitors knew it, and it was this which gave rise to the extensive 
literature on the subject, those treatises of which the <I>Malleus 
Maleficarum</I> is perhaps the best known among the other writers. As early 
as 600 S. Gregory I had spoken in severest 
terms, enjoining the punishment of sorcerers and those who trafficked in 
black magic. It will be noted that he speaks of them as more often belonging 
to that class termed <I>serui</I>, that is to say, the very people from whom 
for the most part Nihilists and Bolsheviks have sprung in modern days. 
Writing to Januarius, Biship of Cagliari, the Pope says: &#0147;Contra 
idolorum cultores, uel aruspices atque sortilegos, fraternitatem uestram 
uehementius pastorali hortamur inuigilare custodia . . . et si quidem serui 
sunt, uerberibus cruciatibusque, quibus ad emendationem peruenire ualeant, 
castigare si uero sunt liberi, inclusione digna districtaque sunt in 
poenitentiam redigendi. . . .&#0148; But the first Papal ordinance directly 
dealing with witchcraft may not unfairly be said to be the Bull addressed in 
1233 by Pope Gregory IX (Ugolino, Count of 
Segni) to the famous Conrad of Marburg, bidding him proceed against the 
Luciferians, who were overtly given over to Satanism. If this ardent 
Dominican must not strictly be considered as having introduced the Inquisition 
to Germany, he at any rate enjoyed Inquisitorial methods. Generally, perhaps, 
he is best known as the stern and unbending spiritual director of that gentle 
soul S. Elizabeth of Hungary. Conrad of Marburg is certainly a type of the 
strictest and most austere judge, but it should be remembered that he spared 
himself no more than he spared others, that he was swayed by no fear of 
persons of danger of death, that even if he were inflexible and perhaps 
fanatical, the terrible situation with which he had to deal demanded such a 
man, and he was throughout supported by the supreme authority of Gregory IX. 
That he was harsh and unlovable is, perhaps, true enough, but it is more 
than doubtful whether a man of gentler disposition could have faced the 
difficulties that presented themselves on every side. Even his most 
prejudiced critics have never denied the singleness of his convictions and 
his courage. He was murdered on the highway, 30 July, 1233, in the pursuit 
of his duties, but it has been well said that &#0147;it is, perhaps, 
significant that the Church has never set the 
seal of canonization upon his martyrdom.&#0148;<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
On 13, December, 1258, Pope Alexander IV (Rinaldo 
Conti) issued a Bull to the Franciscan Inquisitors bidding them refrain 
from judging any cases of witchcraft unless there was some very strong 
reason to suppose that heretical practice could also be amply proved. On 10 
January, 1260, the same Pontiff addressed a similar Bull to the Dominicans. 
But it is clear that by now the two things could not be disentangled.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The Bull <I>Dudum ad audientiam nostram peruenit</I> of Boniface VIII 
(Benedetto Gaetani) deals with the charges 
against Walter Langton, Bishop of Conventry 
and Lichfield, but it may be classed as individual rather than general.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Several Bulls were published by John XXII (Jacques 
d&#0146;Euse) and by Benedict XII (Jacques 
Fournier, O. Cist), both Avignon Popes, and these weighty documents 
deal with witchcraft in the fullest detail, anathematizing all such 
abominations. Gregory XI (Pierre Roger de 
Beaufort); Alexander V (Petros Filartis, a Cretan), who ruled but 
eleven months, from June 1409 to May 1410; and 
Martin V (Ottone Colonna); each put forth 
one Bull on the subject. To Eugenius IV (Gabriello 
Condulmaro) we owe four Bulls which fulminate against sorcery and black 
magic. The first of these, 24 February, 1434, is addressed from Florence to 
the Franciscan Inquisitor, Pontius Fougeyron. On 1 August, 1451, the 
Dominican Inquisitor Hugo Niger received a Bull from Nicholas V 
(Tomaso Parentucelli). Callistus III 
(Alfonso de Borja) and Pius II 
(Enea Silvio de&#0146; Piccolomini) each 
issued one Bull denouncing the necromantic crew.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
On 9 August, 1471, the Franciscan friar, Francesco della Rovere, ascended 
the throne of Peter as Sixtus IV. His Pontificate has been severely 
criticized by those who forget that the Pope was a temporal Prince and in 
justice bound to defend his territory against the continual aggression of 
the Italian despots. His private life was blameless, and the stories which 
were circulated by such writers as Stefano Infessura in his 
<I>Diarium</I> are entirely without 
foundation. Sixtus was an eminent theologian, he is the author of an 
admirable treatise on the Immaculate Conception, and it is significant that 
he took strong measures to curb the judicial severities of Tom&#0224;s de 
Torquemada, whom he had appointed Grand Inquisitor of Castile, 11 February, 
1482. During his reign he published three Bulls directly attacking sorcery, 
which he clearly identified with heresy, an opinion of the deepest weight 
when pronounced by one who had so penetrating a knowledge of the political 
currents of the day. There can be no doubt that he saw the society of witches 
to be nothing else than a vast international of anti-social revolutionaries. 
The first Bull is dated 17 June, 1473; the second 1 April. 1478; and the 
last 21 October, 1483.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It has been necessarily thus briefly to review this important series of 
Papal documents to show that the famous Bull <I>Summis desiderantes 
affectibus</I>, 9 December, 1484, which Innocent VIII addressed to the 
authors of the <I>Malleus Maleficarum</I>, is no isolated and extraordinary 
document, but merely one in the long and important record of Papal 
utterances. although at the same time it is of the greatest importance and 
supremely authoritative. It has, however, been very frequently asserted, not 
only be prejudiced and unscrupulous chroniclers, but also by scholars of 
standing and repute, that this Bull of Innocent VIII, if not, as many appear 
to suppose, actually the prime cause and origin of the crusade against 
witches, at any rate gave the prosecution and energizing power and an 
authority which hitherto they had not, and which save for this Bull they 
could not ever have, commanded and possessed.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It will not be impertinent then here very briefly to inquire what authority 
Papal Bulls may be considered to enjoy in general, and what weight was, and 
is, carried by this particular document of 9 December, 1484.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
To enter into a history of Bulls and Briefs would require a long and 
elaborate monograph, so we must be content to remind ourselves that the term 
<I>bulla</I>, which in classical Latin meant a water-bubble, a 
bubble then came to mean a boss of metal, 
such as the knob upon a door. (By 
transference it also implied a certain kind of amulet, generally made of 
gold, which was worn upon the neck, especially by noble youths). Hence in 
course of time the word <I>bulla</I> indicated the leaden seals by which 
Papal (and even royal) documents were authenticated, and by an easy 
transition we recognize that towards the end of the twelfth century a Bull 
is the document itself. Naturally very many kinds of edicts are issued from 
the Cancellaria, but a Bull is an instrument of especial weight and 
importance, and it differs both in form and detail from constitutions, 
encyclicals, briefs, decrees, privileges, and rescripts. It should be 
remarked, however, that the term Bull has conveniently been used to denote 
all these, especially if they are Papal letters of any early date. By the 
fifteenth century clearer distinctions were insisted upon and maintained.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
A Bull was written in Latin and as late as the death of Pope Pius IX, 1878, 
the <I>scrittura bollatica</I>, an archaic and difficult type of Gothic 
characters much contracted and wholly unpunctuated was employed. This 
proved often well-nigh indecipherable to those who were not trained to the 
script, and accordingly there accompanied the Bull a <I>transsumptum</I> in 
an ordinary plain hand. The seal, appended by red and yellow (sometimes 
white) laces, generally bore on one side the figures of SS. Peter and Paul; 
on the other a medallion or the name of the reigning Pontiff.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
A Bull begins thus: &#0147;N. Episcopus Seruus seruorum Dei ad perpetuam 
rei memoriam.&#0148; It is dated &#0147;Anno incarnationis Domini,&#0148; 
and also &#0147;Pontificatus Nostri anno primo (uel secundom, tertio, etc.).&#0148; 
Those Bulls which set forth and define some particular statement will be 
found to add certain minatory clauses directed against those who obstinately 
refuse to accept the Papal decision.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It should be remembered that, as has already been said, the famous Bull of 
Pope Innocent VIII is only one in a long line of Apostolic Letters dealing 
with the subject of witchcraft.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
On 18 June, 1485, the Pontiff again recommended the two Inquisitors to 
Berthold, Archbishop of Mainz, in a Bull <I>Pro causa fidei;</I> upon the 
same date a similar Bull was sent to the Archduke Sigismund, and a Brief to 
Abbot John of Wingarten, who is highly praised for his devotion and zeal. On 
30 September, 1486, a Bull addressed to the Bishop of Brescia and to Antonio 
di Brescia, O.P., Inquisitor for Lombardy, emphasizes the close connexion, 
nay, the identity of witchcraft with heresy.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Alexander VI published two Bulls upon the same theme, and in a Bull of 
Julius II there is a solemn description of that abomination the Black Mass, 
which is perhaps the central feature of the worship of Satanists, and which 
is unhappily yet celebrated to-day in Londin, in Paris, in Berlin, and in 
many another great city.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Leo X, the great Pope of Humanism, issued on Bull on the subject; but even 
more important is the Bull <I>Dudum uti nobis exponi fecisti</I>, 20 July, 
1523, which speaks of the horrible abuse of the Sacrament in sorceries and 
the charms confuted by witches.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
We have two briefs of Clement VII; and on 5 January, 1586, was published 
that long and weighty Constitution of Sixtus V, <I>Coeli et Terrae Creator 
Deus</I>, which denounces all those who are devoted to Judicial Astrology 
and kindred arts that are envenomed with black magic and goetry. There is a 
Constitution of Gregory XV, <I>Omnipotentis Dei</I>, 20 March, 1623; and a 
Constitution of Urban VIII, <I>Inscrutabilis iudiciorum Dei altitudo</I>, 
1 April, 1631, which - if we except the recent 
condemnation of Spiritism in the nineteenth 
century - may be said to be the last 
Apostolic document directed against these foul and devilish practices.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
We may now consider the exact force of the Apostolic Bull <I>Summis 
desiderantes affectibus</I> issed on 9 December, 1484, by Innocent VIII to 
Fr. Henry Kramer and Fr. James Sprenger.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In the first place, it is superflous to say that no Bull would have been 
published without the utmost deliberation, long considering of phrases, and 
above all earnest prayer. This document of Pope Innocent commences with the 
set grave formula of a Bull of the greatest weight and solemnity. 
&#0147;Innocentius Episcopus Seruus seruorum Dei ad perpetuam rei memoriam.&#0148; 
It draws to its conclusion with no brief and succinct prohibitory clauses 
but with a solemn measured period: &#0147;Non obstantibus praemissis ac 
constitutionibus et ordinationibus Apostolicis contrariis quibuscunque. . . .&#0148; 
The noble and momentous sentences are built up word by word, beat by beat, 
ever growing more and more authoritative, more and more judicial, until they 
culminate in the minatory and imprecatory clauses which are so impressive, 
so definite, that no loophole is left for escape, no turn for evasion. 
&#0147;Nulli ergo omnino hominum liceat hanc paganim nostrae declarationis 
extentionis concessionis et mandati infringere uel ei ausu temeraris 
contrarie Si qui autem attentate praesumpserit indignationem omnipotentis 
Dei ac beatorum Petri et Pauli Apostolorum eius se nouerit incursurum.&#0148; 
If any man shall presume to go against the tenor let him know that therein 
he will bring down upon himself the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed 
Apostles Peter and Paul.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Could words weightier be found?<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Are we then to class this Bull with the Bulla dogmatica <I>Ineffabilis Deus</I> 
wherein Pope Pius IX proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception? Such 
a position is clearly tenable, but even if we do not insist that the Bull of 
Innocent VIII is an infallible utterance, since the <I>Summis desiderantes 
affectibus</I> does not in set terms define a dogma although it does set 
forth sure and certain truths, it must at the very least be held to be a 
document of supreme and absolute authority, of 
dogmatic force. It belongs to that class 
of <I>ex cathedra</I> utterances &#0147;for which infallibility is claimed 
on the ground, not indeed of the terms of the Vatican definition, but of 
the constant practice of the Holy See, the consentient teaching of the 
theologians, as well as the clearest deductions of the principles of faith.&#0148; 
Accordingly the opinion of a person who rashly impugns this Bull is 
manifestly to be gravely censures as <I>erronea, sapiens haeresim, captiosa, 
subuersiua hierarchiae;</I> erroneous, savouring of heresy, captious, 
subversive of the hierarchy.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Without exception non-Catholic historians have either in no measured 
language denounced or else with sorrow deplored the Bull of Innocent VIII as 
a most pernicious and unhappy document, a perpetual and irrevocable manifesto 
of the unchanged and unchangeable mind of the Papacy. From this point of 
view they are entirely justified, and their attitude is undeniably logical 
and right. The <I>Summis desideranted affectibus</I> is either a dogmatic 
exposition by Christ's Vicar upon earth or it is altogether abominable.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Hansen, either in honest error or of intent, willfully misleads when he 
writes, &#0147;it is perfectly obvious that 
the Bull pronounces no dogmatic decision.&#0148; As has been pointed out, 
in one very narrow and technical sense this may be correct - yet even here 
the opposite is arguable and probably true - but such a statement thrown 
forth without qualification is calculated to create, and undoubtedly does 
create, an entirely false impression. It is all the more amazing to find 
that the writer of the article upon &#0147;Witchcraft&#0148; in the 
<I>Catholic Encyclopaedia</I> quotes Hansen 
with complete approval and gleefully adds with regard to the Bull of Innocent 
VIII, &#0147;neither does the form suggest that the Pope wishes to bind 
anyone to believe more about the reality of witchcraft than is involved in 
the utterances of Holy Scripture,&#0148; a statement which is essentially 
Protestant in its nature, and, as is acknowledged by every historian of 
whatsoever colour or creed, entirely untrue. By its appearance in a standard 
work of reference, which is on the shelves of every library, this article 
upon &#0147;Witchcraft&#0148; acquires a certain title to consideration 
which upon its merits it might otherwise lack. It is signed Herbert Thurston, 
and turning to the list of &#0147;Contributors to the Fifteenth Volume&#0148; 
we duly see &#0147;Thurston, Herbert, S.J., London.&#0148; Since a Jesuit 
Father emphasizes in a well-known (and presumably authoritative) Catholic 
work an opinion so derogatory to the Holy See and so definitely opposed to 
all historians, one is entitled to express curiosity concerning other writings 
which may not have come from his pen. I find that for a considerable number 
of years Fr. Thurston has been contributing to <I>The Month</I> a series of 
articles upon mystical phenomena and upon various aspects of mysticism, such 
as the Incorruption of the bodies of Saints and Beati, the Stigmata, the 
Prophecies of holy persons, the miracles of Crucifixes that bleed or 
pictures of the Madonna which move, famous Sanctuaries, the inner life of and 
wonderful events connected with persons still living who have acquired a 
reputation for sanctity. This busy writer directly or incidentally has dealt 
with that famous ecstatica Anne Catherine 
Emmerich; the Crucifix of Limpias; Our Lady of Campocavallo; S. Januarus; 
the Ven. Maria d&#0146;Agreda; Gemma Galgani; Padre Pio Pietralcina; that 
gentle soul Teresa Higginson, the beauty of whose life has attracted 
thousands, but whom Fr. Thurston considers hysterical and masochistic and 
whose devotions to him savour of the &#0147;snowball&#0148; prayer; Pope 
Alexander VI; the origin of the Rosary; the Carmelite scapular; and very 
many themes beside. Here was have a mass of material, and even a casual 
glance through these pages will suffice to show the ugly prejudice which 
informs the whole. The intimate discussions on miracles, spiritual graces 
and physical phenomena, which above all require faith, reverence, sympathy, 
tact and understanding, are conducted with a roughness and a rudeness 
infinitely regrettable. What is worse, in every case Catholic tradition and 
loyal Catholic feeling are thrust to one side; the note of scepticism, of 
modernism, and even of rationalism is arrogantly dominant. Tender miracles 
of healing wrought at some old sanctuary, the records of some hidden life 
of holiness secretly lived amongst us in the cloister or the home, these 
things seem to provoke Fr. Thurston to such a pitch of annoyance that he 
cannot refrain from venting his utmost spleen. The obsession is certainly 
morbid. It is reasonable to suppose that a lengthy series of papers all 
concentrating upon certain aspects of mysticism would have collected in one 
volume, and it is extremely significant that in the autumn of 1923 a leading 
house announced among Forthcoming Books: &#0147;The Physical Phenomena of 
Mysticism. By the Rev. Herbert Thurston, S.J.&#0148; Although in active 
preparation, this has never seen the light. I have heard upon good authority 
that the ecclesiastical superiors took exception to such a publication. I 
may, of course, be wrong, and there can be no question that there is room 
for a different point of view, but I cannot divest my mind of the idea that 
the exaggerated rationalization of mystical phenomena conspicuous in the 
series of articles I have just considered may be by no means unwelcome to 
the Father of Lies. It really plays into his hands: first, because it makes 
the Church ridiculous by creating the impression that her mystics, 
particularly friars and nuns, are for the most part sickly hysterical 
subjects, deceivers and deceived, who would be fit inmates of Bedlam; that 
many of her most reverend shrines, Limpias, 
Campocavallo, and the sanctuaries of Naples, are frauds and conscious 
imposture; and, secondly, because it condemns and brings into 
ridicule that 
note of holiness which theologians declare is one of the distinctive marks 
of the true Church.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
There is also evil speaking of dignities. In 1924 the Right Rev. Mgr. 
Oeter de Roo published an historical work in five volumes, <I>Materials for 
a History of Pope Alexander VI, his Relatives and his Time</I>, wherein he 
demonstrates his thesis that Pope Alexander VI was &#0147;a man of good moral 
character and an excellent Pope.&#0148; This is quite enough for Fr. 
Thurston to assail him in the most vulgar and 
ill-bred way. The historian is a &#0147;crank,&#0148; &#0147;constitutionally 
incapable,&#0148; &#0147;extravagant,&#0148; and one who writes in &#0147;queer 
English,&#0148; and by rehabilitating Alexander VI has &#0147;wasted a good 
deal of his own time.&#0148; &#0147;One would be loath to charge him with 
deliberate <I>suggestio falis</I>,&#0148; smugly remarks Fr. Thurston, and 
of course directly conveys that impression. As to Pope Alexander, the most 
odious charges are one more hurled against the maligned Pontiff, and Fr. 
Thurston for fifteen nauseating pages insists upon &#0147;the evil example 
of his private life.&#0148; This is unnecessary; it is untrue; it shows 
contempt of Christ's Vicar on earth.

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The most disquieting of all Fr. Thurston's writings that I know is without 
doubt his article upon the Holy House of Loreto, which is to be found in the 
<I>Catholic Encyclopaedia</I>, Vol. XIII, pp. 454-56, &#0147;Santa Casa di 
Loreto.&#0148; Here he jubilantly proclaims that &#0147;the Lauretan 
tradition is beset with difficulties of the gravest kind. These have been 
skilfully presented in the much-discussed work of Canon Chevalier, 
&#0145;Notre Dame de Lorette&#0146; (Paris, 1906). . . . His argument remains 
intact and has as yet found no adequate reply.&#0148; This last assertion 
is simply incorrect, as Canon U. Chevalier's theories have been answered 
and demolished both by Father A. Eschbach, Procurator-General of the 
Congregation of the Holy Ghost, in his exhaustive work 
<I>La V&#0233;rit&#0233; sur le Fair de 
Lorette</I>, and by the Rev. G. E. Phillips in his excellent study 
<I>Loreto and the Holy House</I>. From a 
careful reading of the article &#0147;Santa Casa di Loreto&#0148; it is 
obvious that the writer does not accept the fact of the Translation of the 
Holy House; at least that is the only impression I can gather from his words 
as, ignoring an unbroken tradition, the pronouncements of more than fifty 
Popes, the devotion of innumerable saints, the piety of countless writers, 
he gratuitously piles argument upon argument and emphasizes objection after 
objection to reduce the Translation of the House of Nazareth from Palestine 
to Italy to the vague story of a picture of the Madonna brought from Tersato 
in Illyria to Loreto. With reference to Canon Chevalier's work, so highly 
applauded by Fr. Thurston, it is well known that the late saintly Pontiff 
Pius X openly showed his great displeasure at the book, and took care to let 
it be widely understood that such an attack upon the Holy House 
sorely vexed and grieved him. In a Decree, 
12 April, 1916, Benedict XV, ordering the Feast of the Translation of the 
Holy House to be henceforward observed every year on the 10th December, in 
all the Dioceses and Religious Congregations of Italy and the adjacent Isles, 
solemnly and decisively declares that the Sanctuary of Loreto is &#0147;the 
House itself - translated from Palestine by the ministry of Angels - in 
which was born the Blessed Virgin Mary, and in which the Word was made 
Flesh.&#0148; In the face of this pronouncement it is hard to see how any 
Catholic can regard the Translation of the Holy House as a mere fairy tale 
to be classed with <I>Jack and the Beanstalk</I> or <I>Hop o&#0146; my Thumb</I>. 
It is certain that Fr. Thurston's disedifying attack has given pain to 
thousands of pious souls, and in Italy I have heard an eminent theologian, 
an Archbishop, speak of these articles in terms of unsparing condemnation.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Father Thurston is the author of a paper upon the subject of Pope Joan, but 
I am informed that it is no longer in print, and as I have not thought it 
worth while to make acquaintance with this lucubration I am unable to say 
whether he accepts the legend of this mythical dame as true or no.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
His bias evidently makes him incapable of dealing impartially with any 
historical fact, and even a sound and generally accepted theory would gain 
nothing by the adherence of so prejudiced an advocate. It has seemed worth 
while to utter a word of caution regarding his extraordinary output, and 
especially in our present connexion with reference to the article upon 
&#0147;Witchcraft,&#0148; which appears to me so little qualified to 
furnish the guidance readers may require in this difficult subject, and 
which by its inclusion in a standard work of reference might be deemed 
trustworthy and reliable.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It is very certain then that the Bull of Innocent VIII, <I>Summis desiderantes 
affectibus</I>, was at least a document of the highest authority, and that 
the Pontiff herein clearly intended to set forth dogmatic facts, although 
this can be distinguished from the defining of a dogma. A dogmatic fact is 
not indeed a doctrine of revelation, but it is so intimately connected with 
a revealed doctrine that it would be impossible to deny the dogmatic fact 
without contradicting or seriously impugning the dogma. It would not be very 
difficult to show that any denial of the teaching of Pope Innocent VIII must 
traverse the Gospel accounts of demoniacs, the casting out of devils by Our 
Saviour, and His Divine words upon the activities of evil spirits.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Giovanni Battista Cib&#0242;, the son of Arano Cib&#0242; and Teodorina de&#0146; 
Mare, was born at Genoa in 1432. His father, a high favourite with Callistus 
III (Alfonso de Borja), who reigned from 8 April, 1455, to 6 August, 1458, 
had filled with distinction the senatorial office at Rome in 1455, and under 
King Ren&#0233; won great honour as Viceroy of Naples. Having entered the 
household of Cardinal Calandrini, Giovanni Battista Cib&#0242; was in 1467 
created Bisop of Savona by Paul II, in 1473 Bishop of Molfetta by Sixtus IV, 
who raised him to the cardinalate in the following year. In the conclave 
which followed the death of this Pontiff, his great supporter proved to be 
Guiliano della Rovere, and on 29 August, 1484, he ascended the Chair of S. 
Peter, taking the name of Innocent VIII in memory, it is said, of his 
countryman, the Genoese Innocent IV (Sinibaldo de&#0146; Fieschi), who 
reigned from 25 June, 1243, to 7 December, 1254. The new Pope had to deal 
with a most difficult political situation, and before long found himself 
involved in a conflict with Naples. Innocent VIII made the most earnest 
endeavours to unite Christendom against the common enemy, the Turk, but the 
unhappy indecision among various princes unfortunately precluded any 
definite result, although the Rhodians surrendered to the Holy Father. As 
for Djem, the younger son of Mohammad II, this prince had fled for protection 
to the Knights of S. John, and Sultan Bajazet pledged himself to pay an 
annual allowance of 35,000 ducats for the safe-keeping of his brother. The 
Grand Master handed over Djem to the Pope and on 13 March, 1489, the Ottoman 
entered Rome, where he was treated with signal respect and assigned 
apartments in the Vatican itself.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Innocent VIII only canonized one Saint, the Margrave 
Leopold of Austria, who was raised to the Altar 6 January, 1485. However, 
on 31 May, 1492, he received from Sultan Bajazet the precious 
Relic of the Most Holy Lance with which 
Our Redeemer had been wounded by S. Longinus 
upon the Cross. A Turkish emir brought the Relic to Ancona, whence it was 
conveyed by the Bishop to Narni, when two Cardinals took charge of it and 
carried it to Rome. On 31 May Cardinal Hiulino della Rovere solemnly handed 
it in a crystal vessel to the Pope during a function at S. Maria del Popolo. 
It was then borne in procession to S. Peter's, and from the loggia of the 
protico the Holy Father bestowed his blessing upon the crowds, whilst the 
Cardinal della Rovere standing at his side exposed the Sacred Relic to the 
veneration of the thronging piazza. The Holy Lance, which is accounted one 
of the three great Relics of the Passion, is shown together with the Piece 
of the True Cross and S. Veronica's Veil at S. Peter's after Matins on Spy 
Wednesday and on Good Friday evening; after High Mass on Easter Day, and also 
several times during the course of Maundy Thursday and Good Friday. The 
Relics are exposed from the balcony over the statue of S. Veronica to the 
left of the Papal Altar. The strepitaculum is sounded from the balcony and 
then all present venerate the Lance, the Wood of the Cross, and the <I>Volto 
Santo</I>.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
One of the most important exterior events which marked the reign of Innocent 
was undoubtedly the fall of Granada, the last stronghold of the Moors in 
Spain, which city surrendered to Ferdinand of Aragon, who thereby with his 
Queen Isabella won the name of &#0147;Catholic,&#0148; on 2 January, 1492. 
The conquest of Granada was celebrated with public rejoicings and the most 
splendid f&#0234;tes at Rome. Every house was brilliant with candles; the 
expulsion of the Mohammedans was represented upon open stages in a kind of 
pantomime; and long processions visited the national church of Spain in the 
Piazza Navona, San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli, which had been 
erected in 1450.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
On 25 July, 1492, Pope Innocent, who had long been sickly and ailing so 
that his only nourishment for many weeks was woman's milk, passed away in 
his sleep at the Vatican. They buried him in S. Peter's, this great and 
noble Pontiff, and upon his tomb, a work in bronze by Pollaiuolo, were 
inscribed the felicitous words: <I>Ego autem in Innocentia mea ingressus 
sum</I>.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The chroniclers or rather scandalmongers of the day, Burchard and Infessura, 
have done their best to draw the character of Innocent VIII in very black 
and shameful colours, and it is to be regretted that more than one historian 
has not only taken his cure from their odious insinuations and evil gossip, 
but yet further elaborated the story by his own lurid imagination. When we 
add thereto and retail as sober evidence the venom of contemporary satirists 
such as Marullo and the fertile exaggerations of melodramatic publicists 
such as Egidio of Viterbo, a very sensational grotesque is the result. 
During his youth Giovanni Battista Cib&#0242; had, it seems, become 
enamoured of a Neapolitan lady, by whom he was the father of two children, 
Franceschetto and Teodorina. As was proper, both son and daughter were 
provided for in an ample and munificent manner; 
in 1488 his father married Franceschetto to 
Maddalena, a daughter of Lorenzo de&#0146; Medici. The lady Teodorina 
became the bride of Messer Gherardo Uso de&#0146; Mare, a Genoese merchant 
of great wealth, who was also Papal Treasurer. The capital that has been 
made out of these circumstances is hardly to be believed. It is admitted 
that this is contrary to strict morality and to be reasonably blamed. But 
this intrigue has been taken as the grounds for accusations of the most 
unbridled licentiousness, the tale of a lewd and lustful life. So far as I 
am aware the only other evidence for anything of the kind is the mud thrown 
by obscure writers at a great and truly 
Christian, if not wholly blameless, successor of S. Peter.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In spite of these few faults Innocent VIII was a Pontiff who at a most 
difficult time worthily filled his Apostolic dignity. In his public office 
his constant endeavours for peace; his tireless efforts to unite Christendom 
against their common foe, the Turk; his opposition to the revolutionary 
Hussites in Bohemia and the anarchical Waldenses, two sources of the gravest 
danger, must be esteemed as worthy of the highest praise. Could he have 
brought his labours to fruition Europe would in later ages have been spared 
many a conflict and many a disaster.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Roscoe in reference to Innocent remarks: 
&#0147;The urbanity and mildness of his manners 
formed a striking contrast to the inflexible character of his predecessor.&#0148; 
And again: &#0147;If the character of Innocent 
were to be impartially weighed, the balance would incline, but with no very 
rapid motion, to the favourable side. His native disposition seems to have 
been mild and placable; but the disputed claims of the Roman See, which he 
conceived it to be his duty to enforce, led him into embarassments, from 
which he was with difficulty extricated, and which, without increasing his 
reputation, destroyed his repose.&#0148; We have here the judgement of 
a historian who is inclined to censure rather than to defend, and who 
certainly did not recognize, because he was incapable of appreciating, the 
almost overwhelming difficulties with which Innocent must needs contend if 
he were, as in conscience bound, to act as the chief Pastor of Christendom, 
a critical position which he needs must face and endeavour to control, 
although he were well aware that humanly speaking his efforts had no chance 
of success, whilst they cost him health and repose and gained him 
oppugnancy and misunderstanding.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Immediately upon the receipt of the Bull, <I>Summis desiderantes affectibus</I>, 
in 1485, Fr. Henry Kramer commenced his crusade against witches at 
Innsbruck, but he was opposed on certain technical grounds by the Bishop of 
Brixen, nor was Duke Sigismund so ready to 
help the Inquisitors with the civil arm. In fact the prosecutions were, 
if not actually directed, at least largely controlled, by 
the episcopal authority; nor did the 
ordinary courts, as is so often supposed, invariably carry out the full 
sentence of the Holy Office. Not so very many years later, indeed, the civil 
power took full cognizance of any charges of witchcraft, and it was then 
that far more blood was spilled and far more fires blazed than ever in the 
days when Kramer and Sprenger were directing the trials. It should be borne 
in mind too that frequent disturbances, conspiracies of anarchists, and 
nascent Bolshevism showed that the district was rotted to the core, and the 
severities of Kramer and Sprenger were by no means so unwarranted as is 
generally supposed.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
On 6 June, 1474, Sprenger (Mag. Jacobus Sprenger) is mentioned as Prior of 
the Dominican house at Cologne, and on 8 February, 1479, he was present, as 
the socius of Gerhard von Elten, at the trial of John von Ruchratt of Wesel, 
who was found guilty of propagating the most subversive doctrines, and was 
sentenced to seclusion in the Augustinian monastery at Mainz, where he died 
in 1481.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Unfortunately full biographies of these two remarkable men, James Sprenger 
and Henry Kramer, have not been transmitted to us, but as many details 
have been succinctly collected in the <I>Scriptores Ordinis Praedicatorum</I> 
of Qu&#0233;tif and Echard, Paris, 1719, I have thought it convenient to 
transcribe the following accounts from that monumental work.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
F. Jacobus Sprenger (<I>sub anno</I> 1494). Fr. James Sprenger, a German by 
birth and a member of the community of the Dominican house at Cologne, 
greatly distinguished himself in his academic career at the University of 
that city. His name was widely known in the year 1468, when at the Chapter 
General of the Order which was held at Rome he was appointed Regent of 
Studies at the Formal House of Studies at Cologne, and the following is 
recorded in the statutes: <I>Fr. James Sprenger is officially appointed to 
study and lecture upon the Sentences so that he may proceed to the degree 
of Master</I>. A few years later, although he was yet quite a young man, 
since he had already proceeded Master, he was elected Prior and Regent of 
this same house, which important offices he held in the year 1475, and a 
little after, we are told, he was elected Provincial of the whole German 
Province. It was about this date that he was named by Sixtus IV General 
Inquisitor for Germany, and especially for the dioceses of Cologne and 
Mainz. He coadjutor was a Master of Sacred Theology, of the Cologne Convent, 
by name Fr. Gerard von Elten, who unfortunately died within a year or two. 
Pope Innocent VIII confirmed Fr. Sprenger in this office, and appointed Fr. 
Henry Kramer as his socius. Fr. Sprenger was especially distinguished on 
account of his burning and fearless zeal for the old faith, his vigilance, 
his constancy, his singleness and patience in correcting novel abuses and 
errors. We know that he was living in our house at Cologne at least as late 
as the year 1494, since the famous Benedictine Abbot 
John Trithemus refers to him in this year. 
It is most probable that he died and was buried among his brethren at 
Cologne. The following works are the fruit of his pen:
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
1. <I>The Paradoxes of John of Westphalia, which he preached from the pulpit 
at Worms, disproved and utterly refuted by two Masters of Sacred Theology, 
Fr. Gerard von Elten of Cologne and Fr. James Sprenger.</I> Printed at 
Mainz, 1479.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
2. <I>Malleus Maleficarum Maleficat & earum 
haeresim, ut framea potentissima conterens per F. Henricum Institoris & 
Jacobum Sprengerum Ord. Praedic. Inquisitores</I>, which has run into 
many editions (see the notice of <I>Fr. Henry Kramer</I>). This book was 
translated into French as <I>Le Maillet des 
Sorci&#0232;res</I>, Lyons, Stephanus Gueynard, 4to. See the 
<I>Biblioth&#0232;que Fran&#0231;oise du Verdier</I>.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
3. <I>The institution and approbation of the Society of Confraternity of the 
Most Holy Rosary which was first erected at Cologne on 8 September in the 
year 1475, with an account of many graces and Miracles, as also of the 
indulgences which have been granted to this said Confraternity.</I> I am 
uncertain whether he wrote and issued this book in Latin or in German, since 
I have never seen it, and it was certainly composed for the instruction and 
edification of the people. Moreover, it is reported that the following 
circumstances were the occasion of the found of this Society. In the year 
1475, when Nuess was being besieged by Charles, 
Duke of Burgunday, with a vast army, and the town was on the very point of 
surrender, the magistrates and chief burghers of Cologne, fearing the danger 
which threatened their city, resorted in a body to Fr. James, who was then 
Prior of the Convent, and besought him that if he knew of any plan or device 
which might haply ward off this disaster, he would inform them of it and 
instruct them what was best to be done. Fr. James, having seriously debated 
the matter with the senior members of the house, replied that all were 
agreed there could be no more unfailing and present remedy than to fly to 
the help of the Blessed Virgin, and that the very best way of effecting this 
would be if they were not only to honour the Immaculate Mother of God by 
means of the Holy Rosary which had been propagated several years ago by 
Blessed Alan de la Roche, but that they 
should also institute and erect a Society and Confraternity, in which every 
man should enrol himself with the firm resolve of thenceforth zealously and 
exactly fulfilling with a devout mind the obligations that might be required 
by the rules of membership. This excellent plan recommended itself to all. 
On the feast of the Nativity of Our Lady (8 September) the Society was 
inaugurated and High Mass was sung; there was a solemn procession throughout 
the city; all enrolled themselves and were inscribed on the Register; they 
fulfilled their duties continually with the utmost fervor, and before long 
the reward of their devotion was granted to them, since peace was made 
between the Emperor Frederick IV and Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgandy. In 
the following year, 1476, Alexander Nanni de Maltesta, Bishop of Forli 
and <I>legatus a latere</I> from Sixtus IV, 
who was then residing at Cologne, solemnly 
approved the Confraternity and on 10 March enriched it with many indulgences. 
And this is the first of those societies which are known as the 
Rosary Confraternirty to be erected and 
approved by the Apostolic authority. For in a short time, being enriched 
with so many indulgences, and new privileges and benefice being bestowed 
upon them almost daily, they have spread everywhere and they are to be found 
in almost every town and city throughout the whole of 
Christendom. It is worthy of remark that 
on the very same day that this Confraternity was erected at Cologne, Blessed 
Alan de la Roche of blessed memory, the most eminent promoter of the 
devotion of the Holy Rosary, died at Rostock; 
and his beloved disciple, Fr. Michel 
Fran&#0231;ois de l&#0146;Isle, who was sometime Master of Sacred 
Theology at Cologne, gave Fr. Sprenger the most valuable assistance when the 
Rosary was being established, as we have related above. The works of Fr. 
James Sprenger are well approved by many authors as well as Trithemius; 
since amongst others who have praised him highly we may mention 
Albert Leander, O.P.; 
Antony of Siena, O.P.; Fernandez in his 
<I>Concert. & Isto. del Rosar</I>, Lib. 4, cap. 1, fol. 127; Fontana in his 
<I>Theatro & Monum</I>. published at Altamura, 1481; and, of authors not 
belonging to our Order, Antonius Possevinus, 
S.J., Miraeus, Aegidius Gelenius in his

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Of Henry Kramer, Jacques Qu&#0233;tif and Echard, <I>Scriptores Ordini 
Praedicatorum</I>, Paris, 1719, Vol. 1, pp. 896-97, <I>sub anno</I> 1500, 
give the following account: Fr. Henry Kramer (F. Henricus Institorus) was of 
German nationality and a member of the German Province. It is definitely 
certain the he was a Master of Sacred Theology, which holy science he 
publicly professed, although we have not been able to discover either in 
what town of Germany he was born, in what Universities he lectured, or in 
what house of the Order he was professed. He was, however, very greatly 
distinguished by he zeal for the Faith, which he most bravely and most 
strenuously defended both by his eloquence in the pulpit and on the printed 
page, and so when in those dark days various errors had begun to penetrate 
Germany, and witches with their horrid craft, foul sorceries, and devilish 
commerce were increasing on every side, Pope Innocent VIII, by Letters 
Apostolic which were given at Rome at S. Peter's in the first year of his 
reign, 1484, appointed Henry Kramer and James Sprenger, Professors of Sacred 
Theology, general Inquisitors for all the dioceses of the five metropolitan 
churches of Germany, that is to say, Mainz, Cologne, Tr&#0232ves, Salzburg, 
and Bremen. They showed themselves most zealous in the work which they had 
to do, and especially did they make inquisition for witches and for those 
who were gravely suspect of sorcery, all of whom they prosecuted with the 
extremest rigour of the law. Maximilian I, Emperor of Germany and King of 
the Romans, by royal letters patent which he signed at Brussels on 6 
November, 1486, bestowed upon Fr. Kramer and Fr. Sprenger the enjoyment of 
full civil powers in the performance of their duties as Inquisitors, and he 
commanded that throughout his dominions all should obey the two delegates 
of the Holy Office in their business, and should be ready and willing to 
help them upon every occasion. For several years Fr. Henry Kramer was 
Spiritual Director attached to our Church at Salzburg, which important office 
he fulfilled with singular great commendation. Thence he was summoned in the 
year 1495 to Venice by the Master-General of the Order, Fr. Joaquin de 
Torres, in order that he might give public lectures, and hold disputations 
concerning public worship and the adoration of the Most Holy Sacrament. For 
there were some theologians about this date who taught that the Blessed 
Sacrament must only be worshipped conditionally, with an implicit and 
intellectual reservation of adoring the Host in the tabernacle only in so 
far as It had been duly and exactly consecrated. Fr. Kramer, whose 
disputations were honoured by the presence of the 
Patriarch of Venice, with the utmost 
fervour publicly confronted those who maintained this view, and not 
infrequently did he preach against them from the pulpit. The whole question 
had recently arisen from a certain circumstance which happened in the vicinity 
of Padua. When a country fellow was collecting wood and dry leaves in a 
little copse hard by the city he found, wrapped up in a linen cloth beneath 
some dry brambles and bracken and dead branches of trees, two pyxes or 
ciboria containing particles which some three years before had been stolen 
from a neighbouring church, the one of which was used to carry the Lord's 
Body to the sick, the other being provided for the exposition of the 
Sanctissimum on the feast of Corpus Christi. The rustic immediately reported 
what he had discovered to the parish priest of the chapel hard by the 
spinnery. The good Father immediately hastened to the spot and saw that it 
was exactly as had been told him. When he more closely examined the vessels 
he found in one pyx a number of Hosts, and so fetching thither from the 
church a consecrated altar-stone which it was the custom to carry when the 
Viaticum was taken to the dying in order that the ciborium might be decently 
set thereon, he covered the stone with a corporal or a friar linen cloth and 
reverently placed it beneath the pyx. He built all around a little wooden 
baldaquin or shrine, and presently put devout persons to watch the place so 
that no indignity might be done. Meanwhile the incident had been noised 
abroad and vast throngs of people made their way to the place where the 
thicket was; candles were lighted all around; &#0147;Christ's Body,&#0148; 
they cry, &#0147;is here&#0148;; and every knee bent in humblest adoration. 
Before long news of the event was reported to the 
Bishop of Padua, who, having sent thither 
tow or three priests, inquired most carefully into every detail. Since in 
the other ciborium they only found some corrupted particles of the 
Sacramental Species, in the sight of the whole multitude the clerics who 
had come from the Bishop broke down the tiny tabernacle that had been 
improvised, scattered all the boughs and leafery which were arranged about 
it, extinguished the tapers, and carried the sacred vessels away with them. 
Immediately after it was forbidden under severest penalties of ecclesiastical 
censures and excommunication itself for anyone to visit that spot or to 
offer devotions there. Moreover, upon this occasion certain priests preached 
openly that the people who resorted thither had committed idolatry, that 
they had worshipped nothing else save brambles and decay, trees, nay, some 
went so far as to declare that they had adored the devil himself. As might 
be supposed, very grave contentions were set astir between the parish priests 
and their flocks, and it was sharply argued whether the people had sinned by 
their devotion to Christ's Body, Which they sincerely believed to be there, 
but Which (it seems) perhaps was not there: and the question was then mooted 
whether a man ought not to worship the Blessed Sacrament, ay, even when 
Christ's Body is consecrated in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and elevated 
and carried as Viaticum in procession to the sick, only conditionally, that 
is to say, since he does not perhaps know if It is actually Christ's Body 
(or whether some accident may not have occurred), since no mane can claim to 
be individually enlightened to by God on this point and desire to have the 
Mystery demonstrated and proved to him. It 
was much about the same thing that Fr. Kramer undertook to refute and 
utterly disprove the bold and wicked theories put forward by another preacher 
who at Augsburg dared to proclaim from the pulpit that the Catholic Church 
had not definitely laid down that the appearances of Christ in His human 
body, and sometimes bleeding from His Sacred Wounds, in the 
Blessed Sacrament are real and true 
manifestations of Our Saviour, but that it may be disputed whether Our Lord 
is truly there and truly to be worshipped by the people. This wretch even 
went so far as to say that miracles of this kind should be left as it were 
to the good judgement of God, inasmuch as with regard to these miraculous 
appearances nothing had been strictly defined by the Church, nor yet do the 
Holy Fathers or Doctors lay down and sure and certain rule. These doctrines 
Fr. Kramer opposed with the utmost zeal and learning, delivering many an 
eloquent sermon against the innovator and utterly condemning the theories 
which had been thus put forth and proclaimed. Nay, more, by virtue of his 
position and his powers as delegate of the Holy Office he forbade under the 
pain of excommunication that anyone should ever again dare to preach such 
errors. Fr. Kramer wrote several works, of which some have been more than 
once reprinted:<BR>

4. <I>The Shield of Defence of the Holy Roman Church against the 
Picards and Waldenses.</I> This was 
published when Fr. Kramer was acting as Censor of the Faith under 
Alexander VI in Bohemia and Moldavia. 
This work is praised by the famous Dominican writer 
Noel Alexandre in his <I>Selecta 
historiae ecclesiasticae capita et in loca eiusdem insignia dissertationes 
historicae, criticae, dogmaticae</I>. In dealing with the fifteenth century 
he quotes passages from this work. The bibliographer Beugheim catalogues an 
edition of this work among those Incunabula the exact date of which cannot 
be traced. Georg Simpler, who was Rector of the University of Pforzheim, 
and afterwards Professor of Jurisprudence of Tubingen in the early decades 
of the sixteenth century, also mentions this work with commendation. 
Odorico Rinaldi quotes from this work 
in his <I>Annales</I> under the year 1500. The <I>Sermons</I> of 1496 are 
highly praised by Antony of Siena, O.P. 
Antonius Possevinus, S.J., speaks of a treatise <I>Against the Errors of 
Witches</I>. This I have never seen, but I feel very well assured that it is 
no other work than the <I>Malleus Maleficarum</I>, which was written in 
collaboration with Fr. James Sprenger, and which we have spoken above in 
some detail.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In what year Fr. Henry Kramer died and to what house of the Order he was 
then attached is not recorded, but it seems certain that he was living at 
least as late as 1500.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Thus Qu&#0233;tif-Echard, but we may not impertinently add a few, from 
several, formal references which occur in Dominican registers and archives. 
James Sprenger was born at Basel (he is called <I>de Basilea</I> in a MS. 
belonging to the Library of Basel), probably about 1436038, and he was 
admitted as a Dominican novice in 1452 at the convent of his native town. 
An extract &#0147;ex monumentis contuent. Coloniens.&#0148; says that 
Sprenger &#0147;beatus anno 1495 obiit Argentinae ad S. Nicolaum in Undis 
in conuentu sororum ordinis nostri.&#0148; Another account relates that he 
did not die at Strasburg on 6 December, 1495, but at Verona, 3 February, 
1503, and certainly Jacobus Magdalius in his <I>Stichologia</I> has 
&#0147;In mortem magistri Iacobi Sprenger, sacri ordinis praedicatorii per 
Theutoniam prouincialis, Elegia,&#0148; which commences:<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
O utinam patrio recubassent ossa sepulchro<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Quae modo Zenonis urbe sepulta 
iacent.<P>

Henry Kramer, who appears in the Dominican registers as &#0147;Fr. Henricus 
Institoris de Sletstat,&#0148; was born about 1430. His later years were 
distinguished by the fervour of his apostolic missions in Bohemia, where 
he died in 1505.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Although, as we have seeb, Fr. Henry Kramer and Fr. James Sprenger were men 
of many activities, it is by the <I>Malleus Maleficarum</I> that they will 
chiefly be remembered. There can be no doubt that this work had in its day 
and for a full couple of centuries an enormous influence. There are few 
demonologists and writers upon witchcraft who do not refer to its pages as 
an ultimate authority. It was continually quoted and appealed to in the 
witch-trials of Germany, France, Italy, and England; whilst the methods and 
examples of the two Inquisitors gained an even more extensive credit and 
sanction owing to their reproduction (sometimes without direct 
acknowledgement) in the works of Bedin, De Lancre, Boguet, Remy, Tartarotti, 
Elich, Grilland, Pons, Godelmann, de Moura, Oberlal, Cigogna, Peperni, 
Martinus Aries, Anania, Binsfeld, Bernard Basin, Menghi, Stampa, Clodius, 
Schelhammer, Wolf, Stegmann, Neissner, Voigt, Cattani, Ricardus, and a 
hundred more. King James has drawn (probably indirectly) much of his 
<I>Daemonologie, in Forme of a Dialogue, 
Divided into three Bookes</I> from the pages of the <I>Malleus</I>; and 
Thomas Shadwell, the Orance laureate, in his &#0147;Notes upon the 
Magick&#0148; of his famous play, <I>The 
Lancashire Witches</I>, continually quotes from the same source.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
To some there may seem much in the <I>Malleus Maleficarum</I> that is crude, 
much that is difficult. For example, the etymology will provoke a smile. 
The derivation of <I>Femina</I> from 
<I>fe minus</I> is notorious, and hardly less awkward is the statement that 
<I>Diabolus</I> comes &#0147;a Dia, 
quod est duo, et bolus, quod est morsellus; quia duo occidit, scilicet 
corpus et animam.&#0148; Yet I venture to say that these blemishes - such 
gross blunders, of you will - do not affect the real contexture and weight 
of this mighty treatise.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Possibly what will seem even more amazing to modern readers is the misogynic 
trend of various passages, and these not of the briefest nor least pointed. 
However, exaggerated as these may be, I am not altogether certain that they 
will not prove a wholesome and needful antidote in this feministic age, 
when the sexes seem confounded, and it appear to be the chief object of many 
females to ape the man, an indecorum by which they not only divest themselves 
of such charm as they might boast, but lay themselves open to the sternest 
reprobation in the name of sanity and common-sense. For the Apostle S. Peter 
says: &#0147;Let wives be subject to their husbands: that if any believe 
not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the 
wives, considering your chaste conversation with fear. Whose adorning let it 
not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of god, or the 
putting on of apparel; but the hidden man of the heart is the incorruptibility 
of a quiet and meek spirit, which is rich in the sight of God. For after the 
manner heretofore the holy women also, who trusted God, adorned themselves, 
being in subjection to their own husbands: as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling 
him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well, and not fearing any 
disturbance.&#0148;<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
With regard to the sentences pronounced upon witches and the course of their 
trials, we may say that these things must be considered in reference and in 
proportion to the legal code of the age. Modern justice knows sentences of 
the most ferocious savagery, punishments which can only be dealt out by 
brutal vindictiveness, and these are often meted out to offences concerning 
which we may sometimes ask ourselves whether 
they are offences at all; they certainly do no harm to society, and no 
harm to the person. Witches were the bane of all social order; they injured 
not only persons but property. They were, in fact, as has previously been 
emphasized, the active members of a vast revolutionary body, a conspiracy 
against civilization. Any other save the most thorough measures must have 
been unavailing; worse, they must have but fanned the flame.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And so in the years to come, when the <I>Malleus Maleficarum</I> was used 
as a standard text-book, supremely authoritative practice winnowed the little 
chaff, the etymologies, from the wheat of wisdom. Yet it is safe to say that 
the book is to-day scarcely known save by name. It has become a legend. 
Writer after writer, who had never turned the pages, felt himself at liberty 
to heap ridicule and abuse upon this venerable volume. He could quote - 
though he had never seen the text - an etymological absurdity or two, or if 
in more serious vein he could prate glibly enough of the publication of the 
<I>Malleus Maleficarum</I> as a &#0147;most disastrous episode.&#0148; He 
did not know very clearly what he meant, and the humbug trusted that nobody 
would stop to inquire. For the most part his confidence was respected; his 
word was taken.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
We must approach this great work - admirable in spite of its triffling 
blemishes - with open minds and grave intent; if we duly consider the world 
of confusion, of Bolshevism, of anarchy and licentiousness all around to-day, 
it should be an easy task for us to picture the difficulties, the hideous 
dangers with which Henry Kramer and James Sprenger were called to combat and 
to cope; we must be prepared to discount certain plain faults, certain 
awkwardnesses, certain roughness and even severities; and then shall we be 
in a position dispassionately and calmy to pronounce opinion upon the value 
and the merit of this famouse treatise.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
As for myself, I do not hesitate to record my judgement. Literary merits and 
graces, strictly speaking, were not the aim of the authors of the <I>Malleus 
Maleficarum</I>, although there are felicities not a few to be found in 
their admirable pages. Yet I dare not even hope that the flavour of Latinity 
is preserved in a translation which can hardly avoid being jejune and bare. 
The interest, then, lies in the subject-matter. And from this point of view 
the <I>Malleus Maleficarum</I> is one of the most pregnant and most 
interesting books I know in the library of its kind - a kind which, as it 
deals with eternal things, the eternal conflict of good and evil, must 
eternally capture the attention of all men who think, all who see, or are 
endeavouring to see, reality beyond the accidents of matter, time, and 
space.<P><BR><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It has been observed that &#0147;it is quite impossible to appreciate and 
understand the true and inner lives of men and women in Elizabethan and 
Stuart England, in the France of Louis XIII and during the long reign of 
his son and successor, in Italy of the Renaissance and the Catholic 
Reaction - to name but three European countries and a few definite periods - 
unless we have some realization of the part that Witchcraft played in those 
ages amid the affairs of these Kingdoms. All classes were affected and 
concerned from Pope to peasant, from Queen to cottage girl.&#0148;
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Witchcraft was inextricably mixed with politics. Matthew Paris tells us 
how in 1232 the Chief Justice Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, (Shakespeare's 
&#0147;gentle Hubert&#0148; in <I>King John</I>), was accused by Peter do Roches, Bishop of 
Winchester, of having won the favour of Henry III through &#0147;charms and 
incantations&#0148;. In 1324 there was a terrific scandal at Coventry when it was 
discovered that a number of the richest and most influential burghers of the 
town had long been consulting with Master John, a professional necromancer, 
and paying him large sums to bring about by his arts the death of Edward II 
and several nobles of the court. Alice Perrers, the mistress pf Edward III, 
was not only reputed to have infatuated the old King by occult spells, but 
her physician (believed to be a mighty sorcerer) was arrested on a charge of 
confecting love philtres and talismans. Henry V, in the autumn of 1419, 
prosecuted his stepmother, Joan of Navarre, for attempting to kill him by 
witchcraft, &#0147;in the most horrible manner that one could devise.&#0148; The 
conqueror of Agincourt was exceedingly worried about the whole wretched 
business, as also was the Archbishop of Canterbury, who ordered public 
prayers for the King's safety. In the reign of his son, Henry VI, in 1441, 
one of the highest and noblest ladies in the realm, Eleanor Cobham, Duchess 
of Gloucester, was arraigned for conspiring with &#0147;a clerk&#0148;, Roger 
Bolingbroke, &#0147;a most notorious evoker of demons&#0148;, and &#0147;the most famous 
scholar in the whole world in astrology in magic&#0148;, to procure the death of 
the young monarch by sorcery, so that the Duke of Gloucester, Henry's uncle 
and guardian, might succeed to the crown. In this plot were further involved 
Canon Thomas Southwell, and a &#0147;relapsed witch&#0148;, that is to say, one who had 
previously (eleven years before) been incarcerated upon grave suspicion of 
black magic, Margery Jourdemayne. Bolingbroke, whose confession implicated 
the Duchess, was hanged; Canon Southwell died in prison; the witch in 
Smithfield was &#0147;burn'd to Ashes&#0148;, since her offence was high treason. The 
Duchess was sentenced to a most degrading public penance, and imprisoned for 
life in Peel Castle, Isle of Man. Richard III, upon seizing the throne in 
1483, declared that the marriage of his brother, Edward IV, with the Lady 
Elizabeth Grey, had been brought about by &#0147;sorcery and witchcraft&#0148;, and 
further that &#0147;Edward's wife, that monstrous witch, has plotted with Jane 
Shore to waste and wither his body.&#0148; Poor Jane Shore did most exemplary 
penance, walking the flinty streets of London barefoot in her kirtle. In 
the same year when Richard wanted to get rid of the Duke of Buckingham, his 
former ally, one of the chief accusations he launched was that the Duke 
consulted with a Cambridge &#0147;necromancer&#0148; to compass and devise his death.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
One of the most serious and frightening events in the life of James VII 
of Scotland (afterwards James I of England) was the great conspiracy of 
1590, organized by the Earl of Bothwell. 

James with good reason feared and 
hated Bothwell, who, events amply proved, was Grand Master of more than one 
hundred witches, all adepts in poisoning, and all eager to do away with the 
King. In other words, Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, was the centre and 
head of a vast political plot. A widespread popular panic was the result of 
the discovery of this murderous conspiracy.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In France as early as 583, when the infant son and heir of King Chilperic, 
died of dysentery, as the doctors diagnosed it, it came to light that 
Mumolus, one of the leading officials of the court, had been secretly 
administering to the child medicines, which he obtained from &#0147;certain 
witches of Paris&#0148;. These potions were pronounced by the physicians to be 
strong poisons. In 1308, Guichard, Bishop of Troyes, was accused of having 
slain by sorcery the Queen of Philip IV of France (1285-1314), Jeanne of 
Navarre, who died three years before. The trial dragged on from 1308 to 
1313, and many witnesses attested on oath that the prelate had continually 
visited certain notorious witches, who supplied him philtres and draughts. 
In 1315, during the brief reign (1314-1316) of Louis X, the eldest son of 
Philip IV, was hanged Enguerrand de Marigny, chamberlain, privy councillor, 
and chief favourite of Philip, whom, it was alleged, he had bewitched to 
gain the royal favour. The fact, however, which sealed his doom was his 
consultation with one Jacobus de Lor, a warlock, who was to furnish a 
nostrum warranted to put a very short term to the life of King Louis. 
Jacobus strangled himself in prison.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In 1317 Hugues G&#0233;raud, Bishop of Cahors, was executed by Pope John 
XXII, who reigned 1316-1334, residing at Avignon. Langlois says that the 
Bishop had attempted the Pontiff's life by poison procured from witches.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Perhaps the most resounding of all scandals of this kind in France was the 
La Voison case, 1679-1682, when it was discovered that Madame de Montespan 
had for years been trafficking with a gang of poisoners and sorcerers, who 
plotted the death of the Queen and the Dauphan, so that Louis XIV might be 
free to wed Ath&#0233;nais de Montespan, whose children should inherit the 
throne. The Duchesse de Fontanges, a beautiful young country girl, who had 
for a while attracted the wayward fancy of Louis, they poisoned out of hand. 
Money was poured out like water, and it has been said that &#0147;the entire 
floodtide of poison, witchcraft and diabolism was unloosed&#0148; to attain the 
ends of that &#0147;marvellous beauty&#0148; (so Mme. de S&#0233;vign&#0233; calls her), 
the haughty and reckless Marquise de Montespan. In her thwarted fury she well 
nigh resolved to sacrifice Louis himself to her overweening ambition and her 
boundless pride. The highest names in France - the Princesse de Tingry, the 
Duchesse de Vitry, the Duchesse de Lusignan, the Duchesse de Bouillon, the 
Comtesse de Soissons, the Duc de Luxembourg, the Marguis de Cessac - scores 
of the older aristocracy, were involved, whilst literally hundreds of venal 
apothecaries, druggists, pseudo-alchemists, astrologers, quacks, warlocks, 
magicians, charlatans, who revolved round the ominous and terrible figure of 
Catherine La Voisin, professional seeress, fortune-teller, herbalist, 
beauty-specialist, were caught in the meshes of law. No less than eleven 
volumes of Fran&#0231;ois Ravaison's huge work, <I>Archives de la Bastille</I>, 
are occupied with this evil crew and their doings, their sorceries and their 
poisonings.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
During the reign of Urban VIII, Maffeo Barberini, 1623-1644, there was a 
resounding scandal at Rome when it was discovered that &#0147;after many invocations 
of demons&#0148; Giacinto Contini, nephew of the Cardinal d'Ascoli, had been 
plotting with various accomplices to put an end to the Pope's life, and thus 
make way for the succession of his uncle to the Chair of Peter. Tommaso 
Orsolini of Recanate, moreover, after consulting with certain scryers and 
planetarians, readers of the stars, was endeavouring to bribe the apothecary 
Carcurasio of Naples to furnish him with a quick poison, which might be 
mingled with the tonics and electuaries prescribed for the ailing Pontiff, 
(Ranke, <I>History of the Popes</I>, ed. 1901, Vol. III, pp. 375-6).
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
To sum up, as is well observed by Professor Kittredge, who more than once 
emphasized &#0147;I have no belief in

the black art or in the interference of demons in the daily life of 
mortals&#0148;, it makes no difference whether any of the charges were true or 
whether the whole affairs were hideous political chicanery. &#0147;Anyhow, it 
reveals the beliefs and the practices of the age.&#0148;
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Throughout the centuries witchcraft was universally held to be a dark and 
horrible reality; it was an ever-present, fearfully ominous menace, a thing 
most active, most perilous, most powerful and true. Some may consider these 
mysteries and cantrips and invocations, these sabbats and rendezvous, to 
have been merest mummery and pantomime, but there is no question that the 
psychological effect was incalculable, and harmful in the highest degree. It 
was, to use a modern phrase, &#0147;a war of nerves&#0148;. Jean Bodin, the famous 
juris-consult (1530-90) whom Montaigne acclaims to be the highest literary 
genius of his time, and who, as a leading member of the Parlement de Paris, 
presided over important trials, gives it as his opinion that there existed, 
no only in France, a complete organization of witches, immensely wealthy, of 
almost infinite potentialities, most cleverly captained, with centres and 
cells in every district, utilizing an espionage in ever land, with high-placed 
adherents at court, with humble servitors in the cottage. This organization, 
witchcraft, maintained a relentless and ruthless war against the prevailing 
order and settled state. No design was too treacherous, no betrayal was too 
cowardly, no blackmail too base and foul. The Masters lured their subjects 
with magnificent promises, they lured and deluded and victimized. Not the 
least dreaded and dreadful weapon in their armament was the ancient and 
secret knowledge of poisons (<I>veneficia</I>), of herbs healing and hurtful, 
a tradition and a lore which had been handed down from remotest antiquity.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Little wonder, then, that later social historians, such as Charles Mackay 
and Lecky, both absolutely impartial and unprejudiced writers, sceptical 
even, devote many pages, the result of long and laborious research, to 
witchcraft. The did not believe in witchcraft as in any sense supernatural, 
although perhaps abnormal. But the centuries of which they were writing 
believed intensely in it, and it was their business as scholars to examine 
and explain the reasons for such belief. It was by no means all medi&#0230;val 
credulity and ignorance and superstition. MacKay and Lecky fully recognized 
this, as indeed they were in all honesty bound to do. They met with facts, 
hard facts, which could neither have been accidents nor motiveless, and 
these facts must be accounted for and elucidated. The profoundest thinkers, 
the acutest and most liberal minds of their day, such men as Cardan; 
Trithemius; the encylcop&#0230;dic Delrio; Bishop Binsfeld; the learned 
physician, Caspar Peucer; Jean Bodin; Sir Edward Coke, &#0147;father of the 
English law&#0148;; Francis Bacon; Malebranche; Bayle; Glanvil; Sir Thomas Browne; 
Cotton Mather; all these, and scores besides, were convinced of the dark 
reality of witchcraft, of the witch organization. Such a consensus of 
opinion throughout the years cannot be lightly dismissed.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The literature of the subject, discussing it in every detail, from every 
point of view, from every angle, is enormous. For example, such a Bibliography 
as that of Yve-Plessis, 1900, which deals only with leading French cases and 
purports to be no more than a supplement to the Bibliographies of Gr&#0230;sse, 
the Catalogues of the Abb&#0233; S&#0233;pher, Ouvaroff, the comte d'Ourches, 
the forty-six volumes of Dr. Hoefer, Shieble, Stanislas de Guaita, and many 
more, lists nearly 2,000 items, and in a note we are warned that the work is 
very far from complete. The <I>Manuel Bibliographique</I>, 3 vols., 1912, of 
Albert L. Caillet, gives 11,648 items. Caillet has many omissions, some being 
treatises of the first importance. The library of witchcraft may without 
exaggeration be said to be incalculable.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It is hardly disputed that in the whole vast literature of witchcraft, the 
most prominent, the most important, the most authorative volume is the 
<I>Malleus Maleficarum (The Witch Hammer)</I> of Heinrich Kramer (Henricus 
Institoris) and James Sprenger. The date of the first edition of the 
<I>Malleus</I> cannot be fixed with absolute certainty, but the likeliest 
year is 1486. There were, at any rate, fourteen editions between 1487

and 1520, and at least sixteen editions between 1574 and 1669. These were 
issued from the leading German, French and Italian presses. The latest 
reprint of the original text of the <I>Malleus</I> is to be found in the 
noble four volume collection of Treatises on Witchcraft, &#0147;sumptibus Claudii 
Bourgeat&#0148;, 4to., Lyons, 1669. There is a modern German translation by J.W.R. 
Schmidt, <I>Der Hexehammer</I>, 3 vols., Berlin, 1906; second edition, 
1922-3. There is also an English translation with Introduction, Bibliography, 
and Notes by Montague Summers, published John Rodker, 1928.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The <I>Malleus</I> acquired especial weight and dignity from the famous Bull 
of Pope Innocent VIII, <I>Summis desiderantes affectibus</I> of 9 December, 
1484, in which the Pontiff, lamenting the power and prevalence of the witch 
organization, delegates Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger as inquisitors of 
these pravities throughout Northern Germany, particularly in the provinces 
and dioceses of Mainz, Cologne, Tr&#0233;ves, Salzburg, and Bremen, granting 
both and either of them an exceptional authorization, and by Letters Apostolic 
requiring the Bishop of Strasburg, Albrecht von Bayern (1478-1506), not 
only to take steps to publish and proclaim the Bull, but further to afford 
Kramer and Sprenger every assistance, even calling in, if necessary, the help 
of the secular arm.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
This Bull, which was printed as the Preface to the <I>Malleus</I>, was thus, 
comments Dr. H.C. Lea, &#0147;spread broadcast over Europe&#0148;. In fact, &#0147;it fastened 
on European jurisprudence for nearly three centuries the duty of combating&#0148; 
the Society of Witches. The <I>Malleus</I> lay on the bench of every 
magistrate. It was the ultimate, irrefutable, unarguable authority. It was 
implicitly accepted not only by Catholic but by Protestant legislature. In 
fine, it is not too much to say that the <I>Malleus Maleficarum</I> is among 
the most important, wisest, and weightiest books of the world.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It has been asked whether Kramer or Sprenger was principally responsible for 
the <I>Malleus</I>, but in the case of so close a collaboration any such 
inquiry seems singularly superflous and nugatory. With regard to instances 
of jointed authorship, unless there be some definite declaration on the part 
of one of the authors as to his particular share in a work, or unless there 
be some unusual and special circumstances bearing on the point, such 
perquisitions and analysis almost inevitably resolve themselves into a cloud 
of guess-work and bootless hazardry and vague perhaps. It becomes a game of 
literary blind-man's-bluff.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Heinrich Kramer was born at Schlettstadt, a town of Lower Alsace, situated 
some twenty-six miles southwest of Strasburg. At an early age he entered the 
Order of S. Dominic, and so remarkable was his genius that whilst still a 
young man he was appointed to the position of Prior of the Dominican House 
at his native town, Schlettstadt. He was a Preacher-General and a Master of 
Sacred Theology. P.G. and S.T.M., two distinctions in the Dominican Order. 
At some date before 1474 he was appointed an Inquisitor for the Tyrol, 
Salzburg, Bohemia, and Moravia. His eloquence in the pulpit and tireless 
activity received due recognition at Roma, and for many years he was 
Spiritual Director of the great Dominican church at Salzburg, and the 
right-hand of the Archbishop of Salzburg, a munificent prelat who praises 
him highly in a letter which is still extant. In the late autumn or winter 
of 1485 Kramer had already drawn up a learned instruction or treatise on the 
subject of witchcraft. This circulated in manuscript, and is (almost in its 
entirety) incorporated in the <I>Malleus</I>. By the 
Bull of Innocent VIII in December, 1484, he had already been associated 
with James Sprenger to make inquisition for and try witches and sorcerers. 
In 1495, the Master General of the Order, Fr. Joaquin de Torres, O.P., 
summoned Kramer to Venice in order that he might give public lectures, 
disputations which attracted crowded audiences, and which were honoured by 
the presence and patronage of the Patriarch of Venice. He also strenuously 
defended the Papal supremacy, confuting the <I>De Monarchia</I> of the 
Paduan jurisconsult, Antonio degli Roselli. At Venice he resided at the 
priory of Santi Giovanni e Paolo (S. Zanipolo). During the summer of 1497, 
he had returned to Germany, and was living at the convent of Rohr, near 
Regensburg. On 31 January, 1500, Alexander VI appointed him as Nuncio and 
Inquisitor of Bohemia and Moravia, in which provinces he was deputed and 
empowered to proceed against the Waldenses and Picards, as well as against 
the adherents of the witch-society. He wrote and preached with great fervour 
until the end. He died in Bohemia in 1505.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
His chief works, in addition to the <I>Malleus</I>, are: <I>Several 
Discourses and Various Sermons upon the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist</I>; 
Nuremberg, 1496; <I>A Tract Confuting the Errors of Master Antonio degli 
Roselli</I>; Venice, 1499; and <I>The Shield of Defence of the Holy Roman 
Church Against the Picards and Waldenses</I>; an incunabulum, without date, 
but almost certainly 1499-1500. Many learned authors quote and refer to 
these treatises in terms of highest praise.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
James Sprenger was born in Basel, 1436-8. He was admitted a novice in the 
Dominican house of this town in 1452. His extraordinary genius attracted 
immediate attention, and his rise to a responsible position was very rapid. 
According to Pierre H&#0233;lyot, the Fransican (1680-1716), <I>Histoire 
des Ordres Religieux</I>, III (1715), ch. XXVI, in 1389 Conrad of Prussia 
abolished certain relaxations and abuses which had crept into the Teutonic 
Province of the Order of S. Dominic, and restored the Primitive and Strict 
Obedience. He was closely followed by Sprenger, whose zealous reform was so 
warmly approved that in 1468 the General Chapter ordered him to lecture on 
the sentences of Peter Lombard at the University of Cologne, to which he was 
thus officially attached. A few years later he proceeded Master of Theology, 
and was elected Prior and Regent of Studies of the Cologne Convent, one of 
the most famous and frequented Houses of the Order. On 30 June, 1480, he was 
elected Dean of the Faculty of Theology at the University. His lecture-room 
was thronged, and in the following year, at the Chapter held in Rome, the 
Master General of the Order, Fra Salvo Cusetta, appointed him Inquisitor 
Extraordinary for the Provinces of Mainz, Tr&#0232;ves, and Cologne. His 
activities were enormous, and demanded constant journeyings through the very 
extensive district to which he had been assigned. In 1488 he was elected 
Provincial of the whole German Province, an office of the first importance. 
It is said that his piety and his learning impressed all who came in contact 
with him. In 1495 he was residing at Cologne, and here he received a letter 
from Alexander VI praising his enthusiasm and his energy. He died rather 
suddenly, in the odour of sanctity - some chronicles call him &#0147;Beatus&#0148; - 
on 6 December, 1495, at Strasburg, where he is buried.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Among Sprenger's other writings, excepting the <I>Malleus</I>, are <I>The 
Paradoxes of John of Westphalia Refuted</I>, Mainz, 1479, a closely argued 
treatise; and <I>The Institution and Approbation of the Confraternity of 
the Most Holy Rosary, which was first erected at Cologne on 8 September 
in the year 1475</I>, Cologne, 1475. Sprenger may well be called the 
&#0147;Apostle of the Rosary&#0148;. None more fervent than he in spreading 
this Dominican elevation. His zeal enrolled thousands, including the 
Emperor Frederick III, in the Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary, which 
was enriched with many indulgences by a Bull of Sixtus IV. It has been 
observed that the writings of Father James Sprenger on the Rosary are well 
approved by many learned men, Pontiffs, Saints and Theologians alike. There 
can be no doubt that Sprenger was a mystic of the highest order, a man of 
most saintly life.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The Dominican chroniclers, such as Qu&#0233;tif and Echard, number Kramer 
and Sprenger among the glories and heroes of their Order.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Certain it is that the <I>Malleus Maleficarum</I> is the most solid, the 
most important work in the whole vast library of witchcraft. One turns to it 
again and again with edification and interest: From the point of psychology, 
from the point of jurisprudence, from the point of history, it is supreme. 
It has hardly too much to say that later writers, great as they are, have 
done little more than draw from the seemingly inexhaustible wells of wisdom 
which the two Dominicans, Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger, have given us 
in the <I>Malleus Maleficarum</I>.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
What is most surprising is the modernity of the book. There is hardly a 
problem, a complex, a difficulty, which they have not foreseen, and discussed, 
and resolved.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Here are cases which occur in the law-courts to-day, set out with the 
greatest clarity, argued with unflinching logic, and judged with scrupulous 
impartiality.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It is a work which must irresistibly capture the attention of all mean who 
think, all who see, or are endeavouring to see, the ultimate reality beyond 
the accidents of matter, time and space.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The <I>Malleus Maleficarum</I> is one of the world's few books written 
<I>sub specie aeternitatis</I>.
