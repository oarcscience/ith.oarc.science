<H2>Question XXII</H2>
<H3>Of the Third Kind of Sentence, to be Pronounced on one who is Defamed, and who is to be put to the Question</H3></CENTER>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
THE Third method of bringing a process on behalf of the faith to 
a conclusive termination is when the person accused of heresy, 
after a careful consideration of the merits of the process in 
consultation with learned lawyers, is found to be inconsistent in 
his statements, or is found that there are sufficient grounds to 
warrant his exposure to the question and torture: so that if, 
after he has been thus questioned, he confesses nothing, he may 
be considered innocent. And this is when the prisoner has not 
been taken in heresy, nor has he been convicted by his own 
confession, or by the evidence of the facts, or by the legitimate 
production of witnesses, and there are no indications that he is 
under such a suspicion as to warrant his being made to abjure the 
heresy; but nevertheless he is inconsistent in his answers when 
interrogated. Or there may be other sufficient reasons for 
exposing him to torture. And in such a case the following 
procedure is to be observed.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And because such a judgement in includes an interlocutory 
sentence which must be against and not for the prisoner, the 
Inquisitor must not divide it into two sentences, but include it 
all in one. And in the first place, if the accused remains firm 
in his denials and can in no way be induced by honest men to 
confess the truth, the following manner of sentence, which is in 
some respects definitive, shall be used.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a town, or Judge in the 
territory subject to the rule of such a Prince, having regard to 
the merits of the process conducted by us against you N., of such 
a place in such a Diocese, and after careful examination, find 
that you are not consistent in your answers, and that there are 
sufficient indications besides that you ought to be exposed to 
the question and torture. Therefore, that the truth may be known 
from your own mouth and that from henceforth you may not offend 
the ears of your Judges with your equivocations, we declare, 
pronounce, and give sentence that on this present day at such an 
hour you are to be subjected to an interrogatory under torture. 
This sentence was given, etc.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
If the person to be questioned is both found to be equivocal and 
at the same time there are other indications sufficient to 
warrant his being tortured, let both these facts be included in 
the sentence, as they are above. But if only one or the other of 
these hold good, let that one only be put in the sentence. But 
let the sentence be soon put into execution, or let them make as 
if to execute it. Nevertheless let not the Judge be too willing 
to subject a person to torture, for this should only be resorted 
to in default of other proofs. Therefore let him seek for other 
proofs; and if he cannot find them, and thinks it probable that 
the accused is guilty, but denied the truth out of fear, let him 
use other approved methods, always with due precautions, and by 
using the persuasions of the friends of the accused do his utmost 
to extract the truth from his own lips. And let him not hasten 
the business; for very often meditation, and the ordeal of 
imprisonment, and the repeated persuasion of honest men will 
induce the accused to discover the truth.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But if, after keeping the accused in 
suspense, and after due and decent postponements of the time, and 
many exhortations of the accused, the Bishop and the Judge are 
well persuaded that, all circumstances considered, the accused is 
denying the truth, let them torture him slightly, without 
shedding blood, bearing in mind that torture is often fallacious 
and ineffective. For some are so soft-hearted and feeble-minded 
that at the least torture they will confess anything, whether it 
be true or not. Others are so stubborn that, however much they 
are tortured, the truth is not to be had from them. There are 
others who, having been tortured before, are the better able to 
endure it a second time, since their arms have been accomodated 
to the stretchings and twistings involved; whereas the effect on 
others is to make them weaker, so that they can the less easily 
endure torture. Others are bewitched, and make use of the fact in 
their torture, so that they will die before the will confess 
anything; for they become, as it were, insensible to pain. 
Therefore there is need for much prudence in the matter of 
torture, and the greatest attention is to be given to the 
condition of the person who is to be tortured.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
When, then, the sentence has been pronounced, the officers shall 
without delay prepare to torture the accused. And while they are 
making their preparations, the Bishop or Judge shall use his own 
persuasions and those of other honest men zealous for the faith 
to induce the accused to confess the truth freely, if necessary 
promising to spare his life, as we have shown above.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if the accused cannot thus be terrified into telling the 
truth, a second or third day may be appointed for the 
continuation of the torture; but it must not be repeated then and 
there. For such a repetition is not permissible unless some 
further indications against the accused should transpire. But 
there is nothing to prevent a continuation of the torture on 
another day.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let it be said: We N. Bishop and N. 
Judge (if he is present) aforesaid, assign to you N. such a day 
for the continuation of the torture, that the truth may be known 
from your own mouth. And let all be set down in the process. And 
during the interval appointed to him, let them use their own 
persuasions and those of other honest men to induce him to 
confess the truth.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if he has refused to confess, the torture can be continued on 
the day assigned, more or less severely according to the gravity 
of the offences in question. And the Judges will be able to 
observe many lawful precautions, both in word and deed, by which 
they may come at the truth; but these are more easily learned by 
use and experience and the variety of different cases than by the 
art of teaching of anyone.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if, after having been fittingly questioned and tortured, he 
will not discover the truth, let him not be further molested, but 
be freely allowed to depart. If, however, he confesses, and 
abides by his confession, and uncovers the truth, acknowledging 
his guilt and asking the pardon of the Church; then according to 
the Canon <I>ad abolendam</I> he is to be treated as one taken in 
heresy on his own confession, but penitent, and he must abjure 
the heresy, and sentence must be pronounced against him as in the 
case of those who are convicted by their own confession as being 
taken in heresy. This will be explained in the eighth method of 
sentencing such, to which the reader may refer.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
If, on the other hand, he confesses the truth, but is not 
penitent but obstinately persists in his heresy, but is not a 
relapsed heretic, then according to the Canon, after a decent 
interval and due warning, he is to be condemned as a heretic and 
handed over to the secular Court to suffer the extreme penalty, 
as we show later in the tenth method. But if he is a relapsed 
heretic, he is to be condemned in the way which is again 
explained in the tenth method, to which the reader may refer.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But here it must be particularly noted that in some instances he 
who is to be questioned confesses nothing against himself before 
the torture, nor is anything proved on the strength of which he 
can be required to abjure the heresy or be condemned as a 
heretic; and in such cases the above procedure should be adopted, 
as we have said, immediately. But in other cases the accused is 
taken in heresy, or he is to be considered either lightly or 
strongly suspected; and he is not to be tortured in respect of 
such matters; but if, apart from these, he denies some points 
which are not proved, but of which there is sufficient indication 
to warrant his being tortured; and if, having been questioned as 
to these under torture, he confesses to none of them, he is not 
on that account to be absolved in accordance with the first 
method; but he must be proceeded against according to that which 
has been proved against him, and he or she must abjure the heresy 
as being one under suspicion of or taken in heresy, as the merits 
of the process may exact or require. And if, after torture, he 
confesses all or part of that for which he was tortured, then he 
must abjure both this and the former heresy which was proved 
against him, and sentence must be pronounced against him in 
respect of both of these.
