# Malleus Maleficarum Part 2

## Chapter VI

### Prescribed Remedies; to wit, the Lawful Exorcisms of the Church, for all Sorts of Infirmities and Ills due to Witchcraft; and the Method of Exorcising those who are Bewitched.

        It has already been stated that witches can afflict men with
every kind of physical infirmity; therefore it can be taken as a general
rule that the various verbal or practical remedies which can be applied
in the case of those infirmities which we have just been discussing are
equally applicable to all other infirmities, such as epilepsy or
leprosy, for example. And as lawful exorcisms are reckoned among the
verbal remedies and have been most often considered by us, they may be
taken as a general type of such remedies; and there are three matters to
be considered regarding them.  
        First, we must judge whether a person who has not been ordained
as an exorcist, such as a layman or a secular cleric, may lawfully
exorcise devils and their works. Bound up with this question are three
others: namely; first, what constitutes the legality of this practice;
secondly, the seven conditions which must be observed when one wishes to
make private use of charms and benedictions; and thirdly, in what way
the disease is to be exorcised and the devil conjured.  
        Secondly, we must consider what is to be done when no healing
grace results from the exorcism.  
        Thirdly, we must consider practical and not verbal remedies;
together with the solution of certain arguments.  
        For the first, we have the opinion of S. Thomas in Book IV,
dist. 23. He says: When a man is ordained as an exorcist, or into any of
the other minor Orders, he has conferred upon him the power of exorcism
in his official capacity; and this power may even lawfully be used by
those who belong to no Order, but such do not exercise it in their
official capacity. Similarly the Mass can be said in an unconsecrated
house, although the very purpose of consecrating a church is that the
Mass may be said there; but this is more on account of the grace which
is in the righteous than of the grace of the Sacrament.  
        From these words we may conclude that, although it is good that
in the liberation of a bewitched person recourse should be had to an
exorcist having authority to exorcise such bewitchments, yet at times
other devout persons may, either with or without any exorcism, cast out
this sort of diseases.  
        For we hear of a certain poor and very devout virgin, one of
whose friends has been grievously bewitched in his foot, so that it was
clear to the physicians that he could be cured by no medicines. But it
happened that the virgin went to visit the sick man, and he at once
begged her to apply some benediction to his foot. She consented, and did
no more than silently say the Lord's Prayer and the Apostles' Creed, at
the same time making use of the sign of the life-giving Cross. The sick
man then felt himself at once cured, and, that he might have a remedy
for the future, asked the virgin what charms she had used. But she
answered: You are of little faith and do not hold to the holy and lawful
practices of the Church, and you often apply forbidden charms and
remedies for your infirmities; therefore you are rarely healthy in your
body, because you are always sick in your soul. But if you would put
your trust in prayer and in the efficacy of lawful symbols, you will
often be very easily cured. For I did nothing but repeat the Lord's
Prayer and the Apostles' Creed, and you are now cured.  
        This example gives rise to the question, whether there is not
any efficacy in other benedictions and charms, and even conjurations by
way of exorcism; for they seem to be condemned in this story. We answer
that the virgin condemned only unlawful charms and unlawful conjurations
and exorcisms.  
        To understand these last we must consider how they originated,
and how they came to be abused. For they were in their origin entirely
sacred; but just as by the means of devils and wicked men all things can
be defiled, so also were these sacred words. For it is said in the last
chapter of S. Mark, of the Apostles and holy men: In My Name shall they
cast out devils; and they visited the sick, and prayed over them with
sacred words; and in after times priests devoutly used similar rites;
and therefore there are to be found to-day in ancient Churches devout
prayers and holy exorcisms which men can use or undergo, when they are
applied by pious men as they used to be, without any superstition; even
as there are now to be found learned men and Doctors of holy Theology
who visit the sick and use such words for the healing not only of
demoniacs, but of other diseases as well.  
        But, alas! superstitious men have, on the pattern of these,
found for themselves many vain and unlawful remedies which they employ
these days for sick men and animals; and the clergy have become too
slothful to use any more the lawful words when they visit the sick. On
this account Gulielmus Durandus, the commentator on S. Raymond, says
that such lawful exorcisms may be used by a religious and discreet
priest, or by a layman, or even by a woman of good life and proved
discretion; by the offering of lawful prayers over the sick: not over
fruits or animals, but over the sick. For the Gospel says: They shall
place their hands upon the sick, etc. And such persons are not to be
prevented from practising in this way; unless perhaps it is feared that,
following their example, other indiscreet and superstitious persons
should make improper use of incantations. It is these superstitious
diviners whom that virgin we have mentioned condemned, when she said
that they who consulted with such had weak, that is to say bad, faith.  
        Now for the elucidation of this matter it is asked how it is
possible to know whether the words of such charms and benedictions are
lawful or superstitious, and how they ought to be used; and whether the
devil can be conjured and diseases exorcised.  
        In the first place, that is said to be lawful in the Christian
religion which is not superstitious; and that is said to be
superstitious which is over and above the prescribed form of religion.
See *Colossians* ii: which things indeed have a show of wisdom in
superstition: on which the gloss says: Superstition is undisciplined
religion, that is, religion observed with defective methods in evil
circumstance.  
        Anything, also, is superstition which human tradition without
higher authority has caused to usurp the name of religion; such is the
interpolation of hymns at Holy Mass, the alteration of the Preface for
Requiems, the abbreviation of the Creed which it to be sung at Mass, the
reliance upon an organ rather than upon the choir for the music, neglect
to have a Server on the Altar, and such practices. But to return to our
point, when a work is done by virtue of the Christian religion, as when
someone wishes to heal the sick by means of prayer and benediction and
sacred words, which is the matter we are considering), such a person
must observe seven conditions by which such benedictions are rendered
lawful. And even if he uses adjurations, through the virtue of the
Divine Name, and by the virtue of the works of Christ, His Birth,
Passion and Precious Death, by which the devil was conquered and cast
out; such benedictions and charms and exorcisms shall be called lawful,
and they who practise them are exorcists or lawful enchanters. See S.
Isidore, *Etym*. VIII, Enchanters are they whose art and skill lies in
the use of words.  
        And the first of these conditions, as we learn from S. Thomas,
is that there must be nothing in the words which hints at any expressed
or tacit invocation of devils. If such were expressed, it would be
obviously unlawful. If it were tacit, it might be considered in the
light of intention, or in that of fact: in that of intention, when the
operator has no care whether it is God or the devil who is helping him,
so long as he attains his desired result; in that of fact, when a person
has no natural aptitude for such work, but creates some artificial
means. And of such not only must physicians and astronomers be the
judges, but especially Theologians. For in this way do necromancers
work, making images and rings and stones by artificial means; which have
no natural virtue to effect the results which they very often expect:
therefore the devil must be concerned in their works.  
        Secondly, the benedictions or charms must contain no unknown
names; for according to S. John Chrysostom such are to be regarded with
fear, lest they should conceal some matter of superstition.  
        Thirdly, there must be nothing in the words that is untrue; for
if there is, the effect of them cannot be from God, Who is not a witness
to a lie. But some old women in their incantations use some such
jingling doggerel as the following:

Blessed MARY went a-walking  
Over Jordan river.  
Stephen met her, and fell a-talking, etc.

        Fourthly, there must be no vanities, or written characters
beyond the sign of the Cross. Therefore the charms which soldiers are
wont to carry are condemned.  
        Fifthly, no faith must be placed in the method of writing or
reading or binding the charm about a person, or in any such vanity,
which has nothing to do with the reverence of God, without which a charm
is altogether superstitious.  
        Sixthly, in the citing and uttering of Divine words and of Holy
Scripture attention must only be paid to the sacred words themselves and
their meaning, and to the reverence of God; whether the effect be looked
for from the Divine virtue, or from the relics of Saints, which are a
secondary power, since their virtue springs originally from God.  
        Seventhly, the looked-for effect must be left tot he Divine
Will; for He knows whether it is best for a man to be healed or to be
plagued, or to die. This condition was set down by S. Thomas.  
        So we may conclude that if none of these conditions be broken,
the incantation will be lawful. And S. Thomas writes in this connexion
on the last chapter of *S. Mark:* And these signs shall follow them that
believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall take up
serpents. From this it is clear that, provided the above conditions are
observed, it is lawful by means of sacred words to keep serpents away.  
        S. Thomas says further: The words of God are not less holy than
the Relics of the Saints. As S. Augustine says: The word of God is not
less than the Body of Christ. But all are agreed that it is lawful to
carry reverently about the person the Relics of the Saints: therefore
let us by all means invoke the name of God by duly using the Lord's
Prayer and the Angelic Salutation, by His Birth and Passion, by His Five
Wounds, and by the Seven Words which He spoke on the Cross, by the
Triumphant Inscription, by the three nails, and by the other weapons of
Christ's army against the devil and his works. By all these means it is
lawful to work, and our trust may be placed in them, leaving the issue
to God's will.  
        And what has been said about the keeping off of serpents applies
also to other animals, provided that the attention is fixed only on the
sacred words and the Divine virtue. But great care is to be used in
incantations of this nature. For S. Thomas says: Such diviners often use
unlawful observances, and obtain magic effects by means of devils,
especially in the case of serpents; for the serpent was the devil's
first instrument by which he deceived mankind.  
        For in the town of Salzburg there was a certain mage who one
day, in open view of all, wanted to charm all the snakes into a
particular pit, and kill them all within an area of a mile. So he
gathered all the snakes together, and was himself standing over the pit,
when last of all there came a huge and horrible serpent which would not
go into the pit. This serpent kept making signs to the man to let it go
away and crawl where it would; but he would not cease from his
incantation, but insisted that, as all the other snakes had entered the
pit and there died, so also must this horrible serpent. But it stood on
the opposite side to the warlock, and suddenly leapt over the pit and
fell upon the man, wrapping itself round his belly, and dragged him with
itself into the pit, where they both died. From this it may be seen that
only for a useful purpose, such as driving them away from men's houses,
are such incantations to be practised, and they are to be done by the
Divine virtue, and in the fear of God, and with reverence.  
        In the second place we have to consider how exorcisms or charms
of this kind ought to be used, and whether they should be worn round the
neck or sewn into the clothing. It may seem that such practices are
unlawful; for S. Augustine says, in the *Second Book on the Christian
Doctrine:* There are a thousand magic devices and amulets and charms
which are all superstitious, and the School of Medicine utterly condemns
them all, whether they are incantations, or certain marks which are
called characters, or engraved charms to be hung round the neck.  
        Also S. John Chrysostom, commenting on *S. Matthew*, says: Some
persons wear round their neck some written portion of the Gospel; but is
not the Gospel every day read in the church and heard by all? How then
shall a man be helped by wearing the Gospel round his neck, when he has
reaped no benefit from hearing it with his ears? For in what does the
virtue of the Gospel consist; in the characters of its letters, or in
the meaning of its words? If in the characters, you do well to hang it
round your neck; but if in the meaning, surely it is of more benefit
when planted in the heart than when worn round the neck.
