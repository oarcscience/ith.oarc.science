# Malleus Maleficarum Part 3

## Question XXVI

### The Method of passing Sentence upon one who is both Suspect and Defamed

        THE seventh method of bringing to a conclusion a process on
behalf of the faith is employed when the person accused of the sin of
heresy, after a careful examination of the merits of the process in
consultation with men learned in the law, is found to be both suspected
and defamed of heresy. And this is when the accused is not legally
convicted by his own confession or by the evidence of the facts or by
the legitimate production of witnesses; but is found to be publicly
defamed, and there are also other indications which render him lightly
or strongly suspected of heresy: as that he has held much familiarity
with heretics. And such a person must, because of his defamation,
undergo a canonical purgation; and because of the suspicion against him
he must abjure the heresy.  
        The procedure in such a case will be as follows. Such a person,
being publicly defamed for heresy, and being in addition to this
suspected of heresy by reason of certain other indications, shall first
publicly purge himself in the manner which we explained in the second
method. Having performed this purgation, he shall immediately, as one
against whom there are other indications of the suspected heresy, abjure
that heresy in the following manner, having before him, as before, the
Book of the Gospels:  
        I., N., of such a place in such a Diocese, standing my trial in
person before you my Lords, N., Bishop of such city and Judge in the
territory of such Prince, having touched with my hands the Holy Gospels
placed before me, swear that I believe in my heart and profess with my
lips that Holy Apostolic Faith which the Roman Church believes,
professes, preaches and observes. And consequently I abjure, detest,
renounce and revoke every heresy which rears itself up against the Holy
and Apostolic Church, of whatever sect or error it be, etc., as above.  
        Also I swear and promise that I will never hereafter do or say
or cause to be done such and such (naming them), for which I am justly
defamed as having committed them, and of which you hold be suspected.
Also I swear and promise that I will perform to the best of my strength
every penance which you impose on me, nor will I omit any part of it, so
help me God and this Holy Gospel. And if hereafter I should act in any
way contrary to this oath and abjuration (which God forbid), I here and
now freely submit, oblige, and bind myself to the legal punishment for
such, to the limit of sufferance, when it shall have been proved that I
have committed such things.  
        But it must be noted that when the indications are so strong as
to render the accused, either with or without the aforesaid defamation,
strongly suspected of heresy, then he shall, as above, abjure all heresy
in general. And if he relapsed into any heresy, he shall suffer the due
punishment of a backslider. But if the indications are so small and
slight as, even taken together with the said defamation, not to render
him strongly, but only lightly, suspected of heresy, then it is enough
if he makes not a general abjuration, but specifically abjures that
heresy of which he is suspected; so that, if he were to relapse into
another form of heresy, he would not be liable to the penalty for
backsliders. And even if he were to relapse into the same heresy which
he had abjured, he would still not be liable to the said penalty,
although he would be more severely punished than would have been the
case if he had not abjured.  
        But there is a doubt whether he would be liable to the penalty
for backsliders if, after his canonical purgation, he should relapse
into the same heresy of which he was canonically purged. And it would
seem that this would be so, from the Canon Law, c. *excommunicamus* and
c. *ad abolendam*. Therefore the Notary must take great care to set it
down whether such a person has made his abjuration as one under a light
or a strong suspicion of heresy; for, as we have often said, there is a
great difference between these. And when this has been done, sentence or
penance shall be pronounced in the following manner:  
        We., N., Bishop of such city or Judge in the territories of such
Prince, having diligently in mind that you, N., of such a place in such
a Diocese, have been accused before us of such heresy (naming it); and
wishing to inquire judicially whether you have fallen into the said
heresy, by examining witnesses, by summoning and questioning you upon
oath, and by all convenient means in our power, we have acted and
proceeded as it behoved.  
        Having digested, observed and diligently inspected all the
facts, and having discussed the merits of the process of this case,
examining al and singular which has been done and said, and having
consulted with and obtained the mature opinion of many learned
Theologians and lawyers, we find that you have been in such place or
places publicly defamed by good and sober men for the said heresy;
wherefore, as we are bidden by the canonical institutions, we have
imposed upon you a canonical purgation by which you and your sponsors
have here publicly purged yourself before us. We find also that you have
committed such and such (naming them), by reason of which we have just
cause t hold you strongly or lightly (let it be said whether it is one
or the other) suspected of the said heresy; and therefore we have caused
you to abjure heresy as one under such suspicion (here, if he has
abjured as one under strong suspicion, let them say “all heresy”; and if
as one under light suspicion, “the said heresy”).  
        But because we cannot and must not in any way tolerate that
which you have done, but are in justice compelled to abominate it, that
you may become more careful in the future, and that your crimes may not
remain unpunished, and that others may not be encouraged to fall into
the like sins, and that the injuries to the Creator may not easily be
passed over: Therefore against you, N., having so purged yourself and
abjured, standing personally in our presence in this place at the time
which was assigned to you, We, the aforesaid Bishop or Judge, sitting in
tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy Gospels that our
judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and our eyes see
with equity, pronounce sentence or penance in the following manner,
namely, that you must, etc.  
        And let them pronounce sentence as shall seem most to the honour
of the faith and the extermination of the sin of heresy: as that on
certain Sundays and Festivals he must stand at the door of such a
church, holding a candle of such a weight, during the solemnization of
Holy Mass, with head uncovered and bare feet, and offer the said candle
at the altar; and that he must fast on Fridays, and that for a certain
period he must not dare to depart from that place, but present himself
before the Bishop or Judge on certain days of the week; and any similar
penance which seemed to be demanded by the particular nature of his
guilt; for it is impossible to give a hard-and-fast rule. This sentence
was given, etc. And let it be put into execution after it has been
pronounced; and it can be cancelled, mitigated or changed as may be
required by the condition of the penitent and for his correction and
humiliation; for the Bishop has this power by law.
