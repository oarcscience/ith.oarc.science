# Malleus Maleficarum Part 3

## Question III

### Of the Solemn Adjuration and Re-examination of Witnesses

        But it may be asked whether the Judge can compel witnesses to
sweat an oath to tell the truth in a case concerning the Faith or
witches, of if he can examine them many times. We answer that he can do
so, especially an ecclesiastical Judge, and that in ecclesiastical cases
witnesses can be compelled to speak the truth, and this on oath, since
otherwise their evidence would not be valid. For the Canon Law says: The
Archbishop or Bishop may make a circuit of the parish in which it is
rumoured that there are heretics, and compel three or more men of good
repute, or even, if it seems good to him, the whole neighbourhood, to
give evidence. And if any through damnable obstinacy stubbornly refuse
to take the oath, they shall on that account be considered as
heretics.  
        And that the witnesses can be examined several times is shown by
the Canon, where it says that, when the witnesses have given their
evidence in a confused manner, or appear to have withheld part of their
knowledge for some reason, the Judge must take care to examine them
afresh; for he may legally do so.
