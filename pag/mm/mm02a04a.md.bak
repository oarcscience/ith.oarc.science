# Malleus Maleficarum Part 2

## Chapter IV

### Here follows the Way whereby Witches copulate with those Devils known as Incubi.

        As to the method in which witches copulate with Incubus devils,
six points are to be noted. First, as to the devil and the body which he
assumes, of what element it is formed. Second, as to the act, whether it
is always accompanied with the injection of semen received from some
other man. Third, as to the time and place, whether one time is more
favourable than another for this practice. Fourth, whether the act is
visible to the women, and whether only those who were begotten in this
way are so visited by devils. Fifth, whether it applies only to those
who were offered to the devil at birth by midwives. Sixth, whether the
actual venereal pleasure is greater or less in this act. And we will
speak first of the matter and quality of the body which the devil
assumes.  
        It must be said that he assumes an aerial body, and that it is
in some respects terrestrial, in so far as it has an earthly property
through condensation; and this is explained as follows. The air cannot
of itself take definite shape, except the shape of some other body in
which it is included. And in that case it is not bound by its own
limits, but by those of something else; and one part of the air
continues into the next part. Therefore he cannot simply assume an
aerial body as such.  
        Know, moreover, that the air is in every way a most changeable
and fluid matter: and a sign of this is the fact that when any have
tried to cut or pierce with a sword the body assumed by a devil, they
have not been able to; for the divided parts of the air at once join
together again. From this it follows that air is in itself a very
competent matter, but because it cannot take shape unless some other
terrestrial matter is joined with it, therefore it is necessary that the
air which forms the devil's assumed body should be in some way
inspissated, and approach the property of the earth, while still
retaining its true property as air. And devils and disembodied spirits
can effect this condensation by means of gross vapours raised from the
earth, and by collecting them together into shapes in which they abide,
not as defilers of them, but only as their motive power which give to
that body the formal appearance of life, in very much the same way as
the soul informs the body to which it is joined. They are, moreover, in
these assumed and shaped bodies like a sailor in a ship which the wind
moves.  
        So when it is asked of what sort is the body assumed by the
devil, it is to be said that with regard to its material, it is one
thing to speak of the beginning of its assumption, and another thing to
speak of its end. For in the beginning it is just air; but in the end it
is inspisated air, partaking of some of the properties of the earth. And
all this the devils, with God's permission, can do of their own nature;
for the spiritual nature is superior to the bodily. Therefore the bodily
nature must obey the devils in respect of local motion, though not in
respect of the assumption of natural shapes, either accidental or
substantial, except in the case of some small creatures (and then only
with the help of some other agent, as has been hinted before). But as to
local motion, no shape is beyond their power; thus they can move them as
they wish, in such circumstances as they will.  
        From this there may arise an incidental question as to what
should be thought when a good or bad Angel performs some of the
functions of life by means of true natural bodies, and not in aerial
bodies; as in the case of Balaam's ass, through which the Angel spoke,
and when the devils take possession of bodies. It is to be said that
those bodies are not called assumed, but occupied. See S. Thomas, II. 8,
Whether Angels assume bodies. But let us keep strictly to our
argument.  
        In what way is it to be understood that devils talk with
witches, see them, hear them, eat with them, and copulate with them? And
this is the second part of this first difficulty.  
        For the first, it is to be said that three things are required
for true conversation: namely, lungs to draw in the air; and this is not
only for the sake of producing sound, but also to cool the heart; and
even mutes have this necessary quality.  
        Secondly, it is necessary that some percussion be made of a body
in the air, as a greater or less sound is made when one beats wood in
the airs, or rings a bell. For when a substance that is susceptible to
sound is struck by a sound-producing instrument, it gives out a sound
according to its size, which is received in the air and multiplied to
the ears of the hearer, to whom, if he is far off, it seems to come
through space.  
        Thirdly, a voice is required; and it may be said that what is
called Sound in inanimate bodies is called Voice in living bodies. And
here the tongue strikes the respirations of air against an instrument or
living natural organ provided by God. And this is not a bell, which is
called a sound, whereas this is a voice. And this third requisite may
clearly be exemplified by the second; and I have set this down that
preachers may have a method of teaching the people.  
        And fourthly, it is necessary that he who forms the voice should
mean to express by means of that voice some concept of the mind to
someone else, and that he should himself understand what he is saying;
and so manage his voice by successively striking his teeth with his
tongue in his mouth, by opening and shutting his lips, and by sending
the air struck in his mouth into the outer air, that in this way the
sound is reproduced in order in the ears of the hearer, who then
understands his meaning.  
        To return to the point. Devils have no lungs or tongue, though
they can show the latter, as well as teeth and lips, artificially made
according to the condition of their body; therefore they cannot truly
and properly speak. But since they have understanding, and when they
wish to express their meaning, then, by some disturbance of the air
included in their assumed body, not of air breathed in and out as in the
case of men, they produce, not voices, but sounds which have some
likeness to voices, and send them articulately through the outside air
to the ears of the hearer. And that the likeness of a voice can be made
without respiration of air is clear from the case of other animals which
do not breathe, but are said to made a sound, as do also certain other
instruments, as Aristotle says in the *de Anima*. For certain fishes,
when they are caught, suddenly utter a cry outside the water, and die.  
        All this is applicable to what follows, so far as the point
where we treat of the generative function, but not as regards good
Angels. If anyone wishes to inquire further into the matter of devils
speaking in possessed bodies, he may refer to S. Thomas in the *Second
Book of Sentences*, dist. 8, art. 5. For in that case they use the
bodily organs of the possessed body; since they occupy those bodies in
respect of the limits of their corporeal quantity, but not in respect of
the limits of their essence, either of the body or of the soul. Observe
a distinction between substance and quantity, or accident. But this is
impertinent.  
        For now we must say in what manner they see and hear. Now sight
is of two kinds, spiritual and corporeal, and the former infinitely
excels the latter; for it can penetrate, and is not hindered by
distance, owing to the faculty of light of which it makes use. Therefore
it must be said that in no way does an Angel, either good or bad, see
with the eyes of its assumed body, nor does it use any bodily property
as it does in speaking, when it uses the air and the vibration of the
air to produce sound which becomes reproduced in the ears of the hearer.
Wherefore their eyes are painted eyes. And they freely appear to men in
these likenesses that they may manifest to them their natural properties
and converse with them spiritually by these means.  
        For with this purpose the holy Angels have often appeared to the
Fathers at the command of God and with His permission. And the bad
angels manifest themselves to wicked men in order that men, recognizing
their qualities, may associate themselves with them, here in sin, and
elsewhere in punishment.  
        S. Dionysius, at the end of his *Celestial Hierarchy*, says: In
all parts of the human body the Angel teaches us to consider their
properties: concluding that since corporeal vision is an operation of
the living body through a bodily organ, which devils lack, therefore in
their assumed bodies, just as they have the likeness of limbs, so that
have the likeness of their functions.  
        And we can speak in the same way of their hearing, which is far
finer than that of the body; for it can know the concept of the mind and
the conversation of the soul more subtly than can a man by hearing the
mental concept through the medium of spoken words. See S. Thomas, the
*Second Book of Sentences*, dist. 8. For if the secret wishes of a man
are read in his face, and physicians can tell the thoughts of the heart
from the heart-beats and the state of the pulse, all the more can such
things be known by devils.  
        And we may say as to eating, that in the complete act of eating
there are four processes. Mastication in the mouth, swallowing into the
stomach, digestion in the stomach, and fourthly, metabolism of the
necessary nutriment and ejection of what is superflous. All Angels can
perform the first two processes fo eating in their assumed bodies, but
not the third and fourth; but instead of digesting and ejecting they
have another power by which the food is suddenly dissolved in the
surrounding matter. In Christ the process of eating was in all respects
complete, since He had the nutritive and metabolistic powers; not, be it
said, for the purpose of converting food into His own body, for those
power were, like His body, glorified; so that the food was suddenly
dissolved in His body, as when one throws water on to fire.

*How in Modern Time Witches perform the Carnal Act with Incubus
Devils,  
and how they are Multiplied by this Means.*

        But no difficulty arises out of what has been said, with regard
to our principal subject, which is the carnal act which Incubi in an
assumed body perform with witches: unless perhaps anyone doubts whether
modern witches practise such abominable coitus; and whether witches had
their origin in this abomination.  
        In answering these two doubts we shall say, as to the former of
them, something of the activities of the witches who lived in olden
times, about 1400 years before the Incarnation of Our Lord. It is, for
example, unknown whether they were addicted to these filthy practises as
modern witches have been since that time; for so far as we know history
tells us nothing on this subject. But no one who reads the histories can
doubt that there have always been witches, and that by their evil works
much harm has been done to men, animals, and the fruits of the earth,
and that Incubus and Succubus devils have always existed; for the
traditions of the Canons and the holy Doctors have left and handed down
to posterity many things concerning them through many hundreds of years.
Yet there is this difference, that in times long past the Incubus devils
used to infest women against their wills, as is often shown by Nider in
his *Formicarius*, and by Thomas of Brabant in his book on the
*Universal Good*, or on *Bees*.  
        But the theory that modern witches are tainted with this sort of
diabolic filthiness is not substantiated only in our opinion, since the
expert testimony of the witches themselves has made all these things
credible; and that they do not now, as in times past, subject themselves
unwillingly, but willingly embrace this most foul and miserable
servitude. For how many women have be left to be punished by secular law
in various dioceses, especially in Constance and the town of Ratisbon,
who have been for many years addicted to these abominations, some from
their twentieth and some from their twelfth or thirteenth year, and
always with a total or partial abnegation of the Faith? All the
inhabitants of those places are witnesses of it. For without reckoning
those who secretly repented, and those who returned to the Faith, no
less than forty-eight have been burned in five years. And there was no
question of credulity in accepting their stories because they turned to
free repentance; for they all agreed in this, namely, that there were
bound to indulge in these lewd practices in order that the ranks of
their perfidy might be increased. But we shall treat of these
individually in the Second Part of this work, where their particular
deeds are described; omitting those which came under the notice of our
colleague the Inquisitor of Como in the County of Burbia, who in the
space of one year, which was the year of grace 1485, caused forty-one
witches to be burned; who all publicly affirmed, as it is said, that
they had practised these abominations with devils. Therefore this matter
is fully substantiated by eye-witnesses, by hearsay, and the testimony
of credible witnesses.  
        As for the second doubt, whether witches had their origin from
these abominations, we may say with S. Augustine that it is true that
all the superstitious arts had their origin in a pestilent association
of men with devils. For he says so in his work *On the Christian
Doctrine:* All this sort of practices, whether of trifling or of noxious
superstition, arose from some pestilent association of men with devils,
as though some pact of infidel and guileful friendship had been formed,
and they are all utterly to be repudiated. Notice here that it is
manifest that, as there are various kinds of superstition or magic arts,
and various societies of those who practise them; and as among the
fourteen kinds of that art the species of witches is the worst, since
they have not a tacit but an overt and expressed pact with the devil,
and more than this, have to acknowledge a form of devil-worship through
abjuring the Faith; therefore it follows that witches hold the worst
kind of association with devils, with especial reference to the
behaviour of women, who always delight in vain things.

Witches commonly perform their Spells through the Sacraments of the
Church. And how they Impair the Powers of Generation, and how they may
Cause other Ills to happen to God's Creatures of all kinds. But herein
we except the Question of the Influence of the Stars.
