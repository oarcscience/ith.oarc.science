# Malleus Maleficarum Part 1

## Question VI

### Concerning Witches who copulate with Devils. Why is it that Women are chiefly addicted to Evil superstitions?

        There is also, concerning witches who copulate with devils, much
difficulty in considering the methods by which such abominations are
consummated. On the part of the devil: first, of what element the body
is made that he assumes; secondly, whether the act is always accompanied
by the injection of semen received from another; thirdly, as to time and
place, whether he commits this act more frequently at one time than at
another; fourthly, whether the act is invisible to any who may be
standing by. And on the part of the women, it has to be inquired whether
only they who were themselves conceived in this filthy manner are often
visited by devils; or secondly, whether it is those who were offered to
devils by midwives at the time of their birth; and thirdly, whether the
actual venereal delectation of such is of a weaker sort. But we cannot
here reply to all these questions, both because we are only engaged in a
general study, and because in the second part of this work they are all
singly explained by their operations, as will appear in the fourth
chapter, where mention is made of each separate method. Therefore, let
us now chiefly consider women; and first, why this kind of perfidy is
found more in so fragile a sex than in men. And our inquiry will first
be general, as to the general conditions of women; secondly, particular,
as to which sort of women are found to be given to superstition and
witchcraft; and thirdly, specifically with regard to midwives, who
surpass all others in wickedness.

*Why Superstition is chiefly found in Women.*

        As for the first question, why a greater number of witches is
found in the fragile feminine sex than among men; it is indeed a fact
that it were idle to contradict, since it is accredited by actual
experience, apart from the verbal testimony of credibly witnesses. And
without in any way detracting from a sex in which God has always taken
great glory that His might should be spread abroad, let us say that
various men have assigned various reasons for this fact, which
nevertheless agree in principle. Wherefore it is good, for the
admonition of women, to speak of this matter; and it has often been
proved by experience that they are eager to hear of it, so long as it is
set forth with discretion.  
        For some learned men propound this reason; that there are three
things in nature, the Tongue, an Ecclesiastic, and a Woman, which know
no moderation in goodness or vice; and when they exceed the bounds of
their condition they reach the greatest heights and the lowest depths of
goodness and vice. When they are governed by a good spirit, they are
most excellent in virtue; but when they are governed by an evil spirit,
they indulge the worst possible vices.  
        This is clear in the case of the tongue, since by its ministry
most of the kingdoms have been brought into the faith of Christ; and the
Holy Ghost appeared over the Apostles of Christ in tongues of fire.
Other learned preachers also have had as it were the tongues of dogs,
licking wounds and sores of the dying Lazarus. As it is said: With the
tongues of dogs ye save your souls from the enemy.  
        For this reason S. Dominic, the leader and father of the Order
of Preachers, is represented in the figure of a barking to dog with a
lighted torch in his mouth, that even to this day he may by his barking
keep off the heretic wolves from the flock of Christ's sheep.  
        It is also a matter of common experience that the tongue of one
prudent man can subdue the wrangling of a multitude; wherefore not
unjustly Solomon sings much in their praise, in *Proverbs* x.: In the
lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found. And again, The
tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is
little worth. And again, The lips of the righteous feed many; but fools
die for want of wisdom. For this cause he adds in chapter xvi, The
preparations of the heart belong to man; but the answer of the tongue is
from the Lord.  
        But concerning an evil tongue you will find in *Ecclesiasticus*
xxviii: A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from
nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, and overthrown the
houses of great men. And by a backbiting tongue it means a third party
who rashly or spitefully interferes between two contending parties.  
        Secondly, concerning Ecclesiastics, that is to say, clerics and
religious of either sex, S. John Chrysostom speaks on the text, He cast
out them that bought and sold from the temple. From the priesthood
arises everything good, and everything evil. S. Jerome in his epistle to
Nepotian says: Avoid as you would the plague a trading priest, who has
risen from poverty to riches, from a low to a high estate. And Blessed
Bernard in his 23rd Homily *On the Psalms* says of clerics: If one
should arise as an open heretic, let him be cast out and put to silence;
if he is a violent enemy, let all good men flee from him. But how are we
to know which ones to cast out or to flee from? For they are confusedly
friendly and hostile, peaceable and quarrelsome, neighbourly and utterly
selfish.  
        And in another place: Our bishops are become spearmen, and our
pastors shearers. And by bishops here is meant those proud Abbots who
impose heavy labours on their inferiors, which they would not themselves
touch with their little finger. And S. Gregory says concerning pastors:
No one does more harm in the Church than he who, having the name or
order of sanctity, lives in sin; for no one dares to accuse him of sin,
and therefore the sin is widely spread, since the sinner is honoured for
the sanctity of his order. Blessed Augustine also speaks of monks to
Vincent the Donatist: I freely confess to your charity before the Lord
our God, which is the witness of my soul from the time I began to serve
God, what great difficulty I have experienced in the fact that it is
impossible to find either worse of better men than those who grace or
disgrace the monasteries.  
        Now the wickedness of women is spoken of in *Ecclesiasticus*
xxv: There is no head above the head of a serpent: and there is no wrath
above the wrath of a woman. I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon
than to keep house with a wicked woman. And among much which in that
place precedes and follows about a wicked woman, he concludes: All
wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman. Wherefore S. John
Chrysostom says on the text, It is not good to marry (*S. Matthew* xix):
What else is woman but a foe to friendship, an unescapable punishment, a
necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic
danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair
colours! Therefore if it be a sin to divorce her when she ought to be
kept, it is indeed a necessary torture; for either we commit adultery by
divorcing her, or we must endure daily strife. Cicero in his second book
of *The Rhetorics* says: The many lusts of men lead them into one sin,
but the lust of women leads them into all sins; for the root of all
woman's vices is avarice. And Seneca says in his *Tragedies:* A woman
either loves or hates; there is no third grade. And the tears of woman
are a deception, for they may spring from true grief, or they may be a
snare. When a woman thinks alone, she thinks evil.  
        But for good women there is so much praise, that we read that
they have brought beatitude to men, and have saved nations, lands, and
cities; as is clear in the case of Judith, Debbora, and Esther. See also
I *Corinthians* vii: If a woman hath a husband that believeth not, let
her not leave him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the
believing wife. And *Ecclesiasticus* xxvi: Blessed is the man who has a
virtuous wife, for the number of his days shell be doubled. And
throughout that chapter much high praise is spoken of the excellence of
good women; as also in the last chapter of *Proverbs* concerning a
virtuous woman.  
        And all this is made clear also in the New Testament concerning
women and virgins and other holy women who have by faith led nations and
kingdoms away from the worship of idols to the Christian religion.
Anyone who looks at Vincent of Beauvais (*in Spe. Histo.*, XXVI. 9) will
find marvellous things of the conversion of Hungary by the most
Christian Gilia, and of the Franks by Clotilda, the wife of Clovis.
Wherefore in many vituperations that we read against women, the word
woman is used to mean the lust of the flesh. As it is said: I have found
a woman more bitter than death, and good woman subject to carnal lust.  
        Other again have propounded other reasons why there are more
superstitious women found than men. And the first is, that they are more
credulous; and since the chief aim of the devil is to corrupt faith,
therefore he rather attacks them. See *Ecclesiasticus* xix: He that is
quick to believe is light-minded, and shall be diminished. The second
reason is, that women are naturally more impressionable, and more ready
to receive the influence of a disembodied spirit; and that when they use
this quality well they are very good, but when they use it ill they are
very evil.  
        The third reason is that they have slippery tongues, and are
unable to conceal from the fellow-women those things which by evil arts
they know; and, since they are weak, they find an easy and secret manner
of vindicating themselves by witchcraft. See *Ecclesiasticus* as quoted
above: I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon than to keep house
with a wicked woman. All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a
woman. And to this may be added that, as they are very impressionable,
they act accordingly.  
        There are also others who bring forward yet other reasons, of
which preachers should be very careful how they make use. For it is true
that in the Old Testament the Scriptures have much that is evil to say
about women, and this because of the first temptress, Eve, and her
imitators; yet afterwards in the New Testament we find a change of name,
as from Eva to Ave (as S. Jerome says), and the whole sin of Eve taken
away by the benediction of Mary. Therefore preachers should always say
as much praise of them as possible.  
        But because in these times this perfidy is more often found in
women than in men, as we learn by actual experience, if anyone is
curious as to the reason, we may add to what has already been said the
following: that since they are feebler both in mind and body, it is not
surprising that they should come more under the spell of witchcraft.  
        For as regards intellect, or the understanding of spiritual
things, they seem to be of a different nature from men; a fact which is
vouched for by the logic of the authorities, backed by various examples
from the Scriptures. Terence says: Women are intellectually like
children. And Lactantius (*Institutiones*, III): No woman understood
philosophy except Temeste. And *Proverbs* xi, as it were describing a
woman, says: As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman
which is without discretion.  
        But the natural reason is that she is more carnal than a man, as
is clear from her many carnal abominations. And it should be noted that
there was a defect in the formation of the first woman, since she was
formed from a bent rib, that is, a rib of the breast, which is bent as
it were in a contrary direction to a man. And since through this defect
she is an imperfect animal, she always deceives. For Cato says: When a
woman weeps she weaves snares. And again: When a woman weeps, she
labours to deceive a man. And this is shown by Samson's wife, who coaxed
him to tell her the riddle he had propounded to the Philistines, and
told them the answer, and so deceived him. And it is clear in the case
of the first woman that she had little faith; for when the serpent asked
why they did not eat of every tree in Paradise, she answered: Of every
tree, etc. - lest perchance we die. Thereby she showed that she doubted,
and had little in the word of God. And all this is indicated by the
etymology of the word; for *Femina* comes from *Fe* and *Minus*, since
she is ever weaker to hold and preserve the faith. And this as regards
faith is of her very nature; although both by grace and nature faith
never failed in the Blessed Virgin, even at the time of Christ's
Passion, when it failed in all men.  
        Therefore a wicked woman is by her nature quicker to waver in
her faith, and consequently quicker to abjure the faith, which is the
root of witchcraft.  
        And as to her other mental quality, that is, her natural will;
when she hates someone whom she formerly loved, then she seethes with
anger and impatience in her whole soul, just as the tides of the sea are
always heaving and boiling. Many authorities allude to this cause.
*Ecclesiasticus* xxv: There is no wrath above the wrath of a woman. And
Seneca (*Tragedies*, VIII): No might of the flames or the swollen winds,
no deadly weapon, is so much to be feared as the lust and hatred of a
woman who has been divorced from the marriage bed.  
        This is shown too in the woman who falsely accused Joseph, and
caused him to be imprisoned because he would not consent to the crime of
adultery with her (*Genesis* xxx). And truly the most powerful cause
which contributes to the increase of witches is the woeful rivalry
between married folk and unmarried women and men. This is so even among
holy women, so what must it be among the others? For you see in
*Genesis* xxi. how impatient and envious Sarah was of Hagar when she
conceived: How jealous Rachel was of Leah because she had no children
(*Genesis* xxx): and Hannah, who was barren, of the fruitful Peninnah
(I. *Kings* i): and how Miriam (*Numbers* xii) murmured and spoke ill of
Moses, and was therefore stricken with leprosy: and how Martha was
jealous of Mary Magdalen, because she was busy and Mary was sitting down
(*S. Luke* x). To this point is *Ecclesiasticus* xxxvii: Neither consult
with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous. Meaning that it is
useless to consult with her, since there is always jealousy, that is,
envy, in a wicked woman. And if women behave thus to each other, how
much more will they do so to men.
