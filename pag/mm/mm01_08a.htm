<H2>Question VIII</H2>
<H3>Whether Witches can Hebetate the Powers of Generation or Obstruct the Venereal Act.</H3></CENTER>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Now the fact that adulterous drabs and whores are chiefly given to 
witchcraft is substantiated by the spells which are cast by witches upon the 
act of generation. And to make the truth more clear, we will consider the 
arguments of those who are in disagreement with us on this matter. And first 
it is argued that such a bewitching is not possible, because if it were it 
would apply equally to those who are married; and if this were conceded, 
then, since matrimony is God's work and witchcraft is the devil's, the 
devil's work would be stronger than God's. But if it is allowed that it can 
only affect fornicators and the unmarried, this involves a return to the 
opinion that witchcraft does not really exist, but only in men's imagination; 
and this was refuted in the First Question. Or else some reason will be 
found why it should affect the unmarried and not the married; and the only 
possible reason is that matrimony is God's work. And since, according to the 
Theologians, this reason is not valid, there still remains the argument 
that it would make the devil's work stronger than God's; and since it would 
be unseemly to make such an assertion, it is also unseemly to maintain that 
the venereal act can be obstructed by witchcraft.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Again, the devil cannot obstruct the other natural actions, such as eating, 
walking and standing, as is apparent from the fact that, if he could, he 
could destroy the whole world.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Besides, since the venereal act is common to all women, if it were obstructed 
it would be so with reference to all women; but this is not so, and therefore 
the first argument is good. For the facts prove that it is not so; for when 
a man says that he has been bewitched, he is still quite capable as regards 
other women, though not with her with whom he is unable to copulate; and 
the reason for this is that he does not wish to, and therefore cannot effect 
anything in the matter.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
On the contrary and true side is the chapter in the Decretals (If by 
sortilege, etc.): as is also the opinion of all the Theologians and Canonists, 
where they treat of the obstruction to marriage caused by witchcraft.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
There is also another reason: that since the devil is more powerful than 
man, and a man can obstruct the generative powers by means of frigid herbs 
or anything else that can be thought of, therefore much more can the devil 
do this, since he has greater knowledge and cunning.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<I>Answer</I>. The truth is sufficiently evident from two matters which have 
already been argued, although the method of obstruction has not been 
specifically declared. For it has been shown that witchcraft does not exist 
only in men's imaginations, and not in fact; but that truly and actually 
in numerable bewitchments can happen, with the permission of God. It has 
been shown, too, that God permits it more in the case of the generative 
powers, because of their greater corruption, than in the case of other 
human actions. But concerning the method by which such obstruction is 
procured, it is to be noted that it does not affect only the generative 
powers, but also the powers of the imagination or fancy.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And as to this, Peter of Palude (III, 34) notes five methods. For he says 
that the devil, being a spirit, has power over a corporeal creature to cause 
or prevent a local motion. Therefore he can prevent bodies from approaching 
each other, either directly or indirectly, by interposing himself in some 
bodily shape. In this way it happened to the young man who was betrothed to 
an idol and nevertheless married a young maiden, and was consequently unable 
to copulate with her. Secondly, he can excite a man to that act, or freeze 
his desire for it, by the virtue of secret things of which he best knows the 
power. Thirdly, he can also disturb a man's perception and imagination as to 
make the woman appear loathsome to him: since he can, as had been said, 
influence the imagination. Fourthly, he can directly prevent the erection of 
that member which is adapted to fructification, just as he can prevent local 
motion. Fifthly, he can prevent the flow of the vital essence to the members 
in which lie the motive power; by closing as it were the seminary ducts, so 
that it does not descend to the generative channels, or falls back from 
them, or does not project from them, or in any of many ways fails in its 
function.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And he continues in agreement with what has been treated of above by other 
Doctors. For God allows the devil more latitude in respect of this act, 
through which sin was first spread abroad, than of other human acts. 
Similarly, serpents are more subject to magic spells than are other animals. 
And a little later he says: It is the same in the case of a woman, for the 
devil can so darken her understanding that she considers her husband so 
loathsome that not for all the world would she allow him to lie with her.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Later he wishes to find the reason why more men than women are bewitched in 
respect of that action; and he says that such obstruction generally occurs 
in the matter of erection, which can more easily happen to men; and therefore 
more men than women are bewitched. It might also be said that, the greater 
part of witches being women, they lust more for men than for women. Also 
they act in the despite of married women, finding every opportunity for 
adultery when the husband is able to copulate with other women but not with 
his own wife; and similarly the wife also has to seek other lovers.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
He adds also that God allows the devil to afflict sinners more bitterly than 
the just. Wherefore the Angel said to Tobias: He gives the devil power over 
those who are given up to lust. But he has power also against the just 
sometimes, as in the case of Job, but not in respect of the genital 
functions. Wherefore they ought to devote themselves to confession and other 
good works, lest the iron remain in the wound, and it be in vain to apply 
remedies. So much for Peter. But the method of removing such effects will be 
shown in the Second Part of this work.


<CENTER><I>Some Incidental Doubts on the subject of Copulation<BR>prevented 
by Evil Spells are made Clear.</I></CENTER>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But incidentally, if it is asked why this function is sometimes obstructed 
in respect of one woman but not of another, the answer, according to S. 
Bonaventura, is this. Either the enchantress of witch afflicts in this way 
those persons upon whom the devil has determined; or it is because God will 
not permit it to be inflicted on certain persons. For the hidden purpose of 
God in this is obscure, as is shown in the case of the wife of Tobias. And 
he adds:<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
If it is asked how the devil does this, it is to be said that he obstructs 
the genital power, not intrinsically by harming the organ, but extrinsically 
by rendering it useless. Therefore, since it is an artificial and not a 
natural obstruction, he can make a man impotent towards one woman but not 
towards others: by taking away the inflammation of his lust for her, but 
not for other women, either through his own power, or through some herb or 
stone, or some occult natural means. And this agrees with the words of 
Peter of Palude.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Besides, since impotency in this act is sometimes due to coldness of nature, 
or some natural defect, it is asked how it is possible to distinguish 
whether it is due to witchcraft of not. Hostiensis gives the answer in his 
<I>Summa</I> (but this must not be publicly preached): When the member is in 
no way stirred, and can never perform the act of coition, this is a sign 
of frigidity of nature; but when it is stirred and becomes erect, but yet 
cannot perform, it is a sign of witchcraft.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It is to be noted also that impotence of the member to perform the act is 
not the only bewitchment; but sometimes the woman is caused to be unable to 
conceive, or else she miscarries.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Note, moreover, that according to what is aid down by the Canons, whoever 
through desire of vengeance or for hatred does anything to a man or a woman 
to prevent them from begetting or conceiving must be considered a homicide. 
And note, further, that the Canon speaks of loose lovers who, to save their 
mistresses from shame, use contraceptives, such as potions, or herbs that 
contravene nature, without any help from devils. And such penitents are to 
be punished as homicides. But witches who do such things by witchcraft are 
by law punishable by the extreme penalty, as had been touched on above in 
the First Question.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And for a solution of the arguments; when it is objected that these things 
cannot happen to those joined together in matrimony, it is further to be 
noted that, even if the truth in this matter had not already been made 
sufficiently plain, yet these things can truly and actually happen just as 
much to those who are married as to those who are not. And the prudent reader 
who has plenty of books, will refer to the Theologians and the Canonists, 
especially where they speak of the impotent and bewitched. He will find them 
in agreement in condemning two errors: especially with regard to married 
people who seem to think that such bewitchment cannot happen to those who 
are joined in matrimony, advancing the reason that the devil cannot destroy 
the works of God.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And the first error which they condemn is that of those who say that there 
is no witchcraft in the world, but only in the imagination of men who, 
through their ignorance of hidden causes which no man yet understands, 
ascribe certain natural effects to witchcraft, as though they were effected 
not by hidden causes, but by devils working either by themselves or in 
conjunction with witches. And although all other Doctors condemn this error 
as a pure falsehood, yet S. Thomas impugns it more vigorously and stigmatizes 
it as actual heresy, saying that this error proceeds from the root of 
infidelity. And since infidelity in a Christian is accounted heresy, 
therefore such deserve to be suspected as heretics. And this matter was 
touched on in the First Question, though it was not there declared so 
plainly. For if anyone considers the other sayings of S. Thomas in other 
places, he will find the reasons why he affirms that such an error proceeds 
from the root of infidelity.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
For in his questions concerning Sin, where he treats of devils, and in his 
first question, whether devils have bodies that naturally belong to them, 
among many other matters he makes mention of those who referred every 
physical effect to the virtue of the stars; to which they said that the 
hidden causes of terrestrial effects were subject. And he says: It must be 
considered that the Peripatetics,the followers of Aristotle, held that devils 
did not really exist; but that those things which are attributed to devils 
proceeded from the power of the stars and other natural phenomena. Wherefore 
S. Augustine says (<I>de Ciuitate Dei</I>, X), that it was the opinion of 
Porphyry that from herbs and animals, and certain sounds and voice, and from 
figures and figments observed in the motion of the stars, powers 
corresponding to the stars were fabricated on earth by men in order to 
explain various natural effect. And the error of these is plain, since they 
referred everything to hidden causes in the stars, holding that devils were 
only fabricated by the imagination of men.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But this opinion is clearly proved to be false by S. Thomas in the same 
work; for some works of devils are found which can in no way proceed from 
any natural cause. For example, when one who is possessed by devil speaks in 
an unknown language; and many other devil's works are found, both in the 
Rhapsodic and the Necromantic arts, which can in no way proceed except from 
some Intelligence, which may be naturally good but is evil in its intention. 
And therefore, because of these incongruities, other Philosophers were 
compelled to admit that there were devils. Yet they afterwards fell into 
various errors, some thinking that the souls of men, when they left their 
bodies, became devils. For this reason many Soothsayers have killed children, 
that they might have their souls as their co-operators; and many other 
errors are recounted.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
From this it is clear that not without reason does the Holy Doctor say that 
such an opinion proceeds from the root of infidelity. And anyone who wishes 
may read S. Augustine (<I>de Ciuitate Dei</I>, VIII, IX) on the various 
errors of infidels concerning the nature of devils. And indeed the common 
opinion of all Doctors, quoted in the above-mentioned work, against those 
who err in this way by denying that there are any witches, is very weighty 
in its meaning, even if it is expressed in few words. For they say that they 
who maintain that there is no witchcraft in the world go contrary to the 
opinion of all the Doctors, and of the Holy Scripture; and declare that 
there are devils, and that devils have power over the bodies and imaginations 
of men, with the permission of God. Wherefore, those who are the instruments 
of the devils, at whose instance the devil at times do mischief to a 
creature, they call witches.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Now in the Doctor's condemnation of this first error nothing is said 
concerning those joined together in matrimony; but this is made clear in 
their condemnation of the second error of believing that, though witchcraft 
exists and abounds in the world, even against carnal copulation, yet, since 
no such bewitchment can be considered to be permanent, it never annuls a 
marriage that has already been contracted. Here is where they speak of those 
joined in matrimony. Now in refuting this error (for we do so, even though 
it is little to the point, for the sake of those who have not many books), 
it is to be noted that they refute it by maintaining that it is against all 
precedent, and contrary to all laws both ancient and modern.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Wherefore the Catholic Doctors make the following distinction, that impotence 
caused by witchcraft is either temporary or permanent. And if it is 
temporary, then it does not annul the marriage. Moreover, it is presumed 
to be temporary of they are able to healed of the impediment within three 
years from their cohabitation, having taken all possible pain, either 
through the sacraments of the Church, or through other remedies, to be 
cured. But if they are not then cured by any remedy, from that time it is 
presumed to be permanent. And in that case it either precedes both the 
contracting of a marriage, and annuls one that is not yet contracted; or 
else it follows the contract of marriage but precedes its consummation, 
and then also, according to some, it annuls the previous contract. (For it 
is said in Book XXXII, quest. 1. cap. 1 that the confirmation of a marriage 
consists in its carnal office.) Or else it is subsequent to the 
consummation of the marriage, and then the matrimonial bond is not annulled. 
Much is noted there concerning impotence by Hostiensis, and Godfrey, and the 
Doctors and Theologians.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<I>To the arguments</I>. As to the first, it is made sufficiently clear from 
what has been said. For as to the argument that God's works can be destroyed 
by the devil's works, if witchcraft has power against those who are married, 
it has no force; rather does the opposite appear, since the devil can do 
nothing without God's permission. For he does not destroy by main force 
like a tyrant, but through some extrinsic art, as is proved above. And the 
second argument is also made quite clear, why God allows this obstruction 
more in the case of the venereal act than of other acts. But the devil has 
power also over other acts, when God permits. Wherefore it is not sound to 
argue that he could destroy the whole world. And the third objection is 
similarly answered by what has been said.
