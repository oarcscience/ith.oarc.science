# Malleus Maleficarum Part 3

## Question VII

### In Which Various Doubts are Set Forth with Regard to the Foregoing Questions and Negative Answers. Whether the Accused is to be Imprisoned, and when she is to be considered Manifestly Taken in the Foul Heresy of Witchcraft. This is the Second Action

        It is asked first what is to be done when, as often happens, the
accused denies everything. We answer that the Judge has three points to
consider, namely, her bad reputation, the evidence of the fact, and the
words of the witnesses; and he must see whether all these agree
together. And if, as very often is the case, they do not altogether
agree together, since witches are variously accused of different deeds
committed in some village or town; but the evidences of the fact are
visible to the eye, as that a child has been harmed by sorcery, or, more
often, a beast has been bewitched or deprived of its milk; and it a
number of witnesses have come forward whose evidence, even if it show
certain discrepancies (as that one should say she had bewitched his
child, another his beast, and a third should merely witness to her
reputation, and so with the others), but nevertheless agree in the
substance of the fact, that is, as to the witchcraft, and that she is
suspected of being a witch; although those witnesses are not enough to
warrant a conviction without the fact of the general report, or even
with that fact, as was shown above at the end of Question III, yet,
taken in conjunction with the visible and tangible evidence of the fact,
the Judge may, in consideration of these three points together, decide
that the accused is to be reputed, not as strongly or gravely under
suspicion (which suspicions will be explained later), but as manifestly
taken in the heresy of witchcraft; provided, that is, that the witnesses
are of a suitable condition and have not given evidence out of enmity,
and that a sufficient number of them, say six or eight or ten, have
agreed together under oath. And then, according to the Canon Law, he
must subject her to punishment, whether she has confessed her crime or
not. And this is proved as follows.  
        For since it is said, that when all three of the above
considerations are in agreement, then she should be thought to be
manifestly taken in heresy, it must not be understood that it is
necessary for all three to be in agreement, but only that if this is the
case the proof is all the stronger. For either one instance by itself of
the following two circumstances, namely, the evidence of the fact and
the production of legitimate witnesses, is sufficient to cause a person
to be reputed as manifestly taken in heresy; and all the more when both
these considerations are in agreement.  
        For when the Jurists ask in how many ways a person may be
considered as manifestly taken in heresy, we answer that there are three
ways, as S. Bernard has explained. This matter was treated of above in
the First Question at the beginning of this work, namely, the evidence
of the fact, when a person has publicly preacher heresy. But here we
consider the evidence of the fact provided by public threats uttered by
the accused, as when she said, “You shall have no healthy days,” or some
such thing, and the threatened effect has followed. The other two ways
are the legitimate proof of the case by witnesses, and thirdly by her
own confession. Therefore, if each of these singly is sufficient to
cause a person to be manifestly suspected, how much more is this the
case when the reputation of the accused, the evidence of the fact, and
the depositions of witnesses all together point to the same conclusion.
It is true that S. Bernard speaks of an evident fact, and we here speak
of the evidence of the fact; but this is because the devil does not work
openly, but secretly. Therefore the injuries and the instruments of
witchcraft which are found constitute the evidence of the fact. And
whereas in other heresies an evident fact is alone sufficient, here we
join three proofs together.  
        Secondly, it is thus proved that a person so taken is to be
punished according to the law, even though she denies the accusation.
For a person taken on the evidence of the fact, or on the depositions of
witnesses, either confesses the crime or does not. If he confesses and
is impenitent, he is to be handed over to the secular courts to suffer
the extreme penalty, according to the chapter *ad abolendam*, or he is
to be imprisoned for life, according to the chapter *excommunicamus*.
But if he does not confess, and stoutly maintains his denial, he is to
be delivered as an impenitent to the power of the Civil Court to be
punished in a fitting manner, as Henry of Segusio shows in his *Summa*,
where he treats of the manner of proceeding against heretics.  
        It is therefore concluded that it is most just if the Judge
proceeds in that manner with his questions and the depositions of
witnesses, since, as has been said, he can in a case concerning the
Faith conduct matters quite plainly and in a short and summary manner;
and it is meet that he should consign the accused to prison for a time,
or for several years, in case perhaps, being depressed after a year of
the squalor of prison, she may confess her crimes.  
        But, lest it should seem that he arrives at his sentence
precipitately, and to show that he proceeds with all equity, let us
inquire into what should next be done.
