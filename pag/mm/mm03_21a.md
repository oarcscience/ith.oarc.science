# Malleus Maleficarum Part 3

## Question XXI

### Of the Second Method of Pronouncing Sentence, when the Accused is no more than Defamed

        THE second method of delivering judgement is to be employed when
he or she who is accused, after a diligent discussion of the merits of
the case in consultation with learned lawyers, is found to be no more
than defamed as a heretic in some village, town, or province. And this
is when the accused does not stand convicted either by her own
confession, or by the evidence of the facts, or by the legitimate
production of witnesses; nor has there been anything proved against her
except that she is the subject of common aspersion: so that no
particular act of witchcraft can be proved by which she can be brought
under strong or grave suspicion, as that she has uttered threatening
words, for example, “You will soon feel what will happen to you,” or
something to that effect, and afterwards some injury has befallen the
person or the cattle of the man she threatened.  
        The following procedure, therefore, is to be employed in the
case of such a one against whom nothing has been proved except public
obloquy. In this case judgement cannot be delivered for the accused, nor
can she be absolved as in the first method; but a canonical purgation
must be imposed upon her. Therefore let the Bishop or his deputy, or the
Judge, first take note that, in a case of heresy, it is not necessary
that a person should be defamed only by good and respected people; for
the calumniation uttered by common and simple folk carries equal
weight.  
        And the reason for this is, that the same persons who are
admitted as accusers in a case of heresy are also admitted as
detractors. Now any heretic can be accused by anybody, except his mortal
enemies; therefore he can also be defamed by anybody.  
        Therefore let the Bishop or Judge pronounce his sentence of
canonical purgation in this or some similar manner:  
        We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a city, or Judge of
such a county, having diligently examined the merits of the process
conducted by us against you N. of such a Diocese accused before us of
the crime of heresy, etc. We have not found that you have confessed to
or have been convicted of the aforesaid sin or that you are even lightly
suspected of it, except that we find that truly and legitimately you are
publicly defamed by both good and bad in such a village, town, or
Diocese; and that you may be in good odour among the company of the
faithful we impose upon you as by law a canonical purgation, assigning
to you such a day of such a month at such hour of the day, upon which
you shall appear in person before us with so many persons of equal
station with you to purge you of your defamation. Which sponsors must be
men of the Catholic faith and of good life who have known your habits
and manner of living not only recently but in time past. And we signify
that, if you should fail in this purgation, we shall hold you convicted,
according to the canonical sanctions.  
        Here it is to be considered that, when a person is duly found to
be publicly defamed of some heresy, and nothing is proved against him
except that defamation, a canonical purgation shall be imposed upon him.
That is, he must produce some seven, ten, twenty, or thirty men,
according to the extent to which he has been defamed and the size and
important of the place concerned, and these must be men of his own
station and condition. For example, if he who is defamed is a religious,
they must be religious; if he is a secular, they must be seculars; if he
be a solder, they must be soldiers who purge him from the crime for
which he is defamed. And these sponsors must be men professing the
Catholic faith and of good life, who have known his habits and life both
recently and for a long time.  
        But if he refuses this purgation, he must be excommunicated; and
if he remains obstinate in that excommunication for a year, he is then
to be condemned as a heretic.  
        And if he accepts the purgation and fails in it; that is, if he
cannot find sponsors of the number and quality desired; he shall be
considered as convicted, and is to be condemned as a heretic.  
        And it must here be remarked that, when it is said that he must
purge himself by means of so many men of his own station in life, this
is meant generically and not specifically. Thus, if a Bishop is to be
purged, it is not necessary that all his sponsors should be Bishops; but
Abbots and other religious who are priests are admitted; and similarly
in other cases.  
        And the defamed person shall purge himself in the following
manner. At the time assigned to him for his canonical purgation, he
shall appear in person with his sponsors before the Bishop who is his
Judge, in the place where he is known to be defamed; and, placing his
hand upon the Book of the Gospels set before him, he shall say as
follows:  
        I swear upon these four Holy Gospels of God that I never held,
believed or taught, neither do I hold or believe such heresy (naming it)
for which I am defamed.  
        That is to say, he shall deny on oath whatever it is for which
he is defamed.  
        After this, all his sponsors shall place their hands on the
Gospels; and each of them severally shall say: And I swear upon this
Holy Gospel of God that I believe him to have sworn the truth. And then
he is canonically purged.  
        It is also to be noted that a person defamed of heresy is to be
purged in the place where he is known to be defamed. And if he has been
defamed in many places, he must be required to profess the Catholic
faith and deny the heresy in all the places in which he is known as
defamed.  
        And let not such a person hold in light esteem this canonical
purgation. For it is provided by the Canon Law that, if he afterwards
falls into the heresy of which he has been purged, he is to be handed
over as a backslider to the secular Court. But the case is somewhat
different if he falls into some other heresy, of which he has not before
been purged.
