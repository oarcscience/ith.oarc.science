# Malleus Maleficarum Part 3

## Question XVII

### The Method of passing Sentence upon one who hath Confessed to Heresy, but is still not Penitent

        The eighth method of terminating a process on behalf of the
faith is used when the person accused of heresy, after a careful
examination of the merits of the process in consultation with learned
lawyers, is found to have confessed his heresy, but to be penitent, and
not truly to have relapsed into heresy. And this is when the accused has
himself confessed in a Court of law under oath before the Bishop and
Inquisitor that he has for so long lived and persisted in that heresy of
which he is accused, or in any other, and has believed in and adhered to
it; but that afterwards, being persuaded by the Bishop and others, he
wishes to be converted and to return to the bosom of the Church, and to
abjure that and every heresy, and to make such satisfaction as they
require of him; and it is found that he has made no previous abjuration
of any other heresy, but is now willing and prepared to abjure.  
        In such a case the procedure will be as follows. Although such a
person has for many years persisted in the said heresy and even in
others, and has believed and practised them and led many others into
error; yet if at last he has consented to abjure those heresies and to
make such satisfaction as the Bishop and the ecclesiastical Judge shall
decree, he is not to be delivered up to the secular Court to suffer the
extreme penalty; nor, if he is a cleric, is he to be degraded. But he is
to admitted to mercy, according to the Canon *ad abolendam*. And after
he has abjured his former heresy he is to be confined in prison for life
(see the Canon *excommunicamus*, where it provides for the absolution of
such). But great care must be taken that he has no simulated a false
penitence in order to be received back into the Church. Also the secular
Court is not at all bound by such a sentence as the above.  
        He shall make his abjuration in the manner already set out, with
this difference. He shall with his own mouth confess his crimes before
the congregation in church on a Feast Day, in the following manner. The
clerk shall ask him, have you for so many years persisted in the heresy
of witches? And he shall answer, Yes. And then, Have you done this and
this to which you have confessed? And he shall answer, Yes. And so on.
And finally he shall make his abjuration kneeling on his knees. And
since, having been convicted of heresy, he has been excommunicated,
after he has by abjuration returned to the bosom of the Church, he is to
be granted the grace of absolution, according to the manner used by the
Bishops with Apostolic authority of absolving from the major
excommunication. And sentence shall at once be pronounced in the
following manner:  
        We, the Bishop of such city, or the Judge in the territories of
such Prince, seeing that you, N., of such a place in such a Diocese,
have been by public report and the information of credible persons
accused before us of the sin of heresy; and since you had for many years
been infected with that heresy to the great damage of your soul; and
because this accusation against you has keenly wounded our hearts: we
whose duty it is by reason of the office which we have received to plant
the Holy Catholic Faith in the hearts of men and to keep away all heresy
from their minds, wishing to be more certainly informed whether there
was any truth in the report which had come to our ears, in order that,
if it were true, we might provide a healthy and fitting remedy,
proceeded in the best way which was open to us to question and examine
witness and to interrogate you on oath concerning that of which you were
accused, doing all and singular which was required of us by justice and
the canonical sanctions.  
        And since we wished to bring your case to a suitable conclusion,
and to have a clear understanding of your past state of mind, whether
you were walking in the darkness or in the light, and whether or not you
had fallen into the sin of heresy; having conducted the whole process,
we summoned together in council before us learned men of the Theological
faculty and men skilled in both the Canon and the Civil Law, knowing
that, according to canonical institution, the judgement is sound which
is confirmed by the opinion of many; and having on all details consulted
the opinion of the said learned men, and having diligently and carefully
examined all the circumstances of the process; we find that you are, by
your own confession made on oath before us in the Court, convicted of
many of the sins of witches. (Let them be expressed in detail.)  
        But since the Lord in His infinite mercy permits men at times to
fall into heresies and errors, not only that learned Catholics may be
exercised in sacred arguments, but that they who have fallen from the
faith may become more humble thereafter and perform works of penitence:
having carefully discussed the circumstances of this same process, we
find that you, at our frequent instance and following the advice of us
and other honest men, have with a healthy mind returned to the unity and
bosom of the Holy Mother Church, detesting the said errors and heresies,
and acknowledging the irrefragable truth of the Holy Catholic Faith,
laying it t your inmost heart: wherefore, following in His footsteps Who
wishes that no one should perish, we have admitted you to this
adjuration and public abjuration of the said an all other heresies. And
having done this, we absolve you from the sentence of major
excommunication by which you were bound for your fall into heresy, and
reconciling you to the Holy Mother Church we restore you to the
sacraments of the Church; provided that with a true heart, and not with
simulated faith, you return to the unity of the Church, as we believe
and hope that you have done.  
        But because it would be a very scandalous thing to avenge the
injuries done to temporal Lords and to tolerate the offences committed
against God the Creator of all the Heavens, since it is a far greater
sin to offend against the Eternal than against a temporal Majesty, and
that God Who pities sinners may have mercy upon you, that you may be an
example for others, and that your sins may not remain unpunished, and
that you may become more careful in the future, and not more prone but
less apt to commit the said and any other crimes: We the said Bishop and
Judge, or Judges, on behalf of the faith, sitting in tribunal as Judges
judging, etc., as above . . . that you put on a grey-blue garment, etc.
Also we sentence and condemn you to perpetual imprisonment, there to be
punished with the bread of affliction and the water of distress;
reserving to ourselves the right to mitigate, aggravate, change, or
remit wholly or in part the said sentence if, when, and as often as it
shall seem good to us to do so. This sentence was given, etc.  
        After this the Judge shall proceed point by point, pronouncing
sentence in the following or some similar manner:  
        My son, your sentence or penance consists in this, that you bear
this cross during the whole period of your life, that you stand so
bearing it on the altar steps or in the door of such churches, and that
you be imprisoned for life on bread and water. But, my son, lest this
may seem too hard for you, I assure you that if you patiently bear your
punishment you will find mercy with us; therefore doubt not nor despair,
but hope strongly.  
        After this, let the sentence be duly executed, and let him put
on the said garment and be placed on high upon the altar steps in full
view of the people as they go out, surrounded by the officers of the
secular Court. And at the dinner hour let him be led by the officers to
prison, and the rest of the sentence be carried out and duly performed.
And after he is led out through the door of the church, let the
ecclesiastical Judge have no more to do with the matter; and if the
secular Court be satisfied, it is well, but if not, let it do its
pleasure.
