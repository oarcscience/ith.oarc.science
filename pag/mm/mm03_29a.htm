<H2>Question XXIX</H2>
<H3>The Method of passing Sentence upon one who hath Confessed to Heresy but is Impenitent, although not Relapsed</H3></CENTER>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
THE tenth method of completing a process on behalf of the Faith 
by a final sentence is used when the person accused of heresy, 
after a careful examination of the circumstances of the process 
in consultation with skilled lawyers, is found to have confessed 
his heresy and to be impenitent, though he has not relapsed into 
the heresy. Such a case is very rarely found, but yet it has come 
within the experience of us Inquisitors. In such a case, 
therefore, the Bishop and Judge must not be in haste to sentence 
the prisoner, but must keep him well guarded and fettered, and 
induce him to be converted, even to the extent of several months, 
showing him that, by remaining impenitent, he will be damned in 
body and soul.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if neither by comforts nor hardships, nor by threatening nor 
persuasion, can he be brought to renounce his errors, and the 
appointed period of grace has expired, let the Bishop and Judges 
prepare to deliver or abandon him to the secular Court; and they 
shall give notice to the herald or bailiff or secular authorities 
that on such a day, not a Feast, and at such an hour they should 
be in such a place with their attendants outside a church, and 
that they will deliver to them a certain impenitent heretic. None 
the less they shall themselves make public proclamation in the 
customary places that on such a day at such a time in the 
aforesaid place a sermon will be preached in defence of the 
faith, and that they will hand over a certain heretic to secular 
justice; and that all should come and be present, being granted 
the customary Indulgences.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
After this, the prisoner shall be delivered to the secular Court 
in the following manner. But let him first be often admonished to 
renounce his heresy and repent; but if he altogether refuses, let 
the sentence be pronounced.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a city, or Judge in 
the territories of such Prince, seeing that you, N., of such a 
place in such a Diocese, have been accused before us by public 
report and the information of credible persons (naming them) of 
heresy, and that you have for many years persisted in those 
heresies to the great hurt of your immortal soul; and since we, 
whose duty it is to exterminate the plague of heresy, wishing to 
be more certainly informed of this matter and to see whether you 
walked in darkness or the light, have diligently inquired into 
the said accusation, summoning and duly examining you, we find 
that you are indeed infected with the said heresy.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But since it is the chief desire of our hearts to plant the Holy 
Catholic Faith in the hearts of our people, and to eradicate the 
pest of heresy, we have used diverse and various suitable 
methods, both by ourselves and by others, to persuade you to 
renounce your said errors and heresies in which you had stood, 
were standing, and even now defiantly and obstinately stand with 
stubborn heart. But since the Enemy of the human race is present 
in your heart, wrapping you up and entangling you in the said 
errors, and you have refused and yet refuse to abjure the said 
heresies, choosing rather the death of your soul in hell and of 
your body in this world than to renounce the said heresies and 
return to the bosom of the Church and cleanse your soul, and 
since you are determined to remain in your sin:<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Therefore inasmuch as you are bound by the chain of 
excommunication from the Holy Church, and are justly cut off from 
the number of the Lord's flock, and are deprived of the benefits 
of the Church, the Church can do no more for you, having done all 
that was possible. We the said Bishop and Judges on behalf of the 
Faith, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, and having before 
us the Holy Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the 
countenance of god and our eyes see with equity, and having 
before our eyes only God and the truth of the Holy Faith and the 
extirpation of the plague of heresy, on this day and at this hour 
and place assigned to you for the hearing of your final sentence, 
we give it as our judgement and sentence that you are indeed an 
impenitent heretic, and as truly such to be delivered and 
abandoned to the secular Court: wherefore by this sentence we 
cast you away as an impenitent heretic from our ecclesiastical 
Court, and deliver or abandon you to the power of the secular 
Court: praying the said Court to moderate or temper its sentence 
of death against you. This sentence was given, 
etc.
