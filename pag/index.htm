<P>Neopaganism covers a wide range of belief systems
which have emerged in the past 50 years,
primarily in the UK, Europe, and the United States.
This includes the better known Wicca, which is a synthesis of
traditions from the British Isles, as well as many less visible
groups which draw inspiration from other parts of the world.  
Based on folk-lore, traditional spiritual practices,
anthropology, and a synthesis of esoteric systems, Neopaganism does
not have any sacred texts of the same vintage as other religions,
although unverifiable claims have been made in a couple of cases
(e.g. <A HREF="aradia/index.htm">Aradia</A>,
and <A HREF="gbos/index.htm">The Gardnerian Book of Shadows</A>).</P>

<P>
Rather, the books presented here are source texts of Neopaganism, and
other books which deal with related topics.
Many of these books contain outdated or speculative material,
and some of the texts here are the product of the Renaissance witch hunters.
As a whole, the books here are of historical importance rather
than a roadmap to modern pagan practice, and shouldn't be construed as such.
As always, we encourage readers to think critically.</P>



<P>descriptions of contemporary Neopagan practice and beliefs can be found

<P>
From the 14th to the 17th Century a hysteria spread across Europe
which involved torturing and executing people based on accusations
that they were witches.
Whether any actual practicioners of a pre-Christian pagan tradition were
persecuted as the result of a witch trial is up for debate.
These books and texts are period documents which illustrate
the methods, rationale (such as it was) and history of this persecution.
They shouldn't be taken as illustrative of Neopaganism, but as
a warning about religious tolerance and the fragile nature of justice.

<P>Although little is actually known about the Druids, that didn't
