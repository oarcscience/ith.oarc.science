##### From TRANSLATIONS AND REPRINTS FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCES OF EUROPEAN HISTORY. VOL. III. No. 4.

## Edited by George L. Burr.

#### \[1896\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a survey of primary sources for the history of the witch
persecutions. Written late in the 19th Century, this collection
epitomizes pre-Murray scholarship on this subject. It doesn't attempt
any analysis of the roots of the phenomena other than clerical abuse and
mass insanity. Most importantly, these texts give insight into the
cascading paranoia which characterizes witch hunts of any historical
period.
