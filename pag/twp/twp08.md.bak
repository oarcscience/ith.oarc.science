# VI. THE WITCH-PERSECUTION AT BAMBERG.

From mss. in the Bamberg library, as printed by Leitschuh, Beiträge zur
Geschichte des Hexenwesens in Franken (Bamberg, 1883).

In 1628 there was tried for witchcraft at the episcopal city of Bamberg,
in Germany, the Burgomaster Johannes Junius. The minutes of the trial,
which is in all respects a fair specimen of German witch-trials, are
still to be seen at Bamberg. Translated from German into English, the
greater part runs as follows:

. . . On Wednesday, June 28, 1628, was examined without torture Johannes
Junius, Burgomaster at Bamberg, on the charge of witchcraft: how and in
what fashion he had fallen into that vice. Is fifty-five years old, and
was born at Niederwaysich in the Wetterau. Says he is wholly innocent,
knows nothing of the crime, has never in his life renounced God; says
that he is wronged before God and the world, would like to hear of a
single human being who has seen him at such gatherings \[as the
witch-sabbaths\].

Confrontation of Dr. Georg Adam Haan. Tells him to his face he will
stake his life on it \[*er wolle darauf leben und sterben*\], that he
saw him, Junius, a year and a half ago at a witch-gathering in the
electoral council-room, where they ate and drank. Accused denies the
same wholly.

Confronted with Hopffens Elsse. Tells him likewise that he was on
Haupts-moor at a witch-dance; but first the holy wafer was desecrated.
Junius denies. Hereupon he was told that his accomplices had confessed
against him and was given time for thought.

On Friday, June 30, 1628, the aforesaid Junius was again without torture
exhorted to confess, but again confessed nothing, whereupon, . . . since
he would confess nothing, he was put to the torture, and first the

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

*Thumb-screws* were applied. Says he has never denied God his Saviour
nor suffered himself to be otherwise baptized; <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) will again stake his life on it; feels no
pain in the thumb-screws.

Leg-screws. Will confess absolutely nothing; knows nothing about it. He
has never renounced God; will never do such a thing; has never been
guilty of this vice; feels likewise no pain.

Is stripped and examined; on his right side is found a bluish mark, like
a clover leaf, is thrice pricked therein, but feels no pain and no blood
flows out.

Strappado. He has never renounced God, God will not forsake him; if be
were such a wretch he would not let himself be so tortured; God must
show some token of his innocence. He knows nothing about witchcraft. . .
.

On July 5, the above named Junius is without torture, but with urgent
persuasions, exhorted to confess, and at last begins and confesses:

When in the year 1624 his law-suit at Rothweil cost him some six hundred
florins, he had gone out, in the month of August, into his orchard at
Friedrichsbronnen; and, as he sat there in thought, there had come to
him a woman like a grass-maid, who had asked him why he sat there so
sorrowful; he had answered that he was not despondent, but she had led
him by seductive speeches to yield him to her will. . . . And thereafter
this wench had changed into the form of a goat, which bleated and said,
"Now you see with whom you have had to do. You must be mine or I will
forthwith break your neck." Thereupon be had been frightened, and
trembled all over for fear. Than the transformed spirit had seized him
by the throat and demanded that he should renounce God Almighty,
whereupon Junius said, "God forbid," and thereupon the spirit vanquished
through the power of these words. Yet it came straightway back, brought
more people with it, and persistently demanded of him that he renounce
God in Heaven and all the heavenly host, by which terrible threatening
he was obliged to speak this formula. "I renounce God in Heaven and his
host. and will henceforward recognize the Devil as my God."

After the renunciation he was so far persuaded by those present and by
the evil spirit that he suffered himself to be otherwise baptized'

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

in the evil spirit's name. The Morhauptin had given him a ducat as
dower-gold, which afterward became only a potsherd.

He was then named Krix. His paramour he had to call Vixen. Those present
had congratulated him in Beelzebub's name and said that they were now
all alike. At this baptism of his there were among others the aforesaid
Christiana Morhauptin, the young Geiserlin, Paul Glaser, \[and others\].
After this they had dispersed,

At this time his paramour had promised to provide him with money, and
from time to time to take him to other witch-gatherings.

. . . Whenever he wished to ride forth \[to the witch-sabbath\] a black
dog had come before his bed, which said to him that he must go with him,
whereupon he had seated himself upon the dog and the dog had raised
himself in the Devil's name and so had fared forth.

About two years ago he was taken to the electoral council-room, at the
left hand as one goes in. Above at a table were seated the Chancellor,
the Burgomaster Neydekher, Dr. George Haan, \[and many others\]. Since
his eyes were not good, he could not recognize more persons.

More time for consideration was now given him. On July 7, the aforesaid
Junius was again examined, to know what further had occurred to him to
confess. He confesses that about two months ago, on the day after an
execution was held, he was at a witch-dance at the Black Cross, where
Beelzebub had shown himself to them all and said expressly to their
faces that they must all be burned together on this spot, and had
ridiculed and taunted those present. . . .

Of crimes. His paramour had immediately after his seduction demanded
that he should make away with his younger son Hans Georg, and had given
him for this purpose a gray powder; this, however, being too hard for
him, he had made away with his horse, a brown, instead.

His paramour had also often spurred him on to kill his daughter, . . .
and because he would not do this he had been maltreated with blows by
the evil spirit.

Once at the suggestion of his paramour he had taken the holy wafer out
of his mouth and given it to her. . . .

A week before his arrest as he was going to St. Martin's church the
Devil met him on the way, in the form of a goat, and told him that he
would soon be imprisoned, but that he should not trouble himself--he
would soon set him free. Besides this, by, his soul's salvation, he

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

knew nothing further; but what he had spoken was the pure truth on that
he would stake his life. On August 6, 1628, there was read to the
aforesaid Jnnius this his confession, which he then wholly ratified and
confirmed, and was willing to stake his life upon it. And afterward he
voluntarily confirmed the same before the court.

\[So ended the trial of Junius, and he was accordingly burned at the
stake. But it so happens that there is also preserved in Bamberg a
letter, in quivering hand, secretly written by him to his daughter while
in the midst of his trial (July 24, 1628):\]

Many hundred thousand good-nights, dearly beloved daughter Veronica.
Innocent have I come into prison, innocent have I been tortured,
innocent must I die. For whoever comes into the witch prison must become
a witch or be tortured until he invents something out of his head
and--God pity him--bethinks him of something. I will tell you how it has
gone with me. When I was the first time put to the torture, Dr. Braun,
Dr. Kötzendörffer, and two strange doctors were there. Then Dr. Braun
asks me, "Kinsman, how come you here?" I answer, "Through falsehood,
through misfortune." "Hear, you," he says, "you are a witch; will you
confess it voluntarily? If not, we'll bring in witnesses and the
executioner for you." I said "I am no witch, I have a pure conscience in
the matter; if there are a thousand witnesses, I am not anxious, but
I'll gladly bear the witnesses." Now the chancellor's son was set before
me . . . and afterward Hoppfen Elsa. She had seen me dance on
Haupts-moor. . . . I answered: "I have never renounced God, and will
never do it--God graciously keep me from it. I'll rather bear whatever I
must." And then came also--God in highest Heaven have mercy--the
executioner, and put the thumb-screws on me, both hands bound together,
so that the blood ran out at the nails and everywhere, so that for four
weeks I could not use my hands, as you can see from the writing. . . .
Thereafter they first stripped me, bound my hands behind me, and drew me
up in the torture. <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) Then I thought
heaven and earth were at an end; eight times did they draw me up and let
me fall again, so that I suffered terrible agony. . . .

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

And this happened on Friday, June 30, and with God's help I had to bear
the torture. . . . When at last the executioner led me back into the
prison, he said to me: "Sir, I beg you, for God's sake confess
something, whether it be true or not. Invent something, for you cannot
endure the torture which you will he put to; and, even if you bear it
all, yet you will not escape, not even if you were ail earl, but one
torture will follow after another until you say you are a witch. Not
before that," he said, "will they let you go, as you may see by all
their trials, for one is just like another." . . .

And so I begged, since I was in wretched plight, to be given one day for
thought and a priest. The priest was refused me, but the time for
thought was given. Now, my dear child, see in what hazard I stood and
still stand. I must say that I am a witch, though I am not,--must now
renounce God, though I have never done it before. Day and night I was
deeply troubled, but at last there came to me a new idea. I would not be
anxious, but, since I had been given no priest with whom I could take
counsel, I would myself think of something and say it. It were surely
better that I just say it with mouth and words, even though I had not
really done it; and afterwards I would confess it to the priest, and let
those answer for it who compel me to do it. . . . And so I made my
confession, as follows; but it was all a lie.

Now follows, dear child, what I confessed in order to escape the great
anguish and bitter torture, which it was impossible for me longer to
bear.

\[Here follows his confession, substantially as it is given in the
minutes of his trial. But he adds:\]

Then I had to tell what people I had seen \[at the witch-sabbath\]. I
said that I had not recognized them. "You old rascal, I must set the
executioner at you. Say--was not the Chancellor there?" So I said yes.
"Who besides?" I had not recognized anybody. So be said: "Take one
street after another; begin at the market, go out on one street and back
on the next." I had to name several persons there. Then came the long
street. <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md) I knew nobody. Had to name
eight persons there. Then the Zinkenwert--one person more. Then over the
upper bridge to the Georgthor, on both sides. Knew nobody again

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

Did I know nobody in the castle--whoever it might be, I should speak
without fear. And thus continuously they asked me on all the streets,
though I could not and would not say more. So they gave me to the
executioner, told him to strip me, shave me all over, and put me to the
torture. "The rascal knows one on the market-place, is with him daily,
and yet won't name him." By that they meant Dietmeyer: so I had to name
him too.

Then I had to tell what crimes I had committed. I said nothing. . .
"Draw the rascal up I" So I said that I was to kill my children, but I
had killed a horse instead. It did not help. I had also taken a sacred
wafer, and had desecrated it. When I had said this, they left me in
peace.

Now, dear child, here you have all my confession, for which I must die.
And they are sheer lies and made-up things, so help me God. For all this
I was forced to say through fear of the torture which was threatened
beyond what I had already endured. For they never leave off with the
torture till one confesses something; be he never so good, he must be a
witch, Nobody escapes, though he were an earl.

Dear child, keep this letter secret so that people do not find it, else
I shall be tortured most piteously and the jailers will be beheaded. So
strictly is it forbidden. . . . Dear child, pay this man a dollar. . . .
I have taken several days to write this: my hands are both lame. I am in
a sad plight. . . .

Good night, for your father Johannes Junius will never see you more,
July 24, 1628.

\[And on the margin of the letter he adds:\]

Dear child, six have confessed against me at once: the Chancellor, his
son, Neudecker, Zaner, Hoffmaisters Ursel, and Hoppfen Els--all false,
through compulsion, as they have all told me, and begged my forgiveness
in God's name before they were executed. . . . They know nothing but
good of me. They were forced to say it, just as I myself was. . . .

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_30"></span>[24:1](twp08.htm#fr_30.md) "Otherwise baptized" is
the usual phrase for the rite, a parody of baptism, by which the Devil
was believed to initiate his followers.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[26:1](twp08.htm#fr_31.md) This torture of the
strappado, which was that in most common use by the courts, consisted of
a rope, attached to the hands of the prisoner (bound behind his back)
and carried over a pulley at the ceiling. By this he was drawn up and
left hanging. To increase the pain, weights were attached to his feet or
he was suddenly jerked up and let drop.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[27:1](twp08.htm#fr_32.md) "*Die lange
gasse*,"--the street is still known by that name.
