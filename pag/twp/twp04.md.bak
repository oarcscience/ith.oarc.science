# II. THE BEGINNINGS OF THE WITCH-PERSECUTIONS.

### 1. WITCH-PERSECUTION IN THE EARLIER FIFTEENTH CENTURY.

Nider, Formicarius, ed. of Augsburg, ca. 1476, lib. v, cap. 3. Latin.

One of the earliest books which throws light upon the methods of the
persecutions is the *Formicarius*, or "Ant-Hill," of the Dominican
theological professor, Johannes Nider, written, in its final form, about
1437. The work is an edifying dialogue between a theologian and a
doubter as to sundry topics difficult to faith; and its fifth and final
book is devoted to "witches and their deceptions." The sources and the
nature of Nider's knowledge may be gathered from the following answer of
the theologian to the doubter's request for information as to the
injuries inflicted by witches upon the human beings.

I will relate to you some examples, which I have gained in part from the
teachers of our faculty, in part from the experience of a certain
upright secular judge, worthy of all faith, who from the torture and
confession of witches and from his experiences in public and private has
learned many things of this sort--a man with whom I have often discussed
this subject broadly and deeply--to wit, Peter, a citizen of Bern, in
the diocese of Lausanne, who has burned many Witches of both sexes, and
has driven others out of the territory of the Bernese. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) I have moreover conferred with one Benedict,
a monk of the Benedictine order, who, although now a very devout cleric
in a reformed monastery at Vienna, was a decade ago, while still in the
world, a necromancer, juggler, buffoon, and strolling player, well-known
as an expert among the secular nobility. I have likewise beard certain
of the following things from the Inquisitor of Heretical Pravity <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md) at Autun, who was a devoted reformer of our
order in the convent at Lyons, and has convicted many of witchcraft in
the diocese of Autun.

Relating then two or three anecdotes derived from these sources, the
theologian closes his answer with this one:

The same procedure was more clearly described by another young man,
arrested and burned as a witch, although, as I believe, truly, penitent,

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

who had earlier, together with his wife, a witch invincible to
persuasion, <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) escaped the clutches of
the aforesaid judge, Peter. The aforesaid youth, being again indicted at
Bern, with his wife, and placed in a different prison from hers,
declared: "If I can obtain absolution for my sins, I will freely lay
bare all I know about witchcraft, for I see that I have death to
expect." And when he bad been assured by the scholars that, if he should
truly repent, he would certainly be able to gain absolution for his
sins, then be gladly offered himself to death, and disclosed the methods
of the primeval infection.

The ceremony, he said, of my seduction was as follows: First, on a
Sunday, before the holy water is consecrated, the future disciple with
his masters must go into the church, and there in their presence must
renounce Christ and his faith, baptism, and the church universal. Then
he must do homage to the *magisterulus*, that is, to the little master
(for so, and not otherwise, they call the Devil). Afterward he drinks
from the aforesaid flask; <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md) and, this
done, he forthwith feels himself to conceive and hold within himself an
image of our art and the chief rites of this sect. After this fashion
was I seduced; and my wife also, whom I believe of so great pertinacity
that she will endure the flames rather than confess the least whit of
the truth; but, alas, we are both guilty. What the young man had said
was found in all respects the truth. For, after confession, the young
man was seen to die in great contrition. His wife, however, though
convicted by the testimony of witnesses, would not confess the truth
even under the torture or in death; but, when the fire was prepared for
her by the executioner, uttered in most evil words a curse upon him, and
so was burned.

### 2. THE WITCH-BULL OF 1484.

Bullarium Romanum (Taurinensis editio), sub anno 1484. Latin. The bull
is also printed in full at the head of the *Malleus maleficarum*,
described below.

Despite the efforts of the Dominicans, it was with much difficulty that
the new terror of witchcraft and the persecution based on it were spread
throughout Europe. In Germany, especially, the Inquisitors charged with
the task found themselves hampered by skepticism. In 1484, therefore,
they turned their steps toward Rome for help, and on December 5th they
won from the new Pope, Innocent VIII, a bull which once for all closed
the mouths of doubters and compelled the coöperation of

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

the German authorities, both ecclesiastical and lay. This bull, known
from its first words as *Summis desiderantes*, runs as follows:

Innocentius, episcopus, servus servorum Dei. Ad futuram rei memoriam.

Desiring with supreme ardor, as pastoral solicitude requires, that the
catholic faith in our days everywhere grow and flourish as much as
possible, and that all heretical pravity be put far from the territories
of the faithful, we freely declare and anew decree this by which our
pious desire may be fulfilled, and, all errors being rooted out by our
toil as with the hoe of a wise laborer, zeal and devotion to this faith
may take deeper hold on the hearts of the faithful themselves.

It. has recently come to our ears, not without great pain to us, that in
some parts of upper Germany, as well as in the provinces, cities,
territories, regions, and dioceses of Mainz, Köln, Trier, Salzburg, and
Bremen, many persons of both sexes, heedless of their own salvation and
forsaking the catholic faith, give themselves over to devils male and
female, and by their incantations, charms, and conjurings, and by other
abominable superstitions and sortileges, offences, crimes, and misdeeds,
ruin and cause to perish the offspring of women, the foal of animals,
the products of the earth, the grapes of vines, and the fruits of trees,
as well as men and women, cattle and flocks and herds and animals of
every kind, vineyards also and orchards, meadows, pastures, harvests,
grains and other fruits of the earth; that they afflict and torture with
dire pains and anguish, both internal and external, these men, women,
cattle, flocks, herds, and animals, and hinder men from begetting and
women from conceiving, and prevent all consummation of marriage; that,
moreover, they deny with sacrilegious lips the faith they received in
holy baptism; and that, at the instigation of the enemy of mankind, they
do not fear to commit and perpetrate many other abominable offences and
crimes, at the risk of their own souls, to the insult of the divine
majesty and to the pernicious example and scandal of multitudes. And,
although our beloved sons Henricus Institoris and Jacobus Sprenger, of
the order of Friars Preachers, professors of theology, have been and
still are deputed by our apostolic letters as inquisitors of heretical
pravity, the former in the aforesaid parts of upper Germany, including
the provinces, cities, territories, dioceses, and other places as above,
and the latter throughout certain parts of the course of the Rhine;
Nevertheless certain of the clergy and of the laity of those parts,
seeking to be wise above what is fitting, because in the said letter of
deputation the

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

aforesaid provinces, cities, dioceses, territories, and other places,
and the persons and offences in question were not individually and
specifically named, do not blush obstinately to assert that these are
not at all included in the said parts and that therefore it is illicit
for the aforesaid inquisitors to exercise their office of inquisition in
the provinces, cities, dioceses, territories, and other places
aforesaid, and that they ought not to be permitted to proceed to the
punishment, imprisonment, and correction of the aforesaid persons for
the offences and crimes above named. Wherefore in the provinces, cities,
dioceses, territories, and places aforesaid such offences and crimes,
not without evident damage to their souls and risk of eternal salvation,
go unpunished.

We therefore, desiring, as is our duty, to remove all impediments by
which in any way the said inquisitors are hindered in the exercise of
their office, and to prevent the taint of heretical pravity and of other
like evils from spreading their infection to the ruin of others who are
innocent, the zeal of religion especially impelling us, in order that
the provinces, cities, dioceses, territories, and places aforesaid in
the said parts of upper Germany may not be deprived of the office of
inquisition which is their due, do hereby decree, by virtue of our
apostolic authority, that it shall be permitted to the said inquisitors
in these regions to exercise their office of inquisition and to proceed
to the correction, imprisonment, and punishment of the aforesaid persons
for their said offences and crimes, in all respects and altogether
precisely as if the provinces, cities, territories, places, persons, and
offences aforesaid were expressly named in the said letter. And, for the
greater sureness, extending the said letter and deputation to the
provinces, cities, dioceses, territories, places, persons, and crimes
aforesaid, we grant to the said inquisitors that they or either of them,
joining with them our beloved son Johannes Gremper, cleric of the
diocese of Constance, master of arts, their present notary, or any other
notary public who by them or by either of them shall have been
temporarily delegated in the provinces, cities, dioceses, territories,
and places aforesaid, may exercise against all persons, of whatsoever
condition and rank, the said office of inquisition, correcting,
imprisoning, punishing, and chastising, according to their deserts,
those persons whom they shall find guilty as aforesaid.

And they shall also have full and entire liberty to propound and preach
to the faithful the word of God, as often as it shall seem to them
fitting and proper, in each and all of the parish churches in the said
provinces, and to do all things necessary and suitable under the
aforesaid circumstances, and likewise freely and fully to carry them
out.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

And moreover we enjoin by apostolic writ on our venerable brother, the
Bishop of Strasburg, that, either in his own person or through some
other or others solemnly publishing the foregoing wherever, whenever,
and how often soever he may deem expedient or by these inquisitors or
either of them may be legitimately required, he permit them not to be
molested or hindered in any manner whatsoever by any authority
whatsoever in the matter of the aforesaid and of this present letter,
threatening all opposers, hinderers, contradicters, and rebels, of
whatever rank, state, decree, eminence, nobility, excellence, or
condition they may be, and whatever privilege of exemption they may
enjoy, with excommunication, suspension, interdict, and other still more
terrible sentences, censures, and penalties, as may be expedient, and
this without appeal and with power after due process of law of
aggravating and reaggravating these penalties, by our authority, as
often as may be necessary, to this end calling in the aid, if need be,
of the secular arm.

And this, all other apostolic decrees and earlier decisions to the
contrary notwithstanding; or if to any, jointly or severally, there has
been granted by this apostolic see exemption from interdict, suspension,
or excommunication, by apostolic letters not making entire, express, and
literal mention of the said grant of exemption; or if there exist any
other indulgence whatsoever, general or special, of whatsoever tenor, by
failure to name which or to insert it bodily in the present letter the
carrying out of this privilege could be hindered or in any way put off,
or any of whose whole tenor special mention must be made in our letters.
Let no man, therefore, dare to infringe this page of our declaration,
extension, grant, and mandate, or with rash hardihood to contradict it.
If any presume to attempt this, let him know that he incurs the wrath of
almighty God and of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul. <span

Given in Rome, at St. Peter's, in the year of Our Lord's incarnation
1484, on the nones of December, in the first year of our pontificate.

### 3. THE WITCH-HAMMER.

Even when armed with the papal bull, the German Inquisitors found their
preparation incomplete. Soon after their return from Rome they set
themselves at the compilation of a hand-book which should leave no judge
an excuse for laxity--an exposition of witchcraft and a code of
procedure for the detection and punishment of witches. This, completed
in 1486, they called Malleus Maleficarum, "The Witch-Hammer." As a
specimen may serve a part of its

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

Directions for the Torture of a Witch.

Malleus Maleficarum, pars iii, quæstio 14. Latin. Editions are many.

The method of beginning an examination by torture is as follows: First,
the jailers prepare the implements of torture, then they strip the
prisoner (if it be a woman, she has already been stripped by other
women, upright and of good report). <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)
This stripping is lest some means of witchcraft may have been sewed into
the clothing--such as often, taught by the Devil, they prepare from the
bodies of unbaptized infants, \[murdered\] that they may forfeit
salvation. And when the implements of torture have been prepared, the
judge, both in person and through other good men zealous in the faith,
tries to persuade the prisoner to confess the truth freely; but, if he
will not confess, he bids attendants make the prisoner fast to the
strappado or some other implement of torture. The attendants obey
forthwith, yet with feigned agitation. Then, at the prayer of some of
those present, the prisoner is loosed again and is taken aside and once
more persuaded to confess, being led to believe that be will in that
case not be put to death.

Here it may be asked whether the judge, in the case of a prisoner much
defamed, convicted both by witnesses and by proofs, nothing being
lacking but his own confession, can properly lead him to hope that his
life will be spared--when, even if he confess his crime, he will be
punished with death.

It must be answered that opinions vary. Some hold that even a witch of
very ill repute, against whom the evidence justifies violent suspicion,
and who, as a ringleader of the witches, is accounted very dangerous,
may be assured her life, and condemned instead to perpetual imprisonment
on bread and water, in case she will give sure and convincing testimony
against other witches; yet this penalty of perpetual imprisonment must
not be announced to her, but only that her life will be spared, and that
she will be punished in some other fashion, perhaps by exile. And
doubtless such notorious witches, especially those who prepare
witch-potions or who by magical methods cure those bewitched, would be
peculiarly suited to be thus preserved, in order to aid the bewitched or
to accuse other witches, were it not that their accusations cannot be
trusted, since the Devil is a liar, unless confirmed by proof and
witnesses.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

Others hold, as to this point, that for a time the promise made to the
witch sentenced to imprisonment is to be kept, but that after a time she
should be burned.

A third view is, that the judge may safely promise witches to spare
their lives, if only he will later excuse himself from pronouncing the
sentence and will let another do this in his place. . . .

But if, neither by threats nor by promises such as these, the witch can
be induced to speak the truth, then the jailers must carry out the
sentence, and torture the prisoner according to the accepted methods,
with more or less of severity as the delinquent's crime may demand. And,
while he is being tortured, he must be questioned on the articles of
accusation, and this frequently and persistently, beginning with the
lighter charges--for he will more readily confess the lighter than the
heavier. And, while this is being done, the notary must write down
everything in his record of the trial--how the prisoner is tortured, on
what points he is questioned, and how he answers.

And note that, if he confesses under the torture, he must afterward be
conducted to another place, that he may confirm it and certify that it
was not due alone to the force of the torture.

But, if the prisoner will not confess the truth satisfactorily, other
sorts of tortures must be placed before him, with the statement that,
unless he will confess the truth, he must endure these also. But, if not
even thus be can be brought into terror and to the truth, then the next
day or the next but one is to be set for a *continuation* of the
torture--not a repetition, <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) for they
must not be repeated unless new evidences be produced.

The judge must then address to the prisoners the following sentence: We,
the judge, etc., do assign to you,------, such and such a day for the
continuation of the tortures, that from your own mouth the truth may be
heard, and that the whole may be recorded by the notary.

And during the interval, before the day assigned, the judge, in person
or through approved men, must in the manner above described try to
persuade the prisoner to confess, promising her <span
id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10.md) (if there is aught to be gained by this
promise) that her life shall be spared.

The judge shall see to it, morever, that throughout this interval

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

guards are constantly with the prisoner, so that she may not be left
alone; because she will be visited by the Devil and tempted into
suicide.
