# INTRODUCTION.

The belief in witchcraft and the persecution of those supposed to
practice it have been almost universal in human history. Christianity
inherited both the belief and the persecution from the religions, Jewish
and pagan, which preceded it. But, under the influence of its
monotheistic faith and its humane spirit, it was long before the belief
became throughout Christendom a panic and the persecution an epidemic.
When, however, in the thirteenth century, the scholastic theology, in
its love of logical completeness, gave new prominence to the Devil and
his followers as the counterpart and parody of God and his church and
when, in the fourteenth century, the Holy Inquisition, successful in
rooting out the heretics, turned its idle hands to the extirpation of
those viler sinners whom it believed plighted wholly to Satan, the
terror grew. The witch-persecutions it engendered ravaged for centuries
all Christian lands, and have not yet wholly died away. It is with these
persecutions, from their rise into full activity in the fifteenth
century to their culmination in the seventeenth, that the present study
deals. It seeks to illustrate their source, their scope, and their
methods. With the superstitions which suggested the charges it concerns
itself little. Both in these and in the procedure there is much too foul
or too brutal for reproduction here. It was, indeed, no small part of
the evil of the matter, that it so long debauched the imagination of
Christendom.
