# VII. THE WITCH-PERSECUTION AT WÜRZBURG.

From *Codex german*. 1254 of the Munich library, as printed by
Leitschuh, *Beiträge zur Geschichte des Hexenwesens in Franken*.

In August, 1629, the Chancellor of the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg thus
wrote (in German) to a friend:

As to the affair of the witches, which Your Grace thinks brought to an
end before this, it has started up afresh, and no words can do justice
to it. Ah, the woe and the misery of it--there are still four hundred in
the city, high and low, of every rank and sex, nay, even clerics, so
strongly accused that they may be arrested at any hour. It is true that,
of the people of my Gracious Prince here, some out of all offices and
faculties must be executed: clerics, electoral councilors and doctors,
city officials, court assessors, several of whom Your Grace knows. There
are law students to be arrested. The Prince-Bishop has over forty
students who are soon to be pastors; among them thirteen or fourteen are
said to be witches. A few days ago a Dean was arrested; two others who
were summoned have fled. The notary of our Church consistory, a very
learned man, was yesterday arrested and put to the torture. In a word, a
third part of the city is surely involved. The richest, most attractive,
most prominent, of the clergy are already executed. A week ago a maiden
of nineteen was executed, of whom it is everywhere said that she was the
fairest in the whole city, and was held by everybody a girl of singular
modesty and purity. She will be followed by seven or eight others of the
best and most attractive persons. . . . And thus many are put to death
for renouncing God and being at the witch-dances, against whom nobody
has ever else spoken a word.

To conclude this wretched matter, there are children of three and four
years, to the number of three hundred, who are said to have had
intercourse with the Devil. I have seen put to death children of seven,
promising students of ten, twelve, fourteen, and fifteen. Of the
nobles--but I cannot and must not write more of this misery. There are
persons of yet higher rank, whom you know, and would marvel to hear of,
nay, would scarcely believe it; let justice be done . . .

P. S.--Though there are many wonderful and terrible things happening, it
is beyond doubt that, at a place called the Fraw-Rengberg, the Devil in
person, with eight thousand of his followers, held an assembly and
celebrated mass before them all, administering to his audience (that is,
the witches) turnip-rinds and parings in place of the Holy Eucharist.
There took place not only foul but most horrible and hideous
blasphemies, whereof I shudder to write. It is also true that they all
vowed not to be enrolled in the Book of Life, but all agreed to be
inscribed by a notary who is well known to me and my colleagues. We
hope, too, that the book in which they are enrolled will yet be found,
and there is no little search being made for it.
