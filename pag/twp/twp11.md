# IX. SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY.

There are few subjects on which so much has been written, yet so little
that is serious in aim and scholarly in method. An idea of the
literature as a whole may be gained from a paper on "The Literature of
Witchcraft," contributed by the present editor to the Papers of the
American Historical Association for 1890, and from Dr. Justin Winsor's
"The Literature of Witchcraft in New England," in the Proceedings of the
American Antiquarian Society for 1895. The best survey, in English, of
the whole subject is still the chapter "Magic and Witchcraft" in Mr.
Lecky's "History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism
in Europe." Mr. Lea's "History of the Inquisition in the Middle Ages"
has precious chapters on "Sorcery and Occult Arts" and on "Witchcraft."
Admirable for its insight is James Russell Lowell's essay on
"Witchcraft" (in his "Among my Books"). Of the monographs the best of
the more comprehensive are:

Soldan: Geschichte der Hexenprozesse. Neu bearbeitet von H. Heppe. 2
vols. Stuttgart, 1880.  
Long the standard history of the witch-persecutions.

Hansen: Zauberwahn, Inquisition und Hexenprozess im Mittelalter und die
Entstehung der grossen Hexenverfolgung. München, 1900.  
The most thorough study of the rise of witch-persecution in Christendom.
For the period prior to 1540 it supplants all else. Added as *Quellen
Und Untersuchungen* (Bonn, 1901) is a priceless collection of sources.

Wright: Narratives of Sorcery and Magic. 2 vols. London, 1851. (1 vol.
New York, 1852.).  
Written to entertain, and with little attempt at exhaustiveness, but the
work of a true scholar. It is episodical in treatment and gives especial
attention to the persecution in lands of English speech.

Baissac: Les Grands Jours de la Sorcellerie. Paris, 1890.  
The best of the French histories of the subject. It gives most attention
to France. An earlier book of Baissac's, *Le Diable* (Paris, 1882), is
also of value for this study.

Diefenbach: Der Hexenwahn vor und nach der Glaubensspaltung in
Deutschland. Mainz, 1886.  
A study, by a Catholic apologist, of the share of the rival faiths in
the persecution. Directed in part against Soldan. An abler and more
thorough treatment from the Catholic side is now to be found, however,
in the eighth volume of Janssen's *Geschichte des deutschen Volkes*
(Freiburg, 1894).

Längin: Religion und Hexenprozess. Leipzig, 1888.  
From a Protestant point of view. In part an answer to Diefenbach.

Michelet: La Sorcière. Paris, 1862.  
An eloquent book, by a brilliant scholar; but a rhapsody rather than a
history, and as full of fancy as of fact. There is an English
translation (London, 1863).

Upham: Salem Witchcraft. 2 vols. Boston, 1867.  
The standard work upon the most notable of American witch-persecutions.
It may be supplemented by Drake's *Annals of Witchcraft in New England
and elsewhere in the United States* (Boston, 1869).

Roskoff: Geschichte des Teufels. 2 vols. Leipzig, 1869.  
Best for the history of the Devil in his relation to witchcraft. Of
value, but dealing less with the witch persecution, are also Conway's
*Demonology and Devil-lore* (London, and New York, 1879) and Graf's *Il
Diavolo* (Milan, 1889).

Binz: Doctor Johann Weyer. Bonn, 1885. 2d ed., enlarged, Berlin, 1896.  
A scholarly biography of the first great opponent of witch-persecution,
with excellent sketches of his opponents and of his followers in this
humane struggle.
