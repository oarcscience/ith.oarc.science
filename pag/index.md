------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neopaganism covers a wide range of belief systems which have emerged in
the past 50 years, primarily in the UK, Europe, and the United States.
This includes the better known Wicca, which is a synthesis of traditions
from the British Isles, as well as many less visible groups which draw
inspiration from other parts of the world. Based on folk-lore,
traditional spiritual practices, anthropology, and a synthesis of
esoteric systems, Neopaganism does not have any sacred texts of the same
vintage as other religions, although unverifiable claims have been made
in a couple of cases (e.g. [Aradia](aradia/index.md), and [The Gardnerian
Book of Shadows](gbos/index).md).

Rather, the books presented here are source texts of Neopaganism, and
other books which deal with related topics. Many of these books contain
outdated or speculative material, and some of the texts here are the
product of the Renaissance witch hunters. As a whole, the books here are
of historical importance rather than a roadmap to modern pagan practice,
and shouldn't be construed as such. As always, we encourage readers to
think critically.

descriptions of contemporary Neopagan practice and beliefs can be found
in the [Internet Book of Shadows](../bos/index.md) section of this site.

### <span id="burning">The Burning Times</span>

From the 14th to the 17th Century a hysteria spread across Europe which
involved torturing and executing people based on accusations that they
were witches. Whether any actual practicioners of a pre-Christian pagan
tradition were persecuted as the result of a witch trial is up for
debate. These books and texts are period documents which illustrate the
methods, rationale (such as it was) and history of this persecution.
They shouldn't be taken as illustrative of Neopaganism, but as a warning
about religious tolerance and the fragile nature of justice.

### <span id="druid">Druids</span>

Although little is actually known about the Druids, that didn't stop
18th and 19th century intellectuals from building a romantic mythology
around them. This was closely associated with the rebirth of [Celtic
nationalism](../neu/index.htm#celtic.md), as well as the Romantic and
[Gothic](../goth/index.md) movements. This body of fact and speculation
later became a central source of modern Wicca and Neo-Pagan belief and
practice.
