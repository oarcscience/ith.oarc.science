# CHAPTER VII

### To Find or Buy Anything, or to Have Good Fortune Thereby

An Invocation or Incantation to Diana.

The man or woman who, when about to go forth into the town, would fain
be free from danger or risk of an accident: or to have good fortune in
buying, as, for instance, if a scholar hopes that he may find some rare
old book or manuscript for sale very cheaply, or if any one wishes to
buy anything very desirable or to find bargains or rarities. This
*scongiurazione* one serves for good health, cheerfulness of heart, and
absence of evil or the overcoming enmity. These are words of gold unto
the believer.

The Invocation.

Siamo di Martedi e a buon ora  
Mi voglio levare la buona fortuna,  
Voglio andare e cercare,  
E coll aiuto della bella *Diana*,  
La voglio trovare prima d'andare,  
Prima di sortir di casa  
Il malocchio mi levero <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>  
Con tre gocciole d'olio, <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md)  
E te bella *Diana* io invoco  
Che tu possa mandarmi via  
Il malocchio da dosse a me  
E mandala al mio più nemico!

Quando il malocchio  
Mi saro levato  
In mezza alla via lo gettero,  
Se questa grazia mi farei  
Diana bella,  
Tutti i campanelli  
Di mia casa bene suonerai,  
Allora contento di casa me ne andro,  
Perche col tuo aiuto (saro) certo di trovare,  
Buona fortuna, certo di trovare  
Un bel libro antico,  
E a buon mercato  
Me lo farai comprare!

Tu stessa dal proprietario  
Che avra il libro  
Te ne andrai tu stessa  
Lo troverai e lo farei,

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Capitare in mano
al padrone,  
E le farai capitare  
In mano al padrone,  
E le farai entrare  
Nel cervello che se di quel libro  
Non si disfara la scomunica,  
Le portera, cosi questo dell'libro,  
Verra disfarsi e col tuo aiuto,  
Verra portato alla mia presenza,  
E a poco me to vendera,  
Oppure se e'un *manoscritto*,  
Invece di libro per la via lo gettera,  
E col tuo aiuto verra in mia presenza,  
E potrò acquistarlo  
Senza nessuna spesa;  
E cosi per me  
Sara grande fortuna!

To Diana.

'Tis Tuesday now, and at an early hour  
I fain would turn good fortune to myself,  
Firstly at home and then when I go forth,  
And with the aid of beautiful Diana  
I pray for luck ere I do leave this house!

First with three drops of oil I do remove  
All evil influence, and I humbly pray,  
O beautiful *Diana*, unto thee  
That thou wilt take it all away from me,  
And send it all to my worst enemy!

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

When the evil fortune  
Is taken from me,  
I'll cast it out to the middle of the street:  
And if thou wilt grant me this favour,  
O beautiful Diana,  
Every bell in my house shall merrily ring!

Then well contented  
I will go forth to roam,  
Because I shall be sure that with thy aid  
I shall discover ere I return  
Some fine and ancient books,  
And at a moderate price.

And thou shalt find the man,  
The one who owns the book,  
And thou thyself wilt go  
And put it in his mind,  
Inspiring him to know  
What 'tis that thou would'st find  
And move him into doing  
All that thou dost require.  
Or if a manuscript  
Written in ancient days,  
Thou'lt gain it all the same,  
It shall come in thy way,  
And thus at little cost.  
Thou shalt buy what thou wilt,  
By great *Diana's* aid.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

The foregoing was obtained, after some delay, in reply to a query as to
what conjuration would be required before going forth, to make sure that
one should find for sale some rare book, or other object desired, at a
very moderate price. Therefore the invocation has been so worded as to
make it applicable to literary finds; but those who wish to buy anything
whatever on equally favourable terms, have but to vary the request,
retaining the introduction, in which the magic virtue consists. I
cannot, however, resist the conviction that it is most applicable to,
and will succeed best with, researches for objects of antiquity,
scholarship, and art, and it should accordingly be deeply impressed on
the memory of every bric-à-brac hunter and bibliographer. It should be
observed, and that earnestly, that the prayer, far from being answered,
will turn to the contrary or misfortune, unless the one who repeats it
does so in fullest faith, and this cannot be acquired by merely saying
to oneself, "I believe." For to acquire real faith in anything requires
long and serious mental discipline, there being, in fact, no subject
which is so generally spoken of and so little understood. Here, indeed,
I am speaking seriously, for the man who can train his faith to actually
believe in and cultivate or develop his will can really work what the

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

world by common consent regards as miracles. A time will come when this
principle will form not only the basis of all education, but also that
of all moral and social culture. I have, I trust, fully set it forth in
a work entitled "Have you a Strong Will? or how to Develop it or any
other Faculty or Attribute of the Mind, and render it Habitual," &c.
London: George Redway.

The reader, however, who has devout faith, can, as the witches declare,
apply this spell daily before going forth to procuring or obtaining any
kind of bargains at shops, to picking up or discovering lost objects,
or, in fact, to finds of any kind. If he incline to beauty in female
form, he will meet with *bonnes fortunes*; if a man of business,
bargains will be his. The botanist who repeats it before going into the
fields will probably discover some new plant, and the astronomer by
night be almost certain to run against a brand new planet, or at least
an asteroid. It should be repeated before going to the races, to visit
friends, places of amusement, to buy or sell, to make speeches, and
specially before hunting or any nocturnal goings--forth, since *Diana*
is the goddess of the chase and of night. But woe to him who does it for
a jest!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_15"></span>[39:1](ara09.htm#fr_15.md) This refers to a small
ceremony which I have seen performed scores of times, and have indeed
had it performed over me almost as often, as an act of courtesy common
among wizards and witches. It consists of making certain signs and
crosses over a few drops of oil and the head of the one blessed,
accompanied by a short incantation. I have had the ceremony seriously
commended or prescribed to me as a means of keeping in good health and
prosperity.
