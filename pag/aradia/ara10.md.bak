# CHAPTER VIII

### To Have a Good Vintage and Very Good Wine by the Aid of Diana

"Sweet is the vintage when the showering grapes  
In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,  
Purple and gushing."  
                        --Byron, *Don Juan*, c. 124.

"Vinum bonum et suave,  
Bonis bonum, pravis prave,  
O quam dulcis sapor--ave!  
Mundana lætitia!"  
                        --*Latin Songs, E. du Meril*.

He who would have a good vintage and fine wine, should take a horn full
of wine and with this go into the vineyards or farms wherever vines
grow, and then drinking from the horn, say:--

Bevo ma non bevo il vino,  
Bevo il sangue di *Diana*,  
Che da vino nel sangue di *Diana*  
Si deve convertire,  
E in tutte le mie viti  
Lo spandera,  
E buona raccolta nu verra  
E quando avro avuto buona raccolta, <span id="page_45">p. 45</span>  
Non saro ancora fuori di sciagura,  
Perche il vino cattivo mi puol venire  
Perche puol nascere l'uva  
A luna vecchia...  
E cosi il mio vino puole sempre andare  
In malora--ma io bevendo  
In questo corno, e bevendo il sangue,  
Il sangue di *Diana* col suo aiuto  
La mano alla Luna nuova io bacero,  
Che la mia uva possa guardare,  
Al momento che crea l'occhiolo  
Alla crescenza del uva  
E fino alla raccolta,  
Che possa venire il mio vino buono,  
E che si possa mantenere  
Da prendere molti quattrini,  
E possa entrare la buona fortuna  
Nelle mi e vigne,  
E nel miei poderi!

Quando il mio vino pendera  
Di andare male, il corno prendero,  
E forte, forte lo suonero,  
Nel punto della mezza notte,  
Dentro alla mia cantina lo suonero,  
Lo suonero tanto forte  
Che tu bella *Diana* anche da molto lontano,  
Tu lo possa sentire,  
E finestre e porte  
Con gran forza tu possa spalancare, <span id="page_46">p. 46</span>  
A gran corsa tu mi possa venire,  
A trovare, e tu possa salvarmi  
Il mio vino, e tu possa salvare,  
Salvare me da grande sciagura,  
Perche se il mio vino a male andera  
La miseria mi prendera.  
E col tuo aiuto bella *Diana*,  
Io saro salvato.

I drink, and yet it is not wine I drink,  
I drink the blood of *Diana*,  
Since from wine it has changed into her blood,  
And spread itself through all my growing vines,  
Whence it will give me good return in wines,  
Though even if good vintage should be mine,  
I'll not be free from care, for should it chance  
That the grape ripens in the waning moon,  
Then all the wine would come to sorrow, but  
If drinking from this horn I drink the blood--  
The blood of great *Diana*--by her aid--  
If I do kiss my hand to the new moon,  
Praying the Queen that she will guard my grapes,  
Even from the instant when the bud is horn  
Until it is a ripe and perfect grape,  
And onward to the vintage, and to the last  
Until the wine is made--may it be good!  
And may it so succeed that I from it  
May draw good profit when at last 'tis sold,  
So may good fortune come unto my vines,  
And into all my land where'er it be! <span id="page_46">p. 46</span>  
But should my vines seem in an evil way,  
I'll take my horn, and bravely will I blow  
In the wine-vault at midnight, and I'll make  
Such a tremendous and a terrible sound  
That thou, Diana fair, however far  
Away thou may'st be, still shalt hear the call,  
And casting open door or window wide,  
Shalt headlong come upon the rushing wind,  
And find and save me--that is, save my vines,  
Which will be saving me from dire distress;  
For should I lose them I'd be lost myself,  
But with thy aid, *Diana*, I'll be *saved*.

This is a very interesting invocation and tradition, and probably of
great antiquity from very striking intrinsic evidence. For it is firstly
devoted to a subject which has received little attention--the connection
of Diana as the moon with Bacchus, although in the great *Dizionario
Storico Mitologico*, by Pozzoli and others, it is expressly asserted
that in Greece her worship was associated with that of Bacchus,
Esculapius, and Apollo. The connecting link is the *horn*. In a medal of
Alexander Severus, Diana of Ephesus bears the horn of plenty. This is
the horn or horns of the new moon, sacred to Diana. According to
Callimachus, Apollo himself built an altar consisting entirely of horns
to *Diana*.

The connection of the horn with wine is

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

obvious. It was usual among the old Slavonians for the priest of
Svantevit, the Sun-god, to see if the horn which the idol held in his
hand was full of wine, in order to prophesy a good harvest for the
coming year. If it was filled, all was right; if not, he filled the
horn, drank from it, and replaced the horn in the hand, and predicted
that all would eventually go well. <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md)
It cannot fail to strike the reader that this ceremony is strangely like
that of the Italian invocation, the only difference being that in one
the Sun, and in the other the Moon is invoked to secure a good harvest.

In the *Legends of Florence* there is one of the Via del Corno, in which
the hero, falling into a vast tun or *tina* of wine, is saved from
drowning by sounding a horn with tremendous power. At the sound, which
penetrates to an incredible distance, even to unknown lands, all come
rushing as if enchanted to save him. In this conjuration, *Diana*, in
the depths of heaven, is represented as rushing at the sound of the
horn, and leaping through doors or windows to save the vintage of the
one who blows. There is a certain singular affinity in these stories.

In the story of the *Via del Corno*, the hero is

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

saved by the Red Goblin or Robin Goodfellow, who gives him a horn, and
it is the same sprite who appears in the conjuration of the Round Stone,
which is sacred to Diana. This is because the spirit is nocturnal, and
attendant on Diana Titania.

Kissing the hand to the new moon is a ceremony of unknown antiquity, and
Job, even in his time, regarded it as heathenish and forbidden which
always means antiquated and out of fashion--as when he declared (xxxi.
26, 27), "If I beheld the moon walking in brightness... and my heart
hath been secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand... this also
were an iniquity to be punished by the Judge, for I should have denied
the God that is above." From which it may or ought to be inferred that
Job did not understand that God made the moon and appeared in all His
works, or else he really believed the moon was an independent deity. In
any case, it is curious to see the old forbidden rite still living, and
as heretical as ever.

The tradition, as given to me, very evidently omits a part of the
ceremony, which may be supplied from classic authority. When the peasant
performs the rite, he must not act as once a certain African, who was a
servant of a friend of mine, did. The coloured man's duty was to pour

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

out every morning a libation of rum to a fetish and he poured it down
his own throat. The peasant should also sprinkle the vines, just as the
Devonshire farmers, who observed all Christmas ceremonies, sprinkled,
also from a horn, their apple-trees.
