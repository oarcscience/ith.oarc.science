# CHAPTER XIII

### Diana and the Children

"And there withall Diana gan appere  
With bowe in hand right as an Hunteresse,  
And saydê, 'Daughter, stint thine heavinesse!'  
And forth she wente and made a vanishing."  
    --Chaucer (*C. T.*), "*The Knight's Tale.*"

There was in Florence in the oldest time a noble family, but grown so
poor that their *giorni di festa* or feast-days were few and far
between. However, they dwelt in their old palace (which was in the
street now called La Via Cittadella), which was a fine old building, and
so they kept up a brave show before the world, when many a day they
hardly had anything to eat.

Round this palace was a large garden, in which stood an ancient marble
statue of *Diana*, like a beautiful woman who seemed to be running with
a dog by her side. She held in her hand a bow, and on her forehead was a
small moon. And it was said that by night, when all was still, the
statue became like life, and fled, and did not return till the moon set
or the sun rose.

The father of the family had two children, who were good and
intelligent. One day they came home with many flowers which had been
given to them, and the little girl said to her brother:--

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

"The beautiful lady with the bow ought to have some of these!"

Saying this, they laid flowers before the stature and made a wreath
which the boy placed on her head. Just then the great poet and magician
Virgil, who knew everything about the gods and fairies, entered the
garden and said, smiling:--

"You have made, the offering of flowers to the goddess quite correctly,
as they did of old; all that remains is to pronounce the prayer
properly, <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) and it is this:"

So he repeated the

Invocation to Diana.

Bella dea dell'arco!  
Bella dea delle freccie!  
Della caccia e dei cani!  
Tu vegli colle stelle,  
Quando il sole va dormir  
Tu colla luna in fronte  
Cacci la notte meglio del di.  
Colle tue Ninfe, al suono  
Di trombe--Sei la regina  
Dei cacciatori--regina delle notte,  
Tu che sei la cacciatrice  
Più potente di ogni,  
Cacciator--ti prego  
Pensa un poco a noi!

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

To Diana.

Lovely Goddess of the bow!  
Lovely Goddess of the arrows!  
Of all hounds and of all hunting  
Thou who wakest in starry heaven  
When the sun is sunk in slumber  
Thou with moon upon they forehead,  
Who the chase by night preferrest  
Unto hunting in the daylight,  
With thy nymphs unto the music  
Of the horn--thyself the huntress,  
And most powerful: I pray thee  
Think, although but for an instant,  
Upon us who pray unto thee! <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md)

Then Virgil taught them also the *Scongiurazione* or spell to be uttered
when good fortune or aught is specially required.

The Conjuration of Diana.

"Bella dea del arco del cielo!  
Delle stelle e della luna!  
La regina più potente  
Del cacciatori e della notte!  
    A te ricorriamo,  
    E chiediamo il tuo aiuto  
    Che tu possa darci  
Sempre la buona fortuna!"

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

Fair goddess of the rainbow,  
Of the stars and of the moon!  
The queen most powerful  
Of hunters and the night!  
    We beg of thee thy aid,  
    That thou may'st give to us  
The best of fortune ever!

Then he added. the conclusion:--

"Se la nostra scongiurazione  
Ascolterai,  
E buona fortuna ci darei,  
Un segnale a noi lo darei!"

If thou heed'st our evocation  
And wilt give good fortune to us,  
Then in proof give us a token! <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md)

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

And having taught them this, Virgil departed.

Then the children ran to tell their parents all that had happened, and
the latter impressed it on them to keep it a secret, nor breathe a word
or hint thereof to any one. But what was their amazement when they found
early the next morning before the statue a deer freshly killed, which
gave them good dinners for many a day; nor did they want thereafter at
any time game of all kinds, when the prayer had been devoutly
pronounced.

There was a neighbour of this family, a priest, who held in hate all the
ways and worship of the gods of the old time, and whatever did not
belong to his religion, and he, passing the garden one day, beheld the
statue of Diana crowned with roses and other flowers. And being in a
rage, and seeing in the street a decayed cabbage, he rolled it in the
mud, and threw it all dripping at the face Of the goddess, saying:--

"Ecco mala bestia d'idoli!  
Questo e l'omaggio che io ti do,  
Gia che il diavolo ti aiuta!"

Behold, thou vile beast of idolatry,  
This is the worship which thou hast from me,  
And the devil do the rest for thee!

Then the priest heard a voice in the gloom where the leaves were dense,
and it said:--

"Bene, bene! Tu mi hai fatto  
L'offrando--tu avrai  
La tua porzione  
Della mia caccia. Aspetta!"

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

It is well! I give thee warning,  
Since thou hast made thy offering,  
Sonic of the game to thee I'll bring;  
Thou'lt have thy share in the morning.

All that night the priest suffered from horrible dreams and dread, and
when at last, just before three o'clock, he fell asleep, he suddenly
awoke from a nightmare in which it seemed as if something heavy rested
on his chest. And something indeed fell from him and rolled on the
floor. And when he rose and picked it up, and looked at it by the light
of the moon, he saw that it was a human head, half decayed. <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md)

Another priest, who had heard his cry of terror, entered his room, and
having looked at the head, said:--

"I know that face! It is of a man whom I confessed, and who was beheaded
three months ago at Siena."

And three days after the priest who had insulted the goddess died.

The foregoing tale was not given to me as belonging to the Gospel of the
Witches, but as one  
of a very large series of traditions relating to Virgil as a magician.
But it has its proper place in  
this book, because it contains the invocation to and incantation of
Diana, these being remarkably beautiful and original. When we remember

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

how these "hymns" have been handed down or preserved by old women, and
doubtless much garbled, changed, and deformed by transmission, it cannot
but seem wonderful that so much classic beauty still remains in them,
as, for instance, in

"Lovely goddess of the bow!  
Lovely goddess of the arrow!  
Thou who walk'st in starry heaven!"

Robert Browning was a great poet, but if we compare all the Italian
witch-poems of and to *Diana* with the former's much-admired speech of
Diana-Artemis, it will certainly be admitted by impartial critics that
the spells are fully equal to the following by the bard--

"I am a goddess of the ambrosial courts,  
And save by Here, Queen of Pride, surpassed  
By none whose temples whiten this the world:  
Through Heaven I roll my lucid moon along,  
I shed in Hell o'er my pate people peace,  
On Earth, I, caring for the creatures, guard  
Each pregnant yellow wolf and fox-bitch sleek,  
And every feathered mother's callow brood,  
And all the love green haunts and loneliness."

This is pretty, but it is only imitation, and neither in form or spirit
really equal to the incantations, which are sincere in faith. And it may
here be observed in sorrow, yet in very truth, that in a very great
number of modern poetical handlings

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

of classic mythic subjects, the writers have, despite all their genius
as artists, produced rococo work which will appear to be such to an
other generation, simply from their having missed the point, or omitted
from ignorance something vital which the folk-lorist would probably not
have lost. *Achilles* may be admirably drawn, as I have seen him, in a
Louis XIV. wig with a Turkish scimitar, but still one could wish that
the designer had been a little more familiar with Greek garments and
weapons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_22"></span>[79:1](ara15.htm#fr_22.md) The most important part
of witchcraft is to *intone* or accent the incantations accurately, in a
manner like that of church chanting or Arab recitations. Hence the
apparently prose form of most spells.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[80:1](ara15.htm#fr_23.md) It is to be observed
that the invocation is strictly a psalm of praise or a hymn; the
*scongiurazione* is a request or prayer, though it often takes the form
of a threat or menace. This only exists in classic witchcraft.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[81:1](ara15.htm#fr_24.md) Something is here
omitted, which can, however, be supplied from many other similar
incantations. It was probably as follows:--

If thou art favourable  
And wilt grant my prayer,  
Then may I hear  
The bark of a dog,  
The neigh of a horse,  
The croaking of a frog,  
The chirp of a bird,  
The song of a cricket,  
                 

et cætera.

Three or four of these sounds were generally selected. They vary more or
less, but seldom materially, from these. Sometimes visible
manifestations, as, for instance, lightning, are requested. To see a
white horse is a sign that the prayer will be granted after some delay.
It also signifies victory.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[83:1](ara15.htm#fr_25.md) "La testa d'un uomo
piena di verme e puzzolente." A parody in kind for the decayed cabbage,
much completer than the end of the German tale resembling it.
