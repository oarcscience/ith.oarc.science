This classic of neo-Paganism is one of the few books which purports to
be an actual sacred text of traditional witchcraft, in particular that
of the Tuscan region of Italy. Charles Leland was an American expatriate
journalist, folklorist, and author. He based this book on material which
he received from a woman named Maddelena, who had assisted him in
collecting regional Italian folklore. On New Years day, 1897 she handed
over to him a document in her own handwriting, the *Vangel*, which is
the core of this book. Maddelena then reportedly went missing, and never
contacted Leland again.

The authenticity of Aradia has always been in question. Ronald Hutton,
in his scholarly study of the roots of neo-Paganism, The Triumph of the
Moon (Oxford University Press, 1999), presents three divergent theories
about Aradia: first, that is a genuine text of an underground Italian
Goddess religion, second, that Maddelena wrote it based on her family
tradition, or third, that Charles Leland forged it based on his
extensive knowledge of folklore. Each of these theories has pros and
cons: it may be that the second and third are closest to the truth.

Whatever the source of this material, it has had a profound impact on
the emergence of neo-Paganism, and is required reading for anyone
interested in the subject.

This version of the etext, originally scanned early in 2001, was
proofread a second time in July of 2002 and upgraded to current coding
standards of sacred-texts.
