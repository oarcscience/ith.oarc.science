# CHAPTER VI

### A Spell To Win Love

When a wizard, a worshipper of *Diana*, one who worships the Moon,
desires the love of a woman, he can change her into the form of a dog,
when she, forgetting who she is, and all things besides, will at once
come to his house, and there, when by him, take on again her natural
form and remain with him. And when it is time for her to depart, she
will again become a dog and go home, where she will turn into a girl.
And she will remember nothing of what has taken place, or at least but
little or mere fragments, which will seem as a confused dream. And she
will take the form of a dog because *Diana* has ever a dog by her side.

And this is the spell to be repeated by him who would bring a love to
his home. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)

To day is Friday, and I wish to rise very early, not having been able to
sleep all night, having seen a very beautiful girl, the daughter of a
rich lord, whom I dare not hope to win. Were she poor, I could gain her
with money; but as she is rich, I have no hope to do so. (Therefore will
I conjure *Diana* to aid me.)

Scongiurazione a Diana.

Diana, bella Diana!  
Che tanto bella e, buona siei,  
E tanto ti é piacere  
Ti ho fatto,  
Anche a te di fare al amore,  
Dunque spero che anche in questa cosa  
Tu mi voglia aiutare,  
E se tu vorrai  
Tutto tu potrai,  
Se questa grazia mi vorrai fare:  
Chiamerai tua figlia *Aradia*,  
Al letto della bella fanciulla  
La mandera *Aradia*,  
La fanciulla in una canina convertira,  
Alla camera mia la mandera,  
Ma entrata in camera mia,  
Non sara più una canina,  
Ma tornerà una bella fanciulla,  
Bella cane era prima,  
E cosi potrò fare al amore  
A mio piacimento,  
Come a me piacera.  
Quando mi saro divertito  
A mi piacere dirò.  
"Per volere della Fata Diana,  
E di sua figlia Aradia,  
Torna una canina  
Come tu eri prima!"

Invocation to Diana.

Diana, beautiful Diana!  
Who art indeed as good as beautiful,  
By all the worship I have given thee,  
And all the joy of love which thou hast known,  
I do implore thee aid me in my love!  
    What thou wilt 'tis true  
    Thou canst ever do:  
And if the grace I seek thou'lt grant to me,  
Then call, I pray, thy daughter Aradia,  
And send her to the bedside of the girl,  
And give that girl the likeness of a dog,  
And make her then come to me in my room,  
But when she once has entered it, I pray  
That she may reassume her human form,  
As beautiful as e'er she was before,  
And may I then make love to her until  
Our souls with joy are fully satisfied.  
Then by the aid of the great Fairy Queen  
And of her daughter, fair *Aradia*,  
May she be turned into a dog again,  
And then to human form as once before!

Thus it will come to pass that the girl as a dog will return to her home
unseen and unsuspected, for thus will it be effected by Aradia; and the
girl will think it is all a dream, because she will have been enchanted
by Aradia.

spell seems to be merely a prose introduction explaining the nature of
the ceremony.
