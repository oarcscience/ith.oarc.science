# CHAPTER V

### The Conjuration of the Lemon and Pins

Scongiurazione al Limone appuntato un Spille.

Sacred to Diana.

A lemon stuck full of pins of different colours always brings good
fortune.

If you receive as a gift a lemon full of pins of divers colours, without
any black ones among them, it signifies that your life will be perfectly
happy and prosperous and joyful.

But if some black pins are among them, you may enjoy good fortune and
health, yet mingled with troubles which may be of small account.
\[However, to lessen their influence, you must perform the following
ceremony, and pronounce this incantation, wherein all is also
described. <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md)\]

The Incantation to Diana.

Al punto di mezza notte  
Un limone ho raccolto,  
Lo raccolto nel giardino  
Ho raccolto un limone,

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Un arancio e un
mandarino,  
Cogliendo queste cose,  
Cogliendo, io ho detto;  
Tu, o Regina del sole  
Delia luna e delle stelle,  
Ti chiamo in mio ajuto  
E con quanta forza ho a te scongiuro  
Che una grazia tu mi voglia fare,  
Tre cose ho racolto nel giardino;  
Un limone, un arancio,  
E un mandarino; una  
Di queste cose per mia fortuna,  
Voglio tenere due  
Di questi oggetti di mano,  
E quello che dovra servirmi  
Per la buona fortuna  
Regina delle stelle:  
Fa lo rimanare in mia mano!

At the instant when the midnight came,  
I have picked a lemon in the garden,  
I have picked a lemon, and with it  
An orange and a (fragrant) mandarin.  
Gathering with care these (precious) things,  
And while gathering I said with care:  
"Thou who art Queen of the sun and of the moon  
And of the stars--lo! here I call to thee!  
And with what power I have I conjure thee  
To grant to me the favour I implore!  
Three things I've gathered in the garden here: <span id="page_31">p.
31</span>  
A lemon, orange, and a mandarin;  
I've gathered them to bring good luck to me.  
Two of them I do grasp here in my hand,  
And that which is to serve me for my fate,  
Queen of the stars!  
Then make that fruit remain firm in my grasp.

\[Something is here omitted in the MS. I conjecture that the two are
tossed without seeing them into the air, and if the lemon remains, the
ceremony proceeds as follows. This is evident, since in it the
incantation is confused with a prose direction how to act.\]

Saying this, one looks up at the sky, and I found the lemon in one hand,
and a voice said to me--

"Take many pins, and carefully stick them in the lemon, pins of many
colours; and as thou wilt have good luck, and if thou desirest to give
the lemon to any one or to a friend, thou shouldst stick in it many pins
of varied colours.

"But if thou wilt that evil befall any one, put in it black pins.

"But for this thou must pronounce a different incantation (thus)":--

Dia *Diana*, a te scongiuro!  
E te chiamo ad alta voce!  
Che tu non abbia pace ne bene  
Se non viene in mio aiuto <span id="page_32">p. 32</span>  
Domani al punto di mezzo giorno,  
Ti aspetto a quello punto  
Un bicchiere di vino portero,  
E una piccola lente al occhio  
E dentro tredici spilli,  
Spilli neri vi metterò,  
E tu *Diana* tutti  
I diavoli dell' inferno chiamerai,  
E in compagnia del sole il manderai,  
E tutto il fuoco dell'inferno preso di se  
Lo porteranno, e daranno forza,  
Al sole di farmi questo vino bollire,  
Perche questi spilli possano arroventire,  
E con questi il limone apunteró  
Per non dare più pace,  
E ne bene alla persona  
Che questo limone le presenterò!

Se questa grazia mi farete,  
Un segnale mi darete,  
Dentro tre giorni,  
Una cosa voglio vedere,  
O vento, o acqua, o grandine,  
Se questo segnale non avró,  
Piu pace *Diana* non te darò,  
Tanto di giorno che di notte,  
Sempre ti tormenterò.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

The Invocation to Diana.

Goddess Diana, I do conjure thee  
And with uplifted voice to thee I call,  
That thou shalt never have content or peace  
Until thou comest to give me all thy aid.  
Therefore to-morrow at the stroke of noon  
I'll wait for thee, bearing a cup of wine,  
Therewith a lens or a small burning-glass. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)  
And thirteen pins I'll put into the charm;  
Those which I put shall all indeed be black,  
But thou, *Diana*, thou wilt place them all!

And thou shalt call for me the fiends from hell;  
Thou'lt send them as companions of the Sun,  
And all the fire infernal of itself  
Those fiends shall bring, and bring with it the, power  
Unto the Sun to make this (red) wine boil, <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md)  
So that these pins by heat may be red-hot,  
And with them I do fill the lemon here,  
That unto her or him to who 'tis given is  
Peace and prosperity shall be unknown.

    If this grace I gain from thee  
    Give a sign, I pray, to me!

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

    Ere the third day  
    Shall pass away,  
Let me either hear or see  
A roaring wind, a rattling rain,  
Or hall a clattering on the plain;  
Till one of these three signs you show,  
Peace, *Diana*, thou shalt not know.  
Answer well the prayer I've sent thee,  
Or day and night will I torment thee!

As the orange was the fruit of the Sun, so is the lemon suggestive of
the Moon or Diana, its colour being of the lighter yellow. However, the
lemon specially chosen for the charm is always a green one, because it
"sets hard" and turns black. It is not generally known that orange and
lemon peel, subjected to pressure and combined with an adhesive may be
made into a hard substance which can be moulded or used for many
purposes. I have devoted a chapter to this in an as yet unpublished work
entitled *One Hundred Minor Arts*. This was suggested to me by the
hardened lemon given to me for a charm by a witch.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_11"></span>[29:1](ara07.htm#fr_11.md) This passage is not
given in the original MS., but it is necessary to clearly explain what
follows abruptly.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[33:1](ara07.htm#fr_12.md) This appears from very
early ages, as in Roman times, to have been regarded as gifted with
magic properties, and was used in occult ceremonies.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[33:2](ara07.htm#fr_13.md) That is, *Diana* is
invoked to send demons with the very life of the fire of hell to still
more increase that of the sun to intensify the wine.
