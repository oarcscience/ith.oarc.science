<p>Please read this carefully as there will be a quiz afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is Intangible Textual Heritage?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> This site strives to produce the best possible transcriptions of
public domain texts on the subject of religion, mythology, folklore and
the esoteric. The texts are posted for free access on the Internet.
<strong>This site is like a public library</strong>: it is accessible to anyone,
contains unfiltered information, and does not advocate any particular
point of view. However, nobody is going to shush you if you make too
much noise while using this site.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Who are you and what qualifies you to do this?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> My name is John B. Hare, and I live in California. My academic
background is in Linguistics, Anthropology and Computer Science, and I
worked in the high technology field as a computer programmer and
entrepreneur for twenty five years prior to starting this site.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did you do it?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> To do something nice for people.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will you link to my site?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sorry, but no. The site isnâ€™t about links, itâ€™s about texts.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I use stuff from this site?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sure. Most of the site is not copyrighted. Some parts of the site
are copyrighted. Please donâ€™t copy those parts. Everything else, you can
use for anything you can dream up.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Did you write all this stuff?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> No. Most of it was written by dead people, a long time ago.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Some take the name of the site a bit too literally. This leads to
numerous misconceptions:</em></p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Book X</em> isnâ€™t at your site. Does that mean it is not a sacred
text?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> No. It may not be public domain, or we may not have got around to
posting it. But omitting it from the site doesnâ€™t imply that we donâ€™t
think it is or isnâ€™t a sacred-text.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Book X</em> is at your site. Does that mean that it is a sacred
text?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> No. Not everything at this site is a sacred text in the strict
sense.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong> But what do <em>you</em> believe?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> The site isnâ€™t about me, itâ€™s about the texts.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I want you to promote my book/website/guru.<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sorry. That is not our mission.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I advertise at this website?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sure, go to Google, and sign up for the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/ads/">Google AdWords
program</a>. Google AdWords is the
only way to place an advertisement at the site. IMPORTANT: If you have
any questions about Google AdWords, please direct those to Googleâ€™s
support staff, not this site.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I want you to place a text ad at your site, but donâ€™t want to use
Googleâ€™s AdWords, canâ€™t you make an exception.<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sorry. Sign up for the Google AdWords program if you want to
advertise at this site.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are appropriate things to email sacred-texts about?<br />

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you determine the public domain status of a book?<br />
<strong>A:</strong></p>

<p>COPYRIGHT POLICY</p>

</div>

<p>Anything published by the US Government Printing Office is also public
domain in the US, regardless of the year of publication.</p>

<p>This is based on US Copyright law, since we are physically located in
the US. We need some very compelling reasons to post anything outside of
these parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I volunteer to help build the site?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Click on â€˜Volunteerâ€™ in the left hand menu on this page.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I have a text to submit to the site, what file format do you
want?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Anything but PDF! The file has to be converted into HTML to be
posted at the site, and so it needs to be something that Microsoft Word
can read: RTF, DOC, TXT, etc. PDF files canâ€™t be converted into HTML
easily.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I link to this website?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sure, you have my permission.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why wonâ€™t you exchange links with my website?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> We do add links to other sites occasionally but that is usually
because they have a mission and content which is similar to this site,
or have helped us in some fashion. Usually these show up on our radar
long before anyone contacts us about them. And those sites are very
rare.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you add a link to <em>X</em>?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> This site is preponderantly about content rather than links. We
would rather add a whole etext than one link. For one thing, links are
hard to maintain. There was a link at this site which we added in
attribution to the contributor of an etext; a year later the domain
expired and was taken over by a porn operator. We didnâ€™t know that until
an attentive reader emailed us, and of course we took the link down
quickly. We are reluctant to add links casually.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to pay you to use the public domain material from your
website at mine?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> No.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I use the public domain material from your site in my book?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> You have my permission.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I want to pay you a reasonable fee for commercial use of material
from the site even though Iâ€™m aware that the content is in the public
domain.<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Thanks! Please contact us for licensing information. We can
provide high resolution images and master files in most cases.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> My publisher wants you to clear the copyright on public domain
material from your site which Iâ€™ve quoted in my book.<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sorry, we have no legal authority to do this because the
copyright has expired and we did not own it even when it was in force.
If you need a legal opinion on the copyright status of a work please ask
a copyright lawyer.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Iâ€™m looking for a particular book.<br />
<strong>A:</strong> See the books page (click on â€˜Booksâ€™ in the left hand menu on
this page).</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Please add <em>Urantia</em>, <em>Course in Miracles</em>, Scientology, the
Unification Church, Soka Gakkai, The Church of Satan, the <em>Kolbrin</em>,
etc.<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sorry. We canâ€™t because the copyrights for these texts havenâ€™t
expired yet by our copyright policy (see the COPYRIGHT POLICY chart
above). It doesnâ€™t mean we donâ€™t respect these belief systems, just that
we would get in big legal trouble if we added their texts. However, if
you are the copyright holder of one of these books, and want it
published at Intangible Textual Heritage for free distribution on the
Internet, please contact us, <strong>principals only</strong> (i.e., donâ€™t make such
a proposal if you are not the copyright holder or their representative).</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Please add the <em>Gospel of Judas</em>, the Dead Sea Scrolls, The
Qumran texts, etc.<br />
<strong>A:</strong> No public domain translation of any of these texts exists, as far
as we know.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> But you cover Neo-Paganism, isnâ€™t that recent?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> This is a bit different. Even though Neo-Paganism itself is
comparatively recent (post-World War II), it emerged from historical
belief systems. There are numerous books in the public domain about
these belief systems, as can be seen on the Neo-Paganism page.
Furthermore, there is no centralized institution which runs
Neo-Paganism, and numerous individual Neo-Pagans have shown a
willingness to release their copyrighted documents for free electronic
redistribution, as can be seen in the Internet Book of Shadows. This is
in contrast to the Urantia Foundation and Scientology, which have
vigorously used copyright lawsuits to attempt to restrict or control
electronic redistribution of their materials. This is not a value
judgment about Urantia or Scientology, simply a statement of fact.</p>

<p>Funny story actuallyâ€¦. I was actually contacted by a very testy lawyer
from the Scientologists at one point. She was more than a bit bothered
that I refused to post anything about them, until I pointed out that
they had sued everyone aggressively for posting proprietary material
about them for years, and now they expected me to cover them? She
finally admitted that I had a point thereâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why all the short files? I want to download the entire book in
one file!<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sorry. The short files are for technical reasons which greatly
reduce the cost of hosting the site. Newer books typically have a
one-file text-only version, which is optimized for screen reader
software. Look for the links on the index pages that say â€˜Textâ€™
[Zipped]</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Examples of what material at the site is not in the public
domain?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> This includes (but is not limited to) the following. Any page
with an explicit copyright notice. Any page named â€˜index.htm,â€™ or
filling the role of an â€˜indexâ€™ file. Any introductory material which
Iâ€™ve written with a byline, (or not), specifically the short
descriptions on the category index pages and the introductory essays on
the book index pages. Any image (graphics file) specifically labeled as
copyrighted, e.g. the â€˜Standing Stonesâ€™ graphic. Material derived from
bulletin board postings or contributed by the author, specifically
material indexed in the Internet Book of Shadows, Zen Buddhism, Tibetan
Buddhism, and the UFO files sections. Any JavaScript program,
specifically the Tarot card reader, the pages in the Calendars section,
and the site catalog.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I want the entire site translated.<br />
<strong>A:</strong> The site is so massive, it is impractical to do so. You can
machine-translate the site online using any babelfish service. (click on
â€˜Translateâ€™ in the left hand menu on this page)</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is B.C.E. and C.E.?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Before Common Era and Common Era. These are the same as B.C.
(Before Christ) and A.D. (Anno Dominiâ€”â€™Year of our Lordâ€™ in Latin).
Since the purpose of this site is to serve readers of all religions I
have adopted this terminology because not everyone uses the birth of
Christ as a reference point. The dates correspond to the civil calendar
used by most Western countries. However, where B.C. and A.D. occur in
scanned texts, I have not altered them.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why only ten volumes of the Talmud?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> This was as much as the translator (Rodkinson) was able to
publish prior to 1923 (or ever). The first complete English translation
was not published until 1930 in London, which puts it off-limits in
terms of our copyright policy.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> If you are having trouble hosting the site, why not use a free
hosting service?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> They would have to pay the same amount to host these files, so
that wouldnâ€™t solve anything.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why not get grants to fund the site?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> That would be incompatible with our tax status.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why not distribute the site solely through bittorrent?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> The site is meant to be accessible to everyone with a web
browser. Downloading, installing, and fine-tuning bittorrent is beyond
the capability of the casual Internet users who are the vast majority of
this siteâ€™s audience.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you have any banners I can use?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sure, there are two banners you can download from the following
URLs to put at your site: https://ith.oarc.science/stban.gif and
https://ith.oarc.science/stauxban.gif.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Someone is selling the Internet Book of Shadows on EBay.<br />
<strong>A:</strong> This was a bit of a problem until I posted the entire IBOS in a
zip file. It still occurs, and there is still little that can be done
about it.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where is the Jewish Publication Society Bible?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> We are redoing the text which was previously posted, for legal
reasons. Each book will be posted as it is complete at
https://ith.oarc.science/bib/jps/index.htm. It will also be incorporated
into the Tanach (Hebrew Bible) section when complete.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you post book <em>X</em> so I can read it before midterms?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Sorry, I canâ€™t guarantee the date Iâ€™ll post any specific book.
Normally I have a very long queue of items to scan and proof, so if you
ask me today, it could be months or years before it actually appears at
the site.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I thought there was a copyright exemption for religious texts,
why so picky about copyrights?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Thatâ€™s an urban legend.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why donâ€™t you post [some text]. Of course it is in the public
domain, it can be found posted all over the web!<br />
<strong>A:</strong> That means nothing. People pirate copyrighted material on the web
all the time. If you see a text elsewhere on the Internet, even if the
site claims that it is in the public domain, that is no indication as to
its actual copyright status.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are you publishing Masonic secrets?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> All text at this site in the Freemasonry section is from public
domain books, most of which have been in print for over a century. For
instance, my copy of Duncanâ€™s Ritual was purchased off-the-shelf at a
large chain bookstore. So these are hardly secret anymore, and hence it
makes no sense to blame this site for publishing these texts.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are you publishing tribal secrets?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> All of these books have been sitting on library shelves for, in
most cases, over a century.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will the world end in 2012?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Probably not.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What about the quiz?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> There is no quiz. Nor is there any cake.</p>
