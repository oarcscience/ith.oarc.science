### JAGADAMBIKĀ <span id="fr_816"></span>[1](#fn_811.md)

### FROM THE DEVĪBHĀGAVATA PURĀṆA <span id="fr_817"></span>[2](#fn_812.md)

1

IT is by Thy power only  
That Brahmā creates, Viṣṇu maintains,  
And at the end of things Śiva destroys the universe.  
Powerless are they for this but by Thy help.  
Therefore it is that Thou alone art the Creatrix,  
Maintainer, and Destructress of the world. <span
id="fr_818"></span>[3](#fn_813.md)

2

Thou art fame, mind, remembrance,  
And our refuge, the mountain-born, <span
id="fr_819"></span>[4](#fn_814.md)  
Companion, kindness, faith, and patience,  
Earth, Kamalā, <span id="fr_820"></span>[5](#fn_815.md) health, <span
id="fr_821"></span>[6](#fn_816.md) the arts, and victory,

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Contentment, ever victorious, <span id="fr_822"></span>[1](#fn_817.md)
Umā, <span id="fr_823"></span>[2](#fn_818.md) Ramā, <span
id="fr_824"></span>[3](#fn_819.md)  
True knowledge, and the highest *buddhi*. <span
id="fr_825"></span>[4](#fn_820.md)

3

Science, forgiveness, beauty, retentiveness art Thou, <span
id="fr_826"></span>[5](#fn_821.md)  
Who art Known in the three worlds as all in all.  
Who is there that unaided by Thee can do ought?  
Thou art the abode wherein all men dwell. <span
id="fr_827"></span>[6](#fn_822.md)

4

Thou art the upholder.  
Were Thou not so, how could the tortoise and serpent uphold the
Earth? <span id="fr_828"></span>[7](#fn_823.md)  
Thou art the Earth itself.  
Were this not so, how could this weighty world rest on Ether? <span
id="fr_829"></span>[8](#fn_824.md)

5

Those who through Thy *māyā* pray to Devas,  
Such as <span id="fr_830"></span>[9](#fn_825.md) the four-headed One <span
id="fr_831"></span>[10](#fn_826.md), Viṣṇu, Rudra, <span
id="fr_832"></span>[11](#fn_827.md) Fire,

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

The White-rayed one <span id="fr_833"></span>[1](#fn_828.md) Yama, <span
id="fr_834"></span>[2](#fn_829.md) Vāyu, <span
id="fr_835"></span>[3](#fn_830.md) and Gaṇeśa <span
id="fr_836"></span>[4](#fn_831.md)  
Are indeed ignorant, <span id="fr_837"></span>[5](#fn_832.md)  
For can these do anything without Thy power? <span
id="fr_838"></span>[6](#fn_833.md)

6

O Mother! those who do *homa*,  <span id="fr_839"></span>[7](#fn_834.md)
with ghee on fire,  
With great ceremony in the name of the Devas,  
Are of but small intelligence. <span id="fr_840"></span>[8](#fn_835.md)  
If Thou art not *svāhā*, <span id="fr_841"></span>[9](#fn_836.md) then how
can they make sacrifice?  
Do they not worship Thee?  
If not they are ignorant. <span id="fr_842"></span>[10](#fn_837.md)

7

In this world Thou art the giver of enjoyment  
To things which move and are still. <span
id="fr_843"></span>[11](#fn_838.md)  
Thou givest life to all things being as they are parts of Thee.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

O Mother! as Thou nourisheth all Thy Suras, <span
id="fr_844"></span>[1](#fn_839.md)  
So also dost Thou nourish others.

8

O Mother! as men who are of good heart,  
Never for the mere pleasure thereof  
Cut down leafless and bitter (fruited) trees  
Which have sprung up in the forest.  
Therefore Thou dost even greatly protect the Daityas. <span
id="fr_845"></span>[2](#fn_840.md)

9

Though Thou slayest in the battlefield with Thy arrows the enemies,  
Knowing their desire for amorous play with celestial women, <span
id="fr_846"></span>[3](#fn_841.md)  
Yet such is Thy nature that even then Thou showest kindness to them.  
For Thou so slayest them  
That in another body <span id="fr_847"></span>[4](#fn_842.md) they may
obtain fulfilment of their desires.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

10

Most wonderful it is that Thou hast assumed body  
For the destruction of the Dānavas, <span
id="fr_848"></span>[1](#fn_843.md) famed for their power,  
When Thou mightest have slain them by Thy mere will.  
The cause of this is Thy play <span id="fr_849"></span>[2](#fn_844.md) and
nothing else, <span id="fr_850"></span>[3](#fn_845.md)

11

Alas! of a verity unhappy are they  
Who when the Kālī age, the worst of ages, has come,  
Do not worship Thee.  
Men cunning and skilled in the Purāṇas  
Have made the people devoted to the worship of Hari and Śankara, <span
id="fr_851"></span>[4](#fn_846.md)  
Who are but Thy creatures. <span id="fr_852"></span>[5](#fn_847.md)

12

Those who worship with devotion Devas,  
Though they know that they are distressed, harassed by Asuras, and
subject to Thy control,  
Are of a surety like unto a man

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

Who with, the light of a clear lamp in his [hands](errata.htm#15.md),  
Yet falls into some waterless and terrible well. <span
id="fr_853"></span>[1](#fn_848.md)

13

O Mother! Thou art the remover of the pains which arise from birth,  
And art known by those desirous of liberation  
As the giver of happiness when Thou art *vidyā*, <span
id="fr_854"></span>[2](#fn_849.md)  
And of unhappiness when Thou art *avidyā*, <span
id="fr_855"></span>[2](#fn_849.md)  
Surely it is only the ignorant who do not worship Thee,  
Such as are attached to enjoyment without wisdom. <span
id="fr_856"></span>[3](#fn_850.md)

14

Even Brahmā, Hara, and Hari, as all other Suras, <span
id="fr_857"></span>[4](#fn_851.md)  
Ever worship Thy lotus feet, which are our refuge.  
But those who are of small intelligence and beset with error  
Do not worship Thee.  
And so ever repeatedly fall into the ocean of the world. <span
id="fr_858"></span>[5](#fn_852.md)

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

15

O Caṇḍī! <span id="fr_859"></span>[1](#fn_853.md) it is most surely by the
favour of the dust on Thy lotus feet  
That Brahmā in the beginning of things creates, Shauri <span
id="fr_860"></span>[2](#fn_854.md) protects, and Hara <span
id="fr_861"></span>[3](#fn_855.md) destroys the whole world.  
He is indeed unfortunate  
Who in this world does not worship Thee.

16

O Devī! Thou art the *Devatā* of speech of both Suras and Asuras.  
Without power of speech are even the foremost of Devas  
When Thou abidest not in them.  
If men do speak, it is because they are not deprived of Thee. <span
id="fr_862"></span>[4](#fn_856.md)

17

Hari, <span id="fr_863"></span>[5](#fn_857.md) when cursed by the greatly
angered Bhrigu, <span id="fr_864"></span>[6](#fn_858.md)

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

Became Fish, Tortoise, Boar, and Man-lion, <span
id="fr_865"></span>[1](#fn_859.md) and Dwarf. <span
id="fr_866"></span>[2](#fn_860.md)  
How can those who worship Him  
Escape the fire of death?

18

As is well-known, the *linga* of Śambhu <span
id="fr_867"></span>[3](#fn_861.md) in the forest  
Fell on earth in like manner by the curse of Bhrigu.  
How can those, O Mother! who on earth worship Him <span
id="fr_868"></span>[4](#fn_862.md) who holds a skull  
Attain to happiness either in this world or the next?

19

They who worship the elephant-faced Lord of Ganas, <span
id="fr_869"></span>[5](#fn_863.md)  
Who was born of Maheśa,  
With Him in vain take shelter.  
They know Thee not, O Devī! Mother of the Universe,  
Who art easy of worship <span id="fr_870"></span>[6](#fn_864.md) and the
giver of the fruit of all desires.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

20

Wonderful it is that through Thy compassion  
Even the multitude of enemies slain by Thy sharpened arrows  
Have thus been made to reach Heaven.  
For had they not been so slain  
Calamities and the most painful of painful states would they have
suffered  
In that hell which is the result of their (evil) *karma*.

21

Even Brahmā, Hara, and Hari  
From pride <span id="fr_871"></span>[1](#fn_865.md) know not Thy power.  
How, then, are others able to know it,  
Bewildered as they are by Thy (three) *guṇas* of incomparable
power? <span id="fr_872"></span>[2](#fn_866.md)

22

Even *Munis* <span id="fr_873"></span>[3](#fn_867.md) suffer, who, being
ignorant (of Thee).  
Do not adore Thy thought-transcending lotus feet,  
And are set upon the worship of sun and fire. <span
id="fr_874"></span>[4](#fn_868.md)  
By them, even though they read hundreds of Śruti, <span
id="fr_875"></span>[5](#fn_869.md)

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

The Supreme object of desire <span id="fr_876"></span>[1](#fn_870.md) is
not known, which is the essence of all Vedas.

23

Methinks it is Thy (three) *guṇas*,  
The power of which is so famed on earth,  
Which makes men turn away from devotion (to Thee),  
And attaches them to Viṣṇu, Īśa, <span id="fr_877"></span>[2](#fn_871.md)
Bhāskara, <span id="fr_878"></span>[3](#fn_872.md) Gaṇeśa,  
By (the teaching of) various *Āgamas* <span
id="fr_879"></span>[4](#fn_873.md) of their own devising. <span
id="fr_880"></span>[5](#fn_874.md)

24

O Ambikā! (so great is Thy mercy)  
That Thou art not angry with,  
But showest kindness to, and maketh greatly prosperous  
Even those who, skilful in the *mantra* of delusion, <span
id="fr_881"></span>[6](#fn_875.md)

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

Make the best of men <span id="fr_882"></span>[1](#fn_876.md) turn away
from Thy feet  
By Agamas made by themselves, <span id="fr_883"></span>[2](#fn_877.md)  
Teaching of devotion to Hari and Hara. <span
id="fr_884"></span>[3](#fn_878.md)

25

In the Satya age <span id="fr_885"></span>[4](#fn_879.md) the *sattva
guṇa* <span id="fr_886"></span>[5](#fn_880.md) was very powerful,  
Therefore there were no *Asadāgamas*. <span
id="fr_887"></span>[6](#fn_881.md)  
But in the Kalī age learned folk conceal Thee (from the people).  
And adore those Devas imagined by them (to be objects of worship). <span
id="fr_888"></span>[7](#fn_882.md)

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

26

Munis, <span id="fr_889"></span>[1](#fn_883.md) in whom the *sattva
guṇa* <span id="fr_890"></span>[2](#fn_884.md) is very pure,  
Meditate upon Thee,  
Who art the giver on earth of the fruit of liberation,  
Who art perfect in *yoga* <span id="fr_891"></span>[3](#fn_885.md) and the
supreme knowledge.  
Such never again suffer pain in the womb of a mother. <span
id="fr_892"></span>[4](#fn_886.md)  
They are only praiseworthy who are absorbed in Thee.

27

*Cītśakti* <span id="fr_893"></span>[5](#fn_887.md) is in *Paramātmā*,  
Therefore also it is manifested <span id="fr_894"></span>[6](#fn_888.md) in
the world,  
Wherein it is known as the cause of its creation, maintenance, and
destruction. <span id="fr_895"></span>[7](#fn_889.md)

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

Who else in this world without Thee and of his own power  
Is able to create, move and destroy? <span
id="fr_896"></span>[1](#fn_890.md)

28

O Mother of the world!  
Can the *Tattvas*, <span id="fr_897"></span>[2](#fn_891.md) deprived of
*Cit*, <span id="fr_898"></span>[3](#fn_892.md) create the world?  
They are lifeless things. <span id="fr_899"></span>[4](#fn_893.md)  
O Devī! can the *indriyas* <span id="fr_900"></span>[5](#fn_894.md) with
their objects and functions, <span id="fr_901"></span>[6](#fn_895.md)  
Bear fruit without Thee?

29

O Mother! had you not as *Svāhā* <span id="fr_902"></span>[7](#fn_896.md)
been the cause thereof,  
Even the Devas could not have obtained their enjoined own portion,  
Offered in sacrificial rites by *Munis* <span
id="fr_903"></span>[8](#fn_897.md).

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

Therefore Thou maintainest the whole world. <span
id="fr_904"></span>[1](#fn_898.md)

30

By Thee all this universe was in the beginning of things created;  
Thou protecteth the Regents of the Quarters among whom Hari and Hara are
foremost.  
At the dissolution of things Thou devourest the whole universe.  
That which has been done by Thee from the creation  
Even Devas <span id="fr_905"></span>[2](#fn_899.md) know not.  
What, then, shall we say of unfortunate men?

31

O Mother! Thou hast by slaying the greatly formidable Asura,  
Who assumed the form of a buffalo, <span
id="fr_906"></span>[3](#fn_900.md)  
Protected the Devas.  
Even the Vedas know Thee not as Thou really art. <span
id="fr_907"></span>[4](#fn_901.md)  
Small of intellect as we are how can we praise Thee?

32

O Mother! Thou hast accomplished a great work In destroying this wicked
foe of ours,  
A thorn painful beyond all thought  
(In the side of) the whole world.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

Thy fame will spread throughout the whole universe.  
Do Thou, whose power is known to be incomparable,  
By Thy mercy protect us. <span id="fr_908"></span>[1](#fn_902.md)

have their being. She is as *Ādhāraśakti*, their support (N.).

<span id="fn_823"></span>[136:7](htg22.htm#fr_828.md) As the Purāṇas
represent them as doing. The verse deals with the attributes of the
*ādhāraśakti*.

<span id="fn_824"></span>[136:8](htg22.htm#fr_829.md) *Gaganam*.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[136:9](htg22.htm#fr_830.md) Literally, "headed

children.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[138:2](htg22.htm#fr_845.md) That is, the Devī
does not slay even the Daityas for the mere savage pleasure of killing,
and even those whom She slays are slain by Her for the good of the world
and their own good, that being slain by Her hand they may go to heaven
(see next verse). The Kumārasambhavam says that a man cannot cut down
even a poisonous tree if planted by his own hand.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[138:4](htg22.htm#fr_847.md) That is, a celestial
body. For, as Daityas do not perform sacrificial rites, etc., so they
cannot gain heaven. But when killed by the hand of the Devī, thither
they go to their enjoyment, and Devas are protected.

kaivalyam*).

<span id="fn_847"></span>[139:5](htg22.htm#fr_852.md)

*Dhūrttaīh purāṇa caturairhari śankarānām,  
Sevāparāshcha vihitāstava nirmitānām*.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Men, the verse
says, thus worship the creature instead of the Creatrix.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[140:1](htg22.htm#fr_853.md)

*Jnātvā surāmstava vashān asurārddhitāngshcha,

Bhrāntāh patanti satatam bhavasāgarete*.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[141:1](htg22.htm#fr_859.md) Nīlakantha derives
the word from *chadi* ("the wrathful one fearful to the whole world").
Śruti says of the Brahman: *Mahadbhayam vajramudhyatam* ("great fear and
a ready thunderbolt")

<span id="fn_854"></span>[141:2](htg22.htm#fr_860.md) Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[141:3](htg22.htm#fr_861.md) Śiva.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[141:4](htg22.htm#fr_862.md) Sarasvatī is She who
causes speech. Sound springing from the Mūlādhāra wherein is *Devī*
Kuṇḍalinī proceeds from the stage of mere sound (para), the potentiality
of growth in the seed to that of *Paśyantī*, when the latter begins to
sprout; then to *Madhyamā*, when the first two small leaves appear but
inseparate, and lastly, as *Vaikharī*, when they separate, remaining
united only at their base.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[141:5](htg22.htm#fr_863.md) Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[141:6](htg22.htm#fr_864.md) The Ṛṣi of that name.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[142:1](htg22.htm#fr_865.md) The Matsya, Kūrma,
Varāha, and Nrisingha avatāra of Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[142:2](htg22.htm#fr_866.md) *Chalakrit*, which
Nīlakantha says = Vāmana Avatāra of Viṣṇu. *Chalakrit*, because Balirāja
was deceived by him.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[142:3](htg22.htm#fr_867.md) Śiva, who retired
into the forest after the death of Satī, and who was powerless to
protect even his own *linga*.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[142:4](htg22.htm#fr_868.md) Śiva.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[142:5](htg22.htm#fr_869.md) Gaṇeśa, son of Śiva,
so powerless.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[142:6](htg22.htm#fr_870.md) Devī is (as the
Lalitā, verse 133, also says), "easily worshipped" (*sukhā-rādhyā*),
without bodily pain by fasting etc., without restrictions on. the mode
of meditation. In the Karma Pr. the Lord describes to Himavat an easy
mode of worship if he be unable to meditate on the Supreme Form. The
Devī is also "easily pleased" (Lalitā, verse 162,
*kṣipraprasādinī*)--that is, even by a little worship as the Saura and
Śiva Purāṇas say of the Lord of Umā, with whom the Devī is one.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[143:1](htg22.htm#fr_871.md) *Garvabhāvāt*.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[143:2](htg22.htm#fr_872.md) Devī is
"all-bewildering" (*Sarvamohinī*). In Karma Pr., Śiva says: "This Māyā
is dear to me by which the world is bewildered. I bewilder the whole
universe with the Devas, Daityas, and men." The operation of the
*tāmasika guṇa* veils from them the truth.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[143:3](htg22.htm#fr_873.md) The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa
says: "That Divine Devī Mahāmāyā forcibly draws away the minds of even
the sages (*Munis*), and leads them into confusion."

<span id="fn_868"></span>[143:4](htg22.htm#fr_874.md) Because they are
*pratyakṣadevatā*--that is, visible, and She, the supreme ground of
them, is beyond vision, mind, and speech.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[143:5](htg22.htm#fr_875.md) The reading of much
*śruti* (revelation) teaches them nothing, for their ignorance conceals
from them its true meaning.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[144:1](htg22.htm#fr_876.md) *Paramārthatattva*.
Śankhya says that there are two different kinds of *artha* or object.
One is *bhoga* (enjoyment), the second, which is the supreme object
(*paramārtha*) is *mokṣa* (liberation). The one exists in the current
issuing from Devī (*Avidyā*), the other returns on the other current,
which draws to the Devī (*Vidyā*).

<span id="fn_871"></span>[144:2](htg22.htm#fr_877.md) Śiva.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[144:3](htg22.htm#fr_878) The Sun (*Sūrya*.md).

<span id="fn_873"></span>[144:4](htg22.htm#fr_879.md) Here used generally
for *Śāstra*, though also used in a special sense as denoting Veda and
Tantra, to the latter of which, Nīlakantha perhaps refers.
*Nānātantraihmohakaih* ("many deluding Tantras"). The reference is here
to the dualistic scriptures.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[144:5](htg22.htm#fr_880.md)
*Svabuddhirachitairvividhāgamaishcha* ("composed by themselves").

<span id="fn_875"></span>[144:6](htg22.htm#fr_881.md) *Mohamantranipunām*.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[145:1](htg22.htm#fr_882.md) According to
Nīlakantha, Brāhmanas.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[145:2](htg22.htm#fr_883.md) Literally, "said by
themselves" (*svoktāgamaih*)--that is as Nīlakantha says,
*puruṣapranitāgamaih* (or Āgamas composed by men and not revealed by
Śiva).

<span id="fn_878"></span>[145:3](htg22.htm#fr_884.md) Viṣṇu and Śiva who
are themselves only the children of the Mother, and as much creatures,
though of the highest kind, as others are.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[145:4](htg22.htm#fr_885.md) The first and best of
the four ages: Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara, and Kalī, the commonly supposed
present age. In the second, virtue (*dharma*) decreased by a quarter, in
the third by a half, and in the present or Kalī age only a quarter of
*dharma* remains.

<span id="fn_880"></span>[145:5](htg22.htm#fr_886.md) The *guṇa*, which
manifests on the moral plane as goodness.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[145:6](htg22.htm#fr_887.md) Literally, "bad
Āgama," a name applied by some to the Tantra of the "downward current"
(*arddharetas*), but here has a general significance to all *Śāstra*,
whether Tantra or otherwise, of a dualistic character
(*asachchhāstrāni*).

<span id="fn_882"></span>[145:7](htg22.htm#fr_888.md)

*Tūrye yuge bhavati chātibalang gun.asya,  
Turyasyatena māthitānyasadāgamāni tvam,  
Gopayanti nipunāh kavayah kalauvai  
Tatkalpitān suraganā napi sangstuvanti*,

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Imagined by them"
(*tatkalpitān*). This does not mean that the Devas do not exist. Hari,
Hara, Īśa, Gaṇeśa, Bhāskara, and others have been mentioned in previous
verses. The verse is *stutivāda*, in which that which is its direct
object, is dealt with to <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> the exclusion
of all others. What is meant is that She alone is to be worshipped and
not any other. *Kalpanā* is to mistake one thing for another. Thus the
world is taken (*kalpitā*) to be real when the Brahman alone is so. And
so, too, mother-of-pearl is mistaken for silver (*shuktirajatakalpanā*),
or a rope for a snake (*rajjusarpakalpanā*); so people take the Devas to
be the ultimate object of worship when it is only the Devī whose
manifestations they are, who is such.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[146:3](htg22.htm#fr_891.md) *Yogasiddhām*. The
manifested Devī as Umā was a great *yoginī*.

<span id="fn_886"></span>[146:4](htg22.htm#fr_892.md) Are never reborn.
According to Hindu ideas the child suffers great pain and misery in the
womb of its mother, the remembrance of which is lost on its birth into
the world.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[146:5](htg22.htm#fr_893.md) That is, *caitanya*
(Nīlakantha). See the Samkṣepaśāriraka.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[146:6](htg22.htm#fr_894.md) In name and form
(*nāmarūpātmaka*.).

<span id="fn_889"></span>[146:7](htg22.htm#fr_895.md) *Bhavakrityakartā*.
Literally, "performer of worldly action"--that is, those stated. For,
according to Vedānta and Nyāya, it works therein by its Śakti, though in
Śankhya the Puruṣa is merely an enjoyer, spectator, and witness
(*bhoktā*, *draṣtā*, *sākṣī*).

<span id="fn_890"></span>[147:1](htg22.htm#fr_896.md) Cf.
Dakṣinamūrtisamhitā.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[147:2](htg22.htm#fr_897.md) The twenty-four
beginning with *Mahat*.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[147:3](htg22.htm#fr_898.md) *Vide ante*.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[147:4](htg22.htm#fr_899.md) *Jarāni*; mere matter
but for the informing life of the Goddess.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[147:5](htg22.htm#fr_900.md) The so-called
"senses" of knowledge (*Jnānendriya*), viz.: *Cakṣu* (eye), *Śrotra*
(ear), *ghrāṇa* (smell), *rasanā* (tongue), *tvak* (skin) and of action
(*karmendriya*); viz., *Vak* (speech), *pāni* (hand), *pāda* (feet),
*pāyu* (anus), *upastha* (genitals).

<span id="fn_895"></span>[147:6](htg22.htm#fr_901.md) *Indriyāni
guṇakarmayutāni*. Thus, form (*rūpa*) is the *guṇa* or object (*viṣaya*)
of the eye, and *darśana* (or seeing), its function (*karma*).

<span id="fn_896"></span>[147:7](htg22.htm#fr_902.md) The *Mantra* used in
*Agnikriyā* and wife of Agni.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[147:8](htg22.htm#fr_903.md) If the Mantra Svāhā,
which is the Devī, be not said, then the Devas get nothing from the
*homa*. Their Śastric portion they obtain by virtue only of the Devī as
*Svāhā*, the cause thereof.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[148:1](htg22.htm#fr_904.md) The Devī protects the
Devas, and if the Devas are maintained, then the whole world is
maintained, as the Devas are Her agents in the maintenance thereof.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[148:2](htg22.htm#fr_905.md) *Manujā*, which here,
according to Nīlakantha, includes Devas.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[148:3](htg22.htm#fr_906.md) The Demon Mahiṣa.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[148:4](htg22.htm#fr_907.md) *Gatingtava
yathārthatayā na jagmuh*.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[149:1](htg22.htm#fr_908.md) The hymn concluding,
Devībhāgavata continues, Vyāsa said: "Devī, thus praised, said in soft,
sweet voice, 'Oh, best of Devas, tell Me what other thing most difficult
and hard to accomplish you would have Me do?'"
