### GANGĀ <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1](#fn_1275.md)

### (GANGĀSTOTRA)

1

O Devī Sureśvarī! <span id="fr_1283"></span>[2](#fn_1276.md) O Bhagavatī
Gangā!  
Saviour of the three worlds of restless waves,  
Clear is Thy water circling upon the head of Śiva <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[3](#fn_1277.md),  
May my mind ever repose at Thy lotus feet.

2

Mother Bhāgīrathī! <span id="fr_1285"></span>[4](#fn_1278.md) giver of
happiness,  
Renowned in Nigama <span id="fr_1286"></span>[5](#fn_1279.md) is the
greatness of Thy water;  
Thy greatness is more than I can know,  
Protect me, O merciful one, ignorant that I am.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

3

O Gangā! sprung from the feet of Viṣṇu, <span
id="fr_1287"></span>[1](#fn_1280.md)  
Whose waves are white as snow as moon and pearl,  
Remove from me my weight of sin;  
Help me to cross the ocean of the world.

4

They say that him, O Gangā! who is devoted to Thee  
Yama <span id="fr_1288"></span>[2](#fn_1281.md) can never behold.  
He who has drunk of Thy clear water  
Attains of a surety the supreme Abode.

5

O Jāhnavī! O Gangā! deliverer of the fallen, <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[3](#fn_1282.md)  
Whose waves are beautiful,  
Claving the foremost of mountains, <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[4](#fn_1283.md)  
Mother of Bhīṣma, <span id="fr_1291"></span>[5](#fn_1284.md) daughter of
the foremost of *munis*. <span id="fr_1292"></span>[6](#fn_1285.md)  
Protectress of the fallen; praised in the three worlds. <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[7](#fn_1286.md)

6

O Gangā! who goeth to the ocean,  
Ever free of sadness is he who salutes Thee.

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

Giver of fruit like unto the *kalpa* tree, <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1](#fn_1287.md)  
By thy favour the woman who looked coldly  
Now casts her loving glances. <span id="fr_1295"></span>[2](#fn_1288.md)

7

He who bathes in Thy current, O Mother!  
Is never again reborn in woman's womb  
O Protectress from hell! O Jāhnavi! O Gangā!  
O Destructress of sins! lofty art Thou by Thy greatness.

8

O Thou who art eternal! O wave of purity!  
May Thou, bestower of bliss, refuge of Thy worshippers!  
From whose eyes come glances of compassion.  
Whose feet the lustre of gems on Indra's crown adorn,  
Be ever victorious!

9

O Bhāgīrathī! <span id="fr_1296"></span>[3](#fn_1289.md) dispel my illness,
melancholy, and pain,  
As also my sins and all my many follies;  
Essence of the three regions, necklace (on the breast) of Earth, <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[4](#fn_1290.md)  
Of a surety Thou art my refuge in the world.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

10

O Alakanandā! <span id="fr_1298"></span>[1](#fn_1291.md) O supreme
Bliss! <span id="fr_1299"></span>[2](#fn_1292.md)  
O worshipful by those who despair!  
Be Thou merciful.  
He whose abode is by Thy Banks  
Of a verity dwells in Vaikuṇṭha. <span id="fr_1300"></span>[3](#fn_1293.md)

11

Better were it to be a fish or tortoise in thy waters,  
Or a feeble lizard upon Thy banks, or a poor dog-eater <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[4](#fn_1294.md)  
Within two *kos* <span id="fr_1302"></span>[5](#fn_1295.md) of Thy
stream,  
Than to be a noble king and yet far away from Thee.

12

O Bhuvaneśvarī! <span id="fr_1303"></span>[6](#fn_1296.md) pure one,
praised of all,  
Devī in liquid form, <span id="fr_1304"></span>[7](#fn_1297.md) daughter of
the foremost of *Munis*, <span id="fr_1305"></span>[8](#fn_1298.md)  
He who daily reads this hymn to Gangā  
Is of a surety ever victorious.

13

They who with devotion in their heart to Gangā (Recite) this hymn  
Composed in the sweet, pleasant, charming *pajjhatika* metre,

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

Which gives the highest happiness,  
Gain the eternal bliss of liberation.

14

A worldly <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1](#fn_1299.md) man shall read <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[2](#fn_1300.md) this hymn to Gangā  
Which <span id="fr_1308"></span>[3](#fn_1301.md) is the essence of the
world, the giver of desired fruit,  
The essence of all pure things enjoined. <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[4](#fn_1302.md)  
Composed by Śankara, <span id="fr_1310"></span>[5](#fn_1303.md) the
worshipper of Śankara. <span id="fr_1311"></span>[6](#fn_1304.md)  
This hymn is ended.
