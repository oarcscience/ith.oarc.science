### AMBIKĀ <span id="fr_653"></span>[1](#fn_651.md)

### (ELEVENTH MĀHĀTMYA OF CAṆḌĪ) <span id="fr_654"></span>[2](#fn_652.md)

1

DEVĪ, Thou who removeth the pain of Thy suppliants, <span
id="fr_655"></span>[3](#fn_653.md)  
Be gracious, Be gracious, O Mother of the world!  
Be gracious, O Queen of the universe!  
Protect the universe.  
Thou art, O Devī! the Iśvarī of all moving and unmoving things. <span
id="fr_656"></span>[4](#fn_654.md)

2

Thou art the only support of the world,  
Because Thou wert in the form of earth.  
By Thee who existed in the form of water  
Is the whole universe pervaded.  
Thou art She whose powers are unsurpassed.

3

Thou art the Vaiṣṇavī Śakti <span id="fr_657"></span>[5](#fn_655.md) of
eternal power;

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

Thou art the seed of the universe,  
And the supreme Māyā.  
All this universe has been bewitched by Thee.  
Thou, when pleased, art the cause of salvation to men.

4

All sciences are parts of Thee,  
As also all women without exception <span
id="fr_658"></span>[1](#fn_656.md) throughout the world. <span
id="fr_659"></span>[2](#fn_657.md)  
By Thee alone, O Mother! is the universe filled.  
How can we praise Thee?  
Art thou not beyond all Praise of highest speech?

5

When, <span id="fr_660"></span>[3](#fn_658.md) O Devī! <span
id="fr_661"></span>[4](#fn_659.md) being in the form of the universe,  
And bestowing heaven <span id="fr_662"></span>[5](#fn_660.md) and
liberation, <span id="fr_663"></span>[6](#fn_661.md)  
Thou art worshipped,  
What words, howsoever sublime, suffice for Thy praise?

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

6

O Thou who existeth in the form of *buddhi* <span
id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_662.md)  
In the heart of all beings,  
Who art Giver of heaven and liberation  
O Devī Nārāyaṇi! <span id="fr_665"></span>[2](#fn_663.md) salutation to
Thee.

7

In the form of moments, minutes, and other fractions of time,  
Thou art the cause of (worldly) change.  
At the time of the dissolution of the universe  
Thou art all-powerful. <span id="fr_666"></span>[3](#fn_664.md)  
Nārāyaṇī all reverence to Thee.

8

O Auspicious One! auspicious with all auspiciousness,  
Accomplisher of all successful things,  
Giver of refuge, Three-eyed one; <span id="fr_667"></span>[4](#fn_665.md)  
O Gaurī! <span id="fr_668"></span>[5](#fn_666.md) O Nārāyaṇi! all reverence
to Thee.

9

O Eternal One! who art the energy <span
id="fr_669"></span>[6](#fn_667.md)  
Of creation, maintenance, and destruction;

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

Who art the abode of the qualities, <span
id="fr_670"></span>[1](#fn_668.md)  
And are yet beyond them-- <span id="fr_671"></span>[2](#fn_669.md)  
O Nārāyaṇi! all reverence to Thee.

10

O Thou who ever savest those in poverty and pain,  
Who take shelter with Thee!  
O Remover of the pains of all!  
Nārāyaṇi, all reverence to Thee.

11

Rider in an aerial car yoked with swans, <span
id="fr_672"></span>[3](#fn_670.md)  
Who assumed the form of Brāhmanī, <span
id="fr_673"></span>[4](#fn_671.md)  
Who sprinklest water in which *kuśa* grass <span
id="fr_674"></span>[5](#fn_672.md) is steeped <span
id="fr_675"></span>[6](#fn_673.md)--  
Nārāyaṇī, all reverence to Thee.

12

Who holdeth trident, moon, and serpent, <span
id="fr_676"></span>[7](#fn_674.md)  
Riding on a great bull <span id="fr_677"></span>[8](#fn_675.md)  
In the form of Maheśvarī <span id="fr_678"></span>[9](#fn_676.md)--

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

13

Who art attended by fowl and peacock. <span
id="fr_679"></span>[1](#fn_677.md)  
O faultless One!  
Who holdeth a great *śakti*-weapon, <span
id="fr_680"></span>[2](#fn_678.md)  
And existeth in the form of Kaumārī, <span
id="fr_681"></span>[3](#fn_679.md)--  
Nārāyaṇi, all reverence to Thee.

14

Who holdeth Thy great implements,  
Which are the conch, discus, mace, and bow;  
Who art in the form of Vaiṣṇavī, <span id="fr_682"></span>[4](#fn_680.md)  
Be gracious,  
Nārāyaṇi, all reverence to Thee.

15

Who holdeth the formidable discus,  
And hast uplifted the earth with Thy tusks <span
id="fr_683"></span>[5](#fn_681.md)--  
O auspicious One! in the form of a boar <span
id="fr_684"></span>[6](#fn_682.md)--  
Nārāyaṇi, all reverence to Thee.

16

O Thou who in the fierce man-lion form <span
id="fr_685"></span>[7](#fn_683.md)  
Didst put forth effort to slay the Daityas,

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

And who hast delivered the three worlds--  
Nārāyaṇī, all reverence to Thee.

17

Who weareth a diadem and beareth a great thunder-bolt,  
Who dazzles with Thy thousand eyes, <span
id="fr_686"></span>[1](#fn_684.md)  
Destructress of the life of Vritra, <span
id="fr_687"></span>[2](#fn_685.md)  
Who art Aindrī, <span id="fr_688"></span>[3](#fn_686.md)  
Nārāyaṇi, all reverence to Thee.

18

Who art in the form of Śivadūtī, <span id="fr_689"></span>[4](#fn_687.md)  
Destructress of the great host of the Daityas,  
Of terrible form and loud and terrible voice--  
Nārāyaṇi, all reverence to Thee.

19

Whose visage is formidable with its teeth,  
Adorned with a garland of severed heads--  
O Cāmuṇḍā! <span id="fr_690"></span>[5](#fn_688.md) is destructress of
Muṇḍa <span id="fr_691"></span>[6](#fn_689.md)--  
Nārāyaṇī, all reverence to Thee.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

20

Lakṣmī, modesty, great knowledge, <span
id="fr_692"></span>[1](#fn_690.md)  
Faith (in *śāstras*), nourishment, *svadhā*; <span
id="fr_693"></span>[2](#fn_691.md)  
Truth, permanent and unchangeable;  
Great night of dissolution, great nescience <span
id="fr_694"></span>[3](#fn_692.md)--  
Nārāyaṇī, all reverence to Thee.

21

Understanding, <span id="fr_695"></span>[4](#fn_693.md) Sarasvatī, the Best
of all.  
All Powers, <span id="fr_696"></span>[5](#fn_694.md) Spouse of
Babhru, <span id="fr_697"></span>[6](#fn_695.md) Dark One, <span
id="fr_698"></span>[7](#fn_696.md)  
Primeval Śakti. <span id="fr_699"></span>[8](#fn_697.md) Be gracious, O
Lady!  
Nārāyāṇī, all reverence to Thee.

22

Who art in the form of all things,

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

Controller of all; who hast all power;  
From the cause of all fear protect us, O Devī!  
O Devī Durgā! reverence to Thee.

23

Beautiful is Thy face adorned with three eyes.  
Guard us from all (formidable) beings.  
O Kātyāyani! <span id="fr_700"></span>[1](#fn_698.md)  
Reverence to Thee.

24

May Thy trident most formidable with flame,  
Slayer of countless Asuras,  
Protect us from fear,  
O Bhadrakāli! <span id="fr_701"></span>[2](#fn_699.md)  
Reverence to Thee.

25

May Thy bell which destroys the power of Daityas,  
Filling the world with its sound,  
Guard us from sin,  
As a mother <span id="fr_702"></span>[3](#fn_700.md) protects her children!

26

May Thy sword glittering in Thy hands,  
Besmeared with the blood and fat of Asuras as with mire,  
Be for our welfare!  
O Caṇḍikā; to Thee we bow.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

27

Thou, when gratified, dost destroy all forms of disease;  
But if displeased, Thou dost destroy all longed-for desires.  
Such as take shelter with Thee need fear no danger,  
Since they become verily a refuge to themselves. <span
id="fr_703"></span>[1](#fn_701.md)

28

O Mother, who hast shown Thyself in many forms,  
Who else than Thee is able to achieve  
That destruction of the great Asuras,  
Enemies of righteousness, <span id="fr_704"></span>[2](#fn_702.md)  
Which Thou hast wrought to-day.

29

In the sciences, <span id="fr_705"></span>[3](#fn_703.md) in all
scriptures, <span id="fr_706"></span>[4](#fn_704.md) and in the great
sayings <span id="fr_707"></span>[5](#fn_705.md)  
Which are the lamp of knowledge, <span id="fr_708"></span>[6](#fn_706.md)  
Who else is there but Thee  
Who makes this universe again and again <span
id="fr_709"></span>[7](#fn_707.md) revolve

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

In the pit <span id="fr_710"></span>[1](#fn_708.md) of delusion <span
id="fr_711"></span>[2](#fn_709.md) steeped in darkness.

30

Where there are Rākṣasas <span id="fr_712"></span>[3](#fn_710.md) and
greatly poisonous serpents;  
Where there are (armed) enemies;  
Where there are highway robbers;  
Where there is the forest and ocean <span
id="fr_713"></span>[4](#fn_711.md) fire,  
There abiding, <span id="fr_714"></span>[5](#fn_712.md) Thou dost guard the
universe.

31

Queen of the universe art Thou and its guardian;  
In the form of the universe Thou art its maintainer.  
By the Lords <span id="fr_715"></span>[6](#fn_713.md) of the universe art
Thou worshipped.  
They, its supporters, have great devotion to Thee. <span
id="fr_716"></span>[7](#fn_714.md)

32

O Devī! be gracious;  
Ever protect us from the fear of enemies  
As Thou hast just now saved us by the slaughter of the Asuras.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

Make cease at once the sins of the whole world  
And the great dangers which come of all portents. <span
id="fr_717"></span>[1](#fn_715.md)

33

O Devī! who takest away the afflictions of the universe.  
Be gracious to us who make obeisance to Thee.  
O Thou who art worthy of all praise,  
Grant boons to the dwellers in the three <span
id="fr_718"></span>[2](#fn_716.md) worlds. <span
id="fr_719"></span>[3](#fn_717.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_651"></span>[106:1](htg19.htm#fr_653.md) Mother.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[106:2](htg19.htm#fr_654.md) When the great Lord
of the Asuras was slain by the Devī, Indra and other Devas (Agni at
their head), with shining faces, offered praise to Kātyāyanī, because of
the fulfilment of their desire.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[106:3](htg19.htm#fr_655.md) Literally, "Those who
come to take shelter with Her."

<span id="fn_654"></span>[106:4](htg19.htm#fr_656.md) That is, the organic
and inorganic world.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[106:5](htg19.htm#fr_657.md) The energy of Viṣṇu,
the sustaining power of the Universe.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[107:1](htg19.htm#fr_658.md) *Sakalā*. Nagoji
Bhatta is not happy in his Commentary when he says that sakalā here
means "endowed with the sixty-four arts" (kalā), such as dancing, music,
painting, literature, acting, etc., and who are devoted to their
husbands, modest, etc. The Devī is not, according to this noble line, in
these only but in all women, however ignorant of the "arts" or low born
they may be.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[107:2](htg19.htm#fr_659.md)

*Vidyāh samastāstavadevi bhedāh.  
Striyah samastāh sakalā jagatsu*.

The Devibhāṣyam of Panchānana Tarkaratna translates the verse as, "All
sciences, all things (*bhedāh*), and all women are of Thee."

<span id="fn_658"></span>[107:3](htg19.htm#fr_660.md) The verse here
changes from *upendra vajrā* to *anustup* metre.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[107:4](htg19.htm#fr_661.md) That is, She who is,
as Nagoji says, of a shining nature (*dyotana\`sīlā*).

<span id="fn_660"></span>[107:5](htg19.htm#fr_662.md) *Svarga*.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[107:6](htg19.htm#fr_663.md) *Mukti*.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[108:1](htg19.htm#fr_664.md) That is,
nischayātmakam jnānam.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[108:2](htg19.htm#fr_665.md) For she is the
support of all beings; *fem*. of Nārāyana, a name of Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[108:3](htg19.htm#fr_666.md) For She is in the
form of time.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[108:4](htg19.htm#fr_667.md) As is Her Spouse Śiva
with his third eye of wisdom.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[108:5](htg19.htm#fr_668.md) Either as Nagoji says
"white Devī," or the Devī of that name, who issued from the body of
Mahādevī.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[108:6](htg19.htm#fr_669.md) The commentator says
"that She is the possessor of it" (*śakti*); but there is in reality no
difference between *śakti* and the possessor of *śakti*, though human
understanding and speech may make such difference.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[109:1](htg19.htm#fr_670.md) The *guṇas*--the
three *sattva*, *rajas*, and *tamas*, and their derivatives, the
*Tattwas*.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[109:2](htg19.htm#fr_671.md) Nagoji says that
*gunāśraye gunamaye* = *gunāśraye agunamaye*. Though the *gunas* inhere
in Her, She is not as is the *jīva*, affected by them.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[109:3](htg19.htm#fr_672.md) See next note.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[109:4](htg19.htm#fr_673.md) Śakti, or energy of
Brahmā whose vehicle (*vāhana*) is a swan (*hamsa*), or flamingo, as it
is variously rendered.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[109:5](htg19.htm#fr_674.md) Grass used in *pitṛ
kṛyā* and *agni kṛyā*.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[109:6](htg19.htm#fr_675.md) As Brahmā does with
the holy water (*śāntijalam*) from his pot called *kamaṇḍalu*.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[109:7](htg19.htm#fr_676.md) Associated with Śiva.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[109:8](htg19.htm#fr_677.md) The *vāhana* of Śiva.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[109:9](htg19.htm#fr_678.md) Śakti, or energy of
Maheśvara or Śiva.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[110:1](htg19.htm#fr_679.md) Both the cock and
peacock are said in the Mahābhārata to be the *vāhana* of Kārtikeya.
Gopal Chakravarti renders it, however, as "the best of peacocks."

<span id="fn_678"></span>[110:2](htg19.htm#fr_680.md) A kind of missile,
dart spear, lance, or pike.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[110:3](htg19.htm#fr_681.md) The Śakti of Kumāra,
or Kārtikeya, son of Śiva and Pārvatī and Commander of the celestial
hosts.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[110:4](htg19.htm#fr_682.md) The Śakti of Viṣṇu,
who holds the conch, discus (cakra), etc.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[110:5](htg19.htm#fr_683.md) See next note.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[110:6](htg19.htm#fr_684.md) Viṣṇu, in His
boar-incarnation, uplifted on His tusks the world which had been
submerged in the waters.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[110:7](htg19.htm#fr_685.md) As Śakti of Viṣṇu in
the *narasimha* incarnation, in which He slew the Daitya Hiranyakaśipu.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[111:1](htg19.htm#fr_686.md) The Devī is here
invoked as Aindri, the śakti of Indra, who is crowned, and whose weapon,
like that of Jupiter, is the thunderbolt and who has a thousand eyes.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[111:2](htg19.htm#fr_687.md) An Asura slain by
Indra.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[111:3](htg19.htm#fr_688.md) See note 1, *ante*.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[111:4](htg19.htm#fr_689.md) The Devī is known as
Śivadūtī, because Śiva was engaged by Her as messenger to Śumbha and
Niśumbha.

*yatoniyukto dautyena tayā devyā śivah svayam  
śivadūtīti lokesmingstatah sā khyutim āgatā*.

Caṇḍī, eighth Māhātmya.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[111:5](htg19.htm#fr_690.md) Devī is so called
because She slew the Asuras Canda and Muṇḍa (see verse 25, chap. vii.
Candī).

<span id="fn_689"></span>[111:6](htg19.htm#fr_691.md) *Muṇḍamathane*; not
as one translation of the Caṇḍī has it, "who grindest shaven heads."

<span id="fn_690"></span>[112:1](htg19.htm#fr_692.md) That is, as Nagoji
says, the knowledge pertaining to the *Ātman* (*adhyātmavidyā*)
contained in the Upaniṣads; not "wide knowledge," as last mentioned
translator renders it.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[112:2](htg19.htm#fr_693.md) *Mantra* of *Pitṛs*.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[112:3](htg19.htm#fr_694.md) For Devī is both
*vidyā* (knowledge) and *avidyā* (nescience), or *Prakṛti*.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[112:4](htg19.htm#fr_695.md) *Medhā*, which Nagoji
says = *dhāranāvati buddhi*, or firm, steady, concentrated *buddhi*.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[112:5](htg19.htm#fr_696.md) *Bhūti*, which
ordinarily means wealth = here, according to Gopal Chakravarti
*aiśvaryarūpinī*--that is, the eighth *siddhi*; or, according to Nagoji,
it is *sattvapradhāna* ("greatly excelling in *sattva guṇa*").

<span id="fn_695"></span>[112:6](htg19.htm#fr_697.md) A name of Śiva,
Viṣṇu, or Fire. According to Nagoji the *rajoguṇa śakti* is here
indicated.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[112:7](htg19.htm#fr_698.md) *Tāmasī*--that is,
*tamogunayuktā*.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[112:8](htg19.htm#fr_699.md) *Niyate*, which
ordinarily means fate (*adrisṭa*); but here denotes, according to
Nagoji, the *Mūlaśakti*, the root or primeval Śakti. It does not mean,
an stated in the last-mentioned translation, "O self-controlled Queen!".
In the case of the Devī there is no self to be controlled. She controls
others, not Herself.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[113:1](htg19.htm#fr_700.md) According to Gopal,
the Devī is so called because She was born in the hermitage of the
*Muni* Kātyāyana, but the Vedantists say that *Kātya* is he who is
devoted to the Brahman (*brahmaniṣṭa*), and She who is attained by them
is Kātyāyanī.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[113:2](htg19.htm#fr_701.md) Auspicious Kālī.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[113:3](htg19.htm#fr_702.md) *Anah*.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[114:1](htg19.htm#fr_703.md) As Gopal says, even
Rajahs, not to mention others, become the slaves of such an one.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[114:2](htg19.htm#fr_704.md) *Dharma*.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[114:3](htg19.htm#fr_705.md) There are fourteen
kinds of *vidyā*--viz., four Veda, six Anga, Mimāmsa, Nyāya,
Dharmaśāstra, Purāṇā. Gopal says *vidyā* and *upavidyā*, such as
Indrajāla, Gārudakadyāh, Dhanurvidyā, etc.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[114:4](htg19.htm#fr_706.md) *Śāstra*--that is,
*tarka* (logic), *nīti*. etc.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[114:5](htg19.htm#fr_707.md) Literally; the "first
sayings"--that is Veda or the Karmakāṇḍa.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[114:6](htg19.htm#fr_708.md) *Viveka* = *jnāna*
(Gopal).

<span id="fn_707"></span>[114:7](htg19.htm#fr_709.md) *Atīva*.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[115:1](htg19.htm#fr_710.md) The reference is to
the *samsāra*. It is a "pit," for men fall into it; and it is "dark,"
for it obstructs knowledge.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[115:2](htg19.htm#fr_711.md) *Mamatvam*, which
Gopal defines as *asvakīye svakiyatvābhimūnah*--the sense of ownness in
respect of a thing not one's own--*e.g.*, to take the body to be the
self; to think I am white, I am tall, etc

<span id="fn_710"></span>[115:3](htg19.htm#fr_712.md) Demonic beings.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[115:4](htg19.htm#fr_713.md) That is, the
submarine fire.
