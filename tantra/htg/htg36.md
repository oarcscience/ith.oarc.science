### GANGĀ

### (GANGĀSTOTRA) BY VĀLMĪKI <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1](#fn_1372.md)

1

O MOTHER GANGĀ! co-wife <span id="fr_1380"></span>[2](#fn_1373.md) with the
daughter of Himalaya,  
Thou art the necklace on the dress of the Earth, <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[3](#fn_1374.md)  
And the banner staff whereby one ascends to Heaven.  
O Bhāgīrathī! <span id="fr_1382"></span>[4](#fn_1375.md) I pray to Thee.  
May my body perish after it has lived on Thy banks,  
After it has drunk Thy pure water And swung on Thy waves.  
And has remembered Thy name and cast looks on Thee.

2

O Mother Gangā! O deliverer from Hell!

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

Even a bird living in the hollow of a tree growing on Thy bank,  
Even a fish or a tortoise living in Thy waters  
Are greater than a King worshipped by his enemies' wives,  
Made afraid by the sound of the bells on the necks of his maddened
elephants. <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1](#fn_1376.md)

3

Not even a bull or a bird or a horse,  
Nor a serpent nor an elephant,  
Suffer the pains of rebirth and redeath  
If they live at Kāśī <span id="fr_1384"></span>[2](#fn_1377.md) on Thy holy
banks.  
Better off are they than even a Raja living elsewhere,  
Fanned though he be with the *couris* <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[3](#fn_1378.md) of courtezans, <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[4](#fn_1379.md)  
Whose ever moving golden wristlets sweetly tinkle.

4

O our Supreme Lady Bhāgīrathī! <span id="fr_1387"></span>[5](#fn_1380.md)  
O wanderer in the three regions! <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[6](#fn_1381.md)  
When shall it be that I shall be fanned  
By the hands of heavenly women <span id="fr_1389"></span>[7](#fn_1382.md)
with their beautiful *couris*?  
When, too, shall I be happy enough to see my body  
Pecked by crows, devoured by dogs, drawn along the earth by jackals.

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

Carried by Thy currents, tossed upon Thy banks,  
And borne by Thy waters to and fro!

5

May the daughter of Jahnu <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1](#fn_1383.md) be
ever victorious and protect us,  
She who is like the fresh fibrous stem of the lotus-like feet of
Viṣṇu, <span id="fr_1391"></span>[2](#fn_1384.md)  
Like a garland of jasmine  <span id="fr_1392"></span>[3](#fn_1385.md)
flowers on the head of Śiva,  
Like the banner of victory of Lakṣmī presiding over liberation,  
She <span id="fr_1393"></span>[4](#fn_1386.md) who cleanses us of the stain
of sin arising from the Kaliyuga. <span
id="fr_1394"></span>[5](#fn_1387.md)

6

May Thy sacred water be pure for my daily bathing,  
Thy water covered with leaves of palm and *tamāla*, <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[6](#fn_1388.md)  
Of *Sāla* <span id="fr_1396"></span>[7](#fn_1389.md) and pine, with all
their creepers  
On which play no rays of the Sun. <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[7](#fn_1389.md)  
White and brilliant, like the conch, the Moon, and the water-lily,  
Stirred by the rising breasts of the wives of the Gandharvas,

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

Devas, Siddhas, and Kinnaras, <span id="fr_1398"></span>[1](#fn_1390.md)  
What time they bathe therein.

7

May the water of Gangā, who ever charms, sanctify us;  
She who has fallen from the feet of the enemy of Mura, <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[2](#fn_1391.md)  
Who wanders upon the head of the enemy of Tripurā, <span
id="fr_1400"></span>[3](#fn_1392.md)  
The Destructress of sins.

8

May the auspicious water of Gangā ever purify us;  
The Destructress of sins, the great enemy of sins,  
Adorned with waves, wandering in the mountains,  
Piercing through the caverns of the Lord of mountains <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[4](#fn_1393.md)  
With roaring sounds.  
Stealer of the dust from the feet of Lord Hari. <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[5](#fn_1394.md)

9

Whosoever at early dawn,  
Having cleansed his body  
And purified his mind

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

Of all uncleanliness arising from the sinful Kaliyuga, <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1](#fn_1395.md)  
Reads this hymn to Gangā composed of eight verses,  
Shall never fall into the ocean of the world again,  
But shall attain liberation.
