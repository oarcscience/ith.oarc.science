### WAVES OF BLISS

### (ĀNANDALAHARĪ)

1

O BHAVĀNĪ, <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1](#fn_1123) the four-headed Lord
of creatures, <span id="fr_1130"></span>[2](#fn_1124) is not able to
worship Thee,  
Nor even the five-headed destroyer of the Tripurā, <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[3](#fn_1125)  
Nor the six-headed commander of the celestial hosts, <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[4](#fn_1126)  
Nor even the thousand-headed Lord of serpents. <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[5](#fn_1127)  
If, then, they cannot, tell me who else is able so to do?

2

O Devī! how can we speak of Thy qualities,  
Which are not to be described by any *Nigama*, <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[6](#fn_1128)  
As the sweetness of ghee, <span id="fr_1135"></span>[7](#fn_1129)milk,
the grape, and honey

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

Cannot be distinguished and described by words,  
But may be perceived by the tongue only;  
In like manner Thy beauty can be seen only by the eyes of
Parameśvara. <span id="fr_1136"></span>[1](#fn_1130)

3

We ever pray to Thee, O Gaurī! <span id="fr_1137"></span>[2](#fn_1131)  
Youthful daughter of the Lord of mountains.  
Beautiful is the betel <span id="fr_1138"></span>[3](#fn_1132) in Thy
mouth  
And the collyrium on Thy eyes;  
Beautiful, too, are the saffron on Thy forehead,  
The necklet of pearls on Thy throat,  
Thy silken garment and the glittering gold waist-ornament on Thy large
hips. <span id="fr_1139"></span>[4](#fn_1133)

4

May Bhagavatī, <span id="fr_1140"></span>[5](#fn_1134) Satī, <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[6](#fn_1135) whose lotus eyes sparkle, <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[7](#fn_1136)  
Spouse of Śambhu, <span id="fr_1143"></span>[8](#fn_1137) on the slope
of whose breasts  
Rests a beautiful garland of the flowers of the Mandāra tree, <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[9](#fn_1138)  
Whose earring is the pleasing sound from the *vīnā*, <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[10](#fn_1139)

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

Who stoops (from the weight of her breasts), <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1](#fn_1140)  
Whose beautiful swaying gait is that of the female elephant <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[2](#fn_1141)--  
May that Bhagavatī be ever victorious!

5

O beauteous Aparṇā! <span id="fr_1148"></span>[3](#fn_1142)  
Bestow the fulness of happiness on me,  
Thou whose limbs art covered  
With ornaments of gold and gems glittering like the newly risen sun,  
Whose eyes are beautiful as those of a doe,  
Of whom Śiva is a part, <span id="fr_1149"></span>[4](#fn_1143)  
Who is of the golden colour of lightning,  
Beauteous in yellow garments and tinkling anklets.

6

Shines forth does the Devī born in the snowy mountains. <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[5](#fn_1144)

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

Her beautiful hands are like a red leaf. <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[1](#fn_1145)  
She is adorned with beautiful flowers and pearls.  
Her head, by its weight of hair, seems covered by a swarm of bees. <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[2](#fn_1146)  
It is She with whom Śiva seeks shelter,  
Who stoops from the weight of Her breasts, <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[3](#fn_1147)  
Whose words are sweet,  
The Destructress of ills, <span id="fr_1154"></span>[4](#fn_1148)  
Ever and in all places pervading, <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[5](#fn_1149)  
Tender creeper <span id="fr_1156"></span>[6](#fn_1150) of Intelligence
and Bliss. <span id="fr_1157"></span>[7](#fn_1151)

7

Others worship with reverence the plant with leaves and particular
qualities,  
But I know that Aparṇā alone in this world should be worshipped. <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[8](#fn_1152)  
Then the old Śiva garmented with space

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

Surely grants to Thy worshipper the fruit of full liberation. <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[1](#fn_1153)

8

Thou art the Mother of all Vedas,  
The regulator of all *dharmas* <span id="fr_1160"></span>[2](#fn_1154)  
And the root of all wealth--  
Thou whose lotus feet are worshipped even by the wealth-giver. <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[3](#fn_1155)  
O Mother! Thou art the primal cause of all desires.  
Victrix of Kandarpa, <span id="fr_1162"></span>[4](#fn_1156) Thou art
the seed of liberation for the good. <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[5](#fn_1157)  
Thou art the Spouse of the Parabrahman. <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[6](#fn_1158)

9

Although my mind be fickle and wanting in great devotion to Thee,  
Yet by Thy mercy Thou should look auspiciously upon me.  
The cloud gives sweet water to the mouth of the *Cātaka* <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[7](#fn_1159) bird.

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

I know not by what (good) fate my mind is directed. <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[1](#fn_1160)

10

O virtuous One, from the corner of Thine eyes  
Cast now a glance of kindness upon me;  
Neglect so to do is not proper on Thy part,  
Seeing that I have reached the refuge of Thy initiation.  
Alas! the creeper of desire, <span id="fr_1167"></span>[2](#fn_1161)
whose very name shows that it gives desire,  
Yet cannot give that which is desired,  
What difference is there between it and any other common creeper?

11

I, though I have sought refuge with other Devatās,  
Have yet placed full trust in Thy lotus feet.  
If, nevertheless, your heart is not timely set on me,  
Then with whom shall I in my helplessness seek shelter,  
O Mother of the big-bellied one! <span id="fr_1168"></span>[3](#fn_1162)

12

As iron touched by the touchstone becomes at once gold,

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

As the water of the roadway mixed with that of the Ganges becomes
pure,  
In like [manner](errata.htm#17) will not my heart,  
Greatly soiled though it be by my great sins <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1](#fn_1163)  
Become pure if attached with devotion to Thee?

13

O Īśānī, <span id="fr_1170"></span>[2](#fn_1164) as the old
Lotus-Born <span id="fr_1171"></span>[3](#fn_1165) and others have
said,  
The rule is that if others than Thyself art worshipped,  
Only the particular fruit desired is gained;  
But Thou giveth more even than is asked for.  
Make me, then, ever attached to Thee by day and night.

14

O Spouse of the great Lord of the three worlds! <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[4](#fn_1166)  
Most pleasant is Thy abode,  
The walls whereof glitter with various gems and crystals,  
Whereon Thy image is reflected.  
On the summit of Thy abode the quivering light waves of the moon (are
shed).  
Therein dwell Mukunda, <span id="fr_1173"></span>[5](#fn_1167) Brahmā,
and other Devas.  
It is ever victorious.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

15

Thy dwelling is in Mount Kailāsa. <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[1](#fn_1168)  
Thy worshippers are Brahmā, Indra, and other Devas.  
All are subservient to Thee in the three regions. <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[2](#fn_1169)  
The number of *siddhis* <span id="fr_1176"></span>[3](#fn_1170) join
their palms (in adoration before Thee.).  
Śiva is Thy lover;  
Therefore, O Daughter of the Lord of mountains <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[4](#fn_1171)  
Nothing is equal to Thy fortune.

16

The old bull is (Śiva's) carrier.  
Poison is his food; <span id="fr_1178"></span>[5](#fn_1172) space is his
dwelling;  
The cremation ground is his playground; <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[6](#fn_1173)  
Serpents are his ornaments.

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

All things in the world are known to the enemy of Smara; <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[1](#fn_1174)  
But the wealth of all this is due to the greatness of Thy fortune,  
O Mother!

17

The Lord of *Paśus*, <span id="fr_1181"></span>[2](#fn_1175) besmeared
with ashes, sits in the cremation ground.  
From his nature arises the force which destroys the world.  
Out of compassion for the whole world, He held the poison in his
throat. <span id="fr_1182"></span>[3](#fn_1176)  
O Kalyāṇi! <span id="fr_1183"></span>[4](#fn_1177) in all this I see the
fruit of his companionship with Thee.

18

O Daughter of the mountain, <span id="fr_1184"></span>[5](#fn_1178)  
When Gangā had seen Thy great beauty,  
She was afraid, <span id="fr_1185"></span>[6](#fn_1179) and turned to
water;  
Then Śiva, seeing her sad, lotus-like face,  
In his mercy made a dwelling for Her on his own head. <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[7](#fn_1180)

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

19

O Bhagavatī, <span id="fr_1187"></span>[1](#fn_1181) the Creator having
with his own hands taken Thy bathing water  
Mingled with liquid sandal, musk, saffron, and flowers,  
And the dust of Thy moving feet,  
Created therewith the lotus-eyed women of the city of the Devas. <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[2](#fn_1182)

20

If one but contemplates Thee, in play with Thy maidens,  
In pleasing springtide with its flowers and creepers  
Upon the lake, beautiful with many a blossoming lotus and flocks of
geese,  
The waters of which are rippled by the breeze from the Malaya
mountain, <span id="fr_1189"></span>[3](#fn_1183)  
From such an one all fevered ills <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[4](#fn_1184) pass away.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[180:1](htg29.htm#fr_1129) Bhava is Śiva, and
is His name in the watery form of the *aṣṭamūrti* (eight forms). The
Vāyu Purāṇa says that He is called Bhava because all things come from
Him and subsist in water. The Devī is Bhavānī as the Spouse and giver of
life to Bhava.

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[180:2](htg29.htm#fr_1130) Brahmā.

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[180:3](htg29.htm#fr_1131) Śiva.

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[180:4](htg29.htm#fr_1132) Kārtikeya, son of
Śiva.

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[180:5](htg29.htm#fr_1133) Ananta on whom
Viṣṇu reposes.

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[180:6](htg29.htm#fr_1134) Generally Śāstra
and in special technical sense Tantra in which the Devī is the Guru.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[180:7](htg29.htm#fr_1135) Clarified butter.

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[181:1](htg29.htm#fr_1136) The supreme Lord.

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[181:2](htg29.htm#fr_1137) See [p.
30](htg07.htm#page_30), note 3.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[181:3](htg29.htm#fr_1138) *Tāmbūla*, or pan,
which is chewed.

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[181:4](htg29.htm#fr_1139) *Prithukatitate*.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[181:5](htg29.htm#fr_1140) Feminine of
Bhagavān.

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[181:6](htg29.htm#fr_1141) Devī as daughter of
Dakṣa (see Introduction).

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[181:7](htg29.htm#fr_1142)
*Ambhoruhacatulacakṣu*. Literally, the lotus eye is ever moving, now
glancing here, now there. Motionless eyes in women are not considered
beautiful.

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[181:8](htg29.htm#fr_1143) Śiva.

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[181:9](htg29.htm#fr_1144) One of the five
heavenly trees in the garden and city (*Amarāvatī*) of Indra--viz.,
Mandāra, Pārijāta, Santāna, Kalpavrikṣa, Harichandana.

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[181:10](htg29.htm#fr_1145) The stringed
instrument of that name borne by the Devī as Sarasvatī.

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[182:1](htg29.htm#fr_1146) *Nātangī*. So also
the Annapurṇā dhyāna represents the Devī as giver of food "stooping from
the weight of Her great breasts" (*annapradāna niratāmstanabhāranamrām*,
and see verse 6 *post*).

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[182:2](htg29.htm#fr_1147) *Mātangīruciragati
bhangī bhagavatī*.

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[182:3](htg29.htm#fr_1148) Name of the Devī.
According to the Kālikā, and Brahmā Purāṇas the Devī, as the daughter of
Himavat, renounced even leaves as food (*a-parṇā* = without leaf); hence
she is called by Devas Aparṇā. According to another derivation, the name
comes from *apa* (removing), *rina* (debt). So Bhāskararāya, who gives
it, says in his *Devīstava*; "When you have not discharged your debt to
me, though I respect your name, O Śivé why are you not ashamed to bear
the name of Aparṇā?" (discharger of debt)? According to the Nirukta,
*parna* = falling. *Aparṇa* = free from falling.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[182:4](htg29.htm#fr_1149) That is, it is by
Her favour that Śiva forms part of Her.

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[182:5](htg29.htm#fr_1150)
*Himādrehsambhūtā*--that is, the Himālaya, hence She is also called
*Girijā* (mountain-born).

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[183:1](htg29.htm#fr_1151) Either from their
natural colour or because dyed with lac.

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[183:2](htg29.htm#fr_1152) The bee goes to the
lotus; the bees (her hair) settle upon her (lotus) face.

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[183:3](htg29.htm#fr_1153) *Kucābharanatā*
(see note 1, [p. 182](#page_182)).

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[183:4](htg29.htm#fr_1154) Disease
(*rujānghantrī*).

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[183:5](htg29.htm#fr_1155) Literally, one who
goes (*gantrī*).

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[183:6](htg29.htm#fr_1156) *Latikā*. Dim, of
*latā* creeper to which woman is compared, for she clings to her husband
as the creeper to the tree. Hence worship with woman in the Tāntrik
*Pancatattva* is called *latāsādhana*.

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[183:7](htg29.htm#fr_1157) *Cidānanda* which,
with *sat* (being), constitutes the nature of the Supreme Being
(Parabrahman).

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[183:8](htg29.htm#fr_1158) That is, some
worship a particular Devatā to gain a particular result--*e.g.*,
Sarasvatī for learning, Lakṣmī for wealth etc.; but Śankarācārya
worships the supreme Aparṇā, whom the Devas worship, who is without
qualities, and does so only to give Her honour.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[184:1](htg29.htm#fr_1159) Full *kaivalya
mokṣa*, liberation above the various *pāda*, *sālokya*, etc. (see [p.
59](htg11.htm#page_59), note 1), for *muktī* is of various kinds.

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[184:2](htg29.htm#fr_1160) Law of religion,
duty, etc.

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[184:3](htg29.htm#fr_1161) That is Kubera,
Deva of wealth.

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[184:4](htg29.htm#fr_1162) A name of Kāma, God
of Love (see [p. 40](htg08.htm#page_40), note 1) .

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[184:5](htg29.htm#fr_1163) *Satām*. She gives
liberation to them.

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[184:6](htg29.htm#fr_1164) The Supreme Being,
for it preceded Śakti, as *Śruti* says, "*Sa aikshata*," etc. As the
Śāradā Tilaka (chap. i.) says: "*Saccidānanda vibhavāt sakalat
parameshvarāt, āsīchchaktistītonādonādbindusadmudbhavah*.

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[184:7](htg29.htm#fr_1165) A bird (cuculus
melanolcucus) which is said to live on raindrops.

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[185:1](htg29.htm#fr_1166) That is, just as
the *cātaka* is given something, though it does not and cannot pray for
it, so what the writer of the hymn receives must, since his devotion
(*bhakti*) is so small and lacking in the force of prayer, be due to
some undisclosed merit acquired as the result of past *karma*.

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[185:2](htg29.htm#fr_1167) *Kalpalatikā*--that
is, a creeper which, like the kalpa tree, grants all desires that may be
asked of it.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[185:3](htg29.htm#fr_1168) Ganeśa.

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[186:1](htg29.htm#fr_1169) *Tattatpāpaih*.
Literally, "those particular sins"--the sins of the hymnist who knows
what they are.

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[186:2](htg29.htm#fr_1170) Feminine of Īśa
(Lord).

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[186:3](htg29.htm#fr_1171) Brahmā..

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[186:4](htg29.htm#fr_1172) See [p.
151](htg23.htm#page_151), note 7.

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[186:5](htg29.htm#fr_1173) Giver of
liberation--that is, Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[187:1](htg29.htm#fr_1174) See *Introduction
to Tantra Śāstra*.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[187:2](htg29.htm#fr_1175) See [p.
151](htg23.htm#page_151), note 7.

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[187:3](htg29.htm#fr_1176) Great powers, such
as *aṇimā*, *laghimā*, etc., the power of becoming extremely light or
heavy, of entering into things, etc., which, in their fulness,
constitute the *aiśvarya* of the Lord (Īśvara), and in a lesser degree
of those who approach His nature.

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[187:4](htg29.htm#fr_1177) Himālaya, for Devī
was the daughter of the Mountain-King Himavat.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[187:5](htg29.htm#fr_1178) See [p.
16](htg05.htm#page_16), note 2.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[187:6](htg29.htm#fr_1179) Dakṣa, in the
Bhāgavata Purāṇa, reproaching Śiva, says: "He roams about in dreadful
cemeteries, attended by hosts of ghosts and spirits, like a madman,
naked, with dishevelled hair, wearing a garland of dead men's skulls and
ornaments of human bone, pretending to be Śiva (auspicious), but in
reality Aśiva (inauspicious), insane, beloved by the insane, the Lord of
Bhūtas (ghosts and spirits), beings whose nature is essentially
darkness" (Muir, OṢṬ., iv. 738). The cremation ground is His abode, for
there the passions are burnt away.

<span id="fn_1174"></span>[188:1](htg29.htm#fr_1180) God of Love, whom
Śiva consumed.

<span id="fn_1175"></span>[188:2](htg29.htm#fr_1181) Paśupati: a name of
Śiva: as to *Paśu* (see *Introduction to Tantra Śāstra*). Here the
equivalent of Lord of men.

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[188:3](htg29.htm#fr_1182) See [p.
16](htg05.htm#page_16), note 2.

<span id="fn_1177"></span>[188:4](htg29.htm#fr_1183) Beneficent one.
According to the Padma Purāṇa Devī is worshipped as Kalyāṇī in the
Malaya mountain, to which reference is made in verse 20.

<span id="fn_1178"></span>[188:5](htg29.htm#fr_1184) See [p.
187](#page_187), note 4.

<span id="fn_1179"></span>[188:6](htg29.htm#fr_1185) *Bhītaivāsīt*, or
may be abashed.

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[188:7](htg29.htm#fr_1186) Jāhnavī, whence
Gangā is called Jāhnavī. When Gangā fell from Heaven, Śiva first held
Her in the locks of his hair, until Her anger at being called down by
Bhagīratha had abated. She then fell into the Bindu lake, whence issue
the seven sacred streams. One branch followed Bhagīratha wherever he
went, and on the way flooded the sacrificial flame of the *muni* Jāhnu.
In his anger he drank up its waters. Bhagīratha's work seemed to be
fruitless. But after intercession, the muni allowed the waters to flow
from him, and as so, issuing from him, the Ganges is called his daughter
Jāhnavī.

<span id="fn_1181"></span>[189:1](htg29.htm#fr_1187) See [p.
178](htg28.htm#page_178), note 7.

<span id="fn_1182"></span>[189:2](htg29.htm#fr_1188) *Amarāvatī*, the
city of Indra.

<span id="fn_1183"></span>[189:3](htg29.htm#fr_1189) See note to verse
17.

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[189:4](htg29.htm#fr_1190) Literally,
fever-produced disease (*jvarajanitapīdāpasarati*).
