### "MAY THE DEVI GRANT ME PARDON"

### (DEVI APARĀDA KṢAMĀPANA STOTRA)

1

ALAS! I know not either Thy mantra <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[1](#fn_1214) or yantra, <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[2](#fn_1215)  
Nor how to welcome Thee, <span id="fr_1222"></span>[3](#fn_1216)  
Or how to meditate upon, nor words of prayer to Thee,  
Nor do I know Thy *mudrā*, <span id="fr_1223"></span>[4](#fn_1217)

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

Or how to lay before Thee my griefs;  
But this I know, O Mother!  
That to follow Thee is to remove all my pain.

2

By my ignorance of Thy commands.  
By my poverty <span id="fr_1224"></span>[1](#fn_1218) and sloth,  
I had not the power to do that which I should have done,  
Hence my omission to worship Thy feet.  
But, O Mother! auspicious Deliverer of all.  
All this should be forgiven,  
For a bad son may sometimes be born, but a bad mother never. <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[2](#fn_1219)

3

O Mother! Thou hast many worthy sons on earth,  
But I, your son, am of no worth;  
Yet it is not meet that Thou should’st abandon me,  
For a bad son may sometimes be born, but a bad mother never.

4

O Mother of the world, O Mother!  
I have not worshipped Thy feet,  
Nor have I given abundant wealth to Thee;  
Yet the affection which Thou bestoweth on me is without compare,  
For a bad son may sometimes be born, but a bad mother never.

5

I have abandoned the worship of other Devas

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

Because of the variety and confusion of the injunctions relating to
their worship.  
I am no more than eighty-five years of age, <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[1](#fn_1220)  
If Thou will not bestow Thy kindness on me,  
What shelter have I without Thy support,  
O Mother of the big-bellied Deva! <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[2](#fn_1221)

6

Prayer, sweet as the sweet melon  
Makes even a dog-eater <span id="fr_1228"></span>[3](#fn_1222)
perfect;  
Even a beggar walks without fear  
With crores <span id="fr_1229"></span>[4](#fn_1223) of gold pieces.  
O Aparṇā! <span id="fr_1230"></span>[5](#fn_1224) this is the fruit of
Thy *mantra* entering their ears.  
Who can say, O Mother!  
The fruit which is born of the recitation <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[6](#fn_1225) of Thy *mantra*?

7

He who is besmeared with the ashes of the funeral pyre, <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[7](#fn_1226)  
He who swallowed poison, <span id="fr_1233"></span>[8](#fn_1227)

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

Who is clothed with space, <span id="fr_1234"></span>[1](#fn_1228)  
With matted hair, garlanded with the Lord of Serpents,  
The Lord of men, <span id="fr_1235"></span>[2](#fn_1229)  
The Lord of Ghosts <span id="fr_1236"></span>[3](#fn_1230) holding a
skull in His hands.  
Owes his great states as Lord of the World  
To his acceptance of Thee as His Spouse, O Bhavānī! <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[4](#fn_1231)

8

No desire have I for liberation, Nor have I desire for wealth, Nor wish
for knowledge,  
O Moon-faced One! neither have I wish for happiness!  
But this only I beg of Thee,  
That my life may pass in the recitation of these words:  
Mridānī, <span id="fr_1238"></span>[5](#fn_1232) Rudrāṇī, <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[6](#fn_1233) Śiva, Śivé, Bhavānī. <span
id="fr_1240"></span>[4](#fn_1231)

9

I have not according to the injunctions laid down therefor

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

Worshipped Thee with the various articles <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[1](#fn_1234) of worship.  
What is there which I have not wrongly done or omitted in my meditations
on the Brahman?  
O Dark One! <span id="fr_1242"></span>[2](#fn_1235) it will be but
fitting on Thy part  
If Thou bestoweth not kindness on me, helpless though I am.

10

O Durgā, <span id="fr_1243"></span>[3](#fn_1236) our Lady! O Ocean of
mercy!  
When overwhelmed by danger <span id="fr_1244"></span>[4](#fn_1237) I
remember Thee.  
Think not, however, this to be deceit on my part,  
For children afflicted by hunger and thirst ever remember their mother.

11

O Mother of the world! <span id="fr_1245"></span>[5](#fn_1238)

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

It is nothing wonderful if Thou art full of compassion for me;  
A mother does not abandon her son  
Even if he have an hundred faults.

12

There is no such great sinner like me,  
There is no such destroyer of sin as Thou.  
Now, Mahādevī, you have heard what I have to say,  
It remains for Thee to do what may seem fitting to Thee.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1214"></span>[195:1](htg31.htm#fr_1220) *Śabda* is Brahman,
and *mantra* the manifestation thereof. From *manana* arises realization
of the monistic truth. *Man* of *mantra* comes from the first syllable
of *manana*, and *tra* from *trāna*, or liberation from the bondage of
the *samsāra*. That is called *mantra* which calls forth (*āmantrana*)
the *caturvarga*, and which is the *svarūpa* of Devatā. (See
*Introduction to Tantra Śāstra* and the Chapter on Mantra Tattva in
*Principles of Tantra*.)

<span id="fn_1215"></span>[195:2](htg31.htm#fr_1221) *Ibid*., The
Tāntrik diagram which is worshipped in lieu of the image (*pratimā*).
The Gāyatrī *Yantra* is [figured on the cover of this
work](htg00.htm#img_yantra). *Mantra* is *Devatā*, and *yantra* is
mantra, in that it is the body of the *Devatā*, who is *mantra*.

*Yantram mantramayam proktam mantrātmā devataivahi  
Dehātmanoryathā bhedo yantradevatayostathā* (Kaulavalīya Tantra).

"The substance of *yantra* is *mantra*. *Devatā* is *mantra*. As there
is a distinction between body and *ātmā*, so there is between *yantra*
and *Devatā*."

<span id="fn_1216"></span>[195:3](htg31.htm#fr_1222) By the *āvāhana
mantra*, always said in worship of the *pratimā*.

<span id="fn_1217"></span>[195:4](htg31.htm#fr_1223) Ritual gesture, it
being said; *Devānām modadā mudrā tasmāttām yatnātścaret* (see
*Introduction to Tantra Śāstra*)"--"*Mudrā* is giver of pleasure to
Devas, therefore it should be done with care."

<span id="fn_1218"></span>[196:1](htg31.htm#fr_1224) Want of means to
perform the proper worship.

<span id="fn_1219"></span>[196:2](htg31.htm#fr_1225) A celebrated line;

<span id="fn_1220"></span>[197:1](htg31.htm#fr_1226) How is this stated
if the hymn be the work of Śankarācārya, to whom it is attributed, for

The Deva is the elephant-headed Ganeśa.

<span id="fn_1222"></span>[197:3](htg31.htm#fr_1228) That is, a low

182](htg29.htm#page_182), note 3.

<span id="fn_1225"></span>[197:6](htg31.htm#fr_1231) That is, *japa*,
which is only recitation (in English) in its lowest form, the highest
form being mental (*mānasa*) only. *Japa*, which is defined as
*vidhānenā mantroccaraṇam*, is either *vācaka*, *upāmshu*, or *mānasā*
(see Tantrasāra, 75 *et seq*.).

<span id="fn_1226"></span>[197:7](htg31.htm#fr_1232) Śiva, to whom the
rest of the attributes in this verse refer.

<span id="fn_1227"></span>[197:8](htg31.htm#fr_1233) See [p.

naked, as the Yogins, of whom He is the Master, ever are.

<span id="fn_1229"></span>[198:2](htg31.htm#fr_1235) *Paśupati*. *Paśu*

<span id="fn_1230"></span>[198:3](htg31.htm#fr_1236) *Bhūteśa*, Śiva is
surrounded by hosts of spirits.

<span id="fn_1231"></span>[198:4](htg31.htm#fr_1240) See p. 180, note 1.

<span id="fn_1232"></span>[198:5](htg31.htm#fr_1238) Mrida is a title of
the *sāttvika* Śiva. She is His Spouse.

<span id="fn_1233"></span>[198:6](htg31.htm#fr_1239) Devī is the Spouse
of the countless Śivas called Rudras, in whom the *tamoguna* prevails.
The dark (*tamas*) energy, called Raudrī, is said to be Cāmuṇḍā.

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[199:1](htg31.htm#fr_1241) *Upacāra*. There
are sixteen such, called the *shoḍaśa pūjā upacāra*--viz., (1) *āsanam*

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[199:3](htg31.htm#fr_1243) A great name of the
Devī. The Devī Purāṇa says that She is so called because the Devas were
delivered from fear in difficulty and battle; hence She is deliverer
(Durgā). The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa and the Lakṣmī Tantra in the Pancarātra
says: "In this place I shall kill a great Daitya (Titan) named Durgama.
Hence my name shall be Durgā."

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[199:4](htg31.htm#fr_1244) The Mārkaṇḍeya
Purāṇa says: When Thou art remembered in times of difficulty, Thou
takest away all fear of all things."
