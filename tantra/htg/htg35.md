Thou who maketh Thy dwelling in the cave of Mount Kailāsa, <span

Who giveth us power to understand the meaning of *Nigama*, <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[6](#fn_1352)

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

Thou art the letters of the bīja <span id="fr_1360"></span>[1](#fn_1353)
Om <span id="fr_1361"></span>[2](#fn_1354),  
Opener of the panels of the door of liberation, <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[3](#fn_1355)  
Presiding Devī over the City of Kāśī,  
O vessel of mercy, grant me aid!

5

Thou supporteth all beings visible and invisible,

Thou discloseth the subject of the drama of Thy own play,  
And art the fount of the light of wisdom,  
Pleasing the mind of the Lord of the universe,  
Presiding Devī over the City of Kāśī,  
O vessel of mercy, grant me aid!

6

Īśvarī of all men on earth,  
The waves of Thy blue-black hair look (beautiful) like plaits.  
Īśvarī who ever giveth food,  
Bestower of happiness to all, who advanceth all people,

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

Presiding Devī over the City of Kāśī,  
O vessel of mercy, grant me aid!

7

Thou givest all instruction onwards from the time of initiation, <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1](#fn_1357)  
And art the cause of the threefold manifestation of Śambhu. <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[2](#fn_1358)  
Scented with the Kashmir aloe, Thou art the Īśvarī of the three
regions. <span id="fr_1366"></span>[3](#fn_1359)

And the night of dissolution.  
Thou art the cause of all [lasting](errata.htm#20) things,  
And fulfiller of the desires of those who desire.

Daughter of Dakṣa, <span id="fr_1368"></span>[5](#fn_1361)

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

Beautiful, pleasing the world  
With the sweet milk of Thy left breast. <span

For Thou givest welfare,  
And fulfillest the desires of your devotees.  
Presiding Devī over the City of Benares,

9

Thou art She who shinest with the brilliance of millions of suns, moons,
and fires.  
Whose earrings are brilliant as the sun, moon, and fire,  
Who art the cause of the colour of both sun and moon,  
Who holdeth a rosary, <span id="fr_1370"></span>[2](#fn_1363) a
book, <span id="fr_1371"></span>[3](#fn_1364) a noose, and a goad. <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[4](#fn_1365)  
Presiding Devī over the City of Benares,  
O vessel of mercy, grant me aid!

10

Protectress of Kṣatriyas, <span id="fr_1373"></span>[5](#fn_1366)  
Great dispeller of all fear,  
Mother, who art an ocean of mercy,  
In very truth the ever auspicious giver of salvation,  
The cause of the beauty of Viśveśvara, <span

<span id="fn_1342"></span>[218:3](htg35.htm#fr_1349) Union of the human
(*jivātmā*) with the supreme (*paramātmā*) soul effected through the
practice of *Yoga*.

<span id="fn_1343"></span>[218:4](htg35.htm#fr_1350) That is, sin.

<span id="fn_1344"></span>[218:5](htg35.htm#fr_1351) Two of the fourfold
aims (*Caturvarga*) of sentient being--viz., *dharma* (religion, duty,
etc.), *artha* (wealth, wherewith life is sustained and religious

achievements and fulfilment), and *mokṣa* or liberation.

<span id="fn_1345"></span>[218:6](htg35.htm#fr_1352) That is, *Bhuh*,
*Bhuvah*, *Svah*, the terrestrial atmospheric and the heavenly spheres.

<span id="fn_1346"></span>[218:7](htg35.htm#fr_1353) *Aiśvarya*

<span id="fn_1347"></span>[219:1](htg35.htm#fr_1354) The sacred mount
and paradise of Śiva; esoterically the Sahasrāra whereto as Kuṇḍalinī
She repairs.

<span id="fn_1348"></span>[219:2](htg35.htm#fr_1355) The daughter of
Guru, the King of mountains (see [p. 187](htg29.htm#page_187), note 4).
Gaurī also means "fair".

<span id="fn_1349"></span>[219:3](htg35.htm#fr_1356) A name of the Devī.
When of the age of sixteen she practised great austerities that She
might be the Spouse of Śiva, upon which Her mother, endeavouring to
persuade Her, said, U ("Oh"), Mā ("not"). As it is said by Kālidāsa in
the first Canto of the Kumārasambhavam; "*Umeti mātrā tapaso niṣiddhā
paschā dumākhyāng sumukhijagāma*." ("By the words U, Mā, She was thus
forbidden by Her mother to practise austerity, thereafter the pure Umā
obtained Her name.") Umā is Kumārī, who has renounced all attachment,
and is devoted to Her Lord. A *sūtra* runs, "I*cchāśaktih Umā kumārī*"
(The energy of will is Umā the unmarried). The Commentary on this
*sūtra*, cited by Bhāskararāya, says: "The eternal state is his whose
mind has ascended the degrees of *yoga* called *vismaya*, and who
realizes the supreme Bhairavata (an aspect of Śiva). That *Yogi* obtains
at length the *Icchāśakti* called the Supreme Queen (*Parābhattārika*)
known also as Kumārī."

<span id="fn_1350"></span>[219:4](htg35.htm#fr_1357) Name of the Devī as
Spouse of Śankara, the benefactor.

<span id="fn_1351"></span>[219:5](htg35.htm#fr_1358) Name of the Devī as
one of the *aṣtanāyikā* and Spouse of Deva Kārtikeya.

<span id="fn_1352"></span>[219:6](htg35.htm#fr_1359) This term, applied
to the Veda generally, means particularly the Tantra in the form in
which the Devī is *guru* and Śiva, *śiṣya*. As it is said:

*Nirgato girijā vaktrāt,  
Gatāscha girija śrutim,  
Matascha vāsudevasya,  
Nigamā parikathyate*.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the Lalitā the
Devī is addressed as *nijājnarūpā nigamā* (the nigama are the
expressions of Thy commands).

<span id="fn_1353"></span>[220:1](htg35.htm#fr_1360) The Tāntrik
("seed") *mantras*, such as *Hrīm*, *Hūm*, *Klīm*, etc. Mantras are
classified according to the syllables they contain.

<span id="fn_1354"></span>[220:2](htg35.htm#fr_1361) The Mahāmantra
*Om*, composed of A + u + m, coalesced by *sandhi* into Om. The three
*varṇas* signify the three members of the *Trimurti*, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and
Śiva, who, as the Rudrayāmala says, are born of the *Praṇava* (Om), and
though in appearance three, are yet one (*ekamūrtistrayo devāh*). From
the *Praṇava* all Devas, Vedas, sun, moon, and all being comes by the
power of Devī, the supreme Śakti.

<span id="fn_1355"></span>[220:3](htg35.htm#fr_1362) *Mokṣā*, or unity
with the supreme, and therefore liberation from rebirth in the
phenomenal world.

<span id="fn_1356"></span>[220:4](htg35.htm#fr_1363)
*Brahmāṇḍabhāṇḍodari*. The *Brahimāṇḍa* (universe) is the "mundane egg"
of Brahmā.

<span id="fn_1357"></span>[221:1](htg35.htm#fr_1364) *Dīkṣā*, through
which each Hindu passes, by reception of his *mantra*. It is said
sometimes that initiation is the third birth, the first being that from
the mother, the second is *upanayana* (investiture with sacred thread),
and the third is initiation. The Tantras speak of thirty-two *Dīkṣās*,
from *Sudhavidyā* to *Anuttara*.

<span id="fn_1358"></span>[221:2](htg35.htm#fr_1365) That is, as
creator, maintainer, and destroyer.

<span id="fn_1359"></span>[221:3](htg35.htm#fr_1366) Bhuh, Bhuvah, Svah
(see [p. 151](htg23.htm#page_151), note 7)

<span id="fn_1360"></span>[221:4](htg35.htm#fr_1367) For She flows in
the form of the three sacred rivers: Gangā, Yamunā, and Sarasvatī.

<span id="fn_1361"></span>[221:5](htg35.htm#fr_1368) The father of Satī,
a manifestation of Devī, who, dying at the *Dakṣayajna* reappeared as
Pārvatī.

<span id="fn_1362"></span>[222:1](htg35.htm#fr_1369) Because Ganeśa and
Kārtikeya, Her children, suck Her right breast.

<span id="fn_1363"></span>[222:2](htg35.htm#fr_1370) *Mālā*.

<span id="fn_1364"></span>[222:3](htg35.htm#fr_1371) *Pustaka*, which is
also known as the *Vidyāmudrā*.

<span id="fn_1365"></span>[222:4](htg35.htm#fr_1372) See [p.
173](htg27.htm#page_173), note 6.

<span id="fn_1366"></span>[222:5](htg35.htm#fr_1373) The warrior caste.

<span id="fn_1367"></span>[222:6](htg35.htm#fr_1374) Lord of the
universe.

<span id="fn_1368"></span>[223:1](htg35.htm#fr_1375) When his *yajna*
was destroyed by Her husband Śiva. There are two Dakṣas--Prajāpati, and
a human king, an incarnation of the former. Though Śiva destroyed the
sacrifice, Devī was the instrument. The Lalitā, verse 120, addresses the
Devī both as *Dākṣāyanī* (daughter of Dakṣa) and *Dakṣayajna vināsinī*
(destroyer of the sacrifice of Dakṣa).

<span id="fn_1369"></span>[223:2](htg35.htm#fr_1376) Śiva.

<span id="fn_1370"></span>[223:3](htg35.htm#fr_1377) *Ibid*.

<span id="fn_1371"></span>[223:4](htg35.htm#fr_1378) See [p.
151](htg23.htm#page_151), note 7.
