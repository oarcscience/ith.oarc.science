### NARMADĀ

### (NARMADĀSṬAKASTOTRAM)

1

O DEVĪ NARMADĀ! <span id="fr_1312"></span>[1](#fn_1305.md) I salute thy
lotus-like feet,  
Beauteous with the breakers of the heaving waves of ocean,  
With which the drops of Thy waters mingle. <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[2](#fn_1306.md)  
O giver of prosperity! I salute Thy feet bathed in water,  
Which destroys rebirth, the cause of which is sin, <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[3](#fn_1307.md)  
As also all fear at the coming of the messenger of death. <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[4](#fn_1308.md)  
*Tvadīya pāda pankajam namāmi devi narmadé*. <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[5](#fn_1309.md)

O Devī Narmadā! I salute Thy lotus feet  
Giver of celestial (blessing) to the lowly fish in Thy waters,  
Foremost of all sacred rivers. <span id="fr_1317"></span>[6](#fn_1310.md)

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

Destructress of the heavy weight of sin of the Kaliyuga, <span

Giver of welfare to multitude of fine fish, tortoise, alligators, and
ruddy geese. <span id="fr_1319"></span>[2](#fn_1312.md)  
*Tvadīya pāda pankajam namāmi devi narmadé*.

O Devī Narmadā! I salute Thy lotus-like feet.  
The overflow from Thy depths washes away the sins of the world.  
Thou destroyest all great sins and the mountain <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[3](#fn_1313.md) of calamities.  
O giver of happiness to the son of Mṛkaṇḍu, <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[4](#fn_1314.md)  
At the fearful moment of the world's dissolution.  
*Tvadīya pāda pankajam namāmi devi narmadé*.

4

O Devī Narmadā! I salute Thy lotus-like feet,  
And Thy waters worshipped by the son of Mṛkaṇḍu, Śaunaka, and other
enemies of the Asuras.

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

Destructress of rebirth in the ocean of the world, <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[1](#fn_1315.md)  
[Protectress](errata.htm#19.md) from all worldly pains, <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[2](#fn_1316.md)  
*Tvadīya pāda pankajam namāmi devi narmadé*.

5

O Devī Narmadā! I salute thy lotus-like feet,  
Worshipped by countless lakhs <span id="fr_1324"></span>[3](#fn_1317.md) of
immortals, <span id="fr_1325"></span>[4](#fn_1318.md)  
Asuras, <span id="fr_1326"></span>[5](#fn_1319.md) Kinnaras, <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[6](#fn_1320.md) and others,  
Whose banks resound with the fearless song of many lakhs of birds. <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[7](#fn_1321.md)  
Giver of happiness to Vaśiṣṭha, Pipala, Karddama, <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[8](#fn_1322.md) and other sages, <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[9](#fn_1323.md)  
*Tvadīya pāda pankajam namāmi devi narmadé*.

6

O Devī Narmadā! I salute Thy lotus-like feet,  
Held in the minds of the bees, <span id="fr_1331"></span>[10](#fn_1324.md)
Sanatkumāra, Nacīketa, <span id="fr_1332"></span>[11](#fn_1325.md) Kaśyapa,

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

And by the bees, Atri, Nārada and other sages.  
Thou who blesseth the work of sun, moon, Rantideva, and Devarāja, <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[1](#fn_1326.md)  
*Tvadīya pāda pankajam namāmi devi narmadé*.

7

O Devī Narmadā; I salute Thy lotus-like feet,  
Weapon against lakhs of sins known and unknown,  
The Giver of enjoyment and liberation to all beings and animals, <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[2](#fn_1327.md)  
And of happiness to the abode of Virinci, <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[3](#fn_1328.md) Viṣṇu, and Śiva,  
*Tvadīya pāda pankajam namāmi devi narmadé*.

8

O Devī, Narmadā,! I salute Thy lotus feet.  
How sweet is the sound heard on the banks of Her who has sprung from the
hair of Śiva <span id="fr_1336"></span>[4](#fn_1329.md).  
Destroyer of pain and sin of hunter, and singer <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[5](#fn_1330.md) of the learned and the fool,  
And of the heat of the submarine fire, <span
id="fr_1338"></span>[6](#fn_1331.md)

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

Giver of happiness to all being.  
*Tvadīya pāda pankajam namāmi devi narmadé*.

9

Who ever reads but thrice daily this hymn to Narmadā  
Will never fall into misfortune, He will never see Raurava, <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[1](#fn_1332.md)  
He will never be reborn,  
But will reach the glorious abode of Śiva,  
So difficult to attain, by this body so easily gained. <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[2](#fn_1333.md)

rivers of India, and a form of the Devī.

<span id="fn_1306"></span>[212:2](htg34.htm#fr_1313.md) The ocean is the
husband of all rivers.

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[212:3](htg34.htm#fr_1314.md) Rebirth is caused
by karma.

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[212:4](htg34.htm#fr_1315.md) When a man is about

<span id="fn_1310"></span>[212:6](htg34.htm#fr_1317.md) The is *stuti*
(praise). In all sanskrit works the particular Devatā who is the subject
of hymn, meditation or prayer is spoken <span id="page_213">p.
213</span> of as the greatest of all. *Tīrtha* is not only a place of
pilgrimage such as a shrine and the like, but also, according to the
Amarakośa, a sacred river.

<span id="fn_1311"></span>[213:1](htg34.htm#fr_1318.md) The present or
fourth age, marked by the predominance of sin, each of the preceding
eras (Dvāpara, Tretā, Satya) being more virtuous than the other. In the
Kaliyuga era time works evilly.

<span id="fn_1312"></span>[213:2](htg34.htm#fr_1319.md) The *cakravāka*
bird (by some said to be the Brahmini duck) celebrated in sanskrit
poetry for its devotion to its mate. During the night-time the male and
female birds call to each other from opposite banks of the stream, as I
have heard them do on the reaches of the lonely Malia River in Northern
Orissa.

<span id="fn_1313"></span>[213:3](htg34.htm#fr_1320.md) *Dāritāpadacalam*.

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[213:4](htg34.htm#fr_1321.md) The *Mahāmuni*
Mārkaṇḍeya.

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[214:1](htg34.htm#fr_1322.md) The edition used
has *punarbhavābdhi janmajam*, but this seems meaningless, and it is
read as *janmaghnam*.

<span id="fn_1316"></span>[214:2](htg34.htm#fr_1323.md) *Bhavābdhi dukhha
barmadé*. Literally, "armour given to the pain of the world."

<span id="fn_1317"></span>[214:3](htg34.htm#fr_1324.md) A lakh is 100,000.

<span id="fn_1318"></span>[214:4](htg34.htm#fr_1325.md) *Amara*--*i.e.*,
Devas.

<span id="fn_1319"></span>[214:5](htg34.htm#fr_1326.md) Demonic spirits,
opponents of the Devas or Suras.

<span id="fn_1320"></span>[214:6](htg34.htm#fr_1327.md) A class of spirits
(*Devayoni*).

<span id="fn_1321"></span>[214:7](htg34.htm#fr_1328.md) *Dhīra*--that is
because they are undisturbed by men who have become enemies to their
brother creation.

<span id="fn_1322"></span>[214:8](htg34.htm#fr_1329.md) Ṛṣis and munis of
that name.

<span id="fn_1323"></span>[214:9](htg34.htm#fr_1330.md) *Śiṣṭa*, which
means a gentle and learned man who governs himself by his own wisdom,
and is not governed by external restraints.

<span id="fn_1324"></span>[214:10](htg34.htm#fr_1331.md) The bee hovers on
the lotus seeking honey. The sages gather round the feet of the Devī
seeking the wisdom of which She is the embodiment.

<span id="fn_1325"></span>[214:11](htg34.htm#fr_1332.md) *Munis* and
*ṛṣis*.

<span id="fn_1326"></span>[215:1](htg34.htm#fr_1333.md) Indra.

<span id="fn_1327"></span>[215:2](htg34.htm#fr_1334.md) Both enjoyment and
liberation is given to men: to animals enjoyment (*bhukti*), though
they, too, by merit acquired in present birth may attain future birth in
human form.

<span id="fn_1328"></span>[215:3](htg34.htm#fr_1335.md) Brahmā.

<span id="fn_1329"></span>[215:4](htg34.htm#fr_1336.md) *Maheśakeśajātate*.
As to Gangā, see [p. 188](htg29.htm#page_188.md), note 7. It is the same
and only Devī who manifests both as Gangā and Narmadā, and all other
rivers and things.

<span id="fn_1330"></span>[215:5](htg34.htm#fr_1337.md) Hunting is sinful.
The singers are a mixed caste.

<span id="fn_1331"></span>[215:6](htg34.htm#fr_1338.md) *Kirātasūtavādaveṣu
pandita śathe*. When the *Dakṣayajna* was destroyed by Śiva, it changed
into a mare (*Vadavā*). Śiva followed, and it plunged into ocean. Fire
is produced by it. The *Śloka* says that Her water is so great and pure
that it is unaffected by this fire. As regards the rest of this somewhat
obscure verse, it means that the Devī is the remover of the sin of all
whoever they may be.

<span id="fn_1332"></span>[216:1](htg34.htm#fr_1339.md) One of the great
hells.

<span id="fn_1333"></span>[216:2](htg34.htm#fr_1340.md) *Sulabhya
dehadurlabham*. Not that it is easy to attain human birth. On the
contrary, it is said: "*Naratvam durlabham loke* and *vidyātatra
sudurlabhā*," etc. ("The state of a man is difficult to attain, and
still more so that of a wise one," cited in Sahitya *Darpaṇam*, chap. i,
by Viśvanātha Kavirāja). What is apparently meant is that, compared with
the difficulty of attaining to Śiva, the state of humanity is easily
attainable.
