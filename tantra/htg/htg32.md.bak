### MAṆIKARṆIKĀ

### (MAṆIKARṆIKĀSTOTRA)

1

It was on Thy bank, O Maṇikarṇikā! <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[1](#fn_1239.md)  
That Hari and Hara, givers of *sāyujya mukti*, <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[2](#fn_1240.md)  
Disputed together at the departure festival <span
id="fr_1248"></span>[3](#fn_1241.md) of a certain one.  
Hari <span id="fr_1249"></span>[4](#fn_1242.md) said, "Let Him be like unto
me;"  
Whereon forthwith from within the body  
Came forth Śiva mounted on Garuda, <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[5](#fn_1243.md)

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

In yellow garment, <span id="fr_1251"></span>[1](#fn_1244.md) with the mark
of Bhrigu's foot on His breast. <span id="fr_1252"></span>[2](#fn_1245.md)

2

Indra and the Thirty, <span id="fr_1253"></span>[3](#fn_1246.md) at the
close of their period of enjoyment, <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[4](#fn_1247.md)'  
Descend to earth again, <span id="fr_1255"></span>[5](#fn_1248.md)  
And are reborn as men, or even as beast, bird, or worm;  
But those, O Mother Maṇikarṇikā! who plunge into thy waters,  
Are freed from sins, and indeed in *Sāyujya* <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[6](#fn_1249.md) man becomes  
Nārāyaṇa  <span id="fr_1257"></span>[7](#fn_1250.md) himself, with crown
and *Kaustubha gem*. <span id="fr_1258"></span>[8](#fn_1251.md)

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

3

Kāśi <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1](#fn_1252.md) is of all cities the most
praiseworthy,  
For it is the city of *vimukti* <span id="fr_1260"></span>[2](#fn_1253.md)
adorned with Gangā.  
There Maṇikarṇikā is the giver of happiness,  
And *Mukti* itself is Her servant. <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[3](#fn_1254.md)  
When Brahmā weighed Heaven with its Devas against Kāśi,  
Kāśi, as the heavier, remained on earth,  
But Heaven, the lighter, rose to the skies.

4

Nought is better than any part of the banks of Gangā,  
But there, where Kāśi is, is the best,  
And Maṇikarṇikā, where Īśvara gives *mukti*, is the best of all.  
This place, inaccessible even to Devas,  
Destroys a mass of sins.  
Through many virtues acquired in previous births  
Alone may it be attained, and by the pure only.

5

The multitude of being is immersed in the ocean of pain,  
How may they gain release?  
It was with this knowledge that Brahmā constructed the city of
Vārānaśī, <span id="fr_1262"></span>[4](#fn_1255.md) which gives all bliss.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

Men seek the happiness of Heaven.  
But in so doing they but show small desire,  
Since from Heaven they must fall again to earth  
At the close of their appointed time of happiness. <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[1](#fn_1256.md)  
But Kāśī is the city of liberation, <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[2](#fn_1257.md)  
Ever beneficent, giving *dharma*, *artha*, *kāma*, and *mokṣa*. <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[3](#fn_1258.md)

6

He who holds the bamboo flute, <span id="fr_1266"></span>[4](#fn_1259.md)
upholder of the mountain, <span id="fr_1267"></span>[5](#fn_1260.md)  
Who bears on his breast the *Śrīvatsa* <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[6](#fn_1261.md) mark,  
And Śiva, with venom in His throat, <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[7](#fn_1262.md)  
Who bears Gangā upon his head, <span id="fr_1270"></span>[8](#fn_1263.md)  
And the husband of Lakṣmī, <span id="fr_1271"></span>[9](#fn_1264.md)  
Are one and the same. <span id="fr_1272"></span>[10](#fn_1265.md)  
Many of such, O Mother Maṇikarṇikā!  
As bathe in Thy waters become Rudras and Haris. <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[11](#fn_1266.md)

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

How, then, can there be any difference between them? <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1](#fn_1267.md)

7

Death upon Thy Banks, which is the giver of happiness,  
Is praised even by the Devas.  
On him who thus dies Śakra <span id="fr_1275"></span>[2](#fn_1268.md) ever
looks with His thousand eyes.  
Sāvitri <span id="fr_1276"></span>[3](#fn_1269.md) of a thousand rays
welcomes Him as He ascends (to the heavens).  
Such a pure one, mounted on a Bull or on Garuda, <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[4](#fn_1270.md)  
May go to whatsoever abode he will.

8

Even the four-headed Deva, <span id="fr_1278"></span>[5](#fn_1271.md)  
The *Guru* who initiates into the meaning of the Veda,  
Is unable even in an hundred of his <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[6](#fn_1272.md) years  
To describe the purity which arises upon bathing at midday in
Maṇikarṇikā.  
But the Deva who bears the moon upon his forehead, <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[7](#fn_1273.md)  
By the power of his *yoga* knows Thy purity.  
Śiva makes that man who dies on Thy Bank  
Either Himself or Nārāyaṇa.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

All such sin-destroying fruit as is earned by millions of troublesome
horse-sacrifices <span id="fr_1281"></span>[1](#fn_1274.md)  
Exists in the purity which comes from bathing in Maṇikarṇikā.  
He, who having bathed therein,  
Reads this hymn, goes to the abode of the light of Brahman,  
Having crossed the great ocean of this world  
As if it were but some little pool.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[201:1](htg32.htm#fr_1246.md) Is the name of a
celebrated *ghat* at Benares, where the bodies of the dead are burnt,
and at which the gem of the ear ornament of the Devī fell. The
Kāśipanchakastotra of Śankara says that where there is *nivṛtti* of
*manas*, there is the great peace. That peace is the foremost of
*tīrthas* (here rivers) and Maṇikarṇikā (*Manonivṛtti paramopaśāntih sā
tīrthavaryā maṇikarṇikāca*).

<span id="fn_1240"></span>[201:2](htg32.htm#fr_1247.md) One of the forms of
qualified *mukti* (liberation); the four muktis are *Sālokya* (remaining
in the same region with the Deva), *Sāmīpya* (remaining near the Deva),
*Sārupya* (receiving the same form as the Deva), and *Sayujya* (becoming
one with the Deva).

<span id="fn_1241"></span>[201:3](htg32.htm#fr_1248.md)
*Prayāṇotsava*--that is, death.

<span id="fn_1242"></span>[201:4](htg32.htm#fr_1249.md) Viṣṇu

<span id="fn_1243"></span>[201:5](htg32.htm#fr_1250.md) The Bird King, who
is the vehicle (*vāhana*) of Viṣṇu, son of Kaśyapa by his wife Vinetā,
elder brother of Aruṇa.

<span id="fn_1244"></span>[202:1](htg32.htm#fr_1251.md) The colour of
Viṣṇu's robes. The verse is intended to show the unity of both Viṣṇu and
Śiva.

<span id="fn_1245"></span>[202:2](htg32.htm#fr_1252.md) The Ṛṣis once
disputed amongst themselves as to the relative merits of Brahmā, Viṣṇu,
and Śiva, and the *Ṛṣī* Bhrigu was sent to test them. The first and last
on being purposely slighted by Bhrigu showed the weakness of resentment.
Finding Viṣṇu lying down with Lakṣmī in the daytime he upbraided him for
this and planted with force his foot on his chest. Viṣṇu not only took
all this in good part, but rubbing the foot of Bhrigu expressed the hope
that the latter had not hurt it by his action. On this exhibition of
divine quality the palm was adjudged to Viṣṇu, who thereafter bore the
mark of Bhrigu's foot on his breast.

<span id="fn_1246"></span>[202:3](htg32.htm#fr_1253.md) *Tridaśah*, a
collective name for the other Devas. The thirty-three (three being
understood) *gaṇas* of Devas, of which the Devī is Tridaśeśvarī.

<span id="fn_1247"></span>[202:4](htg32.htm#fr_1254.md) In heaven
(*Svarga*).

<span id="fn_1248"></span>[202:5](htg32.htm#fr_1255.md) For the enjoyment
in *Svarga*, which is part of the worlds of birth and rebirth, is not
eternal, but on fruition the *jivātmā* again descends to earth to work
out its unexhausted *karma*.

<span id="fn_1249"></span>[202:6](htg32.htm#fr_1256.md) *Sāyujyepi*. As to
*sāyujya*, see *ante*, [p. 201](#page_201.md), note 2.

<span id="fn_1250"></span>[202:7](htg32.htm#fr_1257.md) Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_1251"></span>[202:8](htg32.htm#fr_1258.md) A great and
brilliant gem worn by Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_1252"></span>[203:1](htg32.htm#fr_1259.md) Benares.

<span id="fn_1253"></span>[203:2](htg32.htm#fr_1260.md) *Nirvāṇāmokṣa*, the
highest form of *Mukti* (liberation). As the saying goes: "Ayodhyā,
Mathurā, Gayā, Kāśi, Kānci, Avantikā, Purī, these seven *tīrthas*
(places of pilgrimage) give *mukti*, but Kāśī (Benares) gives *nirvāṇa
mukti*."

<span id="fn_1254"></span>[203:3](htg32.htm#fr_1261.md) As the servant
awaits the orders of his mistress, so *mukti* (liberation) awaits the
command of Maṇikarṇikā.

<span id="fn_1255"></span>[203:4](htg32.htm#fr_1262.md) Benares.

<span id="fn_1256"></span>[204:1](htg32.htm#fr_1263.md) See [p.
202](#page_202.md), note 5.

<span id="fn_1257"></span>[204:2](htg32.htm#fr_1264.md) *Mukti* (see [p.
203](#page_203), note 2.md).

<span id="fn_1258"></span>[204:3](htg32.htm#fr_1265.md) Piety, wealth,
fulfilment of desire, and liberation.

<span id="fn_1259"></span>[204:4](htg32.htm#fr_1266.md) Kṛṣṇa, who is often
so figured.

<span id="fn_1260"></span>[204:5](htg32.htm#fr_1267.md) Mount Govardhana,
which Kṛṣṇa, by his might, upheld.

<span id="fn_1261"></span>[204:6](htg32.htm#fr_1268.md) Curls of hair on
the breast of Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_1262"></span>[204:7](htg32.htm#fr_1269.md) At the churning of
the ocean, poison issued which, to save the world, Śiva swallowed. It
coloured His throat blue; hence he is called Nīlakantha.

<span id="fn_1263"></span>[204:8](htg32.htm#fr_1270.md) The River Ganges
(see [p. 188](htg29.htm#page_188), note 7.md).

<span id="fn_1264"></span>[204:9](htg32.htm#fr_1271.md) Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_1265"></span>[204:10](htg32.htm#fr_1272.md) They with Brahmā;
for as the Rudrayāmala says "Though three they are one" (*Ekam
murtistrayo deva*). All the Devas and Devīs are but manifestations, with
the apparent limitations incident thereto, of the Supreme Unity--the
Brahman.

<span id="fn_1266"></span>[204:11](htg32.htm#fr_1273.md) Śiva and Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_1267"></span>[205:1](htg32.htm#fr_1274.md) That is, they cease
to differ from one another, having become Hari and Hara, who are
themselves one.

<span id="fn_1268"></span>[205:2](htg32.htm#fr_1275.md) Indra, king of the
celestials.

<span id="fn_1269"></span>[205:3](htg32.htm#fr_1276) The sun (Sūrya.md).

<span id="fn_1270"></span>[205:4](htg32.htm#fr_1277.md) The first is the
vehicle (*Vāhana*) of Śiva. The second, the carrier of Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_1271"></span>[205:5](htg32.htm#fr_1278.md) Brahmā.

<span id="fn_1272"></span>[205:6](htg32.htm#fr_1279.md) Not human years.

<span id="fn_1273"></span>[205:7](htg32.htm#fr_1280.md) Śiva.
