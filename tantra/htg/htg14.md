*HRĪM*, *HRĪM* <span id="fr_410"></span>[3](#fn_409) is Thy most
pleasing *bīja*, <span id="fr_411"></span>[4](#fn_410)  
O Thou whose moon-like <span id="fr_412"></span>[5](#fn_411) beauty is
heightened

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

By the lotuses (which surround Thee). <span
id="fr_413"></span>[1](#fn_412)  
O auspicious and favourable Devī!  
Forest fire <span id="fr_414"></span>[2](#fn_413) of the forest of evil
thoughts,  
Whose lotus feet are worshipped by the universe.  
O lotus seated upon a lotus,  
Joy dost thou cause to those who salute Thee,  
Destroyer of Ignorance,  
Spouse of Hari, <span id="fr_415"></span>[3](#fn_414)  
Substance of the world. <span id="fr_416"></span>[4](#fn_415)

2

*AIM*, *AIM* <span id="fr_417"></span>[5](#fn_416) is Thy favourite
*mantra*,  
Thou who art both form and formlessness, <span
id="fr_418"></span>[6](#fn_417)  
Who art the wealth of the lotus face of the lotus-born, <span
id="fr_419"></span>[7](#fn_418)  
Embodiment of all *guṇas*, <span id="fr_420"></span>[8](#fn_419) yet
devoid of attributes, <span id="fr_421"></span>[9](#fn_420)  
Changeless, and neither gross nor subtle. <span
id="fr_422"></span>[10](#fn_421)

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

None know Thy nature, nor is Thy inner reality known. <span
id="fr_423"></span>[1](#fn_422)  
Thou art the whole universe;  
And Thou it is who existeth within it.  
Thou art saluted by the foremost of Devas.  
Without part Thou existeth in Thy fulness everywhere. <span
id="fr_424"></span>[2](#fn_423)  
Ever <span id="fr_425"></span>[3](#fn_424) pure art Thou.

3

Greatly art Thou pleased with the recitation <span
id="fr_426"></span>[4](#fn_425) of the *mantra* *HRĪM*. <span
id="fr_427"></span>[5](#fn_426)  
Thy crown is white as snow. <span id="fr_428"></span>[6](#fn_427)  
Thy hands play with the *vīnā*. <span id="fr_429"></span>[7](#fn_428)  
O Mother! Mother! salutation to Thee.  
Burn, burn my sloth and grant me great intelligence. <span
id="fr_430"></span>[8](#fn_429)  
Thou art Knowledge itself.  
The Vedānta ever sings of Thee.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

*Śruti* <span id="fr_431"></span>[1](#fn_430) speaks of Thee.  
O giver of liberation! O way to liberation!  
Whose power is beyond all understanding.  
O giver of happiness, <span id="fr_432"></span>[2](#fn_431) adorned with
a white necklace, <span id="fr_433"></span>[3](#fn_432)  
Grant to me Thy favours.

4

Thou art intelligence, intelligence, intelligence, <span
id="fr_434"></span>[4](#fn_433)  
Thy names are memory, resolution, mind, and hymn of praise. <span
id="fr_435"></span>[5](#fn_434)  
Eternal and fleeting, <span id="fr_436"></span>[6](#fn_435)  
Great cause, saluted by *Munis*, <span id="fr_437"></span>[7](#fn_436)  
New and old; <span id="fr_438"></span>[8](#fn_437) sacred current of
virtue, <span id="fr_439"></span>[9](#fn_438)  
Saluted by Hari and Hara. <span id="fr_440"></span>[10](#fn_439)  
Ever pure, beauteous of colour,  
The subtlest element <span id="fr_441"></span>[11](#fn_440) of things--

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

Yea, even the very half thereof. <span id="fr_442"></span>[1](#fn_441)  
Thou art the giver of intelligence, intelligence, intelligence.  
Who art the giver of joy to Mādhava. <span
id="fr_443"></span>[2](#fn_442)

5

In the form of *HRĪM*, *KṢĪM*, *DHĪM*, *HRĪM*, <span
id="fr_444"></span>[3](#fn_443)  
Thou holdest a book,  
Thou art joyful, of smiling face, and of good fortune.  
Innocence, current of charm, <span id="fr_445"></span>[4](#fn_444)  
With all powers of arrest. <span id="fr_446"></span>[5](#fn_445)  
Burn, burn my sin,  
And dispel the darkness of my evil thoughts.  
O praiseworthy of all!  
Thou art *Gīh*, *Gauh*, *Vāk*, and *Bhāratī*. <span
id="fr_447"></span>[6](#fn_446)  
It is Thou who grantest success to the tongue of the greatest of poets,

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

As also in the attainment of all (forms of) knowledge. <span
id="fr_448"></span>[1](#fn_447)

6

I pray to Thee, I pray to Thee, I bow to Thee,  
Come to my tongue and never leave me.  
May my intelligence <span id="fr_449"></span>[2](#fn_448) never go
astray,  
May my sins be taken away,  
May I be free from sorrow.  
In time of peril may I never be bewildered.  
May my mind work freely without impediment <span
id="fr_450"></span>[3](#fn_449)  
In *Śāstra* disputation and verse.

7

He who chastely <span id="fr_451"></span>[4](#fn_450) lives, observing
silence <span id="fr_452"></span>[5](#fn_451) and religious
devotions, <span id="fr_453"></span>[6](#fn_452)  
Abstaining from flesh and fish <span id="fr_454"></span>[7](#fn_453) on
the thirteenth day of the month, <span id="fr_455"></span>[8](#fn_454)  
And bowed with devotion, early each morning  
Praises Thee with the most excellent verse.  
Will, skilful in speech, surpass even Vācaspati. <span
id="fr_456"></span>[9](#fn_455)  
The uncleanliness of his sins will be swept away.  
Such an one gains the fruit of his desires,

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

The Devī protects him as though he were Her own child.  
Poetry flows from his mouth,  
Prosperity attends his house,  
And every obstacle to success will disappear.

8

Whoever reads without interruption the whole of this hymn  
Twenty-one times on the thirteenth day of the month, <span
id="fr_457"></span>[1](#fn_456)  
Both on the dark and the light side of the month, <span
id="fr_458"></span>[2](#fn_457)  
And meditates on Sarasvatī garmented in white,  
Adorned with white ornaments,  
Such an one attains in this world the fruit of his desires.  
This auspicious hymn has been made by Brahmā himself;  
Whoever daily reads it with care acquires immortality. <span
id="fr_459"></span>[3](#fn_458)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_407"></span>[74:1](htg14.htm#fr_408) Devī of speech,
eloquence, knowledge, and learning, and Śakti of Brahmā; but formerly,
according to the Purāṇic account, the Spouse of Viṣṇu, represented as a
fair woman with either four or two arms, and often as seated on a lotus
holding a *vīnā*. The Bhāradvaja Smr. says: "Sarasvatī is She who ever
resides in the tongue of all beings and who causes speech." According to
the Vasiṣṭha Rāmā, cited in the Lalitā, verse 137, She is called
Sarasvatī as the possessor (*vati*) of the *saras* (flow of nectar from
the *brahmarandhra*). The Brahmā Purāṇa says the Devī created Sarasvatī
from Her tongue, and from Her shoulders the science of love.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[74:2](htg14.htm#fr_409) P. 579.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[74:3](htg14.htm#fr_410) The *bīja*, or "seed"
mantra of the Devī whose other bīja is the *vāgbhava bīja* or "*aim*."

<span id="fn_410"></span>[74:4](htg14.htm#fr_411) See last note.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[74:5](htg14.htm#fr_412) The colour of
Sarasvatī is white. Thus She is elsewhere represented as "white, holding
the *vīnā*" (*Svetavīnādharā*); "adorned with white flowers"
(*svetābharaṇabhūṣitā*), "holding a white rosary"
(*svetākṣasūtrahastāca*), "besmeared with white sandal paste"
(*svetacandanacarcitā*), "clad in white raiment" (*svetāmbaradharā*),
and the like. Here Her whiteness is compared to the moon.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[75:1](htg14.htm#fr_413) She is seated on and
represented as surrounded by lotuses.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[75:2](htg14.htm#fr_414) *Dāvāgni*. She
destroys such thoughts.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[75:3](htg14.htm#fr_415) Viṣṇu

<span id="fn_415"></span>[75:4](htg14.htm#fr_416) *Samsārasāre*. The
*samsāra* is the illusory world of birth and rebirth, which is said to
be *asara* (unreal, unsubstantial, fleeting). The reality behind this
phenomenal illusion is the Devī, who plays, and whose play is
world-play.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[75:5](htg14.htm#fr_417) The *vāgbhavabīja*.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[75:6](htg14.htm#fr_418) *Rūpārūpaprakāśe*.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[75:7](htg14.htm#fr_419) Brahmā, whose Spouse
She is.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[75:8](htg14.htm#fr_420) The "qualities," or
conditions, which are the substance of *Prakṛti* or *sattva*, *rajas*,
and *tamas*.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[75:9](htg14.htm#fr_421) She is *nirguṇā*, for
She and the *Parabrahman* are in Their essence one.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[75:10](htg14.htm#fr_422) The forms of the Devī
are threefold: *parā* (supreme), *sūkṣmā* (subtle), which consists of
*mantra* and *sthūla* (gross or physical), with hands and feet. But She
is neither of these in the sense that the only true form (*svarūpa*) is
above and beyond them both.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[76:1](htg14.htm#fr_423) *Nāpivijnātatattve*;
another reading being *nāpivijnānatattve*. The reference is to Her
supreme (para) form, of which the Viṣṇu Yāmala says "none know"
(*Mātastvatparamam rūpam tannajānāti kashcana* (see chap. iii. of the
Śāktānandataranginī).

<span id="fn_423"></span>[76:2](htg14.htm#fr_424) She as the Brahman is
*akhaṇḍa* "everywhere" and yet in the limited sense "nowhere," in the
sense that She is at some particular place and not elsewhere, or partly
here and partly there.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[76:3](htg14.htm#fr_425) In past, present, and
future.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[76:4](htg14.htm#fr_426) *Japa*, which includes
that which would not be understood as recitation in the English
sense--viz., *manasa* or mental, and the inaudible *japa*.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[76:5](htg14.htm#fr_427) The bīja of the Devī.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[76:6](htg14.htm#fr_428) Her colour is white

<span id="fn_428"></span>[76:7](htg14.htm#fr_429) A stringed musical
instrument.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[76:8](htg14.htm#fr_430)
*Dehibuddhimprashastām*; the great prayer to Her.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[77:1](htg14.htm#fr_431) Revelation; generally
applied to the Vedas in which Sarasvatī is spoken of (see Muir, OṢṬ.,
verse 339). She is also called Mother of Vedas.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[77:2](htg14.htm#fr_432) *Śāradā*.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[77:3](htg14.htm#fr_433) See note 5, [p.
74](#page_74), *ante*.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[77:4](htg14.htm#fr_434) *Dhī*.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[77:5](htg14.htm#fr_435) *Dhāranā*, *dhriti*
(or constancy), *mati*. She is the "hymn of praise," for it is composed
of words, and She is the Devī thereof, and word and speech itself.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[77:6](htg14.htm#fr_436) She eternally exists
as the reality behind all appearance, and is the cause of the fleeting
appearance itself.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[77:7](htg14.htm#fr_437) Sages.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[77:8](htg14.htm#fr_438) See note 6 *ante*. She
ever appears in new forms, and yet Herself in Her aspect as Atmā,
persists as the one and same.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[77:9](htg14.htm#fr_439) *Puṇya*.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[77:10](htg14.htm#fr_440) Viṣṇu and Śiva.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[77:11](htg14.htm#fr_441) *Mātra*--the atomic
part of things.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[78:1](htg14.htm#fr_442) *Mātrārdhatattve*. She
is so very subtle: or alternatively the Mātrārdha below the *Sāhasrāra*.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[78:2](htg14.htm#fr_443) The husband of Mā or
Lakṣmī--that is, Viṣṇu, whose Spouse She was. She as Prakṛti gives joy
to the *paramātmā*, who is the enjoyer (*bhoktā*).

<span id="fn_443"></span>[78:3](htg14.htm#fr_444) The mantra, as
currently recited is *Om Om Kshīm, Kshīm, svarupe*. "*Kshīm*," for She
is the destructress of sin.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[78:4](htg14.htm#fr_445) *Mohemugdhapravāhe*.
*Mugdhā* is generally used in connection with *nāyikā*--that is, a
simple, artless innocent maiden, as yet unacquainted with love. The
general and correct reading is *mugdhemohapravāhe*.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[78:5](htg14.htm#fr_446) *Stambhanam*; one of
the six "magical" powers known as the *ṣatkarma*, whereby a person may
be paralyzed in action or speech. So a disputant might seek the power of
*stambhanam* to close the mouth of, or confuse his adversary.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[78:6](htg14.htm#fr_447) Various words which
all mean "word" or "speech."

<span id="fn_447"></span>[79:1](htg14.htm#fr_448) Literally, the giver
of *siddhi* (success) in all knowledge of which She is the presiding
Devī.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[79:2](htg14.htm#fr_449) Both *buddhi* and
*manas*.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[79:3](htg14.htm#fr_450) *Prasaratu* ("flow
freely").

<span id="fn_450"></span>[79:4](htg14.htm#fr_451) He who is
*brahmachārin*. Here commences the *phala* portion of the *stotra*.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[79:5](htg14.htm#fr_452) *Maunin*.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[79:6](htg14.htm#fr_453) *Vratin*. The *vrata*
are voluntary religious practices and devotions as distinguished from
the obligatory daily ritual.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[79:7](htg14.htm#fr_454) *Nirāmishah*.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[79:8](htg14.htm#fr_455) The *trayodaśi*; the
*Sarasvatī vrata* day.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[79:9](htg14.htm#fr_456) Or Brihaspati, the
Lord of Speech.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[80:1](htg14.htm#fr_457) *Trayodaśi*.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[80:2](htg14.htm#fr_458) The month is divided
into two halves (*pakṣa*), according as the moon is waxing or waning.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[80:3](htg14.htm#fr_459) *Amṛtatvam*--that is,
liberation (*mukti*).
