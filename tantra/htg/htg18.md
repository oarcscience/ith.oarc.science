### MOTHER OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE

### (SARVAVIŚVAJANANĪ)

### FROM THE DEVĪBHĀGAVATA <span id="fr_640"></span>[1](#fn_638.md)

1

I call to mind the Mother of the whole universe,  
Who has created this world, both real and unreal, <span
id="fr_641"></span>[2](#fn_639.md)  
And who, by Her own power with its three guṇas, <span
id="fr_642"></span>[3](#fn_640.md)  
Protects it, and having destroyed it, She then plays, <span
id="fr_643"></span>[4](#fn_641.md)

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

Commonly is it said that Brahmā creates the universe,  
Yet the learned in Veda and Purāṇā  
Speak of His birth from the navel lotus of Murāri, <span
id="fr_644"></span>[1](#fn_642.md)  
Although it is said He creates, yet He is Himself dependent
therein. <span id="fr_645"></span>[2](#fn_643.md)

3

Even Murāri in the blossom of whose navel lotus, Brahmā was born--  
Deeply sleeps upon his serpent bed <span id="fr_646"></span>[3](#fn_644.md)
at the time of dissolution.  
Therefore Ananta with his thousand hoods is His support.  
How can He who is Himself supported  
Be called a leader <span id="fr_647"></span>[4](#fn_645.md) in the creation
of the world?

4

Even the water of Ocean <span id="fr_648"></span>[5](#fn_646.md) which is a
liquid substance  
Cannot exist without a container; therefore <span
id="fr_649"></span>[6](#fn_647.md)  
I take refuge with Her, the Mother of all beings,

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

Who exists in all things in the form of Power. <span
id="fr_650"></span>[1](#fn_648.md)

5

Brahmā in the lotus,  
Seeing that the eyes of Viṣṇu were closed in deep slumber, <span
id="fr_651"></span>[2](#fn_649.md)  
Prayed to that Devī with whom I take shelter. <span
id="fr_652"></span>[3](#fn_650.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_638"></span>[103:1](htg18.htm#fr_640.md) First Skandha, (chap.
ii.).

<span id="fn_639"></span>[103:2](htg18.htm#fr_641.md) *Sadāsatsvarūpam*, on
which Nīlakantha says: *Vyavahāra drishtyā sat, paramārthadarshanena
asat*; that is the world is real (*sat*) from the point of view of
practical life and reason; to all those, in short, who have not
experimentally realized the *Advaita Tattva*; but to those who have, and
from the transcendental standpoint, it is, in fact, unreal (*asat*).

<span id="fn_640"></span>[103:3](htg18.htm#fr_642.md) *Sattva*, *rajas*,
and *tamas*, the substance of Śakti, as *Prakṛti* (see Introduction).

<span id="fn_641"></span>[103:4](htg18.htm#fr_643.md) *Ramate*--that is,
"in her own self" (*svasminnevakrīrate*) (N) She shines. Hence She is
also called Lalitā. "She who plays;" Padma pr. says, "having passed
beyond the worlds, She plays; hence She is called Lalitā." Beyond Śakti
and Śiva there exist various manifestations of Parāśakti and Sadāśiva,
each in its own sphere. But Mahāsakti, who is Paramaśiva, crossing all
worlds in the supreme sphere of *Mahākailāsa*. She it is who is known as
Lalitā and Kāmeśvarī.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[104:1](htg18.htm#fr_644.md) Viṣṇu as Enemy of the
Daitya Mura.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[104:2](htg18.htm#fr_645.md) Because He is born,
He creates dependent on Bhagavatī. In the next verse the argument is:
"Let Brahmā be not the creator; why not, then, Viṣṇu?" To which the
answer is given of His dependence on Ananta.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[104:3](htg18.htm#fr_646.md) Viṣṇu reposes on the
1,000-headed Serpent Ananta.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[104:4](htg18.htm#fr_647.md) *Netra*.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[104:5](htg18.htm#fr_648.md) Which is again the
support of Ananta.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[104:6](htg18.htm#fr_649.md) And that container
requires a support. Therefore the *ādhāraśakti* is the Mother of all.
For this reason, in commencing any *pūja*, the *Ādhāraśakti* is
worshipped on account of Her being the supporter of all, and that Śakti
is none but the Mother of all.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[105:1](htg18.htm#fr_650.md) *Śaktirūpā*.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[105:2](htg18.htm#fr_651.md) *Yoganidra*, the
sleep of *pralaya*.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[105:3](htg18.htm#fr_652.md) That He might be
roused from his sleep and take part in the cosmic process. Sūta
continues; "Having meditated upon Her who is *Māyā* and *Saguṇā*, and
giver of liberation and *Nirguṇā*, I will tell you, O munis, the whole
Purāṇa, which is the best and the most sacred *Śrīmadbhāgavata* of
18,000 Sanskrit Ślokas."
