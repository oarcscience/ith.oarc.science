### DURGĀ

### (MAHĀBHĀRATA VIRĀṬA PARVAN) <span id="fr_909"></span>[1](#fn_903)

SALUTATION to Thee, O giver of blessings,  
Dark <span id="fr_910"></span>[2](#fn_904) Virgin, <span
id="fr_911"></span>[3](#fn_905) observant of the vow of chastity, <span
id="fr_912"></span>[4](#fn_906)  
Whose form is beauteous as that of the rising sun,  
And Thy face as that of the full moon;  
Four-armed and faced art Thou.  
Wide-hipped, full-breasted, <span id="fr_913"></span>[5](#fn_907)  
Wearing emerald sapphire bangles and armlets;  
Thou art resplendent as Padmā, <span id="fr_914"></span>[6](#fn_908)
Spouse of Nārāyaṇa, <span id="fr_915"></span>[7](#fn_909)  
And rangest the ethereal regions.  
Thy form and chastity <span id="fr_916"></span>[8](#fn_910) are of the
purest.  
Dark art Thou like the blue-black cloud,  
Whose face is beauteous as that of Saṁkarṣaṇa. <span
id="fr_917"></span>[9](#fn_911)  
Long are Thy two arms, as it were bannered poles in honour of
Indra. <span id="fr_918"></span>[10](#fn_912)

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

Thou bearest in Thy six other arms  
A vessel, lotus, bell, noose, bow, a great discus, <span
id="fr_919"></span>[1](#fn_913) and other weapons.  
Purest woman art Thou on earth. <span id="fr_920"></span>[2](#fn_914)  
Thy well-formed ears are decked with beautiful earrings.  
Thy face challenges the moon in beauty.  
Wonderful is Thy crown, and beautiful is the braid (of Thy hair).  
Thy body is like that of a serpent <span
id="fr_921"></span>[3](#fn_915)  
Thou glitterest with brilliant girdle round Thy hips,  
And shinest like Mount Mandara encircled by the snake. <span
id="fr_922"></span>[4](#fn_916)  
With standing peacock feathers on Thy head, Thou art resplendent.  
By Thy vow of virginity Thou hast maintained heaven. <span
id="fr_923"></span>[5](#fn_917)  
It is for this, O slayer of the Asura Mahiṣa, <span
id="fr_924"></span>[6](#fn_918)  
That Thou art praised and worshipped by the Devas for the protection of
the three worlds. <span id="fr_925"></span>[7](#fn_919)  
Foremost of Devas, be gracious to me;

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

Show me Thy mercy, and be auspicious. <span
id="fr_926"></span>[1](#fn_920)  
Both Jaya and Vijayā <span id="fr_927"></span>[2](#fn_921) art Thou.  
Thou givest victory in battle;  
Give me, too, victory, O Devī!  
Give me now a boon.  
Thy constant abode is on the Vindhya, the fore-most of mountains.  
O Kālī! O Kālī! O Mahākālī! <span id="fr_928"></span>[3](#fn_922)  
Thou delightest in wine, meat, and animal sacrifice, <span
id="fr_929"></span>[4](#fn_923)  
Bestowing boons, going whithersoever Thou wilt.  
Thou art ever followed by Brahmā <span id="fr_930"></span>[5](#fn_924)
and other Devas,  
By those who call upon Thee to lighten their burdens.  
As by those who salute Thee at dawn of day.  
Nothing is unattainable either by way of wealth or children  
Thou art called Durgā by all because Thou savest men from
difficulty. <span id="fr_931"></span>[6](#fn_925)  
Whether in dangerous lands or sinking in the great ocean,  
Thou art the sole refuge of men.  
When assailed by robbers, when crossing streams and seas,  
As also in wildernesses and great forests,

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

Those who remember Thee, O Mahādevī! are never lost.  
Thou art fame, prosperity, constancy, success, and modesty,  
Intelligence, knowledge, and man's offspring.  
Thou art the two twilights, <span id="fr_932"></span>[1](#fn_926)  
Night, the light of sun and moon,  
Sleep, beauty, forgiveness, and mercy.  
Thou, when worshipped by Thy devotees, destroyest  
Ignorance, man's fetters, loss of children and wealth, disease and fear
of death.  
I who have lost my kingdom seek Thy protection.  
I bow to Thee, Sureśvarī, with bended head:  
Grant me protection,  
Thou whose eyes are like the leaf of the lotus.  
O Thou who art truth itself, be true to us.  
O Durgā! give me shelter,

Who art merciful to Thy devotees, protect me. <span
id="fr_933"></span>[2](#fn_927)
