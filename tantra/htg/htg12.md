### MAHIṢĀMARDINĪ <span id="fr_349"></span>[1](#fn_349)

### (MAHIṢĀMARDINĪSTOTRA)

### FROM THE TANTRASĀRA <span id="fr_350"></span>[2](#fn_350)

1

O CANDĪ! <span id="fr_351"></span>[3](#fn_351) wander in my heart,  
By whom the act of formidable Asura <span
id="fr_352"></span>[4](#fn_352) was shattered,  
Destroy the calamities which deeply pierce me,  
Arising from the mass of malice and fears (which assail me),  
So that, free from danger,  
And protected by the lotus cluster of Thy feet,  
My swan-like <span id="fr_353"></span>[5](#fn_353) mind may swim and
rejoice in the ocean of bliss.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

2

What fear of his enemies has he who worships Thee?  
The Devas who worship Thy feet stamping on beast and noose, <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_354)  
Having abandoned the form of Narasimha, <span
id="fr_355"></span>[2](#fn_355)  
Whose towering mane reached the summit of Mount Sumeru,  
And whose fingers are outstretched to tear (the breast of)
Hiraṇyakaśipu, <span id="fr_356"></span>[3](#fn_356)  
Now worship the lion, <span id="fr_357"></span>[4](#fn_357) the enemy of
the elephant. <span id="fr_358"></span>[5](#fn_358)

3

O Candī! when the syllables, the letters of which speak of Thee,  
Reach the ear, then Brahmā and other Devas  
Sing the truth, touching Puruṣa and Prakṛti. <span
id="fr_359"></span>[6](#fn_359)

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

O Devī! be to-day gracious to me,  
Devoted as I am to the kissing of Thy beautiful lotus feet,  
The one and only glittering abode of the essence of the nectar of all
Devatās.

4

If, because of my following your way of Kula, <span
id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_360)  
I suffer reproach better is it that I shall thus be without fame.  
Let me not have that which comes of the worship of Keśava <span
id="fr_361"></span>[2](#fn_361) and Kauśika; <span
id="fr_362"></span>[3](#fn_362)  
Rather, O Mother! let my heart rest in meditation on Thy lotus feet,  
Worshipped by Brahmā, Hari, the enemy of Smara <span
id="fr_363"></span>[4](#fn_363) and the enemy of the Daityas. <span
id="fr_364"></span>[5](#fn_364)

5

O Mother! if I be engaged in the rightful <span
id="fr_365"></span>[6](#fn_365) contemplation of Thy lotus feet,

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

What matters it if I know not <span id="fr_366"></span>[7](#fn_366)
other sacred places? <span id="fr_367"></span>[1](#fn_367)  
May Thy lotus feet be ever present to my mind--  
Thy feet which are the wealth of our wounds! <span
id="fr_368"></span>[2](#fn_368)  
O propitious Mother! do Thou forgive me.

6

Verily and without doubt, even the Lord of Bhūtas <span
id="fr_369"></span>[3](#fn_369) would have perished, <span
id="fr_370"></span>[4](#fn_370)  
Maddened as He was with the joy of the embrace of (Thee who art) His own
self, <span id="fr_371"></span>[5](#fn_371)  
Had He not enjoyed the lotus fragrance of Thy feet,  
Full of honey from which drop liquid sandal,  
And the nectar, there haply fallen from the moon. <span
id="fr_372"></span>[6](#fn_372)

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

7

O Mother! let the stream of heavy showers of holy devotion
[towards](errata.htm#7) Thee  
Be ever shed upon me,  
Struggling and drowning, alas! as I am in the endless ocean of
illusion, <span id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_373)  
Without taste of the springing water of the Bliss of Brahman, <span
id="fr_374"></span>[2](#fn_374)  
Which dispels the weight of mental afflictions from numbers of Devas.

8

May (Thy) glory, <span id="fr_375"></span>[3](#fn_375) dark as collyrium
cloud, Be ever in my heart.  
From its glittering lustre were born the three Devatās,  
Who create, maintain, and destroy the world,  
Whose substance is pure intelligence and bliss, <span
id="fr_376"></span>[4](#fn_376)  
Dispelling the darkness which overspreads the heart  
By the (glory of the unnumbered)millions of their rays!

9

May <span id="fr_377"></span>[5](#fn_377) Devī Mahiṣāmardinī, who hath
power to destroy

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

The proud enemies of the Devas,  
And is the slayer of many another demon,  
Ever conquer!  
She it was who, having severed the head of the Asura Mahiṣa,  
Seized upon him who assumed the form of a buffalo by his magic art  
Upon the field of battle,  
Now bellowing, now running, now lowering his head downward,  
Falling upon the battlefield, and then vanishing from it for a while.

10

She kills the Asuras upon the battlefield.  
Terrible it was, with the dancing of the weapons and streamers <span
id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_378) of the enemy.  
With a cloud of thrown discus and other missiles.  
There the copper-coloured weapon <span id="fr_379"></span>[2](#fn_379)
dashed and flashed from the enemy's arrows--  
Enemies so stout, strong, and tall, proud of wealth and power,  
The field of battle thus seemed to have been swept by a tempest,  
Most hideous it was, thickly spread with limbs and dead bodies of
Asuras,  
In whose blood and flesh birds slaked their thirst and appeased their
hunger.

11

Let the Sadhaka meditate upon Devī Mahiṣāmardinī.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

Rushing now here, now there on the field of battle for the slaughter of
the enemies,  
Attended by eight companion Mātrikas, <span
id="fr_380"></span>[1](#fn_380)  
Ear-ringed with eight-petalled lotuses,  
Within each petal of which are writ the eight syllables  
*Mahiṣāmardinyai namah*. <span id="fr_381"></span>[2](#fn_381)  
Formidable was that field with the tossing of the huge curved horns of
Mahiṣa,  
Deeply black, maddened, wandering to and fro, horribly roaring  
Whose instant death was desired of the Devas.

12

Let the Sādhaka meditate  
Upon the auspicious black *Bhogavatī* <span
id="fr_382"></span>[3](#fn_382) Mahiṣāmardinī,  
Holding in Her hands discus, lance, axe, shield, arrow, bow, and
trident,  
Making the gesture <span id="fr_383"></span>[4](#fn_383) which dispels
fear;  
Her long, matted hair is like a bank of cloud,  
Covering Her face most formidable,  
Loudly screaming, now with peals of terrible laughter,  
And then with Her threats greatly frightening the Daitya heroes.

13

O Devī! such as in this manner  
Meditate upon Thy faultless form,

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

Worshipped by Indra and other Devas,  
To them it is given to attack the cities of their enemies,  
And, conquering their enemies, to gain a kingdom;  
They, too, acquire nectar of the knowledge of poesy,  
And power to arrest, banish and slay. <span
id="fr_384"></span>[1](#fn_384)

14

O Mother! salutation to Thee! May Thou conquer!  
Whosoever, meditating upon Thy lotus feet,  
Utters this Thy hymn,  
In the palms of the hands of all such  
Are forthwith wealth, fulfilment of desire, and liberation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_349"></span>[62:1](htg12.htm#fr_349) A title of Durgā,
Śakti of Śiva as the powerful victrix of demons. She is Mahiṣāmardinī,
as the slayer of Mahiṣa. The Daitya Śumbha attacked Her in the form of a
buffalo (*Mahiṣa*; see Candi).

<span id="fn_350"></span>[62:2](htg12.htm#fr_350) P. 574.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[62:3](htg12.htm#fr_351) A form of the Devī
assumed for the destruction of the Daitya Canda, and who assisted in the
destruction of the demon Raktabīja (see Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa).

<span id="fn_352"></span>[62:4](htg12.htm#fr_352) Mahiṣa.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[62:5](htg12.htm#fr_353) *Manohamsa*, the
*hamsa*, is variously described as a swan, goose, and flamingo.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[63:1](htg12.htm#fr_354) The Devī is standing
on Her lion (*v. post*) with the noose (*pāśa*) beneath Her feet.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[63:2](htg12.htm#fr_355) The Man-lion
(*Avatāra*) of Viṣṇu, in which He destroyed the Daitya Hiraṇyakaśipu,
father of His devotee Prahlāda.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[63:3](htg12.htm#fr_356) See last note. The
*avatāra* is generally represented with the King of the Daityas across
his knees, tearing asunder with his hands and claws the latter's belly.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[63:4](htg12.htm#fr_357) Which accompanies the
Devī as Durgā. After the destruction of Hiraṇyakaśipu, Viṣṇu's wrath was
not appeased. The world trembled, fearing what he might do. The Devas
asked the help of Śiva, who assumed the Sharabha form--that of a lion
with wings and eight feet--who tossed up Viṣṇu into the air and held him
there until he had become powerless. The lion then went to the feet of
Durgā, whom he accompanies.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[63:5](htg12.htm#fr_358) *Gaja*, the elephant
form subsequently assumed by the Asura, Mahiṣa.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[63:6](htg12.htm#fr_359) Śiva and Śakti, the
"Male" and "Female" elements, from whose union springs the universe (see
*Introduction to Tantra Śāstra* and *Principles of Tantra*.)

<span id="fn_360"></span>[64:1](htg12.htm#fr_360) That is, *Kulācāra*,
one, and the highest, of the divisions of Tāntrik worshippers often
misunderstood, and therefore subject of reproach; and which is
contrasted in the next line but one with the more popular and
conventional worshipper of Keśava and Kauśika.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[64:2](htg12.htm#fr_361) Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[64:3](htg12.htm#fr_362) An epithet both of
Śiva and Indra, probably here the former.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[64:4](htg12.htm#fr_363) Smara, the God of
Love; Śiva, who slew him, is his "enemy."

<span id="fn_364"></span>[64:5](htg12.htm#fr_364) *Daityāri*: usually an
epithet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but as Hari has already been mentioned, possibly
the reference may be to Indra.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[64:6](htg12.htm#fr_365) i. e., orderly,
according to the direction and sequence of the dhyāna or stotra.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[65:7](htg12.htm#fr_366) Literally, "If I be
deprived of."

<span id="fn_367"></span>[65:1](htg12.htm#fr_367) *Siddhāspada*, where
the perfect (*siddha*) are, or where *Siddhi* (power and perfection) may
be gained.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[65:2](htg12.htm#fr_368) That is, they are the
healers of our pain.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[65:3](htg12.htm#fr_369) Śiva Bhūteśvara or
Bhūtanātha. *Bhūta*, which in a general sense means "beings,"
specifically refers to the spirits and ghosts by whom Śiva is surrounded
and of whom He is Master.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[65:4](htg12.htm#fr_370) It is by the Devī's
aid that Śiva is Parameśvara, for without Śakti He is nothing, and
without Her life-giving energy and support cannot exist. As the Kubjikā
Tantra says: "Without their Śaktis the husbands are but *preta*" (inert
corpses). So also the Jnānārnava: "O beloved, pure Sadāśiva without
Śakti is without motion like a corpse, for without Śakti He can do
nothing."

<span id="fn_371"></span>[65:5](htg12.htm#fr_371) *Svātmānam
parirabhya*. Literally, having embraced Himself. The Devī is, however,
in a dualistic sense, His sacred half, and in reality one with Him and
His own self (see Mahānirvāṇa Tantra, chap. i.).

<span id="fn_372"></span>[65:6](htg12.htm#fr_372) *Daivādvichyuta candra
candanarasaprāgalbhya garbashravat*--"Haply" in the poetical sense, as
the nectar should be in the moon, but it happens to be dropping from the
sacred feet of the Devī. Moreover, the Parambindu, which is Śivaśakti,
is in the crescent of Nirvāṇakalā, which is by Amākalā the sixteenth
digit <span id="page_66">p. 66</span> of the moon-circle
(*Candramaṇḍala*), whence flows the nectar which, as Ichchhā, is the
eternal precursor of creation (see Commentary, verse 49, of the
Ṣatcakranirūpaṇa in *The Serpent Power*).

<span id="fn_373"></span>[66:1](htg12.htm#fr_373) *Viddhā*, not as the
original has it, *Siddha*.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[66:2](htg12.htm#fr_374)
*Brahmānandasarābhiṣeka* in the original should be
*Brahmānandarāsābhiṣeka*.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[66:3](htg12.htm#fr_375) *Mahas*, not *maham*,
as in the text.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[66:4](htg12.htm#fr_376)
*Nirmalacidānandatrayamdaivatam*.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[66:5](htg12.htm#fr_377) Verses 9 to 12 are a
free rendering of a text which in parts is so corrupt as to be
[untranslatable](errata.htm#8) with accuracy.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[67:1](htg12.htm#fr_378) Chowrie.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[67:2](htg12.htm#fr_379) That is, fire.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[68:1](htg12.htm#fr_380) The Devīs so called.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[68:2](htg12.htm#fr_381) Salutation to the Devī
slayer of Mahiṣa.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[68:3](htg12.htm#fr_382) For She has all
powers.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[68:4](htg12.htm#fr_383) [The](errata.htm#9)
*abhaya* *mudrā* (see [p. 36](htg08.htm#page_36), note 1).

<span id="fn_384"></span>[69:1](htg12.htm#fr_384) *Stambhanam*,
*uchchātanam*, and *māraṇam*, three of the Tāntrik *Ṣatḳarma*.
