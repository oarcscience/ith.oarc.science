### BHAIRAVĪ <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79)

### (BHAIRAVĪSTOTRA)

### FROM THE TANTRASĀRA <span id="fr_80"></span>[2](#fn_80)

1

THUS shall I pray to Thee, O Tripurā, <span
id="fr_81"></span>[3](#fn_81)  
To attain the fruit of my desires,  
In this hymn by which men attain that Lakṣmī, <span
id="fr_82"></span>[4](#fn_82)  
Who is worshipped by the Devas.

2

Origin of the world thou art,  
Yet hast Thou Thyself no origin,  
Though with hundreds of hymns.  
Even Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Maheśvara <span id="fr_83"></span>[5](#fn_83)
cannot know Thee. <span id="fr_84"></span>[6](#fn_84)  
Therefore we worship Thy breasts, Mother of all *Śāstra*, <span
id="fr_85"></span>[7](#fn_85)  
Shining with fresh saffron.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

3

O Tripurā, <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86) we adore Thee,  
Whose body shines with the splendour of a thousand risen suns,  
Holding with two of thy hands a book <span id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_87)
and rosary of *rudrākṣa* beads, <span id="fr_88"></span>[3](#fn_88)  
And with two others making the gestures  
Which grant boons and dispel fear. <span id="fr_89"></span>[4](#fn_89)  
With three lotus eyes is Thy lotus face adorned.  
Beauteous is Thy Neck with its necklace of large pearls. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[5](#fn_90)

4

O Mother, how can the ignorant, whose minds are restless with doubt and
dispute,  
Know Thy form ravishing with its vermilion, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[6](#fn_91)  
Stooping with the weight of Thy breasts, <span
id="fr_92"></span>[7](#fn_92)  
Accessible only by merit,  
Acquired in previous birth?

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

5

O *Bhavānī*, <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93) the *munis* <span
id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94) describe thee in physical form; <span
id="fr_95"></span>[3](#fn_95)  
The *Śruti* speaks of Thee in subtle form;  
Others call Thee presiding Deity of speech;  
Others, again, as the root of the worlds.  
But we think of Thee  
As the untraversable ocean of mercy, and nothing else.

6

Worshippers contemplate Thee in their heart  
As three-eyed, adorned with the crescent moon,  
White as the autumnal moon,  
Whose substance is the fifty letters, <span
id="fr_96"></span>[4](#fn_96)  
Holding in Thy hands a book, a rosary, a jar of nectar, and making the
*vyakhya mudrā*. <span id="fr_97"></span>[5](#fn_97)

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

7

O Tripurā, Thou art Śambhu <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98) united
with Pārvatī. <span id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_99)  
Thou art now Viṣṇu embraced by Kamalā, <span
id="fr_100"></span>[3](#fn_100)  
And now Brahmā born of the lotus. <span
id="fr_101"></span>[4](#fn_101)  
Thou art again the presiding Devī of speech,  
And yet again art the energy of all these.

8

I, having taken refuge with the four--  
*Bhāvas*, <span id="fr_102"></span>[5](#fn_102) *Parā*, and others <span
id="fr_103"></span>[6](#fn_103) born of the *vāgbhava* (*bīja*), <span
id="fr_104"></span>[7](#fn_104)

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

Shall never in my heart forget Thee, the supreme Devatā,  
Whose substance is existence and intelligence, <span
id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105)  
And who expresseth by Thy throat and other organ  
The bhāva appearing in the form of letters. <span
id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_106)

9

The blessed, having conquered the six enemies, <span
id="fr_107"></span>[3](#fn_107)  
And drawing in their breath, <span id="fr_108"></span>[4](#fn_108)  
With steady mind fix their gaze on the tip of their nostrils,  
And contemplate in their head Thy moon-crested form, <span
id="fr_109"></span>[5](#fn_109)  
Resplendent as the newly risen sun.

10

The Vedas proclaim that Thou createth the world,  
Having assumed the other half of the body of the enemy of Kāma. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[6](#fn_110)  
Verily is it true, O Daughter of the mountain and the only
World-mother,  
That had this not been so,  
The multitude of worlds would never have been.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

11

In company with the wives of the Kinnaras, <span
id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111)  
The Siddha women, <span id="fr_112"></span>[2](#fn_112) whose eyes are
reddened by wine <span id="fr_113"></span>[3](#fn_113)  
Having worshipped Thee with the flowers of celestial trees <span
id="fr_114"></span>[4](#fn_114)  
In Thy *pītha* <span id="fr_115"></span>[5](#fn_115) in the caverns of
the golden mountain, <span id="fr_116"></span>[6](#fn_116)  
Sing Thy praises.

12

I worship in my heart the Devī whose body is moist with nectar, <span
id="fr_117"></span>[7](#fn_117)  
Beauteous as the splendour of lightning,  
Who, going from Her abode to that <span id="fr_118"></span>[8](#fn_118)
of Śiva, <span id="fr_119"></span>[9](#fn_119)  
Opens the lotuses on the beautiful way <span
id="fr_120"></span>[10](#fn_120)

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

         of the *suṣuṁnā*. <span id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121)

13

O Tripurā, I take refuge at Thy lotus feet,  
Worshipped by Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Maheśvara;  
The abode of bliss, the source of the Vedas,  
The origin of all prosperity;  
Thou whose body is Intelligence itself. <span
id="fr_122"></span>[2](#fn_122)

14

I shall never forget Her who is the giver of happiness;  
She it is, O Mother, who, in the form of the Moon,  
Creates the world full of sounds and their meanings,  
And again, by Her power in the form of the Sun,  
She it is who maintains the world.  
And She, again, it is who, in the form of Fire, destroys the whole
universe at the end of the ages. <span id="fr_123"></span>[3](#fn_123)

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

15

Men worship Thee under various names--  
As Nārāyaṇa <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124); as She who saves from
the ocean of Hell; <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125)  
As Gaurī; <span id="fr_126"></span>[3](#fn_126) as the allayer of
grief; <span id="fr_127"></span>[4](#fn_127) as Sarasvatī, <span
id="fr_128"></span>[5](#fn_128)  
And as the three-eyed giver of knowledge. <span
id="fr_129"></span>[6](#fn_129)

16

O Mother of the world, such as worship Thee with twelve Verses of this
hymn attain to Thee, and gain all powers <span
id="fr_130"></span>[7](#fn_130) of speech and the supreme abode.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[23:1](htg07.htm#fr_79) Fem. of Bhairava, a name
of Śiva.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[23:2](htg07.htm#fr_80) P. 596, Ed. Rasik Mohun
Chatterjee.

Tripurasundarī--*post*.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[23:4](htg07.htm#fr_82) Devī of prosperity.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[23:5](htg07.htm#fr_83) Śiva.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[23:6](htg07.htm#fr_84) In the Viṣṇu Yāmala,
Viṣṇu says of the Devī: "Thy supreme form none know
"(*mātastvatparamarūpam tannajānāti kashchana*), (see chap. iii
Śāktānandataranginī).

<span id="fn_85"></span>[23:7](htg07.htm#fr_85) *Vāngmaya*.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[24:1](htg07.htm#fr_86) See *post*.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[24:2](htg07.htm#fr_87) *Vidyā*.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[24:3](htg07.htm#fr_88) Seed of a plant sacred
to the worship of Śiva.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[24:4](htg07.htm#fr_89) That is, She makes the
*mudrā vara* and *abhaya*. In the first the hand is held forth in front
of the body with the palm upward and horizontal, the fingers together,
and the thumb crossing the palm to the fourth finger. In the second the
hand is held up with the fingers and thumb in the same positions with
the palm towards the spectator.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[24:5](htg07.htm#fr_90) *Tārā*, the ordinary
pearl, is called *muktā*.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[24:6](htg07.htm#fr_91) *Sindūra*, the
Bhairavī's body is painted with vermilion and Her garments also are red.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[24:7](htg07.htm#fr_92) *Kuchabharaṇamrām* (see
Introduction).

<span id="fn_93"></span>[25:1](htg07.htm#fr_93) The Devī is Bhavānī as
the spouse and giver of Life to Bhava.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[25:2](htg07.htm#fr_94) Sages.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[25:3](htg07.htm#fr_95) There are three forms of
the Devī--the gross or physical, with hands, feet, etc.; the subtle
(*sūkṣma*), consisting of *mantra* and the supreme (*parā*), which is
the real or own (*svarūpā*). The form of the Devī has both *prakāśa* and
*vimarśa* aspects--that is real and secondary or manifested. Thus the
Vāmakeśvara Tantra says: "The Devī Tripurā is Her real form. She who is
of a red colour is the manifested one."

<span id="fn_96"></span>[25:4](htg07.htm#fr_96) Of the alphabet or
*mātṛkā* (*panchāśadākṣaramayīm*). These letters stand for the *vṛtti*
(functions and qualities of being). The Devī is thus *mātṛkāmayī*, or
composed of *mātṛkā*.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[25:5](htg07.htm#fr_97) *Vyakhya*. according to
the Śabda Kalpadruma = *vivaraṇam* (description), or *grantha* (book),
and also commentary, but here denotes a *mudrā* of that name.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[26:1](htg07.htm#fr_98) Śiva, one of the forms
of the four *mahāpreta*, whose bīja is "*Hsau*."

<span id="fn_99"></span>[26:2](htg07.htm#fr_99) The androgyne form,
called *ardhanārīśvara*, half being Śiva and the other half Śakti.
According to Hindu belief, the wife is the pure and sacred (*puṇyā*)
half of her husband's body, and besides shares the purity and merits of
her husband according to the common saying *Śarīrārdham smṛtā jāyā puṇyā
puṇyāphale samā*.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[26:3](htg07.htm#fr_100) Lakṣmī.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[26:4](htg07.htm#fr_101) That is, the power of
destruction, maintenance, and creation.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[26:5](htg07.htm#fr_102) The four *bhāvas* are
states or conditions of Kuṇḍalinī appearing as sound and its subtle
elements, and are *Parā*, whose abode (*sthāna*) is the *mūlādhāra*;
*Paśyantī* in the *svādhiṣṭhāna*; *Madḥyamā* in the *anāhata*; and
*Vaikharī* in the *viśuddha* issuing through [the](errata.htm#3) throat
(see next note). There appears, however, to be some difference as to the
location of the second.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[26:6](htg07.htm#fr_103) *Parā* is the first
condition of Kuṇḍalinī in the form of tāmasik sound in the *Mūlādhāra*;
*Paśyantī* is the *bhāva* when Kuṇḍalinī, associated with *manas*,
reaches the position variously stated as the *svādiṣṭhāna* or
*manipūra*; *Madhyamā*, when it reaches the *anāhatacakra*, associated
with *buddhi*; and *Vaikharī* is when Kuṇḍalinī issues through the
throat in the form of the fifty letters. It is said that though there
are thus four kinds of speech, the gross-minded do not understand the
first three, and think speech to be *Vaikharī* alone.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[26:7](htg07.htm#fr_104) That is, *Āim* the
*bīja* of Sarasvatī. The Devī is 'three syllabled' (*Tryakṣarī*)--that
is, the *bīja* of the three divisions of the <span id="page_27">p.
27</span> *Panchadaśi*, *Vāgbhava*, *Kāmārāja* and *Śakti*. According to
the Vāmakeśvara Tantra, Vāgiśvarī is the *jnānā śakti*, which is in the
*vāgbhava* division, and confers salvation, the *kāmārāja* and *śakti*
divisions being the *kriyā* and *ichchhā sākti* (see the Lalitā, verse
126).

<span id="fn_105"></span>[27:1](htg07.htm#fr_105) *Sacchinmayī*, the
Brahman being *sat* and *chit*.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[27:2](htg07.htm#fr_106) That is, they
ultimately so appear, though previously existing as subtle elements of
sound.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[27:3](htg07.htm#fr_107) The six sins: Lust
(*kāma*), anger (*krodha*), greed (*lobha*), delusion (*moha*), pride
(*mada*), envy (*mātsaryā*).

<span id="fn_108"></span>[27:4](htg07.htm#fr_108) *Akunchya vayam* by
*pūraka* of *prānāyāmā*.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[27:5](htg07.htm#fr_109) As Śakti of Śiva.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[27:6](htg07.htm#fr_110) Śiva. The Androgyne
form *ardhanārīśvara*.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[28:1](htg07.htm#fr_111) A lower order of Devas
(*devayoni*).

<span id="fn_112"></span>[28:2](htg07.htm#fr_112) Wives of the Siddhas,
also celestial spirits (*devayoni*) inhabiting the atmospheric plane
(*bhuvah*).

<span id="fn_113"></span>[28:3](htg07.htm#fr_113) *Asvāditāsavarasāruna
netrapadma*.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[28:4](htg07.htm#fr_114) *Pādapa*, so called
because the tree drinks by its roots. As to the celestial trees (see
"Wave of Bliss" *post*).

<span id="fn_115"></span>[28:5](htg07.htm#fr_115) Seat or shrine.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[28:6](htg07.htm#fr_116) Sumeru.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[28:7](htg07.htm#fr_117) For She as Kuṇḍalinī
goes from the *mūlādhāra* to the *śivasthāna* in the *sahasrāra* and
returns moist with the nectar of Her union with Him.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[28:8](htg07.htm#fr_118) *Rajādhani*. Literally
capital city of Śiva.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[28:9](htg07.htm#fr_119) That is from the
*mūlādhāra cakra* to the *śivasthāna*.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[28:10](htg07.htm#fr_120) The *suṣuṁnā* is the
central "nerve" (*nādī*), or, rather, channel of energy in the body in
which the lotuses (*ṣatcakra*) are threaded with their heads normally
downwards. As Kuṇḍalinī becomes stirred by the yoga process, She ascends
from the <span id="page_29">p. 29</span> *mūlādhāra* and enters the
higher *cakra*. As She does so, the lotuses upturn and expand again,
closing on her departure.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[29:1](htg07.htm#fr_121) The text which has
*sausuvartma kamalāni vikāshayantim*, is not, however, intelligible, and
the metre is short. Possibly it is a misprint for *saumyang*.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[29:2](htg07.htm#fr_122) That is, nothing but
intelligence *caitanyamātra tanu*.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[29:3](htg07.htm#fr_123) *Nādā*, as Rāghava
Bhatta says, exists in the three states of *nibodhikā* or *bodhinī*,
*nāda*, and in the form of *bindu*, according to the predominance of the
*guṇa*. These three and the *śaktis*, *jnānā*, *kriyā* and *ichhā*, of
which they are special manifestations, are said to be in the form of
sun, moon, and fire respectively. The moon (*indu*) is *ichchhā* (will
and desire), the eternal precursor of creation. *Kriyā* is like the sun,
which makes all things visible. *Jnānā* is fire, as it burns up all
actions (see Ṣatcakranirūpaṇā, verse 49, and Sāradā Tilaka, chap. i.).

<span id="fn_124"></span>[30:1](htg07.htm#fr_124) As Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[30:2](htg07.htm#fr_125) *Narakārnatārinī*.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[30:3](htg07.htm#fr_126) Spouse of Śiva. The
Devī Purāṇa says; "She who was burned by the fire of *yoga* was again
born of Himālaya; as She has the colour of the conch, jasmine, and moon,
she is called Gaurī." Her colour is golden. Śiva said to Pārvatī: "O
Daughter of Himalaya, I am white as the moon and thou art dark. I am the
sandal-tree, and thou art, as it were, a snake entwined round it."
Pārvatī, taking umbrage at this remark upon Her dark complexion, went
away to the forest, and there, by the performance of austerities, gained
for herself a golden complexion beautiful as the sunlit sky.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[30:4](htg07.htm#fr_127) *Khedāshāmine*.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[30:5](htg07.htm#fr_128) Śiva.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[30:6](htg07.htm#fr_129) Devī of speech and
learning.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[30:7](htg07.htm#fr_130) *Vāksiddhi* or
*siddhi* of words.
