### GANGĀ

### (GANGĀṢṬAKAM)

1

O BHAGAVATĪ GANGĀ! <span id="fr_1094"></span>[1](#fn_1088.md)  
Thou art the playful garland on the head of Hara; <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[2](#fn_1089.md)  
Such as but touch a drop of the spray of Thy waters  
Recline on the lap of the fan-holding women of the city of the
immortals, <span id="fr_1096"></span>[3](#fn_1090.md)  
Freed of the fear arising from the sinful Kālī age. <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[4](#fn_1091.md)

2

(O Devī Gangā!) may you purify us,  
Thou who separateth the earth from Heaven, <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[5](#fn_1092.md)  
Gladdening the creeper-like matted hair on the head of Hara, <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[6](#fn_1093.md)  
Descending from the region of heaven,  
Oozing from out the cave of the golden mountain, <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[7](#fn_1094.md)  
Falling upon the surface of the earth,

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

Purifier (as the River Mandākinī) of the city of the Devas,  
Who art the powerful Destructress of the multitude of men's sins.

3

The trunks of elephants and their young make play with Thy waters,  
Fragrant with ichor-maddened swarms of bees,  
Trickling from the temples of elephants bathing therein.  
Thy stream is browned with the sandal paste  
Dropping from the breasts of Siddha women <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[1](#fn_1095.md) who bathe therein.  
And nigh the river bank Thy water is strewn with *Kuśa* <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[2](#fn_1096.md) grass and flowers,  
There thrown by sages <span id="fr_1103"></span>[3](#fn_1097.md) at morn
and even. <span id="fr_1104"></span>[4](#fn_1098.md)  
May the water of the Ganges protect us!

4

This divine sin-destroying Bhāgīrathī <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[5](#fn_1099.md) now on earth  
Was in the beginning water in the vessel <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[6](#fn_1100.md) of the Primeval Grandfather. <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[7](#fn_1101.md)  
Then it was pure water from the feet of the Lord (Viṣṇu),

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

Who sleeps on the serpent. <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1](#fn_1102.md)  
Again it was the gem adorning the matted hair of Śiva, <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[2](#fn_1103.md)  
And, lastly, the daughter of the great sage Jahnu. <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[3](#fn_1104.md)

5

May the entrancing <span id="fr_1111"></span>[4](#fn_1105.md) Gangā falling
on the matted hair <span id="fr_1112"></span>[5](#fn_1106.md) of
Hara, <span id="fr_1113"></span>[6](#fn_1107.md)  
Descending from the Lord of Mountains,  
Moving sinuously like a serpent to the ocean,  
Flowing by the city of Kāśī, <span id="fr_1114"></span>[7](#fn_1108.md)  
Dispeller of countless worldly fears, <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[8](#fn_1109.md)  
Saviour of those who bathe in Her waters,  
Be ever victorious.

6

How can he who has seen Thy wave be bound by illusion?

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

To him who has drunk of Thy water thou givest a dwelling in the city of
the yellow-clad Deva. <span id="fr_1116"></span>[1](#fn_1110.md)  
O Gangā! what time the bodies of those who assume body <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[2](#fn_1111.md) fall on Thy lap, <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[3](#fn_1112.md)  
For such, O Mother, <span id="fr_1119"></span>[4](#fn_1113.md) even
Shatakrīta's <span id="fr_1120"></span>[5](#fn_1114.md) grandeur <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[6](#fn_1115.md) is but a small thing.

7

O Bhagavatī! <span id="fr_1122"></span>[7](#fn_1116.md) on Thy bank I drink
Thy water only.  
I worship Kṛṣṇa, all thirst for worldly enjoyment having gone.  
Destroyer of all sin, Whose companionship is the stairway to
Heaven, <span id="fr_1123"></span>[8](#fn_1117.md)  
O Devī! Gangā of lightsome, tremulous wave,  
Be gracious to me.

8

O Mother! O Spouse of Śambhu! <span id="fr_1124"></span>[9](#fn_1118.md)  
Who art ever associated with Śambhu  
At death, upon Thy banks, with my hands folded upon my head,

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

Remembering Thy name and the feet of Nārāyaṇa, <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1](#fn_1119.md)  
May my devotion to Hara and Hari <span id="fr_1126"></span>[2](#fn_1120.md)
ever endure  
At the time of the festival of life's departure! <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[3](#fn_1121.md)  
He who of pure mind reads this sacred eight-versed hymn to Gangā  
Will be wholly released of all sin  
And will go the region of Viṣṇu. <span id="fr_1128"></span>[4](#fn_1122.md)

<span id="fn_1097"></span>[176:3](htg28.htm#fr_1103.md) *Munis*.

<span id="fn_1098"></span>[176:4](htg28.htm#fr_1104.md) The flower and
grass is thrown by them when they worship the Ganges in the morning and
evening.

<span id="fn_1099"></span>[176:5](htg28.htm#fr_1105.md) Gangā is called
Bhagirathi, because She was brought down from heaven by the prayer of
Bhagīratha, son of the solar race, in order to secure heavenly bliss for
his kinsmen.

<span id="fn_1104"></span>[177:3](htg28.htm#fr_1110.md) Hence the river is
called Jāhnavī. The verse speaks of the stages of the descent of the

special gift of the Devī. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇā says: "When You are
remembered in times of difficulty, You take away all fear of all
beings." She is *Bhayāpahā* (remover of fear); for Śruti says ("Tai Up."
ii. 9, 1): "By knowing the bliss of that Brahman none fear anything."

<span id="fn_1110"></span>[178:1](htg28.htm#fr_1116.md) That is, Viṣṇu, who

Holy Mother (*Śrīmātā*), the first of Her names.
