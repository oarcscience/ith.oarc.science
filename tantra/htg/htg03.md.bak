# HYMNS TO THE GODDESS

### INTRODUCTION

SANĀTANA BRAHMAN is called *sakala* when with *Prakṛti*, as It is
*niṣkala* when thought of as without *Prakṛti* (*prakṛteranya*), for
*kalā* is *Prakṛti*. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) To say, however,
that Śakti exists in or with, the Brahman is an accommodation to human
thought and speech, for the Brahman and Śakti are in fact one. Śakti is
eternal (*anādirūpā*), and *Brahmarūpā*, and both nirguṇā and
*saguṇā*. <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) She, the Goddess (*Devī*.md),
is the *caitanyarūpiṇi devī* who manifests all *bhūta*; the
*ānandarūpiṇi devī* by whom the Brahman, who She is, manifests
Itself, <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) and who, to use the words of
the Śāradātilaka, pervades the universe as does oil the sesamum seed.
"*Sa aikṣata*," of which *Śruti* speaks, was itself a manifestation of
Śakti, the *paramāpūrvanirvāṇaśakti*, or Brahman, as Śakti.

From the *paraśaktimaya* issued *nāda*, and from *nāda*, *bindu* <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md). The state of subtle body known as
*kāmakalā* is the *mūla* of *mantra*, and is meant when the Devī is
spoken

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

of as *mūlamantrātmikā*. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) The
*Parambindu* is represented as a circle the centre of which is the
*Brahmapada*, wherein are *Prakṛti-puruṣa*; the circumference of which
is encircling *māyā*. It is in the crescent of *nirvāṇakalā* the
seventeenth, which is again in that of *amākalā* the sixteenth, digit of
the moon circle (*candramaṇḍala*), situate above the sun-circle
(*sūryamaṇdala*), the *Guru* and the *Hamsah* in the pericarp of the
1,000 petalled lotus (*sahasrārapadma*). The *bindu* is symbolically
described as being like a grain of gram (*canaka*), which under its
encircling sheath contains a divided seed--*Prakṛti-puruṣa* or
*Śakti-Śiva*. <span id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md)

It is known as the Śabda Brahman. <span id="fr_6"></span>[3](#fn_6.md) A
polarization then takes place in *paraśaktimaya*. The Devī becomes
*unmukhi*. Her face is turned to Śiva. There is an unfolding which
bursts the encircling shell. <span id="fr_7"></span>[4](#fn_7.md) The
*devatāparaśaktimaya* exists in the threefold aspect of *bindu*, *bīja*,
and *nāda*, the last being in relation to the two former. An indistinct
sound then arises <span id="fr_8"></span>[5](#fn_8.md)
(*avyaktātmāravobhavat*). *Nāda*, as Rāghava Bhatta <span
id="fr_9"></span>[6](#fn_9.md) says, exists in three states, for in it are
the three *guṇas*. The Śabda Brahman manifests Itself in the threefold
energies, *Jnāna*, *Ichhā*, and *Kriyā Śakti*. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[7](#fn_10.md) For, as the Vāmakeśvara

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Tantra says, the
Devī Tripurā is threefold, as Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Īśa. Paraśiva exists as
a septenary under the forms of Śambhu, Śadāśiva, Īśāna, Rudra, Viṣṇu,
and Brahmā. The last five are the *Mahāpreta*, four of whom form the
support, and the fifth the seat, of the bed on which the Devī is united
with Paramaśiva in the room of *cintāmaṇi* stone on the jewelled island
clad with clumps of kadamba, and heavenly trees set in the ocean of
ambrosia. <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md)

*Śakti* is both *māyā* and *mūlaprakṛti*, whose substance is the three
*guṇas*, representing nature as the revelation of spirit (*sattva*);
nature as the passage of descent from spirit to matter, or of ascent
from matter to spirit (*rajas*), and nature as the dense veil of spirit
(*tamas*). The Devī is thus the treasure-house of *guṇas*
(*guṇanidhih*). <span id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12.md) *Mūlaprakṛti* is the
womb into which the Brahman casts the seed from which all things are
born. <span id="fr_13"></span>[3](#fn_13.md) The womb thrills to the
movement of the essentially active *rajoguṇa*, and the now unstable
*guṇas* in varied combinations under the illumination of Śiva (*cit*)
evolve the universe which is ruled by Maheśvara and Maheśvarī. The dual
principles of Śiva-Śakti, which are the product of the polarity
manifested in *Paraśaktimaya*, pervade the whole universe, and are
present in man in the *svayambhulinga* of the *mūlādhāra* and the Devī
Kuṇḍalinī, who in serpent form encircles it. The *Śabdabrahman* assumes
the form of the Devī Kuṇḍalinī, and as such is in the form of all
breathing creatures (*prāṇi*), and in the form of letters appears in
prose and verse. She is the luminous vital energy (*jīvaśakti*), which
manifests as *prāṇa*. Through the

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

various *prakṛta* and *vaikṛta* creations, issued the Devas, men,
animals, and the whole universe, which is the work and manifested form
of the Devī. For, as the Kubjikā Tantra says, "Not Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and
Rudra create, maintain, and destroy, but Brāhmī, Vaiṣṇavī, Rudrāṇī.
Their husbands are but as dead bodies."

The Goddess (*Devī*) is the great Śakti. She is *māyā*, for of Her the
*māyā* which produces the *samsāra* is. As Lord of *māyā*, She is
Mahāmāyā. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) Devī is *avidyā*
(nescience), because She binds; and *vidyā* (knowledge), because She
liberates and destroys the *samsāra*. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md) She is Prakṛti, <span
id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md) and, as existing before creation, She is
the *ādya* (primordial) śakti. She is the *vācaka-śakti*, the
manifestation of *cit* in Prakṛti; and the *vācya śakti* or *cit*
itself. The *ātmā* should be contemplated as Devī. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[4](#fn_17.md)

Śakti or Devī is thus the Brahman revealed in its Mother aspect
(*srīmātā*) <span id="fr_18"></span>[5](#fn_18.md) as creatrix and
nourisher of the worlds. Kālī says of Herself in Yoginī Tantra: <span
id="fr_19"></span>[6](#fn_19.md) "*Saccidānandarupāham Brahmaivāham
sphuratprabham*." So the Devī is described with attributes both of the
qualified <span id="fr_20"></span>[7](#fn_20.md) Brahman, and (since that
Brahman is but the manifestation of the Absolute), She is also addressed

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

with epithets which denote the unconditioned Brahman. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21) She is the great Mother (*ambikā*.md) sprung
from the sacrificial hearth of the fire of the Grand Consciousness
(*cit*) decked with the Sun and Moon; Lalitā--"She who plays"--whose
play is world-play; whose eyes, playing like fish in the beauteous
waters of Her Divine face, open and shut with the appearance and
disappearance of countless worlds, now illuminated by Her light, now
wrapped in her terrible darkness. <span id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md)
For Devī, who issues from the great Abyss, is terrible also in Her Kālī,
Tārā, Chinnamastā, and other forms. Śāktas hold that a sweet and
complete resignation of the self to such forms of the Divine Power
denotes a higher stage of spiritual development. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[3](#fn_23.md) Such dualistic worship also speedily bears
the fruit of knowledge of the Universal Unity, the realization of which
dispels all fear. For the Mother is only terrible to those who, living
in the illusion of separateness (which is the cause of all fear), have
not yet realized their unity with Her, and known that all Her forms are
those of beauty.

The Devī as Parabrahman is beyond all form and *guṇa*. The forms of the
Mother of the universe are threefold. There is first the Supreme
(*para*) form, of

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

which, as the Viṣṇu Yāmala <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) says,
"none know." There is next Her subtle (*sūkṣma*) form, which consists of
*mantra*. But, as the mind cannot easily settle itself upon that which
is formless, <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md) She appears as the
subject of contemplation in Her third or gross (*sthūla*) or physical
form, with hands and feet and the like, as celebrated in the
*Devīstotra* of the Purāṇas and Tantras. Devī, who as *Prakṛti* is the
source of Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Maheśvara, <span
id="fr_26"></span>[3](#fn_26.md) has both male and female forms. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[4](#fn_27.md) But it is in Her female forms that she is
chiefly contemplated. For, though existing in all things, in a peculiar
sense female beings are parts of Her. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[5](#fn_28.md) The Great Mother, who exists in the form
of all Tantras and all Yantras, <span id="fr_29"></span>[6](#fn_29.md) is,
as the Lalitā says, the "unsullied treasure-house of beauty," the
sapphire Devī <span id="fr_30"></span>[7](#fn_30.md) whose slender

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

waist, <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) bending beneath the burden of
the ripe fruit of her breasts, <span id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md)
swells into jewelled hips heavy <span id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33.md) with
the promise of infinite maternities <span id="fr_34"></span>[4](#fn_34.md).
Her litanies depict Her physical form from head to foot, celebrating Her
hair adorned with flowers and crowned with gems; Her brow bright as the
eighth-day moon; Her ruby cheeks and coral lips; teeth like to "the buds
of the sixteen-syllabled *mantra*," and eyebrows curved as are the
arches at the gate of the palace of Kāmarāja; Her nose; Her teeth; Her
chin; Her arms; and "Her twin breasts offered in return for that
priceless gem which is the love of Kāmeśvara"; Her waist girdled with
jewelled bells; Her smooth and faultless limbs rounded beneath the
"jewelled disc of the knee like the

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

sapphire-studded quiver of the God of Love" descending in lines of grace
to Her bright louts feet, <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) which
dispel the darkness of Her worshippers. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_36.md) For moonlight is She, yet sunbeam,
soothing all those who are burnt by the triple fires of misery
(*tāpatraya*). Her face, Her body from throat to waist, and thence
downwards, represent the *vāgbhava* and other *kūta*. The colour of the
Devī varies according to the form under which She is contemplated. Thus,
in conferring liberation, She is white; as controller of women, men, and
kings, She is red; and as controller of wealth, saffron. As creatrix of
enmity, She becomes tawny; and in the thrill of love, passion
(*śṛngāra*), She is of the colour of the rose. In the action of slaying
She becomes black. Thus, Devī, the Supreme Light, is to be meditated
upon as differently coloured according to Her different
activities. <span id="fr_37"></span>[3](#fn_37.md)

After the description of the form of the Devī in *brahmāṇḍa* follows
that of Her subtle form, called Kuṇḍalinī in the body (*piṇḍāṇḍa*). As
the Mahādevī <span id="fr_38"></span>[4](#fn_38.md) She exists in all forms
as Śarasvatī, Lakṣmī, Gāyatrī,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Durgā,
Tripurasundarī, Annapurṇā, and all the Devī who are *avatāra* of the
Brahman. <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md)

Devī, as Satī, Umā, Pārvatī, and Gourī, is spouse of Śiva. It was as
Satī, prior to Dakṣa's sacrifice (*dakṣayajna*) that the Devī manifested
Herself to Śiva <span id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40.md) in the ten
celebrated forms known as the *daśamahāvidyā*--Kālī, Bagala,
Chinnamastā, Bhuvaneshvarī, Mātanginī, Shorosi, Dhumāvati,
Tripurasundarī, Tārā, and Bhairavī. When at the *dakṣayajna* She yielded
up Her life in shame and sorrow at the treatment accorded by Her father
to Her husband, Śiva took away the body, and, ever bearing it with him,
remained wholly distraught and spent with grief. To save the world from
the forces of evil which arose and grew with the withdrawal of His
divine control, Viṣṇu, with his discus (*cakra*), cut the dead body of
Satī, which Śiva bore, into fifty-one fragments, which fell to earth at
the places thereafter known as the fifty-one <span
id="fr_41"></span>[3](#fn_41.md) *mahāpīthasthānas*, where Devī, with her
Bhairava, is worshipped under various names.

Thus the right and left breasts fell at Jalandhara and Ramgiri, where
the Devī is worshipped as Tripuramālinī; the *yoni* at the celebrated
shrine at Kamrup in Assam, where the Devī is worshipped as Kāmākṣā or
Kāmākhyā (see *ibid*.); <span id="fr_42"></span>[4](#fn_42.md) the throat,
shoulders, nose, hands,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

arms, eyes, fingers, tongue, buttocks, lips, belly, chin, navel, cheeks,
thighs, teeth, feet, ears, thumbs, heels, toes (some at Kālīghat),
waist, hair, forehead, with skeleton (several of these parts being
themselves divided), fell at other *pītha*, at each of which the Devī is
worshipped under different names in company with a Bhairava or Śiva,
also variously named. Thus, the Devī at Kālīghat is Kālikā, and the Śiva
Nakuleśvara, and the Devī at Kamrup is Kāmākshā, and Her Bhairava is
Ramānanda.

These are but some only of Her endless forms. She is seen as one and as
many: as it were, but one moon reflected in countless waters. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md) She exists, too, in all animals and
inorganic things, since the universe, with all its beauties, is, as the
Devī Purāṇa says, but a part of Her. All this diversity of form is but
the infinite manifestations of the flowering beauty of the one Supreme
Life--a doctrine which is nowhere else taught with greater wealth of
illustration than in the Śākta Śāstras and Tantras. The great Bharga in
the bright sun, and all Devatā, and, indeed, all life and being are
worshipful, and are worshipped, but only as Her manifestations. <span
id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md) And he who worships them otherwise is, in
the words of the great Devībhāgavata, <span
id="fr_45"></span>[3](#fn_45.md) "like unto a man who, with the light of a
clear lamp

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

in his hands, yet falls into some waterless and terrible well." It is
customary nowadays to decry external worship, but those who do so
presume too much. The ladder of ascent can only be scaled by those who
have trod all, including its lowest, rungs. The Śaktirahasya summarises
the stages of progress in a short verse, thus: "A mortal who worships by
ceremonies, by images, by mind, by identification, by knowing the self,
attains *kaivalya*." Before *brahma-bhāva* can be attained the *sādhaka*
must have passed from *pūjābhāva* through hymns and prayer to
*dhyāna-bhāva*. The highest worship <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md)
for which the *sādhaka* is qualified (*adhikāri*) only after external
worship, and that internal form known as *sādhāra* <span
id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md) is described as *nirādhāra*. Therein Pure
Intelligence is the Supreme Śakti who is worshipped as the Very Self,
the Witness freed of the glamour of the manifold universe. By one's own
direct experience of Maheśvarī as the Self, She is, with reverence, made
the object of that worship which leads to liberation.

"Though the Mother beat him, the child cries 'Mother! O Mother!' and
clings still tighter to her garment. True, I cannot see Thee, yet am I
not a lost child. I still cry 'Mother!'

<span id="fn_24"></span>[6:1](htg03.htm#fr_24.md) *Mātastvatparamamrūpam

<span id="fn_26"></span>[6:3](htg03.htm#fr_26.md) *Ibid*., and as such is
called Tripurā (see Bhāskararāyā's Commentary on Lalitā, verse 125).

<span id="fn_27"></span>[6:4](htg03.htm#fr_27.md) *Ibid*., chap. iii.,
which also says that there is no eunuch form of God.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[6:5](htg03.htm#fr_28.md) So in Candi (Mārkaṇḍeya
Purāṇa) it is said:

"*Vidyāh samastāstava devī bhedāh,  
Stryah samastāsakalā jagatsu*."

The Tāntrika, more than all men, recognizes the divinity of woman, as
was observed centuries past by the author of the Dabistan. The Linga
Purāṇa also, after describing Arundhati, Anasūyā and Shachi to be each
the manifestation of Devī, concludes: "All things indicated by words in
the feminine gender are manifestations of Devī."
[Similarly](errata.htm#1.md) the Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[6:6](htg03.htm#fr_29.md) *Sarvatantrarūpā
Sarvayantrātmīkā* (See Lalitā, verse 53).

<span id="fn_30"></span>[6:7](htg03.htm#fr_30.md) Padma Purāṇa says: "Viṣṇu
ever worships the sapphire Devī."

<span id="fn_31"></span>[7:1](htg03.htm#fr_31.md)
*Ājnvarastanatatimtanuvrittamadhyām* (Bhuvaneśvarīstotra), *tanumadhya*
(Lalitā, verse 79). *krishodari* (Ādyakālisvarūpāstotra, Mahānirvāṇa
Tantra, 7th Ullāsa).

<span id="fn_32"></span>[7:2](htg03.htm#fr_32.md) *Stotra* and *dhyāna*
commonly represent Her as having large, full, and erect
breasts--*pīnastanādye* (in Karpurādistotra), *pinonnatapayodharām*) (in
Durgā-dhyāna of Devī Purāṇa), *bakshojakumbhāntari* (in Annapurṇāstava)
*āpivarastanatatim* (in Bhuvaneśvarīstotra)--which weight her
limbs--*kuchabharanamitāngīm* (in Sarasvatidhyāna),
*annapradānaniratāngstanabhāranamrām* (in Annapūrṇastava). And the
Lalitā, verse 15, says: "Her golden girdle supports Her waist, which
bends under the burden of Her breasts, thrice folding the skin below Her
bosom" (*trivalīvalayopetām*).

<span id="fn_33"></span>[7:3](htg03.htm#fr_33.md) So it is said in the
tenth *śloka* of the Karpūrākhyastava
*samantādāpīnastanajaghanadhrikyauvanavatī*. Śankarācarya, in his
Tripurāsundarīstotra, speaks of Her *nitaniba* (buttocks) "as excelling
the mountain in greatness" (*nitambajitabhūdharām*). The Javanese also
call Her Loro Jongram, "The pure exalted virgin with beautiful hips."

<span id="fn_34"></span>[7:4](htg03.htm#fr_34.md) The physical
characteristics of the Devī in Her swelling breasts and hips are
emblematic of Her great Motherhood, for She is *Śrimātā*.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[8:1](htg03.htm#fr_35.md) See the
Lalitāsahasranāma, verse 4 *et seq*. "Her brow
(*aṣṭamīcandravibhrājadalika sthala śobhitā*), Her eyebrow
(*vadanasamara māngalyagrihatoranacillika*), Her twin breasts
(*kāmeśvarapremaratnamani pratiphalastani*), Her waist
(*ratnakinkinikārabhyarashanādāma bhūṣitā*), "Her thighs, known only to
Kameśa" (*Kāmeśajnātasaubhāgya mardavorudvayānvitā*), Her lower limbs
(*indragopa parikṣipta smaratunā bhajandhikā*); Her instep 'arched like
the back of a tortoise,' the bright rays from her nails and the soles of
Her feet in beauty shaming the lotus."

<span id="fn_36"></span>[8:2](htg03.htm#fr_36.md) From the beautiful litany
to the Devī in the Lalitāsahasranāma.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[8:3](htg03.htm#fr_37.md) Bhāskararāya's Commentary
on Lalitā, verse 170.
