### BHUVANEŚVARI <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_131)

### FROM THE TANTRASĀRA <span id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_132)

1

Now I pray for the attainment of all blessings to Bhuvaneśvarī,  
The cause and Mother <span id="fr_133"></span>[3](#fn_133) of the
world,  
She whose form is that of the Śabdabrahman, <span
id="fr_134"></span>[4](#fn_134)  
And whose substance is bliss.

2

Thou art the primordial One, <span id="fr_135"></span>[5](#fn_135)  
Mother of countless creatures,  
Creatrix of the bodies <span id="fr_136"></span>[6](#fn_136) of the
lotus-born, <span id="fr_137"></span>[7](#fn_137) Viṣṇu and Śiva.  
Who creates, preserves, and destroys the three worlds.  
O Mother! by hymning Thy praise I purify my speech.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

3

O Daughter of the Mountain-King, <span id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_138)  
Thou art the cause of the world-destroying energy of Śiva, <span
id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_139)  
Who manifests in earth, water, fire, ether, the sacrificer, the sun and
moon, <span id="fr_140"></span>[3](#fn_140)  
And who destroyed the body of Manmatha. <span
id="fr_141"></span>[4](#fn_141)

4

O Mother! men only worship the triple-streamed Gangā <span
id="fr_142"></span>[5](#fn_142)  
Because She shines in the matted hair of Śiva, <span
id="fr_143"></span>[6](#fn_143)  
Which has been purified  
By the dust of Thy lotus feet.

5

As the moon <span id="fr_144"></span>[7](#fn_144) delights the white
night lotus <span id="fr_145"></span>[8](#fn_145) and none other,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

As the sun delights the day lotus <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146)
and none other,  
As one particular thing only delights one other,  
Thou, O Mother! delightest the whole universe by Thy glances.

6

Although Thou art the primordial cause of the world,  
Yet art Thou ever youthful;  
Although Thou art the Daughter of the Mountain-King, <span
id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_147)  
Yet art Thou full of tenderness.  
Although Thou art the Mother of the Vedas, <span
id="fr_148"></span>[3](#fn_148)  
Yet they cannot describe Thee. <span id="fr_149"></span>[4](#fn_149)  
Although men must meditate upon Thee,  
Yet cannot their mind comprehend Thee. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[5](#fn_150)

7

O Mother of the worlds!  
Those who have reached that birth amongst men  
Which if so difficult to attain,  
And in that birth their full faculties,  
Yet nathless do not worship Thee,

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

Such, though having ascended to the top of the stairs,  
Nevertheless fall down again. <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151)

8

O Bhavānī!  
Such as worship Thee with fragrant flowers and sandal paste,  
Ground with cool water <span id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152) and
powdered camphor,  
Gain the sovereignty of the whole world.

9

O Mother! like the sleeping King of serpents, <span
id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153)  
Residing in the centre of the first lotus, <span
id="fr_154"></span>[4](#fn_154)  
Thou didst create the universe.  
Thou dost ascend like a streak of lightning, <span
id="fr_155"></span>[5](#fn_155)  
And attainest the ethereal region. <span id="fr_156"></span>[6](#fn_156)

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

10

Thy body, having been moistened with the nectar flowing from That, <span
id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157)  
Thou dost again reach Thy abode <span id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_158) by
that way. <span id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_159)  
O Mother and Spouse of Maheśvara!  
They in whose heart Thou glitterest are never reborn.

11

O Gaurī! with all my heart  
I contemplate Thy form,  
Beauteous of face,  
With its weight of hanging hair,  
With full breasts <span id="fr_160"></span>[4](#fn_160) and rounded
slender waist, <span id="fr_161"></span>[5](#fn_161)  
Holding in three hands a rosary, <span id="fr_162"></span>[6](#fn_162) a
pitcher, <span id="fr_163"></span>[7](#fn_163) and a book,  
And with Thy fourth hand making the *jnānamudrā*. <span
id="fr_164"></span>[8](#fn_164)

12

O Bhuvaneśvarī  
*Yogis* who have restrained their senses  
And have conquered the six enemies, <span
id="fr_165"></span>[9](#fn_165)  
In *yoga* with calm minds behold Thee  
Holding noose and a goad,

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

And making the *vara* and *abhaya mudrās*. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166)

13

Thou art Lakṣmī,  
Rivalling the lustre of molten gold,  
Holding two lotuses in two of Thy hands,  
And with the other two making the gestures which grant boons and dispel
fear. <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_167)  
Four elephants holding jars (in their trunks),  
Sprinkle Thy head with nectar. <span id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_168)

14

O Bhavānī! Thou art Durgā, <span id="fr_169"></span>[4](#fn_169) seated
on a lion,  
Of the colour of *durvā* grass, <span id="fr_170"></span>[5](#fn_170)

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

Holding in Thy eight hands various kinds of dreadful weapons,  
And destroying the enemies of the immortals. <span
id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_171)

15

I remember again and again the dark <span
id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_172) primeval Devī <span
id="fr_173"></span>[3](#fn_173) swayed with passion, <span
id="fr_174"></span>[4](#fn_174)  
Her beauteous face heated and moist with the sweat (of amorous
play), <span id="fr_175"></span>[5](#fn_175)  
Bearing a necklace of *Ganjā* berries, <span
id="fr_176"></span>[6](#fn_176) and clad with leaves.

16

O Spouse of Śrīkaṇṭha, <span id="fr_177"></span>[7](#fn_177)  
I place on my head Thy blue lotus feet,  
Which are followed by <span id="fr_178"></span>[8](#fn_178) the Vedas,

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

As swans are lured by the tinkling sound of an anklet.

17

O Bhavānī! I worship thy body from ankle to knee, <span
id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_179)  
Upon which the bull-bannered one <span id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_180)
gazes with great love,  
And who, as if not satiated by looking thereon with two eyes,  
Has yet made for himself a third. <span id="fr_181"></span>[3](#fn_181)

18

I call to mind thy two thighs, <span id="fr_182"></span>[4](#fn_182)  
Which humble the pride of the trunk of an elephant,  
And surpass the plantain-tree in thickness and tenderness. <span
id="fr_183"></span>[5](#fn_183)  
O Mother! youth <span id="fr_184"></span>[6](#fn_184) fashioned those
thighs  
That they may support as two pillars the weight of thy (great)
hips, <span id="fr_185"></span>[7](#fn_185)

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

19

Looking at thy waist, <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186) it would
seem as if it had been absorbed  
And become the great bulk of thy breasts and hips. <span
id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_187)  
By the youth <span id="fr_188"></span>[3](#fn_188) which clothes the
body with hair, <span id="fr_189"></span>[4](#fn_189)  
May it ever be resplendent in my heart!

20

O Devī! may I never forget thy navel, <span
id="fr_190"></span>[5](#fn_190)  
As it were a secure inviolate pool, <span
id="fr_191"></span>[6](#fn_191)  
Given to Thee by Thy blooming youth,  
Filled with the liquid beauty <span id="fr_192"></span>[7](#fn_192) of
the beloved of Smara, <span id="fr_193"></span>[8](#fn_193)

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

He who was fearful of the fire from the eyes of Hara. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_194)

21

Thy two lotus-like breasts, smeared with sandal,  
Which bear ashes telling of Śiva's embrace, <span
id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_195)  
Call to mind the vermilion-painted temples moist with ichor <span
id="fr_196"></span>[3](#fn_196)  
Of some (impassioned) elephant  
Rising from his bath in waters,  
Flicked with foam. <span id="fr_197"></span>[4](#fn_197)

22

O Mother! Thy two arms, beauteous with the water  
Dripping from Thy body bathed from neck to throat,  
Seem to have been formed by the crocodile-bannered One, <span
id="fr_198"></span>[5](#fn_198)  
As long nooses wherewith to hold the throat of his enemy <span
id="fr_199"></span>[6](#fn_199) (Śiva).

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

May I never forget them!

23

O Daughter of the Mountain-King,  
Again and again have I looked upon Thy shapely neck,  
Which has stolen the beauty of a well-formed shell,  
And is adorning with pleasing necklace and many another ornament;  
Yet am I never satiated.

24

O Mother! he has not been born in vain <span
id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_200)  
Who oft calls to his mind  
Thy face, with its large round eyes and noble brow,  
Its radiant cheeks and smile,  
The high, straight nose,  
And lips red as the *bimba* fruit. <span id="fr_201"></span>[2](#fn_201)

25

Whoever, O Devī! contemplates upon Thy wealth of hair,  
Lit by the crescent moon, <span id="fr_202"></span>[3](#fn_202)  
Resembling a swarm of bees hovering over fragrant flowers,  
Is freed of the ancient fetters which bind him to the world. <span
id="fr_203"></span>[4](#fn_203)

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

26

The mortal who in this world  
Devoutly from his heart reads this hymn,  
Sweet to the ears of the wise,  
Attains for ever all wealth in the form of that Lakṣmī  
Who attends the crowned kings who are prostrate at Her feet.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_131"></span>[31:1](htg08.htm#fr_131) The Devī in her aspect
as Lord and Ruler of the world.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[31:2](htg08.htm#fr_132) P. 567.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[31:3](htg08.htm#fr_133) *Ambikā*.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[31:4](htg08.htm#fr_134)
Sākṣātsabdabrahmasvarūpiṇī: the "sound" or manifested Aparabrahman, as
opposed to the absolute, the Parabrahman. The Devī and the Śabdabrahman
are, in fact, one, though men speak of Her as His Śakti (power).

<span id="fn_135"></span>[31:5](htg08.htm#fr_135) Ādyā.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[31:6](htg08.htm#fr_136) *Vapuhpratipādayitrī*.
The Devas have bodies, subtle though they be, as the Śabdabrahman
Himself has.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[31:7](htg08.htm#fr_137) Brahmā.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[32:1](htg08.htm#fr_138) Himavat, whose
daughter, as Pārvatī, the Devī was.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[32:2](htg08.htm#fr_139) For they derive their
power from the Devī, the All-Mother, whose children they are, and who
also manifests as their Spouse.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[32:3](htg08.htm#fr_140) These constitute the
eight-fold forms (*aṣṭamūrti*) of Śiva, viz, Sarva, Bhava, Rudra,
Ugraha, Bhīma, Paśupati, Īśāna, Mahādeva.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[32:4](htg08.htm#fr_141) The Deva of Love.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[32:5](htg08.htm#fr_142) *Trisrotah*, for there
are three Ganges: the heavenly (Mandākinī), earthly (Alakanandā), and
that of the nether world (Bhogavatī).

<span id="fn_143"></span>[32:6](htg08.htm#fr_143) As to the descent of
Gangā into the *jaṭa* of Śiva (see Hymn to Gangā, *post*).

<span id="fn_144"></span>[32:7](htg08.htm#fr_144) Literally Lord of
*Kalā*. *Kalā* is a digit of which there arc sixteen in the moon. The
*amākatā* is that from which the nectar is distilled.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[32:8](htg08.htm#fr_145) *Kumudinī*, which
blooms and opens at night.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[33:1](htg08.htm#fr_146) *Kamalinī*.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[33:2](htg08.htm#fr_147) Mountain (*Śaila*),
which is that which is made of masses of stone (*Śilā*)--a rhetorical
comparison between the hardness of stone and Her tenderness.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[33:3](htg08.htm#fr_148) *Trayā*. The whole
Veda is so called because it consists of song, prose, and verse; or
because the Rik, Yajus, and Sāma are alone referred to as Veda.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[33:4](htg08.htm#fr_149) Cf. verse 2 of
Mahimnastava of *Puṣpadanta*.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[33:5](htg08.htm#fr_150) Literally, "Though
thou art to be meditated upon, thou dost not stay in the path of mind"
(*cf*. Mahimnastava, *loc. cit*, and Śruti, which says, "Yato vāco
nivarttante aprāpya manasā saha.")

<span id="fn_151"></span>[34:1](htg08.htm#fr_151) That is, as the
subsequent fall makes the ascent useless, so human incarnation is
without avail for those who, without excuse in such incarnation, do not
worship the Devī.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[34:2](htg08.htm#fr_152) Kālidāsa in the
Ritusamhāra says that in the hot weather women should wear fine cloth,
powder their hair with fragrant scent, and smear their breasts with
sandal, ground with cool water.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[34:3](htg08.htm#fr_153) She as Kuṇḍalinī
resembles a sleeping serpent with three and a half coils abiding in the
*mūlādhāra*.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[34:4](htg08.htm#fr_154) The *Mūlādhāra cakra*
(see last note).

<span id="fn_155"></span>[34:5](htg08.htm#fr_155) *Vidyullatā balaya
vibhramamudvahanti*. This is the sense of the passage which may
literally mean that the Devī carries the beauty (*vibrahma*) of
wristlets, like a streak of lightning, or "the Devī is sporting like a
streak of lightning."

<span id="fn_156"></span>[34:6](htg08.htm#fr_156) *Khamasnuvānā*. Kham
is here Śiva in the *Sahasrāra*, whither the Devī repairs when Her
passion is aroused by the lightning of the *Kāmāgni* around Her fanned
by the leftward revolution of the red *Kandarpavayu*.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[35:1](htg08.htm#fr_157) That is the
*Sahasrārapadma*.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[35:2](htg08.htm#fr_158) *Mūlādhāra*.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[35:3](htg08.htm#fr_159) *Margenātena*--that
is, the *nādī suṣumnā*.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[35:4](htg08.htm#fr_160) *Apīvarastanatatīm*.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[35:5](htg08.htm#fr_161) *Tanuvrittamadhyām*.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[35:6](htg08.htm#fr_162) *Japamāla*, with which
*japa* or recitation of *mantra* is done.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[35:7](htg08.htm#fr_163) *Kalaśa*.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[35:8](htg08.htm#fr_164) Literally, holding
*cintā*, which is a name for the *jñāna mudrā*, or manual gesture so
called.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[35:9](htg08.htm#fr_165) The six sins (see [p.
27](htg07.htm#page_27), n. 3).

<span id="fn_166"></span>[36:1](htg08.htm#fr_166) That is, the gestures
(*Mudrā*) which grant boons and dispel fear. In the first the hand is
held horizontally, the palm open, the fingers close to each other, and
the thumb across the palm and touching the root of the third finger. The
second is the same, but the hand is held upwards vertically, the palm
being shown to the spectator.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[36:2](htg08.htm#fr_167) That is, the *vara*
and *abhayamudrās*, *ante*.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[36:3](htg08.htm#fr_168) In this form the Devī
is [represented](errata.htm#4) as being surrounded by four elephants,
which pour nectar over 'her from jars held in their trunks.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[36:4](htg08.htm#fr_169) One of the names of
Bhuvaneśvarī (see p. 171 of Prosanna Kumar Shastri's "Daśamahāvidyā").

<span id="fn_170"></span>[36:5](htg08.htm#fr_170) Of a dark green. It is
not clear why this colour is here mentioned, as the colour of Durgā is a
golden yellow. It is, however, the colour of other forms, which are
those of the one and the same Devī. Thus the colour of Kālī is that of
*anjana* (black, collyrium), Tārā is *nīlā* (dark blue), Mātanginī is
*asitā* (black) or *shyāmāngī* (dark green). The hue of Shodashī (Śrī)
is that of the rising sun (*bālārkākanti*), at it is that of
Bhuvaneśvarī (uddaddinakaradyuti). The colour of Bhairavī is said to be
that of a thousand rising suns; of Chinnamastā that of a million suns;
<span id="page_37">p. 37</span> Dhūmāvati is of an ashen colour
(*vivarnā*); Bagalāmukhī is all yellow (*pītavarṇā*), and Kamalā is said
to be like lightning (*saudāminisannibhā*)--see Prosanna Kumar Shastri's
"Daśamahāvidyā".

<span id="fn_171"></span>[37:1](htg08.htm#fr_171) The Daityas, enemies
of the Devas, whose Protectress the Devī is.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[37:2](htg08.htm#fr_172) *Asitakānti*. It is
difficult to arrive at English translations for some Sanskrit words of
colour. Mātanginī here referred to is also spoken of as *shyāmāngī* or
dark green; and dark green and dark-blue seem also to be used
interchangeably.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[37:3](htg08.htm#fr_173) *Mātanginī*, one of
the *Daśamahāvidyā*.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[37:4](htg08.htm#fr_174)
*Anangatantrām*--influenced or swayed by Ananga ("the bodiless one"), a
name of the Hindu God of Love, Kāma.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[37:5](htg08.htm#fr_175) *Avirnidāsha
jalashikharashobhivaktrām*. The cause is shown in the preceding
line--play and union with her Lord.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[37:6](htg08.htm#fr_176) Red and black berries
used as goldsmiths' weights.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[37:7](htg08.htm#fr_177) Śiva, the "beautiful
throated," also called Shitikaṇṭha ("peacock-throated"), from the
colouring caused by His drinking the venom which arose at the churning
of the ocean.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[37:8](htg08.htm#fr_178) *Anugamyamānau*--that
is, the Vedas worship and adore Her.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[38:1](htg08.htm#fr_179) *Janghā*. *cf*.
Lalitāsahasranāma, verse 18, where the Devī's calves are compared to
"the sapphire-studded quiver of the God of Love, with rounded ankles and
instep arched like the back of a tortoise."

<span id="fn_180"></span>[38:2](htg08.htm#fr_180) Śiva, also called
*Vriṣaddhvaja*.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[38:3](htg08.htm#fr_181) Śiva is always
represented with three eyes, the third being the eye of wisdom, which in
man opens on the realization of divinity.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[38:4](htg08.htm#fr_182) *Uru* (*cf*.
Lalitāsahasranāma, verse 17. "The symmetry and smoothness of Her thighs
are known only to Kāmeśa (Śiva). Her knees shine like jewelled discs."

<span id="fn_183"></span>[38:5](htg08.htm#fr_183) Cf. First Canto of
Kālidāsa's Kumāra Sambhavam.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[38:6](htg08.htm#fr_184) *Madhyamenabayasā*.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[38:7](htg08.htm#fr_185) *Shroni*.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[39:1](htg08.htm#fr_186) *Murtirmadhyastava*.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[39:2](htg08.htm#fr_187)
*Shronyaustanauchayugapat prathayishyatochchairbālyāt parena bayasā
parihristasārah*--that is, the waist is so slender and the breasts and
hips so heavy that it would seem that the greater part of the body,
which goes to the making of the waist, had been taken away and put into
the breasts and hips, and formed their bulk.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[39:3](htg08.htm#fr_188) *Bālyātparenabayasā*.
Literally the age which follows childhood, which is the cause of these
changes in woman's body.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[39:4](htg08.htm#fr_189) *Romāvalivilāsitena*,
which appears with puberty (*cf*. verse 15 of the Lalitā).

<span id="fn_190"></span>[39:5](htg08.htm#fr_190) *Nābhi*, which also
means any navel-like cavity.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[39:6](htg08.htm#fr_191)
*Pallalamapradhriśyam*--from all but Śiva: a similar idea to that of
verse 17 of the Lalitā, where it is said that the beauty of the Devī's
thighs are known only to Her Lord Kāmeśa (Śiva).

<span id="fn_192"></span>[39:7](htg08.htm#fr_192)
*Lāvanyavāribharitāng*.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[39:8](htg08.htm#fr_193) That is, Rati, Spouse
of Kāma or Smara, the God of Love, son of Kṛṣṇa and Rukminī. The son of
Kāma is Aniruddha, and his companion is Vasanta, the spring. He is armed
with a bow-and-arrows, the bow string being a line of bees, and the
arrows flowers of different plants.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[40:1](htg08.htm#fr_194) When the Devas desired
a commander for their forces in their war with Tāraka, they sought the
aid of Kāma in drawing Śiva towards Pārvatī, whose issue alone could
destroy the demon. Kāma undertook the mission, and shot his arrows of
love at Śiva, when the latter was doing *tapas*. Śiva, however, who was
offended at this disturbance of his devotions, burnt Kāma down with a
flash from the fire of His third eye. Subsequently Kāma was reborn in
the form of Pradyumna at the request of Rati.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[40:2](htg08.htm#fr_195) For Śiva's body is
covered with ashes.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[40:3](htg08.htm#fr_196) *Samadasyakumbhau*,
the ichor which exudes from the temples of elephants in rut.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[40:4](htg08.htm#fr_197) The ashes are thus
compared to foam, and the sandal paste to the vermilion with which the
temples and foreheads of fine elephants are painted.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[40:5](htg08.htm#fr_198) That is, Kāma, the God
of Love.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[40:6](htg08.htm#fr_199) For Śiva burnt him
(see *ante* n. 5). The Devī's arms embrace the neck of Śiva.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[41:1](htg08.htm#fr_200) *Sa eva jātah*.
Literally, "He is indeed born." His birth is fruitful.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[41:2](htg08.htm#fr_201) The fruit of the tree
called *tyālākucho* in Bengali, which, when ripe, is very red, and to
which the lips of young women are often compared (*cf*. Meghadūta, verse
2, "*Pakvabimbādharoṣthī*").

<span id="fn_202"></span>[41:3](htg08.htm#fr_202) The Devī bears the
crescent moon on her head as does Śiva.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[41:4](htg08.htm#fr_203) *Tasya svayam galati
Devī purāṇapāshā*--that is, he is freed of rebirth, the fruit of
*Karma*. Here commences the *phala* (fruit or result portion) of the
*stotra*.
