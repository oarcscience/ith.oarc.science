### CAṆḌIKĀ

### FROM THE FOURTH OR SHAKRĀDI <span id="fr_720"></span>[1](#fn_718.md) MAHĀTMYA OF CAṆḌĪ

### (MĀRKANDEYA PURĀNA)

1

May that Devī by whose power this world was spread,  
The perfect form of the powers of countless Devas, <span
id="fr_721"></span>[2](#fn_719.md)  
The Mother <span id="fr_722"></span>[3](#fn_720.md) worshipped by Devas and
Mahaṛṣis, <span id="fr_723"></span>[4](#fn_721.md)  
Do good to us.

2

May that Caṇḍikā whose peerless majesty and power  
Neither Bhagavān Ananta, <span id="fr_724"></span>[5](#fn_722.md) Brahmā,
nor Hara <span id="fr_725"></span>[6](#fn_723.md) can declare,  
Turn Herself towards us for the destruction of the fear of evil,  
And the protection of the whole world.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

3

We bow to Her who is good fortune itself in the dwellings of the
virtuous,  
Ill-fortune in those of the sinful,  
Reason <span id="fr_726"></span>[1](#fn_724.md) in the hearts of the
intelligent, faith in those of the good,  
Modesty in that of the high born.  
Protect, O Devī! this universe.

4

How can we describe Thy thought-transcending form,  
Or, Thy greatly abounding strength which destroyed the Asuras, <span
id="fr_727"></span>[2](#fn_725.md)  
Or, O Devī! those great deeds of Thine  
Done in battle midst hosts of Devas, Asuras, and others?

5

Thou art the cause of all the worlds,  
Though Thy substance is the three *guṇas*, <span
id="fr_728"></span>[3](#fn_726.md)  
Yet is no fault known in thee. <span id="fr_729"></span>[4](#fn_727.md)  
Incomprehensible art Thou even to Hari, Hara, <span
id="fr_730"></span>[5](#fn_728.md) and other Devas, <span
id="fr_731"></span>[6](#fn_729.md)

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

Thou art the refuge of all.  
The whole world is but a part of Thee, <span
id="fr_732"></span>[1](#fn_730.md)  
Unmanifested, <span id="fr_733"></span>[2](#fn_731.md) primeval, supreme
Prakṛti. <span id="fr_734"></span>[3](#fn_732.md)

6

O Devī! Thou art *Svāhā*, <span id="fr_735"></span>[4](#fn_733.md)  
By the utterance whereof all Devas in all sacrifices are satisfied.  
Thou art also declared by men to be *Svadhā*, <span
id="fr_736"></span>[4](#fn_733.md)  
Which satisfies the *pitṛs* <span id="fr_737"></span>[5](#fn_734.md).

7

Thou, O Devī! whose great *vrata* <span id="fr_738"></span>[6](#fn_735.md)
surpasses all thought,  
Art the supreme knowledge full of power  
Which is the cause of liberation  
Ever sought to be gained by those *Munis* <span
id="fr_739"></span>[7](#fn_736.md) desirous thereof,  
Who have strictly controlled their senses and are free of all
faults. <span id="fr_740"></span>[8](#fn_737.md)

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

8

Thou art in the form of sound.  
The repository of spotless <span id="fr_741"></span>[1](#fn_738.md)
Ṛg <span id="fr_742"></span>[2](#fn_739.md) and Yajus <span
id="fr_743"></span>[2](#fn_739.md) hymns,  
And of the Sāman <span id="fr_744"></span>[2](#fn_739.md) hymns wherein are
the verses of the charmful *Udgītha*, <span
id="fr_745"></span>[3](#fn_740.md)  
Devī, Thou art the threefold Veda <span id="fr_746"></span>[4](#fn_741.md)
and Bhagavatī; <span id="fr_747"></span>[5](#fn_742.md)  
For the maintenance of the world Thou art the science of *Vartta*; <span
id="fr_748"></span>[6](#fn_743.md)  
Thou art the supreme destroyer of its pains. <span
id="fr_749"></span>[7](#fn_744.md)

9

O Devī! Thou art the power of understanding <span
id="fr_750"></span>[8](#fn_745.md)  
By Which the essence of all *Śāstras* is known;  
Thou art Durgā, <span id="fr_751"></span>[9](#fn_746.md) the vessel wherein
we cross the dangerous ocean of the world.  
Devoid of attachment art Thou. <span id="fr_752"></span>[10](#fn_747.md)  
Śrī <span id="fr_753"></span>[11](#fn_748.md) also, who hast made Thy abode
in the heart of the enemy <span id="fr_754"></span>[12](#fn_749.md) of
Kaiṭabha, <span id="fr_755"></span>[13](#fn_750.md)

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

Thou art indeed Gaurī, <span id="fr_756"></span>[1](#fn_751.md) who hast
fixed Thy dwelling in the moon-crested Deva. <span
id="fr_757"></span>[2](#fn_752.md)

10

Smiling spotless like unto the full moon,  
Resplendent as the finest gold  
And lovely was thy face.  
Yet wonderful it was that swayed by wrath  
The Asura Mahiṣa suddenly smote Thy face when he saw it.

11

Greatly marvellous indeed it was that when he had seen Thy face,  
Wrathful, terribly frowning, beauteous as the rising moon,  
Mahiṣa did not forthwith yield up his life,  
For who can live after beholding the wrathful king of Death? <span
id="fr_758"></span>[3](#fn_753.md)

12

O Devī, our supreme Lady  
Be gracious for the sake of the world.  
For when wrathful Thou dost suddenly destroy the generations of the
enemies. <span id="fr_759"></span>[4](#fn_754.md)  
It is but now made known to us  
That the mighty army of the Asura Mahiṣa has met its end.

13

Those to whom Thou, O bestower of prosperity! art gracious,

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

Are esteemed in all lands,  
Their wealth and fame increases,  
And their *dharma*, *artha*, *kāma*, *mokṣa* <span
id="fr_760"></span>[1](#fn_755.md) know no lessening.  
Praiseworthy are they maintaining sons, servants, and wives.

14

By thy grace, O Devī! the virtuous man, ever honoured,  
Does ever daily all religious acts,  
And thereafter gains heaven by Thy grace; <span
id="fr_761"></span>[2](#fn_756.md)  
Therefore art Thou of a surety the giver of fruit in the three worlds.

15

O Durgā; the remembrance of Thee destroyest the fear of all creatures,  
When called to recollection by those in health Thou dost bestow a truly
good mind.  
O remover of poverty, pain, and fear,  
Who but Thee art ever compassionate for the good of all.

16

By the slaying of these foes the world gains happiness.  
O Devī! Thou hast slain them with the desire  
That they should not always sin so as to merit hell, <span
id="fr_762"></span>[3](#fn_757.md)  
But that by death in battle they may go to Heaven.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

17

Seeing them, why dost Thou not (by Thy look) turn them to ashes?  
Thou throwest Thy weapon among the enemies, the Asuras,  
In order that, being purified by it,  
Even these enemies may go to heaven.  
Such is Thy merciful intention even towards them.

18

If by the glittering, formidable flashes of Thy sword,  
And by the lustre of Thy spear-point,  
The eyes of the Asuras were not destroyed,  
It was because they gazed on Thy countenance,  
Like unto the radiant moon.

19

O Devī! Thy nature it is to subdue the evil works of the wicked.  
Thy form, destructive of the strength of those who destroy the Devas,  
Surpasses all thought, and is comparable with none.  
By this Thou hast manifested Thy kindness even to enemies.

20

Devī! with whom may this Thy valour be compared,  
Or Thy most charming form striking fear among foes?  
In Thee only, bestower of boons, even upon three worlds,

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

Are seen both kindness of heart and relentlessness in battle.

21

By the destruction of their foes the three worlds have been saved by
Thee,  
Thou hast led even these to heaven,  
Having slain them in the front of battle.  
And hast dispelled the fear besetting us from the maddened enemies of
the Devas.  
Salutation to Thee, O Devī!

22

With Thy spear protect us, O Devī! <span
id="fr_763"></span>[1](#fn_758.md)  
O Mother! protect us with Thy sword.  
By the sound of Thy bell guard us,  
And by the twanging of Thy bow-string  
Protect us in the East and in the West,  
Guard us, O Caṇḍikā! in the South,  
And in the North by the brandishing of Thy spear.

23

Whatever gentle forms of Thine,  
And whatever of Thy terrible forms Wander in the three worlds,  
By these forms protect us and the earth.

24

O Mother! by Thy sword, spear, and club,

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

And other weapons, in Thy soft and supple hands, <span
id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_759.md)  
Guard us on every side. <span id="fr_765"></span>[2](#fn_760.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_718"></span>[117:1](htg20.htm#fr_720.md) When the enemies of
the Devas were vanquished by the Goddess, Shakra and the other Devas,
bowing down before Her, their hair "erect with exultation," thus sang
Her praises.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[117:2](htg20.htm#fr_721.md) Her form was that of
their combined powers.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[117:3](htg20.htm#fr_722.md) *Ambika*.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[117:4](htg20.htm#fr_723.md) Great *Ṛṣis* or
Seers.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[117:5](htg20.htm#fr_724.md) Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[117:6](htg20.htm#fr_725.md) Śiva, for they, too,
adore Her.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[118:1](htg20.htm#fr_726.md) *Buddhi*.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[118:2](htg20.htm#fr_727.md) Enemies of the Devas.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[118:3](htg20.htm#fr_728.md) *Sattva*, *Tamas*,
*Rajas*. Nature as spirit, as the veil of spirit, and of descent and
ascent from spirit to matter and matter to spirit (see *Introduction to
Tantra Śāstra*).

<span id="fn_727"></span>[118:4](htg20.htm#fr_729.md) Ordinarily, the world
which consists of the *guṇas* is imperfect, but She who is it and yet
transcends it, is perfect.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[118:5](htg20.htm#fr_730.md) Viṣṇu and Śiva.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[118:6](htg20.htm#fr_731.md) As the Viṣṇu Yāmala
cited in the Śāktānandataranginī, says (*Māstvatparamam rūpam tanna
jānāti kashchana*, chap. iii.) "Her supreme form is that which none
know."

<span id="fn_730"></span>[119:1](htg20.htm#fr_732.md) Not as it has been
rendered, "Thou art the entire world which is composed of parts"--the
world is but a part of Her. Hindu belief is not pantheistic in the
ordinary European sense of the word.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[119:2](htg20.htm#fr_733.md) *Avyākrita*, of which
Nagoji Bhatta says: *Ṣadvidha vikārarahitatvāt*, on account of its being
void of the six forms of change.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[119:3](htg20.htm#fr_734.md) Of whom the
Śāktānandataranginī says: "*Pranamya prakritim nityām paramātma
svarūpinīm*" (chap. i.).

<span id="fn_733"></span>[119:4](htg20.htm#fr_736.md) The *Mantra* of that
name.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[119:5](htg20.htm#fr_737.md) The lunar ancestors
of the human race and the earthly ancestors of the seventh degree, to
whom offering is made in *pitṛkriyā*.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[119:6](htg20.htm#fr_738.md) Vow or voluntary
rite(see *Introduction to Tantra Śāstra*).

<span id="fn_736"></span>[119:7](htg20.htm#fr_739.md) Sages.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[119:8](htg20.htm#fr_740.md) This passage has been
rendered: "Thou studiest with Thy organs, which are the essence of
strength well restrained." But the Devī does not study, nor has She
organs restrained or otherwise.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[120:1](htg20.htm#fr_741.md) Because they were
breathed out by [Īśvara](errata.htm#13.md).

<span id="fn_739"></span>[120:2](htg20.htm#fr_744.md) Of the Vedas so
named.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[120:3](htg20.htm#fr_745.md) Part of the Sāmaveda,
the office of the Udgātri.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[120:4](htg20.htm#fr_746.md) See [p.
33](htg08.htm#page_33.md), note 3.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[120:5](htg20.htm#fr_747.md) For She has all
powers.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[120:6](htg20.htm#fr_748.md) *i.e.*, agriculture,
cattle-rearing, and trading.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[120:7](htg20.htm#fr_749.md) As the Lalitā
Sahasranāma says, "She soothes like moonlight all those who are burnt by
the triple fires of misery" (*tāpatraya*) of phenomenal existence.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[120:8](htg20.htm#fr_750.md) *Medhā*, which Gopal
Chakravarti says = *Dhāranāvati buddhi*.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[120:9](htg20.htm#fr_751.md) Nagoji says:
"*Duhkhaprāpyatvena durgāsi iti uchyate*" (to be attained to with great
difficulty).

<span id="fn_747"></span>[120:10](htg20.htm#fr_752.md) Asangā-nirlepā (G.
C.) *cidānandamayitvāt* (on account of Her being *cit* and *ānanda*).

<span id="fn_748"></span>[120:11](htg20.htm#fr_753.md) Lakṣmī.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[120:12](htg20.htm#fr_754.md) Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[120:13](htg20.htm#fr_755.md) The *Daitya* brother
of Madhu.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[121:1](htg20.htm#fr_756.md) Daughter of guru, the
Lord of the Mountains.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[121:2](htg20.htm#fr_757.md) Śiva, who bears on
His head the crescent moon.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[121:3](htg20.htm#fr_758.md) Yama.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[121:4](htg20.htm#fr_759.md) That is, the
*Daityas*.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[122:1](htg20.htm#fr_760.md) The four aims of
being.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[122:2](htg20.htm#fr_761.md) Nagoji Bhatta says
*tatah* here means that after that (*svarga*), and in order of time they
gain *mokṣa* (liberation).

<span id="fn_757"></span>[122:3](htg20.htm#fr_762.md) Not "Let these
practise sin so as to descend to Hell for long." as it has been
rendered. The Devī's desire is to save even Her foes. The translation of
the alternative reading given by the translation referred to is nearer
the sense of the text.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[124:1](htg20.htm#fr_763.md) Here follows the
*prārthaitā* (prayer).

<span id="fn_759"></span>[125:1](htg20.htm#fr_764.md) Literally, leaflike
(*pallava*), soft, and supple.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[125:2](htg20.htm#fr_765.md) The Ṛṣi in Caṇḍī
continued: Thus was the upholder of the world hymned by the Devas who
did worship Her with celestial flowers, perfumes, unguents, and incense
upon which the Devī, highly honoured with this hymn, said to the Devas:
"Choose what ye desire of me". On which the latter prayed that whenever
they called upon Her She might come to their assistance, and that
whatever mortal should praise Her with this hymn should prosper.
Bhadrakāli said, "Be it so," and vanished from their sight.
