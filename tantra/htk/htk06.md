### VERSE 2

O MAHEŚI, <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16) even should one of poor
mind <span id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17) at any time recite but once
another doubled *Bīja* of Thine, composed of *Īśāna*, <span
id="fr_18"></span>[3](#fn_18) and *Vāmaśravaṇa*, <span
id="fr_19"></span>[4](#fn_19) and *Bindu;* <span
id="fr_20"></span>[5](#fn_20) then, O Thou who hast great and formidable
ear-rings of arrow form, <span id="fr_21"></span>[6](#fn_21) who bearest
on Thy head the crescent moon, such an one becomes all powerful, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[7](#fn_22) having conquered even the Lord of
Speech <span id="fr_23"></span>[8](#fn_23) and the Wealth-Giver, <span
id="fr_24"></span>[9](#fn_24) and charmed countless youthful women with
lotus-like eyes. <span id="fr_25"></span>[10](#fn_25)

COMMENTARY

*'Maheśi'*

Possessor of the great Power of creating, preserving and withdrawing.

*'At any time' (Kadācit)*

Durgārāma-Siddhāntavāgīśa is of opinion that by the use of Kadāchit it
is meant that unlike other religious Karma which can be done only in a
state of purity (Śuci), Japa of the Mantra of Kālī can be done at any
time whether one is in a state of purity or not (Śaucāśauca-kāla). Here
he says one should not give up the worship if there be a birth or death
in the house. The Tantra-Śāstra says that one should do Japa of the
Mantra, whether one is in the state of purity or not, and whether
walking, standing or sleeping.

*'Recite' (Japati)*

Meditate upon.

*'Of dual aspect' (Dvandvam)*

Having the dual aspect of Śiva-Śakti. The Tantra-Śāstra speaks of the
King of Mantras being generated by the union of Śiva and Śakti

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

*'Another Bīja' (Bījamanyat)*

Thy causal (Kāraṇa) aspect which is the Bīja Hūṁ. In the Yāmala it is
said, 'It is with the double Śabdabīja (which is Hūṁ) that She awakens
the mass of Śabda.'

*'Īśāna'*

Is Īśvara. Kathopaniṣad says, 'Puruṣa is the size of only a thumb. He is
like smokeless fire, the Ishāna of what has been and will be. He is
to-day and He is to-morrow. This is That.' Indu is immortality.
Vāmaśravaṇa is the power of granting speech and of attracting forms
(Rūpa). The Tantrābhidāna says, 'Ū is Bhairava, subtle, Sarasvatī . . .
attractor of forms.'

Who dost grant Nirvāṇa liberation. The Mahānirvāṇa-Tantra says, 'The
forehead of Her who is Nityā, Kālarūpā, Arūpā, and Śiva Himself is
marked with the moon on account of immortality.'

*'Dost bear the half-moon' (Chandrārddhacūde) 'Earrings'*

Whose earrings (things very dear) are formed of two Sādhakas who are
like Maheśvara and simple as boys; that is child-like simple Sādhakas
who have true knowledge are dear to Her. In the Vivekacūdāmaṇi it is
said, 'Just as a boy plays with toys heedless of hunger and other pain
so the wise man plays happy, unattached and selfless.' Such a Sādhaka
attains all forms of knowledge and riches and can charm the whole world.

*(Mahāghorabālāvataṁse)*

There is however another reading given by Durgārāma-Siddhāntavāgīśa
namely Mahāghorābalāvataṁse, that is whose earrings are formed of
frightful arrows (Bāna).

<span id="fn_16"></span>[47:1](htk06.htm#fr_16) <span id="page_48">p.
48</span> *Śakti* or *Maheśa* the Lord of even Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Rudra
(V). The Devī as Īśvarī, (Ruler), of the Universe and Spouse of Nirguṇa
Maheśvara. Īśvara, according to the Liṅga-Purāṇa, when associated with
*Tamas*, is Rudra the Destroyer; with *Rajas*, the One born from the
golden egg, Brahmā; and with *Sattva*, Viṣṇu.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[47:2](htk06.htm#fr_17) <span id="page_49">p.
49</span> *Mandacetāh* who is not capable of devotion to thy lotus feet
according to Commentator K.B.; for, as the Brahmāṇda-Purāṇa says, all
sin is expiated by remembrance of the feet of the Supreme Śakti.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[47:3](htk06.htm#fr_18) That is, *Ha*.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[47:4](htk06.htm#fr_19) The 'left ear,' or long
vowel *ū*.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[47:5](htk06.htm#fr_20) *Nāda-bindu*—that is, *H

Deva or Asura (Viśvasāra-Tantra) (K.B.)

<span id="fn_21"></span>[47:6](htk06.htm#fr_21) Worn by Kālī: reading
Bāna instead of Bāla as to which see *post*.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[47:7](htk06.htm#fr_22) Viśvasāra (K.B.).

<span id="fn_23"></span>[47:8](htk06.htm#fr_23) *Bṛhaspati*, *Guru* of
the *Devas*.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[47:9](htk06.htm#fr_24) *Dhanada*, i.e.
*Kubera*, Lord of Wealth, King of the Yakṣas; according to one account
the son, and, according to another, the grandson of Pulastya (see Muir,
OṢ., T. iv, 481, 488; v, 483; i, 492).

<span id="fn_25"></span>[47:10](htk06.htm#fr_25) That is, to them are
given eloquence and learning, riches and beauty.
