### VERSE 11

O SPOUSE of Hara, <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md) should (a
*Sādhaka*) daily <span id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_90.md) recite Thy *mantra*
for the space of a year meditating the while <span
id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_91.md) with knowledge of its meaning <span
id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_92.md) upon Thee intent <span
id="fr_93"></span>[5](#fn_93.md) upon Thy union <span
id="fr_94"></span>[6](#fn_94.md) with the great Mahākāla, above whom Thou
art, <span id="fr_95"></span>[7](#fn_95.md) then such a knower <span
id="fr_96"></span>[8](#fn_96.md) has every pleasure that he wills upon the
earth, <span id="fr_97"></span>[9](#fn_97.md) and holds all great
powers <span id="fr_98"></span>[10](#fn_98.md) in the grasp of his
lotus-like hands.

COMMENTARY

*'Spouse of Hara' (Haravadhū)*

Charmer of Mahākāla.

*'Mentally recite' (Vicintya japati)*

The Kaulāvalī says that mental (Mānasā) Japa is a hundred times more
efficacious than verbal (Vācika) Japa.

According to Durgārāma the words may also mean 'recite' keeping in mind
the Artha or meaning and so forth of the Mantra. For it is said that he
who does not know the Artha of Mantra, the Caitanya of Mantra, and
Yoni-mudrā is without success (Siddhi) even if he do Japa of the Mantra
a million times.

*'Unperturbed mind' (Susthībhūya)*

The Kulārṇava-Tantra thus enjoins: 'Beloved when doing Japa of a Mantra
one should be calm, pure, sparing in food, reverential, self-controlled,
unaffected by the opposites (Dvandva), steady of mind, silent and
self-disciplined.

*'Meditating on Thee' (Vicintyatvām)*

The Kaulāvalī-Tantra says, 'One should meditate upon the Spouse of Śiva
before Japa and after meditation should again do

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Japa.' The Sādhaka
who does Japa and meditation together soon attains success.

*'Upon Him' (Vipāritām)*

(The original is 'Viparītah' in the first case and Durgārāma therefore
makes it an adjective of the Sādhaka who he says unites with his Śakti
in Viparīta Maithuna. Vimalānanda however reads it as Vipāritām in the
second case making it an adjective of 'Thee' (the Devī) who is the
object of meditation,)

*'Great Powers' (Mahāsiddhinivahāh)*

Such as that by which is gained Sālokya, Sārūpya, Sāyujya and Nirvāṇa
forms of Liberation.
