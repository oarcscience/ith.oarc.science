### VERSE 13

O MOTHER, people there are who worship many other *Devas* than
Thyself. <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103.md) They are greatly
ignorant, and know nothing of the high truth, <span
id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_104) (but I.md) of my own uncontrollable <span
id="fr_105"></span>[3](#fn_105.md) desire for Thee approach Thee, the
Primordial Power, <span id="fr_106"></span>[4](#fn_106.md) who dost deeply
enjoy the great Bliss arising from union (with Śiva), <span
id="fr_107"></span>[5](#fn_107.md) and who art worshipped by Hari, Hara,
Viriñci, and all other Devas. <span id="fr_108"></span>[6](#fn_108.md)

COMMENTARY

*'Deluded' (Vimūdhāh)*

That is, devoid of discrimination.

*'Enlightened' (Vibudhaih)*

The Bagalā-Stotra says, 'Oh four-armed, four-headed, worshipful
Parameśvari, Oh Devi Aṁbikā who art ever worshipped with devotion by
Kṛṣṇa, Oh Parameśvari who art worshipped by the Lord of the daughter of
Himālaya, grant beauty, Grant victory' and so forth.

*'Ādyā'*

Who art before and the beginning of the world.

*'Union' (Rati)*

Which is Viparīta as above described.

*'Wine'*

That is Rasa.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_103"></span>[74:1](htk17.htm#fr_103.md) <span id="page_74">p.
74</span> That is, thinking that other *Devas* grant greater boons
(Commentary, K.B.). Cf. also what Śaṁkarācārya says about the worship of
other Devas in fourth śloka of the *Devyaparādha-kṣamāpana-stotra*, and
see *Devibhāgavata* (V. 19) (Hymn to Jagadaṁbikā).

<span id="fn_104"></span>[74:2](htk17.htm#fr_104.md) <span id="page_75">p.
75</span> *Paramam*, that is, *Tattvaṁ*.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[74:3](htk17.htm#fr_105.md) For he is a devotee
(Bhakta) whose desire for Her is so great that he cannot control but is
controlled by it.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[74:4](htk17.htm#fr_106.md) *Ādyā*.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[74:5](htk17.htm#fr_107.md)
*Rati-rasa-mahānanda-niratām*. The Devī delights in creation, which is
the fruit of Her union with the *Puruṣa* (Śiva). 'Great Bliss,' for, as
on the physical plane yadrūpaṁ paramānandam tan nāsti bhuvanatraye
(Mātṛkābheda-Tantra, chap. ii), it is the counterpart on that plane of
the ecstatic union which produced the Universe itself. It is the
reflection of the higher Bliss attainable even here by the union of
Śivaśakti (in the form of Kuṇdalinī) in the *Sahasrāra*. Some read
*Rasikāṁ* for *Niratāṁ*.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[74:6](htk17.htm#fr_108.md) *Viṣṇu*, *Śiva*, and
*Brahmā*. What, then, is the use of praying to *Brahmā*, *Viṣṇu*, and
*Śiva* when they themselves worship Her? (Commentary, K.B.). Cf. also
Devibhāgavata, *loc. cit*. The *Devi* is Mother of all, from *Brahmā* to
the lowliest worm (*Ābrahmākhilajanani*, Lalitā 67).
