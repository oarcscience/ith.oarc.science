### VERSE 12

O MOTHER, Thou givest birth to and protectest the world, and at the time
of dissolution dost withdraw to Thyself <span
id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99) the earth and all things; therefore Thou
art Brahmā, and the Lord of the three worlds, the Spouse of Śrī, <span
id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_100) and Maheśa, <span
id="fr_101"></span>[3](#fn_101) and all other beings and things. <span
id="fr_102"></span>[4](#fn_102) Ah Me! how, then, shall I praise Thy
greatness?

COMMENTARY

*'Dost withdraw' (Saṁharati)*

That is dost make the world lose itself in Thy Causal (Kāraṇa) body.

*'Dhātā'*

She is the creative Śakti of Brahmā.

*'Husband of Śrī' (Śrīpatih)*

She is the preservative Śakti of Viśṇu whose spouse is Śrī or Lakṣmī.

*'Maheśa'*

She is the dissolving Śakti of Rudra.

*'All things' (Samastaṁ)*

Thou art both the material and instrumental cause of the world. The
Triputā-Stotra says, 'Thou art Earth, Brahmā, and Creatrix of the world.
Thou art also Water, Viṣṇu, and Preserver of the world. And thou art
Fire, Rudra and the Dissolver of the world. As the Air of the world thou
art Aiśvarya.' Another Stotra says, 'She assumes three forms of body for
the purpose of creation, maintenance

and dissolution. The world being constituted of the three Guṇas, Brahmā,
Viṣṇu and Rudra are Her Vikṛtis.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_99"></span>[72:1](htk16.htm#fr_99) It is commonly said that
She destroys but not so. Devatā does not destroy (*Na devo nāśakah*).
Man does. She takes back what She has put forth.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[72:2](htk16.htm#fr_100) *Viṣṇu*, husband of
*Lakṣmi*.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[72:3](htk16.htm#fr_101) *Śiva*. The *Trimūrti*
is, in fact, Her manifestation.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[72:4](htk16.htm#fr_102) *Prāyah sakalaṁ api*,
that is, all moving and unmoving things (Commentary, K.B.). For the Devī
is *Viśvarūpiṇī* in the form of the whole universe. She is the objective
world, '*jadātmikā*' (Lalitā, verse 90), as well as its Cause.
