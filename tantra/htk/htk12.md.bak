### VERSE 8

THOSE who truly <span id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md) meditate on Thee,
the Spouse of Hara, <span id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_69.md) who art seated
in <span id="fr_70"></span>[3](#fn_70.md) the cremation-ground strewn with
funeral pyres, corpses, skulls, and bones, and haunted by female jackals
howling fearfully; who art very youthful, <span
id="fr_71"></span>[4](#fn_71.md) and art in full enjoyment upon <span
id="fr_72"></span>[5](#fn_72.md) Thy Spouse, are revered by all and in all
places. <span id="fr_73"></span>[6](#fn_73.md)

COMMENTARY

*'Meditate on' (Dhyāyanti)*

That is see with unperturbed mind.

*'Spouse of Hara' (Haravadhūṁ)*

Hara is He who removes (Harati) the threefold pains (Ādhyātmika,
Ādhibhautika, Ādhidaivika) of Jivas. His spouse is Śakti, that is She
who grants Liberation to Jīvas and is Saccidānandarūpiṇī.'

*'Hast entered' (Praviṣtāṁ)*

Art established.

*'Flaming' pyre (Prakatitacitāyāṁ)*

Cit-śakti On account of Her being self-manifested. Caṇdī speaks of 'Her
who pervades the whole universe as consciousness (Cit).'

*'Fearful' (Ghorābhih)*

That is very powerful.

*'Jackals' (Śivābhih)*

That is Mahābhūtas which are auspicious (Śiva) before being made
fivefold (Pañcīkṛta).

*'Skulls and bones' (Muṇdāsthi-nikaraih)*

The white colour of the skulls and bones indicates the white
Sattva-guṇa. Hence associated with the Sattva and other Guṇas of the
Jīvas dissolved in Mahāpralaya.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

*'Ever youthful' (Atiyuvatīṁ)*

That is She is always the same, fresh, unchanging, and un-wasting.

*'Satisfied with enjoyment ' (Santushtām-uparisuratena)*

She, after subduing Parama Śiva to Her will, has willingly enjoyment in
the work of creation, preservation and dissolution. Nirvāṇa-Tantra says,
'The Vāmā (She who is on the left) is the Grantrix of Great Liberation
after conquering the Dakṣiṇa (Śiva who is on the right).'
Gandharva-Tantra says, 'She who is the Sun, Moon, and Fire and half of
Ha (Śiva) puts down the Puruṣa and enjoys him from above.'
Niruttara-Tantra says, 'When Nirguṇā Kālī becomes Saguṇā She is engaged
in Viparītarati.' The Yoga-vāṣiṣtha in the Nirvāṇa-Prakaraṇa says,
'Natural unity is Śiva. Creation is (compared with it) unnatural.' That
is the Mahādevī is Nirguṇa-Brahman in Her Svarūpa aspect and the
subversion of this Svarūpa is the cause of creation.

*'Nowhere' (Kvacidapi na)*

In no birth.

*'Humiliated' (Paribhavah)*

That is they are not subjected to birth, death, and rebirth and attain
Nirvāṇa.
