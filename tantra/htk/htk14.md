### VERSE 10

IF by night, <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82) Thy devotee <span
id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_83) unclothed, with dishevelled hair, recites
whilst meditating on Thee, <span id="fr_84"></span>[3](#fn_84) Thy
*mantra*, <span id="fr_85"></span>[4](#fn_85) when with his
*Śakti* <span id="fr_86"></span>[5](#fn_86) youthful, full-breasted, and
heavy-hipped, such an one makes all powers subject to him, and dwells on
the earth ever <span id="fr_87"></span>[6](#fn_87) a seer. <span

COMMENTARY

*'Laya Yoga'*

Is here described in this and following verses. Gheraṇda-Saṁhitā says,
'One should become Śaktimaya by doing Yoni Mudra. One should be in
Paramātmā with sweet Śṛngārarasa (love sentiment) and being Blissful
(Ānandamaya) should unite with Brahman.' The Gorakṣa-Saṁhitā says,
'Raising the Śakti with the Jīva to the Lotus in the head one should
become Śaktimaya and uniting with Śiva should think of all forms of
happiness and enjoyment.' The Tantra-Kalpadruma says, 'One should
meditate on Devī Kuṇdalinī as Iṣtadevatā, ever youthful, of the age of
sixteen, full-breasted, dark, subtle, appearing as creation and in the
form of creation, maintenance and dissolution (Ṣṛṣti-sthiti-layātmikā).'

*'Thy devotee' (Bkaktah)*

Here the Divya Sādhaka who is a Yogin.

*'By night (Naktam)'*

That is, awaking in Brahmavidyā which (though Light) is darkness for all
ordinary creatures. The Bhagavadgītā says, 'The self-controlled man
awakes in what is night to all creatures.'

*'Naked' (Vivāsāh)*

That is, stripped of the covering of Māyā: that is awakened.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

*'Dishevelled hair' (Galitacikurah)*

That is, with mind free from all restlessness. The word Cikura means
both hair and restless.

*'Meditating' (Dhyāyan)*

On Thee as in enjoyment of Sāmarasya bliss with Paramaśiva.

*'Enjoying' (Ratāsaktām)*

By doing Laya of (merging) the Jīvātmā in Kuṇdaliṇī-Śakti, the
ever-youthful, all-pervading Genetrix and Preserver of all Jīvas. The
creative and nourishing function of Kuṇdaliṇī is indicated by the
epithets 'heavy-hipped' and 'full-breasted.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_82"></span>[68:1](htk14.htm#fr_82) <span id="page_69">p.
69</span> *Naktaṁ*. At dead of night. The Phetkāriṇī-Tantra says, 'By
night, naked with dishevelled hair in union with *Śakti*, by him is all
*Siddhi* gained'. The Kālikrama says, 'The *Paśu* devoted to his own
*Ācāra* should recite his *Mantra* a lakh of times by day. The *Vira* or
*Divya* should recite it a lakh of times by night.' Kubjikā-Tantra says
'Such as are in *Paśubhāva* are but *Paśus*. They should not touch a
rosary nor recite *Mantra* by night.' (V)

<span id="fn_83"></span>[68:2](htk14.htm#fr_83) *Bhaktah*. Here a
*Vira-Sādhaka*. Niruttara-Tantra says, 'The *Mantrin* who has received
*Ābhiṣeka* should do *Kulapūjā*. Oh Devī the *Mantra* of *Kāli* does not
become *Siddha* without *Kulācāra*.' (V)

<span id="fn_84"></span>[68:3](htk14.htm#fr_84) *Tvāṁ dhyāyan*. Mentally
seeing Thee in his heart as ever in the Enjoyment of union with
*Mahākāla*. (V)

<span id="fn_85"></span>[68:4](htk14.htm#fr_85) Thy *Mantra* is the
aforesaid great *Mantra*. (V)

<span id="fn_86"></span>[68:5](htk14.htm#fr_86) He is *Ratāsakta*, the
meaning of which is as follows: *Sa mantraṁ japati yadā sa
śobhanāṅgapratyaṅgaśālinyā manohāriṇyāyuvatyā śaktyā saha maithunāsakto
bhavati*. Whilst in union (*Maithuna*) the mind must be concentrated on
*Devī Kāli* and *japā* must be done of Her *Mahāmantra*. The devotee
should not think of aught else.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[68:6](htk14.htm#fr_87) So also
Phetkāriṇī-Tantra (ch. x) says:

'*Rātrau nagnah śyānas ca maithune ca vyavasthitah.  
Athavā muktakeśash ca tena syuh sarvvasiddhayah.  
Staṁbhanaṁ mohana-caiva vaśīkaraṇaṁ eva ca*.'

Here *Athavā* means if the *Sādhaka* is without a *Śakti*; then
recitation of *mantra* with dishevelled hair gives the same *siddhi*.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[68:7](htk14.htm#fr_88) *Kavi* which has not
here the limited sense of 'Poet.'
