### VERSE 15

HE, O Mahākālī, <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) who in the
cremation-ground, naked, and with disheveled hair, intently <span
id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md) meditates upon Thee <span
id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_115.md) and recites Thy *mantra*, and with each
recitation makes offering to Thee of a thousand *Ākaṇda* flowers <span
id="fr_116"></span>[4](#fn_116.md) with seed, <span
id="fr_117"></span>[5](#fn_117.md) becomes without any effort a Lord of the
earth. <span id="fr_118"></span>[6](#fn_118.md)

COMMENTARY

*'And' (Tu)*

For Divya Sādhakas.

*'Mahākālī'*

Or Parabrahmarūpiṇī.

*Cremation-ground' (Śmaśānasthah)*

The cremation-ground is Parabrahman into which in the great Dissolution
(Mahāpralaya) all beings go as though corpses. 'In the cremation ground'
therefore, means devoted to Parabrahman.

*'Naked' (Dikpatadharah)*

That is, free from the covering of Māyā; whose Consciousness is
untainted.

*'Meditates on Thee' (Dhyānaniratah)*

That is, upon Thy Saccidānanda aspect. The Rudrayāmala says, 'He who
follows the Kula path should do Japa of Mantra seeking protection from
Devī who is Consciousness, Bliss and Source of knowledge, who is all
Tattvas whose refulgence is that of millions of flashes of lightning.'

*'Sunflowers' (Arkānāṃ)*

Flowers of feeling such as compassion, forgiveness and so forth which
are functions of the Mind called the Sun in the Brahmarandhra. The
Jñānasaṁkalinī-Tantra says, 'Oh Beloved, the mind is seated on the
surface of the sun and life on that of the moon.' The

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Yājñavalkya-Saṁhitā says, 'The Moon is known to be in the Idā and the
sun in the Piṅgalā (Nādī).

*'Self-produced Bīja' (Nijagalitavīryena)*

This Bīja is here the nectar which naturally flows from the
thousand-petalled Lotus. The Mahānirvāṇa-Tantra says, 'The Heart-Lotus
should be offered for seat, the nectar (Amṛta) shed from the Sahasrāra
for water to wash the feet, the mind as the offering (Arghya), Memory
(Citta) is offered by way of flowers, and the vital airs (Praṇa) as and
by way of incense.' Jñānasaṁkalinī-Tantra says, 'Libation (Tarpana) to
the Supreme Liberatrix should be made from out the vessel of the Moon
and Arghya should be given from out the vessel of the Sun. Compassion,
wisdom, and forgiveness are flowers as is also control of the senses. So
too are charity (Dayā) and religious merit. Non-injury (Ahiṁsā) to any
being is an excellent flower. Bliss is a flower and so too is the
worship of the Sādhaka. Whoever offers these ten flowers attains to the
feet of the Liberatrix.' In this verse Savikalpasamādhiyoga is
indicated.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[78:1](htk19.htm#fr_113.md) <span id="page_79">p.
79</span> *Mahākālī*, *Śakti* of *Mahākāla*.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[78:2](htk19.htm#fr_114.md) *Susthah*: with
undistracted mind. (V)

<span id="fn_115"></span>[78:3](htk19.htm#fr_115.md) *Tava dhyāna-niratah*,
that is, Upon Thy form. (V)

<span id="fn_116"></span>[78:4](htk19.htm#fr_116.md) *Arka* = Sun flowers
known as *Ākaṇda* (V) not the flower so called in English.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[78:5](htk19.htm#fr_117.md) *Nija-galita-vīryeṇa
kusumaṁ*. Thus the offering is not only of the flowers of the *Ākaṇda*
plant, *yatah sādhakah devyai sva-vīrya-miśri-tārkapuṣpāni samarpayati*.
Durgārāma-Siddhāntavāgīśa cites the Mahākālasaṁhitā as saying that the
*sūryapuṣpa* should be offered in the same way with *japa* of the
*mūlamantra* (*svavīryamiśrita-sūryapuṣpāni)*. The *vīrya* does not,
refer to the sap of the plant. *Nija* refers to the *sādhaka*. 'Along
with, that is dipped in or that is spread over with.' *Mahākāla-samhitā*
says, A *Kaula-Sādhaka* in the cremation-ground, naked, dishevelled and
with tranquil mind, should offer a thousand sunflowers with seed
reciting the while his *Mantra*. After meditating and worshipping with
great devotion he should recite the Hymn' (V).

<span id="fn_118"></span>[78:6](htk19.htm#fr_118.md) That is, a king or
*rājā*. So the Phetkāriṇī-Tantra says that wealth, strength, eloquence,
intelligence, and the love of women (*Sarvayoṣitpriyah*) is gained.
