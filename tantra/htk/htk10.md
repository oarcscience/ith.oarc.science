O DEVĪ <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53) of full breasts, <span
id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54) whose throat is adorned with a garland of
heads, They who meditating <span id="fr_55"></span>[3](#fn_55) recite

thereof <span id="fr_56"></span>[4](#fn_56) together with Thy

such the Devī of Speech <span id="fr_58"></span>[6](#fn_58) ever
Wanders, and in their lotus-like eyes Kamalā <span

COMMENTARY

*'Devī'*

The self-manifest one.

'Full breasts' (*Pīnastanādhyā*)

The milk of these is the, food with which She nourishes the world and
the drink of immortality with which She liberates Her Sādhakas.

*'Whose neck' (Muṇda-sragatiśaya-lasat-kaṇṭi)*

She who is Śabdabrahman consisting of 50 Letters. Niruttara-Tantra says,
'She is adorned with a garland of heads representing the 50 letters.'
Kāmadhenu-Tantra says, 'In My throat is the wonderful Bīja of 50
letters.' Again ' I worship the Mother the source of the universe,
Śabdabrahman itself, blissful.' Viśvasāra says, 'Blissful Brahman is
adorned with Śabdabrahman and within the body is represented by all
Mantraś.

*'Bīja'*

Mūrti (appearance) in the individual aspect as Prājña, Taijasa, and
Viśva and in the aggregate as Īśa, Sūtra and Virād. Devīgītā says 'the
causal self is Prājña, the subtle bodied one is Taijasa and the gross
bodied one is Viśva.' Similarly Īśa is spoken of as Īśa, Sūtra and
Virād. The first is the individual (Vyaṣti) aspect and the second the
aggregate (Samaṣti) aspect.

*Eyes (Netra)*

Not to speak of themselves being wealthy, the sight of them gives wealth
to others. Bhairava Tantra says that Kamalā and the Devī of speech never
forsake them for three generations downwards.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_53"></span>[59:1](htk10.htm#fr_53) *Devī* which comes from
the root *Div* to shine, is the Shining One (V).

<span id="fn_54"></span>[59:2](htk10.htm#fr_54) *Pināstanādhye* (see
also Bhairavīstotra in Tantra-sāra, p. 596). The physical
characteristics of the Devī in swelling breasts and hips are emblematic
of Her great Motherhood, for She is *Śrīmātā*. See also as to the
former, Durgā-*Dhyāna* in Devī-Purāṇa, which speaks of her large and
rising breasts (*Pīnonnata-payodharāṁ*); the Annapūrṇā-*Stava*
(*Vakṣojakuṁbhāntari*); Bhuvaneśvarī-*Stotra* (*Āpivara-stanatatīṁ*);
and the Saraswatī-*Dhyāna* (*Kucabharanamitāṁgīṁ*). The
Annapūrnā-*Dhyāna* (*Annapradāna-niratāṁ stanabhāra-naṁrāṁ*) speaks of
Her limbs as weighted by Her breasts. The Mahābhāgavata describes Her as
naked, terrific, with fiery eyes, full and erect breasts, and
dishevelled hair; and the Lalitā (verse 15) says: 'Her golden girdle
supports Her waist, which bends under the burden of Her breasts, thrice
folding the skin below Her bosom'
(*Stanabhāra-dalanmadhya-pattabhandha-valitrayā*).

<span id="fn_55"></span>[59:3](htk10.htm#fr_55) *Bhāvayantah*, that is,
meditating on the naked, full-breasted, black form with dishevelled hair
as stated in Her *Dhyāna*, and which is the *Artha* of the particular
*Mantra*. The *Bhūtaśuddhi-Tantra* says, 'A Mantra should be recited
mentally meditating the while on the form of the *Devī* denoted by it '
(V).

<span id="fn_56"></span>[59:4](htk10.htm#fr_56) Any one of the aforesaid
Bījas or the whole that is, the whole nine-lettered *Vidyā* in full.
Which according to the Kumārī-Tantra cited in Tantraratna is *Krīṁ,
Krīṁ, Krīṁ, Hūṁ, Hūṁ, Hūṁ, Hrīṁ, Hrīṁ, Hrīṁ*. Śyāmārahaśya quoting
Kālikā-Śruti, says that the whole *Vidyā* should be recited once, twice
or thrice, or the whole *mantra* with '*Dakṣiṇe Kālike* between the
Bījas.' (K. B.) Thus, *Krīṁ, Krīṁ, Krīṁ, Hūṁ, Hūṁ, Hrīṁ, Hrīṁ, Dakṣiṇe
Kālike, Krīṁ, Krīṁ, Krīṁ, Hūṁ, Hūṁ, Hrīṁ, Hrīṁ*.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[59:5](htk10.htm#fr_57) *Dakṣiṇe Kālikā*.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[59:6](htk10.htm#fr_58) *Sarasvati*. The
Bhāradvāja-Smṛtī says Sarasvatī is She who ever resides in the tongue of
all beings, and who causes speech.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[59:7](htk10.htm#fr_59) *Lakṣmi*: for them is
all learning, wealth, and prosperity (see Mahānirvāṇa-Tantra, *Ullāsa*,
vii, verse 50).

<span id="fn_60"></span>[59:8](htk10.htm#fr_60) In the other words they
become rich and learned.
