COMMENTARY

*'Kālikā'*

Ka is Brahmā, A is Ananta, La is Ātmā of the universe, I is subtle, Ka
is Brahmā, A is Ananta. (Tantrābhidāna). Thus it is said that Mahādevī
is the subtle, beginningless and endless Ātmā [of](errata.htm#8.md) the
universe. 'Thou who art Brahman without beginning or end.' In the
Asitāstotra in the Adbhutarāmāyaṇa Śrī Rama says, 'I bow to that Thine
aspect which is Puruṣa without beginning and end, the unmanifest
Kūtastha superior (to Thine aspect) as Prakṛti, the Ātmā of the universe
appearing in multiple and differing forms.'

\[Durgārāma-Siddhāntavāgīśa derives the word Kālikā as follows:—He who
dissolves (Kalayati) the world is (Kāla or Śiva). And She who shines
(Dīvyati) that is plays (Krīdati) with Him is Kālika Kāla + ikan + ā =
Kālikā.\]

*'With dishevelled hair' (Vigalitacikure)*

That is one who is free from all Vikāras such as the passion for
arranging the hair and so forth.

*'Streams of blood' (Asradhūrā)*

This blood indicates (the red) Rajas Guṇa. Mahādevī is without that for
She is Śuddha-sattva-guṇa.

*'Recite' (Japati)*

Meditate upon.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

*Of dual aspect (Dvandvaṁ)*

The Bījā Hrīṁ is both Śiva and Śakti. In the Devīgītā Mahādevī says, 'H
is the gross body, R is the subtle body, I is the causal body. I am Hrīṁ
the Turīya.'

*'Īśa'*

Who is the aspect of subtle Bīja.

*'Vaiśvānara'*

Which is full of Tejas.

*'Vāmanetra'*

That is, with Māyā consisting of pure Sattva-Guṇa.

*'Indu'*

This is, the Śakti which gives immortality.

*'Three syllabled Dakṣiṇā'*

Dakṣiṇe is Dakṣinā in the vocative, and the latter is the Saccidānanda
aspect which grants Kaivalya and is indicated, by the three-syllabled
Mantra. Nirvāṇa-Tantra says, 'The Sun's son (Death) is established in
the south (Dakṣiṇa). The name of Kālī makes him flee in all directions
with fear. Hence She is called Dakṣiṇa in three worlds.' Kāmākhyā-Tantra
says, 'Just as guerdon (Dakṣīṇa) given at the end of rite, causes it to
be fruitful and gives Liberation, so this Devī grants the fruit of all
Karma and hence She is called Dakṣiṇa-Kālī.' The same Tantra also says,
'Puruṣa is on the right (Dakṣiṇa) and Śakti on the left. The left
conquers the right and becomes the grantor of great Liberation. Hence
She is called Dakṣiṇakālī in the three worlds.'

\[Durgārāma construes these words as follows: Dakṣiṇe tryakṣare ati (by
Saṁdhi tryakṣare’ti) that is Dakṣiṇe ati tryakṣare. As Upasargas can
shift their position 'ati' has been placed in the verse after
Tryakshare. Atitryakshare is the vocative of Atitryakṣarā. Atitryakṣarā
means Atikrāntah (Adhahkṛtah or placed under) Tryakṣarah (Śiva) yayā (by
whom) She: that is, She who has placed Śiva under Her. The whole then
means 'Oh Dakshiṇa who dost stand on Śiva.' Tryakṣara literally means
the three lettered one which is the Praṇava (Oṁ) and is used for Śiva.
The Mahiṁnastotra

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (see 'Greatness of
Śiva' Ed. A. Avalon) calls Śiva 'Oṁ' and another Stotra calls Him
Tryakṣaramaya.

The same commentator then says that there is a different reading for
Dakshiṇe tryakṣareti, namely, Dakshiṇe Kāliketi which he explains in two
ways (*a*) Dakshiṇe Kālike’ti = Dakshiṇe Kālike ati = Dakshiṇe
atikālike. The last word is the vocative of Atikālikā which means
Atikrāntā (Sadṛśīkritā, made similar to) Kālikā (Meghajālaṁ; a bank of
cloud) yayā (by whom) She—that is, She who looks like a bank of cloud;
the whole then meaning 'Oh Dakshiṇā who hast the appearance of a bank of
clouds' (*b*) Dakṣiṇe Kāliketi = Dakṣine Kālike iti which means Oh
Dakṣiṇā Kālikā. The word 'iti' is Svarūpārthaka that is simply indicates
that She is addressed as Dakṣiṇā Kālikā. Examples of the elision of 'I'
after 'E' in Saṁdhi are Śakuntaleti and Meghajāle’pi Kāliketi.\]

<span id="fn_26"></span>[50:1](htk07.htm#fr_26.md) <span id="page_52">p.
52</span> The Devī. See Mahānirvāṇa-Tantra, chap. xiii and chap. iv,
verse 31: 'At the dissolution of things it is Kāla who will devour all,
and by reason of this He is called Mahākāla; and since Thou devourest
Mahākāla Himself, it is Thou who art the supreme primordial Kālikā'.

*Kālikā* is *Brahmarūpiṇī* (V).

<span id="fn_27"></span>[50:2](htk07.htm#fr_27.md) *Vigalitacikure*, as is
the worshipped *nāyikā*. See *post*.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[50:3](htk07.htm#fr_28.md)
*Sṛkkadvandvāsradhārādvayadharavadane*. Kālī is so represented as having
devoured the flesh of the demons. The Mahānirvāṇa-Tantra, chap. xiii,
verse 9, says: 'As She devours all existence, as She chews all things
existing with Her fierce teeth, therefore, a mass of blood is imagined
to be the apparel of the Queen of the *Devas*.' Esoterically blood is
Rajas Guṇa.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[50:4](htk07.htm#fr_29.md) That is, *Ha*, as to
which see Kāmadhenu-Tantra, chap. ii; and Prānatoṣinī, 53 *et seq*.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[50:5](htk07.htm#fr_30.md) Lord of Fire, whose
*Bīja* is *Ra*.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[50:6](htk07.htm#fr_31.md) 'Left eye,' or fourth
vowel long *ī*.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[50:7](htk07.htm#fr_32.md) *Nāda-bindu*; the Bīja
is thus *H* + *r* + *ī* + *m* = *Hrīṁ Hrīṁ*. In Svatantra-Tantra *Ha*
(*Vyoṃa*) is said to denote manifestation; *Ra* (*Vahni*) is involution;
and Ī maintenance of the worlds.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[50:8](htk07.htm#fr_33.md) The earth, upper and
nether worlds (see Viśvasāra-Tantra and Phetkāriṇī-Tantra).
*Tribhuvanaṁ*, that is *Devas*, *Men*, *Nāgas* and so forth inhabiting
*Svarga* (Heaven), *Martya* (Earth) and *Pātāla* (Nether world) (V).
