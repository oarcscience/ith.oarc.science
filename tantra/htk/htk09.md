### VERSE 5

O MOTHER, they who recite Thy charming *Bīja*, composed of the first of
the group of letters, <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43) followed by
*Vahni*, <span id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44) *Rati*, <span
id="fr_45"></span>[3](#fn_45) and beautified by *Vidhu*, <span
id="fr_46"></span>[4](#fn_46) thrice, the *Kürca Bīja* <span
id="fr_47"></span>[5](#fn_47) twice, and thereafter, O Smiling Face, the
*Lajjā* <span id="fr_48"></span>[6](#fn_48) *Bīja* twice, followed by
the two *Thas*, <span id="fr_49"></span>[7](#fn_49) they, O Spouse of
the Destroyer of the Deva of Desire <span id="fr_50"></span>[8](#fn_50)
contemplating Thy true form, <span id="fr_51"></span>[9](#fn_51) become
themselves the Deva of Love whose eyes are as beautiful as the petals of
the lotus which Lakṣmī holds in Her playful dance. <span
id="fr_52"></span>[10](#fn_52)

COMMENTARY

*'Whoever' (Ye, ye)*

Even the most sinful. The Kālīkularahasya says, 'Whoever he be who
remembers Durgā with or without reverence is delivered from evil and
attains the supreme end.'

*'Recite' (Japanti)*

Meditate upon.

*'Thy Bīja'*

\[Durgārāma Siddhāntavāgīśa calls it the nine syllabled Bīja.\]

*First letter (Vargādyaṁ)*

The aspect of Consciousness (Cinmayarūpa) which is the beginning of
creation.

*Placed on Vahni (Vahnisaṁsthaṁ)*

Full of Tejas.

*'Associated' (Vidhu-rati-lalitaṁ)*

That is cooling and beautiful.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

*'Thrice' (Trayaṁ)*

'That is the three aspects of Sattva, Rajas, Tamas.

*'Kürca'*

Is Śabdabrahman.

*'Lajjā'*

Is Brahman associated with Māyā.

*'Two Thas'*

Svāhā the revealing Śakti of Fire.

*'Smiling face' (Smitamukhi)*

Because She is always blissful.

*'Spouse of the Destroyer' (Smara-hara-mahile)*

Śakti of Śiva who is the Destroyer of passionate Desire; that is She
destroys the lust, anger and so forth of Her Sādhakas.

*'Thy true form' (Śvarūpaṁ)*

That which is not different (in essence) from Jīvātmā. Śvarūpa is
explained here as the Rūpa of Śva, that is Ātmā, meaning the Oneness of
Paramātmā and Jīvātmā. Kālikā-Śruti says, 'One should always think of
Ātmā as Kālī'. Kālīkulasarvasva says, 'He who worships the spouse of
Śiva thinking that his Ātmā is Kālikā's Ātmā and meditating on the
Śiva-like Guru is Sadāśiva Himself.' Yoginī-Tantra says, 'He who thinks,
even if it were for a moment, "I am Brahman" to him the Devī gives
unending fruit. One's own body should always be thought of as the body
of the Iṣtadevatā. And so the whole world should be considered as Her
body.'

\[Durgārāma explains Svarūpa in the following ways: (*a*) The true form
is that indicated in the previous or following verses. (*b*) It is that
of the nine-syllabled Mantra. (*c*) [It](errata.htm#9) is that indicated
by the letters composing the Mantra. For instance Varadā-Tantra says
that in 'Krīṁ', K is Kālī, R is Brahmā, I is Mahāmāyā, Nāda is the
Matrix of the universe and Bindu is the Dispeller of Sorrow. In 'Hūṁ', H
is Śiva, Ū is Bhairava, Nāda means the Supreme and Bindu is the
Dispeller of Sorrow. In Hrīṁ, H is Śiva, R is Prakṛti,

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I is Mahāmāyā,
Nāda the Generatrix by the Universe and Bindu the dispeller of pain.
Contemplation on Mantras constituted of these letters reveals their
Caitanya. Japa of Mantra without knowing its Caitanya is useless.\]

*'Become themselves' (Kāmarūpā bhavanti)*

They acquire the power of assuming whatever form they desire and of
charming the whole world with their beauty.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[56:1](htk09.htm#fr_43) <span id="page_58">p.
58</span> That is, *Ka*.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[56:2](htk09.htm#fr_44) Deva of Fire, or *Ra*.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[56:3](htk09.htm#fr_45) Śakti of Kama, God of
love, or long Ī.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[56:4](htk09.htm#fr_46) The moon, or
*Nāda-bindu*. The Bīja is, therefore, *K* + *r* + *ī* + *ṁ* = *Krīṁ*.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[56:5](htk09.htm#fr_47) That is, *Hūṁ*.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[56:6](htk09.htm#fr_48) *Hrīṁ*, literal meaning
of *Lajjā*, is modesty.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[56:7](htk09.htm#fr_49) Or Svāhā, Śakti of Agni.
The *mantra* is, then, *Krīṁ, Krīṁ, Krīṁ, Hūṁ, Hūṁ, Hūṁ, Hrīṁ Svāhā*, or
the nine-lettered *Vidyā*, or feminine *mantra*, which ends with *Svāhā*
(see Viśvasāra-Tantra).

<span id="fn_50"></span>[56:8](htk09.htm#fr_50) *Smarahara* or *Siva*,
who destroyed Manmatha with fire from his central eye of wisdom when the
latter sought to distract him by passion from his *Yoga*. The Devī,
according to the Brahmavaivarta-Purāṇa, restored Manmatha to life (see
as to this Bhāskararāya's Commentary on the Lalitā, verse 34).

<span id="fn_51"></span>[56:9](htk09.htm#fr_51) *Svarūpaṁ*, that is true
form as described in the first and other verses (V).

<span id="fn_52"></span>[56:10](htk09.htm#fr_52) *Lakṣmī* is associated
with, holds, and stands on the lotus, hence Her titles—Kamalā, Padmā,
*Padmālayā*, *Padmadhārini* (see Lakṣmīstotra in Tantrasāra, p. 577,
Rasik Mohan Chatterjee's edition).
