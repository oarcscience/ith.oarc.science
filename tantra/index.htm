<P>
These texts describe the esoteric teachings of Tantra, a belief
system which originated in India, praticed by a small number
of Hindus and Buddhists.
Tantra has become a synonym in the West for unbridled sexuality;
however sexuality <I>per se</I> is only one facet of
this elaborate spiritual practice,
as a representation of the union of the soul with the Goddess.
Rather, this attitude reflects the spiritual vacuum of mainstream Western
religions when it comes to sacred sexuality.
A deep study of Tantra can take a lifetime, and is not for the undisciplined
or the thrill-seeker.
</P>

<P>
Tantra does not advocate an epicurian or libertine
philosophy.  Quite the contrary, the practices which involve behavior
which is regarded by conventional Hinduism as 'sinful'
(such as eating meat, drinking alcohol, and having sexual union),
normally requiring expatiatory behavior,
are supposed to only be engaged in by spiritually advanced
practicioners in the appropriate ritual context.
A set of alternative practices are recommended by Tantra for general use
(substituting sweets for meat, and praying and chanting for sexual union).
(It should also be noted the Hindu concept which we describe here as sin is
somewhat different than the Christian version).
</P>

<P>
Taken with these caveats, the assertion of Tantra that sexual energy
can be harnessed to achieve union with the divine is fairly unique
among world religions.  The encounter with
this school of thought by western occultists
had a profound impact on the development of
modern <A HREF="../pag/index.htm">Neo-paganism</A>.

The Tantra of the Great Liberation:
Translated by <span class="c_a">Arthur Avalon</span>
(Sir <span class="c_a">John Woodroffe</span>)
[<span class="c_d">1913</span>] &emsp; <span class="c_b">The best known of the Tantric scriptures.</span>
It was translated by Sir John Woodruffe (under
the pseudonym 'Arthur Avalon'), one of the few Indologists to
gain direct access to this obscure and secretive branch of Hinduism.
Framed as a conversation between the god Shiva and goddess Shaki,
this text describes the chakra, or subtle energy structure of the
human body, ceremonies, yogic practices and mantras for meditation,
and a summary of the Hindu laws (<I>dharma</I>) regarding sexual behavior.
</P>

<P>
The text of the Mahanirvana Tantra has been
suspected to be partially or completely
fabricated by Hariharanandanatha to support his reformist views, and
apparently dates to the 18th Century A.D.  This is not to say that it is
invalid, just that it is a comparatively recent text which
puts forward an unorthodox branch of Hinduism.  This should be kept
in mind when reading it.
