# CHAPTER VII

### MAGIC AND MEDICINE

Kakadu tribe.--Tjilaiyu ceremony.--Evil magic by means of burning korno
or excrement.--Capturing the yalmuru of the victim.--Evil magic by means
of securing a fragment of the victim's food.--Eating pounded ant-hill as
cure for disease.--Evil magic by means of mud scraped from the victim's
foot.--Magic ceremony to strengthen a boy.

IN the Kakadu tribe there is a very curious form of magic, the ceremony
connected with which is called *Tjilaiyu*. It is concerned with injuring
a person by means of dealing in a very special way with some of his
excrement or *korno*. Because of this, everyone is most careful to cover
over and hide from view all excrementa, one result of which is that
Kakadu camps are more cleanly than those of many other tribes. It is
not, however, a difficult matter for a man who wishes to injure an enemy
to secure some *korno*. A medicine man, for example, will find out where
it is buried and then, when no one is watching, he will go to the place
and rake a little into a piece of bark with a stick, because it must not
be touched. There are always at least three men who take part in the
ceremony. The man who has secured the *korno* hands it, in the bark, to
one of the others, who ties it round with string. It is then taken away
from the camp out

{p. 258}

into the bush to a quiet spot where no one is likely to come. The
performers have previously provided them. selves with a supply of wax,
both beeswax and a kind of resin, called *kapei*, derived from the root
of the iron-wood tree. They make five little spherical balls, one of
*kapei* and four of beeswax. The first named is about three inches in
diameter, the others one inch. These are called *jungana*. They are all
hollow, or, rather, each has a hole pressed into it by the thumb. A pit
is dug in the ground about two feet in diameter. It is called *narul*,
and is just the same as the one made for an ordinary earth oven or
*peindi*. A fire is lighted in it and this must be made on the spot by
rubbing one stick on another. The red-hot tinder must also be wafted
about on paper bark until it bursts into a blaze; it must not be blown
by the mouth. The fire itself, when once it has been lighted, must be
fanned by a lubra holding a *norkun*, or goose wing, in her left hand.
The stones are then placed on the fire. Before this, however, the
*korno* has been finely ground up and put in the wax spheres, which are
then closed over and placed to one side of the hole. A shallow trench
called *ye-eini* is made, about twelve feet long, with the soil heaped
up on each side. It is broadest at the end where the pit has been dug
and tapers away to the other end. The performers squat down at one side
of the fire, the men in a line, one behind the other, the woman slightly
to one side (Fig. 64). The general arrangement can be seen in Plate XI.

When the fire is hot enough the real performance begins. The men bend
forwards, each of them with his hands between his legs, the woman does
the same because the spirit must not, on any account, see their private
parts. If it were to do so they would swell enormously. The stones are
removed from the fire and, first of all,

{p. 259}

the feathers are knocked into the latter, one by one, the natives saying
"keep quiet, keep quiet," the idea being that the birds they represent
will thereby be persuaded not to give notice to the victim that any
danger such as a snake or crocodile threatens him. Then the men sway
about, looking as fierce as they possibly can, while they place the wax
spheres in the *piendi*, the *kapei* below the smaller ones. Away in the
distance they can hear the spirit cursing and swearing, saying
*mulyarinyu koiyu*\[1\] and using other opprobrious expressions. The men
say *nerk, nerk, nerk,* and beckon it onwards. It is under a spell and
comes on cursing more and more loudly. When it is near, the natives
crouch down silently, the front man ready for action. On it comes like a
whirlwind, rushes along the trench, scraping against the sharp Pandanus
leaves. Suddenly, when it reaches the brink of the peindi, the front man
knocks the stick representing it into the fire on the top of the korno.
All of them shout, *Ah, Ah, Ah; Ach, Ach, Brng, Brng!* at the top of
their voices. Without a moment's pause, stones and earth are piled on
the Yalmuru, one special large stone being placed on top, the men
pressing down hard with all their might to keep it in. The spirit
underneath can be heard sizzling and swearing (Fig. 65). It tries to
lift the stone but cannot. At length it is heard to say *Grr, Grr, u-u*.
Then it is quiet and all is over. The Pandanus leaves are rubbed against
the top stone, while the names of different snakes, Ngabadaua,
Yidaburabara and Numberanerji, are hissed out. One or other of them are
supposed to be sure to bite the victim before long. Finally a log of
wood that is supposed to represent a

men when angry and excited. This particular one consists in cursing
their mother; others are still more opprobrious and objectionable. Such
expressions are met with in all the tribes.\]

crocodile, which it is hoped will seize him some day when he is bathing,
is placed on top and then, when the performers have smeared their bodies
over with burnt cork-wood and grass, the ceremony is at an end, and they
go back to camp. Anyone coming across the remains of the trench, and
seeing the stones and log piled up above the small mound, knows that
evil magic has been performed. It is supposed that, by the capture of
the Yalmuru, the man is left without his protector. If, for example, he
be out in the bush, there will be no spirit to warn him of approaching
danger, or guide him to where he can secure his food.

Another form of practising evil magic amongst the Kakadu consists in a
man who desires to injure an enemy securing some fragment of food that
the latter has been eating. First of all he ties it up in paper bark and
takes it away, unknown to anyone else, to his own camp where he pounds
it up and sings over it, thereby projecting evil magic into it. Then he
ties it up again and takes it to an ant hill, at the base of which he
makes a small hole, pushes the food inside, and closes the hole so that
it cannot be seen. This form of magic is supposed to be very effective
and to act rapidly. Within three days the man becomes very hot,
continually cries out for water and soon dies.

It is curious to note that, conversely, pounded ant hill, called
*Mupulangu*, is eaten as a cure for certain diseases such as fevers.
While, one day, we were in the Kakadu camp, we came across a woman named
Minborku, who was in the act of eating some. She was evidently suffering
from a mild attack of malarial fever and had perfect faith in the
efficacy of the remedy.

Still another form of evil magic is associated with the mud that
attaches itself to the foot of a native

{p. 261}

walking through a swamp. When he comes on to dry ground he naturally
scrapes the mud off, generally using something such as a piece of paper
bark to do so. if another man, who wishes to injure him, comes across
his tracks, he gathers up some of the mud or paper bark to which it is
attached. He wraps it in some more paper bark and ties it round with
string. In his camp, when it is quite dry, he pounds it up until he can
roll it into a ball and then, as in the previous case, places it in a
hole that be makes n the base of an ant hill. By and by the victim's
foot breaks out into sores which gradually spread all over it. The toes
drop off, and the hands and feet decay. No medicine man can do anything
to counteract this form of magic. It is a disease which is every now and
then met with amongst the Kakadu natives and is, superficially at least,
suggestive of leprosy. There was, at the time of my visit, one woman in
the camp who was suffering from it, and Mr. Cahill told me that he had
seen many cases.

In the Kakadu tribe there is also a magical ceremony, the object of
which is to strengthen a boy who happens to be weakly and undergrown.
His father, father's brother, or his elder brother, secures a little of
the korno or excrement of some strong man. The performers, who always
include the boy and his father and a young mature woman who has not as
yet borne a child, go to some quiet spot in the scrub where they are
well out of sight of the camp. Here a fire is lighted in a hole dug in
the ground. This fire must be made on the spot by means of *Ingornu* or
drilling fire-sticks. The korno Is finely pounded up and placed in a
little sphere of *kapei*, that is, resin derived from the root of the
Iron-wood tree. Enclosed in the wax the korno is then placed on the
fire. The fire while being made must be fanned

{p. 262}

by a *norkun* or goosewing held by the woman in he, left hand. The boy
sits down close behind his father, whom he clasps round the waist,
looking over his father's shoulder at the fire. The woman sits to one
side. The fire is covered over while the *korno* is burnt and the father
hits the boy with a little bundle of paper bark called *Yailla*, saying
as he does so, *Phu, Phu, jereini kumerawardua*; then he rubs his son,
saying as he does so, *Ngoornberi kumerawardua*, after which he strikes
him on the shoulder, saying, *Phu, phu, umberabadua jereini*, grow tall
man; finally, he hits him very hard, saying, *pierda nugorto*, strong
arm; *balera yinyimma jereini pierda*, by and by you strong man. When
all is over the burnt *korno* is taken out, and together with the norkun
is placed, as the natives say, *Iwaji jiboulu*, that is, inside a hollow
tree and left there. The man whose *korno* has been used is supposed to
part with his strength to the boy and to die.
