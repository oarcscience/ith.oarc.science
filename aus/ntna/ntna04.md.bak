Mudburra, Port Essington, Larakia, Worgait, Djauan, Nullakun, Mungarai.

THERE are very wide differences between various tribes in regard to
Organisation, and it is interesting to notice that, what are presumably
the most modified tribes, are met with on the far northern coastal
districts and on Melville and Bathurst Islands. At the other extremity
of Australia, in its extreme south-eastern corner, we meet with equally
modified tribes, or did so until some years ago. In both parts--the
north and the south--the most striking feature is that there is no trace
left of classes, or at most a very doubtful one, and that the
organisation is essentially a local one, with, in the north, an
attendant, well-marked totemic system.

{p. 43}

The tribes we are now dealing with may be divided into two main groups:
(A) those without class organisation, and (B) those with class
organisation.

\(A\) TRIBES WITHOUT CLASS ORGANISATION.

\(1\) *Bathurst and Melville Islands*.

These two islands are inhabited by a tribe of wild and, physically,
remarkably well-developed natives, who are easily distinguishable from
all others by the way in which they ornament their bodies with a series
of V-shaped cicatrices, which they call *Miunga*, and are supposed to
represent the barbs on their heavy spears. So far as my experience goes,
the marks on these Islanders are the only ones which serve to identify
the particular tribe to which any special individual belongs. From the
region of Lake Eyre in the south, across the continent to Darwin and
away east to the Gulf of Carpentaria, though all natives are more or
less marked with cicatrices, there is nothing in them which is in any
way distinctive of totem, class or particular tribe. The nearest
approach to anything of this kind are the cuts made on the backs of
adult men in the Urabunna, Dieri, Wonkgongaru and other tribes, who have
passed through the Wilyaru, or its equivalent, final initiation
ceremony. These marks, however, are characteristic of the whole of the
Dieri nation and not of any class or special tribe. The Melville and
Bathurst Islanders can, however, always be distinguished, and the fact
that they can serves to emphasise still more strongly the absence of any
such possibility in the case of all the mainland tribes in Central and
Northern Australia.

Despite repeated inquiries, I have not been able to find out any true
tribal name for the islanders. There are definite and well-known names
applied to local groups,

{p. 44}

but, though doubtless it exists, I tried in vain to find out a name
equivalent to that of Larakia or Kakadu. My informants, also, knew of
the existence of these and other tribal names on the mainland. It is
astonishing how difficult it often is to get reliable information in
regard to a subject such as this, where there is, apparently, no
question of the matter being of a sacred or secret nature. As a matter
of fact, in all tribes the tribal name is not

Bathurst Island](img/04400.jpg.md)

ISLANDS.

groups given in the text.

often used and, very often, there is one name applied by the members to
themselves and quite a different one by outsiders. The Larakia natives
at Darwin speak of Bathurst and Melville as Wongok; the natives on the
latter call both the mainland and the natives there Jeruula. The natives
at Cape Donn, near Essington, call Melville Island, which they can see
across the water, Wamuk,

{p. 45}

The natives, on both Bathurst and Melville Islands, are divided into a
series of local groups, each of which is supposed to occupy and own a
special well-defined district. These districts are indicated on the
accompanying map. Though their language, customs and beliefs are
identical, there is only a certain amount of intercourse between the
natives of the two islands, who are, at least, mutually distrustful of
one another. Every now and then the men from a camp on one side of
Apsley Strait will raid a camp on the other.

The list of local groups on Melville Island is, I think, complete; that
on Bathurst probably is not. The numbers in the following list
correspond to those on the map. In each case the name in brackets is the
name of the local group inhabiting that locality. It will be noticed
that the name of the group is made by adding the suffix *ulla* to that
of the locality-

(*a*) Melville Island Groups.

\(1\) Mundiimbu (Mundiinibulla).  
(2) Ulobu (Ulobulla).  
(3) Arangijera (Arangijerulla).  
(4) Yeimbi (Yeimbulla).  
(5) Cherupu (Cherupulla).  
(6) Kambuambu (Kambuambulla).  
(7) Barranpunalli (Barranpunalliulla).  
(8) Munupu (Munupulla).  
(9) Purumunapu (Purumunapulla).  
(10) Mindalu (Mindaluulla).  
(11) Balauiungamba (Balauiungambulla).  
(12) Marungallambu (Marungallambulla).

(*b*) Bathurst Island Groups.

\(13\) Malauu (Malauulla).  
(14) Urongu (Urongulla).  
(15) Tchikalaua (Tchikalauulla).

The separation of the local groups from one another is very clearly
marked indeed if they come together for the performance of special
ceremonies, such as those connected

{p. 46}

with mourning. When I was last on Bathurst Island, watching these
ceremonies, there were representatives of two local groups present
called respectively Malauulla and Tjikalauulla. They camped some
distance away from one another, and though they foregathered during the
actual dancing, yet, immediately this was over, they separated.

I was unable to ascertain anything definite in regard to the marriage
system beyond the fact, as described in connection with the account of
totemic systems, that it is closely associated with and regulated by the
totemic groups, In some cases it is certainly concerned with the local
group, a man of one group taking as a wife a woman of another, who then
comes into his own group to which his children also belong, but, whether
this is always the case, I cannot say positively, though I believe it to
be so.

\(2\)

Iwaidji or Port Essington Tribe.

This tribe is evidently much modified. There are apparently three
divisions, called respectively Munbulkitj, Manjerojelli and Manjerawuli,
amongst whom the totemic groups are divided, very unequally, the first
having four, the second two and the third seven. Munbulkitj and
Manjerojelli marry Manjerawuli people and *vice versâ*, but members of
the two former may not intermarry. Whether the three divisions are the
vestiges of formerly existing classes it is impossible to say, and my
informants were quite clear that there are no more than these three. The
Port Essington tribe is allied to the Kakadu amongst whom there are very
strongly developed local groups, and it is quite possible that these
three groups are based on locality. The totem groups are strictly
exogamous, and descent of both local group (or division) and of totemic
group is in the female line.

{p. 47}

\(3\) *Kakadu Tribe*.

This is the representative of a number of tribes inhabiting the northern
coastal area, all of whom differ in important respects from the more
typical tribes with whom they are in contact on their inland borders.
Their distribution is shown on the map (page 44).

The tribe is not divided into moieties nor are there any classes. If
such were ever present, they have disappeared completely, leaving not a
trace behind them to indicate their former existence. The organisation
is now entirely local. In the far past time their mythic ancestor,
Imberombera, sent out different pairs of individuals to various parts of
the country, now occupied by the Kakadu and other tribes of the same
nation. In these places they formed local centres, peopled, at first,
with spirit individuals who have since been undergoing reincarnation.
Tradition explains how, in the early days, the members of different
local groups intermarried, and, at the present time, just as then, each
individual man secures his wife, or wives. from some special local
group. The totem group has nothing to do with marriage.

An elder man frequently has several wives, of varying age, and there is
one method of allotment of wives which is, so far as I am aware,
peculiar to this nation of tribes. I have not met with it in any of the
Central tribes nor does it seem to have been noted elsewhere in
Australia.

This method consists in the allotment to a man of a woman who belongs to
the generation immediately senior to himself, and who stands to him in
the relationship of *Koiyu*, that is, father's wife, or *Ngaila*,
mother's brother's wife. The Koiyu women, of course, include his own
actual mother, but that particular woman may not be allotted to him.

{p. 48}

The table on page 49 represents two actual cases of this, which, though
strange, appears to be a well-recognised practice in these tribes.

Nabanja and Tjilongogo were brothers and Ungaraerria was a tribal
brother, one of whose wives was a young woman named Kumbainba, who had a
son named Mukalakki.

Tjilongogo had a son named Monmuna. The latter had seven wives, but, as
shown in the table which includes all his family, he had remarkably few
children.

\[1\]

Amongst his wives he had two, called respectively Allarima (1) and
Kumbainba (3), who had once belonged to two men who were his
papa-fathers or fathers' brothers. Kumbainba had been married to a man
named Ungara-erria and, by him, had a son named Mukalakki. She was still
young when she was handed on to Monmuna.

Monmuna, by his wife, Mumungara, had a son named Nulwoiyu, who is still
a mere boy.

Nabanja had a son named Kulingepu-kunamullajumbo, who, amongst others,
married a woman named Wareiya, by whom he had a son named
Ungara-mulyarami and a daughter named Koetto.

Ungara has two wives called, respectively, Mumulandi and Mitjingari.
Koetto is married to Kulanyo-jarraman, by whom she has three sons,
Kadjimuk, Burnimakori and Wudeirti.

When Kumbainba (3) was allotted as wife to Monmuna, Mukalakki became
*Ngoornberri*, or son, to the latter; *Nullaberri*, or younger brother.
to Ungara-mulyarami, because the latter was a son of a Baranga or elder

\[1. The relatively small number of children is not infrequently to be
noticed amongst these tribes. While I was at Oenpelli a man of Geimbio
tribe, closely allied to the Kakadu, came into camp with family
including six wives, but only four children. The age of the wives must
have varied from fifteen to fifty.\]

{p. 49}

![Genealogical Chart](img/04900.jpg.md)

{p. 50}

brother of Monmuna; and *Baranga* or elder brother to Nulwoiyu.

When Monmuna died, the *jaidja* (mother's brothers) of the women
concerned, told Numerialmak (5) to go to Mukalakki as his wife, which
she did, and Kumbainba (3) to go to Ungara as his wife, which she did.
Both of these men have other wives, given to them by the fathers of the
women, but the *jaidja* of any woman can allot her to one of the sons of
her husband, provided she be not that son's actual mother.

These arrangements are made before the death of any man, such as, in
this case, Monmuna, and they affect the terms of relationship used. Thus
Mukalakki calls Allarima, Gudjukatju, Kumbainba, Mimonau, Niniokolura
and Mumungara, *koiyu*, or mother, but Numerialmak he calls
*ngunkomukali*, or wife, and he actually applied this term to her while
the old Monmuna was alive, though she was not then in his possession and
he had no marital relations with her. Mukalakki calls Numerialmak's
brother *muraguji*, or wife's brother. If she had had any children by
Monmuna he would have called them *nullaberi*, younger brother, or
*illaberri*, younger sister while Monmuna was alive, and *ngoornberri*,
sons, or *ngungornberri*, daughters, after his death. So again, he calls
the father of each of the first above-named six women, *peipi*, or
mother's father, but the father of Numerialmak he calls *keerli*, or
wife's father. Further still, Ungara was *baranga*, or elder brother, of
Mukalakki, but, when Numerialmak, the actual mother of Mukalakki, was
allotted to Ungara as wife, Mukalakki called him *papa*, or father.
These two men, Ungara and Mukalakki, were constantly with Mr. Cahill and
myself, at Oenpelli, so that we had every opportunity of hearing them
speak to one another.

{p. 51}

Numerialmak calls Mukalakki *ngunkomukali*, or husband, just as she did
Monmuna, and applies the same term to Nulwoiyu because, if Mukalakki had
died before Monmuna did, she would have been allotted to Nulwoiyu. She
calls Allarima and Kumbainba, who had been allotted to Monmuna and
belong to a generation senior to her own, *ngailor*, or father's
sisters. She calls Gudjakatji and Mimonau *makorngo*, that is elder
sisters; Niniokolura and Mumungara she calls *illaberri*, or younger
sisters.

Ungara calls all the women, except Kumbainba, *koiyu*, or mother, but he
calls her *ngunkomukali*, or wife, because she was allotted to him, and
she also calls him *ngunkomukali*, or husband. Ungara also calls the
fathers of all the women, save Kumbainba, *peipi*, or mother's father,
the father of Kumbainba he calls *keerli*, or wife's father.

Kunamullajumbo also had, as one of his wives, a woman who had been the
wife of his father Nabaiya, and Ungara called that woman *koiyu*.

There was also living in camp a man named Mitjeriunga who has a wife
named Workerlaki who has been allotted to the son of the former named
Mitjeralak. The latter calls the woman *ngunkomukali*, and she applies
this term to both of them.

Ungara has a son to whom, in the future, a wife belonging to Nulwoiyu
will be allotted, and that son calls Ungara *papa*.

This handing on of a woman to a man who is at the level of her son, is
always done by the woman's mother's .brothers. For example, as
Numerialmak herself told us, It was her father who gave her to Monmuna,
but her *jaidja* who told her to go to Mukalakki. She was very much
younger than Monmuna, and does not appear to be any older than
Mukalakki.

When a man dies, beyond the special allotment to men

{p. 52}

on the level of sons, the widows normally pass to younger brothers of
the dead man, not to older ones. Thus, recently, the man named in the
table Kulanyo-yarraman died. He had an elder brother, called
Mappleburra, and a younger one, Kopereik. When Kulanyo-yarraman died
Kopereik was away and Mappleburra took the lubra Koetto, but when
Kopereik returned, the first thing that he did was to go and take the
woman away from Mapplebura. Again, Mukalakki has a wife called
Mitchunga, who, it is already arranged, will go to Nulwoiyu on
Mukalakki's death.

As an example of the allotment of a mother's brother's wife we may take
the case of Ungara-mulyurami. His brothers are dead and he has no sons,
so it has been arranged that, on his death, Mitchingari, one of his
wives, is to pass to Kadjimuk, or, should he die, to Wudeirti, both of
whom are sons of Ungara's sister named Koetto, Each of these men calls
Mumulandi *ngailor*, that is, father's sister, but Mitchingari they call
*ngunkomukali*.

It will easily be understood that this curious system of allotment and,
consequently, of change of terms of relationship, produces extraordinary
complications, but the natives appear to find no difficulty in working
the system, and when in camp they will tell you readily the relationship
of all the different members present to one another.

To the same group of tribes belong, apparently, the Koarnbut, Quiradara,
Norweilemil, Punuurlu, Kumertuo, Geimbio, Malanji, and, possibly, the
Larakia. These, together with the Iwaidji, Kakadu, and the Melville an
Bathurst Islanders, form a group of tribes sharply marked off, not only
by the absence of class organisation, but by the fact that their
initiation ceremonies at' distinguished by the absence of both
circumcision and subincision.

{p. 53}

(B). TRIBES WITH CLASS ORGANISATION.

(*a*) *Tribes with indirect male descent*.

(1). Warrai tribe. This is a tribe usually called Wolwonga by whites. It
is now entirely decadent, its remnant occupying the country between a
place called Rum Jungle and Brock's Creek on the short railway line that
runs south from Darwin.

The tribe is divided into four classes, and there are no names for the
moieties. The organisation is as follows, the names of women's groups,
corresponding to those of the men, being placed in brackets:--

An Adjumbitj man marries an Allpungerti woman, and the children are
Appularan (males) and Allpularan (females).

An Appularan man marries an Allinmitj woman, and the children are
Adjumbitj (males) and Alljambitj (females).

An Appungerti man marries an Alljamjbitj {*sic*} woman, and the children
are Auinmitj (males) and Allimitj (females).

An Auinmitj man marries an Allpularan woman, and the children are
Appungerti (males) and Allpungerti (females).

Except that there are distinct names for women, which

{p. 54}

are slight variants on those for the men, the organisation is closely
similar to that of the southern Arunta, where there are only four class
names. It must, however, be remembered that, though there are only four
such names, yet, in all tribes in which this is so, each of them is
divided into two groups so that, for example, one group of Adjumbitj men
intermarry with only one group of Allpungerti women, the other group of
the latter women are forbidden to these men. In most tribes distinct
names are given to the two groups, so that there are eight in all.

It is somewhat remarkable to find two tribes, each with the four, named,
intermarrying groups, one at each end of the long stretch of country, a
thousand miles in all, that lies between the southernmost Arunta and the
Warrai in the north. In all these tribes the organisation is
fundamentally identical, but it is only at the extreme northern and
southern limits that we find only four class names, elsewhere there are
always eight.

The northern boundary of the Warrai tribe is coterminous with the
southern of the coastal tribes--in this particular part the Larakia,
though the latter has long been practically decimated, its degraded
remnants hanging about the settlements. It is also a curious
circumstance that the Arunta people have a very definite tradition of a
great leader who, in the far past time, led a body of uncircumcised men
away out of the Arunta country and travelled on with them until they
came to the salt water in the far north. On the shores of the latter
they camped and are supposed to have remained there ever since.

(2). Waduman tribe.

The names of the moieties have been lost. There are distinct sub-class
names for males and females and

{p. 55}

intermarrying sub-classes such as Uanai and Urella are spoken of as
being *Tjimuri* or mates.

The names of the female sub-classes are in brackets.

\(7\) Mungarai Tribe.

The names of the moieties are retained. Those of the sub-classes are as
follows and, in brackets, I have given the corresponding ones of the
Djauan tribe.

|                            |                        |

{p. 59}

The inter-marrying sub-classes and those of the children are as
represented in the following table:

|                        |                        |               |            |
|------------------------|------------------------|---------------|------------|
| Moiety 1.--Makarangua. | Moiety 2.--Ngaballana. | Children.     | Children.  |
| Ngaritjbellan          | Ngaburella             | Ngapungari    | Nakomara   |
| Ngabullan              | Ngangiella             | Ngapalieri    | Tjabijin   |
| Ngapalieri             | Nakomara               | Ngabullan     | Ngaburella |
| Ngapungari             | Tjabijin               | Ngaritjbellan | Ngangiella |

 

A Ngaritjbellan man marries a Ngaburella woman and their children are
Ngapungari, A Ngaburella man marries a Ngaritjbellan woman and their
children are Nakomara.

There is nothing special about these tribes to distinguish them, so far
as their classificatory systems are concerned, from the great group,
extending from Oodnadatta in the south to Brocks Creek, within 100 miles
of the northern coast line. Eastwards they extend across to the
borderland of Queensland and the coastal ranges fringing the Gulf of
Carpentaria. Westwards they stretch down the Daly, Katherine, Flora, and
Victoria Rivers to the coast and, probably, extend into the northern
parts of West Australia. Mrs. Bates and Mr. A. R. Brown have shown that
tribes with the four-class system., similar in essential respects to the
southern Arunta and the Warrai, extend over wide areas in Western
Australia. In all these tribes, descent of the class is counted in the
paternal line.

We have previously dealt in detail with the Arunta and Warramunga
Tribes,<sup>\[1\]</sup> and what we have described in

\[1. Cf. *Native Tribes of Central Australia*, Chap. III., and *Northern
Tribes of Central Australia*, Chap. III., p. 104-132.\]

{p. 60}

connection with them holds good, precisely, for the others.

(*b*) *Tribes with direct male descent*.

\(1\) Mara Tribe.

This is an example of a group of tribes the organisation of which was
first dealt with by Mr. Gillen and myself.<sup>\[1\]</sup> We came in
contact with some members of it at Borroloola on the Gulf of Carpentaria
in 1901. During 1911, whilst travelling down the Roper River, I again
encountered the tribe, and with the aid of a very intelligent native, a
Mumbali man named Waluunja, was able, after considerable inquiry, to
determine the correspondence of the sub-classes of this tribe, in which
descent, so far as the actual class name is concerned, is counted in the
direct male line, with those in the adjoining Mungarai tribe, in which
descent is counted in the indirect male line. I was also able to
ascertain the names of the moieties.

These are, as shown in the following table, four class and no sub-class
names.

TABLE 1.

|                    |                   |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Moiety 1.--Muluri. | Moiety 2.-Umbana. |
| Murungun           | Purdal            |
| Mumbali            | Kuial             |

 

Further inquiry, however, shows that, though there are no distinct names
for them, each class is really divided into two groups-the equivalents
of the sub-classes in the Arunta and Warramunga. They are, in fact,
precisely similar to the unnamed groups into which each class is

\[1. Spencer and Gillen, *The Northern Tribes of Central Australia*.\]

{p. 61}

divided in the southern half of the Arunta and in the Warrai tribe.

These can be represented, using the letters *a* and *b* {*in the
original text, a and b are the Greek letters alpha and beta--jbh*} to
indicate the two divisions of each class. as follows

TABLE 2.

|                    |                    |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Moiety 1.--Muluri. | Moiety 2.--Umbana. |
| Murungun *a*       | Purdal *a*         |
| Murungun *b*       | Purdal *b*         |
| Mumbali *a*        | Kuial *a*          |
| Mumbali *b*        | Kuial *b*          |

 

When, however, we come to deal with the marriage relationships and the
counting of descent it will be seen that these are very different from
those met with in adjoining tribes, amongst whom the arrangements are
similar to those amongst the Warramunga. The intermarrying groups, which
are really the equivalents of subclasses, together with those into which
the children pass, can be represented as follows:

TABLE 3.

|                   |                    |              |            |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|------------|
| Moiety 1--Muluri. | Moiety 2.--Umbana. | Children.    | Children.  |
| Murungun *a*      | Purdal *a*         | Murungun *b* | Purdal *b* |
| Murungun *b*      | Kuial *b*          | Murungun *a* | Kuial *a*  |
| Mumbali *a*       | Kuial *a*          | Mumbali *b*  | Kuial *b*  |
| Mumbali *b*       | Purdal *b*         | Mumbali *a*  | Purdal *a* |

 

{p. 62}

A Murungun *a* man must marry a Purdal *a* woman and their children are
Murungun *b*. So again a Murungun *b* man must marry a Kuial *b* woman
and their children are Murungun *a*.

The children of a Murungun man are thus always Murungun. Some Murungun
men marry Purdal and others Kuial women, the marriage alternating in
successive generations. Thus a Murungun *a* man marries a Purdal *a*
woman, but his son, who is Murungun *b*, marries a Kuial *b* woman. The
sons in the next generation are Murungun *a* and marry, once more,
Purdal *a* women.

The fact of some Murungun and Mumbali men marrying Purdal and others
Kuial women, and *vice versâ*, was so different from anything in the
marriage arrangements in any other Australian tribes known to us that
we, spent much time in investigating the matter and making ourselves as
sure as we could on the point. I am glad to be able now to corroborate
our previous conclusions by means of evidence collected in quite another
part of the tribe from that in which Mr. Gillen and myself previously
worked.

The native, Waluunja, who explained the matter to me on the Roper River,
was one of the most intelligent aboriginals whom I have met; he had also
a very fair I knowledge of English. The contrast between him and other
old men from whom I was, at the same time, attempting to get information
on the organisation of the tribes was most striking and made me feel
more than ever convinced that matters such as the division of the tribe
into intermarrying groups could very well be the result of the
deliberate thinking out of a scheme on the part of certain members of
the tribe more highly gifted than the common run. The scheme by means of
which the divisions, Murungun *a*, *b*, etc., are made to fit

{p. 63}

in with the sub-classes of the Mungarai and other tribes with which the
Mara come into contact, is at all events both a deliberate and ingenious
device, and reveals very considerable powers of reasoning and
organising. It can be represented in the following table in which the
names of the equivalent sub-classes in the Mungarai Tribe are placed in
brackets:--

This means that the class Murungun, for example, is divided into two
groups, which are regarded, respectively, as the equivalents of the
sub-classes Ngaritjbellan and Ngapungari in the Mungarai Tribe. We have
already seen that the children of Murungun *a* men pass into the
division Murungun *b*, which is just the same thing as in the Mungarai,
where the children of Ngaritjbellan men are Ngapungari, and *vice
versâ*. So, again, Murungun *a* men marry Purdal *a* and Murungun *b*
men marry Kuial *b* women. Now, under the scheme devised, Purdal *a*
women are the equivalents of Ngaburella and Kuial *b* of Tjabijin women
in the Mungarai Tribe. Murungun *a* men are the same as Ngaritjbellan
and they must marry

{p. 64}

Ngaburella women, while Murungun *b*, who are the equivalents of
Ngapungari, must marry Tjabijin.

\(2\) Nullakun Tribe.

In essential features this tribe agrees with the Mara, It has retained
the moiety names and has also four class but no sub-class names. In the
following table the equivalent names in the Mara tribe are given in
brackets:--

TABLE 1.

|                         |                       |

| Jobal (Murungun)        | Ulakaraninni (Purdal) |
| Mangaralli (Mumbali)    | Gindar (Kuial)        |

 

As in the Mara tribe, each class is really divided into two, though
there are no names for these, which are the strict equivalents of
sub-classes. Using the letters *a* and *b* to indicate these, the
intermarrying groups and those into which the children pass can be
represented as follows:--

TABLE 3.

|                         |                   |                |                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|

| Jobal *b*               | Gindar *b*        | Jobal *a*      | Gindar *a*       |
| Mangaralli *a*          | Gindar *a*        | Mangaralli *b* | Gindar *b*       |
| Mangaralli *b*          | Ulakarininni *b*  | Mangaralli *a* | Ulakarininni *a* |

 

{p. 65}

Where the Nullakun tribe comes into contact with the Mungarai and others
having the eight sub-class system, the same plan is adopted to allow the
two organisations to work side by side, which has already been described
dealing with the Mara tribe.

\[1. It is the *Unya* man who says to his *nugunyi* "you may have my
daughter as *alladik* when she is born." Betrothal often, indeed
usually, takes place before birth and the youth, from the betrothal
onwards, gives womeras, food, etc., to his prospective father-in-law.\]

STATUS TERMS.

In every tribe there are certain status terms which are applied to
different individuals at different times of their lives. They are as
follows

\(1\) *Kakadu tribe*.

 

<table data-cellspacing="0" data-border="0" data-cellpadding="9" width="798">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p><em>Male.</em></p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><em></em>
<p>Female.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>1. Baby: Bialilla.</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>Baby: Bialilla.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>2. Young boy: Mulakirri.</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>Young girl: Yingulakirri.<sup>[1]</sup></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>3. Boy, before initiation: Ningeri.</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>Girl, before marriage: Kupari medjauer.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>4. Young man, after initiation: Numulakirri.</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>Young married girl: Jereiwin.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>5. Middle-aged man: Ulanja.</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>Middle-aged woman: No special name. She is spoken of as jirongadda Murora, that is close up to, or getting on to, Murora.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>6. Old man: Murabulba.</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>Old woman: Murora.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

There is also a special term, Lekerungen, applied to old men who have
seen the Muraian Ceremony. This is evidently the equivalent of the term
Uliara, which is applied, in the Arunta tribe, to those who have passed
through the Engwura, the final initiation ceremony which admits the
relatively younger men to the ranks of the old Men.

\[1. This same term is applied to the menstrual flow, but the natives
said that it is applied also to girls.\]

<tr class="even">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>5. Young man while passing through the ceremony for the third time: Mikinyerti.</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>Young married woman: Murrakuburra.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>6. Man with children: Mikangula.</p></td>

<tr class="even">

</tbody>

Some of these terms are very much in evidence during the initiation
ceremonies, in fact it was only by witnessing these that I discovered
the status terms for girls, equivalent to those for boys. The terms
Marrukumana and Mikinyerti for boys and those of Mikijeruma and
Mikingyertinga for girls, seem to be used only during the actual
performance of the ceremony in connection with which they are applied.
