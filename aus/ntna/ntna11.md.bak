THE Kakadu and allied tribes have traditions which relate to two great
ancestors, one a woman named Imberombera, and the other a man named
Wuraka. Of these two, Imberombera is much the more important, and a
legend concerning her is met with in all of the

{p. 276}

tribes now occupying the Coburg Peninsula and the country drained by the
Alligator rivers.

Wuraka came from the west, walking through the sea. His feet were on the
bottom but he was so tall that his head was well above the surface of
the water. He landed at a place called Allukaladi, between what are now
known as Mts. Bidwell and Roe, both of which he made. His first sleeping
place, after coming out on to land, was at Woralia. He then came on to
Umurunguk and so to Adjerakuk and Aruwurkwain, at each of which he slept
one night.

The woman, Imberombera, also walked through the sea and landed at what
is now known as Malay Bay, the native name being Wungaran. She met
Wuraka at Arakwurkwain. Imberombera said to him, "Where are you going?"
He said, "I am going straight through the bush to the rising sun." The
first language they spoke was Iwaidja, that s, the language of the
people of Port Essington. Wuraka carried his penis, or *parla*, over his
shoulder. He said to Imberombera, *ngainma parla nungeroboama*, my penis
is too heavy; *ngainma wilalu jirongadda*, my camp is close by;
*ngeinyimma ngoro breikul*, you go a long way.

At that time there were no black-fellows. Imberombera wanted Wuraka to
come with her, but he was too tired and his penis was too heavy, so he
sat down where he was, and a great rock, called by the natives Wuraka,
and by the white men Tor Rock, arose to mark the spot, Imberombera had a
huge stomach in which she carried many children, and on her head she
wore a bamboo ring from which hung down numbers of dilly bags full of
yams. She also carried a very large stick or *wairbi*.

At a place called Marpur, close to where she and Wuraka met, she left
boy and girl spirit children and

{p. 277}

told them to speak Iwaidja. She also planted many yams there and said to
the children whom she left behind, *ungatidda jam*, these are good to
eat.

She went on to Muruni, leaving yams and spirit children, and told them
also to speak Iwaidja. From Muruni she went on, by way of Kumara, to
Areidjut, close to Mamul, on what is now called Cooper's Creek, which
runs into the sea to the north of the mouth of the East Alligator River.
At Mamul she left children, one boy being called Kominuuru, and told
them to speak the Umoriu language. The only food supply she left here
was Murarowa--a Cyprus bulb. She crossed the creek and went on to
Yiralka but left no children there. This was close to the East Alligator
River which she crossed and then came, in succession, to Jeri, Kumboyu,
Munguruburaira and Uramaijino, where she opened up her dilly bags and
scattered yams broadcast. She went on to Jaiyipali, where again she left
food supplies. She searched around for a good camping place and, first
of all, sat down in a water pool but the leeches came in numbers and
fastened themselves on her, so she came out of the water and decided to
camp on dry land, saying that she would go into the bush. Accordingly,
she did so and camped at Inbinjairi. Here she threw the seeds of the
bamboo, *Koulu*, in all directions and also left children, one of whom
was a boy named Kalangeit Nuana.

As she travelled along, Imberombera sent out various spirit children to
different parts of the country, telling them to speak different
languages. She sent them to ten places, in each case instructing them as
follows

\(1\) Gnaruk ngeinyimma tjikaru, gnoyo Koranger.  
(2) Watta ngeinyimma tjikaru, gnoro Kurnboyu.  
(3) Kakadu ngeinyimma tjikaru, gnoro Munganillida.  
(4) Witji ngeinyimma tjikaru, gnoro Miortu.  
(5) Puneitja ngeinyimma tjikaru, gnoro Jaijipali. {p. 278}  
(6) Koarnbut ngeinyimma tjikaru, gnoro Kapalgo.  
(7) Ngornbur ngeinyimma tjikaru, gnoro Illari.  
(8) Umbugwalur ngeinyimma tjikaru, gnoro Owe.  
(9) Djowei ngeinyimma tjikaru, gnoro Nauillanja.  
(10) Geimbio ngeinyimma tjikaru, gnoro Waimbi.

The first word in each of these is the name of language which the
children were to speak; ngeinyimma means you or yours; tjikaru is talk
or language; gnoro is go, and the last word is the name of the place to
which she sent them. Each of these places is regarded as the central
camping ground of their respective tribes.

Imberombera is thus supposed to have been the founder of the ten tribes
above named, all of whom, at the present day, inhabit the Coburg
Peninsula and the country east and west of this, for some distance,
along the coast line, as well as the inland parts drained by the East,
South, and West Alligator Rivers.

It is most extraordinary how detailed are the traditions in regard to
her and the individuals, some of whom she left in, or sent to, certain
local centres and others of whom she sent out from her last camping
place. In what follows I give details in regard to certain of these
individuals. They were told us by a native called Araiya whose memory
was wonderful. He is recognised as a great authority on these matters
and, after checking the lists and also comparing them with information
supplied in regard to other traditions, concerning the old ancestors, I
think that the information may be regarded as accurate. It will be seen
that he knew not only the principal people sent out by Imberombera from
her last camping place at Inbinjairi, but also the names of the
individuals in all the different local groups; he knew also whom they
respectively married and the totemic group to which each of them
belonged. It is, of course, quite possible that one or other of

{p. 279}

these local groups comprised more individuals than those whose names he
gave us.

So far as the Kakadu and allied tribes are concerned there appear to be
four groups of mythical ancestors:--

(*A*) Imberombera.  
(*B*) Pairs of men and women sent out by Imberombera from Inbinjairi.  
(*C*) Pairs of men and women sent out, at a subsequent time, by these
(*B*).  
(*D*) Individuals who had been left behind by Imberombera, or sent out
by her, in the form of spirit children, or Iwaiyus, to different places
when she travelled across the country.

It must be remembered that Imberombera is regarded as the original great
ancestor from whom all the others emanated. It was she who originally
walked over the country, making creeks, hills, animals, and plants, and
though, at a later period, others amongst the early ancestors took part
in the production and distribution of natives and different objects
associated with them, and took part, also, in such matters as the
distribution of totems, yet they one and all derived their powers, in
the first instance, from Imberombera and were supposed to be acting
under her instructions in everything that they did.

I have already dealt with Imberombera and will now deal with the other
groups; but, before doing this in detail, one point in connection with
the fourth and last (*D*) may be referred to. They form the original ten
groups of spirit children, all of whom emanated from Imberombera and, at
a later period, went inside the women sent out to various parts. They
have, ever since, been undergoing a series of reincarnations, each one
retaining, throughout, his or her original name. The men and women
included in *C* are really a special number of those in *D*, who were
incarnated at an earlier stage than the rest. The whole system, as
elaborated by the {p. 280} Kakadu, gives us the most complete
development of the reincarnation theory with which I am acquainted
amongst these tribes. Some idea of the definiteness of the traditions
may be gathered from the following account, given to us by three leading
Kakadu men, one of whom especially, as already said, is noted for his
superior knowledge in regard to these matters.

(*B*). Pairs of men and women sent out by Imberombera from Inbinjairi,
her final camping ground. There were five of these, as follows, the
letter m. indicating the man and f. the woman:--

\(1\) Kroaran (m.) and Munjerimala (f.), sent to Unbaringadamba.  
(2) Nuinadalulk (m.) and Pulamoki (f.), sent to Jaijipala.  
(3) Kuloma (m.) and Munganepa (f.) sent to Ingitpu.  
(4) Kormi (m.) and Mumaraerk (f.), sent to Karal.  
(5) Nowarna (m.) and Kumanangaira (f.), sent to Imbunijairi.

Each of these pairs had children, who again were sent out in pairs--five
also, just as in the first instance--and told to go to various parts of
the country to form what may be called local centres or groups. They
were sent to places already prepared by Imberombera for their reception,
and at which she had, during her travels, left, or to which she had
sent, spirit children. It will be seen that there is a fundamental
resemblance between this belief and that of the Arunta and other Central
tribes, such as the Warramunga, for example, but that, at the same time,
the traditions, which must once have had a common origin, have become
both more highly developed and, at the same time, more sharply defined
in the Kakadu and northern coastal tribes. The Arunta believe that the
old ancestors wandered over the country in groups, kangaroo men and
women in one, emu people in another, and so on, depositing spirit
children in various local centres. The Warramunga belief is that each

{p. 281}

totemic group had one great ancestor who followed a definite and well
known track as he wandered over the country. These ancestors made all
the country as they passed along and, at certain places, left spirit
children behind them. In the Kakadu there is, originally, just one great
ancestor--Imberombera--who, in the beginning, was really responsible for
everything. Possibly the myth concerning Wuraka may be the vestige of
older traditions which, as in the Warramunga, were concerned with many
wandering ancestors. In the Arunta and Warramunga tribes, each ancestor,
or group of ancestors, was, so to speak, responsible for one totemic
group, but in the Kakadu, Imberombera was responsible for all and she it
was who distributed everything to the first five pairs whom she sent
out. They, in their turn, acting always under instructions received from
Imberombera, sent out other individuals to other parts. Imberombera
herself was responsible for all the spirit children.

(*C*). Each of the five pairs sent out first by Imberombera, the names
of whom are given above, had children. The names of all of these are
carefully preserved, but it will suffice to give those of the supposed
offspring of one pair, Munjerimala and Kroaran. They were as follows:--

\(a\) Pundamunga (m.) and Maramma (f.), sent to Koreingin.  
(b) Miniorko (m.) and Japo (f.), sent to Kubarnbi.  
(c) Narapalo (m.) and Kolabiljailpinja (f.), sent to Munmileri.  
(d) Prienbi (m.) and Kurinuwalla (f.) sent to Kulapari.  
(e) Muraupu (m.) and Juluuperi (f.), sent to Kupperi.

(D). Each one of these pairs formed a local centre, where spirit
children of different totemic groups are mixed together, there being no
such local segregation of totemic groups as are met with in the Arunta.
These are the spirit children who were deposited, or sent out, in

{p. 282}

the first instance by Imberombera. Entering into the women of these
various pairs, they were born in human form. The term *Murumbudui* is
applied to these local centres. The same word also is used by a native
when he speaks of any place as "my country" and to the special spot
where his Iwaiyu and Yalmuru are supposed to live.

The following lists give the complete series of children born to the
different pairs of men and women sent out by Imberombera from
Inbinjairi, together with their totems.

(*a*). The children of Pundamunga and Maramma. The letter m. indicates a
man and f. a woman:--

It must be remembered that Imberombera is supposed to have given
instructions to the first series of pairs whom she sent out (Kroaran and
Minjerimala, etc.) telling them to go to certain places and there eat
the food supplies, yams, lilies, sugar-bag, etc., that she had made and
left behind for them. She also told them all about the Jereipunga, or
totems, and instructed them to give these names to the different spirit
children. They in their turn handed on the instructions to the pairs of
men and women whom they sent out.

At first the ancestors of the Kakadu group of tribes had no definite
marriage system, and at the present day they have no classificatory
system governing marriage

{p. 286}

such as is characteristic of what may be regarded as typical Australian
tribes. In this respect they stand in strong contrast to tribes such as
the Yungman, Warri, and others with whom they come into contact on the
south and west of their own country. Of the tribes on their eastern
boundaries we know nothing as yet. The Kakadu seem to differ in this
respect from neighbouring tribes as profoundly as they do in their
initiation rites. The only organisation that they appear to have is a
local one based upon the groups referred to above. Tradition says that
the head men of the groups talked the matter over amongst themselves and
decided to institute an exchange of lubras between their respective
groups. Pundamunga and Miniorko, for example, agreed upon this, so one
day Miniorko set out from his camp at Kubarnbi, taking with him Opeik, a
man, and Maringjanga, a woman. He walked between them as they journeyed
along to Pundamunga's camp at Koreingin, where he found the former
seated on the ground with Mukalakki, a man, on one side, and Kudbau, a
lubra, on the other. In both cases, of course, the man and woman, that
is, respectively, Opeik and Maringjanja, Mukalakki and Kudbau, were
supposed to be brother and sister. The three from the Kubarnbi camp sat
down immediately opposite the other three. The two women, Maringjanga
and Kudbau, had each of them a *norkun*, that is, a goose wing, which is
commonly used as a fan to keep flies off, in front of their faces so as
to prevent them from seeing their brothers, or from being seen by them.
Pundamunga said to Kudbau, *Yapo Opeik, ngomukali ngeinyimma, breikul
baranga*, go to Opeik, (he is) your *ngomukali* (husband), far away from
your elder brother. She accordingly went and sat behind him. In the same
way, Maringjanga was told by Miniorko to go and sit behind Mukalakki,
who was her proper husband. {p. 287} Maringjanga stayed with Mukalakki
in his camp at Koreingin, and Kudbau returned with Opeik to Kubarnbi.

When this little ceremony was over, Pundamunga went over to where
Miniorko was sitting, and said to him: *Nygeinyimma nungordua umbali*,
have you got plenty of women? Miniorko said, *ngainma ungornberri munna
wilalu ngainma umbali*, I have plenty of daughters there in my camp.
Pundamunga said, *kormilda mureyida*, to-morrow we will all go.
Accordingly, next day he set out, taking with him one lubra, named
Maringeya, and four men, Munmona, Kulungepa, Mupulbara, and Mudanga.
When they reached Kubarnbi they found Miniorko seated by himself with
the *gerewin* and *umulakirri*, that is, the men and women's camps, a
short distance behind him, far enough away for him not to be heard
unless he spoke loudly. The old man Pundamunga went and sat down beside
Miniorko; the four men he had brought with him squatted on the ground in
such a position that the two old men were between them and the camps.
Madingeya was by herself, a little to one side, with a *norkun* in front
of her face. Miniorko called a man named Muniali out of the men's camp,
and he came and sat down. Then Pundamunga, told Madingeya to go and sit
behind Miniali, because he was her proper husband, which she did. The
mother of Miniali said to him, *maba jamo jauo, ngeinyimma nungordua*,
which means, literally, son food you eat, your lubra; in other words,
she meant that the lubra would now provide him with food. The elder
brother, Opeik, who had already been provided with a wife, said to
*Miniali, illaberri, preya wilalu mungari jirongadda*, younger brother,
come and camp close by here. Pundamunga then called Monmuna up, and he
sat down. Miniorko called a lubra named {p. 288} Mukulora out of the
women's camp and told her to go and sit behind Monmuna, because he was
her proper husband. Then these two went some little distance away from
Opeik and Muniali, who did not invite them to come close to their camp
because the woman was Opeik's sister.

When this was over, Pundamunga, accompanied by Monmuna and Mukalora,
together with Kulingepu, Mupulbara and Mudanga, returned to Koreingin.
In this way, sooner or later, all the members of the local groups were
provided, respectively, with wives or husbands. The old leaders of the
local groups, who had received instructions, emanating originally from
Imberombera, finally determined the man or woman whom each individual
was to marry. At the present day the only organisation controlling
marriage in these tribes, so far as I could discover, is based on the
existence of these local groups. A man of any one local group takes his
wife, from the same local group from which the old ancestor, of whom he
is the reincarnation, originally derived his.

In the following table a complete list of the intermarriages of the
various men and women comprised in the Pundamunga-Naramma group is
given.

The information was given to Mr. Cahill and myself by the same man who
gave us that which is included in the foregoing lists, and whose memory
and knowledge in regard to these matters was most extraordinary.

TRADITION CONCERNING NUMEREJI, A GREAT SNAKE, THE KAKADU TRIBE. (Fig.
66, facing p. 313)

Numereji is the name of a great snake that figures largely in the
traditions of the Kakadu tribe. It appeared first at a place, called
Kumbulmorma, which lies on a wide, open plain between the East Alligator
River and Cooper's Creek. Not far away, at Yiringira, a large number of
natives were camped and, amongst them, was a baby, crying. The snake
came along with his head high in the air and said: *Waji bialilla, yana
waji bialilla*--there is a child crying, where is the child crying? It
turned its head round from side to side and went down into the ground,
then it came up again and circled round and round the camp. The child
was still crying and one native was blowing a trumpet. The snake then
put his head up close to the child and sucked it in. The natives were
terribly frightened and all started to run away, but Numereji folded his
tongue round each one in turn and licked them in, until he had devoured
them all save one old lubra, named Kominiyamana, who had climbed up into
a tree and kept quite quiet for a long time. Most unfortunately, the
mosquitoes were so thick that she could not help smacking herself, every
now and then, to kill them. Numereji listened and said, Hallo! there is
someone there, on top, He lifted up his head and sucked her in with his
long tongue. His stomach was now simply full of black fellows.

He travelled along on the top of the ground to a place called Maipolk on
the East Alligator River, arched his head up, put it down on the other
side, so that his body made a great bow across the river and then,
leaning on his head, swung his tail across. As he travelled along,

{p. 291}

saw some more natives but, though he went along, lying flat in the
ground and making as little noise as possible, he frightened a mob of
white cranes and cockatoos that rose, screaming, from the trees. The
natives of course saw them and knew that something must have disturbed
them. They went to see, saying, What is the matter, what has frightened
them? One native went ahead and shouted out Kuwi! Kuwi!<sup>\[1\]</sup>
Come here, come here. He had caught sight of Numereji and said to the
others when they came up, Look, what is the name of this big fellow?
Numereji was lying down resting, gorged with black fellows. A very large
number of natives came up. They all called out, *Ameina! Ameina!* What
is it? What is it? Those in front said to those behind, come up close
and look at the Morpiu.

\[2\]

Its belly was sunk deep in mud, but its back projected high in the air.
Numereji was so tired that he had gone to sleep. They all came close up
and one old man who had heard of him and what he was like, said, This is
Numereji. *Ah! Ah!* they said, is it? is it? This is the first time we
have seen him. The old man talked to the snake and said, What have you
been eating that your belly is so big? but the snake made no reply. Then
the old man accused him of having eaten the black fellows, saying,
*Urawalla jereini jau*--It is the Urawulla men that you have eaten. Then
Numereji awoke, lifted himself up, put down his head and vomited forth
the bones of all the men and women he had eaten. The bones have remained
there to this day in the form of stones.

Numereji then went on to a place called Mungeruauera, where he went into
the ground and there he remained.

\[1. This is pronounced in almost exactly the same way as the
characteristic Australian call, spelt, usually, Cooee.

2\. Morpiu is a general name for animals of any kind.\]

{p. 292}

TWO TRADITIONS CONCERNING NUMEREJI AND THE MEDICINE MEN.

\(1\)

There were four men, Joemin, an elder brother, and Numuraupu his younger
brother. Joemin had a son, called Mukurlul, and Numuraupu had one,
called Kardimenjil. Joemin had stolen a small Numereji snake which he
cut in two. The front half grew a new short tail, the hinder half died.
Joemin carried the front half under his arm. The old Numereji snake
remained in the creek at Mungeruauera, in fact, he is there still. The
medicine man can see him but the ordinary natives do not drink there
because they are afraid that, if they were to do so, Numereji would draw
them in and eat them.

When Joemin cut the little snake in two, he drank some of the blood that
flowed out, drained the rest into a shell, and then carried the latter
and the snake along with him. He came to a place called Mulipaji and
there he left some of the snake's blood, and made thereby a *kumali
wilalu*, that is a kumali or sacred camp. The natives call this part of
the country *wilalu manungel*, or blood country, and only medicine men
go there, the others are too frightened. If they were to go near to it
their fingers would break.

Joemin went to Mulipaji by himself and then returned to the others,
bringing the snake with him. His young brother, Numuraupu, said to him,
*Baranga brau morpiu koregora*, Brother, give me the snake to look at.
Before coming into the camp, Joemin had hidden the snake a little
distance away. First of all he rubbed his younger

{p. 293}

brother's eyes, or else the latter would not have been able to look at
the snake, and then went away and returned with the snake. When
Numuraupu looked at it, the snake opened his mouth and rattled his
teeth. Joemin said to Numuraupu, *Koregora pierda*, look hard.
Numereji's eyes were very large and bright. Joemin said, do not be
frightened, look at it hard and your eyes will be an right. Numuraupu
felt the snake with his fingers and said, it is very slippery. Joemin
said, *Illaberi, karu pierda kala, kularu kangu*, that is, young
brother, hold it firmly lift it up high. Numuraupu did as he was told
and lifted the snake with his arm underneath it. Numuraupu was very
frightened and trembled all over. Joemin said *Koyada kumari, kara
pierda kala*, do not be frightened, hold it firmly. Numereji's mouth was
opened and his teeth were rattling. The snake looked at the camp and was
very angry or, as the natives call it, he was, *Tjiritjeriyu widjeru*,
the latter word means "very," the former is a word applied to any man or
animal that is always what the natives term "growling." Joemin said to
his younger brother, hold it hard, *Kara pierda kala, balera naigeri
kuileila*, if you do not your fingers will break. Joemin gave the snake
to Numuraupu, saying *Illaberi, ngeinyimma, ngai ningeri*, young brother
(that is) yours, I (will get) a new one. The snake lifted its body up
with its head pointing forwards. It had a long snout and long jaws. The
two men carrying it went towards the camp. When they came close up they
put the snake down on the ground and, after covering It over with leaves
and grass, left it and went on to the camp. It was now midnight and
Numuraupu, instead of staying ill camp, returned once more to where the
Numereji was secreted, leaving Joemin in camp. He uncovered the snake
and, picking it up, carried it away

{p. 294}

and placed it by Joemin's side. Both Joemin and Numuraupu had a *ranken
kobonja*, that is a wurley or bush shade made of paper-bark. Numereji
said, Clck, Clck, Clck, and this woke up the natives, who said, *Ameina,
munanji?* What is it, what is the matter? The snake went on, Clck, Clck,
Clck, while Joemin lay still, pretending to be asleep. Numuraupu kept
very quiet, pretending also to be asleep, but, in reality, he was
listening. One of the men came up to Joemin and awoke him, calling him
*Murabulbu*--that is, old man. Joemin said, *Oeka, kala, tjikora
oronga*--go back, all right, lie down and sleep; so he went back. Then
Numuraupu went into Joemin's camp, lifted the snake up and took it away
to where it had been hidden before, and covered it with leaves. He said
to it, *Tjikora oronga, ngainma japu morpiu, madida auworkai wilalu
kari*; Lie down and sleep, I go (to get) food, to-night I come back to
the camp and take you.

Two days later a child, about five or six years old, died and, as usual,
the body was put on a stage of boughs in a tree. Joemin said to
Numuraupu, *ngainma areya numureji ningeri*; I am going (to get) a new
Numereji. Before starting, he went to the tree grave, cut open the
child's body so as to get the fat (*paloma*) especially the "kidney
fat," and cut off both heels for the same purpose. He wrapped the fat up
in leaves and then put it in a shell (*nambi*), after which he carne
back to where Numuraupu was seated in camp. Joemin carrying the fat and
Numuraupu carrying the Numereji, set out from camp. A long way off they
came to a big ant hill, a *Mupungalu*. Joemin told Numuraupu to go
little distance away with his Numereji and hold it hard, Then he
collected dry, stringy bark, and, twirling one stick on another, made a
fire at the foot of the ant hill. Then

{p. 295}

he took some of the dead child's fat and put it on the fire, where it
soon began to sizzle. There were several Numereji under the ant hill,
and they smelt the burning fat. Joemin went a little way off from the
fire and then carne back again and put some more fat on, and again it
sizzled. This time a Numereji came out and Joemin captured it.
Numuraupu, holding his snake hard, brought it up to where Joemin had the
new one. The latter licked the old snake. Joemin's was a small one, and
he placed it on the ground by the side of the other, which was much
bigger. They measured the two on the ground side by side. Joemin had a
stone knife, *Tjumaiin*, and, holding this firmly in his left hand, he
cut the hind end off Numuraupu's snake so as to make them both the same
length (Fig. 66). Neither of the snakes growled. Then they lifted the
two up and rubbed and cleaned them. In this way Joemin got a new
Numereji.

In the Kakadu tribe there is a close association between Numereji and
the medicine men. They alone are supposed not only to be able to see
him, but to have eyes that can withstand his glance; other natives are
unable to do this.

At the present time new medicine men are initiated by the old ones. In
the early days Joemin was the first medicine man, and he made others,
and showed them what had to be done. At first Joemin's eyes were like
those of other men, and he could not see Numereji. One day he went to a
water hole and, looking over the edge, he saw his shadow, or
*iwaiyu*.<sup>\[1\]</sup> He looked all about.

\[1. This same term iwaiyu is applied both to a man's spirit part and to
his shadow.\]

{p. 296} Then he put his head under water and opened his eyes. Day after
day he did this, which is called *Karareyu poro*, washing eyes.
Gradually they became very bright and piercing, *Tjiralala poro*, very
good eyes, so that he could see at any distance, and could look right
through men, trees, and rocks. He looked and looked all round, but could
not see Numereji. Then he travelled on and came to Kunyembulul, where
Numereji had eaten a lot of black-fellows, and there he found him
quietly resting. Ah, he said, *Numereji yor*i, Numereji lying down.
Numereji was a great size. Joemin said to him, *ngeinya jereini yana
yau*, where are the men you have eaten? Numereji said nothing, but just
yawned. Joemin spoke to him again and said, *ura wilalu jau jereini*,
you have eaten another camp of men. After this, Numereji vomited up an
enormous mass of bones, the size of a great hill.

The old Numereji carried young ones twisted round it and feeding at the
snake's breast. Joemin said, *ilauila ngainma*, I will have the little
one; *koyada ngainma jeri*, do not growl at me; *jereini jau bali*, you
have eaten plenty of men. Numereji just shut his eyes. Joemin caught a
little snake, while the old Numereji laid down and took no notice of
him. Joemin had provided himself with a large shell, and, after securing
the snake, he cut it in two and let some of the blood flow into the
shell, which, together with the snake, he carried on with him to
Mulipaji, as already described. Joemin had a son called Mukurlul. When
he grew old he said to the latter, *balera ngaiya*\[1\] *wariji*, later
on I die; *balera ngeinyimma unkoregora Numereji*, later on you look out
Numereji, which meant that the son was

\[1. The word for I is either ngainma or ngaiya--for me the word ngainma
is used.\]

{p. 297}

to take his place as a medicine man. Accordingly, accompanied by
Mukurlul, he went close to the Munangel wilalu, or blood camp, at
Mulipaji. Each of them, Joemin and Mukurlul, had left all their armlets,
necklets, wristlets, and hair belts at the home camp. Joemin took his
small Numereji with him, and, while Mukurlul bathed and washed himself
clean, the former took the snake to the blood camp. Then he said to his
son, *mareyimma unkoregora Numereji*, we two go and see Numereji. Joemin
brought out the shell that he had previously left, full of blood, at the
camp and showed it to Mukurlul, saying, *koregora munangel, koregora
pierda*, which means, look at the blood, look at it hard. Then he took a
leaf (*marlil*), put some blood on it, and rubbed it over Mukurlul's
head, arms, and shoulders, saying, *pierda murongada*, strong back;
*pierda korto*, strong arms; *pierda waira*, strong sinews; *tjiralala
poro*, good eyes; *kapena poro*, keen-sighted eyes. Then, taking some
more blood, he said, *munangel jau*; he made him open his mouth wide
(*maiinya*) and gave him some to cat, saying, *munangel jau*, eat the
blood, *araji kala*, right down *koyada nanjil umberdaroitba*, don't let
your tongue taste it; *kulijidbo kumali, kulijidbo* (a yam) is kumali;
*balera koyada jau kulijidbo, mapolo mornda murawarda*, later on don't
eat kulijidbo, your stomach will be very bad or swollen, meaning that
the kulijidbo will grow and swell inside him. Certain kinds of yams,
such as Kulijidbo, Mornun, and Gunumaramila, are kumali to a man who is
being made into a doctor. They all belong to what are called "hot" yams,
which must be specially treated before being eaten, or else they cause
much irritation in the mouth. The idea that medicine men must not eat
"hot" things seems to be widely prevalent. In the Arunta tribe the same
belief holds. A medicine man has been

{p. 298}

known suddenly to lose his powers after drinking hot tea given to him by
a white man.

When all was over, Joemin went, got the Numereji, and, bringing it back,
said to Mukurlul, *Ngoornberri koregora kala*, son, look, all right. The
boy was silent. Joemin said, *morpiu koregora, Numereji koregora*, look
at the snake, look at Numereji. Numereji licked his mouth and rattled
his teeth. Then Joemin, handing the snake to Mukurlul, said, *kara
pierda*, hold it hard. *Koregora pierda, balera, poro mornda*, look hard
(or) afterwards your eyes will be bad. Then he put the snake under
Mukurlul's arm, saying, the snake is yours; *kara pierda, wainyan
korto*, hold it firmly (under your) left arm. Then Joemin said,
*ngeinyimma Marunga*, you are Marunga,<sup>\[1\]</sup> that is, medicine
man. Mukurlul replied, *ngaiya Marunga*, I am Marunga. Joemin said,
*mareyimma wilalu*, we two go back to camp; *pierda gneinyimma kutera,
gnai pari*, you go well in front, I behind. They went towards the camp,
Mukurlul carrying the Numereji and Joemin a special large *warbi*, or
fighting club. When they came near to the camp Joemin said,
*Ngoornberri, ngeinyimma pari*, son, you stay behind. Joemin left his
warbi and went on alone. In camp he told the lubras to go out and gather
paper bark. They did so, brought it into camp, and built with it a new
wurley, or bough shade. Meanwhile, Joemin made his camp between that of
the men and the spot where Mukurlul was hidden with the Numereji, which
he still held firmly. Later on, under cover of darkness, Mukurlul came
into the new wurley, bringing the snake with him.

The natives in camp said; *nigeri Marunga, kumali*, a new Marunga, he is
*kumali*. Mukurlul rubbed himself

\[1. This word is pronounced in at least three different ways as if it
were spelt Mari, Marunga, or Maringa.\]

{p. 299}

over with burnt grass. For four days he remained in the wurley, food
being taken to him by his father, to whom it was given by his mother. No
lubra was allowed to go near the wurley, which was *kumali* and no track
out of camp passed near it. When the four days were over he came into
camp. The Numereji he still kept, but no one could see it save medicine
men.

TRADITION OF TWO NUMEREJI MEN.

Two brothers, both of whom were called Naberayingamna, came to the
Kakadu country, walking above ground, from a place close to what is now
called Burundi. They had very long beards and were much the same as
black fellows except for the fact that they were very much bigger men.
They had one old and one new *chipoiyu* or fishing net. Travelling on,
they came to a place called Ingertpu, a camp on the East Alligator
River, just at the end of the tidal part. Here they threw their nets
into the water and drew them out full of cat-fish. They determined to
make a fire, cook and eat the fish, which, accordingly, they did. When
this was over they took their nets and journeyed on to a place close to
the stone which now marks the spot at which Imberombera died. They saw a
snake in the grass and the younger said to the elder brother, *ameina
narenma*, what is the snake, or, what kind of snake is that? The elder
replied, It is Kintjilbara, that is, a large venomous snake, we will eat
him. They caught the snake, broke its head, cut it off and threw it
away. First of all they made a fire in the earth with paper bark and
heated stones on it. Then they passed the snake's body through the fire
so that they could easily rub the scales off. After this

{p. 300}

they took a stone knife and made two cuts right along the body, one on
either side of the backbone and, with the same flake, they broke the
latter, at intervals, along its length. When the stones were hot enough,
the body of the snake was coiled round and round them, the tall end
being pushed into the cut, front end; paper bark was placed above it and
then the earth was filled in. When the cooking was over, a part of the
under body-wall was cut off, great care being taken not to spill any of
the juice in the body-cavity, because this is regarded as a great
delicacy, called *juri*. The native telling us the tradition showed us
exactly how the elder brother lifted up the snake by each end with his
arms extended so that the body formed a loop from which the *juri*
streamed into the man's mouth. The fat was cut out and eaten first, the
body was then broken in pieces and the meat eaten; finally the bones
were broken. When this had been done the older man took the fragments in
his mouth and spat them out in all directions saying, now all men may
eat Kintjilbara, bones and all.

After eating the Kintjilbara they resumed their travels and caught sight
of some natives journeying to the northeast. The younger brother said to
the elder, I can see a black-fellow. The elder said, Yes that is
Mimonau, we will go to him. They did so and found him eating something.
They said to him, *ameina jau*, what are you eating? He replied, *ngai
Kintjilbara jau*, I am eating Kintjilbara. The older brother said, *gnai
juro*, I do the same, *ngai pumana noorkudua*, I have eaten one. He
asked the old man where his camp was and Mimonau said, Here, and asked
them, *ngeinyaminna wilalu*, where is your camp? The elder brother
replied, *areyiminna breikul*, we go a long way.

The two brothers then left Mimonau and, travelling

{p. 301}

on, came to a big blood-wood tree on which many bees were feeding on the
honey in the gum-tree flowers. The younger brother said, hearing the
buzzing, What is it, is it bees? Ha! Mormo! The elder brother was
carrying a *keerli*, or stone tomahawk, which he handed to the younger
man telling him to go and cut a forked stick. He himself gathered a leaf
with a spider cocoon on it, which he shredded out, and, having done
this, climbed the tree by means of the forked stick which was placed
slanting against the trunk. He put a little bit of the web on each bee
that he could reach, singing out to them to go home, and at the same
time telling his brother to watch which way they went. They followed
them up and put leaves into the holes they entered so that they would
know, later on, where the honey-bags were. Some of the bees, on which he
put web, he sent away to distant parts to make honey bags for the
natives there. One he sent to Muborarari, a place between the two
Alligator Rivers. When he had done this the old man went to the first
honey-bag, cut it out with his stone axe and ate it. The two brothers
then went back to the river, where they had left their nets in the
water, took them out and brought them on with them. They came to a creek
running into the East Alligator River where they found a number of
natives living in bark wurleys. The men said, We can hear the black
fellows' bamboo (*i.e.*, their bamboo trumpets), we will go and look at
them. They came close up to the camp and a heavy rain fell. The younger
man said, I am cold, brother. When they came near they met an old man,
named Pundamunga, who was out looking for sugar-bags. He was very
frightened when he saw them and said, *ameina, ameina*, who are you, who
are you? They said to him, *ameina kumeri*, why are you frightened?
*Kowe breyu*,

{p. 302}.

koyada kumeri, come here, do not be frightened. Before this they had
hidden their nets.

Each of the two brothers had the skin of a Numereji snake and a separate
head, like a snake. They were men, but could change themselves into
snakes when they wanted to and then back again into men. As the natives
say, they were Numereji men. Before coming near the camp they had put
their snake skins on, but now they took them off and hid them.
Pundamunga was still very frightened. They said to him, We are
black-fellows, do not be frightened, where is your camp? The two men
then said, *gnoro kutjali, nungortji*, go and light a fire, we are cold.
Pundamunga accordingly went and brought a fire-stick. It went out and he
brought another. This also went out. Go again, they said. He did so, a
third and forth time, but it always went out. The rain meanwhile was
coming down in torrents. After a fifth unsuccessful attempt, the men
told him to go to his camp and stay there. He did so and slept by his
fire. The other men in camp were making a corrobboree and striking
sticks together. The two brothers said, We will put on our Numereji
skins and eat the men. Then they went to where their skins were hidden,
blew them up, took their own black-fellow skins off and went into the
Numereji ones. They had heads and teeth just like a Numereji and were of
huge size. After moving about for some time they went underground until
they came to the camp where the natives were corrobboreeing. The
natives, except Pundamunga who was asleep, knew nothing about their
presence, and the two snake men first of all came out and looked at the
men in camp and then, going down again, suddenly arose under the camp,
smashed it into bits and then devoured everything, men, women, children,
weapons, in fact the whole

{p. 303}

camp and all that it contained. After that they went to sleep. The hole
that they made when they came out is still to be seen at Jipaiumba and
also two depressions in the ground where they slept. When they awoke
they travelled on and, at a place called Purluwa, vomited up the bones,
which turned into stone. At Purluwa also they shed their skins and
changed themselves into black-fellows, putting their Numereji skins into
bags. Then they came on to Kulapari, where there is a water pool, in
which they put one of their nets. During the night this changed into a
Numereji which came out and went on to the plains bordering the river
and then back into the latter by way of a small creek.

The elder brother woke up early next morning and went to the river to
see if there were any fish in the net, but it was not there. He called
out to his younger brother, *chipoiyu kaio*, the net is not here. Of
their two nets one was an old one, the other new, and it was the latter
that had gone. They put their two snake skins in the one net and then
followed up the tracks of the snake that they could clearly see going
across the plain. The tracks led them across the latter and then back to
the mangroves, where they went into the creek. Here they decided to
leave the tracks and go round and try to head the Numereji. They ran
quickly and caught sight of him, shouting, Here he is. They came up and
tried to pull him out, but the snake said, I will stop here, this is my
home. The brothers said, We will leave him, and went back to Tjironguda,
close to Imorji, two places on the East Alligator River. They travelled
on and came to a spot where they made a hill, called Tjaruma. They
crossed the plains, at Mijela, where there is much sand, so that the
place is called Mijela wilalu--the sand

{p. 304}

camp. They looked up and saw a hill, called Injoanbeli and the younger
man said, Brother, there are stones there. He was carrying the net with
the skins in and it was very heavy. However, the older man said, We will
not stop here, we will go on further. They went on to Murakamiaiji, a
billabong close to the range of hills that skirts the plains, and halted
beside the water, saying *quialu nanjil meja*, we are hungry, we will
fish. The young man made a fishing line out of shredded bark and they
caught and cooked some fish.

Here they left the Kakadu country and came into that of the Geimbio. The
older man said to the younger, Give me a string. He only replied, *um,
um*. They baited the line with meat and the old man caught a cat-fish.
He talked to his younger brother in Kakadu, but he would not answer and
only said, *um, um*, and nodded his head. When they tried, later on, to
pull the line out they found that there was something very heavy on it.
The two men pulled hard, swaying about from side to side, but could not
draw it out. The older man said to the other, Go and get a strong stick
and we will tie the string on and hold hard. It was all of no use and
the older man, who was nearest to the water, was pulled in, though his
brother held on hard, but could not keep him out. The water was very
clear and the younger brother could see right down to the bottom. He
said, Where is my brother? At last he threw his net in and all that he
had and dived down in search of his brother. He found him, and the old
man told the younger to go back to the Geimbio country and talk Geimbio;
I, he said, will go down the river and talk Kakadu. The elder brother
then went into his Numereji skin and slept. He has remained there ever
since, and there are still old met' alive who have seen him. Later on,
the salt water came

{p. 305}

up and mixed with the fresh, hurting his eyes, so that he went down
under ground, where he can still be seen by the medicine men.

The elder brother is now the Numereji of the southern division of the
Kakadu tribe. The net that changed into a snake is the Numereji of the
northern division. It is supposed to live at a place called
Mungaddabremner on the East Alligator River, and no native, except
medicine men, go there, because they are afraid that he would pull them
into the water and eat them. The younger brother is now the Numereji of
the Geimbio people.

TRADITION OF ERIBINJORI, THE CROCODILE.

Two black-fellows, who were the sons of different women, each of whom,
however, was called Nimbiamananogo, went out hunting with the two women,
their mothers. The men caught ducks and Karakera (spur-winged plover) on
the plains, while the women got plenty of Wurijonga, that is, lily-roots
and seeds, in the water pools.

At this time the men had no fire and did not know how to make it, but
the women did. The latter cooked their food while the men were away in
the bush and ate it by themselves. When they were just finishing they
saw the men returning, away in the distance. As they did not want them
to know about the fire, they quickly gathered up the ashes, which were
still alight, and put them up their vulvas, so that the men should not
see them. When the men came close up they said, *yaninga kutjali?* where
or which way is the fire? The women replied, *kaio kutjali*, there is no
*kutjali*; and then there was a great dispute and much noise. Finally
the lubras gave the men some of their cooked Wurijonga or lily

{p. 306}

cake. When they had eaten a great deal of meat and Wurijonga they all
went to sleep for a long time. Once more, when they awoke, the men went
out hunting and the women cooked their food. The weather was very hot
and the remnant of the first lot of birds that the men had brought in
and had not eaten had gone bad. The men brought in a fresh supply, and
again, ever, when they were a long way off, they saw the fire burning
brightly in the women's camp. A spur-winged plover flew up and gave
warning to the women that the men were coming back. Once more, they hid
the fire and ashes, in the same way as before, and, again, the men asked
where the fire was; the women were positive that they had none at all.
The men said, We saw it. The women replied, No, you are gammoning, we
have no fire. The men said, We saw a big fire; if you have no fire,
which way do you cook your food? has the sun cooked it? If the sun cooks
your lilies, why does it not cook our ducks and stop them from going
bad. There was no reply to this. They all went to sleep, and when they
woke up the men left the women and dug up the root of an iron-wood tree
and got resin (*kapei*) from it.

Then they each took two sticks and found that they could make fire by
rubbing them on one another. They said, That is all right. They had a
long talk and decided to transform themselves into Eribinjori, or large
crocodiles. Up to that time there were no such creatures, and they
discussed what they were to be like. First of all they took a large lump
of iron-wood resin, or *kapei*. They made a framework for their heads
out of a very tough wood, called *Umbarndil*, using a flat stone for the
top of the head. The rest of it they modelled out of *kapei*. Then they
gathered some of the stiff stalks

{p. 307}

of all everlasting plant, called Benagra-benagra, and pierced holes for
the nose. This done, they went to the jungle and cut *Winbegi*, or cane,
to make a slit for the mouth. They made two of these frameworks, one for
each man, and then put the whole thing over their heads. Then in order,
so the natives told us, to enable them to breathe under water, they
pierced their lungs from the outside, on each side of the body, with
*Winbegi* knives and filled them with air through the openings thus
made. One man pierced his first, and as he was successful, the other did
the same. Then, with his crocodile head on, one of them dived into the
water and swam away under the surface for a quarter of a mile or more.
When he came to the surface he sang out, I am here now. Then the second
man dived in, followed after the first and found him. They said, We are
here together. Then they began playing about and had a race in the
water, travelling at a great pace and ending up level.

The making of the heads had taken a long time, so that they had now been
away two days, and, after discussing the matter, they decided to return
to camp. Before doing so, however, they laid their crocodile heads on
one side, hiding them from view, so that the women could not see them.
As they went back, they once more saw the lubras making fire, and,
again, the plover rose and gave the women warning. They wanted to know
why the men had been away so long, where they had gone to, and what they
had been doing, but the men said nothing at all.

Late in the afternoon, the women took their *chipoiyu*, or fishing nets,
and set them in the water, where they left them all night. The next
morning they went early to take them out. As they went along, one said
to the

{p. 308}

other, I wonder if we shall find any fish in them. They had no clothing
on, but daubed themselves over with mud. When they reached the water
pool they went in, Meanwhile, however, the men had gone ahead of them,
by a roundabout track. They fixed their crocodile heads on and dived
into the water, so that, when the women came up and began to try to pull
their nets out, they had no idea that the men had left their camp, much
less that, in the form of crocodiles, they were hanging on to, and
making the nets so heavy that the women could not move them. At last the
lubras put their hands into the nets to find out what was the matter.
The crocodiles bit them, dragged them under water and killed them, as
the natives say, *wariji ge*, dead altogether.

When all was over, the Eribinjori men brought the bodies out on to the
bank of the water pool and said to them, Get up, go. Why did you tell us
lies about the fire? But there was no reply from the women; they were
completely dead.

The two men kept their crocodile heads on, but they still had
black-fellow legs and arms. They stood up, stretched themselves, and
shouted out that they were going to cease from being black-fellows and
would always be crocodiles. They threw away their sticks and spears, in
fact everything that they had, changed their bodies, arms, and legs, and
then, having made themselves completely into crocodiles, dived into the
water in which they have lived ever since.

TRADITION OF UNGULLA ROBUNBUN.

A woman, named Ungulla Robunbun, came from placed called Palientoi,
which lies between two rivers that are now known as the McKinlay and the
Mary. She

{p. 309}

spoke the language of the Noenmil "people" and had many children. She
started off to walk to Kraigpa, a place at the head of the Wildman
Creek. Some of her children she carried on her shoulders, others on her
hips, and one or two of them walked. At Kraigpan she left one boy and
one girl and told them to speak the Quiratari (or Quiradari) language.
Then she walked on to Koarnbo Creek, near the salt water at
Murungaraiyu, where she left a boy and a girl and told them to speak
Koarnbut. Travelling on to Kupalu, she left the Koarnbut language behind
her and crossed over what is now called the East Alligator River, to its
west side. She came on to Nimbaku and left a boy and a girl there and
told them to speak the Wijirk language. From here she journeyed on
across the plains stretching between the Alligator rivers to Koreingen,
the place to which Imberombera had previously sent out two individuals
named Pundamunga and Maramma. Ungulla Robunbun saw them and said to her
children, There are black fellows here; they are talking Kakadu; that is
very good talk; this is Kakadu country that we are now in.

Ungulla went on until she came near enough for them to hear her
speaking. She said, I am Kakadu like you; I will belong to this country;
you and I will talk the same language. Ungulla then told them to come
close up, which they did, and then she saw that the young woman was
quite naked. Ungalla herself was completely clothed in sheets of
*ranken*, or paper bark, and she took one off, folded it up, and showed
the lubra how to make an apron such as the Kakadu women always wear now.
She told the lubra that she did not wish to see her going about naked.
Then they all sat down. Ungulla said, Are you a lubra, and she replied,
Yes, I am *ungordiwa*. Then Ungulla said, I have seen Koreingen a long
way off; I am going there. Where is your camp? The

{p. 310}

Kakadu woman said, I shall go back to my camp if you go to Munganillida.
Ungulla then rose and walked on with her children. On the road some of
them began to cry and she said, *Bialilla waji kobali*, many children
are crying; *ameina waji kobali*, why are many children crying? She was
angry and killed two of them, a boy and a girl, and left them behind.
Going on, she came near to Koreingung and saw a number of men and women
in camp and made her own camp some little distance from theirs. She then
walked on to Koreingung and said, Here is a black-fellow's camp; I will
make mine here also.

She set to work to make a shelter, saying, *Kunjerogabi ngoinbu
kobonji*, I build a grass shelter; *mornia balgi*, there is a big mob of
mosquitoes. As yet the natives had not seen Ungulla or her children.
There were plenty of fires in the natives' camps but no mosquitoes. They
did not have any of these before Ungulla came, bringing them with her.
She went into her shelter with her children and slept. After a time she
came out again and then the other natives caught sight of her. Some of
the younger Numulakirri determined to go to her camp. When she saw them
coming she went into her *kobonji* and armed herself with a strong
stick. She was *Markogo*, that is, elder sister, to the men, and, as
they came up, she shouted out from her bush wurley, saying, What are you
all coming for, you are my *illaberri* (younger brothers)? I am *kumali*
to you. They said nothing but came on with their hands behind their
backs. As soon as they were close to the entrance to her shelter she
suddenly jumped up, scattering the grass and boughs in all directions.
She yelled loudly and, with her great stick, hit them all on their
private parts. She was so powerful that she killed them all and their
bodies tumbled into the water hole close by. Then she went to the camp
where the women

{p. 311}

and children had remained behind and drove them ahead of her into the
water. The bones of all these natives are still there in the form of
stones with which also their spirit parts are associated. When all was
over the woman stood in her camp. First of all she pulled out her
*kumara* (vagina) and threw it away, saying, This belongs to the lubras.
Then she threw her breasts away and a *wairbi*, or woman's fighting
stick, saying that they all belonged to the lubras. From her dilly bag
she took a *paliarti*, or flat spear-thrower {*Atlatl?--jbh*}, and a
light reed spear, called *kunjolio*, and, throwing them away, shouted
out, These are for the men.

She then took a sharp-pointed blade of grass called *Karani*, caught a
mosquito (*mornia*) and fixed it on to his head (*reri*), so that it
could "bite" and said, Your name is *mornia*. She also gave him
instructions, saying, *yapo mapolio, jirongadda mitjerijoro*, go to the
plains, close to the mangroves; *manungel jereini jauo*, eat men's
blood; *kumanga kaio mornia*, (in) the bush no mosquitoes. That is why
mosquitoes are always so abundant amongst the mangroves. When she had
done this Ungalla gathered her remaining children together and, with
them, went into the water hole.

There were a great many natives, and, after they were dead, their skins
became transformed into different kinds of birds. Some of them changed
into small owls, called *Irre-idill*, which catch fish. When they hear
the bird calling out at night they say dodo, which means wait, or, later
on; to-morrow morning we will put a net in and catch some fish for you.
Others turned into *Kurra-liji-liji*, a bird that keeps a look out to
see if any strange natives are about. If a man wants to find out if any
strangers are coming he says to the bird, *umbordera jereini einji?* are
men coming to-day? If they are, the bird answers, *pitjit, pitjit*.
Others changed into *Jidikera-jidikera*,

{p. 312}

or willy wagtails, which keep a look out for buffaloes and crocodiles.
Others, again, changed into dark-coloured kites, called *Daigonora*,
which keep a look out to see if any hostile natives are coming up to
"growl." A man will say to one of these, *Daigonora*, if he sees it in a
tree, *Breikul jereini jeri*, that is, far away, are there men coming to
growl? If the bird replies to him he knows that they are coming, but if
it makes no sound, then he knows there are no strangers about. Others
changed into *Moaka*, or crows, that show natives where geese are to be
found; others into *Tidji-tidji*, a little bird that shows them where
the sugar-bags may be secured; others into *Mundoro*, a bird that warns
them when natives are coming up to steal a lubra. Some, again, changed
into *Murara*, the "mopoke," which warns them if enemies are coming up
in strong numbers. They ask the bird, and if it answers with a loud
"mopoke" they know that there are none about and that they have no need
to be anxious, but if it answers with a low call, then they know that
hostile natives are somewhere in the neighbourhood, and a man will
remain on watch all night. Some of the women changed into laughing
jackasses.

All these birds are supposed to understand what the black-fellows say,
though they cannot themselves speak. While the men were explaining
matters to us they spoke to two or three wagtails that came close up and
twittered. The men said that the birds wanted to know what we were
talking about, but they told them that they must go away and not listen,
which they did.

Before finally going into the water hole Ungulla called out the names of
the natives to whom she said the country belonged. They were all the
children of Pundamunga and Maramma.
