# WHY THE PETIOLE OF THE WARATAH IS LONG.

It was noticed by the aborigines that the leaf of a waratah has a long
petiole, and the leaves of many other plants have a petiole that is very
short. For instance, the waxy green leaves of the Diploglottis with its
bunch of yellow berries, the Prostanthera lasianthos, the Chorizema, the
Lilly-pilly (Eugenia Smithi) have but short petioles; while many of the
eucalypts, the Honey flower (Lambertia formosa) as well as very many
others have petioles like that of the waratah. None however is so long.

No one must imagine that such a thing of the bush could have escaped the
notice of the aborigines. Many are the indications that our autocthonous
predecessors saw a very great deal of the intimate habits of the flora
and the fauna and the avifauna, and spoke freely of them, and attributed
in their legendary many of these habitsmuch of the particular form and
colour, and even habitat, to the influences of supernatural beings and
occurrences.

Of the petiole of the waratah they said it is long because of a
happening of seismic nature.

There was a camp one time on a volcanic field (presumably that of which
Mount Wilson is the highest point) that was a scene of a weird and
awesome happening. The tribe had been housed there for a long time, for
the blacks of the Hunter River Valley had grown very strong, and were
not afraid to penetrate into the territories of the Hawkesbury River
people and the people of the flat of Hartley.

But the way to the Mount Wilson region was a difficult way. The
Hawkesbury tribe and the Hartley tribe had joined forces and established
the camp on the heights. The story, mentioning a fire from underground,
is one of the few that show that the aborigines had a knowledge of time
when Australia suffered from volcanic upheavals and earthquakes of
volcanic origin.

There was game in plenty. Red rock wallabies were in millions, and many
were the rugs made of their skins, and had they been trimmed with the
red crests of the gang-gang cockatoo they would no doubt have equalled
that wonderful cloak of the original Krubi.

Scouts had sighted blacks of the Hunter River tribe penetrating the
gullies that led into the Grose, and of the Grose itself. Several
corroborees were held to initiate the young men into the mysteries and
methods of warfare. Every one was on the "qui vive" and tenterhooks.
Watch was being kept both by day and by night. One young man, full of
prowess, and eager to show his skill and resource to the maiden of his
eye, had enwrapped himself in the skin of the wombat, and crouching on
all fours had penetrated down, travelling only at night, to within a few
yards of the outposts of the enemy. During the day he curled himself in
a log or a hollow place between rocks, and many times he had been peered
at and not been recognised. Then slowly creeping back he had brought
tidings of the encroachments and strength of the marauders. But many
weeks went by, and still no really hostile move was made by either
party. The only wrong was the trespass.

At last the Mount Wilson people decided to drive the others away. They
thought that by taking the initiative they would be the gainers because
talkative men and women had twitted the rest, especially the young
warriors, with idleness and cowardice. Down in a gully that had a flat
area beside the creek a clearing was made, and stones were placed in
position for the great and last corroboree before the engagement.

The day had been very hot and a dark mist had gathered toward evening.
The whole mountain region seemed prepared for, or expectant of,
something.

The blacks took no great interest in the coming corroboree. Only those
who were over eager to fight seemed ready for the school. Yet the whole
adult tribe repaired to the chosen spot.

When darkness fell the women seated themselves in the usual circle and
were ready with their waddies to beat the earth in time and tune.

Then the world shook. The rumbling of an earthquake sped upon them and
rolled beneath them and the hillside tumbled. The country rolled first
one way and then another. The trees leaned with the rolling and righted
when the earth righted.

There was nowhere to run. All eyes were turned towards the camping
places, for there were the young people who could not attend a
corroboree. But between them and the top of the hill an opening came and
tongues of flame shot out. A few hot stones rolled down into the
clearing, though no one was hurt. Then smoke arose and fire flared and
the camp was seen to be ablaze. Cries and lamentations filled the air.
Then a youth named Camoola cried out for the man who had crept far in
the wombat skin and knew everything. He must know, he said, where the
fire came from, and how to put it out!

Now the blacks had for ages used the stem of the waratah to enwrap any
hot thing they wished to handle. They said that it entirely prevented
burns. In the earliest days of white occupancy of Australia they brought
these stems to blacksmiths and told them that they could never be
injured by fire from the anvils, which they took to be supernatural fire
such as that seen in the heavens when there is a meteor travelling
there, if they used them, and to please the natives the blacksmiths did
use them and paid in those showy trifles that the natives valued, for
them.

Seizing a couple of waratah stems, leaves and all, this young man sped
out into the night. The rocking of the earth had ceased, but the fire
burned on and the tongues of flame still leapt along the whole length of
the great crack that came in the mountain-side.

Then Camoola, too, dashed off. He had plucked many waratah stems for he
knew they would be needed. His wonderful hearing told him where
Wombat-skin had gone. He reached him just as he was dropping down into a
cave. The heavy dark mist had cleared all away. The stars now shone
clearly. The camp was wiped out, and many injured people were writhing
and wailing and could not be succored.

Holding the waratah stems out in front of them both Camoola and
Wombat-skin dropped down into the cave. They cautiously went forward.
They came to a bend, and rounding this they came in sight of the fire.
It seemed to be coming up from a depth below, and it swept along the
crack that passed here through the cave. If they could prevent it from
coming up then the rest of their people could cross the crack at their
point and reach the place where the camp had been.

Camoola ran back to the entrance where he had seen many waratahs. The
bush was now afire at the entrance to the cave, and the waratahs could
be plainly seen in its light. But Camoola could not climb out. He had
dropped down without trouble, but there was no foothold whereby he might
get out. He strained every muscle. He leapt high, but not by several
inches could he reach another waratah. He went back to Wombat-skin. This
brave young man was carefully wrapping himself up in his wombat skin,
and sticking about it all the waratah stalks that he and the other had
brought, for his intention was to lie across the hole and thus prevent
the fire from coming out. Only could Camoola stop him by catching his
arms, and, being the stronger, he held him too tightly.

Camoola urged him to return to the mouth of the cave and to see if more
waratah stems could be got before he essayed the dangerous task of lying
across the fires. So they went back. Neither of them, nor the two
together, could reach them. Then Camoola thought of the magic clay and
he looked for it, and to his delight he found it. Hastily making the
markings he had seen often enough on the priests, he invoked the aid of
the spirits. He had yet to attend the school at which those were taught
who were to be magicians, and therefore he did not fully understand the
rites. He quite well knew that if he succeeded in obtaining aid he,
being really uninitiated, would suffer for it.

Wombat-skin tried to jump again, but though the mystic signs were used
he failed. It was now believed that an evil spirit stood near. Both men
yelled to exorcise the evil of it. Both had heard the yell at the
corroboree that they were not permitted to see, and knew what it meant
and what it would do.

They jumped again and again. They grew strangely weak. They could jump
no higher. Then the little stalk that joined the leaf to the stem grew.
It became long quickly. The men could grasp them quite easily. They
gathered a bunch. They covered themselves and one of them lay across the
hole. The flames were stopped. The charm of the waratahs acted. They
were not burned.

Outside the members of the tribe who would have joined in the corroboree
shrieked with delight. They saw the flames cease. They too twined some
stems of the waratah around themselves, and especially about their feet,
so that the hot stones would not injure them, and they set out for the
camp on the hill. They were weary before they reached it and saw how
their folk were stricken.

Wombat-skin stayed with Camoola. He lay still in death. It is said that
he touched a waratah stem while it was still being influenced by the
hand of the spirit, and he, being uninitiated, could not bear the
contact and he paid for it with his life. The waratah he touched was
arrested in its growth, and the happening is perpetuated in those that
are imperfect. They should be serrated and are smooth-edged. They should
have the usual long petiole, but they have not.

Camoola was left in the cave, and many years afterwards-many
centuries-his bones were found by the botanist Cayley.

Cayley penetrated the Blue Mountains to a spot where a great rock wall
prevented his further exploration. Here he erected a cairn of stones,
and the place is called now Cayley's Repulse.

Mount Wilson shows all the signs of volcanic eruption.

The trespassing blacks saw the fire and felt the quake, and they made
all haste back to the Hunter Valley. The tribes that had amalgamated
separated again and each buried their dead. No one dared to touch
Camoola.

The clearing that was made for the corroboree is still to be seen at
Mount Wilson. The great volcanic crack may also be seen at its foot and
all agree that in the ages ago the happening described took place.

Mount Wilson and its neighbour, Mount Tomah, may be seen from any
eminence of Sydney, and some say that the petioles of the waratah are
longer there than anywhere else.
