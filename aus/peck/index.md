This is a collection of Aboriginal folklore, and stories about
Aborigines, primarily from the New South Wales region of Australia, on
the southeast coast. Unlike [Parker](../alt/index.md), we know next to
nothing about Peck other than the fact that he was a botanical
enthusiast. It is fairly certain that at the time he wrote there were
very few remaining native Australians in that region. So his framing
story of an aboriginal 'princess' (the Aborigines have no such class
distinctions) dropping by his 'tyre' shop seems a bit improbable. His
writing ability was far inferior to Parker, and his obsession with the
Watarah flower gets a bit tedious. However, the stories related here
largely cross-check with other accounts, so folkloric aspects of this
book are probably factual.
