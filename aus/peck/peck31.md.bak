# A BIRD LEGEND

The aborigines sometimes kept birds and animals as pets, but in all
instances that may be enquired into it is found that the pet by some
mischance or peculiar trait or impulse strayed into a camp and stayed
there. However, this had nothing to do with the belief in an "affinity."
Nor yet the belief in and recognition of a "totem." That possibly
originated in a knowledge of evolution-in the settled idea that during
the ages everything has changed in form-and no outstanding fact of
Nature escaped being considered the beginning or the dwelling-place of
an ancestor or an originator.

But something of a parody of this fundamental belief is the acceptance
of an affinity in the shape of a bird or an animal that knows of its
being related to a human and who acts as a protector of those of whom it
is a family part. In this way the last full-blooded woman of the
Cammaray people believed in the snake. She says that the black snake
always indicates to her whether or not an undertaking of hers is to be
successful, when a calamity is about to happen or has just happened in
her immediate family, when she is personally threatened with great loss
and whether or not the time be propitious for the doing of any important
thing.

She tells many weird tales of warnings shown to her by her affinity. The
lyre-bird, she tells, was the affinity of a man of her people away back
in the time before history, and he had one as a pet. He was very proud
of the fact that his bird mimicked so marvellously, and he arranged a
competition. People who belonged to such birds as parrots, black
cockatoos, wattle birds-those with a clear, distinctive call-assembled,
and they listened to the lyre-bird not only imitating, but excelling
each in its own song.

One bird was not claimed by anybody, and it sat disconsolately on a
limb, apparently taking no notice of the proceedings; and then, just
before dark, it made its effort.

The lyre-bird, nothing loth, imitated it perfectly. But the other bird
was not finished. In another key it performed again, and still in
another, until the lyre-bird was bewildered. It failed to follow;
therefore we may now hear the great bird mimic as we stand, say, at Echo
Point in the Blue Mountains, or under the hills of the Snowy or the
Cann, going through all its repertoire, imitating not only every other
bird, but every sound it has ever heard. But when it comes to the laugh
of one it fails. The bird it cannot properly mock is the kookaburra. The
lyre-bird man of the story was discredited, and therefore in later years
such men were never of much account in the eyes of their compatriots,
while those of the kookaburra, though it is recognised as an affinity of
a much later date, are always people of great importance.

And by some strange coincidence we have taken the kookaburra to our
hearts, and we picture him much more as the bird-representative of
Australia than the emu which figures as such officially.
