## Giant Kangaroos.

Next day, the brothers changed themselves into giant kangaroos, and
decided to kill Thoorkook and his savage dogs. They hopped about in
sight of Thoorkook's camp, and, when the dogs scented them, they gave
chase. With great bounds the kangaroos hopped away, and the dogs
followed, but one ran faster than the rest. When it was a long way from
the pack, the kangaroos turned, and one of them struck the dog a heavy
blow with its paw, which ripped the body from head to tail. They then
carried the body and threw it in a deep water hole.

The kangaroos continued to hop away, and the dogs followed fast; red
foam flecked their mouths and lolling tongues, the cruel white fangs
glistened in the sun, their lean sides panted, and the noise of their
deep, hoarse barking echoed through the bush like distant thunder. One
dog again ran faster than the rest in this relentless chase. The
kangaroos ran slower, as though they were growing tired, and, when the
leading dog came within striking distance, they suddenly turned, and,
with one swift stroke, ripped it from end to end. This terrible hunt
continued until one by one the dogs were killed.

The kangaroos again changed themselves into men and went to Thoorkook's
camp to kill him. When he saw them approaching he seized his weapons and
prepared to fight. They, however, made the sign of peace by placing
their spears in the ground, and he did likewise.

The elder brother then spoke to him, saying: "While we were hunting, you
crawled like an adder in the grass and killed our children with your
dogs. We have killed your dogs, and the crows are whitening their bones.
I am now going to kill you, not as you kill children, but as men kill
men, and, when you are dead, I will change you into a bird that will
live forever in the darkness of night, and never see the sun."

Thoorkook did not answer; he knew that he would have to fight for his
life. Picking up his spears and a wooden shield, he followed Byama to a
clear space in the bush where the trial of skill was to take place.
