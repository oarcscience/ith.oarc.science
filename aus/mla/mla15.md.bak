# Why the Emu has Short Wings and the Native Companion a Harsh Voice

An emu with very long wings once made her home in the sky. One day she
looked over the edge of the clouds, and down on the earth she saw a
great gathering of birds dancing by a reed-grown lagoon. High in a
gumtree the bell birds were making sweet music with their silvery
chimes; the kookaburra, perched on the limb of a dead tree, was
chuckling pleasantly to himself; while the native companion danced
gracefully on the grass nearby.

The emu was very interested in dancing, so she flew down from her home
beyond the clouds, and asked the birds if they would teach her to dance.
A cunning old native companion replied: "We shall be very pleased to
teach you our dances, but you could never learn with such long wings. If
you like, we will clip them for you." The emu did not give much thought
to the fact that short wings would never carry her home again. So great
was her vanity that she allowed her wings to be clipped very short. When
she had done so, the native companions immediately spread their long
wings-which they had previously concealed by folding them close against
their backs-and flew away, leaving the emu lonely and wiser than before.
She never returned to her home in the sky, because her wings would not
grow again. They have remained short and useless ever since. This is the
reason why emus run very fast, but never fly.

After wandering alone for a long time the emu reconciled herself to a
home on the earth, and reared a large family. One day she was walking
through the bush when the native companion-who also had a large
family-saw her in the distance. The native companion immediately hid all
her chicks in the undergrowth, except one; then she approached the emu
in a friendly manner, and said: "What a very weary life you must have
feeding such a large family. You are looking very ill, and I am sure you
will die. I have only one chick. Take my advice and kill your chicks
before they kill you." The foolish emu again listened to the soft words
of the other bird, and destroyed all her chicks.

Thereupon the native companion called in a low, sweet voice, "Geralka
Beralka, Geralka Beralka," and all her fluffy little chicks came running
to her from the bushes in which she had hidden them. The emu was frantic
with grief when she realised what she had done; but once again she paid
the price of vanity and idle flattery with a sad and lonely heart. The
native companion was so eager to call her chicks after the cruel trick
she had played on the emu that she twisted her neck, and lost her
beautiful voice for ever. And now she can call with only two harsh,
discordant sounds.

The seasons passed, and once again the emu had a big clutch of eggs. One
day the native companion paid her a visit and pretended to be friendly,
but the sight of her old enemy made the emu very angry. The emu made a
savage rush at her, but the native companion hopped over her back and
broke all the eggs except one. After dancing around for a little while,
the native companion made a determined rush, and, seizing the remaining
egg, threw it up into the sky.
