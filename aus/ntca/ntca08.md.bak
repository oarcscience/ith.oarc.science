THE name *Intichiuma* is applied to certain sacred ceremonies associated
with the totems, and the object of which is to secure the increase of
the animal or plant which gives its name to the totem. These ceremonies
are perhaps the most important of any, and it does not seem possible to
discover when and how they arose. The natives have no tradition which
deals with their origin.

In connection with them we may note an interesting feature with regard
to the relationship existing between an individual of the Arunta and
other tribes in the centre of the continent and his totemic animal or
plant. We find amongst these tribes no restriction according to which a
man <span id="page_168">p. 168</span> is forbidden to eat his totem, as
is stated to be the case amongst certain other Australian tribes. On the
other hand, though he may only under ordinary circumstances eat very
sparingly of it, there are certain special occasions on which he is, we
may say, obliged by custom to eat a small portion of it or otherwise the
supply would fail. These occasions are those on which the *Intichiuma*
ceremonies now to be described are performed. Further still, the lead in
the ceremony must be taken by the Alatunja, and when we asked the
Alatunja of the witchetty grub totem why he ate his totem, which is
always regarded by the native as just the same as himself, the reply was
that unless he did eat a little, he would not be able to perform
properly the ceremony of *Intichiuma*.

There is however one notable exception to the restrictions upon eating,
and this is concerned with the Achilpa or wild cat <span
id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md) totem. Only a very little of this is
allowed to be eaten, and that only by the old people; but in this case
the restriction is not confined to the members of the totem, but is of
universal application, applying to every member of the tribe. There is
no similar restriction applying to any other animal or plant, but, in
the case of Achilpa, there are reasons given for not eating it which
serve to show that for some cause or other this particular animal has
associations with the tribe as a whole which do not exist in respect of
any other. In the first place, it is supposed that any one, save an old
man or woman, eating Achilpa would be afflicted with a special disease
called *Erkincha*; and in the second, it is believed that if any man who
had killed another at any time of his life were to eat this particular
animal, then his spirit part or *Yenka* <span
id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_81.md) would leave his body and he would soon be
killed by some enemy, so that to a man who has ever killed another—and
there are very few men who do not lay claim to this distinction—the
Achilpa is tabu or forbidden for life, no matter what be his age. There
are amongst the traditions dealing with the Achilpa of the Alcheringa,
very explicit references to the *Erkincha* disease, though why this
should be especially

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

associated with the Achilpa people it is difficult to say, and the
natives have no explanation to offer. <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md)

We may now describe the ceremonies of *Intichiuma* as they are performed
in the case of certain of the totems. Each totem has its own ceremony
and no two of them are alike; but though they differ to a very great
extent so far as the actual performance is concerned, the important
point is that one and all have for their sole object the purpose of
increasing the number of the animal or plant after which the totem is
called; and thus, taking the tribe as a whole, the object of these
ceremonies is that of increasing the total food supply. To this question
we shall have to return, as in connection with it there are certain
points of very considerable interest.

Every local totemic group has its own *Intichiuma* ceremony, and each
one is held at a time decided upon by the Alatunja under whose direction
it is carried out. Any man who is a member of the totem can attend
irrespective of the class to which he belongs, though, as we have
already pointed out, the great majority of the members of any local
group belong to one moiety of the tribe. In some cases men who are in
the camp at the time when the ceremony is to be performed, and who
belong to the right moiety of the tribe, are invited by the Alatunja to
be present; but this is rather an exceptional thing, and under no
circumstances are men who belong neither to the totem nor to the right
moiety allowed to be present.

In connection with the times at which the ceremonies are held, it may be
said that while the exact time is fixed by the Alatunja in each case,
yet the matter is largely dependent on the nature of the season. The
*Intichiuma* are closely

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

associated with the breeding of the animals and the flowering of the
plants with which each totem is respectively identified, and as the
object of the ceremony is to increase the number of the totemic animal
or plant, it is most naturally held at a certain season. In Central
Australia the seasons are limited, so far as the breeding of animals and
the flowering of plants is concerned, to two—a dry one of uncertain and
often great length, and a rainy one of short duration and often of
irregular occurrence. The latter is followed by an increase in animal
life and an exuberance of plant growth which, almost suddenly,
transforms what may have been a sterile waste into a land rich in
various forms of animals, none of which have been seen for it may be
many months before, and gay with the blossoms of endless flowering
plants.

In the case of many of the totems it is just when there is promise of
the approach of a good season that it is customary to hold the ceremony.
While this is so, it sometimes happens that the members of a totem, such
as, for example, the rain or water totem, will hold their *Intichiuma*
when there has been a long drought and water is badly wanted; if rain
follows within a reasonable time, then of course it is due to the
influence of the *Intichiuma*; if it does not, then the non-success is
at once attributed to the evil and counter influence of some, usually,
distant group of men. With the meaning of the ceremonies we shall deal
later on; meanwhile it may be said here that their performance is not
associated in the native mind with the idea of appealing to the
assistance of any supernatural being.

INTICHIUMA OF THE UDNIRRINGITA OR WITCHETTY GRUB TOTEM

 

When the ceremony is to be peformed at Alice Springs the men assemble in
the main camp, and then those who are about to take part in the
proceedings leave the camp quietly, slinking away to a meeting place not
far off, the women and men who do not belong to the totem not being
supposed to know that they are gone. A few, perhaps two or three, of the
older men of the totem stay in camp, and next morning they ask <span
id="page_171">p. 171</span> the men who do not belong to the totem to
return early from their hunting. Every man has left all his weapons in
the camp, for all must go quite unarmed and without any decoration of
any kind; even the hair girdle, the one constant article of clothing
worn by the men, must be left in camp. They all walk in single file
except the Alatunja, who sometimes takes the lead and at others walks by
the side of the column to see that the line is kept. On no account must
any of the men, except the very old ones, eat any kind of food until the
whole ceremony is over; anything which may be caught in the way of game
has to be handed over to the old men. The procession usually starts late
in the afternoon, so that it is dusk by the time that a special camping
ground near to the Emily Gap is reached, and here they lie down for the
night.

At daylight the party begins to pluck twigs from the gum trees at the
mouth of the Gap, and every man carries a twig in <span id="page_172">p.
172</span> each hand except the Alatunja, who carries nothing save a
small *pitchi* or wooden trough, which is called *Apmara*. <span
id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) Walking again in single file they
follow—led by the Alatunja—the path traversed by the celebrated
Intwailiuka, the great leader of the Witchetty grubs in the Alcheringa,
until they come to what is called the *Ilthura oknira*, which is placed
high up on the western wall of the Gap. In this, which is a shallow
cave, a large block of quartzite lies, and around it are some small
rounded stones. The large mass represents the *Maegwa*, that is, the
adult animal. The Alatunja begins singing and taps the stone with his
*Apmara*, while all the other men tap it with their twigs, chanting
songs as they do so, the burden of which is an invitation to the animal
to lay eggs. When this has gone on for a short time they tap the smaller
stones, which are *Churinga unchima*, that is, they represent the eggs
of the *Maegwa*. The Alatunja then takes up one of the smaller stones
and strikes each man in the stomach with it, saying, “*Unga murna
oknirra ulquinna*” (“You have eaten much food”). When this has been done
the stone is dropped and the Alatunja strikes the stomach of each man
with his forehead, an operation which is called *atnitta ulpilima*.
Leaving the *Ilthura* the men descend from the range to the bed of the
creek in the Gap, and stop under the rock called *Alknalinta*, that is,
the decorated eyes, where, in the Alcheringa, Intwailiuka used to cook,
pulverise and eat the grub. The Alatunja strikes the rock with his
*Apmara*, and each man does the same with his twigs, while the older men
again chant invitations to the animal to come from all directions and
lay eggs. At the base of the rock, buried deeply in the sand, there is
supposed to be a very large *Maegwa* stone.

It was at this spot that Intwailiuka used to stand while he threw up the
face of the rock numbers of *Churinga unchima*, which rolled down again
to his feet; accordingly the Alatunja does the same with some of the
Churinga which have been

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

brought from the store-house close by. While he is doing this the other
members of the party run up and down the face of the rocky ledge,
singing all the time. The stones roll down into the bed of the creek and
are carefully gathered together and replaced in the store.

The men now fall once more into single file and march in silence to the
nearest *Ilthura*, which is about a mile and a half away from the Gap in
the direction of Alice Springs. The Alatunja goes into the hole, which
is four or five feet deep, and scoops out with his *Apmara* any dirt
which may have accumulated in it, singing as he does so a low monotonous
chant about the *Uchaqua*. Soon he lays bare two stones which have been
carefully covered up in the base of the hole; the larger one is called
*Churinga uchaqua*, and represents the chrysalis stage from which
emerges the adult animal; the smaller is one of the *Churinga unchima*
or egg. When they are exposed to view, songs referring to the *Uchaqua*
are sung, <span id="page_174">p. 174</span> and the stones are solemnly
handled and cleaned with the palm of the hand. One by one the men now go
into the *Ilthura*, and the Alatunja, lifting up the *Churinga uchaqua*,
strikes the stomach of each man with it, saying again, “You have eaten
much food.” Finally, dropping the stone, he butts (this is the only word
expressive of the action) at each man in the abdomen with his forehead.

There are altogether some ten of these *Ilthura*, in each one of which
is a *Churinga uchaqua*, and each *Ilthura* is visited in turn by the
party and the same ceremony is repeated.

When the round of the *Ilthura* has been made and the same ceremony
enacted at each one, then a start is made for the home camp. When within
a mile or so of the latter they stop and decorate themselves with
material which has been purposely brought to the spot. Hair string is
tied round their heads, <span id="page_175">p. 175</span> and *Chilara*
or forehead bands are put on, beneath which twigs of the
*Udnirringa* <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md) bush are fixed so that
they hang downwards. Nose bones are thrust through the nasal septum, and
rat tails and topknots of cockatoo feathers are worn in the hair. The
Alatunja is but little decorated; he has only the *Chilara* across his
forehead, and the *Lalkira* or nose bone. Under his arm he carries the
*Apmara*, and in his hand a twig of the *Udnirringa* bush. While the men
walk along they keep their twigs in constant motion, much as if they
were brushing off flies. The totem *Ilkinia* or sacred design is painted
on the body of each man with red ochre and pipe clay, and the latter is
also used to paint the face, except for the median line of red. When the
decorations are complete a start is again made, all walking in single
file, the Alatunja at the head with his *Apmara* under his arm. Every

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

now and then they stop and the old Alatunja, placing his hand above his
eyes, as if to shade the latter, strikes an attitude as he peers away
into the distance. He is supposed to be looking out for the women who
were left in camp. The old man, who had been left in charge at the camp
during the absence of the party, is also on the look-out for the return
of the latter. While the men have been away he has built, away from the
main camp, a long, narrow wurley, which is called *Umbana*, and is
intended to represent the chrysalis case from which the *Maegwa* or
fully-developed insect emerges. Near to this spot all those who have not
been taking part in the ceremony assemble, standing behind the *Umbana*.
Those men who belong to the other moiety of the tribe—that is, to the
Purula and the Kumara—are about forty or fifty yards away, sitting down
in perfect silence; and the same distance further back the Panunga and
Bulthara women are standing, with the Purula and Kumara women sitting
down amongst them. The first-named women are painted with the totem
*Ilkinia* of red and white lines; the second are painted with lines of
white faintly tinged with red. When the old man at length sees the party
approaching he steps out and sings—

“Ilkna pung kwai, Yaalan ni nai, Yu mulk la, Naan tai yaa lai.”

 

The Alatunja, as the party comes slowly along, stops every now and then
to peer at the women. Finally all reach the *Umbana* and enter it. When
all are inside they begin to sing of the animal in its various stages,
and of the *Alknalinta* stone and the great *Maegwa* at it base. As soon
as the performers enter the wurley, the Purula and Kumara men and women
lie face downwards, and in this position they must remain until they
receive permission to arise. They are not allowed to stir under any
pretext whatever. The singing continues for some time; then the Alatunja
in a squatting position shuffles out of the *Umbana*, gliding slowly
along over the space in front, which has been cleared for a distance of
some yards. He is followed by all the men, who sing of the emerging of
the *Maegwa* from its case, the *Umbana*. Slowly they shuffle out and
back again until all <span id="page_177">p. 177</span> are once more in
the wurley, when the singing ceases and food and water are brought to
them by the old man who had remained in camp and built the *Umbana*.
This, it must be remembered, is the first food or drink which they have
partaken of since they originally left the camp, as, except in the case
of the very old men, it is peremptory that the ceremony be carried out
without any eating or drinking on the part of the participants. When it
is dusk they leave the wurley, and go round to the side away from that
on which the Purula and Kumara men are lying, so that, to a certain
extent, they are <span id="page_178">p. 178</span> hidden from their
view. A large fire is lighted, and round this they sit, singing of the
witchetty grub. This is kept up till some little time before daybreak,
and during all that time the women of the right moiety must stand
peering about into the darkness to see if the women of the other moiety,
over whom they are supposed to keep watch, continue to lie down. They
also peer about, watching the *Intichiuma* party just as the women did
in the Alcheringa. Suddenly the singing ceases, and the fire is quickly
put out by the Alatunja. This is the signal for the release of the
Purula and Kumara men and women, who jump to their feet, and these men
and all the women of whatever class they may be, at once run away to the
main camp. The *Intichiuma* party remains at the wurley until daylight,
when the men go near to the *Ungunja*, <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md) make a fire and strip themselves of all
their ornaments, throwing away their *Udnirringa* twigs. When all the
*Uliara, Imitnya, Lalkira* and cockatoo feathers are removed, the
Alatunja says, “Our *Intichiuma* is finished, the *Mulyanuka* must have
these things or else our *Intichiuma* would not be successful, and some
harm would come to us.” They all say, “Yes, yes, certainly;” and the
Alatunja calls to the *Mulyanuka* (i.e. men of the other moiety of the
tribe), who are at the *Ungunja*, that is the men's camp, to come up,
and the things are divided amongst them, after which the old man, who
before brought them food, goes to the various camps and collects a
considerable quantity of vegetable food which is given to him by the
women. This is brought back and cooked and eaten by the fire, where they
still remain. During the afternoon the old man again visits the camp,
and brings back with him some red ochre and the fur string which belongs
to the various members of the party, and, just before sundown, the old
men rub red ochre over their bodies, and over those of the younger men,
thus obliterating the *Ilkinia* and the painting on the face. The men
then put on their arm strings, &c., and return to their respective
camps, and with this the main part of the ceremony is brought to a
close. When all is over, the

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Apmara* or
*pitchi* of the Alatunja is held in great regard, and the Panunga and
Bulthara women enjoy the privilege, each in turn, of carrying it about.

INTICHIUMA OF THE ERLIA OR EMU TOTEM

 

The *Intichiuma* of the Erlia or emu group of Strangway Range, differs
very considerably from the ceremony which has just been described, and
it must be remembered that there are considerable differences in detail
between the *Intichiuma* ceremonies of even the different local groups
of the same totem.

We have already described the returning of the emu Churinga to the
Strangway Range men by the members of another group to which they had
been lent, and the following ceremony was performed upon this occasion.
As is always the case, the decision to hold the *Intichiuma* was arrived
at by the Alatunja. He and a few other men, amongst whom were his two
sons, first of all cleared a small level plot of ground, sweeping aside
all stones, tussocks of grass and small bushes, so as to make it as
smooth as possible. Then several of the men, the Alatunja and his two
sons amongst them, each opened a vein in their arms, and allowed the
blood to stream out until the surface of a patch of ground, occupying a
space of about three square yards, was saturated with it. The blood was
allowed to dry, and in this way a hard and fairly impermeable surface
was prepared, on which it was possible to paint a design. This is the
only occasion on which we have known of any such method being adopted.
With white pipe clay, red and yellow ochre, and powdered charcoal mixed
with grease, the sacred design of the emu totem was then outlined on the
ground. In this particular case, when the design was for the special
occasion drawn on the ground, it was called an *Ilpintira*, which is
simply one of the *Ilkinia* or totemic designs drawn under these
conditions. The drawing was done by the Alatunja, his blood brothers,
and two sons. It is supposed to represent certain parts of the emu; two
large patches of yellow indicated lumps of fat, of which the natives are
very fond, but the greater part <span id="page_180">p. 180</span>
represented, by means of circles and circular patches, the eggs in
various stages of development, some before and some after laying. Small
circular yellow patches represented the small eggs in the ovary; a black
patch surrounded by a black circle was a fully-formed egg ready to be
laid; while two larger concentric circles meant an egg which has been
laid and incubated, so that a chicken has been formed. In addition to
these marks, various sinuous lines, drawn in black, red, and yellow,
indicate parts of the intestines, the excrement being represented by
black dots. Everywhere over the surface, in and amongst the various
drawings, white spots indicated the feathers of the bird, the whole
device being enclosed by a thin line of pale pink down. It will be
noticed that this design differs in important respects from others
associated with the sacred objects of the totem. The latter, such as the
designs on the Churinga, have no definite relationship, and no attempt
at any resemblance to the objects which they are supposed to indicate,
but in this drawing, though it is to a certain extent conventionalised,
still we can see very clearly that an attempt is made to actually
represent the objects. The large yellow patches representing fat, the
small yellow circles the eggs in the ovary, and the patches with
enclosing circles, eggs with shells, serve to show that the original
designer had a definite idea of making the drawing, conventional though
it be to a large extent, indicative of the objects which it is supposed
to represent.

During the day, and in fact throughout the whole ceremony, the Alatunja
was treated with the greatest deference; no one spoke to him except in a
whisper, and he it was who regulated the whole proceedings, even down to
the minutest detail.

The drawing, or *Churinga ilpintira*, was completed before the arrival
of the messengers bearing the borrowed Churinga, and, when done, it was
carefully concealed from view with branches. After the Churinga had been
returned with the formalities already detailed, the Alatunja informed
the visitors of his intention to perform *Intichiuma*, and, rising from
the ground, he led the way, carrying the Churinga, to the spot close by
where the *Ilpintira* was concealed. He removed the <span
id="page_181">p. 181</span> boughs, and, placing the Churinga on one
side, squatted down, all the rest of the men following his example. In
the intervals of a monotonous chant, which lasted for half an hour, he
explained the different parts of the drawing, which was then again
covered up and the men returned to the original meeting place, where,
for the rest of the night, they chanted, sitting round the Churinga.

During the night three large wooden Churinga, each about four feet in
length, were decorated with series of concentric circles of red and
yellow ochre and of white pipe clay, and tipped with bunches of emu
feathers and the red-barred tail feathers of the black cockatoo. The
Alatunja selected three of the older men to act the part of *Inniakwa*,
who are supposed to represent ancestors of the emu totem of considerable
antiquity, but not so far back as the Alcheringa. At the same time a
number of the younger men were chosen to act the part of *Illiura*, who
are the descendants of the <span id="page_182">p. 182</span> *Inniakwa*,
and they were painted on their chests with designs belonging to the
totem, in charcoal and white down.

At daylight the decorated Churinga were fixed on the heads of the
*Inniakwa*, and, while three or four of the *Illiura* were despatched to
the women's camp, the rest of the men assembled at, and sang round, the
drawing. Just at sunrise the party left the camping ground and went to
an open space, which had been previously selected for the purpose, on
the opposite side of a ridge of low scrub-covered hills. The *Illiura*
had meanwhile driven the women and children out from their camp, and
shortly after the arrival of the main party of men the former came
running towards the ceremonial ground and took up a position at one end.
The *Inniakwa* stood in the centre some distance away from, but still
clearly seen by, the women and children, and without moving their feet
imitated the aimless gazing about of the emu, each man holding a bunch
of twigs in his hands, the <span id="page_183">p. 183</span> Churinga on
the head with its tuft of feathers being intended to represent the long
neck and small head of the bird. The women watched intently, for this is
one of the very few occasions on which they are allowed to see, even at
a distance, a sacred ceremony. Then, with a curious gliding movement,
the performers moved in the direction of the women, who thereupon
uttered cries of alarm. Once more the three men stood quietly, moving
only their heads, and then again ran for a few yards. Upon this the
women turned and fled towards their camp, while the audience of men
moved their arms as if with the one to urge the women to run away and
with the other to call back the *Inniakwa* to the centre of the ground.

When the women and children were out of sight the *Inniakwa*,
accompanied by the other men, ran over the low hill back to the camping
ground, where the Churinga were taken from the heads of the *Inniakwa*
and placed upright in the ground. About midday the Churinga, which had
been brought back by the visiting group and had been placed on a small
platform, were taken down and brought to the centre of the ceremonial
ground, where they were again examined and rubbed with red ochre by the
Alatunja and the older men to the accompaniment of continuous chanting
on the part of the other men who sat around. When this was over all
gathered together at the *Ilpintira*, the meaning of which was again
explained by the Alatunja. Singing continued at intervals during the
day, and just before dusk three newly appointed *Inniakwa* were
decorated, the *Illiura* again drove the women and children from their
camp to the ceremonial ground, and the performance of the early morning
was repeated.

On the second day precisely the same programme was gone through, after
which the men returned to their camping place, the three Churinga were
divested of their decorations, the *Ilpintira* was very carefully
obliterated by the Alatunja and his sons, and the ceremony came to an
end. The strange natives then went back to their country, and the
returned Churinga were taken by the Alatunja and the old men of his
group and placed in the sacred store-house.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

INTICHIUMA OF THE UNJIAMBA OR HAKEA FLOWER TOTEM

 

At a place called Ilyaba the ceremony is performed by men of the
Bulthara and Panunga classes, and the exact spot at which it takes place
is a shallow, oval-shaped pit, by the side of which grows an ancient
Hakea tree. In the centre of the depression is a small projecting and
much worn block of stone, which is supposed to represent a mass of
Unjiamba or Hakea flowers, the tree being the *Nanja* tree of an
Alcheringa woman whose reincarnation is now alive.

Before the ceremony commences the pit is carefully swept clean by an old
Unjiamba man, who then strokes the stone all over with his hands. When
this has been done the men sit around the stone and a considerable time
is spent in singing chants, the burden of which is a reiterated
invitation to the Unjiamba tree to flower much, and to the blossoms to

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

be full of honey. Then the old leader asks one of the young men to open
a vein in his arm, which he does, and allows the blood to sprinkle
freely over the stone, while the other men continue the singing. The
blood flows until the stone is completely covered, the flowing of blood
being supposed to represent the preparation of *Abmoara*, that is, the
drink which is made by steeping the flower in water, this being a very
favourite beverage of the natives. As soon as the stone is covered with
blood the ceremony is complete.

The stone is regarded as a Churinga, and the spot is *ekirinja*, or
forbidden to the women, children and uninitiated men.

INTICHIUMA OF THE ILPIRLA OR MANNA TOTEM

 

*Ilpirla* is a form of “manna,” very similar to the well-known
sugar-manna of gum trees but peculiar to the mulga tree (*Acacia
aneura*).

About five or six miles to the west of Ilyaba there is a great boulder
of grey-coloured gneissic rock, curiously marked with black and white
seams, at which the men of the Ilpirla totem perform the ceremony of
*Intichiuma*. On the top of the boulder, which stands about five feet
above the ground, there is a similar stone weighing about twenty pounds,
together with smaller ones, all of which represent masses of *Ilpirla*.
The large boulder, on which the others lie, has the same significance,
and is supposed to have been deposited there in the Alcheringa by a man
of the Ilpirla totem, who has at the present time no living
representative.

When *Intichiuma* is performed, a clear space is first of all swept
round the base of the stone, and after this the Alatunja digs down into
the earth at the base of the boulder, and discloses to view a Churinga
which has been buried there ever since the Alcheringa, and is supposed
to represent a mass of *Ilpirla*. Then he climbs on to the top of the
boulder and rubs it with the Churinga, after which he takes the smaller
stones and with these rubs the same spot, while the other men sitting
around sing loudly, “*Inka parunta, nartnapurtnai, urangatcha chuntie,
urungatcha chuntie*.”

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

The meaning of these words is an invitation to the dust produced by the
rubbing of the stones to go out and produce a plentiful supply of
*Ilpirla* on the mulga trees. Then with twigs of the mulga he sweeps
away the dust which has gathered on the surface of the stone, the idea
being to cause it to settle upon the mulga trees and so produce
*Ilpirla*. When the Alatunja has done this, several of the old men in
turn mount the boulder and the same ceremony is repeated. Finally, the
Churinga is buried at the base in its old position, and with this the
ceremony closes.

INTICHIUMA OF THE YARUMPA <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md) OR
HONEY-ANT TOTEM

 

In this ceremony, as performed at Ilyaba, the majority of men are
Panunga and Bulthara, only a few Kumara and Purula belonging to the
totem.

At early morning on the appointed day the men assemble at the men's
camp, where they decorate their foreheads, arms and noses with twigs of
the *Udnirringa* bush and smear their bodies all over with dry red
ochre. Then they march in single file, the Alatunja at the head, to a
spot about fifty yards from, and opposite to, the *Erlukwirra* or
women's camp, where the women and children stand silently. Here the
Alatunja, turning his back upon the women, places his hand as if he were
shading his eyes and gazes away in the direction of the *Intichiuma*
ground, each man as he does so kneeling behind him so as to form a
straight line between the women and the *Intichiuma* ground. In this
position they remain for some time, while the Alatunja chants in subdued
tones. After this has been done, all stand up, and the Alatunja goes to
the rear of the column and gives the signal to start. In perfect silence
and with measured step, as if something of the greatest importance were
about to take place, the men walk in single file, taking a direct course
to the ground. Every few yards the Alatunja, who is in the rear, goes
out first to one side and then to the other, to see that the men keep a
straight line.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

After having traversed perhaps half a mile one man is sent by the
Alatunja to the *Ertnatulunga* to bring a special stone Churinga, which
is required during the ceremony.

The *Intichiuma* ground is situated in a depression in a rocky range, at
a considerable elevation above the surrounding plains, and all over the
depression are blocks of stone standing up on end and leaning in all
directions, each of which is associated with a honey-ant man of the
Alcheringa.

The messenger sent to the *Ertnatulunga* arrives at the ground as the
party approaches; he has to go a long way round, and must run the whole
way.

All the men then group themselves round a pit-like depression in the
rocks which is surrounded with a horseshoe-shaped wall of stone, open at
the western end. On the east side is an ancient mulga tree, which is the
abode of the spirit of an Alcheringa man, whose duty it was to guard the
sacred ground. In the centre of the pit is a stone, which projects for
about eighteen inches above the ground, and is the *Nanja* of an
Alcheringa man who originated here and performed *Intichiuma*.

On the arrival of the party the Alatunja at once goes down into the pit,
and some time is spent in clearing out the débris, while the other men
stand round in perfect silence. After a time he beckons to some of the
older men to come down and assist him, and then they all begin to sing
while the sacred stone, which represents an Alcheringa man called
Erkiaka, is disclosed to view and taken out of the earth, together with
a smaller smooth round pebble, which represents a mass of honey
collected by the ants and carried about by the man.

When the stone has been taken out it is rubbed over reverently with
their hands by the old men, and then rubbed over with the smaller stone,
after which it is replaced in the ground. This done, the big stone
Churinga from the *Ertnatulunga*, which represents a mass of honey
carried about by a celebrated *Oknirabata* <span
id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md) of the Alcheringa, named Ilatirpa,

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

is brought up. This Ilatirpa was the leader of the Yarumpa and sent out
the wandering parties who started from this spot. In the *Ertnatulunga*
is a long, thin, stone Churinga, pointed at each end and evidently very
old, the markings being nearly effaced, which represents the piece of
wood which was carried by Ilatirpa for the purpose of digging up the
ants on which he fed. This and the large Churinga are the only stone
ones in this particular *Ertnatulunga*. <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md)

The old Alatunja takes up the Churinga, and calling the men up one by
one, each of them walks into the pit, and lies down, partly supported on
the knees of two or three of the older men. In this position the
Alatunja, keeping up all the time a low chant, first of all strikes each
man's stomach sharply two or three times with the Churinga, and then
moves it about with a kind of kneading action, while another old man
butts at the stomach with his forehead. When all have passed through
this performance the singing ceases, the Churinga is handed back to the
man who brought it, with instructions to take it back to the
*Ertnatulunga*, and the column forms again and marches back, taking a
different course, which, however, just as on the first occasion, leads
them past the women's camp, where again the women and children are
standing in silence.

On the way home a halt is made at a spot in the Ilyaba creek, where in
the Alcheringa, as now, the final act of the ceremony was performed. On
the banks of the creek are a number of mulga trees, each of which is
associated with, in fact is the *Nanja* tree of, an Alcheringa man, who
stood watching the performance as it was being conducted in the bed of
the creek. In the same way the stones standing out from the banks have
each of them their association with an Alcheringa man. On arrival at
this spot all the men sit down, and about an hour is spent in singing of
the Yarumpa men, of their marchings in the Alcheringa, of the honey, of
the ant nests, of the great man Ilatirpa, and of those Yarumpa men who,
in the Alcheringa, changed into the little birds now called *Alpirtaka*,
which at the present day are the mates of the honey-ant people, to whom
they point out

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

where the ant nests can be found. After some time the decoration of the
Alatunja commences, while he leads the singing, which now has reference
to the men on the banks, who are supposed, in spirit form, to be
watching the performance from their *Nanja* trees. The decorations on
the body of the performer are intended to represent the chambers in the
ant nests, and those on the arms and neck the passages leading to the
inner parts of the nests where the honey-ants are found. The performer
squats on the ground, and for some time the other men run round and
round him in the usual way, while he occupies himself with brushing the
ground between his legs with little twigs, pausing every now and then to
quiver. When this is over the decorations are removed, and the party
starts back for the men's camp, passing as described, the women's camp
on the way.

INTICHIUMA OF THE QUATCHA OR WATER TOTEM

In connection with the making of rain there are certain ceremonies, some
of which are not of the nature of sacred Quabara, and take the form of
ordinary dancing festivals which any member of the tribe, men and women
alike, irrespective of class or totem, are permitted to see; but there
is in addition to these a special and sacred ceremony, only shared in by
the initiated men of the totem, and this is the *Intichiuma*.

As in the case of the kangaroo totem the majority of the members of the
water totem belong to the Purula and Kumara. To them the secret of
rain-making was imparted in the Alcheringa by an individual named
Irtchwoanga, who also settled upon the exact places at which the
ceremony should be performed. One of the most important of the water
totem groups is a local subdivision of the Arunta people, inhabiting a
district of about fifty miles to the east of Alice Springs, this part
being known as *Kartwia quatcha*, or the “rain country.” <span
id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md) The Alatunja of this group at the present
time is

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

a celebrated rain-maker, and the ceremony which is described below is
the one which is performed by him. The office of Alatunja, or as it is
called in these eastern groups “Chantchwa,” descended to him from his
father, who died recently, and the fact that he is now the head man, and
not his elder brother, illustrates an interesting point in regard to the
inheritance of the office of Alatunja in the Arunta tribe. The office
has, in fact, descended to him, and not to his elder brother, for the
simple reason that he was born a water man, while the woman who is the
mother of both of them conceived the elder one in an opossum locality.
The latter man is therefore the reincarnation of an Alcheringa opossum
individual, and so it is of course impossible for him to be the head of
a water group. If the old Alatunja had had no son of the right totem
then the office would have descended to one of his blood brothers—always
provided of course that he were of the right totem—and failing such a
one, to some tribal <span id="page_191">p. 191</span> brother or son of
the water totem as determined upon by the elder men, or, more probably
still, by the old Alatunja before his death. As soon as the Chantchwa
has decided to hold the ceremony he sends out messengers, called
*Inwurra*, to the surrounding groups, to inform them of his intention,
and to call the members of the totem together. In addition to the latter
other men are invited to come, though they will not be allowed to take
any part in the actual *Intichiuma* ceremony. Each messenger carries in
this instance a human hair girdle, a bunch of black cockatoo tail
feathers and a hollow nose bone stopped at one end with a plug made of
the resin obtained from the porcupine-grass, and ornamented at the other
with a small bunch of owl feathers. These objects are the property of
the Chantchwa, and to refuse to attend to the request of a messenger
thus accredited would be considered a grave discourtesy, and the person
committing such an offence would be spoken of as *irquantha*, that is
churlish.

When all are assembled, those who are to take part in the ceremony, that
is the men of the totem, march into camp, painted with red and yellow
ochre and pipeclay, and wearing bunches of eagle-hawk feathers on the
crown and sides of the head. At a signal from the Chantchwa all sit down
in a line, and with arms folded across their breasts sing the following
words for some time:—“*Ulgaranti alkwarai lathrik alkwaranti
ulgaraa-a*.” Suddenly, at another signal from the Chantchwa, all jump to
their feet and silently march out of the camp. They walk in single file,
and camp for the night at a spot some miles away. At daybreak they
scatter in all directions in search of game, which is cooked and eaten,
but on no account must any water be drunk, or the ceremony would fail.
When they have eaten they again paint themselves, this time broad white
bands of bird's down being fixed on as usual with human blood, so that
they encircle the stomach, legs, arms, and forehead. Some of the older
Purula and Kumara men have meanwhile been building a special bough
wurley or hut, which is called *nalyilta* at a spot not far distant from
the main camp, where all the women and those men who are not taking part
in the ceremony have remained behind. The floor of the hut is strewn
with a thick layer of gum leaves to <span id="page_192">p. 192</span>
make it as soft as possible, as a considerable time has to be spent
lying down here. When the decorating is complete, the men march back,
silently and in single file, to where the wurley has been built; this
always takes place about sunset, and on reaching the hut the young men
go in first and lie face downwards at the inner end, where they have to
remain until the ceremony is over. Meanwhile, outside the wurley, some
of the older men are engaged in decorating the Chantchwa. Hair girdles
covered with white down are placed all over the head, while the cheeks
and forehead are covered with pipeclay and two broad bands of white down
pass across the face, one over the eyebrows and the other over the nose.
The front of the body has a broad band of pipeclay outlined with white
down, rings of which adorn the arms. When fully decorated the Chantchwa
takes up a position close to the opening into the wurley, from which
extends, for thirty yards, a shallow trench. The old men, who sit around
him, now begin to sing, and continue to do so for some time, the
following words:—

“Illunga ilartwina unalla

Illunga kau-wu lungalla

Partini yert artnuri elt artnuri

Yerra alt nartnura alla

Partinia yarraa alt nartnurai

Yerra alla partinia atnartnurai

Yokaa wau wai.”

When the singing comes to an end the Chantchwa comes out of the wurley
and walks slowly twice up and down the trench, while he quivers his body
and legs in the most extra-ordinary way—far more than is customary in
other ceremonies in many of which a quivering movement is a
characteristic feature. While this performance is taking place the young
men arise and join the old men in singing—

“Purlaarau kurlaa

Rumpaa arri

Umpaakunla karla

Rumpaa arri

Paakur tai,”

the Chantchwa's movements appearing to accord with the singing. When he
re-enters the wurley the young men at <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>
once lie down again—in fact they are always in this position while the
Chantchwa is in the wurley. The same performance is repeated at
intervals during the night, the singing continuing with but little
intermission, until, just at daybreak, the Chantchwa executes a final
quiver, which lasts longer than usual, and at the end of which he
appears to be thoroughly exhausted, the physical strain of the
performance having been, as can be well imagined, of a severe nature. He
then declares the ceremony to be at an end, and at once the young men
jump to their feet and rush out of the wurley, screaming in imitation of
the spur-winged plover. The cry is heard in the main camp, and is taken
up with weird effect by the men and women who have remained there. The
decorations of the Chantchwa are removed, and then all march, led by
him, to a spot just within sight of the main camp, where an old Purula
or Kumara woman has cleared a large space and then covered it with
gum-tree leaves. Here they lie down for a short time and then go to the
main camp, where food and water await them. The whole performance may
last forty-eight hours, and on the next night one of the ordinary rain
dances, as they are popularly called by white men, is held, in which all
the men take part, either as performers or as audience. The women do not
perform, but may look on and assist in singing and beating time to the
dancing of the men.

UNDIARA

 

About fifteen miles to the east of Henbury, on the Finke River, is a
spot called by the natives Undiara. <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md)
Here, at the base of a steep quartzite ridge, which runs east and west,
and forms part of what is now called Chandler's Range, there lies under
the shelter of a gum tree a small water-hole, which has ever since the
far away times of the Alcheringa been associated with the members of the
Okira or kangaroo totem. From

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

the side of the water-hole the rocks rise perpendicularly for some fifty
feet, and over them, in the short rainy seasons, the water falls from a
pool on a rock ledge, behind which again rises the bare summit of the
ridge. This pool arose to mark the spot where the Engwura fires burned
in the Alcheringa, and the ledge is called by the natives the *Mirra
Engwura*, or Engwura camp of the Alcheringa. In dry seasons there is no
water. From the rocks a small gum creek meanders away, but is soon lost
in the dry sandy country stretching out to the south.

Immediately on the eastern side of the water-hole is a shallow cave,
about twenty feet in height and thirty in length, where the rocks have
weathered in such a way as to leave a ledge of rock about ten feet high,
running along the length of the cave, the top of which can be gained by
a partly natural, partly artificial series of rough steps lying at the
end next to the pool. Tradition says that on this ledge the Alcheringa
men cooked and eat their kangaroo food.

A short distance away from the eastern side of the cave is a curious
rocky ridge, with a very sharply marked vertical slit, which indicates
the spot where an Alcheringa Kumara man named Abmilirka performed the
rite of *Ariltha* upon himself.

The ledge arose, so says tradition, in the first instance to mark the
spot where the body of a great kangaroo was deposited in the Alcheringa.
It was, in fact, the *Nanja* stone of this kangaroo inhabited by its
spirit part; and tradition says further that to this stone came great
numbers of other kangaroo animals, who went into the earth, leaving
their spirits in the same way in the rocky ledge. To this tradition we
shall have to refer at a later time, when discussing the nature of the
*Intichiuma* ceremonies; meanwhile the interesting point may be drawn
attention to, that, just as the Alcheringa individual has his *Nanja*
tree or stone, so in certain cases such as this the Alcheringa animal is
possessed of one. In this instance, for example, the natives are very
clear upon the subject that the tradition deals with an animal and not
with an Alcheringa man—in fact, one of the latter was in pursuit of and
killed the former, dragging the body into Undiara.

Another tradition relates how one night a group of kangaroo <span
id="page_195">p. 195</span> Alcheringa men had arranged a number of
*Nurtunjas* or sacred poles close by the water-hole, with a specially
large one in the centre and smaller ones all round it. While they slept
two Alcheringa women of the Unjiamba totem came down from the north, and
very quietly, without waking the men, took away the large *Nurtunja*,
and, clambering up a slit, which is still to be seen in the
perpendicular face of the rock above the pool, made their way to the
north again to a place called Arapera, where they kept the *Nurtunja*,
which figures prominently in certain ceremonies connected with that
spot.

This tradition, like very many others dealing with the Alcheringa times,
may be, with little doubt, regarded as indicative of the fact that at
some past time the women were possessed of greater privileges than they
enjoy at the present <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> day. There is a
great gap between the Alcheringa and recent times, and a very noticeable
feature is the change which has in some way been brought about with
regard to the position of women. The contrast in this respect may be
well seen from a comparison of the former tradition with one which
relates to a time which the natives say was very long ago, but since the
Alcheringa. At this time the women were not allowed to go anywhere near
to Undiara, where the sacred Churinga of the group were stored. One day,
however, a woman, being very thirsty, ventured in to the water-hole to
drink and saw the sacred pool and the ceremonial stone. She was detected
in the act, and after a great deal of what the natives call “growling”
at her, it was decided to punish her by making her for the time being
common property to all the men—a punishment which is not infrequently
inflicted after the committal of some serious offence, as an alternative
to that of being put to death. In consequence of this men of all classes
had intercourse with her, and when this was over she was returned to her
proper *Unawa* man.

After, however, the woman had seen the place, the peculiar sacredness of
the spot was lost, the Churinga were removed to another place, and the
women were allowed to see the water-hole, except of course when the
ceremony of *Intichiuma* was being performed. As a matter of fact,
though a woman would not actually be put to death if she came near, the
old feeling is still so strong that the women do not often venture near
to the spot unless compelled to do so by thirst.

We may now give a short account of one or two traditions which are
concerned with Undiara and the kangaroo totem, as they serve to
illustrate certain points of interest in connection with the totems and
totemic animals generally.

THE HISTORY OF UNGUTNIKA OF UNDIARA

 

At the present day there is living an aged man of the Okira or kangaroo
totem, named Ungutnika. He is the reincarnation of a celebrated kangaroo
of the Alcheringa, who sprang into existence at Undiara, close to the
big gum tree which overhangs the water pool. Ungutnika was sorely
afflicted with <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> boils, called *Tukira*,
which appeared first in the form of hard lumps. He bore with them for a
long time, and then, being angry, pulled them out and placed them on the
ground alongside of where he sat. <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md)
They became changed into stones, and have remained there ever since. He
was not as yet fully grown, and was an *Okira kurka*, or a little
kangaroo, and after a short time he set out to go to a place called
Okirilpa. After he had travelled about three miles, he came to an open
plain, upon which he saw a mob of *Ukgnulia*, or wild dogs, who had come
from Okirilpa, and were then lying down close to their mother, who was
very large. He hopped about looking at the wild dogs, and presently they
saw and chased him, and, though he hopped away as fast as he could, they
caught him on a plain called Chulina, and, tearing him open, eat first
his liver, and then, removing the skin, they threw it on one side and
stripped all the meat from off the bones. When they had done this they
again lay down.

Ungutnika was not however completely destroyed, for the skin and bones
remained, and, in front of the dogs, the skin came and covered the
bones, and he stood up again and ran away, followed by the dogs, who
caught him this time at Ulima, a hill a little to the north of a spot
now called the Bad Crossing on the Hugh River. Ulima means the liver,
and is so called because on this occasion the dogs did not eat the
liver, but threw it on one side, and the hill, which is a dark-looking
one, arose to mark the spot. The same performance was once more gone
through, and again Ungutnika ran away, this time as far as Pulpunja,
which is the name given to a peculiar sound made in imitation of little
bats, and at this spot Ungutnika turned round and, jeering derisively at
the dogs, made the noise. He was at once caught, cut open, and again
reconstituted himself, much to the wonder of his pursuers. After this he
ran straight towards Undiara, followed by the dogs, and when he reached
a spot close to the water-hole they caught and eat him, and, cutting off
his tail, buried it at the place where it still remains in the form of a
stone, which is called the *Churinga okira pura*, or Kangaroo tail
Churinga,

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

which is always shown and carefully rubbed at the *Intichiuma* ceremony.
The Churinga which he carried with him was associated with his spirit
part, and the latter has since entered into a woman and been born in
human form.

THE KANGAROO AND THE KANGAROO MEN

 

A Kumara man named Ulpunta, whose last descendant was a celebrated
medicine man, who died during the course of the Engwura ceremony
described in this work, started from Okruncha, carrying only spears and
other weapons and no *Nurtunja*. He was in pursuit of a large kangaroo,
which carried a small *Nurtunja*, and followed it till he came close to
Chuntilla, but being unable to catch it, gave up the chase and turned
back, a stone arising to mark the spot. He ever afterwards stayed at
Okruncha. The kangaroo went on and camped at Chuntilla, and a stone
marks the spot where it stood up and looked over the country. Here it
was seen by a Bulthara man of the Arunga or euro totem, who at once
changed himself into an Okira or kangaroo man and gave chase to the
kangaroo, as he wanted to kill and eat it. For a long way he followed
the kangaroo, the two camping apart from each other at various places.
At Thungalula or Pine Tree Gap, in the Macdonnell Range, the kangaroo
made a large *Nurtunja* and carried it away to Ilpartunga, not far from
Owen's Springs, a small sand-hill arising where the animal lay down, and
a mulga tree where the man camped. Travelling south along the Hugh
River, they came to Alligera, where the kangaroo planted his *Nurtunja*,
a large gum tree now marking the spot. Hearing a noise, he raised
himself up on his hind legs and saw a kangaroo running about. A stone
twenty-five feet high now represents him standing on his hind legs.
After this he scratched out a hole for the purpose of getting water, and
this hole has remained to the present day. Travelling south, he came to
the Doctor's Stones, and here erected the *Nurtunja* for the last time,
as he was too tired to carry it any further, so it was left standing and
became changed into a fine gum tree, which is now called *Apera
Nurtunja*, or the *Nurtunja* tree.

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

Still following down the Hugh River, the kangaroo reached Ulpmura
utterly worn out, and lay down. In a little time a number of kangaroo
men from Undiara came up and saw the Bulthara man, who had also arrived.
The Undiara men, using gesture language, said to the Bulthara man, “Have
you got big spears?” And he replied, “No, only little ones; have you got
big spears?” And they replied, “No, only little ones.” Then the Bulthara
man said, “Put down your spears on the ground;” and they replied, “Yes,
put yours down too.” Then the spears were thrown down, and all the men
advanced upon the kangaroo, the Bulthara man keeping in his hand a
shield and his Churinga. The kangaroo was very strong and tossed them
all about; then they all jumped upon him, and the Bulthara man, getting
underneath, was trampled to death. The kangaroo also appeared to be
dead. They buried the Bulthara man with his shield and Churinga, and
then took the body of the kangaroo into Undiara. The animal was not then
really dead, but soon died, and was placed in the cave but not eaten.
The rock ledge in the cave arose where the body was put, and when the
animal was dead its spirit part went into this, which thus became the
animal's *Nanja*. Shortly afterwards the men died, and their spirit
parts went into the water pool close by. Tradition says that great
numbers of kangaroo animals came at a later time to the cave, and there
went down into the ground, their spirits also going into the stone.

INTICHIUMA OF THE OKIRA OR KANGAROO TOTEM

 

In the Alcheringa the Okira or kangaroo men of Undiara belonged almost,
but not quite, entirely to the Purula and Kumara moiety of the tribe;
and at the present day the same holds true, but to a somewhat less
extent, for, as in the case of all totems, there is a certain admixture
of the members of both moieties. The head man, or Alatunja, is a Purula,
and under his direction the ceremony of *Intichiuma* is performed at
intervals, though being now an old man, he sometimes deputes the
performance to his eldest son, who will succeed to the position on the
death of the old man.

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

When the ceremony is to be performed a camp is made at a spot a little
to the west of the cave and out of sight of the water-hole, which is
placed in a slight dip in the range from which the small gum creek
leads. Early in the morning of the day on which the ceremony is to take
place, one of the younger men is sent on ahead to a special spot which
lies about a hundred yards to the west of the water-hole. The object of
this is to make certain that no women or uninitiated men, or men other
than members of the totem, are in the neighbourhood. The main body of
men comes up skirting closely the base of the range, and halts at the
place where the young man is stationed. Here there lies hidden
underground a block of soft grey sandstone, about three feet in length
and one foot in greatest diameter, its shape in transverse section being
triangular. The apex of the stone lies about a foot below the surface,
and as the men gather round the spot, the position of which is precisely
known, <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md) the leader clears away the
sandy soil and brings the sacred stone into view. Its sides, worn smooth
by constant rubbing, are covered over with smaller stones, amongst which
is a special flattened one with which the rubbing is done. The Alatunja
takes this stone in his hands, and in the presence of all the men, who
stand round in perfect silence, rubs over the exposed surface. When this
has been done the stone may be lifted up so as to be seen better. It is
the *Churinga okira pura*, that is, the tail of the Alcheringa kangaroo,
which was driven in by the wild dogs from Okirilpa, and deposited by
them, as already described, in the ground at this spot. Certain large
blocks of sandstone, which have evidently tumbled down from the hillside
and lay close by—the largest of them being fully eight feet in
height—are said to represent the dead bodies of the wild dogs.

After the stone has been rubbed by the Alatunja and then examined by all
present, it is covered up and the party moves onward, still skirting the
base of the hill, so that the cave and ceremonial stone are not seen
until they are close at hand. A halt is made at the water-hole on the
side away from the cave, where the men drink, and then come round

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

and sit right in front of, and at the base of the ceremonial stone. On
the left hand, looking towards the stone, sit the Panunga and Bulthara
men, and on the right the Purula and Kumara. Then the head man, who is
at the present day a Purula, and a man to whom he is *Gammona*, and who
is therefore Bulthara, go out from the rest, who remain seated, and
climb up the hill-side just to the east of the stone. Here at a height
of about twenty feet above the level of the plain, are two special
blocks of stone projecting immediately above one another from the
hill-side. One is supposed to represent an “old man” kangaroo and the
other a female. The former is rubbed with a stone by the Purula man and
the latter by the Bulthara man. This over, the two men descend and
rejoin the main party, which is the signal for the decoration of the
rock-ledge to begin. Red ochre and powdered and calcined gypsum are
used, and with these alternate vertical lines are painted on the face of
the rock, each about a foot in width, the painting of the left side
being done by the Panunga and Bulthara men, and that of the right by the
Purula and Kumara.

The red stripes are supposed to represent the red fur of the kangaroo
(*Macropus rufus*), while the white ones represent the bones.

When the painting is done, a certain number of young men, perhaps two or
three Panunga and Bulthara and five or six Purula and Kumara, go on to
the top of the ledge. The former sit down at the left and the latter at
the right side, and then they open veins in their arms and allow the
blood to spurtle out over the edge of the ceremonial stone on the top of
which they are seated. While this is taking place, the men below sit
still watching the performers and singing chants referring to the
increase of the numbers of the kangaroos which the ceremony is supposed
to ensure.

When the blood-letting is over, the old men go back to the camp and
remain there, while the rest of the day is spent by the young men out on
the rocks and plains in search of game, which is brought in and
presented to the old men. This may extend over several days, and at
night-time sacred Quabara are performed in camp.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE TOTEM

 

There are certain points of considerable interest with regard to the
totems which may be briefly referred to now, in which certainly the
Arunta and Ilpirra and, in all probability, others of the Central tribes
agree together and differ, so far as is yet known, from other Australian
tribes. The first point is the important one, to which we have had
occasion to make frequent reference, as it is, we may say, the
fundamental feature of the totemic system of these tribes, namely, that
each individual is the direct reincarnation of an Alcheringa ancestor,
or of the spirit part of some Alcheringa animal (as in the case of
Ungutnika of the kangaroo totem), which carried a Churinga, and the
spirit associated with which became, so to speak, humanised, and
subsequently entered a woman and was born in human form.

The second point is concerned with the relationship which at the present
day is supposed to exist between the individual and his totem. A man
will only eat very sparingly of his totem, and even if he does eat a
little of it, which is allowable to him, he is careful, in the case, for
example, of an emu man, not to eat the best part, such as the fat. <span
id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) The totem of any man is regarded, just as
it is elsewhere, as the same thing as himself; as a native once said to
us when we were discussing the matter with him, “that one,” pointing to
his photograph which we had taken, “is just the same as me; so is a
kangaroo” (his totem). That they claim a special connection with, almost
in certain respects a right to, their totemic animal or plant may be
seen from the fact that, for example, in the witchetty grub totem, while
the members of the latter do not eat it, or, at least, only sparingly
themselves,

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

the members of the local group who do not belong to the totem must not
eat it out of camp like ordinary food, but must bring it into camp and
cook it there, else the men of the totem would be angry and the supply
of grubs would fail. We may, in fact say, that each totemic group is
supposed to have a direct control over the numbers of the animal or
plant the name of which it bears, and further that, in theory at least,
they have the first right to the animal or plant. That this is so, and
that it is well recognised, will be seen from the following facts.

The first is concerned with a curious, but suggestive use of a Churinga.
In the possession of a man of the Akakia or plum tree totem, we found a
stone Churinga, roughly circular in shape and about 8 cm. in diameter,
wrapped up carefully in fur string, so as not to be seen by women as he
carried it about with him. It was a Churinga, which had been specially
made for him by a man who was *Ikuntera* or father-in-law to him. The
man belonged to the euro totem, and the Churinga in question was marked
with a design belonging to the same, a series of concentric circles in
the middle of each side representing the intestines of the animal, while
two groups of semi-circles indicated, one of them a male, and the other
a female euro. The Churinga had been sung over or charmed by the euro
man and then given by him to the plum tree man for the purpose of
assisting the latter to hunt the animal.

The second is a series of equally suggestive ceremonies, which are
connected with the close of the *Intichiuma* performance in various
local totem groups.

After the performance of *Intichiuma*, the grub is, amongst the
Witchetty grubs, tabu to the members of the totem, by whom it must, on
no account, be eaten until it is abundant and fully grown; any
infringement of this rule is supposed to result in an undoing of the
effect of the ceremony, and the grub supply would, as a consequence, be
very small. The men of the Purula and Kumara classes, and those of the
Panunga and Bulthara, who are not members of the totem, and did not take
part in the ceremony, may eat it at any time, but it must always be
brought into camp to be cooked. It must, on no account be eaten like
other food, out in the bush, or <span id="page_204">p. 204</span> the
men of the totem would be angry and the grub would vanish. When, after
*Intichiuma*, the grub becomes plentiful and fully grown, the witchetty
grub men, women and children go out daily and collect large supplies,
which they bring into camp and cook, so that it becomes dry and brittle,
and then they store it away in *pitchis* and pieces of bark. At the same
time, those who do not belong to the totem, are out collecting. The
supply of grubs only lasts a very short time—the animals appearing after
rain—and when they grow less plentiful the store of cooked material is
taken to the *Ungunja*, or men's camp, where, acting as usual under
instructions from the Alatunja, all the men assemble. Those who do not
belong to the totem, place their stores before the men who do, and the
Alatunja then takes one *pitchi*, and with the help of other men of the
totem, grinds up the contents between stones. Then he and the same men
all take and eat a little, and when this has been done, he hands back
what remains to the other people. Then he takes one *pitchi* from his
own store and after grinding up the contents, he and the men of the
totem once more eat a little, and then pass the bulk of what remains
over to those who do not belong to the totem.

After this ceremony the Witchetty grub men and women eat very sparingly
of the grub. They are not absolutely forbidden to eat it, but must only
do so to a small extent for, if they were to eat too much, then the
power of successfully performing the *Intichiuma* would depart from
them, and there would be very few grubs. On the other hand it is equally
important for them, and especially for the Alatunja, to eat a little of
the totemic animal as to eat none would have the same effect as eating
too freely.

In the case of the kangaroo totem of Undiara, after the men have allowed
the blood to pour out of their arms over the stone ledge they descend,
and after rubbing themselves all over with red ochre return to the main
camp, which is always placed at some distance from the rock so as to
prevent the women and children from being able to see anything of what
is going on. All of the younger men then go out hunting kangaroo which,
when caught, they bring in to the older men <span id="page_205">p.
205</span> who have stayed in camp. It is taken to the *Ungunja*, or
men's camp, and there the old men of the totem, the Alatunja being in
the middle of them, eat a little and then anoint the bodies of those who
took part in the ceremony with fat from the kangaroo, after which the
meat is distributed to all the men assembled. The men of the totem then
paint their bodies with the totem design or *Ilkinia* in imitation of
the painting on the rock at Undiara, and that night is spent in singing
about the doings of the Alcheringa kangaroo people and animals. On the
next morning the young men again go out hunting and bring in more
kangaroo to the old men, and the ceremony of the previous day is
repeated. The night is spent in singing, and the proceedings terminate
with the performance of a number of sacred Quabara connected with
Undiara, the great centre of the totem. After this the animal is eaten
very sparingly by the kangaroo men, and there are certain parts, such as
the tail, which are regarded as the choice bits, which a kangaroo man,
or of course woman, must on no account touch.

In the Irriakura totem (the Irriakura is the bulb of a Cyperaceous
plant) the members of the totem do not, after *Intichiuma*, eat the
totem for some time. Those who do not belong to the totem bring a
quantity in to the *Ungunja*, where it is handed over to the Alatunja
and other men of the totem, who rub some of the tubers between their
hands, thus getting rid of the husks, and then, putting the tubers in
their mouths, blow them out again in all directions. After this the
Irriakura people may eat sparingly.

In the Idnimita totem (the Idnimita is the grub of a large longicorn
beetle) the grub must not, after *Intichiuma*, be eaten by the members
of the totem until it becomes plentiful, after which those men who do
not belong to the totem collect it and bring it into the *Ungunja*,
where the store is placed before the Alatunja and men of the totem, who
then eat some of the smaller ones and hand back the remainder to the men
who do not belong to the totem. After this the men of the totem may eat
sparingly of the grub.

In the Bandicoot totem the animal is not eaten, after *Intichiuma*,
until it is plentiful. When it is, those who do <span id="page_206">p.
206</span> not belong to the totem go out in search of one which, when
caught, is brought into the *Ungunja*, and there they put some of the
fat from the animal into the mouths of the bandicoot men, and also rub
it over their own bodies. After this the bandicoot men may eat a little
of the animal.

It will be seen from what has now been described that at the present day
the totemic animal or plant, as the case may be, is almost, but not
quite, tabu or, as the Arunta people call it, *ekirinja* to the members
of the totem. At the same time, though a man will tell you that his
totem is the same thing as himself, he does not mean to imply by that
what Grey says with regard to the totems of the natives whom he studied,
and who always killed with reluctance an animal belonging to their totem
under the belief “that some one individual of the species is their
nearest friend, to kill whom would be a great crime, and to be carefully
avoided.” <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94.md)

The members of each totem claim to have the power of increasing the
number of the animal or plant, and in this respect the tradition
connected with Undiara, the great centre of the kangaroo totem, just as
the Emily gap is the great centre of the Witchetty grub totem, is of
especial interest. In the Alcheringa, as we have already described, a
special kangaroo was killed by kangaroo men and its body brought to
Undiara and deposited in the cave close by the water hole. The rocky
ledge arose to mark the spot, and into this entered its spirit part and
also the spirit parts of many other kangaroo animals (not men) who came
subsequently and, as the natives say, went down into the earth here. The
rock is in fact the *Nanja* stone of the kangaroo animals, and to them
this particular rock has just the same relationship as the water hole
close by has to the men. The one is full of spirit kangaroo animals just
as the other is full of spirit men and women. The purpose of the
*Intichiuma* ceremony at the present day, so say the natives, is by
means of pouring out the blood of kangaroo men upon the rock, to drive
out in all directions the spirits of the kangaroo animals and so to
increase the number of the animals. The spirit kangaroo

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

enters the kangaroo animal in just the same way in which the spirit
kangaroo man enters the kangaroo woman.

In this tradition we have probably the clue to the general meaning of
the series of *Intichiuma* ceremonies, the object of each of which is to
increase the number of the totemic animal or plant. Further still,
attention may be drawn to the fact that the object of increasing the
number of the totem is, in all cases, such as that of the Hakea or the
Irriakura or plum tree amongst plants, or the kangaroo, euro, lizard,
snake and so forth amongst animals, in which the totemic animal or plant
is an article of food, that of increasing the food supply. That the
totemic animal or plant is not regarded exactly as a close relative,
whom it would be wrong to kill or to assist anyone else to kill, is very
evident; on the contrary, the members of one totem not only, as it were,
give their permission to those who are not of the totem to kill and eat
the totemic animal or plant, but further, as shown clearly in the case
of the euro man who made and charmed a special Churinga with the express
object of assisting a plum tree man to catch euro, they will actually
help in the destruction of their totem.

The question of the killing and eating of the totem which this opens up,
quite apart from the ceremonial eating of a small portion of the same,
after the performance of *Intichiuma*, is, so far as these tribes are
concerned, one of considerable difficulty to deal with. We may first of
all draw attention to certain points in the traditions which bear upon
the question. These traditions or myths, whichever they be called,
cannot be regarded as having been invented simply to account for certain
customs now practised, for the simple reason that they reveal to us a
state of organisation and a series of customs quite different from, and
in important respects at variance with, the organisation and customs of
the present time. In connection with the eating of the totem, for
example, though we find very circumstantial references to this, there is
no attempt to explain how the present tabu arose, but we find, on the
contrary, that, in the far away times to which the traditions are
supposed to refer, there simply was no such tabu. Under these
circumstances we are probably justified <span id="page_208">p.
208</span> in regarding the traditions in question as actually
indicative of a time when customs in this and in other respects were
very different from those in force at the present day.

So far as the eating of the totem is concerned the following incidents,
amongst others, are of importance. A euro man named Algura-wartna was in
pursuit of a euro which carried fire in its body. After following it up
for some time the man killed it and, taking the fire out of its body,
cooked therewith some euro which he carried with him. After that he
cooked and eat the one which he had killed.

In a Quabara relating to an *Oruncha* <span
id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md) man, the decoration on the head referred
to an Idnimita (grub of beetle) man who was killed by this *Oruncha*.
The man was carrying with him Idnimita grubs, which were specially
represented in the decorations, and on which he was feeding.

In a Chankuna (small edible berry) ceremony a Chankuna man was
represented as eating the berries which he plucked from his beard.

At a spot called Erathippa a plum tree woman was out finding plums to
eat when a man came and stole her *Nurtunja* which she had left in camp.

An Irpunga (fish) man was seen by certain wild cat men during their
wanderings, fishing in a small pool to catch the fish on which he fed.

An opossum man was robbed by another man of the moon which he carried
about with him at night time so as to help him to catch opossums.

During the wanderings of a party of wild cat men they are reported to
have come to a certain spot where they met some men who were what is
called *Ulpmerka* of the plum tree totem. The wild cat men went into the
earth and arose as plum tree men, and after that went on eating plums.

A bandicoot woman started out with a Hakea woman. After some time, she,
the bandicoot woman, made *Quabara undattha*, that is performed a sacred
ceremony, and painted the Hakea woman with down used during the
ceremony, thus changing her into a bandicoot woman, after which, says
the tradition, the latter went on feeding upon bandicoot.

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

An Arunga or euro man started out in pursuit of a kangaroo which he was
anxious to kill and eat but, to enable himself to do this, he first of
all changed himself into a kangaroo man.

These and other statements of a similar nature are so precise (they are,
as it were, often dragged into the tradition apropos of nothing), and
are yet so entirely different from the present customs of the tribe,
that they can only be understood on the hypothesis that they refer to a
former time in which the relationship of the human beings to their
totemic animals or plants was of a different nature from that which now
obtains.

At some earlier time it would appear as if the members of a totem had
the right to feed upon the totemic animal or plant as if this were
indeed a functional necessity, though at the same time it must be
remembered that in the same traditions from which the above extracts
have been made for the purpose of drawing attention to this feature,
there are also plenty of references to men and women eating animals and
plants other than their own totem. <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md)
The idea of a kangaroo man freely eating a kangaroo or a bandicoot woman
feeding on bandicoots is so totally opposed to the present custom of the
tribe that we are obliged to regard these traditions as referring to a
past time when customs in respect of the totems were different from what
they are now.

In his *Vocabulary of the Dialects of South-Western Australia*, <span
id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_97.md) Sir George Grey, when giving the meaning
of certain of the native names for totems, says, in regard to the
Ballaroke, a small opossum, “Some natives say that the Ballaroke family
derived their name from having in former times subsisted principally on
this little animal”; and again of the Nag-karm totem, he says, “From
subsisting principally in former times on this fish, the Nagarnook
family are said to have obtained their name.” In regard further to five
totemic groups, which bear the names of birds, he says, that they, that
is the

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

members of the respective totems, are said to be the birds transformed
into men. The curious agreement between this and what we have just
described as occurring in the Arunta tribe is of considerable interest.
In the latter, the belief in the origin of the members of any totem from
the animal or plant whose name they bear is universal and is regarded as
a satisfactory reason for the totemic name. It may be that in the
traditions dealing with the eating of the totem, we have nothing more
than another attempt to explain the origin of the totem name. Judging,
however, from the curious traditions of the Arunta tribe, taken in
conjunction with the ceremonies of *Intichiuma*, this does not seem to
be so probable as that they point back to a past time when the
restrictions with regard to the eating were very different from those
now in force. It is quite possible that the curious ceremony in which
the members of any local group bring in to the men's camp stores of the
totemic animal or plant and place them before the members of the totem,
thus clearly recognising that it is these men who have the first right
of eating it, as well as the remarkable custom according to which one
man will actually assist another to catch and kill his—*i.e.*, the
former's—totemic animal, may be surviving relics of a custom according
to which, in past times, the members of a totem not only theoretically
had, but actually practised, the right of eating their totem.

It may perhaps be that this eating of the totem shows that for some
reason, as Mr. Frazer <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98.md) has suggested
in the case of certain other tribes in which the totem is eaten, the
respect for the totem has lessened in comparison with what it once was;
but, in face of the solemn ceremony of *Intichiuma* and of the explicit
traditions to which reference has been made, it is difficult to believe
that this can be so. The two traditions, in one of which a bandicoot
woman is stated to have changed her companion, a Hakea woman, into a
bandicoot woman, who after that went on feeding on bandicoot, while in
the other a euro man is described as changing himself into a kangaroo
man for the purpose of being able to pursue, kill and eat a kangaroo,
are perhaps sufficient to show, taken in

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

conjunction with the *Intichiuma* ceremonies, that, in the Arunta and
Ilpirra tribes, a man is most intimately associated with his totem, but
in a way quite unlike that which is usually associated with the idea of
a totem. At the same time, though the relationship is different in
certain respects from that which exists in other tribes, yet it will be
clearly seen that what have been described as the totems agree in
fundamental points with the definition given by Mr. Frazer, <span
id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99.md) viz., “A totem is a class of material
objects which a savage regards with superstitious respect, believing
that there exists between him and every member of the class an intimate
and altogether special relation;” and further still we can see, to use
Mr. Frazer's terms, the existence of both a social and a religious
aspect. The former is not so strongly developed as it is in many other
Australian tribes, amongst whom not only does the totem regulate
marriage, but the members of the totem are bound to mutually assist one
another. In the Arunta tribe the most striking feature from a social
point of view is the strongly local character, though at the same time
it must be remembered that any initiated member of a particular totem,
whatever local group he belongs to, may take part in the totemic
ceremonies. The religious aspect is most clearly seen in connection with
the ceremonies of *Intichiuma* and the subsequent solemn eating of the
totem, though here again the relationship between the man and his totem
cannot be described as one “of mutual respect and protection.” <span
id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_100.md) It seems as if, in the case of the
Central Australian tribes, the totemic system has undergone a somewhat
curious development; at all events, it differs in certain respects from
that of all other Australian tribes with which we are as yet acquainted.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[169:1](ntca08.htm#fr_82.md) If we were to hazard a
suggestion in the attempt to explain the origin of the restriction, it
would lie along the following lines. The Achilpa, as shown in the
traditions of the tribe, may very probably be looked upon as a powerful
group of individuals who at some past time marched over the country.
Possibly they brought with them the disease, at least it is suggestive
in this respect that tradition refers the disease to them and to the
members of no other totem and, as communication with the individuals of
the totem resulted in the spread of the disease, so the idea of danger
associated with any connection with it not unnaturally extended from the
human Achilpa to the animal itself, and thus the latter became tabu. It
may also be noticed that *Erkincha* is prevalent amongst young and not
amongst old people, and that this is parallel with the tabu not applying
strictly to old men and women.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[172:1](ntca08.htm#fr_83.md) This is not especially

therein called Antiarra. After repeatedly hearing it pronounced by a
large number of natives, we have adopted the spelling Undiara.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[202:1](ntca08.htm#fr_93.md) The people of the emu
totem very rarely eat the eggs, unless very hungry and short of food, in
which case they would eat, but not too abundantly. If an emu man found a
nest of eggs, and was very hungry, he might cook one, but he would take
the remainder in to camp and distribute them. If he were not very hungry
all the eggs would be distributed. The flesh of the bird may be eaten
sparingly, but only a very little of the fat; the eggs and fat are more
*ekirinja* or tabu than the meat. The same principle holds good through
all the totems, a carpet snake man will eat sparingly of a poor snake,
but he will scarcely touch the reptile if it be fat.
