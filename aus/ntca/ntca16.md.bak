## Chapter XIV Customs Relating to Burial and Mourning

**Earth burial in the Arunta tribe—Depression made on the side of the
grave facing the place from which the spirit of the individual came
originally—Hair cut off a man—As a general rule nothing buried with the
body—Burning of the camp—Amongst the Warramunga and northern tribes the
body is placed on a platform in a tree until the flesh has shrivelled
up—Degrees of silence to be observed by different individuals in regard
to mentioning the name of the dead—Special restrictions on the
sons-in-law of a dead man—The widow paints herself with pipeclay, and at
first remains in camp, silent, speaking by means of gesture
language—Ceremony to remove the ban of silence—Widow and younger
brothers—Ceremony of *Urpmilchima* at the grave—Wearing of the bone
chaplet—The women cutting themselves upon the grave—*Urpmilchima* of a
woman—No man allowed to attend the ceremony at the grave—The object of
painting the body white is to attract the attention of the spirit.**

WITHIN a very short time of death the body in the Arunta tribe is
buried. It is placed in a sitting position with the knees doubled up
against the chin, and is thus interred in a round hole in the ground,
the earth being piled directly on to the body so as to make a low mound
with a depression on one side. This is always made on the side which
faces towards the direction of the dead man or woman's camping ground in
the Alcheringa, that is the spot which he or she inhabited whilst in
spirit form: the object of this is to allow of easy ingress and egress
to the *Ulthana* or spirit which is supposed to spend part of the time
until the final ceremony of mourning has been enacted in the grave, part
watching over near relatives, and part in the company of its
*Arumburinga*, that is its spiritual double who lives at the *Nanja*
spot.

In the case of a man the hair is cut off from his head and his
necklaces, armlets and fur string used for winding round his head are
carefully preserved for further use. In the Eastern Arunta it is said
that sometimes a little wooden vessel used <span id="page_498">p.
498</span> in camp for holding small objects may be buried with the man,
but this is the only instance which has come to our knowledge in which
anything ordinarily used is buried in the grave. Amongst the
Udnirringita (witchetty grub) people one or more of the round stone
Churinga which are supposed to represent the eggs of the grub in the
Alcheringa may be buried with the man, but this is the only instance in
which we can find that anything of a sacred nature is buried with him.

As soon as burial has taken place, the man or woman's camp in which
death occurred is at once burnt down, and all the contents are then
destroyed—in the case of a woman nothing whatever being preserved—and
the whole of the local encampment is shifted to a new place. Earth
burial directly after death occurs from the Urabunna tribe in the south
as far north as the Warramunga at Tennant's Creek. Amongst the latter
the body is at first placed on a platform made of boughs in a tree until
such time as the flesh has disappeared, when the bones, with the
exception of the smaller ones from the arms which are used for the
purpose of making pointing bones, are taken down and buried.

It is generally supposed that amongst Australian natives the name of a
dead man is never mentioned. This is not however strictly true as
regards the Arunta tribe. There are various degrees of silence to be
observed by different persons and these are dependent upon the mutual
relationship which existed between the dead and living individual.
During the period of mourning which follows immediately upon the death
of a man and occupies a period of from twelve to eighteen months, no
person must mention the name of the deceased except it be absolutely
necessary to do so, and then only in a whisper for fear of disturbing
and annoying the man's spirit which in ghost form, or as they call it,
*Ulthana*, walks about. If the *Ulthana* hears his name mentioned he
comes to the conclusion that his relatives are not properly mourning for
him—if their grief were genuine it would cause them too much pain to
hear his name mentioned to allow them to do so—and so he will come and
trouble them in their sleep, to show them that he is not pleased with
them.

All individuals who are *Okilia Oknia, Mia, Ungaraitcha*, <span
id="page_499">p. 499</span> *Uwinna*, or *Mura* of the dead man or woman
may never mention his or her name, nor may they ever go near to the
grave when once the ceremony of *Urpmilchima*, shortly to be described,
has been performed. Those who were *Allira, Itia, Umbirna, Umba,
Unkulla, Unawa, Ikuntera, Chimmia*, or *Arunga* may, when the time of
mourning is over, speak of the dead and mention his name without fear of
incurring the anger of the *Ulthana*. As a matter of fact the grave is
very seldom indeed visited by any one for a long time after the burial;
no camp will be formed close to where a grave has been made for at least
two years' time for fear of disturbing the *Ulthana*.

The *Gammona* of the deceased, that is the men who may lawfully marry
his daughters—whether they actually <span id="page_500">p. 500</span> do
so or not makes no difference—must not only never mention his name, but
they neither attend the actual burial, nor do they take any part in the
subsequent mourning ceremonies which are carried on at the grave. It is
their duty to cut themselves on the shoulder when the man who is their
*Ikuntera* or father-in-law dies. If a son-in-law does not well and
faithfully perform this cutting rite, which is called *Unangara*, then
some *Ikuntera* will punish him by giving away his special *Unawa* or
wife to some other man to appease the *Ulthana* of the dead
father-in-law.

The name of the latter is strictly tabu to the *Gammona*, and if by any
chance he should hear the name mentioned in camp, he will at once rattle
his boomerangs together so as to prevent his knowing what is being said.

Every man bears on his shoulders, as will be seen clearly in many of the
illustrations, the raised cicatrices, which exist as the permanent
record of the fact that he has fulfilled his duty to a dead
father-in-law.

When a man dies his special *Unawa* or *Unawas* smear their hair, faces
and breasts with white pipeclay and remain silent for a certain time
until a ceremony called *Aralkililima* has been performed. <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_164.md) The widow is called *Inpirta*, which
means the whitened one in reference to the pipeclay. Some times she
smears over the pipeclay ashes from a fire, in which case she is called
*Ura-inpirta, ura* meaning fire. In some of the more northern tribes, as
for example amongst the Warramunga living on Tennant's Creek, the widows
are not allowed to speak for sometimes as long a period as twelve
months, during the whole of which time they communicate only by means of
gesture language. In the latter they are so proficient that they prefer,
even when there is no obligation upon them to do so, to use it in
preference to speaking. Not seldom, when a party of women are in camp,
there will be almost perfect silence and yet a brisk conversation is all
the while being conducted on their fingers or rather with their hands
and arms, as many of the signs are made by putting

<span id="page_501">p. 501</span>

the hands, or perhaps the elbows, in varying positions. Many of the
positions assumed by the fingers are such that it is not at all easy for
a white man to imitate them, and yet by long practice the native can
place his fingers in the most wonderful variety of positions with regard
to one another and at the same time move them about in a way which no
white man can, except with extreme difficulty and very slowly.

When among the Arunta the widow wishes the ban of silence to be removed,
she gathers a large wooden vessel, called a *Tirna*, full of some edible
seed or small tuber and smears herself afresh with white pipeclay at the
*Erlukwirra*, or women's camp, where she has been living since her
husband's death. Carrying the *Tirna*, and accompanied by the women whom
she has gathered together for the purpose, she walks to the centre of
the encampment midway between the two sections of the community, that is
to the creek or whatever natural feature it may be which serves to
divide the Bulthara and Panunga moiety from the Kumara and Purula. Here
they all sit down and cry loudly, whereupon the men who were the
*Allira* and *Itia*, that is the sons and younger brothers of the dead
man (blood and tribal), come up and join the party. The men take the
*Tirna* from the hands of the widow and, as many as possible taking hold
of it, they shout loudly “*Wah! wah! wah!*” The women except the widow
stop crying and join in the shout. After a short time the *Tirna* <span
id="page_502">p. 502</span> is held close to, but not touching, the face
of the widow and passes are made to right and left of her cheeks, while
all again shout “*Wah! wah! wah!*” The widow now stops her crying and
utters the same shout, only in subdued tones. After a few minutes the
*Tirna* is passed to the rear of the men who now, squatting on the
ground and holding their shields in both hands, strike them heavily on
the ground in front of the women who are standing. The widow springs to
her feet and joins in the shouts of “*Wah! wah! wah!*” which accompany
for some minutes the striking of the shields. When this is over the men
disperse to their camps and eat the food brought in the *Tirna* by the
widow, who is now free to speak to them, though she still continues to
smear herself with pipeclay. The meaning of this ceremony, as symbolised
by the gathering of the tubers or grass seed, is that the widow is about
to resume the ordinary occupations of a woman's life, which have been to
a large extent suspended while she remained in camp in what we may call
deep mourning. It is in fact closely akin in feeling to the transition
from deep to narrow black-edged paper amongst certain more highly
civilised peoples. The offering to the sons and younger brothers is
intended both to show them that she has properly carried out the first
period of mourning and to gain their goodwill as they, especially the
younger brothers, are supposed to be for some time displeased with a
woman when her husband is dead and she is alive. In fact a younger
brother meeting the wife of a dead elder brother out in the bush,
performing the ordinary duties of a woman such as hunting for “yams”
within a short time of her husband's death, would be quite justified in
spearing her. The only reason that the natives give for this hostile
feeling is that it grieves them too much when they see the widow because
it reminds them of the dead man. This however can scarcely be the whole
reason, as the same rule does not apply to the elder brothers, and very
probably the real explanation of the feeling is associated, in some way,
with the custom according to which the widow will, when the final stage
of mourning is over, become the wife of one of these younger brothers
whom at first she has to carefully avoid.

<span id="page_503">p. 503</span>

After the lapse of perhaps twelve or eighteen months the ceremony of
*Urpmilchima* is performed at the grave. The meaning of this term is
“trampling the twigs on the grave.”

Previously to this the widow has been saving up small bones of any
animal such as the jaws of opossums or rabbit-kangaroos, or leg and arm
bones of various small animals. She also procures the same from her
tribal sisters. From the female *Itia, Allira* and *Umba* of the dead
man she obtains short locks of hair to which by means of *Atcha*, the
resin obtained from the porcupine grass, she attaches firmly the bones,
which are then hung on, in little groups, to one of the hair head rings
which are commonly worn by women. In addition she procures *Alpita* and
makes plumes out of the tail feathers of the ring-necked parrot or of
the black cockatoo. In this way a hideous and bulky chaplet is made
which the women call *Aramurilia* and the men *Chimurilia*—why they
should have separate names we cannot say, but they are both applied to
the same chaplet and have nothing to do with whether it is concerned
with the *Urpmilchima* of a man or woman.

When these preparations have been made the widow is invited by a younger
brother of the dead man to visit the grave or *Ulkna* and there to take
part in the ceremony of *Urpmilchima*. The date is determined by the
tribal brothers and sons of the dead man and on the appointed day the
widow is painted all, or nearly all over, with fresh pipeclay.

Probably in different parts of the tribe the ceremony varies to a
certain extent in details, and it may also vary somewhat according to
whether the dead man was held in great or little esteem. The following
is an account of the *Urpmilchima* as it was celebrated in the case of
the brother of the present Alatunja of the Alice Springs group. The
women, on the appointed day, were assembled at the *Erlukwirra* painting
the widow; the men were sitting a few hundred yards away on the line of
route from the camp to the grave. The *Oknia, Okilia, Itia*, and
*Allira*, were decorated on the front of the body with a Y-shaped
figure, painted of course in pipeclay, white being the colour of
mourning. The *Gammona* sat apart with bent heads and nearest to them
<span id="page_504">p. 504</span> were their *Allira*, that is their
sons blood and tribal. When the painting of the widow was complete, the
women approached from the *Erlukwirra* uttering their peculiar mournful
wail, a weird sound well-known to all who have spent the night camped
near to a group of natives amongst whom a death has occurred at all
recently. The lead was taken by the widow who was carrying the
*Chimurilia* in a wooden *pitchi*. They came on until the spot was
reached at which the *Gammona* were seated and approached in such a way
as to come up behind the latter. Then, standing behind each man, the
widow thrust the *pitchi* under the arms and on to the lap of each one
in turn. There it was allowed to remain, held by the man for some
minutes, the women crying loudly and the men with bent heads shedding
tears but uttering no sound. As the *pitchi* rested on the lap of each
man, the widow and other men who were *Unawa* with the dead man and who
were in consequence *Mura* to the *Gammona*, embraced the latter from
behind. These women were, it must be remembered, those who are strictly
prohibited from speaking to or having any intercourse with the men in
question, to whom they were tribally mothers-in-law, which will account
for the fact that they approached them from behind as if in recognition
of this mutual relationship of *Mura*. After this was over the sons of
the *Gammona* were treated in just the same way, and then these two sets
of men remained seated on the ground while all the other men, followed
by the women, started off for the grave. About midway the party was met
by the eldest son of the deceased's eldest brother and a halt was made.
Taking the *Chimurilia*—two in number—from the *pitchi* he approached
each man who was *Oknia, Okilia, Itia, Ikuntera, Umbirna*, and *Allira*
of the dead man and embraced them all in turn, pressing as he did so the
*Chimurilia* against their stomachs. Then he placed one *Chimurilia* on
the head of the widow, and the other on that of a younger sister of the
dead man, and taking from the *pitchi* some *Okincha-lanina* or fur
string rings, he tore the string tags off and placed the rings on the
heads of women who were *Allira* or *Umba* of the dead man. The tufts of
feathers of the ring-necked parrot were <span id="page_505">p.
505</span> stuck in the hair behind the ears over which hung *Alpita* or
tail tips.

When the putting on of the *Chimurilia*, &c., was complete, the party,
led by the man who had superintended this part of the proceedings, went
on, each man carrying a shield and spear-thrower. No words were spoken,
and the only sound was the wailing of the women. A visit was first paid
to the camp where the man died, and, dancing round the charred remains
(when a native dies his camp is at once destroyed by fire) they all
shouted “*Wah! wah! wah! wa-a-ah!*” the men <span id="page_506">p.
506</span> as they did so beating the air with their spear-throwers,
which were grasped in the centre instead of at one end, and held with
their hollow side outwards—suggestive somewhat of the reversed arms at a
military funeral. The shields were held at rest in the left hand. The
women joined in the dancing and shouting, beating the air with the palms
of their hands, which faced away from the body with the fingers widely
distended, the idea being to drive the spirit away from the old camp
which it is supposed to haunt. Those women who were *Mia, Uwinna*, and
*Mura* of the dead man did not join in the shouting, or make any
movement with the arms, but wailed loudly and threw themselves on to the
ground. When the dancing, which lasted about ten minutes, was over, the
whole party proceeded to the grave at a run, the leader making a circuit
away from the main party, shouting loudly with very prolonged intonation
“*Ba-au! ba-au!*” The idea of the leading man making a circuit was,
perhaps, though the natives could give no explanation, to prevent the
spirit from doubling back to the camp from which they were supposed to
be driving him. The idea is that the spirit is frightened when he hears
the noise and sees the widow coming on wearing the *Chimurilia*, and
being driven on takes refuge at the bottom of the grave. The main party
went on shouting in suppressed tones “*Wah! wah!*” the men keeping time
by beating the air with their spear-throwers, held as previously
described, while the women followed behind.

The leader, who had been running more rapidly than the rest, arrived at
the grave just before the others, and with a final and much prolonged
“*Ba-au!*” jumped on to the grave into which the spirit was supposed to
have fled and began dancing wildly. He was quickly followed by the
others, all of whom, except the *Mia, Uwinna*, and *Mura* women, who lay
down on the ground close by, began to dance backwards and forwards on
and around the grave shouting “*Wah! wah!*” and beating the air
downwards as if to drive the spirit down, while with their feet they
stamped upon and broke the twigs with which a newly made grave is always
covered. When these were thoroughly broken up the dancing ceased, the
men separated from the women and went to one side, <span
id="page_507">p. 507</span> while the widow and other women cleared up
the *débris* which was carried a little distance away from the grave,
immediately around which a space was cleared for a few yards. When this
had been done the *Mia, Uwinna*, and *Mura* women, who had meanwhile
been lying prostrate, wailing at the top of their voices, and now and
again striking the ground with their bodies, got up and approached the
grave. Gathered around this, they struck and cut their heads with
fighting clubs, inflicting on themselves often severe wounds from which
the blood flowed on to the grave. After a little time the cutting ceased
and they moved away. The men stood solemnly on one side while the widow
came forward with her sisters, blood and tribal, and scratched a hole in
the top of the grave When this was deep enough the widow and the younger
woman took the *Chimurilia* off their heads and, while all the women
cried loudly, tore them to pieces, and, kneeling over the grave,
deposited the remains in the hole. This done the fur string rings were
treated in the same way, the feather tufts and *Alpita* were placed in
the hole, above these was put the *pitchi*, in which the *Chimurilia*
had been carried, and then the earth was heaped up. When this had been
done the men prostrated themselves for a few minutes on the grave. When
they got up their place was taken by the widow and other *Unawa* women,
and lastly the *Mia, Uwinna*, and *Mura* women came and lay down.

After this was over, the widow, standing by the grave, rubbed off the
white pipeclay from her body, thus showing that her mourning was at an
end. She may still, if she likes, paint a narrow white band on her
forehead, which is regarded as an intimation that she is not anxious to
marry at present, as she still mourns, though to a less degree than
before, for the dead man.

The spirit of the dead man was supposed to have been watching all these
proceedings as he lay at the bottom of the grave. From the fact of the
widow's having painted herself with white, and having made and worn the
*Chimurilia*, he knows that he has been properly mourned for, while the
fact of her wearing in her hair the gay feathers of the ring-neck <span
id="page_508">p. 508</span> parrot shows him that her period of mourning
has come to an end. Having had similar experiences during his own
life-time he recognises that, with the *Chimurilia*, she buries the
sorrow of herself and of his relatives and friends. The loud shouting of
the men and women shows him that they do not wish to be frightened by
him in his present state, and that they will be angry with him if he
does not rest. Should he at any time forget the wishes of the survivors,
then the presence of the broken up *Chimurilias* will remind him of
them. He may still watch over his friends, guard them from harm, and
visit them in dreams, but he must not come in such a way as to frighten
them.

In the case of every grave, it may here be noted that the earth is
always especially heaped up on one side; the side on which it is less
heaped up, or on which sometimes a slight depression is left, is always
the one facing towards the place at which, in the Alcheringa, the
ancestor of the man lived and at which place the spirit double of the
man has lived ever since with whom the *Ulthana* will now, for the most
part, live.

In the case of the *Urpmilchima* of a woman the proceedings are somewhat
different, and the following describes what took place at one which was
held some twelve months after the death of a woman at Alice Springs.

All the women in the camp assembled at the *Erlukwirra* shortly after
sunrise. The actual mother of the deceased was painted deeply all over
with pipeclay, the tribal *Mias* were painted with the same material,
but to a lesser extent, the *Ungaraitcha* had bands of white across the
foreheads and chests, the *Uwinnas* were painted with dry yellow ochre
on the body and head, and had also white bands across the forehead.
After about ten minutes had been spent in embracing one another, while a
continuous wailing was kept up, a start was made for the grave. After
going a short distance they were met by a man who was a blood brother of
the dead woman, and was accompanied by a number of his tribal brothers.
Every one sat down and the lamenting again began. The *Ungaraitcha*, who
carried the *pitchi* containing <span id="page_509">p. 509</span> the
*Chimurilias*, handed it to the brother, who bowed his head over it
while he pressed it against his stomach for a minute or two, after which
he removed one of the *Chimurilias* and placed it upon his mother's
head. After it had been worn by the woman for a short time she replaced
it in the *pitchi*, which was then taken by the *Ungaraitcha* and
pressed against the stomach of each man in turn, the idea being to
assuage their sorrow. The *Chimurilias* were then taken by the brother
and placed on the heads of two tribal *Ungaraitcha* of the dead woman,
and the party started for the grave, led, but only for a short distance,
by the brother, all the other men remaining behind. No man is allowed to
attend the *Urpmilchima* of a woman.

On the way to the grave the actual mother often threw herself heavily on
the ground and attempted to cut her head with a digging stick. Each time
she did so she was picked up by two women, whose duty it appeared to be
to prevent her from hurting herself too much; but by the time that the
grave was reached her body was a mass of bruises and covered over with
sharp, three-cornered prickles. At the grave she threw herself upon it,
tearing up the earth with her hands and being literally danced upon by
the other women. Then all the *Mias* and *Uwinnas* threw themselves on
the grave, the *Mias* cutting and hitting each other about the body
until they were streaming with blood. Each of them carried a digging
stick, which was used unsparingly on its owner's head and on those of
the others, no one attempting to ward off the blows which they even
invited. Amongst the *Mias* was an aged cripple, who was carried to the
ground, and was one of the most keen participators in the ceremony. The
*Uwinnas* though hard hit were not cut as were the *Mias*. After some
time the other women dragged the *Mias* and *Uwinnas* away and then the
*Ungaraitcha* scraped a hole in the earth in which, after tearing them
up, the *Chimurilias* were deposited. Once more the *Mias* threw
themselves on the grave cutting each other's heads. The weeping and
wailing of the women who were standing round seemed to drive them almost
frenzied, and the blood, streaming down their bodies over the white
<span id="page_510">p. 510</span> pipe-clay, gave them a ghastly
appearance. At last only the old mother was left crouching alone,
utterly exhausted and moaning weakly on the grave. The *Ungaraitcha*
approached her, and, rubbing off the pipe-clay, lifted her up. After
this the ceremony came to an end and the grave was smoothed down and
left.

No *Mia* would think of being absent from an *Urpmilchima* ceremony,
which, though the Australian native cannot be supposed to feel pain as
acutely as the average white man does, must yet involve no small amount
of physical suffering. The women seem to work themselves up into a
perfect frenzy, and to become quite careless as to the way in which they
cut and hack themselves about, with, however, this restriction, notable
on all such occasions, that however frenzied they apparently become no
vital part is injured, the cutting being confined to such parts as the
shoulders, scalp, and legs.

To those who have had no personal contact with savages, such as the
Australian natives, and have never seen them at times when they are
excited by the performance of ceremonies, the carrying out of which
forms a most important feature in their lives, the above account may
appear to be exaggerated. It is not for a moment to be supposed that the
self-inflicted pain and the loud lamentings are to be taken as a measure
of the grief actually felt. To a certain extent, perhaps to a very large
one, the excessive display is due to the fact that it is a tribal
custom, and as such has a very strong hold upon the imagination of a
people whose every action is bound and limited by custom. There is
nothing to which a blackfellow is so sensitive as to the contempt and
ridicule of his fellows, to which non-compliance with a custom such as
this will expose him. Partly, also, must be taken into account the fear
which a native has that, unless a sufficient amount of grief be
displayed, he will be harmed by the offended *Ulthana* or spirit of the
dead man. In many respects the mind of the Australian native is like
that of a child amongst ourselves. One moment he will be in a passion of
grief or rage, and the next, if anything attracts his fancy, his <span
id="page_511">p. 511</span> humour will rapidly change and tears will
give place to laughter. At the same time, he is certainly capable of
genuine grief and of real affection for his children.

It may finally be pointed out that, in connection with the custom of
painting the body of the mourner with white pipe-clay, there is no idea
of concealing from the spirit of the dead person the identity of the
mourner; on the other hand, the idea is to render him or her more
conspicuous, and so to allow the spirit to see that it is being properly
mourned for.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[500:1](ntca16.htm#fr_164.md) Amongst the
Warramunga tribe, the widow crops her hair short, and after cutting open
the middle line of the scalp, runs a fire-stick along the wound, often
with serious results.
