EVERY Australian native, so far as is known, has in the normal condition
of the tribe to pass through certain ceremonies of initiation before he
is admitted to the secrets of the tribe, and is regarded as a fully
developed member of it. These ceremonies vary both in their nature and
number to a very large extent in different tribes. Those of the eastern
and south-eastern coastal districts are entirely different from those of
the central tribes, amongst whom they are more elaborate and spread over
a long series of years, the first taking place at about the age of ten
or <span id="page_213">p. 213</span> twelve, whilst the final and most
impressive one is not passed through until probably the native has
reached the age of at least twenty-five, or it may be thirty. In the
Arunta and Ilpirra tribes the ceremonies are four in number:—

-   \(1\) Painting and throwing the boy up in the air.
-   \(2\) Circumcision or *Lartna*.
-   \(3\) Subincision or *Ariltha*.
-   \(4\) The *Engwura* or fire ceremony.

The times at which these take place and the details of the ceremonies
vary to a certain extent in various parts of the tribes, which, it must
be remembered, occupy an area of country stretching from Charlotte
Waters in the south to at least 100 miles north of Alice Springs, that
is over an area measuring 300 miles north and south by at least 100
miles east and west, and comprising in the south a wide extent of
upland, stony plains and sand hills, and in the north a succession of
ranges running east and west, and reaching an elevation of 5,000 feet.

One of the most noticeable features of the ceremonies, from a negative
point of view, is the absence of the knocking out of teeth as a general
custom associated with the initiatory rites. Amongst many tribes of the
eastern coastal district this forms a prominent feature, but amongst the
Central Australian natives, whilst it may be performed, it has nothing
to do with initiation, and is, in fact, practised by men as well as
women, the rite having no sacred significance of any kind; and yet, as
we shall see later, there is not only evidence which shows that it has
once been a ceremony of greater importance than it is at the present
day, but also that there are certain details which are curiously similar
to those concerned with the ceremony in parts where it forms the most
important initiation rite.

In the case of particular local groups amongst the Arunta, as, for
example, the natives now living in the district to the north and
north-east of Alice Springs, it is much more widely practised than
elsewhere; but, speaking generally, the knocking out of teeth is amongst
the Arunta and other central tribes <span id="page_214">p. 214</span> a
matter partly of individual and partly of local taste and fashion. <span
id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101.md) The custom is probably to be regarded as
one which was at some distant time prevalent amongst the common
ancestors of the central and eastern coastal tribes, but which has
undergone changes as the tribes became separated from one another and
developed, so far as their customs are concerned, along different lines.
In some it has retained its old significance, or may have even acquired
still greater importance as an initiatory rite, but in others, as, for
example, all those inhabiting the central area, it has lost its old
meaning, its place has been taken by other rites, and now it is merely
what we may call a rudimentary custom.

To a certain extent, as we have said, the details of the various
initiation ceremonies differ in different parts of the tribe. We will
first of all describe them as carried out in the groups living on the
Finke River, and will then point out variations in the ceremonies as
they are enacted, first in the northern, and secondly in the southern
parts.

THE FIRST CEREMONY—THROWING THE BOY UP IN THE AIR

 

The first ceremony takes place when a boy is between ten and twelve
years of age. The men, and in this instance the women also, assemble at
a central spot near to the main camp, and the boys who have reached the
right age—the number varying from ceremony to ceremony—are taken one by
one and tossed in the air several times by the men, who catch them as
they fall, while the women dance round and round the group, swinging
their arms and shouting loudly, “*pau, pau, pau-a-a*,” the last cry
being very prolonged. <span id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_102.md) This over
the boys are painted on their chests and backs, as shown in the
illustration, with simple designs consisting of straight or curved bands
outlined by lines of red or yellow ochre. These

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

have not of necessity any reference to the totem of the boys. They are
painted by men who stand to the boys in the relation of *Umbirna*, that
is, brother of a woman whom the boy may marry. In some cases, at all
events, they are copied from old rock paintings, certain of which are
associated with particular totems, but the boy will not of necessity be
decorated with a design of his own totem. Certain of these particular
designs are described in connection with the sacred drawings. If the boy
has what is called an *Unjipinna* <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103.md)
man, then it is the latter who will draw the design upon him at the
close of the ceremony of throwing up.

In all the ceremonies of initiation the youth or man has certain designs
painted on his body, and in no case have they of necessity any reference
to his own totem, though they are emblematic of some totem with which
usually the man who does the painting is associated. These designs come
under the general term of *Ilkinia*, the name applied to the designs, as
a whole, which are emblematic of the totems; and so long as the boy,
youth or man has one or other of these painted on him, it does not
signify which. It must be remembered that the man who does the painting
is usually the person who decides upon the nature of the design, and it
may also be noted that in the performance of sacred ceremonies men are
constantly decorated with designs of totems other than their own.

In the case of this, the first of the initiatory ceremonies, the
painting of each boy is done as stated by men who stand to him in the
relationship of *Umbirna*, that is, a man who is the brother of a woman
of the class from which his, *i.e.* the boy's, wife must come. The
design is called *Enchichichika*, and while they are being painted the
boys are told that the ceremony through which they have just passed will
promote their growth to manhood, and they are also told by tribal
fathers and elder brothers that in future they must not play with the
women and girls, nor must they camp with them as

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

they have hitherto done, but henceforth they must go to the camp of the
men, which is known as the *Ungunja*. Up to this time they have been
accustomed to go out with the women as they searched for vegetable food
and the smaller animals such as lizards and rats; now they begin to
accompany the men in their search for larger game, and begin also to
look <span id="page_217">p. 217</span> forward to the time when they
will become fully initiated and admitted to all the secrets of the
tribe, which are as yet kept hidden from them.

The ceremony of throwing up is called *Alkirakiwuma* (from *alkira* the
sky, and *iwuma* to throw), and very shortly after this sometimes even
before it, the boy has his nasal septum bored <span id="page_218">p.
218</span> through, usually by his father or paternal grandfather, and
begins to wear the nose bone. This boring is practised by men and women
alike, and the operation is attended by a short but interesting special
ceremony, which is elsewhere described. Amongst the women the nose
boring is usually done by the husband immediately after marriage, and it
may be remarked in passing that in both sexes the constant wearing of
the nose bone emphasises the flattening out of the lobes of the nose.

A good many years may elapse between the throwing up ceremony and the
performance of the two much more important ceremonies of circumcision or
*Lartna*, and that of subincision or *Ariltha*. Speaking generally, it
may be said that circumcision may take place at any age after the boy
has arrived at puberty.

Before the time at which the boy is thrown up in the air he is spoken of
as an *Ambaquerka*, which is the term applied to a child generally, of
whichever sex it may be. After the throwing up, and until the ceremony
of circumcision, he is called *Ulpmerka*.

THE SECOND CEREMONY—CIRCUMCISION OR LARTNA

 

When it has been decided by the boy's elder male relatives (usually his
elder brothers) that he has arrived at the proper age, preparations are
made unknown to him, for the carrying out of the ceremony. These consist
first of all in the gathering together of a large supply of food
material for the ceremonies are attended with the performance of what
are usually spoken of as corrobborees, which last over several days. If
a stranger belonging to any other group happens to be present in camp
when the operation is being performed he will take part in the
proceedings, but in the Arunta tribe there is usually no sending out of
messengers to other groups to bring them in to the performance, as there
is in the coastal tribes; nor is it usual to operate upon more than one,
or at most two, novices at the same time; each boy is initiated when he
is supposed to have reached the proper age, and the ceremony is
controlled by the men of his own local group, <span id="page_219">p.
219</span> who may ask any one to take part or not in it just as they
feel disposed.

In the following account we will describe what took place during an
actual ceremony, which was conducted recently by a group of natives
associated with a spot called Undiara, <span
id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104.md) one of the most important centres of the
kangaroo totem situated near to the Finke River. It must always be
remembered that the details of these initiation ceremonies vary to a
certain extent according to the locality in which they are performed;
thus at Undiara the men of the kangaroo totem directed the proceedings,
and therefore sacred ceremonies concerned with this particular totem
were much in evidence; had Undiara been an emu locality then emu
ceremonies would have predominated. Bearing this in mind, the ceremony
now to be described may be regarded as typical of the rite of
circumcision as carried out by the natives living along the Finke River,
who are often spoken of as Larapinta blacks to distinguish them from
other groups, Larapinta being the native name of the river.

The boy was seized early in the evening at the *Ungunja*, or men's camp,
by three young men, who were respectively *Okilia*, *Umbirna* and
*Unkulla* to him. As soon as they laid hands on him they shouted loudly,
“*Utchai*, *utchai*,” while being frightened, he struggled, trying to
get free from them. He was at once carried off bodily to the ceremonial
ground which had been carefully prepared at some distance from and out
of sight of the main camp, so that the women, when at the latter, could
not see anything of what was taking place at

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

the former, which is called the *Apulla*. The nature of this can be seen
from the accompanying plan. A path about five feet wide is cleared of
grass and shrubs, and the surface soil is heaped up on either side, so
as to form a low, narrow bank of the same length as the path, which is
some forty or fifty feet in length, and always made so as to run east
and west. At a distance of about forty feet from the eastern end was a
brake of boughs at which the men were assembled. The women were grouped
at the spot marked C.

Once on the ground, and in the presence of all the men and women, the
boy made no further resistance, but apparently resigned himself to his
fate. He was taken to the men and sat down amongst them, while the
women, who had been awaiting his arrival, at once began to dance,
carrying shields in their hands. The reason assigned for this is that in
the Alcheringa certain women called *Unthippa* <span
id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105.md) carried along with them as they
travelled over the country a number of young boys who were just being
initiated. As they travelled along, dancing the whole way, they also
carried shields: and therefore it is that, at the present day, the
initiation ceremony must commence with an imitation of the *Unthippa*
dance of the Alcheringa. <span id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_106.md) Except in
connection with this ceremony women may never carry shields, which are
exclusively the property of the men, just as much as a digging-stick is
the peculiar property of a woman. While the women were dancing the men
sang of the marching of the *Unthippa* women across the country. After
the boy had watched and listened for some time, an *Unkulla* <span
id="fr_107"></span>[3](#fn_107.md) man came up and twined round and round
his hair strands of fur string, until it looked as if his head were
enclosed in a tight-fitting skull cap. Then a man who was *Gammona* to
him came up and fastened round his waist a large *Uliara*, that is, the
human hair girdle worn by the men, the girdle being provided by an
*Oknia* of the boy. The two first-named men were respectively the
brother of the boy's mother and the

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

son of this man, the *Oknia* being a tribal brother of the boy's father
who was dead, as also was the actual mother. After this a council of the
*Oknia* and *Okilia* <span id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108.md) of the novice
was held, and three men, who were respectively *Mura*, *Gammona* and
*Chimmia*, were told off to take the boy away and paint him. These men
are afterwards called *Wulya*, or *Uwilia*, by the boy. They first of
all went away and built a second brake of bushes at the western end of
the *Apulla*, at a distance of about forty feet from the end of the
cleared path, so that in position the second brake corresponded to the
first one at the opposite end. This was henceforth to be the brake
behind which the boy had to remain except when brought on to the ground
to witness performances. When this had been made the three men returned
and led the boy through the dancing women to his brake, where, with
great deliberation, they rubbed him all over with grease, and then
decorated his body with pinkish-white clay and bird's down.

During all the proceedings every detail, such as the appointing of the
various officials, was determined upon by a council of men consisting of
the *Oknia* (tribal fathers) and *Okilia* (blood and tribal elder
brothers) of the novice, and of this council the elder *Oknia* was head
man.

After painting him, the *Uwilia* told the boy that he was now no longer
an *Ulpmerka* but a *Wurtja*, that during the proceedings about to
follow he must render implicit obedience, and on no account must he ever
tell any woman or boy anything of what he was about to see. Should he
ever reveal any of the secrets, then he and his nearest relations would
surely die. He must not speak unless spoken to, and even then his words
must be as few as possible, and spoken in a low tone. He was further
told to remain crouched down behind his brake when left there, and that
on no account must he make the slightest attempt to see what the men at
their brake were doing. Should he try to see what was going on at the
*Apulla*, except when taken there and told to watch, some

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

great calamity would happen to him—*Twanyikira*, the great spirit whose
voice was heard when the bull-roarers spoke, would carry him away. When
these instructions had been given to him by the *Uwilia* they went away,
and he was then visited by his *Okilia*, who repeated precisely the same
instructions, and after this the *Wurtja* was left for an hour or two to
his own reflections. Meanwhile a man had been appointed to act as
*Urinthantima*, whose duty will be seen shortly, and until daylight
dawned the dancing and singing went on with astonishing vigour. Then one
of the *Okilia* went and brought back the *Wurtja*, passing with him as
before through the middle of the dancing women, who opened out to allow
them to pass through, and placed him sitting on the lap of the
*Urinthantima* man.

The oldest *Mia* woman of the boy (his actual *Mia* or mother being
dead) had brought with her from her own camp a fire-stick, which she had
been careful to keep alight all night. At daylight she lit a fire by
means of this, and then took two long sticks with which she had provided
herself, and, lighting them at the fire, went and sat down, holding them
in her hands, immediately behind the *Urinthantima* man. The *Uwinna*,
that is the sisters of the boy's father, went and also sat down along
with her. Then, as the men began to sing a special fire song, she handed
one of the fire-sticks to the woman who was the *Mura tualcha* of the
boy, that is the woman whose eldest daughter, born or unborn, has been
assigned to the *Wurtja* as his future wife, so that she is potentially
his mother-in-law. While the singing went on this woman approached the
boy, and, after tying round his neck bands of fur string, she handed to
him the fire-stick, <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md) telling him as
she did so to always hold fast to his own fire—in other words not to
interfere with women assigned to other men. After this, at a signal from
an old *Okilia*, the *Wurtja* got up and ran away, followed by a number
of shouting boys, who after a short time returned, and, along with the
women, left the *Apulla* ground and ran back to the main camp. The old
*Mia* took her fire-stick with her, and in camp

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

guarded it with great care, fixing it at an angle into the ground so as
to catch the wind and ensure its being kept alight. The *Wurtja* had,
whilst in his camp, to guard his fire-stick in just the same way, and
was cautioned that if he lost it, or allowed it to go out, both he and
his *Mia* would be killed by *Kurdaitcha*. On the day on which he was
taken back to the camp, they both threw away their fire-sticks.

When the *Wurtja* left the *Apulla*, he was accompanied by some *Okilia*
and *Unkulla* men who remained out in the bush with him for three days.
During this time nothing of any special nature happened to him beyond
the fact that he might not speak unless he was first spoken to, which
seldom took place, and that he might not eat freely, though as yet he
was not bound by the restrictions with regard to food which he would
shortly have to obey. The main object of this partial seclusion is to
impress him with the fact that he is about to enter the ranks of the
men, and to mark the break between his old life and the new one; he has
no precise knowledge of what is in store for him, and the sense that
something out of the ordinary is about to happen to him—something
moreover which is of a more or less mysterious nature—helps to impress
him strongly with a feeling of the deep importance of compliance with
tribal rules, and further still with a strong sense of the superiority
of the older men who know, and are familiar with, all the mysterious
rites, some of which he is about to learn the meaning of for the first
time.

On the fourth day the *Wurtja* was brought back, and at once placed
behind his brake, which is called *Atnumbanta*, and from which he might
not move without the permission of one of the *Okilia* who had been told
off to guard him, and whose father was the *Oknia* who acted as the head
man of the council. On the night of the fourth day the men sang of the
marchings of the men of the Ullakuppera (little hawk) totem in the
Alcheringa, and of their operations with their famous *Lialira* or stone
knives. It was these men who, according to tradition, first introduced
the use of a stone knife at circumcision, the operation having been
previously <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> conducted by means of a
fire-stick. <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md) At times they broke
into the *Lartna* song:

“Irri yulta yulta rai  
Ul katchera ul katchar-rai,”

which is always sung in loud fierce tones. About midnight two *Okilia*
went to the *Wurtja's* brake, and having put a bandage round his eyes
led him to the men who sat as usual on the side of their brake facing
towards the *Apulla*. Here he was placed lying face downwards, until two
men who were going to perform a ceremony were in position between the
*Apulla* lines. The Quabara, which they were about to perform, was one
of a certain number which are only performed at a time such as this,
though in all important respects these Quabara are identical with those
performed during various

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

ceremonies concerned with the totems. When the boy was told by his
*Okilia* and *Oknia* to sit up and look he saw, lying in front of him,
and on his side, a decorated man whom the *Okilia* and *Oknia*, both of
them speaking at once, told him represented a wild dog. At the other end
of the *Apulla* a decorated man stood, with legs wide apart, holding up
twigs of Eucalyptus in each hand, and having his head ornamented with a
small *Waninga*, <span id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111.md) which is a sacred
object emblematic of some totemic animal, in this particular case a
kangaroo. This man moved his head from side to side, as if looking for
something, and every now and then uttered a sound similar to that made
by a kangaroo, which animal he was supposed to represent. Suddenly the
dog looked up, saw the kangaroo, began barking, and, running along on
all fours, passed between the man's legs and lay down behind the man,
who kept watching him over his shoulder. Then the dog ran again between
the kangaroo-man's legs, but this time he was caught and well

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

shaken, and a pretence was made of dashing his head against the ground,
whereupon he howled as if in pain. These movements were repeated several
times, and finally the dog was supposed to be killed by the kangaroo.
After a short pause the dog ran along on all fours to where the *Wurtja*
sat and laid himself on top of the boy, then the old kangaroo hopped
along and got on top of both of them, so that the *Wurtja* had to bear
the weight of the two men for about two minutes. When the performers got
up, the *Wurtja*, still lying down, was told by the old men that the
Quabara represented an incident which took place in the Alcheringa, when
a wild dogman attacked a kangaroo-man, and was killed by the latter. The
article which the kangaroo wore on its head was a *Waninga*, which was a
sacred object, and must never be mentioned in the hearing of women and
children; it belonged to the kangaroo totem, and was indeed the
representative of a kangaroo. When all had been explained to him, he was
led back to his brake, and the men continued singing at intervals all
night long.

The Quabara, which are performed at these initiation ceremonies, vary
according to the locality in which they are being performed, and the men
who are taking the leading part in them. If, for example, the old man
who is presiding belongs to the emu totem, then the Quabara will at all
events to a certain, and probably a large extent, deal with incidents
concerned with ancestral emu men. In the particular ceremony upon which
this account is based, the old man presiding belonged to the kangaroo
totem, and therefore Quabara belonging especially to this totem were
much in evidence. The totem of the novice has no influence whatever on
the nature of the particular Quabara performed. Each old man who
presides over, or takes the leading part in, a ceremony such as this has
possession of a certain number of Quabara, and naturally those performed
are chosen from this series as they are the ones which he has the right
to perform. It is necessary also to remember that ceremonial objects,
such as the *Waninga*, which figure largely in some districts, are
unknown in others where their place is taken by entirely different
objects. Thus, for example, in the northern <span id="page_227">p.
227</span> part of the Arunta and in the Ilpirra tribe, a sacred pole
called a *Nurtunja* is used, and in these parts this has precisely the
significance of the *Waninga*, which is never met with in the northern
districts, just as the *Nurtunja* is never met with in the south.

On the fifth day, in the afternoon, another performance in which two
kangaroos and one dog figured was given. The kangaroos wore, as before,
small *Waninga* in their hair, and this time carried between their
teeth, and also in their hair, bunches of wooden shavings soaked in
blood, which were supposed to represent wounds received from the bites
of the dogs. The performance was essentially similar to that of the
previous day, and the antics of the dog as he ran round and looked up,
barking at the kangaroo or howled lustily as his head was bumped against
the ground brought smiles to every face except that of the *Wurtja*.
Finally the dog ran along and got on top of the *Wurtja*, and then the
two kangaroos followed, so that this time the boy had three men on top
of him. When all was over he was once more instructed, cautioned, and
taken back to his brake.

On the sixth day the *Wurtja* was taken out hunting by *Okilia* and
*Umbirna* men, and the night was spent in singing with little
intermission songs which referred to the wanderings of certain of the
Alcheringa ancestors, to which the *Wurtja*, sitting quietly at the
men's brake, listened.

It must be remembered that it is now for the first time that the
*Wurtja* hears anything of these traditions and sees the ceremonies
performed, in which the ancestors of the tribe are represented as they
were, and acting as they did during life. In various accounts of
initiation ceremonies of the Australian tribes, as, for example, in the
earliest one ever published—the one written by Collins in 1804—we meet
with descriptions of performances in which different animals are
represented, but except in the case of the Arunta tribe, no indication
of the meaning and signification of these performances has been
forthcoming beyond the fact that they are associated with the totems. In
the Arunta and Ilpirra tribes they are not only intimately associated
with the totemic system, but have a very definite meaning. Whether they
have a similar <span id="page_228">p. 228</span> significance in other
tribes we have as yet no definite evidence to show, but it is at all
events worthy of note that whilst the actual initiation rite varies from
tribe to tribe, consisting in some in the knocking out of teeth, and in
others in circumcision, &c., in all, or nearly all, an important part of
the ceremony consists in showing to the novices certain dances, the
important and common feature of which is that they represent the actions
of special totemic animals. In the Arunta tribe, however, they have a
very definite meaning. At the first glance it looks much as if all that
they were intended to represent were the behaviour of certain animals,
but in reality they have a much deeper meaning, for each performer
represents an ancestral individual who lived in the Alcheringa. He was a
member of a group of individuals, all of whom, just like himself, were
the direct descendants or transformations of the animals, the names of
which they bore. It is as a reincarnation of the never-dying spirit part
of one of these semi-animal ancestors that every member of the tribe is
born, and, therefore, when born he, or she, bears of necessity the name
of the animal or plant of which the Alcheringa ancestor was a
transformation or descendant.

The nature of these performances may be gathered from one which was
performed on the next—the seventh day. As usual in all these ceremonies,
the body of the performer was decorated with ochre, and lines of birds'
down, which were supposed to be arranged in just the same way as they
had been on the body of the Alcheringa man. From his waist was suspended
a ball of fur string, which was supposed to represent the scrotum of the
kangaroo, and when all was ready the performer came hopping leisurely
out from behind the men's brake, where he had been decorated, lying down
every now and then on his side to rest as a kangaroo does. The boy had,
as usual, been brought blindfolded on to the ground, and at first was
made to lie flat down. When the performer hopped out he was told to get
up and watch. For about ten minutes the performer went through the
characteristic movements of the animal, acting the part very cleverly,
while the men sitting round the *Wurtja* sang of the wanderings of <span
id="page_229">p. 229</span> the kangaroo in the Alcheringa. Then after a
final and very leisurely hop round the *Apulla* ground the man came and
lay down on top of the *Wurtja*, who was then instructed in the
tradition to which the performance refers. He was told that in the
Alcheringa a party of kangaroo men started from a place called Ultainta,
away out to the east of what is now called Charlotte Waters, and that
after wandering about they came to a spot called Karinga (in the Edith
Range about thirty miles south-west of Alice Springs), where one of the
party who was named Unburtcha died; that is, his body died, but the
spirit part of him was in a sacred Churinga, which he carried and did
not die, but remained behind along with the Churinga when the party
travelled on. This spirit, the old men told him, went, at a later time,
into a woman, and was born again as a Purula man, whose name was, of
course, Unburtcha, and who was a kangaroo man just as his ancestor was.
He was told that the old men know all about these matters, and decide
who has come to life again in the form of a man or woman. Sometimes the
spirit child which goes into a woman is associated with one of the
sacred Churinga, numbers of which every Alcheringa individual carried
about with him or her (for in those days the women were allowed to carry
them just as the men were), and then, in this case, the child has no
definite name, but of course it belongs to the same totem as did the
individual who had carried the Churinga about in the Alcheringa; that
is, if it were a kangaroo man or woman, so of course must the child be,
and then the old men determine what shall be its secret or sacred name.

It is in this way that the boy during the initiation ceremonies is
instructed, for the first time, in any of the sacred matters referring
to the totems, and it is by means of the performances which are
concerned with certain animals, or rather, apparently with the animals,
but in reality with Alcheringa individuals who were the direct
transformations of such animals, that the traditions dealing with this
subject, which is of the greatest importance in the eyes of the natives,
are firmly impressed upon the mind of the novice, to whom everything
which <span id="page_230">p. 230</span> he sees and hears is new and
surrounded with an air of mystery.

After the performance was over, the *Wurtja* was led back to his brake,
and then a council was held for the purpose of selecting a man to
perform the operation, and another man to act as assistant. Both these
men are called *Atwia atwia* and in addition to them, another man was
selected, whose duty it was to hold up the shield upon which the boy was
seated during the operation, this man being known by the name of
*Elucha*. The conversation was carried on in whispers, the men when
speaking, placing their mouths close to each other's ears. While this
consultation was in progress, the other men sitting close to the brake
sang in fierce loud tones, the *Lartna* song—“*Irriyulta yulta rai*,”
&c.

After discussing matters for some time, it was decided that an old man
who was *Mura* to the boy, was to perform the ceremony, and that a man
who was *Gammona* to the former, was to act as assistant, while another
old man who was *Ikuntera*, that is possible father-in-law, was to act
as shield-bearer or *Elucha*. It must be remembered that, in addition to
the honour attaching to these offices, there are certain emoluments,
for, when the operation is all over, the boy has to provide each of
these men with an offering of food. As soon as this decision had been
arrived at, the singing stopped, and the three *Okilia* went and sat in
a line at the end of the *Apulla* path, looking very grave, as if the
business now to be performed were of the deepest importance. Each one of
them then got up in turn, and bringing one of the appointed officials,
each of whom made a pretence of reluctance, placed him in front of the
line occupied by himself and his brother *Okilia*, so that now there
were two rows of men facing each other. The old *Mura* man sat in the
middle of his row, and facing him was the eldest of the *Okilia*. The
latter then smoothed with his hand the surface of the ground between the
two lines, and then, picking up a spear-thrower by the end to which the
point was attached, he thrust his beard into his mouth, as did also the
*Mura* man, and for a short time both glared fiercely <span
id="page_231">p. 231</span> at one another. Then without taking his eyes
off the *Mura* man, he scooped up with the chisel end of the weapon a
little soil, and, gliding along on his knees, emptied it into the hands
of the former. Then he embraced him, rubbed their bodies together, and
finally rubbed his forehead against the stomach of the *Mura* man. When
this was over, he repeated the whole performance with the two other
officials, and then the three old men were embraced in turn by the other
*Okilia*, who, however, did not present them with dirt.

The meaning of the ceremony is simply, so they say, to imply that the
youth is intrusted to them for the purpose of being initiated, with as
little hesitation as the dirt is placed in their hands.

This little ceremony is called *Okoara*, and was conducted with much
solemnity. When it was over, the men who had taken part in it joined the
others, and once more the *Lartna* song was sung with much fierceness.
Singing was kept up all night long with only short intervals of rest.
Early in the evening, the *Wurtja* was brought from his brake, and spent
the night amongst the men, listening to, but taking no part in, the
singing.

The morning of the eighth day was spent in preparing for a ceremony
concerned with the Illuta (a rat) totem. The particular rat-man or
man-rat—for, as already said, the identity of the human individual is
sunk in that of the object with which he is associated, and from which
he is supposed to have originated—to whom this ceremony referred, is
supposed to have travelled from a place called Pulkira, west of the
Finke River to Walyirra, where he died, and where his spirit remained
associated as usual with the Churinga. In connection with this ceremony
a large *Waninga* was used, which was made as follows. A long spear was
taken, and close to each end a bar of wood about two feet in length was
fixed at right angles to the length of the spear. Then strands of hair
string were tied on so that they ran from cross bar to cross bar
parallel to the central spear, and at each end the strands passed off,
slantwise, to the latter. In some *Waningas* there may be three cross
bars, in which case the top one is much smaller than the other two, and
an extra series of strands of <span id="page_232">p. 232</span> string
pass from the outer part of the second cross bar to the top one, as
shown in the figure (Fig. 39). The string is not all of one kind, but,
in the one figured for example, the strands nearest to the central spear
were of black human hair, then followed a band consisting of about eight
strands of red-ochred opossum fur string, then a band of grey bandicoot
fur string and again, on the margin, another band of opossum fur. The
whole *Waninga* had white birds' down sprinkled over it and made to
adhere to the string, as usual, by means of human blood. This object is
the most elaborate and certainly the most artistic of all those which
are used in connection with the various ceremonies.

In this particular ceremony the whole *Waninga* represented the body of
a rat, the main part was supposed to be the trunk of the animal, the
point end, the tail, and the handle end, the head, so that when in use
the latter was carried downwards. The cross bars represented the limbs.
The *Waninga* was carried by an *Okilia* while another man walked behind
to steady it. Two other men were decorated to represent two *Kutta
kutta* or little night hawks. When all was ready the *Wurtja* was
brought blindfolded as usual from his brake to the *Apulla* ground,
where he remained with his head covered up until the performers had got
into position in front of him. They approached from the south side,
making a circuit and walking with their backs turned towards the
*Apulla* until they got opposite to, and about thirty yards from, the
*Wurtja*, when the bandage was at once taken from his eyes. The two
little hawk men with legs wide apart and hands grasping the ends of a
stick which was held across the shoulders, came along down the *Apulla*
lines towards the audience, sliding and quivering as they did so. Then
they quickly returned, and were followed by the *Waninga* carriers who
ran down the lines, stooping and bending the *Waninga* towards the
*Wurtja*, but without touching him. Stopping every now and then, they
stood erect and quivered or stood still. This was done several times,
and then finally all four men came into the *Apulla* lines at the same
time, the two little hawk men being at first in front; the latter then
retired to the sides, and the *Waninga* carriers came on quivering. Then
a man who <span id="page_233">p. 233</span> <span id="page_234">p.
234</span> was *Ikuntera* to the boy stepped out, and taking the
*Waninga* <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) set it up in the
*Apulla* path, and the *Wurtja* was told by *Oknia* and *Okilia* men to
go out and embrace it, which he did for some minutes, while the men who
had carried it stood by, and the others, gathered together at the brake,
sang of the *Waninga*, and of the wanderings of the rat men in the
Alcheringa. Once more the usual instructions and warnings were given to
the *Wurtja*, and he was made to lie down with his head covered while
another ceremony of a simple nature was prepared. The men around him
occupied the time in singing about a party of Alcheringa individuals who
started to walk from a place called Ayaiya. After the singing had gone
on for about an hour, the *Wurtja* was told to look up, and, when he did
so, he saw a number of men lying about the *Apulla* ground who at once
began to hop about and to imitate the sound made by kangaroos. One old
man in particular was noticeable from the way in which he mimicked the
movements of an old and disabled animal. After hopping in and about the
*Apulla* ground for some minutes, they bunched up together at the
western end of the ground and then suddenly, rising with a loud shout of
“*Pau pau pau*,” ran away to a small gully out of sight of the *Wurtja*,
who was told that these represented a party of Alcheringa men starting
off from Ayaiya. After this, and while further preparations were being
made, the *Wurtja* remained with the audience, but had his head covered.
The tradition dealing with this special group of kangaroos relates that
the party split into two, a larger and a smaller one, and that the
larger one travelled on ahead of the smaller one. When preparing for the
ceremony, the bodies were first of all rubbed over with red ochre, then
two young men opened veins, first in one arm and then in the other, and
allowed the blood to flow out in a stream over the heads and bodies of
those who were about to take part in the

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

ceremony. These men, who were ten in number, were then ornamented with
little patches of down, but, unlike the usual plan of ornamentation,
there was no regular pattern made, the reason for this being that the
Alcheringa men had not used any regular pattern.

Each man carried on his head, and also between his teeth, a small mass
of wooden shavings saturated with blood.

When all was ready they went, with the exception of three who stayed
behind, on to the *Apulla* ground, walking in single file and carrying
twigs of Eucalyptus in their hands. When they reached the ground a young
man, who led the column and represented a young and frolicsome kangaroo
which, according to tradition, accompanied the marchers, lay down
sideways across the entrance to the path, with his back towards the
*Wurtja*. The other men stood in the path with <span id="page_236">p.
236</span> their legs wide apart, one behind the other, shifting their
heads from side to side and making the twigs quiver. Then the *Wurtja*
was told to sit up and the performers at once greeted his appearance
with imitations of the sounds made by kangaroos; then the young kangaroo
called *Kulla Kulla*, began frisking about and pretending to rush at the
other performers, and, finally, darted between the legs of each man and
emerged at the western end of the column, where he lay down quietly a
few minutes. After he had gone through this performance four times, he
was caught up as he came through the legs of the man nearest to the
*Wurtja*. The two front men then picked him up and carried him bodily,
standing astride of him, and laid him on his back on top of the
*Wurtja*, upon whom all of the performers then threw themselves, so that
the unfortunate novice had actually to bear the weight of the whole mass
of men. As a result of this the *Wurtja* himself did not appear to be
any the worse for what must have been a somewhat trying experience, but
one of the two men who had carried the *Kulla Kulla* fainted as soon as
the men extricated themselves. The stoical calmness of the *Wurtja* was
most marked throughout the whole ceremony. After this first act in the
performance, the men who had taken part in it seated themselves amongst
the audience, and the remaining three men came on to the ground and went
through the same performance, one of them personating a young kangaroo,
who was carried up to and laid on the *Wurtja*, the other two men lying
on the top of him. For this lying down on the top of the *Wurtja* there
is a special term used—*wultha-chelpima*. After the usual explanations
and cautions the *Wurtja* was led back to his brake.

On the morning of the ninth day the *Wurtja* was carefully greased all
over by the *Okilia*, who was especially in charge of him, and he
remained crouching or lying down at his brake until noon, when he was
brought blindfolded to the ground. Then the kangaroo performance of the
previous day was again enacted, the performance including the lying down
upon the *Wurtja*.

In addition, however, to the decorations of the previous day, four of
the old men wore on their heads a half circle <span id="page_237">p.
237</span> made of grass stalks, bound round with fur string and
decorated with white down called *Atnuta*. Each of these represented a
dead kangaroo, which was carried on the head by the Alcheringa kangaroo
ancestor as he marched across the country. In connection with this myth
it is of interest to note that at the present day when a kangaroo or
wallaby is killed the limbs are always dislocated at the joints, which
makes them hang more limply and so renders them more easy to carry. In
this condition the body is spoken of as *Atnuta* and the act of
dislocating is called *ullakakulla*. After the performance the *Atnuta*
were taken off the heads and handed round, while each man squatting on
the ground kept the object pressed round his stomach for a few minutes,
the *Wurtja* doing this also.

After this two more kangaroo ceremonies were performed, the second of
which was of some importance. The principal performer carried a
*Waninga*, which was really a double one, the top part representing a
separate small one attached to the large one. The large *Waninga*
represented an old man kangaroo and the small one his son. Two men, as
usual, carried the *Waninga*, the front one supporting it on his back
while the other man helped to keep it upright as they advanced and
retreated along the *Apulla* path, stopping every now and then to quiver
and to bend the *Waninga* over towards the *Wurtja*. The *Ikuntera* man
then stood up, and taking the *Waninga* from the performers, fixed it
upright in the path, and the boy was once more told to go up and embrace
it. The showing of the *Waninga* to the *Wurtja* is called
*amba-keli-irrima*, which means the child sees and knows. The embracing
of the *Waninga* is called *eliaqua erkuma*. After the performance the
*Wurtja* was once more instructed and cautioned not to reveal anything
to women and children, and then made to lie down, while in loud fierce
tones the men sang the *Lartna* song, “*irri yulta yulta rai*,” &c.,
striking the ground with their shields as they did so. Then the *Wurtja*
was taken back to his brake, where he remained till about nine o'clock
at night, when he was brought to the *Apulla*, and there his head was
decorated with stalks of cane grass, while at the same time the other
men decorated themselves <span id="page_238">p. 238</span> in the same
way, inserting, in addition, stalks beneath their arm bands.

When this had been done the brake of boughs at which the men assembled
was built higher and the men all crouched behind it. Then, at a signal
from the old *Oknia*, the women once more approached from the main camp,
shouting as they did so, “*pai! pai! pai!*” and took possession of the
*Apulla* ground upon which they danced for some minutes. Then they went
and stood on one side, which was the signal for the men to come out and
stand on the *Apulla*. Then once more the women came up and joined the
men, while the latter danced round, and the women, shouting “*pai! pai!
pai!*” plucked the grass stalks from their heads. The men all danced
with their faces turned towards the east as in the stripping dance at a
later time, one or more women standing behind each man. Then the *Mura*
woman, who had previously given the fire-stick to the novice, after
having stripped the *Wurtja* as he danced along with the other men,
suddenly stopped, and, placing her head through his legs from behind,
hoisted him on to her shoulders, and ran off with him followed by all
the other women to a spot behind, and in a line with, the *Apulla*, from
which it was distant about fifty yards. Here she placed him sitting on
the ground, she herself sitting behind, clasping him in her arms, while
some *Mia* and *Uwinna* women sat close behind her. The rest of the
women continued to dance in front of the *Wurtja* shouting “*pai! pai!
pai!*” and making a movement of invitation by slightly lifting the hands
up and down with the arms bent at the elbows, while moving the fingers
as if to beckon the *Wurtja* to them. This characteristic movement is
adopted by the women during the course of various ceremonies, and is
always associated with the idea of inviting the men to come to them.

At the *Apulla* the men sat down and sang the fire song:—

“Atnylinga etunja illa althara wuntama,”

 

over and over again. *Atnylinga* is the red flower of a species of
Eremophila, which, in the Alcheringa, was made red by much burning;
*etunja* is a twig of Eucalyptus; *althara* means <span id="page_239">p.
239</span> blazing up; and *illa wuntama* is the term applied to a fire
which is rushing along, like one which has been lit on a windy day
amongst the porcupine-grass on the sand hills. This special song is
always sung on the night preceding the preparation of the *Arachitta*
poles, the twigs used for swathing which are always put through a
blazing fire.

The singing continued for about half an hour, after which the
*Urinthantima* man, as well as another *Mura* man and the *Okilia* in
charge of the novice, ran towards the women holding shields before their
faces. The first-named seized the *Wurtja*, and, assisted by the other
two, took him back to the *Apulla*, where he was told to lie down and
his face was covered while the singing of the fire-song continued at
intervals all night long. As soon as the *Wurtja* was taken from them
the women ran away to the main camp.

At daybreak the *Urinthantima* man rubbed the *Wurtja* all over with dry
red ochre and then wound fur string round his head, so as to completely
hide his hair from sight, while the other men sang—

“Purta purta airpinta airpintina,”

 

the song sung while preparing the *Arachitta* poles. *Purta* is to
arrange the leaves, to settle them in their right places; *airpinta
airpintina* means round and round again. While this was being done the
women came up to the *Apulla* and danced between the lines, backwards
and forwards, in front of the *Wurtja*, making with their hands the
movement of invitation and shouting “*pai! pai! pai!*” Suddenly the
*Urinthantima* man hoisted the *Wurtja* up on to his shoulders and ran
off with him followed by a number of the younger men, upon which the
women at once ran back to their camp and the singing ceased. When out of
sight of the *Apulla* the *Wurtja* was put down and the men proceeded to
a spot about half a mile distant, where they made big fires and cut down
a number of slender saplings which were to be used for *Arachitta*
poles. The branches were then scorched in the flames while the men sang
the fire-song “*Atnylinga etunja*,” &c. When sufficient material was
prepared they sat down and began to tie twigs on to the poles, the
*Wurtja* assisting <span id="page_240">p. 240</span> by breaking off
twigs and handing them around; but he did not prepare a pole himself,
and during the proceedings was never once spoken to. While at work the
men sang “*purta purta airpinta airpintina*,” and it was afternoon
before the poles, about thirty in number and each about ten feet in
length, were ready. Then a start was made for the *Apulla* ground, the
poles being carried to a spot about two hundred yards from the *Apulla*,
where they were stacked. Here, assisted by the boy's *Okilia*, the
*Urinthantima* man tied twigs of Eremophila on to the *Wurtja's* body
and head and then signalled to the men at the *Apulla* that they were
ready, whereupon they moved away from the ground and shouted to the
women who were waiting at some little distance out of sight. The women
at once ran up and took possession of the *Apulla*, carrying shields and
shouting “*pai! pai! pai!*” On the ground they stood with their backs to
the men's brake and their faces towards the west, from which direction
the *Wurtja's* party was coming. As the latter approached the women
began dancing up and down the lines, making the movement of invitation
and all the time holding their shields against their breasts. The party,
led by the *Urinthantima* man, approached at a run, with the *Wurtja*
concealed in the centre. Each man carried several pieces of bark which,
as they came close at hand, were thrown at the women while the men
shouted loudly “*whirra*,” and the women shielded their faces. At close
quarters a final volley of pieces of bark was the signal to the women to
go, which they did, running away pell mell, their pace accelerated by
the vehement shouting of the men who were standing about in all
directions away from the *Apulla*, to which they returned as soon as the
women had gone. The bushes were taken off the *Wurtja* by the
*Urinthantima* and *Okilia*, and he was told to remain in a crouching
position.

The *Apulla* ground was now carefully cleaned, and the *Wurtja's* brake
removed to within a few yards of the western end of the path, after
which a council, in which *Oknia*, *Okilia* and *Gammona* took part, was
held, the object being to appoint another official known as *Wulya*,
whose duty was that of painting a design on the back of the *Wurtja*.
The <span id="page_241">p. 241</span> choice of the design is left
entirely to the *Wulya*, but it must be one of the *Ilkinia*, that is,
the series of designs emblematic of the totems, and he is expected also
to choose one belonging to a totem group of his own locality. During
this conference two *Okilia* had been sitting opposite to one another,
and as soon as the choice had been made, one of them smoothed over the
ground between them, and then the other, who in this instance belonged
to the same locality as the *Wurtja*, crossed over and sat down between
the legs of the first man. Then a man, *Gammona* too, and of the same
locality as the *Wurtja*, stepped out and brought back the old man who
was *Ipmunna* to the *Wurtja*, and upon whom the choice had fallen. He
came with well-simulated reluctance, as if he felt himself overpowered
with the honour thus conferred upon him, and sat down in front of the
two *Okilia* in the space vacated by the man who had crossed over. When
he was seated, the front one of the two *Okilia* took up a boomerang,
and with much deliberation drew the flat side three times steadily along
the ground, thus making a smooth little trench, out of which he scooped
a little soil, and then, shuffling along on his knees, emptied it into
the hands of the *Ipmunna* man. Then he embraced him and rubbed his head
against the old man's stomach. Then the other *Okilia*, the *Gammona*
and the *Oknia*, in the order named, embraced the old man. The latter
belonged to a northern locality, and in choosing him a well-recognised
compliment had been paid both to himself and to his local group, as the
*Wurtja* belonged to a southern group of the tribe. A somewhat unusual
occurrence now took place. The old *Atwia atwia* man, who had been
appointed to perform the actual operation of circumcision, came up and
held a whispered conversation with the newly appointed *Wulya*, the gist
of which was that he was an old man, that his eyesight was failing, and
that he desired the consent of the council who determined these matters
to depute his duties to his son. This necessitated a long whispered
consultation, not that there was any serious objection to the proposal;
indeed the old man is regarded as so great a man in the tribe, being
recognised as an *oknirabata*, that no one would dream of opposing his
wish in a matter such as <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> this, but
simply because anything like hasty action, in connection with an affair
of mysterious import like one of the initiation ceremonies, would be
completely out of keeping with the feelings of the natives. It was
decided to grant the request, and the son was then called up, and after
another whispered conversation the council broke up. When this was over,
all the men began to decorate themselves with various patterns, which
had no special significance; the two *Atwia atwia* were prominently
painted on the face, and their cheeks were blackened with charcoal, so
that they were easily distinguishable from the others. The *Wurtja*
remained crouching at his brake for some little time, after which the
newly appointed *Wulya*, together with the two men of the same name who
had done the first painting, came up to him and began to paint on his
back a design of the Okranina or carpet snake totem of a place called
Tharlinga, away to the north in the Hanns range, that is, in the
locality of the man who did the painting, but it must be remembered that
there was no obligation upon the man to paint a design of either his own
or the boy's totem. As a matter of fact, the totem of the *Wurtja* was a
grass seed and that of the painter a crow. The design, which occupied
the greater part of the boy's back, was done in white pipe-clay, and
before commencing to draw it, the newly appointed *Wulya* rubbed the boy
over with grease while he explained to his two companions the nature of
the design which he intended to paint. All three men took part in the
drawing, which consisted of a few concentric circles in the centre, with
corkscrew-like lines around. The circles represented the snake's hole in
the ground, and the other lines were supposed to be snakes playing round
the hole. While the painting proceeded, and it was done with great
deliberation, occupying more than an hour, the old *Ipmunna* man sang in
a low monotonous voice about the snakes of Tharlinga. When at length it
was finished an *Okilia* of the *Wurtja's* locality came up and placed
in his hair two bunches of owl feathers, and then, going away again, he
brought the two *Atwia atwia* to inspect the drawing.

At this stage the men who had previously made the <span id="page_243">p.
243</span> *Arachitta* poles ran away from the *Apulla*, shouting,
“*Pai! pai! pai!*” and brought the poles back with them from where they
had been deposited. When within about fifty yards of the *Wurtja* they
separated into two parties, one crossed in front of him from left to
right, and the other from right to left, and the poles were deposited
about twenty yards to either side of him; what was the meaning of this
cannot be said, the native explanation as usual being that it was thus
done in the Alcheringa. Possibly it may be associated in some way with
the division of the tribe into two moieties, but there was no evidence
of this so far as the actual constitution of the two parties was
concerned, that is, members of one moiety did not go to one side and
members of the other to the other.

Just before dusk two *Okilias* went out and stood, one on the eastern
end of each of the raised banks, with their arms in a somewhat curious
attitude, the palm of the hand being turned so that it faced backwards
and the elbow bent, so that the hand lay in the arm-pit. The
*Urinthantima* man went and sat down in the place usually occupied by
the *Wurtja* when he was watching a ceremony, while the other men seated
around him sang, “*Elunja apirra arara*”—“Hark to the lizards in the
tree.” At a signal from an old *Mura* man, the women, who were waiting
out of sight, came and stood in two groups, one to the left and one to
the right of the *Apulla*. It may be mentioned that here again the
separation had no reference to the classes, though there are certain
occasions during some of the ceremonies connected with initiation when
this separation does take place. As soon as the women arrived the two
*Okilias* came down from the bank, ran to the *Wurtja's* brake and
quickly tore down the bushes which hid him from view, so that he was
seen crouching down. The *Okilias* then knelt down, one on either side
of him, and the three at once ran quickly, on all fours, to the
*Apulla*, where the *Wurtja* lay down on top of the *Urinthantima*, who
was himself lying down on his back. In this position the two remained
for about ten minutes. While this was taking place a woman who was *Mia*
to the *Wurtja* came and sat down behind one of the *Oknia*, while two
others sat behind two <span id="page_244">p. 244</span> other *Oknia*.
At the same time the men who had brought in the *Arachitta* poles, and
were about to wear them attached to their legs, were busily engaged,
with the assistance of other men and some of the women, in fastening
them on. At the end of the ten minutes the *Urinthantima* man wriggled
out from underneath the boy, who remained lying face downwards on the
ground. The old *Ipmunna* stood close by, explaining the design on the
back of the *Wurtja*, and after a time called up two old women, who,
like himself, were *Ipmunna* <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) to
the boy, to come up and rub out the design. They came forwards with
apparent reluctance, though in reality highly honoured by being thus
chosen, and, stooping down, effaced the drawing by rubbing it over with
their foreheads.

The men with the *Arachitta* poles were now ready to come on to the
*Apulla*, and there, with the poles attached to their ankles, they ran
up and down between the banks, dancing and singing, while the women,
shouting, followed them all about, stripping the leaves as they did so
from off the poles. It was now dark, but piling the two brakes, which
had served their purpose and would not be used again, on top of one
another, the whole mass was set on fire, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md) and the flames lighted up a scene of the
weirdest description possible, on which the *Wurtja* looked in silence
apparently quite unmoved. Suddenly the old *Mura* man gave out a great
roar, the dancing ceased, and, followed by menacing shouts from the men,
the women made haste back to their own camp, while from all sides the
sound of bull-roarers was heard. At this signal the *Wurtja* was laid
down on his back, and some of the *Oknia* and *Okilia* men, taking up a
number of the *Arachitta* poles, stacked them on top of him, lifting
them up and down as if beating time with them on his body, while they
all sang wildly:—

“Ingwa alkirna alkirni li  
Urtnanthi alkirli impara.”

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

*Ingwa* means night or darkness; *alkirna*, twilight; *alkirni li*, a
great clear light; *urtnanthi*, a lot of trees growing close together;
*alkirli*, like the sky; *impara*, rising red like the sun.

All was now excitement; the fire was giving out a brilliant light, and
the two *Atwia atwia* men took up a position at the western end of the
*Apulla* path. With their beards thrust into their mouths, their legs
widely extended and their arms <span id="page_246">p. 246</span>
stretched forwards, the two men stood perfectly still, the actual
operator in front and his assistant pressing close up behind him, so
that their bodies were in contact with each other. The front man held in
his extended right hand the small flint knife with which the operation
was to be conducted, and, as soon as they were in position, the
*Ikuntera* man, who was to act as shield bearer, came down the lines,
carrying the shield on his head and at the same time snapping the thumb
and first finger of each hand. Then, facing the fire, he knelt down on
one knee just a little in front of the operator, holding his shield
above his head. During the whole time the bull-roarers were sounding all
round so loudly that they could easily be heard by the women and
children in their camp, and by them it is supposed that the roaring is
the voice of the great spirit *Twanyirika*, who has come to take the boy
away. <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md)

The *Arachitta* poles were then quickly removed from the top of the
*Wurtja*, and he was at once lifted up by *Okilia* and *Oknia* men, who
ran, carrying him feet foremost, and placed him on the shield. Then in
deep, loud tones the *Lartna* song was sung, indeed almost thundered
out, by the men:—

“Irri yulta yulta rai  
Ul katchera ul katch ar-arai  
Irri yulta yulta rai  
Ul katchera ul katch ai.”

The assisting *Atwia atwia* at once grasped the foreskin, pulled it out
as far as possible and the operator cut it off, and

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

immediately, along with all the men who had acted in any official
capacity during the whole course of the proceedings, retired out of the
lighted area, while the boy, in a more or less dazed condition, was
supported by his *Oknia* and *Okilia*, who said to him, “You have done
well, you have not cried out.” Then he was led back to where the old
brake had stood and received the congratulations of the men, and at the
same time the blood from the wound was allowed to flow into a shield,
which was given to him by a young *Oknia*, to whom afterwards he will
have, in return, to present an offering of food.

While he was still bleeding an *Okilia* brought up some of the
bull-roarers and, pressing them on the wound, told him that it was these
and not *Twanyirika* which made the sound, that they were sacred
Churinga and must never be shown or even mentioned to the women. To this
the boy listened in silence. After a time, when the bleeding had
diminished, he was led to the eastern end of the *Apulla*, where he
stood between two *Okilia* looking towards the west, while two other
*Okilia*, each taking an *Arachitta* pole, mounted the bank and holding
their poles over the path shouted loudly, moving them up and down as
they did so, “*Arara, arara, arara*,” which is the signal for the
officials, who had been standing on one side in the shade, to come on to
the *Apulla* ground once more. This they did, one at a time, in the
following order, though there did not appear to be any rule with regard
to precedence, as one man would urge another to go up:—*Wulya*, who
superintended the first painting; *Urinthantima*; *Wulya*, *Wulya*,
these two had assisted at the first painting; *Atwia atwia*, the actual
operator; *Atwia atwia*, the assistant; *Wulya*, of the final painting;
*Wulya*, the assistant of the last man; *Elucha*. As each man came up
the *Okilia* shouted, “This is *Wulya* (and so on through the list), do
not mention his name,” and then each of them embraced the boy in turn,
pressing their bodies together. <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116.md) As
each man came up and the presentation was made, the same ceremony was
gone through, and in turn every one of those who had taken any special
part was named by the *Okilia*, whose

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

cry, “*Arara, arara, arara*,” rang out sharply in the darkness, for the
fire had now burnt down. When the presentations were over the oldest
*Okilia* produced a bundle of Churinga (wooden ones for stone ones are
never used on this occasion), saying as he did so, “Here is
*Twanyirika*, of which you have heard so much, they are Churinga, and
will help to heal you quickly; guard them well and do not lose them, or
you and your *Mia, Ungaraitcha* and *Quitia* (that is, blood and tribal
mothers and sisters) will be killed; do not let them out of your sight,
do not let your *Mia, Ungaraitcha* and *Quitia* see you, obey your
*Okilia*, who will go with you, do not eat forbidden food.” These
commands were spoken sternly, as if to impress them forcibly upon the
novice, who stood silent with bent head.

In the particular ceremony here described, as soon as these instructions
had been given, a man who had been dispatched for the purpose brought on
to the ground two young *Arakurta* who had been operated upon five or
six weeks before. Acting on instructions from their guardian, they at
once knelt down in front of and with their backs to the newly-made
*Arakurta*, and he, being told what to do by his *Okilia*, took a
Churinga from his bundle, and, holding it in both hands, scraped their
backs with the sacred implement. This is called *Untungalirrima*, and
places all three *Arakurta* on equal terms and makes them friends. The
two kneeling *Arakurta* were then told to go away quickly to their own
camp, which they did. This does not, of course, frequently take place,
but only when two operations have followed closely on one another.

For some time the boy, who has now reached the stage of *Arakurta*, the
term *Wurtja* applying to him only during the relatively short interval
between the time when he is painted and that at which the operation of
circumcision is performed, remained standing over a fire, the smoke from
which is supposed to be efficacious in healing his wounds. Finally he
was taken away by a single *Okilia* man, in whose charge he was to
remain until his wounds were healed and the operation of *Ariltha* was
performed. On this occasion he joined the other two *Arakurta* in their
camp.

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

Whilst there is no fixed rule on the subject, the man who takes charge
of the *Arakurta* is preferably one to whom the boy's sister has been
promised, failing such an one he may be an *Oknia, Okilia* or a *Mura*
man.

There are certain restrictions and customs which must be observed by the
more immediate relations of the boy which may be here noticed, as they
will serve to show still more clearly the importance attached to the
initiation ceremonies in the eyes of the natives. From the time at which
the boy receives the fire-stick brought by his *Mia*, until his complete
recovery from the operation of sub-incision, the *Mia* must have no
intercourse with the father of the boy. Any breach of this rule would
result in the boy growing up into *Ertwa akurna*, a bad man, or
*Atna-arpinta*, that is, too much given to sexual pleasures, while
strict observance will ensure his growing up *Ertwa mura*, or a good man
(using the terms good and bad in the native sense).

After the presentation of the fire-stick and until *Lartna* has been
performed, the *Mura tualcha* woman (that is, the future mother-in-law
of the boy) is tabu to the actual *Mia*, or, if she be dead, to the
*Mia* who hands to her the fire-stick. When *Lartna* has been performed,
the *Mura tualcha* woman goes to the camp of the *Mia*, and, approaching
her from behind, rubs her all over with red ochre; then the *Mia* hands
to her a *pitchi* full of seed, and in this way the tabu is removed.

While the *Arakurta* is out in the bush the *Mia* may not eat opossum,
or the large lace lizard, or carpet snake, or any fat, as otherwise she
would retard her son's recovery. Every day she greases her
digging-sticks and never allows them out of her sight; at night time she
sleeps with them close to her head. No one is allowed to touch them.
Every day also she rubs her body all over with grease, as in some way
this is supposed to help her son's recovery.

After the operation of *Lartna*, the foreskin, amongst the Finke River
groups of natives, is handed over to the eldest *Okilia* of the boy who
is present, and he also takes charge of the shield in the haft of which
the blood from the wound was collected. The piece of skin he greases and
then gives to a <span id="page_251">p. 251</span> boy who is the younger
brother of the *Arakurta*, and tells him to swallow it, the idea at the
present day being that it will strengthen him and cause him to grow tall
and strong. The shield is taken by the *Okilia* to his camp, where he
hands it over to his *Unawa*, or wife, and she then rubs the blood over
the breasts and foreheads of women who are *Mia alkulla*, that is, elder
sisters of the boy's actual *Mia* and *Ungaraitcha*, or elder sisters of
the boy.

These women must not on any account touch the blood themselves, and
after rubbing it on, the woman adds a coat of red ochre. The actual
*Mia* is never allowed to see the blood.

Amongst some groups of Western Arunta the foreskin is presented to a
sister of the *Arakurta*, who dries it up, smears it with red ochre, and
wears it suspended from her neck.

THE CEREMONY OF HEAD BITING.

 

While the *Arakurta* is out in the bush the men go and visit him
occasionally, and on these occasions he has to undergo a painful rite
called *Koperta kakuma*, or head biting. He is placed, lying face
downwards, while men of all classes sit round, singing about the biting
of the head of the *Arakurta* and urging the biters to bite deeply. The
men who are to do the biting and who may be of any class and are usually
from two to five in number, are chosen, on each occasion on which the
operation is performed, by the oldest *Okilia* of the *Arakurta*. Their
duty is to bite the scalp as hard as they can, until blood flows freely,
the patient often howling with pain. Each man may content himself with
one bite or he may bite two or even three times. The object of this
really painful operation is, so they say, to make the hair grow
strongly, and at times the chin may be bitten as well as the scalp.

THE CEREMONY OF SUB-INCISION OR ARILTHA.

 

As a general rule there is an interval of about five or six weeks
between the ceremony of *Lartna* and that of *Ariltha*, but at times it
may be even longer, and it depends simply upon the length of time
occupied by the recovery of the boy from the effects of the first
operation.

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

The operation of *Ariltha* is regarded as of at least equal importance
with that of circumcision, and, unlike the latter, the women are
completely excluded and not allowed to take any part.

The particular ceremony now to be described took place when the
operation was performed upon the two *Arakurta* to whom reference was
made in the account of the *Lartna* ceremony. One of them belonged to
the Purula and the other to the Kumura class. As a general rule the
operation is only performed on one *Arakurta* at a time, but this is a
matter of no importance and simply depends upon whether or not more than
one boy has recently undergone the earlier ceremony of *Lartna* and is
ready for this second one. We have never heard of the operation being
performed upon more than two at the same time and even this is not of
very common occurrence.

When the ceremony was to take place the men assembled at the camp of the
*Arakurta*, out in the bush, where they had been living away from every
one else since the last operation had been performed on them. They were
under the charge of an *Okilia*, and when the men had assembled the two
*Arakurta*, who were not informed of what was about to happen, though
very probably they were perfectly well aware, when all the men
assembled, that something further was in store for them, were told to
lie flat down on the ground. Then their heads were covered over and all
the young men of the same two sub-classes as the *Arakurta* were made to
lie down beside them, though they had of course all of them passed
through the ceremony before, as none but initiated men are allowed to be
present on an occasion such as this. The older Kumara and Purula and all
the Bulthara and Panunga men gathered together and for hours sang of the
Achilpa men belonging to the group which marched north by way of Henbury
on the Finke River. During the night there was performed first a Quabara
belonging to the Achilpa (wild cat) totem, and at the close of the
performance the two *Arakurta* joined in the dance round the performers.
When it was over they were told who the individuals were with whom the
Quabara was concerned, they were also told that they must <span
id="page_253">p. 253</span> not speak of it to women and children, and
then it was explained to them that certain Quabara belonged to
particular groups of men who alone had the right to perform them. Later
on during the night another Quabara was performed, this time concerned
with the emu totem. Then once more they were made to lie down, while the
old men went away to a brake of boughs which had been built at a
distance of about fifty yards from the spot at which the boys lay down
under the charge of their guardian. The rest of the night was spent in
singing over and over again a short chant concerning the bandicoot totem
and the *Nurtunja*. The reason for this was that the *Oknia* and
*Okilia* of the two *Arakurta*, who formed again a kind of council to
direct the proceedings, had requested an old bandicoot man to perform a
sacred ceremony in which a *Nurtunja* was used, as it was essential in
this part of the tribe to have one of these in connection with the
ceremony of *Ariltha*. The old bandicoot man was a Panunga and belonged
to the Ilpirra tribe away to the north of the Arunta. The *Nurtunja*, to
which we shall have occasion to refer frequently, figures largely in
many of the sacred ceremonies and varies very much in form. The one used
in the present instance was made out of a long spear around which grass
stalks were laid and the whole was then ensheathed with human hair
string. It was then ornamented with alternate rings of red and white
bird's down, while a large tuft of eagle-hawk feathers was fixed into
the upper end. Very often on these occasions, but not on the particular
one now dealt with, a few Churinga are hung on to the *Nurtunja*. Two
men, one of them *Oknia* of the Purula boy and the other *Okilia* of the
Kumara, were decorated by the old bandicoot man to perform the ceremony,
and just at daybreak the *Arakurta* were led from their camp and the
performance began. The Quabara was concerned with an Alcheringa man who
lived at a place called Yerapinthinga and the man who personated him
carried the *Nurtunja* on his back, while he moved backwards and
forwards, towards and away from another man who personated an Alcheringa
woman, whom the bandicoot man was supposed to be attempting to catch and
who warded him off with bushes held in the hand. After a short time the
<span id="page_254">p. 254</span> audience, including the two
*Arakurta*, ran in and danced in front of and under the *Nurtunja* which
was bent over them by the performer, while the dancers held up their
hands as if to catch it, shouting loudly all the time “*Wah! Wah!*”
After this had gone on for some time, the man personating the woman
suddenly jumped round on the ground where he had remained seated all the
time and turned his back on the *Nurtunja*, which was the sign for the
dancing to cease. The *Nurtunja* was taken off the performer's back by
the old bandicoot man to whom it belonged and then, after scooping out a
hole in the ground, he fixed it upright. As soon as this was done the
two *Arakurta* were told by *Oknia* and *Okilia* men to go up to and
embrace the *Nurtunja*, and while they <span id="page_255">p. 255</span>
were doing this they were told that they were about to undergo the rite
of *Ariltha* and that the embracing of the *Nurtunja*, which lasted ten
minutes, would prevent the operation from being painful and that they
need not be afraid.

The oldest *Okilia* man now said “Who will be *Tapunga?*” Two men
volunteered, one man a Panunga and the other a Purula. The former at
once lay on his stomach on the ground and the latter on the top of him,
and when this kind of living table was ready the Kumara *Arakurta* was
led from the *Nurtunja*, close to which the men had lain down, and then
placed lying at full length on his back on top of the *Tapunga*. As soon
as ever he was in position another man sat astride of his body, grasped
the penis and put the urethra on the stretch. The operator who is called
*Pininga* and is chosen by the *Oknia* and *Okilia*, then approached and
<span id="page_256">p. 256</span> quickly, with a stone knife, laid open
the urethra from below. The man was an *Ikuntera* of the *Arakurta*. As
soon as this was done, the boy was lifted off and immediately the Purula
*Arakurta* was placed in position on the same *Tapunga* and the same man
again performed this operation. When all was over, the two, who had now
passed beyond the *Arakurta* stage and were *Ertwa-kurka* or initiated
men, were led to one side while they squatted over shields into which
the blood was allowed to drain. After this, *Okilia* men came up to them
and tied the pubic tassels on, telling them that they were now
*Ertwa-kurka* and that they had no more operations to fear and that they
were admitted to the ranks of the men.

After the operation of *Ariltha* has been performed, the newly made
*Ertwa-kurka* sits down as described on a shield into the haft of which
the blood is allowed to flow and from which it is emptied into the
centre of a fire which is made for the purpose. If much pain be caused
by the wound he will return to the ash heap and scooping out a little
hole in the centre, will place therein some glowing pieces of charcoal
and upon these he will urinate, thus causing steam to arise which is
said to give great relief to the pain. Until the young man's wound has
healed he is supposed to lie only upon his back for otherwise the organ
would grow crooked. <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md)

Until the *Arakurta* has undergone and quite recovered from the ceremony
of sub-incision, he is forbidden to eat the flesh of opossum, snake,
echidna and all lizards. Should he eat any of these his recovery would
be retarded and his wounds would become much inflamed. In addition to
these there exists in the case of each individual the restriction with
regard to the eating of his totem, and to every one not only at this,
but at all times, there exists the general restriction with regard to
the eating of the wild cat.

At the moment when the *Arakurta* is seized for the purpose of having
the rite of *Ariltha* performed upon him the men set up a loud shout of
“*Pirr-rr*”—loud enough to be

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

heard by the women in their camp. The latter at once assemble at the
*Erlukwirra*, that is the women's camp, and the *Mia* of the boy cuts
the *Unchalkulkna* woman across the stomach and shoulders, and then
makes similar cuts upon women who are the boy's *Mura* and elder and
younger sisters, as well as upon those who are her own elder sisters.
While making the cuts she imitates the sound made by the *Ariltha*
party. These cuts, which generally leave behind them a definite series
of cicatrices, are called *urpma* and are often represented by definite
lines on the Churinga. It very often happens that, as soon as the
operation has been performed on an *Arakurta*, one or more of the
younger men present, who have been operated on before, stand up and
voluntarily undergo a second operation. In such cases the men do not
consider that the incision has been carried far enough. Standing out on
the clear space close by the *Nurtunja*, with legs wide apart and hands
behind his back, the man shouts out “*Mura Ariltha atnartinja yinga
aritchika pitchi*”;—“*Mura* mine come and cut my *Ariltha* down to the
root.” Then one *Mura* man comes and pinions him from behind, while
another comes up in front and seizing the penis first of all cuts out an
oval shaped piece of skin which he throws away and then extends the slit
to the root. Most men at some time or other undergo the second operation
and some come forward a third time, though a man is often as old as
thirty or thirty-five before he submits to this second operation which
is called *ariltha erlitha atnartinja*.

The *Ertwa-kurka* carry the Churinga about with them just as the
*Arakurta* did until they have completely recovered. When the man in
charge of them announces that they are recovered from the effects of the
operation, the men all assemble out in the bush, and the *Oknia* and
*Okilia* appoint a man to act as what is called *Irkoa-artha*. It is his
duty to remove all the decorations from the body of the *Ertwa-kurka*,
after which the latter is told to lie down on his face while the men
sing a chant, which is supposed to have the effect of promoting the
growth of his hair, and he is told that he must not speak for some time
to the *Irkoa-artha* and then not until he has made a present of food,
which is called *Chaurilia*, to the individual in question.

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

Then the men, accompanied by the *Ertwa-kurka*, assemble at some little
distance from the main camp and begin to sing in loud tones:

“Chuk-ur-rokerai yaa li chaakaa-a

Yaama kank waa

Inkwurkna inkwurkna atnai

Inkwurkna inkwurkna atnai.”

The women, hearing the singing, assemble near to the main camp and begin
to dance as they did at the *Apulla*. The song of the men ceases as soon
as they approach the women, and at a distance of about fifty yards they
halt and shout “*tirra, tirra, tirra*,” a sound which much resembles
that made by whirling bull-roarers and which is at once taken up by the
women. The young *Ertwa-kurka*, who is now completely undecorated, steps
out from the group of men, runs up close to the women, who continue
dancing, and then suddenly wheels round and runs off into the bush,
where he is followed by a number of the men who camp with him for the
night, during which, without the performance of any special ceremony,
singing is kept up until daybreak. Before it is light the *Ertwa-kurka*
is dressed up by *Okilia* and *Umbirna* men with all the ornaments such
as forehead band, arm strings, tail tips, etc., which are worn by a
native beau. He is also provided with a shield and spear-thrower, and
just about daylight the party starts for the main camp, the young man
walking in the centre by the side of the *Irkoa-artha* man, while all
shout loudly “*tirra, tirra, tirra*.” When within about fifty yards of
the women, who are dancing and shouting as before, the men halt, and the
*Irkoa-artha* leads the *Ertwa-kurka* on but only accompanies him for a
few yards, after which he goes on alone, carrying his shield in front,
so as to hide his face. When he comes close up to the women one or two
*Ungaraitcha*, that is blood and tribal elder sisters, who are in the
lead carrying *pitchis* (all the other women carry tufts of rat-tails in
their hands), throw the *pitchis* at his shield and then press their
hands on his shoulders from behind, and also rub their faces on his
back, after which they cut off some locks of his hair, which they
afterwards use to make up into hair string ornaments for themselves.
This <span id="page_259">p. 259</span> ceremony is called
*anainthalilima*, and after it is over the *Ertwa-kurka* is free to go
into the presence of the various officials who have taken part in any of
the ceremonies, though he must not speak to or of them until some months
have past, nor must he speak loudly in their presence.

At daylight on the morning of the next day the men provide themselves
with fire-sticks and, surrounding the young man, conduct him to the
women, who are again waiting to receive him. He is fully decorated and
carries a shield and boomerang and some twigs of Eremophila. When the
party is within a short distance of the women the men throw down their
fire-sticks and halt, and the young man steps out from the centre of the
group and throws his boomerang high up in the direction of the spot at
which his mother was supposed to have lived in the Alcheringa. This
throwing of the boomerang in the direction of the mother's Alcheringa
camp, that is, of course, the spot at which the Alcheringa individual of
whom his mother is supposed to be the reincarnation, lived, occurs
during the performance of other ceremonies, such, for example, as those
which accompany the knocking out of teeth in eastern groups of the
Arunta and also in the Ilpirra tribe. It may in all likelihood be
regarded as intended to symbolize the idea that the young man is
entering upon manhood and thus is passing out of the control of the
women and into the ranks of the men. The fact that he is using the
boomerang is indicative of this, and his throwing it towards his
mother's camp is an intimation to her of the fact that he is passing
away from her control; at the same time there remains the curious
feature, the exact significance of which it is difficult to see, that it
is thrown towards the Alcheringa camp rather than towards the mother
herself.

After the throwing of the boomerang, the *Ertwa-kurka* is led forward by
the *Irkoa-artha* man, holding, as before, his shield before his face,
and is placed squatting on a fire which has been prepared by the women,
and which is now covered by green leaves. Behind this the women stand
making the movement of invitation already described and shouting
“*tirra, tirra, tirra*.” The women place their hands on his shoulders
and gently press him down. After remaining on <span id="page_260">p.
260</span> the fire for a short time he is taken off by the
*Irkoa-artha* and handed over to a few young boys who have not yet been
initiated, and who are told to camp with him but on no account to speak
to him. After three days, during which he speaks to no one, men who are
his *Okilia* come out from the men's camp and invite him to join them,
after which he becomes a permanent member of the camp. Before, however,
he may speak to any of the officials who took any part in the various
ceremonies he must go out into the bush and procure game as an offering
to each one of them, this gift being known as *Chaurilia*.

At the presentation of *Chaurilia* the man to whom it is given always
performs some sacred ceremony, after which the mouth of the
*Ertwa-kurka* and those of all present are touched with some sacred
object which has been used during the ceremony, such as a *Nurtunja*,
and in this way the ban of silence is removed. When these ceremonies
have been passed through the native is regarded as an initiated member
of the tribe and may take part in all the sacred ceremonies of his
group, though it is not until he has passed through the Engwurra that he
becomes what is called *Urliara* or a fully-developed man.

The following names, which may be called status names, indicating the
different grades of initiation, are applied to the boy, youth and man at
the times indicated:—

\(1\) *Ambaquerka*, up to the time of throwing up.

In the northern part of the tribe the ceremonies agree in all essential
points with those which have been described in the case of the natives
living along the Finke river. There are <span id="page_261">p.
261</span> however, certain differences in detail which may be
mentioned. Early on the day on which the ceremony of *Lartna* or
circumcision is to commence, the *Ulpmerka* is taken away from the camp
on some pretext, while the men and women spend the day in preparing the
collected food supplies, such as the seeds of acacia or *munyeru*. Every
now and then they break out into the monotonous chant of a corrobboree,
to which the women, but not the men, dance, while a feeling of
suppressed excitement throughout the camp indicates that some ceremony
of more than ordinary importance is about to take place. At sundown the
boy is brought into camp, and, unconscious of what is in store for him,
spends the evening as usual at the men's camp, lying down to sleep
there. Towards the middle of the night, when all is quiet, an elder
brother of the boy, after seeing that the latter is sound asleep, wakens
the other members of the camp, and all together, men and women, they go
to the spot close at hand which has previously been selected. The women
stand quietly on one side while the men, with as little noise as
possible, clear the grass and rubbish away, and thus prepare the
*Apulla* ground. Then all, except three brothers of the boy and two
young women, sit down around the *Apulla*, while the five selected ones
go to the camp to awaken and bring the boy. The two women go in advance,
each of them carrying an *Alparra*, which is a scooped-out piece of wood
such as the women use to carry food and water in, and, creeping quietly
up to the *Ulpmerka*, suddenly strike him sharply with their *Alparras*,
crying out loudly at the same time, “*Utchai! Utchai!*” The boy,
naturally dazed and startled, springs to his feet, when the three men
take hold of him, and tell him that the time has come when he must no
longer remain an *Ulpmerka*, but must be made into a man—an
*Ertwa-kurka*. So soon as the cry of “*Utchai*” is heard the men begin
to sing and the women to dance.

The subsequent proceedings, including the painting by *Uwilia* men and
the handing of the fire-stick by an *Unchalkulkna* woman, though there
may be more than one of these, are much the same as those already
described. On the day on which the actual operation is to be performed
there is, <span id="page_262">p. 262</span> however, a slight variation
in the procedure. After being ornamented with twigs of Eucalyptus, two
rows of spears are fixed upright, one row on either side of the *Apulla*
path. They form a kind of grove, with the path running between them.
About midday, when all is ready, some of the men leave the camp to go
and bring the boy in. When the signal of their return with the boy, who
is hidden out of sight of the women, is given, then the latter at once
go in between the line of spears, and, while some of the older men sing,
perform the *Unthippa* dance, and then, standing by the poles, strip
these of their leaves. As the men with the boy approach they all throw
pieces of bark at the women, a signal to them to disperse and go to
their camp, out of sight of the *Apulla*. The boy is placed at one end
of the path behind a brake of boughs, of which, in this instance, only
one and not two, as described before, is made. At night the women are
brought back, and sit on either side of the path at the base of the
stripped spears. Two *Okilia* go to where the boy is as yet hidden from
the women, throw on one side the boughs, and then, accompanied by the
*Ulpmerka*, hop down the path until they have traversed half its length,
when they diverge, one to the right and one to the left, while the boy
goes on until he collides with a man who has been purposely placed so
that he shall do this. This man is here called *Tapunga*, and at once he
rolls over on to his back, and the boy lies on the top of him. Silence
is now maintained by all. In this position the painting is rubbed off
the *Ulpmerka's* back. Then the *Arachitta* poles are brought in, and as
the men dance the women strip the poles, which are tied on to the legs
as described. The men remain calm, but the women grow wilder and wilder,
singing:—

“Atnintu rappira ka perka-a-a  
Ok nar inta  
Yur a puncha kwi  
Yur a puncha kwi.”

Whilst this is in progress the boy gets off the man's back and sits up
watching the dance, which suddenly ceases when the sound of a
bull-roarer is heard. At once the women run off, and very shortly after
the operation is performed. In this district <span id="page_263">p.
263</span> the man who holds the shield is termed the *Urinthantima*,
and he must belong to the moiety of the tribe to which the boy does not.
The operation is almost always performed by a man who is *Ikuntera* to
the boy, and who is assisted by one, or it may be two men, who are
called *Killarina*, and who must also belong to the other moiety of the
tribe. When all is over the boy is given a bundle of Churinga and sent
out in charge of a man as previously described, until he has recovered,
and is ready for the further operation.

The rite of sub-incision, which may be said to be characteristic of the
great group of tribes occupying the interior parts of Queensland, <span
id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md) New South Wales, and South Australia,
right away to the far north, and at all events a very large part of West
Australia, <span id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_119.md) has frequently been
alluded to by Curr and other writers under the name of the “terrible
rite”—a term which, as Dr. Stirling suggested, may well be discarded. It
consists, as is well known, in sub-incision of the penis, so that the
penile urethra is laid open from the meatus right back to the junction
with the scrotum. It is certainly a most extraordinary practice, and one
which it might be thought would be frequently attended with serious
results; but none such apparently ever follow, though in their native
condition the operation is performed merely with a sharp chipped piece
of flint or a small knife made of a hard flaked quartzite. The Arunta
natives have no idea as to the origin of the practice, and it seems
almost useless to speculate upon it. Mr. Roth has suggested that the
mutilation of the women, which takes place, so far as is known, in all
those tribes where sub-incision is practised by the men, was indirectly
the origin of the latter, “that, on the principle of a form of mimicry,
the analogous sign was inflicted on the male to denote corresponding
fitness on his part.” This still leaves unexplained the mutilation of
the women, and it would seem to be almost simpler to imagine that this
was a consequence of the mutilation of the men.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the Arunta
tribe tradition ascribes the origin of the custom to the members of the
wild cat totem and points clearly to the fact that it was introduced by
the members of some powerful group at a time subsequent to the
introduction of the rite of circumcision.

One thing is clear, and that is that at the present day, and as far back
as their traditions go, the Arunta natives at least have no idea of its
having been instituted with the idea of its preventing or even checking
procreation. In the first place it does not do this. Every man without
exception throughout the Central area, in all tribes in which the rite
is practised, is sub-incised. Under the normal conditions he must be
before he is allowed to take a wife, and infringement of this rule would
simply mean death to him if found out. Though it is true that the number
of children rarely exceeds four or perhaps five in a family, and, as a
general rule, is less still, perhaps two or three, yet the cause of this
is not sub-incision. It is infanticide which is resorted to for the
purpose of keeping down the number of a family. And here we may say that
the number is kept down, not with any idea at all of regulating the food
supply, so far as the adults are concerned, but simply from the point of
view that, if the mother is suckling one child, she cannot properly
provide food for another, quite apart from the question of the trouble
of carrying two children about. An Australian native never looks far
enough ahead to consider what will be the effect on the food supply in
future years if he allows a particular child to live; what affects him
is simply the question of how it will interfere with the work of his
wife so far as their own camp is concerned; while from the woman's side
the question is, can she provide food enough for the new-born infant and
for the next youngest?

The Arunta native does not hesitate to kill a child—always directly it
is born—if there be an older one still in need of nourishment from the
mother, and suckling is continued up to the age often of three years or
even older. With an easy solution, which moreover he does not hesitate
to practise, of the difficulty arising from the birth of too many
children, it is scarcely conceivable that the men should deliberately
pass through a most painful ordeal <span id="page_265">p. 265</span>
with the idea of achieving a result which can be obtained otherwise
without pain or trouble to themselves, and when also they know perfectly
well that the desired result is not obtained by the performance of the
operation. Added to this we have amongst the Arunta, Luritcha, and
Ilpirra tribes, and probably also amongst others such as the Warramunga,
the idea firmly held that the child is not the direct result of
intercourse, that it may come without this, which merely, as it were,
prepares the mother for the reception and birth also of an
already-formed spirit child who inhabits one of the local totem centres.
Time after time we have questioned them on this point, and always
received the reply that the child was not the direct result of
intercourse; so that in these tribes, equally with those dealt with by
Mr. Roth, the practice of sub-incision cannot be attributed to the
desire to check procreation by this means.

In the south of the Arunta tribe the ceremonies again are somewhat
different from these, both in the west and in the east. At Charlotte
Waters, for example, the following is an account, in outline, of what
takes place.

When the time arrives for a boy to be initiated, his *Okilia* talks to
men who are *Umbirna* to the boy and arranges with two of them to carry
out the first part of the proceedings. Towards evening the two *Umbirna*
go to the boy, who has no idea of what has been arranged, and one of
them takes hold of him while the other comes up from behind, carrying a
special small white stone called *aperta irrkurra*, which he puts under
the armpit of the boy. Then taking hold of him, one by each arm, they
take him along with them to the camp of his mother and father. Here, by
previous arrangement, the different members of the camp are assembled.
All the men sit in a roughly semi-circular group, and together with them
are women who stand in the relationship of *Mia* and *Uwinna* to the
boy. The latter, with an *Umbirna* man on either side of him, is then
told to lie down in front of the group, and behind him again are
gathered together the women who are *Ungaraitcha, Itia, Unawa* and
*Unkulla* to him. These women commence to dance to the singing of the
men, and when this has gone on for some little time they retire <span
id="page_266">p. 266</span> behind the group of men, and then the boy is
allowed to go to sleep, watched over during the night by the two
*Umbirna* who are called *Ukarkinja*. The latter wake him early and,
after tying up his hair with whitened string, decorate it with tufts of
eagle-hawk feathers. When this has been done the boy is called
*Au-aritcha*. This over, the boy's *Ungaraitcha* and *Itia* bring him
food in the shape of *munyeru* or grass seed, of which he eats some and
gives the rest to his two *Umbirna*. Then, if she be present, the *Mura*
woman whose daughter has been allotted as wife to the boy, or, in her
absence, the *Umbirna* men, paint him all over with red ochre. After
this, the further ceremonies may either be carried out on the spot or
else the boy may be taken away to a different local group, where the
first part of the ceremonies will then be performed. There does not
appear to be any rule in regard to this. In the event of the boy being
taken away, he goes under the charge of the same two *Umbirna* men,
wearing, as he walks, his hair-string, and carrying the stone under his
arm. On approaching the strange camp the men call out “*Pau! Pau!*”
sharply and loudly, while at the same time each of them swings backwards
one of the boy's arms. The strangers recognise what is happening, and
the men get up, leave the camp near to which the visitors have halted,
and while the women lie down in camp they come out to meet the three.
The hair-string and stone are then taken away from the boy, who is
thrown up in the air by the strangers, who catch and strike him as he
falls. This throwing up is called *Au-aritcha iwuma*. When this is over
the stone is given back to the boy, but the hair-string is given to the
strangers. The boy himself has to go some little distance away and may
not be spoken to by the women, though the men go near and speak to him
freely.

Preparations are then made for the return to the home camp, all the men
and women coming, while the boy, with his two *Umbirna*, walks behind.
At some little distance from the spot at which the men have, during the
boy's absence, made the camp at which the operation of *Lartna* will be
performed, a halt is made, and here the boy and the two *Umbirna* stay
behind for the purpose of painting his body with white pipe <span
id="page_267">p. 267</span> clay, tying up his hair and putting on the
waist band which he now wears for the first time. The strangers,
marching on, announce their approach by the usual sharp cry “*Pau!
Pau!*” The resident old men and women are sitting down at the camp, but
the young men have to go away, to some little distance, so as not to be
seen as yet by the boy. At first the strangers sit down in the customary
way at a short distance from the camp, which they do not enter until, at
a later time, they are invited to do so by the older men. When the
*Au-aritcha* and the *Umbirna* come up they take a position in front of
the strangers and between them and the resident group. After a short
pause the boy's *Ungaraitcha* come out and give him food, and then,
together with his two guardians, he returns to the bush, which is the
signal for the younger men to come from their hiding place and join the
strange group, the members of which come into camp usually about dusk.

In the evening the same women dance as on the previous occasion, the
dance being called *Ilchilcha-intum wuthaperrima*. The dance is repeated
during the course of the following evening, and during the two days
whilst the boy is out of the camp there takes place both a lending and
an interchange of women, the usual class restrictions being, however,
observed. Two men belonging to the resident group will, for example,
determine without saying anything previously to two visiting men to lend
their wives each to one of the latter. During the dance these two men
will get up from the group of men watching the dance, and each one
taking a fire-stick will give it to his wife, who is amongst the
dancers. The woman knows what this means and retires to some distance.
Then the two men return to the main group, and each going behind the man
to whom he desires to show attention, either in return for some past act
of kindness or in anticipation of favours to come, lifts him up by his
elbows and informs him of his intention. The exchange, or lending, is
merely a temporary one, and in this instance only takes place between
those who are *Unawa* to each other.

When the two days are over the boy is brought back and the women are
sent away from the camp where the dancing <span id="page_268">p.
268</span> has taken place and where the operation of *Lartna* will
shortly be performed. As in the case of the south-western or the
Larapinta groups already referred to, various ceremonies are performed
in which a *Waninga* is used, and this the boy is made to embrace before
the operation is performed. When this is about to take place, the boy is
told to lie down on the ground while an *Okilia* puts his hand over the
former's eyes, and a man who is *Unkulla* to the boy goes away to some
little distance. While this takes place, a few, perhaps half a dozen,
men lie down on the ground so as to form a kind of table, and when the
*Okilia* lifts his hand from his eyes the boy sees the *Unkulla* man
approaching at a run. This man places him on the top of the prostrate
men, whom the boy afterwards calls *iruntuwura*, and at once the
operation is performed by an *Ikuntera* man whom the boy calls
*urtwi-urtwia*. The *Okilia* stand by shouting “*arakwirra,
arundertna*”—“You be quiet, do not cry.”

As always, the blood is collected in a shield and is handed over to the
*Okilia*, who thereupon makes a hole in the ground and buries in this
the blood and the foreskin; then small stones are put on top of the
latter, and the hole is filled with sand, on the surface of which a
short piece of stick, perhaps six inches long, is laid down
horizontally. This stick is called *Ultha*, and neither the boy who has
been operated upon nor yet any woman, may go near to it.

When the operation of *Lartna* is over, the boy is called *Atnurrinia*.
As soon as he has recovered, the operation of *Ariltha* is performed in
much the same manner as already described, except that in this southern
district no *Nurtunja* is made. The men who lie down on the ground are
called *Atrapurntum*; the *Unkulla* man who sits on the boy's chest is
called *Ikwarta*, and the *Ikuntera* man who performs the ceremony is
called *Pininya*. It is usual during the ceremony for the *Unkulla* man
to take off his hair girdle and to lay it down close beside the boy with
the object of preventing too great a flow of blood.

After the operation of *Ariltha* the novice is called *Allallumba*. When
it is over he is taken out into the bush by <span id="page_269">p.
269</span> an *Okilia* who may be accompanied by a *Gammona* man, and
after recovery his body is painted white, the hair-string girdle and the
pubic tassel are put on, he is brought up to the men's camp and then
taken on to where, close to the *Erlukwirra*, the women are waiting. The
throwing of a boomerang, the meeting between the boy and his
*Ungaraitcha*, when the latter hit him on the back, and the smoking of
the novice are carried out in essentially the same way as already
described. When all this is over, the novice returns with the men to
their camp, and during the night a ceremony concerned with the owl totem
is always performed; why this is so we have not been able to discover.
For some time the newly initiated man may not speak to any of the men or
women who have taken part as officials in any of the ceremonies, but, as
previously described, the ban of silence is ultimately removed after he
has presented to each one separately an offering of food.

In regard to the initiation ceremonies of women, it is clear that, as
was first shown by Roth, there are certain ceremonies which are
evidently the equivalents of the initiation ceremonies concerned with
the men. Such ceremonies occur, though not to such an extent as
described by Mr. Roth, in the Central tribes. The first one takes place
when the girl's breasts are rubbed with fat and red ochre, and the
second, when the operation of opening the vagina is performed. This is
clearly regarded as the equivalent of sub-incision in the male, the name
of the latter ceremony being *pura ariltha kuma*, while in the case of
the woman it is called *atna ariltha kuma*. There is no special name
given to a female after any initiation rite. Up to the first menstrual
period she is called *quiai*, the ordinary name for a girl, just as
*wiai* is the ordinary name for a boy; after that she is called *wunpa*,
a name which she retains until the breasts hang pendent, after which she
is called *arakutja*, the ordinary term for a grown woman. The first
ceremony may perhaps be regarded as the equivalent of the throwing up
and painting of the boys, there being amongst the women no equivalents
of the *Lartna* (circumcision) or Engwura ceremonies of the men.

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

We have described the ceremonies attendant on what may be called the
initiation of women, the first in connection with other ceremonies
peculiar to women, <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md) the second in
the chapter dealing with the social organisation, as it has important
bearings upon this, and may be most conveniently dealt with in
connection therewith.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[220:3](ntca09.htm#fr_107.md) If the boy had had
an *Unjipinna* man, that is an *Umbirna* who had waived his right to the
boy's sister as wife, then it would have been the duty of this man to
tie the hair up.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[221:1](ntca09.htm#fr_108.md) In using these terms
we include, unless specially stated to the contrary, tribal as well as
blood relations; the *Oknia*, for example, include the actual father and
also the father's brothers.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[222:1](ntca09.htm#fr_109.md) The handing of the
firestick is called *Unchalkulkna*, and the fire is regarded as being of
a sacred character.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[224:1](ntca09.htm#fr_110.md) In the southern part
of the tribe the tradition is that an aged woman, angry because of the
number of boys who were killed in consequence of the use of a fire-stick
for circumcision, showed the men how to use a stone knife.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[225:1](ntca09.htm#fr_111.md) For a description of
this, see page [231](#page_231.md) *sq*.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[234:1](ntca09.htm#fr_112.md) In the southern part
of the Arunta the *Waninga* is used in this way during the ceremony of
*Lartna*, but neither a *Waninga* nor a *Nurtunja* is used at the
ceremony of sub-incision; in the central and western part of the Arunta
a *Waninga* is used at circumcision and a *Nurtunja* at sub-incision,
and in the northern part of the Arunta and in the Ilpirra tribe neither
of them is used at circumcision, but a *Nurtunja* at sub-incision.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[244:1](ntca09.htm#fr_113.md) The *Ipmunna* men
and women belong to the sub-class into which the novice's children will
pass.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[244:2](ntca09.htm#fr_114.md) Roth describes the
brake of boughs used during the ceremony, and called *errulli*, as being
burnt at the close of the proceedings, *loc. cit.*, p. 171.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[246:1](ntca09.htm#fr_115.md) The sound of the
bull-roarer is believed by the women to be the voice of the spirit
*Twanyirika*, who has taken the boy away from them into the bush. This
spirit, they are told, lives in wild and inaccessible regions, and only
comes out when a youth is initiated. He enters the body of the boy after
the operation and takes him away into the bush until he is better, when
the spirit goes away and the boy returns, but now as an initiated man.
Both uninitiated youths and women are taught to believe in the existence
of *Twanyirika*. This belief is fundamentally the same as that found in
all Australian tribes. Amongst the Kurnai, for example, as related by
Mr. Howitt, the sound of the bull-roarer is the voice of *Tundun*, who
himself comes down to make the boys into men. Amongst certain other
tribes of the south-east coast *Daramulun's* voice is heard when the
bull-roarer sounds, and he it is who initiates the youths by knocking
out a tooth. In many tribes, such as the Kurnai, two bull-roarers, as
described by Mr. Howitt, are sounded, a larger and a smaller one, the
latter representing *Tundun's* wife, but amongst the Arunta, Ilpira and
Luritcha there is only one, and that represents the male spirit.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[248:1](ntca09.htm#fr_116.md) After this the
novice must use these terms in addressing these special individuals,
though he may not speak to any one of them until such time as he shall
have made him an offering of food.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[256:1](ntca09.htm#fr_117.md) As a result of the
operation of *Ariltha-kuma*, micturition is always, in the native state,
performed in a squatting position, and it is a very characteristic
action for a little hollow to be scooped out with the hand in the soil,
and then into this micturition takes place.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[263:2](ntca09.htm#fr_119.md) Mr. A. Morton, who
