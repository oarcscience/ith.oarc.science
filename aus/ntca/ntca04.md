THE fundamental feature in the organisation of the Central Australian,
as in that of other Australian tribes, is the division of the tribe into
two exogamous inter-marrying groups. These two divisions may become
further broken up, but even when more than two are now present we can
still recognise their former existence.

In consequence of, and intimately associated with, this division of the
tribe, there has been developed a series of terms of relationship
indicating the relative status of the various members of the tribe, and,
of necessity, as the division becomes more complex so do the terms of
relationship.

In the tribes with which we are dealing we can recognise at least two
important types which illustrate different grades in the development of
the social organisation. The first of these is found in the Urabunna
tribe, the second in the Arunta, Ilpirra, Kaitish, Waagai, Warramunga,
Iliaura, and Bingongina tribes.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

The less complex the organisation of the tribe the more clearly do we
see evidence of what Messrs. Howitt and Fison have called, in regard to
Australian tribes, “group marriage.” Under certain modifications this
still exists as an actual custom, regulated by fixed and well-recognised
rules, amongst various Australian tribes, whilst in others the terms of
relationship indicate, without doubt, its former existence. As is well
known, Mr. McLennan held that the terms must have been invented by the
natives using them merely for the purpose of addressing each other or as
modes of salutation. To those who have been amongst and watched the
natives day after day, this explanation of the terms is utterly
unsatisfactory. When, in various tribes, we find series of terms of
relationship all dependent upon classificatory systems such as those now
to be described, and referring entirely to a mutual relationship such as
would be brought about by their existence, we cannot do otherwise than
come to the conclusion that the terms do actually indicate various
degrees of relationship based primarily upon the existence of
inter-marrying groups. When we find, for example, that amongst the
Arunta natives a man calls a large number of men belonging to one
particular group by the name “*Oknia*” (a term which includes our
relationship of father), that he calls all the wives of these men by the
common name of “*Mia*” (mother), <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) and
that he calls all their sons by the name of “*Okilia*” (elder brother)
or “*Itia*” (younger brother), as the case may be, we can come to no
other conclusion than that this is expressive of his recognition of what
may be called a group relationship. All the “fathers” are men who belong
to the particular group to which his own actual father belongs; all the
“mothers” belong to the same group as that to which his actual mother
belongs, and all the “brothers” belong to his own group.

Whatever else they may be, the relationship terms are certainly not
terms of address, the object of which is to prevent the native having to
employ a personal name. In the Arunta tribe, for example, every man and
woman has a

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

personal name by which he or she is freely addressed by others—that is,
by any, except a member of the opposite sex who stands in the
relationship of “*Mura*” to them, for such may only on very rare
occasions speak to one another. <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md)
When, as has happened time after time to us, a native says, for example,
“That man is Oriaka (a personal name), he is my *Okilia*,” and you
cannot possibly tell without further inquiry whether he is the speaker's
blood or tribal brother—that is, the son of his own father or of some
man belonging to the same particular group as his father—then the idea
that the term “*Okilia*” is applied as a polite term of address, or in
order to avoid the necessity of using a personal name, is at once seen
to be untenable.

It is, at all events, a remarkable fact that (apart from the
organisation of other tribes, in respect of which we are not competent
to speak, but for which the same fact is vouched for by other observers)
in all the tribes with which we are acquainted, all the terms coincide,
without any exception, in the recognition of relationships, all of which
are dependent upon the existence of a classificatory system, the
fundamental idea of which is that the women of certain groups marry the
men of others. Each tribe has one term applied indiscriminately by the
man to the woman or women whom he actually marries and to all the women
whom he might lawfully marry—that is, who belong to the right group—one
term to his actual mother and to all the women whom his father might
lawfully have married; one term to his actual brother and to all the
sons of his father's brothers, and so on right through

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

the whole system. To this it may be added that, if these be not terms of
relationship, then the language of these tribes is absolutely devoid of
any such. <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md)

A great part of the difficulty in understanding these terms lies in the
fact that we have amongst ourselves no terms which convey the same idea
of relationship as do those of savage peoples. When once, for example,
the term “*Mia*,” used amongst the Arunta tribe, has been translated by
the English term “mother,” an entirely wrong impression is apt to to
conveyed. *Mia* does include the relationship which we call mother, but
it includes a great deal more, and to the Arunta native the restriction
of the term as used in English is as incomprehensible as apparently the
extension of the term is to white men who are not accustomed to the
native use. To understand the native it is simply essential to lay aside
all ideas of relationship as counted amongst ourselves. They have no
words equivalent to our English words father, mother, brother, &c. A
man, for example, will call his actual mother “*Mia*,” but, at the same
time, he will apply the term not only to other grown women, but to a
little girl child, provided they all belong to the same group. We have,
for example, asked a fully grown man who the little child was with whom
he was playing, and have received the answer that it was so and so,
mentioning her personal name, and that she was his *Mia*. Her own
personal name he would use in speaking both to her and to us, but the
term *Mia* expressed the relationship in which she stood to him.

We have dwelt somewhat at length upon this because so distinguished a
writer as Mr. McLennan and others who, accepting his dictum, have dealt
with the subject, have attempted to disprove the supposition that any
such group relationship is actually expressed in the terms of
relationship used by the Australian natives. For this reason we have, as

/p&gt;

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

carefully and minutely as possible, and without prejudice in favour of
one theory or the other, examined into the social organisation of the
tribes with which we have come into contact. The conclusion to which we
have come is that we do not see how the facts, which will now be
detailed and upon a consideration of which this conclusion is based, can
receive any satisfactory explanation except on the theory of the former
existence of group marriage, and further, that this has of necessity
given rise to the terms of relationship used by the Australian natives.
As will be seen, group marriage, in a modified but yet most unmistakable
way, occurs as an actual system in one of the tribes with which we are
dealing.

We may now pass on to consider first the organisation of the Urabunna
tribe, as this represents a less complex condition than the second type
which is met with in the Arunta and other tribes.

In reference to the names to apply to the various divisions of the
tribe, we have felt considerable difficulty, and have decided that as
such terms as phratry, gens, clan, &c., have all of them a definite
significance, and, as applied to Australian tribes, may be misleading,
it is better to use the term class as applying to the two main exogamous
intermarrying groups, each of which forms a moiety of the tribe, and the
term sub-class as applying to the divisions of the class. We therefore
use these terms with this significance. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md)

The Urabunna organisation appears to be, if not identical with, at least
very closely similar to, that of the Dieri tribe, whose territory
adjoins it on the south, and which has been dealt with previously by Mr.
Howitt <span id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md) The whole tribe is

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

divided up into two exogamous intermarrying classes, which are
respectively called Matthurie and Kirarawa, and the members of each of
these again are divided into a series of totemic groups, for which the
native name is *Thunthunnie*. A Matthurie man must marry a Kirarawa
woman, and not only this, but a man of one totem must marry a woman of
another totem, certain totems being confined to each of the exogamous
classes. Thus a dingo marries a waterhen, a cicada a crow, an emu a rat,
a wild turkey a cloud, a swan a pelican, and so on. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md)

The organisation can be shown as represented in the following table,
only a limited number of the totems being indicated:—

Descent is counted through the mother, both as regards class and totem,
so that we can represent marriage and descent as counted in the Urabunna
tribe by the following

male.

There are still further restrictions to marriage than those which merely
enact that a dingo man must marry a water-hen woman, and it is here that
we are brought into contact with the terms of relationship. Enquiring
into case after case you meet constantly, in this matter of restriction
in regard to marriage, with the reply that though a particular woman
belongs to the right totem into which a man must marry, yet there is a
further restriction preventing marriage in this particular case. For
example, not every dingo may marry a particular water-hen woman. To a
dingo man all water-hen women are divided into four groups, the members
of which respectively stand to him in the relationship of (1) *Nowillie*
or father's sisters; (2) *Biaka*, children or brothers' children; (3)
*Apillia*, mother's younger brothers' daughters; (4) *Nupa*, mother's
elder brothers' daughters. It will of course be understood that a
mother's brother's child is identical with a father's sister's child,
and that the fathers and brothers may be either blood or tribal.

We can, amongst the individuals named, distinguish women of three
different levels of generation; the *Nowillie* belong to that of the
father and to still older generations; the *Biaka* to younger ones and
the *Apillia* and *Nupa* to the same generation as the individual
concerned. A man can only marry women who stand to him in the
relationship of *Nupa*, that is, are the children of his mother's elder
brothers blood or tribal, or, what is the same thing, of his father's
elder sisters. The mother of a man's *Nupa* is *Nowillie* to him, and
any woman of that relationship is *Mura* to him and he to her, and they
must not speak to one another. In connection with this it <span
id="page_62">p. 62</span> must be remembered that it is not necessary
for the woman to actually have a daughter for her to be *Nowillie* and
so *Mura* to the man, the very fact that she was born a sister of his
father places her in this relationship. In the same way *Nupa*, the term
applied to a woman with whom it is lawful for a man to have marital
relations, and which is thus the term applied to a wife, cannot,
strictly speaking, be regarded as at all the equivalent of the latter
term. It is applied indiscriminately by a dingo man to each and every
member of a group of water-hen women with one or more of whom he may
perhaps actually have marital relations, but with any one of whom it is
lawful and possible for him to do so. When we say possible for him to
have such marital relations, we mean that any one of those women might
be assigned to him, as they all, in fact, stand to him in the
relationship of potential wives.

The word *Nupa* is without any exception applied indiscriminately by men
of a particular group to women of another group, and *vice versa*, and
simply implies a member of a group of possible wives or husbands as the
case may be.

While this is so, it must be remembered that in actual practice each
individual man has one or perhaps two of these *Nupa* women who are
specially attached to himself and live with him in his own camp. In
addition to them, however, each man has certain *Nupa* women, beyond the
limited number just referred to, with whom he stands in the relationship
of *Piraungaru*. <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) To women who are
the *Piraungaru* of a man (the term is a reciprocal one), the latter has
access under certain conditions, so that they may be considered as
accessory wives.

The result is that in the Urabunna tribe every woman is the special
*Nupa* of one particular man, but at the same time he has no exclusive
right to her as she is the *Piraungaru* of certain other men who also
have the right of access to her. Looked at from the point of view of the
man his *Piraungaru* are a limited number of the women who stand in the
relationship of *Nupa* to him. There is no such thing as one man

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

having the exclusive right to one woman; the elder brothers, or
*Nuthie*, of the latter, in whose hands the matter lies, will give one
man a preferential right, but at the same time they will give other men
of the same group a secondary right to her. Individual marriage does not
exist either in name or in practice in the Urabunna tribe.

The initiation in regard to establishing the relationship of
*Piraungaru* between a man and a woman must be taken by the elder
brothers, but the arrangement must receive the sanction of the old men
of the group before it can take effect. As a matter of actual practice,
this relationship is usually established at times when considerable
numbers of the tribe are gathered together to perform important
ceremonies, and when these and other matters of importance which require
the consideration of the old men are discussed and settled. The number
of a man's *Piraungaru* depend entirely upon the measure of his power
and popularity; if he be what is called “*ūrkū*,” a word which implies
much the same as our word “influential,” he will have a considerable
number, if he be insignificant or unpopular, then he will meet with
scanty treatment.

A woman may be *Piraungaru* to a number of men, and as a general rule
men and women who are *Piraungaru* to one another are to be found living
grouped together. A man may always lend his wife, that is, the woman to
whom he has the first right, to another man, provided always he be her
*Nupa*, without the relationship of *Piraungaru* existing between the
two, but unless this relationship exists, no man has any right of access
to a woman. Occasionally, but rarely, it happens that a man attempts to
prevent his wife's *Piraungaru* from having access to her, but this
leads to a fight and the husband is looked upon as churlish. When
visiting distant groups where, in all likelihood, the husband has no
*Piraungaru*, it is customary for other men of his own class to offer
him the loan of one or more of their *Nupa* women, and a man, besides
lending a woman over whom he has the first right, will also lend his
*Piraungaru*.

All the children of women who are *Nupa* to any man, whether they are
his special *Nupas*, or *Piraungaru*, or *Nupa* <span id="page_64">p.
64</span> women with whom he has no marital relations, call him *Nia*,
and he calls them *Biaka*. Whilst naturally there is a closer tie
between a man and the children of the women who habitually live in camp
with him, still there is no name to distinguish between the children of
his special *Nupa* and those of any other woman to whom he is *Nupa*,
but with whom he has no marital relations. All *Biaka*, or children of
men who are at the same level in the generation and belong to the same
class and totem, are regarded as the common children of these men, and
in the same way the latter are regarded collectively by the *Biaka* as
their *Nia*.

It will thus be seen that in the Urabunna tribe we have apparently an
organisation closely similar to that described by Mr. Howitt as
occurring in the Dieri tribe with which it is associated locally. It
will also be evident that in both these tribes there is what can only be
described as a modified form of group-marriage, the important features
of which may be summarised as follows. We have:—

\(1\) A group of men all of whom belong to one moiety of the tribe who
are regarded as the *Nupas* or possible husbands of a group of women who
belong to the other moiety of the tribe.

\(2\) One or more women specially allotted to one particular man, each
standing in the relationship of *Nupa* to the other, but no man having
exclusive right to any one woman, only a preferential right.

\(3\) A group of men who stand in the relationship of *Piraungaru* to a
group of women selected from amongst those to whom they are *Nupa*. In
other words, a group of women of a certain designation are actually the
wives of a group of men of another designation.

A curious feature in the social organisation of the Urabunna tribe is
the restriction in accordance with which a man's wife must belong to
what we may call the senior side of the tribe so far as he himself is
concerned. He is only *Nupa* to the female children of the elder
brothers of his mother, or what is exactly the same thing, to those of
the elder sisters of his father. It follows from this that a woman is
only *Nupa* to men on the junior side of the tribe so far as she is
concerned. <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> This marked distinction
between elder and younger brothers and sisters is a striking feature,
not only in tribes such as the Urabunna, in which descent is counted in
the female line, but also in tribes such as the Arunta in which descent
is counted in the male line.

If we draw up a genealogical tree in the Urabunna tribe, placing the
elder members on the left side and the younger members on the right
side, then every woman's *Nupa* lies to the right, and every man's to
the left side of his or her position in the genealogical tree.

The following table gives the terms of relationship as they exist
amongst the Urabunna tribe. It will be seen that we have given three
columns of names, (1) the native names, (2) the exact equivalent of the
native names in our English terms, and (3) the English terms included
wholly or partly in the native terms. In this way it will be seen, for
example, that there are no native words at all equivalent to our English
terms cousin, uncle, aunt, nephew; in fact, as we have said before,
unless all ideas of terms of relationship as counted amongst ourselves
be abandoned, it is useless to try and understand the native terms. No
native can understand how we can possibly apply the same term cousin to
children of the brothers of a father and at the same time to children of
the sisters of a father. In the same way it will be seen that a
brother's children are perfectly distinct from those of a sister; if I
am, say a crow man, then my brothers' children are born cicadas and my
sisters' children are born crows. As my own children are cicadas, I
naturally have a term in common between them and the cicada offspring of
my brothers, and quite a different term for the crow children of my
sisters.

It will be seen on examining the table that no man or woman applies the
same name to, for example, both a crow and a cicada, and further still,
that all the names are applied to groups of individuals all of whom
stand in a definite relationship to the individual by whom the term is
used.

In addition to the table we have also drawn up a genealogical tree which
will perhaps aid in explaining what is without doubt a somewhat
intricate subject, and in the table we have numbered each individual,
and taking a particular individual have represented in tabular form the
names

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

which he applies to the other members of the group so as to include and
illustrate all the various terms as used. <span

It may perhaps be wondered how the natives themselves become acquainted
with what is to the average white man so apparently elaborate and even,
at first sight, complicated, a scheme. In the first place it is not in
reality so complicated as it appears, and if we lay aside all
pre-conceived ideas of relationship and remember that the terms are
constantly being used by the natives who live, so to speak, surrounded
with object lessons in the form of the members of the local group, then
the difficulty largely vanishes. Another thing to be remembered is that
the relationship of one native to another is one of the most important
points with which each individual must be acquainted. There are certain
customs which are enforced by long usage and according to which <span
id="page_68">p. 68</span> men and women of particular degrees of
relationship may alone have marital relations, or may not speak to one
another, or according to which one individual has to do certain things
for another, such as providing the latter with food or with hair, as the
case may be, and any breach of these customs is severely punished. The
elder men of each group very carefully keep alive these customs, many of
which are of considerable benefit to themselves, and when, as at any
important ceremony, different groups are gathered together, then matters
such as these are discussed, and in this way a knowledge of the various
relationships is both gained and kept alive. When a man comes from a
distant group, unless he be well known to the group into which he has
come, the old men talk the matter over and very soon decide as to his
standing.

It sometimes happens, in fact not infrequently, that a man from the
neighbouring Arunta tribe comes to live amongst the Urabunna. In the
former where it adjoins the latter there are four sub-classes, viz.,
Bulthara and Panunga, Kumara, and Purula, and in addition descent is
counted in the male line. Accordingly the men of the Bulthara and Purula
classes are regarded as the equivalents of the Matthurie moiety of the
Urabunna tribe, and those of the Panunga and Kumara classes as the
equivalents of the Kirarawa. In just the same way a Matthurie man going
into the Arunta tribe becomes either a Bulthara or Purula, and a
Kirarawa man becomes either a Panunga or a Kumara man. Which of the two
a Matthurie man belongs to, is decided by the old men of the group into
which he goes. Sometimes a man will take up his abode permanently, or
for a long time, amongst the strange tribe, in which case, if it be
decided, for example, that he is a Bulthara, then his children will be
born Panunga, that is they belong to his own adopted moiety. He has, of
course, to marry a Kumara woman, or if he be already provided with a
wife, then she is regarded as a Kumara, and if he goes back into his own
tribe then his wife is regarded as a Kirarawa and the children also take
the same name.

This deliberate change in the grouping of the classes and sub-classes so
as to make them fit in with the maternal line <span id="page_69">p.
69</span> of descent or with the paternal, as the case may be, will be
more easily understood from the accompanying table.

<div align="center">

| Kumara    | moiety B | Panunga                                           | moiety B (Kirarawa).  |

The working out of this with the result that the children belong to the
right moiety of the tribe into which the man has gone may be rendered
clear by taking one or two particular examples.

Suppose that a Matthurie man goes into the Arunta tribe, then he is told
by the old men of the group into which he has gone that he is, say, a
Bulthara. Accordingly he marries a Kumara woman (or if, which is not
very likely, he has brought a woman with him, then she is regarded as a
Kumara) and his children will be Panunga, or, in other words, pass into
the father's moiety as the sub-classes are arranged in the Arunta, but
not into that of the mother as they are arranged amongst the Urabunna.

Again, suppose a Purula man from the Arunta tribe takes up his abode
amongst the Urabunna. He becomes a Matthurie, and as such must marry a
Kirarawa (or if married his wife is regarded as such). His children are
Kirarawa, which includes the sub-class Kumara into which they would have
passed in the Arunta tribe, and to which they will belong if ever they
go into the latter.

These are not merely hypothetical cases but are, in the district where
the two tribes come in contact with one another, of by no means
infrequent occurrence; and, without laying undue stress upon the matter,
this deliberate changing of the method of grouping the sub-classes so as
to allow of the descent being counted in either the male or female line
according to the necessity of the case, is of interest as indicating the
fact that the natives are quite capable of thinking such things out for
themselves. It is indeed not perhaps without a certain suggestiveness in
regard to the difficult question of how a change in the line of descent
might possibly be brought about.

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

We may now turn to the consideration of the Arunta tribe in which
descent is counted in the male line, and we may regard the Arunta as
typical of the large group of tribes inhabiting the centre of the
continent from Lake Eyre in the south to near Port Darwin in the north,
in which descent is thus counted. The tribes with the classificatory
systems of which we have knowledge are the Arunta, Ilpirra, Iliaura,
Kaitish, Walpari, Warramunga, Waagai, and Bingongina, which occupy a
range of country extending from the latitude of Macumba River in the
south to about that of Powell's Creek in the north, that is over an area
measuring from north to south some seven hundred and seventy miles (Fig.
1).

In regard to the organisation of the Arunta tribe, with which we shall
now deal in detail, it may at the outset be mentioned that the existence
of four sub-classes in the southern part of the tribe, and of eight in
the northern, appears at first sight to indicate that in the latter the
organisation is more complex. In reality, though without having distinct
names applied to them, each one of the four sub-classes met with in the
south is actually divided into two. The four are Panunga and Bulthara,
Purula and Kumara; the first two forming one moiety of the tribe, and
the latter two forming another. In camp, for example, the Panunga and
Bulthara always camp together separated from the Purula and Kumara by
some natural feature such as a creek. The Panunga and Bulthara speak of
themselves as *Nakrakia*, and of the Purula and Kumara as
*Mulyanuka*—the terms being reciprocal. Further details with regard to
this, and evidence of this division into two moieties, are given in
connection with the discussion of the Churinga and totems, and in the
account of the Engwura.

The marriage system is, in broad outline, omitting at present certain
details which will be referred to shortly, as follows. A Bulthara man
marries a Kumara woman and their children are Panunga; a Purula man
marries a Panunga woman and their children are Kumara; a Panunga man
marries a Purula woman and their children are Bulthara; a Kumara man
marries a Bulthara woman and their children are Purula.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

This may be graphically expressed following Mr. Howitt's plan (as
already done by Dr. Stirling) in the following way. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md)

<div align="center">

In these diagrams the double arrow indicates the marriage connections
and the single ones point to the name of the class of the children.

As a matter of fact these diagrams as they stand, though perfectly
correct in stating, for example, that a Panunga man marries a Purula
woman, are incomplete in that they do not show the important point that
to a Panunga man the Purula women are divided into two groups the
members of one of whom stand to him in the relationship of *Unawa* whom
he may marry, while the members of the other stand in the relationship
of *Unkulla* whom he may not marry. This fact is one of very
considerable importance. Each of the four sub-classes is thus divided
into two, the members of which stand respectively in the relationship of
*Ipmunna* to each other. We can represent this graphically as follows,
taking, for the sake of simplicity, only two sub-classes, the divisions
of one being represented by the letters A and B, and of the other by the
letters C and D.

<div align="center">

|                        |             |             |              |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
|                        |             |             |              |
| (Unclear:)*Sub-class*. | *Division*. | *Division*. | *Sub-class*. |
| Panunga                | A           | C           | Purula       |
|                        | B           | D           |              |

</div>

 

A stands in the relationship of *Unawa* to C, *Ipmunna* to B, and
*Unkulla* to D. In other words a woman who is *Unkulla* to me is
*Ipmunna* to my wife. All women of group C (myself belonging to A), my
wife calls sisters—*Ungaraitcha* if they be elder sisters, and *Itia* if
they be younger sisters; and all of <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> them
stand in the relationship of *Unawa* to myself; but the other Purula
women whom my wife calls *Ipmunna* are *Unkulla* to me and I may not
marry them.

It is somewhat perplexing after learning that a Panunga man must marry a
Purula woman to meet with the statement, when inquiring into particular
cases, that a given Panunga man must not marry a particular Purula
woman, but in the northern part of the tribe matters are simplified by
the existence of distinct names for the two groups; the relationship
term of *Ipmunna* still exists, but if I am, for example, a Panunga man,
then all my *Ipmunna* men and women are designated by the term
*Uknaria*, and in the following tables the eight divisions are laid
down, and it will be noticed that the old name is used for one-half and
a new name adopted for the other.

<div align="center">

|                   |            |            |        |
|-------------------|------------|------------|--------|
| (Unclear:)Panunga | Panunga    | Purula     | Purula |
|                   | Uknaria    | Ungalla    |        |
| Bulthara          | Bulthara   | Kumara     | Kumara |
|                   | Appungerta | Umbitchana |        |

</div>

 

The double arrows indicate the marriage connections.

This division into eight has been adopted (or rather the names for the
four new divisions have been), in recent times by the Arunta tribe from
the Ilpirra tribe which adjoins the former on the north, and the use of
them is, at the present time, spreading southwards. At the Engwura
ceremony which we witnessed men of the Ilpirra tribe were present, as
well as a large number of others from the southern part of the Arunta
amongst whom the four new names are not yet in use.

We have found the following table of considerable service to ourselves
in working as, by its means, the various relationships fall into regular
arrangement and can be readily indicated.

<div align="center">

|            |            |            |            |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1          | 2          | 3          | 4          |
| Panunga    | Purula     | Appungerta | Kumara     |
| Uknaria    | Ungalla    | Bulthara   | Umbitchana |
| Bulthara   | Kumara     | Uknaria    | Purula     |
| Appungerta | Umbitchana | Panunga    | Ungalla    |

</div>

 

This table was drawn up in the first instance in order to show the
marriage relationships and the divisions into which <span
id="page_73">p. 73</span> the children pass. Thus, reading across the
page, men of the sub-classes shown in column 1 must marry women of the
sub-classes shown in column 2. For example, a Panunga man marries a
Purula woman, an Uknaria man an Ungalla woman, and so on. Column 3 in
the same way indicates their children, those of a Panunga man and a
Purula woman being Appungerta, those of an Uknaria man and an Ungalla
woman being Bulthara, &c. In the same way if a man of one of the
sub-classes in column 2 marries a woman in one of those in column 1,
then their children are as represented in column 4. That is, a Purula
man marries a Panunga woman and their children are Kumara, and so on.

When, however, we came to deal with the various terms of relationship
used in the tribe, we found that they also fell into orderly arrangement
in the table, and could be easily shown by means of it.

It will be seen from the table that, as compared with the Urabunna
tribe, marriage appears to be very much more restricted, because a man
may only marry a woman who belongs to one of eight divisions into which
the whole is divided. In the Arunta tribe, however, as will be described
in the chapter dealing with the totems, there is, unlike most Australian
tribes, no restriction whatever, so far as the totems are concerned. It
may therefore be, perhaps, a matter of doubt as to how far the totems of
the Arunta are the exact equivalents of those yet described as existing
amongst other Australian tribes. Every Arunta native thinks that his
ancestor in the Alcheringa <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md) was the
descendant of the animal or plant, or at least was immediately
associated with the object the name of which he bears as his totemic
name. In many Australian tribes it seems to be a general custom that a
man must not eat or injure his totem, whereas amongst the Arunta there
are special occasions on which the totem is eaten, and there is no rule
absolutely forbidding the eating of the totem at other times, though it
is clearly understood that it must only be partaken of very sparingly.
However, though the totems of the Arunta are in certain respects

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

unlike those yet described in other Australian tribes, still there can
be no doubt but that they are correctly designated by this name, the
most important feature in which they differ from those of other parts of
Australia being that they have no reference to customs concerning
marriage.

In the Arunta tribe, unlike the Urabunna, there is, as soon as marriage
has taken place, a restriction, except on certain special occasions
which are subsequently described, of a particular woman to a particular
man, or rather, a man has an exclusive right to one special woman though
he may of his own free will lend her to other men.

Despite this fact, there is no term applied to a woman who is thus the
peculiar property of one man, the woman is simply spoken of as *Unawa*
to the man in just the same way in which all the other women are who
belong to the group from which the man's wife must come. The terms of
relationship are not individual terms, but, just as in the Urabunna and
other tribes in some of which we have a form of group marriage existing
as an actual institution at the present day, the terms are group terms.
To take an example—a Panunga man will have some special woman allotted
to him as an individual wife, but the only term which he applies to her
is *Unawa*, and that term he also applies to all the women of her group,
each of whom might lawfully have been allotted to him. She is one out of
a group of potential wives. When, again, a man lends his wife, he only
does so to a member of his own group, that is to a man to whom, without
having been allotted to him, the woman stands in the relationship of
*Unawa* just as she does to the man to whom she has been allotted. In
the southern part of the tribe, where only the four divisions exist, a
Panunga man will not lend his *Unawa* to a man who belongs to the half
of the Panunga to which he himself does not belong, that is he will not
lend her to an *Ipmunna* man but only to men who are *Okilia* or *Itia*
to him; and in the same way he will only have lent to him a Purula woman
to whom he is *Unawa* and not one to whom he is *Unkulla*. In the
northern division the original Panunga is divided up into Panunga and
Ungalla, and here a Panunga man only lends his wife to a Panunga, an
Ungalla to an <span id="page_75">p. 75</span> Ungalla, and so on. In
this northern part in must be remembered that the Panunga men are the
exact equivalents to another Panunga man of the *Okilia* and *Itia*,
that is the tribal brothers of the southern part, while the Ungalla
correspond to the *Ipmunna*.

The same group terms are applied in all other cases. Thus a man calls
his own children *Allira*, and applies the same term to all his blood
and tribal brothers' children, while all his sisters' children are
*Umba*. If, again, I am a Panunga man, then my wife is Purula, and her
actual father is a Kumara man. Not only do I call this particular man
*Ikuntera* or father-in-law, but, where the eight divisions are in
force, I apply the same name to all Kumara men. They are one and all the
fathers of women whom it is lawful for me to marry.

That this group relationship is actually recognised is made clear by a
variety of facts. If, for example, one of my *Ikuntera* dies, it is my
duty to cut my shoulders with a stone knife as a mark of sorrow. If I
neglect to do this, then any one of the men who are *Ikuntera* to me has
the right to take away my wife and give her to some other man to whom
she is *Unawa*. I have not only, supposing it to be the actual father of
my wife who has died, neglected to do my duty to him, but I have
offended the group collectively, and any member of that group may punish
me. Again, if I am out hunting and have caught game, and while carrying
this home to my camp I chance to meet a man standing to me in the
relationship of *Ikuntera*, I should at once have to drop the food,
which, from the fact of its having been seen by any one member of that
group, has become tabu to me.

In just the same way amongst the women we see clear instances of customs
founded on the existence of group relationship. When a child dies not
only does the actual *Mia*, or mother, cut herself, but all the sisters
of the latter, who also are *Mia* to the dead child, cut themselves. All
women call their own children *Umba*, and apply precisely the same term
to the children of their sisters, blood and tribal.

The tables which follow give the terms of relationship existing amongst
the Arunta, Luritcha, Kaitish and Warramunga, <span id="page_76">p.
76</span> and, in the case of the Arunta, we have drawn up a
genealogical tree and, taking a man and his alloted *Unawa*, have
arranged in tabular form the various terms which they respectively apply
to other individuals, whose relationship to them can be seen on the
tree.

For the purpose of comparison we have made the genealogical tree
identical with that used in the case of the Urabunna tribe, the
individuals being numbered alike on both trees.

If we take the man numbered 25 on the genealogical tree, which, it may
be said, applies to both the Ilpirra and Arunta tribes, with slight
variation in the names, we shall find that he applies the following
names to the individuals indicated by their respective numbers. It will
be noticed that two small branch lines are added to show descent in the
maternal line.

The man numbered 25 applies the following names to the various

A comparison of the terms of relationship here set forth with those in
use amongst other tribes, which have been described by Messrs. Howitt
and Fison, and more recently and in most valuable detail by Mr. Roth,
will serve to show how widely a similar series of terms is in use
amongst the various Australian tribes.

We will further exemplify the system by taking a man of one particular
group and describe in detail the various relationships which exist
between him and other members of the tribe. These and all details given
have been derived from various individuals and families, and have been
corroborated time after time.

After ascertaining the various relationships we found that they could be
represented graphically and in orderly arrangement by means of the table
already employed, and, as we have found this table of the greatest
service to ourselves in dealing with this somewhat intricate subject, we
will make use of it here.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<div align="center">

|                   |            |            |            |
|-------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| TABLE I.          |            |            |            |
| 1                 | 2          | 3          | 4          |
| (Unclear:)Panunga | Purula     | Appungerta | Kumara     |
| Uknaria           | Ungalla    | Bulthara   | Umbitchana |
| Bulthara          | Kumara     | Uknaria    | Purula     |
| Appungerta        | Umbitchana | Panunga    | Ungalla    |

</div>

 

The brackets signify groups, the members of which are mutually *Ipmunna*
to each other.

Column 3 are the children of men of column 1 and of women of column 2.
This applies to groups on the same horizontal line in the table. Thus an
Appungerta is the child of a Panunga man and a Purula woman; a Panunga
is the child of an Appungerta man and an Umbitchana woman. The same
remark applies to all the other relationships indicated; thus a Panunga
man is *Gammona* to a Kumara.

Column 4 are the children of men of column 2 and of the women of column
1.

A man of column 1 is *Unawa* to a woman of column 2 and *vice versa*,
and *Umbirna* to a man of column 2. A woman of column 2 is *Intinga* to
a woman of column 1, and *vice versa*.

Column 1 contains men who are *Gammona* of men and women of column 4.

Column 4 contains men who are *Ikuntera* or *Umba* of men, and *Nimmera*
of women, of column 1.

Column 2 contains men who are *Gammona* of men and women of column 3.

Column 3 contains men who are *Ikuntera* or *Umba* of men, and *Nimmera*
of women, of column 2.

Men and women of columns 3 and 4 stand mutually in the relationship of
*Unkulla* or *Chimmia*.

Women of columns 3 and 4 stand mutually in the relationship of
*Ilchella*.

In column 1 the larger and smaller brackets on the right side indicate
the relationship of *Uwinna*, the overlapping <span id="page_84">p.
84</span> brackets on the left indicate that of *Mura*. In column 4 the
reverse holds true, the brackets on the left indicate the relationship
of *Uwinna*, and those on the right side that of *Mura*.

Taking now the case of an individual member of a particular group, we
may describe as follows the various relationships in which he stands
with regard to the other members of the tribe. We will suppose that this
particular individual is an Appungerta man living in the northern part
of the tribe where the division into eight groups exists, and we will
suppose him to be speaking—

If I am an Appungerta man then—

My father is a Panunga.

All Uknaria are *Ipmunna* to him and *Mura* to me—that is, I may not
speak to them if they be women. The daughters of Ungalla men and Uknaria
women are Umbitchana and *Unawa* to me—that is, they are women whom I
may lawfully marry, and one or more of whom are allotted to me as wives.
The mother of the woman who is allotted to me is my *Tualcha-mura*.

The sons of Uknaria women, that is the brothers of my *Unawa*, are
*Umbirna* to me; so that Umbitchana men are *Umbirna* to Appungerta men,
and *vice versa*.

I call my father *Oknia*.

All men whom my father calls *Okilia*, elder brothers, or *Witia*,
younger brother, are Panunga, and they are *Oknia* to me. I call his
*Okilia, Oknia aniaura*, and his *Itia, Oknia alkulla*.

My *Oknia's* sisters are Panunga, and they are *Uwinna* to me. That is,
Panunga women are *Uwinna* to Appungerta men.

All women whom my wife calls *Ungaraitcha*, elder sisters, or *Quitia*,
younger sisters, are Umbitchana, and they also are *Unawa* to me.

All women whom my wife calls *Ipmunna* are Kumara, and they are
*Unkulla* to me.

Speaking as an Arunta man living in a part where only four sub-classes
are recognised, all the women of my wife's class, who in this case would
be Kumara, I myself belonging <span id="page_85">p. 85</span> to the
Bulthara, are divided into two sets, the members of one of whom are
*Unawa* to me, so that I can marry them; while the members of the other
are *Unkulla*, whom I may not marry. The latter are *Ipmunna* to my
wife. I can only marry a woman who stands in the relationship of
daughter to the women of the half of my father's class to which he does
not belong—that is, who are *Ipmunna* to him.

My *Ipmunna* are Bulthara.

My *Unkulla* women are Kumara, and they must marry Bulthara men, and
their children are *Mura* to me. That is, the relationship of *Mura*
arises from the marriage of male *Ipmunna* and female *Unkulla*. This is
an important relationship, as a *Mura* woman is the mother of my wife.

My *Umbirna* are Umbitchana men, who are the sons of Uknaria women—that
is, of my female *Mura*.

My *Ungaraitcha*, elder sisters, and *Quitia*, younger sisters, are
Appungerta, and are *Unawa* to my *Umbirna*, who are Umbitchana men.

The children of my *Ungaraitcha* and *Quitia* are Ungalla. I call them
*Allira* and they call me *Gammona*—that is, Appungerta men are
*Gammona* to Ungalla men and women.

My own and my brother's children are *Allira* to me, and I am *Oknia* to
them. My mother is Purula. She calls her elder sisters *Ungaraitcha* and
her younger ones *Quitia*. I call them all *Mia*. That is, Purula women
are *Mia* to Appungerta men. Her elder sisters I call *Mia apmarla*, and
her younger sisters *Mia alkulla*. <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md)

Speaking again as an Arunta man only recognising four sub-classes the
women of the class to which my mother belongs are divided into two
groups, the members of one of which have the relationship of *Mia* to me
and those of the other that of *Umba*.

The children of the *Okilia* of my *Oknia*, that is my father's elder
brothers' children, will be Appungerta as I am, and they will be
according to sex, my *Okilia*, elder brothers, or *Ungaraitcha*, elder
sisters.

The children of my *Oknia's Ungaraitcha* and of his *Quitia*

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

are Kumara, and are *Unkulla* to me and *Ipmunna* to my wife.

The children of my *Oknia's Okilia* call me *Witia* or younger brother,
and the children of my *Oknia's Witia* call me *Okilia*, and I call them
*Witia*.

The children of my *Okilia* and *Witia*, that is of my elder and younger
brothers, call me *Oknia*, just as my own children do, and I call them
*Allira*, and they are Panunga.

The children of my *Ungaraitcha* and *Quitia*, that is of my sisters, I
call *Umba*, and they are Ungalla.

That is, once more speaking as an Arunta man recognising only four
sub-classes, my own and my brother's children go into the same sub-class
as that to which my father belongs, whilst my sister's children go into
the sub-class to which my mother belongs, but into the half of it to
which she does not belong. That is, relations whom we class together as
nephews or nieces as the case may be, are either, in respect to a man,
*Allira*, that is, brother's children, or *Umba*, that is, sister's
children. It will be noted that the terms *Allira* and *Umba* are
applied to individuals of both sexes, so that each of them includes
individuals whom we call nephews or nieces.

My male *Allira's* children are Appungerta, and are *Arunga* to me and I
to them, the term being a reciprocal one.

My *Allira* are Panunga and my *Umba* are Ungalla, and these two are
*Unkulla* to each other.

My *Allira* call my *Ungaraitcha* and *Quitia*, that is, my elder and
younger sisters, *Uwinna*. That is, Appungerta women are *Uwinna* to
Panunga men and women.

The children of my female *Allira*, that is of my daughters, are Kumara,
and they are *Chimmia* to me and I to them. The term *Chimmia* expresses
the relationship of grandfather or grandchild on the mother's side, just
as the term *Arunga* expresses the same on the father's side.

My male *Chimmias*' male children will be Purula and *Gammona* to me,
that is they are the blood and tribal brothers of my *Mias*.

My male *Chimmias*' female children will be Purula and *Mia* to me.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

The children of my female *Chimmia* are Uknaria and are *Mura* to me,
and they are the *Mias* of my wife.

My sisters are Appungerta and the daughters of my father's sisters are
Kumara, and therefore stand in the relationship of *Ilchella* to each
other; the relationship of *Ilchella* only exists between women. That
is, if I am an Appungerta man, then my father's sister's sons and
daughters will be Kumara and *Unkulla* to me. If I am an Appungerta
woman then my father's sister's daughters will be *Ilchella* to me.

My mother's mother is Bulthara and is *Ipmunna* to me.

My father's mother is Umbitchana and *Aperla* to me.

There are certain differences in the terms used if a woman be speaking
which may be noted here. Thus, if I am an Appungerta woman, then I call
my own and my sister's children *Umba*, but I call my brother's
*Allira*.

I apply the term *Urumpa* to brothers and sisters collectively and also
to men and women who are *Unkulla* to me.

The sisters of my husband are Umbitchana, and are *Intinga* to me and
*Unawa* to my brothers.

The daughters of my father's sisters are Kumara and *Ilchella* to me.

The sons of my father's sisters are Kumara and are *Unkulla* to me.

My husband's father is Ungalla, and I call him and he calls me
*Nimmera*; the same term applies to all men whose sons are born *Unawa*
to me.

There is a special term *Tualcha* which is applied in the case of three
particular relationships, or rather is added to the usual one in order
to show the existence of a special connection between the individuals
concerned. <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md) Thus, every man calls the
members of a particular group by the name of

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

*Ikuntera* or father-in-law, but the particular one whose daughter has
actually been assigned to him—whether he has married her or not has
nothing to do with the case—he calls *Ikuntera-tualcha*. He may have
other wives, but unless the mutual agreement was made between his and
the girl's father that he should have the girl to wife, then the father
of the latter is not spoken of as *Tualcha*. In the same way the special
*Mura* woman to whose daughter a man is betrothed in his *Mura-tualcha*,
and, lastly, the individual who is *Ikuntera-tualcha* to one man, is
*Unkulla-tualcha* to the father of the latter. If, for example, I am an
Appungerta man, then my *Ikuntera-tualcha* is an Ungalla man, and he is
*Unkulla-tualcha* to my father.

It will be noticed that distinct names are given to elder and younger
brothers and elder and younger sisters. Thus not only are my elder
sisters in blood called *Ungaraitcha*, but the daughters of women whom
my mother calls *Ungaraitcha* are *Ungaraitcha* to me, and those of
women whom my mother called *Quitia* are *Quitia* to me. There are,
however, certain exceptions to this which are of interest as showing the
influence of counting descent in the male line. Not infrequently two
brothers in blood will marry two sisters in blood. When this takes place
the usual plan is for the elder brother to marry the elder sister;
should, however, the elder sister marry the younger brother, then
seniority is counted in the male line. In this case the sons and
daughters of the younger daughter are the elder brothers and sisters of
those of the elder sister.

A curious custom exists with regard to the mutual behaviour of elder and
younger sisters and their brothers. A man may speak freely to his elder
sisters in blood, but those who are tribal *Ungaraitcha* must only be
spoken to at a considerable distance. To younger sisters, blood and
tribal, he may not speak, or at least, only at such a distance that the
features are indistinguishable. A man, for example, would speak to his
tribal *Ungaraitcha* or elder sister at a distance of say forty yards,
but he would not address his *Quitia* or younger sisters unless they
were at least 100 yards away. <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> At
night-time *Ungaraitcha* and *Quitia* may go to their brother's camp,
and if he be present they may, sitting in the darkness where their faces
are not distinguishable, converse with his *Unawa* or wife. We cannot
discover any explanation of this restriction in regard to the younger
sister; it can hardly be supposed that it has anything to do with the
dread of anything like incest, else why is there not as strong a
restriction in the case of the elder sisters? That there is some form of
tabu, or, as the Arunta natives call it, *ekirinja*, in regard to the
younger sister is shown also by the fact that a man can never inherit
the Churinga of a deceased younger sister, but always inherits, on the
other hand, those of a deceased elder sister.

In the tables which follow, we give the intermarrying groups of seven
other tribes corresponding to those of the Arunta tribe; those of the
Ilpirra are identical with the latter, which indeed, have been derived
in their present form from the Ilpirra tribe. In all cases, men of
column 1 marry women of column 2, and their children are as arranged in
column 3; men of column 2 marry women of column 1, and their children
are represented in column 4.

In the case of three tribes, Warramunga, Bingongina and Walpari, the
system becomes still further complicated by the addition of distinct
names for females. These names are those printed in brackets. In these
cases a man of column 1, marries a woman of column 2, whose name is in
brackets, and their children are shown in column 3. In the Warramunga
tribe, for example, a Thapanunga man marries a Naralu, and their
children, if males, are Thapungerta, and if females, Napungerta. In the
same way a Chupilla man marries a Napanunga woman, and their children,
if males, are Thakomara, if females, Nakomara.

The tables are arranged so that the equivalent groups in the various
tribes can be seen at a glance. An Ilpirra Panunga man visiting the
Waagi is regarded as a Pungarinju, and amongst the Bingongina he is a
Tchana. An Ilpirra Purula woman amongst the Iliaura is regarded as an
Upilla, and amongst the Bingongina as a Nala, and so on.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_25"></span>[56:1](ntca04.htm#fr_25.md) In using the English
term we do not mean to imply that it is the equivalent of the native
term, but simply that the latter includes the relationship indicated by
the English term.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[57:1](ntca04.htm#fr_26.md) A child is, at its
birth, very often named after the place at which the mother imagines she
conceived it—that is the spot at which she first becomes aware that she
is, as the natives say, “*atnūnta*.” For instance, the child of a woman
who believes that she conceived it at Alice Springs is called
Atthuriira-rinia, “Atthuriia” being the native name of Alice Springs,
and “*rinia*” a suffix meaning “of” or “belonging to.” In addition to
the locality name others, which we can only call nick-names, are given.
These are very popular, and are derived from some personal peculiarity
or from some fanciful resemblance to a particular animal or plant. Every
individual has also a sacred name, which is especially associated with
his or her *churinga* or sacred emblem, and which is only known to the
men of his or her own local totemic group. Details with regard to the
names are given in Appendix A.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[58:1](ntca04.htm#fr_27.md)To this may be added,
still further, the fact that there do exist certain terms applied by men
to certain particular individuals which are in the strict sense “terms
of address.” A man, for example, addresses particular men who took part
in his initiation ceremonies by such terms as Tapunga, Urinthantima,
&c., which express no relationship, and the significance of which is
entirely distinct from the true terms of relationship now dealt with.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[59:1](ntca04.htm#fr_28.md) Mr. Roth, in his work
on the North-West Central Queensland aborigines, has proposed a series
of terms, Patronym, Gamomatronym, Paedomatronym, Autonym, &c. Apart from
the fact that these appear to us to be too cumbersome, the termination
“nym” which is common to them all implies, as it were, a certain
equivalency amongst them which does not exist, and therefore they appear
to us to be somewhat misleading. We shall merely use the terms class,
sub-class, totem name, sacred name, terms of relationship, terms of
address, personal name, status term.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[59:2](ntca04.htm#fr_29.md) Cf. Howitt, “The Dieri
and other Kindred Tribes of Central Australia,” *Four. Anth. Inst.*,
vol. xx. p. 30; see also Gason, *The Dieyerie Tribe of Australian
Aborigines*. The classes Matthurie and Kirarawa of the Urabunna are the
equivalents of the Matteri and Karara of the Dieri.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[60:1](ntca04.htm#fr_30.md) The totemic systems of
the tribes inhabiting the area of country which centres in Lake Eyre and
of which the Urabunna is one require further investigation. We have not
been able to acquire such detailed information with regard to this tribe
as we have in the case of the Arunta. The most difficult point to
determine is exactly what totems intermarry. Whilst the intermarriage of
the totems now described is correct so far as it goes, further
investigation may reveal the fact that, for example, a man of the crow
totem may marry women of other totems besides the cicada. This, however,
will not affect the validity of the tables and genealogical tree now
given. The fundamental fact is that men of one moiety of the tribe must
marry women of the other.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[62:1](ntca04.htm#fr_31.md) The exact equivalent of
the Pirauru of the Dieri tribe. Cf. Howitt, *Trans. R. S. Vict*., vol.
i., pt. ii., 1889, p. 96.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[66:1](ntca04.htm#fr_32.md) In the table we have
only indicated the totemic name: it will be understood that every cicada
man and woman belongs to the Matthurie class, and every crow to the
Kirarawa.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[67:1](ntca04.htm#fr_33.md) That is supposing 13 to
be an elder sister, and 11 and 15 younger sisters (blood or tribal) of
14.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[67:2](ntca04.htm#fr_34.md) That is if 39 be a
daughter of a younger brother of 14.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[67:3](ntca04.htm#fr_35.md) 36 is regarded as the
daughter of an elder sister of 14.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[71:1](ntca04.htm#fr_36.md) An outline of the
organisation of the Arunta tribe has been given by Messrs. Stirling and
Gillen in the *Report of the Horn Expedition to Central Australia*.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[73:1](ntca04.htm#fr_37.md) The Alcheringa is the
name applied to the far distant past with which the earliest traditions
of the tribe deal.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[79:1](ntca04.htm#fr_38.md) Father's elder brothers
are Akaurli aniaura, younger brothers are Akaurli maianinga.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[79:2](ntca04.htm#fr_39.md) Mother's elder sisters
are Arungwa apmarla, younger sisters are Arungwa atchinali.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[80:1](ntca04.htm#fr_40.md) Father's elder brothers
are Gampatcha babati, younger brothers are Gampatcha kuka.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[80:2](ntca04.htm#fr_41.md) Mother's elder sisters
are Kurnandi bithara, younger sisters are Kurnandi bilibili.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[85:1](ntca04.htm#fr_42.md) In actual practice
these women are usually simply addressed as *Mia*.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[87:1](ntca04.htm#fr_43.md) This existence of a
special term having regard to the father or mother of a husband and wife
is probably very general in Australian tribes. It is interesting to note
that in the tribes studied by Mr. Roth, in which descent is counted in
the female line, the terms imply a relationship between the mother of
the husband and the mother of the wife; in the tribes to which our
account refers, and in which descent is counted in the male line, the
corresponding term refers to a relationship between the father of the
husband and the father of the wife.
