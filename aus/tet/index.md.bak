# The Euahlayi Tribe

## By K. Langloh Parker

#### 1905

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an effort by K. Langloh Parker to describe in formal terms her
understanding of Euahlayi society. The resulting ethnography is factual
and well written. Parker was obviously also familiar with the
anthropological literature. She was hardly the detached observer that
modern ethnography demands, however, at that time this methodology had
not been invented yet. This is not necessarily a bad thing. As Andrew
Lang points out in the introduction, she lived in close contact with
aborigines for many years, and as a female she had access to the women
of the tribe, a viewpoint for which we have no other source from that
time period.
