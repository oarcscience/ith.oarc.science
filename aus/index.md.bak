Finding texts about Australian Aboriginal religion in the public domain
was extremely difficult. There is a landslide of 19th and early 20th
Century books and articles about American and African indigenous
traditions, many treating the subject with sensitivity and great depth.
Only a few Australian works from this period are available, and most of
them are pretty vague on the details. Some of this can be attributed to
the traditional tribal secrecy, which is maintained even to this day.

Please be mindful of the historical context in which these books were
written. The obvious problem with these books is that they were written
by White Australians during the early twentieth century. This material
contains racist and sexist characterizations, inaccurate depictions of
aboriginal life and misrepresentations of their spiritual practices.
Some of these documents contain completely fictional material which was
the invention of the author, and have no actual basis in aboriginal
belief or traditions. descriptions of some of the ceremonies in these
documents or the naming of dead people may regrettably violate
Aboriginal tabus. These texts are provided for scholarly purposes and
should not be considered definitive material on Aboriginal culture, only
as a starting point for discussion.

In short, we encourage you to 'read between the lines'.
