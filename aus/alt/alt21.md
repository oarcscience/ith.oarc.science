# Mooregoo the Mopoke, and Bahloo the Moon

MOOREGOO the Mopoke had been camped away by himself for a long time.
While alone he had made a great number of boomerangs, nullah-nullahs,
spears, neilahmans, and opossum rugs. Well had he carved the weapons
with the teeth of opossums, and brightly had he painted the inside of
the rugs with coloured designs, and strongly had he sewn them with the
sinews of opossums, threaded in the needle made of the little bone taken
from the leg of an emu. As Mooregoo looked at his work he was proud of
all he had done.

One night Babloo the moon came to his camp, and said: "Lend me one of
your opossum rugs."

"No. I lend not my rugs."

"Then give me one."

"No. I give not my rugs."

Looking round, Bahloo saw the beautifully carved weapons, so he said,
"Then give me, Mooregoo, some of your weapons."

"No, I give, never, what I have made, to another."

Again Bahloo said, "The night is cold. Lend me a rug. "

"I have spoken," said Mooregoo. "I never lend my rugs."

Barloo said no more, but went away, cut some bark and made a dardurr for
himself. When it was finished and he safely housed in it, down came the
rain in torrents. And it rained without ceasing until the whole country
was flooded. Mooregoo was drowned. His weapons floated about and drifted
apart, and his rugs rotted in the water.
