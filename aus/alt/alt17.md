# Oongnairwah and Guinarey

OONGNAIRWAH, the diver, and Guinarey, the eagle hawk, told all the
pelicans, black swans, cranes, and many others, that they would take
their net to the creek and catch fish, if some of them would go and beat
the fish down towards the net.

Gladly went the pelicans, black swans, and the rest to the creek. In
they jumped, and splashed the water about to scare the fish down towards
where Oongnairwah and Guinarey were stationed with their net. Presently
little Deereeree, the wagtail, and Burreenjin, the peewee, who were on
the bank sitting on a stump, called out, "Look out, we saw the back of
an alligator in the water." The diver and eagle hawk called back, "Go
away, then. The wind blows from you towards him. Go back or he will
smell you."

But Deereeree and Burreenjin were watching the fishing and did not heed
what was said to them. Soon the alligator smelt them, and he lashed out
with his tail, splashing the water so high, and lashing so furiously,
that all the fishermen were drowned, even Deereeree and Burreenjin on
the bank-not one escaped, And red was the bank of the creek, and red the
stump whereon Deereeree and Burreenjin had sat, with the blood of the
slain. And the place is called Goomade and is red for ever.
