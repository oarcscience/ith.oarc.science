# Deegeenboyah the Soldier-bird

DEEGEENBOYAH was an old man, and getting past hunting much for himself;
and he found it hard to keep his two wives and his two daughters
supplied with food. He camped with his family away from the other
tribes, but he used to join the men of the Mullyan tribe when they were
going out hunting, and so get a more certain supply of food than if he
had gone by himself. One day when the Mullyan went out, he was too late
to accompany them. He hid in the scrub and waited for their return, at
some little distance from their camp. When they were coming back he
heard them singing the Song of the Setting Emu, a song which whoever
finds the first emu's nest of the season always sings before getting
back to the camp. Deegeenboyah jumped up as he heard the song, and
started towards the camp of the Mullyan singing the same song, as if he
too had found a nest. On they all went towards the camp sing joyously:

Nurdoo, nurbber me derreen derreenbah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  
Garmbay booan yunnahdeh beahwah ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  
Gubbondee, dee, ee, ee, ee.  
Neäh neïn gulbeejah, ah, ah, ah, ah."

Which song roughly translated means:

I saw it first amongst the young trees,  
The white mark on its forehead,  
The white mark that before I had only seen as the emus moved together in
the day-time.  
Never did I see one camp before, only moving, moving always.  
Now that we have found the nest  
We must look out the ants do not get to the eggs.  
If they crawl over them the eggs are spoilt."

As the last echo of the song died away, those in the camp took up the
refrain and sang it back to the hunters to let them know that they
understood that they had found the first emu's nest of the season.

When the hunters reached the camp, up came Deegeenboyah too. The
Mullyans turned to him, and said:

"Did you find an emu's nest too?"

"Yes," said Deegeenboyah, "I did. I think you must have found the same,
though after me, as I saw not your tracks. But I am older and stiff in
my limbs, so came not back so quickly. Tell me, where is your nest?"

"In the clump of the Goolahbahs, on the edge of the plain," said the
unsuspecting Mullyan.

"Ah, I thought so. That is mine. But what matter? We can share-there
will be plenty for all. We must get the net and go and camp near the
nest to-night, and to-morrow trap the emu."

The Mullyan got their emu trapping net, one made of thin rope about as
thick as a thin clothes line, about five feet high, and between two and
three hundred yards long. And off they set, accompanied by Deegeenboyah,
to camp near where the emu was setting. When they had chosen a place to
camp, they had their supper and a little corrobborce, illustrative of
slaying emu, etc. The next morning at daylight they erected their net
into a sort of triangular shaped yard, one side open. Black fellows were
stationed at each end of the net, and at stated distances along it. The
net was upheld by upright poles. When the net was fixed, some of the
blacks made a wide circle round the emu's nest, leaving open the side
towards the net. They closed in gradually until they frightened the emu
off the nest. The emu seeing black fellows on every side but one, ran in
that direction. The blacks followed closely, and the bird was soon
yarded. Madly the frightened bird rushed against the net. Up ran a black
fellow, seized the bird and wrung its neck. Then some of them went back
to the nest to get the eggs, which they baked in the ashes of their fire
and ate. They made a hole to cook the emu in. They plucked the emu. When
they had plenty of coals, they put a thick layer at the bottom of the
hole, some twigs of leaves on top of the coals, some feathers on the top
of them. Then they laid the emu in, more feathers on the top of it,
leaves again on top of them, and over them a thick layer of coals, and
lastly they covered all with earth.

It would be several hours in cooking, so Deegeenboyah said, "I will stay
and cook the emu, you young fellows take moonoons-emu spears-and try and
get some more emu."

The Mullyan thought there was sense in this proposal, so they took a
couple of long spears, with a jagged nick at one end, to hold the emu
when they speared it; they stuck a few emu feathers on the end of each
spear and went off. They soon saw a flock of emu coming past where they
were waiting to water. Two of the party armed with the moonoon climbed a
tree, broke some boughs and put these thickly beneath them, so as to
screen them from the emu. Then as the emu came near to the men they
dangled down their spears, letting the emu feathers on the ends wave to
and fro. The emu, seeing the feathers, were curious as to how they got
there, came over, craning their necks and sniffing right underneath the
spears. The black fellows tightly grasped the moonoons and drove them
with force into the two emu they had picked One emu dropped dead at
once. The other ran with the spear in it for a short distance, but the
black fellow was quickly after it, and soon caught and killed it
outright. Then carrying the dead birds, back they went to where
Deegeenboyah was cooking the other emu. They cooked the two they had
brought, and then all started for the camp in great spirits at their
successful chase. They began throwing their mooroolahs as they went
along, and playing with their bubberahs, or returning boomerangs. Old
Deegeenboyah said, "Here, give me the emus to carry, and then you will
be free to have a really good game with your mooroolahs and bubberahs,
and see who is the best man."

They gave him the emus, and on they went, some throwing mooroolahs, and
some showing their skill with bubberahs. Presently Deegeenboyah sat
down. They thought he was just resting for a few minutes, so ran on
laughing and playing, each good throw eliciting another effort, for none
liked owning themselves beaten while they had a mooroolah left. As they
got further away -they noticed Deegeenboyah was still sitting down, so
they called out to him to know what was the matter. "All right," he
said, "only having a rest; shall come on in a minute." So on they went.
When they were quite out of sight Deegeenboyah jumped up quickly, took
up the emus and made for an opening in the ground at a little distance.
This opening was the door of the underground home of the Murgah Muggui
spider-the opening was a neat covering, like a sort of trap door. Down
though this he went, taking the emus with him, knowing there was another
exit at some distance, out of which he could come up quite near his
home, for it was the way he often took after hunting.

The Mullyans went home and waited, but no sign of Deegeenboyah. Then
back on their tracks they went and called aloud, but got no answer, and
saw no sign. At last Mullyangah the chief of the Mullyans, said he would
find him. Arming himself with his boondees and spears, he went back to
where he had last seen Deegeenboyah sitting. He saw where his tracks
turned off and where they disappeared, but could not account for their
disappearance, as he did not notice the neat little trap-door of the
Murgah Muggui. But he hunted round, determined to scour the bush until
he found him. At last he saw a camp. He went up to it and saw only two
little girls playing about, whom he knew were the daughters of
Deegeenboyah.

"Where is your father?" he asked them.

"Out hunting," they said.

"Which way does he come home?"

"Our father comes home out of this;" and they showed him the spiders'
trap-door.

"Where are your mothers?"

"Our mothers are out getting honey and yams." And off ran the little
girls to a leaning tree on which they played, running up its bent trunk.

Mullyangah went and stood where the trunk was highest from the ground
and said: "Now, little girls, run up to here and jump, and I will catch
you. jump one at a time."

Off jumped one of the girls towards his outstretched arms, which, as she
came towards him he dropped, and, stepping aside, let her come with her
full force to the ground where she lay dead. Then he called to the
horror-stricken child on the tree: "Come, jump. Your sister came too
quickly. Wait till I call, then jump."

"No, I am afraid."

"Come on, I will be ready this time. Now come."

"I am afraid."

"Come on; I am strong." And he smiled quite kindly up at the child, who,
hesitating no longer, jumped towards his arms, only to meet her sister's
fate.

"Now," said Mullyangah, "here come the two wives. I must silence them,
or when they see their children their cries will warn their husband if
he is within earshot." So he sneaked behind a tree, and as the two wives
passed he struck them dead with his spears. Then he went to the trapdoor
that the children had shown him, and sat down to wait for the coming of
Deegeenboyah. He had not long to wait. The trap-door was pushed up and
out came a cooked eniu, which he caught hold of and laid on one side.
Deegeenboyah thought it was the girls taking it, as they had often
watched for his coming and done before, so he pushed up another, which
Mullyangah took, then a third, and lastly came up himself, to find
Mullyangah confronting him spear and boondee in hand. He started back,
but the trap-door was shut behind him, and Mullyangah barred his escape
in front.

"Ah," said Mullyangah, "you stole our food and now you shall die. I've
killed your children."

Decgeenboyah looked wildly round, and, seeing the dead bodies of his
girls beneath the leaning tree, he groaned aloud.

"And," went on Mullyangah, "I've killed your wives."

Deegenboyah raised his head and looked again wildly round, and there, on
their homeward path, he saw his dead wives. Then he called aloud, "Here
Mullyangah are your emus; take them and spare me. I shall steal no more,
for I myself want little, but my children and my wives hungred. I but
stole for them. Spare me, I pray you. I am old; I shall not live long.
Spare me."

"Not so," said Mullyangah, " no man lives to steal twice from a
Mullyan;" and, so saying, he speared Deegeenboyah where he stood. Then
he lifted up the emus, and, carrying them with him, went swiftly back to
his camp.

And merry was the supper that night when the Mullyans ate the emus, and
Mullyangah told the story of his search and slaughter. And proud were
the Mullyans of the prowess and cunning of their chief.
