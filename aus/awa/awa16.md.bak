### Old Testament Parallels

It has been said elsewhere that the physical features of Western
Australia resemble, in many respects, those of the Holy Land. Both
suffer from periodical draughts, and largely depend upon wells for
water. Then both have fertile and smiling pastures, side by side with
barren sandy wastes. Both have a warm summer, and a pleasant sea-breeze
near the coast, and both have largely a limestone foundation. Still more
curious to notice is the similarity in some points between the customs
of the Aborigines and those of the ancient Jews.

Some of the superstitious rites just referred to remind us of the
passage in I. Kings, chap. xviii, verse 28:--"And they cried aloud, and
cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the
blood gushed out upon them."

Then again, Jeremiah xlvii, 37:--"For every head shall be bald, and
every beard clipped: and upon all the hands shall be cuttings," etc. In
many parts of Australia the natives cut off portions of their beards at
funerals, in addition to the lacerations.

Again, in Deuteronomy xiv, 1, it is written, "Ye shall not cut
yourselves, nor make any baldness between

your eyes for the dead." Evidently the prohibition referred to an
ancient Jewish, as well as an idolatrous custom. It is also very
singular to remark that when the women among the Aborigines do cut and
disfigure their faces for the dead, it is always between the eyes, just
as was explicitly forbidden by Moses.

Elsewhere the Prophet Isaiah reprehends the custom of remaining among
the graves, which is, to this day a prevalent custom among the natives
of Western Australia.

"A people which provoke me to anger," etc., "which remain among the
graves and lodge in the monuments."

The native form of taking an oath also closely resembles that described
in Genesis, where "the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham,
his master."

Australian mothers, again, name their children from some circumstance
connected with their birth, or early infancy; just as in Genesis xxx,
11, Leah said, "A troop cometh, and she called his name Gad."

I have already referred to the practice of circumcision, which is common
in many parts, from St. Vincent's Gulf to the Gulf of Carpentaria.

I have likewise alluded to the interesting coincidences, but make no
attempt to draw inferences therefrom. With but meagre data and
inadequate knowledge, the subject is unapproachable. If, however, these
primitive people should have received from the common Creator certain
laws for the guidance of their lives, does it not furnish food for
reflection? It is scarcely necessary that I should disclaim any
intention of identifying my

aboriginal friends with the Lost Tribes!
