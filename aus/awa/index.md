This short essay on the Aborigines of Western Australia is primarily
useful as a historical document. Even at the time this was written there
were few Aborigines remaining in this area, and so even scraps of
information like this are important. The text is particularly revealing
as to Victorian attitudes towards Aborigines. Every paragraph of this
piece needs to be read with a careful eye for underlying racist
assumptions.

That said, the author was well intentioned. Calvert, who lists literally
dozens of academic affiliations on the title page, does criticize his
contemporaries for their treatment of Aborigines as subhumans.
Throughout the essay he attempts to demonstrate that the native
Australians have a complete cultural inventory. He notes that many of
the Aboriginal beliefs and practices which seem strange to Europeans are
not that different than some listed in the Bible. He ends with a plea
for protection of the Aborigines. It bears pointing out this
paternalistic attitude ironically led to policies which devastated
aboriginal culture.

There is some valid data here, however, particularly the linguistic
samples and transcriptions of songs.
