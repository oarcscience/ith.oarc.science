### Humor

I have often heard it averred that the natives are utterly wanting in a
sense of humour, and therefore are certainly irredeemable savages. Well,
I do not know the exact line by which humour and wit are separated, but
I think the following anecdote has a savour of both about it.

A well-known explorer, worn out with fatigue, and weak from privations,
flung himself by the fire to rest, having almost reached Perth on his
return journey. His wretched and woebegone appearance attracted the
attention of the native who accompanied him. He had some knowledge of
English, and thus addressed his master: "What for do you who have plenty
to eat, and much money, walk so far away in the bush?"

The explorer, tired to death, and rather annoyed at this conundrum, made
no answer. The black went on: "You are thin, your shanks are long, your
belly is

small--you had plenty to eat at home, why did you not stop there?" It is
hard to make these simple folk understand the love of enterprise and
adventure, so the traveller had to say:--

"Oh, you don't understand; you know nothing."

"I know nothing!" he exclaimed, with a laugh, "I know how to keep myself
fat, the young women look at me and say, 'he very nice, he fat.' They
look at you and say, 'No good, he too thin legs too long, he walk too
far in the bush.'"

It cannot be denied that the Englishman had the worst of the argument.
