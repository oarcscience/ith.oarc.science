### Land Ownership

Although the natives do not cultivate the soil--subsisting entirely by
hunting and fishing, or on wild roots and fruits--it must not therefore
be supposed that they have no idea of property in land. Every tribe has
its own district, and any intrusion for hunting, or other purpose, by
another tribe, is liable to be resisted by force of arms.

These particular sections of their tribal districts are recognized as
the property of individual members, as are also the wild animals found
upon it; and each "landowner" is naturally very jealous of his rights,
and pugnacious in upholding them. Trespass for hunting purposes is
punished with death if the hunter is caught in the act; if the
trespasser is tracked by footmarks, and so discovered, he is killed, if
alone and in a defenceless state., but if he is attended by his friends,
justice is satisfied with a warning spear-thrust through the thigh. The
possession of *friends* has the tendency, as among more civilized folk,
to somewhat mitigate the rigour of the law!
