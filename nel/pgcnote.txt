The Project Gutenberg Edition of 20,000 Year Old Cave Paintings

**This is a COPYRIGHTED Project Gutnberg Etext, Details Below**

Please take a look at the important information in this header.
We encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an
electronic path open for the next readers.  Do not remove this.


We are not sure Mr. Clottes wants to keep a copyright on these,
or whether he wants to put them in the Public Domain; in either
case, we would prefer not to jeopardize his rights, and we thus
are preparing this release as if it were copyrighted in 1995.

The translation in the original message we received was:
"All rights reserved" so we are presuming the copyright.
"Tous droits reserves" in the original French message...
which is also included in this package and in English.

If you want to get permission to use these for more uses than a
private one, we suggest you contact the Minstry of Culture.

Here is the permission statement we received in both French and
English, and we are VERY glad to have received it on such short
notice, and did not want to disturb things further by asking an
additional time for more details.


Monsieur,

Comme suite votre courrier ilectronique du 7 fivrier dernier, je vous informe
que M. Jean Clottes, conseiller scientifique du sous-directeur de l'archiologie
et auteur des quatre photographies et du texte sur la grotte ricemment
dicouverte en Ardhche, a donni son autorisation pour l'utilisation de ses
photographies dans le cadre du projet de CD-ROM Gutenberg.

Merci de ne pas oublier de mentionner son nom sur les documents publiis.


Sir,

As per your email of February 7th, I informed Mr. Jean Clottes, Scientific
Consul to the Deputy-Director of Archeology and author of the four
photographs and the texts concerning the cave paintings discovered
in Ardhche, to get his authorization for the utilization
of his photographs by the staff of Project Gutenberg's CDROM.

Photographs of 20,000 Year Old Cave Paintings

by Monsieur Jean Clottes

April, 1995  [Item #249]


*The Project Gutenberg Edition of Jean Clottes Cave Photographs*
*********  This file should be labelled readmepg.249  **********

******The files should be named cavep10.zip or cavep11.zip******
**Each .zip file should contain 4 .gif files and 4 .jpg files***

**cavep10 contains the more common files, of a somewhat darker**
hue and brightness level, and may be more suitable for a monitor
such as a NEXT color monitor.  cavep11 contains another set with
a lighter hue and brightness that I found worked better on those
monitors I tested on other systems.  The actual contents of four
files are the same as far as the material viewed is concerned so
pick the ones that work the best on your system.

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

We need your donations more than ever!
