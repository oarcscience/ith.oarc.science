<P>
The dominant world religions treat sexuality as (at best)
a distraction from the spiritual path.
On the other hand, some spiritual traditions
integrate sexuality into their spiritual
practice. Some regard sexuality as an integral part of life,
a gift to be honored and enjoyed.
This section contains classic texts which discuss
the sacred nature of sexuality and affirm the positive aspects of sex.
Some of these texts (<A HREF="../tantra/index.htm">the Tantric</A>) are esoteric and touch on the intersection
of the spiritual and the physical.
Others (such as the Kama Sutra material) are more rooted in the physical world.</P>

<A HREF="../tantra/index.htm">Tantra now has its own category</A>.

<A NAME="kamasutra"><H3>Kama Sutra</H3></A>
<P>
In addition to Tantra, which attributes a spritual dimension to
sexuality, India has produced a rich literature of sophisticated sex manuals.
In spite of their <I>practical</I> nature, they
demonstrate how Indian
culture integrated sexuality
into everyday life, (including religion and spirituality).
This knowledge was supposed to be part of the
repetoire of any intelligent and well-educated adult.
Several of these were translated in the Victorian Era
by freethinking Orientalists.

<H4>About these translations</H4>

<P>
These translations (as well as the Perfumed Garden and the Priapeia)
were produced by Sir Richard Burton and
Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot 
and published by the Kama Shastra Society (founded 1882).</P>

<P>
Sir Richard Burton [1821-1890] (not to be confused with the screen actor) was
an orientalist and daring explorer. Fluent in Arabic and Islamic culture,
Burton was the first Westerner to enter Mecca (in disguise).
He is also known for his unexpurgated translation of the 
<A HREF="../neu/burt1k1/index.htm">Arabian Nights</A>.</P>

<P>
F.F. Arbuthnot did most of the actual work of the translations of the
Indian works, while working for the Indian Civil Service in Bombay
from 1868 to 1879.
He was able to consult original texts of the Kama Sutra and Ananga Ranga
and discuss their contents with Indian scholars.<P>
The texts were printed 'for private
circulation only' -- a disclaimer
required in the stifling atmosphere of Victorian England.</P>


<A NAME="ancient"><H3>Sacred Sexuality in the Ancient World</H3></A>

<P>
In the late 18th century, classical scholars began to take note of
a phenomena which they termed 'Priapus worship'.
This was a complex of religious ideas in antiquity including
phallic votive objects, fertility ceremonies, sacred prostitution,
female and hermaphroditic creator deities, and other heterodox
aspects of ancient religion.
Much of this information had been surpressed or ignored.

sex positions, and the lascivious behavior of the Gods and Goddesses.
