There is a huge amount of academic 19th century literature relating to
sacred sexuality. However, there are not many books which cover this
subject matter for the general reader: this book is one of the few.
Goldberg approaches the culturally sensitive issue of the intersection
of religion and sex frankly and in some depth.

That said, this work has a few problems which need to be kept in mind
while reading it. There is not much in the way of apparatus aside from a
bibliography: not even the Bible quotes are attributed. Goldberg also
invents a number of descriptive passages, particularly in the second
section. While these go a long way towards dimensionalizing this
material, they include a number of purely speculative details which are
not identified as such.

Perhaps the best part of this book is the discussion of the evolution of
the attitude towards sexuality in Christianity. Goldberg also describes
a number of little-known curious cults such as the Russian Skopzi, the
mediaeval flagellants, and others. Long out of print, but available
used, this book serves as a useful introduction to the subject and sheds
light on some little known corners of the subject of sacred sexuality.
