<P><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A></P>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Votive Phalli.</H1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">PLATE XXV.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">No. 1.</P>
<P>A TWO-FOOTED phallus, having itself a second phallus and two wings, or fins, is represented by this lamp. A little child, wearing a kind of Phrygian cap, which served to suspend the lamp, is seated astride on this singular Priapus, and leans to place a crown upon its head. Some antiquaries have considered this crown to be intended as a sort of check which the young rider was desirous to put on his steed; but the opinion does not appear to us tenable. The ancients used bits for their horses which in no wise resembled the object we have here.</P>
<P>This little child astride on a phallus recals the obscene idea which in all times and among all peoples has attached itself to the word <I>ride</I>; in Latin, <I>equitare</I>; in Italian, <I>cavalcare</I>.</P>
<P>The two feet of the animal, which form the body of the lamp, terminate in two heads of phalluses.</P>
<P>From what we have previously said, every reader may explain to himself the meaning of this bronze, for the crown, the feet, the wings, or fins, indicate clearly enough the power of the generative principle innate with all animals living on land, in air, or in water.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">No. 2. BRONZE.</P>
<P>Another votive phallus, with wings and the feet of a quadruped.</P>
