PLATE XII</P>

<P><A NAME="page_28"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 28</FONT></A></P>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Drillopota.</H1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TERRA COTTA. <I>Height, 16 5/25 inches</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">PLATE XII.</P>
<P>BEHIND this figure is seen a vessel, which represents one of those obscene vases called <I>Drillopot&aelig;</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> out of which the ancients were wont to drink on certain occasions, undoubtedly in honour of Venus, or perhaps of Bacchus; for, assuredly it would be difficult to suppose anything like dignity or seriousness in such ceremonies. For a long time the corruption of the antique nations led them to feign a disgraceful attachment for the immodest ceremonies to which they were no longer able to yield a sincere worship.</P>
<P>This dwarf holds two objects in his hand which it would be difficult to qualify--two lumps of bread, perhaps. He carries in his belt a sort of casket, which may be the <I>crepundia</I>, a small box or purse for children to keep their toys in.</P>
<P>This <I>Drillopota</I> comes from Civita.</P>
