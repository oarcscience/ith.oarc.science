<P ALIGN="CENTER">PLATE XXVII.</P>
<P>HE hinder part of this bronze is somewhat like a horse. The wings are typical of the rapidity of fecundation. This novel Pegasus has three phalluses, one of which occupies the ordinary place assigned to it by nature among the mammalia. The second is raised like a tail, and the third rises from between the wings, in the place which would be occupied by a rider. It is evident that, from whatever side the maleficent spirit might present itself, it found a talisman ready to repulse it: much in the same way that, in our own day, a public building is surrounded with lightning conductors.</P>
