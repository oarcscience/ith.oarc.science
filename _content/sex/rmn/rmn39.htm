<P ALIGN="CENTER">FRESCO FROM POMPEII.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">PLATE XXXVIII.</P>
<P>THIS fresco was discovered in 1826, at Pompeii. It is supposed that the house where it was found was one of those places of debauchery called <I>lupanaria</I>. In one of the principal rooms of the house may be seen a painting representing some youths and courtezans abandoning to the pleasures of the table and to play: one of the young men, the hero of the fresco we are describing, heated, doubtless, by the fumes of wine, is pursuing a woman. His gestures leave no doubt as to the nature of his intentions; but his fair companion, alarmed at the sight of the prodigious instrument with which he menaces her, seizes her lover by the throat, and endeavours to push him back: she even seems on the point of hurling at his head a vase which she holds in her right hand.</P>
<P>The drawing of this fresco presents several imperfections, and the youth's left arm, though meant to be foreshortened, is evidently not long enough.</P>
<P>We mentioned in our Introduction that the Greeks called these sort of paintings <I>grylli</I>, and the Romans <I>libidines</I>. They were designated by a</P>

<P>more emphatic expression when they were more than usually indecorous, viz., <I>Spinthria</I> (debauchery), from &#0963&#0960&#0953&#0957&#0952&#8052&#0961, a spark. We shall henceforth make use of this term, as more appropriate to the paintings which remain to be described.</P>
