<P>
The Kama Sutra is an ancient Indian text which is considered the primary
Sanskrit work on human sexuality.
It was written by Mallanaga Vatsyayana in the 2nd century CE.
Although Burton published this, the most widely known English
translation, he was not the author of the translation, although
he did provide footnotes and the introduction.
The bulk of the translation was performed by an Indian archaeologist,
Bhagvanlal Indraji and civil servant Foster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot,
with the assistance of a student, Shivaram Pashuram Bhide.
This is one of the first systematic studies of human sexual behavior
in world literature.
It also documents the sociology of sex in India eighteen centuries ago.
