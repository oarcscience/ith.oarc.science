*Male Continence*, by John Humphrey Noyes \[1872\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

The testing Committee, thus qualified, has now been in session
twenty-five years. Two hundred and fifty sober persons have lived
together a quarter of a century under the rule of Male Continence in
constant observation of its tendencies and effects. Their experiment has
gone on through all the vicissitudes that reach from one generation to a
second. Many applications of their sexual discovery which were in the
far-off future when it was first published, are now matters of
experience. They have tested Male Continence even in its application to
Scientific Propagation. In a word, the rosy but infantile theory of 1848
has reached the manhood of robust embodiment in 1872. Has that rosy
theory fulfilled its promises? It is time the Committee should report.
If the experiment is still unfinished, it is far enough advanced to
warrant some conclusions. We shall doubtless be able to make a more full
expose after another quarter of a century's experience; but we will
briefly report progress up to this time.

In the first place, in regard to the injurious effects of Male
Continence, which have been anticipated and often predicted, the
Community has to report, in general, that they have not been realized.
For example:

It is seriously believed by many that nature requires a periodical and
somewhat frequent discharge of the seed, and that the retention of it is
liable to be injurious. Even if this were true, it would be no argument
against Male Continence, but rather an argument in favor of
masturbation; for it is obvious that before marriage men have no lawful
method of discharge but masturbation; and after marriage it is as
foolish and cruel to expend one's seed on a wife merely for the sake of
getting rid of it, as it would be to fire a gun at one's best friend
merely for the sake of unloading it. If a blunderbuss must be emptied,
and the charge cannot be drawn, it is better to fire into the air than
to kill somebody with it. But it is not true that the seed is an
excrement like the urine, that requires periodical and frequent
discharge. Nature has provided other ways of disposing of it. In fact it
has an immanent value, and is in its best function while retained. It is
the presence of the seed, and not the discharge of it, that makes the
bull superior to the ox. The Community has had no trouble from retention
of seed; but, on the other hand, has nearly exterminated masturbation by
the reflex

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

influence of Male Continence. Masturbation is a disreputable branch of
the same seed-wasting business that is carried on more decently in
ordinary matrimonial intercourse, and is evidently destined to pass away
with it.

Closely connected with this popular fallacy respecting the seed, is the
suggestion of certain medical men that the practice of Male Continence
would lead to seminal degeneracy and impotence. The experience of the
Community has signally refuted this suggestion in the only effectual
way, viz., by a great number of intentional impregnations, which have
occurred, within a few years, between persons who have been longest in
the practice of Male Continence.

Another apprehension suggested by medical men has been, that the
avoidance of the crisis in sexual intercourse would so increase and
prolong the excitement as to induce excesses, which would lead to
various nervous diseases. This suggestion, it must be confessed, has
some antecedent probability; but the general experience of the Community
has not confirmed it. The New York Medical Gazette of October, 1870, in
a review of our article on Scientific Propagation, published in the
Modern Thinker of that year, took occasion to criticise our practice of
Male Continence, as likely to prove injurious in the way above
suggested; and expressed a wish to see the statistics of nervous
diseases in the Community. Whereupon a professional examination was
instituted and a report made by Theodore R. Noyes, M. D., in which it
was shown, by careful comparison of our statistics with those of the U.
S. census and other public documents, that the rate of nervous diseases
in the Community is considerably below the average in ordinary society.
This report was published by the Medical Gazette, and was pronounced by
the editor "a model of careful observation, bearing intrinsic evidence
of entire honesty and impartiality."  <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)

It was, however, admitted in that Report that there had been one or two
cases of nervous disorder in the Community, which could be traced with
probability to a misuse of Male Continence in the way suggested by the
Gazette; and I will here take occasion to

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

add that I have no doubt the greatest danger attending the practice of
Male Continence is, and ever will be, the temptation to make a separate
hobby of it and neglect the religious conditions out of which it
originally issued and to which it belongs. Male Continence in its
essence is self-control, and that is a virtue of universal importance.
To cultivate self-control in respect to the seminal crisis, but neglect
it in other sexual indulgences, is evidently Male Continence in a
spurious and dangerous form. It is certain that this spurious
self-control may be cultivated even for the purpose of gaining freedom
for sensual and riotous pleasure. We may be thankful that such a
counterfeit cannot escape the checks prepared for universal vice.
Nothing less than heart-abandonment to the grace of God, which teaches
and gives temperance in all things, can ever release us from the old
tutelage of suffering. Our theory in its oldest form defined the sexual
organs as conveyancers, not only of the seed, but of the "social
magnetism." Now it is certain that the social magnetism is a vital
element, as real as the seed, and as really limited in its supply; and
that the loss of it in excessive quantities entails diseases as
atrocious as those which follow seminal waste. And to this liability
women are as much exposed as men. So much of warning the experience of
the Community enables it to contribute; though it has had no actual
shipwrecks on this coast of danger.

But after all it is not to be forgotten that the effects of nervous
exaltation may be good as well as evil. Herein the spiritual view is
perhaps a little different from the medical. A degree of excitement
which would injure a sick man may be harmless and even invigorating to
the healthy. And this principle must be carried upward, as our
definition of health rises. We must not seek examples of nervous
phenomena exclusively among the weaklings of debauchery, as writers on
sexual pathology generally do. Human nature certainly does not reach its
normal condition till it is the temple of the Holy Spirit, filled with
all the fullness of God. A nervous system in that condition can bear a
weight, not only of suffering but of glory, which would destroy ordinary
health. Paul's philosophy teaches that even the Lord's Supper, received
unworthily, may work damnation, thus causing physical weakness and
death. (See I Cor. XI: 29, 30). The ultimate way to escape nervous
injury

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

will be found, not in the direction of abstinence from excitement, but
in the toning of the nervous system to the divine standard of health by
fellowship with resurrection-life.

As evidence of the good effects of Male Continence, we mention, in the
first place, the universal feeling and testimony of the community in its
favor. Allowance of course must be made for party feeling in such
testimony, and it must pass only for what it is worth. But it seems
incredible that so large a body of sober persons as the Oneida Community
should be entirely mistaken in thinking, as they certainly do, that Male
Continence, in as experience of twenty-five years, has more than
fulfilled its early promises. A young member who is just closing his
career at college, expresses the general feeling of men and women, not
only of the first generation but of the second, in the following
enthusiastic terms:

> Dear Mr. Noyes:

> Yours truly, \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_

The general condition of the community may properly be put in as
evidence of the good effects of Male Continence. It is the principle to
which the community in some sense owes its existence, and which has been
the very soul of its working constitution. Such a principle, in a trial
of twenty-five years, must inevitably manifest its real character for
weal or woe, in the morals and physical conditions of its adherents. In
the place of any testimony from ourselves, the following picture of the
Community, drawn by a gentleman well known for his intelligence and
power of observation, will give the reader the best means of judging
what have been the general results of Male Continence.

In conclusion, I will mention one specific and very significant symptom
of moral health which has manifestly resulted from Male Continence. The
natural desire for children, which has almost died out in general
society, has returned to us, with all the vigor that it had in the young
and healthy ages. Instead of voluntary abortions and continual dread of
child-bearing, the demand for offspring in the Community and especially
among the women, though liberally provided for and enjoying ordinary
success, is far ahead of the supply.
