*The Karezza Method*, by J. William Lloyd \[1931\], at Intangible

## Preface

It was, I believe, in the winter of 1915-16 that a woman-friend in
California wrote and asked me why I did not write a special little book
on Karezza.

As events had convinced me that there certainly was crying need of
instruction on the matter, her suggestion took root and this small
brochure is the fruit.

For though quite a number have written more or less concerning
controlled intercourse, they have usually done so guardedly and so
vaguely that to the average inquirer the subject remains a mystery and
the beginner does not know how to proceed. For which reason most men
fail and give up who could just as well succeed. And success or failure
here may make all the difference between divorce or a lifetime of
love-happiness.
