<P>In the Gallery at Florence is a collossal image of the organ of generation, mounted on the back parts of a lion, and hung round with various animals. By this is represented the co-operation of the creating and destroying powers, which are both blended and united in one figure, because both are derived from one cause. The animals hung round show likewise that both act to the same purpose, that of replenishing the earth, and peopling it with still rising generations of sensitive beings. The Chim&aelig;ra of Homer, of which the commentators have given so many whimsical interpretations, was a symbol of the same kind, which the poet probably, having seen in Asia, and not knowing its meaning (which was only revealed to the initiated) supposed to be a monster that had once infested the country. He describes it as composed of the forms of the <I>goat</I>, the <I>lion</I>, and the <I>serpent</I>, and breathing <I>fire</I> from its <I>mouth</I>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> These are the symbols of the <I>creator</I>, the <I>destroyer</I>, and the <I>preserver</I>, united and animated by <I>fire</I>, the divine essence of all <I>three</I>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> On a gem, published in the</P>

This composition forms the Chnoubis of the Egyptians.</P>
<P>Bacchus is frequently represented by the ancient artists accompanied by tigers, which appear, in some instances, devouring clusters of grapes, the fruit peculiarly consecrated to the god, and in others drinking the liquor pressed from them. The author of the <I>Recherches sur les Arts</I> has in this instance followed the common accounts of the Mythologists, and asserted that tigers are really fond of grapes;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> which is so far from being true, that they are incapable of feeding upon them, or upon any fruit whatever, being both externally and internally formed to feed upon flesh only, and to procure their food by destroying other animals. Hence I am persuaded, that in the ancient symbols, tigers, as well as lions, represent the destroying power of the god. Sometimes his chariot appears drawn by them; and then they represent the powers of destruction preceding the powers of generation, and extending their operation, as putrefaction precedes, and increases vegetation.

On the Choragic monument of Lysicrates at Athens, Bacchus is represented feeding a tiger; which shows the active power of destruction.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> On a beautiful cameo in the collection of the Duke of Marlborough, the tiger is sucking the breast of a nymph; which represents the same power of destruction, nourished by the passive power of generation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> In the museum of Charles Townley, Esq., is a group, in marble, of three figures;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the middle one of which grows out of a vine in a human form, with leaves and clusters of grapes springing out of its body.

<P>another cluster from the Bacchus. This composition represents the vine between the creating and destroying attributes of god; the one giving it fruit, and the other devouring it when given. The tiger has a garland of ivy round his neck, to show that the destroyer was co-essential with the creator, of whom ivy, as well as all other ever-greens, was an emblem representing his perpetual youth and viridity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>The mutual and alternate operation of the two great attributes of creation and destruction, was not confined by the ancients to plants and animals, and such transitory productions, but extended to the universe itself. Fire being the essential cause of both, they believed that the conflagration and renovation of the world were periodical and regular, proceeding from each other by the laws of its own constitution, implanted in it by the creator, who was also the destroyer and renovator'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> for, as Plato says, all things arise from one, and into one are all things resolved.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> It must be observed, that, when the ancients speak of creation and destruction, they mean only formation</P>

<P>and dissolution; it being universally allowed, through all systems of religion, or sects of philosophy, that <I>nothing could come from nothing, and that no power whatever could annihilate that which really existed</I>. The bold and magnificent idea of a creation from nothing was reserved for the more vigorous faith, and more enlightened minds of the moderns,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who need seek no authority to confirm their belief; for, as that which is self-evident admits of no proof, so that which is in itself impossible admits of no refutation.</P>
<P>The fable of the serpent Pytho being destroyed by Apollo, probably arose from an emblematical composition, in which that god was represented as the destroyer of life, of which the serpent was a symbol. Pliny mentions a statue of him by Praxiteles, which was much celebrated in his time, called &#0931&#0945&#0965&#0961&#0959&#0954&#0964&#0969&#0957 (<I>the Lizard-killer</I>).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The lizard, being supposed to live upon the dews and moisture of the earth, is employed as the symbol of humidity in general; so that the god destroying it, signifies the same as the lion devouring the horse.

<P>am inclined to believe, meant originally the Destroyer, as well as the Deliverer; for, as the ancients supposed destruction to be merely dissolution, the power which delivered the particles of matter from the bonds of attraction, and broke the &#0948&#0949&#0963&#0956&#0959&#0957 &#0960&#0949&#0961&#0953 &#0914&#0961&#0953&#0952&#0951 &#0949&#0961&#0969&#0964&#0959&#0962, was in fact the destroyer.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> It is, probably, for this reason, that sudden death, plagues, and epidemic diseases, are said by the poets to be sent by this god; who is, at the same time, described as the author of medicine, and all the arts employed to preserve life. These attributes are not joined merely because the destroyer and preserver were essentially the same; but because disease necessarily precedes cure, and is the cause of its being invented. The God of Health is said to be his son, because the health and vigour of one being are supported by the decay and dissolution of others which are appropriated to its nourishment. The bow and arrows are given to him as symbols of his characteristic attributes, as they are to Diana, who was the female personification of the destructive, as well as the productive and preserving powers. Diana is hence called the triple Hecate, and represented by three female bodies</P>

<P>joined together. Her attributes were however worshipped separately; and some nations revered her under one character, and others under another. Diana of Ephesus was the productive and nutritive power, as the many breasts and other symbols on her statues imply;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> whilst &#0914&#0961&#0953&#0956&#0969, the Tauric or Scythic Diana, appears to have been the destructive, and therefore was appeased with human sacrifices, and other bloody rites.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> She is represented sometimes standing on the back of a bull,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and sometimes in a chariot drawn by bulls;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> whence she is called by the poets &#0932&#0945&#0965&#0961&#0959&#0960&#0959&#0955&#0945&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and &#0914&#0959&#0969&#0957 &#0949&#0955&#0945&#0964&#0949&#0953&#0961&#0945.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> Both compositions show the passive power of nature, whether creative or destructive, sustained and guided by the general active power of the creator, of which the sun was the centre, and the bull the symbol.</P>
<P>It was observed by the ancients, that the destructive power of the sun was exerted most by day, and the creative by night: for it was in the former season that he dried up the waters, withered the herbs, and</P>

<P>produced disease and putrefaction; and in the latter, that he returned the exhalations in dews, tempered with the genial heat which he had transfused into the atmosphere, to restore and replenish the waste of the day. Hence, when they personified the attributes, they revered the one as the <I>diurnal</I>, and the other as the <I>nocturnal</I> sun, and in their mystic worship, as Macrobius says,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> called the former Apollo, and the latter Dionysus or Bacchus. The mythological personages of Castor and Pollux, who lived and died alternately, were allegories of the same dogma; hence the two asteriscs, by which they are distinguished on the medals of Locri, Argos, and other cities.</P>
<P>The p&aelig;ans, or war-songs, which the Greeks chanted at the onset of their battles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> were originally sung to Apollo,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> who was called P&aelig;on; and Macrobius tells us,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> that in Spain, the sun was worshipped as Mars, the god of war and destruction, whose statue they adorned with rays, like that of the Greek Apollo.

The same figure appears on many ancient British medals, and also on those of several Greek cities, particularly those of Gela, which have the Taurine Bacchus or Creator on the reverse.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The head which I have supposed to be the Celtiberian Mars, or destructive power of the diurnal sun, is beardless like the Apollo of the Greeks, and, as far as can be discovered in such barbarous sculpture, has the same androgynous features.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> We may therefore reasonably suppose, that, like the Greeks, the Celtiberians personified the destructive attribute under the different genders, accordingly as they applied it to the sun, or subordinate elements; and then united them, to signify that both were essentially the same. The Helman therefore, who was the same as the &#0924&#0959&#0953&#0961&#0945&#0947&#0951&#0964&#0951&#0962 or &#0916&#0953&#0945&#0954&#0964&#0969&#0950 of the Greeks, may with equal propriety be called the minister of <I>both</I> or <I>either</I>. The spear in his hand is not to be considered merely as the implement of destruction, but as the symbol of power and command, which it was in Greece and Italy, as well as all over the North.

<P>was <I>to govern</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and <I>venire sub hast&acirc;</I>,--<I>to be sold as a slave</I>. The ancient Celtes and Scythians paid divine honors to the sword, the battle-axe, and the spear; the first of which was the symbol by which they represented the supreme god: hence to swear by the edge of the sword was the most sacred and inviolable of oaths.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Euripides alludes to this ancient religion when he calls a sword &#0959&#0961&#0954&#0953&#0959&#0957 &#0958&#0953&#0966&#0959&#0962; and &AElig;schylus shows clearly, that it once prevailed in Greece, when he makes the heroes of the Thebaid swear by the point of the spear (&#0959&#0956&#0957&#0965&#0963&#0953 &#0948&#8125&#0945&#0953&#0967&#0956&#0951&#0957&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>). Homer sometimes uses the word &#0945&#0961&#0951&#0962 to signify the God of War, and sometimes a weapon: and we have sufficient proof of this word's being of Celtic origin in its affinity with our Northern word <I>War</I>; for, if we write it in the ancient manner, with the Pelasgian <I>Vau</I>, or &AElig;olian <I>Digamma</I>, &#0988&#0945&#0961&#0951&#0962 (Wares), it scarcely differs at all.</P>
<P>Behind the bearded head, on the first-mentioned Celtiberian medal is an instrument like a pair of firetongs, or blacksmith's pincers;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> from which it seems that the personage here represented is the same as the &#7977&#0966&#0945&#0953&#0963&#0964&#0959&#0962 or Vulcan of the Greek and Roman</P>

<P>mythology. The same ideas are expressed somewhat more plainly on the medals of &AElig;sernia in Italy, which are executed with all the refinement and elegance of Grecian art.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> On one side is Apollo, the diurnal sun, mounting in his chariot; and on the other a beardless head, with the same cap on, and the same instrument behind it, but with the youthful features and elegant character of countenance usually attributed to Mercury, who, as well as Vulcan, was the God of Art and Mechanism; and whose peculiar office it also was to conduct the souls of the deceased to their eternal mansions, from whence came the epithet &#0916&#0953&#0945&#0954&#0964&#0969&#0950, applied to him by Homer. He was, therefore, in this respect, the same as the Helman of the Celtes and Scythians, who was supposed to conduct the souls of all who died a violent death (which alone was accounted truly happy) to the palace of Valhala.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> It seems that the attributes of the deity which the Greeks represented by the mythological personages of Vulcan and Mercury, were united in the Celtic mythology. Caesar tells us that the Germans worshipped Vulcan, or fire, with the sun and moon; and I shall soon have occasion to show that the Greeks held fire to be the real conductor</P>

<P>of the dead, and emancipator of the soul. The &AElig;sernians, bordering upon the Samnites, a Celtic nation, might naturally be supposed to have adopted the notions of their neighbours, or, what is more probable, preserved the religion of their ancestors more pure than the Hellenic Greeks. Hence they represented Vulcan, who, from the inscription on the exergue of their coins, appears to have been their tutelar god, with the characteristic features of Mercury, who was only a different personification of the same deity.</P>
