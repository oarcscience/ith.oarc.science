<P>1. THE eye of man I made to obtain knowledge by light; but the ear of man I made to obtain knowledge from darkness, and within darkness, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>2. The power of touch I gave to man, whereby he might learn of things their adaptability and compatibility and incompatibility with himself.</P>
<P>3. These are the corporeal doorways I gave unto thee, O man, whereby thou mightst receive knowledge from Me and My creations, consciously to thyself.</P>
<P>4. Through these, thou art constantly impregnated; through these, thy soul accumulateth knowledge of My works.</P>
<P>5. Whatsoever is charged upon these doorways of my soul, is inspiration.</P>
<P>6. When thou seest bread, thou art inspired to eat; when thou seest a horse, thou art inspired to ride; when thou touchest a nettle, thou art inspired with pain.</P>
<P>7. Yet, in all cases, thou must have practice before thou canst comprehend the inspiration that cometh to thee from these external things.</P>
<P>8. Man saith: To-day, I remember my friend whom I saw not for many a year.</P>
<P>9. Jehovih saith: I made thee as a storehouse, and as a book that was written before.</P>
<P>10. And I gave to thee power to re-read thy stores and thy book, within thy soul.</P>
<P>11. This was the accumulated inspiration which I had previously given thee.</P>
<P>12. When thou art fevered, or entranced, or in diverse action from thy usual bent, thy soul turneth into these stores, and thy memory cometh forth wonderfully.</P>
<P>13. This is the manifestation of inspiration which I had previously given thee.</P>
<P>14. I made thee that thou shouldst receive inspiration, not only from the world external to thyself, but inspiration from the members of thy body.</P>
<P>15. My impression upon thee is inspiration; but thou must realize My inspiration, in order to know Me.</P>
<P>16. An idiot holdeth fire in his hand, and it giveth him pain, but yet, he knoweth not the cause, nor whence the origin of the pain.</P>
<P>17. So, also, I come to thee, and give thee inspiration, but thou discernest not Me.</P>
<P>18. Another man discerneth My Presence, and My inspiration. He heareth Me speak; he seeth My Person.</P>
<P>19. Yet, I am with both alike.</P>
<P>20. One man openeth his mouth to speak, and, behold My words come forth.</P>
<P>21. And yet another saith: No man know Jehovih; none have heard Him.</P>
<P>22. One man is sensitive, as a plate for a picture, and he catcheth My Light instantly, and knoweth it is from Me.</P>
<P>23. Another one saith: A sudden thought struck me! But he discerneth not whence it came.</P>
