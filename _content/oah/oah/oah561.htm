<P>1. ES said: Now, whilst the Holy Council were still sitting in Paradise, a light, like a star, came, and stood above the throne of God. And the Voice came out of the light, saying:</P>
<P>2. Behold, the false Gods are cast out, and sent unto their places.</P>
<P>3. Never more shall there be any other false God, or Lord, or Savior, to lead my people away.</P>
<P>4. I am sufficient unto Mine own creations.</P>
<P>5. Let this, therefore, be the beginning of the kosmon era.</P>
<P>6. My people have settled the whole earth around, from east to west; the lands on the western borders of Guatama have become inhabited.</P>
<P>7. Go, then, My God, My Son, open the gates of heaven unto mortals.</P>
<P>8. Let My angels meet them, and talk with them, face to face.</P>
<P>9. Behold, My etherean embassadress, Che'sivi'anathaotes, cometh in a sea of fire!</P>
<P>10. The ships of the etherean Goddess were seen descending from the higher heavens, coming as an open ring, to embrace the whole earth.</P>
<P>11. Again, the Voice spake out of the light, saying:</P>
<P>12. I know no distinctions of men, of races, or sects, or doctrines, or past revelations. All people are My people!</P>
<P>13. Open the gates of heaven; let my angels speak to mortals!</P>
<P>14. Swifter and swifter came the etherean archangels, till all the heavens of Paradise were encircled in the love of the Almighty.</P>
<P>15. Then, God called out the legions who had the matter in charge, where mortals had been born for the work of Jehovih's kingdom. And God said:</P>
<P>16. Open the gates of heaven; let the angels of heaven speak with mortals; the time of the Father's kingdom is at hand!</P>
<P>17. Open the gates of heaven! Let the angels come forth in power!</P>
<P>18. And in Hidesville, in Guatama, on the earth, the angels opened the door in Jehovih's name, to be not closed again forever, forever!</P>
