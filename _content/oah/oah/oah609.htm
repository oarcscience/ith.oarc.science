<P>1. ALTHOUGH all inspiration goeth from Me to all the living, directly, yet I also created man susceptible to indirect inspiration from all My creations.</P>
<P>2. Whatsoever receiveth from Me direct, is in harmony with Me.</P>
<P>3. The lily and the rose I created perfect in their order; the female bird I inspire to build her nest in season, perfect in her order.</P>
<P>4. Even so is it with all My created beings, save man. All the rest err not, in the order I made them; and they all fulfill the glory for which I made them.</P>
<P>5. But because I made man capacitated to receive inspiration from all things, he manifesteth both, evil and good; according to his birth and surroundings, so is man good or bad.</P>
<P>6. Nevertheless, I created man with capacity to comprehend this also; for, I designed him, from the first, to work his way up to the Godhead, understanding all below him.</P>
<P>7. And I sent my angels to man, teaching him how to distinguish the difference in the inspirations upon him, that he might govern himself accordingly.</P>
<P>8. And My angels said unto man: Become thou one with thy Creator; these are His direct inspirations:</P>
<P>9. To love thy Creator above all else, and thy neighbor as thyself.</P>
<P>10. To give delights only, and not pain.</P>
<P>11. To kill not.</P>
<P>12. To do not violently against His creatures.</P>
<P>13. To be considerate of the liberty of all the living.</P>
<P>14. To interdict not the happiness and hope of others, only where thou canst return a transcendent glory and hope in place thereof.</P>
<P>15. For these are direct inspirations from thy Creator.</P>
<P>16. But these are thy evil inspirations, O man, these come from thy birth and surroundings, formerly called, satan:</P>
<P>17. To kill.</P>
<P>18. To slander.</P>
<P>19. To punish.</P>
<P>20. To destroy Jehovih's created beings.</P>
<P>21. To strive for thyself, above another.</P>
<P>22. To gratify thy flesh at the expense of purity or wisdom.</P>
<P>23. To be false to Jehovih.</P>
<P>24. To be false to thyself.</P>
<P>25. To speak falsely.</P>
<P>26. To covet another's.</P>
<P>27. To cohabit in the gestative period.</P>
<P>28. To engage in strife, or to aid and abet conflicts, which are the fruit of carniverous food, transmitted in birth.</P>
