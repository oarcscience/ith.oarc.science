<P>1. ALL things prospered in heaven for many years, nor were there great wars on earth, nor famines, nor epidemics. And the Lords of the earth had sufficient loo'is for all the Faithists, so as to control I'hin marriages to bring forth sons and daughters who would rejoice in heaven.</P>
<P>2. And as fast as they died on the earth, these angels were carried to heavenly places suited to them, where they were handed into the care of asaphs and entered as es'yans. But the Lords appointed no loo'is over the barbarians; and only commanded the ashars to watch for their spirits in the hour of death, and, if possible, to bring them to the organic places of God in Hored. And mostly they were so brought. This continued for many years; but in course of time the familiar spirits aroused up the barbarians, and they began to have dreams and see visions, for their familiars talked to them during sleep. And when this became common, Jehovih said:</P>
<P>3. Behold, the time is come to appoint loo'is to abide with the barbarians. For herein will I reveal a great secret, which is that My chosen on earth cannot subdue it; for they are a harmless and defenseless people. Therefore, have I created the barbarian wisely; for he shall drive away and destroy all evil beasts and serpents; and the forests shall fall down before him.</P>
<P>4. For this purpose the loo'is shall select marriages with the view of raising up great kings and queens. But since, in the olden time, the kings depended on the prophets of God for counsel, and thus were advised against killing anything I had created alive, they quarreled; so in this time of the new heaven ye shall permit the kings and queens to consult the spirits of the dead with the talents I have given them.</P>
<P>5. This was done also; and the barbarians were attended by familiar spirits, many of whom took upon themselves any name pleasant to the ear, some of them calling themselves God or Lord, or after the name of some great king of the olden time. And these familiars, being stupid, supposed themselves to be such persons.</P>
<P>6. The result of their stupid impressions was to inspire the barbarians to believe they were attended by Gods or Lords, or by the spirits of kings or queens; and so they held up their heads and began to think. For as it had been said by the Gods of ancient times: Some are led by flattery, some by self-conceit, some by duty, some by love of righteousness; but there are others who can be led to self-improvement by persuading them they are chosen especially by some God or Lord, or the spirit of a renowned king or queen, to work wonders.</P>
<P>7. God said: There was a certain sick man who could not be cured by the physicians; so there came a foolish woman, seeing visions, and said to the sick man: To-morrow thou shalt be healed. God hath been trying thee; but thou hast proven thyself in soul, and thy God will withdraw the spell of <A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A> thy infirmity; behold, thy God standeth by thee.</P>
<P>8. Now on the following day the sick man put forth his own spirit and rose up and was well; wherefore, it hath been adjudged even deceit may accomplish what truth could not. Suffer then the familiars to lead the barbarians on for a season, but be ye watchful at the proper time to appoint new spirits to be with them.</P>
<P><A NAME="tetracts">9. God said: Instruct the Lords that the time is now come to reveal to mortals, especially to the I'hins, the seven tetracts; for, as the ashars are withdrawn a pace, so shall mortals advance a pace.</P>
<P>10. Which is to say: These are the inheritances of all men born on the earth: ANASH, which is persistent stubbornness, by word or thought; ZIMMAH, wicked device; RA, delight in being bad; BELYYAAL, worthlessness; AVEN, vanity and self-conceit; DIBBAH, slander and reporting of evils; and SA'TAN, to be a leader, and especially to the delight of the other six entities.</P>
<P>11. These are the members of the Beast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> of all men and women under the sun; nor is any one without them in some manner or degree. Go ye, therefore, to the Lords and say to them: Jehovih hath set the beginning of the resurrection through Aph, His Son, Chief of the arc of Noe, to lay the tetracts on the shoulders of mortals.</P>
<P>12. The marshals of the Council provided messengers who were at once sent down to the different divisions of the earth; for the tetracts were some of the words selected in heaven to be given as everlasting names, whereby, in after ages, the tribes of Faithists might be discovered; and they were given alike to the Faithists of Guatama, Jaffeth, Shem and Ham, who were the sons of the arc of Aph preserved on the earth in that day. For these words were provided in the Hebraic, Vedic and Algonquin languages, to be synonymous, till the coming of the kosmon era.</A></P>
