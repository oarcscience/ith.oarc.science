<P>1. HEAR me, O thou most upright of Gods. Mine is a tale of pity and of horrors for thy people.</P>
<P>2. Behold, thy one-time brother Triunes have had great advantage of thee from the start.</P>
<P>3. They had more populous kingdoms and subjects of higher grades.</P>
<P>4. Nevertheless, wherein they have prospered thou shalt be wise.</P>
<P>5. They also found it necessary to have a name, that mortals could call unto.</P>
<P>6. And they took upon themselves the names, Brahma and Budha, both of which signify knowledge, no more nor less.</P>
<P>7. This hath satisfied mortals.</P>
<P>8. Now, thou shalt chose the name, Kriste, which is the Ahamic word for knowledge also.</P>
<P>9. In this, then, thou shalt have truth on thy side in heaven before thy Holy Council, and on earth thou shalt have a personal embodiment.</P>
