<P>1. HAVING shown the impossibility of philosophy based on corporeal knowledge to demonstrate truth in regard to unseen things, and in regard to planets distant from the earth, it becometh a part of these revelations to put the student in the way to learn from the unseen forces which govern all corporeal things, man included, as a general and important part.</P>
<P>2. When a heavy stone falleth on a man and holdeth him down, it is sufficient to say the stone ruleth over the man. If an epidemic come upon a city because of uncleanness, it is well to consider that cause also. Nevertheless, if an epidemic be periodical to a certain city, even when not unclean, it is wise to prophesy an unseen cause. The <A NAME="page_584"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 584</FONT></A> same rule applieth in comparing one locality with another.</P>
<P>3. In certain regions of the earth, certain diseases are common; in certain times of the earth, as to cycles of three thousand years, certain diseases were common. In certain places of the earth man hath at times, thousands of years ago, attained to great knowledge and virtue. But his whole country in after centuries became a wilderness.</P>
<P>4. It is not the place of a prophet to answer these things by the accusation of ignorance or war. The prophet must account for that tendency in man to fall into ignorance and into war. In other words, he must find the cause of causes.</P>
<P>5. At certain periods of time, for hundreds of years, nations have dwelt in peace, and have risen in virtue; then turned to war within themselves and gone down in death.</P>
<P>6. The prophets of old divided time into cycles of three thousand years, with slight variations. And they found that at such periods of time, some certain impulse came upon the people, causing them to try to be better and wiser. Even as the same feeling is this day manifesting itself in many nations.</P>
<P>7. The scale then riseth for four hundred years, more or less; and, after that, wars and epidemics come upon the people. They begin then to decline, especially in virtue and peace, but the general intelligence suffereth little for about another six or seven hundred years. After which time they destroy their libraries and records, and reduce themselves to ignorance and vice. Then followeth a darkness of one thousand or more years, with slight intermissions. In other six hundred years the corporeal senses begin to ascend. Self-conceit cometh upon them; they think they are the beginning of wisdom on earth. Then cometh another cycle of light. Angels descend from the unseen worlds. New revelations crop out in every quarter. Inspiration cometh upon mortals, and they go to the opposite extreme; superstition and obedience to unseen influences.</P>
<P>8. Such, then, is the general character and behavior of man during a cycle. And he riseth and falleth in all these particulars as regularly as the tides of the ocean.</P>
<P>9. That man may begin to comprehend these things, and learn to classify them so as to rise in wisdom and virtue, and thus overcome these epidemic seasons of cycles, these revelations are chiefly made.</P>
<P>10. As previously shown, there are positive and negative forces forever going to and escaping from the earth. Without these no creature could live on the earth. The negative imparteth to man his corporeal growth, and corporeal desires, passions, and so on.</P>
<P>11. According to the corpor solutions in the firmament and their precipitations to the earth, as to quantity and quality, so will man be affected and inclined to manifest. These influences are easily discernible by some persons. One is depressed by a dull day; another inclined to drunkenness and fighting. By a bright day man is inspired to energy.</P>
<P>12. A su'is is so susceptible to vortexian currents, he can realize the qualities of a medicine whilst it is yet in a glass bottle, by merely holding it in his hand; or know the character of the writer of a letter by holding the letter in his hand. Yet all this is accomplished by the vortexian current of the article in question.</P>
<P>13. These revelations however are not in reference to individuals, but to nations and peoples, in periods of time embracing hundreds of years, and thousands of years.</P>
<P>14. It is an error to say whilst the corporeal worlds are organized, with fixed orbits and uses, the unseen worlds are nothing, or at best not organized. They are organized, with orbits, places, forms, figures, and so on, as definitely as are the corporeal worlds. Their times and seasons are regular and well provided.</P>
<P>15. In the passage of the earth in its own roadway, it goeth amongst these etherean and atmospherean worlds regularly; so that the periods of inspiration, and periods of darkness, are not haphazard.</P>
<P>16. It is not the purpose of these revelations to work out prophecies, leaving nothing for man to do. But to call his attention to the unseen forces that rule on the earth, and show him the way to make the prophecies himself.</P>
<P>17. In orachnebuahgalah the student will draw a curved line, representing the travel of the great serpent for three thousand years. This shall be cut across in eight places, to represent the periods of light. The places between them shall be made dark and light according to the history of man's behavior during said three thousand years. War shall be represented by black. The duration of wars shall be marked with a cut called change. Numbers shall designate the degrees of historical manifestations. For every great division of the earth make one orachnebuahgalah. The scale should be <A NAME="page_585"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 585</FONT></A> from one to a thousand for the entire length; and from one to a thousand from one dawn to another, and from one to a thousand for each and every characteristic designated. Number man 1 and 33, and the moon 1 and 18; and number the earth 1 and 365. These were called by the ancients the grades of a thousand (So-e-cen-ti).</P>

<P>18. These periods will be found to come under certain numbers, 11, 33, 66, 99, 100, 200, 400, 666, 333, 66, 18, 500, 600, 365, 99, 33, 18, and so on. (Not that the numbers, as such, have anything to do with such matters.) Thus, the moon's time is 18, the earth's 365, a generation 33, dan 200, 400, 600, 500; nitrogen or darkness 66 and 666, and so on.
