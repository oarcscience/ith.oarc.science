<P>1. WHEN the infant is young, My Light is its first knowledge, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>2. It seeth Me and heareth Me; and it seeth and heareth My angels.</P>
<P>3. By the pressure of My Light upon its corporeal eyes and ears, it learneth to see and hear corporeally.</P>
<P>4. This is the beginning of two senses, which I created to grow parallel to each other, and equal in strength.</P>
<P>5. But the infant, being in the corporeal world, heedeth more the things that appeal to the corporeal senses than such as appeal to the spiritual senses.</P>
<P>6. So that one person groweth up, forgetting Me and My angels. He is a skeptic.</P>
<P>7. But another person groweth up, remembering Me, and My angels. He is a believer.</P>
<P>8. And, behold, thou, O man, inquirest of them: Whence came the idea of a Creator, an All Person?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_796"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 796</FONT></A></P>
<P>9. And one of them answereth thee: It is inherent; it is natural.</P>
<P>10. But the other answereth: It is folly; it came from darkness.</P>
<P>11. But I say unto thee, O man: Darkness can not create an idea; not even darkness would be known but for the light I make beside it.</P>
<P>12. Thou canst not imagine any animal under the sun which I have not created.</P>
<P>13. Man said: I imagine a horse with a fish's head and fins.</P>
<P>14. Whatsoever thou inventest, saith Jehovih, thou but taketh the parts of one of My creations, and puttest them to another.</P>
<P>15. Let this prove unto thee, if thou canst not invent a new living creature, that thy forefathers did not do so either in regard to Me.</P>
<P>16. Nevertheless, thou hast a thought, and an idea of Me and My Person.</P>
<P>17. And thou hast a thought, and an idea of the spirits of the dead.</P>
<P>18. By My Presence and inspiration upon thee, I taught thee I am the I AM, a Person.</P>
<P>19. By the inspiration and presence of My angels, I taught thee of them also.</P>
<P>20. My inspiration upon the bird causeth it to sing; by My Presence I teach it to build its nest.</P>
<P>21. By My Presence I color one rose red, and another white.</P>
<P>22. Proof of My Person is in the harmony of the whole, and of every one being a person of itself, perfect in its order.</P>
