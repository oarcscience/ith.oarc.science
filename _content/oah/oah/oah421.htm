The sacred birds of Zerl were written by an outline drawing of each and every one; but the pronunciation (in imitation of its speech) was different in the whole of the thirty-four tribes. The tame quadrupeds had fewer names. In Iz or Ez there were but twenty-two tribes, and, being the most sacred tribes of the west of the continent, their pronunciation varied less. Eolin said: Because Iz hath kept my commandments holy, I have bestowed a new tablet (Kii).</P>
