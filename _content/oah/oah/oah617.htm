<P>1. AS Jehovih, through His God, pulled aside the veil of heaven, saying:</P>
<P>2. Let My angels forth; together shall converse the living and the dead.</P>
<P>3. So santified He the day when the angels of heaven were made known to mortals. (March 31, 1848.)</P>
<P>4. And He gave the sign, A HAND HOLDING ASIDE A VEIL, signifying, HEAVEN UNVEILED, as the master's sign in the lodge on the day and evening commemorating the same.</P>
<P>5. And Jehovih gave to the members of the lodge to answer in the sign, THREE CLAPPINGS, signifying, ENDLESS JOY!</P>
<P>6. And Jehovih said: Remember this day, and keep it holy, to the end of the world. For, without books and without arguments, behold, I have proven unto you the immortality of the soul of man!</P>
