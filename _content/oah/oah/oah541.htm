<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">GOD PLEADETH WITH THE FOUR FALSE GODS</FONT>.</P>
<P>1. GOD said: In the name of Jehovih, greeting unto you.</P>
<P>2. Hear the plea of God, Jehovih's Son.</P>
<P>3. Like one that is whipt and beaten in a great contest, I cry out, because of the Almighty, whom I serve.</P>
<P>4. What is the fault of Jehovih, that ye have turned away from Him?</P>
<P>5. Behold, I will plead for Him. Was not His name good enough? What name is greater than the word, Creator?</P>
<P>6. If ye rejoice that ye live, then are ye not beholden to Him?</P>
<P>7. Why have ye substituted other names? Who was to be the gainer thereby?</P>
<P>8. Certainly not Jehovih.</P>
<P>9. What excuse can ye assign, that ye have made other names than Jehovih's worshipful on earth and in heaven?</P>
<P>10. Mortals will ask these questions in time to come.</P>
<P>11. Did not the Almighty, before your times, find a way to reveal Himself and his commandments?</P>
<P>12. Why have ye persecuted, abused and put to death mortals for worshipping Jehovih?</P>
<P>13. Behold, all ye four profess to be the Prince of Peace; but ye carry concealed daggers, and ye strike to death those who glorify the Creator.</P>
<P>14. I run after my children, as a father would, to snatch them away from a serpent; but ye slaughter them before my eyes.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_725"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 725</FONT></A></P>
<P>15. I weep for them.</P>
<P>16. In shame, I look upon the earth and the heavens thereof, and I say unto myself: O thou God, to whom these were given in charge, how incompetent thou art against the flood of evil!</P>
<P>17. And I pray unto Jehovih, that your hearts may be turned to pity. I see, before you all, certain ruin and terrible hells; and I cry out to Jehovih, to give me the means to save you.</P>
<P>18. I pray, that I may be even unmolested in rescuing and saving the helpless and distressed, but ye frustrate all my inventions.</P>
<P>19. I am weary with my labor, and with the great kingdoms given into my keeping.</P>
<P>20. Alas, I am shut off on all sides from doing good, and yet, that is all I desire to do.</P>
<P>21. Now, I beseech you, O ye false Gods, make ye concessions unto Jehovih.</P>
<P>22. Save yourself from certain destruction, and Jehovih's Son from humiliation, before the high-raised Gods of other worlds.</P>
