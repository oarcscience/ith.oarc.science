<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">OF DESTROYERS AND OF BUILDERS</FONT>.</P>
<P>1. ONE goeth about preaching against heavenly revelations, and against the wisdom of Jehovih; and his daring speeches and good logic fall upon errors and blunders in the written words, and he draweth the populace, after the manner of a gladiator.</P>
<P>2. Yet one such man that hath organized a brotherhood for doing good--the world hath not found.</P>
<P>3. Another man goeth forth preaching in laudation of heavenly revelations, and on the glory of Jehovih. The errors in inspiration he heedeth not; the good he treasureth. He may draw but few unto him and his work may seem little.</P>
<P>4. But in time to come his work becometh mighty over all the world. He organizeth his people in love and fellowship.</P>
<P>5. The latter is a builder on Jehovih's edifice.</P>
<P>6. Let these two examples stand before thee; and when the speech of the vain man is directed against heavenly revelations, saying: This is not of God; this is not of Jehovih, or this is not of angels--know thou that that man is not a builder.</P>
<P>7. But when a man saith all things are of Jehovih, either directly or indirectly; whatsoever is good in them is my delight--know thou that that man is a builder.</P>
<P>8. To strive continually to comprehend the right, and to do it--this is excellent discipline.</P>
<P>9. To be capable of judging the right, and ever to practice it within a fraternity--this is Godliness.</P>
<P>10. In the day thou judgest thyself, as with the eye of thy Creator, thou art as one about to start on a long journey through a delightful country.</P>
<P>11. In the day thou hast rendered judgment against thyself for not practicing thy highest light, thou art as one departed from a coast of breakers toward mid-ocean--like one turned from mortality toward Jehovih! like one turned from perishable things toward the Ever Eternal--the Almighty.</P>
<P>12. And when thou hast joined with others in a fraternity to do these things--then thou hast begun the second resurrection.</P>
