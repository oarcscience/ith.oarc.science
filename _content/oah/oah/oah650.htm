<P>1. O man, apply thyself to understand the spirit of my discourse, for herein shalt thou find the key to the Father's kingdom.</P>
<P>2. These are the rules of the second resurrection: To become an interpreter and worker without a written formula:</P>
<P>3. That whatsoever giveth joy to thy fellow and rendereth peace and good will unto all--shall be called light:</P>
<P>4. That whatsoever giveth sorrow to thy fellow, or discouragement to others--shall be called darkness:</P>
<P>5. As to find fault with another, or to aggrevate unto displeasure--shall be called darkness:</P>
<P>6. But to make another's burden light, to encourage him unto strength and happiness--shall be called light:</P>
<P>7. To be forever complaining about this or that--shall be called darkness:</P>
<P>8. To be forever imparting cheerfulness--shall be called light.</P>
<P>9. Now therefore whoso becometh a member of my kingdom shall practice light; but whoso practiceth darkness, will depart away from my kingdom of his own accord.</P>
<P>10. Neither shalt thou practice darkness upon thy fellow for any shortness he hath done.</P>
<P>11. Nor shalt thou reprove him for error, nor blame him, nor make thyself an inquisitor over him, nor assume to be a judge over him.</P>
<P>12. Nor ask him to apologize, nor otherwise seek to make him humble himself before thee.</P>
<P>13. Nor shalt thou boast over him because thou art wiser or stronger or more expert.</P>
<P>14. For all such inquisition cometh of darkness, and shall return upon him who uttereth it, in time to come.</P>
<P>15. Rather shalt thou discover the good that is in thy neighbor, and laud him therefor, for this is the method of raising him higher.</P>
