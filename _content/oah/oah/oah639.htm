<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE VOICE OF JEHOVIH</FONT>.</P>
<P>1. THIS is the sermon of the Voice, as delivered in Shalam to such as were admitted on trial, to wit:</P>
<P>2. My Voice is with all men, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>3. Whoso is admonished against wrong-doing hath heard Me. By that shall he know My Presence.</P>
<P>4 . The man of Uz crieth out in mockery: Who hath heard Jehovih? Do the Faithists say, they have heard the Creator's voice? How can empty space speak?</P>
<P>5. But I am sufficient unto all My creations. The ant heareth Me, and the bee, the bird and the spider and all manner of living things which I created.</P>
<P>6. How think ye they hear Me, learning to do My will? Go I to them with lips and tongue, or with a trumpet?</P>
<P>7. I am Spirit; I am the Soul of things. By way of the soul is My Voice unto every living creature that I created.</P>
<P>8. But man locketh up his soul, and will not hear Me.</P>
<P>9. He heedeth that which cometh upon his corporeal senses. And this darkness groweth upon him, generation after generation.</P>
<P>10. Then he crieth out: Where is Jehovih? Who hath heard Him? Perhaps the ancients; but none in this day.</P>
<P>11. Jehovih saith: I am as one on the top of a mountain, calling to all people to come up to Me. But they hearken to darkness at the foot of the mountain, calling them down in corpor.</P>
<P>12. Now, behold, whatsoever thou hearest, or seest or readest or any indulgence that riseth thee upward, the same is My Voice unto thee.</P>
<P>13. But, whatsoever thou hearest, or seest or readest that casteth thee downward, is the voice of darkness.</P>
<P>14. Whoso studieth to know the right, shall hear Me; whoso striveth to be all truth, to himself and to others, already heareth My Voice.</P>
<P>15. Whoso indulgeth in anger, or vengeance, or in wrong-doing, casteth a veil up betwixt Me and himself; he shutteth out My Voice.</P>
<P>16. It is a talent to hear Me; I bestowed it upon all the living; it is seated in the soul.</P>
<P>17. By cultivation, it groweth; yea, it becometh mighty above all other talents.</P>
<P>18. By its culture, man attaineth to all possibilities, for so I created him.</P>
<P>19. When My Voice is weak, because of the darkness of man, he calleth Me conscience, or setteth Me aside as a faint impression.</P>
<P>20. But, with culture, behold, My Voice cometh to man with words and with power.</P>
<P>21. And he knoweth Me, and is mighty in good works and wisdom.</P>
<P>22. And he becometh a proof before the world, that My Voice is with him.</P>
<P>23. Jehovih saith: Whoso hath not heard Me, is in darkness indeed. He hath not yet turned his thoughts inward to purify himself and seek wisdom.</P>
<P>24. Whoso hath heard Me, knoweth it, and all the world can not convince him to the contrary.</P>
