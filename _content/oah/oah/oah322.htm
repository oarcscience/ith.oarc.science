<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Book of Lika, Son of Jehovih</H1>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>KNOWN IN HEAVEN AS THE DAWN OF BON, AND ON EARTH AS THE CYCLE OF MOSES, CAPILYA AND CHINE! JEHOVIH SAID: I GAVE UNTO THE EARTH A TIME OF FULL EARTHHOOD; AND, THAT THE GENERATIONS OF MEN MIGHT KNOW THE PERIOD THEREOF, BEHOLD, I CAUSED MAN TO BUILD A PYRAMID IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD. FOR IT WAS MY MARK, THAT, FROM THAT TIME HENCEFORTH, MAN SHOULD TURN FROM STONE TEMPLES, AND THE HOPE OF EVERLASTING FLESH-LIFE, TO REJOICE IN SPIRITUAL ABODES IN MY ETHEREAN HEAVENS. AND I BROUGHT THE EARTH OUT OF DARKNESS AND ENCOMPASSED IT AROUND WITH THE DAWN OF BON</FONT>.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Chapter I</H3>
<P>1. IN the far-off etherean worlds spake the Voice of Jehovih, saying: Lika, Lika, My Son! Behold the red star, the earth. She cometh thy way; she mergeth dark and soiled from the forests of ji'ay, in the swamps of Bonassah. She will cross thy etherean fields, the Takuspe, and Opel, and Wedojain, dripping with the odor and dross of the ji'ay'an swamps. Go thou to her, and wash clean her soil and her atmospherean heavens.</P>
<P>2. Lika said: Alas, O Jehovih, how they have forgotten Thee!</P>
<P>3. I will go to the red star, the earth, O Father! I will deliver her into purity and faith. Thy chosen shall be delivered from bondage; Thy God made triumphant on earth and in her heavens.</P>
<P>4. Lika called to his high Council, in <A NAME="page_459a"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 459a</FONT></A> his etherean kingdom, Vetta'puissa, in the Plains of Peo'ya, off the Road of Ahtogonassas, at the high Arc of Bon, made light by the holy angels of tens of thousands of years; and he said:</P>
<P>5. Behold, the red star, the earth; the Voice of Jehovih came to me, saying: Go thou to her, O My Son, and wash clean her soil and her atmospherean heavens. And I said: I will go, O Father! I will deliver her into purity and faith.</P>
<P>6. Lika said: Five hundred million etherean hosts will I take with me. For five years and forty days will I and my hosts sojourn on the red star and in her heavens. Her true God shall be restored and delivered in my name by Jehovih's hand. According to the rank of harvest of the gardens of Honyon, so shall my marshals choose and record my hosts.</P>
<P>7. Then spake the Council, the historians of the etherean libraries of the Vorkman Road, where hath traveled the earth for tens of thousands of years. And they detailed the affairs of the earth for many cycles past; made plain before the Gods assembled all the doings of the earth and her heavens.</P>
<P>8. Then Lika sent swift messengers off to the earth and her heavens; in arrow-ships of fire they sped forth, twenty thousand, well skilled in coursing the etherean heavens and penetrating the atmospherean vortices of traveling stars. To obtain the details of her God and her false Gods; her Lords and false Lords; her hadas and her hells; to scan her libraries and hastily return to Vetta'puissa, to lay the matters before the high Council and Lika, the Nirvanian Chief on Jehovih's throne.</P>
<P>9. Lika was sprung from the corporeal star Atos, which traversed the roads, Yatas-ko-owen, of the south circuit of Thoese, the vortex of another far-off sun, and was raised to etherea in the cycle of Sai-kah, one hundred and twenty-five thousand years, by Meth-ya, Goddess of Ori-iyi, afterward Chieftainess of Yeuna-gamaya.</P>
