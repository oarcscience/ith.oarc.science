<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Chapter VII</H3>
<P>1. I created man, even from the first, that he should learn to be an independent being, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>2. And when My angels had taught man speech, making man name all the animals in the world, after the names the animals called themselves, I commanded My angels to come away from man, for a season.</P>
<P>3. To My angels I said: Behold, of all the animals I created in the world, to man only gave I capacity to transmit knowledge to his brethren by words.</P>
<P>4. And to man only gave I capacity to comprehend an idea of Me, his Creator.</P>
<P>5. Nevertheless, I inspire all living animals which I created; but they know it not.</P>
<P>6. I inspire the spider to make its net; the bird to build her nest; the wild goose to fly to the south, before the winter cometh; the mare to neigh for her colt; the ant to lay in its stores; the bees to dwell in a queendom; and so on, every living creature do I move and control by My inspiration upon them.</P>
<P>7. Males and females I inspire to come together at times and seasons; and then to live apart during gestation. These I keep before man as a lesson of the wisdom of My inspiration.</P>
<P>8. To man I give liberty to acquire wisdom by observing the method of My work, as I manifest in other living creatures.</P>
<P>9. I have also given man capacity to attain to know My inspiration in contradistinction from the inspiration he receiveth from his surroundings.</P>
<P>10. To no other creature gave I this capacity.</P>
<P>11. What cometh of Me, is without pain or injury to any one, and with liberty unto all. Such are My inspirations.</P>
<P>12. When man witnesseth a battle, he is inspired to battle; when he witnesseth peace and love, he is inspired to peace and love.</P>
<P>13. What moveth man in consonance and wisdom, and to life, is My inspiration.</P>
<P>14. What moveth man in disconsonance and folly, and to death, is inspiration from man's surroundings.</P>
<P>15. I inspire the serpent to bite to death; for thus created I it. This is no sin, for it fulfilleth its labor; it is the remnant of poison of other eras.</P>
<P>16. Man I created not to destruction, but to life, wisdom, peace and love toward all.</P>
<P>17. When man practiceth virtue, wisdom, truth and love unto all, his inspiration is from Me direct.</P>
<P>18. When man practiceth destruction and selfishness, his inspiration is indirectly from Me, through the conflict of his surroundings.</P>
<P>19. And thus becometh he evil, instead of good.</P>
<P>20. By direct inspiration do I move upon all the animals I created.</P>
<P>21. This I also created possible unto men, separate from indirect inspiration.</P>
