<P>1. THE Light of Jehovih being upon Tae, he said: Let the examples of Uz be not lost upon you. But where ye have learned, and what ye have acquired, these shall ye appropriate wisely in Shalam.</P>
<P>2. For which purpose, it is wise that we appoint our groups as now required, to be added unto afterward, when more is required.</P>
<P>3. How say ye, then, shall we appoint groups this day?</P>
<P>4. Thereupon, different persons spake, and the sum of their wisdom was that there should be:</P>
<P>5. A group of architects;</P>
<P>6. A group of clothiers;</P>
<P>7. A group of dieticians;</P>
<P>8. A group of engineers;</P>
<P>9. A group of manufacturers;</P>
<P>10. A group of horticulturists;</P>
<P>11. A group of agriculturists;</P>
<P>12. A group of botanists;</P>
<P>13. A group of nurses;</P>
<P>14. A group of physicians;</P>
<P>15. A group of artists (sculpture, painting and gardening);</P>
<P>16. A group of musicians.</P>
<P>17. And these were all the groups required at that time. Accordingly, Tae proclaimed them, and called for volunteers for each and every group.</P>
<P>18. And these were filled, though, because there were but fifty-two members, some of them took membership in two or three groups, so that all were filled.</P>
<P>19. The Light still being upon Tae, he said: Since ye have made the groups, let each group now select a chief.</P>
<P>20. Now, many of them spake up, saying: I neither wish fame for being chief, nor do I wish the responsibility of the position.</P>
<P>21. Tae said: Suffer me, then, to declare the Light that is upon me; which is, that ye are here to fulfill whatsoever Jehovih may put upon you, with all your wisdom and strength.</P>
<P>22. Whether ye be made chiefs or not made chiefs, it is Jehovih's work ye are here to fulfill, without any regard as to your personal selves.</P>
<P>23. To covet chieftainship would be selfish; to refuse chieftainship would be selfish.</P>
<P>24. We can not found the Father's kingdom with any other members than such as say, with all their hearts, and mind and soul: Whatsoever Thou puttest upon me, O Jehovih, that will I do with all my wisdom and strength.</P>
<P>25. To have faith in this way, is to have faith with practice; such a one is a Faithist in fact.</P>
<P>26. Now, those who had spoken before relented, saying: &nbsp; O Jehovih, what have I done? Behold, I tript myself up even in the start. Make this a rebuke to me, O Father, and heap Thou upon me whatsoever Thou wilt.</P>
<P>27. Tae said: What any one can do, it is well done; wherein he faileth, because of incapacity, behold, it is not his fault, but his misfortune.</P>
<P>28. So, it came to pass, chiefs were selected for every group, men and women.</P>
<P>29. And Tae was made C'chief. And so, Tae delivered to each of the chiefs a synopsis of his duties.</P>
