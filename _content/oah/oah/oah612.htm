<P>1. SEEK not to spread My gospels, and entice followers unto this, or that, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>2. Neither go about preaching, saying: Thus saith Jehovih!</P>
<P>3. Let all men hear Me in their own way.</P>
<P>4. No man shall follow another.</P>
<P>5. I will have no sect.</P>
<P>6. I will have no creed.</P>
<P>7. I am not exclusive; but I am with all My living creatures.</P>
<P>8. To those who choose Me, practicing their all highest light, I am a shield and fortification against all darkness, and against all evil and contention.</P>
<P>9. Thou shalt not establish Me by man's laws, nor by the government of man, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>10. Nor establish by man's laws or government any book or revelation, saying: Behold, this is Jehovih's book.</P>
<P>11. To keep man from interfering <A NAME="page_800"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 800</FONT></A> with man, this hath been great labor.</P>
<P>12. To teach man to comprehend liberty, especially as to thought and as to knowledge, this hath been a great labor.</P>
<P>13. For he falleth easily under the inspiration of his surroundings, and falleth under the teachings and persuasions of his brother.</P>
<P>14. Because he cometh from My hand into the world in innocence, a helpless infant.</P>
<P>15. And his elder brothers take advantage of his innocence, and teach him their own knowledge, instead of directing him to Me.</P>
<P>16. And his elder brothers were in darkness themselves, and their elder brothers before them.</P>
<P>17. I said unto man: Be free! Learn to know liberty! Think for thyself! Study thy Creator in all things, and in thyself in particular!</P>
<P>18. Turn thou away from thy elder brothers; come thou to the All Highest Fountain.</P>
<P>19. Be not confounded with abstruse reasonings; cut all things short, Godlike; learn thou of the Creator and His creations, there is nothing more.</P>
<P>20. Thou art one of the seeds of Jehovih, and wert planted by His Hand. Be thou free from all the world.</P>
