<P>1. APOLLO said: Hear the decrees of Jehovih, O ye Gods and Lords: I, His Son, God of three worlds, speak! In my speech lieth the wisdom of Time; the evidence of fifty thousand years. Here is a great matter, O ye Gods; answer it, O ye Lords of heaven and earth: A child learneth from that which is around about; a man learneth from that which is around about; a God and a Lord learn from that which is around about. Neither can they acquire anything more, forever. Jehovih saith:</P>
<P>2. I have decreed the breaking up of old foundations; in new creations I provide food for the souls of Gods and men.</P>
<P>3. Apollo said: To condense and to expand; to expand and to condense, is this all? Who shall fashion a corporeal world by compressing ether? or, by standing still, expand his own soul? How long will they be entailed with idle desires, and self-ease, and self-glory?</P>
<P>4. Jehovih saith: When the lower heaven turneth into itself, it soon turneth downward, also. And its cast mouldeth the earth-born. Look to it, O My sons and daughters, that ye preserve the high estate of heaven. Apollo said:</P>
<P>5. To be a God is not all; to be a Lord is not all; ye shall forever invent new stratagems in Jehovih's kingdoms. Your people shall be forever infatuated with continual surprises, or your kingdoms in heaven will go down.</P>
<P>6. Jehovih saith: Behold, I created man, and if he rest constantly, disease shall seize on his life parts. The kingdoms of men on earth that lack aspiration for the people shall bring destruction; to the kingdoms in the lower heaven, the lack of invented, new glories, shall breed up false Gods and false Lords.</P>
<P>7. Apollo said: To be a weak man, is nothing; to be a weak king, is nothing; to be a weak God, is nothing; but to be strong with Jehovih, furnisheth food <A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A> for the kingdoms of men and angels. Think not, ye Gods and Lords, that to be a good God is easy, or to be a good Lord is easy, or to be a good corporeal king is easy. He who ruleth in heavenly kingdoms, must forever furnish food for the souls of angels and men.</P>
<P>8. I, Apollo, Son of Jehovih, will give you a parable suitable for Gods and kings: A multitude go into a forest; one man goeth a little before the rest, and he calleth: Here! Here! Then he goeth a little further, and he calleth: Here! Here! And the multitude follow. Whereon, ye reason well, saying: If the leader go too fast for the multitude, they will not follow; and if he go not fast enough, they cannot follow. Wherein, of the last condition, anarchy ensueth, and new leaders are chosen.</P>
<P>9. And these conditions follow all peoples on earth, and in the lower heavens. But the glory of the emancipated heavens, in etherea, lieth in the development of every soul into ripeness and bloom, with none too fast nor too slow, but all as one, and one with Jehovih.</P>
<P>10. Is not this the testimony of the All Person: A ruler of a city; a ruler of a state; a ruler of a kingdom? Without a head to lead, and to govern, what people have been found? Without a God and Lords, and kingdoms in heaven, what angels are found? Strollers, beggars, drujas and vampires. He who setteth himself up against the king, what is he? He who setteth himself up against the All Person, what is he? Where is the fruit he hath brought to market?</P>
<P>11. His speech is cunning in denial; his arguments for liberty, the bait of hada. He crieth out, in justification of his mutiny: Liberty! Liberty! But he leadeth to inharmony and darkness. After that, he rusheth to the front, crying out: Follow me! follow me! I will lead to truth and light. And he himself becometh a God, but in falsehood, even as by falsehood he denied the true God.</P>
<P>12. A great fact declare I unto you, O Gods and Lords: A line lieth betwixt the man who hath too much opinion of his own, and he who hath no opinion at all. One is to be pitied, the other censured. Which, judge ye, do the Gods pity of these two, and which censure?</P>
<P>13. None could answer Apollo. So he spake further, saying: Pity ye him who hath too much opinion of his own; for of all men he standest the farthest from Jehovih. But the wise man and wise angel follow the median line betwixt the two. Herein lieth the harmony of a man's soul.</P>
