<P>1. NOW will I sing unto Thee, O Jehovih, a song of soberness.</P>
<P>2. When first Thou stoodst me on my feet, and I saw Thee, Jehovih.</P>
<P>3. And Thy hand, O my Creator, showed me the two roads, Life and Death.</P>
<P>4. And the people divided, some to Thee, and some to Death and idolatry.</P>
<P>5. Because of the magnitude of Thy Person, they set up Gods, Lords and Saviors.</P>
<P>6. In Thy name, I called out to them, but they heard not, and they fell down in Death.</P>
<P>7. And Thy Voice of sorrow rent the earth! Thy Faithists sang in the mournful lays of death.</P>
<P>8. In gloom will I sing for my brothers that went down in Death.</P>
