<P>1. THOU art of inspiration made, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>2. I made thee a corporeal body, and I wrote upon it. The result thou art.</P>
<P>3. And I made thee susceptible, so all things external to thyself could write upon thee.</P>
<P>4. The sum of these is thy knowledge.</P>
<P>5. As it is with thee, so is it with all men, and with all the living which I created.</P>
<P>6. Nor is there any knowledge in the world, but what I gave.</P>
<P>7. All of it is My inspiration.</P>
<P>8. Man said: By certain measurements I teach my son mathematics.</P>
<P>9. I am back of all, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>10. I taught thy father's father and all who were before him. The sum of all of man's knowledge is but man's capacity to perceive My Light.</P>
<P>11. I made thee My servant, to teach thy son by certain measurements. This was the road I made to reach thy son's soul.</P>
<P>12. Man said: I know more than did my father; and yet my father knew more than did his father. We reason, we digest, we compound from one another.</P>
<P>13. I am the All External; from Me <A NAME="page_795"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 795</FONT></A> are smaller lights focalized, saith Jehovih.</P>
<P>14. A man holdeth a condensing lens to the sun, and he lighteth a fire thereby, but yet the lens contained not the heat.</P>
<P>15. After such manner hast thou accumulated knowledge; yet, no knowledge was of thine own begetting, but all came from Me. I gave it all.</P>
<P>16. The increase in knowledge now upon the earth, with all the races of men, is only the increase I gave. Man of himself created none of it.</P>
<P>17. Neither canst thou create one thought, nor idea, nor impulse.</P>
<P>18. Thou canst only gather together from My harvests, or from Me in Person.</P>
