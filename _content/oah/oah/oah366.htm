<P>1. ELOIH, Almighty, Thou, my God, Who hast delivered my people! I will sing unto Thee a song; and the children of Israel unto Thee, O Eloih!</P>
<P>2. Thou art a great strength and salvation; unto Thee, Eloih, will I build my habitation; Thou, my father's God, O Eloih!</P>
<P>3. Thou art my Warrior; Eloih is Thy name, forever!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_520b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 520b</FONT></A></P>
<P>4. Thou has encompassed Pharaoh and his hosts; they are swallowed up in the sea, his chosen captains and his warriors in the Red Sea.</P>
<P>5. The depths covered them up; they sank to the bottom as a stone, O Eloih!</P>
<P>6. Almighty Eloih: Glorious in power in Thy right hand that passed over innocent blood!</P>
<P>7. Thou, my God, Eloih; Wise in majesty, in Thy right hand that dashed in pieces Thy enemy!</P>
<P>8. Excellency, O Thou Eloih; in graciousness that came upon them that rose up in Thy way; Thou sentest Thy breath upon them; as stubble they were cut down by Thy righteous sword!</P>
<P>9. By the breath of Thy nostrils, Thou heapedst up the waters of the sea; and the floods stood upright by Thy voice, to entrap them in the heart of the sea!</P>
<P>10. Thine enemy said: I will pursue; I will overtake them; the spoil shall be mine; I will draw the sword; my hand shall destroy them!</P>
<P>11. Thou didst blow with Thy wind; the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty waters.</P>
<P>12. Who is like unto Thee, Eloih, amongst the Gods? Who is like Thee, Glorious in Holiness, fearful in praise and wonders, O Eloih! Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand, and they went down into the earth.</P>
<P>13. Merciful Almighty, Eloih, my God, and God of my fathers; Who hast led forth Israel and delivered her into the land of her fathers, O Eloih! Who hast guided them to a holy habitation and peaceful one.</P>
<P>14. All people shall hear and be afraid; sober thought shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. And the nobles of Edom shall be amazed! The warrior of Moab; trembling shall take hold on them, and the wild men of Kana'yan shall melt away!</P>
<P>15. Thou, O Eloih, shalt strike them with fear; in the magnitude of the strength of Thine arm will they be amazed and helpless as stone. For this land is Thy purchase, O Eloih; in the passover of the blood of the lamb purchased Thou it; and Israel shall pass over it in fear.</P>
<P>16. And Thou shalt bring them to the mountain of their inheritance, to Thy <A NAME="page_521b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 521b</FONT></A> place, Our God, Eloih. To dwell in Thy sanctuary, which Thou has established for Thy reign, forever and forever.</P>
