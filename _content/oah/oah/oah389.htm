<P>1. GOD said: Here is wisdom, O man: To be observant of all things and adapt thyself thereto on Jehovih's side.</P>
<P>2. To obtain great learning that applieth to the resurrection of thy soul in comprehending the works of the Almighty.</P>
<P>3. To suffer not thyself to be conceited in the wisdom of the moderns over the ancients, nor of the ancients over the moderns.</P>
<P>4. The Creator created man wisely for the time of the world in which man was created.</P>
<P>5. Thou art for this era, and not for the past.</P>
<P>6. The ancients were for the past era, and not for the present.</P>
<P>7. To know the <A NAME="page_565"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 565</FONT></A> present; to be up with the signs of the times, this it is, to see Jehovih's hand.</P>
<P>8. Make not a God of riches, nor of thy supposed sciences and learning.</P>
<P>9. For in the time thou seest men doing these things, behold, that is the time of a cyclic coil in the great beast.</P>
<P>10. Thy God and thy Savior shall surely be swept away.</P>
<P>11. Make Jehovih, the Creator, the idol of thy soul; neither setting up this or that as impossible.</P>
<P>12. Opening up thy understanding to find the tree of light and righteousness of soul.</P>
<P>13. Admitting that all things are possible in Jehovih's hands.</P>
<P>14. Then thy God shall surely not be swept away.</P>
<P>15. Look about thee, O man, and learn from the Sons and Daughters of Jehovih, the march of the Almighty's kingdoms.</P>
<P>16. Who shall make a system or a philosophy like Jehovih? What hast thou found that is infallible?</P>
<P>17. The truth of yesterday is not a truth to-day; the truth of yesterday is the truth to-day.</P>
<P>18. Thou shalt come to understand even this.</P>
<P>19. To learn how to live; to rejoice, and to do good, and make thy neighbor rejoice also, this is wisdom.</P>
<P>20. Let these be thy loves and the glory of thy speech, and thou shalt learn to prophesy concerning the ways of Jehovih.</P>
