Oahspe is a book written in 1880 by an American dentist
named John Ballou Newbrough [1828-1891].
He claimed that it was the result of automatic writing,
dictated to him by spirits in a trance.
In this trance he wrote the entire book
on a very early typewriter (possibly the first such book
ever written on a machine!).
The spirits were very profilic; Oahspe is
about four-fifths the size of the King James Bible, and more than twice
the size of the Book of Mormon.
Other texts archived at Intangible Textual Heritage authored
via automatic writing during the 19th century include
<A HREF="../chr/agjc/index.htm">the Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ</A>,
and <A HREF="../wmn/cws/index.htm">Clothed with the Sun</A>.</P>

Oahspe appeared in the context of the Spiritualist movement,
the Victorian predecessor of the
&quot;New Age&quot; channelling and past life regressions.
It has similarities to <A HREF="../the/sd/index.htm">Theosophy</A>,
and, strangely enough, to the rumored science-fiction Scientology mythology
(which, of course, has no relationship whatsoever to Oahspe or its adherents).
Oahspe inspired a radically different set of spiritual beliefs,
called <I>Faithism</I> which has a small following even today.
The Faithists do not consider Oahspe the literal truth; instead they
find inspiration in its many ethical and spiritual passages.</P>
