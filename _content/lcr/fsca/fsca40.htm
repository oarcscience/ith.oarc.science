They were regarded by the ancients as ministers of sudden death.</p>  
<p>In Miss Millington's admirable book, "Heraldry in History, Poetry and Romance," it is stated that unlike the generality of such mythical beings, the harpies appear originally, as in Homer's "Odyssey," as persons instead of personations; while later authors for the most part reduced them to whirlwinds and whirlpools. Homer mentions but one harpy. Hesiod gives two, later writers three. The names indicate that these monsters were impersonations of whirlwinds and storms. The names were: <i>Ocypeta</i> (rapid), <i>Celeno</i> (blackness), <i>Aello</i> (storm).</p>
