<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Poseidon</span> or Neptune, the younger brother of Zeus (Jupiter), sometimes appears in heraldry, usually as a supporter. In the ancient<A NAME="img_23700"></A>

When he strikes the sea with his trident, the symbol of his sovereignty, the waves rise with violence, as a word or look from him suffices to allay the fiercest tempest. Poseidon (Neptune) was naturally regarded as the chief patron and tutelary deity of the seafaring Greeks. To him they addressed their prayers before entering on a voyage, and to him they</p>

<p>brought their offerings in gratitude for their safe return from the perils of the deep.</p>  
<p>In a famous episode of the "Faerie Queen" (Book iv. c. xi.) Spenser glowingly pictures the procession of all the water deities and their attendants:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"First came great Neptune with his three-forked mace,<br> &nbsp;That rules the seas and makes them rise and fall;<br> &nbsp;His dewy locks did drop with brine apace<br> &nbsp;Under his diadem imperial:</p>  
<p>"And by his side his Queen with coronal,<br> &nbsp;Fair Amphitrite, most divinely fair,<br> &nbsp;Whose ivory shoulders weren covered all,<br> &nbsp;As with a robe, with her own silver hair,<br> &nbsp;And decked with pearls which the Indian seas for her prepare."</small></div></p>  
<p>Amphitrite, his wife, one of the Nereids in ancient art, is represented as a slim and beautiful young woman, her hair falling loosely about her shoulders, and distinguished from all the other deities by the royal insignia. On ancient coins and gems she appears enthroned on the back of a mighty triton, or riding on a sea-horse, or dolphin.</p>
