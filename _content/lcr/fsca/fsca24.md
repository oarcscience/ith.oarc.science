### The Gorgon

<span class="smallcaps">Reference</span> has already been made to the
gorgon in a quotation from Milton. The name now denotes anything
unusually hideous. In classic story there were three gorgons, with
serpents on their heads

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

instead of hair. Medusa was the chief of the three, and the only one
that was mortal. So hideous was her face that whoever set eyes on it was
instantly turned to stone. She was slain by Perseus, and her head placed
upon *the shield of Minerva* (termed the Ægis of Minerva). Homer, in the
"Odyssey," Book xi. thus alludes to the dread creature:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Lest Gorgon rising from the infernal lakes  
 With horrors armed, and curls of hissing snakes,  
 Should fix me stiffened at the monstrous sight,  
 A stony image in eternal night."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And Shakespeare,
in *Macbeth*, Act ii. sc. 3, uses the name to picture, in a word, the
horrible discovery of the murdered Duncan:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight  
 With a new gorgon."</span>

</div>
