<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> Giraffe figures a few times in blazon under these names. It is described by old heralds as half camel and half leopard. A curious word-combination was made by the Romans when wishing to find a name for the giraffe. "It is," says Archbishop Trench, "a creature combining, though with infinitely more grace, yet some of the height and even the proportions of <i>a camel</i>, with the spotted skin of the <i>pard</i>." They called it "camelopardus," the camel-panther.</p>  
<p>There are two heraldic creatures based upon the above which are referred to in heraldic works, viz., the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Allocamelus</span> or ass-camel, having the body of the camel conjoined to the head of an ass; and the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Camelopardel</span>, which is like the camelopard, but with two long horns curved backwards.</p>
