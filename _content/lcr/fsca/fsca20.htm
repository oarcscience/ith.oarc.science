<p>The terrible dragon, with one hundred heads, that guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides, slain by Hercules, was celebrated in classic mythology; so was the Lernean hydra, a monster of the marshes that ravaged the country of Lerna in Argolis, destroying both men and beasts. The number of its heads varies with the poets, though</p>

The fable is usually referred to in illustration of a difficulty which goes on increasing as it is combated. (<i>See</i> page <A HREF="fsca14.htm#page_63">63</A>.)</p>

<p>The Lernean hydra, the watchful dragon of the garden of the Hesperides, the many-headed Naga or snake of the Hindu religion, are, say learned writers, only some of the many forms under which the relics of the ancient serpent-worship exhibited itself.</p>  
<p><i>A hydra, wings endorsed vert, scaled or</i>, is the crest of <i>Barret</i> of Avely, Essex. It is also borne by the names <i>Crespine</i> and <i>Downes</i>.</p>
