<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Next</span> to the lion in power is the tiger, an animal not possessed of the noble qualities of the lion, being fierce without provocation, and cruel without cause. The chief difference of the tiger from every other animal of the mottled kind is in the shape of the spots on the skin, which run in streaks or bands in the direction of the ribs. The leopard, panther and the ounce are all, in a certain degree, marked like this animal, except that the lines are broken by round</p>

<p>spots, which cover the whole surface of the skin. The use of the <i>royal tiger</i> in modern coats of arms is frequent, and has reference to services in the East.</p>  
<p>Outram, Bart., has for supporters: <i>two royal Bengal tigers guardant proper, gorged with a wreath of laurel vert, crowned with an Eastern crown</i>.</p>  
<p>Note.&#8212;In a heraldic description (or blazon as it is termed) it is necessary for the sake of greater clearness, and to prevent confusion, to name the older mythical creature the "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Heraldic Tigre</span>," that it may not be confounded with its natural representative usually called the "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Royal Tiger</span>"</p>
