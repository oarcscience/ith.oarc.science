### The Camelopard, Camel-leopard

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Giraffe figures a few times in blazon
under these names. It is described by old heralds as half camel and half
leopard. A curious word-combination was made by the Romans when wishing
to find a name for the giraffe. "It is," says Archbishop Trench, "a
creature combining, though with infinitely more grace, yet some of the
height and even the proportions of *a camel*, with the spotted skin of
the *pard*." They called it "camelopardus," the camel-panther.

There are two heraldic creatures based upon the above which are referred
to in heraldic works, viz., the <span
class="smallcaps">Allocamelus</span> or ass-camel, having the body of
the camel conjoined to the head of an ass; and the <span
class="smallcaps">Camelopardel</span>, which is like the camelopard, but
with two long horns curved backwards.
