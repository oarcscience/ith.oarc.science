<P>
Legendary creatures play important roles in many ancient texts.
Sometimes they are symbols of the hermetic processes of alchemy;
in other cases they crop up in antique accounts of natural history.
No doubt, these beings haunt our dreams and nightmares to this day.
These are some of the books on dragons, were-wolves, unicorns, mermaids,
giants and other elusive creatures at this site.
