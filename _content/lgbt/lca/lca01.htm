<P>[<I>The little god of Love is general represented as a child; and rightly perhaps, considering the erratic character of his ways among the human race. There are signs however of a new order in the relations of the Sexes; and the following tapers are, among other things, an attempt to indicate the inner laws which, rather than the outer, may guide Love when--some day--he shall have come to his full estate</I>.]</P>
