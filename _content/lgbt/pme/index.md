This historically significant essay was one of the first attempts in
modern times to examine homosexuality, putting it in a medical,
historical and legal context, and to propose that civil rights should be
extended to gay people. Along with Edward Carpenter and Walt Whitman,
Symonds was one of the pioneers of gay rights and spirituality. Symonds
was an aristocratic English man of letters who, by virtue of his class
status, was able to lead a closeted but very active sexual life. He
overcame the fear and loathing that Victorian society attached to
homosexuality through an internal struggle which is today known as
'coming out'. However, he had to live a double life, taking lovers from
lower social classes while embedded in a sham marriage, and normally had
write about his experiences in veiled language.

Even this privately printed essay, which discusses homosexuality
frankly, is extremely circumspect. We have to wade through quite a bit
of Victorian pseudo-science and gobbledygook to get to the very valid
points that Symonds was trying to make. Symonds concludes that
homosexuality is innate and not a disease or mental disorder, gay
sexuality is every bit as natural as heterosexuality, and homosexual
acts between consenting adults should not be treated as criminal. These
concepts are quite moderate (although at the time they were, of course,
radical), and today are widely accepted.

Symonds later wrote a companion essay to this, [A Problem in Greek
Ethics](../pge/index), which drew on his extensive classical knowledge
to examine homosexuality in ancient Greece.
