This is Edward Carpenter's study of (primarily male) friendship, which
in this case is a thinly veiled codeword for 'homosexuality'. In earlier
cultures, particularly classical antiquity, but up to and including
Elizabethan times, intense, even romantic emotional relationships
between men were accepted by society. Paradoxically, these relationships
between men were often in the context of cultures which disparaged same
sex eroticism, but had no problem accepting these strong bonds between
men.

Many of these were true life-long same-sex unions, by the contemporary
definition. Outstanding actors on the world stage, men of literature,
the arts, and political leaders turn up in this anthology:--the biblical
David, Alexander the Great, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Wagner and 'Mad'
King Ludwig, and many others.
