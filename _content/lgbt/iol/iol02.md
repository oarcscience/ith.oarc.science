# PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION

THE degree to which Friendship, in the early history of the world, has
been recognized as an institution, and the dignity ascribed to it, are
things hardly realized to-day. Yet a very slight examination of the
subject shows the important part it has played. In making the following
collection I have been much struck by the remarkable manner in which the
customs of various races and times illustrate each other, and the way in
which they point to a solid and enduring body of human sentiment on the
subject. By arranging the extracts in a kind of rough chronological and
evolutionary order from those dealing with primitive races onwards, the
continuity of these customs comes out all the more clearly, as well as
their slow modification in course of time. But it must be confessed that
the present collection is only incomplete, and a small contribution, at
best, towards a large subject.

In the matter of quotation and translation, my

best thanks are due to various authors and holders of literary
copyrights for their assistance and authority. In cases where no
reference is given the translations are by the Editor.
