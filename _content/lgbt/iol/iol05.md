### POETRY OF FRIENDSHIP AMONG GREEKS AND ROMANS

THE fact, already mentioned, that the romance of love among the Greeks
was chiefly felt towards male friends, naturally led to their poetry
being largely inspired by friendship; and Greek literature contains such
a great number of poems of this sort, that I have thought it worth while
to dedicate the main portion of the following section to quotations from
them. No translations of course can do justice to the beauty of the
originals, but the few specimens given may help to illustrate the depth
and tenderness as well as the temperance and sobriety which on the whole
characterized Greek feeling on this subject, at any rate during the best
period of Hellenic culture. The remainder of the section is devoted to
Roman poetry of the time of the Cæsars.

### MOTIVE OF HOMER'S ILIAD

It is not always realized that the Iliad of Homer turns upon the motive
of friendship, but the extracts immediately following will perhaps make
this clear. E. F. M. Benecke in his *Position of Women in Greek Poetry*
(p. 76) says of the Iliad:

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

"It is a story of which the main motive is the love of Achilles for
Patroclus. This solution is astoundingly simple, and yet it took me so
long to bring myself to accept it that I am quite ready to forgive any
one who feels a similar hesitation. But those who do accept it cannot
fail to observe, on further consideration, how thoroughly suitable a
motive of this kind would be in a national Greek epic. For this is the
motive running through the whole of Greek life, till that life was
transmuted by the influence of Macedonia. The lover-warriors Achilles
and Patroclus are the direct spiritual ancestors of the sacred Band of
Thebans, who died to a man on the field of Chæronæa."

### ACHILLES AND PATROCLUS

The following two quotations are from *The Greek Poets* by J. A.
Symonds, ch. iii., p. 80 *et seq.*:--

"The Iliad therefore has for its whole subject the passion of
Achilles--that ardent energy or μηνις of the hero which displayed itself
first as anger against Agamemnon, and afterwards as love for the lost
Patroclus. The truth of this was perceived by one of the greatest poets
and profoundest critics of the modern world, Dante., When Dante, in the
Inferno, wished to describe Achilles, he wrote, with characteristic
brevity:--

                    "Achille  
Che per amore at fine combatteo."

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

                         ("Achilles  
Who at the last was brought to fight by love.")

"In this pregnant sentence Dante sounded the whole depth of the *Iliad*.
The wrath of Achilles for Agamemnon, which prevented him at first from
fighting; the love of Achilles, passing the love of women, for
Patroclus, which induced him to forego his anger and to fight at last;
these are the two poles on which the *Iliad* turns."

### HOMER'S VERSION

After his quarrel with Agamemnon, not even all the losses of the Greeks
and the entreaties of Agamemnon himself will induce Achilles to
fight--not till Patroclus is slain by Hector--Patroclus, his dear friend
"whom above all my comrades I honored, even as myself." Then he rises
up, dons his armor, and driving the Trojans before him revenges himself
on the body of Hector. But Patroclus lies yet unburied; and when the
fighting is over, to Achilles comes the ghost of his dead friend:--

"The son of Peleus, by the shore of the roaring sea lay, heavily
groaning, surrounded by his Myrmidons; on a fair space of sand he lay,
where the waves lapped the beach. Then slumber took him, loosing the
cares of his heart, and mantling softly around him, for sorely wearied
were his radiant limbs with driving Hector on by windy

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Troy. There to him came the soul of poor
Patroclus, in all things like himself, in stature, and in the beauty of
his eyes and voice, and on the form was raiment like his own. He stood
above. the hero's head, and spake to him:--

"Sleepest thou, and me hast thou forgotten, Achilles? Not in my life
wert thou neglectful of me, but in death. Bury me soon, that I may ass
the gates of Hades. Far off the souls, the shadows of the dead, repel
me, nor suffer me to join them on the river bank; but, as it is, thus I
roam around the wide-doored house of Hades. But stretch to me thy hand I
entreat; for never again shall I return from Hades when once e shall
have given me the meed of funeral fire. Nay, never shall we sit in life
apart from our dear comrades and take counsel together. But me hath
hateful fate enveloped--fate that was mine at the moment of my birth.
And for thyself, divine Achilles, it is doomed to die beneath the noble
Trojan's wall. Another thing I say to thee, and bid thee do it if thou
wilt obey me:--lay not my bones apart from thine, Achilles, but lay them
together; for we were brought up together in house, when Menœtius
brought me, a child, Opus to your house, because of woeful bloodshed on
the day in which I slew the son of Amphidamas, myself a child, not
willing it but in anger at our games. Then did the horseman, Peleus,
take me, and rear me in his house, and cause me to be called thy squire.
So then let one grave also hide

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

the bones of both of us, the golden urn thy goddess-mother gave to
thee.'

"Him answered swift-footed Achilles:--

'Why, dearest and most honored, hast thou hither come, to lay on me this
thy behest? All things most certainly will I perform, and bow to what
thou biddest. But stand thou near: even for one moment let us throw our
arms upon each other's neck, and take our fill of sorrowful wailing.'

"So spake he, and with his outstretched hands he clasped, but could not
seize. The spirit, earthward, like smoke, vanished with a shriek. Then
all astonished arose Achilles, and beat his palms together, and spake a
piteous word:--

"'Heavens! is there then, among the dead, soul and the shade of life,
but thought is theirs no more at all? For through the night the soul of
poor Patroclus stood above my head, wailing and sorrowing loud, and bade
me do his will; it was the very semblance of himself.'

"So spake he, and in the hearts of all of them he raised desire of
lamentation; and while they were yet mourning to them appeared
rose-fingered dawn about the piteous corpse." *Iliad*, xxiii. 59 *et
seq*.

### PLATO'S VERSION

PLATO in the *Symposium* dwells tenderly on this relation between
Achilles and Patroclus:--

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

\[And great\] "was the reward of the true love of Achilles towards his
lover Patroclus--his lover and not his love (the notion that Patroclus
was the beloved one is a foolish error into which Æschylus has fallen,
for Achilles was surely the fairer of the two, fairer also than all the
other heroes; and, as Homer informs us, he was still beardless, and
younger far). And greatly as the gods honor the virtue of love, still
the return of love on the part of the beloved to the lover is more
admired and valued and rewarded by them, for the lover has a nature more
divine and worthy of worship. Now Achilles was quite aware, for he had
been told by his mother, that he might avoid death and return home, and
live to a good old age, if he abstained from slaying Hector.
Nevertheless he gave his life to revenge his friend, and dared to die,
not only on his behalf, but after his death. Wherefore the gods honored
him even above Alcestis, and sent him to the Islands of the Blest."
*Symposium, speech of Phædrus, trans. by B. Fowett*.

And on this passage Symonds has the following note:--

"Plato, discussing the *Myrmidones* of Æschylus, remarks in the
*Symposium* that the tragic poet was wrong to make Achilles the lover of
Patroclus, seeing that Patroclus was the elder of the two, and that
Achilles was the youngest and

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

most beautiful of all the Greeks. The fact however is that Homer raises
no question in our minds about the relation of lover and beloved.
Achilles and Patroclus are comrades. Their friendship is equal. It was
only the reflective activity of the Greek mind, working upon the Homeric
legend by the light of subsequent custom, which introduced these
distinctions." *The Greek Poets*, ch. iii. p. 103.

### ATHENÆUS

From the time of Homer onwards, Greek literature was full of songs
celebrating friendship:--

"And in fact there was such emulation about composing poems of this
sort, and so far was any one from thinking lightly of the amatory poets,
that Æschylus, who was a very great poet, and Sophocles too introduced
the subject of the loves of men on the stage in their tragedies: the one
describing the love of Achilles for Patroclus, and the other, in his
Niobe, the mutual love of her sons (on which account some have given an
ill name to that tragedy); and all such passages as those are very
agreeable to the spectators." *Athenæus*, bk. xlii. ch. 75.

### FROM THEOGNIS

ONE of the earlier Greek poets was Theognis (B.C. 550) whose Gnomæ or
Maxims were a series of verses mostly addressed to his young friend
Kurnus, whom by this means he sought to

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

guide and instruct out of the stores of his own riper experience. The
verses are reserved and didactic for the most part, but now and then, as
in the following passage, show deep underlying feeling:

"Lo, I have given thee wings wherewith to fly  
  Over the boundless ocean and the earth;  
Yea, on the lips of many shalt thou lie  
  The comrade of their banquet and their mirth.  
Youths in their loveliness shall make thee sound  
  Upon the silver flute's melodious breath;  
And when thou goest darkling underground  
  Down to the lamentable house of death,  
Oh yet not then from honor shalt thou cease,  
  But wander, an imperishable name,  
Kurnus, about the seas and shores of Greece,  
  Crossing from isle to isle the barren main.  
Horses thou shalt not need, but lightly ride  
  Sped by the Muses of the violet crown,  
And men to come, while earth and sun abide,  
  Who cherish song shall cherish thy renown.  
Yea, I have given thee wings I and in return  
  Thou givest me the scorn with which I burn."  
              *Theognis Gnomai*, lines 237-254,  
              *trans. by G. Lowes Dickinson*.

### SAPPHO

AS Theognis had his well-loved disciples, so had the poetess Sappho (600
B. c.). Her devotion to her girl-friends and companions is indeed
proverbial.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

"What Alcibiades and Charmides and Phædrus were to Socrates, Gyrinna and
Atthis and Anactoria were to the Lesbian." *Max Tyrius, quoted in H. T.
Wharton's Sappho*, p. 23.

Perhaps the few lines of Sappho, translated or paraphrased by Catullus
under the title *To Lesbia*, form the most celebrated fragment of her
extant work. They may be roughly rendered thus:--

"Peer of all the gods unto me appeareth  
He of men who sitting beside thee heareth  
Close at hand thy syllabled words sweet spoken,  
         Or loving laughter--

"That sweet laugh which flutters my heart and bosom.  
For, at sight of thee, in an instant fail me  
Voice and speech, and under my skin there courses  
         Swiftly a thin flame;

"Darkness is on my eyes, in my ears a drumming,  
Drenched in sweat my frame, my body trembling;  
Paler ev'n than grass--’tis, I doubt, but little  
         From death divides me."

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

### ANACREON TO BATHYLLUS

SEVERAL of the odes of Anacreon (B.C. 520) are addressed to his young
friend Bathyllus. The following short one has been preserved to us by
Athenæus (bk. xiii. § 17):--

"O boy, with virgin-glancing eye,  
  I call thee, but thou dost not hear;  
Thou know'st not how my soul doth cry  
  For thee, its charioteer."

Anacreon had not the passion and depth of Sappho, but there is a mark of
genuine feeling in some of his poems, as in this simple little
epigram:--

"On their hindquarters horses  
  Are branded oft with fire,  
And any one knows a Parthian  
  Because he wears a tiar;  
And I at sight of lovers  
  Their nature can declare,  
For in their hearts they too  
  Some subtle flame-mark bear."

The following fragment is from Pindar's Ode to his young friend
Theoxenos--in whose arms Pindar is said to have died (B.C. 442):--

"O soul, 'tis thine in season meet,  
O pluck of love the blossom sweet,  
When hearts are young: <span id="page_73">p. 73</span>  
But he who sees the blazing beams,  
The light that from *that* forehead streams,  
  And is not stung;--  
Who is not storm-tossed with desire,--  
Lo! he, I ween, with frozen fire,  
Of adamant or stubborn steel  
Is forged in his cold heart that cannot feel."  
             *Trans. by F. Addington Symonds*,  
             *The Greek Poets*, vol. I, p. 286.

### EPIGRAMS OF PLATO

PLATO'S epigrams on Aster and Agathon are well known. The two
first-quoted make a play of course on the name Aster (star).

To Aster:

"Thou wert the morning star among the living,  
Ere thy fair light had fled;  
Now, having died, thou art as Hesperus, giving  
New splendor to the dead." (*Shelley*.)

To the same:

"Thou at the stars dost gaze, who art my star--O would that I were  
Heaven, to gaze on thee, ever with thousands of eyes."

To Agathon:

"Thee as I kist, behold! on my lips my own soul was trembling;  
For, bold one, she had come, meaning to find her way through."

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

### MELEAGER

There are many other epigrams and songs on the same subject from the
Greek writers. The following is by Meleager (a native of Gadara in
Palestine) about 6o B. c., and one of the sweetest and most human of the
lyric poets:--

"O mortals crossed in love! the Southwind, see!  
That blows so fair for sailor folk, hath ta'en  
Half of my soul, Andragathos, from me.  
Thrice happy ships, thrice blesséd billowy main,  
And four times favored wind that bears the youth,  
O would I were a Dolphin! so, in truth,  
High on my shoulders ferried he should come  
To Rhodes, sweet haunt of boys, his island home."  
             *From the Greek Anthology*, ii. 402.

Also from the Greek Anthology:--

"O say, and again repeat, fair, fair--and still I will say it--  
How fair, my friend, and good to see, thou art;  
On pine or oak or wall thy name I do not blazon--  
Love has too deeply graved it in my heart."

### EPITAPH ANONYMOUS

Perhaps the most beautiful \[says J. A. Symonds\] of the sepulchral
epigrams is one by an

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

unknown writer, of which I here give a free paraphrase. *Anth. Pal.*,
vii. 346:--

"'Of our great love, Parthenophil,  
This little stone abideth still  
  Sole sign and token:  
I seek thee yet, and yet shall seek,  
Tho' faint mine eyes, my spirit weak  
  With prayers unspoken.

"'Meanwhile best friend or friends, do thou,  
If this the cruel fates allow,  
  By death's dark river,  
Among those shadowy people, drink  
No drop for me on Lethe's brink:  
  Forget me never!'"  
           *The Greek Poets*, Vol. 2, p. 298.

### THEOCRITUS' IDYLS

THEOCRITUS, though coming late in the Greek age (about 300 B.C.) when
Athens had yielded place to Alexandria, still carried on the Greek
tradition in a remarkable way. A native of Syracuse, he caught and
echoed in a finer form the life and songs of the country folk of that
region--themselves descendants of [Dorian](errata.htm#0) settlers. Songs
and ballads full of similar notes linger among the Greek peasants,
shepherds and fisher-folk, even down to the present day.

The following poem (trans. by M. J. Chapman,

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

1836\) is one of the best known and most beautiful of his Idyls:--

IDYL XII

"Art come, dear youth? two days and nights away!  
(Who burn with love, grow aged in a day.)  
As much as apples sweet the damson crude  
Excel; the blooming spring the winter rude;  
In fleece the sheep her lamb; the maiden in sweetness  
The thrice-wed dame; the fawn the calf in fleetness;  
The nightingale in song all feathered kind--  
So much thy longed-for presence cheers my mind.  
To thee I hasten, as to shady beech,  
The traveller, when from the heaven's reach  
The sun fierce blazes. May our love be strong,  
To all hereafter times the theme of song!  
'Two men each other loved to that degree,  
That either friend did in the other see  
A dearer than himself. They lived of old  
Both golden natures in an age of gold.'

"O father Zeus! ageless immortals all!  
Two hundred ages hence may one recall,  
Down-coming to the irremeable river,  
This to my mind, and this good news deliver:  
'E’en now from east to west, from north to south,  
Your mutual friendship lives in every mouth.'  
This, as they please, th' Olympians will decide: <span id="page_77">p.
77</span>  
Of thee, by blooming virtue beautified,  
My glowing song shall only truth disclose;  
With falsehood's pustules I'll not shame my nose.  
If thou dost sometime grieve me, sweet the pleasure  
Of reconcilement, joy in double measure  
To find thou never didst intend the pain,  
And feel myself from all doubt free again.

"And ye Megarians, at Nisæa dwelling,  
Expert at rowing, mariners excelling,  
Be happy ever! for with honors due  
Th' Athenian Diocles, to friendship true  
Ye celebrate. With the first blush of spring  
The youth surround his tomb: there who shall bring  
The sweetest kiss, whose lip is purest found,  
Back to his mother goes with garlands crowned.  
Nice touch the arbiter must have indeed,  
And must, methinks, the blue-eyed Ganymede  
Invoke with many prayers--a mouth to own  
True to the touch of lips, as Lydian stone  
To proof of gold--which test will instant show  
The pure or base, as money changers know."

The following Idyl, of which I append a rendering, is attributed to
Theocritus:--

IDYL XXIX

They say, dear boy, that wine and truth agree;  
And, being in wine, I'll tell the truth to thee-- <span id="page_78">p.
78</span>  
Yes, all that works in secret in my soul.  
'Tis this: thou dost not love me with thy whole  
Untampered heart. I know; for half my time  
Is spent in gazing on thy beauty's prime;  
The other half is nought. When thou art good,  
My days are like the gods'; but when the mood  
Tormenting takes thee, 'tis my night of woe.  
How were it right to vex a lover so?  
Take my advice, my lad, thine elder friend,  
'Twill make thee glad and grateful in the end:  
In one tree build one nest, so no grim snake  
May creep upon thee. For to-day thou'lt make  
Thy home on one branch, and to-morrow changing  
wilt seek another, to what's new still ranging;  
And should a stranger praise your handsome face,  
Him more than three-year-proven friend you'll grace,  
While him who loved you first you'll treat as cold  
As some acquaintanceship of three days old.  
Thou fliest high, methinks, in love and pride;  
But I would say: keep ever at thy side  
A mate that is thine equal; doing so,  
The townsfolk shall speak well of thee alway,  
And love shall never visit thee with woe--  
Love that so easily men's hearts can flay,  
And mine has conquered that was erst of steel.  
Nay, by thy gracious lips I make appeal:  
Remember thou wert younger a year agone <span id="page_79">p.
79</span>  
And we grow grey and wrinkled, all, or e'er  
We can escape our doom; of mortals none  
His youth retakes again, for azure wings  
Are on her shoulders, and we sons of care  
Are all too slow to catch such flying things.

Mindful of this, be gentle, is my prayer,  
And love me, guileless, ev'n as I love thee;  
So when thou hast a beard, such friends as were  
Achilles and Patroclus we may be."

### BION

BION was a poet of about the same period as Theocritus, but of whom
little is known. The following is a fragment translated by A. Lang:--

"Happy are they that love, when with equal love they are rewarded. Happy
was Theseus, when Pirithous was by is side, yea tho' he went down to the
house of implacable Hades. Happy among hard men and inhospitable was
Orestes, for that Pylades chose to share his wanderings. And he was
happy, Achilles Æacides, while his darling lived,--happy was he in his
death, because he avenged the dread fate of Patroclus." *Theocritus,
Bion and Moschus, Golden Treasury series*, p. 182.

### LAMENT FOR BION BY MOSCHUS

The beautiful *Lament for Bion* by Moschus is interesting in this
connection, and should be compared

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

with Shelley's lament for Keats in *Adonais*--for which latter poem
indeed it supplied some suggestions:--

Ye mountain valleys, pitifully groan!  
Rivers and Dorian springs for Bion weep!  
Ye plants drop tears! ye groves lamenting moan!  
Exhale your life, wan flowers; your blushes deep  
In grief, anemonies and roses, steep!  
In softest murmurs, Hyacinth! prolong  
The sad, sad woe thy lettered petals keep;  
Our minstrel sings no more his friends among  
Sicilian muses! now begin the doleful song."  
                 *M. F. Chapman trans. in the*  
                 *Greek Pastoral Poets*, 1836.

The allusion to Hyacinth is thus explained by Chapman:--

"Hyacinthus, a Spartan youth, the son of Clio, was in great favor with
Apollo. Zephyrus, being enraged that he preferred Apollo to him, blew
the discus when flung by Apollo, on a day that Hyacinthus was playing at
discus-throwing with that god, against the head of the youth, and so
killed him. Apollo, being unable to save his life, changed him into the
flower which was named after him, and on whose petals the Greeks fancied
they could trace the notes of grief. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4) A
festival called the Hyacinthia was celebrated for three

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

days in each year at Sparta, in honor of the god and his unhappy
favorite." *Note to Moschus*, Idyl iii.

### TOLD BY OVID

The story of Apollo and Hyacinth is gracefully told by Ovid, in the
tenth book of his Metamorphoses:--

"Midway betwixt the past and coming night  
Stood Titan <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5) when the pair, their limbs
unrobed,  
And glistning with the olive's unctuous juice,  
In friendly contest with the discus vied."

\[The younger one is struck by the discus; and like a fading flower\]

"To its own weight unequal drooped the head  
Of Hyacinth; and o'er him wailed the god:--  
Liest thou so, Œbalia's child, of youth  
Untimely robbed, and wounded by my fault--  
At once my grief and guilt?--This hand hath dealt  
Thy death! 'Tis I who send thee to the grave!  
And yet scarce guilty, unless guilt it were  
To sport, or guilt to love thee! Would this life  
Might thine redeem, or be with thine resigned!  
But thou--since Fate denies a god to die--  
Be present with me ever! Let thy name <span id="page_82">p. 82</span>  
Dwell ever in my heart and on my lips,  
Theme of my lyre and burden of my song;  
And ever bear the echo of my wail  
Wt on thy new-born flower! The time shall come  
When, with thyself associate, to its name  
The mightiest of the Greeks shall link his own.  
Prophetic as Apollo mourned, the blood  
That with its dripping crimson dyed the turf  
Was blood no more: and sudden sprang to life  
A flower."  
                   *Ovid's Metamorphoses trans*.  
                   *H. King, London*, 1871.

### VIRGIL ECLOGUE II

IN Roman literature, generally, as might be expected, with its more
materialistic spirit, the romance of friendship is little dwelt upon;
though the grosser side of the passion, in such writers as Catullus and
Martial, is much in evidence. Still we find in Virgil a notable
instance. His 2nd Eclogue bears the marks of genuine feeling; and,
according to some critics, he there under the guise of Shepherd
Corydon's love for Alexis celebrates his own attachment to the youthful
Alexander:--

Corydon, keeper of cattle, once loved the fair lad Alexis;  
But he, the delight of his master, permitted no hope to the shepherd.
<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>  
Corydon, lovesick swain, went into the forest of beeches,  
And there to the mountains and woods--the one relief of his passion--  
With useless effort outpoured the following artless complainings:--  
Alexis, barbarous youth, say, do not my mournful lays move thee?  
Showing me no compassion, thou'lt surely compel me to perish.  
Even the cattle now seek after places both cool and shady;  
Even the lizards green conceal themselves in the thorn-bush.  
Thestylis, taking sweet herbs, such as garlic and thyme, for the
reapers  
Faint with the scorching noon, doth mash them and bray in a mortar.  
Alone in the heat of the day am I left with the screaming cicalas,  
While patients in tracking thy path, I ever pursue thee, Belovéd."  
                         *Trans. by J. W. Baylis*.

### CORYDON AND ALEXIS

There is a translation of this same 2nd Eclogue, by Abraham Fraunce
(1591), which is interesting not only on account of its felicity of
phrase, but because, as in the case of some other Elizabethan
hexameters, the metre is ruled by *quantity*, *i.e.*, length of
syllables, instead of by *accent*. The

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

following are the first five lines of Fraunce's translation:--

Silly shepherd Corydon lov'd hartyly fayre lad Alexis,  
His master's dearling, but saw noe matter of hoping;  
Only amydst darck groves thickset with broade shadoe beech-trees  
Dayly resort did he make, thus alone to the woods, to the mountyns  
With broken speeches fond thoughts there vaynly revealing."

CATULLUS also (b. B.C. 87) has some verses of real feeling:--

"Quintius, if 'tis thy wish and will  
  That I should owe my eyes to thee,  
Or anything that's dearer still,  
  If aught that's dearer there can be;

"Then rob me not of that I prize,  
  Of the dear form that is to me,  
Oh! far far dearer than my eyes,  
  Or aught, if dearer aught there be."  
    *Catullus, trans. Hon. F. Lamb*, 1821.

"If all complying, thou would'st grant  
  Thy lovely eyes to kiss, my fair,  
Long as I pleased; oh! I would plant  
  Three hundred thousand kisses there.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

"Nor could I even then refrain,  
  Nor satiate leave that fount of blisses,  
Tho' thicker than autumnal grain  
  Should be our growing crop of kisses."  
                                       (*Ibid*.)

### TO LICINIUS

  "Long at our leisure yesterday  
Idling, Licinius, we wrote  
Upon my tablets verses gay,  
Or took our turns, as fancy smote,  
At rhymes and dice and wine.

  "But when I left, Licinius mine,  
Your grace and your facetious mood  
Had fired me so, that neither food  
Would stay my misery, nor sleep  
My roving eyes in quiet keep.  
But still consumed, without respite,  
I tossed about my couch in vain  
And longed for day--if speak I might,  
Or be with you again.

  "But when my limbs with all the strain  
Worn out, half dead lay on my bed,  
Sweet friend to thee this verse I penned,  
That so thou mayest condescend  
To understand my pain.

  "So now, Licinius, beware!  
And be not rash, but to my prayer  
A gracious hearing tender; <span id="page_86">p. 86</span>  
Lest on thy head pounce Nemesis:  
A goddess sudden and swift she is  
Beware lest thou offend her!"

### MARTIAL TO DIADUMENOS

The following little poem is taken from Martial:--

As a vineyard breathes, whose boughs with grapes are bending,  
Or garden where are hived Sicanian bees;  
As upturned clods when summer rain's descending  
Or orchards rich with blossom-laden trees;  
So, cruel youth, thy kisses breathe--so sweet--  
Would'st thou but grant me all their grace, complete!"
