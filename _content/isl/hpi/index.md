*Islam in the first four centuries, ... was inclined to take into its
possession not only the outward advantages of the world, but also the
intellectual acquisitions of Mankind.* ([p. 71](hpi11.htm#page_71)).

This is a well-written and authoritative review of the history of
Islamic philosophy during the middle ages. Medieval Islamic civilization
at its height was a center of learning, and its philosophers were no
exception. Islamic philosophers grappled with issues such as free-will,
causality and the nature of reality. Some of these figures are still
well-known, such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Roshd (Averroes), the Sufi
Gazali, and Kindi.

These thinkers drew on many sources, including Indian philosophy (such
as the [Upanishads](../../hin/upan/index)) and the ancient Greek
philosophers, particularly [Aristotle](../../cla/ari/index), whose works
were considered the highest authority. In turn, Aristotelianism was
picked up by by the Catholic Church and virtually enshrined as doctrine,
particularly in the realm of natural science. This endured until the
experimental method was used to test Aristotle in the renaissance, and
his dominance was overthrown.
