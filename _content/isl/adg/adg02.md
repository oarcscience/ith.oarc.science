In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.  
  
To

To the garden of wisdom that had grown up and flooded, and flooded, to
the wise man whose tongue bled with abundant wisdom, to him whose adages
and sermons lighted up from his honourable mouth like pearly drops.  
To the one who filled life with his wisdom, and hugged the minds, the
minds of his companions, and delivered them to the wider upper fields, I
mean knowledge.  
To the one who enriched the Arabic language with his eloquent speech.  
To the master of eloquent ones and the prince of the wise men.  
To the prince of believers  
To him...  
I raise this little of what was collected from the pearls of his wisdom
and the magnificent of his sermons.
