<p>The prince of believers  (puh) said:</p>  
<p>1. Richness and poverty  shall be after being judges by Allah.<br> 2. Poverty is the grand death.<br> 3. The most honourable richness is to leave the pride (about it).<br> 4. May there be a poor man who is richer than every rich man.<br> 5. The richest richness, the satisfaction (about what one has).<br> 6. No richness with the bad planning.<br> 7. Money is the amusement of the heirs.<br> 8. Richness makes authority for someone other than the master.<br> 9. Got rich who was satisfied about destiny.<br> 10. No poverty with good planning.<br> 11. He is not poor who has a good understanding.<br> 12. A person does not dignify himself until he humiliates his money.<br> 13. Who depended on Allah is in no need for His slaves.<br> 14. No pride in money except with generosity.<br> 15. He is not given money who does not spend it.<br> 16. Fortune is not gained by wishing.<br> 17. He did not gain money who does not fix it.<br> 18. No richness with squandering.<br> 19. No poverty with chastity.<br> 20. No poverty for a wise man.<br> 21. A rich man is not saved from death for the money he has.<br> 22. Be satisfied and you shall be rich.<br> 23. How many a rich man are there that are useless.<br> 24. No richness for an ignorant.<br> 25. He shall not be poor who is a monk.<br> 26. Every miser is a poor man.<br> 27. Satisfaction (about what one has) is linked to richness.<br> 28. The damage of poverty is safer than the evil of richness.<br> 29. The most devilish of money is what brings the curses.<br> 30. The deeds of money shall vanish when it (money) vanishes.<br> 31. The bad planning is the key to poverty.<br> 32. The reason for poverty, squandering.<br> 33. The zakat (almsgiving) of money, is to give. [Zakat in general means  something that purifies the money].<br> 34. May there be a rich man who is poorer than the poor.<br> 35. May there be a poverty that gains the richness.<br> 36. May there be a richness that brings the poverty.<br> 37. The dirham of the poor man is beloved to Allah more than the dinar of the  rich man. [A dinar is equal to 10 dirhams].</p>  
<p>38. The best richness is  the richness of the soul.<br> 39. The love of money worsens the end.</p>
