<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hast</span> thou heard that in the time of old<br> The sheep dwelling in a certain pasture<br> So increased and multiplied<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">540</FONT></span> That they feared no enemy?<br> At last, from the malice of Fate,<br> Their breasts were smitten by a shaft of calamity.<br> The tigers sprang forth from the jungle<br> And rushed upon the sheepfold.</p>

<p>Conquest and dominion are signs of strength, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">545</FONT></span><br> Victory is the manifestation of strength.<br> Those fierce tigers beat the drum of sovereignty,<br> They deprived the sheep of freedom.<br> Forasmuch as tigers must have their prey,<br> That meadow was crimsoned with the blood of the sheep. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">550</FONT></span><br> One of the sheep which was clever and acute,<br> Old in years, cunning as a weather-beaten wolf,<br> Being grieved at the fate of his fellows<br> And sorely vexed by the violence of the tigers,<br> Made complaint of the course of Destiny <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">555</FONT></span><br> And sought by craft to restore his fortunes.<br> The weak man, in order to preserve himself,</p>

<p>Seeks devices from skilled intelligence.<br> In slavery, for the sake of repelling harm,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">560</FONT></span> The power of scheming becomes quickened,<br> And when the madness of revenge gains hold,<br> The mind of the slave meditates rebellion.<br> "Ours is a hard knot," said this sheep to himself,<br> "The ocean of our griefs hath no shore.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">565</FONT></span> By force we sheep cannot escape from the tiger:<br> Our legs are silver, his paws are steel.<br> &#146;Tis not possible, however much one exhorts and counsels,<br> To create in a sheep the disposition of a wolf.<br> But to make the furious tiger a sheep&#151;that is possible;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">570</FONT></span> To make him unmindful of his nature&#151;that is possible."</p>
