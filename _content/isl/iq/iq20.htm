<p>At one stroke thereof water gushes from the rock<br> And the sea becomes land from dearth of moisture. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1540</FONT></span><br> Moses held this sword in his hand,<br> Therefore he wrought more than man may contrive.<br> He clove the Red Sea asunder<br> And made its waters like dry earth.<br> The arm of Ali, the conqueror of Khaibar, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1545</FONT></span><br> Drew its strength from this same sword.<br> The revolution of the sky is visible,<br> The change of day and night is perceived.<br> Look, O thou enthralled by Yesterday and To-morrow,<br> Behold another world in thine own heart! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1550</FONT></span><br> Thou hast sown the seed of darkness in thy clay,<br> Thou hast imagined Time as a line:<br> Thy thought measures length of Time<br> With the measure of night and day.</p>

<p>Life is a part of the contents of Time's consciousness.<br> The cause of Time is not the revolution of the sun:<br> Time is everlasting, but the sun does not last for ever.<br> Time is joy and sorrow, festival and fast;<br> Time is the secret of moonlight and sunlight. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1570</FONT></span><br> Thou hast extended Time, like Space,<br> And distinguished Yesterday from To-morrow.<br> Thou hast fled, like a scent, from thine own garden;<br> Thou hast made thy prison with thine own hand.<br> Our Time, which has neither beginning nor end, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1575</FONT></span><br> Blossoms from the flower-bed of our mind.<br> To know its root quickens the living with new life:</p>

<p>Its being is more splendid than the dawn.<br> Life is of Time, and Time is of Life:<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1580</FONT></span> "Do not abuse Time!" was the command of the Prophet.<br> Oh, the memory of those days when Time's sword<br> Was allied with the strength of our hands!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> We sowed the seed of religion in men's hearts<br> And unveiled the face of Truth;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1585</FONT></span> Our nails tore loose the knot of this world,<br> Our bowing in prayer gave blessings to the earth.<br> From the jar of Truth we made rosy wine gush forth,<br> We charged against the ancient taverns.<br> O thou in whose cup is old wine,</p>  
<p>

<p>Do not look with contempt on our beggarliness!<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1605</FONT></span> In thine eyes we are good for nothing,<br> Thinking old thoughts, despicable.<br> We have honour from "There is no god but Allah,"<br> We are the preservers of the universe.<br> Freed from the vexation of to-day and to-morrow,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1610</FONT></span> We have pledged ourselves to love One.<br> We are the conscience hidden in God's heart,<br> We are the heirs of Moses and Aaron.<br> Sun and moon are still bright with our radiance,<br> Lightning-flashes still lurk in our cloud.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1615</FONT></span> Our essence is the mirror of the Divine essence:<br> The Moslem's being is one of the signs of God.</p>
