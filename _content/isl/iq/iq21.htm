<p align="center"><i>An invocation</i>.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">O Thou</span> that art as the soul in the body of the universe,<br> Thou art our soul and thou art ever fleeing from us.<br> Thou breathest music into Life's lute;<br> Life envies Death when death is for thy sake. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1620</FONT></span><br> Once more bring comfort to our sad hearts,<br> Once more dwell in our breasts!<br> Once more let us hear thy call to honour,<br> Strengthen our weak love.<br> We are oft complaining of destiny, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1625</FONT></span></p>

<p>Thou art of great price and we have naught.<br> Hide not thy fair face from the empty-handed!<br> Sell cheap the love of Salm&aacute;n and Bil&aacute;l!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Give us the sleepless eye and the passionate heart,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1630</FONT></span> Give us again the nature of quicksilver!<br> Show unto us one of thy manifest signs,<br> That the necks of our enemies may be bowed!<br> Make this chaff a mountain crested with fire,<br> Burn with our fire all that is not God!<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1635</FONT></span> When the people let the clue of Unity go from their hands,<br> They fell into a hundred mazes.<br> We are dispersed like stars in the world;<br> Though of the same family, we are strange to one another.</p>

<p>Bind again these scattered leaves,<br> Revive the law of love! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1640</FONT></span><br> Take us back to serve thee as of old,<br> Commit thy cause to them that love thee!<br> We are travellers: give us devotion as our goal!<br> Give us the strong faith of Abraham!<br> Make us know the meaning of "There is no god," <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1645</FONT></span><br> Make us acquainted with the mystery of "except Allah"!<br> I who burn like a candle for the sake of others<br> Teach myself to weep like the candle.<br> O God! a tear that is heart-enkindling,<br> Passionful, wrung forth by pain, peace-consuming, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1650</FONT></span><br> May I sow in the garden, and may it grow into a fire<br> That washes away the fire-brand from the tulip's robe!</p>

<p>My heart is with yestereve, my eye is on to-morrow:<br> Amidst the company I am alone.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1655</FONT></span> "Every one fancies he is my friend,<br> But my secret thoughts have not escaped from my heart."<br> Oh, where in the wide world is my comrade?<br> I am the Bush of Sinai: where is my Moses?<br> I am tyrannous, I have done many a wrong to myself,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1660</FONT></span> I have nourished a flame in my bosom,<br> A flame that seized the furniture of judgement,<br> And cast fire on the skirt of discretion,<br> And lessoned with madness the reason,<br> And burned up the existence of knowledge:<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1665</FONT></span> Its blaze enthrones the sun in the sky,<br> And lightnings encircle it with adoration for ever.<br> Mine eye fell to weeping, like dew,</p>

<p>Since I was entrusted with that hidden fire.<br> I taught the candle to burn openly,<br> While I myself burned unseen by the world's eye. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1670</FONT></span><br> At last flames breathed from every hair of me,<br> Fire dropped from the veins of my thought:<br> My nightingale picked up the spark-grains<br> And created a fire-tempered song.<br> Is the breast of this age without a heart? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1675</FONT></span><br> Majn&uacute;n trembles lest Lail&aacute;'s howdah be empty.<br> It is not easy for the candle to throb alone:<br> Ah, is there no moth worthy of me?<br> How long shall I wait for one to share my grief?<br> How long must I search for a confidant? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1680</FONT></span></p>

<p>O Thou whose face lends light to the moon and the stars,<br> Withdraw thy fire from my soul!<br> Take back what Thou hast put in my breast,<br> Remove the stabbing radiance from my mirror,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1685</FONT></span> Or give me one old comrade<br> To be the mirror of mine all-burning love!<br> In the sea wave tosses side by side with wave:<br> Each hath a partner in its emotion.<br> In heaven star consorts with star,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1690</FONT></span> And the bright moon lays her head on the knees of Night.<br> Morning touches Night's dark side,<br> And To-day throws itself against To-morrow.<br> One river loses its being in another,<br> A waft of air dies in perfume.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1695</FONT></span> There is dancing in every nook of the wine-house,<br> Madman dances with madman.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_147"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Howbeit in thine essence Thou art single,<br> Thou hast decked out for Thyself a whole world.<br> I am as the tulip of the field,<br> In the midst of a company I am alone. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1700</FONT></span><br> I beg of Thy grace a sympathising friend,<br> An adept in the mysteries of my nature,<br> A friend endowed with madness and wisdom,<br> One that knoweth not the phantom of vain things,<br> That I may confide my lament to his soul <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1705</FONT></span><br> And see again my face in his heart.<br> His image I will mould of mine own clay,<br> I will be to him both idol and worshipper.</p>
