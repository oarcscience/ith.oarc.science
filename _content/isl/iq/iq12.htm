<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">815</FONT></span> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Service</span> and toil are traits of the camel,<br> Patience and perseverance are ways of the camel.<br> Noiselessly he steps along the sandy track,<br> He is the ship of those who voyage in the desert.<br> Every thicket knows the print of his foot:<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">820</FONT></span> He eats seldom, sleeps little, and is inured to toil.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>He carries rider, baggage, and litter;<br> He trots on and on to the journey's end,<br> Rejoicing in his speed,<br> More patient in travel than his rider.<br> Thou, too, do not refuse the burden of Duty: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">825</FONT></span><br> So wilt thou enjoy the best dwelling-place, which is with God.<br> Endeavour to obey, O heedless one!<br> Liberty is the fruit of compulsion.<br> By obedience the man of no worth is made worthy;<br> By disobedience his fire is turned to ashes. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">830</FONT></span><br> Whoso would master the sun and stars,<br> Let him make himself a prisoner of Law!<br> The wind is enthralled by the fragrant rose;<br> The perfume is confined in the navel of the musk-deer.<br> The star moves towards its goal <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">835</FONT></span><br> With head bowed in surrender to a law.</p>

<p>The grass springs up in obedience to the law of growth:<br> When it abandons that, it is trodden underfoot.<br> To burn unceasingly is the law of the tulip,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">840</FONT></span> And so the blood leaps in its veins.<br> Drops of water become a sea by the law of union,<br> And grains of sand become a Sahara.<br> Since Law makes everything strong within,<br> Why dost thou neglect this source of strength?<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">845</FONT></span> O thou that art emancipated from the old Custom,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Adorn thy feet once more with the same fine silver chain!<br> Do not complain of the hardness of the Law,<br> Do not transgress the statutes of Mohammed!</p>

<p>Though single, he is like a host in onset:<br> Life is cheaper in his eyes than wind.<br> The profession of Faith is the shell, but<br> prayer is the pearl: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">875</FONT></span><br> The Moslem's heart deems prayer a lesser pilgrimage.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> In the Moslem's hand prayer is like a dagger<br> Killing sin and frowardness and wrong.<br> Fasting makes an assault upon hunger and thirst<br> And breaches the citadel of sensuality. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">880</FONT></span><br> The pilgrimage enlightens the minds of the Faithful:<br> It teaches separation from one's home and destroys attachment to one's native land;<br> It is an act of devotion in which all feel themselves to be one,<br> It binds together the leaves of the book of religion.</p>
