<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">When</span> the Self is made strong by Love<br> Its power rules the whole world.<br> The Heavenly Sage who adorned the sky with stars <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">485</FONT></span><br> Plucked these buds from the bough of the Self.<br> Its hand becomes God's hand,<br> The moon is split by its fingers.<br> It is the arbitrator in all the quarrels of the world,<br> Its command is obeyed by Darius and Jamsh&iacute;d. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">490</FONT></span></p>

<p>I will tell thee a story of B&uacute; Ali,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Whose name is renowned in India,<br> Him who sang of the ancient rose-garden<br> And discoursed to us about the lovely rose:<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">495</FONT></span> The air of his fluttering skirt<br> Made a Paradise of this fire-born country.<br> His young disciple went one day to the bazaar&#151;<br> The wine of B&uacute; Ali's discourse had turned his head.<br> The governor of the city was coming along on horseback,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">500</FONT></span> His servant and staff-bearer rode beside him.<br> The forerunner shouted, "O senseless one,<br> Do not get in the way of the governor's escort!"</p>

<p>But the dervish walked on with drooping head,<br> Sunk in the sea of his own thoughts.<br> The staff-bearer, drunken with pride, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">505</FONT></span><br> Broke his staff on the head of the dervish,<br> Who stepped painfully out of the governor's way,<br> Sad and sorry, with a heavy heart.<br> He came to B&uacute; Ali and complained<br> And released the tears from his eyes. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">510</FONT></span><br> Like lightning that falls on mountains,<br> The Sheikh poured forth a fiery torrent of speech.<br> He let loose from his soul a strange fire,<br> He gave an order to his secretary:<br> Take thy pen and write a letter <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">515</FONT></span><br> From a dervish to a sultan!<br> Say, 'Thy governor has broken my servant's head;<br> He has cast burning coals on his own life.</p>

<p>Arrest this wicked governor,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">520</FONT></span> Or else I will bestow thy kingdom on another.'"<br> The letter of the saint who had access to God<br> Caused the monarch to tremble in every limb.<br> His body was filled with aches,<br> He grew as pale as the evening sun.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">525</FONT></span> He sought out a handcuff for the governor<br> And entreated B&uacute; Ali to pardon this offence.<br> Khusrau, the sweet-voiced eloquent poet,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Whose harmonies flow from the creative mind<br> And whose genius hath the soft brilliance of moonlight,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">530</FONT></span> Was chosen to be the king's ambassador.</p>

<p>When he entered B&uacute; Ali's presence and played his lute,<br> His song melted the fakir's soul like glass.<br> One strain of poesy bought the grace<br> Of a majesty that was firm as a mountain.<br> Do not wound the hearts of dervishes, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">535</FONT></span><br> Do not throw thyself into burning fire!</p>
