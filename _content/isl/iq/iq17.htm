<p align="center"><i>Story of the Sheikh and the Brahmin, followed by a conversation between Ganges and Himalaya to the effect that the continuation of social life depends on firm attachment to the characteristic traditions of the community</i>.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">At</span> Benares lived a venerable Brahmin,<br> Whose head was deep in the ocean of Being and Not-being.<br> He had a large knowledge of philosophy<br> But was well-disposed to the seekers after God.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1235</FONT></span> His mind was eager to explore new problems,<br> His intellect moved on a level with the Pleiades;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A></p>  
<p>His nest was as high as that of the Ank&aacute;;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Sun and moon were cast, like rue, on the flame of his thought.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> For a long time he laboured and sweated,<br> But philosophy brought no wine to his Cup. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1240</FONT></span><br> Although he set many a snare in the gardens of learning,<br> His snares never caught a glimpse of the Ideal bird;<br> And notwithstanding that the nails of his thought were dabbled with blood,<br> The knot of Being and Not-being remained untied.<br> The sighs on his lips bore witness to his despair, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1245</FONT></span><br> His countenance told tales of his distraction.<br> One day he visited an excellent Sheikh,</p>

<p>A man who had in his breast a heart of gold.<br> The Sheikh laid the seal of silence on his lips<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1250</FONT></span> While he lent his ear to the Sage's discourse.<br> Then he said: "O wanderer in the lofty sky,<br> Pledge thyself to be true, for a little, to the earth!<br> Thou hast lost thy way in wildernesses of speculation,<br> Thy fearless thought hath passed beyond Heaven.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1255</FONT></span> Be reconciled with earth, O sky-traveller!<br> Do not wander in quest of the essence of the stars!<br> I do not bid thee abandon thine idols.<br> Art thou an unbeliever? Then be worthy of the badge of unbelief!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p>O inheritor of ancient culture,<br> Turn not thy back on the path thy fathers trod! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1260</FONT></span><br> If a people's life is derived from unity,<br> Unbelief too is a source of unity.<br> Thou that art not even a perfect infidel<br> Art unfit to worship at the shrine of the spirit.<br> We both are far astray from the road of devotion: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1265</FONT></span><br> Thou art far from &Aacute;zar, and I from Abraham.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Our Majn&uacute;n hath not fallen into melancholy for his Lail&aacute;'s sake:<br> He hath not become perfect in the madness of love.<br> When the lamp of Self expires,<br> What is the use of heaven-surveying imagination?" <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1270</FONT></span><br> Once on a time, laying hold of the skirt of the mountain,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Ganges said to Himalaya:<br> "O thou mantled in snow since the morn of creation,<br> Thou whose form is girdled with streams,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1275</FONT></span> God made thee a partner in the secrets of heaven,<br> But deprived thy foot of graceful gait.<br> He took away from thee the power to walk:<br> What avails this sublimity and stateliness?<br> Life springs from perpetual movement:<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1280</FONT></span> Motion constitutes the wave's whole existence."<br> When the mountain heard this taunt from the river,<br> He puffed angrily like a sea of fire,<br> And answered: "Thy wide waters are my looking-glass;<br> Within my bosom are a hundred rivers like thee.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A></p>  
<p>This graceful gait of thine is an instrument of death: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1285</FONT></span><br> Whoso goeth from Self is meet to die.<br> Thou hast no knowledge of thine own case,<br> Thou exultest in thy misfortune: thou art a fool!<br> O born of the womb of the revolving sphere,<br> A fallen-in bank is better than thou! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1290</FONT></span><br> Thou hast made thine existence an offering to the ocean,<br> Thou hast thrown the rich purse of thy life to the highwayman.<br> Be self-contained like the rose in the garden,<br> Do not go to the florist in order to smell sweet!<br> To live is to grow in thyself <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1295</FONT></span><br> And gather roses from thine own flower-bed.<br> Ages have gone by and my foot is fast in earth:</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Dost thou fancy that I am far from my goal?<br> My being grew and reached the sky,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1300</FONT></span> The Pleiads sank to rest under my skirts;<br> Thy being vanishes in the ocean,<br> But on my crest the stars bow their heads.<br> Mine eye sees the mysteries of heaven,<br> Mine ear is familiar with angels&#146; wings.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1305</FONT></span> Since I glowed with the heat of unceasing toil,<br> I amassed rubies, diamonds, and other gems.<br> I am stone within, and in the stone is fire .<br> Water cannot pass over my fire!"<br> Art thou a drop of water? Do not break at thine own feet,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1310</FONT></span> But endeavour to surge and wrestle with the sea.<br> Desire the water of a jewel, become a jewel!</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Be an ear-drop, adorn a beauty!<br> Oh, expand thyself! Move swiftly!<br> Be a cloud that shoots lightning and sheds a flood of rain!<br> Let the ocean sue for thy storms as a beggar, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1315</FONT></span><br> Let it complain of the straitness of thy skirts!<br> Let it deem itself less than a wave<br> And glide along at thy feet!</p>
