### XV

*Showing that the purpose of the Moslem's life is to exalt the Word of
Allah, and that the Jihád (war against unbelievers), if it be prompted
by land-hunger, is unlawful in the religion of Islam*.

<span class="smallcaps">Imbue</span> thine heart with the tincture of
Allah,  
<span class="margnote">1320</span> Give honour and glory to Love!  
The Moslem's nature prevails by means of love:  
The Moslem, if he be not loving, is an infidel.  
Upon God depends his seeing and not- seeing,  
His eating, drinking, and sleeping.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

In his will that which God wills becomes lost—<span
class="margnote">1325</span>  
How shall a man believe this saying?" <span
id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91)  
He encamps in the field of "There is no god but Allah";  
In the world he is a witness against mankind.  
His high estate is attested by the Prophet that was sent to men and
Jinn—  
By the most truthful of witnesses. <span class="margnote">1330</span>  
Leave words and seek that spiritual state,  
Shed the light of God o’er the darkness of works!  
Albeit clad in kingly robe, live as a dervish,  
Live wakeful and meditating on God!  
Whatever thou doest, let it be thine aim therein to draw nigh to God,
<span class="margnote">1335</span>  
That His glory may be made manifest by thee.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

Peace becomes an evil, if its object be aught else;  
War is good if its object is God.  
If God be not exalted by our swords,  
<span class="margnote">1340</span> War dishonours the people.  
The holy Sheikh Miyán Mír Walí, <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92)  
By the light of whose soul every hidden thing was revealed  
His feet were firmly planted on the path of Mohammed,  
He was a flute for the impassioned music of love.  
<span class="margnote">1345</span> His tomb keeps our city safe from
harm  
And causes the beams of true religion to shine on us.  
Heaven stooped its brow to his threshold,  
The Emperor of India was one of his disciples. <span
id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_93)  
Now, this monarch had sown the seed of ambition in his heart  
<span class="margnote">1350</span> And was resolved on conquest.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

The flames of vain desire were alight in him,  
He was teaching his sword to ask, "Is there any more?" <span
id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94)  
In the Deccan was a great noise of war,  
His army stood on the battlefield.  
He went to the Sheikh of heaven-high dignity <span
class="margnote">1355</span>  
That he might receive his blessing:  
The Moslem turns from this world to God  
And strengthens policy with prayer.  
The Sheikh made no answer to the Emperor's speech,  
The assembly of dervishes was all ears, <span
class="margnote">1360</span>  
Until a disciple, in his hand a silver coin,  
Opened his lips and broke the silence,  
Saying, "Accept this poor offering from me,  
O guide of them that have lost the way to God!

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

<span class="margnote">1365</span> My limbs were bathed in sweat of
labour  
Before I put away a dirhem in my skirt."  
The Sheikh said: "This money ought to be given to our Sultan,  
Who is a beggar wearing the raiment of a king.  
Though he holds sway over sun, moon, and stars,  
<span class="margnote">1370</span> Our Emperor is the most penniless of
mankind.  
His eye is fixed on the table of strangers,  
The fire of his hunger hath consumed a whole world.  
His sword is followed by famine and plague,  
His culture lays a wide land waste.  
<span class="margnote">1375</span> The folk are crying out because of
his indigence,  
His empty-headedness, and his oppression of the weak.  
His power is an enemy to all:

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

Humankind are the caravan and he the brigand.  
In his self-delusion and ignorance  
He calls pillage by the name of empire. <span
class="margnote">1380</span>  
Both the royal troops and those of the enemy  
Are cloven in twain by the sword of his hunger.  
The beggar's hunger consumes his own soul,  
But the sultan's hunger destroys state and religion.  
Whoso shall draw the sword for anything except Allah, <span
class="margnote">1385</span>  
His sword is sheathed in his own breast."
