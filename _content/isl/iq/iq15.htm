<p align="center"><i>Story of the bird that was faint with thirst</i>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1145</FONT></span> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A bird</span> was faint with thirst,<br> The breath in his body was heaving like waves of smoke.<br> He saw a diamond in the garden:<br> Thirst created a vision of water.<br> Deceived by the sunbright stone<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1150</FONT></span> The foolish bird fancied that it was water.<br> He got no moisture from the gem:<br> He pecked it with his beak, but it did not wet his palate.<br> "O thrall of vain desire," said the diamond,</p>

<p>"Thou hast sharpened thy greedy beak on me;<br> But I am not a dewdrop, I give no drink, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1155</FONT></span><br> I do not live for the sake of others.<br> Wouldst thou hurt me? Thou art mad!<br> A life that reveals the Self is strange to thee.<br> My water will shiver the beaks of birds<br> And break the jewel of man's life."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1160</FONT></span><br> The bird won not his heart's wish from the diamond<br> And turned away from the sparkling stone.<br> Disappointment swelled in his breast,<br> The song in his throat became a wail.<br> Upon a rose-twig a drop of dew <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1165</FONT></span><br> Gleamed like the tear in a nightingale's eye:<br> All its glitter was owing to the sun,<br> It was trembling in fear of the sun</p>

<p>A restless sky-born star<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1170</FONT></span> That had stopped for a moment, from desire to be seen;<br> Oft deceived by bud and flower,<br> It had gained nothing from Life.<br> There it hung, ready to drop,<br> Like a tear on the eyelashes of a lover who hath lost his heart.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1175</FONT></span> The sorely distressed bird hopped under the rose-bush,<br> The dewdrop trickled into his mouth.<br> O thou that wouldst deliver thy soul from enemies,<br> I ask thee&#151;"Art thou a drop of water or a gem?"<br> When the bird melted in the fire of thirst,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1190</FONT></span> It appropriated the life of another.<br> The drop was not solid and gem-like;<br> The diamond had a being, the drop had none.<br> Never for an instant neglect Self-preservation:</p>

<p>Be a diamond, not a dewdrop!<br> Be massive in nature, like mountains, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1185</FONT></span><br> And bear on thy crest a hundred clouds laden with floods of rain!<br> Save thyself by affirmation of Self,<br> Compress thy quicksilver into silver ore!<br> Produce a melody from the string of Self,<br> Make manifest the secrets of Self! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1190</FONT></span></p>
