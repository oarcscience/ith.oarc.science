### I

*Showing that the system of the universe originates in the Self, and
that the continuation of the life of all individuals depends on
strengthening the Self*.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> form of existence is an effect of the
Self,  
Whatsoever thou seest is a secret of the Self.  
When the Self awoke to consciousness,  
<span class="margnote">190</span> It revealed the universe of Thought.  
A hundred worlds are hidden in its essence:  
Self-affirmation brings Not-self to light.  
By the Self the seed of hostility is sown in the world:  
It imagines itself to be other than itself.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

It makes from itself the forms of others <span
class="margnote">195</span>  
In order to multiply the pleasure of strife.  
It is slaying by the strength of its arm  
That it may become conscious of its own strength.  
Its self-deceptions are the essence of Life;  
Like the rose, it lives by bathing itself in blood. <span
class="margnote">200</span>  
For the sake of a single rose it destroys a hundred rose-gardens  
And makes a hundred lamentations in quest of a single melody.  
For one sky it produces a hundred new moons,  
And for one word a hundred discourses.  
The excuse for this wastefulness and cruelty <span
class="margnote">205</span>  
Is the shaping and perfecting of spiritual beauty.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

The loveliness of Shírín justifies the anguish of Farhád, <span
id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31)  
The fragrant navel justifies a hundred musk-deer.  
’Tis the fate of moths to consume in flame:  
<span class="margnote">210</span> The suffering of moths is justified by
the candle.  
The pencil of the Self limned a hundred to-days  
In order to achieve the dawn of a single morrow.  
Its flames burned a hundred Abrahams <span
id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32)  
That the lamp of one Mohammed might be lighted.  
<span class="margnote">215</span> Subject, object, means, and causes—  
They all exist for the purpose of action.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

The Self rises, kindles, falls, glows, breathes,  
Burns, shines, walks, and flies.  
The spaciousness of Time is its arena,  
Heaven is a billow of the dust on its road. <span
class="margnote">220</span>  
From its rose-planting the world abounds in roses;  
Night is born of its sleep, day springs from its waking.  
It divided its flame into sparks  
And taught the understanding to worship particulars.  
It dissolved itself and created the atoms, <span
class="margnote">225</span>  
It was scattered for a little while and created the sands.  
Then it wearied of dispersion  
And by re-uniting itself it became the mountains.  
’Tis the nature of the Self to manifest itself:  
In every atom slumbers the might of the Self. <span
class="margnote">230</span>

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

Power that is unexpressed and inert  
Chains the faculties which lead to action.  
Inasmuch as the life of the universe  
comes from the strength of the Self,  
Life is in proportion to this strength.  
<span class="margnote">235</span> When a drop of water gets the Self's
lesson by heart,  
It makes its worthless existence a pearl.  
Wine is formless because its self is weak;  
It receives a form by favour of the cup.  
Although the cup of wine assumes a form,  
<span class="margnote">240</span> It is indebted to us for its motion.  
When the mountain loses its self, it turns into sands  
And complains that the sea surges over it;  
But the wave, so long as it remains a wave in the sea's bosom,  
Makes itself a rider on the sea's back.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

Light has been a beggar since the eye first rolled <span
class="margnote">245</span>  
And moved to and fro in search of beauty;  
But forasmuch as the grass found a  
means of growth in its self,  
Its aspiration clove the breast of the garden.  
The candle too concatenated itself  
And built itself out of atoms; <span class="margnote">250</span>  
Then it made a practice of melting  
itself away and fled from its self  
Until at last it trickled down from its own eye, like tears.  
If the bezel had been more self-secure by nature,  
It would not have suffered wounds,  
But since it derives its value from the superscription, <span
class="margnote">255</span>  
Its shoulder is galled by the burden of another's name.  
Because the earth is firmly based on self-existence,

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

The captive moon goes round it perpetually.  
The being of the sun is stronger than that of the earth:  
<span class="margnote">260</span> Therefore is the earth bewitched by
the sun's eye.  
The glory of the plane fixes our gaze,  
The mountains are enriched by its majesty:  
Its raiment is woven of fire,  
Its origin is one self-assertive seed.  
<span class="margnote">265</span> When Life gathers strength from the
Self,  
The river of Life expands into an ocean.
