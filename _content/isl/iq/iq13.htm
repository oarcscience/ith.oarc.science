<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ali</span> is the first Moslem and the King of men, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">965</FONT></span><br> In Love's eyes Ali is the treasure of the Faith.<br> Devotion to his family inspires me with life<br> So that I am as a shining pearl.<br> Like the narcissus, I am enraptured with gazing;<br> Like perfume, I am straying through his pleasure-garden. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">970</FONT></span><br> If holy water gushes from my earth, he is the source;</p>

<p>To become earth is the creed of a moth;<br> Be a conqueror of earth; that alone is worthy of a man.<br> Thou art soft as a rose. Become hard as a stone,<br> That thou mayst be the foundation of the wall of the garden! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1010</FONT></span><br> Build thy clay into a Man,<br> Build thy Man into a World!<br> If thou art unfit to be either a wall or a door,<br> Some one else will make bricks of thine earth.<br> O thou who complainest of the cruelty of Heaven, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1015</FONT></span><br> Thou whose glass cries out against the injustice of the stone,<br> How long this wailing and crying and lamentation?<br> How long this perpetual beating of thy breast?<br> The pith of Life is contained in action,<br> To delight in creation is the law of Life. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1020</FONT></span></p>

<p>It is true life to give up one's soul.<br> He that hath sound intelligence<br> Will prove his strength by great enterprises.<br> &#146;Tis sweet to use love in hard tasks<br> And, like Abraham, to gather roses from flames.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1040</FONT></span><br> The potentialities of men of action<br> Are displayed in willing acceptance of what is difficult.<br> Mean spirits have no weapon but spite,<br> This is their one rule of life.<br> But Life is power made manifest, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1043</FONT></span><br> And its mainspring is the desire for victory.<br> Mercy out of season is a coldness of Life's blood,<br> A break in the rhythm of Life's music.<br> Whoever is sunk in the depths of ignominy<br> Calls his weakness contentment. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1050</FONT></span></p>

<p>Weakness is the plunderer of Life,<br> Its womb is teeming with fears and lies.<br> Its soul is empty of virtues,<br> Its milk is a fattening for vices.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1055</FONT></span> O man of sound judgement, beware!<br> This spoiler is lurking in ambush.<br> Be not his dupe, if thou art wise:<br> Chameleon-like, he changes colour every moment.<br> Even by keen observers his form is not discerned:<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1060</FONT></span> Veils are thrown over his face.<br> Now he is muffled in pity and gentleness,<br> Now he wears the cloak of humility.<br> Sometimes he is disguised as a victim of oppression,<br> Sometimes as one whose sins are to be excused.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1065</FONT></span> He appears in the shape of self-indulgence<br> And robs the strong man's heart of courage.</p>

<p>Strength is the twin of Truth;<br> If thou knowest thyself, strength is the Truth-revealing glass.<br> Life is the seed, and power the crop:<br> Power explains the mystery of truth and falsehood. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1070</FONT></span><br> The false claimant, if he be possessed of power,<br> Needs no argument for his claim.<br> Falsehood derives from power the authority of truth,<br> And by falsifying truth deems itself true.<br> Its creative word transforms poison into nectar; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1075</FONT></span><br> It says to Good, "Thou art bad," and Good becomes Evil.<br> O thou that art heedless of the trust committed to thee,<br> Esteem thyself superior to both worlds!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
