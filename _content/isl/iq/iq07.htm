<p>And overwhelmed by affliction,<br> Seek not thy daily bread from the bounty of another,<br> Seek not waves of water from the fountain of the sun,<br> Lest thou be put to shame before the Prophet<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">460</FONT></span> On the Day when every soul shall be stricken with fear.<br> The moon gets sustenance from the table of the sun<br> And bears the brand of his bounty on her heart.<br> Pray God for courage! Wrestle with Fortune!<br> Do not sully the honour of the pure religion!<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">465</FONT></span> He who swept the rubbish of idols out of the Ka&#145;ba<br> Said that God loves a man that earns his living.<br> Woe to him that accepts bounty from another's table</p>

<p>And lets his neck be bent with benefits!<br> He hath consumed himself with the lightning of the favours bestowed on him,<br> He hath sold his honour for a paltry coin. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">470</FONT></span><br> Happy the man who thirsting in the sun<br> Does not crave of Khizr a cup of water!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> His brow is not moist with the shame of beggary;<br> He is a man still, not a piece of clay.<br> That noble youth walks under heaven <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">475</FONT></span><br> With his head erect like the pine.<br> Are his hands empty? The more is he master of himself.<br> Do his fortunes languish? The more alert is he.<br> The beggar's wallet is like a boat tossing in waves of fire;</p>
