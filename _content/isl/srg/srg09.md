# PART V

## TIME AND THIS DREAM-WORLD

### TIME

THE past has flown away,  
The coming month and year do not exist;  
Ours only is the present's tiny point.

Time is but a fancied dot ever moving on  
Which you have called a flowing river-stream.

I am alone in a wide desert,  
Listening to the echo of strange noises.

### THE DREAM OF LIFE

You have heard much of this world,  
Yet what have you seen of this world?  
What is its form and substance?

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

What is Simurgh, and what is Mount Kaf?  
What is Hades and what is Heaven and Hell?  
What is that unseen world  
A day of which equals a year of this?

Come and hear the meaning.

You are asleep, and your vision is a dream,  
All you are seeing is a mirage.  
When you wake up on the morn of the last day  
You will know all this to be Fancy's illusion;  
When you have ceased to see double,  
Earth and Heaven will become transformed;  
When the real sun unveils his face to you,  
The moon, the stars, and Venus will disappear;  
If a ray shines on the hard rock  
Like wool of many colours, it drops to pieces.

### THE PHENOMENAL WORLD

THE world is an imaginary figure,  
A diffused shadow of the Infinite;  
One breath created the worlds of command  
And all living things.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

As they appear to come forth, so they appear to go.  
Though there is no real coming and going.  
For what is going but coming?

. . . All are one, both the visible and the invisible.  
God most high, the Eternal One,  
Creates and destroys both worlds.

. . . The varied forms you see are but phantoms of your fancy,  
And by revolving quickly in a circle  
Appear as one.

### THE REAL AND THE UNREAL

THE imagination produces phenomenal objects  
Which have no real existence,  
So this world has no substantial reality,  
But exists as a shadowy pageant or a play.

All is pervaded by Absolute Being  
In its utter perfection.

There are many numbers, but only One is counted.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

### THIS WORLD A MIRAGE

THE house is left empty, save for the Truth,  
For in a moment the world has passed away;  
Then you, rid of self, fly upwards  
And are united to the Beloved.

Union is yours when this dream-world  
Fades and dies away.
