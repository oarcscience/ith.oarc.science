<p>EACH creature has its being<br> From the One Name,<br> From which it comes forth,<br> And to which it returns,<br> With praises unending.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE BELOVED GUEST</h3>  
<p>CAST away your existence entirely,<br> For it is nought but weeds and refuse,<br> Go, clear out your heart's chamber,<br> Arrange it as the abiding-place of the Beloved.<br> When you go forth, He will come in,<br> And to you, with self discarded,<br> He will unveil His beauty.</p>  
<p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="green">p. 73</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE SHADOWLESS</h3>  
<p>ON the narrow path of Truth,<br> On the Meridian line, He stands upright,<br> Throwing no shadow before or behind Him,<br> To the right hand or the left.</p>  
<p>East and west is His Kibla cast,<br> Drowned in a blaze of radiant light.</p>  
<p>Hail, O Light of God, O Shadowless Divinity!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE UNKNOWABLE</h3>  
<p>PONDER on God's mercies,<br> But not on His essence.<br> For His works come forth from His essence,<br> Not His essence from His works.<br> His light shines on the whole universe,<br> Yet He Himself is hidden from the universe.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE BOOK OF GOD</h3>  
<p>THE universe is God's book,<br> And he to whom the vision of the Divine</p>  
<p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></A></p>  
<p>Has been vouchsafed<br> Reads therein and understands.<br> Substance is its consonants and accidents its vowels,<br> And different creatures are its signs and pauses.<br> The first verse is "Universal Reason,"<br> The second "Universal Soul," the "verse of light,"<br> And this is as a brightly shining lamp.<br> The third is the "Highest heavens,<br> The fourth "The Throne."<br> After there are seven transcendent spheres,<br> The "chapter of the seven limbs,"<br> And forms of the four elements,<br> Then Nature's three kingdoms<br> Whose verses none can count.<br> And last of all came down the soul of man.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE UNCHANGING LIGHT</h3>  
<p>You fancy this world is permanent of itself<br> And endures because of its own nature,<br> But really it is a ray of light from the Truth<br> And within it the Truth is concealed.</p>  
<p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></A></p>  
<p>And this light alters not nor varies<br> And is void of change or degree.<br> If the sun tarried always in one spot,<br> And ever shone in the same degree,<br> None would know that the light comes from him.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">FUTURE REWARD</h3>  
<p>PONDER here and now on His qualities,<br> That you may behold Him Himself to-morrow.</p>
