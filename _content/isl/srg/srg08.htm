<p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></A></p>  <h1 align="center">PART IV</h1>  <h2 align="center">THE JOURNEY</h2>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE FORSAKING</h3>  
<p>SEE, your companions have gone;<br> Will you not too make a start?<br> If you desire to take wing as a bird,<br> Then leave to the vultures this carrion world.</p>  
<p>Forsake your relations,<br> For your real Friend must be sought.<br> He who is drowning in the sea of Not-being<br> Must cast aside all relationships.<br> What are father and mother,<br> Sister and brother?<br> Your very son may be your enemy,<br> Yet may a stranger be your kinsman;<br> Even your fellow-travellers on the mystic path<br> Must be renounced.</p>  
<p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></A></p>  
<p>All relations are a bond, a spell,<br> A fairy dream,<br> An absolute illusion.</p>  
<p>Omit not the duties<br> Of the law to them,<br> But have regard to yourself.<br> . . . Abandon gold and women,<br> For they are a source of anxiety.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE TRAVELLER</h3>  
<p>THE traveller on the path,<br> &#8217;Tis he who knows from whence he cometh;<br> Then doth he journey hastily,<br> Becoming as pure from self as fire from smoke.<br> Unfolded to him are a series of revelations<br> From the beginning. Till he is led away<br> From darkness and sin.<br> He now retraces stage by stage his steps<br> Till he reaches his goal the Perfect.<br> Thus is the perfect man evolved<br> From the time he first exists<br> As inorganic matter,</p>  
<p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></A></p>  
<p>Next a breath of spirit, and he is living<br> And from God draws his motive powers.<br> Next the Truth makes him lord of his will,<br> As in childhood his discernment of the world unfolds.<br> And now the world's temptations assail him.</p>  
<p>. . . Anger appears and desires of the flesh,<br> And then avarice, pride, and gluttony;<br> His nature becomes evil,<br> Worse than an animal or demon;<br> Now is he at the lowest point of all,<br> The point opposite to Unity.</p>  
<p>. . . Should he remain fettered in this snare,<br> He goes further astray than the beasts;<br> But if there shines a light from the spirit world,<br> Divinely attractive,<br> Or if he can find a reflection of proof,<br> Then will his heart respond in a feeling of kinship<br> To this Light of the Truth,<br> And he will turn back and retrace his steps<br> From whence he came.<br> To faith assured he has found his way<br> Through certain proof, or the wonder<br> And attraction of the Divine,</p>  
<p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></A></p>  
<p>. . . He throws away his selfhood utterly<br> And ascends in the steps of the most Pure.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">EXHORTATION</h3>  
<p>THOUGH the world is yours, you remain dejected,<br> Who so pitiable as you?</p>  
<p>You, who are a man, arise and pass on,<br> Wait not day or night at the halting-stages,<br> Tarry not behind your fellow-travellers and the caravans.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE TWO STEPS OF THE JOURNEY</h3>  
<p>THE journey of the pilgrims is two steps and no more:<br> One is the passing out of selfhood,<br> And one towards mystical Union with the Friend.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">FEAR</h3>  
<p>As the Arab racer needs not the whip,<br> So you will not need to fear<br> When on your journey you have started.</p>  
<p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></A></p>  
<p>When purified are your soul and body,<br> You will not fear the fires of hell.<br> Throw pure gold into the fire;<br> If it contains no alloy, what is there to burn?</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">LOGIC</h3>  
<p>IF God guides you not into the road,<br> It will not be disclosed by logic.</p>  
<p>Logic is a bondage of forms;<br> A road that is long and hard.<br> Leave it for a season. Like Moses<br> Cast away that staff<br> And enter for awhile "The Valley of Peace."</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE INFANT AND THE YOUTH</h3>  
<p>THE young infant in the cradle<br> Stays at his mother's side,<br> But when he is grown manly<br> He goes forth with his father.</p>  
<p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></A></p>  
<p>So you remain with your mother,<br> The fleshly elements,<br> Until you join your Father up on high.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE ALMOND-TREE</h3>  
<p>As the kernel of an almond is spoilt utterly<br> If it is plucked from its husk while unripe,<br> So error in the path of the pilgrim<br> Spoils the kernel of his soul.<br> When the knower is divinely illumined,<br> The kernel ripens, bursts the husk,<br> And departs, returning no more.<br> But another retains the husk,<br> Though shining as a. bright sun,<br> And makes another circuit.<br> From water and earth springs up into a tree,<br> Whose high branches are lifted up to heaven;<br> Then from the seed of this tree<br> A hundredfold are brought forth.<br> Like the growth of a seed into the line of a tree,<br> From point comes a line, then a circle;<br> When the circuit of this circle is complete,<br> Then the last is joined to the first.</p>  
<p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">INTERMINGLING</h3>  
<p>You are plurality transformed into Unity,<br> And Unity passing into plurality;<br> This mystery is understood when man<br> Leaves the part and merges in the Whole.</p>
