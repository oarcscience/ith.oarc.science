<p align="center">IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE COMPASSIONATE, THE MERCIFUL</p>  <h1 align="center">PART I</h1>  <h2 align="center">THE PERFECT FACE OF THE BELOVED</h2>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE EYE AND THE LIP</h3>  
<p>WHAT is the nature of the eye and the lip?<br> Let us consider.</p>  
<p>Coquettish and intoxicating glances shine from His eye.<br> The essence of existence issues from His ruby lip.<br> Hearts burn with desire because of His eye,<br> And are healed again by the smile of His lip.</p>  
<p>Because of His eye hearts are aching and drunken.<br> His ruby lip gives soul-garments to men.<br> His eye does not perceive this visible world,<br> Yet often His lip quivers with compassion.</p>  
<p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></A></p>  
<p>Sometimes He charms us with a touch of humanity,<br> And gives help to the despairing.<br> It is His smile that gives life to man's water and clay;<br> It is His breath that opens heaven's gate for us.<br> A corn-baited snare is each glance of that eye,<br> And a wine-shop lurks in each corner.</p>  
<p>When He frowns the wide world is laid waste,<br> But is restored every moment by His kiss.<br> Our blood is at fever point because of His eye,<br> Our souls demented because of His lip.</p>  
<p>How He has despoiled our hearts by a frown!<br> How He has uplifted our souls by a smile!<br> If you ask of Him an embrace,<br> His eye will say "Yea," His lip "Nay."<br> He finished the creation of the world by a frown,<br> Now and then the soul is revived by a kiss.<br> We would give up our lives with despair at His frown,<br> But would rise from the dead at his kiss.</p>  
<p>. . . When the world meditates on His eye and His lip,<br> It yields itself to the intoxication of wine.</p>  
<p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE MOLE</h3>  
<p>THE single point of the mole in His cheek<br> Is a centre from which circles<br> A circumference.<br> The two worlds circle round that centre.<br> The heart and soul of Adam evolved from there.</p>  
<p>. . . Hearts bleed because they are a reflection<br> Of the point of that black mole,<br> And both are stagnant; for there is no escape<br> Of the reflection from the reflect.</p>  
<p>Unity will not embrace Plurality,<br> For the point of Unity has one root only.</p>  
<p>. . . I wonder if His mole is the reflection of my heart,<br> Or my heart the reflection of His mole.<br> Was my heart created from His mole's reflection?<br> Or may it be seen shining in His mole?<br> I wonder if my heart is in His face,<br> Or if His mole abides in my heart.<br> But this is a deep secret hidden, alas! from me.</p>  
<p>. . . If my heart is a reflection,<br> Why is it ever so changing?</p>  
<p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></A></p>  
<p>Sometimes tired like His brilliant eye,<br> Sometimes waving to and fro as His curl waves,<br> Sometimes a shining moonbeam like His face,<br> Sometimes a dark shadow like His mole,<br> Sometimes it is a mosque, sometimes a synagogue,<br> Sometimes a hell, sometimes a heaven,<br> Sometimes soaring above the seventh heaven,<br> Sometimes buried far below this earth.</p>  
<p>. . . After a spell the devotee and ascetic<br> Turns again to wine, lamp, and beauty.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE CURL</h3>  
<p>IF you ask of me the long story<br> Of the Beloved's curl,<br> I cannot answer, for it contains a mystery<br> Which only true lovers understand,<br> And they, maddened by its beauty,<br> Are held captive as by a golden chain.<br> I spoke too openly of that graceful form,<br> But the end of the curl told me to hide its glory,<br> So that the path to it should be twisted<br> And crooked and difficult.</p>  
<p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></A></p>  
<p>That curl enchains lovers' hearts,<br> And bears their souls to and fro<br> In the sea of desire. A hundred thousand hearts<br> Are tightly bound, not one escapes, alas!</p>  
<p>No single infidel would remain in the world<br> If he could see the shaking aside<br> Of those black curls,<br> And on the earth there would not remain a faithful soul<br> If they were always in their place.<br> Suppose they were shorn. . . . No matter,<br> Day would increase and the night disappear.</p>  
<p>As a spider spreads its nets to ensnare,<br> So does the Beloved in wantonness<br> Shake His locks from off His face.</p>  
<p>Behold His hands plundering Reason's caravan<br> And with knots binding it tight.</p>  
<p>Never at rest is that curl,<br> Ever moving to and fro<br> Making now night, making now morning,<br> Playing with the seasons in wonder.</p>  
<p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></A></p>  
<p>Adam was created when the perfume of that<br> amber-scented curl<br> Was blown by the wind on his clay.</p>  
<p>And I too possess an ensample;<br> I cannot wait for a moment,<br> But breathlessly start working anew<br> To tear my heart out of my breast.<br> . . . Sore troubled am I by that curl<br> Which veils my longing soul from His face.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE CHEEK AND THE DOWN</h3>  
<p>THE theatre of Divine beauty is the cheek,<br> And the down is the entrance to His holy presence.<br> Beauty is erased by His cheek, who says,<br> "Without my presence you are non-existent."<br> In the unseen world the down is as green meadows<br> Leading to the mansion  of Eternal Life.<br> The blackness of His curl turns day into night,<br> The down of His cheek holds the secret of life.<br> If only you can glimpse His face and its down,<br> You will understand the meaning of plurality and unity.<br> His curl will teach you the knowledge of this world,<br> His down will reveal hidden paths.</p>  
<p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></A></p>  
<p>Imagine seven verses in which each letter<br> Contains oceans of mysteries;<br> Such is His cheek.<br> And imagine, hidden beneath each hair of His cheek,<br> Thousands of oceans of mysteries;<br> Such is His down.</p>  
<p>As the heart is God's throne in the water,<br> So is the down the ornament of the soul.</p>
