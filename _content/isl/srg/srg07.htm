<p>BEHOLD how this drop of sea-water<br> Has taken so many forms and names;<br> It has existed as mist, cloud, rain, dew, and mud,<br> Then plant, animal, and perfect man;<br> And yet it was a drop of water<br> From which these things appeared.<br> Even so this universe of reason, soul, heavens, and bodies,<br> Was but a drop of water in its beginning and ending.</p>  
<p>. . . When a wave strikes it, the world vanishes;<br> And when the appointed time comes to heaven and stars,<br> Their being is lost in not being.</p>  
<p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE SEA OF BEING</h3>  
<p>IN Being's silver sea<br> Lustrous pearls of knowledge are washed up<br> On the shore of speech,<br> And dainty shells bring poems in their curving forms<br> To strew the beach with beauty.</p>  
<p>Each wave that breaks in foaming arcs<br> Casts up a thousand royal pearls<br> That hold strange murmuring voices,<br> Gems of devotion, joy, and love.</p>  
<p>Yet though a thousand waves<br> At every moment rise and fall,<br> Scattering pearls and shells,<br> Yet are there ever more and more to come,<br> Nor is that sea  of Being less by one sheer drop.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">PEARLS OF KNOWLEDGE</h3>  
<p>IN the sea of &#8217;Uman, the pearl oysters<br> Rise to the surface from the lowest depths,<br> And wait with opened mouths.<br> Then arises from the sea a mist,</p>  
<p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></A></p>  
<p>Which falls again in raindrops<br> Into the mouths of the shells<br> (At the command of the Truth).<br> Straightway is each closed as by a hundred bonds,<br> And the shells sink back again<br> Into the ocean's depths,<br> Bearing in their hearts the pearl drops<br> Which the divers seek and find.</p>  
<p>The sea is Being, the shore the body;<br> The mist, grace, and the rain, knowledge of the Name;<br> Human Wisdom is the diver<br> Who holds enwrapped in his garment<br> A hundred pearls;<br> The soul in a swift lightning's flash<br> Bears to the listening ear voices and messages<br> From the shells of knowledge;<br> Then when the husks are opened,<br> Behold the royal shimmering pearls!</p>
