<p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></A></p>  <h1 align="center">PART VI</h1>  <h2 align="center">REFLECTIONS</h2>  <h3 align="center" align="center">SUN-REFLECTIONS</h3>  
<p>SUN-REFLECTIONS from the unseen world<br> Are all the objects of this mortal sphere,<br> As curl, down, mole, and brow on a fair face.<br> For Beauty absolute reigns over all.</p>  
<p>. . . When the ears first hear these words<br> They seem to denote sensual objects.<br> But as there is no language for the Infinite,<br> How can we express its mysteries<br> In finite words?<br> Or how can the visions of the ecstatic<br> Be described in earthly formula?<br> So mystics veil their meanings<br> In these shadows of the unseen,<br> The objects of the senses.</p>  
<p>. . . As a nurse to an infant,<br> So is the Infinite to the finite.</p>  
<p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></A></p>  
<p>. . . Once these words were used in their proper sense,<br> But now are concealed lest the vulgar should profane.</p>  
<p>Annihilation, intoxication, the fever of love<br> Are the three states of the mystic,<br> And those who abide in these states<br> At once comprehend the meanings<br> Veiled in the words.<br> But if you know them not,<br> Pretend not you understand like an ignorant infidel,<br> For all cannot be mystics or grasp the mysteries.<br> No mere illusions are the mystic's dreams,<br> And a man of truth does not vainly talk.<br> To comprehend requires revelations or great faith.</p>  
<p>Briefly have I explained these words and their meanings<br> So that you may apply them in their right intent,<br> Remembering the attributes of each.<br> Compare them in a right manner,<br> And refrain from the wrong comparisons.</p>  
<p>Now that these rules are understood<br> I will show you more of their application.</p>  
<p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE MIRROR</h3>  
<p>YOUR eye has not strength enough<br> To gaze at the burning sun,<br> But you can see its brilliant light<br> By watching its reflection<br> Mirrored in the water.</p>  
<p>So the reflection of Absolute Being<br> Can be viewed in this mirror of Not-Being,<br> For non-existence, being opposite Reality,<br> Instantly catches its reflection.</p>  
<p>Know the world from end to end is a mirror;<br> In each atom a hundred suns are concealed.<br> If you pierce the heart of a single drop of water,<br> From it will flow a hundred clear oceans;<br> If you look intently at each speck of dust,<br> In it you will see a thousand beings,<br> A gnat in its limbs is like an elephant;<br> In name a drop of water resembles the Nile,<br> In the heart of a barley-corn is stored an hundred harvests,<br> Within a millet-seed a world exists,<br> In an insect's wing is an ocean of life,</p>  
<p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></A></p>  
<p>A heaven is concealed in the pupil of an eye,<br> The core in the centre of the heart is small,<br> Yet the Lord of both worlds will enter there.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">EVIL</h3>  
<p>BLACKEN the back of a mirror<br> And it will reflect your face,<br> So the dust of the earth reflects<br> The rays of the sun in the seventh heaven.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR</h3>  
<p>HOLD up a mirror before you<br> And gaze on that other person.</p>  
<p>. . . Again look and consider;<br> Your proper self is here, not there.<br> What, then, can be this reflection,<br> This shadow of your face?</p>  
<p>In the same way as light and dark are not connected,<br> Being is not joined to Not-Being.</p>
