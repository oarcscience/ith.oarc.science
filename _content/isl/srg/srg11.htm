<p>THE tavern is the abode of lovers,<br> The place where the bird of the soul nests,<br> The rest-house that has no existence<br> In a world that has no form.<br> The tavern-haunter is desolate in a lonely desert,<br> Where he sees the world as a mirage.<br> The desert is limitless and endless,<br> For no man has seen its beginning or ending.<br> Though you feverishly wander for a hundred years<br> You will be always alone.<br> For the dwellers there are headless and footless,<br> Neither the faithful nor infidels,<br> They have renounced both good and evil,<br> And have cast away name and fame,<br> From drinking the cup of selflessness;</p>  
<p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></A></p>  
<p>Without lips or mouth,<br> And are beyond traditions, visions, and states,<br> Beyond dreaming of secret rooms, of lights and miracles.</p>  
<p>They are lying drunken through the smell of the wine-dregs,<br> And have given as ransom<br> Pilgrim's staff and cruse,<br> Dentifrice and rosary.</p>  
<p>Sometimes rising to the world of bliss,<br> With necks exalted as racers,<br> Or with blackened faces turned to the wall,<br> Sometimes with reddened faces tied to the stake.</p>  
<p>Now in the mystic dance of joy in the Beloved,<br> Losing head and foot like the revolving heavens.<br> In every strain which they hear from the minstrel<br> Comes to them rapture from the unseen world.</p>  
<p>For within the mere words and sounds<br> Of the mystic song<br> Lies a precious mystery.</p>  
<p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></A></p>  
<p>From drinking one cup of the pure wine,<br> From sweeping the dust of dung-hills from their souls,<br> From grasping the skirts of drunkards,<br> They have become S&#363;f&#299;s.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE WINE OF RAPTURE</h3>  
<p>THE wine, lit by a ray from his face,<br> Reveals the bubbles of form,<br> Such as the material world and the soul-world,<br> Which appear as veils to the saints.<br> Universal Reason seeing this is astounded,<br> Universal Soul is reduced to servitude.</p>  
<p>Drink wine! for the bowl is the face of the Friend.<br> Drink wine! for the cup is his eye, drunken and flown with wine.<br> Drink wine! and be free from heart-coldness,<br> For a drunkard is better than the self-satisfied.</p>  
<p>The whole world is his tavern,<br> His wine-cup the heart of each atom,<br> Reason is drunken, angels drunken, soul drunken,<br> Air drunken, earth drunken, heaven drunken.</p>  
<p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></A></p>  
<p>The sky, dizzy from the wine-fumes' aroma,<br> Is staggering to and fro;<br> The angels, sipping pure wine from goblets,<br> Pour down the dregs on the world;<br> From the scent of these dregs man rises to heaven.<br> Inebriated from the draught, the elements<br> Fall into water and fire.<br> Catching the reflection, the frail body becomes a soul,<br> And the frozen soul by its heat<br> Thaws and becomes living.<br> The creature world remains giddy,<br> For ever straying from house and home.</p>  
<p>One from the dregs' odour becomes a philosopher,<br> One viewing the wine's colour becomes a relater,<br> One from half a draught becomes religious,<br> One from a bowlful becomes a lover,<br> Another swallows at one draught<br> Goblet, tavern, cup-bearer, and drunkards;<br> He swallows all, but still his mouth stays open.</p>  
<p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">WINE, TORCH, AND BEAUTY</h3>  
<p>TRUTH'S manifestations<br> Are wine, torch, and beauty;<br> Wine and torch are the light and shining of the "knower,"<br> Beauty is concealed from none.<br> Wine is the lamp-shade,<br> And torch the lamp;<br> Beauty is the Spirit-light,<br> So bright, it kindles sparks<br> In the heart.<br> Wine and torch are the essence of that blinding light,<br> Beauty is the sign of the Divine.</p>  
<p>Drink this wine and, dying to self,<br> You will be freed from the spell of self.<br> Then will your being, as a drop,<br> Fall into the ocean of the Eternal.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">INTOXICATION</h3>  
<p>WHAT is pure wine?<br> It is self-purification.<br> What sweetness! what intoxication! what blissful ecstasy!</p>  
<p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></A></p>  
<p>Oh! happy moment when ourselves we quit,<br> When fallen in the dust, drunken and amazed,<br> In utter poverty we shall be rich and free.<br> Of what use then will be paradise and houris?<br> For no alien can find entrance to that mystic room.</p>  
<p>I know not what will happen after<br> I have seen this vision and imbibed this cup,<br> But after all intoxication comes headache,<br> Anguish drowns my soul remembering this!</p>
