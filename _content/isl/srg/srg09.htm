<p>THE past has flown away,<br> The coming month and year do not exist;<br> Ours only is the present's tiny point.</p>  
<p>Time is but a fancied dot ever moving on<br> Which you have called a flowing river-stream.</p>  
<p>I am alone in a wide desert,<br> Listening to the echo of strange noises.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE DREAM OF LIFE</h3>  
<p>You have heard much of this world,<br> Yet what have you seen of this world?<br> What is its form and substance?</p>  
<p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></A></p>  
<p>What is Simurgh, and what is Mount  Kaf?<br> What is Hades and what is Heaven and Hell?<br> What is that unseen world<br> A day of which equals a year of this?</p>  
<p>Come and hear the meaning.</p>  
<p>You are asleep, and your vision is a dream,<br> All you are seeing is a mirage.<br> When you wake up on the morn of the last day<br> You will know all this to be Fancy's illusion;<br> When you have ceased to see double,<br> Earth and Heaven will become transformed;<br> When the real sun unveils his face to you,<br> The moon, the stars, and Venus will disappear;<br> If a ray shines on the hard rock<br> Like wool of many colours, it drops to pieces.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE PHENOMENAL WORLD</h3>  
<p>THE world is an imaginary figure,<br> A diffused shadow of the Infinite;<br> One breath created the worlds of command<br> And all living things.</p>  
<p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></A></p>  
<p>As they appear to come forth, so they appear to go.<br> Though there is no real coming and going.<br> For what is going but coming?</p>  
<p>. . . All are one, both the visible and the invisible.<br> God most high, the Eternal One,<br> Creates and destroys both worlds.</p>  
<p>. . . The varied forms you see are but phantoms of your fancy,<br> And by revolving quickly in a circle<br> Appear as one.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE REAL AND THE UNREAL</h3>  
<p>THE imagination produces phenomenal objects<br> Which have no real existence,<br> So this world has no substantial reality,<br> But exists as a shadowy pageant or a play.</p>  
<p>All is pervaded by Absolute Being<br> In its utter perfection.</p>  
<p>There are many numbers, but only One is counted.</p>  
<p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THIS WORLD A MIRAGE</h3>  
<p>THE house is left empty, save for the Truth,<br> For in a moment the world has passed away;<br> Then you, rid of self, fly upwards<br> And are united to the Beloved.</p>  
<p>Union is yours when this dream-world<br> Fades and dies away.</p>
