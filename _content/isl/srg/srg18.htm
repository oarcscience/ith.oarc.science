<p>THE Light which is manifest<br> Leads all hearts captive,<br> Now as the minstrel, now as the cupbearer.</p>  
<p>What a singer is He who, by one strain of sweet melody,<br> Burns the harvests of a hundred devotees!<br> What a cupbearer is He who, by a single goblet,<br> Inebriates two hundred threescore and ten!</p>  
<p>Entering the Mosque at dawn,<br> He leaves there no wakeful man;<br> Entering the cloister at night,<br> He makes a fable of S&#363;f&#299;s' tales;<br> Entering the college veiled as a drunkard,<br> The professor becomes hopelessly drunken.</p>  
<p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></A></p>  
<p>Devotees go mad for love of Him<br> And become outcasts from house and home,<br> He makes one faithful, another an infidel,<br> Disturbing the world.<br> Taverns have been glorified by His lips,<br> Mosques have become shining by His cheek.</p>  
<p>All I desire I have found in Him,<br> Gaining deliverance from self,<br> My heart was ignorant of itself,<br> Veiled from Him by a hundred veils<br> Of vanity, conceit, and illusion.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE VISIT</h3>  
<p>ONE day at the dawn<br> The fair idol entered my door<br> And woke me from my sleep<br> Of slothful ignorance.<br> The secret chamber of my soul<br> Was illumined by His face,<br> And my being was revealed to me<br> In its true light.<br> I heaved a sigh of wonder<br> When I saw that fair face.<br> He spoke to me, saying,</p>  
<p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></A></p>  
<p>"All thy life thou has sought<br> Name and fame;<br> This self-seeking of thine<br> Is an illusion, keeping thee back from Me.<br> To glance at My face for an instant<br> Is worth a thousand years of devotion."</p>  
<p>Yes, the face of that world-adorner<br> Was shown unveiled before mine eyes;<br> My soul was darkened with shame<br> To remember my lost life,<br> My wasted days.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE GIFT</h3>  
<p>THEN that moon<br> Whose face shone like the sun,<br> Seeing I had cast hope away,<br> Filled a goblet of Divine Knowledge<br> And, passing to me, bade me drink,<br> Saying, "With this wine,<br> Tasteless and odourless,<br> Wash away the writing<br> On thy being's tablet."</p>  
<p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE EFFECT OF THE DRAUGHT</h3>  
<p>INTOXICATED from the pure draught<br> Which I had drained to the dregs,<br> In the bare dust I fell.<br> Since then I know not if I exist or not,<br> But I am not sober, neither am I ill or drunken.<br> Sometimes, like His eye, I am full of joy,<br> Or, like His curl, I am waving;<br> Sometimes, alas! from habit or nature,<br> I am lying on a dust heap.<br> Sometimes, at a glance from Him,<br> I am back in the Rose Garden.</p>
