<p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></A></p>  <h1 align="center">PART XIII</h1>  <h2 align="center">THOUGHTS</h2>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CIRCLES</h3>  
<p>BEHOLD the world mingled together,<br> Angels with demons, Satan with the archangel.<br> All mingled like seed and fruit,<br> Infidel with faithful, and faithful with infidel.<br> At the point of the present are gathered<br> All cycles and seasons, day, month, and year.<br> World at beginning is world without end.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>. . . From every point in this circle<br> A thousand forms are drawn;<br> Every point as it revolves in a circle<br> Is now a circle, now a circling circumference.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">DEATH</h3>  
<p>DEATH occurs to man in three ways:<br> First he dies every moment by his earthly nature;<br> Then, when his will perishes, he dies again;<br> And lastly at the separation of soul and body.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE HEAVENS</h3>  
<p>LET not the prison of nature detain you,<br> But come forth and view the art of the Divine,<br> Contemplate the appearance of the heavens,<br> So that praise and wonder for the Truth will be thine.</p>  
<p>The arch of the high heavens enclosing both worlds<br> Is called "The Throne of the Merciful,"<br> And like the heart of man is ever moving,<br> Never resting for a moment.<br> Perchance man's heart is the central point<br> And heaven the circumference.</p>  
<p>Within a day and a night<br> Heaven outspans your circuits, O dervish!</p>  
<p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></A></p>  
<p>The other heavenly spheres are circling too,<br> Remember they all move in one direction,<br> From east to west like a water wheel,<br> Rushing on without food or sleep.</p>  
<p>When the astrologer is an unbeliever,<br> He sees not that these circulating lights of heaven<br> Are dominated and controlled by The Truth.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">NO COMPLETE HAPPINESS HERE</h3>  
<p>WHOM have you seen in the whole world<br> Who ever once acquired pleasure without pain?<br> Who, in attaining all his desires,<br> Has remained at his height of perfection?</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE ATOMS</h3>  
<p>TAKE one atom away from its place<br> And the whole world will fall to pieces;<br> The world is whirling dizzily, yet no one part<br> Moves from the limit of its place.<br> Each atom, held in bondage,<br> Despairs at its separation from the whole;<br> So though imprisoned, yet moves,</p>  
<p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></A></p>  
<p>Though unclothed, yet is clothed again,<br> Though at rest, yet is always wandering,<br> Never beginning and never ending;<br> Each possessing self-knowledge, and so<br> Hurrying towards the throne on high.</p>  
<p>Each atom hides beneath its veil<br> The soul-amazing beauty of the Beloved's Face.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE PRAISE OF THE ATOMS</h3>  
<p>CONTINUALLY dwelling in all mystic lore,<br> Continually singing the song of praise<br> The atoms of the world will seem to you<br> Drunken and heavy with wine.</p>  
<p>. . . When you have carded self<br> Like the wool-carder, you will raise a cry.<br> Oh! take the cotton of illusion from your ears,<br> And hearken to the call of the One, the Almighty.</p>  
<p>. . . Why tarry till the last day<br> When now, in the valley of peace,<br> The very bush will say to you, "I am Allah"?</p>  
<p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THINKING</h3>  
<p>THINKING is passing from the false to the true<br> And seeing the Absolute Whole in the part.<br> When the idea enters the mind,<br> It is a reminiscence of a former state,<br> And passes on to interpretation.</p>  
<p>. . . He who sees by illumination<br> Discerns God first in everything,<br> But he who sees by logic only,<br> And seeks to prove the necessary,<br> Is bewildered and sometimes travels<br> Backward in a circle, or is imprisoned<br> In a chain of proofs.<br> Fool! he seeks the dazzling sun<br> By the dim light of a candle in the desert.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THOUGHTS ON CREATION</h3>  
<p>THE heavens revolve day and night<br> Like a potter's wheel,<br> And every moment the Master's wisdom<br> Creates a new vessel. For all that exists<br> Comes from one hand, one workshop.</p>  
<p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></A></p>  
<p>Why do the stars set?<br> Going from perfection to defection?<br> Why do they change position,<br> Place, circuit, colour, and form?<br> Or why is heaven fretted by fire<br> Always whirling through desire?<br> Why are the planets revolving,<br> Above or beneath the earth?<br> The elements which are below the heavens<br> Serve in their appointed place<br> Ever united together.<br> From them is born the threefold<br> Kingdom of Nature;<br> Minerals, then plants and animals,<br> Waiting in their places as He wills.<br> Minerals, low in the dust, plants standing upright,<br> Animals, by their natural passions,<br> Preserving, continuing their races and species.</p>  
<p>All, bowing to their Master's commands,<br> Fulfil His will day and night.</p>
