<p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></A></p>  <h1 align="center">PART IX</h1>  <h2 align="center">MAN: HIS CAPABILITIES AND HIS DESTINY</h2>  <h3 align="center" align="center">TO THE S&#362;F&#298;S</h3>  
<p>You are bound by a chord<br> To the soul of the creatures before you,<br> Therefore they are subject to your dominion,<br> And the soul of each is hidden in you.<br> In the midst of the world you are the kernel,<br> The centre of the world.<br> . . . The world of reason and mind is your fortune,<br> Earth and heavens your garments.<br> . . Your natural powers are ten thousand<br> Transcending limits and reckonings.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">"I" AND "YOU"</h3>  
<p>"I" AND "you" are but the lattices,<br> In the niches of a lamp,<br> Through which the One Light shines.</p>  
<p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></A></p>  
<p>"I" and "you" are the veil<br> Between heaven and earth;<br> Lift this veil and you will see<br> No longer the bond of sects and creeds.<br> When "I" and "you" do not exist,<br> What is mosque, what is synagogue?<br> What is the Temple  of Fire?</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">REFLECTED FORMS OF HABIT</h3>  
<p>REPEAT an action several times<br> And you master it;<br> Habit makes dispositions<br> As fruits become ripe by time.<br> By practice man learns a trade,<br> By habit he collects his thoughts.</p>  
<p>Remember at the last day<br> All your habits and actions<br> Will be clearly seen,<br> For the garment of the body<br> Will be stripped. And the form left<br> Will reflect your vices and virtues,<br> As objects are reflected in pure water.</p>  
<p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></A></p>  
<p>Again, your dispositions will be embodied,<br> Made manifest as lights and fires;<br> For all phenomenal limitations will be removed.<br> You who are pure from earthly form,<br> Illumined by the Truth,<br> Will appear all heart,<br> From your stainless love.<br> Then will you be possessed by intoxication,<br> Scattering in confusion the two worlds.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE LOWEST NECESSARY</h3>  
<p>IF there were no sweepers in the world<br> The world would be buried in dust.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">A FAITHFUL SERVANT</h3>  
<p>To become a faithful servant,<br> Cultivate faith and sincerity,<br> Renew your belief every instant<br> While unbelief dwells in your heart.</p>  
<p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></A></p>  
<p>Abandon the wish to be seen of men,<br> Cast off the blue-patched robe<br> Of the dervish<br> And bind on the Magian girdle.</p>  
<p>Be a believer, be a believer, be a believer!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">"FAR" AND "NEAR"</h3>  
<p>IF He sheds His Light on you,<br> You become near to Him<br> And far from your own existence.<br> For by nearness to Him<br> You become far from yourself.</p>  
<p>What profit is there to you<br> In your non-existent existence?</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE SAGE</h3>  
<p>VIRTUE and equity,<br> Courage and temperance,<br> Are the four qualities of the sage.</p>  
<p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></A></p>  
<p>He is not over-cunning or a fool,<br> His appetites are under control,<br> From cringing and boasting he is free,<br> And from foolhardiness and cowardice.</p>  
<p>All virtues lie between<br> Excess and defect,<br> A narrow path betwixt<br> Hell's bottomless abyss,<br> Fine and sharp as a sword blade,<br> Which permits no lingering<br> Or turning round.</p>  
<p>Equipoise is the summit of perfection,<br> Becoming like a simple essence.</p>  
<p>As the rays of the sun<br> Shine upon the earth,<br> So the Light from the Spirit World<br> Shines brightly on him<br> Who has attained this equilibrium.</p>  
<p><a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="green">p. 69</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE PROPHET AND THE SAINT</h3>  
<p>THE prophet, resplendent in his perfection,<br> Is as the sun's bright light,<br> And the saint, concealing his saintship,<br> Is as the subdued light of the moon.<br> By fellowship, the saint<br> Is intimate with the prophet,<br> And finding entrance to that secret chamber,<br> He loves and is beloved by the Truth.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE FIRST AND THE LAST</h3>  
<p>THE two worlds produced the soul of Adam,<br> Which, though first in thought, was created last.</p>  
<p>In man's self is disclosed the final cause,<br> For there is none beyond him.</p>  
<p>O first, who are also the substance of the last!<br> O hidden, who are also the essence of the manifest!<br> You, who day and night are wondering about yourself,<br> Think of self no more,<br> For the end of such thought is confusion.</p>  
<p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">ANNIHILATION OF PHENOMENA</h3>  
<p>THE heavens and the stars<br> At the appointed time will disappear.<br> A wave will strike the earth,<br> And lo! it vanishes.</p>  
<p>Only the Truth will remain Unchangeable.</p>  
<p>And you at that moment,<br> Passing from this dream-life,<br> With self discarded,<br> Will be one with the Beloved.</p>  
<p>Oh! Master, ponder on your coming and your going,<br> And the thousand existences that lie before you!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE WRITTEN FAITH</h3>  
<p>READ the writing on your heart,<br> And you will understand whatever you desire,<br> For on the day he kneaded the clay,<br> He wrote on your heart, by grace, the faith.</p>  
<p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE PERFECT MAN</h3>  
<p>IN spite of his inheritance,<br> The perfect man is a slave<br> And does the work of a slave.<br> The law is his outer garment,<br> Though his inner is the mystic path.<br> He is famed for knowledge and devotion,<br> But he is far from all these,<br> For he is absorbed in the contemplation of the One.<br> . . . When his pilgrimage is over<br> He receives the crown of Khalifate.</p>
