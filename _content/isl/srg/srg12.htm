<p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></A></p>  <h1 align="center">PART VIII</h1>  <h2 align="center">REASON AND FREE-WILL</h2>  <h3 align="center" align="center">REASON</h3>  
<p>LET reason go. For his light<br> Burns reason up from head to foot.<br> If you wish to see that Face,<br> Seek another eye. The philosopher<br> With his two eyes sees double,<br> So is unable to see the unity of the Truth.<br> As his light burns up the angels,<br> Even so doth it consume reason.<br> As the light of our eyes to the sun,<br> So is the light of reason to the Light of Lights.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">KNOWLEDGE</h3>  
<p>LEARNING is only the outer wrapping<br> Of the letter;<br> The dry husk that covers the nut,<br> Not the kernel concealed within;</p>  
<p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></A></p>  
<p>Yet must the husk exist<br> To ripen the kernel.<br> So from learning comes the sweet knowledge of Faith.</p>  
<p>Oh! soul of my brother, hearken,<br> Strive to gain knowledge of faith,<br> For the "knower" in both worlds<br> Has a high place.<br> Knowledge loves not this world of form<br> Which is void of Reality.</p>  
<p>Begin to till your field<br> For next year's harvest.<br> Knowledge is your heritage,<br> Be adorned with the principle of all virtues.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE BLINDNESS OF REASON</h3>  
<p>As the man blind from his birth<br> Believes not nor understands<br> Your description of colours,<br> Even if you show him proofs for a century,<br> So blind reason cannot see the future state.</p>  
<p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></A></p>  
<p>But beyond reason man has a certain knowledge<br> Which God has placed in his soul and body<br> Whereby he perceives hidden mysteries.<br> And like the fire in flint and steel<br> When these are struck together,<br> The two worlds for him are lit up in a flash.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">FREE-WILL</h3>  
<p>You say, "I myself have Free-will,<br> For my body is the horse and my soul the rider,<br> The reins of the body are in the hands of the soul,<br> The entire direction is given to me."</p>  
<p>Oh! foolish one, these are falsehoods and delusions<br> That come from an illusory existence.</p>  
<p>As your essence is nothingness,<br> How can you have Free-will?<br> Seeing that your being is one with not-being,<br> Whence comes this Free-will of yours?</p>  
<p>Imagination distributes actions<br> As in a play or a farce,</p>  
<p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></A></p>  
<p>For when your actions were planned,<br> Before your existence,<br> You were created for a certain purpose,<br> By the desire of the Truth.<br> Therefore is man predestined, before his existence,<br> To certain appointed work.<br> . . . (Oh, wondrous ways of Thine, without how or why!)</p>  
<p>The honour of man consists of slavery,<br> In having no share of Free-will.</p>  
<p>Of himself man has nothing,<br> Yet of good and evil God asks him,<br> Man has no choice, he is under control.<br> Oh! poor soul, he seems free, yet is a slave.</p>  
<p>Give yourself up to the Truth,<br> For you are helpless in his grasp;<br> Freedom from self you will find in the All,<br> And, O Dervish! in the Truth you will find riches.</p>
