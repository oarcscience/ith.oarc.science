<p>His supplication in prostration of</p>  
<p>thankfulness</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O He, Whose generosity and Mercy increases by the plea of the</p>  
<p>seekers. O He Who possesses the kingdom of the Heavens and the</p>  
<p>skies, O He to Whom belongs the apparent and invisible treasures. My</p>  
<p>sins do not curtail Your obligations. I plead with You to deal with one in a</p>  
<p>way which befits You because You are possessor of Generosity, Mercy</p>  
<p>and Forgiveness. O Lord! O Lord! You have the power to punish. O</p>  
<p>Lord! I have become liable for Your punishment, now I don't have any</p>  
<p>excuse which I may put forth, nor any love which can be forwarded. I</p>  
<p>have submitted all my affairs to You and I confess that You forgive me</p>  
<p>and You are more aware of all the things better than me, all the sins and</p>  
<p>evils which I commit is presented to You. Therefore forgive me and have</p>  
<p>mercy on me and whatever is in Your knowledge forgive me because</p>  
<p>surely You are the most Honoured and exalted.</p>
