<p>His supplication for the thirteenth of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Glorified is Allah the Most High, Who ordained death for His bondsmen.</p>  
<p>Glory be to Allah Who judges with equity. Glory be to Allah the Powerful</p>  
<p>Sovereign, Praiseworthy. Glory be to Allah the Everlasting and Eternal</p>  
<p>and Who would increase the value of good deed for rewards while</p>  
<p>pronouncing the judgments. Glory be to Him befitting His glorious</p>  
<p>Countenance, the honour of His grandeur and His great rewards. Glory</p>  
<p>be to Him before Whose greatness everything lies prostrate. Glory be to</p>  
<p>Him before Whose power everything submits with acquiescence. Glory</p>  
<p>be to Him under Whose absolute Realm everything is humiliated.</p>  
<p>Glorified is He in Whose control are the reins of all matters. Glory be to</p>  
<p>Him Whose sanctity is evident in the earth. Hallowed is He Who</p>  
<p>dispelled all darkness with His Light. Glorified is Allah beside Whose</p>  
<p>religion no other religion is binding. Glory be to Him Who By His</p>  
<p>Omnipotence fixed a measure for everything, but none could measure</p>  
<p>His omnipotence. Glory be to Him Whose beginning is a command</p>  
<p>beyond all praise and the end of His every Command is the Knowledge</p>  
<p>which will never be lost. Glory be to Him Who is All-knowing, Whose</p>  
<p>informations are independent of any material media. Glory be to Him for</p>  
<p>Whom no secrecy is hidden Who knows the reckoning of sins and from</p>  
<p>Whom nothing belonging to the heaven and the earth is hidden.</p>  
<p>Glorified is Allah, Who is loving, Glory be to Him the only One. Glory be</p>  
<p>to the Most Sublime. Glory be to Him Who is Merciful and is not hasty.</p>  
<p>Glory be to Him Who is steadfast and not neglecting. Glory be to Him</p>  
<p>the generous and not miserly. It is You with Your sublimity in the</p>  
<p>heavens, Your omnipotence in the earth, Your astounding creation in</p>  
<p>the oceans and Your Light in the darkness. Glory be to You beside</p>  
<p>Whom there is no god, verily I was of the unjust ones. Glory be to Allah,</p>  
<p>the Most Mighty. Hallowed is the Gracious and Glorious. Glory be to</p>  
<p>You O the Holy! O the Holy! O the Holy! I beseech You, O the</p>
