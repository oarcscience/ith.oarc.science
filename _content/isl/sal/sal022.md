Dua for seeking forgiveness

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I ask You as all the praise belongs to You. There is no lord

other than You, You are the One to bestow favours. The originator of

the skies and the earth. The You are the possessor of Honour and

Majesty, Originator of the Heavens and the Earth. I am poor and

indigent and fearful and seeking refuge. I repent and seek forgiveness.

O Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and forgive all my

sins whether they are old or new. All those sins which I have performed.

O Allah don't make my problems difficult for me and don't give my

enemies an opportunity to mock at me because there is no one other

than You to ward off the difficulties and ease the hardships.
