His supplication for the fifth of the month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O My Lord! Praise be to You in the night when it retreats and at dawn

when it brightens; Praise be to You such that begins with Your thanks

and ends with Your pleasure, Praised are You in the Heavens and

worshipped are You by Your bondsmen. O God! Praise be to You at

times of decision, in happiness and in the hours of hardships for Your

manifest bounties and for Your bounties that are hidden and for Your

bounties that are in constant flow. Praise be to You Who are master of

praise, owner of praise and it began with Your self and it ends with
You.

All praise be to Allah in the beginning of the night, and at the end of
the

day, amongst the ancient people and amongst the people of later period

and in the expanse of the Heavens and the earth, even beyond that upto

where His creative will extends; so much so that He becomes pleased.

Praise be to Allah as numerous as His creatures, even more till he

becomes pleased; for He knows the account of everything and

surrounds everything mercifully. Praise to Allah Who created in six
days,

the Heavens and the earth and what is between them, then established

Himself upon the Arsh. Praise be to Allah Who raised the Heavens

without any visible pillar, Praise be to Allah Who adorned that lower

Heaven with Stars and made them as missiles to repulse away Satan.

Praise be to Allah Who made the Heavens a source of our sustenance

and the source of what we are promised; made the earth our bed and

grew for us therein various trees, corns, fruits and date trees of
various

colours. Praise be for the One Who made gardens in the earth and

grape vines and He cause the springs to flow therein and made therein

rivers. Praise be to Allah Who created mountains on this Earth lest it

should shake with us. And He made these mountains a stabilizing factor

for Earth. Praise be to Allah Who made the oceans subservient to us so

that ships might sail therein by His Command and we might get His

bounties through trade and commerce; and Who made this sea produce

valuable ornaments which we wear and provided fresh meat. Praise be

to Allah Who made the cattle subservient to us so that we might use

them as food and utilise some of them as our transport and has made for

us tents and clothes from their skins and also beds and a provision for
a

time. Praise be to Allah Who is honoured in His realm, Powerful on His

creatures, has free will in His will affairs, Praiseworthy for what He

creates, subtle in His wisdom, Benevolent towards His people. Through

greatness he has made His Mighty Glory and awe exclusively for

himself. Glorified is He Whose praise is manifest to His creatures,

Whose honour is apparent from His greatness ever Generous in

bestowal of good. Praise be to Allah Who has donned the cloak of

praise and enshrouded Himself with honoured pride, Who is sublime on

account of His greatness and emanation of His Light. Praise be to Allah

Who has neither any equal nor one to dispute in His affairs nor is there

anyone amongst His creatures to resemble Him. There is no god but He.

There is none to revoke what He decrees nor is there anyone to

abrogate what He decides. None is equal or parallel or similar or like

Him. None can defeat Him in having what He desires. Whose desires to

escape from Him cannot run away to anyone else nor can anyone save

him against Him. He made the creation without any basic material and

originated them without any model and exercises power over creation

without any helper. He raised the Heaven without any support and

spread the Earth in atmosphere without any base. Praised be to Allah

for what has already passed and what remains to pass for things that

are visible, for that which is not in our knowledge and for that which
was

in the past and that which is going to be in future. O Allah! Praise be
to

You for You do not take notice despite having knowledge of our sins,

grant mercy despite having power to punish and forgave our sins even

after granting a chance to repent. Praise be to You even in time of
trial

and at Your commands, so much so, that it does not fail to reach You or

fail to invoke Your pleasure, O the most Merciful!

And bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Purified Progeny.
