<p>His supplication for the fifth of the month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O My Lord! Praise be to You in the night when it retreats and at dawn</p>  
<p>when it brightens; Praise be to You such that begins with Your thanks</p>  
<p>and ends with Your pleasure, Praised are You in the Heavens and</p>  
<p>worshipped are You by Your bondsmen. O God! Praise be to You at</p>  
<p>times of decision, in happiness and in the hours of hardships for Your</p>  
<p>manifest bounties and for Your bounties that are hidden and for Your</p>  
<p>bounties that are in constant flow. Praise be to You Who are master of</p>  
<p>praise, owner of praise and it began with Your self and it ends with You.</p>  
<p>All praise be to Allah in the beginning of the night, and at the end of the</p>  
<p>day, amongst the ancient people and amongst the people of later period</p>  
<p>and in the expanse of the Heavens and the earth, even beyond that upto</p>  
<p>where His creative will extends; so much so that He becomes pleased.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Allah as numerous as His creatures, even more till he</p>  
<p>becomes pleased; for He knows the account of everything and</p>  
<p>surrounds everything mercifully. Praise to Allah Who created in six days,</p>  
<p>the Heavens and the earth and what is between them, then established</p>  
<p>Himself upon the Arsh. Praise be to Allah Who raised the Heavens</p>  
<p>without any visible pillar, Praise be to Allah Who adorned that lower</p>  
<p>Heaven with Stars and made them as missiles to repulse away Satan.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Allah Who made the Heavens a source of our sustenance</p>  
<p>and the source of what we are promised; made the earth our bed and</p>  
<p>grew for us therein various trees, corns, fruits and date trees of various</p>  
<p>colours. Praise be for the One Who made gardens in the earth and</p>  
<p>grape vines and He cause the springs to flow therein and made therein</p>  
<p>rivers. Praise be to Allah Who created mountains on this Earth lest it</p>  
<p>should shake with us. And He made these mountains a stabilizing factor</p>  
<p>for Earth. Praise be to Allah Who made the oceans subservient to us so</p>  
<p>that ships might sail therein by His Command and we might get His</p>  
<p>bounties through trade and commerce; and Who made this sea produce</p>  
<p>valuable ornaments which we wear and provided fresh meat. Praise be</p>  
<p>to Allah Who made the cattle subservient to us so that we might use</p>  
<p>them as food and utilise some of them as our transport and has made for</p>  
<p>us tents and clothes from their skins and also beds and a provision for a</p>  
<p>time. Praise be to Allah Who is honoured in His realm, Powerful on His</p>  
<p>creatures, has free will in His will affairs, Praiseworthy for what He</p>  
<p>creates, subtle in His wisdom, Benevolent towards His people. Through</p>  
<p>greatness he has made His Mighty Glory and awe exclusively for</p>  
<p>himself. Glorified is He Whose praise is manifest to His creatures,</p>  
<p>Whose honour is apparent from His greatness ever Generous in</p>  
<p>bestowal of good. Praise be to Allah Who has donned the cloak of</p>  
<p>praise and enshrouded Himself with honoured pride, Who is sublime on</p>  
<p>account of His greatness and emanation of His Light. Praise be to Allah</p>  
<p>Who has neither any equal nor one to dispute in His affairs nor is there</p>  
<p>anyone amongst His creatures to resemble Him. There is no god but He.</p>  
<p>There is none to revoke what He decrees nor is there anyone to</p>  
<p>abrogate what He decides. None is equal or parallel or similar or like</p>  
<p>Him. None can defeat Him in having what He desires. Whose desires to</p>  
<p>escape from Him cannot run away to anyone else nor can anyone save</p>  
<p>him against Him. He made the creation without any basic material and</p>  
<p>originated them without any model and exercises power over creation</p>  
<p>without any helper. He raised the Heaven without any support and</p>  
<p>spread the Earth in atmosphere without any base. Praised be to Allah</p>  
<p>for what has already passed and what remains to pass for things that</p>  
<p>are visible, for that which is not in our knowledge and for that which was</p>  
<p>in the past and that which is going to be in future. O Allah! Praise be to</p>  
<p>You for You do not take notice despite having knowledge of our sins,</p>  
<p>grant mercy despite having power to punish and forgave our sins even</p>  
<p>after granting a chance to repent. Praise be to You even in time of trial</p>  
<p>and at Your commands, so much so, that it does not fail to reach You or</p>  
<p>fail to invoke Your pleasure, O the most Merciful!</p>  
<p>And bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Purified Progeny.</p>
