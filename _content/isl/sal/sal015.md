His Dua expressing helplessness before the

Almighty

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I ask You in the capacity of the one who is helpless and

powerless. I ask You as the one who is indigent and in troubles. I plead

as the one who is weak and I present myself as the one who is

degraded and is immersed in sins. I ask You as the one who has

pledged his soul to You sincerely, covered his face with dust, have put

his forehead in Your presence, whose tears flow continuously due to

Your fear, who is crying in Your presence, who has accepted his evil

deeds in Your presence, who has forgotten Your advice, all his

arguments are rendered useless. By the right of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)

and his progeny and by Your right which is great and is pertaining to

these Holy personalities, send blessings on them as per Your splendor

and send blessing on the progeny of Your Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and grant

me better than what You have granted to those believers who have

preceded me and better than that which You have given to other

believers, and better than that which You will be granting to Your

servants who will be born till the Day of Judgment all the goodness in

this world and the Hereafter. O Generous! Pardon my past sins in this

sitting and grant me help to abstain from sins in future, and grant me

Divine help to do Hajj and Umrah this year and that Hajj and Umrah,

which is accepted by You. O Generous One. And grant me this privilege

as long as I am alive. O Generous! O Generous! Help me in fulfilling the

needs of my family. Help me in fulfilling my duties and responsibilities

protect me from the mischief of the Arabs and non-Arabs. Save me from

the mischief of deviation from the jinns and the humans. Protect me from

the harm of every walking creature on the land as You are the Lord of

their destiny. Surely my Lord is on the right (truth) path.
