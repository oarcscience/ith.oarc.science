<p>His Supplication for Thursday</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Praise is for Allah, His obligations are on our inhaling and exhaling of</p>  
<p>breathing and all thoughts of mind are so much that we cannot count.</p>  
<p>And His blessing in every moment that we cannot forget and in every</p>  
<p>condition there is a benefit that is not secret. And He is Pure, He</p>  
<p>subdues the strong and helps the weak and makes the poor rich and</p>  
<p>accepts ordinary deeds and bestows more his blessings. He has power</p>  
<p>over all things. And there is no other god except Allah. His perfectness</p>  
<p>of blessings, correct device, incontrovertible arguments and gives</p>  
<p>security as Allah is Great. His kingdom is safe and its foundations are</p>  
<p>firm. His arrangement is incomparable His settlement of account is very</p>  
<p>swift. And from all of His prophets Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) is best. O Allah</p>  
<p>bestow Your blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny. O My</p>  
<p>Lord! On the day of resurrection one who is frightened or trembled or</p>  
<p>terrified to be caught in resurrection day, or one who was proud and</p>  
<p>now felt ashamed and idolaters, afflicted in checking their accounts,</p>  
<p>terrified person pray to Allah. No shelter can hide him in this situation</p>  
<p>and no one can give them shelter except You. He was repenting for his</p>  
<p>bad deeds and was confessing for his great sins. Sorrows arrest him or</p>  
<p>an expansion of earth which becomes narrow for him and he is assured</p>  
<p>of his death and makes haste to repent before his death. If You do Your</p>  
<p>favour on him and forgive, then O my Lord! When my desires dies You</p>  
<p>are my wish, You are my shelter when I do not find any shelter. O my</p>  
<p>Lord, You are one and alone in faith and greatness and in Oneness.</p>  
<p>You are great in grandeur and magnificence. O my Lord, all praise is for</p>  
<p>You. No shelter can hide You. No time or circumstance can change You,</p>  
<p>You have created various things together in one place and created the</p>  
<p>light of dawn and avert the darkness of night and makes sweet and pure</p>  
<p>streams from the hard rocks and cold showers from the clouds and</p>  
<p>makes the Sun shine like a lamp and makes the moon and the stars like</p>  
<p>the towers of light for the world and created the things in the very</p>  
<p>beginning without any effort or without taking pain. As You are the</p>  
<p>master of all things and You are the Provider and Powerful over all</p>  
<p>things. One can be said respectable only if You respect him and One</p>  
<p>who is dishonoured by You is disgraced and if You make one fortunate</p>  
<p>he is lucky and if You make him unfortunate he is miserable and if You</p>  
<p>make one rich he is rich and if You make him dependant he is a beggar.</p>  
<p>O Allah! You are my guardian and my fortune and my sustenance is in</p>  
<p>Your hand. Send Your blessing on our chief, Muhammad and his</p>  
<p>progeny (s.a.w.a.). And do good turn with me, which is worthy of Your</p>  
<p>splendour. Be kind with one who is ignorant or falsehood has</p>  
<p>over-whelmed him and make a truce with the world and make</p>  
<p>commission of prohibition and sins. O my Lord, settle me with those who</p>  
<p>seek protection by repentance. Repentance is an asylum of a sinful</p>  
<p>person. Make me independent from the world by Your high power and</p>  
<p>kindness. Do not make me dependant of anyone. Forgive me on the Day</p>  
<p>of Judgment. No doubt You are kind and a more generous than others.</p>  
<p>Your esteem is honourable of all. O my Lord, Your Beautiful Names and</p>  
<p>great instances are overwhelming on the earth and the heaven. I in the</p>  
<p>hopeful manner turned my face towards You so do not send me empty</p>  
<p>handed from Your bounties. No doubt You are generous, graceful and</p>  
<p>kind to all; and take care of the people. I beg You to bless Muhammad</p>  
<p>Mustafa and his Progeny (s.a.w.a.) and increase my virtues and make</p>  
<p>the last stage of my journey good, conceal my sins. O my Lord save me</p>  
<p>from Your severe chastisement. You are merciful and generous. O Allah,</p>  
<p>my good and bad deeds keep me in between virtues and chastisement. I</p>  
<p>hope You shall conceal my bad virtues after confessing. O Forgiving, for</p>  
<p>the sake of Your Mercy, forgive me for false steps taken. Because O my</p>  
<p>Lord, there is no god except You to Whom I raise hope. No one is mine</p>  
<p>except You to Whom I raise hope. No one is mine except You that I</p>  
<p>request You to remove my poverty. O Forgiver of sins and troubles do</p>  
<p>not turn me away without blessings. O my Lord! Make me happy, as I</p>  
<p>will not be first one from the happiest men whom You made happy</p>  
<p>before. O Master of blessings and severe Chastiser, let me be so</p>  
<p>particular for salvation that misfortune cannot pass by and confer on me</p>  
<p>good fortune that no trouble can come near it. Send me divine help of</p>  
<p>love and fear of You and keep me safe from destruction and do not</p>  
<p>allow the fire of hell over me. You are only worthy for salvation and</p>  
<p>piety. I pray to You and You have promised acceptance so do not make</p>  
<p>me disappointed. For the sake of Your blessings, favours and</p>  
<p>providence I pray to You. O Allah You have power over all things. The</p>  
<p>matters of the world and resurrection have made me sad, so make me</p>  
<p>free as You are hearing and merciful to whom You like. Keep me among</p>  
<p>the pious and Your beloved people who will be along with Your</p>  
<p>Apostles, sincere, and martyrs in Paradise. They will be good virtuous</p>  
<p>people. How nice will be their companionship? O My Lord! Whatever the</p>  
<p>duties are on me, accomplish them especially the duties of my parents,</p>  
<p>brothers and sisters and forgive me and them with all believing men and</p>  
<p>women. Indeed You are very near, knower and hearer of prayers and</p>  
<p>very auspicious. O the kind, the most kind of all. My request is very easy</p>  
<p>for You. O Allah! Grant complete safety with Your blessings on</p>  
<p>Muhammad Mustafa (s.a.w.a.) and his infallible and most pure Progeny.</p>
