<p>His Supplication for removing troubles</p>  
<p>known as Dua-e-Yamani</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! You are the master of the Universe. There is no God except</p>  
<p>You. And I am Your believer. I have oppressed myself. I confess my sins.</p>  
<p>So forgive my sins There is no god but You, the forgiving. O Allah I</p>  
<p>praise You and You are deserving for this praise. You granted me</p>  
<p>whatever I wished for and sent me Your best favours and made me</p>  
<p>happy due to these favours and gave me Your favourable opinion. I</p>  
<p>received all these rewards. You removed my troubles. Give me good</p>  
<p>guidance and accept my supplications. As far as I pray to You with</p>  
<p>keenness and call You with sincerity of intention and I extremely keep</p>  
<p>hopes from You and I find You present everywhere. You are never too</p>  
<p>late to improve my dealings and take care of my condition and keep</p>  
<p>secret my faults. Your kindness is never separated for a moment from</p>  
<p>me. From the time You destined that I should think of making a</p>  
<p>presentation to You, You showed Your favour because I was Your</p>  
<p>liberated slave. O my Lord! All troubles and all confusions and sorrows</p>  
<p>and sufferings attacked severely from everywhere for Your decisions</p>  
<p>and kept me occupied in hard troubles. I do not remember if You have</p>  
<p>done anything except kindness and I have not seen anything except</p>  
<p>Your mercy. Your good vi rtues and Your grace continuously</p>  
<p>accompanied me. You bounties accompanied continuously. Fear did not</p>  
<p>frighten me due to Your great favour. You fulfilled my desires and</p>  
<p>accompanied me in my travel and increased my honour in my stability,</p>  
<p>recovery from illness and made my destination and relapse pleasant and</p>  
<p>did not allow my enemies to mock me. You attack those who attack me,</p>  
<p>and prevent me from enemy's enmity. O my Lord! There were some</p>  
<p>hidden enemies who tried hard to kill me. They showed their enmity</p>  
<p>openly and aimed at me to kill me and tried to mislead me. O My Lord!</p>  
<p>You saw that I am unable to bear all these and I cannot stand face their</p>  
<p>challenge and I am all alone and they are waiting for a chance and I am</p>  
<p>unable to succeed. Then O my Lord, You sent Your divine help and</p>  
<p>gave me support and made them weak. And in spite of their being</p>  
<p>numerous made them alone and gave me strength to achieve eminence</p>  
<p>and returned them with sorrow and they could not satisfy their desires</p>  
<p>and could not suppress their anger and demand with constant taunting</p>  
<p>to hide their weakness. When he returned turning his face, his party</p>  
<p>broke their promise and their desires became lifeless. O Allah! Many</p>  
<p>rebellious ones tried to be superior by their crafty tricks and tried to</p>  
<p>catch me and came to me silently just as wild beasts come to their prey</p>  
<p>and the prey waiting for a chance to escape from it. He was showing his</p>  
<p>flattering smile on the face. O My Lord! When You find his fraud in his</p>  
<p>mind, gave his mortal wound on his brain and pushed him in the pit,</p>  
<p>which he dug by himself. You turned him back and wounded by stones</p>  
<p>and swords of his own and strangled his throat with his own ropes and</p>  
<p>choked the throat of his own fraud and made him regret of his own. So</p>  
<p>he became disappointed and weak. Though he was restive in the</p>  
<p>beginning and now he became despicable and helpless. He was very</p>  
<p>strong in the beginning and he has become disgraced and a prisoner.</p>  
<p>He wanted to see me tied in the strings and if I would be caught and if</p>  
<p>You would not send Your blessing, the same calamity would befall me</p>  
<p>instead of him. Now all praise to Him Who has power over all things and</p>  
<p>cannot be entangled in it, and the reality of his guardianship is</p>  
<p>considerate. He is the Self-Existing and never inattentive. He is the</p>  
<p>forbearing and not debased. O my Lord! I call You and seek protection</p>  
<p>from You and rely on Your quick acceptance, and I know it very well that</p>  
<p>You dispel my enemies and I know whoever comes under Your</p>  
<p>protection, never becomes sad nor the hard troubles shake him. You</p>  
<p>give him relief to those who take help from You. O my Lord! Make me</p>  
<p>free by means of Your divine power and make me free from the enmities</p>  
<p>of the enemy. O Allah! There were so many evils in my way but You</p>  
<p>cleared them. There were so many bounties, that You granted and</p>  
<p>flowed the streams by Your divine power and there were so many</p>  
<p>calamities on my way that You destroyed. You spread Your bounties</p>  
<p>and destroyed the darkness of sorrows. You dispersed the clouds of</p>  
<p>calamities and put on the robes of honour. And established the future</p>  
<p>incidents when You will ask for anything, nothing can make You tired.</p>  
<p>Whenever I think of You, no one can prevent me. O Allah! Many jealous</p>  
<p>persons wanted to be superior and made me unhappy by facile tongue</p>  
<p>and looked at me with cursory glance and made me dishonoured and</p>  
<p>made me habitual as he was before. But You helped me in this matter. O</p>  
<p>Allah, I had many good faiths and You proved it and removed my poverty</p>  
<p>and ignorance and increased my livelihood. You removed my weakness</p>  
<p>and gave me strength and solved difficulties. Also changed my poverty</p>  
<p>and bestowed bounties. We cannot ask what You are doing and there is</p>  
<p>no stinginess whatever You grant. You granted me whatever I asked</p>  
<p>and if I didn't ask, You preceded first and whenever I requested, You</p>  
<p>never disappointed me. You refused to do anything except rewards,</p>  
<p>obligation and blessings and my situation is that I disobeyed Your</p>  
<p>commands and didn't do anything. I exceeded Your limits and I became</p>  
<p>negligent about Your wrath and devoted Your enemy (Shaitan). Even</p>  
<p>then You abstained from executing Your rewards and did not prevent</p>  
<p>(unlucky) me from Your anger. O My Lord! This is the stage where Your</p>  
<p>confessing accused has failed to confess. To pay Your dues and gives</p>  
<p>evidence that Your bounties and guardianship is completed. O My Lord!</p>  
<p>O Cherisher! Grant me that, which I can reach by means of Your bounty</p>  
<p>and guidance for Your obedience and can be safe from Your wrath,</p>  
<p>because You can do whatever You like and can order whatever You</p>  
<p>like. You have power over all things. O my Lord! My praise is for You</p>  
<p>and will remain forever till centuries with various purities by way of</p>  
<p>glorifications. I shall praise You only for Your remembrance and Your</p>  
<p>permission and I shall mention Your Greatness in a friendly manner. I</p>  
<p>shall mention Your qualities for a long time to falsify idolatry. As no one</p>  
<p>is Your helper and no one is Your partner in Your sovereignty. None</p>  
<p>could see You when You bound down the things for different intention.</p>  
<p>You have created the whole universe of different type so that the human</p>  
<p>being cannot tear the curtains of the invisible world. I believe in You but I</p>  
<p>am beseized in Your grandeur. There is no particular of Your eternal</p>  
<p>existence and no possibilities of Your personal appearance and no high</p>  
<p>similarity of status can reach to You and no deep mental thoughts can</p>  
<p>reach to You and no observer's eyes can see Your omnipotence. Your</p>  
<p>divine attribute is highest than human attributes. Your honour and</p>  
<p>grandeur is more eminent than human attributes. If You want to</p>  
<p>increase, it cannot decrease and if You want to decrease, it cannot</p>  
<p>increase. There was no one when You created the world. There was no</p>  
<p>risk of any opposition then You sent the spirits in the world. According to</p>  
<p>the law of attributes the dumb and senses are tired in Your actual mystic</p>  
<p>knowledge. How can attributes come at Your court or how can</p>  
<p>poisonous nature enclose You? Because You are the Powerful and</p>  
<p>Pure and Eternal and the invisible hand of Heaven forever. You are</p>  
<p>Unique. No one is there and no one will be there except You. The</p>  
<p>deepest ways and entangled in worries in Your domination and eyes of</p>  
<p>prudence are tired to understand You and the kings are bent down and</p>  
<p>are helpless and hang their faces down in shame and beseech before</p>  
<p>Your dignity and bowed down their heads in shame. Everything is</p>  
<p>obedient in comparison of Your nature and the necks of all people are</p>  
<p>bent before Your sovereignty and on the basis of Your colourful</p>  
<p>attributes, mentally efforts are misled. That is why whoever think for</p>  
<p>Your praise his eyes turn back and his sense confused and amazed. O</p>  
<p>Allah! Your Praise is coherent, continuously and strong forever and</p>  
<p>never perish. The praise in Your limited world would not become less to</p>  
<p>intimate the knowledge of God. Your praise in beautiful nights and bright</p>  
<p>dawn, in dryness and wetness, in the morning, noon and night daily</p>  
<p>repeating. O Allah! You made me free from Your Guidance and took me</p>  
<p>in Your protection and did not force me more than my strength because</p>  
<p>You are pleased by my obedience. If I give thank You verbally or make</p>  
<p>an attempt, I cannot fulfill Your magnificent rights with either thanks nor</p>  
<p>changes in Your mercy because there is no other god except You.</p>  
<p>Nothing is concealed in Your sight. Nothing is secret for You. You</p>  
<p>cannot lose the absorbed properly in the darkness of concealment. Of</p>  
<p>course, when You want to do anything, it flourished before saying let</p>  
<p>there be and before intending. O Allah! Your praise, by which You have</p>  
<p>praised Yourself and praiseworthy people praise You and the great</p>  
<p>people praise Your grandeur, respected people mentioned Your</p>  
<p>greatness. Hence I am all alone in a twinkling of an eye or less than this</p>  
<p>time. I praise You more than others and all who have sincerity of</p>  
<p>intention and who love to have an intimate knowledge of You and all</p>  
<p>created people and animals, I praise You is less. O Allah! You have</p>  
<p>given strength in my tongue to praise You. I thank for it, because</p>  
<p>whatever trouble You have given me for this matter is very less and</p>  
<p>what You have promised me after expressing this is very great. You</p>  
<p>granted me Your favour from the very beginning was Your graciousness.</p>  
<p>Then You commanded to thank for Your graciousness was Your</p>  
<p>justification and promised to give great rewards. You granted me my</p>  
<p>livelihood so that You can take trial of me and granted me more instead</p>  
<p>of less and an ordinary debt and kept me in Your safety and did not</p>  
<p>entrust me in Your hard trial. You bestowed me good livelihood and</p>  
<p>health and granted me more grace and promised to grant a high position</p>  
<p>along with conveying good news of great grade of safety and chosen me</p>  
<p>for intercession of our great and best of all Prophets, Muhammad</p>  
<p>Mustafa (s.a.w.a.) our Holy Prophet (as the friend of God, intercessor in</p>  
<p>hereafter, Companion of sinners and the venerable person (s.a.w.a.). O</p>  
<p>My Lord! Forgive my sins. There is no other place for forgiveness. No</p>  
<p>one can obliterate without Your forgiveness. Give me surely in this</p>  
<p>moment so that all the worldly troubles are easy to bear. Make one a</p>  
<p>righteous person for Your inclination and forgive me. Grant me miracles</p>  
<p>and give me the guidance to thank for Your bounties. As You are my</p>  
<p>Lord, the High and Unique and the knower. No one can disobey Your</p>  
<p>command and no one can prevent You from Your judgment. I have faith;</p>  
<p>You are my Lord and the Provider. You are the Master of the earth and</p>  
<p>the Heaven, invisible and the knower and the Great. O Allah! Show me</p>  
<p>the right way. I pray and thanks for bounties and invoke blessings. I</p>  
<p>seek protection from enemies&#146; tyranny, from traitors&#146; rebellion, and from</p>  
<p>the jealousy of a jealous one. O Allah! I attack my enemy with Your help</p>  
<p>and seek friendship of friends from You and I am hopeful for inefficient</p>  
<p>benefits of Your blessings and various kinds of provisions and bounties,</p>  
<p>because You are Allah and there is no other Allah. Your praise is</p>  
<p>everywhere and Your hands are open for generosity. There is no one to</p>  
<p>challenge Your commands. There is no one to dispute in Your world. No</p>  
<p>one can appeal to anyone against Your commands. You can get hold of</p>  
<p>anyone. No one can become an owner without Your permission. You</p>  
<p>are the master of blessings and rewards, Unique and Able. Your purities</p>  
<p>are mentioned in Your pure light. You are respected with a robe of</p>  
<p>honour. You are Great due to Your nature and grandeur. You have</p>  
<p>mastery over the splendid light. You continuously increase Your</p>  
<p>adornment of Your majesty. O Allah! Your magnificent praise, former</p>  
<p>obligations, great kingship, generosity and possession of nature are all</p>  
<p>elegant for You and continuously praise that never comes to end and</p>  
<p>from border to ever last never ended. Because You have created me</p>  
<p>from the progeny of Adam (a.s.) and made me healthy and spotless that</p>  
<p>I can see and hear properly and protect me from physical deformity and</p>  
<p>mental weakness. There is no trouble on my assimilation and no defect</p>  
<p>in my intellect. Your obligations, and good favours and bounties never</p>  
<p>prevent to do a favour. On the contrary, increased my livelihood and</p>  
<p>made me superior on the worldly people and gave me the sense of</p>  
<p>hearing so that I can hear Your reinforcement properly and gave me</p>  
<p>good sight that I can see Your natural phenomena. You became my</p>  
<p>helper and bestowing a heart that can observe Your greatness, You</p>  
<p>gave me Your protection. The tongue confesses Your oneness.</p>  
<p>Undoubtedly I am very thankful for Your graciousness. I am a confessor</p>  
<p>of Your rights and I am a plaintiff in Your court for my troubles and</p>  
<p>obstacles, because You are Eternal and everlasting. You are the</p>  
<p>inheritor of the inhabitants of the earth and You and only one and best</p>  
<p>among the inheritors. O Allah! Do not restrain Your favours and do not</p>  
<p>send Your wrath as a punishment. Do not make any changes whatever I</p>  
<p>have and do not disappoint me from Your strong chastity. If I do not</p>  
<p>remember Your favours and rewards You remember Your forgiveness</p>  
<p>and it is very important for me. You accepted my prayer when I raised</p>  
<p>my head for Your praise. (To raise the head was for Your praise only)</p>  
<p>and not for mention of my major share. If You increased it, there is no</p>  
<p>scarcity for You and if You decrease my livelihood in distribution, then it</p>  
<p>would be excess in Your property. O Allah! Your expanse knowledge is</p>  
<p>equal to Your praise and according to quantity of Your expanse</p>  
<p>blessings is more than current existing things. The continuous repetition</p>  
<p>of Your praise is of equal weight of Your beautiful names and bounties.</p>  
<p>O My Lord! Complete Your favours in my remaining life as You obliged</p>  
<p>in my present life because I want to be reach by means of Your</p>  
<p>Oneness and pronouncing Islamic Creed, and congregational prayers</p>  
<p>and by means of Your beautiful names I say, You have created human</p>  
<p>beings by Your greatness and superiority. Now man cannot go</p>  
<p>anywhere leaving Your supremacy. O Allah! I pray by means of Your</p>  
<p>secret names, do not deprive me from Your favours and benefits of Your</p>  
<p>miracles, and do not entrust me to anyone except You. Do not entrust</p>  
<p>me in the hand of my enemy. Do not put me in the guardianship of my</p>  
<p>soul and do Your favour from Your great favours. Make my good deeds</p>  
<p>beautiful in the world, fulfill my desires here and make my last return in</p>  
<p>hereafter beautiful because You are not dependent on Your gifts and</p>  
<p>pulling hand does not increase Your wealth of great blessings. Your</p>  
<p>great rewards do not decrease Your endowment and Your great favours</p>  
<p>do not affect Your current rewards. You have no fear of the shame of</p>  
<p>poverty, that You pull Your hand from giving, and You have no danger of</p>  
<p>poverty so that benefit of Your kingdom should be less. O my Lord!</p>  
<p>Make my heart full of true faith on You and do not make me fearless</p>  
<p>from Your wrath and do not make me oblivious from Your remembrance</p>  
<p>and do not give up keeping a secret, do not make anyone superior on</p>  
<p>me except You, do not disappoint me from Your grace but hide me in</p>  
<p>Your efficiency, and do not disappoint me from Your beautiful rewards.</p>  
<p>Be my helper in my confusion and supporter in my embarrassment. Be</p>  
<p>my redress and release me from all difficulties and errors and save me</p>  
<p>from all troubles and settled Your bounties and save me from my wrath</p>  
<p>and turn out all the difficulties, destructions and wrath from me, grant me</p>  
<p>honour to secure the Holy Quran and improve my condition and help me</p>  
<p>in the world and in the hereafter, improve the condition of my children,</p>  
<p>increase my livelihood in plenty, pay attention to me and do not be</p>  
<p>inattentive. O Allah! Make me achieve eminence, do not despise me.</p>  
<p>Have pity on me, do not curse me and help me, do not make me alone.</p>  
<p>Make me successful and do not make anyone succeed on me. Remove</p>  
<p>my difficulties and give me spaciousness. Accept my prayer soon and</p>  
<p>remove my difficulties. You have power over all things. Everything is</p>  
<p>easy for You as You are the Generous and the Sovereign.</p>
