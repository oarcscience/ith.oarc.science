<p>His supplication for the tenth of the month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O my Allah! Many were the things to which I was inattentive, but You</p>  
<p>created awareness in me. Thus You made it easy for me to draw</p>  
<p>benefits therefrom and removed the ill effects thereof and saved me from</p>  
<p>total deprivations therefrom. Without myself knowing it, You protected</p>  
<p>me. There is no power or might but You. So praise be to You for Your</p>  
<p>kindness and favours. O Allah! Many, many were the matters of which I</p>  
<p>was unaware, but You guided me, corrected my ideas about them,</p>  
<p>favoured me with good insight, made me successful in my aims and</p>  
<p>made help available to me, so praise be to You beyond all measures, O</p>  
<p>Lord of the Worlds! O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) the Ummi</p>  
<p>Prophet, agreeable, pleased, holy, pious, blessed, clean, sacrosanct,</p>  
<p>guarding against evil, pure and faithful and also bless his holy and</p>  
<p>virtuous progeny as You blessed Ibrahim (a.s.) and his children. Verily</p>  
<p>You are Praiseworthy and sublime. O Allah! I beseech You in the name</p>  
<p>of all Your attributes to bestow Your Blessings on Muhammad, Your</p>  
<p>prophet and his Progeny and to kindly forgive all my sins whether past</p>  
<p>or present, big or small, open or secret, known or unknown to me which</p>  
<p>You have reckoned with but I have forgotten. O Allah! O Allah! O the</p>  
<p>Beneficent! O the Beneficent! O the Merciful! O the Merciful! Hallowed</p>  
<p>are You O Allah! with Your praise. There is no god save You. I ask Your</p>  
<p>forgiveness and turn penitent towards You. You are my Allah, the place</p>  
<p>to lodge all complaints and for all needs. You have commanded Your</p>  
<p>bondsmen to invoke You and You have promised to accept the same,</p>  
<p>Verily You are ever Nigh and ready Answerer. O my Allah! Hallowed are</p>  
<p>You. You are with all praise: and there is no god except You. How lofty</p>  
<p>is Your name amidst the dwellers of Heavens and how Praiseworthy are</p>  
<p>Your deeds amongst the inhabitants of the Earth! How profusely are</p>  
<p>Your bounties diffused on the earth and in the Oceans! O Allah! praise</p>  
<p>be to You. There is no god save You. I seek forgiveness from You and</p>  
<p>turn penitent to You. You are affectionate and to You one should turn for</p>  
<p>help. You caused the rain to fall from the clouds and bestow livelihood.</p>  
<p>You distribute the sustenance, decide about the ages, bestow upon</p>  
<p>mankind their requirements, irrigate the land, grow the fruits. You are the</p>  
<p>possessor of great blessings. O Allah! Praise be to You. There is no</p>  
<p>God beside You. I seek mercy and turn penitent towards You. You are</p>  
<p>hearer of complaints and the object of our inclination. You cause the rain</p>  
<p>to fall. The thunder and the angles glorify You with praise out of fear for</p>  
<p>You. The Arsh, the low columns of the sky, the winds, things in between</p>  
<p>them and below, under the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars,</p>  
<p>illuminations, the darkness, the light, the shadow, pleasant shades of</p>  
<p>Heaven and the heat of the Hell, all praise You. Glory be to You. You</p>  
<p>set the mountains in motion and blow that winds. Hallowed are You.</p>  
<p>There is no god save You and I seek Your pardon and to You I turn</p>  
<p>penitent. Hallowed are You. I beseech You for the sake of Your</p>  
<p>reverential name, in the name of the establishers of Your Arsh, those in</p>  
<p>Your Heavens and Earth, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, the</p>  
<p>darkness, the turbulent seas, those in the abyss, and those between the</p>  
<p>east and west. Glory be to You. O Allah! Praise be to You. There is no</p>  
<p>god save You. I seek forgiveness and turn penitent to You. Glory be to</p>  
<p>You. There is no God except You. I pray to You for the grant of my</p>  
<p>solicitations and for enabling me to thank You in weal and woe. Glory be</p>  
<p>to You for There is no god save You. When You glanced at the skies,</p>  
<p>their layers became solidified and when You glanced at the pillars of the</p>  
<p>earth, their ends trembled. Glory be to You. When You looked at what is</p>  
<p>in the oceans and their storms, they began foaming. You are Glorified.</p>  
<p>All this happened because of fear and awe from You. You are Holy. You</p>  
<p>glance at East and West and at what is between them in the</p>  
<p>atmosphere, which You are encompassing, made them submit with</p>  
<p>humility towards the glory of the most glorious face of Yours. Glory be to</p>  
<p>You for there was none to help You in raising the skies and in</p>  
<p>establishing Your sublime Authority. Glory be to You for there was none</p>  
<p>present when You spread and stretched forth the earth, and then made</p>  
<p>it a resting place. Who can excel You in Your powers? None. Glory be to</p>  
<p>You. Who was there to have seen You when You established the</p>  
<p>mountains and blessed Your creatures by making them strong and firm?</p>  
<p>None. Glory be to You. Who was there to have helped You when You</p>  
<p>set the seas in motion surrounding the earth? None. Hallowed are You.</p>  
<p>There is no god save You. Praise be to You. There is nothing that can</p>  
<p>be Your equal or rival. There is nothing that can escape from You or can</p>  
<p>get rid of Your powers. O Allah! Glory be to You. There is no god beside</p>  
<p>You. When my insight thinks of Your awe the eyes weep on the</p>  
<p>unawareness of my heart. Glory be to You. How great is Your</p>  
<p>forbearance, how nicely Your order is in force and how beautiful is the</p>  
<p>creation created by You! Glory be to You! There is no god save You.</p>  
<p>None can reach the limit of Your praise or the essence of Your reality, or</p>  
<p>know the extent of Your realm. Glory be to You. In Your presence eyes</p>  
<p>become bewildered and hearts get filled with fright of You and are</p>  
<p>awe-struck with Your grandeur. Glory be to You O Allah! There is no</p>  
<p>god save You. Praise be to You. How forbearing! How Just, and how</p>  
<p>Compassionate and Merciful! And how Great Listener and what an</p>  
<p>All-knowing You are. Glory be to You! There is no god but You.</p>  
<p>Disappoint me not of Your mercy and take me not to task. I beseech</p>  
<p>Your mercy. O the Lord of the Worlds, Grant this Prayer!</p>
