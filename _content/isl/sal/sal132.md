His supplication for the eighth of the month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O God! Praise be to You equal to the number of trees and leaves,

Praise equal to the number of pebbles and stones and hair. Praise be to

You as numerous as the number of days of this world and the world

Hereafter. Praise be to You equal to the number of stars of the Heaven

and praise be to You equal to the number of the drops of rain and those

of ocean water. Praise be to You equal to the number of things You

created. Praise be to You equal to the population of Your Arsh. Praise

be to You equal to the number of Your words. Praise be to You till Your

pleasure is achieved. Praise be to You equal to the number of things

Your knowledge encompasses. Praise be to You equal to the number of

things You have taken account of. Praise be to You for all the things

Your sight has circumspected. Praise be to You for things to which Your

sublimity has reached. Praise be to You for the things Your mercy has

enveloped. Praise be to You for things the treasure of which is within

Your control. Praise be to You for the things included in Your Book.

Praise be to You, persistent, everlasting and endless. Praise so much

so, that Your creatures cannot assess it. O Allah! Praise be to You

equal to the number of times one might have invoked You and the

prayers were granted. Praise be to You for all Your attributes and for
all

Your bounties whether secret or open, first or last and manifest or

hidden. Praise be to You for what was and what is not and what is going

to be. Praise be to You innumerable, in the manner Your countless

bounties bestowed on us. O Allah! O Lord! All praise are for You. The

entire realm belongs to You. Within Your control is all good. To You is

the return of everything hidden or manifest. Praise be to You on Your

trials, on Your favours, whether present or past; particularly those

shown towards me by gifting existence and guiding me to the right path

for You have created a good creation and gave me the best guidance

and You taught and taught me the best. O Allah! Praise be to You for

Your testing me by gracious trial and for Your favours shown to me.

Many a hardship You have dispelled from me, many a grief You have

warded off and many a difficulty You have solved and granted me ease.

Praise be to You for Your bounties, some of them I have forgotten, for

some I have offered my thanks to You others not even acknowledged by

me, some of them have already passed and some still remain. O Allah!

Praise be to You equal to the number of times You have granted

pardons and salvation and praise be to You the number of times You

have given cover to my lapses. Praise be to You as numerous as the

number of Your blessings and favours. Praise be to You for setting my

affairs in order and for testing us in a gracious manner. O Allah!
Praise

be to You for You really deserve to be praised and worshipped and

thanked, O the best of all those that are Praiseworthy! O the most

Merciful!
