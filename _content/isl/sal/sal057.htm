<p>(56)</p>  
<p>His supplication seeking protection from</p>  
<p>the enemies</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Say: O Allah, Master of the Kingdom. You give the kingdom to</p>  
<p>whosoever You please and take away the kingdom from whomsoever</p>  
<p>You please and You exalt whom You please and abase whom You</p>  
<p>please, in Your hand is the good, surely You have power over all things.</p>  
<p>You make the night to pass into the day and You make the day to pass</p>  
<p>into the night and You bring forth the living from the dead and You bring</p>  
<p>forth the dead from the living and You give sustenance to whom You</p>  
<p>please without measure. Allah is great! Allah is great! Allah is great! In</p>  
<p>front of His Majesty the entire creation has bowed before Him. And in</p>  
<p>front of His Honour every great thing feels humiliated. No one from</p>  
<p>among them can reach me whereas Allah has dispersed them into parts,</p>  
<p>their arrogance destroyed them. Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the</p>  
<p>dawn from the evil of what He has created and from the evil of utterly</p>  
<p>dark night when it comes. And from the evil of those who blow on knots,</p>  
<p>and from the evil of the envious when he envies. And say: I seek refuge</p>  
<p>in the Lord of men the king of men, the God of men from the evil of the</p>  
<p>whisperings of the slinking (Shaitan) who whispers into the hearts of</p>  
<p>men from among the jinn and the men. O enemies the doors in front of</p>  
<p>me are closed for the people of future and past, now all of them are</p>  
<p>deviated and accursed. I rebuke and scold you by the effect of the</p>  
<p>chapters of 'Saffat' and 'Zariyaat' and 'Mursalat' and 'Naziyaat'. You all</p>  
<p>turn into dust, so that neither you can lay your hands on me nor on any</p>  
<p>other believer. We would seal their mouths and their hands would speak</p>  
<p>and their legs would witness about what they have earned. This is the</p>  
<p>day on which they shall not speak and permission shall not be given to</p>  
<p>them so that they should offer excuses. Their eyes will be blinded,</p>  
<p>tongues will be tied and the neck bowed for the Creator King of the</p>  
<p>universe. O Allah by the letter 'Meem' and 'Ain' and 'Faa' and the light of</p>  
<p>the body and the shining of the morning and whatever is destined for</p>  
<p>me. O the possessor of Power, save me from the awe and fear of the</p>  
<p>tyrants. Allah is overpowering and no one can run away from His domain</p>  
<p>when help of Allah comes the victory is near and if Allah helps you no</p>  
<p>one can overpower you. Allah has decided that He and His prophets will</p>  
<p>be overpowering everybody. Without any doubt Allah is strong and the</p>  
<p>possessor of power, whoever seeks refuge in Allah is safe and no one</p>  
<p>can give strength except Allah the great.</p>
