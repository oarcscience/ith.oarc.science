His supplication for the twenty-fourth of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Protect my faith, protect my body, and protect my hearing, and

seeing and let these two be my inheritors. O the Creator! You have no

beginning. O the Everlasting! You have no end. O the Ever-living! Death

touches You not. O Who gives life to the dead! O Who watches the

deeds of every soul! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, and

do with me in the manner befitting Your dignity. O Allah! The Cleaver of

the dawn Who has made the night for rest, and the sun and the moon

for reckoning (time), repay my loan, and protect me from poverty, and

make the faculties of hearing and seeing beneficial for me, and bestow

upon me enough strength to strive in Your way, O the Most Merciful! O

Allah! You are the Most Merciful, There is no god save You, and

innovator like to You, before You, Everlasting with no end, Ever-living

Whom death touches not, the Creator of what is seen and of what is not

seen. Every day You are in a new splendorous manifestation. Bless

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny. Your dignity demands that there

should be forgiveness from You for me, my parents, my children and my

brothers, O the Most Merciful! O Allah! You are All-knowing without

being informed. All Praise be therefore to You. O Allah! O Allah! Allah
is

my Lord. I do not associate anything with Him. He is All-hearing,

All-seeing. Vision perceives Him not and He perceives all vision. He is

the Subtle, All-aware. O Allah! I beseech You and You do what You wish

and I turn to You through Muhammad Your Prophet, Prophet of mercy

(s.a.w.a.). O Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)! I turn through you to Allah, your
Lord

and my Lord, for the fulfillment of my needs, and that He may bless you

and your pure and purified progeny, and O Allah! Deal with me as it

befits You. O Allah! I beseech You with that name of Yours with which

walking is possible on water in the manner one walks on leveled ground.

And I beseech You with that name of Yours which Musa (a.s.) invoked

You from the auspicious Mount Sinai, and the invocation was accepted

by You and You cast down upon him love from You. And I beseech You

with that name of Yours with which Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) invoked You

and You thereupon forgave him the past, and perfected on him Your

bounties. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and do with me

that which befits You. O Allah! I beseech You in the name of the

honoured portions of Your Throne and in the name of utmost mercy of

Your Book. And I beseech You with Your sublime name, Your glory,

Your perfect words from the influence of which neither the pious nor the

non-virtuous can escape. And I beseech You, O Allah, O the Beneficent,

O the merciful, O the Glorious, O Allah the One, the matchless, the

Unique, the Needles, Firm in justice, There is no god save You the

Mighty and All-wise, You are Peerless, the Great and the Sublime to

bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, and to make me enter the

Paradise, forgiven without any reckoning and bestow on me out of Your

blessings, generosity compassion, mercy and favours such that it befits

You. O Allah! Spoil not my name and disfigure not my body, break not

my back with trials and let not my enemies mock at me, O the Generous!

O Allah! I seek refuge with You from riches making me rebellious against

You and from poverty making me forget everything - Commands and

Prohibitions, and from desires leading me to ruination and from deeds

causing disgrace. I believe in One and Matchless Lord - I associate

none with Him and call none other than Him as deity nor do I accept

anyone else beside Him as my Master. O Allah! Bless Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, and make those things easy for me the

hardships of which I am afraid of, and lighten those affairs which I
feel

difficult, and make those things non-fatiguing which are tiring and help

me to overcome the harshness of problems I am afraid of, and with Your

pleasure grant me happiness in exchange of distress in the worldly life

and in the life of Hereafter. O Allah! Grant me the sincerity of
Prophets

in my reliance on You, and the efficacy of accepted invocations in my

invocations and make my deeds like the deeds which find acceptance

with You. O Allah! Grant me ability to carry out the commands the

burden whereof You lay on me, and lay not on me the burden of the

commands which I am unable to carry out. Allah is sufficient for me as

the Most Excellent Protector. O Allah! Send help for me and not against

me. Decide in my favour against those who behave unjustly with me,

devise for me and contrive not against me. Guide me and make the

guidance easy for me. O Allah! I entrust to You under Your trusteeship

my belief, my trust the result of my deeds, and all the bounties of the

world and those of the Hereafter bestowed upon me by You, verily You

do not lose the trust of others. There is neither anyone to protect me

against You nor do I have any refuge beside You. O Allah! Bless

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and leave me not alone to myself

even for the winking of an eye. And take not back the good which You

have bestowed upon me, for verily none can withhold that which You

bestow, and none can bestow that which You withhold. The good luck of

any striver makes him not independent of You. O our Lord! Grant us

good in this world and good in the Hereafter and save us from the

torment of Hellfire. And bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his virtuous

Progeny! O the Most Merciful!
