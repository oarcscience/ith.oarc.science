\(88\)

His supplication while riding his horse to

battlefield

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Glory be to Him who made this subservient to us and we were not able

to do it and surely to our Lord we must return. Praise is for Allah on
all

His bounties upon us and mighty Grace, which He bestowed upon us.
