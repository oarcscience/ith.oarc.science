Another of his supplications to be recited in

the morning

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Praise for Allah Who has not left me dead or sick in the morning,
neither

my veins have any sign of defect nor He has accounted me for my

horrible deeds. Neither He has discontinued my sequence nor made me

a disbeliever nor I am a denier of my Lord, neither I am terrified of my

faith nor do I doubt my intellect nor punished in the chastisment the

earlier nations. I am like the one who has done injustice on his soul.
My

Lord, Your proof is upon me and no proof of mine is upon You. I do not

possess the power that I gain something except Your religion in which

nobody is saved, except whom You save. O Allah! I seek refuge that in

spite of Your Self-Sufficiency I remain dependent and I remain deviated

after Your guidance or I remain degraded in Your kingdom or I remain

oppressed in Your domain. O Allah! My soul is the best bounty from

among Your bounties which You will take from me. O Allah I seek refuge

in You, that without Your permission I do not put my foot down and that

is the first bounty which You will take from the other bounties or else
be

a target of corruption and deviation, or our wishes makes us Your

obedient other than that guidance which has come to us through You.
