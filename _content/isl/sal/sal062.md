His supplication, which he recited every

morning and evening

He (a.s.) had recited this Dua on the bed of the

Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) on the Night of Hijrat.

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I am saved in the morning and evening by the promise of Your

safety. That covenant with which no intention can be compared and no

one can achieve greatness over it. Send blessing on the progeny of

Your Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the shield of love and with the

tight armour, save me from everyone who overpowers and who attacks

suddenly and from the fearful place of Your creatures and from the fear

of silent things grant me sanctity. By the right of those who accept

sincerely, save me as a fort from all those people who wish to harm me.

And due to the ties that they believe is their right. I am with them and

between them and because of them. I love them who love them and I am

away from them who are away from them. So bless Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and You grant me protection. For their sake

save me from everything which I fear.

O the great one I have warded of all my enemies by taking the name of

the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and We have made before

them a barrier and a barrier behind them, then We have covered them

over so that they do not see.
