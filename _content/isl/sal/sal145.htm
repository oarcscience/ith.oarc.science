<p>(144)</p>  
<p>His supplication for the twenty-first of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! Make me of those who believe in the Unseen, establish prayer</p>  
<p>and give in charity of that which You have bestowed on them. Guide me</p>  
<p>to the right path. Reckon me as one of those who have received</p>  
<p>guidance from You. Teach me those words which You taught to Adam</p>  
<p>whereby his repentance was granted. Doubtlessly You are Beneficent</p>  
<p>and Merciful. O Allah! Reckon me amongst those who establish prayer,</p>  
<p>and pay Zakat. Regard me as one of those humble people who seek</p>  
<p>Your help with patience and prayers. Reckon me amongst those who</p>  
<p>have no fear and grief. O Allah! Take me as one of those who act with</p>  
<p>patience and when any calamity befalls them, they say: Verily we are</p>  
<p>from Allah and to Him we shall return. Send Your Blessings and Peace</p>  
<p>on me and reckon me amongst those who have been guided aright. O</p>  
<p>Allah! Keep me steadfast in my belief in the life here as well as in the life</p>  
<p>of Hereafter and reckon me not amongst the unjust one. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Regard me as one of those whom the angels take away from this world</p>  
<p>in a good state and the Angels while receiving them will say: Peace be</p>  
<p>on You; enter you the garden of Paradise for what you were doing.</p>  
<p>Make me one of those who have shown patience and who put their trust</p>  
<p>in Allah. O Allah! Grant me good in this world and good in the Hereafter,</p>  
<p>save me from the torment of the Hell-fire and regard me as one of those</p>  
<p>who guarded themselves and as one of the virtuous ones. Glory be to</p>  
<p>You, verily I was of the unjust ones. Accept my invocation and save me</p>  
<p>from the Hell-fire, O the Most Merciful! O Allah! Make me one of the</p>  
<p>virtuous who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts get thrilled with awe</p>  
<p>of His Glory and remain steadfast on what befalls them and the</p>  
<p>establishers of prayers and of what we have provided them with they</p>  
<p>spend benevolently. O Allah! Make me one of those who in their prayers</p>  
<p>are humble, and who keep themselves aloof from what is vain, and</p>  
<p>those who act for purification, and those who guard their private parts</p>  
<p>except from their wives, or those whom their right hands possess for</p>  
<p>them. Reckon me amongst those who keep their trust, verily they are not</p>  
<p>blamable. O Allah! And make me one of those who keep well their trust,</p>  
<p>and honour their promises and those who take care of the regularity in</p>  
<p>their prayers. O Allah! Make me of those who are the heirs who inherit</p>  
<p>Paradise; they shall abide therein and those who are afraid of Your fear.</p>  
<p>O Allah! You have included me amongst those who believe in Your</p>  
<p>sings and of those who associate not anything with their Lord. O Allah!</p>  
<p>You therefore include me also amongst those who give in charity while</p>  
<p>their hearts thrilled for fear that to their Lord they must return. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Make me of those who hasten to good things and they are the foremost</p>  
<p>to attain them. O Allah! Include me in Your party, verily Your party, shall</p>  
<p>alone be successful. O Allah! Include me in Your army, verily Your army</p>  
<p>shall be the victorious one. O Allah! Provide me to quaff of pure drink</p>  
<p>which shall be sealed to others, the seal being of Musk. For that may</p>  
<p>aspire all those who wish to aspire for bliss. O Allah! Grant me a drink</p>  
<p>from Tasneem, a spring in Paradise, from which will drink those who</p>  
<p>enjoy nearness to You. O Allah! I am of the unjust ones, if You do not</p>  
<p>forgive me and be Merciful to me, surely I will be of the losers. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Grant me happiness after hardships and bestow on me an unending</p>  
<p>recompense. O our Lord! We have indeed heard the voice of an</p>  
<p>announcer calling us to faith saying: Believe you in Your Lord! And we</p>  
<p>did believe. O our Lord! Therefore forgive us then our sins and remove</p>  
<p>away from us our evil deeds, and cause us to die with the virtuous ones.</p>  
<p>O our Lord! Give us what You promised us through Your Messenger</p>  
<p>and disgrace us not on the day of resurrection. Verily You do not break</p>  
<p>Your promise. O Allah! Raise me to a higher rank and increase my</p>  
<p>lawful sustenance. O Allah! Make me of those who fulfill the covenant</p>  
<p>with You, and break not their pledge and of those who establish what</p>  
<p>Allah has bidden to be established, and they fear their Lord and dread</p>  
<p>the terrible reckoning. O Allah! Make me of those who are forbearing</p>  
<p>amidst trials seeking the pleasure of their Lord, and establish prayer and</p>  
<p>spend benevolently of what You have provided them with secretly and</p>  
<p>openly, and they turn away evil with good, for them is the happy</p>  
<p>attainment of the eternal abode. O our Lord! Grant us good in this world</p>  
<p>and good in the Hereafter and save us from the torment of he Hellfire.</p>
