<p>His supplication for the first day of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>All praise is for Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth and</p>  
<p>appointed the darkness and the light. Yet the idolaters ascribe partners</p>  
<p>to Him. It is He Who has created you from clay. Your span of life is fixed</p>  
<p>and the specified time is in His knowledge. Notwithstanding this, doubt</p>  
<p>persists in your minds. He is Allah in the Heavens and on Earth, knows</p>  
<p>whatever is manifest and hidden in you and is aware of your actions and</p>  
<p>deeds. All praise be to Him Who relieved us from oppressors. All praise</p>  
<p>be to Him Who elevated us over many of His believing servants. All</p>  
<p>praise is exclusively for Allah Who blessed me with Ismail and Ishaq in</p>  
<p>spite of my old age. Surely my Lord listens to prayers. O my Lord!</p>  
<p>Reckon me and my offspring among those who are steadfast in Your</p>  
<p>prayers, bless our prayers with acceptance and forgive my parents, the</p>  
<p>believers and me on the day of accounting. Praise be to Allah, the Lord</p>  
<p>of the Heavens and the Earth, and the Lord of the Worlds. He is Mighty</p>  
<p>and Wise. It is He Who deserves all praise, for whatever is in the</p>  
<p>Heavens and on Earth belongs to Him. In the world Hereafter, all praise</p>  
<p>is exclusively for Him. He is All-wise, the Knower (of everything). He</p>  
<p>knows whatever enters the Earth and whatever comes out (therefrom),</p>  
<p>whatever descends from the sky and whatever ascends towards it. He is</p>  
<p>Merciful and Forgiving. Praise be to Allah, the Originator of the Heavens</p>  
<p>and Earth. He appointed the Angels as messengers who possess two,</p>  
<p>three and four wings. He increases in the creation whatever He wishes.</p>  
<p>Verily, Allah is powerful over everything. There is none to stop His</p>  
<p>blessing made commonly available to mankind nor can anyone to grant</p>  
<p>that which He withholds. He is most High and All wise. O Mankind!</p>  
<p>Remember the Bounties, which He has bestowed on you. Is there any</p>  
<p>other God save Allah Who grants you sustenance from the Earth and</p>  
<p>sky? There is no God except Him. Why then do these people level</p>  
<p>(false) charges against Him? Praise be to Allah Who is the Lord of the</p>  
<p>Worlds. He is living. The one Who does not die. He is everlasting hence</p>  
<p>no diminution can occur to Him. He is the (eternal) Monarch; therefore</p>  
<p>downfall cannot be ascribed to Him. He is Just; hence no slackness can</p>  
<p>be attributed to Him. He is such a Sovereign Who never commits</p>  
<p>oppression. He is sublime, and nothing is hidden from Him. His bounties</p>  
<p>are limitless. He bestows on anyone whatever He chooses. He is the</p>  
<p>Forerunner Who has no predecessor. He is so Manifest that nothing is</p>  
<p>clearer than Him. He is such a Secret that nothing can equal Him in</p>  
<p>secrecy. His knowledge encompasses everything and He has reckoned</p>  
<p>everything with a clear reckoning. O my Lord! Bestow Your Blessings on</p>  
<p>Muhammad and his Progeny. Let my tongue praise You! Grant me</p>  
<p>success in my aims through prayers. Fulfill my desires and help in</p>  
<p>achieving my goals. Protect me and bless me through these prayers.</p>  
<p>Accomplish Your Bounties on me. Grant my prayers the Lord of the</p>  
<p>worlds. Purify my actions so that You may have pity on my helplessness</p>  
<p>and my complaints. I beseech You to show mercy on me. Be pleased</p>  
<p>with me and accept my prayer. Praise be to Allah Who has created the</p>  
<p>heavy clouds. The thunder and the Angels praise Him. It is He Who</p>  
<p>flashes the lighting that harms those whom He wishes. The truth is clear</p>  
<p>as daylight, yet the people believe not and argue about their God.</p>  
<p>Whosoever is proclaimed as God besides Him is false. He is the most</p>  
<p>High and the Great. Glory be to Allah Who raises up the souls when</p>  
<p>men are dead. He also raises up the souls of those alive when they go</p>  
<p>to sleep. Then He detains the souls of those whom He commands to die</p>  
<p>and releases the souls of the rest of them for the specified time. Surely</p>  
<p>there are His signs in it for those who may reflect. Glory be to Allah</p>  
<p>Whose Throne extends over the Heavens and the Earth, and the</p>  
<p>preservation of them both tires Him not. He is most exalted and Great.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Allah, the Knower of what is manifest and what is hidden,</p>  
<p>Beneficent and Merciful. There is no God beside Him. He is the King the</p>  
<p>most Holy the Bestower of conviction, the Guardian, the Supreme, the</p>  
<p>Great. He is above what is attributed to Him. He is the Creator, Maker</p>  
<p>and Fashioner. O Allah! Yours are the beautiful names. Everyone in the</p>  
<p>Heavens and on the Earth praises Him. He is Ever prevalent and All</p>  
<p>wise. All praise is for Him Who has neither any son nor any associate in</p>  
<p>His Realm. He has no helper against humiliation. And Glorify Him,</p>  
<p>magnifying His Praise.</p>
