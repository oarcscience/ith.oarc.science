<p>His Prayer for Eulogizing Allah and</p>  
<p>Expressing His greatness</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Praise is for Allah Who is the foremost of the Praised and the one Who</p>  
<p>deserved to be worshiped till the end. Who is nearer than all those who</p>  
<p>are present, Whose limit is unknown as He is eternal, Whose beginning</p>  
<p>has no limit, Who was before everyone without being needing to be</p>  
<p>everywhere but is not to be seen, Who is near to the secret gathering</p>  
<p>without being near. Being hidden is like apparency for Him. And the</p>  
<p>heart is lost in His greatness. Neither eyes can know His Heights nor the</p>  
<p>heart due to His imperceptibility deny His recognition. He is visible in the</p>  
<p>hearts but neither imagination nor feelings can ever imagine or fantasize</p>  
<p>Him. Then He guarded His greatness above any opposites, likes,</p>  
<p>shapes and example and made His Uniqueness as a miracle of Lord.</p>  
<p>And made the coming generation as proof of His Creation and Power,</p>  
<p>then He created (Human) from a drop, although there was nothing</p>  
<p>before it. This is a proof that after destruction He will again create as He</p>  
<p>had created the first time. Praise is for Allah, Lord of the Worlds Who</p>  
<p>does not lose due to disobedience of the proud ones and the</p>  
<p>worshippers do not benefit Him by their obedience. For the rebellious He</p>  
<p>is forbearing and He overlooks the one who ascribes a partner to Him.</p>  
<p>He is forever powerful without any limit. He will remain in His kingdom till</p>  
<p>the annihilation of His Creatures. He is Unique without a similarity and is</p>  
<p>independent. He doesn&#146;t have a spouse or children. He raised the skies</p>  
<p>without any support or pillars, moved the clouds without any binding. He</p>  
<p>is a caretaker of infinite creations but He is Allah the Unique Who</p>  
<p>neither begets nor is begotten and there is none like unto Him. And</p>  
<p>praise is for Allah from Whose bounties do not deprive even the</p>  
<p>disobedient ones. He encompasses even those who disobey Him and</p>  
<p>Whose smallest obligation can never be compensated by the greatest of</p>  
<p>the Worshippers. He is so needless that He is not stingy to sustain even</p>  
<p>those who deny His existence and sustaining the entire Universe does</p>  
<p>not decrease His bounties. Creator of the universe and the One to</p>  
<p>destroy it and the One to resurrect it again, manifest it and to</p>  
<p>recompense for their deeds. He is aware of every secret and everything</p>  
<p>concealed in the hearts and whatever is conveyed through tongues. He</p>  
<p>is aware of all the things which are destroyed by the earth. He is alive</p>  
<p>and has no death, such a Creator Who does not sleep and will continue</p>  
<p>to exist without being extinct. He is Just Who does not oppress. He</p>  
<p>forgives the Great sins by His Grace. If He chastises it is with justice.</p>  
<p>Neither does He destroys a thing fearing its discontinuance nor does He</p>  
<p>favours a thing due to its need. He has mentioned in His everlasting and</p>  
<p>firm book: "And were Allah to punish men for what they earn, He would</p>  
<p>not leave on the earth any creature.&#148; I wish to Praise Him in such a way</p>  
<p>that it becomes a request to Him for increasing the bounties. And I seek</p>  
<p>refuge from His wrath. And I verify His messenger, Mustafa (s.a.w.a.) so</p>  
<p>that I achieve nearness to him. That messenger whom He chose for</p>  
<p>revelation and for His Prophethood. That Prophet who is endowed with</p>  
<p>intercession and is responsible for his rights. Whose name is</p>  
<p>Muhammad, peace be on him, on his progeny and on his companions</p>  
<p>and on all the Prophets and the Messengers and all the Angles. May</p>  
<p>Allah protect them all. O my God! Hopes are destroyed, times have</p>  
<p>changed, the tongues have lied and promises are wrong. Only Your</p>  
<p>promise is a promise and You have said that You will forgive and Grace</p>  
<p>us. O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, give me from</p>  
<p>Your Grace, grant me refuge from the accursed Satan. You are pure,</p>  
<p>We praise You. How Great, Exalted and Honoured are You! Your</p>  
<p>forbearance also covers the arrogant. Your bounties have flooded the</p>  
<p>thanks of the thanks-giver. Your forbearance is more than what the</p>  
<p>evaluations value. Your obligations is above all those who praise You.</p>  
<p>Had Your grace not been there why then would Your mercy be on the</p>  
<p>people? Those whom You created with a drop when they were nothing,</p>  
<p>then You sustained them by Your pure sustenance and by Your</p>  
<p>continuous bounties You made them reach great heights. You made</p>  
<p>them owners of Your lands and You called them towards Your</p>  
<p>obedience, but they were ungrateful to Your bounties, they denied Your</p>  
<p>existence, they bowed down before others in Your kingdom (instead of</p>  
<p>You). What had happened if Your endurance had not given me an</p>  
<p>opportunity (to repent) although before it (opportunity) You had</p>  
<p>concealed it in the veils, honoured it with Your recognition, gave power</p>  
<p>to the tongue to offer thanks to You, show me the path for Your</p>  
<p>obedience. You made the way of Your graces easy for me. You placed</p>  
<p>the way of achieving nearness (to You) in front of me. But the</p>  
<p>compensation of all Your goodness from me was I recompensed evil for</p>  
<p>goodness due to which You were displeased. Infatuated by such things,</p>  
<p>Your great Chastisement which I deserve, I comprehend it to be less.</p>  
<p>Your pleasure which is miles away I am running on that Path, involved in</p>  
<p>my hopes, totally heedless to the warnings of death, completely</p>  
<p>unconcerned of Your destruction which I am undergoing. Although Your</p>  
<p>promise has already reached me that You expect (good) deeds from my</p>  
<p>strength throughout my life. Now the situation is such that after</p>  
<p>committing the greatest of sins I call upon You to increase Your</p>  
<p>bounties, which will not come to me (as I don't deserve it) whereas Your</p>  
<p>wrath is on me, but I am lazy due to Your excessive grace. Fully satisfied</p>  
<p>on Your abundant sustenance, control on Your bounties in spite of</p>  
<p>disobedience as if converting good deeds of the people into bad deeds.</p>  
<p>I am awaiting Your mercy impatiently. I am presenting my long hopes in</p>  
<p>Your presence as if I am satisfied with Your wrath. Surely we are from</p>  
<p>Allah and unto Him shall we return. (2:156). This is such a calamity,</p>  
<p>which is full of sorrow and is liable for a great chastisement. On the</p>  
<p>contrary I think that what would have happened if I had no hopes and if</p>  
<p>the promise of forgiving my sins were not there. I am confident of Your</p>  
<p>forgiveness although I have committed greater sins openly. I hid myself</p>  
<p>from all Your creatures little realizing about Your presence. My Lord!</p>  
<p>How shall I face You? And how shall I beseech You? After accepting the</p>  
<p>covenant I have done breach of trust. I have made You my sponsor and</p>  
<p>security but still showed excessiveness in doing sins. In spite of all this</p>  
<p>You called me. I was dependent on You still I did not answer You. Oh</p>  
<p>what a calamity and how a shameful display of immoral behaviour. Alas!</p>  
<p>What courage that I have deceived myself. But You are Pure and Great.</p>  
<p>Now I wish to come near You. And I give You the oath of Your right that I</p>  
<p>have come to take refuge from Your wrath. Due to my own disobedience</p>  
<p>I have become liable for Your chastisement. You have not done injustice</p>  
<p>on me due to my ignorance I was deceived not because of Your</p>  
<p>tolerance. I have lost my right. Your right is intact, I have oppressed</p>  
<p>myself. Now my hopes are on You. My confidence is on You, my faith is</p>  
<p>on You and in Your presence I humbly submit my repentance and</p>  
<p>helplessness. Thus have mercy on my condition. With complete</p>  
<p>movement in my faith, and head bowed in shame I present myself. I am</p>  
<p>troubled at the grief of my sins. Surely You are the Most Merciful of all</p>  
<p>the Mercifuls. O the most attentive listener among those who are called.</p>  
<p>O the best of the place of wish. O the best of the forgiver among all the</p>  
<p>other forgivers. O the One to be near to the one who complains. I am</p>  
<p>calling upon You. I complain to You and this complain is of the one who</p>  
<p>has complained to the world and has lost all hopes. Now have Grace</p>  
<p>and Mercy on my weakness. By Your vast Mercy forgive my great sins</p>  
<p>and give me the strength to ponder over my inner self. Surely You are</p>  
<p>the Great bestower among all those who bestow. There is no lord other</p>  
<p>than You. You are Pure and Great and I am unjust and disobedient. O</p>  
<p>Allah! O Unique! O Allah! O self-sufficient. O the One Who is neither</p>  
<p>created by anyone nor begets anyone, nor has an equal. O Lord! The</p>  
<p>ways have tired me. The distant people have pushed me, friends have</p>  
<p>frightened me, and when no hope is left You are the ultimate hope.</p>  
<p>When calamities overpower us You are the only supporter. In difficulties</p>  
<p>and ease You are the only way to salvation. Thus avert the sorrow from</p>  
<p>the one whose hopelessness, when ponders on the sins, loses hope of</p>  
<p>salvation. O Lord! By Your mercy don't make him disappointed, as You</p>  
<p>are the Most Merciful of all the Mercifuls.</p>
