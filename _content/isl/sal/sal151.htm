<p>His supplication for the twenty-seventh of</p>  
<p>the month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! I seek Mercy from You for the guidance of my heart, for</p>  
<p>converging my affairs and setting them in order, for improving me in my</p>  
<p>religion, from protection during my absence from home, and for</p>  
<p>prosperity when at home, increase in my wealth, for longevity in life,</p>  
<p>ease in my affairs, for concealing my short comings and for seething</p>  
<p>right the disordered affairs of my life, for repulsion of all that I dislike, for</p>  
<p>making my face lustrous and for protecting us me against all evils for the</p>  
<p>rest of my life. O Allah! You are the Foremost with none to precede You,</p>  
<p>You are the last none to be after You. You are Manifest, there is none</p>  
<p>comparable to You, being Manifest You are Hidden and being Hidden</p>  
<p>You are Manifest. You are Hidden due to Your subtlety for Your</p>  
<p>manifest creation observing You from the different directions of the earth</p>  
<p>being far off, despite Your closeness You are far. There is no god save</p>  
<p>You. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and improve me in</p>  
<p>my faith which gives me immunity from sins, and improve me in my world</p>  
<p>in which is my livelihood, and improve my Hereafter to which is my</p>  
<p>return, and grant me a life with virtuous deeds, and grant me happiness</p>  
<p>in exchange of every evil at the time of death. O Allah! All praise be for</p>  
<p>You before the commencement of every performance and all praise be</p>  
<p>for You after the completion of every performance. O the Succourer! To</p>  
<p>those who seek help. O the Alleviator of sufferings! O the Answerer of</p>  
<p>the call of the distressed! O the Dispeller of the severe agony! O the</p>  
<p>Most Merciful! Dispel my uneasiness and sadness for none can dispel it</p>  
<p>save You as You know my condition, and the sincerity of my intention</p>  
<p>with which I pin my hopes to achieve Your goodness and benevolence.</p>  
<p>Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and fulfill my wants, O the</p>  
<p>Most Merciful! O Allah! All praise be for You and for You is all authority</p>  
<p>and for You is all might and pride, and for You is all greatness and in</p>  
<p>Your hands is all good. To You is the return of all affairs manifest or</p>  
<p>secret. O Allah! There is none to guide whom You let go astray and</p>  
<p>none can misguide him whom You guide. None can stop that which You</p>  
<p>bestow and none can bestow that which You withhold. None can put at</p>  
<p>the end whom You put ahead and none can put ahead whom You put at</p>  
<p>the end. None can open that You close and none can close that You</p>  
<p>open. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and bestow on me</p>  
<p>liberally from Your blessings, favours, mercy and sustenance. O Allah! I</p>  
<p>Request You for wealth during poverty and peace during fear and also</p>  
<p>permanent bounties which should neither wane nor change. O Allah!</p>  
<p>The Lord of seven Heavens and the Lord of seven Earths and what is in</p>  
<p>them and in between them, our Lord and Lord of everything, the</p>  
<p>Revealer of Torah, Injeel, Zaboor and the Great Quran, the splitter of</p>  
<p>the grain and date stone, I seek protection against the evil of every</p>  
<p>wicked and from the harm of the living creature whom You hold under</p>  
<p>Your control by its forelock; Verily my Lord is on the right Path, never</p>  
<p>unjust to anyone, and he is over everything Powerful and encompasses</p>  
<p>everything. O Allah! You are the Foremost with none to precede You.</p>  
<p>You are the last none to be after You. You are Manifest with none above</p>  
<p>You. You are Hidden. Nothing is comparable to You. Bless Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny. In the name of Allah. I believe in Allah, with</p>  
<p>Allah I seek refuge, and I under His shelter protect myself from evil.</p>  
<p>Through the Might and Power of Allah I become inaccessible to Satan</p>  
<p>and others like him, their deceits, their armies, their traps and to</p>  
<p>everyone of his companion. I seek refuge with the perfect and blessed</p>  
<p>words of Allah, neither the virtuous nor the vicious can escape the</p>  
<p>influence therefrom, and with all the beautiful exalted names of Allah</p>  
<p>known to me or not, I seek protection against the evils He created, and</p>  
<p>from the vicissitude of fortune, except the mishap behind which is hidden</p>  
<p>good luck and happiness from You. O Allah! I seek refuge with You</p>  
<p>against evil emanating from myself, against the evil gaze of every</p>  
<p>observer, against the evil of every hearing ear, against the evil of every</p>  
<p>speaking tongue, against the evil of every attacking hand, against the</p>  
<p>evil of every moving stem and against the evils of days and night I am</p>  
<p>afraid of. O Allah! Whoso endeavours to manipulate against me through</p>  
<p>revolt, oppression, viciousness and evil manners whether he be a Jinn</p>  
<p>or a man, from close vicinity or from a distance, small or big, kindly</p>  
<p>squeeze his chest, hold his hand, paralyse his legs destroy his tricks</p>  
<p>and manipulation, kill him, destroy his rage, set him against his own self</p>  
<p>intervene between him and me, and support me with Your Power and</p>  
<p>Might. Verily You are Powerful over everything.</p>
