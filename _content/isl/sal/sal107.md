\(106\)

His supplication for memorizing the Quran

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah bestow upon me Your mercy so that I am away from Your

disobedience and bestow the grace that I am not involved in unbearable

difficulties, and grant me the goodness for deeds which make You

happy with me, and make the memorizing of Your book (the Holy Quran)

obligatory on me as You have granted me it's knowledge, and bestow

Your grace so that I recite it in the way Your pleasure is gained. O
Allah

illuminate my eyes, expand my breast, illuminate my heart and my

tongue flows with the Holy Quran. Give me the strength so that I use my

body for the Holy Quran, grant me Your help because there is no helper

other than You and there is no god other that You.
