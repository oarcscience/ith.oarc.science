<p>His Dua for expressing helplessness before</p>  
<p>Allah and seeking forgiveness</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! From many things I ask You few things although I have great</p>  
<p>desires from You and You are free from it and those wants are difficult</p>  
<p>for me and easy for You. My Lord forgive my sins and overlook my</p>  
<p>shortcomings and my great sins which are committed intentionally and</p>  
<p>unintentionally. My greed, which is the result of my seeking those things,</p>  
<p>which I am not worthy of but You by Your Grace and Mercy bestowed on</p>  
<p>me. Which I saw by Your Powers and has reached me as an acceptance</p>  
<p>of my prayers. Now I call You fearlessly and I ask You being intimate</p>  
<p>with You, neither there is fear nor terror and I have presented myself in</p>  
<p>Your presence. I am proud of You. Now if You delay in accepting my</p>  
<p>prayers it is not due to Your ignorance although there was some</p>  
<p>goodness for me in that delay as You are aware of every result.</p>  
<p>Sufficient is for me that I have not found a more reliable lord than You.</p>  
<p>My Lord You call me and I turn my face away from You. You express</p>  
<p>Your love for me and I don't respond likewise to You. You expect</p>  
<p>sincerity from me whereas I don't think of it. It seems that I have obliged</p>  
<p>You, but still You are being generous and merciful towards me and</p>  
<p>never slow in bestowing favours on me. Then have mercy on my errors,</p>  
<p>bestow mercy on (here take your name with your fathers name e.g. Ali</p>  
<p>son of Abu Talib) because You are generous and noble.</p>
