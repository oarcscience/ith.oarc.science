His supplication for the ninth of the month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! All praise be to You for every good that You have bestowed on

us and for every evil that You have warded off from us. Praise be to You

for everything that You have created, originated, made and evolved. All

praise be to You for taking our test, for every poverty, for every
wealth,

and for everything given to or taken back from us, for causing death and

giving life, authority of all these therefore rests with You. Hallowed
are

You and most High, Who so takes You as his master is not disgraced

and he whom You hate cannot be respected. You are the Origin and to

You is the return. Decisions are Yours, there is none above You to

decide. You are self-sufficient and the people are dependent on You. O

Allah! Here am I ready to worship You. Praise be to You equal to the

amount of praise You own and equal to the amount of praise You made

others to own. You are the owner of the earth and the things that are

thereon. To You is the return of all. Those eulogising You fall short of

praising You in the manner You have praised Yourself. O Allah! Praise

be to You for You are the Master of praise, You are the end of praise

and You really deserve the praise. Praise be to You such that is
befitting

none except You. Praise be to You in the night when the darkness

spreads and praise be to You during the day when it becomes bright,

praise be to You in this world and in the Hereafter. Praise be to You in

the high heaven and in the earth below; all things are perishable but

Your countenance. O Allah! Praise be to You in weal and woe. Praise

be to You in ease and in difficulty. Praise be to You at times of

calamities and during happiness. Praise be to You in the hours of

hardships and on receiving Your favours. O Allah! Praise be to You in

the manner You have praised Yourself in Surah-e-Fateha, in the Torah,

in the Evangel and in the Holy Quran. Praise be to You such that its

beginning, its end and its objective be limitless. O Allah! Praise be to

You for favouring us with Islam. Praise be to You for bestowing the Holy

Quran. Praise be to You on wealth and children and praise be to You in

enabling me to offer thanks to You for Your favours and bounties. Praise

be to You for praise began with You and it will end at You. You have no

associate. O Allah! Praise be to You for You overlook the sins despite

having knowledge and forgive despite having power to punish. Praise

be to You on bounties and favours on us. Praise be for You on Your

Benevolence shown to us. Praise be to You for Your bounties which

none can count except You and for Your bounties which are open and

cannot be concealed. Praise be to You as often as there are Your

countless favours. Praise be to You equal to the number of things the

account of which You know, the number of things that Your knowledge

embrace, the things that have imbued with light and things that You

have confined in the Book. O Allah! Praise be to You as You are worthy

of it. There is no god except You. Neither the darkness of the light,
nor

the Zodiac sky, nor the earth with its undulations nor the seas with

waves, nor the high peaked mountains, nor the layers under layers of

darkness can conceal You. Praise be to You for I am that humble

servant whom You have reared. Praise be to You for I am that beggar

whom You have elevated. Praise be to You for I am that valueless whom

You have honoured. Praise be to You for I am that mean whom You

have dignified. Praise be to You for I am the seeker whom You have

bestowed. Praise be to You for I am Your devotee whom You have

pleased. Praise be to You for I am the poverty-stricken whom You have

enriched. Praise be to You for I am that misled whom You have guided

and praise be to You for I am that ignorant whom You have taught.

Praise be to You for I am obscure and You granted me reputation.

Praise be to You for I am that wrongdoer whom You have pardoned.

Praise be to You for I am that sinner whom You have shown mercy.

Praise be to You for I am that lonely traveller to whom You gave

company. Praise be to You for I am that who was far away and

conveyed me to my destination. Praise be to You for I am that whom

You protected. Praise be to You for I am that sick whom You cured.

Praise be to You for I am that diseased whom You made healthy. Praise

be to You for I am that hungry whom You fed, that unclothed whom You

covered, that driven out whom You sheltered, that lonely whom You

assisted, that forsaken whom You helped, that aggrieved whom You

relieved and that sorrow stricken whom You consoled. O my Allah!

Praise be to You is plenty in the manner of Your numerous bounties. O

Allah! These are the bounties which You particularised for me amongst

all mankind. You have made the universe subservient to human beings,

removed their difficulties and bestowed Your bounties. Praise be to You

the Lord of the Worlds. O Allah! All that You have bestowed on me was

not in return for any of my good deed nor because I was entitled to
them.

You did not remove the worldly sorrows, sorrows and pains and spared

me from various calamities and disasters because I deserved it, but You

did so that Your kindness and Your proof should be established on me.

O the Most merciful! Praise be to You that You have bestowed

countless bounties and have warded off immeasurable calamities.
