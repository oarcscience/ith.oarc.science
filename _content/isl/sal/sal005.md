His (a.s.) supplication praising Allah (a.j.)

as taught to Janab-e-Owais-e-Qarni

Dua-e-Owais-e-Qarni

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O True Safety! O believer! O True Protector! O possessor of Honour

and great Heights! Pure and Purifying! Overpowering and powerful!

Possessor of Power. O the one Who is called in different languages,

dialects and words at the time of various needs. O the one Whose one

condition does not fear the other condition. You are the One that times

cannot change, space cannot contain You. Neither sleep nor laziness

overtakes You. Ease for me my affair whose possibility I fear. Ease for

me all those things, which trouble me. You are Pure, there is no lord

other than You. I confess I have done wrong, committed misdeeds

committed injustice on my soul. Thus forgive me, as there is no one

other than You who can forgive. And praise is for Allah lord of the

Worlds and there is no power and strength, but with Allah and peace of

Allah be upon Muhammad, His Messenger (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny

(a.s.) and salutations be upon them.
