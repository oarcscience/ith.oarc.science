Dua-e-Sabah

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Oh God, Oh He Who extended the morning's tongue in the speech of its

dawning, dispatched the fragments of the dark night into the gloom of
its

stammering, made firm the structure of the turning spheres in the

measures of its display and beamed forth the brightness of the sun

through the light of its blazing! Oh He, Who demonstrates His Essence

by His Essence, transcends congeniality with His creatures and is

exalted beyond conformity with His qualities! Oh He Who is near to the

passing thoughts of opinions, far from the regards of eyes and knows

what will be before it comes to be! Oh He, Who has put me at ease in

the cradle of His security and sanctuary, awakened me to the favors and

kindness that He has bestowed upon me and hell from the claws of evil

with His hand and His force! Bless, oh God, the guide to You in the

darkest night, him who, of Your ropes, clings to the cord of the longest

nobility, him whose glory is evident at the summit of stout shoulders
and

whose feet were entrenched in spite of slippery places in ancient time;

and \[bless\] his household, the good, the chosen, the pious, And open
for

us, oh God, the leaves of morning's door with the keys of mercy and

prosperity! Clothe me, oh God, with the most excellent robes of

guidance and r ighteousness! Plant, oh God, through Your

tremendousness, the springs of humility in the watering place of my

hear! Cause to flow, oh God, because of Your awesomeness, tears of

moaning from the corner of my eyes! And chastise, oh God, the

recklessness of my clumsiness with the reins of contentment! My God, if

mercy from You does not begin with fair success for me, then who can

take me to You upon the evident path? If Your deliberateness would turn

me over to the guide of hope and wishes, then who will annul my slips

from the stumbles of caprice? If Your deliberateness should turn me over

to the guide of hope and wishes, then who will annul my slips from the

stumbles of caprice? If Your help should forsake me in the battle with
the

soul and Satan, then Your forsaking will have entrusted me to where

there is hardship and deprivation. My God, does You see that I have

only come to You from the direction of hopes or clung to the ends of

Your cords when my sins have driven me from the house of union? So

what an evil mount upon which my soul has mounted - its caprice! Woe

upon it for being seduced by its own opinions and wishes! And

destruction be upon it for its audacity toward its Master and Protector!

My God, I have knocked upon the door of Your mercy with the hand of

my hope, fled to You seeking refuge from my excessive caprice and

fixed the fingers of my love to the ends of Your cords. So pardon, oh

God, the slips and errors I have committed and release me from the foot

tangling of my robe. For You are my Master, my Protector, my Support

and my Hope and You are the object of my search and my desire in my

ultimate end and stable abode. My God, how couldst You drive away a

poor beggar who seeks refuge in You from sins, fleeing? Or how could

You disappoint one seeking guidance who repairs to Your threshold

running? Never! For Your pools are full in the hardship of drought, Your

door is open for seeking and penetration and You are the goal of

requests and the object of hopes. My God, these are the reins of my

soul I have bound them with the ties of Your will. These are the burdens

of my sins I have averted them with Your pardon and mercy. And these

are my caprices that lead astray - I have entrusted them to the
threshold

of Your gentleness and kindliness. So make this morning of mine, oh

God, descend upon me with the radiance of guidance, and with safety in

religion and this world! And \[make\] my evening a shield against the

deception of enemies and a protection against the destructive blows of

caprice! Verily You are able over what You will! You gives the kingdom

to whom You will, and You seizes the kingdom from whom You will; You

exalts whom You will, and You abases whom You will; in Your hand is

the good; You are powerful over all things. You make the night to enter

into the day, and You make the day to enter into the night; You bring

forth the living from the dead, and You bring forth dead from the
living;

and You provides whomsoever You will without reckoning. There is no

god but You! Glory be to You, oh God, and Your is the praise! Who

knows Your measure without fearing You? Who knows what You are

without awe of You? Through Your power You have joined disparate

things, through Your gentleness You have cleaved apart the daybreak

and through Your generosity You have illumined the dark shrouds of

night. You have made waters, sweet and salt, flow forth from hard

shining stones, sent down out of rain-clouds water cascading and

appointed the sun and moon a blazing lamp for the creatures, without

experiencing in that which You originated either weariness or effort.
So,

oh He Who is alone in might and subsistence and dominates His slaves

with death and annihilation, Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his

household, the god fearing, answer my supplication hear my call,

destroy my enemies and actualize through Your bounty my hope and

desire. Oh best of those who is called to remove affliction and object
of

hope in every difficulty and ease! I have stated my need, so do not
reject

me, oh my master, despairing of Your exalted gifts. Oh All generous! Oh

All generous! Oh All generous! By Your mercy, oh Most Merciful of the

merciful! And God bless the best of His creatures, Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.), and all his household!

Then go in prostration and say:

My God, my heart is veiled, my soul deficient, my intelligence defeated,

my caprice triumphant, my obedience little, my disobedience much and

my tongue acknowledges sins. So what am I to do? Oh He Who covers

defects! Oh He Who knows the unseen things! Forgive my sins, all of

them, by the sacredness of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the household of

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) Oh All-forgiver! Oh All-forgiver! Oh All-forgiver!
By

Your mercy, oh Most Merciful of the merciful!
