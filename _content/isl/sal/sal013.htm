<p>His Dua mentioning the Holy Prophet</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.)</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>All Praise our for Allah, Lord of the worlds and peace be on the Pure</p>  
<p>Messenger, Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) son of Abdullah son of Abdul Muttalib,</p>  
<p>owner of greatness, the chosen one. O Lord give Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
<p>praiseworthy mentions and a pond (Kauthar), which is visible and seen.</p>  
<p>O Lord bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny appoint him as an</p>  
<p>intermediary and raise his status, and make his love common among</p>  
<p>Your appointed people and raise his status High and grant him miracle</p>  
<p>among Your trusted and close people. O Allah grant Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) all the types of miracles which are distinguished among them</p>  
<p>and that bounty which is the greatest of all, and of all the givings is the</p>  
<p>greatest of givings and among all the eases it is that ease which lasts</p>  
<p>the longest. And of all the distribution it is the largest share, so that</p>  
<p>among Your Creations no one is more nearer to You than him, and no</p>  
<p>one is higher in status than him. Nor any right greater than him, and no</p>  
<p>one is more nearer than Muhammad peace and blessings be on him and</p>  
<p>his progeny. Who is a caller towards goodness who is a blessing for all</p>  
<p>the creatures of Allah and is a mercy for entire creation of Allah. O Allah</p>  
<p>gather us together with Muhammad peace and blessings be on him and</p>  
<p>his progeny in this life continued satisfaction on bounties, desires of the</p>  
<p>soul hopes and wishes, pleasures of the bounties, witnessing the</p>  
<p>satisfaction, the chief of the miracles, wetness of the eyes, freshness</p>  
<p>and perfection of the bounties, and that pleasure which has no equal in</p>  
<p>the universe. Gather us in those ranks with Muhammad and his progeny</p>  
<p>(peace be upon them all). I witness that he (The prophet propagated</p>  
<p>Your message with sincerity, endeavoured for the people, bore</p>  
<p>hardships in Your way, struggled in Your way, worshipped You to the</p>  
<p>extent of certainty, so send blessings on the Prophet and his progeny. O</p>  
<p>the Lord of the sanctified land, O the Lord of the Rukn and Yaman (two</p>  
<p>corners of Kaaba), O Lord of the great mosque. O Lord of the sanctuary</p>  
<p>of Mecca, make our salutations reach Muhammad (peace be on him and</p>  
<p>his progeny). O Allah send blessings on all the Divine and honoured</p>  
<p>angels, messengers, Prophets and on the angels who record our</p>  
<p>actions. And send Your bounties and blessings on Your obedient</p>  
<p>servants in seven Heavens and seven earths from all the believers.</p>
