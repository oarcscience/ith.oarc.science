<p>His Dua expressing sincere attention</p>  
<p>towards Allah</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! You love most those who have love for Your Apostles. You are</p>  
<p>more sufficient for one who believes in You. You know their secret what</p>  
<p>is in their hearts and You know the hidden secrets of their behaviour.</p>  
<p>This knowledge is of their disconcertments, that is why their secrets are</p>  
<p>disclosed for You and their hearts are full of sorrow. When they are</p>  
<p>horrified of travels they remember You and if they are in disaster, they</p>  
<p>beseech for help because they know all matters are in Your control and</p>  
<p>the way of escape depends on Your will. O Allah! If I fail to ask about my</p>  
<p>desire show me the correct way and keep my mind towards it because it</p>  
<p>is not improbable from Your guidance not surprising of Your leadership.</p>  
<p>O my Lord! Make me ready for Your pardon and not for justice (It is</p>  
<p>difficult to escape without forgiveness) O Allah! You have revealed Your</p>  
<p>Holy book on Your Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and said: (1) They slept very little</p>  
<p>in the night and prayed for Your forgiveness in the morning. So I also</p>  
<p>ask You for forgiveness and I turn towards You. (2) You are great and</p>  
<p>Superior and have said: Follow the people from where they go and pray</p>  
<p>for pardon from Allah. Indeed Allah is forgiving and merciful. And I ask for</p>  
<p>pardon and repent (3) You are Great and Superior and have said: O</p>  
<p>Prophet! Forgive them and accept their repentance and make them</p>  
<p>aware of it and when you intend to do, have faith on Allah because Allah</p>  
<p>likes the faithful. I also ask for ablution and repent. (4) Allah You are the</p>  
<p>great and superior You have said those who showed high handedness,</p>  
<p>would come to you and ask for absolution from You and Your Prophet</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.), they would have found that Allah is merciful and Forgiving. I</p>  
<p>also ask for forgiveness and repent (5) Allah You are the great and have</p>  
<p>said: One who commits bad deeds and is unjust and then pray for</p>  
<p>forgiveness, Allah forgives him. He is Merciful. Now I repent and ask for</p>  
<p>forgiveness. (6) Allah, You are Great and Superior and have said: Why</p>  
<p>don't they repent and why don't they pray for pardon? Allah is Forgiving</p>  
<p>and Merciful. And I pray for Pardon and repent. (7) Allah, You are Great</p>  
<p>and have said: Allah will not chastise them as long as the Apostle is with</p>  
<p>them. Allah will not curse them until they beg pardon of Allah. And now I</p>  
<p>beg pardon of Him and repent (8) Allah You are Great and Superior and</p>  
<p>You have said: O my Apostle! You ask pardon for them or do not ask for</p>  
<p>the pardon for them. If you will pray seventy times Allah will not accept. I</p>  
<p>beg for Your pardon and repent. (9) Allah, You are Great and Superior</p>  
<p>and have said: The Prophet and his believers have no right to pray for</p>  
<p>forgiveness for polytheists, not even if they related to them. They are</p>  
<p>considered the inmates of Hell. And I seek for forgiveness and repent</p>  
<p>(10) And You are the great and Superior and have said: Ibrahim&#146;s (a.s.)</p>  
<p>prayer for forgiveness was only for Azar for his given promise and</p>  
<p>because of the given promise he asked forgiveness from Allah. And I</p>  
<p>seek pardon from You and repent. (11) Allah, You are the Great and</p>  
<p>Superior and have said: You all seek forgiveness of Allah and repent.</p>  
<p>He will bestow You the benefits from His excellent treasures. He will</p>  
<p>bestow the robe of honour to all. I seek for forgiveness and repent.</p>  
<p>Allah, You are the Great and have said: Seek forgiveness from Allah and</p>  
<p>then repent. Allah will send rain from the sky and increase your strength</p>  
<p>and do not be disobedient like the culprits. And I seek pardon from You</p>  
<p>and repent. (12) Allah, You are the Great and Superior and said: Allah</p>  
<p>has created you from dust and settled you on it. So ask forgiveness from</p>  
<p>Allah and repent. No doubt He is very near to you and accepts your</p>  
<p>prayer. And I seek forgiveness and repent. You have said: You are the</p>  
<p>Great and ask for forgiveness and then repent. Indeed, My Lord is</p>  
<p>merciful and a Great lover. And I beseech forgiveness and repent. (13)</p>  
<p>And You have said: You are the Master of Honour and excellent. And</p>  
<p>asked the woman to ask forgiveness for your sin because certainly you</p>  
<p>are a sinner. And I beseech pardon for my sin and repent. (14) And You</p>  
<p>have said You are honorable and Superior. O my honourable parents,</p>  
<p>beseech pardon from Allah for our sins. As we are sinners and we</p>  
<p>beseech for pardon and repent (15) And You have said You are the</p>  
<p>Great and Honourable. We shall beseech pardon from Allah for you</p>  
<p>because He is the Forgiving and Merciful. And I beseech pardon and</p>  
<p>repent (16) And You have said: You are the Master of blessings and the</p>  
<p>High. Who has prevented the people to believe in God after guidance</p>  
<p>and seek forgiveness from God? And I beseech Pardon from You and</p>  
<p>repent. (17) And You have said: You are the Great and Superior</p>  
<p>(Ibrahim (a.s.)) Peace be with you. I shall beseech pardon for you very</p>  
<p>soon as Allah is very kind with me. And I beseech pardon and repent.</p>  
<p>(18) And You have said: You are the Great and Excellent. Allow anyone</p>  
<p>if you like and beseech pardon for him. Without doubt Allah is the</p>  
<p>Concealer of Faults and I beg pardon from You. (19) And You have said</p>  
<p>You are the Great and Honourable. O people why do you haste to turn</p>  
<p>towards the evil before good, and why don't you ask for Allah's</p>  
<p>blessings? Certainly He would show kindness to you. (20) I beseech</p>  
<p>forgiveness from You and repent. And You have said: You are Great</p>  
<p>and magnificent. And Dawood (a.s.) knew that I was taking a trial so he</p>  
<p>beseeched for pardon and bowed down and fell and repented. I</p>  
<p>beseech for repentance. (21) And You have said: You are the Great and</p>  
<p>Superior. Those Angels who raise the empyrean and repeated</p>  
<p>invocation of Allah's name around His empyrean with faith and beseech</p>  
<p>pardon for the pious. And I beseech pardon and repent. (22) And You</p>  
<p>have said: You are the Great and magnificent. Have patience as Allah's</p>  
<p>promise is true and beg for pardon of Your sins and invoke Allah's name</p>  
<p>day and night. I beg pardon from You and repent. (23) And You have</p>  
<p>said: You are Great and Magnificent: Believe in God and be firm and</p>  
<p>beseech for pardon. I beseech pardon and repent (24) And You have</p>  
<p>said: You are the Great and Magnificent. And the Angels praise God and</p>  
<p>beseech blessings for the worldly people and yes, Certainly Allah is</p>  
<p>Merciful and Forgiving. And I beg for blessings and repent. And You</p>  
<p>have said - You are the Great and Magnificent. Remember! Certainly He</p>  
<p>is Allah and there is no other God except Him. And beg from Allah to</p>  
<p>forgive your sins and for all other pious persons. Allah knows all your</p>  
<p>activities. I beg for blessings and repent. (25) And You have said - You</p>  
<p>are the Great and Superior. Very soon Bedouins will say: O Messenger</p>  
<p>of Allah (s.a.w.a.) our children and wealth kept us busy. So pray Allah to</p>  
<p>forgive us. I beseech for blessings and repent. (26) And You have said -</p>  
<p>You are the Great and Magnificent. Till you believe in Allah the One.</p>  
<p>Except that Ibrahim (a.s.) had promised his father (Uncle Azar (a.s.)) that</p>  
<p>he will pray for him but I do not have authority from Allah about you. O</p>  
<p>My Lord! We believe in You and require attention from You and we shall</p>  
<p>return to You. And I beseech forgiveness and repent. (27) And You have</p>  
<p>said You are Great And Magnificent: And when they are informed the</p>  
<p>Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) will beseech absolution for You, they</p>  
<p>bowed down their heads. And You will see those people who disobey</p>  
<p>Your orders because they are proud. And I beseech forgiveness and</p>  
<p>repent (28) And You have said - You are the Great and superior. You</p>  
<p>are alike for them. As you wished forgiveness for them but do not pray</p>  
<p>for forgiveness for them. Allah will never forgive them. I beseech</p>  
<p>forgiveness from You and repent. (29) And You have said - You are the</p>  
<p>Great and Superior: And beseech for forgiveness from your Lord. He is</p>  
<p>Forgiving. I repent and beseech for forgiveness. And You have said -</p>  
<p>You are Honourable and Respectable. He is worthy competent. And</p>  
<p>beseech forgiveness. Indeed He is the Concealer of Faults. I beseech</p>  
<p>for forgiveness and repent. And You have said - You are the Great and</p>  
<p>Superior. Be devoted to God and ask for forgiveness because He is an</p>  
<p>accepter of repentance. And I beseech forgiveness and repent in Your</p>  
<p>court.</p>
