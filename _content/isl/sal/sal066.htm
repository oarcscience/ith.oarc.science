<p>(65)</p>  
<p>His supplication for seeking desires to be</p>  
<p>written by the right hand when you</p>  
<p>approach someone for some work</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah I ask You O Allah the One, Unique, O the light, O the</p>  
<p>self-subsisting, O the one Whose power has filled the heavens and the</p>  
<p>earth. I request You that for me overcome the heart of so and so (here</p>  
<p>take the name) as You had overcome the snakes for Moosa (a.s.), as for</p>  
<p>Prophet Sulaiman You had overpowered his army which consisted of</p>  
<p>Jinns and men and animals all were obedient to him. And I wish that You</p>  
<p>soften his heart towards me just as You softened iron for Dawood (a.s.).</p>  
<p>And I ask You to make his heart low towards me as You have made</p>  
<p>moon in front of sunlight. O Allah he is Your slave and son of Your slave</p>  
<p>girl, You have kept his legs and his forehead in Your control. You by his</p>  
<p>hands and his legs can make my desires and wishes fulfilled without</p>  
<p>doubt. You possess power over all things and He is also in that kingdom</p>  
<p>in which there is no god except You the ever living the self-subsisting.</p>
