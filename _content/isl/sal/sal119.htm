<p>His Supplication as taught to Imam Hasan</p>  
<p>(a.s.)</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O my weapon during my troubles, O my Listener in my trials, O my</p>  
<p>Helper in my bounties, O the One to make me successful at the time of</p>  
<p>my need, O the one to give me salvation at the time of my destruction, O</p>  
<p>the one to keep a watch over me in solitude, forgive my sins, and ease</p>  
<p>for me my affairs. Grant me peace at the time of troubles, grant me</p>  
<p>success in supplications, reformation in my condition and protection in</p>  
<p>all the things which worry me. Rectify my affairs. Never take away</p>  
<p>protection from me, whether I am alive or dead and also in the hereafter.</p>  
<p>By Your Mercy, O most Merciful of all the Mercifuls.</p>
