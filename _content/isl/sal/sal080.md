\(79\)

His supplication when he extorted people

for the war of Siffin and when people did

not respond, he supplicated as under:

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! From among Your slaves make You a witness against the

person who does not pay any heed to our admonitions and who acts

lazily to help for Your cause. O The greatest of all the witnesses and
it is

such a witness that I call upon the entire creation to witness whom You

have settled on the earth and the Heavens. The witness that You are

not in need of their help and due to their sins they will be dealt with

severely.

battlefield](sal081)
