<p>Another of his supplication on sighting the</p>  
<p>Moon</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O the one who is continuously obedient, the one that comes and goes</p>  
<p>on the places fixed by destiny and on the heavens of determination. I</p>  
<p>have brought faith in Him, the One Who turned darkness into light</p>  
<p>through you and illuminated darkness, appointed you as a sign of His</p>  
<p>power, tested you by growing, lessening, rising, setting, shining and by</p>  
<p>eclipse. In all these you were obedient to Allah and strictly followed the</p>  
<p>commands. How pure is Allah, how much amazing laws He has passed</p>  
<p>for you. How the wise creation was created by Him and appointed you</p>  
<p>as a moon for every new month. May Allah appoint you among the safe,</p>  
<p>and faithful and peaceful moons. That moon from which there is safety</p>  
<p>from deviation and protection from evils. O Allah! Make me the most</p>  
<p>guided one among all those upon whom it shone. Make it the most pious</p>  
<p>for all those who see, and blessings of Allah be on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
<p>and his progeny (ask for your wishes and then say) O the most merciful</p>
