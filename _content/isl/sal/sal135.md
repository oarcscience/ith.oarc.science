His supplication for the eleventh of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Glory be to Him Who carried His servant by night from the sacred

mosque of Kaaba to the farthest Mosque the surroundings of which He

has blessed in order to show him some of His signs. Verily He is

All-hearing, the All-seeing. Glory be to Him and Exalted is He far above

from what they say. Celebrate His glory, the seven Heavens and the

Earth and all those in them and there is not anything but it glorifies
Him

but you understand not their glorification. Verily He is the Forbearing,

the Oft-forgiving. Glory be to Him, when a matter is decreed He only

says unto it "Be" and it is. So be you patient with what they say and

glorify your Lord by praising Him ere the rising of the sun and ere the

setting of it. And in some hours of the night do glorify Him and during

parts of the day that you may achieve pleasure of your Lord. Hallowed is

your Lord, the Lord and Majesty far above from that which they ascribe

unto Him. Peace be on the messengers of Allah. All praise be to Allah,

the Lord of the Worlds. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the great Arsh.

Glory be to You. Verily I was of the unjust one. Hallowed is Allah and

Exalted High is He far above what they join with Him. Glory be to Him.

He is Allah the only One, the All-dominant. Glory be to Him in Whose

hand is the basis of everything and to Him is the return of everything.

Glory be to Him the Lord of the seven skies and the Lord of the great

Arsh. Celebrates the praise of Allah, whatever is in the Heavens and the

Earth; He causes life and causes death; and He has power over

everything. He is the First and the Last and the Manifest and the

Hidden, and is the Knower of all things. He it is Who created the

Heavens and the Earth in six days and then firmly established Himself

over the Arsh; knows whatever enters the earth and whatever descends

from the heavens and whatever goes up into it. And He is with you

wherever you be and Allah is the seer of whatever you do. His is the

realm of Heavens and Earth and to Allah is the return of all affairs. He

causes the night to enter in upon the day and causes He the day to

enter in upon the night. He alone is Knower of the secrets of the heart.

Whatever is in the Heavens and whatever is in the Earth praise the

Glory of Allah. He is Ever prevalent, the All wise. He is Allah the
Creator,

the Maker and the Fashioner. His are all the Excellent names;

whatsoever is in the Heavens and in the Earth hallows Him. He is the

Ever prevalent and the All wise. Hallows the Glory of Allah whatsoever
is

in the Heavens and whatsoever is in the Earth. His exclusively is the

Realm and unto Him only is due all praise and He alone over all things
is

All-powerful. And during a part of the night prostrate in obeisance to
Him

and celebrate His praise all night long. Celebrate then the praise of
your

Lord and seek His protection. Verily He is Oft-turning Merciful. Glory
be

to You. People glorify You morning and evening. Men whom neither

transactions nor trade diverts from the remembrance of Allah and

constancy in prayer and paying the Zakat. They fear the day when the

hearts and eyes shall writhe of anguish. Glory be to Him, the Heavens

glorify Him. Everything glorifies His praise with all humility.
Dignified is

He Who is unique in His Glory, Who is known for His unity, well

acquainted to all for His kindness and is Mighty and Omnipotent as the

Lord of the Worlds. All glamour, light and beauty are eternally for Him.
O

Allah! All praise is for You. I ask You all the good for me in my
religion,

world and in my Hereafter. And I seek refuge with You from all evils.

Verily You do what You wish and decree as You desire. Bless

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Holy, virtuous and chosen Progeny and

greet them with a worthy greeting.
