His supplication for fever as taught by the

Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Have mercy on my delicate skin and weak bones, save me from

the burning things. O mother of Muldam, if you believe in Allah do not

eat the flesh, do not drink the blood and do not show your strength on

the mouth and go to the one who ascribes a partner to Allah. I testify
that

there is no lord except Allah and He is one without any partner and that

Muhammad (peace be upon him and his progeny) is His servant and His

Prophet.
