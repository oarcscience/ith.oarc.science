<p>(148)</p>  
<p>His supplication for the twenty-fifth of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>I seek refuge with the perfect words of Allah from the influence of which</p>  
<p>neither the pious nor the vicious can escape, from the evil of Everything</p>  
<p>that grows in the earth or comes out of it, or descends down from the</p>  
<p>Heavens, or ascends towards it, and from the evil of the misfortune of</p>  
<p>the day and night (i.e. vicissitude of fortune), and from every mishap</p>  
<p>save the mishap behind which is hidden good luck. O the Beneficent! O</p>  
<p>the Most Merciful! O Allah! I aspire to have such a faith after which there</p>  
<p>should be no turning to faithlessness, and aspire to have an everlasting</p>  
<p>bounty and companionship of the Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and of</p>  
<p>his virtuous and purified Progeny in the eternal garden of Paradise with</p>  
<p>the Prophets, the truthfuls, the martyrs and the virtuous ones and</p>  
<p>excellent are these as companion. O Allah! Give me peace in exchange</p>  
<p>of fears and put a veil against my defects and overlook my lapses, for</p>  
<p>You are Allah, There is no god save You - You are One and there is no</p>  
<p>associate with You, for You is the absolute kingdom and for You is all</p>  
<p>praise. And You are Powerful over everything. O Allah! I entreat You for</p>  
<p>You are entreated, You are the praised, believed as One, Adorable, the</p>  
<p>great Benefactor with eternal good, Originator of the Heavens and the</p>  
<p>Earth, Glorious and Gracious, to forgive all my sins minor, major</p>  
<p>committed intentionally or in unawareness and those which I have</p>  
<p>forgotten personally, but You have preserved them. Verily You are</p>  
<p>Merciful and turn towards Your bondsmen mercifully. O Allah! O the</p>  
<p>Originator of the Heavens and the Earth! O the Glorious and the</p>  
<p>Gracious! O the Succourer of those who seek Your help! O the</p>  
<p>Redresser of grievances and the centre for those who love to be</p>  
<p>inclined towards You. You are the Dispeller of the Agony of those in</p>  
<p>distress. You are the Bestower of pleasure to the sad. You are the</p>  
<p>Answerer to the call of those in distress. You are devotedly worshipped</p>  
<p>by the Worlds! You are the Most Merciful. You are Dispeller of every</p>  
<p>affliction and the destination for achievement of the desires. Bless</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and treat me in the way that</p>  
<p>befits Your honour. There is no deity save You my Lord. You are my</p>  
<p>Master and I am Your slave, son of Your slave and son of Your maid. My</p>  
<p>destiny is within Your control. I have been unjust to myself and I confess</p>  
<p>my sins and misdeeds. I beseech You for it is Your right to bestow</p>  
<p>favours, O the Great Benefactor! O the Innovator of the Heavens and</p>  
<p>the Earth! O the Glorious and the Gracious! Bestow upon Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) Your Bondsman and messenger and on his Progeny, the best</p>  
<p>of Your blessings never bestowed on anyone of Your Creation. I</p>  
<p>beseech You in the name of Your Power, whereby You split the sea for</p>  
<p>the children of Israel, to protect me from every rebel, envious person, the</p>  
<p>enemy and opponent. And I beseech You with the name of Yours with</p>  
<p>which You shook the mountain over as if it were a covering, and people</p>  
<p>thought that it was going to fall down upon them, to protect me against</p>  
<p>what I fear. O Allah! With Your help I avert my fear for them. And I seek</p>  
<p>refuge with You from their evil and seek Your protection against them. I</p>  
<p>seek help from You against them. O Allah! Allah is my Lord - I associate</p>  
<p>none with Him nor do I accept anyone as my Master. O Allah! Send Your</p>  
<p>Blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny. Ameen.</p>
