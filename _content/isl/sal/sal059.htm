<p>His supplication for seeking sustenance</p>  
<p>(to be recited every morning after morning prayers)</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Praise is for Allah Who gave me the power to recognize myself and have</p>  
<p>not blinded my heart. Praise is for Allah Who included me in the nation</p>  
<p>of Muhammad, peace of Allah be on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure</p>  
<p>progeny. Praise be to Allah Who has kept my sustenance in His hands</p>  
<p>and not left it in the hands of people. Praise is for Allah Who has</p>  
<p>concealed my defects and has not degraded me among the people.</p>  
<p>Praise is for Allah the unique.</p>
