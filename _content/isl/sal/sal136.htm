<p>His supplication for the twelfth of the month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Glorified is Allah Whose Throne is in the Heavens. Glory be to Him</p>  
<p>Whose Might and Glory are manifest on the Earth. Glory be to Him</p>  
<p>Whose paths are in the land and sea. Glory be to Him His sublimity is</p>  
<p>evident in the Heaven. Glory be to Him His proofs are clear on the earth.</p>  
<p>Glory be to Him Whose decisions are also taken in graves. Glory to Him</p>  
<p>Whose punishment for the guilty is in the Hell. Glory be to Him Whose</p>  
<p>Mercy and rewards for the pious men are in Heaven and Glory be to</p>  
<p>Him from Whom no escapees can escape. Glorified is Allah. There is no</p>  
<p>shelter save His. He is Ever-living, death cannot overtake Him. So Glory</p>  
<p>be to Allah when you enter the evening and when you enter the morning</p>  
<p>and His is all praise in the Heavens and in the Earth, at the Sun's</p>  
<p>decline and when you enter the noon. He brings forth the living from the</p>  
<p>dead and brings forth the dead from the living and gives life to the earth</p>  
<p>after its death and you too shall be brought forth after you are dead.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Allah Who has not taken unto Him a son and there is not for</p>  
<p>Him any helped against any meekness and proclaim you His greatness</p>  
<p>magnifying His Glory. Glory be to Him more than the number of all things</p>  
<p>and even greater than that and in a manner befitting His Greatness and</p>  
<p>favours bestowed upon us. O Allah! You are glorified. There is no god</p>  
<p>save You and all praise is for You; praise be to You. Glory be to Allah</p>  
<p>the sublime with all His praise. Glory be to Allah the forbearing, the</p>  
<p>Generous. Glory be to the High and Sublime. Glory be to Him Who is</p>  
<p>the Truth, the Creator and the Withholder. Glory be to Him the Bestower</p>  
<p>of profit and loss. Glory be to the Most High. Glory be to Him the Most</p>  
<p>Sublime, the Most High, the First and the Last, the Manifest, the Hidden</p>  
<p>and Who is Powerful over everything. Glorified is Allah Who possesses</p>  
<p>the aforesaid qualities and there is none like Him. He is Everlasting and</p>  
<p>forgets not. Glory be to Him Who is Constant that never becomes</p>  
<p>unaware. Glory be to Him He is so rich that He never is in want. Glory</p>  
<p>be to Him He is so generous that never shows miserliness. Glory be to</p>  
<p>Him He is so powerful that no weakness comes to Him. Glory be to Him</p>  
<p>He is so watchful that never becomes slack. Glory be to him He is</p>  
<p>Ever-living that would never die. Glorified is He Who is Eternal and</p>  
<p>Everlasting. Glory be to Him Who has no decline. Glory by to Him the</p>  
<p>Ever-living the Self-subsistent. Slumber seizes Him not nor sleep.</p>  
<p>Glorified are You. There is no god save You. You are only One and</p>  
<p>have no partner. Glorified is He Whom the solid mountains praise and</p>  
<p>say in their voice, "Our Allah is Great and praise be to Him". Glory be to</p>  
<p>Him for Whom the trees say in their voice, "Glorified is He Who is the</p>  
<p>real manifest sovereign". Glory be to Him Whom the seven Heavens and</p>  
<p>the Earth and whatever is in them glorify and say: "Glory be to Allah the</p>  
<p>sublime. Forbearing, Generous and praise be to Him." Glorified is He</p>  
<p>Who is illustrious because of His sublimity and Hidden on account of His</p>  
<p>power, Who blesses out of His Mercy and is High because of His</p>  
<p>Loftiness and near on account of his subtlety, and from Whom are not</p>  
<p>hidden the secrets of the hearts. For him neither the darkness of night is</p>  
<p>a curtain nor the stormy ocean, nor the obstructions nor the storm. He</p>  
<p>has surrounded everything through His knowledge and has thrown open</p>  
<p>the gate of His Mercy and forbearance to the miscreants. His Creation is</p>  
<p>novel and matchless in durability and artfulness. Even inanimate objects</p>  
<p>seek in praise of His mighty art and are witness to His unity after their</p>  
<p>creation. O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) the Prophet of Mercy and</p>  
<p>his blessed pure Progeny and O Allah! Disappoint us not of Your Mercy</p>  
<p>and Blessings, keep us after Your guidance under Your refuge from</p>  
<p>being misled and from misleading others. Protect us from bewilderment</p>  
<p>in religion and let us not die save as Muslims. Unite us with the pious in</p>  
<p>the name of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure and purified Progeny. O</p>  
<p>the Lord of Worlds! Grant our prayer. O Allah! Send Your Blessings on</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny. Ameen.</p>
