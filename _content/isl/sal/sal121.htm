<p>His supplication known as "Saname</p>  
<p>Quraish"(Cursing the Idol of Quraish)</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! Curse the two idols of Quraish and their two magicians, their</p>  
<p>two rebellious people, their two accusers and their two daughters.</p>  
<p>Rebuke them, they have consumed Your sustenance and have denied</p>  
<p>Your obligations, both have discarded Your commands, have rejected</p>  
<p>Your revelation, have disobeyed Your Prophet, have destroyed Your</p>  
<p>religion, have distorted Your book, have made Your laws ineffective,</p>  
<p>have declared Your obligatory actions as incorrect, have disbelieved in</p>  
<p>Your signs, have oppressed Your friends, have loved Your enemies,</p>  
<p>have spread corruption among Your servants, have put Your world to</p>  
<p>loss. O Allah! Send Your curses on them and their helpers as they have</p>  
<p>ruined the house of Your Prophet, have dug the door of his house,</p>  
<p>broken the roof, have brought down the walls, have made the skies, the</p>  
<p>ground, have destroyed its inhabitants, have killed their supporters,</p>  
<p>have put to death, their children, have vacated his pulpit by his</p>  
<p>successors of knowledge, have denied his Prophethood, have ascribed</p>  
<p>a partner to their Lord, thus consider both of their sins to be great, and</p>  
<p>make their abode in 'saqar' forever, and how do you know what is</p>  
<p>'saqar?' It leaves nothing, nor let anything remain. O Allah, send Your</p>  
<p>chastisement on them to the extent of the sins of every disobedient, and</p>  
<p>the covering of truth, and all the pulpits they have mounted, and the</p>  
<p>believer whom they have harmed and the disbeliever whom they have</p>  
<p>loved, and to the number of pious people whom they have troubled, and</p>  
<p>whom they have driven out of their cities, and helped the disbelievers,</p>  
<p>and the Imam on whom they were cruel and have changed the</p>  
<p>obligatory laws, and have destroyed the practise of the Holy Prophet,</p>  
<p>and whatever evils they have concealed, the blood which they shed,</p>  
<p>have changed the goodness and have altered the commands, have</p>  
<p>created disbelief, or the lie for which they have cheated, the inheritance</p>  
<p>which they have plundered, and stopped the booties from them and</p>  
<p>have consumed the prohibited wealth, and that 'Khums' (the fifth part)</p>  
<p>which they considered as permitted for them, and that evil whose</p>  
<p>foundation were put, and that cruelty which they made common, that</p>  
<p>oppression, which they spread, those promises, which they</p>  
<p>dishonoured, those covenant which they broke, those lawful which is</p>  
<p>they made as unlawful, and that unlawful which is they made lawful, that</p>  
<p>hypocrisy which they have concealed in the hearts, and to the amount of</p>  
<p>treachery which they bore in their hearts, and the stomachs which they</p>  
<p>split open, and that side which they broke, and that door which they</p>  
<p>broke, and those gatherings which they dispersed and those degraded</p>  
<p>whom they gave honour, and those honourable whom they insulted, and</p>  
<p>by the number of rights which they have usurped, and the order of Imam</p>  
<p>which they opposed, bestow Your wrath on them to the extent of the</p>  
<p>atrocities. O Allah! Your curses on them to the extent of alteration in</p>  
<p>Quran and covering the truth, rendering the will, worthless, and breaking</p>  
<p>the promises, and declaring all the claims as void, refusing all the</p>  
<p>allegiances, presenting excuses, introducing breach of trust, climbing of</p>  
<p>every step and equal to the number of vessel which they turned upside</p>  
<p>down and all that defects which they possessed. Bestow Your curses on</p>  
<p>them. O Allah curse those two, secretly and openly, such a beating</p>  
<p>which is forever continuous, nonstop and innumerable. Such a whipping,</p>  
<p>which commences in the morning but does not end at night. Such a</p>  
<p>beating should be on those tyrants, and their helpers, their assistants,</p>  
<p>their friends and their lovers, those attracted to them and those who</p>  
<p>acknowledge their deeds, those who present proof for them, and those</p>  
<p>who follow their words, and those who approve their actions. (Then</p>  
<p>recite four times).</p>  
<p>O Allah! Send such a harsh chastisement upon them, that the dwellers</p>  
<p>of Hell start screaming, O Lord of the Universe accept this prayer from</p>  
<p>me.</p>
