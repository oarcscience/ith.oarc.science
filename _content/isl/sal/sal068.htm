<p>His supplication cursing the enemies after</p>  
<p>reciting two units of prayers</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! So and so son of so and so (here take the name of the</p>  
<p>oppressor) is oppressing me and troubling me making me unhappy and</p>  
<p>degrading and insulting me. O Allah! Put him at the mercy of his own</p>  
<p>soul and remove his support, make him dependent on others and snatch</p>  
<p>away Your bounties from him, discontinue his sustenance, shorter his</p>  
<p>lifespan, deface him and make his enemies overpower him who may</p>  
<p>capture him in his place of safety in the same way as he has done</p>  
<p>oppression on me, laid a trap for me, made me burn in fire, insulted and</p>  
<p>degraded me. O Allah! Through You I seek refuge from so and so (here</p>  
<p>mention his name) because You are the greatest subduer and the one</p>  
<p>to punish most severely.</p>
