<p>His supplication for the twenty-fourth of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! Protect my faith, protect my body, and protect my hearing, and</p>  
<p>seeing and let these two be my inheritors. O the Creator! You have no</p>  
<p>beginning. O the Everlasting! You have no end. O the Ever-living! Death</p>  
<p>touches You not. O Who gives life to the dead! O Who watches the</p>  
<p>deeds of every soul! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, and</p>  
<p>do with me in the manner befitting Your dignity. O Allah! The Cleaver of</p>  
<p>the dawn Who has made the night for rest, and the sun and the moon</p>  
<p>for reckoning (time), repay my loan, and protect me from poverty, and</p>  
<p>make the faculties of hearing and seeing beneficial for me, and bestow</p>  
<p>upon me enough strength to strive in Your way, O the Most Merciful! O</p>  
<p>Allah! You are the Most Merciful, There is no god save You, and</p>  
<p>innovator like to You, before You, Everlasting with no end, Ever-living</p>  
<p>Whom death touches not, the Creator of what is seen and of what is not</p>  
<p>seen. Every day You are in a new splendorous manifestation. Bless</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny. Your dignity demands that there</p>  
<p>should be forgiveness from You for me, my parents, my children and my</p>  
<p>brothers, O the Most Merciful! O Allah! You are All-knowing without</p>  
<p>being informed. All Praise be therefore to You. O Allah! O Allah! Allah is</p>  
<p>my Lord. I do not associate anything with Him. He is All-hearing,</p>  
<p>All-seeing. Vision perceives Him not and He perceives all vision. He is</p>  
<p>the Subtle, All-aware. O Allah! I beseech You and You do what You wish</p>  
<p>and I turn to You through Muhammad Your Prophet, Prophet of mercy</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.). O Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)! I turn through you to Allah, your Lord</p>  
<p>and my Lord, for the fulfillment of my needs, and that He may bless you</p>  
<p>and your pure and purified progeny, and O Allah! Deal with me as it</p>  
<p>befits You. O Allah! I beseech You with that name of Yours with which</p>  
<p>walking is possible on water in the manner one walks on leveled ground.</p>  
<p>And I beseech You with that name of Yours which Musa (a.s.) invoked</p>  
<p>You from the auspicious Mount Sinai, and the invocation was accepted</p>  
<p>by You and You cast down upon him love from You. And I beseech You</p>  
<p>with that name of Yours with which Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) invoked You</p>  
<p>and You thereupon forgave him the past, and perfected on him Your</p>  
<p>bounties. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and do with me</p>  
<p>that which befits You. O Allah! I beseech You in the name of the</p>  
<p>honoured portions of Your Throne and in the name of utmost mercy of</p>  
<p>Your Book. And I beseech You with Your sublime name, Your glory,</p>  
<p>Your perfect words from the influence of which neither the pious nor the</p>  
<p>non-virtuous can escape. And I beseech You, O Allah, O the Beneficent,</p>  
<p>O the merciful, O the Glorious, O Allah the One, the matchless, the</p>  
<p>Unique, the Needles, Firm in justice, There is no god save You the</p>  
<p>Mighty and All-wise, You are Peerless, the Great and the Sublime to</p>  
<p>bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, and to make me enter the</p>  
<p>Paradise, forgiven without any reckoning and bestow on me out of Your</p>  
<p>blessings, generosity compassion, mercy and favours such that it befits</p>  
<p>You. O Allah! Spoil not my name and disfigure not my body, break not</p>  
<p>my back with trials and let not my enemies mock at me, O the Generous!</p>  
<p>O Allah! I seek refuge with You from riches making me rebellious against</p>  
<p>You and from poverty making me forget everything - Commands and</p>  
<p>Prohibitions, and from desires leading me to ruination and from deeds</p>  
<p>causing disgrace. I believe in One and Matchless Lord - I associate</p>  
<p>none with Him and call none other than Him as deity nor do I accept</p>  
<p>anyone else beside Him as my Master. O Allah! Bless Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, and make those things easy for me the</p>  
<p>hardships of which I am afraid of, and lighten those affairs which I feel</p>  
<p>difficult, and make those things non-fatiguing which are tiring and help</p>  
<p>me to overcome the harshness of problems I am afraid of, and with Your</p>  
<p>pleasure grant me happiness in exchange of distress in the worldly life</p>  
<p>and in the life of Hereafter. O Allah! Grant me the sincerity of Prophets</p>  
<p>in my reliance on You, and the efficacy of accepted invocations in my</p>  
<p>invocations and make my deeds like the deeds which find acceptance</p>  
<p>with You. O Allah! Grant me ability to carry out the commands the</p>  
<p>burden whereof You lay on me, and lay not on me the burden of the</p>  
<p>commands which I am unable to carry out. Allah is sufficient for me as</p>  
<p>the Most Excellent Protector. O Allah! Send help for me and not against</p>  
<p>me. Decide in my favour against those who behave unjustly with me,</p>  
<p>devise for me and contrive not against me. Guide me and make the</p>  
<p>guidance easy for me. O Allah! I entrust to You under Your trusteeship</p>  
<p>my belief, my trust the result of my deeds, and all the bounties of the</p>  
<p>world and those of the Hereafter bestowed upon me by You, verily You</p>  
<p>do not lose the trust of others. There is neither anyone to protect me</p>  
<p>against You nor do I have any refuge beside You. O Allah! Bless</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and leave me not alone to myself</p>  
<p>even for the winking of an eye. And take not back the good which You</p>  
<p>have bestowed upon me, for verily none can withhold that which You</p>  
<p>bestow, and none can bestow that which You withhold. The good luck of</p>  
<p>any striver makes him not independent of You. O our Lord! Grant us</p>  
<p>good in this world and good in the Hereafter and save us from the</p>  
<p>torment of Hellfire. And bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his virtuous</p>  
<p>Progeny! O the Most Merciful!</p>
