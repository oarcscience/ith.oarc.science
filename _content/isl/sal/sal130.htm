<p>His supplication for the sixth of the month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O God! Praise be to You in a manner that might bring me closer to Your</p>  
<p>pleasure and enable me to offer thanks to You thereby making myself</p>  
<p>more deserving of Your bounties. Praise be to You for You grant mercy</p>  
<p>despite having knowledge of our sins and praise be to You for Your</p>  
<p>pardon despite having power to punish. O Allah! Praise be to You as</p>  
<p>You have bestowed on us Your bounties after bounties. Praise be to</p>  
<p>You for selecting Islam as religion for us and praise be to You for</p>  
<p>bestowing the Holy Quran. Praise be to You for favouring us with wealth</p>  
<p>and offspring as well as granting us pardon. Praise be to You in times of</p>  
<p>hardship and those of comfort, during affluence as well stringency and</p>  
<p>under all conditions. O Allah! Praise be to You as You deserve; in the</p>  
<p>manner that is befitting Your glorious Countenance. O my Lord! Praise</p>  
<p>be to You as numerous as are the numbers of hair, of leaves and trees,</p>  
<p>of pebbles and bricks, of the particles of the desert sand, of the days of</p>  
<p>this world, of Hereafter and the stars of the Heaven. O my Allah! We</p>  
<p>thank You for what You have done for us. Praise be to You for every</p>  
<p>command You issue when You intend anything and say, to it "Be", it</p>  
<p>takes shape. Praise be to Allah Who forgets him not who remembers</p>  
<p>Him. Praise be to Allah for He disappoints him not who invokes Him.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Allah Who suffices him, who relies on Him. Praise be to</p>  
<p>Allah that who entrusts Him is not entrusted to anyone beside Him for</p>  
<p>support. Praise be to Allah Who grants goodness in return of goodness</p>  
<p>and deliverance in return of patience. Praise be to Allah Who wards off</p>  
<p>hardships and losses from us. Praise be to Allah Who is our ultimate and</p>  
<p>trusted hope after we exhaust all efforts for the fulfillment of our desires.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Allah Who is our hope even after we spoil our thoughts by</p>  
<p>evil deeds and becomes despondent. Praise be to Allah Who saves</p>  
<p>when I seek his protection although I may be advancing towards things</p>  
<p>that are harmful to me. Praise be to Allah Who succours me when I seek</p>  
<p>His help. O Allah! Praise be to Allah that when I call Him, He responds;</p>  
<p>and when I seek His aid, He helps me. Praise be to Allah that when I ask</p>  
<p>him, He bestows His favours despite my miserliness at His call for loan.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Allah Whom I call whenever I wish for the fulfillment of my</p>  
<p>needs. Praise be to Allah Who shows absolute mercy towards me as if I</p>  
<p>have no sinful deeds. Praise be to Allah Who shows love towards me.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Allah Who has not entrusted me to ordinary people</p>  
<p>otherwise they would have put me to disgrace. Praise be to Allah Who</p>  
<p>has favoured us by sending His Messenger, Muhammad (s.a.w.a.). All</p>  
<p>praise be to Allah Who carried us in the land and on the sea and</p>  
<p>provided us with sustenance of good things and exalted us by several</p>  
<p>degrees over most of those whom He has created by degree of</p>  
<p>exaltation. Praise be to Allah Who dispelled our fears. Praise be to Allah</p>  
<p>Who concealed our defects. Praise be to Allah Who gave us to eat to</p>  
<p>satiation in hunger. All praise be to Allah Who overlooked our faults.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Allah Who provided us with sustenance. Praise be to Allah</p>  
<p>Who secured us against fear. Praise be to Allah Who disgraced our</p>  
<p>enemies. Praise be to Allah Who caused affection between our hearts.</p>  
<p>All praise be to Allah Who is the Master of the Realm and Guardian of</p>  
<p>the ship. Praise be to Allah Who disperses the winds and cleaves the</p>  
<p>dawn and Who is the most High and Overwhelming. All praise be to</p>  
<p>Allah Who being hidden is All-knowing. Praise be to Allah Who is</p>  
<p>encompassing everything through His Knowledge and takes account of</p>  
<p>everything. Praise to be to Allah Whose powerful insight pervades</p>  
<p>through everything. Praise be to Allah Whose knowledge embraces</p>  
<p>everything and for Whom is meant all dignified praise and exalted</p>  
<p>beautiful names. All praise be to Allah from Whose command there is no</p>  
<p>escape. Praise be to Allah from Whom there is no place of refuge; rather</p>  
<p>to Him is the return and reward. Praise be to Allah Who never becomes</p>  
<p>unmindful of anything, nothing engages Him. Glory be to Allah from</p>  
<p>Whom neither fortresses can protect nor the walls can hide nor the</p>  
<p>oceans can carry afar from them and everything will have to return to</p>  
<p>Him. All praise be to Allah Whose promise is firm. Whose devotee is</p>  
<p>helped and He alone defeats the armies. Praise be to Allah Who gives</p>  
<p>life to the dead and puts to death those alive and Who is Powerful over</p>  
<p>everything. Praise be to Allah for His plentiful bestowal. Whose</p>  
<p>decisions are final and Whose boons are outstripping. Praise be to</p>  
<p>Allah, the Lord of the Earth and the Heavens, Who is deserving the</p>  
<p>praise most amongst all those that are Praiseworthy and deserving the</p>  
<p>honour most amidst all honourable. Praise be to Allah Whose Might</p>  
<p>wanes not. O my Lord! All praise be to You in the Night when it spreads.</p>  
<p>All praise be to You in the day when the sun shines. Praise be to You in</p>  
<p>this world and in the Hereafter. Praise be to You high up in the</p>  
<p>Heavens, in the Earths below and in the lowest of the low below the</p>  
<p>Earth. O Allah! Praise be to You in an ever increasing and endless</p>  
<p>manner that never diminishes. Praise be to You such that always</p>  
<p>mounts and never exhausts, that should always stay and never end, that</p>  
<p>should be permanent and everlasting. It is You Who are praised and for</p>  
<p>You is the sovereignty over the earth and its populace, O the Generous</p>  
<p>one!</p>
