<p>Dua-e-Sabah</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Oh God, Oh He Who extended the morning's tongue in the speech of its</p>  
<p>dawning, dispatched the fragments of the dark night into the gloom of its</p>  
<p>stammering, made firm the structure of the turning spheres in the</p>  
<p>measures of its display and beamed forth the brightness of the sun</p>  
<p>through the light of its blazing! Oh He, Who demonstrates His Essence</p>  
<p>by His Essence, transcends congeniality with His creatures and is</p>  
<p>exalted beyond conformity with His qualities! Oh He Who is near to the</p>  
<p>passing thoughts of opinions, far from the regards of eyes and knows</p>  
<p>what will be before it comes to be! Oh He, Who has put me at ease in</p>  
<p>the cradle of His security and sanctuary, awakened me to the favors and</p>  
<p>kindness that He has bestowed upon me and hell from the claws of evil</p>  
<p>with His hand and His force! Bless, oh God, the guide to You in the</p>  
<p>darkest night, him who, of Your ropes, clings to the cord of the longest</p>  
<p>nobility, him whose glory is evident at the summit of stout shoulders and</p>  
<p>whose feet were entrenched in spite of slippery places in ancient time;</p>  
<p>and [bless] his household, the good, the chosen, the pious, And open for</p>  
<p>us, oh God, the leaves of morning's door with the keys of mercy and</p>  
<p>prosperity! Clothe me, oh God, with the most excellent robes of</p>  
<p>guidance and r ighteousness! Plant, oh God, through Your</p>  
<p>tremendousness, the springs of humility in the watering place of my</p>  
<p>hear! Cause to flow, oh God, because of Your awesomeness, tears of</p>  
<p>moaning from the corner of my eyes! And chastise, oh God, the</p>  
<p>recklessness of my clumsiness with the reins of contentment! My God, if</p>  
<p>mercy from You does not begin with fair success for me, then who can</p>  
<p>take me to You upon the evident path? If Your deliberateness would turn</p>  
<p>me over to the guide of hope and wishes, then who will annul my slips</p>  
<p>from the stumbles of caprice? If Your deliberateness should turn me over</p>  
<p>to the guide of hope and wishes, then who will annul my slips from the</p>  
<p>stumbles of caprice? If Your help should forsake me in the battle with the</p>  
<p>soul and Satan, then Your forsaking will have entrusted me to where</p>  
<p>there is hardship and deprivation. My God, does You see that I have</p>  
<p>only come to You from the direction of hopes or clung to the ends of</p>  
<p>Your cords when my sins have driven me from the house of union? So</p>  
<p>what an evil mount upon which my soul has mounted - its caprice! Woe</p>  
<p>upon it for being seduced by its own opinions and wishes! And</p>  
<p>destruction be upon it for its audacity toward its Master and Protector!</p>  
<p>My God, I have knocked upon the door of Your mercy with the hand of</p>  
<p>my hope, fled to You seeking refuge from my excessive caprice and</p>  
<p>fixed the fingers of my love to the ends of Your cords. So pardon, oh</p>  
<p>God, the slips and errors I have committed and release me from the foot</p>  
<p>tangling of my robe. For You are my Master, my Protector, my Support</p>  
<p>and my Hope and You are the object of my search and my desire in my</p>  
<p>ultimate end and stable abode. My God, how couldst You drive away a</p>  
<p>poor beggar who seeks refuge in You from sins, fleeing? Or how could</p>  
<p>You disappoint one seeking guidance who repairs to Your threshold</p>  
<p>running? Never! For Your pools are full in the hardship of drought, Your</p>  
<p>door is open for seeking and penetration and You are the goal of</p>  
<p>requests and the object of hopes. My God, these are the reins of my</p>  
<p>soul I have bound them with the ties of Your will. These are the burdens</p>  
<p>of my sins I have averted them with Your pardon and mercy. And these</p>  
<p>are my caprices that lead astray - I have entrusted them to the threshold</p>  
<p>of Your gentleness and kindliness. So make this morning of mine, oh</p>  
<p>God, descend upon me with the radiance of guidance, and with safety in</p>  
<p>religion and this world! And [make] my evening a shield against the</p>  
<p>deception of enemies and a protection against the destructive blows of</p>  
<p>caprice! Verily You are able over what You will! You gives the kingdom</p>  
<p>to whom You will, and You seizes the kingdom from whom You will; You</p>  
<p>exalts whom You will, and You abases whom You will; in Your hand is</p>  
<p>the good; You are powerful over all things. You make the night to enter</p>  
<p>into the day, and You make the day to enter into the night; You bring</p>  
<p>forth the living from the dead, and You bring forth dead from the living;</p>  
<p>and You provides whomsoever You will without reckoning. There is no</p>  
<p>god but You! Glory be to You, oh God, and Your is the praise! Who</p>  
<p>knows Your measure without fearing You? Who knows what You are</p>  
<p>without awe of You? Through Your power You have joined disparate</p>  
<p>things, through Your gentleness You have cleaved apart the daybreak</p>  
<p>and through Your generosity You have illumined the dark shrouds of</p>  
<p>night. You have made waters, sweet and salt, flow forth from hard</p>  
<p>shining stones, sent down out of rain-clouds water cascading and</p>  
<p>appointed the sun and moon a blazing lamp for the creatures, without</p>  
<p>experiencing in that which You originated either weariness or effort. So,</p>  
<p>oh He Who is alone in might and subsistence and dominates His slaves</p>  
<p>with death and annihilation, Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his</p>  
<p>household, the god fearing, answer my supplication hear my call,</p>  
<p>destroy my enemies and actualize through Your bounty my hope and</p>  
<p>desire. Oh best of those who is called to remove affliction and object of</p>  
<p>hope in every difficulty and ease! I have stated my need, so do not reject</p>  
<p>me, oh my master, despairing of Your exalted gifts. Oh All generous! Oh</p>  
<p>All generous! Oh All generous! By Your mercy, oh Most Merciful of the</p>  
<p>merciful! And God bless the best of His creatures, Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.), and all his household!</p>  
<p>Then go in prostration and say:</p>  
<p>My God, my heart is veiled, my soul deficient, my intelligence defeated,</p>  
<p>my caprice triumphant, my obedience little, my disobedience much and</p>  
<p>my tongue acknowledges sins. So what am I to do? Oh He Who covers</p>  
<p>defects! Oh He Who knows the unseen things! Forgive my sins, all of</p>  
<p>them, by the sacredness of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the household of</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) Oh All-forgiver! Oh All-forgiver! Oh All-forgiver! By</p>  
<p>Your mercy, oh Most Merciful of the merciful!</p>
