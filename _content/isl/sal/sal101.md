His supplication for Nafilah on Friday

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

In the name of Allah, In the name of Allah, In the name of Allah. The
best

of the names, the most honoured names the most exalted names. By the

name of Allah Whose kingdom comprises of the earth and the Heavens.

Praise is for Allah Who created every living thing from water. Praise is

for Allah Who enlivened my heart with faith, and bestowed Islam for me.

O Allah, accept my repentance, purify my heart, protect me and judge

me with goodness and safety in all conditions, and show me everything I

wish for in this world and the hereafter. Open up the doors of goodness

for me. O the one Who listens to our prayers.
