<p>His supplication for the twentieth of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, shower Your</p>  
<p>Mercy on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and favour Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny with abundance in the manner You blessed,</p>  
<p>bestowed Mercy and favoured Ibrahim and his progeny. Verily You are</p>  
<p>Praiseworthy and Glorious. This invocation to You to bestow blessings</p>  
<p>upon Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, should lead us to Your</p>  
<p>pleasure and Paradise and protect us from Your wrath and Hell-fire. O</p>  
<p>Allah! Exalt our Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) to a praised position,</p>  
<p>which may be longed by the people of the ancient period and the people</p>  
<p>of the last period. O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and greet them with a worthy greeting.</p>  
<p>Reserve for him the best of merits, best of leadership and favour him</p>  
<p>with the most honoured position amongst the honoured people. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Reserve for Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) a remembrance worthy of fame and</p>  
<p>reserve for him a cistern full of water. O Allah! Exalt his foundation and</p>  
<p>bless honour to his arguments and bless us with a drink with his cup,</p>  
<p>convey us to his cistern and include us in his party that we may not be of</p>  
<p>the disgraced, repentants, complainants, the innovators, the</p>  
<p>covenant-breakers, the doubters, the deniers, the tried one, misguided</p>  
<p>and misguiding ones. We are pleased with the Heavenly reward and</p>  
<p>convinced of Your chastisement. This is a special bounty from You.</p>  
<p>Verily You are Mighty and Bestower. O Allah! Bless Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, the guiding Imam towards goodness and the</p>  
<p>leader of virtue. O the Most Merciful! Amplify his blessings on all Your</p>  
<p>bondsmen, in all lands, all animals and vegetables. O Allah! Bestow on</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) better merits than other merit, bounties better than</p>  
<p>all other bounties, circumstances easier than all other circumstances,</p>  
<p>gifts better than all other gifts, fortune better than other fortunes, till none</p>  
<p>of Your Creation becomes nearer to You, better in status near You,</p>  
<p>better intercessor, more honoured before You, more distinguished in</p>  
<p>status and intercession that Muhammad (s.a.w.a.). Grant him a life full of</p>  
<p>bliss, everlasting bounties perfect in merits, honoured leadership,</p>  
<p>tranquility and pleasure in discarding the egotistic tendencies. All this</p>  
<p>honour granted by You to him should be matchless. O Allah! Grant</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) a Means and bestow upon him, loftiness,</p>  
<p>excellence, eminence amongst the dominant people, love towards him</p>  
<p>amongst the chosen ones, highest rank amongst the near ones to You.</p>  
<p>And we bear witness for him that he preached to the people as Your</p>  
<p>Messenger, admonished Your bondsmen, recited Your verses to them,</p>  
<p>and established Your law, explained minutely the details of Your</p>  
<p>behests, and enforced Your Commands, fulfilled the Covenant with You,</p>  
<p>endeavoured his utmost in Your way and devoted sincerely to Your</p>  
<p>worship till death overtook him. And he commanded his people to obey</p>  
<p>only You. He himself remained obedient to You and forbade the people</p>  
<p>from disobedience to You, abstaining himself from it. He loved Your</p>  
<p>friend whom You desired to be love; He was an enemy to Your enemy to</p>  
<p>whom You wanted him to be an enemy. O Lord of the Worlds! May Your</p>  
<p>Blessings be on him and on his progeny, the leader (Imam) of the pious,</p>  
<p>the last of the Prophets, the best of the Messengers and Your</p>  
<p>Messenger. O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny</p>  
<p>during the night when it enshrouds. O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
<p>and his Progeny during the day when it shines, and bless him in the</p>  
<p>Hereafter and world and be pleased with him and increase this pleasure.</p>  
<p>O Allah! Cool the eyes of our Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) through his</p>  
<p>followers of the Ummat, his wives, his progeny and his companions and</p>  
<p>through us, the members of the Holy House, all his people (Ummat), our</p>  
<p>family members and one love for whom You have made obligatory on us</p>  
<p>living or dead, cool his eyes. O Allah! Also cool our eyes by a glimpse of</p>  
<p>him and then never cause a separation between us and him. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Carry us to his cistern and a drink, in his cup, include us in his group</p>  
<p>under his banner and disappoint us not his companionship. Verily You</p>  
<p>are Powerful over all things. Peace, Blessings, Mercy and Favours from</p>  
<p>Allah be on him and on his pure and virtuous Progeny. O Allah! the Lord</p>  
<p>of death and life, Lord of Heavens and Earth, Lord of the Worlds, our</p>  
<p>Lord and Lord of our forefathers, You are One Needless, begot You not,</p>  
<p>nor You are begotten and there is none like to You, You are the Master</p>  
<p>of the sovereigns through Your power. You have made the masters Your</p>  
<p>slaves through Your might. You are the Leader of the honoured people</p>  
<p>through Your generosity and You dispersed the nobles through Your</p>  
<p>might, and razed the mountains through Your greatness, and reserved</p>  
<p>the Pride and greatness exclusively for Yourself. The praise and</p>  
<p>applause became exclusively Yours. Glory and Honour are Your special</p>  
<p>attributes. None can reach the height of Your attributes and none can</p>  
<p>equal You in Your might. You are refuge for those seeking refuge with</p>  
<p>You. You are the hiding place for those who want to hide, You are the</p>  
<p>place of confidence for the believers, and the way for fulfillment of needs</p>  
<p>for the seekers. I beseech You to have mercy on me and to keep me firm</p>  
<p>in my beliefs in the times of every misguiding calamity. You are the place</p>  
<p>for me to lodge my complaints and a place of fulfillments of my wants.</p>  
<p>There is none like the like of You and none to equal You in Your Might.</p>  
<p>You are greater, more glorious, more generous, mightier, loftier, more</p>  
<p>sublime, nobler more honoured and liberal than Your whole creation.</p>  
<p>You have praised Your own Self, O the Master of the Day of Judgment!</p>  
<p>O Allah! I beseech in the name which is for You, and You desire to be</p>  
<p>invoked through that name, and I beseech You through every invocation</p>  
<p>which found acceptance with You, through which You were invoked by</p>  
<p>anyone of Your Creation from the people of the ancient epoch and the</p>  
<p>people of the last epoch, to forgive all my sins past and present, minor</p>  
<p>and major, committed secretly and openly, known to me or unknown,</p>  
<p>which You have reckoned and preserved them and I have personally</p>  
<p>forgotten. O Allah! forgive me and be Merciful to me and turn to me</p>  
<p>compassionately! Verily You turn compassionately towards Your</p>  
<p>bondsman, O the Most Merciful!</p>
