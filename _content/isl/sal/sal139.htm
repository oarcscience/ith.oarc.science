<p>His supplication for the fifteenth of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! There is no god save You. I ask You in Your name - the</p>  
<p>Matchless, the One, the Needless, the Unique, the Exalted the name</p>  
<p>with its effect on everything. And I ask You for the sake of Your unique</p>  
<p>name which has no parallel. I ask You through Your Most Sublime name</p>  
<p>and request You for the sake of Your name - Most Glorious and</p>  
<p>beseech You in Your name - Most Gracious and ask You with Your</p>  
<p>name - La Ilaha Illa Hu (There is no God but He) the Knower of the</p>  
<p>Unseen and the Manifest, the Beneficent, the Merciful. And I ask You</p>  
<p>through Your names - the Most Holy, the peace Loving, the Saviour, the</p>  
<p>Guardian, the Ever prevalent, the Supreme, the Great Absolute,</p>  
<p>Hallowed You are O Allah! You are far above from what they ascribe to</p>  
<p>You And I ask You for the sake of Your name, the Generous, the Mighty,</p>  
<p>for You are Allah with no god beside You. You are the Creator, the</p>  
<p>Originator, the Fashioner. For You have all beautiful names. Whatever is</p>  
<p>in the Heavens and the Earth glorifies You. You are Mighty and Wise.</p>  
<p>And I ask You through Your name Secret and Hidden. There is no god</p>  
<p>save You. And I ask You through Your name with which if You are</p>  
<p>invoked You respond and You bestow upon him when one entreats You</p>  
<p>with that name. And I ask You through the name with which asked You</p>  
<p>Your bondsman who had some knowledge of the Book and You brought</p>  
<p>to him the throne of Bilquees ere to twinkling of his eyes. I beseech You</p>  
<p>with it and I invoke You. O Allah! You accepted the invocation, when</p>  
<p>You were invoked with it. Kindly therefore accept, O Allah!, my</p>  
<p>invocation for what I invoke You ere my eye twinkles. O Allah! I beseech</p>  
<p>You with "Laa Ilaha Illa Anta" as there is no deity save You the</p>  
<p>Ever-living, the self-subsistent. Slumber seizes You not nor the sleep.</p>  
<p>And I ask You O Allah! There is no god save You in the name of the</p>  
<p>ancient scripture and through the names of Yours mentioned therein and</p>  
<p>through the invocation which finds acceptance with You when one</p>  
<p>invokes You. And I beseech You O Allah! For the sake of Psalm-Book</p>  
<p>(Zaboor) and through the names of Yours mentioned therein and</p>  
<p>through the invocation which finds acceptance with You when one</p>  
<p>invokes You. There is no god save You! I beseech You O Allah! In the</p>  
<p>name of Evangel and through the names of Yours mentioned therein</p>  
<p>and through the invocation which finds acceptance with You when one</p>  
<p>invokes You. There is no god save You! I beseech You O Allah! In the</p>  
<p>name of Torah and through the names of Yours mentioned therein and</p>  
<p>through the invocation which finds acceptance with You when one</p>  
<p>invokes You. There is no god save You! I beseech You O Allah! In the</p>  
<p>name of Great Quran and through the names of Yours mentioned</p>  
<p>therein and through the invocation which finds acceptance with You</p>  
<p>when one invokes You. There is no god save You! I beseech You O</p>  
<p>Allah! In the name of every Book You have revealed to anyone of Your</p>  
<p>creation in the seven Heavens and seven Earths and the Creation in</p>  
<p>between them. There is no god save You! I beseech You O Allah!</p>  
<p>Through every name, which You have reserved exclusively for Yourself,</p>  
<p>or the names with which You have apprised anyone from Your creation</p>  
<p>or the name with which You have apprised none of Your creation. There</p>  
<p>is no god save You! I beseech You O Allah! Through the invocation with</p>  
<p>which Your virtuous bondsmen invoked You and You accepted their</p>  
<p>invocations. O Allah! I therefore beseech You with all these with a</p>  
<p>request to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure and purified</p>  
<p>Progeny, O the Lord of the Worlds! And to grant me my request through</p>  
<p>it, O my Master! Verily You are Hearer of the invocation and Merciful to</p>  
<p>the bondsmen.</p>
