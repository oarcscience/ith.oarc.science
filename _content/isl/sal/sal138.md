His supplication for the fourteenth of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O my Lord! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), the Ummi Prophet and his

Progeny in the manner You blessed Ibrahim (a.s.) and his offspring.

Surely You are Praiseworthy and Glorified. O Allah! After praising You

and seeking Your Blessing for Your Prophet, I beseech You forgive all

my sins, past and present, manifest and hidden, known to me or

unknown and those You have reckoned which I have personally

forgotten. O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! O the Beneficent! O the
Beneficent!

O the Beneficent! O the Merciful! O the Merciful! O the Merciful! There

is no god save You, the voice of the people are choked before You.

Their mind is confused and the eyes are dazzled before You and we are

present in Your Court with our hearts. There is no god except You. All

things are humble before You and are incapable of reaching You. All

things are submissive to Your honour. There is no god beside You. All

creatures are within Your powerful control and so are their forelocks

within Your grip. Who attributes partner to You is also Your creature.

You are the Lord with no peer and immortal with no destruction,

Self-subsistent without any decline. Absolute Sovereign with no

associate, Ever-living Who enlivens the dead and watchful seeing the

deeds of everyone. There is no god beside You! You are the One

existing before Your Creation and would survive even after the death

and destruction of all things. To them You are Manifest and for them

You are Master support at the back, Nearer to them, their Ruler and

Creator, You take the possession of their souls. You are their
sustainer,

their Ultimate Hope, their Guardian, Centre of their complaints, remover

of their troubles and their Forgiver. There is none above You to

intervene between You and Your creatures. In Your control is their stay

and departure from this worlds. We recline to You with hope and seek

Your kindness. There is no power and Might but through You. There is

no god but You. You are the source of strength for every weak,

Redresser of every complaint, Assurer of the frightened, Hearer of every

plaint and Dispeller of every trouble. There is no god save You. You are

the Fortress for everyone who seeks refuge, the Honour of every

degraded and the Redeemer of everyone who is oppressed. O You the

Powerful and Almighty! There is no power and strength without You.

There is no god except You. You are owner of every bounty, Dispeller of

every evil, ultimate Hope for fulfillment of every desire, and Fulfiller
of

every need. There is no power and might without You. There is no god

beside You. You are kind to Your creatures and to Your bondsmen

although You are independent of them and they are completely

dependent on You. There is no god save You. You are aware of

everything hidden and witness every secret of the heart, You bless

whom You wish and do what You please, O the Ever-living! There is no

god except You. There is no might or power without You, O! Allah! You

are the Knower of the hidden and the manifest, the Beneficent; the

Merciful, Originator of the Heavens and the earth, Glorious and

Gracious. You are Forgiver of sins, Acceptor of penitence, Severe in

chastisement and Bountiful in giving. There is no god except You and to

You is the return. O Allah! I ask You in the name of "there is no god
but

You" to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and fulfill my

desires, my hopes and my aims as it is easy for You because You are

Powerful over all things. In fact You are so powerful that to whatever

thing You say "Be", it comes into being at once. O Allah! Send Your

Blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny. Ameen.
