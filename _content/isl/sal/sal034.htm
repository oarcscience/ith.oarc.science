<p>Supplication the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
<p>taught him and he recited it at the time of</p>  
<p>ending the fast</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! Lord of the great light, possessor of the high throne, Master of</p>  
<p>the moving seas, Owner of the great intercession, Owner of the holy</p>  
<p>light, Lord of the TORAH, BIBLE and PSALMS, and of the great Furqan</p>  
<p>(Quran). You are Allah for the creatures of Heaven and Earth. There is</p>  
<p>no other Lord in the entire Universe. You are dominating the creatures</p>  
<p>of the skies and the earth and there is no king other than You. By Your</p>  
<p>great name and by the light of Your generous face, and by Your</p>  
<p>ever-existing kingdom, I seek from You, O the living, O the ever living! O</p>  
<p>the living, O the ever living! O the living, O the ever living! I beseech</p>  
<p>You in that name by which You have illuminated the Heavens and the</p>  
<p>Earth, and by that name with which the earlier nations attained</p>  
<p>salvation, and by which the future nations will achieve forgiveness. O</p>  
<p>the living before the existence of every living and the living after the</p>  
<p>extinction of every living. O the living except Whom there is no god.</p>  
<p>Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the progeny of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.),</p>  
<p>forgive my sins, make my affairs easy for me, grant me peace and</p>  
<p>tranquility at the earliest and keep me on the religion of Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny. On the guidance of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
<p>and his progeny and on the tradition of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his</p>  
<p>progeny. Grant my deeds a high status and worthy of acceptance, and</p>  
<p>grant me the things which You have granted to Your pious and close</p>  
<p>servants because I have faith on You, I have relied on You and I am</p>  
<p>pleading with You, and have presented myself in Your presence then</p>  
<p>gather me and my parents, my household and all pious offspring</p>  
<p>together at one place and keep sorrow away from me, and my parents,</p>  
<p>and my offspring and from all my children. My Lord You are very</p>  
<p>generous unmatched Creator of the Heavens and the earth. You give to</p>  
<p>whomsoever You wish and withhold from whomsoever You wish. O most</p>  
<p>merciful of the mercifuls by the sake of Your mercy have mercy on me.</p>
