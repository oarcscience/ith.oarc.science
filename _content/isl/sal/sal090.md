His supplication for rains known as

'Istiskaa'

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Praise is for Allah Who has completed the bounties, dispelled the

sorrow, given life to the living things. Who for His great throne has
made

sky as a pillar and for His creatures earth as a carpet and mountains as

tent-pegs, the angels who rotate the earth and those who hold the skies

are on their mounts, and the pillars of the earth are withheld by His

Honour. Illuminated the universe by the Sun, and by its rays dispelled

the dark nights, and made the water flow on the earth, gifted the moon

with light and the stars with sparkle, then He rose and manifested His

Power and Created the earth. Then the strong and the arrogant one

was broken and was seeking the needs of the indigent people. O Allah!

For the sake of Your Honoured position and High Status and the safe

standard bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and His progeny as they have

manifested Your obedience and invited people towards You, have

fulfilled Your covenant, have implied Your laws, have treaded the path
of

Your signs. He is Your creature, the trustworthy of Your covenant, the

caller towards Your laws, a witness of the caller towards Your

obedience and the invalidator of the excuses of the disobedient. O
Allah!

Bestow bounty on Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) in such a measure that

You have reserved for anyone singly, and have illuminated their faces

by Your light, make their faces more illuminated and give him a position

more nearer than all other prophets, grant him the greatest share of

Your Pleasure and arrange his nation in the maximum rows because

they have never bowed before the idols, never prayed before trees,

neither drank wine nor blood. O Allah! We have left from Your presence

when darkness of distress had spread all over and the signs of poverty

made people helpless and we were made to subdue because of the

humiliation of relatives. And the group who lied were united against us

and famine had struck turning everyone as lean and slender who stood

against us, the clouds also cut our hopes for rains and we are thirsty
for

the rains from water filled clouds and You are aware of all the troubles

and a hope for all requests our faith in You cries to You when people

have lost hopes, and clouds have dispersed and the lives are destroyed.

O the living and self-existing, trees, stars, rows after rows of angels,
and

the stationed group of clouds questions You, do not return us

unsuccessful, do not account for our deeds, do not punish us for our

sins, and spread the clouds by Your mercy which are full of water and

are clearly seen, and oblige the creatures by growing various fruits and

flowers and after blooming of flowers buds make the civilization alive,

and call to witness Your Honoured angels, the rains should be such that

it is beneficial, create greenery, bring pleasure, and bringing life,
and

prosperity with abundance forever, with big drops, which gives birth to

pure farms with extended stem, fresh and green, with branches spread

giving a good atmosphere with a vast illumination which is not without

the rains nor there remains any white piece without rains, nor any drop

which passes by it light and cold and is not beneficial for man. Your
light

drops intoxicate, Your dead civilization comes to life, the scattered

sustenance gathers at one place, Your treasures of bounties are

manifested so that it reaches to all of Your creation who are perfect.
So

much so that it reaches the famine covered area and those dead by the

circumstances comes back to life and the lakes and dams overflow, and

the peak of hills turn green and the green plants slant growing

abundantly, our farms turn green and fresh stream flows from dry areas,

our near and far areas turn green, our fruits grow heavy, our cattle

enliven and those settled away are satiated and our villagers become

strong and best obligation of all the obligation and the greatest
bounties

among all on those creatures upon whom dust pours and from the fear

of those animals who roam freely to those animals who are useful. O

Allah! Send such rains that the earth becomes wet and continues to

pour and make us contented with those clouds which bring forth heavy

rains which is helpful, grants greenery and freshness its big drops,

benefits, faster, smoky, dark and heavy rains, that the dry things are

satiated and wasted things becomes useful once again, and those to be

born are ready. O Allah! Fill us with Your bounties, and favour us with

the blessings of the beneficial clouds which brings water in darkness

and gloom which put cover upon cover and shine upon shine

continuously and clouds spread over and do not make the swords of

chillness and its lightening and its water, mud and stones. O Allah!
Save

us from polytheism and its wrath, oppression and its destruction,
poverty

and its consequences. O the one to make goodness reach its

destination, and the one to send grace to the treasurers one of the

beneficial bounty is rains. You are the listener of the complaints, we
are

sinners and You are the one from whom repentance is sought and You

forgive, We seek pardon from You. O the Merciful of all the mercifuls.

We ask You to forgive us for the sins due to ignorance and seek Your

pardon for our mistakes. O Allah! Our mountains have dried and our

earth has become dust and the animals have turned mad and are

standing in their stables and are crying so loudly as if a mother cries
on

the death of her teenager son, they are tired of roaming in the barren

pasture ground and seeing the dry water wells because they have not

received a drop of rain. Now their bones have rotten. The fats in their

bodies have melted and the milk has also dried. O Allah! Have mercy on

the one who is moaning and the restless because our hopes are on

You, and we have to return to You, therefore do not discontinue the

rains on us, as You are aware of our secrets, and do not call to us for

accounting those deeds, which has been done by our fools. "Because

You bring down the rains even when people have lost hope completely

and You spread Your mercy and You are the guardian and worth the

praise.
