<p>His supplication for achieving martyrdom in</p>  
<p>the way of Allah</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! You have shown a way out of many ways and have approved</p>  
<p>of it. Have called Your pious people on it, and have termed it as a best</p>  
<p>way which is beneficial for us and is a door of Your forgiveness and a</p>  
<p>way of acceptance, then on that path the soul of the believers will be</p>  
<p>purchased and Heaven will be their compensation, these will be the</p>  
<p>people who wage a Holy War, are killed and Your promise is truth which</p>  
<p>is mentioned in Torah, Bible and the Quran. Therefore include me</p>  
<p>among those who sell their souls to You and whatever transactions they</p>  
<p>do, they fulfill it, without turning their faces or doing any changes in it</p>  
<p>and it is only adhering to Your promise, and have done to achieve Your</p>  
<p>love and nearness. Send blessings on Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
<p>and his progeny and make him a supplement for my deeds and for You</p>  
<p>a witness of belief in Your oneness. I do it in such a way that it becomes</p>  
<p>a source of Your pleasure and a way for pardoning my sins. And grant</p>  
<p>me the position of those living, who have succeeded. With the banner of</p>  
<p>truth fighting against Your oppressors and tyrants, with firm steps and</p>  
<p>have never expressed doubts, and I seek refuge from that which erases</p>  
<p>good deeds.</p>
