<p>His supplication for the eighth of the month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O God! Praise be to You equal to the number of trees and leaves,</p>  
<p>Praise equal to the number of pebbles and stones and hair. Praise be to</p>  
<p>You as numerous as the number of days of this world and the world</p>  
<p>Hereafter. Praise be to You equal to the number of stars of the Heaven</p>  
<p>and praise be to You equal to the number of the drops of rain and those</p>  
<p>of ocean water. Praise be to You equal to the number of things You</p>  
<p>created. Praise be to You equal to the population of Your Arsh. Praise</p>  
<p>be to You equal to the number of Your words. Praise be to You till Your</p>  
<p>pleasure is achieved. Praise be to You equal to the number of things</p>  
<p>Your knowledge encompasses. Praise be to You equal to the number of</p>  
<p>things You have taken account of. Praise be to You for all the things</p>  
<p>Your sight has circumspected. Praise be to You for things to which Your</p>  
<p>sublimity has reached. Praise be to You for the things Your mercy has</p>  
<p>enveloped. Praise be to You for things the treasure of which is within</p>  
<p>Your control. Praise be to You for the things included in Your Book.</p>  
<p>Praise be to You, persistent, everlasting and endless. Praise so much</p>  
<p>so, that Your creatures cannot assess it. O Allah! Praise be to You</p>  
<p>equal to the number of times one might have invoked You and the</p>  
<p>prayers were granted. Praise be to You for all Your attributes and for all</p>  
<p>Your bounties whether secret or open, first or last and manifest or</p>  
<p>hidden. Praise be to You for what was and what is not and what is going</p>  
<p>to be. Praise be to You innumerable, in the manner Your countless</p>  
<p>bounties bestowed on us. O Allah! O Lord! All praise are for You. The</p>  
<p>entire realm belongs to You. Within Your control is all good. To You is</p>  
<p>the return of everything hidden or manifest. Praise be to You on Your</p>  
<p>trials, on Your favours, whether present or past; particularly those</p>  
<p>shown towards me by gifting existence and guiding me to the right path</p>  
<p>for You have created a good creation and gave me the best guidance</p>  
<p>and You taught and taught me the best. O Allah! Praise be to You for</p>  
<p>Your testing me by gracious trial and for Your favours shown to me.</p>  
<p>Many a hardship You have dispelled from me, many a grief You have</p>  
<p>warded off and many a difficulty You have solved and granted me ease.</p>  
<p>Praise be to You for Your bounties, some of them I have forgotten, for</p>  
<p>some I have offered my thanks to You others not even acknowledged by</p>  
<p>me, some of them have already passed and some still remain. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Praise be to You equal to the number of times You have granted</p>  
<p>pardons and salvation and praise be to You the number of times You</p>  
<p>have given cover to my lapses. Praise be to You as numerous as the</p>  
<p>number of Your blessings and favours. Praise be to You for setting my</p>  
<p>affairs in order and for testing us in a gracious manner. O Allah! Praise</p>  
<p>be to You for You really deserve to be praised and worshipped and</p>  
<p>thanked, O the best of all those that are Praiseworthy! O the most</p>  
<p>Merciful!</p>
