<p>(159)</p>  
<p>His Supplication for Wednesday</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Praise is for Allah Who is pleased with the one who invokes Him and</p>  
<p>who supplicates to Him and in realizing his stubbornness His wrath is</p>  
<p>concealed. Pure is Allah Who is aware of every whisper due to His</p>  
<p>knowledge and is different from all the creatures possessing a body.</p>  
<p>There is no Lord except Allah. He cannot be seen by imagination or with</p>  
<p>eyes, and cannot be denied due to intellect and reason. Nor He can be</p>  
<p>created by the heart. He is aware of the indication of eyes and the</p>  
<p>secrets of the hearts and Allah is too great and Majestic Who is aware of</p>  
<p>the Qualities of the creation and is aware of the secrets of the entire</p>  
<p>Universe. O Allah! I seek from You like the one who does not fear his</p>  
<p>lord while asking from Him, and I beseech You like the one who is</p>  
<p>drowned in calamities and desires to come out of them. And I call upon</p>  
<p>You, so restlessly as the one who is repenting on his sins and errors.</p>  
<p>And You are the most merciful, Lord of the entire creation, creating</p>  
<p>various creatures by Your Will. You have fixed their life span and their</p>  
<p>sustenance creating of a creature is not difficult for You and designed</p>  
<p>them as You desired. You are above everything so as not to be</p>  
<p>dependant on anything, or that a partner be ascribed to You. We cannot</p>  
<p>see You with eyes, no false belief can reach up to You, and You have</p>  
<p>no partners, no opposite and no equal. You are one, alone and eternal.</p>  
<p>You are the first, the last, the Knower, unconcerned and the everlasting,</p>  
<p>You are not a son of anyone and no one is Your son. None is like You</p>  
<p>and no one can understand You by praising or by imagination. No time,</p>  
<p>no rotation of the earth can change You. You were Eternal and will</p>  
<p>remain everlasting till end. You know what is concealed. Your</p>  
<p>knowledge is same as for the apparent thing. O the one! O the one in</p>  
<p>comparsion of Whose greatness the greatest personalities are nothing.</p>  
<p>And before Whose might the mighty people are helpless. The words of</p>  
<p>the litterateurs fail to reach His Being. The One Who has fixed the</p>  
<p>course of action of everything. And the writings of the eloquent ones fail</p>  
<p>to express His realities. O my Master! Would You punish me with the fire</p>  
<p>while You are my aspiration? Or would You appoint the Hell Fire on me</p>  
<p>while I confess to Your Oneness? And I humble myself to express my</p>  
<p>helplessness and lowliness before you. Or my tongue would be</p>  
<p>stammering at the time of the accounting while it were You Who had</p>  
<p>forged the paths of Your glorification, praise and extolling. O Helper of</p>  
<p>seekers, O Protector of frightened people who seek protection, of</p>  
<p>frightened people who seek protection, O comforter to remove the sorry</p>  
<p>state of afflicted persons. O cherisher, of learned people and O greatest</p>  
<p>of all, O merciful, O my Lord, bless Muhammad Mustafa (s.a.w.a.) and</p>  
<p>his progeny. Accept my repentance give me good health and do favour</p>  
<p>for my livelihood and place me among the pious people. O Allah! You</p>  
<p>considered me as a sinner, I cry for mercy and quote for the sake of</p>  
<p>Your grace and honourable places and Your grandeur and magnificence</p>  
<p>that no one can oppose You. O Allah, send Your blessings on</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) Mustafa and his progeny. O My Lord, make me</p>  
<p>fortunate because all matters are in Your possession. You are giving</p>  
<p>Your protection as there is no one except You who can give protection.</p>  
<p>You have power over all things. You are Merciful and Knower of all</p>  
<p>things. You know what is in my heart but I am not aware what is in your</p>  
<p>heart. Of course You know all secrets very well. Bestow Your favour on</p>  
<p>me, as You always bestowed Your blessings on whom who showed high</p>  
<p>handedness. Do favour on me as You obliged on them who were lost in</p>  
<p>an ocean of errors and their errors caused them to die. O the One Who</p>  
<p>is forgiving to the sinners, forgive and overlook my sins. Because You</p>  
<p>always do favour on the sinners, and You have always dealt with mercy</p>  
<p>those who stumble over sins and those who have dared to defy Your</p>  
<p>commands and became eligible for Hell. O the One Who is aware of the</p>  
<p>secrets, O the Overpowering and the Powerful. O my Master! You</p>  
<p>Yourself fulfill the rights of the parents and siblings that You have made</p>  
<p>incumbent upon me. Please transfer this responsibility of mine on</p>  
<p>Yourself, O the One possessing grace and majesty. Forgive the</p>  
<p>believing men and women; indeed You are powerful over everything.</p>
