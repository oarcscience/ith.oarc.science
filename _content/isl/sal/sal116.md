\(115\)

His supplication at the times of going to bed

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

In the name of Allah I put my side on the bed. I am on the religion of

Ibrahim and Muhammad peace be on him and his progeny whose

obedience is made obligatory upon us. Whatever Allah wills, happens

and whatever He doesn’t will, never happens.
