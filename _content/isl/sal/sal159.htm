<p>(158)</p>  
<p>His Supplication for Tuesday</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Praise is for Allah Who granted His recognition and made me firm in</p>  
<p>sincerity by the belief in His Oneness. Do not include me among the</p>  
<p>astrayed ones, nor ignorant ones, nor the polytheists, nor among those</p>  
<p>whom the Satan has overpowered and deviated and has made him far</p>  
<p>away from his destination, and the one who made his desires, his lord.</p>  
<p>And pure is Allah Who hears the cries of the restless and whom the</p>  
<p>harm has afflicted and He knows the secrets, the Lord of the good and</p>  
<p>evil and there is no Lord except Allah that when His creature sins, He</p>  
<p>overlooks it, and sympathetically hastens towards the one who calls Him</p>  
<p>and Allah is Great and Exalted. His kingdom is vast, His partner</p>  
<p>non-existent, His throne is worth praise, and His Wrath severe. O My</p>  
<p>Lord! I invoke You as the one, who has not found anyone better than</p>  
<p>You, to grant his desires and have confidence in You as the one who</p>  
<p>has not found anyone better than You to confide in, because You are</p>  
<p>the One Who has initiated the beginning, and have brought it in</p>  
<p>existence and it came into being by Your command in the destined limit.</p>  
<p>And You are far Great and Majestic that by looking at Your signs, the</p>  
<p>intellect can comprehend You. And You are so much aware that nothing</p>  
<p>from the Heavens and the earth is hidden from You, only You are</p>  
<p>Generous Who does not stop the bestowals due to continuous plea of</p>  
<p>the seekers. Your order for the creatures is that You wish and it</p>  
<p>materializes. Your order is enforced, Your promise is certain, Your</p>  
<p>decision is Just, nothing is hidden from You, everything will return to</p>  
<p>You. You are concealed in the veils of Your bounties, that You are not</p>  
<p>seen, but is present in solitude, You are the greatest of all, Unique in</p>  
<p>Magnificence and overpowering due to life and power. You are praised</p>  
<p>in this World as well as in the Hereafter. And Your thanks in the</p>  
<p>beginning and the end. O my Lord! You are forbearing and Powerful,</p>  
<p>Merciful and forgiving, a true master, the subduer, the sustainer, a</p>  
<p>matchless creator, the acceptor of supplications, and the one Who hears</p>  
<p>it, the destiny of the far off scattered people is in Your power and</p>  
<p>strength. The Ever living, the Self Existing, the Munificent, the Glorious,</p>  
<p>the Kind, the Merciful, O my Lord You are such a Creator that You are</p>  
<p>king of all the kings. The head is bowed down in front of the Great fear.</p>  
<p>Our Holy people are punctual in Your obedience, and due to Your</p>  
<p>Holiness, You are a possessor of greatness and Praise. The custody of</p>  
<p>Your Creatures is not expensive for You and the bestowal of the</p>  
<p>bounties on Your creatures does not decrease it. You are knower of the</p>  
<p>Unseen, You have covered my defects and You are aware of the</p>  
<p>amount of my sins. And You have blessed me with the love of Your</p>  
<p>religion. O the merciful do not remove the cover from me (my sins) and</p>  
<p>O the bestower of favours, do not degrade me, I pray to You to bestow</p>  
<p>blessings upon Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and by Your</p>  
<p>Grace increase my sustenance the pure and Holy. Forgive my sins,</p>  
<p>which prove as a barrier between You and me, as You are only capable</p>  
<p>to be Merciful towards me by Your Mercy and save me from Your severe</p>  
<p>chastisement, and place me among Your Honourable creatures. O my</p>  
<p>Lord put me among those pious souls whom the angles carry in the state</p>  
<p>of purity, and say "Peace be on You" go and enter Heaven in exchange</p>  
<p>of Your good deeds. O the Clement O the Rich for the sake of Your</p>  
<p>Beneficence and Mercy I beseech You to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
<p>and his progeny and make me handle the rights of my mother and father</p>  
<p>and fulfill their obligations on my behalf and divide me with them and my</p>  
<p>brothers and sisters and put me and the believing man male and</p>  
<p>females among the doers of good. Forgive me and all those with me,</p>  
<p>indeed You are worth the praise and deserve the greatness. Bestow</p>  
<p>Your Mercy on our Prophet and on all his family.</p>
