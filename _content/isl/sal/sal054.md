His supplication in asking for needs and

attaining Proximity to Allah

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

I am linked with such a bond with Allah, there is no god but Him. He is

the one to give life to the dead and is their inheritor. I hold the robe
of

such a Majestic Allah Who neither begets, Who looks after creatures

and is their custodian. I seek proximity to Allah Who does not have a

partner and he told the earth and the skies to be prepared for His

commands either willingly or unwillingly; both replied we are ready

willingly. I seek protection from Allah Who does not have a partner Who

is neither lazy nor sleeps. I seek nearness to Allah Who does not have a

partner. He is Beneficent Who rules in the skies Who is aware of the

action of the eyes and the secrets of the hearts. I seek refuge in Allah

Who does not have a partner and is aware of things in the Heavens and

the Earth and the things in between them and also that which is below

the crust of the earth. I seek protection from Allah Who does not have a

partner Who sees everyone but is not seen by anyone although He is at

a place of manifestation from the beginning to the end. I seek nearness

from Allah Who does not have a partner and in front of Whose Majesty

everything bow their head. I seek proximity to Allah Who does not have

a partner Who in spite of being near is on the great heights and

although being on great heights is near and is Powerful. I seek nearness

to Allah Who does not have a partner Whose power cannot be

described by tongues. I seek refuge in Allah Who does not have a

partner Who is living and eternal Who neither doses nor sleeps. I seek

nearness to Allah Who does not have a partner. He is extremely

beneficent and an obliger beyond measure; possessor of Grandeur and

Majesty. I seek proximity to Allah Who does not have a partner and is

self-sufficient that neither begets nor is begotten and there is no one
like

Him. I seek refuge in Allah Who does not have a partner; all the

goodness is in His control and He has power over all things. I seek

closeness to Allah Who does not have a partner. Everything in the

Heavens and Earth glorify Him and everything is obedient to Him. I seek

proximity to Allah Who has no partner. He is Living and Wise, the

Hearing, the Knowing, the Beneficent, the Merciful. I seek closeness to

Allah Who does not have a partner. I rely on Him Who is the possessor

of the heavens. I begin in the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the
Merciful.

O Allah I ask from You, although You are well aware of my desires, I

seek from You whereas You know my wants. I have turned to You and

You are aware of my defects. O the one Who raises the skies, O the

averter of troubles, O the refuge of needy, O the one to fulfill the

desires. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), the seal of the Prophets, and his

pure progeny. O Allah forgive my sins and all those things which You

are aware of more than me. O Allah forgive those sins which I have

committed knowingly or in ignorance, in happiness or in sorrow,

purposely or unintentionally. O Allah! Forgive my sins which I have

committed or which I will commit in future in private or in public.
Forgive

them as You are the first and the last and You have power over all

things. O Allah, if You pardon me, pardon me completely because who is

that creature who has never committed a sin?
