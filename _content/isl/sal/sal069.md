\(68\)

His supplication for averting the trap of the

enemies

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah I seek refuge from You that no one from Your kingdom

oppresses me. O Allah I seek refuge from the eventuality that in spite
of

Your guidance I should deviate. O Allah I seek nearness with You that in

spite of Your safety I be ruined. O Allah I seek closeness to You that I
be

firm and stable in Your domain when the law and order is Yours and it is

Your Power and strength.
