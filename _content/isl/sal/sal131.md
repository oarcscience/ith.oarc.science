His supplication for the seventh of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Praise be to You such that it’s beginning is unknown, it may
not

end at any stage and it does not fall short of the limits of Your
Throne.

Praise be to You such that it may not remain concealed from You and

fail to reach You and invoke Your pleasure. All praise be to Allah for

Whose command there is obedience and the disobedience in not

without His knowledge. All praise be to Allah Whose justice is
frightening

and praise be to Allah Whose benevolence is the sources of hope.

Praise be to Allah that those who obey Him receive His bounties, and

praise be to Allah that those who disobey have been forewarned. Praise

be to Allah that if He grants favour to anyone amongst His creatures, it
is

His blessing and if He punishes anyone, it is His justice. Praise be to

Allah that those near Him have no escape and those away from Him are

not far off. All praise be to Allah Who said words of praise about
Himself

and ordered that world also to do so. Praise be to Allah Who

commenced His book with praise, made it the concluding prayers of the

dwellers of Heaven and ended His decisions on it. Praise be to Allah,

praise which has been since eternity and will remain till eternity, Who
is

the forerunner of everything, before Whom there was no room for

anything to exist, Who is that First before Whom nothing existed and
that

Last after which nothing could survive. He is such Eternal that has

neither end nor mortality. All praise be to Allah the dignity of Whose

attributes cannot be perceived even by imagination, the human wisdom

is defeated in reaching the height of His greatness, except in the way
He

Himself has praised the qualities of His Might, Generosity and

Benevolence. Praise be to Allah Who made the sky a barrier for the

Wind, spread the Earth on water and chose for Himself dignified

beautiful names. Praise be to Allah Who is One without similitude, Who

keeps Himself informed of everything without any media, Who is Eternal

without any endeavour, Who is the Creator without any feeling of

weariness, Whose attributes are His Self and Who is universally known

but has not set limits. Praise be to Allah, Master of the seven skies,
of

the great Heavenly Throne, of the messengers and the Prophets, of the

firsts and the lasts; Who is One alone and fully independent. He begets

not nor is He begotten and there is none like Him. He is the King of the

Kings by virtue of His own power, turned the Lords His slaves by his

own might and is the Lord of great people on account of His power. He

has created greatness and pride for His own Self and has reserved to

Himself Benevolence, Generosity and Excellence. He is the shelter, for

those seeking shelter, place of safety for the frightened, confidence
for

the believers and the centre for fulfilling the needs of those devoted
to

His worship. O my Lord! All praise be to You for all Your attributes
which

we know or know not. Praise be to You such that it be befitting what You

have bestowed on us and You shall bestow in future. Praise be to You

such that is greater that the praises of all Your creatures. Praise be
to

You such that can make me closer to Your pleasure and enable me to

offer my thanks, thereby making myself more deserving in Your Eyes. O

Allah! Praise be to You that You do not take notice of our sins despite

having knowledge and forgive despite having power to punish, O You

the most Forgiving and Most Merciful!
