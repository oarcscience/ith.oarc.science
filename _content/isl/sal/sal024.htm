<p>His Supplication expressing devotion to</p>  
<p>Allah</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah, shower blessings on Muhammad and his Progeny (s.a.w.a.) Be</p>  
<p>merciful when I pass away from the world or the people forget my</p>  
<p>memories or I am counted among those who are forgotten. O Allah, I</p>  
<p>have become old. My skin and bones have become weak and thin.</p>  
<p>People have acquired whatever I had and my youth has passed. Death</p>  
<p>has come near and my life is getting over, my desires have gone and</p>  
<p>only the results are remaining. O My Lord, have mercy on me when I will</p>  
<p>pass away from the world and my parts of the body will be broken and</p>  
<p>scattered. O My Lord, my sins have made me quiet and I have become</p>  
<p>dumb. Now I don't have any excuses or arguments. Now I confess my</p>  
<p>sins and bad deeds. I am guilty and misled from the right path. Allah</p>  
<p>send Your blessings on Muhammad and his Progeny (s.a.w.a.) and be</p>  
<p>merciful and forgive my sins. O my Lord, though my deeds are indiscrete</p>  
<p>against my obeying but my expectations are more than hopes. O Allah,</p>  
<p>why should I be disappointed? Though I am supposed to gain liberation</p>  
<p>by Your compassion. O Allah do not disappoint me from Your gracious</p>  
<p>presumption and do not prove to be wrong my true expectations among</p>  
<p>Your candidates. O My Lord! My sin is great because You will ask for an</p>  
<p>explanation but when I remember of my sins and see Your forgiveness I</p>  
<p>feel that You would forgive. If Your severe chastisement calls me</p>  
<p>towards hell because of my sins, my expectations of Your gracious</p>  
<p>presumption call me towards Paradise. If my errors threaten me and</p>  
<p>disappoints me from Your favour and grace, Your kindness encourages</p>  
<p>my faith. O my Lord! If my carelessness misled me, my Lord! Your</p>  
<p>honourable bounties make me alert. O my Lord! My sense, my reforms,</p>  
<p>and my strength become helpless, but my faith has not vanished as</p>  
<p>Your gainful gratification is with me. If the days of my life have passed</p>  
<p>without efforts in Your way, at least and few years have passed with</p>  
<p>faith. O Allah! I am a plaintiff in Your court as a needy and poor. The</p>  
<p>trouble of my hardship has made me helpless. O Allah! You are</p>  
<p>honourable! Make me succeed because I am one of Your petitioners. Do</p>  
<p>favour on me and count me with those who benefit from You. O My</p>  
<p>Lord! No one can turn out my poverty except You and no one can fulfill</p>  
<p>my desires without Your reward. O My Lord! I am standing as a beggar</p>  
<p>at the door of Your generosity. I have abandoned asking others. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Bestow Your blessings to the petitioner. As I am in one of the dangerous</p>  
<p>points. I am involved in the trial of deeds and standard. I shall perish if</p>  
<p>You do not help me. O My Lord! Have You created me like an</p>  
<p>unfortunate one to cry? Or ask my wants from the fortunate ones? O My</p>  
<p>Lord! If You debarred from the Paradise to visit Muhammad Mustafa</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and prevent Angels of Darussalam (heaven) round about on</p>  
<p>me for the service and turn out my desires unsuccessful in the world.</p>  
<p>Whatever hopes I have from You is quite different from it. O Excellence!</p>  
<p>I swear of Your respect and glory, if You keep me bound and away from</p>  
<p>Your blessings and keep me aloof from the respectable persons I shall</p>  
<p>not leave my hopes from You. I shall await for Your blessings. O Allah, I</p>  
<p>would not be rightly guided without Your guidance. I cannot accept a</p>  
<p>faith if You wouldn't guide me I would not call You if You would not have</p>  
<p>given the power to speak. I would not recognize You if You had not</p>  
<p>forgiven with friendly attitudes. I would not ask for shelter if You would</p>  
<p>not mention about the wrath. O Allah, I carry out Your orders and it is</p>  
<p>monotheism and if I disobey Your orders it is infidelity. So pardon both.</p>  
<p>O my Lord! I like Your obedience if I would be neglected or do mistake</p>  
<p>purposely, for that bestow me the heaven, though I am not a righteous</p>  
<p>person for the heaven and save me from the hell because I am not fit for</p>  
<p>it. O my Lord! Though my sins have prevented me to go ahead from the</p>  
<p>virtuous people but my faith has made me stand on the point of good</p>  
<p>deeds. O My Lord! The heart, which You have filled by love, then how</p>  
<p>can the flames of fire of hell overpower it? O Allah! How can You</p>  
<p>disgrace in hellfire the soul satisfied with faith? O Allah, how can You</p>  
<p>burn in the blazing fire the tongue which recites Your name? O My Lord!</p>  
<p>All disaster affected persons request You; All grief-stricken people seek</p>  
<p>protection from You, O my Lord! The pious people heard about the great</p>  
<p>rewards they bring down their heads down in humility and ascetic</p>  
<p>people heard about Your extant blessings and became contented. And</p>  
<p>the misled people heard about Your generosity they turn back again.</p>  
<p>The culprits heard about Your great extent of forgiveness, they became</p>  
<p>hopeful. The believers heard about Your reward of forgiveness they</p>  
<p>became seeker. O My Lord! The Group of unbelievers gathered and</p>  
<p>prayed loudly. These people are in the world and all people live by hope</p>  
<p>alone. They have showed the feelings of their mind. They have no fear</p>  
<p>of any obstacle and are restless and You are the centre of them that</p>  
<p>seekers are not dishonoured and insulted in Your court. O Allah! If I</p>  
<p>have made a mistake to consider for myself that there is safety and</p>  
<p>honour after the request, I would surely get the right path. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Perhaps this time I have become fortunate after getting Your help, and I</p>  
<p>hope You will forgive me. O Allah! If my effort of getting benefit left me</p>  
<p>but Your gracefulness have not become separate. O My Lord! If I gave</p>  
<p>decision for me in which I had hopes I fulfilled my duties to bring it near</p>  
<p>by Your grace and blessings. O My Lord! The lack of preparation for</p>  
<p>hereafter stopped me to be present in Your court, so I have sent my</p>  
<p>precious feelings to You with faith and trust. O my Lord whenever I</p>  
<p>remember Your blessings, my face shines and when I remember of Your</p>  
<p>wrath I cry with fear. O my Lord! Do favour on this miserable person,</p>  
<p>who is thirsty and whose veins of the neck bow down by tiredness. O my</p>  
<p>Lord! I pray like one who does not expect from anyone except You. I</p>  
<p>depend on You that my hopes cannot turn towards anyone except You.</p>  
<p>O My Lord! One who says seeing Your bounties that why should I return</p>  
<p>back and I am dependent on You to get my livelihood. O Allah! How can</p>  
<p>I reticent my tongue to request You. As I am very restless for the result</p>  
<p>of hereafter. O My Lord! You are aware of my expectation and You have</p>  
<p>promised to provide livelihood in the life. And You are aware that after</p>  
<p>my death I am not contented of heaven. O Your personality is so great,</p>  
<p>that You showed Your mercy by Your favour. Do not disappoint me of</p>  
<p>Your favour on the Day of Judgment when I would be badly in need of it.</p>  
<p>The observation of the blessings of Generous and His Generosity are</p>  
<p>completed if I would not be ignored of my matters I would not take false</p>  
<p>step and if I would consider of my transgression of limits I would not cry.</p>  
<p>O My Lord! Send Your blessing on Prophet, Muhammad Mustafa and</p>  
<p>his progeny (s.a.w.a.) and erase the documents of taking false steps in</p>  
<p>the course of time. For the sake of my running tears, forgive my great</p>  
<p>sins forgive them for the sake of my minor good deeds. O Allah if You</p>  
<p>are not merciful on anyone except the obedient people, where would</p>  
<p>they go and complain for their mistakes? If You do not accept a</p>  
<p>suggestion of anyone except the hard workers, then where would the</p>  
<p>wrongdoer go for their request? If You respect only the elegance people,</p>  
<p>then what would the sinful people do? If no one can be successful</p>  
<p>except the pious people in hereafter, then to whom should we ask for</p>  
<p>help? O My Lord! One who he can pass from extremely narrow bridge</p>  
<p>which is the pathway of Paradise and whose good deeds are permitted,</p>  
<p>then how will they cross the way who have not repented before death?</p>  
<p>O My Lord! You show Your favour only to those who have submitted</p>  
<p>their whole life in pious devotion, then who will be helpful to this sinful</p>  
<p>person, who has not become happy though he tried hard. O Allah! If You</p>  
<p>don't care to look at a monotheist because he is a sinner and You will</p>  
<p>put him in difficulty by Your curse? If You do not help us by Your</p>  
<p>gratitude, we would be mixed up along with those who associate with</p>  
<p>You. O Allah! For the sake of Islam, make us righteous of Your</p>  
<p>endowments and forgive our sinful manners which make Your clean</p>  
<p>bestowals dirty, cleanse them. O My Lord! Take pity on our miserable</p>  
<p>condition when we would be buried in the grave and our grave will be</p>  
<p>packed by bricks and we would be laid down by the right side in the</p>  
<p>grave and the people leave us alone in the narrow resting place and our</p>  
<p>death will settle us in a strange place and we would be surrounded in</p>  
<p>the crowd of the dead. Though they would be uninhabited. O my God,</p>  
<p>be Merciful at that time, when we would be bare-footed and naked and</p>  
<p>the dust of the grave covers our head and our eyes would be wide open</p>  
<p>with the fear of the day of reckoning and our lips dried in thirst, and our</p>  
<p>stomach, hungry due to the long wait. And if on the Day of Judgment if</p>  
<p>none can be successful except the pious people, we would be</p>  
<p>absolutely naked before the people. Our backs shall be heavy with our</p>  
<p>load. We shall be involved in the calamities created by our kith and kin.</p>  
<p>You do not add to my problems by turning away Your kind attention from</p>  
<p>us, and by keeping us away from Your Mercy that we have visualized. O</p>  
<p>my Lord! These eyes are not attentive to their tears for nothing, nor this</p>  
<p>sinner is weeping aimlessly, nor it has wept like an emotional woman for</p>  
<p>nothing. The reason is that he has already committed sins intentionally</p>  
<p>and unintentionally. Now the consequences of his examination are</p>  
<p>calling him. And O, the Owner of Might, You are capable of removing his</p>  
<p>misery. O my God! If we sinners are weeping because of our</p>  
<p>shortcomings in paying homage to You, and if we are failures, we are</p>  
<p>weeping due to the lack of Mercy that we beg from You. O my God!</p>  
<p>Increase the eloquence of the sweetness of my expression so that it may</p>  
<p>guide our heart towards piety in the light of the matters it understands. O</p>  
<p>my God! You have commanded to do good and Yourself are the best of</p>  
<p>the good-doers and You have issued the orders to ask You for our</p>  
<p>needs while You are the best of those who are asked. O my God! How</p>  
<p>can despair prevent us from asking that we are accustomed to beg.</p>  
<p>Moreover, we have reposed high hopes in You. O Allah! When the</p>  
<p>storm of terror shakes the leaves of our fear, those trees get uprooted,</p>  
<p>and when the breeze of our attachments touch the branches of our</p>  
<p>desires, its fruits ripen due to the glad tidings. When Your epithet, &#147;the</p>  
<p>severest of those who requite&#148; comes on our lips, we feel extreme</p>  
<p>sorrow and remorse and when we recite: O The Concealer of Faults,</p>  
<p>The Compassionate, we become very happy. Now we are in the middle</p>  
<p>of fear and hope. Fear does not make us satisfied and Your divine</p>  
<p>favour does not disappoint us. O Allah! Our efforts fail to cast off from</p>  
<p>Your favour and keep me safe from Your wrath. O Allah! You always</p>  
<p>send Your blessing as a gift and has made me respectable in the world.</p>  
<p>And You always helped and showed Your elegant attitude to the</p>  
<p>notorious and disgraceful people. The past centuries, promises of past</p>  
<p>times and termination in the course of time in remaining nights. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Our life is depending on whatever is necessary in life, increase them</p>  
<p>through the medium of Your blessings. How could our heart be happy by</p>  
<p>the worldly desires? How could our dealings be formal in worldly</p>  
<p>trouble? How could our happiness be ruined and how could our deceits</p>  
<p>prevent from absurdity and useless talk. Though our graves inform us</p>  
<p>that death is coming near. O My Lord! How could we find the way when</p>  
<p>pits are ready for us to make us sleep and the strings of treacherous</p>  
<p>world has been distributed by the hands of death and made us helpless</p>  
<p>and made us drink bitter drought of water. Our soul has been informed</p>  
<p>us that the life would be terminated. I wish that I would not distant about</p>  
<p>the worldly comforts and would not take a false step O My Lord! I pray to</p>  
<p>You earnestly to help me to pass across the bridge and request You to</p>  
<p>save us from the false desires and request You to raise the curtains of</p>  
<p>confusion from the heart and save me from the wrong and uncivilized</p>  
<p>intentions of the mind. O My Lord! Do the houses have strength to save</p>  
<p>from the attack of troubles? When one of the arrows of death falls in</p>  
<p>every house. O Allah! If our heart would not fear while shifting from the</p>  
<p>world or if You would not keep us aloof from the virtuous people there. O</p>  
<p>Allah! If You keep us near to You, then separation of our brothers and</p>  
<p>other relatives will not harm us. O Allah the Bestower! Veins of our</p>  
<p>throat and tongues would not dry up if unnatural offence would not turn</p>  
<p>round and round like birds. O Allah! I was an obedient person and You</p>  
<p>had created me to obey Your commands. You cursed me and kept me</p>  
<p>away from Your bounties because of my bad deeds. And if You show</p>  
<p>mercy on me, whenever I was obedient to You but You found me guilty</p>  
<p>and made me free. O My Lord! There is no way to be saved from evils</p>  
<p>without Your protection. There is no source to reach up to the good</p>  
<p>deeds except Your will. Now after Your previous will I shall try to take</p>  
<p>advantage of my deeds so I can protect myself from sins and for that if</p>  
<p>You would not help me. O My Lord! I did not know anything but when</p>  
<p>You gave the guidance for the heaven and after knowing about that my</p>  
<p>heart turned towards it. Is that so that after turning towards the good</p>  
<p>deeds, You would disappoint me? Though You do what You like and it</p>  
<p>is praiseworthy. O Allah! The Lord of Majesty and Generosity! If I do not</p>  
<p>deserve Your blessing then do a favour. It is Your capability because the</p>  
<p>Generous never blesses only the deserving ones. O my God! If I am not</p>  
<p>deserving of Your mercies that I hope from You but You are the One to</p>  
<p>bestow favours upon the sinful ones. O Allah! If my sins frighten me, do</p>  
<p>favour on me due to Your great personality and my hopes turn out to be</p>  
<p>pleasant. O My Lord! My request is not like that of common beggars</p>  
<p>because if they are unsuccessful they give up begging and I do not feel</p>  
<p>ashamed to ask for my request at any cost. O my Lord! Be pleased with</p>  
<p>me. Sometimes the master forgives his slave for his error. O my Lord!</p>  
<p>How can I say, I am a great sinner and how can I be disappointed from</p>  
<p>You because You are generous and Merciful. O my Lord! My life and my</p>  
<p>soul are present before You and You cast a shadow of beauty on it. As</p>  
<p>You did what is suitable for You and hid me in Your rewards. If my death</p>  
<p>is near and if my deeds do not allow me to come to You then I have also</p>  
<p>decided to confess my sin again and again in Your court for forgiveness.</p>  
<p>O My Lord! You are the Forgiving. Who can be the other Forgiving</p>  
<p>except You and if You would punish me then who is the judge higher</p>  
<p>than You? O my Lord! If I show high-handedness for the defence of my</p>  
<p>soul and then also Your given limits continuing as before and even then</p>  
<p>if I do not hang my neck down then rebuke on my soul. O My Lord! You</p>  
<p>showed Your mercy on my whole life so do not discontinue Your</p>  
<p>kindness after my death. O Allah! Why should I be disappointed from</p>  
<p>Your favour after death? As You showed Your good favour in my life. O</p>  
<p>my Lord! My sins frightened me but my love towards You gave me</p>  
<p>protection. Help me as You are capable and take care of my ignorance.</p>  
<p>O Allah! Nothing is concealed for Your great personality. And send Your</p>  
<p>blessing on Your Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny. And</p>  
<p>forgive my sins, which are hidden from the sight of common people. O</p>  
<p>My Lord! You concealed my sins from me in the world and did not</p>  
<p>disclose them. As I deserve that my sins should not be disclosed in the</p>  
<p>hereafter. As You showed Your favour and concealed my sins before</p>  
<p>the Muslims. Do not disgrace me on the day of resurrection before the</p>  
<p>world. My hopes increased seeing Your generosity and You accepted</p>  
<p>my deeds. Make me cheerful when my death is near. O my Lord! My</p>  
<p>repentance is like that of a sinner, whose excuses are accepted. O</p>  
<p>Allah, The Great! The accused apologize and do not disgrace me for my</p>  
<p>only one wish for which I passed my whole life and that is Your</p>  
<p>forgiveness. O my Lord! If You would be desirous for my insult then You</p>  
<p>would not give the guidance or if You would like my infamy, You would</p>  
<p>not conceal my faults and for that You showed me the right path to get</p>  
<p>good benefit and whatever my sin You have concealed, keep it firm. O</p>  
<p>my Lord! In Your trial, I praise You for Your expected trial and mentioned</p>  
<p>Your elegance. This is the completion of Your forgiveness O Allah! If I</p>  
<p>would not fear of my sin then how would I be saved from Your wrath and</p>  
<p>would become a petitioner of Your reward? Your Personality is best from</p>  
<p>all virtuous people. You excuse the sinners and fulfill the desires of</p>  
<p>needy people who beg for Your mercy. O Allah, I hope, You will forgive</p>  
<p>me then let my desires succeed. I have heard about Your forgiveness so</p>  
<p>now fulfill all my desires and forgive my sins, which I have committed. O</p>  
<p>Allah! My virtues lay down before You and bad deeds are laid between</p>  
<p>forgive and forgiveness. I hope You will not cast off my good and bad</p>  
<p>deeds from Your favour. O Allah! My faith accepted Your oneness and I</p>  
<p>keep my tongue in utterance Your praise and the Holy Quran showed</p>  
<p>me the initiative of Your mercy then how can it be possible that I shall</p>  
<p>lose hope about Your promises? O Allah! Your coherent obligations</p>  
<p>guided me nicely and I became satisfied then how can You make a man</p>  
<p>unfortunate and villainous? O my Lord! If You have become very angry</p>  
<p>but I hope, Your kind attitude would save me from Your wrath O Allah! If</p>  
<p>my sins brought me forth for punishment my hopes also has come</p>  
<p>forward for reward. O Allah! Forgive me and bless me and save me from</p>  
<p>Your wrath. Your personality is such that none can expect anything</p>  
<p>except Your Grace and no fear of anything except Your final judgment.</p>  
<p>O Allah! Send blessing on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and</p>  
<p>do a favour on me and do not investigate more against me due to</p>  
<p>judgment. O My Lord! You have created my body and its parts and I pay</p>  
<p>homage with it and sometimes disobey orders and sometimes make You</p>  
<p>unhappy and sometimes happy and You granted me passion in my heart</p>  
<p>and chose me for this house which is full of disasters and then You said</p>  
<p>that I am prevented due to my sin. Now I beseech You for protection and</p>  
<p>support and want to protect myself from Your wrath and beseech good</p>  
<p>guidance for Your willingness. O my Lord! I ask You only as my question</p>  
<p>is not concealed from You. O my Lord! I beg You like a beggar and not</p>  
<p>feel ashamed to beg because You are my master and I beseech You as</p>  
<p>one who is agreed against his argument. If I knew of something more</p>  
<p>important the confession of sin, I would pray. O Allah, forgive my sin.</p>  
<p>After the confession do not make me fail. And his wishes have opened</p>  
<p>their mouths for Your Mercy, while they are not in need of kindness. O</p>  
<p>our Deity! Grant to them what they beg of You and bestow on them what</p>  
<p>they ask. Because You are the most merciful of those who are kind upon</p>  
<p>the ones that repose hopes in You. O Allah! I have committed such</p>  
<p>terrible sins that You are well aware of and the injustices I have</p>  
<p>committed upon myself are well known to You. Then You consider me</p>  
<p>as a slave emancipated by You or a disobedient one forgiven by You. O</p>  
<p>my Deity! O my Allah! I am thinking as if I have been made to lie down in</p>  
<p>my grave. The participants of my funeral have returned home after</p>  
<p>burying me. The travelers have already mourned my condition and the</p>  
<p>kind relatives have stopped weeping on me. And the friends have</p>  
<p>already finished reciting the Talqeen from besides the grave. And they</p>  
<p>were seeing this grave at that time. They are no more thoughtful of his</p>  
<p>needs. Neither did they witness his torture. The failure of his efforts</p>  
<p>were concealed by the soil (of the grave). Then You said - O My Angels!</p>  
<p>A man has arrived and his friends and relatives have gone away. He is</p>  
<p>all-alone and his friends and relatives have showed high-handedness.</p>  
<p>Now he has come to Me. He is lying without his inheritance in the grave.</p>  
<p>He was calling Me in the world. Now it is My duty to look after him. Now</p>  
<p>Allah will show His hospitality and He will be more kind than my friends</p>  
<p>and relatives. O Allah! If You stopped Your atmosphere between the</p>  
<p>earth and sky and split the stars or take me down deep under the</p>  
<p>ground due to my sins, I shall not give up my hopes for Your rewards.</p>  
<p>My disappointment cannot prevent me from seeking Your pleasure.</p>  
<p>O Allah! I have called You politely as per Your guidance. Now do not</p>  
<p>say it was Your promise. This was Your blessing that shows me the nice</p>  
<p>manners for supplication. Now it is the only way, fulfill my prayer and</p>  
<p>make me righteous and able for Your praise. O my Lord! I swear by Your</p>  
<p>honour and respect, my affection is vigilant in my heart for You and it is</p>  
<p>sweet. And Your beloved believers do not believe anyhow that You</p>  
<p>would hate them. O my Lord I am waiting for Your forgiveness like an</p>  
<p>accused and I am not disappointed from Your blessings and good</p>  
<p>deeds. O my Lord! Do not be angry with me. I have no courage to</p>  
<p>tolerate Your anger. And do not be displeased with me because I cannot</p>  
<p>tolerate it. O my Lord! Did my mother brought me up for hell? I wish if</p>  
<p>she had not brought me up. Had she gave birth to me for wretchedness?</p>  
<p>I wish she had not. O Allah! When I remember about my false step, tears</p>  
<p>flow from my eyes and why should I not cry? Though I don't know my</p>  
<p>last destination and I don't know when and where my journey would end.</p>  
<p>I even know my soul deceives me and my days deceive me and death is</p>  
<p>hovering on my head and staring at me from near. The caller's cry</p>  
<p>poisoned my ears. O Allah! I devoted my life to One Who bestows me</p>  
<p>good health. I hope You will not awake me naked among the dead. I</p>  
<p>hope You showed Your kindness in my life and recommend the same</p>  
<p>kindness at the time of my death. O the companion of every traveler,</p>  
<p>have pity on my journey of the grave. O the companion of every person</p>  
<p>in solitude, have mercy on my solitude in the grave. O one Who is aware</p>  
<p>of every secret, O one Who wards off every calamity and trouble, how</p>  
<p>would You deal with me in the habitations of the grave? And how much</p>  
<p>esteem You&#146;d have for me in the land of horror and calamities? You</p>  
<p>were very kind to me in my worldly life. O one Who showers the best of</p>  
<p>the bounties among all those who bestow bounties and one Who is the</p>  
<p>best of those Who do favours. O Allah! Your favours upon me are so</p>  
<p>numerous that I cannot count them and I am unable repay all of them by</p>  
<p>thanking for them. Praise for that You bestowed on me and thankfulness</p>  
<p>upon the way You have tested me. O one Who is better than the call of</p>  
<p>everyone who calls You and O, one Who is better than the hope of all</p>  
<p>those who hope. I have come to beg to You by the right of Islam and the</p>  
<p>sanctity of the Quran. And by the Sadaqah of the right of Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and Aale Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), I seek nearness to Your</p>  
<p>realm. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the Progeny of Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and grant Your attention to my duty of Your obedience. By</p>  
<p>which I harbour hopes in You. Please accept my entreaty O the most</p>  
<p>merciful of all the mercifuls.</p>
