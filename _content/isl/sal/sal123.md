\(122\)

His supplication for increasing faith

To be recited in open on three nights.

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I have understood that Your Knowledge is needless of question

and Your Generosity by description. You are my support and my cause

and my reliance is on You. Deal with me in a way You wish. O Allah I

have come in Your presence as an applicant, and a beggar for Your

obligations. Bestow on me such a grace from Your grace that I become

needless of others. O the one Who is known for His favours, O Allah!

Keep me in health till I am alive, and when I die forgive me by Your

favours. O the most Merciful of all the Mercifuls.
