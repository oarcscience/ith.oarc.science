<p>(122)</p>  
<p>His supplication for increasing faith</p>  
<p>To be recited in open on three nights.</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! I have understood that Your Knowledge is needless of question</p>  
<p>and Your Generosity by description. You are my support and my cause</p>  
<p>and my reliance is on You. Deal with me in a way You wish. O Allah I</p>  
<p>have come in Your presence as an applicant, and a beggar for Your</p>  
<p>obligations. Bestow on me such a grace from Your grace that I become</p>  
<p>needless of others. O the one Who is known for His favours, O Allah!</p>  
<p>Keep me in health till I am alive, and when I die forgive me by Your</p>  
<p>favours. O the most Merciful of all the Mercifuls.</p>
