His supplication for reforming his enemies

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Protect ours and theirs blood and reform their and our affairs

bring them out of deviation on a straight path, so that truth is

distinguished from falsehood and they are away from oppression and

ignorance.
