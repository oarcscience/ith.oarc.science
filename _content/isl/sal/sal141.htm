<p>be to Allah the Lord of seven Heavens and the seven Earths and things</p>  
<p>in them, between them, underneath them, the Lord of great heavenly</p>  
<p>Throne. And praise be to Allah! The Lord of the Worlds! I bear witness</p>  
<p>that there is no god save Allah, the One with no partner. For Him is the</p>  
<p>absolute Kingdom and for Him is all praise. He gives life and causes</p>  
<p>death. He is Ever-living, death touches Him not and under His control is</p>  
<p>all good. He is Powerful over everything. I bear witness that there is no</p>  
<p>god save Allah, the One with no associate, the One, Unique, Needless,</p>  
<p>Allah, with no spouse or a son and there is none like unto Him. I bear</p>  
<p>witness that there is no god save Allah, the only One with no associate.</p>  
<p>Bearing of such a witness I hope deliverance from Hell-fire. I bear</p>  
<p>witness that there is no god save Allah, the only One with no associate.</p>  
<p>Bearing of such a witness I hope entry to the Paradise. I bear witness</p>  
<p>that there is no god save Allah, the only One with no associate till the</p>  
<p>mountains stand firm after their destruction and even after that forever. I</p>  
<p>bear witness that there is no god save Allah, the only One with no</p>  
<p>associate till the soul remains in the body and after its departure</p>  
<p>therefrom and even after that forever. I bear witness under all</p>  
<p>circumstances forever, during health before, illness and after health that</p>  
<p>there is no deity but Allah, the One with no associate. I bear witness</p>  
<p>under all circumstances forever, during my youth before old age and</p>  
<p>during old age after youth that there is no god but Allah, the One with no</p>  
<p>associate. I bear witness under all circumstances forever, during the free</p>  
<p>period before the period of occupation and during the period of</p>  
<p>occupation after the free period that there is no god but Allah. I bear</p>  
<p>witness under all circumstances forever, during the performances by my</p>  
<p>hands and when there is no performance by my hands that there is no</p>  
<p>god but Allah, the One with no partner. I bear witness under all</p>  
<p>circumstances forever, during the period my ears heard and when they</p>  
<p>heard not anything that there is no god except Allah, the One with no</p>  
<p>associate. I bear witness under all circumstances forever; during the</p>  
<p>period my eyes saw when they saw not anything that there is no god but</p>  
<p>Allah, the One with no associate. I bear witness under all circumstances</p>  
<p>forever, during the period my tongue uttered anything and when it</p>  
<p>uttered not anything that there is no god but Allah, the One with no</p>  
<p>associate. I bear witness under all circumstances forever, during the</p>  
<p>period before my entry into the grave and during the period after my</p>  
<p>entry into the grave that there is no god but Allah, the One without</p>  
<p>associate. I bear witness during the night when it enshrouds and during</p>  
<p>the day when it shines that there is no god but Allah, the One with no</p>  
<p>associate. I bear witness in the Hereafter and in world that there is deity</p>  
<p>but Allah, the One with no associate. I bear witness that there is no deity</p>  
<p>but Allah, the One with no associate, a witness that may be my treasure</p>  
<p>of protection from the terror of the Day of Judgment. My witness that</p>  
<p>there is no god save Allah, the One without a partner, is a confession of</p>  
<p>Truth with all sincerity. The witness that there is no god but Allah, the</p>  
<p>One without an associate, is a witness also my ears, eyes, flesh, blood,</p>  
<p>hair, skin, nails, brain, bones, nerves and by everything my legs carry.</p>  
<p>With my witness that there is no god but Allah, the One with no</p>  
<p>associate, I hope from Allah at the departure of the soul from my body to</p>  
<p>keep my tongue perfect in its action of uttering words till my life ends</p>  
<p>with good deeds. Accept this invocation, O the Lord of the Worlds!</p>
