\(38\)

His supplication for every physical pain

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

I take refuge from the Honour of Allah, and His Power on all things. I

seek refuge by the Ruler of the heavens and the earth. I seek refuge for

myself by the name of Whom no moving creature of the earth and the

skies could harm. And I seek refuge from the One Whose name

increases bounties and bestows cure.
