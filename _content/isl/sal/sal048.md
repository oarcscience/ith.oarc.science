\(47\)

His supplication for those having moles

It should be recited till the last seven days of the month.

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

And the parable of an evil word is as an evil tree pulled up from the

earth’s surface; it has no stability. And the mountains shall be made to

crumble with (an awful) crumbling. So that they shall be as scattered

dust.
