<p>His supplication seeking refuge from Allah</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! You are my Lord and I am Your slave, I have brought faith in</p>  
<p>You. I am firm on Your covenant with sincerity, and after pledging my</p>  
<p>covenant to You I seek forgiveness for my sins. I seek forgiveness for</p>  
<p>those sins, which no one can forgive except You. My helplessness</p>  
<p>wishes to take refuge in Your Majesty and Honour. My poverty seeks</p>  
<p>refuge in Your self-sufficiency. My ignorance seeks refuge in Your</p>  
<p>tolerance and my laxity seeks refuge in Your Power. My fear seeks</p>  
<p>refuge in Your safety. My illness seeks refuge in Your cure. My death</p>  
<p>seeks refuge in Your judgment. My weakness seeks refuge in Your</p>  
<p>strength. My mortality seeks refuge in Your immortality. My extinction</p>  
<p>seeks refuge in Your eternality. O Allah! From Whom the darkness of</p>  
<p>the night is not concealed, nor the big sky is covered, neither the</p>  
<p>creatures living in the sea nor those living in the bottom of sea are</p>  
<p>hidden from You. O the one to nullify the strength and the one to waive</p>  
<p>the troubles. O the One to send bounties from the skies. I request You,</p>  
<p>O the one to open the ways, O the one Who rewards, O the possessor</p>  
<p>of the keys of the treasures. I request You to bless Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and his pure progeny. Grant me the goodness of the world</p>  
<p>and the Hereafter . Save me from the temptation, which has</p>  
<p>overpowered me and which can destroy me. Don't entrust me to</p>  
<p>somebody else even for a second, as he will be helpless of me, don't</p>  
<p>make me away from Heaven. Have mercy on me, let me die as a</p>  
<p>Muslim, and gather me together with pious people. Grant me pure</p>  
<p>sustenance and save me from forbidden. O the most merciful of all the</p>  
<p>mercifuls. O Allah! You have created the hearts and the minds for Your</p>  
<p>recognition, the heart beats due to Your fear, and the heart is restless</p>  
<p>due to Your love. The mind is weak for praising You and words are</p>  
<p>unable to describe Your wonders, the tongues are dumb to describe</p>  
<p>Your Praise and even if it praises You, understanding Your attributes</p>  
<p>silences it, and now it circles around it in amazement which You have</p>  
<p>established, as it is impossible for it to exceed Your limits, it is possible</p>  
<p>for him to praise in the limits of the boundary made by You and the</p>  
<p>tongues are the bounties bestowed by You. O Allah! You have a right</p>  
<p>upon all Your creatures whom You have created and they should not act</p>  
<p>niggardly and if this thankfulness is lesser than Your bounties they</p>  
<p>praise according to their strength and power, and one who is lacking in</p>  
<p>this depends on Your hopes, and those who fear You are accepting</p>  
<p>Your lordship. The seekers come near to You with hopes. Those who</p>  
<p>oblige are searching Your grace and all of them are busy in the shade of</p>  
<p>Your Mercy and Forgiveness. Due to Your fear, degradation has</p>  
<p>weakened them, they confess of not being thankful to Your bounties.</p>  
<p>Those who were disobedient and did not follow Your commands their</p>  
<p>deeds did not stop You from increasing their cattle, give them their full</p>  
<p>measure and take sorrow away from them, and make them afraid of</p>  
<p>Your chastisement. Or he who does goodness You increase his reward.</p>  
<p>You have made thankfulness incumbent on those who obey You and</p>  
<p>also made it obligatory on the evildoers. You have promised these doers</p>  
<p>of good that Your obligation on them will be greater than their obligation.</p>  
<p>You are pure, You give reward for those things which begin and end in</p>  
<p>Your name. I praise You to such an extent that it achieves Your</p>  
<p>happiness and like a person who by praising You reaches in Your</p>  
<p>presence and by it becomes eligible for Your bounties. My Lord there is</p>  
<p>a special support and specific bounties for Your beloved people, so</p>  
<p>bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and grace us with Your</p>  
<p>special support and specific bounties which are present at the time of</p>  
<p>calamities, a protector at the time of loses, and deliverance from</p>  
<p>destruction and an excellent guide to show the right path. O the one who</p>  
<p>saves us from calamities, and the one to multiply good deeds. O the one</p>  
<p>to increase the destinies and the one to perfect the bounties, O the one</p>  
<p>to conceal the defects and to cover one's faults, grant me the grace and</p>  
<p>to seek more forgiveness for the sins because You are too near and the</p>  
<p>one to accept our supplications. And send blessings on Your appointed</p>  
<p>and beloved creation and give excessive bounties to the recipient of</p>  
<p>Your revelations. Send on them Your best of the bounties as they have</p>  
<p>propagated Your message, explained Your laws clearly, called the</p>  
<p>people to Your path, and with living examples have established proof of</p>  
<p>Your existence till the time they acquired certainty. O Allah bless</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and also send mercy on the pure</p>  
<p>progeny and reserve for them those bounties which You have selected</p>  
<p>for Your special Prophets and have bestowed on them. O the most</p>  
<p>merciful of all the mercifuls. O Allah! It is only Your wishes, that none</p>  
<p>can restrain from fulfillment, the destructions have accepted defeat in</p>  
<p>causing hurdles in completion of Your wishes. Thus by Your wishes and</p>  
<p>by Your grace bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and make</p>  
<p>these wishes reach completion as You are the possessor of vast Mercy</p>  
<p>and the forgiver, the acceptor of supplications and the hearer of the</p>  
<p>calls.</p>
