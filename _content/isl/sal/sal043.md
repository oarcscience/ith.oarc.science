His supplication for stomachache to be

recited after drinking some hot water

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! O the Beneficent! O the Merciful! O the Lord

of the Lords! O Deity of the deities! O the King of the Kings! O the
chief

of the Chiefs! Cure me from all the diseases and grant me strength from

all the ailments by Your cure, that I am Your slave and son of Your
slave

and I move about only within Your power.
