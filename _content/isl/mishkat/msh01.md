# ACKNOWLEDGMENT

I HAVE greatly profited from hints, generously lavished in the course of
correspondence, from Professors D.B. MACDONALD, R. NICHOLSON, and LOUIS
MASSIGNON, in addition to recent works by the last two. My cordial
thanks to these; and also to Professor D.S. MARGOLIOUTH for discussing
with me some of the difficult points in the translation.
