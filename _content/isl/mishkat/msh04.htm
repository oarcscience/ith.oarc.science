<P>THE MISHK&Acirc;T AL-ANWAR[1] is a work of extreme interest from the viewpoint of al-Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc;'s[2] inner life and esoteric thought. The glimpses it gives of that life and thought are remarkably, perhaps uniquely, intimate. It begins where his autobiographical <I>Al-Munqidh min al-<U>D</U>al&acirc;l</I> leaves off. Its esotericism excited the curiosity and even the suspicion of Muslim thinkers from the first, and we have deeply interesting allusions to it in Ibn <U>T</U>ufaill and Ibn Rushd,[4] the celebrated philosophers of Western Islam, who flourished within the century after al-Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc;'s death in 1111 (A.H. 505)--a fact which, again, increases its importance and interest for us.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The <I>Mishk&acirc;t al-Anw&acirc;r</I> is numbered No. 34 in Brockelmann's <I>Geschichte der Arabischen Literatur</I> (vol. i, p. 423). It was printed in Cairo (ma<U>t</U>ba`at a<U>s</U> <U>S</U>idq, A. H. 1322), to which edition the references in the present work are made. There is another edition in a collection of five opuscules of Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc; under the title of the first of the five, <I>Fai<U>s</U>al al-Tafriqa</I>.</P>
