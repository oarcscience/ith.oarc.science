#### THE STUDY OF MAN.

### CHAPTER I.

#### GROUNDS FOR THE DISCUSSION.

<span class="margnote">"Know thyself."</span>LIKE the ancient sages the
Oriental Philosophers hold the maxim " Know thyself," to be one of vital
importance to the Traveller on the Road of Life. A considerable portion
therefore of their speculative treatises is invariably devoted to the
study of mankind.

<span class="margnote">Religious</span>Much difference of opinion exists
as to the point of view from which man is to be discussed; the religious
teachers asserting that since God created him from nothing he may be
considered as an actual being whose characteristics are capable of
diagnosis and definition.

<span class="margnote">and Metaphysical view of the question.</span> The
metaphysicians, on the other hand, say that it is impossible for that
which is not, to be, or for that which is, not to be; they allow,
however, that that which is may assume various forms and manifest itself
in different ways, and prefer considering man as a particular
manifestation of the one Universal

existence of God. Both however agree in the propriety of the discussion,
though upon different grounds.

Man constitutes the Lesser World, and everything <span
class="margnote">Man, a world in himself.</span> that is not man is
included in the Greater World; and since every thing in the Greater
World has its counterpart in the Lesser, the study of this is a duty
incumbent upon all who aspire to spiritual knowledge. To know oneself is
the "right way" (<span id="img_05100"></span> ![](img/05100.jpg)), for
guidance in which Mohammed besought God in his prayer, "Guide us into
the right way <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29)." Self-knowledge is
the shortest road to the knowledge of God. When Ali asked Mohammed "What
am I to do that I may not waste my time?" the Prophet answered, "Learn
to know thyself."
