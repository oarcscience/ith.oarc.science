<p><DIR>1. "And establish prayer and pay the zak&#257;t and bow down with those who bow down" (2:43).</p>  
<p>2. "Thee do we serve and Thee do we beseech for help. Guide us on the right path" (1:4, 5).</p>  
<p>3. "And when thou art among them and leadest the prayer for them, let a party of them stand with thee and let them take their arms; then when they have prostrated themselves let them go to your rear and let another party who have not prayed come forward and pray with thee"(4:102).</DIR></p>  
<p>The prayer-service of Isl&#257;m is essentially a congregational service, and has, besides the development of the inner self of man, through communion with God, other ends as well in view, which show what a unique force the Islamic prayer is in the unification of the human race. In the first place, this gathering of all people living in the same vicinity five times daily in the mosque, is a great help to the establishment of healthy social relations, the circle becoming wider in the Friday service, and still more extensive in the '&#298;d gatherings. But the <i>jam&#257;'ah</i> not only promotes social relations: what is far more important it levels down social differences. In the congregational prayer all Muslims stand shoulder to shoulder before their Maker, the king along with his poorest subject, the rich arrayed in costly robes with the beggar clad in rags, the white man along with his black brother. Nay, the king or the rich man standing in a back row is required to lay his head, when prostrating himself before God, at the feet of a slave or a beggar standing in the front row There could be no greater levelling influence in the world. In fact, congregational prayers are meant, among other things, to carry into practice the theoretical lessons of equality and fraternity for which Isl&#257;m stands, and however forcibly Isl&#257;m may have preached in words the equality of man and the fraternity of the community of Isl&#257;m, all this would have ended in mere talk, had it not been translated into everyday life through the institution of five daily congregational prayers.</p>  
<p>The stress laid by the Holy Qur'&#257;n on jam&#257;'ah is evident not only from the express command contained in v. 1; the very word used in it for the observance</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of prayers is evidence that congregation is of the essence of prayer. Wherever the institution of prayer is spoken of, one of the derivatives of the word <i>iq&#257;mah</i> which signifies the <i>putting</i> (of an affair) into <i>a right state</i> or the <i>keeping up</i> or <i>establishing of it</i>, is used to indicate its proper observance. This very word <i>iq&#257;mah</i> technically signifies the pronouncement of certain sentences before the congregational service is held, for which see the preceding chapter. The word <i>iq&#257;mah</i> being thus associated with congregational service by the Holy Prophet himself is a clear indication that by the <i>iq&#257;mah</i> of prayer in the Holy Qur'&#257;n is meant the establishment of the congregational service. In fact, the stress laid on jam&#257;'ah by the Holy Qur'&#257;n is evident from its prayers, which all aim at the development of the community as a whole--v. 2 which contains the most frequently repeated prayer of Isl&#257;m affords an example of this. V. 3 shows that the importance attached to congregational prayer is so great that even when facing the enemy in the battle-field, Muslims are required to say their prayers in congregation.</p>  
<p>Of the had&#299;th related in this chapter, the first three lay stress on the importance of the congregational prayer; h. 4 shows that when the congregational prayer it being said, no prayer shall be said singly, H. 5 speaks of the excellence of congregational prayer, while h. 6 shows that when it would be hard on people to gather together in the mosque they should be allowed to say their prayers in their abodes. Hh. 7, 8 show that even women were required to join the congregation, while h. 14 requires that women should form a separate row by themselves. Hh. 9,-12 relate to the arrangement of ranks, while h. 13 shows that a single man shall not form a row by himself.</p>  
<p><b>1</b> Ab&#363; Hurairah reported that The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>

<p>Ibn 'Umar gave a call for prayer in Dzajn&#257;n on a cold night, then said, Say prayers in your abodes; and he informed us that the Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, used to order a mu'adhdhin, on a cold or rainy night and during journey, to give a call for prayer, then say, on finishing it, Beware!

<p><b>8</b> '&#256;'ishah reported that The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, used to say the morning prayer when it was yet dark; so the women of the believers returned while they could not be recognised on account of darkness, or they did not recognise one another.</p>  
<p align="right">(B. 10:164.)</p>  
<p><b>9</b> Anas reported on the authority of the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, (who) said:</p>  
<p>"Arrange your ranks properly, for the proper arrangement of ranks is part of the keeping up of prayer." (B. 10:74.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">3. Even women must join the congregation if they are otherwise free. Mothers sometimes took their babies along with them when going to attend the congregation.</FONT></p>

<p><b>10</b> Ab&#363; Hurairah reported that The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>

<p><b>11</b> Abn Mas'&#363;d said,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, used to touch our shoulders at the time of prayer, and used to say:</p>  
<p>"Keep straight and do not be uneven, for in that case your hearts would disagree. Let those from among you, who are possessed of understanding and wisdom, stand nearest to me, then those who are next to them, then those who are next to them."</p>

<p>The Messenger of Allah, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>

<p align="right">(B. 10:78).</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">4. In such a case, the man is required to take hold of a man from the last row and make him stand along with himself behind the row so that the two together may form a row.</p>  
<p>5. In congregational prayers the women formed a row by themselves behind the male rows: and even if there was a single woman, she formed a row by herself, Women were not allowed to mix with the men in their rows, as such a course would have led to the evil which is witnessed in church gatherings.</FONT></p>
