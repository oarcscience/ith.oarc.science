<p>4. "And they (your wives) have made with you a firm covenant" (4:21).</p>  
<p>5. "He it is Who created you from a single being, and of the same kind did He make his mate that he might incline to her" (7:189).</p>  
<p>6. "And one of His signs is that He created mates for you from yourselves that you may find quiet of mind in them and He put between you love and compassion" (30:21).</p>  
<p>7. "He made mates for you from among yourselves ........... multiplying you thereby" (42:11).</p>  
<p>8. "And the chaste from among the believing women and the chaste from among those who have been given the Book before you are lawful for you when you have given them their dowries, taking them in marriage, not fornicating, nor taking them for paramours in secret" (5:5).</p>  
<p>9. "Forbidden to you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your paternal aunts, and your maternal aunts, and brothers' daughters, and sisters' daughters, and your mothers that have suckled you, and your foster-sisters, and mothers of your wives, and your step-daughters who are in your guardianship born of your wives to whom you have gone in--but if you have not gone in to them, there is no blame on you--and the wives of your sons who are of your own loins, and that you should have two sisters together except what has already passed...........and all married women except those whom your right hands possess" (4:23, 24). <A NAME="page_267"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 267</FONT></A></p>

<p>14. "And whoever among you has not within his power ampleness of means to marry free believing women, (he may marry) of those whom your right hands possess from among your believing maidens............So marry them with the permission of their masters and give them their dowries justly" (4:25).</DIR></p>  
<p>The Arabic word for marriage is <i>nik&#257;h</i> which means, originally <i>'aqd</i> or <i>uniting</i>. It is recognised in Isl&#257;m as the basis of human society, and marriage-relationship is given the same importance as blood-relationship (v. 1). Celibate life its against the teachings of the Holy Qur&#257;n which requires every Muslim to live in a married state (v. 2: h. 1), Castration is forbidden (hh. 2, 3), Marriage is a sacred contract (v. 4), which a man and a woman enter into by mutual agreement (v. 3). It is a contract entered into for life, temporary marriage being forbidden (h. 4). It serves a double purpose, being the means of the moral uplift of man and the means of the multiplication. of the human race (vv. 5-7). Marriage may be contracted with a non-Muslim woman (v. 8). It is prohibited within certain degrees of relationship (v. 9). The rule is the marriage of one man with one woman, but in exceptional cases a man may marry up to four women (v. 13). Marriage with slave-girls was allowed in case a man had not the means to marry a free woman (v. 14).</p>  
<p>Marriage should be preceded by a proposal (h. 5). It is recommended that before making a proposal, a man should satisfy himself as to the desirability of the match (hh. 6, 7). The guardian must obtain the woman's consent (h. 8); where a woman was given in marriage by tier father and she disliked the match, the marriage was annulled (b. g). Marriage among equals is recommended, but all Muslims being equal there is no limitation as to the choice of the mate (b. 10). Nobility of character is the most valuable gift of a woman which should be taken into consideration in marrying her (b. 11). A dowry must be settled upon the woman, there being no limitation as to the amount (vv. 10, 11; h. 5): it may be increased or decreased by mutual consent after marriage (v. 12). Any conditions may be laid down at the time of marriage. so long as they are not against the law of Isl&#257;m (h. 12). <i>Shigh&#257;r</i> is prohibited (h. 13). The marriage must be publicly proclaimed, and it is recommended that</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_268"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 268</FONT></A></p>  
<p>it should be held in a public place and announced with the beat of <i>duff</i>, a musical instrument (h. 14). The contract is sanctified by a sermon before the parties announce their acceptance (h. 15). Gatherings on the occasion of marriage are also a means of making it publicly known (h. 16). Music is allowed at the marriage ceremony (h. 17). Gifts may also be given on this occasion (h. 18). A feast is recommended when the bride comes to the husband's house (hh. 19, 20), Prayer to God for Divine blessings is recommended at the first meeting of the husband and the wife (h. 21). Birth-control is allowed when it becomes a necessity (hh. 22, 23). When a baby is born, adh&#257;n must be called out into its ears (h. 24), and the naming and the <i>tahn&#299;k</i> follow (h. 25). <i>'Aq&#299;qah</i> must also be performed if one can afford (hh. 26-28).</p>  
<p><b>1</b> 'Alqamah said,</p>  
<p>While I was going along with 'Abd All&#257;h, he said, We were with the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, and he said:</p>  
<p>"He who is able to marry should marry, for it keeps the eye cast down and keeps a man chaste; and he who cannot, should take to fasting, for it will have a castrating effect upon him.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">1</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B. 30:10.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">1. Marriage is here recognised as a means of moral elevation and spiritual exaltation. Fasting has a castrating effect inasmuch as the carnal passions are thereby subdued. According to another had&#299;th, marriage is recognised as the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet, and it is added; "He who abstains from my Sunnah is not of me." (B. 67:l.)</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A></p>  
<p><b>2</b> Ibn Mas'&#363;d said,</p>  
<p>We used to fight along with the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, and we had not (our) wives (with us); so we said, May we not castrate, O Messenger of All&#257;h? And he forbade us doing so.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">2</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B. 67:64)</p>  
<p><b>3</b> Sa'd said, The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, repudiated Uthm&#257;n ibn Maz'&#363;n's remaining celibate, and if he had permitted him, we would have been emasculated.</p>  
<p align="right">(B. 67:8.)</p>  
<p><b>4</b> 'Al&#299; reported,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, forbade temporary marriage with women, and the eating of domestic asses. on the day of Khaibar.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">3</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B. 64:40.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">3 So in Isl&#257;m there are no eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven. On the other hand, marrying and keeping oneself chaste is a means of attaining the kingdom of heaven.</p>  
<p>4. The technical word for temporary marriage is <i>mut'ah</i>. It is derived from <i>mat&#257;'</i> meaning <i>profiting for a long time</i>. <i>Mut'ah</i> is considered to be a legal form of marriage by the Sh&#299;'ahs, but the vast majority of the Muslim community <A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A> rejects it on the basis of the had&#299;th quoted here. The Holy Qur'&#257;n uses the word <i>ihs&#257;n</i> (lit. <i>being inaccessible</i>) for marriage, and thus looks upon marriage as a permanent relation which can be cutoff only by divorce. For all other kinds of sexual relationship it uses the word <i>saf&#257;h</i>, which signifies fornication According to some had&#299;th, <i>mut'ah</i> was allowed by the Holy Prophet in a war. Even if this be true, it may have been allowed at an earlier stage, reform having been brought about gradually, but there is not the least doubt that it was finally disallowed.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_270"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 270</FONT></A></p>  
<p><b>5</b> '&#256;'ishah reported,</p>  
<p>In the pre-Islamic times marriage was in four ways; one of these being as the people's marriage to-day, a man asking another man for marriage with his ward or his daughter, then he settles on her a dowry, then marries her.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">4</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B 67:37.)</p>  
<p><b>6</b> J&#257;bir said,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said When one of you asks a woman in marriage, then if he is able that he should look into what invites him to have her in marriage, he should do it."</p>  
<p align="right">(AD. 12:17.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">4. <i>Khitbah</i> or asking a woman in marriage is a preliminary stage. The dowry to be settled on the woman must then be agreed upon. There is no limitation <A NAME="page_272"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 272</FONT></A> to this amount; it may be a heap of gold (v. 11), or it may be a ring of iron, or even service rendered to the woman in teaching her (B. 67:51). In fact, the amount of the dowry depends on the circumstances of the contracting parties.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_272"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 272</FONT></A></p>  
<p><b>7</b> Mugh&#299;rah reported,</p>  
<p>He made a proposal of marriage to a woman, and the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p>"See her, for this is more likely to bring about agreement between you."</p>  
<p align="right">(Tr. 9:5.)</p>  
<p><b>8</b> Ab&#363; Hurairah reported,</p>  
<p>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said</p>  
<p>"The widow shall not be married until she is consulted, and the virgin shall not be married until her consent is obtained."</p>  
<p>They said, O Messenger of All&#257;h! How shall her consent be obtained? He said. "(It is sufficient) that she remains silent."<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">5</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B. 67:42.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">5. Hh. 8 and 9 show that a woman must be given in marriage by her guardian; but the guardian, whether father or anyone else must obtain the woman's consent. As many had&#299;th show, a woman is at liberty to offer her hand to anyone, and Bukh&#257;r&#299; heads one of his chapters as follows: "A woman offering herself for marriage to a virtuous man" (B. 67:33 ). In such a case, the state is considered to be the guardian (B. 67:41).</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_272"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 272</FONT></A></p>  
<p><b>9</b> Khans&#257;' reported,</p>  
<p>Her father gave her away in marriage, and she was a <i>thayyib</i>, and she did not like it. So she came to the Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, and he annulled her marriage.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">6</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B. 67:43.)</p>  
<p><b>10</b> '&#256;'ishah said,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p>"Select (fit) women (in respect of character) for your seed, and marry (your) equals and give (your daughters) in marriage to them."<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">7</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(IM. 9:46.)</p>  
<p><b>11</b> Ab&#363; Hurairah reported,</p>  
<p>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p>"A woman is married on account of four things;</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">6. Thus the woman has the choice of repudiating a marriage to which she is not a consenting party. The word <i>thayyib</i> includes both a woman whose husband has died and a woman who has been divorced.</p>  
<p>7. Marriage must be contracted so far as possible between equals. This is technically known as marriage in <i>kuf'</i> or <i>kufu'</i> (pl. <i>akf&#257;'</i>). Bukh&#257;r&#299; explains this by heading his chapter as "<i>Al-Akfa fi-l-d&#299;n</i>" (67:16), or <i>Equals in religion</i>; making it clear that all Muslims are equal in one sense. There are examples recorded in Had&#299;th in which a woman of the high family of Quraish was married to a slave or a freed slave (B. 64: 12).</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_273"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 273</FONT></A></p>  
<p>on account of her wealth, and on account of (the nobility of) her family, and her beauty, and on account of her character,<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">8</FONT> so attain success with the one possessing nobility of character." (B . 67: 16.)</p>  
<p><b>12</b> 'Uqbah said,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p>"The conditions which are most worthy that you should fulfil are those with which you legalize sexual relations."<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">9</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B. 54:6.)</p>  
<p><b>13</b> Ibn 'Umar reported,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, forbade, <i>shigh&#257;r</i>; and <i>shigh&#257;r</i> is this that a man gives his daughter in marriage to another man on condition that the latter shall give his daughter in marriage to him, neither of them paying dowry.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">10</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B. 67:29.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">8. Religion. in contrast with the other three, builds character, and hence the word <i>din</i> carries the significance of character here.</p>  
<p>9. Any conditions which the parties agree upon may be laid down in the marriage contract, so long as they are not against the law. For instance, it is stated that a woman shall not impose a condition requiring the divorce of her sister (B. 67:54).</p>  
<p>10. The dowry must be made over to the woman, and her father or guardian has no right to it. Hence <i>shigh&#257;r</i> is forbidden.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_274"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 274</FONT></A></p>  
<p><b>14</b> '&#256;'ishah said,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p>Make the marriage publicly known, and perform it in mosques, and beat at it with <i>duff</i>."<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">11</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(Tr-Msh. 13:3.)</p>  
<p><b>15</b> Abd All&#257;h said:</p>  
<p>'The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, taught us the marriage sermon (which is thus):<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">12</FONT></p>  
<p>"All praise is due to All&#257;h; we beseech Him for help, and we ask for His protection, and we seek refuge in Him from the mischiefs of our souls; whomsoever All&#257;h guides, there is none who can lead him astray and whomsoever All&#257;h finds in error, there is none to guide him;</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">11. <i>Duff</i> or <i>daff</i> is the tambourine, and the object of beating with <i>daff</i> at marriage is to make it publicly known. It also furnishes a kind of music.</p>  
<p>12. The <i>khutbah</i> or sermon at marriage helps the publicity of the marriage, and serves the double purpose of sanctifying the marriage contract and informing the parties of their responsibilities. The three verses of the Holy Qur'&#257;n quoted in the sermon are 4:1 (a part), 3:101, and 33:70, 71. V. 4: 1 runs thus: <A NAME="page_275"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 275</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"O people! Be careful of your duty to your Lord. Who created you from a single being and created its mate of the same kind, and spread from these two many men and women; and be careful of your duty to All&#257;h by Whom you demand one of another your rights and to the ties of relationship; surely All&#257;h ever watches over you."</p>  
<p>The whole of this verse may be recited instead of the part given in the Had&#299;th. They all lay stress on carefulness to duty. and the person who delivers the sermon must expatiate on them to make the audience realize their import. The <i>khutbah</i> is followed by <i>&#299;j&#257;b</i> and <i>qub&#363;l</i>, <i>i.e.</i>. the acceptance of the parties to the contract, and the amount of dowry is made publicly known. This is followed by a prayer by the whole gathering that the union may be blessed.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_275"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 275</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and I bear witness that there is no god but All&#257;h and that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger. 'O you who believe! Be careful of your duty to All&#257;h, by Whom you demand one of another your rights, and to the ties of relationship; surely All&#257;h watches over you. 'O you who believe! Be careful of your duty to All&#257;h with the care which is due to him, and do not die unless you are Muslims.' 'O you who believe! Be careful of your duty to All&#257;h and speak the right word; He would put for</p>

<p>you your deeds into a right state and forgive you your faults; and whoever obeys All&#257;h and His Messenger, he indeed achieves a mighty success."</p>  
<p align="right">(AD. 12:3l.)</p>  
<p><b>16</b> Anas said,</p>  
<p>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, saw women and children coming from a wedding, so the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, stood up erect and said: "O All&#257;h! You are the most loved of all people to me." He said this three times.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">13</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B. 63:5.)</p>  
<p><b>17</b> '&#256;'ishah said,</p>  
<p>She conducted the bride to a man from among the Ans&#257;r. And the</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">13 The <i>nik&#257;h</i> was followed by a ceremony of conducting the bride to the bridegroom, called <i>'urs</i> or <i>'urus</i>, at which people gathered together, and thus it received additional publicity. The had&#299;th further shows the Holy Prophet's deep love for women and children. As these women and children were from among the Ans&#257;r, the Had&#299;th is narrated by Bukh&#257;r&#299; in a chapter dealing with "the love of the Ans&#257;r."</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_277"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 277</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Prophet of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said, "O '&#256;'ishah! Why had you no music with you, for the Ans&#257;r love music?<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">14</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B. 67:64.)</p>  
<p><b>18</b> Anas said,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, had Zainab conducted to him on the occasion of his marriage with her; so Umm Sulaim said to me, What i if we send a present to the Messenger of All&#257;h? <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, I said to her, Do it. So she took dates and butter and cheese, and made a preparation mingling them in a cooking-pot, and sent me with it to him. And I went with it to him, and he said, Place it (here<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">15</FONT>)."</p>  
<p align="right">(B. 67:65.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">14. The word used in the had&#299;th is <i>lahw</i>, which means <i>a thing in which a man delights himself and which occupies him so as to divert him</i>, and includes every diversion, pastime, sport or play. Here it means music.</p>  
<p>15. Giving of presents at marriage is therefore in accordance with the Sunnah.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_278"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 278</FONT></A></p>  
<p><b>19</b> Anas said,</p>  
<p>Zainab bint Jahsh was conducted as a bride to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, and bread and meat were served, and I was sent to invite people to the feast. A party came and had the meal, then went out; then another party came and had the meal and went out; I went on thus inviting until I could not find any one whom I should invite.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">16</FONT></p>

<p align="right">(B. 67:72.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">16. This feast is called <i>walimah</i> and it is given by the bridegroom when the bride has been conducted to him. It is said to be derived from <i>iltiy&#257;m</i> which means gathering together of two people.</FONT></p>

<p><b>21</b> Ion 'Abb&#257;s said, carrying it back to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, (who) said:</p>

It is allowed when conception is likely to endanger the woman's life or impair her health.</FONT></p>

<p>A son was born to me and I brought him to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, He named him Ibr&#257;h&#299;m, and he chewed a date and rubbed thereby his palate, and prayed for blessings for him and gave him back to me.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">19</FONT></p>

<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">18. This is the first act with regard to a Muslim baby. The words of the adh&#257;n are repeated opposite the right ear, and the words of iq&#257;mah opposite the left. The latter is based on a report in the <i>Sharh al-Sunnah</i> showing that 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Az&#299;z followed this practice. The practice is traced back to the Holy Prophet in the Musnad of Ab&#363; Ya'l&#257;. The utterance of words relating to the unity and greatness of All&#257;h in the ears of a new-born baby shows that the Holy Prophet was aware of the existence of the sub-conscious mind.</p>  
<p>19. The Arabic word is <i>hannaka-h&#363;</i>. The word <i>tahn&#299;k</i> is derived from <i>hanak</i> which means the interior of the upper part of the inside of the mouth, or the palate. The new-born baby is made to taste either a chewed date as in this case, or honey, by some elderly member of the family. The naming of the baby. the <i>tahn&#299;k</i> and a prayer for him are thus the sunnah of the Holy Prophet.</FONT></p>

The word <i>'aq&#299;qah</i> is derived from <i>'aqqa</i> meaning <i>he clave</i>, <i>split</i> or <i>cut</i>; and <i>'aqqa an waladi-h&#299;</i> signifies <i>he slaughtered as a sacrifice for his child a sheep or a goat</i> (on the seventh day after the birth). This is called <i>'aq&#299;qah</i>, but the word is also applied to the hair, of a young one recently born, that comes forth on his head in his mother's belly, the hair being shaved on the seventh day. It is in reference to this that the Had&#299;th speaks of removing of uncleanness.</p>  
<p>21. This is the general practice, but as the next had&#299;th shows, one goat suffices in the case of the boy as well. It is only for those who can afford.</FONT></p>
