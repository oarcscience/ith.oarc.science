<p><DIR>1. "And thy Lord do magnify, And thy garments do purify, And uncleanness do shun" (74:3-5).</p>  
<p>2. "Surely All&#257;h loves those who turn to Him again and again, and He loves those who purify themselves" (2:222).</p>  
<p>3. "Attend to your adornment at every time of prayer." (7:31).</p>  
<p>4. "O you who believe! When you rise up to prayers, wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows and wipe our hands and (wash) your feet to the ankles; and if you are under an obligation to perform a total ablution, have a bath; and if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy, or you have had contact with women, and you cannot find water, betake yourselves to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands therewith; All&#257;h does not desire to put on you any difficulty but He wishes to purify you and that He may complete His favour to you, so that you may be thankful" (5:6).</DIR></p>  
<p>Purification, though a necessary preliminary to prayer, is an independent subject and is dealt with as such in Had&#299;th collections. The first three quotations from the Holy Qur'&#257;n given above require in general terms that the man who would turn to his Lord should be pure in body and garments. The Purification of the body is thus made a preliminary to prayer so that by external purification a man's attention may be directed to the purification of the soul which is aimed at in prayer. V. 4 gives the details of ablutions which are necessary before prayer. Purity of the body is thus required as a preliminary to the purity of mind, and the Muslim who is required to say prayers five times a day must needs keep himself and his clothes always clean.</p>  
<p>It is true that an intelligent man should know for himself what cleanliness is, but religion aims at giving directions to men in all stages of civilization, in early states as well as in the more developed ones. Moreover. the masses among all people stand in need of minute details, and hence while the Holy Qur'&#257;n simply gives the general direction to keep oneself in a state of cleanliness, Had&#299;th gives the necessary details. As a matter of fact Isl&#257;m directs attention to many details of personal cleanliness of which even the more civilized people are ignorant.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A></p>  
<p>I have divided the chapter into five sections. The first deals with natural evacuations. Purification is called half the faith (h. 1) and the key to prayer (hh. 2. 3), It must not be forgotten that purity of the body is a prelude to the purity of the soul (h. 4). Full regard must be paid to personal cleanliness as well as public hygiene (hh. 5-13). Spitting in public places is forbidden (hh. 16, 17).</p>  
<p>The second section deals with tooth-brushing which occupies a very prominent place in the Muslim's cleanliness. It is spoken of as a means of purifying the mouth and seeking the pleasure of the Lord (h. 18), which is to show that God loves even bodily cleanliness. Great stress is laid upon its use (hh. 19, 20), and the minimum requirement is that the tooth-brush should be used after getting up from sleep (hh. 21, 22), A clean mouth is in fact the greatest help for the preservation of health. Its importance is further emphasized in h. 23, The third section gives the details of ablution (hh. 25 36) and shows when a fresh ablution becomes necessary (hh. 37-41). A prayer directing attention to purity of the spirit must be offered when the ablution has been performed (h. 43).</p>  
<p>The fourth section deals with total ablution or bath, which is made compulsory once a week (hh. 44-46). Particular occasions on which bath must be taken are mentioned in hh. 47-50, A person under an obligation to have a bath on account of <i>jan&#257;bah</i> and a menstruating woman are not impure (hh. 51, 52). Some details are given in hh. 53, 54, and taking a bath naked in an open place is strictly forbidden (1.1. 55).</p>  
<p>The fifth section deals with <i>tayammum</i> or wiping the face and hands with pure dust when water is not available for ablution or bath, though it may be available for drinking or domestic purposes, or when the use of water is likely to be harmful (hh. 56-58). This act is as it were a reminder that purification before prayer is an essential thing.</p>  <h2 align="center">SECTION I.--NATURAL EVACUATIONS.</h2>

<p><b>2</b> J&#257;bir said, The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p>"The key to paradise is prayer and the key to prayer is purification."</p>  
<p align="right">(Ah-Msh. 1)</p>  
<p><b>3</b> Ibn 'Umar said,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p>"Prayer is not accepted without purification, nor (is) charity (accepted) out of what is acquired by unlawful means."<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">2</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(M-Msh. 3:l.)</p>  
<p><b>4</b> Anas said,</p>  
<p>When the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, went to privy, he used to say:</p>  
<p>"O All&#257;h! I seek refuge</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">2. This had&#299;th and the previous one lay down in general terms that purification is a necessary condition of prayer, which in fact means that a man should always keep himself free from impurities, since prayer is said five times a day. The habit of outward purification is thus developed through an institution which is meant to purify the soul, and a Muslim is required to keep his body, his clothes, in fact, the whole of his environment, clean. Charity like prayer purifies the mind, and as what is acquired by unlawful means is impure, the pure and the impure cannot go together.</FONT></p>

<p><b>5</b> Anas reported,</p>  
<p>When the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, went out for natural evacuation, I and a boy used to go and with us there used to be a bucket of water.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">4</FONT></p>

<p><b>6</b> 'Abd All&#257;h said,</p>  
<p>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, went to ease himself and he asked me to bring him three pebbles.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">5</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(B. 4:21.)</p>  
<p><b>7</b> '&#256;'ishah said,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">3. <i>Khubuth</i> is the plural of <i>khab&#299;th</i> (an evil person) and <i>khab&#257;'ith</i> is the plural of <i>khab&#299;thah</i> (an evil person of feminine gender), and the words are generally understood as meaning the devils, but according to the <i>Nih&#257;yah</i>, the first word may also be read as <i>khubth</i> which means impure deeds and the second word may also mean evil habits. Thus from outward defilement attention is directed to inward impurities.</p>  
<p>4. Other had&#299;th speak of stones for cleaning purposes, but water was used when available even after cleaning with earth or stones. These may appear to be minor details, but the minutest details are necessary to develop habits of cleanliness. Water or earth was also used after urinating.</p>  
<p>5. This with and the one following speak of pebbles or balls of dry earth for cleaning purposes. Toilet paper would serve the same purpose.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"When one of you goes to ease himself, let him take with him three pebbles with which to clean himself, for these will suffice him."</p>  
<p align="right">(AD-Msh 3:2.)</p>  
<p><b>8</b> J&#257;bir said,</p>  
<p>When the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, wanted to ease himself he went (to a distant place) until no one could see him.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">6</FONT></p>

<p><b>9</b> Ab&#363; M&#363;s&#257; reported,</p>  
<p>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p>When one of you wishes to pass urine, let him seek the proper place for urinating."<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">7</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(AD-Msh. 3:2.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">6. For evacuating himself a man must not, therefore, sit in a place where he can be seen by others; <i>i.e.</i>, when he goes out into fields. Latrines must be made on the same principle.</p>  
<p>7. So there must be either urinals or a man must retire to some other proper place of retirement.</FONT></p>

<p>Then he took hold of a corner of his sheet and spat in it then turned one part of it over the other and said:</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">11. Evidently it was a public place where other people were present and by spitting in his handkerchief he showed that it was not proper to spit on the ground in public places. Besides being indecent, it is insanitary.</FONT></p>

<p><b>19</b> Ab&#363; Hurairah said, on the authority of the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, "Were it not that I would place too heavy a burden on my community, I would have commanded them to use the tooth-brush at every ablution."</p>

<p>The Messenger of</p>

<p><b>24</b> Sa'&#299;d ibn Zaid said,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p>"That man has not performed ablution who does not remember All&#257;h in doing it."<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">15</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(Tr-Msh. 3:4.)</p>  
<p><b>25</b> Yahy&#257; al-M&#257;zin&#299; reported that</p>  
<p>A man said to 'Abd All&#257;h ibn Zaid, Canst thou show me how the Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, performed ablution? 'Abd All&#257;h ibn Zaid said, Yes.</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">15. Ablution, which means washing of certain parts of the body that are generally exposed and where dust or dirt is likely to settle, is a preparation for going into Divine presence. The object is undoubtedly twofold, that a man should be clean and that he should feel that he stands in need of the purification of the soul as he stands in need of the cleaning of the body. The remembrance of All&#257;h is needed to direct attention to this. The beginning should be made with <i>Bismill&#257;h</i> as in the case of all important affairs, while h. 42. speaks of the prayer when the ablution ends.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A></p>  
<p>So he sent for water and poured it over his hands and washed his hands twice, then he rinsed his mouth and sniffed water into his nose thrice, then he washed his face thrice, then he washed his hands up to the elbow twice, then he wiped his head with both his hands so that he carried them from the front and brought them back he began with his forehead until he carried them to his neck, then he brought them back to the place from which he had started then he washed his two feet.</p>  
<p align="right">(B. 4:38.)</p>  
<p><b>26</b> Ibn 'Abb&#257;s said,</p>  
<p>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, performed ablution (washing each part) once only.</p>  
<p align="right">(B. 4:22.)</p>  
<p><b>27</b> 'Abd All&#257;h ibn Zaid reported that</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, performed ablution (washing each part) twice.</p>  
<p align="right">(B. 4:21)</p>  
<p><b>28</b> It is reported about 'Uthm&#257;n that</p>  
<p>He performed ablution at Maq&#257;'id, and said, May I not show you the ablution of the Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>? Then he performed ablution (washing each part) thrice.<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">16</FONT></p>  
<p align="right">(M-Msh. 3:44)</p>  
<p><b>29</b> '&#256;'ishah said,</p>  
<p>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, was fond of beginning on the right side, in putting on his shoes and in combing his hair and in performing his ablution, (in fact) in all his actions.</p>  
<p align="right">(B. 4:31.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">16. The various reports show that there was great latitude in these matters. The cleaning might be effected in some cases by washing once only while in others it might require repetition. Maq&#257;'id, according to Ibn Hajar, is the name of a place in Mad&#299;nah. According to others, it means a place where people sit together.</FONT></p>

<p align="right">(B. 4:48.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">17. In performing ablution the right hand should be washed first and then the left. The same rule is to be followed in washing the feet.</p>  
<p>18. The complete <i>Mash</i> (wiping) of the head thus includes the ears, their inner side as well as the outer.</FONT></p>

<p><b>33</b> Mugh&#299;rah said,</p>  
<p>I was with the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, in a journey, and I bent down to take off his boots but he said, "Leave them alone, for I put them on in a state of cleanness;"<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">19</FONT> then he passed his hands over them both.</p>

<p><b>34</b> Mugh&#299;rah said,</p>  
<p>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, performed ablution and passed his hands over the socks and the shoes.</p>

<p><b>35</b> Ab&#363; Bakrah reported on the authority of the Prophet, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, that</p>  
<p>He allowed one who is journeying three days and</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">19. The word <i>t&#257;hiratain</i> (both being clean) in the had&#299;th refers to the two feet, but the meaning is generally taken to be that the boots were put on after performing ablution. The next had&#299;th shows that socks are treated similarly, <i>i.e.</i>, it is sufficient to pass wet hands over them when they are worn after performing ablution. This may be done for one day and night, i.e., the socks or boots must bc taken off and the feet washed once in every twenty-four hours, but in the case of one who is journeying the time-limit is three days and nights. See h.</FONT></p>

<p><b>36</b> Ab&#363; Hurairah said,</p>  
<p>The Messenger of All&#257;h, <FONT SIZE="-2">peace and blessings of All&#257;h be on him</FONT>, said:</p>  
<p>"Prayer is not accepted of a man who voids himself<FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">20</FONT> until he performs ablution."</p>  
<p align="right">(B. 4:2.)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="BLUE">20. The Arabic word is <i>ahdatha</i> which means originally <i>he caused</i> or <i>occasioned a thing</i>, and is technically applied to the <i>voiding of ordure</i>. When Ab&#363; Hurairah was asked, what <i>hadath</i> was, he simply said, <i>breaking wind</i> but it includes the passing of urine, stools and wind. To this must be added sound sleep as stated in h. 39 and vomiting (h.40), though there is a difference of opinion in the latter case. The reason for a fresh ablution after sound sleep seems to be that one does not know if one has passed wind in that condition. Bukh&#257;r&#299; makes it clear that ablution is only necessary when something passes out through the <i>makhrajain</i>, the two ways of natural evacuation. The flowing of blood from wounds or the spitting of blood does not necessitate ablution. If a man performs ablution by wiping his boots or socks, and then takes them off, fresh ablution is not necessary (hh, 32, 34). Taking food or milk does not call for fresh ablution. but the mouth should be rinsed in both cases. (B. 4:50, 51, 52.)</p>  
<p>There are certain had&#299;th speaking of the necessity of ablution in certain other cases. For instance, there is a had&#299;th which says that ablution should be performed if one has kissed one's wife, but this is contradicted by other had&#299;th. The clear rule laid down by Bukh&#257;r&#299; that ablution is necessitated only by what passes out of the two outlets of natural evacuation is the safest rule. Sound sleep and vomiting are the only exceptions.</FONT></p>
