<P>How then shall man so order life<BR>
that when his tale of years is told,<BR>
Like sated guest he wend his way;<BR>
how shall his even tenour hold?</P>
<P>Despite the Writ that stores the skull;<BR>
despite the Table and the Pen;<SUP>[1]</SUP><BR>
Maugre the Fate that plays us down,<BR>
her board the world, her pieces men?</P>
<P>How when the light and glow of life<BR>
wax dim in thickly gath'ering gloom,<BR>
Shall mortal scoff at sting of Death,<BR>
shall scorn the victory of the Tomb?</P>
<P>One way, two paths, one end the grave.<BR>
This runs athwart the flowery plain,<BR>
That breasts the bush, the steep, the crag,<BR>
in sun and wind and snow and rain:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Emblems of Kismet, or Destiny.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 59}</P>
<P>Who treads the first must look adown,<BR>
must deem his life an all in all;<BR>
Must see no heights where man may rise,<BR>
must sight no depths where man may fall.</P>
<P>Allah in Adam form must view;<BR>
adore the Maker in the made.<BR>
Content to bask in M&acirc;y&acirc;'s smile,<SUP>[1]</SUP><BR>
in joys of pain, in lights of shade.</P>
<P>He breaks the Law, he burns the Book,<BR>
he sends the Moolah back to school;<BR>
Laughs at the beards of Saintly men;<BR>
and dubs the prophet dolt and fool,</P>
<P>Embraces Cypress' taper-waist;<BR>
cools feet on wavy breast of rill;<BR>
Smiles in the Nargis' love-lorn eyes,<BR>
and 'joys the dance of Daffodil;</P>
<P>Melts in the saffron light of Dawn<BR>
to hear the moaning of the Dove;<BR>
Delights in Sundown's purpling hues<BR>
when Bulbul woos the Rose's love.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Illusion.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 60}</P>
<P>Finds mirth and joy in Jamshid-bowl;<BR>
toys with the Daughter of the vine;<BR>
And bids the beauteous cup-boy say,<BR>
"Master I bring thee ruby wine!"<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>Sips from the maiden's lips the dew;<BR>
brushes the bloom from virgin brow:--<BR>
Such is his fleshly bliss that strives<BR>
the Maker through the Made to know.</P>
<P>I've tried them all, I find them all<BR>
so same and tame, so drear, so dry;<BR>
My gorge ariseth at the thought;<BR>
I commune with myself and cry:--</P>
<P>Better the myriad toils and pains<BR>
that make the man to manhood true,<BR>
This be the rule that guideth life;<BR>
these be the laws for me and you:</P>
<P>With Ignor'ance wage eternal war,<BR>
to know thy self forever strain,<BR>
Thine ignorance of thine ignorance<BR>
is thy fiercest foe, thy deadliest bane;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. That all the senses, even the ear, may enjoy.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 61}</P>
<P>That blunts thy sense, and dulls thy taste;<BR>
that deafs thine ears, and blinds thine eyes;<BR>
Creates the thing that never was,<BR>
the Thing that ever is defies.</P>
<P>The finite Atom infinite<BR>
that forms thy circle's centre-dot,<BR>
So full-sufficient for itself,<BR>
for other selves existing not,</P>
<P>Finds the world mighty as 'tis small;<BR>
yet must be fought the unequal fray;<BR>
A myriad giants here; and there<BR>
a pinch of dust, a clod of clay.</P>
<P>Yes! maugre all thy dreams of peace<BR>
still must the fight unfair be fought;<BR>
Where thou mayst learn the noblest lore,<BR>
to know that all we know is nought.</P>
<P>True to thy Nature, to Thy self,<BR>
Fame and Disfame nor hope nor fear:<BR>
Enough to thee the small still voice<BR>
aye thund'ering in thine inner ear.</P>
<P>{p. 62}</P>
<P>From self-approval seek applause:<BR>
What ken not men thou kennest, thou!<BR>
Spurn ev'ry idol others raise:<BR>
Before thine own Ideal bow:</P>
<P>Be thine own Deus: Make self free,<BR>
liberal as the circling air:<BR>
Thy Thought to thee an Empire be;<BR>
break every prison'ing lock and bar:</P>
<P>Do thou the Ought to self aye owed;<BR>
here all the duties meet and blend,<BR>
In widest sense, withouten care<BR>
of what began, for what shall end.</P>
<P>Thus, as thou view the Phantom-forms<BR>
which in the misty Past were thine,<BR>
To be again the thing thou wast<BR>
with honest pride thou may'st decline;</P>
<P>And, glancing down the range of years,<BR>
fear not thy future self to see;<BR>
Resign'd to life, to death resign'd,<BR>
as though the choice were nought to thee.</P>
<P>{p. 63}</P>
<P>On Thought itself feed not thy thought;<BR>
nor turn from Sun and Light to gaze,<BR>
At darkling cloisters paved with tombs,<BR>
where rot the bones of bygone days:</P>
<P>"Eat not thy heart," the Sages said;<BR>
"nor mourn the Past, the buried Past;"<BR>
Do what thou dost, be strong, be brave;<BR>
and, like the Star, nor rest nor haste.</P>
<P>Pluck the old woman from thy breast:<BR>
Be stout in woe, be stark in weal;<BR>
Do good for Good is good to do:<BR>
Spurn bribe of Heav'en and threat of Hell.</P>
<P>To seek the True, to glad the heart,<BR>
such is of life the HIGHER LAW.,<BR>
Whose differ'ence is the Man's degree,<BR>
the Man of gold, the Man of straw.</P>
<P>See not that something in Mankind<BR>
that rouses hate or scorn or strife,<BR>
Better the worm of Izr&acirc;il<SUP>[1]</SUP> than Death<BR>
that walks in form of life.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Angel of Death.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 64}</P>
<P>Survey thy kind as One whose wants<BR>
in the great Human Whole unite;<SUP>[1]</SUP><BR>
The Homo rising high from earth<BR>
to seek the Heav'ens of Life-in-Light;</P>
<P>And hold Humanity one man,<BR>
whose universal agony<BR>
Still strains and strives to gain the goal,<BR>
where agonies shall cease to be.</P>
<P>Believe in all things; none believe;<BR>
judge not nor warp by "Facts" the thought;<BR>
See clear, hear clear, tho' life may seem<BR>
M&acirc;y&acirc; and Mirage, Dream and Naught.</P>
<P>Abjure the Why and seek the How:<BR>
the God and gods enthroned on high,<BR>
Are silent all, are silent still;<BR>
nor hear thy voice, nor deign reply.</P>
<P>The Now, that indivisible point<BR>
which studs the length of infinite line<BR>
Whose ends are nowhere, is thine all,<BR>
the puny all thou callest thine.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The "Great Man" of the Enochites and the Mormons.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 64}</P>
<P>Perchance the law some Giver hath:<BR>
Let be! let be! what canst thou know?<BR>
A myriad races came and went;<BR>
this Sphinx hath seen them come and go.</P>
<P>Haply the Law that rules the world<BR>
allows to man the widest range;<BR>
And haply Fate's a Theist-word,<BR>
subject to human chance and change.</P>
<P>This "I" may find a future Life,<BR>
a nobler copy of our own,<BR>
Where every riddle shall be ree'd,<BR>
where every knowledge shall be known;</P>
<P>Where 'twill be man's to see the whole<BR>
of what on Earth he sees in part;<BR>
Where change shall ne'er surcharge the thought;<BR>
nor hope defer'd shall hurt the heart.</P>
<P>But!--faded flow'er and fallen leaf<BR>
no more shall deck the parent tree;<BR>
And man once dropt by Tree of Life<BR>
what hope of other life has he?</P>
<P>{p. 66}</P>
<P>The shatter'd bowl shall know repair;<BR>
the riven lute shall sound once more;<BR>
But who shall mend the clay of man,<BR>
the stolen breath to man restore?</P>
<P>The shiver'd clock again shall strike;<BR>
the broken reed shall pipe again:<BR>
But we, we die, and death is one,<BR>
the doom of brutes, the doom of men.</P>
<P>Then, if Nirw&acirc;na<SUP>[1]</SUP> round our life<BR>
with nothingness, 'tis haply best;<BR>
Thy toils and troubles, want and woe<BR>
at length have won their guerdon--Rest.</P>
<P>Cease, Abd&ucirc;, cease! Thy song is sung,<BR>
nor think the gain the singer's prize;<BR>
Till men bold Ignor'ance deadly sin,<BR>
till man deserves his title "Wise:"<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>In Days to come, Days slow to dawn,<BR>
when Wisdom deigns to dwell with men,<BR>
These echoes of a voice long stilled<BR>
haply shall wake responsive strain:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Comparative annihilation.</P>
<P>2. "Homo sapiens."]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 67}</P>
<P>Wend now thy way with brow serene,<BR>
fear not thy humble tale to tell:--<BR>
The whispers of the Desert-wind;<BR>
the tinkling of the camel's bell.</P>
