<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE KAS&Icirc;DAH</H1>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">I</H2>
<P>THE hour is nigh; the waning Queen<BR>
walks forth to rule the later night;<BR>
Crown'd with the sparkle of a Star,<BR>
and throned on orb of ashen light:</P>
<P>The Wolf-tail<SUP>[1]</SUP> sweeps the paling East<BR>
to leave a deeper gloom behind,<BR>
And Dawn uprears her shining head,<BR>
sighing with semblance of a wind:</P>
<P>The highlands catch yon Orient gleam,<BR>
while purpling still the lowlands lie;<BR>
And pearly mists, the morning-pride,<BR>
soar incense-like to greet the sky.</P>
<P>The horses neigh, the camels groan,<BR>
the torches gleam, the cressets flare;<BR>
The town of canvas falls, and man<BR>
with din and dint invadeth air:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The False Dawn.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 10}</P>
<P>The Golden Gates swing right and left;<BR>
up springs the Sun with flamy brow;<BR>
The dew-cloud melts in gush of light;<BR>
brown Earth is bathed in morning-glow.</P>
<P>Slowly they wind athwart the wild,<BR>
and while young Day his anthem swells,<BR>
Sad falls upon my yearning ear<BR>
The tinkling of the camel-bells:</P>
<P>O'er fiery wastes and frozen wold,<BR>
o'er horrid hill and gloomy glen,<BR>
The home of grisly beast and Ghoul<SUP>[1]</SUP>,<BR>
the haunts of wilder, grislier men;--</P>
<P>With the brief gladness of the Palms,<BR>
that tower and sway o'er seething plain,<BR>
Fraught with the thoughts of rustling shade,<BR>
and welling spring, and rushing rain;</P>
<P>With the short solace of the ridge,<BR>
by gentle zephyrs played upon,<BR>
Whose breezy head and bosky side<BR>
front seas of cooly celadon;--</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Demon of the Desert.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 11}</P>
<P>'Tis theirs to pass with joy and hope,<BR>
whose souls shall ever thrill and fill<BR>
Dreams of the Birthplace and the Tomb,<BR>
visions of Allah's Holy Hill.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>But we? Another shift of scene,<BR>
another pang to rack the heart;<BR>
Why meet we on the bridge of Time<BR>
to 'change one greeting and to part?</P>
<P>We meet to part; yet asks my sprite,<BR>
Part we to meet? Ah! is it so?<BR>
Man's fancy-made Omniscience knows,<BR>
who made Omniscience nought can know.</P>
<P>Why must we meet, why must we part,<BR>
why must we bear this yoke of MUST,<BR>
Without our leave or askt or given,<BR>
by tyrant Fate on victim thrust?</P>
<P>That Eve so gay, so bright, so glad,<BR>
this Morn so dim, and sad, and grey;<BR>
Strange that life's Registrar should write<BR>
this day a day, that day a day</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Araf&acirc;t, near Mecca.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 12}</P>
<P>Mine eyes, my brain., my heart, are sad,<BR>
sad is the very core of me;<BR>
All wearies, changes, passes, ends;<BR>
alas! the Birthday's injury!</P>
<P>Friends of my youth, a last adieu!<BR>
haply some day we meet again;<BR>
Yet ne'er the self-same men shall meet;<BR>
the years shall make us other men:</P>
<P>The light of morn has grown to noon,<BR>
has paled with eve, and now farewell!<BR>
Go, vanish from my Life as dies<BR>
the tinkling of the camel's bell.</P>
<P>{p. 13}</P>
