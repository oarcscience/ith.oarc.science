# TO THE READER

THE Translator has ventured to entitle a "Lay of the Higher Law" the
following composition, which aims at being in advance of its time; and
he has not feared the danger of collision with such unpleasant forms as
the "Higher Culture." The principles which justify the name are as
follows:--

The Author asserts that Happiness and Misery are equally divided and
distributed in the world.

He makes Self-cultivation, with due regard to others, the sole and
sufficient object of human life.

He suggests that the affections, the sympathies, and the "divine gift of
Pity" are man's highest enjoyments.

He advocates suspension of judgment, with a proper suspicion of "Facts,
the idlest of superstitions."

Finally, although destructive to appearance, he is essentially
reconstructive.

For other details concerning the Poem and the Poet, the curious reader
is referred to the end of the volume.
