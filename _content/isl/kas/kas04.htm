<P>IN these drear wastes of sea-born land,<BR>
these wilds where none may dwell but He,<BR>
What visionary Pasts revive,<BR>
what process of the Years we see:</P>
<P>Gazing beyond the thin blue line<BR>
that rims the far horizon-ring,<BR>
Our sadden'd sight why haunt these ghosts,<BR>
whence do these spectral shadows spring?</P>
<P>What endless questions vex the thought,<BR>
of Whence and Whither, When and How?<BR>
What fond and foolish strife to read<BR>
the Scripture writ on human brow</P>
<P>As stand we percht on point of Time,<BR>
betwixt the two Eternities,<BR>
Whose awful secrets gathering round<BR>
with black profound oppress our eyes.</P>
<P>{p. 14}</P>
<P>"This gloomy night, these grisly waves,<BR>
these winds and whirlpools loud and dread:<BR>
What reck they of our wretched plight<BR>
who Safety's shore so lightly tread?</P>
<P>Thus quoth the Bard of Love and Wine,<SUP>[1]</SUP><BR>
whose dream of Heaven ne'er could rise<BR>
Beyond the brimming Kausar-cup<BR>
and Houris with the white-black eyes;</P>
<P>Ah me! my race of threescore years is short,<BR>
but long enough to pall<BR>
My sense with joyless joys as these,<BR>
with Love and Houris, Wine and all.</P>
<P>Another boasts he would divorce<BR>
old barren Reason from his bed,<BR>
And wed the Vine-maid in her stead;<BR>
fools who believe a word he said!<SUP>[2]</P>
</SUP><P>And "'Dust thou art to dust returning,'<BR>
ne'er was spoke of human soul"<BR>
The Soofi cries, 'tis well for him<BR>
that hath such gift to ask its goal.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. H&acirc;fiz of Shir&acirc;z.</P>
<P>2. Omar-i-Kayy&acirc;m, the tent-maker poet of Persia.]</P>
</FONT><P>"And this is all, for this we're born<BR>
to weep a little and to die!"<BR>
So sings the shallow bard whose life<BR>
still labours at the letter "I."</P>
<P>Ear never heard, Eye never saw<BR>
the bliss of those who enter in<BR>
My heavenly kingdom, "Is&acirc; said,<BR>
who wailed our sorrows and our sin:</P>
<P>Too much of words or yet too few!<BR>
What to thy Godhead easier than<BR>
One little glimpse of Paradise<BR>
to ope the eyes and ears of man?</P>
<P>I am the Truth! I am the Truth!<BR>
we hear the God-drunk gnostic cry<BR>
The microcosm abides in ME;<BR>
Eternal Allah's nought but I!</P>
<P>Mans&ucirc;r<SUP>[1]</SUP> was wise, but wiser they<BR>
who smote him with the hurl&egrave;d stones;<BR>
And, though his blood a witness bore,<BR>
no wisdom-might could mend his bones.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. A famous Mystic stoned for blasphemy.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 16}</P>
<P>"Eat, drink, and sport; the rest of life's<BR>
not worth a fillip," quoth the King;<BR>
Methinks the saying saith too much:<BR>
the swine would say the selfsame thing!</P>
<P>Two-footed beasts that browse through life,<BR>
by death to serve as soil design'd,<BR>
Bow prone to Earth whereof they be,<BR>
and there the proper pleasures find:</P>
<P>But you of finer, nobler, stuff,<BR>
ye, whom to Higher leads the High,<BR>
What binds your hearts in common bond<BR>
with creatures of the stall and sty?</P>
<P>In certain hope of Life-to-come<BR>
I journey through this shifting scene<BR>
The Z&acirc;hid<SUP>[1]</SUP> snarls and saunters down<BR>
his Vale of Tears with confi'dent mien.</P>
<P>Wiser than Amr&acirc;n's Son<SUP>[2]</SUP> art thou,<BR>
who ken'st so well the world-to-be,<BR>
The Future when the Past is not,<BR>
the Present merest dreamery;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The "Philister" of "respectable" belief.</P>
<P>2. Moses in the Koran.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 17}</P>
<P>What know'st thou, man, of Life?<BR>
and yet, forever twixt the womb, the grave,<BR>
Thou pratest of the Coming Life,<BR>
of Heav'n and Hell thou fain must rave.</P>
<P>The world is old and thou art young;<BR>
the world is large and thou art small;<BR>
Cease, atom of a moment's span,<BR>
To hold thyself an All-in-All!</P>
<P>{p. 18}</P>
