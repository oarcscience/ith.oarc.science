<P>ALL Faith is false, all Faith is true:<BR>
Truth is the shattered mirror strown<BR>
In myriad bits; while each believes<BR>
his little bit the whole to own.</P>
<P>What is the Truth? was askt of yore.<BR>
Reply all object Truth is one<BR>
As twain of halves aye makes a whole;<BR>
the moral Truth for all is none.</P>
<P>Ye scantly-learned Z&acirc;hids learn<BR>
from Aflat&ucirc;n and Arist&ucirc;,<SUP>[1]</SUP><BR>
While Truth is real like your good:<BR>
th' Untrue, like ill, is real too;</P>
<P>As palace mirror'd in the stream,<BR>
as vapour mingled with the skies,<BR>
So weaves the brain of mortal man<BR>
the tangled web of Truth and Lies.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Plato and Aristotle.]</P>
</FONT><P>What see we here? Forms, nothing more!<BR>
Forms fill the brightest, strongest eye,<BR>
We know not substance; 'mid the shades<BR>
shadows ourselves we live and die.</P>
<P>"Faith mountains move" I hear:<BR>
I see the practice of the world unheed<BR>
The foolish vaunt, the blatant boast<BR>
that serves our vanity to feed.</P>
<P>"Faith stands unmoved;" and why?<BR>
Because man's silly fancies still remain,<BR>
And will remain till wiser man<BR>
the day-dreams of his youth disdain.</P>
<P>"'Tis bless&egrave;d to believe;" you say:<BR>
The saying may be true enow<BR>
And it can add to Life a light:--<BR>
only remains to show us how.</P>
<P>E'en if I could I nould believe<BR>
your tales and fables stale and trite,<BR>
Irksome as twice-sung tune that tires<BR>
the dull&egrave;d ear of drowsy wight.</P>
<P>{p. 43}</P>
<P>With God's foreknowledge man's free will!<BR>
what monster-growth of human brain,<BR>
What powers of light shall ever pierce<BR>
this puzzle dense with words inane?</P>
<P>Vainly the heart on Providence calls,<BR>
such aid to seek were hardly wise<BR>
For man must own the pitiless Law<BR>
that sways the globe and sevenfold skies.</P>
<P>"Be ye Good Boys, go seek for Heav'en,<BR>
come pay the priest that holds the key;"<BR>
So spake, and speaks, and aye shall speak<BR>
the last to enter Heaven,--he.</P>
<P>Are these the words for men to hear?<BR>
yet such the Church's general tongue,<BR>
The horseleech-cry so strong so high<BR>
her heav'enward Psalms and Hymns among.</P>
<P>What? Faith a merit and a claim,<BR>
when with the brain 'tis born and bred?<BR>
Go, fool, thy foolish way and dip<BR>
in holy water buri&egrave;d dead!</P>
<P>{p. 44}</P>
<P>Yet follow not th' unwisdom-path,<BR>
cleave not to this and that disclaim;<BR>
Believe in all that man believes;<BR>
here all and naught are both the same.</P>
<P>But is it so? How may we know?<BR>
Haply this Fate, this Law may be<BR>
A word, a sound, a breath; at most<BR>
the Z&acirc;hid's moonstruck theory.</P>
<P>Yes Truth may be, but 'tis not Here;<BR>
mankind must seek and find it There,<BR>
But Where nor I nor you can tell,<BR>
nor aught earth-mother ever bare.</P>
<P>Enough to think that Truth can be:<BR>
come sit we where the roses glow,<BR>
Indeed he knows not how to know<BR>
who knows not also how to 'unknow.</P>
<P>{p. 45}</P>
