<P>FIE, fie! you visionary things,<BR>
ye motes that dance in sunny glow,<BR>
Who base and build Eternities<BR>
on briefest moment here below;</P>
<P>Who pass through Life liked cag&egrave;d birds,<BR>
the captives of a despot will;<BR>
Still wond'ring How and When and Why,<BR>
and Whence and Whither, wond'ring still;</P>
<P>Still wond'ring how the Marvel came<BR>
because two coupling mammals chose<BR>
To slake the thirst of fleshly love,<BR>
and thus the "Immortal Being" rose;</P>
<P>Wond'ring the Babe with staring eyes,<BR>
perforce compel'd from night to day,<BR>
Gript in the giant grasp of Life<BR>
like gale-born dust or wind-wrung spray;</P>
<P>{p. 19}</P>
<P>Who comes imbecile to the world<BR>
'mid double danger, groans, and tears;<BR>
The toy, the sport, the waif and stray<BR>
of passions, error, wrath and fears;</P>
<P>Who knows not Whence he came nor Why,<BR>
who kens not Whither bound and When,<BR>
Yet such is Allah's choicest gift,<BR>
the blessing dreamt by foolish men;</P>
<P>Who step by step perforce returns<BR>
to couthless youth, wan, white and cold,<BR>
Lisping again his broken words<BR>
till all the tale be fully told:</P>
<P>Wond'ring the Babe with quench&egrave;d orbs,<BR>
an oldster bow'd by burthening years,<BR>
How 'scaped the skiff an hundred storms;<BR>
how 'scaped the thread a thousand shears;</P>
<P>How coming to the Feast unbid,<BR>
he found the gorgeous table spread<BR>
With the fair-seeming Sodom-fruit,<BR>
with stones that bear the shape of bread:</P>
<P>{p. 20}</P>
<P>How Life was nought but ray of sun<BR>
that clove the darkness thick and blind,<BR>
The ravings of the reckless storm,<BR>
the shrieking of the rav'ening wind;</P>
<P>How lovely visions 'guiled his sleep,<BR>
aye fading with the break of morn,<BR>
Till every sweet became a sour,<BR>
till every rose became a thorn;</P>
<P>Till dust and ashes met his eyes<BR>
wherever turned their saddened gaze;<BR>
The wrecks of joys and hopes and loves,<BR>
the rubbish of his wasted days;</P>
<P>How every high heroic Thought<BR>
that longed to breathe empyrean air,<BR>
Failed of its feathers, fell to earth,<BR>
and perisht of a sheer despair;</P>
<P>How, dower'd with heritage of brain,<BR>
whose might has split the solar ray,<BR>
His rest is grossest coarsest earth,<BR>
a crown of gold on brow of clay;</P>
<P>{p. 21}</P>
<P>This House whose frame be flesh and bone,<BR>
mortar'd with blood and faced with skin,<BR>
The home of sickness, dolours, age;<BR>
unclean without, impure within:</P>
<P>Sans ray to cheer its inner gloom,<BR>
the chambers haunted by the Ghost,<BR>
Darkness his name, a cold dumb Shade<BR>
stronger than all the heav'nly host.</P>
<P>This tube, an enigmatic pipe,<BR>
whose end was laid before begun,<BR>
That lengthens, broadens, shrinks and breaks;<BR>
--puzzle, machine, automaton;</P>
<P>The first of Pots the Potter made<BR>
by Chrysorrhoas' blue-green wave;<SUP>[1]</SUP><BR>
Methinks I see him smile to see<BR>
what guerdon to the world he gave!</P>
<P>How Life is dim, unreal, vain,<BR>
like scenes that round the drunkard reel;<BR>
How "Being" meaneth not to be;<BR>
to see and hear, smell, taste and feel.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Abana, River of Damascus.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 22}</P>
<P>A drop in Ocean's boundless tide,<BR>
unfathom'd waste of agony;<BR>
Where millions live their horrid lives<BR>
by making other millions die.</P>
<P>How with a heart that would through love<BR>
to Universal Love aspire,<BR>
Man woos infernal chance to smite,<BR>
as Min'arets draw the thunder-fire.</P>
<P>How Earth on Earth builds tow'er and wall,<BR>
to crumble at a touch of Time;<BR>
How Earth on Earth from Sh&icirc;nar-plain<BR>
the heights of Heaven fain would climb.</P>
<P>How short this Life., how long withal;<BR>
how false its weal, how true its woes,<BR>
This fever-fit with paroxysms<BR>
to mark its opening and its close.</P>
<P>Ah! gay the day with shine of sun,<BR>
and bright the breeze, and blithe the throng<BR>
Met on the River-bank to play,<BR>
when I was young, when I was young:</P>
<P>{p. 23}</P>
<P>Such general joy could never fade;<BR>
and yet the chilling whisper came<BR>
One face had paled, one form had failed;<BR>
had fled the bank, had swum the stream;</P>
<P>Still revellers danced, and sang, and trod<BR>
the hither bank of Time's deep tide,<BR>
Still one by one they left and fared<BR>
to the far misty thither side;</P>
<P>And now the last hath slipt away<BR>
yon drear death-desert to explore,<BR>
And now one Pilgrim worn and lorn<BR>
still lingers on the lonely shore.</P>
<P>Yes, Life in youth-tide standeth still;<BR>
in manhood streameth soft and slow;<BR>
See, as it nears the 'abysmal goal<BR>
how fleet the waters flash and flow!</P>
<P>And Deaths are twain; the Deaths we see<BR>
drop like the leaves in windy Fall;<BR>
But ours, our own, are ruined worlds,<BR>
a globe collapst, last end of all.</P>
<P>{p. 24}</P>
<P>We live our lives with rogues and fools,<BR>
dead and alive, alive and dead,<BR>
We die 'twixt one who feels the pulse<BR>
and one who frets and clouds the head.</P>
<P>And,--oh, the Pity!--hardly conned<BR>
the lesson comes its fatal term;<BR>
Fate bids us bundle up our books,<BR>
and bear them bod'ily to the worm:</P>
<P>Hardly we learn to wield the blade<BR>
before the wrist grows stiff and old;<BR>
Hardly we learn to ply the pen<BR>
ere Thought and Fancy faint with cold.</P>
<P>Hardly we find the path of love,<BR>
to sink the self, forget the "I,"<BR>
When sad suspicion grips the heart,<BR>
when Man, <I>the</I> Man begins to die:</P>
<P>Hardly we scale the wisdom-heights,<BR>
and sight the Pisgah-scene around,<BR>
And breathe the breath of heav'enly air,<BR>
and hear the Spheres' harmonious sound;</P>
<P>{p. 25}</P>
<P>When swift the Camel-rider spans<BR>
the howling waste, by Kismet sped,<BR>
And of his Magic Wand a wave<BR>
hurries the quick to join the dead.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><P>How sore the burden, strange the strife;<BR>
how full of splendour, wonder, fear;<BR>
Life, atom of that Infinite Space<BR>
that stretcheth 'twixt the Here and There.</P>
<P>How Thought is imp'otent to divine<BR>
the secret which the gods defend,<BR>
The Why of birth and life and death,<BR>
that Isis-veil no hand may rend.</P>
<P>Eternal Morrows make our day;<BR>
our <I>is</I>&nbsp;is aye <I>to be</I> till when<BR>
Night closes in; 'tis all a dream,,<BR>
and yet we die,--and then and THEN?</P>
<P>And still the Weaver plies his loom,<BR>
whose warp and woof is wretched Man<BR>
Weaving th' unpattern'd dark design,<BR>
so dark we doubt it owns a plan.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Death in Arabia rides a Camel, not a pale horse.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 26}</P>
<P>Dost not, O Maker, blush to hear,<BR>
amid the storm of tears and blood,<BR>
Man say Thy mercy made what is,<BR>
and saw the made and said 'twas good?</P>
<P>The marvel is that man can smile<BR>
dreaming his ghostly ghastly dream;-<BR>
Better the heedless atomy<BR>
that buzzes in the morning beam!</P>
<P>O the dread pathos of our lives!<BR>
how durst thou, Allah, thus to play<BR>
With Love, Affection, Friendship,<BR>
all that shows the god in mortal clay.</P>
<P>But ah! what 'vaileth man to mourn;<BR>
shall tears bring forth what smiles ne'er brought;<BR>
Shall brooding breed a thought of joy?<BR>
Ah hush the sigh, forget the thought!</P>
<P>Silence thine immemorial quest,<BR>
contain thy nature's vain complaint<BR>
None heeds, none cares for thee or thine;<BR>
like thee how many came and went?</P>
<P>{p. 27}</P>
<P>Cease, Man, to mourn, to weep, to wail;<BR>
enjoy thy shining hour of sun;<BR>
We dance along Death's icy brink,<BR>
but is the dance less full of fun?</P>
<P>{p. 28}</P>
