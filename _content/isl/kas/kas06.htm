<P>WHAT Truths hath gleaned that Sage consumed<BR>
by many a moon that waxt and waned?<BR>
What Prophet-strain be his to sing?<BR>
What hath his old Experience gained?</P>
<P>There is no God, no man-made God;<BR>
a bigger, stronger, crueller man;<BR>
Black phantom of our baby-fears,<BR>
ere Thought, the life of Life, began.</P>
<P>Right quoth the Hindu Prince of old,<SUP>[1]</SUP><BR>
"An Ishwara for one I nill,<BR>
Th' almighty everlasting Good<BR>
who cannot 'bate th' Eternal ill:"</P>
<P>"Your gods may be, what shows they are?"<BR>
hear China's Perfect Sage declare;<SUP>[2]</SUP><BR>
"And being, what to us be they<BR>
who dwell so darkly and so far?"</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Buddha.</P>
<P>2. Confucius.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 29}</P>
<P>"All matter hath a birth and death;<BR>
'tis made, unmade and made anew;<BR>
"We choose to call the Maker 'God'"--<BR>
such is the Z&acirc;hid's owly view.</P>
<P>"You changeful finite Creatures strain<BR>
(rejoins the Drawer of the Wine)"<BR>
"The dizzy depths of Infinite Power<BR>
to fathom with your foot of twine;"</P>
<P>"Poor idols of man's heart and head<BR>
with the Divine Idea to blend;<BR>
"To preach as 'Nature's Common Course'<BR>
what any hour may shift or end.</P>
<P>"How shall the Shown pretend to ken<BR>
aught of the Showman or the Show?<BR>
"Why meanly bargain to believe,<BR>
which only means thou ne'er canst know?</P>
<P>"How may the passing Now contain<BR>
the standing Now--Eternity?--<BR>
"An endless <I>is</I> without a <I>was</I>,<BR>
the <I>be</I> and never the <I>to-be?</P>
</I><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Soofi or Gnostic opposed to the Z&acirc;hid.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 30}</P>
<P>"Who made your Maker? If Self-made,<BR>
why fare so far to fare the worse<BR>
"Sufficeth not a world of worlds,<BR>
a self-made chain of universe?</P>
<P>"Grant an Idea, Primal Cause, the Causing Cause,<BR>
why crave for more?<BR>
"Why strive its depth and breadth to mete,<BR>
to trace its work, its aid to 'implore?</P>
<P>"Unknown, Incomprehensible, whate'er<BR>
you choose to call it, call;<BR>
"But leave it vague as airy space,<BR>
dark in its darkness mystical.</P>
<P>"Your childish fears would seek a Sire,<BR>
by the non-human God defin'd,<BR>
"What your five wits may wot ye weet;<BR>
what <I>is</I> you please to dub 'design'd;'</P>
<P>"You bring down Heav'en to vulgar Earth;<BR>
your maker like yourselves you make,<BR>
"You quake to own a reign of Law,<BR>
you pray the Law its laws to break;</P>
<P>{p. 31}</P>
<P>"You pray, but hath your thought e'er weighed<BR>
how empty vain the prayer must be,<BR>
"That begs a boon already giv'en,<BR>
or craves a change of law to see?</P>
<P>"Say, Man, deep learn&egrave;d in the Scheme<BR>
that orders mysteries sublime,<BR>
"How came it this was Jesus, that<BR>
was Judas from the birth of Time?</P>
<P>"How I the tiger, thou the lamb;<BR>
again the Secret, prithee, show<BR>
"Who slew the slain, bowman or bolt<BR>
or Fate that drave the man, the bow?</P>
<P>"Man worships self: his God is Man;<BR>
the struggling of the mortal mind<BR>
"To form its model as 'twould be,<BR>
the perfect of itself to find.</P>
<P>"The God became sage, priest and scribe<BR>
where Nilus' serpent made the vale;<BR>
"A gloomy Brahm in glowing Ind,<BR>
a neutral something cold and pale:</P>
<P>{p. 32}</P>
<P>"Amid the high Chaldean hills<BR>
a moulder of the heavenly spheres;<BR>
"On Guebre steppes the Timeless-God<BR>
who governs by his dual peers:</P>
<P>"In Hebrew tents the Lord that led<BR>
His leprous slaves to fight and jar;<BR>
"Yahveh,<SUP>[1]</SUP> Adon or Elohim,<BR>
the God that smites, the Man of War.</P>
<P>"The lovely Gods of lib'ertine Greece,<BR>
those fair and frail humanities<BR>
"Whose homes o'erlook'd the Middle Sea,<BR>
where all Earth's beauty cradled lies,</P>
<P>"Ne'er left its bless&egrave;d bounds, nor sought<BR>
the barb'arous climes of barb'arous gods<BR>
"Where Odin of the dreary North<BR>
o'er hog and sickly mead-cup nods:</P>
<P>"And when, at length, 'Great Pan is dead,<BR>
uprose the loud and dol'orous cry<BR>
"A glamour wither'd on the ground,<BR>
a splendour faded in the sky.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Jehovah.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 33}</P>
<P>"Yea, Pan was dead, the Nazar'ene came<BR>
and seized his seat beneath the sun,<BR>
The votary of the Riddle-god,<BR>
whose one is three and three is one;</P>
<P>"Whose sadd'ening creed of herited Sin<BR>
spilt o'er the world its cold grey spell;<BR>
"In every vista showed a grave,<BR>
and 'neath the grave the glare of Hell;</P>
<P>"Till all Life's Po'esy sinks to prose;<BR>
romance to dull Real'ity fades;<BR>
"Earth's flush of gladness pales in gloom<BR>
and God again to man degrades.</P>
<P>"Then the lank Arab foul with sweat,<BR>
the drainer of the camel's dug,<BR>
"Gorged with his leek-green lizard's meat,<BR>
clad in his filthy rag and rug,</P>
<P>"Bore his fierce Allah o'er his sands<BR>
and broke, like lava-burst upon<BR>
"The realms where reigned pre-Adamite Kings,<BR>
where rose the Grand Kay&acirc;nian throne.<SUP>[1]</P>
</SUP><FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Kay&acirc;ni--of the race of Cyrus; old Guebre heroes.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 36}</P>
<P>"Who now of ancient Kayomurs,<BR>
of Z&acirc;l or Rustam cares to sing,<BR>
"Whelmed by the tempest of the tribes<BR>
that called the Camel-driver King?</P>
<P>Where are the crown of Kay Khusraw,<BR>
the sceptre of An&ucirc;shirw&acirc;n,<BR>
"The holy grail of high Jamsh&icirc;d,<BR>
Afr&acirc;siyab's hall?--Canst tell me, man?</P>
<P>"Gone, gone, where 1 and thou must go,<BR>
borne by the winnowing wings of Death,<BR>
"The Horror brooding over fife,<BR>
and nearer brought with every breath:</P>
<P>"Their fame hath filled the Seven Climes,<BR>
they rose and reigned, they fought and fell,<BR>
"As swells and swoons across the wold<BR>
the tinkling of the Camel's bell.</P>
<P>{p. 35}</P>
