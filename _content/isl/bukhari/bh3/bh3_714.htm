My father told me that Hakim bin Hizam manumitted one-hundred slaves 
in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance and slaughtered one-hundred 
camels (and distributed them in charity). When he embraced Islam he 
again slaughtered one-hundred camels and manumitted one-hundred 
slaves. Hakim said, "I asked Allah's Apostle, 'O Allah's Apostle! What
do you think about some good deeds I used to practice in the 
prelslamic period of ignorance regarding them as deeds of 
righteousness?' Allah's Apostle said, "You have embraced Islam along 
with all those good deeds you did."
