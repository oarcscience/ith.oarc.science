<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:66</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Hunain:</I></P>
Abdullah bin Al-Abbas and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama differed at Al-Abwa';
Ibn 'Abbas said that a Muhrim could wash his head; while Al-Miswar 
maintained that he should not do so. 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas sent me to 
Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari and I found him bathing between the two wooden 
posts (of the well) and was screened with a sheet of cloth. I greeted 
him and he asked who I was. I replied, "I am 'Abdullah bin Hunain and 
I have been sent to you by Ibn 'Abbas to ask you how Allah's Apostle 
used to wash his head while in the state of lhram." Abu Aiyub 
Al-Ansarl caught hold of the sheet of cloth and lowered it till his 
head appeared before me, and then told somebody to pour water on his 
head. He poured water on his head, and he (Abu Aiyub) rubbed his head 
with his hands by bringing them from back to front and from front to 
back and said, "I saw the Prophet doing like this."
