<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:418</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "While three persons were walking, rain began to 
fall and they had to enter a cave in a mountain. A big rock rolled 
over and blocked the mouth of the cave. They said to each other, 
'Invoke Allah with the best deed you have performed (so Allah might 
remove the rock)'. One of them said, 'O Allah! My parents were old and
I used to go out for grazing (my animals). On my return I would milk 
(the animals) and take the milk in a vessel to my parents to drink. 
After they had drunk from it, I would give it to my children, family 
and wife. One day I was delayed and on my return I found my parents 
sleeping, and I disliked to wake them up. The children were crying at 
my feet (because of hunger). That state of affairs continued till it 
was dawn. O Allah! If You regard that I did it for Your sake, then 
please remove this rock so that we may see the sky.' So, the rock was 
moved a bit. The second said, 'O Allah! You know that I was in love 
with a cousin of mine, like the deepest love a man may have for a 
woman, and she told me that I would not get my desire fulfilled unless
I paid her one-hundred Dinars (gold pieces). So, I struggled for it 
till I gathered the desired amount, and when I sat in between her 
legs, she told me to be afraid of Allah, and asked me not to deflower 
her except rightfully (by marriage). So, I got up and left her. O 
Allah! If You regard that I did if for Your sake, kindly remove this 
rock.' So, two-thirds of the rock was removed. Then the third man 
said, 'O Allah! No doubt You know that once I employed a worker for 
one Faraq (three Sa's) of millet, and when I wanted to pay him, he 
refused to take it, so I sowed it and from its yield I bought cows and
a shepherd. After a time that man came and demanded his money. I said 
to him: Go to those cows and the shepherd and take them for they are 
for you. He asked me whether I was joking with him. I told him that I 
was not joking with him, and all that belonged to him. O Allah! If You
regard that I did it sincerely for Your sake, then please remove the 
rock.' So, the rock was removed completely from the mouth of the 
cave."
