<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:199</H3><P><I>Narrated Mujahid from 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:</I></P>
The Prophet said (to 'Abdullah), "Fast three days a month." 'Abdullah 
said, (to the Prophet) "I am able to fast more than that." They kept 
on arguing on this matter till the Prophet said, "Fast on alternate 
days, and recite the whole Qur'an once a month." 'Abdullah said, "I 
can recite more (in a month)," and the argument went on till the 
Prophet said, "Recite the Qur'an once each three days." (i.e. you must
not recite the whole Qur'an in less than three days).
