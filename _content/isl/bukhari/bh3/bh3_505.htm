Once Bilal brought Barni (i.e. a kind of dates) to the Prophet and the
Prophet asked him, "From where have you brought these?" Bilal replied,
"I had some inferior type of dates and exchanged two Sas of it for one
Sa of Barni dates in order to give it to the Prophet; to eat." 
Thereupon the Prophet said, "Beware! Beware! This is definitely Riba 
(usury)! This is definitely Riba (Usury)! Don't do so, but if you want
to buy (a superior kind of dates) sell the inferior dates for money 
and then buy the superior kind of dates with that money."
