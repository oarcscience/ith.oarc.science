### Hadith 3:595

*Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:*

While Allah's Apostle was sitting, a Jew came and said, "O Abul Qasim!
One of your companions has slapped me on my face." The Prophet asked who
that was. He replied that he was one of the Ansar. The Prophet sent for
him, and on his arrival, he asked him whether he had beaten the Jew. He
(replied in the affirmative and) said, "I heard him taking an oath in
the market saying, 'By Him Who gave Moses superiority over all the human
beings.' I said, 'O wicked man! (Has Allah given Moses superiority) even
over Muhammad I became furious

and slapped him over his face." The Prophet said, "Do not give a prophet
superiority over another, for on the Day of Resurrection all the people
will fall unconscious and I will be the first to emerge from the earth,
and will see Moses standing and holding one of the legs of the Throne. I
will not know whether Moses has fallen unconscious or the first
unconsciousness was sufficient for him."
