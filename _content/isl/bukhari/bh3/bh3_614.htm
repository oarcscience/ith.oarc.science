<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:615</H3><P><I>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:</I></P>
A man asked Allah's Apostle about the Luqata. He said, "Make public 
announcement of it for one year, then remember the description of its 
container and the string it is tied with, utilize the money, and if 
its owner comes back after that, give it to him." The people asked, "O
Allah's Apostle! What about a lost sheep?" Allah's Apostle said, "Take
it, for it is for you, for your brother, or for the wolf." The man 
asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What about a lost camel?" Allah's Apostle 
got angry and his cheeks or face became red, and said, "You have no 
concern with it as it has its feet, and its water-container, till its 
owner finds it."
