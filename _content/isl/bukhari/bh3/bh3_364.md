### Hadith 3:367

*Narrated Tawus:*

Ibn 'Abbas said, "Allah's Apostle said, 'Do not go to meet the caravans
on the way (for buying their goods without letting them know the market
price); a town dweller should not sell the goods of a desert dweller on
behalf of the latter.' I asked Ibn 'Abbas, 'What does he mean by not
selling the goods of a desert dweller by a town dweller?' He said, 'He
should not become his broker.' "

[Next: 3:368: 'Abdullah bin Umar: Allah's Apostle forbade the selling of
the goods of a desert dweller ...](bh3_365)
