<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:333</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira Ad-Dausi:</I></P>
Once the Prophet went out during the day. Neither did he talk to me 
nor I to him till he reached the market of Bani Qainuqa and then he 
sat in the compound of Fatima's house and asked about the small boy 
(his grandson Al-Hasan) but Fatima kept the boy in for a while. I 
thought she was either changing his clothes or giving the boy a bath. 
After a while the boy came out running and the Prophet embraced and 
kissed him and then said, 'O Allah! Love him, and love whoever loves 
him.'
