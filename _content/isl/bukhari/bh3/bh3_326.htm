<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:329</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "An army will invade the Ka'ba and when the 
invaders reach Al-Baida', all the ground will sink and swallow the 
whole army." I said, "O Allah's Apostle! How will they sink into the 
ground while amongst them will be their markets (the people who worked
in business and not invaders) and the people not belonging to them?" 
The Prophet replied, "all of those people will sink but they will be 
resurrected and judged according to their intentions."
