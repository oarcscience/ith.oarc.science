### Hadith 3:805

*Narrated Urwa bin Al-Musayyab, Alqama bin Waqqas and Ubaidullah bin*

Abdullah:

About the story of 'Aisha and their narrations were similar attesting
each other, when the liars said what they invented about 'Aisha, and the
Divine Inspiration was delayed, Allah's Apostle sent for 'Ali and Usama
to consult them in divorcing his wife (i.e. 'Aisha). Usama said, "Keep
your wife, as we know nothing about her except good." Buraira said, "I
cannot accuse her of any defect except that she is still a young girl
who sleeps, neglecting her family's dough which the domestic goats come
to eat (i.e. she was too simpleminded to deceive her husband)." Allah's
Apostle said, "Who can help me to take revenge over the man who has
harmed me by defaming the reputation of my family? By Allah, I have not
known about my family-anything except good, and they mentioned (i.e.
accused) a man about whom I did not know anything except good."
