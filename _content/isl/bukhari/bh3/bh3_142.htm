<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:145</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah:</I></P>
The Prophet fasted for days continuously; the people also did the same
but it was difficult for them. So, the Prophet forbade them (to fast 
continuously for more than one day). They slid, "But you fast without 
break (no food was taken in the evening or in the morning)." The 
Prophet replied, "I am not like you, for I am provided with food and 
drink (by Allah)."
