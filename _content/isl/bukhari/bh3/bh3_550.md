### Hadith 3:551

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "While a man was walking he felt thirsty and went
down a well and drank water from it. On coming out of it, he saw a dog
panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, 'This
(dog) is suffering from the same problem as that of mine. So he (went
down the well), filled his shoe with water, caught hold of it with his
teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked him for his
(good) deed and forgave him." The people asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Is
there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?" He replied, "Yes, there
is a reward for serving any animate."
