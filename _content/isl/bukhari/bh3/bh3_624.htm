<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:625</H3><P><I>Narrated Muawiya bin Suwald:</I></P>
I heard Al-Bara' bin 'Azib saying, "The Prophet orders us to do seven 
things and prohibited us from doing seven other things." Then Al-Bara'
mentioned the following:--
<P>
(1) To pay a visit to the sick (inquiring about his health),
<P>
(2) to follow funeral processions,
<P>
(3) to say to a sneezer, "May Allah be merciful to you" (if he says, 
"Praise be to Allah!"),
<P>
(4) to return greetings,
<P>
(5) to help the oppressed,
<P>
(6) to accept invitations,
<P>
(7) to help others to fulfill their oaths. (See 
Hadith No. 753, Vol. 7)
