<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:121</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever gives two kinds (of things or property)
in charity for Allah's Cause, will be called from the gates of 
Paradise and will be addressed, 'O slaves of Allah! Here is 
prosperity.' So, whoever was amongst the people who used to offer 
their prayers, will be called from the gate of the prayer; and whoever
was amongst the people who used to participate in Jihad, will be 
called from the gate of Jihad; and whoever was amongst those who used 
to observe fasts, will be called from the gate of Ar-Raiyan; whoever 
was amongst those who used to give in charity, will be called from the
gate of charity." Abu Bakr said, "Let my parents be sacrificed for 
you, O Allah's Apostle! No distress or need will befall him who will 
be called from those gates. Will there be any one who will be called 
from all these gates?" The Prophet replied, "Yes, and I hope you will 
be one of them."
