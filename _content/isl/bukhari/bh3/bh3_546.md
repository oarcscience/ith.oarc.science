### Hadith 3:547

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "There are three persons whom Allah will not look
at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will he purify them and theirs shall
be a severe punishment. They are:

1\. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he withheld it from
travelers.

2\. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he gave it only
for worldly benefits. If the ruler gives him something he gets
satisfied, and if the ruler withholds something from him, he gets
dissatisfied.

3\. And man displayed his goods for sale after the 'Asr prayer and he
said, 'By Allah, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I have
been given so much for my goods,' and somebody believes him (and buys
them)."

The Prophet then recited: "Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at
the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths." (3.77)
