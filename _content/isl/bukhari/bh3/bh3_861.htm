<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:862</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Bara bin 'Azib:</I></P>
When Allah's Apostle concluded a peace treaty with the people of 
Hudaibiya, Ali bin Abu Talib wrote the document and he mentioned in 
it, "Muhammad, Allah's Apostle ." The pagans said, "Don't write: 
'Muhammad, Allah's Apostle', for if you were an apostle we would not 
fight with you." Allah's Apostle asked Ali to rub it out, but Ali 
said, "I will not be the person to rub it out." Allah's Apostle rubbed
it out and made peace with them on the condition that the Prophet and 
his companions would enter Mecca and stay there for three days, and 
that they would enter with their weapons in cases.
