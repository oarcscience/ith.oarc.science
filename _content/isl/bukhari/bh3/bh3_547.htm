An Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair in the presence of the Prophet
about the Harra Canals which were used for irrigating the date-palms. 
The Ansari man said to Az-Zubair, "Let the water pass' but Az-Zubair 
refused to do so. So, the case was brought before the Prophet who said
to Az-Zubair, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then let the water 
pass to your neighbor." On that the Ansari got angry and said to the 
Prophet, "Is it because he (i.e. Zubair) is your aunt's son?" On that 
the color of the face of Allah's Apostle changed (because of anger) 
and he said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the 
water till it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees." 
Zubair said, "By Allah, I think that the following verse was revealed 
on this occasion": "But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until 
they make you judge In all disputes between them." (4.65)
