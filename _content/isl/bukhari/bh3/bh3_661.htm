<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:662</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "There was an Israeli man called Juraij, while 
he was praying, his mother came and called him, but he did not respond
to her call. He said (to himself) whether he should continue the 
prayer or reply to his mother. She came to him the second time and 
called him and said, "O Allah! Do not let him die until he sees the 
faces of prostitutes." Juraij used to live in a hermitage. A woman 
said that she would entice Juraij, so she went to him and presented 
herself (for an evil act) but he refused. She then went to a shepherd 
and allowed him to commit an illegal sexual intercourse with her and 
later she gave birth to a boy. She alleged that the baby was from 
Juraij. The people went to Juraij and broke down his hermitage, pulled
him out of it and abused him. He performed ablution and offered the 
prayer, then he went to the male (baby) and asked him; "O boy! Who is 
your father?" The baby replied that his father was the shepherd. The 
people said that they would build for him a hermitage of gold but 
Juraij asked them to make it of mud only."
