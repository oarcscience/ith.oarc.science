Ibn Abbas said, "In the verse: To every one We have appointed ' 
(Muwaliya Mawaliya means one's) heirs (4.33).' (And regarding the 
verse) 'And those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.' Ibn 
'Abbas said, "When the emigrants came to the Prophet in Medina, the 
emigrant would inherit the Ansari while the latter's relatives would 
not inherit him because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet 
established between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the 
verse: 'And to everyone We have appointed heirs' (4.33) was revealed, 
it cancelled (the bond (the pledge) of brotherhood regarding 
inheritance)." Then he said, "The verse: To those also to whom your 
right hands have pledged, remained valid regarding co-operation and 
mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it 
became permissible to assign something in one's testament to the 
person who had the right of inheriting before.
