That 'Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad Al-Aslami owed him some debt. Ka'b met 
him and caught hold of him and they started talking and their voices 
grew loudest. The Prophet passed by them and addressed Ka'b, pointing 
out to him to reduce the debt to one half. So, Ka'b got one half of 
the debt and exempted the debtor from the other half.
