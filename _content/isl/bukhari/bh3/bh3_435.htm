<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:438</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
I heard Allah's Apostle, in the year of the Conquest of Mecca, saying,
"Allah and His Apostle made illegal the trade of alcohol, dead 
animals, pigs and idols." The people asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What 
about the fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats 
and the hides; and people use it for lights?" He said, "No, it is 
illegal." Allah's Apostle further said, "May Allah curse the Jews, for
Allah made the fat (of animals) illegal for them, yet they melted the 
fat and sold it and ate its price."
