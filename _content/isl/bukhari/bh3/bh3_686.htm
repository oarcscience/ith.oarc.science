Allah's Apostle said, "Who would kill Ka'b bin Al-Ashraf as he has 
harmed Allah and His Apostle ?" Muhammad bin Maslama (got up and) 
said, "I will kill him." So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to Ka'b and 
said, "I want a loan of one or two Wasqs of food grains." Ka'b said, 
"Mortgage your women to me." Muhammad bin Maslama said, "How can we 
mortgage our women, and you are the most handsome among the Arabs?" He
said, "Then mortgage your sons to me." Muhammad said, "How can we 
mortgage our sons, as the people will abuse them for being mortgaged 
for one or two Wasqs of food grains? It is shameful for us. But we 
will mortgage our arms to you." So, Muhammad bin Maslama promised him 
that he would come to him next time. They (Muhammad bin Maslama and 
his companions came to him as promised and murdered him. Then they 
went to the Prophet and told him about it.
