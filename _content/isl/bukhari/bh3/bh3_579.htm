<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:580</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud, and he was 
in debt. His creditors demanded their rights persistently. I went to 
the Prophet (and informed him about it). He told them to take the 
fruits of my garden and exempt my father from the debts but they 
refused to do so. So, the Prophet did not give them my garden and told
me that he would come to me the next morning. He came to us early in 
the morning and wandered among the datepalms and invoked Allah to 
bless their fruits. I then plucked the dates and paid the creditors, 
and there remained some of the dates for us.
