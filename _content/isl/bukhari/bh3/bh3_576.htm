<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:577</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
A man came to the Prophet and demanded a camel (the Prophet owed him).
Allah's Apostle told his companions to give him (a camel). They said, 
"We do not find except an older camel (than what he demands). (The 
Prophet ordered them to give him that camel). The man said, "You have 
paid me in full and may Allah also pay you in full." Allah's Apostle 
said, "Give him, for the best amongst the people is he who repays his 
debts in the most handsome manner."
