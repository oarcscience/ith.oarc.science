<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:739</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdul Wahid bin Aiman:</I></P>
I went to 'Aisha and said, "I was the slave of Utba bin Abu Lahab. 
"Utba died and his sons became my masters who sold me to Ibn Abu Amr 
who manumitted me. The sons of 'Utba stipulated that my Wala' should 
be for them." 'Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and she was given the 
writing of emancipation by her masters and she asked me to buy and 
manumit her. I agreed to it, but Buraira told me that her masters 
would not sell her unless her Wala' was for them." 'Aisha said, "I am 
not in need of that." When the Prophet heard that, or he was told 
about it, he asked 'Aisha about it. 'Aisha mentioned what Buraira had 
told her. The Prophet said, "Buy and manumit her and let them 
stipulate whatever they like." So, 'Aisha bought and manumitted her 
and her masters stipulated that her Wala' should be for them." The 
Prophet;, said, "The Wala' will be for the liberator even if they 
stipulated a hundred conditions."
