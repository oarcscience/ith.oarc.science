The Prophet came to Medina and ordered a mosque to be built and said, 
"O Bani Najjar! Suggest to me the price (of your land)." They said, 
"We do not want its price except from Allah" (i.e. they wished for a 
reward from Allah for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet 
ordered the graves of the pagans to be dug out and the land to be 
levelled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut date-palms 
were fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.
