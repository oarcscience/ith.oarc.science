<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:573</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Dhar:</I></P>
Once, while I was in the company of the Prophet, he saw the mountain 
of Uhud and said, "I would not like to have this mountain turned into 
gold for me unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of 
it with me for more than three days (i.e. I will spend all of it in 
Allah's Cause), except that Dinar which I will keep for repaying 
debts." Then he said, "Those who are rich in this world would have 
little reward in the Hereafter except those who spend their money here
and there (in Allah's Cause), and they are few in number." Then he 
ordered me to stay at my place and went not far away. I heard a voice 
and intended to go to him but I remembered his order, "Stay at your 
place till I return." On his return I said, "O Allah's Apostle! (What 
was) that noise which I heard?" He said, "Did you hear anything?" I 
said, "Yes." He said, "Gabriel came and said to me, 'Whoever amongst 
your followers dies, worshipping none along with Allah, will enter 
Paradise.' " I said, "Even if he did such-and-such things (i.e. even 
if he stole or committed illegal sexual intercourse)" He said, "Yes."
