<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:158</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
A man came to the Prophet and said, "I had sexual intercourse with my 
wife on Ramadan (while fasting)." The Prophet asked him, "Can you 
afford to manumit a slave?" He replied in the negative. The Prophet 
asked him, "Can you fast for two successive months?" He replied in the
negative. He asked him, "Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?" 
He replied in the negative. (Abu Huraira added): Then a basket full of
dates was brought to the Prophet and he said (to that man), "Feed 
(poor people) with this by way of atonement." He said, "(Should I feed
it) to poorer people than we? There is no poorer house than ours 
between its (Medina's) mountains." The Prophet said, "Then feed your 
family with it."
