### Hadith 3:655

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "When an adulterer commits illegal sexual intercourse,
then he is not a believer at the time, he is doing it, and when a
drinker of an alcoholic liquor drinks it, then he is not a believer at
the time of drinking it, and when a thief steals, then he is not a
believer at the time of stealing, and when a robber robs, and the people
