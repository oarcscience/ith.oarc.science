### Hadith 3:269

*Narrated Aisha:*

Utba bin Abu Waqqas took a firm promise from his brother Sad bin Abu
Waqqas to take the son of the slave-girl of Zam'a into his custody as he
was his (i.e. 'Utba's) son. In the year of the Conquest (of Mecca) Sad
bin Abu Waqqas took him, and said that he was his brother's son, and his
brother took a promise from him to that effect. 'Abu bin Zam'a got up
and said, "He is my brother and the son of the slave-girl of my father
and was born on my father's bed." Then they both went to the Prophet Sad
said, "O Allah's Apostle! He is the son of my brother and he has taken a
promise from me that I will take him." 'Abu bin Zam'a said, "(He is) my
brother and the son of my father's slave-girl and was born on my
father's bed." Allah's Apostle said, "The boy is for you. O 'Abu bin
Zam'a." Then the Prophet said, "The son is for the bed (i.e the man on
whose bed he was born) and stones (disappointment and deprivation) for
the one who has done illegal sexual intercourse." The Prophet told his
wife Sauda bint Zam'a to screen herself from that boy as he noticed a
similarity between the boy and 'Utba. So, the boy did not see her till
he died.
