### Hadith 3:459

*Narrated 'Amr bin Ash-Sharid:*

While I was standing with Sad bin Abi Waqqas, Al-Miswar bin Makhrama
came and put his hand on my shoulder. Meanwhile Abu Rafi', the freed
slave of the Prophet came and asked Sad to buy from him the (two)
dwellings which were in his house. Sad said, "By Allah I will not buy
them." Al-Miswar said, "By Allah, you shall buy them." Sad replied, "By
Allah, I will not pay more than four thousand (Dirhams) by
installments." Abu Rafi' said, "I have been offered five hundred Dinars
(for it) and had I not heard the Prophet saying, 'The neighbor has more
right than anyone else because of his nearness, I would not give them to
you for four-thousand (Dirhams) while I am offered five-hundred Dinars
(one Dinar equals ten Dirhams) for them." So, he sold it to Sad.
