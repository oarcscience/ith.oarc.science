### Hadith 3:263

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

You people say that Abu Huraira tells many narrations from Allah's
Apostle and you also wonder why the emigrants and Ansar do not narrate
from Allah's Apostle as Abu Huraira does. My emigrant brothers were busy
in the market while I used to stick to Allah's Apostle content with what
fills my stomach; so I used to be present when they were absent and I
used to remember when they used to forget, and my Ansari brothers used
to be busy with their properties and I was one of the poor men of Suffa.
I used to remember the narrations when they used to forget. No doubt,
Allah's Apostle once said, "Whoever spreads his garment till I have
finished my present speech and then gathers it to himself, will remember
whatever I will say." So, I spread my colored garment which I was
wearing till Allah's Apostle had finished his saying, and then I
gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget any of that narrations.
