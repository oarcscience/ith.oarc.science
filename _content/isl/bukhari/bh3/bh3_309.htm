<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:312</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amr:</I></P>
Here (i.e. in Mecca) there was a man called Nawwas and he had camels 
suffering from the disease of excessive and unquenchable thirst. Ibn 
'Umar went to the partner of Nawwas and bought those camels. The man 
returned to Nawwas and told him that he had sold those camels. Nawwas 
asked him, "To whom have you sold them?" He replied, "To such and such
Sheikh." Nawwas said, "Woe to you; By Allah, that Sheikh was Ibn 
'Umar." Nawwas then went to Ibn 'Umar and said to him, "My partner 
sold you camels suffering from the disease of excessive thirst and he 
had not known you." Ibn 'Umar told him to take them back. When Nawwas 
went to take them, Ibn 'Umar said to him, "Leave them there as I am 
happy with the decision of Allah's Apostle that there is no oppression
. "
