<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:810</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
A funeral procession passed in front of the Prophet and the people 
praised the deceased. The Prophet said, "It has been affirmed 
(Paradise)." Then another funeral procession passed by and the people 
talked badly of the deceased. The Prophet said, "It has been affirmed 
(Hell)." Allah's Apostle was asked, "O Allah's Apostle! You said it 
has been affirmed for both?" The Prophet said, "The testimony of the 
people (is accepted), (for) the believer are Allah's witnesses on the 
earth."
