<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:581</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
When my father died he owed a Jew thirty Awsuq (of dates). I requested
him to give me respite for repaying but he refused. I requested 
Allah's Apostle to intercede with the Jew. Allah's Apostle went to the
Jew and asked him to accept the fruits of my trees in place of the 
debt but the Jew refused. Allah's Apostle entered the garden of the 
date-palms, wandering among the trees and ordered me (saying), "Pluck 
(the fruits) and give him his due." So, I plucked the fruits for him 
after the departure of Allah's Apostle and gave his thirty Awsuq, and 
still had seventeen Awsuq extra for myself. Jabir said: I went to 
Allah's Apostle to inform of what had happened, but found him praying 
the 'Asr prayer. After the prayer I told him about the extra fruits 
which remained. Allah's Apostle told me to inform (Umar) Ibn Al-Khatab
about it. When I went to 'Umar and told him about it, 'Umar said, 
"When Allah's Apostle walked in your garden, I was sure that Allah 
would definitely bless it."
