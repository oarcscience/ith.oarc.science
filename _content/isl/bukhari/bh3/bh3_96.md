### Hadith 3:99

*Narrated Abu Zuhair:*

I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Yemen will be conquered and some people
will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who
will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for
them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will
migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will
obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them;
if they but knew. 'Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate
(from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them
to migrate (to 'Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they
but knew."

and goes back to Medina ...](bh3_97)
