### Hadith 3:177

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abi Aufa"*

We were traveling with Allah's Apostle and he was fasting, and when the
sun set, he said to (someone), "Get down and mix Sawiq with water for
us." He replied, "O Allah's Apostle! (Will you wait) till it is

said again, "Get down and mix Sawiq with water for us." So, he got down
and carried out that order. The Prophet then said, "When you see night
falling from this side, the fasting person should break his fast," and
he beckoned with his finger towards the east.
