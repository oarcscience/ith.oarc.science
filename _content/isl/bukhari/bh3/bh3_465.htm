<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:468</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Your example and the example of the people of the 
two Scriptures (i.e. Jews and Christians) is like the example of a man
who employed some laborers and asked them, 'Who will work for me from 
morning till midday for one Qirat?' The Jews accepted and carried out 
the work. He then asked, Who will work for me from midday up to the 
'Asr prayer for one Qirat?' The Christians accepted and fulfilled the 
work. He then said, 'Who will work for me from the 'Asr till sunset 
for two Qirats?' You, Muslims have accepted the offer. The Jews and 
the Christians got angry and said, 'Why should we work more and get 
lesser wages?' (Allah) said, 'Have I with-held part of your right?' 
They replied in the negative. He said, 'It is My Blessing, I bestow 
upon whomever I wish .'
