<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:871</H3><P><I>Narrated Urwa bin Az-Zubair:</I></P>
Az-Zubair told me that he quarrelled with an Ansari man who had 
participated in (the battle of) Badr in front of Allah's Apostle about
a water stream which both of them used for irrigation. Allah's Apostle
said to Az-Zubair, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your garden) first, and then 
let the water flow to your neighbor." The Ansari became angry and 
said, "O Allah's Apostle! Is it because he is your cousin?" On that 
the complexion of Allah's Apostle changed (because of anger) and said 
(to Az-Zubair), "I irrigate (your garden) and then with-hold the water
till it reaches the walls (surrounding the palms)." So, Allah's 
Apostle  gave Az-Zubair his full right. Before that Allah's Apostle 
had given a generous judgment beneficial for Az-Zubair and the Ansari,
but when the Ansan irritated Allah's Apostle he gave Az-Zubair his 
full right according to the evident law. Az-Zubair said, "By Allah ! I
think the following Verse was revealed concerning that case: "But no 
by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all 
disputes between them." (4.65)
