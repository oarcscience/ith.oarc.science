### Hadith 3:713

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

I bought Buraira but her masters put the condition that her Wala' would
be for them. I told the Prophet about it. He said (to me), "Manumit her
as her Wala' will be for the one who pays the price." So, I manumitted
her. The Prophet called Buraira and gave her the option of either
staying with her husband or leaving him. She said, "Even if he gave me
so much money, I would not stay with him," and so she preferred her
freedom to her husband.
