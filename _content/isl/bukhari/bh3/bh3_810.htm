<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:811</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:</I></P>
Once I went to Medina where there was an outbreak of disease and the 
people were dying rapidly. I was sitting with 'Umar and a funeral 
procession passed by. The people praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It
has been affirmed" (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed 
by. The people praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been 
affirmed." (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed by. The 
people praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed 
(Paradise)." Then a third funeral procession passed by and the people 
talked badly of the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed 
(Hell)." I asked Umar, "O chief of the believers! What has been 
affirmed?" He said, "I have said what the Prophet said. He said, 
'Allah will admit into paradise any Muslim whose good character is 
attested by four persons.' We asked the Prophet, 'If there were three 
witnesses only?' He said, 'Even three.' We asked, 'If there were two 
only?' He said, 'Even two.' But we did not ask him about one 
witness."
