While I was a youngster, I asked 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet. "What
about the meaning of the Statement of Allah;
<P>
"Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols 
of Allah. So, it is not harmful if those who perform Hajj or 'Umra of 
the House (Ka'ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them? 
(2.158) I understand (from that) that there is no harm if somebody 
does not perform the Tawaf between them." 'Aisha replied, "No, for if 
it were as you are saying, then the recitation would have been like 
this: 'It is not harmful not to perform Tawaf between them.' This 
verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the
Ihram for the idol Manat which was put beside a place called Qudaid 
and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As-Safa 
and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Allah's Apostle about that, 
and Allah revealed:--
<P>
"Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of
Allah. So, it is not harmful of those who perform Hajj or 'Umra of the
House (Ka'ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them." 
(2.158)  Sufyan and Abu Muawiya added from Hisham (from 'Aisha): "The 
Hajj or 'Umra of the person who does not perform the going (Tawaf) 
between As-Safa and Al-Marwa is incomplete in Allah's sight.
