<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:17</H3><P><I>Narrated Safwan bin Ya'la bin Umaiya from his father who said:</I></P>
"A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji'rana. The man was 
wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of 
perfume). The man asked (the Prophet ), 'What do you order me to 
perform in my 'Umra?' So, Allah inspired the Prophet divinely and he 
was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being 
divinely inspired. 'Umar said to me, 'Come! Will you be pleased to 
look at the Prophet while Allah is inspiring him?' I replied in the 
affirmative. 'Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the 
Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The 
snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the 
Prophet asked, "Where is the questioner who asked about 'Umra? Put off
your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean
the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in 
your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka'ba and the Sa'i between Safa 
and Marwa). "
