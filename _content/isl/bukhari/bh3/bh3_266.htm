<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:269</H3><P><I>Narrated Aisha:</I></P>
Utba bin Abu Waqqas took a firm promise from his brother Sad bin Abu 
Waqqas to take the son of the slave-girl of Zam'a into his custody as 
he was his (i.e. 'Utba's) son. In the year of the Conquest (of Mecca) 
Sad bin Abu Waqqas took him, and said that he was his brother's son, 
and his brother took a promise from him to that effect. 'Abu bin Zam'a
got up and said, "He is my brother and the son of the slave-girl of my
father and was born on my father's bed." Then they both went to the 
Prophet Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! He is the son of my brother and 
he has taken a promise from me that I will take him." 'Abu bin Zam'a 
said, "(He is) my brother and the son of my father's slave-girl and 
was born on my father's bed." Allah's Apostle said, "The boy is for 
you. O 'Abu bin Zam'a." Then the Prophet said, "The son is for the bed
(i.e the man on whose bed he was born) and stones (disappointment and 
deprivation) for the one who has done illegal sexual intercourse." The
Prophet told his wife Sauda bint Zam'a to screen herself from that boy
as he noticed a similarity between the boy and 'Utba. So, the boy did 
not see her till he died.
