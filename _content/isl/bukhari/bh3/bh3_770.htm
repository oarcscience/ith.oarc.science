<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:771</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle distributed some cloaks but did not give anything 
thereof to Makhrama. Makhrama said (to me), "O son! accompany me to 
Allah's Apostle." When I went with him, he said, "Call him to me." I 
called him (i.e. the Prophet ) for my father. He came out wearing one 
of those cloaks and said, "We kept this (cloak) for you, (Makhrama)." 
Makhrama looked at the cloak and said, "Makhrama is pleased," (or the 
Prophet said), "Is Makhrama pleased?"
