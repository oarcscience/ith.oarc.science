<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:819</H3><P><I>Narrated Zahdam bin Mudrab:</I></P>
I heard Imran bin Husain saying, "The Prophet said, 'The best people 
are those living in my generation, then those coming after them, and 
then those coming after (the second generation)." Imran said "I do not
know whether the Prophet mentioned two or three generations after your
present generation. The Prophet added, 'There will be some people 
after you, who will be dishonest and will not be trustworthy and will 
give witness (evidences) without being asked to give witness, and will
vow but will not fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among 
them."
