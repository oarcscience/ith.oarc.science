Safiya went to the Prophet while he was in Itikaf. When she returned, 
the Prophet accompanied her walking. An Ansari man saw him. When the 
Prophet noticed him, he called him and said, "Come here. She is 
Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet had said,
"This is Safiya"). And Satan circulates in the body of Adam's 
offspring as his blood circulates in it."
<P>
(A sub-narrator asked Sufyan, "Did Safiya visit him at night?" He 
said, "Of course, at night.")
