<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:510</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
I twisted the garlands of the Hadis (i.e. animals for sacrifice) of 
Allah's Apostle with my own hands. Then Allah's Apostle put them 
around their necks with his own hands, and sent them with my father 
(to Mecca). Nothing legal was regarded illegal for Allah's Apostle 
till the animals were slaughtered.
