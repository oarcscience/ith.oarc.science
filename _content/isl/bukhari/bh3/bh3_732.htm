<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:733</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</I></P>
That he heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian 
and is responsible for his charge; the ruler is a guardian and is 
responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his family and 
responsible for his charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband's 
house and responsible for her charges; and the servant is a guardian 
of his master's property and is responsible for his charge." I 
definitely heard the above from the Prophet and think that the Prophet
also said, "A man is a guardian of his father's property and 
responsible for his charges; so everyone of you is a guardian and 
responsible for his charges."
