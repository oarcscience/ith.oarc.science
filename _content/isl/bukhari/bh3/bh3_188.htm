The Prophet never fasted in any month more than in the month of 
Sha'ban. He used to say, "Do those deeds which you can do easily, as 
Allah will not get tired (of giving rewards) till you get bored and 
tired (of performing religious deeds)." The most beloved prayer to the
Prophet was the one that was done regularly (throughout the life) even
if it were little. And whenever the Prophet offered a prayer he used 
to offer it regularly .
