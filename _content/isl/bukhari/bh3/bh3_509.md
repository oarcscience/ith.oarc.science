### Hadith 3:510

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

I twisted the garlands of the Hadis (i.e. animals for sacrifice) of
Allah's Apostle with my own hands. Then Allah's Apostle put them around
their necks with his own hands, and sent them with my father (to Mecca).
Nothing legal was regarded illegal for Allah's Apostle till the animals
were slaughtered.

[Next: 3:511: Anas bin Malik: Abu Talha was the richest man in Medina
amongst the Ansar and Beeruha'...](bh3_510)
