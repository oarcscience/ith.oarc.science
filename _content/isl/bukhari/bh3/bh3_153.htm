<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:156</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
A man came to the Prophet and said that he had been burnt (ruined). 
The Prophet asked him what was the matter. He replied, "I had sexual 
intercourse with my wife in Ramadan (while I was fasting)." Then a 
basket full of dates was brought to the Prophet and he asked, "Where 
is the burnt (ruined) man?" He replied, "I am present." The Prophet 
told him to give that basket in charity (as expiation).
