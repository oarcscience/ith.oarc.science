<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:560</H3><P><I>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid:</I></P>
A man came to Allah's Apostle and asked about Al-Luqata (a fallen 
thing). The Prophet said, "Recognize its container and its tying 
material and then make a public announcement about it for one year and
if its owner shows up, give it to him; otherwise use it as you like." 
The man said, "What about a lost sheep?" The Prophet said, "It is for 
you, your brother or the wolf." The man said "What about a lost 
camel?" The Prophet said, "Why should you take it as it has got its 
water-container (its stomach) and its hooves and it can reach the 
places of water and can eat the trees till its owner finds it?"
