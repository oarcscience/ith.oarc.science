While the Prophet was passing the night at his place of rest in 
Dhul-Hulaifa in the bottom of the valley (of Aqiq), he saw a dream and
it was said to him, "You are in a blessed valley." Musa said, "Salim 
let our camels kneel at the place where 'Abdullah used to make his 
camel kneel, seeking the place where Allah's Apostle used to take a 
rest, which is situated below the mosque which is in the bottom of the
valley; it is midway between the mosque and the road."
