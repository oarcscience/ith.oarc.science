### Hadith 3:520

*Narrated Rafi' bin Khadij:*

We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We used to rent the
land at the yield of specific delimited portion of it to be given to the
landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portion was affected by
blights etc., while the rest remained safe and vice versa, so the
Prophet forbade this practice. At that time gold or silver were not used
(for renting the land). If they provided the seeds, they would get
so-and-so much. Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm if the land belongs to
one but both spend on it and the yield is divided between them."
Az-Zuhri had the same opinion. Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm if
cotton is picked on the condition of having half the yield." Ibrahim,
Ibn Siain, 'Ata', Al-Hakam, Az-Zuhri and Qatada said, "There is no harm
in giving the yarn to the weaver to weave into cloth on the basis that
one-third or one-fourth (or any other portion) of the cloth is given to
the weaver for his labor." Ma'am said, "There is no harm in hiring
animals for a definite (fixed) period on the basis that one-third or
one-fourth of the products carried by the animals is given to the owner
of the animals."
