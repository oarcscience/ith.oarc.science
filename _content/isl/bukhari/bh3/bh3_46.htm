<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:47</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</I></P>
My father set out (for Mecca) in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and his 
companions assumed Ihram, but he did not. At that time the Prophet was
informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet proceeded 
onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them 
laughed among themselves. (My father said), "I looked up and saw an 
onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I then sought my 
companions' help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its 
meat. We were afraid that we might be left behind (separated) from the
Prophet so I went in search of the Prophet and made my horse to run at
a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at 
other times till I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at 
midnight. I asked him, "Where did you leave the Prophet ?" He replied,
"I left him at Ta'hun and he had the intention of having the midday 
rest at As-Suqya. I followed the trace and joined the Prophet and 
said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Your people (companions) send you their 
compliments, and (ask for) Allah's Blessings upon you. They are afraid
lest they may be left behind; so please wait for them.' I added, 'O 
Allah's Apostle! I hunted an onager and some of its meat is with me. 
The Prophet told the people to eat it though all of them were in the 
state of Ihram."
