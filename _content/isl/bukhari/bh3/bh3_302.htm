I heard Anas bin Malik saying, "A tailor invited Allah's Apostle to a 
meal which he had prepared. " Anas bin Malik said, "I accompanied 
Allah's Apostle to that meal. He served the Prophet with bread and 
soup made with gourd and dried meat. I saw the Prophet taking the 
pieces of gourd from the dish." Anas added, "Since that day I have 
continued to like gourd."
