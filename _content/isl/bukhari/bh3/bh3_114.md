### Hadith 3:117

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

(The tribe of) Quraish used to fast on the day of Ashura' in the
Pre-lslamic period, and then Allah's Apostle ordered (Muslims) to fast
on it till the fasting in the month of Ramadan was prescribed; whereupon
the Prophet said, "He who wants to fast (on 'Ashura') may fast, and he
who does not want to fast may not fast."

[Next: 3:118: Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, Fasting is a shield (or
a screen or a shelter)....](bh3_115)
