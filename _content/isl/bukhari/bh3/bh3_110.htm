When Allah's Apostle reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. 
When Abu Bakr's fever got worse, he would recite (this poetic verse): 
"Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death is nearer to 
him than His shoe laces." And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, 
would recite: "Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I
would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of good-smelling 
grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and
Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!" 
The Prophet said, "O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi'a and 'Utba bin 
Rabi'a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the 
land of epidemics." Allah's Apostle then said, "O Allah! Make us love 
Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Allah! Give 
blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make 
the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards 
Aljuhfa." Aisha added: When we reached Medina, it was the most 
unhealthy of Allah's lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of 
Medina) used to flow with impure colored water.
