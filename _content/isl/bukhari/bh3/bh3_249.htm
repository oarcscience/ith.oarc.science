<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:252</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Salama bin 'Abdur-Rahman:</I></P>
I asked Abu Said Al-Khudri, "Did you hear Allah's Apostle talking 
about the Night of Qadr?" He replied in the affirmative and said, 
"Once we were in Itikaf with Allah's Apostle in the middle ten days of
(Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and 
Allah's Apostle- delivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said,
'I was informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but 
had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten 
nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and 
water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had 
been in Itikaf with Allah's Apostle should return for it.' The people 
returned to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in 
the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the 
prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah's Apostle
prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the 
nose of the Prophet.
