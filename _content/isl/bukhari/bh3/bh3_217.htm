Quraish used to fast on the day of 'Ashura' in the Pre-lslamic period,
and Allah's Apostle too, used to fast on that day. When he came to 
Medina, he fasted on that day and ordered others to fast, too. Later 
when the fasting of the month of Ramadan was prescribed, he gave up 
fasting on the day of 'Ashura' and it became optional for one to fast 
on it or not.
