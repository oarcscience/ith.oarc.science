<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:502</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
A man came to the Prophet demanding his debts and behaved rudely. The 
companions of the Prophet intended to harm him, but Allah's Apostle 
said (to them), "Leave him, for the creditor (i.e. owner of a right) 
has the right to speak." Allah's Apostle then said, "Give him a camel 
of the same age as that of his." The people said, "O Allah's Apostle! 
There is only a camel that is older than his." Allah's Apostle said, 
"Give (it to) him, for the best amongst you is he who pays the rights 
of others handsomely."
