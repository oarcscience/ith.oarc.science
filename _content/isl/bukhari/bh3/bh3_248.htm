<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:251</H3><P><I>Narrated Ali bin Al-Husain:</I></P>
Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Allah's 
Apostle to visit him in the mosque while he was in Itikaf in the last 
ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got
up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they 
reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two 
Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah's Apostle . He told 
them: Do not run away! And said, "She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai."
Both of them said, "Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O 
Allah's Apostle!" And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), "Satan
reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it, 
(everywhere in one's body). I was afraid lest Satan might insert an 
evil thought in your minds."
