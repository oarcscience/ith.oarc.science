<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:782</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Umar:</I></P>
Umar bin Al-Khattab saw a silken dress (cloak) being sold at the gate 
of the Mosque and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Would that you buy it and 
wear it on Fridays and when the delegates come to you!" Allah's 
Apostle said, "This is worn by the one who will have no share in the 
Hereafter." Later on some silk dresses were brought and Allah's 
Apostle sent one of them to 'Umar. 'Umar said, "How do you give me 
this to wear while you said what you said about the dress of 'Utarid?"
Allah's Apostle said, "I have not given it to you to wear." So, 'Umar 
gave it to a pagan brother of his in Mecca.
