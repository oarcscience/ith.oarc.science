<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:874</H3><P><I>Narrated Marwan and al-Miswar bin Makhrama:</I></P>
(from the companions of Allah's Apostle) When Suhail bin Amr agreed to
the Treaty (of Hudaibiya), one of the things he stipulated then, was 
that the Prophet should return to them (i.e. the pagans) anyone coming
to him from their side, even if he was a Muslim; and would not 
interfere between them and that person. The Muslims did not like this 
condition and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with 
that condition. So, the Prophet agreed to that condition and returned 
Abu Jandal to his father Suhail bin 'Amr. Thenceforward the Prophet 
returned everyone in that period (of truce) even if he was a Muslim. 
During that period some believing women emigrants including Um Kalthum
bint Uqba bin Abu Muait who came to Allah's Apostle and she was a 
young lady then. Her relative came to the Prophet and asked him to 
return her, but the Prophet did not return her to them for Allah had 
revealed the following Verse regarding women:
<P>
"O you who believe! When the believing women come to you as emigrants.
Examine them, Allah knows best as to their belief, then if you know 
them for true believers, Send them not back to the unbelievers, (for) 
they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers, Nor are the 
unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them (60.10)
<P>
according to this Verse: "O you who believe! When the believing women 
come to you, as emigrants test them . . . for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, 
Most Merciful." (60.10-12) Aisha said, "When any of them agreed to 
that condition Allah's Apostle would say to her, 'I have accepted your
pledge of allegiance.' He would only say that, but, by Allah he never 
touched the hand of any women (i.e. never shook hands with them) while
taking the pledge of allegiance and he never took their pledge of 
allegiance except by his words (only)."
