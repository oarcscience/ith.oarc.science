Allah's Apostle said, "A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so he 
should not oppress him, nor should he hand him over to an oppressor. 
Whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his 
needs; whoever brought his (Muslim) brother out of a discomfort, Allah
will bring him out of the discomforts of the Day of Resurrection, and 
whoever screened a Muslim, Allah will screen him on the Day of 
Resurrection . "
