<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:613</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
When Allah gave victory to His Apostle over the people of Mecca, 
Allah's Apostle stood up among the people and after glorifying Allah, 
said, "Allah has prohibited fighting in Mecca and has given authority 
to His Apostle and the believers over it, so fighting was illegal for 
anyone before me, and was made legal for me for a part of a day, and 
it will not be legal for anyone after me. Its game should not be 
chased, its thorny bushes should not be uprooted, and picking up its 
fallen things is not allowed except for one who makes public 
announcement for it, and he whose relative is murdered has the option 
either to accept a compensation for it or to retaliate." Al-'Abbas 
said, "Except Al-ldhkhir, for we use it in our graves and houses." 
Allah's Apostle said, "Except Al-ldhkhir." Abu Shah, a Yemenite, stood
up and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Get it written for me." Allah's 
Apostle said, "Write it for Abu Shah." (The sub-narrator asked 
Al-Auza'i): What did he mean by saying, "Get it written, O Allah's 
Apostle?" He replied, "The speech which he had heard from Allah's 
Apostle ."
