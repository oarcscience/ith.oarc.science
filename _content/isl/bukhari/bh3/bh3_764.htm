the freed slave of Ibn 'Abbas, that Maimuna bint Al-Harith told him 
that she manumitted a slave-girl without taking the permission of the 
Prophet. On the day when it was her turn to be with the Prophet, she 
said, "Do you know, O Allah's Apostle, that I have manumitted my 
slave-girl?" He said, "Have you really?" She replied in the 
affirmative. He said, "You would have got more reward if you had given
her (i.e. the slave-girl) to one of your maternal uncles."
