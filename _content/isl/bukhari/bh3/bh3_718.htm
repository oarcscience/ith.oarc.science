<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:719</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
I have loved the people of the tribe of Bani Tamim ever since I heard,
three things, Allah's Apostle said about them. I heard him saying, 
These people (of the tribe of Bani Tamim) would stand firm against 
Ad-Dajjal." When the Sadaqat (gifts of charity) from that tribe came, 
Allah's Apostle said, "These are the Sadaqat (i.e. charitable gifts) 
of our folk." 'Aisha had a slave-girl from that tribe, and the Prophet
said to 'Aisha, "Manumit her as she is a descendant of Ishmael (the 
Prophet)."
