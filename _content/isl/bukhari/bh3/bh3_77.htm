<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:79</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:</I></P>
Al-Fadl was riding behind the Prophet and a woman from the tribe of 
Khath'am came up. Al-Fadl started looking at her and she looked at 
him. The Prophet turned Al-Fadl's face to the other side. She said, 
"My father has come under Allah's obligation of performing Hajj but he
is a very old man and cannot sit properly on his Mount. Shall I 
perform Hajj on his behalf? The Prophet replied in the affirmative. 
That happened during Hajjat-ul-wada' of the Prophet .
