<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:537</H3><P><I>Narrated Hanzla bin Qais:</I></P>
Rafi bin Khadij said, "My two uncles told me that they (i.e. the 
companions of the Prophet) used to rent the land in the life-time of 
the Prophet for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or 
for a portion of the yield stipulated by the owner of the land. The 
Prophet forbade it." I said to Rafi, "What about renting the land for 
Dinars and Dirhams?" He replied, "There is no harm in renting for 
Dinars-Dirhams. Al-Laith said, "If those who have discernment for 
distinguishing what is legal from what is illegal looked into what has
been forbidden concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it
is surrounded with dangers."
