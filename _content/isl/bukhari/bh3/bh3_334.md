### Hadith 3:337

*Narrated Jabir:*

Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Haram died and was in debt to others. I asked the
Prophet to intercede with his creditors for some reduction in the debts.
The Prophet requested them (to reduce the debts) but they refused. The
Prophet said to me, "Go and put your dates (In heaps) according to their
different kinds. The Ajwa on one side, the cluster of Ibn Zaid on
another side, etc.. Then call me." I did that and called the Prophet He
came and sat at the head or in the middle of the heaps and ordered me.
Measure (the dates) for the people (creditors)." I measured for them
till I paid all the debts. My dates remained as it nothing had been
taken from them. In other narrations, Jabir said; The Prophet said, "He
(i.e. 'Abdullah) continued measuring for them till he paid all the
debts." The Prophet said (to 'Abdullah), "Cut (clusters) for him (i.e.
one of the creditors) and measure for him fully."
