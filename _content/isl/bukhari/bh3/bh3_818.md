### Hadith 3:819

*Narrated Zahdam bin Mudrab:*

I heard Imran bin Husain saying, "The Prophet said, 'The best people are
those living in my generation, then those coming after them, and then
those coming after (the second generation)." Imran said "I do not know
whether the Prophet mentioned two or three generations after your
present generation. The Prophet added, 'There will be some people after
you, who will be dishonest and will not be trustworthy and will give
witness (evidences) without being asked to give witness, and will vow
but will not fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among them."
