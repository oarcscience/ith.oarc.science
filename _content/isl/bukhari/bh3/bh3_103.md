### Hadith 3:106

*Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:*

Allah's Apostle told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the
many things he mentioned, was his saying, "Ad-Dajjal will come and it
will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. He
will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that
day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and say, 'I
testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was given to us
by Allah's Apostle .' Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, 'If I kill this
man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?' They
will say, 'No.' Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and bring him back to
life. That man will say, 'Now I know your reality better than before.'
Ad-Dajjal will say, 'I want to kill him but I cannot.' "
