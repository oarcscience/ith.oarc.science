<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:428</H3><P><I>Narrated Said bin Abu Al-Hasan:</I></P>
While I was with Ibn 'Abbas a man came and said, "O father of 'Abbas! 
My sustenance is from my manual profession and I make these pictures."
Ibn 'Abbas said, "I will tell you only what I heard from Allah's 
Apostle . I heard him saying, 'Whoever makes a picture will be 
punished by Allah till he puts life in it, and he will never be able 
to put life in it.' " Hearing this, that man heaved a sigh and his 
face turned pale. Ibn 'Abbas said to him, "What a pity! If you insist 
on making pictures I advise you to make pictures of trees and any 
other unanimated objects."
