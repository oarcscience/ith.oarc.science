<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:746</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
We chased a rabbit at Mar-al-Zahran and the people ran after it but 
were exhausted. I overpowered and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha 
who slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah's Apostle. 
(The narrator confirms that he sent two thighs). The Prophet accepted 
that. (The sub-narrator asked Anas, "Did the Prophet; eat from it?" 
Anas replied, "He ate from it.")
