<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:266</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
'Ukaz, Majanna and Dhul-Majaz were market-places in the Pre-lslamic 
period of ignorance. When Islam came, Muslims felt that marketing 
there might be a sin. So, the Divine Inspiration came: "There is no 
harm for you to seek the bounty of your Lord (in the seasons of 
Hajj)." (2.198) Ibn 'Abbas recited the Verse in this way.
