### Hadith 3:428

*Narrated Said bin Abu Al-Hasan:*

While I was with Ibn 'Abbas a man came and said, "O father of 'Abbas! My
sustenance is from my manual profession and I make these pictures." Ibn
'Abbas said, "I will tell you only what I heard from Allah's Apostle . I
heard him saying, 'Whoever makes a picture will be punished by Allah
till he puts life in it, and he will never be able to put life in it.' "
Hearing this, that man heaved a sigh and his face turned pale. Ibn
'Abbas said to him, "What a pity! If you insist on making pictures I
advise you to make pictures of trees and any other unanimated objects."
