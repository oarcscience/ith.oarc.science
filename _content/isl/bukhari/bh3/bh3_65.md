*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Hunain:*

Abdullah bin Al-Abbas and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama differed at Al-Abwa';
Ibn 'Abbas said that a Muhrim could wash his head; while Al-Miswar
maintained that he should not do so. 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas sent me to Abu
Aiyub Al-Ansari and I found him bathing between the two wooden posts (of
the well) and was screened with a sheet of cloth. I greeted him and he
asked who I was. I replied, "I am 'Abdullah bin Hunain and I have been
sent to you by Ibn 'Abbas to ask you how Allah's Apostle used to wash
his head while in the state of lhram." Abu Aiyub Al-Ansarl caught hold
of the sheet of cloth and lowered it till his head appeared before me,
and then told somebody to pour water on his head. He poured water on his
head, and he (Abu Aiyub) rubbed his head with his hands by bringing them
from back to front and from front to back and said, "I saw the Prophet
doing like this."
