<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:495</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Allah's Apostle he would 
ask, "Has he left anything to repay his debt?" If he was informed that
he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer his funeral 
prayer, otherwise he would tell the Muslims to offer their friend's 
funeral prayer. When Allah made the Prophet wealthy through conquests,
he said, "I am more rightful than other believers to be the guardian 
of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible 
for the repayment of his debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his 
death) it will belong to his heirs. "
