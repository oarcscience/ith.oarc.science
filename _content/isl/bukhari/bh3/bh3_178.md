### Hadith 3:181

*Narrated Ar-Rubi' bint Mu'awadh:*

"The Prophet sent a messenger to the village of the Ansar in the morning
of the day of 'Ashura' (10th of Muharram) to announce: 'Whoever has
eaten something should not eat but complete the fast, and whoever is
observing the fast should complete it.' "She further said, "Since then
we used to fast on that day regularly and also make our boys fast. We
used to make toys of wool for the boys and if anyone of them cried for,
he was given those toys till it was the time of the breaking of the
fast."
