<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:471</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Musa:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "The example of Muslims, Jews and Christians is like
the example of a man who employed laborers to work for him from 
morning till night for specific wages. They worked till midday and 
then said, 'We do not need your money which you have fixed for us and 
let whatever we have done be annulled.' The man said to them, 'Don't 
quit the work, but complete the rest of it and take your full wages.' 
But they refused and went away. The man employed another batch after 
them and said to them, 'Complete the rest of the day and yours will be
the wages I had fixed for the first batch.' So, they worked till the 
time of 'Asr prayer. Then they said, "Let what we have done be 
annulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself.' The 
man said to them, 'Complete the rest of the work, as only a little of 
the day remains,' but they refused. Thereafter he employed another 
batch to work for the rest of the day and they worked for the rest of 
the day till the sunset, and they received the wages of the two former
batches. So, that was the example of those people (Muslims) and the 
example of this light (guidance) which they have accepted willingly.
