<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:645</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Beware! Avoid sitting on he roads (ways)." The 
people said, "There is no way out of it as these are our sitting 
places where we have talks." The Prophet said, "If you must sit there,
then observe the rights of the way." They asked, "What are the rights 
of the way?" He said, "They are the lowering of your gazes (on seeing 
what is illegal to look at), refraining from harming people, returning
greetings, advocating good and forbidding evil."
