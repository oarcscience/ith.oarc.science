### Hadith 3:682

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "Whoever manumits his share of a jointly possessed
slave, it is essential for him to manumit the slave completely if he has
sufficient money. Otherwise he should look for some work for the slave
(to earn what would enable him to emancipate himself), without
overburdening him with work."

[Next: 3:683: Ibn 'Abbas: The Prophet (along with his companions)
reached Mecca in the morning ...](bh3_682)
