### Hadith 3:811

*Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:*

Once I went to Medina where there was an outbreak of disease and the
people were dying rapidly. I was sitting with 'Umar and a funeral
procession passed by. The people praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It
has been affirmed" (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed
by. The people praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed."
(Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed by. The people
praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed (Paradise)."
Then a third funeral procession passed by and the people talked badly of
the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed (Hell)." I asked Umar,
"O chief of the believers! What has been affirmed?" He said, "I have
said what the Prophet said. He said, 'Allah will admit into paradise any
Muslim whose good character is attested by four persons.' We asked the
Prophet, 'If there were three witnesses only?' He said, 'Even three.' We
asked, 'If there were two only?' He said, 'Even two.' But we did not ask
him about one witness."
