<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:601</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:</I></P>
I heard Hisham bin Hakim bin Hizam reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way 
different to that of mine. Allah's Apostle had taught it to me (in a 
different way). So, I was about to quarrel with him (during the 
prayer) but I waited till he finished, then I tied his garment round 
his neck and seized him by it and brought him to Allah's Apostle and 
said, "I have heard him reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way different to
the way you taught it to me." The Prophet ordered me to release him 
and asked Hisham to recite it. When he recited it, Allah s Apostle 
said, "It was revealed in this way." He then asked me to recite it. 
When I recited it, he said, "It was revealed in this way. The Qur'an 
has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way 
that is easier for you."
