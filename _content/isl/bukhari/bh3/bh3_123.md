### Hadith 3:126

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

The Prophet was the most generous amongst the people, and he used to be
more so in the month of Ramadan when Gabriel visited him, and Gabriel
used to meet him on every night of Ramadan till the end of the month.
The Prophet used to recite the Holy Qur'an to Gabriel, and when Gabriel
met him, he used to be more generous than a fast wind (which causes rain
and welfare).

forged speech and evil ...](bh3_124)
