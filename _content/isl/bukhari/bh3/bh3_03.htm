Ursa bin AzZubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw 
'Abdullah bin Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some 
people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer 
and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Ursa) then asked him how many
times the Prophet had performed 'Umra. He replied, 'Four times; one of
them was in the month of Rajab." We disliked to contradict him. Then 
we heard 'Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth 
with Siwak in the dwelling place. 'Ursa said, "O Mother! O Mother of 
the believers! Don't you hear what Abu 'Abdur Rahman is saying?" She 
said, "What does he say?" 'Ursa said, "He says that Allah's Apostle 
performed four 'Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab." 
'Aisha said, "May Allah be merciful to Abu 'Abdur Rahman! The Prophet 
did not perform any 'Umra except that he was with him, and he never 
performed any 'Umra in Rajab."
