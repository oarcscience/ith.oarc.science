<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:787</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr:</I></P>
We were one-hundred and thirty persons accompanying the Prophet who 
asked us whether anyone of us had food. There was a man who had about 
a Sa of wheat which was mixed with water then. A very tall pagan came 
driving sheep. The Prophet asked him, "Will you sell us (a sheep) or 
give it as a present?" He said, "I will sell you (a sheep)." The 
Prophet bought a sheep and it was slaughtered. The Prophet ordered 
that its liver and other abdominal organs be roasted. By Allah, the 
Prophet gave every person of the one-hundred-and-thirty a piece of 
that; he gave all those of them who were present; and kept the shares 
of those who were absent.The Prophet then put its meat in two huge 
basins and all of them ate to their fill, and even then more food was 
left in the two basins which were carried on the camel (or said 
something like it).
