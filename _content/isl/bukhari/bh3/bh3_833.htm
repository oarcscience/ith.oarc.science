<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:834</H3><P><I>Narrated Abdullah:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "If somebody takes a false oath in order to get 
the property of a Muslim (unjustly) by that oath, then Allah will be 
angry with him when he will meet Him." Al-Ash'ath informed me, "By 
Allah! This was said regarding me. There was a dispute about a piece 
of land between me and a man from the Jews who denied my right. I took
him to the Prophet. Allah's Apostle asked me, 'Do you have an 
evidence?' I replied in the negative. He said to the Jew, 'Take an 
oath.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! He will surely take an oath and 
take my property unjustly." So, Allah revealed: "Verily! Those who 
purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths
. . . "  (3.77)
