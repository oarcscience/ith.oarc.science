<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:532</H3><P><I>Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:</I></P>
My uncle Zuhair said, "Allah's Apostle forbade us to do a thing which 
was a source of help to us." I said, "Whatever Allah's Apostle said 
was right." He said, "Allah's Apostle sent for me and asked, 'What are
you doing with your farms?' I replied, 'We give our farms on rent on 
the basis that we get the yield produced at the banks of the water 
streams (rivers) for the rent, or rent it for some Wasqs of barley and
dates.' Allah's Apostle said, 'Do not do so, but cultivate (the land) 
yourselves or let it be cultivated by others gratis, or keep it 
uncultivated.' I said, 'We hear and obey.'
