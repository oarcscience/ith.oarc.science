### Hadith 3:639

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:*

The Prophet said, "Whoever has (the following) four characters will be a
hypocrite, and whoever has one of the following four characteristics
will have one characteristic of hypocrisy until he gives it up. These
are: (1 ) Whenever he talks, he tells a lie; (2) whenever he makes a
promise, he breaks it; (3) whenever he makes a covenant he proves
treacherous; (4) and whenever he quarrels, he behaves impudently in an
evil insulting manner." (See Hadith No. 33 Vol. 1)
