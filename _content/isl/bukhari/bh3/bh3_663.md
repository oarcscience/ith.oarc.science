They went to the Prophet and asked his permission to slaughter their
camels, and he agreed. 'Umar met them and they told him about it, and he
said, "How would you survive after slaughtering your camels?" Then he
went to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's Apostle! How would they survive
after slaughtering their camels?" Allah's Apostle ordered 'Umar, "Call
upon the people to bring what has remained of their food." A leather
sheet was spread and al I the journey food was collected and heaped over
it. Allah's Apostle stood up and invoked Allah to bless it, and then
directed all the people to come with their utensils, and they started
taking from it till all of them got what was sufficient for them.
Allah's Apostle then said, "I testify that None has the right to be
worshipped but Allah, and I am His Apostle. "
