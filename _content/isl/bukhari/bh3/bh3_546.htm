<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:547</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "There are three persons whom Allah will not 
look at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will he purify them and theirs
shall be a severe punishment. They are:
<P>
1. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he withheld it from
travelers.
<P>
2. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he gave it 
only for worldly benefits. If the ruler gives him something he gets 
satisfied, and if the ruler withholds something from him, he gets 
dissatisfied.
<P>
3. And man displayed his goods for sale after the 'Asr prayer and he 
said, 'By Allah, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I 
have been given so much for my goods,' and somebody believes him (and 
buys them)."
<P>
The Prophet then recited: "Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at
the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths."   (3.77)
