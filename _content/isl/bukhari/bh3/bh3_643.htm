<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:644</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
I was the butler of the people in the house of Abu Talha, and in those
days drinks were prepared from dates. Allah's Apostle ordered somebody
to announce that alcoholic drinks had been prohibited. Abu Talha 
ordered me to go out and spill the wine. I went out and spilled it, 
and it flowed in the streets of Medina. Some people said, "Some people
were killed and wine was still in their stomachs." On that the Divine 
revelation came:-- "On those who believe And do good deeds There is no
blame For what they ate (in the past)." (5.93)
