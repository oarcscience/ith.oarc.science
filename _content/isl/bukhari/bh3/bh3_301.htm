<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:304</H3><P><I>Narrated Khabbab:</I></P>
I was a blacksmith in the Pre-lslamic period, and 'Asi bin Wail owed 
me some money, so I went to him to demand it. He said (to me), "I will
not pay you unless you disbelieve Muhammad." I said, "I will not 
disbelieve till Allah kills you and then you get resurrected." He 
said, "Leave me till I die and get resurrected, then I will be given 
wealth and children and I will pay you your debt." On that occasion it
was revealed to the Prophet:
<P>
'Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs and says: Surely I 
will be given wealth and children? Has he known the unseen, or has he 
taken a covenant from the Beneficent (Allah)? (19.77-78)
