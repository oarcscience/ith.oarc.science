### Hadith 3:599

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever takes a false oath so as to take the
property of a Muslim (illegally) will meet Allah while He will be angry
with him." Al-Ash'ath said: By Allah, that saying concerned me. I had
common land with a Jew, and the Jew later on denied my ownership, so I
took him to the Prophet who asked me whether I had a proof of my
ownership. When I replied in the negative, the Prophet asked the Jew to
take an oath. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! He will take an oath and
deprive me of my property." So, Allah revealed the following verse:
"Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's
covenant and their oaths." (3.77)
