<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:196</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said to me, "O 'Abdullah! Have I not been informed 
that you fast during the day and offer prayers all the night." 
'Abdullah replied, "Yes, O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "Don't 
do that; fast for few days and then give it up for few days, offer 
prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right on you, and 
your wife has a right on you, and your guest has a right on you. And 
it is sufficient for you to fast three days in a month, as the reward 
of a good deed is multiplied ten times, so it will be like fasting 
throughout the year." I insisted (on fasting) and so I was given a 
hard instruction. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have power." The 
Prophet said, "Fast like the fasting of the Prophet David and do not 
fast more than that." I said, "How was the fasting of the Prophet of 
Allah, David?" He said, "Half of the year," (i.e. he used to fast on 
every alternate day).
<P>
Afterwards when 'Abdullah became old, he used to say, "It would have 
been better for me if I had accepted the permission of the Prophet 
(which he gave me i.e. to fast only three days a month)."
