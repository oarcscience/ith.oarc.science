<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:781</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
That he was in the company of the Prophet on a journey, riding a 
troublesome camel belonging to 'Umar. The camel used to go ahead of 
the Prophet, so Ibn 'Umar's father would say, "O 'Abdullah! No one 
should go ahead of the Prophet." The Prophet said to him, "Sell it to 
me." 'Umar said to the Prophet "It is for you." So, he bought it and 
said, "O 'Abdullah! It is for you, and you can do with it what you 
like."
