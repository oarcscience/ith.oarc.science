(1) A man possessed superfluous water on a way and he withheld it from
the travelers.
<P>
(2) a man who gives a pledge of allegiance to a Muslim ruler and gives
it only for worldly gains. If the ruler gives him what he wants, he

(3) a man bargains with another man after the Asr prayer and the 
latter takes a false oath in the Name of Allah) claiming that he has 
been offered so much for the thing and the former (believes him and) 
buys it."
