### Hadith 3:878

*Narrated Urwa:*

Aisha told me that Buraira came to seek her help in writing for
emancipation and at that time she had not paid any part of her price.
'Aisha said to her, "Go to your masters and if they agree that I will
pay your price (and free you) on condition that your Wala' will be for
me, I will pay the money." Buraira told her masters about that, but they
refused, and said, "If 'Aisha wants to do a favor she could, but your
Wala will be for us." Aisha informed Allah's Apostle of that and he said
to her, "Buy and manumit Buraira as the Wala' will go to the
manumitted."
