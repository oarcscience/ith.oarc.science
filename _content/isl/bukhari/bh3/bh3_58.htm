<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:59</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
"The Prophet said, 'Allah has made Mecca, a sanctuary, so it was a 
sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It 
was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few 
hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its 
trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its luqata 
(fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he 
has found) publicly.' Al-'Abbas said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Except 
Al-ldhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and 
for our graves.' The Prophet then said, 'Except Al-idhkhir.' " 'Ikrima
said, 'Do you know what "chasing or disturbing" the game means? It 
means driving it out of the shade to occupy its place."
