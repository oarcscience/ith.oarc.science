### Hadith 3:859

*Narrated Aisha:*

The following Verse: If a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her
husband's part (i.e. the husband notices something unpleasant about his
wife, such as old age or the like, and wants to divorce her, but she
asks him to keep her and provide for her as he wishes). (4.128) "There
is no blame on them if they reconcile on such basis."

and said, O Allah's Apostle! Judge between us ...](bh3_859)
