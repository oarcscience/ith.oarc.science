<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:672</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Whoever manumits his share of a jointly possessed 
slave, it is imperative for him to get that slave manumitted 
completely by paying the remaining price, and if he does not have 
sufficient money to manumit him, then the price of the slave should be
estimated justly, and he is to be allowed to work and earn the amount 
that will manumit him (without overburdening him)".
