<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:576</H3><P><I>Narrated Hudhaifa:</I></P>
I heard the Prophet saying, "Once a man died and was asked, 'What did 
you use to say (or do) (in your life time)?' He replied, 'I was a 
business-man and used to give time to the rich to repay his debt and 
(used to) deduct part of the debt of the poor.' So he was forgiven 
(his sins.)" Abu Masud said, "I heard the same (Hadith) from the 
Prophet."
