### Hadith 3:488

*Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa:*

Once, while we were sitting in the company of Prophet, a dead man was
brought. The Prophet was requested to lead the funeral prayer for the
deceased. He said, "Is he in debt?" The people replied in the negative.
He said, "Has he left any wealth?" They said, "No." So, he led his
funeral prayer. Another dead man was brought and the people said, "O
Allah's Apostle! Lead his funeral prayer." The Prophet said, "Is he in
debt?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Has he left any wealth?" They said,
''Three Dinars." So, he led the prayer. Then a third dead man was
brought and the people said (to the Prophet ), Please lead his funeral
prayer." He said, "Has he left any wealth?" They said, "No." He asked,
"Is he in debt?" They said, ("Yes! He has to pay) three Diners.', He
(refused to pray and) said, "Then pray for your (dead) companion." Abu
Qatada said, "O Allah's Apostle! Lead his funeral prayer, and I will pay
his debt." So, he led the prayer.
