<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:162</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abi Aufa:</I></P>
We were in the company of Allah's Apostle on a journey. He said to a 
man, "Get down and mix Sawiq (powdered barley) with water for me." The
man said, "The sun (has not set yet), O Allah's Apostle." The Prophet 
again said to him, "Get down and mix Sawiq with water for me." The man
again said, "O Allah's Apostle! The sun!" The Prophet said to him (for
the third time) "Get down and mix Sawiq with water for me." The man 
dismounted and mixed Sawiq with water for him. The Prophet drank it 
and then beckoned with his hand (towards the East) and said, "When you
see the night falling from this side, then a fasting person should 
break his fast."
