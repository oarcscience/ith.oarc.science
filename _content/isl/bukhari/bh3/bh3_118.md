### Hadith 3:121

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever gives two kinds (of things or property)
in charity for Allah's Cause, will be called from the gates of Paradise
and will be addressed, 'O slaves of Allah! Here is prosperity.' So,
whoever was amongst the people who used to offer their prayers, will be
called from the gate of the prayer; and whoever was amongst the people
who used to participate in Jihad, will be called from the gate of Jihad;
and whoever was amongst those who used to observe fasts, will be called
from the gate of Ar-Raiyan; whoever was amongst those who used to give
in charity, will be called from the gate of charity." Abu Bakr said,
"Let my parents be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Apostle! No distress or
need will befall him who will be called from those gates. Will there be
any one who will be called from all these gates?" The Prophet replied,
"Yes, and I hope you will be one of them."
