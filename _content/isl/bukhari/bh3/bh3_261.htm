Abdur Rahman bin Auf said, "When we came to Medina as emigrants, 
Allah's Apostle established a bond of brotherhood between me and Sad 
bin Ar-Rabi'. Sad bin Ar-Rabi' said (to me), 'I am the richest among 
the Ansar, so I will give you half of my wealth and you may look at my
two wives and whichever of the two you may choose I will divorce her, 
and when she has completed the prescribed period (before marriage) you
may marry her.' Abdur-Rahman replied, "I am not in need of all that. 
Is there any market-place where trade is practiced?' He replied, "The 
market of Qainuqa." Abdur-Rahman went to that market the following day
and brought some dried butter-milk (yogurt) and butter, and then he 
continued going there regularly. Few days later, 'AbdurRahman came 
having traces of yellow (scent) on his body. Allah's Apostle asked him
whether he had got married. He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet
said, 'Whom have you married?' He replied, 'A woman from the Ansar.' 
Then the Prophet asked, 'How much did you pay her?' He replied, '(I 
gave her) a gold piece equal in weigh to a date stone (or a date stone
of gold)! The Prophet said, 'Give a Walima (wedding banquet) even if 
with one sheep .' "
