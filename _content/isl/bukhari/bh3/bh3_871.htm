<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:872</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:</I></P>
My father died and was in debt. I suggested that his creditors take 
the fruits (i.e. dates) of my garden in lieu of the debt of my father,
but they refused the offer, as they thought that it would not cover 
the full debt. So, I went to the Prophet and told him about it. He 
said (to me), "When you pluck the dates and collect them in the Mirbad
(i.e. a place where dates are dried), call me (Allah's Apostle)." 
Finally he came accompanied by Abu Bakr and 'Umar and sat on the dates
and invoked Allah to bless them. Then he said, "Call your creditors 
and give them their full rights." So, I paid all my father's creditors
in full and yet thirteen extra Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which
were 'Ajwa and six were Laun or six of which were Ajwa and seven were 
Laun. I met Allah's Apostle at sunset and informed him about it. On 
that he smiled and said, "Go to Abu Bakr and 'Umar and tell them about
it." They said, "We perceived that was going to happen, as Allah's 
Apostle did what he did."
