<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:233</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Salama:</I></P>
I asked Abu Sa'id, and he was a friend of mine,  (about the Night of 
Qadr) and he said, "We practiced Itikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in 
the middle third of the month of Ramadan with the Prophet . In the 
morning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet came and addressed us and 
said, 'I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was 
caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last 
ten nights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself 
prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in l'tikaf 
with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day's period)', 
and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky 
but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rain-water started 
leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm 
leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established and I saw Allah's Apostle
prostrating in mud and water and I saw the traces of mud on his 
forehead."
