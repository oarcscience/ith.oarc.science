<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:854</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "If the people knew what is the reward of making
the call (for the prayer) and (of being in) the first row (in the 
prayer), and if they found no other way to get this privilege except 
by casting lots, they would certainly cast lots for it. If they knew 
the reward of the noon prayer, they would race for it, and if they 
knew the reward of the morning (i.e. Fajr) and Isha prayers, they 
would present themselves for the prayer even if they had to crawl to 
reach there.
