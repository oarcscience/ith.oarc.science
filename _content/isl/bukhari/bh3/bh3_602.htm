Abu bin Zam'a and Sad bin Abi Waqqas carried the case of their claim 
of the (ownership) of the son of a slave-qirl of Zam'a before the 
Prophet. Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! My brother, before his death, 
told me that when I would return (to Mecca), I should search for the 
son of the slave-girl of Zam'a and take him into my custody as he was 
his son." 'Abu bin Zam'a said, 'the is my brother and the son of the 
slave-girl of my father, and was born or my father's bed." The Prophet
noticed a resemblance between Utba and the boy but he said, "O 'Abu 
bin Zam'a! You will get this boy, as the son goes to the owner of the 
bed. You, Sauda, screen yourself from the boy."
