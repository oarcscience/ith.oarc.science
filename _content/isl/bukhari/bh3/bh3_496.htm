<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:498</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf:</I></P>
I got an agreement written between me and Umaiya bin Khalaf that 
Umaiya would look after my property (or family) in Mecca and I would 
look after his in Medina. When I mentioned the word 'Ar-Rahman' in the
documents, Umaiya said, "I do not know 'Ar-Rahman.' Write down to me 
your name, (with which you called yourself) in the Pre-lslamic Period 
of Ignorance." So, I wrote my name ' 'Abdu 'Amr'. On the day (of the 
battle) of Badr, when all the people went to sleep, I went up the hill
to protect him. Bilal(1) saw him (i.e. Umaiya) and went to a gathering
of Ansar and said, "(Here is) Umaiya bin Khalaf! Woe to me if he 
escapes!" So, a group of Ansar went out with Bilal to follow us 
('Abdur-Rahman and Umaiya). Being afraid that they would catch us, I 
left Umaiya's son for them to keep them busy but the Ansar killed the 
son and insisted on following us. Umaiya was a fat man, and when they 
approached us, I told him to kneel down, and he knelt, and I laid 
myself on him to protect him, but the Ansar killed him by passing 
their swords underneath me, and one of them injured my foot with his 
sword. (The sub narrator said, " 'Abdur-Rahman used to show us the 
trace of the wound on the back of his foot.")
