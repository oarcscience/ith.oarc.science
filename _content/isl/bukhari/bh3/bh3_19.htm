<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:20</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amr bin Dinar:</I></P>
We asked Ibn 'Umar whether a man who had performed the Tawaf of the 
Ka'ba but had not performed the Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwa 
yet, was permitted to have sexual relation with his wife. He replied, 
"The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka'ba seven 
times and then offered a two Rak'at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and 
then performed the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa (seven 
times) (and verily, in Allah's Apostle you have a good example." And 
we asked Jabir bin 'Abdullah (the same question) and he replied, "He 
should not go near her till he has finished the going (Tawaf) between 
As-Safa and Al-Marwa."
