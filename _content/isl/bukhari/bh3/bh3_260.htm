<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:263</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
You people say that Abu Huraira tells many narrations from Allah's 
Apostle and you also wonder why the emigrants and Ansar do not narrate
from Allah's Apostle as Abu Huraira does. My emigrant brothers were 
busy in the market while I used to stick to Allah's Apostle content 
with what fills my stomach; so I used to be present when they were 
absent and I used to remember when they used to forget, and my Ansari 
brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the 
poor men of Suffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to
forget. No doubt, Allah's Apostle once said, "Whoever spreads his 
garment till I have finished my present speech and then gathers it to 
himself, will remember whatever I will say." So, I spread my colored 
garment which I was wearing till Allah's Apostle had finished his 
saying, and then I gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget any 
of that narrations.
