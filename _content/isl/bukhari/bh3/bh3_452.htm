The Prophet came to Medina and the people used to pay in advance the 
prices of fruits to be delivered within two to three years. The 
Prophet said (to them), "Buy fruits by paying their prices in advance 
on condition that the fruits are to be delivered to you according to a
fixed specified measure within a fixed specified period." Ibn Najih 
said, " ... by specified measure and specified weight."
