<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:616</H3><P><I>Narrated Suwaid bin Ghafala:</I></P>
While I as in the company of Salman bin Rabi'a and Suhan, in one of 
the holy battles, I found a whip. One of them told me to drop it but I
refused to do so and said that I would give it to its owner if I found
him, otherwise I would utilize it. On our return we performed Hajj and
on passing by Medina, I asked Ubai bin Ka'b about it. He said, "I 
found a bag containing a hundred Dinars in the lifetime of the Prophet
and took it to the Prophet who said to me, 'Make public announcement 
about it for one year.' So, I announced it for one year and went to 
the Prophet who said, 'Announce it publicly for another year.' So, I 
announced it for another year. I went to him again and he said, 
"Announce for an other year." So I announced for still another year. I
went to the Prophet for the fourth time, and he said, 'Remember the 
amount of money, the description of its container and the string it is
tied with, and if the owner comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize 
it.' "
