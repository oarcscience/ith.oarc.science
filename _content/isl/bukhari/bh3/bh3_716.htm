<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:717</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Aun:</I></P>
I wrote a letter to Nafi and Nafi wrote in reply to my letter that the
Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning while they
were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of

were taken as captives; the Prophet got Juwairiya on that day. Nafi 
said that Ibn 'Umar had told him the above narration and that Ibn 
'Umar was in that army.
