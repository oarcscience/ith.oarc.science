<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:176</H3><P><I>Narrated Abdullah bin Abi Aufa:</I></P>
We were in the company of the Prophet on a journey and he was fasting,
and when the sun set, he addressed somebody, "O so-and-so, get up and 
mix Sawiq with water for us." He replied, "O Allah's Apostle! (Will 
you wait) till it is evening?" The Prophet said, "Get down and mix 
Sawiq with water for us." He replied, "O Allah's Apostle! (If you 
wait) till it is evening." The Prophet said again, "Get down and mix 
Sawiq with water for us." He replied, "It is still daytime."(1) The 
Prophet said again, "Get down and mix Sawiq with water for us." He got
down and mixed Sawiq for them. The Prophet drank it and then said, 
"When you see night falling from this side, the fasting person should 
break his fast."
