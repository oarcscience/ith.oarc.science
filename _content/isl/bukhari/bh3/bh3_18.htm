<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:19</H3><P><I>Narrated Isma'il:</I></P>
Abdullah bin Abu Aufa said: "Allah's Apostle performed 'Umra and we 
too performed 'Umra along with him. When he entered Mecca he performed
the Tawaf (of Ka'ba) and we too performed it along with him, and then 
he came to the As-Safa and Al-Marwa (i.e. performed the Sai) and we 
also came to them along with him. We were shielding him from the 
people of Mecca lest they may hit him with an arrow." A friend of his 
asked him (i.e. 'Abdullah bin Aufa), "Did the Prophet enter the Ka'ba 
(during that 'Umra)?" He replied in the negative. Then he said, "What 
did he (the Prophet ) say about Khadija?" He (Abdullah bin Aufa) said,
"(He said) 'Give Khadija the good tidings that she will have a palace 
made of Qasab in Paradise and there will be neither noise nor any 
trouble in it."
