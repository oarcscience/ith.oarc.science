<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:737</H3><P><I>Narrated Aisha:</I></P>
Buraira came (to 'Aisha) and said, "I have made a contract of 
emancipation with my masters for nine Uqiyas (of gold) to be paid in 
yearly installments. Therefore, I seek your help." 'Aisha said, "If 
your masters agree, I will pay them the sum at once and free you on 
condition that your Wala' will be for me." Buraira went to her masters
but they refused that offer. She (came back) and said, "I presented to
them the offer but they refused, unless the Wala' was for them." 
Allah's Apostle heard of that and asked me about it, and I told him 
about it. On that he said, "Buy and manumit her and stipulate that the
Wala' should be for you, as Wala' is for the liberator." 'Aisha added,
"Allah's Apostle then got up amongst the people, Glorified and Praised
Allah, and said, 'Then after: What about some people who impose 
conditions which are not present in Allah's Laws? So, any condition 
which is not present in Allah's Laws is invalid even if they were 
one-hundred conditions. Allah's ordinance is the truth, and Allah's 
condition is stronger and more solid. Why do some men from you say, O 
so-and-so! manumit the slave but the Wala will be for me? Verily, the 
Wala is for the liberator."
