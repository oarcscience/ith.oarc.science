(The tribe of) Quraish used to fast on the day of Ashura' in the 
Pre-lslamic period, and then Allah's Apostle ordered (Muslims) to fast
on it till the fasting in the month of Ramadan was prescribed; 
whereupon the Prophet said, "He who wants to fast (on 'Ashura') may 
fast, and he who does not want to fast may not fast."
