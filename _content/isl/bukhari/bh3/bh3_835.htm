<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:836</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Wail:</I></P>
Abdullah (bin Mas'ud) said, "Whoever takes a (false) oath in order to 
grab some property (unjustly), Allah will be angry with him when he 
will meet Him. Allah confirmed that through His Divine Revelation: 
"Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's 
covenant and their oaths . . . they will have a painful punishment."  
(3.77)
<P>
Al-Ash'ath bin Qais came to us and asked, 'What is Abu Abdur-Rahman 
(i.e. 'Abdullah) telling you? 'We told him what he was narrating to 
us. He said, 'He was telling the truth; this Divine Verse was revealed
in connection with me. There was a dispute between me and another man 
about something and the case was filed before Allah's Apostle who 
said, 'Produce your two witnesses or else the defendant is to take an 
oath.' I said, The defendant will surely take a (false) oath caring 
for nothing.' The Prophet said, 'Whoever takes a false oath in order 
to grab (other's) property, then Allah will be angry with him when he 
will meet Him.' Then Allah revealed its confirmation. Al-Ashath then 
recited the above Divine Verse."   (3.77)
