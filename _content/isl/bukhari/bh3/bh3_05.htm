I asked Anas how many times the Prophet had performed 'Umra. He 
replied, "Four times. 1. 'Umra of Hudaibiya in Dhi-l-Qa'da when the 
pagans hindered him; 2. 'Umra in the following year in Dhi-l-Qa'da 
after the peace treaty with them (the pagans); 3. 'Umra from 
Al-Jr'rana where he distributed the war booty." I think he meant the 
booty (of the battle) of Hunain. I asked, "How many times did he 
perform Hajj?" He (Anas) replied, "Once. "
