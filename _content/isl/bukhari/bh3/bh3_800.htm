Some men had superfluous land and they said that they would give it to

The matter of emigration is difficult. Have you got some camels?" He 
replied in the affirmative. The Prophet asked him, "Do you pay their 
Zakat?" He replied in the affirmative. He asked, "Do you lend them so 
that their milk may be utilized by others?" The bedouin said, "Yes." 
The Prophet asked, "Do you milk them on the day off watering them?" He
replied, "Yes." The Prophet said, "Do good deeds beyond the merchants 
(or the sea) and Allah will never disregard any of your deeds." (See 
Hadith No. 260, Vol. 5)
