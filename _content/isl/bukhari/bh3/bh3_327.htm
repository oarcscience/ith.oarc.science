<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:330</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "The congregational prayer of anyone amongst you
is more than twenty (five or twenty seven) times in reward than his 
prayer in the market or in his house, for if he performs ablution 
completely and then goes to the mosque with the sole intention of 
performing the prayer, and nothing urges him to proceed to the mosque 
except the prayer, then, on every step which he takes towards the 
mosque, he will be raised one degree or one of his sins will be 
forgiven. The angels will keep on asking Allah's forgiveness and 
blessings for everyone of you so long as he keeps sitting at his 
praying place. The angels will say, 'O Allah, bless him! O Allah, be 
merciful to him!' as long as he does not do Hadath or a thing which 
gives trouble to the other." The Prophet further said, "One is 
regarded in prayer so long as one is waiting for the prayer."
