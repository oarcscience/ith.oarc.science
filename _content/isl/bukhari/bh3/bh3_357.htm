<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:360</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Do not go forward to meet the caravan (to buy 
from it on the way before it reaches the town). And do not urge buyers
to cancel their purchases to sell them (your own goods) yourselves, 
and do not practice Najsh. A town dweller should not sell the goods 
for the desert dweller. Do not leave sheep unmilked for a long time, 
when they are on sale, and whoever buys such an animal has the option 
of returning it, after milking it, along with a Sa of dates or keeping
it. it has been kept unmilked for a long period by the seller (to 
deceive others).
