Once a tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to Allah's Apostle 
who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who
was the youngest of those who were present, and on his left side there
were old men. The Prophet asked, "O boy ! Do you allow me to give (the
drink) to the elder people (first)?" The boy said, "I will not prefer 
anybody to have my share from you, O Allah's Apostle!" So, he gave it 
to the boy.
