When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the Prophet and 
they requested him to return their properties and captives. The 
Prophet stood up and said to them, "I have other people with me in 
this matter (as you see) and the most beloved statement to me is the 
true one; you may choose either the properties or the prisoners as I 
have delayed their distribution." The Prophet had waited for them for 
more than ten days since his arrival from Ta'if. So, when it became 
evident to them that the Prophet was not going to return them except 
one of the two, they said, "We choose our prisoners." The Prophet got 
up amongst the people and glorified and praised Allah as He deserved 
and said, "Then after, these brethren of yours have come to us with 
repentance, and I see it logical to return them the captives. So, 
whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, 
and whoever of you likes to stick to his share till we recompense him 
from the very first war booty which Allah will give us, then he can do
so (i.e. give up the present captives)." The people unanimously said, 
"We do that (return the captives) willingly." The Prophet said, "We do
not know which of you has agreed to it and which have not, so go back 
and let your leaders forward us your decision." So, all the people 
then went back and discussed the matter with their leaders who 
returned and informed the Prophet that all the people had willingly 
given their consent to return the captives. This is what has reached 
the Prophet, "I paid for my ransom and Aqil's ransom."
