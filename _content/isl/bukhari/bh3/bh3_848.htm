<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:849</H3><P><I>Narrated Said bin Jubair:</I></P>
A Jew from Hira asked me which one of the two periods Musa (i.e. 
Prophet Moses) completed. I said, "I don't know, (but wait) till I see
the most learned 'Arab and  enquire him about it." So, I went to Ibn 
'Abbas and asked him. He replied, "Moses completed the longer and 
better period." Ibn 'Abbas added, "No doubt, an apostle of Allah 
always does what he says."
