That he had married Um Yahya bint Abu Ihab. He said. "A black 
slave-lady came and said, 'I suckled you both.' I then mentioned that 
to the Prophet who turned his face aside." Uqba further said, "I went 
to the other side and told the Prophet about it. He said, 'How can you
(keep her as your wife) when the lady has said that she suckled both 
of you (i.e. you and your wife?)" So, the Prophet ordered him to 
divorce her.
