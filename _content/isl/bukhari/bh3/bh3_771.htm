<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:772</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "I am ruined." The Prophet 
asked, "What do you mean?" He said, "I had a sexual intercourse with 
my wife during Ramadan (while fasting)." The Prophet asked him, "Can 
you manumit a slave?" He replied in the negative. He then asked him, 
"Can you fast for two successive months continuously" He replied in 
the negative. The Prophet then asked him, "Can you feed sixty poor 
persons?" He replied in the negative. In the meantime an Ansari came 
with a basket full of dates. The Prophet said to the man, "Take it and
give it in charity (as an expiation of your sin)." The man said 
"Should I give it to some people who are poorer than we O Allah's 
Apostle? By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, there is no family 
between Medina's two mountains poorer than we." Allah's Apostle told 
him to take it and provide his family with it."
