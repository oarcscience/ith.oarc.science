Allah's Apostle forbade (1) the meeting of the caravan (of goods) on 
the way, (2) and that a residing person buys for a bedouin, (3) and 
that a woman stipulates the divorce of the wife of the would-be 
husband, (4) and that a man tries to cause the cancellation of a 
bargain concluded by another. He also forbade An-Najsh (see 
Hadith 824) and that one withholds the milk in the udder of the animal
so that he may deceive people on selling it.
