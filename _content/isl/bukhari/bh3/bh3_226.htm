<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:229</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Ursa:</I></P>
That he was informed by 'Aisha, "Allah's Apostle went out in the 
middle of the night and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed 
behind him. In the morning, the people spoke about it and then a large
number of them gathered and prayed behind him (on the second night). 
In the next morning the people again talked about it and on the third 
night the mosque was full with a large number of people. Allah's 
Apostle came out and the people prayed behind him. On the fourth night
the Mosque was overwhelmed with people and could not accommodate them,
but the Prophet came out (only) for the morning prayer. When the 
morning prayer was finished he recited Tashah-hud and (addressing the 
people) said, "Amma ba'du, your presence was not hidden from me but I 
was afraid lest the night prayer (Qiyam) should be enjoined on you and
you might not be able to carry it on." So, Allah's Apostle died and 
the situation remained like that (i.e. people prayed individually). "
