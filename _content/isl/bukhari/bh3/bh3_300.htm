<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:303</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Allah made Mecca a sanctuary and it was neither
permitted for anyone before, nor will it be permitted for anyone after
me (to fight in it). And fighting in it was made legal for me for a 
few hours of a day only. None is allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs 
or to cut down its trees or to chase its game or to pick up its Luqata
(fallen things) except by a person who would announce it publicly." 
'Abbas bin 'Abdul-Muttlib requested the Prophet, "Except Al-Idhkhir, 
for our goldsmiths and for the roofs of our houses." The Prophet said,
"Except Al-Idhkhir." 'Ikrima said, "Do you know what is meant by 
chasing its game? It is to drive it out of the shade and sit in its 
place." Khalid said, "('Abbas said: Al-Idhkhir) for our goldsmiths and
our graves."
