<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:557</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "There are three types of people whom Allah will 
neither talk to, nor look at, on the Day of Resurrection. (They are):
<P>
1. A man who takes an oath falsely that he has been offered for his 
goods so much more than what he is given,
<P>
2. a man who takes a false oath after the 'Asr prayer in order to grab
a Muslim's property, and
<P>
3. a man who with-holds his superfluous water. Allah will say to him, 
"Today I will with-hold My Grace from you as you with-held the 
superfluity of what you had not created."
