<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:21</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</I></P>
I came to the Prophet at Al-Batha' while his camel was kneeling down 
and he asked me, "Have you intended to perform the Hajj?" I replied in
the affirmative. He asked me, 'With what intention have you assumed 
Ihram?" I replied, "I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as 
that of the Prophet. He said, "You have done well. Perform the Tawaf 
of the Ka'ba and (the Sai) between As-safa and Al-Marwa and then 
finish the Ihram." So, I performed the Tawaf around the Ka'ba and the 
Sai) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then went to a woman of the 
tribe of Qais who cleaned my head from lice. Later I assumed the Ihram
for Hajj. I used to give the verdict of doing the same till the 
caliphate of 'Umar who said, "If you follow the Holy Book then it 
orders you to remain in the state of Ihram till you finish from Hajj, 
if you follow the Prophet then he did not finish his Ihram till the 
Hadi (sacrifice) had reached its place of slaughtering 
(Hajj-al-Qiran)."
