### Hadith 3:323

*Narrated Hakim bin Hizam:*

The Prophet said, "The buyer and the seller have the option of
cancelling or confirming the bargain unless they separate, and if they
spoke the truth and made clear the defects of the goods, them they would
be blessed in their bargain, and if they told lies and hid some facts,
their bargain would be deprived of Allah's blessings."
