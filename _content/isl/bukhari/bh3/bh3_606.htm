<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:607</H3><P><I>Narrated Khabbab:</I></P>
I was a blacksmith In the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, and 'Asi 
bin Wail owed me some money. I went to him to demand it, but he said 
to me, "I will not pay you unless you reject faith in Muhammad." I 
replied, "By Allah, I will never disbelieve Muhammad till Allah let 
you die and then resurrect you." He said, "Then wait till I die and 
come to life again, for then I will be given property and offspring 
and will pay your right." So, thus revelation came: "Have you seen him
who disbelieved in Our signs and yet says, 'I will be given property 
and offspring?' "  (19.77)
