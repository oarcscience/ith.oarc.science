<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:22</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Aswad:</I></P>
Abdullah the slave of Asma bint Abu Bakr, told me that he used to hear
Asma', whenever she passed by Al-Hajun, saying, "May Allah bless His 
Apostle Muhammad. Once we dismounted here with him, and at that time 
we were traveling with light luggage; we had a few riding animals and 
a little food ration. I, my sister, 'Aisha, Az-Zubair and such and 
such persons performed 'Umra, and when we had passed our hands over 
the Ka'ba (i.e. performed Tawaf round the Ka'ba and between As-Safa 
and Al-Marwa) we finished our lhram. Later on we assumed Ihram for 
Hajj the same evening."
