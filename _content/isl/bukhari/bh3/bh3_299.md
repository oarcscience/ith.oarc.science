### Hadith 3:302

*Narrated 'Ali:*

I got an old she-camel as my share from the booty, and the Prophet had
given me another from Al-Khumus. And when I intended to marry Fatima
(daughter of the Prophet), I arranged that a goldsmith from the tribe of
Bani Qainuqa' would accompany me in order to bring Idhkhir and then sell
it to the goldsmiths and use its price for my marriage banquet.

sanctuary and it was neither...](bh3_300)
