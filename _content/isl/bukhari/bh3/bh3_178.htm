"The Prophet sent a messenger to the village of the Ansar in the 
morning of the day of 'Ashura' (10th of Muharram) to announce: 
'Whoever has eaten something should not eat but complete the fast, and
whoever is observing the fast should complete it.' "She further said, 
"Since then we used to fast on that day regularly and also make our 
boys fast. We used to make toys of wool for the boys and if anyone of 
them cried for, he was given those toys till it was the time of the 
breaking of the fast."
