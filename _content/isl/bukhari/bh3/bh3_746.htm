An onager was presented to Allah's Apostle at the place called 
Al-Abwa' or Waddan, but Allah's Apostle rejected it. When the Prophet 
noticed the signs of sorrow on the giver's face he said, "We have not 
rejected your gift, but we are in the state of Ihram." (i.e. if we 
were not in a state of Ihram we would have accepted your gift, 
Fateh-al-Bari page 130, Vol. 6)
