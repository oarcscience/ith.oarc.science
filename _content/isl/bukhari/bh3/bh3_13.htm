<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:14</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
We set out with Allah's Apostle shortly before the appearance of the 
new moon of Dhi-l-Hiija and he said, "Whoever wants to assume Ihram 
for 'Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do
so. Had not I brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed Ihram for
'Umra." Some of the people assumed Ihram for 'Umra while others for 
Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed Ihram for 'Umra. I got my 
menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of 
'Arafat. I complained to Allah's Apostle about it, he said, "Abandon 
your 'Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj." So, I
did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of departure
from Mina), the Prophet sent 'Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tanim.
<P>
The sub-narrator adds: He ('AbdurRahman) let her ride behind him. And 
she assumed Ihram for 'Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha 
completed her Hajj and 'Umra, and no Hadi, Sadaqa (charity), or 
fasting was obligatory for her.
