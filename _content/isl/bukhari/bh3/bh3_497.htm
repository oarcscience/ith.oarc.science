<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:499</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle employed someone as a governor at Khaibar. When the 
man came to Medina, he brought with him dates called Janib. The 
Prophet asked him, "Are all the dates of Khaibar of this kind?" The 
man replied, "(No), we exchange two Sa's of bad dates for one Sa of 
this kind of dates (i.e. Janib), or exchange three Sa's for two." On 
that, the Prophet said, "Don't do so, as it is a kind of usury (Riba) 
but sell the dates of inferior quality for money, and then buy Janib 
with the money". The Prophet said the same thing about dates sold by 
weight. (See Hadith No. 506).
