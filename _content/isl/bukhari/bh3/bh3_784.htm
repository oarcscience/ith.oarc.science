A Jubba (i.e. cloak) made of thick silken cloth was presented to the 
Prophet. The Prophet used to forbid people to wear silk. So, the

Hands Muhammad's soul is, the handkerchiefs of Sad bin Mu'adh in 
Paradise are better than this." Anas added, "The present was sent to 
the Prophet by Ukaidir (a Christian) from Dauma."
