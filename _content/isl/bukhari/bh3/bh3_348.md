### Hadith 3:351

*Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:*

A man decided that a slave of his would be manumitted after his death
and later on he was in need of money, so the Prophet took the slave and
said, "Who will buy this slave from me?" Nu'aim bin 'Abdullah bought him
for such and such price and the Prophet gave him the slave.
