<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:488</H3><P><I>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa:</I></P>
Once, while we were sitting in the company of Prophet, a dead man was 
brought. The Prophet was requested to lead the funeral prayer for the 
deceased. He said, "Is he in debt?" The people replied in the 
negative. He said, "Has he left any wealth?" They said, "No." So, he 
led his funeral prayer. Another dead man was brought and the people 
said, "O Allah's Apostle! Lead his funeral prayer." The Prophet said, 
"Is he in debt?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Has he left any wealth?" 
They said, ''Three Dinars." So, he led the prayer. Then a third dead 
man was brought and the people said (to the Prophet ), Please lead his
funeral prayer." He said, "Has he left any wealth?" They said, "No." 
He asked, "Is he in debt?" They said, ("Yes! He has to pay) three 
Diners.', He (refused to pray and) said, "Then pray for your (dead) 
companion." Abu Qatada said, "O Allah's Apostle! Lead his funeral 
prayer, and I will pay his debt." So, he led the prayer.
