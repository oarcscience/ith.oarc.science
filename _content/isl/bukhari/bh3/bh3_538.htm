<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:539</H3><P><I>Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</I></P>
We used to be very happy on Friday as an old lady used to cut some 
roots of the Silq, which we used to plant on the banks of our small 
water streams, and cook them in a pot of her's, adding to them, some 
grains of barley. (Ya'qub, the sub-narrator said, "I think the 
narrator mentioned that the food did not contain fat or melted fat 
(taken from meat).") When we offered the Friday prayer we would go to 
her and she would serve us with the dish. So, we used to be happy on 
Fridays because of that. We used not to take our meals or the midday 
nap except after the Jumua prayer (i.e. Friday prayer) .
