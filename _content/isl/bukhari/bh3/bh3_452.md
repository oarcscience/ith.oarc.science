### Hadith 3:455

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

The Prophet came to Medina and the people used to pay in advance the
prices of fruits to be delivered within two to three years. The Prophet
said (to them), "Buy fruits by paying their prices in advance on
condition that the fruits are to be delivered to you according to a
fixed specified measure within a fixed specified period." Ibn Najih
said, " ... by specified measure and specified weight."
