<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:310</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
I was with the Prophet in a Ghazwa (Military Expedition) and my camel 
was slow and exhausted. The Prophet came up to me and said, "O Jabir."
I replied, "Yes?" He said, "What is the matter with you?" I replied, 
"My camel is slow and tired, so I am left behind." So, he got down and
poked the camel with his stick and then ordered me to ride. I rode the
camel and it became so fast that I had to hold it from going ahead of 
Allah's Apostle . He then asked me, have you got married?" I replied 
in the affirmative. He asked, "A virgin or a matron?" I replied, "I 
married a matron." The Prophet said, "Why have you not married a 
virgin, so that you may play with her and she may play with you?" 
Jabir replied, "I have sisters (young in age) so I liked to marry a 
matron who could collect them all and comb their hair and look after 
them." The Prophet said, "You will reach, so when you have arrived (at
home), I advise you to associate with your wife (that you may have an 
intelligent son)." Then he asked me, "Would you like to sell your 
camel?" I replied in the affirmative and the Prophet purchased it for 
one Uqiya of gold. Allah's Apostle reached before me and I reached in 
the morning, and when I went to the mosque, I found him at the door of
the mosque. He asked me, "Have you arrived just now?" I replied in the
affirmative. He said, "Leave your camel and come into (the mosque) and
pray two Rakat." I entered and offered the prayer. He told Bilal to 
weigh and give me one Uqiya of gold. So Bilal weighed for me fairly 
and I went away. The Prophet sent for me and I thought that he would 
return to me my camel which I hated more than anything else. But the 
Prophet said to me, "Take your camel as well as its price."
