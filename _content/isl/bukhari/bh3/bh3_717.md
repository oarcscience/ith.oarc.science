### Hadith 3:718

*Narrated Ibn Muhairiz:*

I saw Abu Said and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abu Said said,
"We went with Allah's Apostle, in the Ghazwa of Barli Al-Mustaliq and we
captured some of the 'Arabs as captives, and the long separation from
our wives was pressing us hard and we wanted to practice coitus
interruptus. We asked Allah's Apostle (whether it was permissible). He
said, "It is better for you not to do so. No soul, (that which Allah
has) destined to exist, up to the Day of Resurrection, but will
definitely come, into existence."
