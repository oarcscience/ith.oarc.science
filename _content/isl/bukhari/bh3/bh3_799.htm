That Allah's Apostle said, "There are forty virtuous deeds and the 
best of them is the Maniha of a she-goat, and anyone who does one of 
these virtuous deeds hoping for Allah's reward with firm confidence 
that he will get it, then Allah will make him enter Paradise because 
of Hassan (a sub-narrator) said, "We tried to count those good deeds 
below the Maniha; we mentioned replying to the sneezer, removing 
harmful things from the road, etc., but we failed to count even 
fifteen."
