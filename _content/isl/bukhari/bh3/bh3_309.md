### Hadith 3:312

*Narrated 'Amr:*

Here (i.e. in Mecca) there was a man called Nawwas and he had camels
suffering from the disease of excessive and unquenchable thirst. Ibn
'Umar went to the partner of Nawwas and bought those camels. The man
returned to Nawwas and told him that he had sold those camels. Nawwas
asked him, "To whom have you sold them?" He replied, "To such and such
Sheikh." Nawwas said, "Woe to you; By Allah, that Sheikh was Ibn 'Umar."
Nawwas then went to Ibn 'Umar and said to him, "My partner sold you
camels suffering from the disease of excessive thirst and he had not
known you." Ibn 'Umar told him to take them back. When Nawwas went to
take them, Ibn 'Umar said to him, "Leave them there as I am happy with
the decision of Allah's Apostle that there is no oppression . "
