Jabir bin Abdullah said, "When the Prophet died, Abu Bakr received 
some property from Al-Ala bin Al-Hadrami. Abu Bakr said to the people,
"Whoever has a money claim on the Prophet, or was promised something 
by him, should come to us (so that we may pay him his right)." Jabir 
added, "I said (to Abu Bakr), Allah's Apostle promised me that he 
would give me this much, and this much, and this much (spreading his 
hands three times)." Jabir added, "Abu Bakr counted for me and handed 
me five-hundred (gold pieces), and then five-hundred, and then 
five-hundred."
