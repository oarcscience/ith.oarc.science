*Narrated Jabir:*

Some men had superfluous land and they said that they would give it to

in the affirmative. The Prophet asked him, "Do you pay their Zakat?" He
replied in the affirmative. He asked, "Do you lend them so that their
milk may be utilized by others?" The bedouin said, "Yes." The Prophet
asked, "Do you milk them on the day off watering them?" He replied,
"Yes." The Prophet said, "Do good deeds beyond the merchants (or the
sea) and Allah will never disregard any of your deeds." (See Hadith No.
