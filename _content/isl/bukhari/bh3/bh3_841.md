### Hadith 3:842

*Narrated Abu Wail from Abdullah:*

The Prophet said, "Whoever takes a false oath in order to grab another
man's (or his brother's) property, then Allah will be angry with him
when he will meet him." Then Allah confirmed this by revealing the
Divine Verse: "Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of
Allah's Covenant and their oaths . . . Will get painful punishment."
(3.77) Al-Ash'ath met me and asked, "What did 'Abdullah tell you today?"
I said, "So and so." He said, "The Verse was revealed regarding my
case."
