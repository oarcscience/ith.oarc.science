I saw 'Uthman performing ablution; he washed his hands thrice, rinsed 
his mouth and then washed his nose, by putting water in it and then 
blowing it out, and washed his face thrice, and then washed his right 
forearm up to the elbow thrice, and then the left-forearm up to the 
elbow thrice, then smeared his head with water, washed his right foot 
thrice, and then his left foot thrice and said, "I saw Allah's Apostle
performing ablution similar to my present ablution, and then he said, 
'Whoever performs ablution like my present ablution and then offers 
two Rakat in which he does not think of worldly things, all his 
previous sins will be forgiven."
