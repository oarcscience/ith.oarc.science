<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:440</H3><P><I>Narrated Aun bin Abu Juhaifa:</I></P>
I saw my father buying a slave whose profession was cupping, and 
ordered that his instruments (of cupping) be broken. I asked him the

money for blood, the price of a dog, and the earnings of a slave-girl 
by prostitution; he cursed her who tattoos and her who gets tattooed, 
the eater of Riba (usury), and the maker of pictures."
