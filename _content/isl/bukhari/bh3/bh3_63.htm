<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:64</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Umar:</I></P>
A person stood up and asked, "O Allah's: Apostle! What clothes may be 
worn in the state of Ihram?" The Prophet replied, "Do not wear a shirt
or trousers, or any headgear (e.g. a turban), or a hooded cloak; but 
if somebody has no shoes he can wear leather stockings provided they 
are cut short off the ankles, and also, do not wear anything perfumed 
with Wars or saffron, and the Muhrima (a woman in the state of Ihram) 
should not cover her face, or wear gloves."
