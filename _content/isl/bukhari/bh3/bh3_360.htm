Allah's Apostle was asked about the slave-girl, if she was a virgin 
and committed illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet said, "If she 
committed illegal sexual intercourse, lash her, and if she did it a 
second time, then lash her again, and if she repeated the third time, 
then sell her even for a hair rope." Ibn Shihab said, "I don't know 
whether to sell her after the third or fourth offense."
