<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:186</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle forbade Al-Wisal in fasting. So, one of the Muslims 
said to him, "But you practice Al-Wisal. O Allah's Apostle!" The 
Prophet replied, "Who amongst you is similar to me? I am given food 
and drink during my sleep by my Lord." So, when the people refused to 
stop Al-Wisal (fasting continuously), the Prophet fasted day and night
continuously along with them for a day and then another day and then 
they saw the crescent moon (of the month of Shawwal). The Prophet said
to them (angrily), "If It (the crescent) had not appeared, I would 
have made you fast for a longer period." That was as a punishment for 
them when they refused to stop (practising Al-Wisal).
