<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:257</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amra bint 'Abdur-Rahman from 'Aisha:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle used to practice Itikaf every year in the month of 
Ramadan. And after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the 
place of his Itikaf. 'Aisha asked his permission to let her practice 
Itikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. 
When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and 
when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the 
morning, Allah's Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four 
tents and asked, "What is this?" He was informed about it. He then 
said, "What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, 
for I do not want to see them." So, the tents were removed. The 
Prophet did not perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but 
did it in the last ten days of Shawwal.
