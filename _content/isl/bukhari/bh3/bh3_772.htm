<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:773</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud and his 
creditors demanded the debt back in a harsh manner. So I went to 
Allah's Apostle and informed him of that, he asked them to accept the 
fruits of my garden and excuse my father, but they refused. So, 
Allah's Apostle did not give them the fruits, nor did he cut them and 
distribute them among them, but said, "I will come to you tomorrow 
morning." So, he came to us the next morning and walked about in 
between the date-palms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I 
plucked the fruits and gave back all the rights of the creditors in 
full, and a lot of fruits were left for us. Then I went to Allah's 
Apostle, who was sitting, and informed him about what happened. 
Allah's Apostle told 'Umar, who was sitting there, to listen to the 
story. 'Umar said, "Don't we know that you are Allah's Apostle? By 
Allah! you are Allah's Apostle!"
