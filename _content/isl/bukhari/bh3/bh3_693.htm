<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:694</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Dhar:</I></P>
I asked the Prophet, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To believe 
in Allah and to fight for His Cause." I then asked, "What is the best 
kind of manumission (of slaves)?" He replied, "The manumission of the 
most expensive slave and the most beloved by his master." I said, "If 
I cannot afford to do that?" He said, "Help the weak or do good for a 
person who cannot work for himself." I said, "If I cannot do that?" He
said, "Refrain from harming others for this will be regarded as a 
charitable deed for your own good."
