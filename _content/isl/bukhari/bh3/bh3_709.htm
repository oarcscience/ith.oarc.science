Utba bin Abi Waqqas authorized his brother Sad bin Abi Waqqas to take 
the son of the slave-girl of Zam'a into his custody, telling him that 
the boy was his own (illegal) son. When Allah's Apostle went (to 
Mecca) at the time of the Conquest, Sad took the son of the slavegirl 
of Zam'a to Allah's Apostle and also brought 'Abu bin Zam'a with him 
and said, "O Allah's Apostle! This is the son of my brother 'Utba who 
authorized me to take him into my custody." 'Abu bin Zam'a said, "O 
Allah's Apostle! He is my brother, the son of Zam'a' slave-girl and he
was born on his bed." Allah's Apostle looked at the son of the 
slave-girl of Zam'a and noticed much resemblance (to 'Utba). Allah's 
Apostle said, "It is for you, O 'Abu bin Zam'a as he was born on the 
bed of your father." Allah's Apostle then told Sauda bint Zam'a to 
observe veil in the presence of the boy as he noticed the boy's 
resemblance to 'Utba and Sauda was the wife of the Prophet .
