### Hadith 3:155

*Narrated Humran:*

I saw 'Uthman performing ablution; he washed his hands thrice, rinsed
his mouth and then washed his nose, by putting water in it and then
blowing it out, and washed his face thrice, and then washed his right
forearm up to the elbow thrice, and then the left-forearm up to the
elbow thrice, then smeared his head with water, washed his right foot
thrice, and then his left foot thrice and said, "I saw Allah's Apostle
performing ablution similar to my present ablution, and then he said,
'Whoever performs ablution like my present ablution and then offers two
Rakat in which he does not think of worldly things, all his previous
sins will be forgiven."
