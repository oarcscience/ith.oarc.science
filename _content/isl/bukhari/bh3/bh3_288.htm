<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:291</H3><P><I>Narrated Hudhaifa:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Before your time the angels received the soul of a 
man and asked him, 'Did you do any good deeds (in your life)?' He 
replied, 'I used to order my employees to grant time to the rich 
person to pay his debts at his convenience.' So Allah said to the 
angels; "Excuse him." Rabi said that (the dead man said), 'I used to 
be easy to the rich and grant time to the poor.' Or, in another 
narration, 'grant time to the well-off and forgive the needy,' or, 
'accept from the well-off and forgive the needy.'
