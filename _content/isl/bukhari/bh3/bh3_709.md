### Hadith 3:710

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

Utba bin Abi Waqqas authorized his brother Sad bin Abi Waqqas to take
the son of the slave-girl of Zam'a into his custody, telling him that
the boy was his own (illegal) son. When Allah's Apostle went (to Mecca)
at the time of the Conquest, Sad took the son of the slavegirl of Zam'a
to Allah's Apostle and also brought 'Abu bin Zam'a with him and said, "O
Allah's Apostle! This is the son of my brother 'Utba who authorized me
to take him into my custody." 'Abu bin Zam'a said, "O Allah's Apostle!
He is my brother, the son of Zam'a' slave-girl and he was born on his
bed." Allah's Apostle looked at the son of the slave-girl of Zam'a and
noticed much resemblance (to 'Utba). Allah's Apostle said, "It is for
you, O 'Abu bin Zam'a as he was born on the bed of your father." Allah's
Apostle then told Sauda bint Zam'a to observe veil in the presence of
the boy as he noticed the boy's resemblance to 'Utba and Sauda was the
wife of the Prophet .
