<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:504</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
I was accompanying the Prophet on a journey and was riding a slow 
camel that was lagging behind the others. The Prophet passed by me and
asked, "Who is this?" I replied, "Jabir bin 'Abdullah." He asked, 
"What is the matter, (why are you late)?" I replied, "I am riding a 
slow camel." He asked, "Do you have a stick?" I replied in the 
affirmative. He said, "Give it to me." When I gave it to him, he beat 
the camel and rebuked it. Then that camel surpassed the others 
thenceforth. The Prophet said, "Sell it to me." I replied, "It is (a 
gift) for you, O Allah's Apostle." He said, "Sell it to me. I have 
bought it for four Dinars (gold pieces) and you can keep on riding it 
till Medina." When we approached Medina, I started going (towards my 
house). The Prophet said, "Where are you going?" I Sad, "I have 
married a widow." He said, "Why have you not married a virgin to 
fondle with each other?" I said, "My father died and left daughters, 
so I decided to marry a widow (an experienced woman) (to look after 
them)." He said, "Well done." When we reached Medina, Allah's Apostle 
said, "O Bilal, pay him (the price of the camel) and give him extra 
money." Bilal gave me four Dinars and one Qirat extra. (A sub-narrator
said): Jabir added, "The extra Qirat of Allah's Apostle never parted 
from me." The Qirat was always in Jabir bin 'Abdullah's purse.
