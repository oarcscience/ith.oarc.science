<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:860</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:</I></P>
A bedouin came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Judge between us 
according to Allah's Laws." His opponent got up and said, "He is 
right. Judge between us according to Allah's Laws." The bedouin said, 
"My son was a laborer working for this man, and he committed illegal 
sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that my son 
should be stoned to death; so, in lieu of that, I paid a ransom of one
hundred sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the 
learned scholars who said, "Your son has to be lashed one-hundred 
lashes and has to be exiled for one year." The Prophet said, "No doubt
I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and
the sheep are to go back to you, and your son will get a hundred 
lashes and one year exile." He then addressed somebody, "O Unais! go 
to the wife of this (man) and stone her to death" So, Unais went and 
stoned her to death.
