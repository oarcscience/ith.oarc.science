<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:683</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
The Prophet (along with his companions) reached Mecca in the morning 
of the fourth of Dhul-Hijja assuming Ihram for Hajj only. So when we 
arrived at Mecca, the Prophet ordered us to change our intentions of 
the Ihram for'Umra and that we could finish our Ihram after performing
the 'Umra and could go to our wives (for sexual intercourse). The 
people began talking about that. Jabir said surprisingly, "Shall we go
to Mina while semen is dribbling from our male organs?" Jabir moved 
his hand while saying so. When this news reached the Prophet he 
delivered a sermon and said, "I have been informed that some peoples 
were saying so and so; By Allah I fear Allah more than you do, and am 
more obedient to Him than you. If I had known what I know now, I would
not have brought the Hadi (sacrifice) with me and had the Hadi not 
been with me, I would have finished the Ihram." At that Suraqa bin 
Malik stood up and asked "O Allah's Apostle! Is this permission for us
only or is it forever?" The Prophet replied, "It is forever." In the 
meantime 'Ali bin Abu Talib came from Yemen and was saying Labbaik for
what the Prophet has intended. (According to another man, 'Ali was 
saying Labbaik for Hajj similar to Allah's Apostle's). The Prophet 
told him to keep on the Ihram and let him share the Hadi with him.
