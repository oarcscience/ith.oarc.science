<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:40</H3><P><I>Narrated Nafi:</I></P>
When Abdullah bin 'Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions 
performing 'Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, "If I should 
be prevented from reaching the Ka'ba, then I would do the same as we 
did while in the company of Allah's Apostle ." So, he assumed the 
Ihram for 'Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for 'Umra in 
the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then 'Abdullah bin 'Umar thought about it 
and said, "The conditions for both Hajj and 'Umra are similar." He 
then turned towards his companions and said, "The conditions of both 
Hajj and 'Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made 
the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with 'Umra." He 
then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of 
them (i.e. Hajj and ('Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for 
him and offered a Hadi.
