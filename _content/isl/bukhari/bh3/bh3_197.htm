The Prophet said to me, "You fast daily all the year and pray every 
night all the night?" I replied in the affirmative. The Prophet said, 
"If you keep on doing this, your eyes will become weak and your body 
will get tired. He who fasts all the year is as he who did not fast at
all. The fasting of three days (a month) will be equal to the tasting 
of the whole year." I replied, "I have the power for more than this." 
The Prophet said, "Then fast like the fasting of David who used to 
fast on alternate days and would never flee from the battle field, on 
meeting the enemy.
