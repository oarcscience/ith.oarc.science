<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:364</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle came to me and I told him about the slave-girl 
(Buraira) Allah's Apostle said, "Buy and manumit her, for the Wala is 
for the one who manumits." In the evening the Prophet got up and 
glorified Allah as He deserved and then said, "Why do some people 
impose conditions which are not present in Allah's Book (Laws)? 
Whoever imposes such a condition as is not in Allah's Laws, then that 
condition is invalid even if he imposes one hundred conditions, for 
Allah's conditions are more binding and reliable."
