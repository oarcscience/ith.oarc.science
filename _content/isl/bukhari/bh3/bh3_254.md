### Hadith 3:257

*Narrated 'Amra bint 'Abdur-Rahman from 'Aisha:*

Allah's Apostle used to practice Itikaf every year in the month of
Ramadan. And after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the
place of his Itikaf. 'Aisha asked his permission to let her practice
Itikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. When
Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and when
Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the
morning, Allah's Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four
tents and asked, "What is this?" He was informed about it. He then said,
"What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, for I do
not want to see them." So, the tents were removed. The Prophet did not
perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but did it in the last
ten days of Shawwal.
