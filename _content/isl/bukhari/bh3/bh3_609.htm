Yazid Maula Al-Munba'ith heard Zaid bin Khalid al-Juham saying, "The 
Prophet was asked about Luqata. He said, 'Remember the description of 
its container and the string it is tied with, and announce it publicly
for one year.' " Yazid added, "If nobody claims then the person who 
has found it can spend it, and it is regarded as a trust entrusted to 
him." Yahya said, "I do not know whether the last sentences were said 
by the Prophet or by Yazid." Zaid further said, "The Prophet was 
asked, 'What about a lost sheep?' The Prophet said, 'Take it, for it 
is for you or for your brother (i.e. its owner) or for the wolf." 
Yazid added that it should also be announced publicly. The man then 
asked the Prophet about a lost camel. The Prophet said, "Leave it, as 
it has its feet, water container (reservoir), and it will reach a 
place of water and eat trees till its owner finds it."
