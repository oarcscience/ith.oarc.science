<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:49</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Qatada:</I></P>
We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha (which
is at a distance of three stages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada 
narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of
the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram
while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were 
watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse
and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them 
to pick it up for me) but they said, "We will not help you by any 
means as we are in a state of Ihram." So, I picked up the whip myself 
and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and 
brought it to my companions. Some of them said, "Eat it." While some 
others said, "Do not eat it." So, I went to the Prophet who was ahead 
of us and asked him about it, He replied, "Eat it as it is Halal (i.e.
it is legal to eat it)."
