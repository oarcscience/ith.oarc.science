Whenever Allah's Apostle returned from a Ghazwa, Hajj or 'Umra, he 
used to say Takbir thrice at every elevation of the ground and then 
would say, "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah; He is One 
and has no partner. All the kingdoms is for Him, and all the praises 
are for Him, and He is Omnipotent. We are returning with repentance, 
worshipping, prostrating, and praising our Lord. He has kept up His 
promise and made His slave victorious, and He Alone defeated all the 
clans of (non-believers)."
