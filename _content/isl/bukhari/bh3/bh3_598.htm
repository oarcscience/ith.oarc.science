<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:599</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever takes a false oath so as to take the 
property of a Muslim (illegally) will meet Allah while He will be 
angry with him." Al-Ash'ath said: By Allah, that saying concerned me. 
I had common land with a Jew, and the Jew later on denied my 
ownership, so I took him to the Prophet who asked me whether I had a 
proof of my ownership. When I replied in the negative, the Prophet 
asked the Jew to take an oath. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! He will 
take an oath and deprive me of my property." So, Allah revealed the 
following verse: "Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost
of Allah's covenant and their oaths."  (3.77)
