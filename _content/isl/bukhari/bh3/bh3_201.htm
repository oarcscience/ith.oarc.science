That the Prophet asked him (Imran) or asked a man and Imran was 
listening, "O Abu so-and-so! Have you fasted the last days of this 
month?" (The narrator thought that he said, "the month of Ramadan"). 
The man replied, "No, O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet said to him,

Shawwal)." Through another series of narrators 'Imran said, "The 
Prophet said, '(Have you fasted) the last days of Sha'ban?"
