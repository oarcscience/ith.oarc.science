A tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to the Prophet who drank
from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the 
youngest of those who were present and on his left side there were old
men. The Prophet asked, "O boy, will you allow me to give it (i.e. the
rest of the drink) to the old men?" The boy said, "O Allah's Apostle! 
I will not give preference to anyone over me to drink the rest of it 
from which you have drunk." So, the Prophet gave it to him.
