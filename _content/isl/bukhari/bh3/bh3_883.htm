<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:884</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "No town-dweller should sell for a bedouin. Do not 
practice Najsh (i.e. Do not offer a high price for a thing which you 
do not want to buy, in order to deceive the people). No Muslim should 
offer more for a thing already bought by his Muslim brother, nor 
should he demand the hand of a girl already engaged to another Muslim.
A Muslim woman shall not try to bring about The divorce of her sister 
(i.e. another Muslim woman) in order to take her place herself."
