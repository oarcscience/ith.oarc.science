Allah's Apostle said, "The example of a good companion (who sits with 
you) in comparison with a bad one, is I like that of the musk seller 
and the blacksmith's bellows (or furnace); from the first you would 
either buy musk or enjoy its good smell while the bellows would either
burn your clothes or your house, or you get a bad nasty smell 
thereof."
