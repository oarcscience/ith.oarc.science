### Hadith 3:601

*Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:*

I heard Hisham bin Hakim bin Hizam reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way
different to that of mine. Allah's Apostle had taught it to me (in a
different way). So, I was about to quarrel with him (during the prayer)
but I waited till he finished, then I tied his garment round his neck
and seized him by it and brought him to Allah's Apostle and said, "I
have heard him reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way different to the way
you taught it to me." The Prophet ordered me to release him and asked
Hisham to recite it. When he recited it, Allah s Apostle said, "It was
revealed in this way." He then asked me to recite it. When I recited it,
he said, "It was revealed in this way. The Qur'an has been revealed in
seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easier for you."
