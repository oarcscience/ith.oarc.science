<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:189</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Juhaifa:</I></P>
The Prophet made a bond of brotherhood between Salman and Abu 
Ad-Darda.' Salman paid a visit to Abu Ad-Darda' and found Um Ad-Darda'
dressed in shabby clothes and asked her why she was in that state. She
replied, "Your brother Abu Ad-Darda' is not interested in (the 
luxuries of) this world." In the meantime Abu Ad-Darda' came and 
prepared a meal for Salman. Salman requested Abu Ad-Darda' to eat 
(with him), but Abu Ad-Darda' said, "I am fasting." Salman said, "I am
not going to eat unless you eat." So, Abu Ad-Darda' ate(with Salman). 
When it was night and (a part of the night passed), Abu Ad-Darda' got 
up (to offer the night prayer), but Salman told him to sleep and Abu 
Ad-Darda' slept. After sometime Abu Ad-Darda' again got up but Salman 
told him to sleep. When it was the last hours of the night, Salman 
told him to get up then, and both of them offered the prayer. Salman 
told Abu Ad-Darda', "Your Lord has a right on you, your soul has a 
right on you, and your family has a right on you; so you should give 
the rights of all those who has a right on you." Abu Ad-Darda' came to
the Prophet and narrated the whole story. The Prophet said, "Salman 
has spoken the truth."
