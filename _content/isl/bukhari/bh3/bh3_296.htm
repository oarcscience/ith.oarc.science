My father bought a slave who practiced the profession of cupping. (My 
father broke the slave's instruments of cupping). I asked my father

the price of a dog or blood, and also forbade the profession of 
tattooing, getting tattooed and receiving or giving Riba, (usury), and
cursed the picture-makers."
