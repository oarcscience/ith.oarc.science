### Hadith 3:176

*Narrated Abdullah bin Abi Aufa:*

We were in the company of the Prophet on a journey and he was fasting,
and when the sun set, he addressed somebody, "O so-and-so, get up and
mix Sawiq with water for us." He replied, "O Allah's Apostle! (Will you
wait) till it is evening?" The Prophet said, "Get down and mix Sawiq
with water for us." He replied, "O Allah's Apostle! (If you wait) till
it is evening." The Prophet said again, "Get down and mix Sawiq with
water for us." He replied, "It is still daytime."(1) The Prophet said
again, "Get down and mix Sawiq with water for us." He got down and mixed
Sawiq for them. The Prophet drank it and then said, "When you see night
falling from this side, the fasting person should break his fast."
