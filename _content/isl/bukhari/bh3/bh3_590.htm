The Prophet said, "Allah has forbidden for you, (1) to be undutiful to
your mothers, (2) to bury your daughters alive, (3) to not to pay the 
rights of the others (e.g. charity, etc.) and (4) to beg of men 
(begging). And Allah has hated for you (1) vain, useless talk, or that
you talk too much about others, (2) to ask too many questions, (in 
disputed religious matters) and (3) to waste the wealth (by 
extravagance).
