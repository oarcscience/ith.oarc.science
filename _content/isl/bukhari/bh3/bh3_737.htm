Buraira went to Aisha, the mother of the faithful believers to seek 
her help in her emancipation Aisha said to her, "If your masters 
agree, I will pay them your price in a lump sum and manumit you." 
Buraira mentioned that offer to her masters but they refused to sell 
her unless the Wala' was for them. 'Aisha told Allah's Apostle about 
it. He said, "Buy and manumit her as the Wala' is for the liberator."
