and he agreed to change (my Dinars). He took the gold pieces in his
hands and fidgeted with them, and then said, "Wait till my storekeeper

Allah's Apostle said, 'The selling of gold for gold is Riba (usury)

barley is usury unless it is from hand to hand and equal in amount, and
dates for dates, is usury unless it is from hand to hand and equal in
amount"
