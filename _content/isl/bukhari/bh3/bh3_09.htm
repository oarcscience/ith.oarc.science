I heard Ibn 'Abbas saying, "Allah's Apostle asked an Ansari woman (Ibn
'Abbas named her but 'Ata' forgot her name), 'What prevented you from 
performing Hajj with us?' She replied, 'We have a camel and the father
of so-and-so and his son (i.e. her husband and her son) rode it and 
left one camel for us to use for irrigation.' He said (to her), 
'Perform 'Umra when Ramadan comes, for 'Umra in Ramadan is equal to 
Hajj (in reward),' or said something similar."
