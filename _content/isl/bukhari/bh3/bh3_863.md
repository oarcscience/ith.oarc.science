### Hadith 3:864

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

Allah's Apostle set out for the 'Umra but the pagans of Quraish
prevented him from reaching the Ka'ba. So, he slaughtered his sacrifice
and got his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with them that he
would perform 'Umra the following year and would not carry weapons
except swords and would not stay in Mecca except for the period they al
lowed. So, the Prophet performed the 'Umra in the following year and
entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he stayed for three
days, the pagans ordered him to depart, and he departed.
