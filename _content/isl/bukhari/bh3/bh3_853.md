### Hadith 3:854

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "If the people knew what is the reward of making
the call (for the prayer) and (of being in) the first row (in the
prayer), and if they found no other way to get this privilege except by
casting lots, they would certainly cast lots for it. If they knew the
reward of the noon prayer, they would race for it, and if they knew the
reward of the morning (i.e. Fajr) and Isha prayers, they would present
themselves for the prayer even if they had to crawl to reach there.
