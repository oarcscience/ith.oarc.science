Abdullah:
<P>
About the story of 'Aisha and their narrations were similar attesting 
each other, when the liars said what they invented about 'Aisha, and 
the Divine Inspiration was delayed, Allah's Apostle sent for 'Ali and 
Usama to consult them in divorcing his wife (i.e. 'Aisha). Usama said,
"Keep your wife, as we know nothing about her except good." Buraira 
said, "I cannot accuse her of any defect except that she is still a 
young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family's dough which the 
domestic goats come to eat (i.e. she was too simpleminded to deceive 
her husband)." Allah's Apostle said, "Who can help me to take revenge 
over the man who has harmed me by defaming the reputation of my 
family? By Allah, I have not known about my family-anything except 
good, and they mentioned (i.e. accused) a man about whom I did not 
know anything except good."
