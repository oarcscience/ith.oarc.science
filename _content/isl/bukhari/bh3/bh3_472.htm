<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:475</H3><P><I>Narrated Khabbab:</I></P>
I was a blacksmith and did some work for Al-'As bin Wail. When he owed
me some money for my work, I went to him to ask for that amount. He 
said, "I will not pay you unless you disbelieve in Muhammad." I said, 
"By Allah! I will never do that till you die and be resurrected." He 
said, "Will I be dead and then resurrected after my death?" I said, 
"Yes." He said, "There I will have property and offspring and then I 
will pay you your due." Then Allah revealed. 'Have you seen him who 
disbelieved in Our signs, and yet says: I will be given property and 
offspring?' (19.77)
