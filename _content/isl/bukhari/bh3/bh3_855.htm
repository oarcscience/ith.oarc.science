<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:856</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
It was said to the Prophet "Would that you see Abdullah bin Ubai." So,
the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims accompanied 
him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached 'Abdullah 
bin Ubai, the latter said, "Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell
of your donkey has harmed me." On that an Ansari man said (to 
'Abdullah), "By Allah! The smell of the donkey of Allah's Apostle is 
better than your smell." On that a man from 'Abdullah's tribe got 
angry for 'Abdullah's sake, and the two men abused each other which 
caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups 
started fighting with sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that 
the following Divine Verse was revealed (in this concern):-- "And if 
two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace between 
them."   (49.9)
