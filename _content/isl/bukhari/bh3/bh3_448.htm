<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:451</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Al-Bakhtari:</I></P>
I asked Ibn Umar about Salam (the fruits of) date-palms. He replied, 
"The Prophet forbade the sale of dates till their benefit becomes 
evident and fit for eating and also the sale of silver (for gold) on 
credit." I asked Ibn 'Abbas about Salam for dates and he replied, "The
Prophet forbade the sale of dates till they were fit for eating and 
could be estimated."
