<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:436</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
I heard the Prophet saying, "If a slave-girl of yours commits illegal 
sexual intercourse and her illegal sexual intercourse is proved, she 
should be lashed, and after that nobody should blame her, and if she

lashed and nobody should blame her after that, and if she does the 
offense for the third time and her illegal sexual intercourse is 
proved, she should be sold even for a hair rope."
