The Prophet said, "There is a gate in Paradise called Ar-Raiyan, and 
those who observe fasts will enter through it on the Day of 
Resurrection and none except them will enter through it. It will be 
said, 'Where are those who used to observe fasts?' They will get up, 
and none except them will enter through it. After their entry the gate
will be closed and nobody will enter through it."
