### Hadith 3:67

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

I heard the Prophet delivering a sermon at 'Arafat saying, "If a Muhrim
does not find slippers, he could wear Khuffs (but he has to cut short
the Khuffs below the ankles), and if he does not find an Izar (a waist
sheet for wrapping the lower half of the body) he could wear trousers."

[Next: 3:68: Abdullah: Allah's Apostle was asked what sort of clothes a
Muhrim should wear. ...](bh3_67)
