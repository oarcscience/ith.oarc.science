The Prophet prayed the eclipse prayer, and then said, "Hell was 
displayed so close that I said, 'O my Lord ! Am I going to be one of 
its inhabitants?"' Suddenly he saw a woman. I think he said, who was 
being scratched by a cat. He said, "What is wrong with her?" He was 
told, "She had imprisoned it (i.e. the cat) till it died of hunger."
