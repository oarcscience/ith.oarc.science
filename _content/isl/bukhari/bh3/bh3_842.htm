A man came to Allah's Apostle asking him about Islam, Allah's Apostle 
said, "You have to offer five compulsory prayers in a day and a night 
(24 hours)." The man asked, "Is there any more compulsory prayers for 
me?" Allah's Apostle said, "No, unless you like to offer Nawafil (i.e.
optional prayers)." Allah's Apostle then added, "You have to observe 
fasts during the month of Ramadan." The man said, "Am I to fast any 
other days?' Allah's Apostle said, "No, unless you wish to observe the
optional fast voluntarily." Then Allah's Apostle told him about the 
compulsory Zakat. The man asked, "Do I have to give anything besides?"
Allah's Apostle said, "No, unless you wish to give in charity 
voluntarily." So, the man departed saying, "By Allah I will neither do
more nor less than that." Allah's Apostle said, "If he has said the 
truth he will be successful."
