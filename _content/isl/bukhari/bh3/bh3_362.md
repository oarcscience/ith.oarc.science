### Hadith 3:365

*Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:*

Aisha wanted to buy Buraira and he (the Prophet ) went out for the
prayer. When he returned, she told him that they (her masters) refused
to sell her except on the condition that her Wala' would go to them. The
Prophet replied, 'The Wala' would go to him who manumits.' " Hammam
asked Nafi' whether her (Buraira's) husband was a free man or a slave.
He replied that he did not know.
