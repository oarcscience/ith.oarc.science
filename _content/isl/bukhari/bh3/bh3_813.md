*Narrated Amra bint 'Abdur-Rahman:*

That 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet told her uncle that once, while the
Prophet was in her house, she heard a man asking Hafsa's permission to
enter her house. 'Aisha said, "I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! I think the
man is Hafsa's foster uncle.' " 'Aisha added, "O Allah's Apostle! There
is a man asking the permission to enter your house." Allah's Apostle
replied, "I think the man is Hafsa's foster uncle." 'Aisha said, "If
so-and-so were living (i.e. her foster uncle) would he be allowed to
visit me?" Allah's Apostle said, "Yes, he would, as the foster relations
are treated like blood relations (in marital affairs)."
