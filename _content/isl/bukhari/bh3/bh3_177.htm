Asma bint Abi Bakr said, "We broke our fast during the lifetime of the
Prophet on a cloudy day and then the sun appeared." Hisham was asked, 
"Were they ordered to fast in lieu of that day?" He replied, "It had 
to be made up for." Ma'mar said, "I heard Hisham saying, "I don't know
whether they fasted in lieu of that day or not."
