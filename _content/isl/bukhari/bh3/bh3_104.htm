A bedouin came to the Prophet and gave a pledge of allegiance for 
embracing Islam. The next day he came with fever and said (to the 
Prophet ), "Please cancel my pledge (of embracing Islam and of 
emigrating to Medina)." The Prophet refused (that request) three times
and said, "Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad
persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect."
