<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:778</H3><P><I>Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:</I></P>
When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the Prophet they 
requested him to return their property and their captives. He said to 
them, "This concerns also other people along with me as you see, and 
the best statement to me is the true one, so you may choose one of two
alternatives; either the captives or the property and (I have not 
distributed the booty for) I have been waiting for you."
<P>
When the Prophet had returned from Ta'if, he waited for them for more 
than ten nights. When they came to know that the Prophet would not 
return except one of the two, they chose their captives. The Prophet 
then stood up amongst the Muslims, Glorified and Praised Allah as He 
deserved, and then said, "Then after: These brothers of yours have 
come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return their 
captives, so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he 
can do it, and whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay 
him from the very first Fai (i.e. war booty) which Allah will give us,
then he can do so." The people said, "We return (the captives) to them
willingly as a favor, O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "I do not 
know who of you has given his consent and who has not; so go back and 
your leaders may present your decision to me." The people went away, 
and their leaders discussed the matter with them, and then came to the
Prophet to tell him that all of them had given their consent (to 
return the captives) willingly. (Az-Zuhn, the sub-narrator said, "This
is what we know about the captives, of Hawazin.")
