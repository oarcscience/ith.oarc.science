That he used to give his verdict regarding the male or female slaves 
owned by more than one master, one of whom may manumit his share of 
the slave. Ibn 'Umar used to say in such a case, "The manumitted 
should manumit the slave completely if he has sufficient money to pay 
the rest of the price of that slave (which is to be justly estimated) 
and the other share-holders are to take the price of their shares and 
the slave is freed (released from slavery)." Ibn 'Umar narrated this 
verdict from the Prophet.
