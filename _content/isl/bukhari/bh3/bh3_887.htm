<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:888</H3><P><I>Narrated Ubai bin Kab:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Moses the Apostle of Allah," and then he 
narrated the whole story about him. Al-Khadir said to Moses, "Did not 
I tell you that you can have no patience with me." (18.72). Moses then
violated the agreement for the first time because of forgetfulness, 
then Moses promised that if he asked Al-Khadir about anything, the 
latter would have the right to desert him. Moses abided by that 
condition and on the third occasion he intentionally asked Al-Khadir 
and caused that condition to be applied. The three occasions referred 
to above are referred to by the following Verses:
<P>
"Call me not to account for forgetting And be not hard upon me." 
(18.73)
<P>
"Then they met a boy and Khadir killed him." (18.74)
<P>
"Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the verge of 
falling and Khadir set it up straight." (18.77)
