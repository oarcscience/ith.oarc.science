<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:85</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "A woman should not travel except with a Dhu-Mahram 
(her husband or a man with whom that woman cannot marry at all 
according to the Islamic Jurisprudence), and no man may visit her 
except in the presence of a Dhu-Mahram." A man got up and said, "O 
Allah's Apostle! I intend to go to such and such an army and my wife 
wants to perform Hajj." The Prophet said (to him), "Go along with her 
(to Hajj)."
