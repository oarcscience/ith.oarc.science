### Hadith 3:594

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Two persons, a Muslim and a Jew, quarrelled. The Muslim said, "By Him
Who gave Muhammad superiority over all the people! The Jew said, "By Him
Who gave Moses superiority over all the people!" At that the Muslim
raised his hand and slapped the Jew on the face. The Jew went to the
Prophet and informed him of what had happened between him and the
Muslim. The Prophet sent for the Muslim and asked him about it. The
Muslim informed him of the event. The Prophet said, "Do not give me
superiority over Moses, for on the Day of Resurrection all the people
will fall unconscious and I will be one of them, but I will. be the
first to gain consciousness, and will see Moses standing and holding the
side of the Throne (of Allah). I will not know whether (Moses) has also
fallen unconscious and got up before me, or Allah has exempted him from
that stroke."
