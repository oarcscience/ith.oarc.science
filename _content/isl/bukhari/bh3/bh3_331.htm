<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:334</H3><P><I>Narrated Nafi:</I></P>
Ibn 'Umar told us that the people used to buy food from the caravans 
in the lifetime of the Prophet. The Prophet used to forbid them to 
sell it at the very place where they had purchased it (but they were 
to wait) till they carried it to the market where foodstuff was sold. 
Ibn 'Umar said, 'The Prophet also forbade the reselling of foodstuff 
by somebody who had bought it unless he had received it with exact 
full measure'
