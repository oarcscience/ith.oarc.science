<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:327</H3><P><I>Narrated Hakim bin Hizam:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Both the buyer and the seller have the option of 
cancelling or confirming the bargain unless they separate." The 
sub-narrator, Hammam said, "I found this in my book: 'Both the buyer 
and the seller give the option of either confirming or cancelling the 
bargain three times, and if they speak the truth and mention the 
defects, then their bargain will be blessed, and if they tell lies and
conceal the defects, they might gain some financial gain but they will
deprive their sale of (Allah's) blessings."
