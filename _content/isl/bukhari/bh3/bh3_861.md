### Hadith 3:862

*Narrated Al-Bara bin 'Azib:*

When Allah's Apostle concluded a peace treaty with the people of
Hudaibiya, Ali bin Abu Talib wrote the document and he mentioned in it,
"Muhammad, Allah's Apostle ." The pagans said, "Don't write: 'Muhammad,
Allah's Apostle', for if you were an apostle we would not fight with
you." Allah's Apostle asked Ali to rub it out, but Ali said, "I will not
be the person to rub it out." Allah's Apostle rubbed it out and made
peace with them on the condition that the Prophet and his companions
would enter Mecca and stay there for three days, and that they would
enter with their weapons in cases.
