<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:452</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Al-Bakhtari:</I></P>
I asked Ibn 'Umar about Salam for dates. Ibn 'Umar replied, "The 
Prophet forbade the sale (the fruits) of datepalms until they were fit
for eating and also forbade the sale of silver for gold on credit." I 
also asked Ibn 'Abbas about it. Ibn 'Abbas replied, "The Prophet 
forbade the sale of dates till they were fit for eating, and could be 
weighed." I asked him, "What is to be weighed (as the dates are on the
trees)?" A man sitting by Ibn 'Abbas said, "It means till they are cut
and stored."
