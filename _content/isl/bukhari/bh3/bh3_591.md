### Hadith 3:592

*Narrated Abdullah bin 'Umar:*

I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian, and
responsible for what is in his custody. The ruler is a guardian of his
subjects and responsible for them; a husband is a guardian of his family
and is responsible for it; a lady is a guardian of her husband's house
and is responsible for it, and a servant is a guardian of his master's
property and is responsible for it." I heard that from Allah's Apostle
and I think that the Prophet also said, "A man is a guardian of is
father's property and is responsible for it, so all of you are guardians
and responsible for your wards and things under your care."
