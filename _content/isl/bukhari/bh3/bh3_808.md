### Hadith 3:809

*Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:*

People were (sometimes) judged by the revealing of a Divine Inspiration
during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle but now there is no longer any
more (new revelation). Now we judge you by the deeds you practice
publicly, so we will trust and favor the one who does good deeds in
front of us, and we will not call him to account about what he is really
doing in secret, for Allah will judge him for that; but we will not
trust or believe the one who presents to us with an evil deed even if he
claims that his intentions were good.
