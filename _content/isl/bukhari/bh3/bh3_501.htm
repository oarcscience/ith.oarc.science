<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:503</H3><P><I>Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:</I></P>
When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin after embracing Islam, came
to Allah's Apostle, he got up. They appealed to him to return their 
properties and their captives. Allah's Apostle said to them, "The most
beloved statement to me is the true one. So, you have the option of 
restoring your properties or your captives, for I have delayed 
distributing them." The narrator added, Allah's Apostle c had been 
waiting for them for more than ten days on his return from Taif. When 
they realized that Allah's Apostle would return to them only one of 
two things, they said, "We choose our captives." So, Allah's Apostle 
got up in the gathering of the Muslims, praised Allah as He deserved, 
and said, "Then after! These brethren of yours have come to you with 
repentance and I see it proper to return their captives to them. So, 
whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, 
and whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from 
the very first booty which Allah will give us then he can do so." The 
people replied, "We agree to give up our shares willingly as a favor 
for Allah's Apostle." Then Allah's Apostle said, "We don't know who 
amongst you has agreed and who hasn't. Go back and your chiefs may 
tell us your opinion." So, all of them returned and their chiefs 
discussed the matter with them and then they (i.e. their chiefs) came 
to Allah's Apostle to tell him that they (i.e. the people) had given 
up their shares gladly and willingly.
