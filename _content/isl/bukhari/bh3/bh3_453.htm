Abu Burda and 'Abdullah bin Shaddad sent me to 'Abdur Rahman bin Abza 
and 'Abdullah bin Abi Aufa to ask them about the Salaf (Salam). They 
said, "We used to get war booty while we were with Allah's Apostle and
when the peasants of Sham came to us we used to pay them in advance 
for wheat, barley, and oil to be delivered within a fixed period." I 
asked them, "Did the peasants own standing crops or not?" They 
replied, "We never asked them about it."
