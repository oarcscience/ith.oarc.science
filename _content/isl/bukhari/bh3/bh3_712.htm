<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:713</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
I bought Buraira but her masters put the condition that her Wala' 
would be for them. I told the Prophet about it. He said (to me), 
"Manumit her as her Wala' will be for the one who pays the price." So,
I manumitted her. The Prophet called Buraira and gave her the option 
of either staying with her husband or leaving him. She said, "Even if 
he gave me so much money, I would not stay with him," and so she 
preferred her freedom to her husband.
