### Hadith 3:291

*Narrated Hudhaifa:*

The Prophet said, "Before your time the angels received the soul of a
man and asked him, 'Did you do any good deeds (in your life)?' He
replied, 'I used to order my employees to grant time to the rich person
to pay his debts at his convenience.' So Allah said to the angels;
"Excuse him." Rabi said that (the dead man said), 'I used to be easy to
the rich and grant time to the poor.' Or, in another narration, 'grant
time to the well-off and forgive the needy,' or, 'accept from the
well-off and forgive the needy.'
