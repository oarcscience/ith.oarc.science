I was with the Prophet while he was eating spadix. He said, "From the 
trees there is a tree which resembles a faithful believer." I wanted 
to say that it was the date palm, but I was the youngest among them 
(so I kept quiet). He added, "It is the date palm." Shuraih told the 
weavers, "You are permitted to follow your own conventions to solve 
your problems (it is legal for you to stick to your traditions in 
bargain) . "
<P>
selling for eleven what you buy for ten, and you are allowed to take a
profit for expenses . "
<P>
The Prophet told Hind, "Take what is reasonable and sufficient for you
and your sons." Allah says: Whoever is poor, can eat (from the 
orphan's property) reasonably (according to his labors).
<P>
Al-Hasan hired a donkey from 'Abdullah bin Mirdas and asked him about 
the hire. The latter replied that it was for two Daniqs (a Daniq 
equals 116th Dirham). So Al-Hasan rode away. Another time, Al-Hasan 
came to 'Abdullah bin Mirdas and asked him to hire the donkey to him 
and rode away without asking him about the hire, but he sent him half 
a Dirham.
