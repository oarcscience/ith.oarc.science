<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:663</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
"Allah's Apostle sent an army towards the east coast and appointed Abu
'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of 
three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a 
place where our food was about to finish. Abu- 'Ubaida ordered us to 
collect all the journey food and it was collected. My (our) journey 
food was dates. Abu 'Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration in 
small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of
us used to be one date only." I said, "How could one date benefit 
you?" Jabir replied, "We came to know its value when even that too 
finished." Jabir added, "When we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge 
fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate from it for 
eighteen days. Then Abu 'Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed 
and they were fixed in the ground. Then he ordered that a she-camel be
ridden and it passed under the two ribs (forming an arch) without 
touching them."
