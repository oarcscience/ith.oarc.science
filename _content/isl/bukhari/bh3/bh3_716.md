### Hadith 3:717

*Narrated Ibn Aun:*

I wrote a letter to Nafi and Nafi wrote in reply to my letter that the
Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning while they
were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of
water. Their fighting men were killed and their women and children were
taken as captives; the Prophet got Juwairiya on that day. Nafi said that
Ibn 'Umar had told him the above narration and that Ibn 'Umar was in
that army.
