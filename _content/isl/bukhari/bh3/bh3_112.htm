A bedouin with unkempt hair came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O 
Allah's Apostle! Inform me what Allah has made compulsory for me as 
regards the prayers." He replied: "You have to offer perfectly the 
five compulsory prayers in a day and night (24 hours), unless you want
to pray Nawafil." The bedouin further asked, "Inform me what Allah has
made compulsory for me as regards fasting." He replied, "You have to 
fast during the whole month of Ramadan, unless you want to fast more 
as Nawafil." The bedouin further asked, "Tell me how much Zakat Allah 
has enjoined on me." Thus, Allah's Apostle informed him about all the 
rules (i.e. fundamentals) of Islam. The bedouin then said, "By Him Who
has honored you, I will neither perform any Nawafil nor will I 
decrease what Allah has enjoined on me. Allah's Apostle said, "If he 
is saying the truth, he will succeed (or he will be granted 
Paradise)."
