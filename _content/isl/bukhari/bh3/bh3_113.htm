<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:116</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
The Prophet observed the fast on the 10th of Muharram ('Ashura), and 
ordered (Muslims) to fast on that day, but when the fasting of the 
month of Ramadan was prescribed, the fasting of the 'Ashura' was 
abandoned. 'Abdullah did not use to fast on that day unless it 
coincided with his routine fasting by chance.
