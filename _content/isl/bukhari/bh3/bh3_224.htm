<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:227</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever prayed at night the whole month of 
Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then 
all his previous sins will be forgiven." Ibn Shihab (a sub-narrator) 
said, "Allah's Apostle died and the people continued observing that 
(i.e. Nawafil offered individually, not in congregation), and it 
remained as it was during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and in the early 
days of 'Umar's Caliphate." 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Abdul Qari said, "I 
went out in the company of 'Umar bin Al-Khattab one night in Ramadan 
to the mosque and found the people praying in different groups. A man 
praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him. So, 
'Umar said, 'In my opinion I would better collect these (people) under
the leadership of one Qari (Reciter) (i.e. let them pray in 
congregation!)'. So, he made up his mind to congregate them behind 
Ubai bin Ka'b. Then on another night I went again in his company and 
the people were praying behind their reciter. On that, 'Umar remarked,
'What an excellent Bid'a (i.e. innovation in religion) this is; but 
the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better 
than the one they are offering.' He meant the prayer in the last part 
of the night. (In those days) people used to pray in the early part of
the night."
