### Hadith 3:548

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair:*

An Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair in the presence of the Prophet
about the Harra Canals which were used for irrigating the date-palms.
The Ansari man said to Az-Zubair, "Let the water pass' but Az-Zubair
refused to do so. So, the case was brought before the Prophet who said
to Az-Zubair, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then let the water
pass to your neighbor." On that the Ansari got angry and said to the
Prophet, "Is it because he (i.e. Zubair) is your aunt's son?" On that
the color of the face of Allah's Apostle changed (because of anger) and
he said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water
till it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees." Zubair
said, "By Allah, I think that the following verse was revealed on this
occasion": "But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make
you judge In all disputes between them." (4.65)
