The Prophet passed by me at a place called Al-Abwa or Waddan, and was 
asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night
with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. 
The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them 
(i.e. pagans)." I also heard the Prophet saying, "The institution of 
Hima is invalid except for Allah and His Apostle."
