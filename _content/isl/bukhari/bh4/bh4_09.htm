<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:10</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
The custom (in old days) was that the property of the deceased would 
be inherited by his offspring; as for the parents (of the deceased), 
they would inherit by the will of the deceased. Then Allah cancelled 
from that custom whatever He wished and fixed for the male double the 
amount inherited by the female, and for each parent a sixth (of the 
whole legacy) and for the wife an eighth or a fourth and for the 
husband a half or a fourth.
