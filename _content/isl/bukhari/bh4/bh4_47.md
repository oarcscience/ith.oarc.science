granted Paradise by Allah, no matter whether he fights in Allah's Cause
or remains in the land where he is born." The people said, "O Allah's
Apostle ! Shall we acquaint the people with the is good news?" He said,
"Paradise has one-hundred grades which Allah has reserved for the
Mujahidin who fight in His Cause, and the distance between each of two
grades is like the distance between the Heaven and the Earth. So, when

Prophet also said, 'Above it (i.e. Al-Firdaus) is the Throne of
Beneficent (i.e. Allah), and from it originate the rivers of Paradise.")
