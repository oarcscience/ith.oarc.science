Narrted Ibn Abbas:
<P>
Allah's Apostle said, "You will be resurrected (and assembled) 
bare-footed, naked and uncircumcised." The Prophet then recited the 
Divine Verse:-- "As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it: A
promise We have undertaken. Truly we shall do it." (21.104)
<P>
He added, "The first to be dressed will be Abraham. Then some of my 
companions will take to the right and to the left. I will say: 'My 
companions! 'It will be said, 'They had been renegades since you left 
them.' I will then say what the Pious Slave Jesus, the son of Mary 
said: 'And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them; when 
You did take me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a 
Witness to all things. If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and 
if you forgive them, You, only You are the All-Mighty the All-Wise.' "
from Islam during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr who fought them".
