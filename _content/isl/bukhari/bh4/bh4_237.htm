We were in the company of Allah's Apostle (during Hajj). Whenever we 
went up a high place we used to say: "None has the right to be 
worshipped but Allah, and Allah is Greater," and our voices used to 
rise, so the Prophet said, "O people! Be merciful to yourselves (i.e. 
don't raise your voice), for you are not calling a deaf or an absent 
one, but One Who is with you, no doubt He is All-Hearer, ever Near (to
all things)."
