<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:546</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
When 'Abdullah bin Salam heard the arrival of the Prophet at Medina, 
he came to him and said, "I am going to ask you about three things 
which nobody knows except a prophet: What is the first portent of the 
Hour? What will be the first meal taken by the people of Paradise? Why
does a child resemble its father, and why does it resemble its 
maternal uncle" Allah's Apostle said, "Gabriel has just now told me of
their answers." 'Abdullah said, "He (i.e. Gabriel), from amongst all 
the angels, is the enemy of the Jews." Allah's Apostle said, "The 
first portent of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the 
people from the east to the west; the first meal of the people of 
Paradise will be Extra-lobe (caudate lobe) of fish-liver. As for the 
resemblance of the child to its parents: If a man has sexual 
intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will 
resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child 
will resemble her." On that 'Abdullah bin Salam said, "I testify that 
you are the Apostle of Allah." 'Abdullah bin Salam further said, "O 
Allah's Apostle! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know 
about my conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they 
would tell a lie about me." The Jews came to Allah's Apostle and 
'Abdullah went inside the house. Allah's Apostle asked (the Jews), 
"What kind of man is 'Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?" They replied, 
"He is the most learned person amongst us, and the best amongst us, 
and the son of the best amongst us." Allah's Apostle said, "What do 
you think if he embraces Islam (will you do as he does)?" The Jews 
said, "May Allah save him from it." Then 'Abdullah bin Salam came out 
in front of them saying, "I testify that None has the right to be 
worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah." 
Thereupon they said, "He is the evilest among us, and the son of the 
evilest amongst us," and continued talking badly of him.
