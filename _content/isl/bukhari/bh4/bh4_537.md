### Hadith 4:534

*Narrated 'Abdullah:*

Once we were in the company of Allah's Apostle in a cave.
Surat-al-Mursalat (77) was revealed there, and we were learning it from
Allah's Apostle . Suddenly a snake came out of its hole and we rushed
towards it to kill it, but it hastened and entered its hole before we
were able to catch it. Allah's Apostle said," It has been saved from
your evil and you have been saved from its evil."
