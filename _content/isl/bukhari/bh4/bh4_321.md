### Hadith 4:317

*Narrated Abdullah:*

When the Prophet returned (from Jihad), he would say Takbir thrice and
add, "We are returning, if Allah wishes, with repentance and worshipping
and praising (our Lord) and prostrating ourselves before our Lord. Allah
fulfilled His Promise and helped His Slave, and He Alone defeated the
(infidel) clans."
