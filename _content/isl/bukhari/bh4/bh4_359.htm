<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:355</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</I></P>
A bedouin asked the Prophet, "A man may fight for the sake of booty, 
and another may fight so that he may be mentioned by the people, and a
third may fight to show his position (i.e. bravery); which of these 
regarded as fighting in Allah's Cause?" The Prophet said, "He who 
fights so that Allah's Word (i.e. Islam) should be superior, fights 
for Allah's Cause."
