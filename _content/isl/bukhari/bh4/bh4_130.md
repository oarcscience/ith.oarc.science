### Hadith 4:129

*Narrated Anas:*

Allah's Apostle went to the daughter of Milhan and reclined there (and
slept) and then (woke up) smiling. She asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What
makes you smile?" He replied, (I dreamt that) some people amongst my
followers were sailing on the green sea in Allah's Cause, resembling
kings on thrones." She said, "O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me
one of them." He said, "O Allah! Let her be one of them." Then he (slept
again and woke up and) smiled. She asked him the same question and he
gave the same reply. She said, "Invoke Allah to make me one of them." He
replied, ''You will be amongst the first group of them; you will not be
amongst the last." Later on she married 'Ubada bin As-Samit and then she
sailed on the sea with bint Qaraza, Mu'awiya's wife (for Jihad). On her
return, she mounted her riding animal, which threw her down breaking her
neck, and she died on falling down.
