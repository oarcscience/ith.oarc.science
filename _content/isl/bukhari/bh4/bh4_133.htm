<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:132</H3><P><I>Narrated Tha'laba bin Abi Malik:</I></P>
'Umar bin Al-Khattab distributed some garments amongst the women of 
Medina. One good garment remained, and one of those present with him 
said, "O chief of the believers! Give this garment to your wife, the 
(grand) daughter of Allah's Apostle." They meant Um Kulthum, the 
daughter of 'Ali. 'Umar said, Um Salit has more right (to have it)." 
Um Salit was amongst those Ansari women who had given the pledge of 
allegiance to Allah's Apostle.' 'Umar said, "She (i.e. Um Salit) used 
to carry the water skins for us on the day of Uhud."
