<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:469</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "The first batch (of people) who will enter 
Paradise will be (glittering) like a full moon; and those who will 
enter next will be (glittering) like the brightest star. Their hearts 
will be as if the heart of a single man, for they will have no enmity 
amongst themselves, and everyone of them shall have two wives, each of
whom will be so beautiful, pure and transparent that the marrow of the
bones of their legs will be seen through the flesh. They will be 
glorifying Allah in the morning and evening, and will never fall ill, 
and they will neither blow their noses, nor spit. Their utensils will 
be of gold and silver, and their combs will be of gold, and the fuel 
used in their centers will be the aloes-wood, and their sweat will 
smell like musk."
