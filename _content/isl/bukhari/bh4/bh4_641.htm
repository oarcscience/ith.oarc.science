When the Verse:-- 'Those who believe and mix not their belief with 
wrong." was revealed, the companions of the Prophet said, "Who amongst
us has not mixed his belief with wrong?" Then Allah revealed: "Join 
none in worship with Allah, Verily joining others in worship with 
Allah is a great wrong indeed."
