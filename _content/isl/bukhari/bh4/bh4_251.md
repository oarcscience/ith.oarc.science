### Hadith 4:249

*Narrated Abu Bashir Al-Ansari:*

That he was in the company of Allah's Apostle on some of his journeys.
(The sub-narrator 'Abdullah adds, "I think that Abu Bashir also said,
'And the people were at their sleeping places.") Allah's Apostle sent a
messenger ordering: "There shall not remain any necklace of string or
any other kind of necklace round the necks of camels except it is cut
off."
