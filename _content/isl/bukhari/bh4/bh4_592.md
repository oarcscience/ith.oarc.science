### Hadith 4:589

*Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila:*

Ka'b bin Ujrah met me and said, "Shall I not give you a present I got
from the Prophet?" 'Abdur-Rahman said, "Yes, give it to me." I said, "We
asked Allah's Apostle saying, 'O Allah's Apostle! How should one (ask
Allah to) send blessings on you, the members of the family, for Allah
has taught us how to salute you (in the prayer)?' He said, 'Say: O
Allah! Send Your Mercy on Muhammad and on the family of Muhammad, as You
sent Your Mercy on Abraham and on the family of Abraham, for You are the
Most Praise-worthy, the Most Glorious. O Allah! Send Your Blessings on
Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as You sent your Blessings on
Abraham and on the family of Abraham, for You are the Most
Praise-worthy, the Most Glorious.' "
