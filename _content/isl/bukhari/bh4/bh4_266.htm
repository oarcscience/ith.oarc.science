<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:264</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle sent a group of Ansari men to kill Abu-Rafi. One of 
them set out and entered their (i.e. the enemies) fort. That man said,
"I hid myself in a stable for their animals. They closed the fort 
gate. Later they lost a donkey of theirs, so they went out in its 
search. I, too, went out along with them, pretending to look for it. 
They found the donkey and entered their fort. And I, too, entered 
along with them. They closed the gate of the fort at night, and kept 
its keys in a small window where I could see them. When those people 
slept, I took the keys and opened the gate of the fort and came upon 
Abu Rafi and said, 'O Abu Rafi. When he replied me, I proceeded 
towards the voice and hit him. He shouted and I came out to come back,
pretending to be a helper. I said, 'O Abu Rafi, changing the tone of 
my voice. He asked me, 'What do you want; woe to your mother?' I asked
him, 'What has happened to you?' He said, 'I don't know who came to me
and hit me.' Then I drove my sword into his belly and pushed it 
forcibly till it touched the bone. Then I came out, filled with 
puzzlement and went towards a ladder of theirs in order to get down 
but I fell down and sprained my foot. I came to my companions and 
said, 'I will not leave till I hear the wailing of the women.' So, I 
did not leave till I heard the women bewailing Abu Rafi, the merchant 
pf Hijaz. Then I got up, feeling no ailment, (and we proceeded) till 
we came upon the Prophet and informed him."
