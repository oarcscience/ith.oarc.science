<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:550</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Allah has appointed an angel in the womb, and the 
angel says, 'O Lord! A drop of discharge (i.e. of semen), O Lord! a 
clot, O Lord! a piece of flesh.' And then, if Allah wishes to complete
the child's creation, the angel will say. 'O Lord! A male or a female?
O Lord! wretched or blessed (in religion)? What will his livelihood 
be? What will his age be?' The angel writes all this while the child 
is in the womb of its mother."
