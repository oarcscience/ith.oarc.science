<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:307</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet got up amongst us and mentioned Al Ghulul, emphasized its 
magnitude and declared that it was a great sin saying, "Don't commit 
Ghulul for I should not like to see anyone amongst you on the Day of 
Ressurection, carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating, or
carrying over his neck a horse that will be neighing. Such a man will 
be saying: 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah for me,' and I 
will reply, 'I can't help you, for I have conveyed Allah's Message to 
you Nor should I like to see a man carrying over his neck, a camel 
that will be grunting. Such a man will say, 'O Allah's Apostle! 
Intercede with Allah for me, and I will say, 'I can't help you for I 
have conveyed Allah's Message to you,' or one carrying over his neck 
gold and silver and saying, 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah 
for me,' and I will say, 'I can't help you for I have conveyed Allah's
Message to you,' or one carrying clothes that will be fluttering, and 
the man will say, 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah for me.' 
And I will say, 'I can't help you, for I have conveyed Allah's Message
to you."
