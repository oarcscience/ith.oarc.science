### Hadith 4:447

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

I stuffed for the Prophet a pillow decorated with pictures (of animals)
which looked like a Namruqa (i.e. a small cushion). He came and stood
among the people with excitement apparent on his face. I said, "O
Allah's Apostle! What is wrong?" He said, "What is this pillow?" I said,
"I have prepared this pillow for you, so that you may recline on it." He
said, "Don't you know that angels do not enter a house wherein there are
pictures; and whoever makes a picture will be punished on the Day of
Resurrection and will be asked to give life to (what he has created)?"
