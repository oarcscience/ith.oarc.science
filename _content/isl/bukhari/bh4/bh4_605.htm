I asked Um Ruman, 'Aisha's mother about the accusation forged against 
'Aisha. She said, "While I was sitting with 'Aisha, an Ansari woman 
came to us and said, 'Let Allah condemn such-and-such person.' I asked
her, 'Why do you say so?' She replied, 'For he has spread the 
(slanderous) story.' 'Aisha said, 'What story?' The woman then told 
her the story. 'Aisha asked, 'Have Abu Bakr and Allah's Apostle heard 
about it ?' She said, 'Yes.' 'Aisha fell down senseless (on hearing 
that), and when she came to her senses, she got fever and shaking of 
the body. The Prophet came and asked, 'What is wrong with her?' I 
said, 'She has got fever because of a story which has been rumored.' 
'Aisha got up and said, 'By Allah! Even if I took an oath, you would 
not believe me, and if I put forward an excuse, You would not excuse 
me. My example and your example is just like that example of Jacob and
his sons. Against that which you assert, it is Allah (Alone) Whose 
Help can be sought.' (12.18) The Prophet left and then Allah revealed 
the Verses (concerning the matter), and on that 'Aisha said, 'Thanks 
to Allah (only) and not to anybody else."
