Sad used to teach his sons the following words as a teacher teaches 
his students the skill of writing and used to say that Allah's Apostle
used to seek Refuge with Allah from them (i.e. the evils) at the end 
of every prayer. The words are:
<P>
'O Allah! I seek refuge with You from cowardice, and seek refuge with 
You from being brought back to a bad stage of old life and seek refuge
with You from the afflictions of the world, and seek refuge with You 
from the punishments in the grave.'
