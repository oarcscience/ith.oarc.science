<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:318</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
We were in the company of the Prophet while returning from 'Usfan, and
Allah's Apostle was riding his she-camel keeping Safiya bint Huyay 
riding behind him. His she-camel slipped and both of them fell down. 
Abu Talha jumped from his camel and said, "O Allah's Apostle! May 
Allah sacrifice me for you." The Prophet said, "Take care of the 
lady." So, Abu Talha covered his face with a garment and went to 
Safiya and covered her with it, and then he set right the condition of
their shecamel so that both of them rode, and we were encircling 
Allah's Apostle like a cover. When we approached Medina, the Prophet 
said, "We are returning with repentance and worshipping and praising 
our Lord." He kept on saying this till he entered Medina.
