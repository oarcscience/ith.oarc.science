### Hadith 4:175

*Narrated Khalid bin Madan:*

That 'Umair bin Al-Aswad Al-Anasi told him that he went to 'Ubada bin
As-Samit while he was staying in his house at the sea-shore of Hims with
(his wife) Um Haram. 'Umair said. Um Haram informed us that she heard
the Prophet saying, "Paradise is granted to the first batch of my
followers who will undertake a naval expedition." Um Haram added, I
said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Will I be amongst them?' He replied, 'You are
amongst them.' The Prophet then said, 'The first army amongst' my
followers who will invade Caesar's City will be forgiven their sins.' I
asked, 'Will I be one of them, O Allah's Apostle?' He replied in the
negative."
