<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:505</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "When the call for the prayer is pronounced, Satan 
takes to his heels, passing wind with noise, When the call for the 
prayer is finished, he comes back. And when the Iqama is pronounced, 
he again takes to his heels, and after its completion, he returns 
again to interfere between the (praying) person and his heart, saying 
to him. 'Remember this or that thing.' till the person forgets whether
he has offered three or four Rakat: so if one forgets whether he has 
prayed three or four Rak'a-t, he should perform two prostrations of 
Sahu (i.e. forgetfulness)."
