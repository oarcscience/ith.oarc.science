<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:167</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle went out to answer the call of nature and on his 
return I brought some water to him. He performed the ablution while he
was wearing a Sha'mi cloak. He rinsed his mouth and washed his nose by
putting water in it and then blowing it out, and washed his face. Then
he tried to take out his hands through his sleeves but they were 
tight, so he took them out from underneath, washed them and passed wet
hands over his head and over his leather socks.
