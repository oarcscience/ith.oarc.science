<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:612</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</I></P>
That he differed with Al-Hur bin Qais Al-Fazari regarding the 
companion of Moses. Ibn 'Abbas said that he was Al-Khadir. Meanwhile 
Ubai bin Ka'b passed by them and Ibn 'Abbas called him saying, "My 
friend and I have differed regarding Moses' companion whom Moses asked
the way to meet. Have you heard Allah's Apostle mentioning something 
about him?" He said, "Yes, I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'While 
Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a man came and 
asked (him), 'Do you know anyone who is more learned than you?' Moses 
replied, 'No.' So, Allah sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: 'Yes, 
Our slave, Khadir (is more learned than you).' Moses asked how to meet
him (i.e. Khadir). So, the fish, was made, as a sign for him, and he 
was told that when the fish was lost, he should return and there he 
would meet him. So, Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in 
the sea. The servant boy of Moses said to him, 'Do you know that when 
we were sitting by the side of the rock, I forgot the fish, and t was 
only Satan who made me forget to tell (you) about it.' Moses said, 
That was what we were seeking after,' and both of them returned, 
following their footmarks and found Khadir; and what happened further 
to them, is mentioned in Allah's Book."
