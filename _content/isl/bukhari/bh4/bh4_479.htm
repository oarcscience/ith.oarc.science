The Prophet said "There is a tree in Paradise (which is so big and 
huge that) a rider could travel in its shade for a hundred years. And 
if you wish, you can recite:--'In shade long extended..' (56. 30) and 
a place in Paradise equal to an arrow bow of one of you, is better 
than (the whole earth) on which the sun rises and sets."
