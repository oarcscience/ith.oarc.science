<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:616</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "(The Prophet) Moses was a shy person and used 
to cover his body completely because of his extensive shyness. One of 
the children of Israel hurt him by saying, 'He covers his body in this
way only because of some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal
hernia, or he has some other defect.' Allah wished to clear Moses of 
what they said about him, so one day while Moses was in seclusion, he 
took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a 
bath. When he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so 
as to take them, but the stone took his clothes and fled; Moses picked
up his stick and ran after the stone saying, 'O stone! Give me my 
garment!' Till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked 
then, and found him the best of what Allah had created, and Allah 
cleared him of what they had accused him of. The stone stopped there 
and Moses took and put his garment on and started hitting the stone 
with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has some traces of the 
hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Allah refers to in 
His Saying:-- "O you who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed 
Moses, But Allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged, And 
he was honorable In Allah's Sight." (33.69)
