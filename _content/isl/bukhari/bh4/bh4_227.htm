<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:225</H3><P><I>Narrated Salama:</I></P>
Once the journey-food of the people ran short and they were in great 
need. So, they came to the Prophet to take his permission for 
slaughtering their camels, and he permitted them. Then 'Umar met them 
and they informed him about it. He said, "What will sustain you after 
your camels (are finished)?" Then 'Umar went to the Prophet and said, 
"O Allah's Apostle! What will sustain them after their camels (are 
finished)?" Allah's Apostle said, "Make an announcement amongst the 
people that they should bring all their remaining food (to me)." (They
brought it and) the Prophet invoked Allah and asked for His Blessings 
for it. Then he asked them to bring their food utensils and the people
started filling their food utensils with their hands till they were 
satisfied. Allah's Apostle then said, "I testify that None has the 
right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am His Apostle. "
