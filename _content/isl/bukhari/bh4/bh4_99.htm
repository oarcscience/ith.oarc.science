<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:98</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Aun:</I></P>
Once Musa bin Anas while describing the battle of Yamama, said, "Anas 
bin Malik went to Thabit bin Qais, who had lifted his clothes from his
thighs and was applying Hunut to his body. Anas asked, 'O Uncle! What 
is holding you back (from the battle)?' He replied, 'O my nephew! I am
coming just now,' and went on perfuming himself with Hunut, then he 
came and sat (in the row). Anas then mentioned that the people fled 
from the battle-field. On that Thabit said, 'Clear the way for me to 
fight the enemy. We would never do so (i.e. flee) in the company of 
Allah's Apostle. How bad the habits you have acquired from your 
enemies!"
