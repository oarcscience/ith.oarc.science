<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:384</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Umar bin Dinar:</I></P>
I was sitting with Jabir bin Zaid and 'Amr bin Aus, and Bjalla was 
narrating to them in 70 A.H. the year when Musab bin Az-Zubair was the
leader of the pilgrims of Basra. We were sitting at the steps of 
Zam-zam well and Bajala said, "I was the clerk of Juz bin Muawiya, 
Al-Ahnaf's paternal uncle. A letter came from 'Umar bin Al-Khattab one
year before his death; and it was read:-- "Cancel every marriage 
contracted among the Magians between relatives of close kinship 
(marriages that are regarded illegal in Islam: a relative of this sort
being called Dhu-Mahram.)" 'Umar did not take the Jizya from the 
Magian infidels till 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf testified that Allah's 
Apostle had taken the Jizya from the Magians of Hajar.
