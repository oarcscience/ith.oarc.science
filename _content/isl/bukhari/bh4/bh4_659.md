### Hadith 4:656

*Narrated*

Narrted Ibn Abbas:

Allah's Apostle said, "You will be resurrected (and assembled)
bare-footed, naked and uncircumcised." The Prophet then recited the
Divine Verse:-- "As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it: A
promise We have undertaken. Truly we shall do it." (21.104)

He added, "The first to be dressed will be Abraham. Then some of my
companions will take to the right and to the left. I will say: 'My
companions! 'It will be said, 'They had been renegades since you left
them.' I will then say what the Pious Slave Jesus, the son of Mary said:
'And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them; when You did
take me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all
things. If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if you forgive
them, You, only You are the All-Mighty the All-Wise.' " from Islam
during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr who fought them".
