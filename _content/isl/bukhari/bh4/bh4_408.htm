We did not, write anything from the Prophet except the Quran and what 
is written in this paper, (wherein) the Prophet said, "Medina is a 
sanctuary from (the mountain of) Air to so and-so, therefore, whoever 
innovates (in it) an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such
an innovator, will incur the Curse of Allah. the angels and all the 
people; and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship 
will be accepted And the asylum granted by any Muslim Is to be secured
by all the Muslims even if it is granted by one of the lowest social 
status among them. And whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect will 
incur the Curse of Allah, the angels and all the people, and his 
compulsory and optional good deeds of worship will not be accepted. 
And any freed slave will take as masters (befriends) people other than
his own real masters who freed him without taking the permission of 
the latter, will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels and all the 
people, and his compulsory and optional good deeds of worship will not
be accepted."

Dhimmis)?" on that someone asked him, "What makes you know that this 
state will take place, O Abu- Hu raira?" He said, "By Him in Whose 
Hands Abu Huraira's life is, I know it through the statement of the 
true and truly inspired one (i.e. the Prophet)." The people asked, 
"What does the Statement say?" He replied, "Allah and His Apostle's 
asylum granted to Dhimmis, i.e. non-Muslims living in a Muslim 
territory) will be outraged, and so Allah will make the hearts of 
these Dhimmis so daring that they will refuse to pay the Jizya they 
will be supposed to pay."
