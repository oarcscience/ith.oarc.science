### Hadith 4:617

*Narrated Abdullah:*

Once the Prophet distributed something (among his followers. A man said,
"This distribution has not been done (with justice) seeking Allah's
Countenance." I went to the Prophet and told him (of that). He became so
angry that I saw the signs of anger oh his face. Then he said, "May
Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses, for he was harmed more (in a worse
manner) than this; yet he endured patiently."
