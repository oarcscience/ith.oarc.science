<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:581</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
One day some meat was given to the Prophet and he said, "On the Day of
Resurrection Allah will gather all the first and the last (people) in 
one plain, and the voice of the announcer will reach all of them, and 
one will be able to see them all, and the sun will come closer to 
them." (The narrator then mentioned the narration of intercession): 
"The people will go to Abraham and say: 'You are Allah's Prophet and 
His Khalil on the earth. Will you intercede for us with your Lord?' 
Abraham will then remember his lies and say: 'Myself! Myself! Go to 
Moses."
