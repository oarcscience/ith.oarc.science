<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:635</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Solomon (the son of) David said, 'Tonight I will 
sleep with seventy ladies each of whom will conceive a child who will 
be a knight fighting for "Allah's Cause.' His companion said, 'If 
Allah will.' But Solomon did not say so; therefore none of those women
got pregnant except one who gave birth to a half child." The Prophet 
further said, "If the Prophet Solomon had said it (i.e. 'If Allah 
will') he would have begotten children who would have fought in 
Allah's Cause." Shuaib and Ibn Abi Az-Zinad said, "Ninety (women) is 
more correct (than seventy)."
