### Hadith 4:352

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Allah guarantees him who strives in His Cause and
whose motivation for going out is nothing but Jihad in His Cause and
belief in His Word, that He will admit him into Paradise (if martyred)
or bring him back to his dwelling place, whence he has come out, with
what he gains of reward and booty."
