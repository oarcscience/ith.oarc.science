### Hadith 4:162

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

That he participated in a Ghazwa (Holy-Battle) in the company of Allah's
Apostle. Midday came upon them while they were in a valley having many
thorny trees. The people dispersed to rest in the shade of the trees.
The Prophet rested under a tree, hung his sword on it, and then slept.
Then he woke up to find near to him, a man whose presence he had not
noticed before. The Prophet said, "This (man) took my sword (out of its
scabbard) and said, 'Who will save you from me.' I replied, 'Allah.' So,
he put the sword back into its scabbard, and you see him sitting here."
Anyhow, the Prophet did not punish him. (See Hadith No. 158)
