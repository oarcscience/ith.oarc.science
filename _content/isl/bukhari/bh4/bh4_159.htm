<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:158</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:</I></P>
That he proceeded in the company of Allah's Apostle towards Najd to 
participate in a Ghazwa. (Holy-battle) When Allah's Apostle returned, 
he too returned with him. Midday came upon them while they were in a 
valley having many thorny trees. Allah's Apostle and the people 
dismounted and dispersed to rest in the shade of the trees. Allah's 
Apostle rested under a tree and hung his sword on it. We all took a 
nap and suddenly we heard Allah's Apostle calling us. (We woke up) to 
see a bedouin with him. The Prophet said, "This bedouin took out my 
sword while I was sleeping and when I woke up, I found the unsheathed 
sword in his hand and he challenged me saying, 'Who will save you from
me?' I said thrice, 'Allah.' The Prophet did not punish him but sat 
down.
