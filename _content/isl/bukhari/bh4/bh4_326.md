### Hadith 4:322

*Narrated Muharib bin Dithar:*

Jabir bin 'Abdullah said, "When Allah's Apostle arrived at Medina, he
slaughtered a camel or a cow." Jabir added, "The Prophet bought a camel
from me for two Uqiyas (of gold) and one or two Dirhams. When he reached
Sirar, he ordered that a cow be slaughtered and they ate its meat. When
he arrived at Medina, he ordered me to go to the Mosque and offer two
Rakat, and weighed (and gave) me the price of the camel."
