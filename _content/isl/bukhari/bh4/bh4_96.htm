<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:95</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, "Nothing worries me as 
to what will happen to you after me, except the temptation of worldly 
blessings which will be conferred on you." Then he mentioned the 
worldly pleasures. He started with the one (i.e. the blessings) and 
took up the other (i.e. the pleasures). A man got up saying, "O 
Allah's Apostle! Can the good bring about evil?" The Prophet remained 
silent and we thought that he was being inspired divinely, so all the 
people kept silent with awe. Then the Prophet wiped the sweat off his 
face and asked, "Where is the present questioner?" "Do you think 
wealth is good?" he repeated thrice, adding, "No doubt, good produces 
nothing but good. Indeed it is like what grows on the banks of a 
stream which either kills or nearly kills the grazing animals because 
of gluttony except the vegetation-eating animal which eats till both 
its flanks are full (i.e. till it gets satisfied) and then stands in 
the sun and defecates and urinates and again starts grazing. This 
worldly property is sweet vegetation. How excellent the wealth of the 
Muslim is, if it is collected through legal means and is spent in 
Allah's Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers. But he who 
does not take it legally is like an eater who is never satisfied and 
his wealth will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection."
