<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:368</H3><P><I>Narrated Jubair bin Mutim:</I></P>
I and 'Uthman bin 'Affan went to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's 
Apostle! You have given to Bani Al-Muttalib and left us although they 
and we are of the same kinship to you." Allah's Apostle said, "Bani 
Muttalib and Bani Hashim are one and the same." The Prophet did not 
give a share to Bani Abd Shams and Bani Naufai. (Ibn Ishaq said, "Abd 
Shams and Hashim and Al-Muttalib were maternal brothers and their 
mother was 'Atika bint Murra and Naufal was their paternal brother.)
