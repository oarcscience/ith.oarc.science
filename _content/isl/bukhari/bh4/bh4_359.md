### Hadith 4:355

*Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:*

A bedouin asked the Prophet, "A man may fight for the sake of booty, and
another may fight so that he may be mentioned by the people, and a third
may fight to show his position (i.e. bravery); which of these regarded
as fighting in Allah's Cause?" The Prophet said, "He who fights so that
Allah's Word (i.e. Islam) should be superior, fights for Allah's Cause."
