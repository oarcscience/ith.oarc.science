<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:204</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
That heard Allah's Apostle saying, "We are the last but will be the 
foremost to enter Paradise)." The Prophet added, "He who obeys me, 
obeys Allah, and he who disobeys me, disobeys Allah. He who obeys the 
chief, obeys me, and he who disobeys the chief, disobeys me. The Imam 
is like a shelter for whose safety the Muslims should fight and where 
they should seek protection. If the Imam orders people with 
righteousness and rules justly, then he will be rewarded for that, and
if he does the opposite, he will be responsible for that."
