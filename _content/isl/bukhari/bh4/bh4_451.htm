I stuffed for the Prophet a pillow decorated with pictures (of 
animals) which looked like a Namruqa (i.e. a small cushion). He came 
and stood among the people with excitement apparent on his face. I 
said, "O Allah's Apostle! What is wrong?" He said, "What is this 
pillow?" I said, "I have prepared this pillow for you, so that you may
recline on it." He said, "Don't you know that angels do not enter a 
house wherein there are pictures; and whoever makes a picture will be 
punished on the Day of Resurrection and will be asked to give life to 
(what he has created)?"
