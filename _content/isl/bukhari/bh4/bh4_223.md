### Hadith 4:221

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

Abu Sufyan said, "Heraclius sent for me when I was in 'llya' (i.e.
Jerusalem). Then he asked for the letter of Allah's Apostle and when he
had finished its reading there was a great hue and cry around him and
the voices grew louder and we were asked to quit the place. When we were
turned out, I said to my companions, 'The cause of Ibn Abi Kabsha has
become conspicuous as the King of Bani Al-Asfar is afraid of him.' "
