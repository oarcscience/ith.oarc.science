### Hadith 4:463

*Narrated Abdullah bin 'Umar:*

Allah's Apostle said, "When anyone of you dies, he will be shown his
destination both in the morning and in the evening, and if he belongs to
the people of Paradise, he will be shown his place in Paradise, and if
he is from the people of Hell, he will be shown his place in Hell."
