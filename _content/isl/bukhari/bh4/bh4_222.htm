Allah's Apostle said, "I have been sent with the shortest expressions 
bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with

my hand." Abu Huraira added: Allah's Apostle has left the world and 
now you, people, are bringing out those treasures (i.e. the Prophet 
did not benefit by them).
