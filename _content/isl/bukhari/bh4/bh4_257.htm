The Prophet said, "Three persons will get their reward twice. (One is)
a person who has a slave girl and he educates her properly and teaches
her good manners properly (without violence) and then manumits and 
marries her. Such a person will get a double reward. (Another is) a 
believer from the people of the scriptures who has been a true 
believer and then he believes in the Prophet (Muhammad). Such a person
will get a double reward. (The third is) a slave who observes Allah's 
Rights and Obligations and is sincere to his master."
