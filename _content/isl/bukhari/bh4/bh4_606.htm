<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:603</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Urwa:</I></P>
I asked 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet about the meaning of the 
following Verse: -- "(Respite will be granted) 'Until when the 
apostles give up hope (of their people) and thought that they were 
denied (by their people)..............."(12.110) 'Aisha replied, 
"Really, their nations did not believe them." I said, "By Allah! They 
were definite that their nations treated them as liars and it was not 
a matter of suspecting." 'Aisha said, "O 'Uraiya (i.e. 'Urwa)! No 
doubt, they were quite sure about it."
<P>
I said, "May the Verse be read in such a way as to mean that the 
apostles thought that Allah did not help them?" Aisha said, "Allah 
forbid! (Impossible) The Apostles did not suspect their Lord of such a
thing. But this Verse is concerned with the Apostles' followers who 
had faith in their Lord and believed in their apostles and their 
period of trials was long and Allah's Help was delayed till the 
apostles gave up hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst 
their nation and suspected that even their followers were shaken in 
Prophet said, "The honorable, the son of the honorable, the son of the
honorable, (was) Joseph, the son of Jacob! the son of Isaac, the son 
of Abraham."
