On the day (of the battle) of the Trench, the Ansar were saying, "We 
are those who have sworn allegiance to Muhammad for Jihaid (for ever) 
as long as we live." The Prophet replied to them, "O Allah! There is

emigrants with Your Generosity."
<P>
requested him to take the pledge of allegiance from us for migration. 
He said, "Migration has passed away with its people." I asked, "For 
what will you take the pledge of allegiance from us then?" He said, "I
will take (the pledge) for Islam and Jihad."
