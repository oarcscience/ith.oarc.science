The Prophet said, "Avoid the seven great destructive sins." The people

in worship along with Allah, to practice sorcery, to kill the life 
which Allah has forbidden except for a just cause, (according to 
Islamic law), to eat up Riba (usury), to eat up an orphan's wealth, to
give back to the enemy and fleeing from the battlefield at the time of
fighting, and to accuse, chaste women, who never even think of 
anything touching chastity and are good believers.
