### Hadith 4:130

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

Whenever the Prophet intended to proceed on a journey, he used to draw
lots amongst his wives and would take the one upon whom the lot fell.
Once, before setting out for Jihad, he drew lots amongst us and the lot
came to me; so I went with the Prophet; and that happened after the
revelation of the Verse Hijab (i.e. veiling).
