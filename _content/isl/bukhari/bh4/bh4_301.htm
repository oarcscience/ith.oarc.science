<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:297</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
We were in the company of Allah's Apostle in a Ghazwa, and he remarked
about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, saying, "This (man) is from 
the people of the (Hell) Fire." When the battle started, the man 
fought violently till he got wounded. Somebody said, "O Allah's 
Apostle! The man whom you described as being from the people of the 
(Hell) Fire fought violently today and died." The Prophet said, "He 
will go to the (Hell) Fire." Some people were on the point of doubting
(the truth of what the Prophet had said) while they were in this 
state, suddenly someone said that he was still alive but severely 
wounded. When night fell, he lost patience and committed suicide. The 
Prophet was informed of that, and he said, "Allah is Greater! I 
testify that I am Allah's Slave and His Apostle." Then he ordered 
Bilal to announce amongst the people: 'None will enter Paradise but a 
Muslim, and Allah may support this religion (i.e. Islam) even with a 
disobedient man.'
