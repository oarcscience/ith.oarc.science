### Hadith 4:208

*Narrated Anas:*

On the day (of the battle) of the Trench, the Ansar were saying, "We are
those who have sworn allegiance to Muhammad for Jihaid (for ever) as
long as we live." The Prophet replied to them, "O Allah! There is no
life except the life of the Hereafter. So honor the Ansar and emigrants
with Your Generosity."

requested him to take the pledge of allegiance from us for migration. He
said, "Migration has passed away with its people." I asked, "For what
will you take the pledge of allegiance from us then?" He said, "I will
take (the pledge) for Islam and Jihad."
