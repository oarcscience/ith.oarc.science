'Aisha said If the Prophet saw a cloud In the sky, he would walk to 
and fro in agitation, go out and come in, and the color of his face 
would change, and if it rained, he would feel relaxed." So 'Aisha knew
that state of his. So the Prophet said, I don't know (am afraid), it 
may be similar to what happened to some people referred to in the Holy
Quran in the following Verse: -- "Then when they saw it as a dense 
cloud coming towards their valleys, they said, 'This is a cloud 
bringing us rain!' Nay, but, it is that (torment) which you were 
asking to be hastened a wind wherein is severe torment." (46.24)
