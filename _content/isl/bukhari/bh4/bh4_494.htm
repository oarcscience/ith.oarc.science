<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:490</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
Magic was worked on the Prophet so that he began to fancy that he was 
doing a thing which he was not actually doing. One day he invoked 
(Allah) for a long period and then said, "I feel that Allah has 
inspired me as how to cure myself. Two persons came to me (in my 
dream) and sat, one by my head and the other by my feet. One of them 
asked the other, "What is the ailment of this man?" The other replied,
'He has been bewitched" The first asked, 'Who has bewitched him?' The 
other replied, 'Lubaid bin Al-A'sam.' The first one asked, 'What 
material has he used?' The other replied, 'A comb, the hair gathered 
on it, and the outer skin of the pollen of the male date-palm.' The 
first asked, 'Where is that?' The other replied, 'It is in the well of
Dharwan.' " So, the Prophet went out towards the well and then 
returned and said to me on his return, "Its date-palms (the date-palms
near the well) are like the heads of the devils." I asked, "Did you 
take out those things with which the magic was worked?" He said, "No, 
for I have been cured by Allah and I am afraid that this action may 
spread evil amongst the people." Later on the well was filled up with 
earth.
