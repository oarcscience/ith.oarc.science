### Hadith 4:517

*Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abdullah bin Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Sasaa*

Ansari:

That Abu Said Al-Khudri said to his father. "I see you are fond of sheep
and the desert, so when you want to pronounce the Adhan, raise your
voice with it for whoever will hear the Adhan whether a human being, or
a Jinn, or anything else, will bear witness, in favor on the Day of
Resurrection." Abu Said added, "I have heard this from Allah's Apostle
."
