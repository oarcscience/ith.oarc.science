### Hadith 4:155

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

Allah's Apostle came to my house while two girls were singing beside me
the songs of Bu'ath (a story about the war between the two tribes of the
Ansar, i.e. Khazraj and Aus, before Islam.) The Prophet reclined on the
bed and turned his face to the other side. Abu Bakr came and scolded me
and said protestingly, "Instrument of Satan in the presence of Allah's
Apostle?" Allah's Apostle turned his face towards him and said, "Leave
them." When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I waved the two girls to go
away and they left. It was the day of 'Id when negroes used to play with
leather shields and spears. Either I requested Allah's Apostle or he
himself asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in
the affirmative. Then he let me stand behind him and my cheek was
touching his cheek and he was saying, "Carry on, O Bani Arfida (i.e.
negroes)!" When I got tired, he asked me if that was enough. I replied
in the affirmative and he told me to leave.
