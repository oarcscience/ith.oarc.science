That while he was with Allah's Apostle who was accompanied by the 
people on their way back from Hunain, the bedouins started begging 
things of Allah's Apostle so much so that they forced him to go under

that, Allah's Apostle stood up and said to them, "Return my garment to
me. If I had as many camels as these trees, I would have distributed 
them amongst you; and you will not find me a miser or a liar or a 
coward."
