I went to the Prophet and tied my she-camel at the gate. The people of
Bani Tamim came to the Prophet who said "O Bani Tamim! Accept the good
tidings." They said twice, 'You have given us the good tidings, now 
give us something" Then some Yemenites came to him and he said, 
"Accept the good tidings, O people of Yemem, for Bani Tamim refused 
them." They said, "We accept it, O Allah's Apostle! We have come to 
ask you about this matter (i.e. the start of creations)." He said,

Throne). His throne was over the water, and He wrote everything in the
Book (in the Heaven) and created the Heavens and the Earth." Then a

I wished I had left that she-camel (but not that gathering).

Paradise will enter their places and the people of Hell will enter 
their places. Some remembered what he had said, and some forgot it.
