### Hadith 4:338

*Narrated Anas:*

That when Abu Bakr became the Caliph, he sent him to Bahrain and wrote
this letter for him, and stamped it with the Ring of the Prophet. Three
lines were engraved on the Ring, (the word) 'Muhammad' was in a line,
'Apostle' was in another line, and 'Allah' in a third.
