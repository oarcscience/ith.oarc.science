Some people claim that the order in the above Verse is cancelled, by 
Allah, it is not cancelled, but the people have stopped acting on it. 
There are two kinds of guardians (who are in charge of the 
inheritance): One is that who inherits; such a person should give (of 
what he inherits to the relatives, the orphans and the needy, etc.), 
the other is that who does not inherit (e.g. the guardian of the 
orphans): such a person should speak kindly and say (to those who are 
present at the time of distribution), "I can not give it to you (as 
the wealth belongs to the orphans)."
