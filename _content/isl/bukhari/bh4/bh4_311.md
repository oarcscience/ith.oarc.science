### Hadith 4:307

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet got up amongst us and mentioned Al Ghulul, emphasized its
magnitude and declared that it was a great sin saying, "Don't commit
Ghulul for I should not like to see anyone amongst you on the Day of
Ressurection, carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating, or
carrying over his neck a horse that will be neighing. Such a man will be
saying: 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah for me,' and I will
reply, 'I can't help you, for I have conveyed Allah's Message to you Nor
should I like to see a man carrying over his neck, a camel that will be
grunting. Such a man will say, 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah
for me, and I will say, 'I can't help you for I have conveyed Allah's
Message to you,' or one carrying over his neck gold and silver and
saying, 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah for me,' and I will
say, 'I can't help you for I have conveyed Allah's Message to you,' or
one carrying clothes that will be fluttering, and the man will say, 'O
Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah for me.' And I will say, 'I can't
help you, for I have conveyed Allah's Message to you."
