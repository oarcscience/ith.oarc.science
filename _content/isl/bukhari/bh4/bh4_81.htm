<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:80</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
I went to Allah's Apostle while he was at Khaibar after it had fallen 
in the Muslims' hands. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Give me a share 
(from the land of Khaibar)."
<P>
One of the sons of Sa'id bin Al-'As said, "O Allah's Apostle! Do not 
give him a share." I said, "This is the murderer of Ibn Qauqal." The 
son of Said bin Al-As said, "Strange! A Wabr (i.e. guinea pig) who has
come down to us from the mountain of Qaduim (i.e. grazing place of 
sheep) blames me for killing a Muslim who was given superiority by 
Allah because of me, and Allah did not disgrace me at his hands (i.e. 
was not killed as an infidel)." (The sub-narrator said "I do not know 
whether the Prophet gave him a share or not.")
