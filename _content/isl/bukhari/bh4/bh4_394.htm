<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:390</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle once said to me, "If the revenue of Bahrain came, I 
would give you this much and this much." When Allah's Apostle had 
died, the revenue of Bahrain came, and Abu Bakr announced, " Let 
whoever was promised something by Allah's Apostle come to me." So, I 
went to Abu Bakr and said, "Allah's Apostle said to me, 'If the 
revenue of Bahrain came, I would give you this much and this. much." 
On that Abu Bakr said to me, "Scoop (money) with both your hands." I 
scooped money with both my hands and Abu Bakr asked me to count it. I 
counted it and it was five-hundred (gold pieces). The total amount he 
gave me was one thousand and five hundred (gold pieces.)
<P>
said, "Spread it in the Mosque." It was the biggest amount that had 
ever been brought to Allah's Apostle . In the meantime Al-'Abbas came 
to him and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Give me, for I gave the ransom of
myself and Aqil." The Prophet said (to him), "Take." He scooped money 
with both hands and poured it in his garment and tried to lift it, but
he could not and appealed to the Prophet, "Will you order someone to 
help me in lifting it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al-'Abbas said, 
"Then will you yourself help me carry it?" The Prophet said, "No." 
Then Al 'Abbas threw away some of the money, but even then he was not 
able to lift it, and so he gain requested the Prophet "Will you order 
someone to help me carry it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al-'Abbas 
said, "Then will you yourself yelp me carry it?" The Prophet said, 
'No." So, Al-'Abbas threw away some more money and lifted it on his 
shoulder and went away. The Prophet kept on looking at him with 
astonishment at his greediness till he went out of our sight. Allah's 
Apostle did not get up from there till not a single Dirham remained 
from that money.
