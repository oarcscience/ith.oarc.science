<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:533</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Cover your utensils and tie your water skins, and 
close your doors and keep your children close to you at night, as the 
Jinns spread out at such time and snatch things away. When you go to 
bed, put out your lights, for the mischief-doer (i.e. the rat) may 
drag away the wick of the candle and burn the dwellers of the house." 
Ata said, "The devils." (instead of the Jinns).
