That he was asked about the wound of the Prophet on the day (of the 
battle) of Uhud. He said, "The face of the Prophet as wounded and one 
of his front teeth as broken and the helmet over his head was smashed.

bleeding was increasing continuously, she burnt a mat (of date-palm 
leaves) till it turned into ashes which she put over the wound and 
thus the bleeding ceased."
