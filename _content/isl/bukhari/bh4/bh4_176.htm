<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:175</H3><P><I>Narrated Khalid bin Madan:</I></P>
That 'Umair bin Al-Aswad Al-Anasi told him that he went to 'Ubada bin 
As-Samit while he was staying in his house at the sea-shore of Hims 
with (his wife) Um Haram. 'Umair said. Um Haram informed us that she 
heard the Prophet saying, "Paradise is granted to the first batch of 
my followers who will undertake a naval expedition." Um Haram added, I
said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Will I be amongst them?' He replied, 'You 
are amongst them.' The Prophet then said, 'The first army amongst' my 
followers who will invade Caesar's City will be forgiven their sins.' 
I asked, 'Will I be one of them, O Allah's Apostle?' He replied in the
negative."
