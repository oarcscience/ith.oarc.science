### Hadith 4:623

*Narrated Abu Musa:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Many amongst men reached (the level of)
perfection but none amongst the women reached this level except Asia,
Pharaoh's wife, and Mary, the daughter of 'Imran. And no doubt, the
superiority of 'Aisha to other women is like the superiority of Tharid
(i.e. a meat and bread dish) to other meals."
