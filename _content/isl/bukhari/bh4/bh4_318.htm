<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:314</H3><P><I>Narrated Sad bin 'Ubaida:</I></P>
Abu Abdur-Rahman who was one of the supporters of Uthman said to Abu 
Talha who was one of the supporters of Ali, "I perfectly know what 
encouraged your leader (i.e. 'Ali) to shed blood. I heard him saying: 
Once the Prophet sent me and Az-Zubair saying, 'Proceed to 
such-and-such Ar-Roudah (place) where you will find a lady whom Hatib 
has given a letter. So when we arrived at Ar-Roudah, we requested the 
lady to hand over the letter to us. She said, 'Hatib has not given me 
any letter.' We said to her. 'Take out the letter or else we will 
strip off your clothes.' So she took it out of her braid. So the 
Prophet sent for Hatib, (who came) and said, 'Don't hurry in judging 
me, for, by Allah, I have not become a disbeliever, and my love to 
Islam is increasing. (The reason for writing this letter was) that 
there is none of your companions but has relatives in Mecca who look 
after their families and property, while I have nobody there, so I 
wanted to do them some favor (so that they might look after my family 
and property).' The Prophet believed him. 'Umar said, 'Allow me to 
chop off his (i.e. Hatib's) neck as he has done hypocrisy.' The 
Prophet said, (to 'Umar), 'Who knows, perhaps Allah has looked at the 
warriors of Badr and said (to them), 'Do whatever you like, for I have
forgiven you.' " 'Abdur-Rahman added, "So this is what encouraged him 
(i.e. Ali)."
