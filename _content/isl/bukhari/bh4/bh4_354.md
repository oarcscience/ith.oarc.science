### Hadith 4:350

*Narrated Jabir bin Samura:*

Allah's Apostle said, "When Khosrau is ruined, there will be no Khosrau
after him; and when Caesar is ruined, their will be no Caesar after him.
By Him in Whose Hands my life is, you will spend their treasures in
Allah's Cause."

made legal for me. ...](bh4_355)
