### Hadith 4:397

*Narrated Ibrahim At-Tamimi's father:*

'Ali delivered a sermon saying, "We have no book to read except the Book
of Allah and what is written in this paper which contains verdicts
regarding (retaliation for) wounds, the ages of the camels (given as
Zakat or as blood money) and the fact that Medina is a sanctuary in
between Air mountain to so-and-so (mountain). So, whoever innovates in
it an heresy or commits a sin or gives shelter in it, to such an
innovator will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels and all the people,
and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be
accepted. And whoever (freed slave) takes as his master (i.e. befriends)
other than his real masters will incur the same (Curse). And the asylum
granted by any Muslim is to be secured by all the other Muslims, and
whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect will incur the same (Curse)."
