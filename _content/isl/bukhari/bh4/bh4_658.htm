<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:655</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "If a person teaches his slave girl good manners
properly, educates her properly, and then manumits and marries her, he
will get a double reward. And if a man believes in Jesus and then 
believes in me, he will get a double reward. And if a slave fears his 
Lord (i.e. Allah) and obeys his masters, he too will get a double 
reward."
