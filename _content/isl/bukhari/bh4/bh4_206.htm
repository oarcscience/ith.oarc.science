<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:205</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>

Hudaibiya), not even two men amongst us agreed unanimously as to which

that was out of Allah's Mercy. (The sub narrator asked Naf'i, "For 
what did the Prophet take their pledge of allegiance, was it for 
death?" Naf'i replied "No, but he took their pledge of allegiance for 
patience.")
