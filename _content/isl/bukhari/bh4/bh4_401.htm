<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:397</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibrahim At-Tamimi's father:</I></P>
'Ali delivered a sermon saying, "We have no book to read except the 
Book of Allah and what is written in this paper which contains 
verdicts regarding (retaliation for) wounds, the ages of the camels 
(given as Zakat or as blood money) and the fact that Medina is a 
sanctuary in between Air mountain to so-and-so (mountain). So, whoever
innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin or gives shelter in it, to 
such an innovator will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels and all 
the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of 
worship will be accepted. And whoever (freed slave) takes as his 
master (i.e. befriends) other than his real masters will incur the 
same (Curse). And the asylum granted by any Muslim is to be secured by
all the other Muslims, and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect 
will incur the same (Curse)."
