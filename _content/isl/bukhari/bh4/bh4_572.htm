The Prophet said, "On the Day of Resurrection Abraham will meet his 
father Azar whose face will be dark and covered with dust.(The Prophet
Abraham will say to him): 'Didn't I tell you not to disobey me?' His 
father will reply: 'Today I will not disobey you.' 'Abraham will say: 
'O Lord! You promised me not to disgrace me on the Day of 
Resurrection; and what will be more disgraceful to me than cursing and
dishonoring my father?' Then Allah will say (to him):' 'I have 
forbidden Paradise for the disbelievers." Then he will be addressed, 
'O Abraham! Look! What is underneath your feet?' He will look and 
there he will see a Dhabh (an animal,) blood-stained, which will be 
caught by the legs and thrown in the (Hell) Fire."
