Allah's Apostle said, "Once Solomon, son of David said, '(By Allah)

not say, 'Allah willing.' Therefore only one of those women conceived 
and gave birth to a half-man. By Him in Whose Hands Muhammad's life 
is, if he had said, "Allah willing', (he would have begotten sons) all
of whom would have been knights striving in Allah's Cause."
