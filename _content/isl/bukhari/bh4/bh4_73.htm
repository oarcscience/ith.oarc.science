Allah's Apostle said, "Once Solomon, son of David said, '(By Allah) 
Tonight I will have sexual intercourse with one hundred (or 
ninety-nine) women each of whom will give birth to a knight who will 
fight in Allah's Cause.' On that a (i.e. if Allah wills) but he did 
not say, 'Allah willing.' Therefore only one of those women conceived 
and gave birth to a half-man. By Him in Whose Hands Muhammad's life 
is, if he had said, "Allah willing', (he would have begotten sons) all
of whom would have been knights striving in Allah's Cause."
