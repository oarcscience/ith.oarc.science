*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle was asked, "Who is the most honorable amongst the
people?" He replied, "The most Allah fearing." The people said, "We do
not want to ask you about this." He said, "The most honorable person is
Joseph, Allah's Prophet, the son of Allah's Prophet, the son of Allah's
Prophet, the son of Allah's Khalil" The people said, 'We do not want to
ask you about this." He said," Then you want to ask me about the origins
of the Arabs? People are of various origins. The best in the pre-lslamic
period are the best in Islam, provided they comprehend (the religious
