<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:137</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Let the slave of Dinar and Dirham of Quantify and 
Khamisa (i.e. money and luxurious clothes) perish for he is pleased if
these things are given to him, and if not, he is displeased!"
<P>
Dirham, of Quantify and Khamisa perish as he is pleased if these 
things are given to him, and if not, he is displeased. Let such a 
person perish and relapse, and if he is pierced with a thorn, let him 
not find anyone to take it out for him. Paradise is for him who holds 
the reins of his horse to strive in Allah's Cause, with his hair 
unkempt and feet covered with dust: if he is appointed in the 
vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied with his post of guarding, and if 
he is appointed in the rearward, he accepts his post with 
satisfaction; (he is so simple and unambiguous that) if he asks for 
permission he is not permitted, and if he intercedes, his intercession
is not accepted."
