<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:619</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Angel of Death was sent to Moses when he came to Moses, Moses 
slapped him on the eye. The angel returned to his Lord and said, "You 
have sent me to a Slave who does not want to die." Allah said, "Return
to him and tell him to put his hand on the back of an ox and for every
hair that will come under it, he will be granted one year of life." 
Moses said, "O Lord! What will happen after that?" Allah replied, 
"Then death." Moses said, "Let it come now." Moses then requested 
Allah to let him die close to the Sacred Land so much so that he would
be at a distance of a stone's throw from it." Abu Huraira added, 
"Allah's Apostle said, 'If I were there, I would show you his grave 
below the red  sand hill on the side of the road."
