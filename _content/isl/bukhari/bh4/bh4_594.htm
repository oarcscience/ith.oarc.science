<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:591</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "We are more liable to be in doubt than Abraham 
when he said, 'My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead." . He 
(i.e. Allah) slid: 'Don't you believe then?' He (i.e. Abraham) said: 
"Yes, but (I ask) in order to be stronger in Faith." (2.260) And may 
Allah send His Mercy on Lot! He wished to have a powerful support. If 
I were to stay in prison for such a long time as Joseph did I would 
have accepted the offer (of freedom without insisting on having my 
guiltless less declared)."
