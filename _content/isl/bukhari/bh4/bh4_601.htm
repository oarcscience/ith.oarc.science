<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:598</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
That the Prophet said (to her). "Order Abu Bakr to lead the people in 
prayer." She replied," Abu Bakr is a soft-hearted person and when he 
stands at your place, he will weep (so he will not be able to lead the
prayer)." The Prophet repeated the same order and she gave the same 
reply. The narrator, Shuba said that the Prophet said on the third or 
fourth time. "You are (like) the female companions of Joseph. Order 
Abu Bakr to lead the prayer. "
