### Hadith 4:217

*Narrated Yali:*

I participated in the Ghazwa of Tabuk along with Allah's Apostle and I
gave a young camel to be ridden in Jihad and that was, to me, one of my
best deeds. Then I employed a laborer who quarrelled with another
person. One of them bit the hand of the other and the latter drew his
hand from the mouth of the former pulling out his front tooth. Then the
former instituted a suit against the latter before the Prophet who
rejected that suit saying, "Do you expect him to put out his hand for
you to snap as a male camel snaps (vegetation)?"
