<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:291</H3><P><I>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</I></P>
I asked the Prophet during his Hajj, "O Allah's Apostle! Where will 
you stay tomorrow?" He said, "Has Aqil left for us any house?" He then
added, "Tomorrow we will stay at Khaif Bani Kinana, i.e. Al-Muhassab, 
where (the Pagans of) Quraish took an oath of Kufr (i.e. to be loyal 
to heathenism) in that Bani Kinana got allied with Quraish against 
Bani Hashim on the terms that they would not deal with the members of 
the is tribe or give them shelter." (Az-Zuhri said, "Khaif means 
valley.") (See Hadith No. 659, Vol. 2)
