### Hadith 4:75

*Narrated Muhammad bin Jubair:*

Jubair bin Mut'im told me that while he was in the company of Allah's
Apostle with the people returning from Hunain, some people (bedouins)
caught hold of the Prophet and started begging of him so much so that he
had to stand under a (kind of thorny tree (i.e. Samurah) and his cloak
was snatched away. The Prophet stopped and said, "Give me my cloak. If I
had as many camels as these thorny trees, I would have distributed them
amongst you and you will not find me a miser or a liar or a coward."
