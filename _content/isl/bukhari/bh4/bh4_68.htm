<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:69</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
For thirty days Allah's Apostle invoked Allah to curse those who had 
killed the companions of Bir-Mauna; he invoked evil upon the tribes of
Ral, Dhakwan, and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle. There 
was reveled about those who were killed at Bir-Mauna a Quranic Verse 
we used to recite, but it was cancelled later on. The Verse was:
<P>
"Inform our people that we have met our Lord. He is pleased with us 
and He has made us pleased"
