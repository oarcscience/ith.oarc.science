Whenever the Prophet intended to proceed on a journey, he used to draw
lots amongst his wives and would take the one upon whom the lot fell. 
Once, before setting out for Jihad, he drew lots amongst us and the 
lot came to me; so I went with the Prophet; and that happened after 
the revelation of the Verse Hijab (i.e. veiling).
