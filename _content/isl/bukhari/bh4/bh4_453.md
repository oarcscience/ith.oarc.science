### Hadith 4:449

*Narrated Busr bin Said:*

That Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani narrated to him something in the presence
of Said bin 'Ubaidullah Al-Khaulani who was brought up in the house of
Maimuna the wife of the Prophet. Zaid narrated to them that Abu Talha
said that the Prophet said, "The Angels (of Mercy) do not enter a house
wherein there is a picture." Busr said, "Later on Zaid bin Khalid fell
ill and we called on him. To our surprise we saw a curtain decorated
with pictures in his house. I said to Ubaidullah Al-Khaulani, "Didn't he
(i.e. Zaid) tell us about the (prohibition of) pictures?" He said, "But
he excepted the embroidery on garments. Didn't you hear him?" I said,
"No." He said, "Yes, he did."
