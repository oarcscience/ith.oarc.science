<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:524</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "A group of Israelites were lost. Nobody knows what 
they did. But I do not see them except that they were cursed and 
changed into rats, for if you put the milk of a she-camel in front of 
a rat, it will not drink it, but if the milk of a sheep is put in 
front of it, it will drink it." I told this to Ka'b who asked me, "Did
you hear it from the Prophet ?" I said, "Yes." Ka'b asked me the same 
question several times.; I said to Ka'b. "Do I read the Torah? (i.e. I
tell you this from the Prophet.)"
