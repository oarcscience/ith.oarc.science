Some silken cloaks with golden buttons were presented to the Prophet. 
He distributed them amongst his companions and kept one for Makhrama, 
bin Naufal. Later on Makhrama came along with his son Al-Miswar bin 
Makhrama, and stood up at the gate and said (to his son). "Call him 
(i.e. the Prophet) to me." The Prophet heard his voice, took a silken 
cloak and brought it to him, placing those golden buttons in front of 
him saying, "O Abu-al-Miswar! I have kept this aside for you! O Abu-al
Miswar! I have kept this aside for you!" Makhrama was a bad-tempered 
man.
