<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:621</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Adam and Moses argued with each other. Moses 
said to Adam. 'You are Adam whose mistake expelled you from Paradise.'
Adam said to him, 'You are Moses whom Allah selected as His Messenger 
and as the one to whom He spoke directly; yet you blame me for a thing
which had already been written in my fate before my creation?"' 
Allah's Apostle said twice, "So, Adam overpowered Moses."
