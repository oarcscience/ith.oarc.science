The Prophet arranged for a horse race amongst the horses that had been
made lean to take place between Al-Hafya'' and Thaniyat Al-Wada' (i.e.
names of two places) and the horses which had not been mad.? lean from
Ath-Thaniyat to the mosque of Bani Zuraiq. I was also amongst those 
who took part in that horse race. Sufyan, a sub-narrator, said, "The 
distance between Al-Hafya and Thaniya Al-Wada' is five or six miles; 
and between Thaniya and the mosque of Bani Zuraiq is one mile."
