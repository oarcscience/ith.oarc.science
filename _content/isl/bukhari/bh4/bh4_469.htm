<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:465</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
While we were in the company of the Prophet, he said, "While I was 
asleep, I saw myself in Paradise and there I beheld a woman making 
ablution beside a palace, I asked, To whom does this palace belong? 
'They said, To 'Umar bin Al-Khattab.' Then I remembered 'Umar's Ghaira
(concerning women), and so I quickly went away from that palace." 
(When 'Umar heard this from the Prophet), he wept and said, "Do you 
think it is likely that I feel Ghaira because of you, O Allah's 
Apostle?"
