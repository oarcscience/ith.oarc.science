<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:408</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Bara:</I></P>
When the Prophet intended to perform the 'Umra he sent a person to the
people of Mecca asking their permission to enter Mecca. They 
stipulated that he would not stay for more than three days and would 
not enter it except with sheathed arms and would not preach (Islam) to
any of them. So Ali bin Abi-Talib started writing the treaty between 
them. He wrote, "This is what Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has agreed 
to." The (Meccans) said, "If we knew that you (Muhammad) are the 
Apostle of Allah, then we would not have prevented you and would have 
followed you. But write, 'This is what Muhammad bin 'Abdullah has 
agreed to..' " On that Allah's Apostle said, "By Allah, I am Muhammad 
bin 'Abdullah, and, by Allah, I am Apostle of 'Allah." Allah's Apostle
used not to write; so he asked 'Ali to erase the expression of Apostle
of Allah. On that 'Ali said, "By Allah I will never erase it." Allah's
Apostle said (to 'Ali), "Let me see the paper." When 'Ali showed him 
the paper, the Prophet erased the expression with his own hand. When 
Allah's Apostle had entered Mecca and three days had elapsed, the 
Meccans came to 'Ali and said, "Let your friend (i.e. the Prophet) 
quit Mecca." Ali informed Allah's Apostle about it and Allah's Apostle
said, "Yes," and then he departed.
