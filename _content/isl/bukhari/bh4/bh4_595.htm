<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:592</H3><P><I>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa:</I></P>
The Prophet passed by some persons of the tribe of Aslam practicing 
archery (i.e. the throwing of arrows) Allah's Apostle said, "O 
offspring of Ishmael! Practice archery (i.e. arrow throwing) as your 
father was a great archer (i.e. arrow-thrower). I am with (on the side
of) the son of so-and-so-." Hearing that, one of the two teams stopped
throwing. Allah's Apostle asked them, ' Why are you not throwing?" 
They replied, "O Allah's Apostle! How shall we throw when you are with
the opposite team?" He said, "Throw, for I am with you all."
