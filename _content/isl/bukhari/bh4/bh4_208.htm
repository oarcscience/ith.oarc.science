<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:207</H3><P><I>Narrated Yazid bin Ubaid:</I></P>
Salama said, "I gave the Pledge of allegiance (Al-Ridwan) to Allah's 
Apostle and then I moved to the shade of a tree. When the number of 
people around the Prophet diminished, he said, 'O Ibn Al-Akwa ! Will 
you not give to me the pledge of Allegiance?' I replied, 'O Allah's 
Apostle! I have already given to you the pledge of Allegiance.' He 
said, 'Do it again.' So I gave the pledge of allegiance for the second
time." I asked 'O Abu Muslim! For what did you give he pledge of 
Allegiance on that day?" He replied, "We gave the pledge of Allegiance
for death."
