### Hadith 4:29

*Narrated Anas:*

When Allah's Apostle came to Medina; he did not have any servant. Abu
Talha (Anas' step-father) took me to Allah's Apostle and said, "O
Allah's Apostle! Anas is a wise boy, so let him serve you." So, I served
him at home and on journeys. If I did anything, he never asked me why I
did it, and if I refrained from doing anything, he never asked me why I
refrained from doing it.
