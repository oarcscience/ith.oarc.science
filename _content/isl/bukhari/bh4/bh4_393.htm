<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:389</H3><P><I>Narrated Yahya bin Said:</I></P>
Once the Prophet called the Ansar in order to grant them part of the 
land of Bahrain. On that they said, "No! By Allah, we will not accept 
it unless you grant a similar thing to our Quarries brothers as well."
He said, "That will be their's if Allah wishes." But when the Ansar 
persisted in their request, he said, "After me you will see others 
given preference over you in this respect (in which case) you should 
be patient till you meet me at the Tank (of Al-Kauthar)."
