<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:44</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "Instruct me as to such a deed
as equals Jihad (in reward)." He replied, "I do not find such a deed."
Then he added, "Can you, while the Muslim fighter is in the 
battle-field, enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and 
fast and never break your fast?" The man said, "But who can do that?" 
Abu- Huraira  added, "The Mujahid (i.e. Muslim fighter) is rewarded 
even for the footsteps of his horse while it wanders bout (for 
grazing) tied in a long rope."
