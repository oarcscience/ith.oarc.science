I heard 'Umar bin Al-Khattab saying, "I gave a horse to be ridden in 
Allah's Cause and the person who got it intended to sell it or 
neglected it. So, I wanted to buy it as I thought he would sell it 
cheap. I consulted the Prophet who said, "Do not buy it even if for 
one Dirham, because he who takes back his gift is like a dog 
swallowing its vomit."
