When Allah revealed the Verse: "Warn your nearest kinsmen," Allah's 
Apostle got up and said, "O people of Quraish (or said similar words)!
Buy (i.e. save) yourselves (from the Hellfire) as I cannot save you 
from Allah's Punishment; O Bani Abd Manaf! I cannot save you from 
Allah's Punishment, O Safiya, the Aunt of Allah's Apostle! I cannot 
save you from Allah's Punishment; O Fatima bint Muhammad! Ask me 
anything from my wealth, but I cannot save you from Allah's 
Punishment."
