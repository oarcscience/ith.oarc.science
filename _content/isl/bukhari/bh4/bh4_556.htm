<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:553</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Umar:</I></P>
Once Allah's Apostle stood amongst the people, glorified and praised 
Allah as He deserved and then mentioned the Dajjal saying, "l warn you
against him (i.e. the Dajjal) and there was no prophet but warned his 
nation against him. No doubt, Noah warned his nation against him but I
tell you about him something of which no prophet told his nation 
before me. You should know that he is one-eyed, and Allah is not 
one-eyed."
