<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:201</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
We set out in the company of Allah's Apostle five days before the end 
of Dhul Qa'da intending to perform Hajj only. When we approached Mecca
Allah's Apostle ordered those who did not have the Hadi (i.e. an 
animal for sacrifice) with them, to perform the Tawaf around the 
Ka'ba, and between Safa and Marwa and then finish their Ihram. Beef 
was brought to us on the day of (i.e. the days of slaughtering) and I 
asked, "What is this?" Somebody said, Allah's Apostle has slaughtered 
(a cow) on behalf of his wives."
