### Hadith 4:57

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet sent seventy men from the tribe of Bani Salim to the tribe
of Bani Amir. When they reached there, my maternal uncle said to them,
"I will go ahead of you, and if they allow me to convey the message of
Allah's Apostle (it will be all right); otherwise you will remain close
to me." So he went ahead of them and the pagans granted him security But
while he was reporting the message of the Prophet , they beckoned to one
of their men who stabbed him to death. My maternal uncle said, "Allah is
Greater! By the Lord of the Kaba, I am successful." After that they
attached the rest of the party and killed them all except a lame man who
went up to the top of the mountain. (Hammam, a sub-narrator said, "I
think another man was saved along with him)." Gabriel informed the
Prophet that they (i.e the martyrs) met their Lord, and He was pleased
with them and made them pleased. We used to recite, "Inform our people
that we have met our Lord, He is pleased with us and He has made us
pleased " Later on this Quranic Verse was cancelled. The Prophet invoked
Allah for forty days to curse the murderers from the tribe of Ral,
Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Bam Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and his Apostle
