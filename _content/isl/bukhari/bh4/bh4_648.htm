<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:645</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "None spoke in cradle but three: (The first was) 
Jesus, (the second was), there a man from Bani Israel called Juraij. 
While he was offering his prayers, his mother came and called him. He 
said (to himself), 'Shall I answer her or keep on praying?" (He went 
on praying) and did not answer her, his mother said, "O Allah! Do not 
let him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes." So while he was in
his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him, but he refused. 
So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit 
illegal sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a
child and claimed that it belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, 
came to him and dismantled his hermitage and expelled him out of it 
and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer, and 
then came to the child and said, 'O child! Who is your father?' The 
child replied, 'The shepherd.' (After hearing this) the people said, 
'We shall rebuild your hermitage of gold,' but he said, 'No, of 
nothing but mud.'(The third was the hero of the following story) A 
lady from Bani Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a 
handsome rider passed by her. She said, 'O Allah ! Make my child like 
him.' On that the child left her breast, and facing the rider said, 'O
Allah! Do not make me like him.' The child then started to suck her 
breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, "As if I were now looking at 
the Prophet sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.") After a 
while the people passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the 
child's mother) said, 'O Allah! Do not make my child like this (slave 
girl)!, On that the child left her breast and said, 'O Allah! Make me 
like her.' When she asked why, the child replied, 'The rider is one of
the tyrants while this slave girl is falsely accused of theft and 
illegal sexual intercourse."
