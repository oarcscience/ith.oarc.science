<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:647</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "I met Moses on the night of my Ascension to 
heaven." The Prophet then described him saying, as I think, "He was a 
tall person with lank hair as if he belonged to the people of the 
tribe of Shanu's.' The Prophet further said, "I met Jesus." The 
Prophet described him saying, "He was one of moderate height and was 
red-faced as if he had just come out of a bathroom. I saw Abraham whom
I resembled more than any of his children did." The Prophet further 
said, "(That night) I was given two cups; one full of milk and the 
other full of wine. I was asked to take either of them which I liked, 
and I took the milk and drank it. On that it was said to me, 'You have
taken the right path (religion). If you had taken the wine, your 
(Muslim) nation would have gone astray."
