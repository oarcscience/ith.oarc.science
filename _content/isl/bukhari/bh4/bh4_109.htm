<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:108</H3><P><I>Narrated Mu'adh:</I></P>
I was a companion rider of the Prophet on a donkey called 'Ufair. The 
Prophet asked, "O Mu'adh! Do you know what Allah's right on His slaves
is, and what the right of His slaves on Him is?" I replied, "Allah and
His Apostle know better." He said, "Allah's right on His slaves is 
that they should worship Him (Alone) and should not worship any 
besides Him. And slave's right on Allah is that He should not punish 
him who worships none besides Him." I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Should
I not inform the people of this good news?" He said, "Do not inform 
them of it, lest they should depend on it (absolutely)."
