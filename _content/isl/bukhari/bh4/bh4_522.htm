<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:518</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Umar:</I></P>
That he heard the Prophet delivering a sermon on the pulpit saying, 
"Kill snakes and kill Dhu-at-Tufyatain (i.e. a snake with two white 
lines on its back) and ALBATROSS (i.e. a snake with short or mutilated
tail) for they destroy the sight of one's eyes and bring about 
abortion." ('Abdullah bin 'Umar further added): Once while I was 
chasing a snake in order, to kill it, Abu Lubaba called me saying: 
"Don't kill it," I said. "Allah's Apostle ordered us to kill snakes." 
He said, "But later on he prohibited the killing of snakes living in 
the houses." (Az-Zubri said. "Such snakes are called Al-Awamir.")
