### Hadith 4:53

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

The Prophet said, "Nobody who dies and finds good from Allah (in the
Hereafter) would wish to come back to this world even if he were given
the whole world and whatever is in it, except the martyr who, on seeing
the superiority of martyrdom, would like to come back to the world and
get killed again (in Allah's Cause)."

Allah's Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all the
world and whatever is in it. A place in Paradise as small as the bow or
lash of one of you is better than all the world and whatever is in it.
And if a houri from Paradise appeared to the people of the earth, she
would fill the space between Heaven and the Earth with light and
pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world and whatever
is in it."
