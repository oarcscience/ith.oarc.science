Allah's Apostle said, "If one says one-hundred times in one day: "None
has the right to be worshipped but Allah, the Alone Who has no 
partners, to Him belongs Dominion and to Him belong all the Praises, 
and He has power over all things (i.e. Omnipotent)", one will get the 
reward of manumitting ten slaves, and one-hundred good deeds will be 
written in his account, and one-hundred bad deeds will be wiped off or
erased from his account, and on that day he will be protected from the
morning till evening from Satan, and nobody will be superior to him 
except one who has done more than that which he has done."
