### Hadith 4:69

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

For thirty days Allah's Apostle invoked Allah to curse those who had
killed the companions of Bir-Mauna; he invoked evil upon the tribes of
Ral, Dhakwan, and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle. There was
reveled about those who were killed at Bir-Mauna a Quranic Verse we used
to recite, but it was cancelled later on. The Verse was:

"Inform our people that we have met our Lord. He is pleased with us and
He has made us pleased"
