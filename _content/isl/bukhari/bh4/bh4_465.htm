<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:461</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
that he heard the Prophet saying, "The Divine Inspiration was delayed 
for a short period but suddenly, as I was walking. I heard a voice in 
the sky, and when I looked up towards the sky, to my surprise, I saw 
the angel who had come to me in the Hira Cave, and he was sitting on a
chair in between the sky and the earth. I was so frightened by him 
that I fell on the ground and came to my family and said (to them), 
'Cover me! (with a blanket), cover me!' Then Allah sent the 
Revelation: "O, You wrapped up (In a blanket)! (Arise and warn! And 
your Lord magnify And keep pure your garments, And desert the idols." 
(74.1-5)
