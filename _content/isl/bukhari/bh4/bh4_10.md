### Hadith 4:11

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

A man asked the Prophet, "O Allah's Apostle! What kind of charity is the
best?" He replied. "To give in charity when you are healthy and greedy
hoping to be wealthy and afraid of becoming poor. Don't delay giving in
charity till the time when you are on the death bed when you say, 'Give
so much to so-and-so and so much to so-and so,' and at that time the
property is not yours but it belongs to so-and-so (i.e. your
inheritors)."
