Once 'Umar gave a horse in charity to be used in holy fighting. It had
been given to him by Allah's Apostle . 'Umar gave it to another man to
ride. Then 'Umar was informed that the man put the horse for sale, so 
he asked Allah's Apostle whether he could buy it. Allah's Apostle 
replied, "You should not buy it, for you should not take back what you
have given in charity."
