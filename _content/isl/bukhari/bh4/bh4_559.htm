<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:556</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
We were in the company of the Prophet at a banquet and a cooked 
(mutton) forearm was set before him, and he used to like it. He ate a 
morsel of it and said, "I will be the chief of all the people on the 
Day of Resurrection. Do you know how Allah will gather all the first 
and the last (people) in one level place where an observer will be 
able to see (all) of them and they will be able to hear the announcer,
and the sun will come near to them. Some People will say: Don't you 
see, in what condition you are and the state to which you have 
reached? Why don't you look for a person who can intercede for you 
with your Lord? Some people will say: Appeal to your father, Adam.' 
They will go to him and say: 'O Adam! You are the father of all 
mankind, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the 
angels to prostrate for you, and made you live in Paradise. Will you 
not intercede for us with your Lord? Don't you see in what (miserable)
state we are, and to what condition we have reached?' On that Adam 
will reply, 'My Lord is so angry as He has never been before and will 
never be in the future; (besides), He forbade me (to eat from) the 
tree, but I disobeyed (Him), (I am worried about) myself! Myself! Go 
to somebody else; go to Noah.' They will go to Noah and say; 'O Noah! 
You are the first amongst the messengers of Allah to the people of the
earth, and Allah named you a thankful slave. Don't you see in what a 
(miserable) state we are and to what condition we have reached? Will 
you not intercede for us with your Lord? Noah will reply: 'Today my 
Lord has become so angry as he had never been before and will never be
in the future Myself! Myself! Go to the Prophet (Muhammad). The people
will come to me, and I will prostrate myself underneath Allah's 
Throne. Then I will be addressed: 'O Muhammad! Raise your head; 
intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for 
anything). for you will be given. "
