<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:270</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Who is ready to kill Ka'b bin Al-Ashraf who has 
really hurt Allah and His Apostle?" Muhammad bin Maslama said, "O 
Allah's Apostle! Do you like me to kill him?" He replied in the 
affirmative. So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to him (i.e. Ka'b) and 
said, "This person (i.e. the Prophet) has put us to task and asked us 
for charity." Ka'b replied, "By Allah, you will get tired of him." 
Muhammad said to him, "We have followed him, so we dislike to leave 
him till we see the end of his affair." Muhammad bin Maslama went on 
talking to him in this way till he got the chance to kill him.
