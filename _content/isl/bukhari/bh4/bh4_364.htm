<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:360</H3><P><I>Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakim and Miswar bin Makhrama:</I></P>
When the Hawazin delegation came to Allah's Apostle after they had 
embraced Islam and requested him to return their properties and war 
prisoners to them, Allah's Apostle said, "To me the best talk is the 
truest, so you may choose either of two things; the war prisoners or 
the wealth, for I have delayed their distribution." Allah's Apostle 
had waited for them for over ten days when he returned from Ta'if. So,
when those people came to know that Allah's Apostle was not going to 
return to them except one of the two things the said, "We choose our 
war Prisoners 'Allah's Apostle stood up amongst the Muslims, and after
glorifying Allah as He deserved, he said, "Now then, these brothers of
yours have come to us with repentance, and I see it logical that I 
should return their captives to them, so whoever of you likes to do 
that as a favor then he can do it, and whoever amongst you likes to 
stick to his share, let him give up his prisoners and we will 
compensate him from the very first Fai' (i.e. war booty received 
without fight) which Allah will give us." On that, all the people 
said. 'O Allah's Apostles We have agreed willingly to do so (return 
the captives)" Then Allah's Apostle said to them "I do not know who 
amongst you has agreed to this and who has not. You should return and 
let your leaders inform me of your agreement." The people returned and
their leaders spoke to them, and then came to Allah's Apostle and 
said, "All the people have agreed willingly to do so and have given 
the permission to return the war prisoners (without Compensation)" 
(Az-Zuhri, the sub-narrator states) This is what has been related to 
us about the captives of Hawazin.
