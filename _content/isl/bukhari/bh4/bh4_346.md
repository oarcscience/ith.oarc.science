### Hadith 4:342

*Narrated 'Ali bin Al-Husain:*

That when they reached Medina after returning from Yazid bin Mu'awaiya
after the martyrdom of Husain bin 'Ali (may Allah bestow His Mercy upon
him), Al-Miswar bin Makhrama met him and said to him, "Do you have any
need you may order me to satisfy?" 'Ali said, "No." Al-Miswar said, Will
you give me the sword of Allah's Apostle for I am afraid that people may
take it from you by force? By Allah, if you give it to me, they will
never be able to take it till I die." When Ali bin Abu Talib demanded
the hand of the daughter of Abi Jahal to be his wife besides Fatima, I
heard Allah's Apostle on his pulpit delivering a sermon in this
connection before the people, and I had then attained my age of puberty.
Allah's Apostle said, "Fatima is from me, and I am afraid she will be
subjected to trials in her religion (because of jealousy)." The Prophet
then mentioned one of his son-in-law who was from the tribe of 'Abu
Shams, and he praised him as a good son-in-law, saying, "Whatever he
said was the truth, and he promised me and fulfilled his promise. I do
not make a legal thing illegal, nor do I make an illegal thing legal,
but by Allah, the daughter of Allah's Apostle and the daughter of the
enemy of Allah, (i.e. Abu Jahl) can never get together (as the wives of
one man) (See Hadith No. 76, Vo. 5).
