The Prophet said, "Nobody who enters Paradise likes to go back to the 
world even if he got everything on the earth, except a Mujahid who 
wishes to return to the world so that he may be martyred ten times 
because of the dignity he receives (from Allah)."
<P>
of our Lord that "Whoever amongst us is killed will go to Paradise." 
Umar asked the Prophet, "Is it not true that our men who are killed 
will go to Paradise and their's (i.e. those of the Pagan's) will go to
the (Hell) fire?" The Prophet said, "Yes."
