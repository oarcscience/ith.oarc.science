<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:446</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Angels keep on descending from and ascending to the
Heaven in turn, some at night and some by daytime, and all of them 
assemble together at the time of the Fajr and 'Asr prayers. Then those
who have stayed with you over-night, ascent unto Allah Who asks them, 
and He knows the answer better than they, "How have you left My 
slaves?" They reply, "We have left them praying as we found them 
praying." If anyone of you says "Amin" (during the Prayer at the end 
of the recitation of Surat-al-Faitiha), and the angels in Heaven say 
the same, and the two sayings coincide, all his past sins will be 
forgiven."
