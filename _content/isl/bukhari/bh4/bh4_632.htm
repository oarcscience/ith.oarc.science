<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:629</H3><P><I>Narrated Abdullah bin Amr:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle was informed that I have said: "By Allah, I will fast 
all the days and pray all the nights as long as I live." On that, 
Allah's Apostle asked me. "Are you the one who says: 'I will fast all 
the days and pray all the nights as long as I live?' " I said, "Yes, I
have said it." He said, "You cannot do that. So fast (sometimes) and 
do not fast (sometimes). Pray and sleep. Fast for three days a month, 
for the reward of a good deed is multiplied by ten time, and so the 
fasting of three days a month equals the fasting of a year." I said, 
"O Allah's Apostle! I can do (fast) more than this." He said, "Fast on
every third day. I said: I can do (fast) more than that, He said: 
"Fast on alternate days and this was the fasting of David which is the
most moderate sort of fasting." I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I can do 
(fast) more than that." He said, "There is nothing better than that."
