The freed slave of 'Umar bin 'Ubaidullah who was 'Umar's clerk: 
'Abdullah bin Abi Aufa wrote him (i.e. 'Umar) a letter that contained 
the following:--
<P>
"Once Allah's Apostle (during a holy battle), waited till the sun had 
declined and then he got up among the people and said, "O people! Do 
not wish to face the enemy (in a battle) and ask Allah to save you 
(from calamities) but if you should face the enemy, then be patient 
and let it be known to you that Paradise is under the shades of 
swords." He then said,, "O Allah! The Revealer of the (Holy) Book, the
Mover of the clouds, and Defeater of Al-Ahzab (i.e. the clans of 
infidels), defeat them infidels and bestow victory upon us."
