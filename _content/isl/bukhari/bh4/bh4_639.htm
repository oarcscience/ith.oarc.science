I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Which mosque was built first?" He replied,
"Al-Masjid-ul-Haram." I asked, "Which (was built) next?" He replied, 
"Al-Masjid-ul-Aqs-a (i.e. Jerusalem)." I asked, "What was the period 
in between them?" He replied, "Forty (years)." He then added, 
"Wherever the time for the prayer comes upon you, perform the prayer, 
for all the earth is a place of worshipping for you."
