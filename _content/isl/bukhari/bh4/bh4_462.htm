I asked Aisha "What about His Statement:-- "Then he (Gabriel) 
approached And came closer, And was at a distance Of but two 
bow-lengths Or (even) nearer?" (53.8-9) She replied, "It was Gabriel 
who used to come to the Prophet in the figure of a man, but on that 
occasion, he came in his actual and real figure and (he was so huge) 
that he covered the whole horizon."
