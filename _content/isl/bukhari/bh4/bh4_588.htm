<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:585</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Dhar:</I></P>
I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Which mosque was first built on the 
surface of the earth?" He said, "Al-Masjid-ul-,Haram (in Mecca)." I 
said, "Which was built next?" He replied "The mosque of Al-Aqsa ( in 
Jerusalem) ." I said, "What was the period of construction between the
two?" He said, "Forty years." He added, "Wherever (you may be, and) 
the prayer time becomes due, perform the prayer there, for the best 
thing is to do so (i.e. to offer the prayers in time)."
