When the Verse:--"It is those who believe and do not confuse their 
belief with wrong ( i.e. joining others in worship with Allah" (6.83) 
was revealed, we said, "O Allah's Apostle! Who is there amongst us who
has not done wrong to himself?" He replied, "It is not as you say, for
'wrong' in the Verse and 'do not confuse their belief, with wrong 
means 'SHIRK' (i.e. joining others in worship with Allah). Haven't you
heard Luqman's saying to his son, 'O my son! Join not others in 
worship with Allah, verily joining others in worship with Allah is a 
great wrong indeed."   (31.13)
