### Hadith 4:605

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

The Prophet returned to Khadija while his heart was beating rapidly. She
took him to Waraqa bin Naufal who was a Christian convert and used to
read the Gospels in Arabic Waraqa asked (the Prophet), "What do you

sent to the Prophet) Moses. Should I live till you receive the Divine
Message, I will support you strongly."
