### Hadith 4:478

*Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:*

The Prophet said, "The people of Paradise will look at the dwellers of
the lofty mansions (i.e. a superior place in Paradise) in the same way
as one looks at a brilliant star far away in the East or in the West on
the horizon; all that is because of their superiority over one another
(in rewards)." On that the people said, "O Allah's Apostle! Are these
lofty mansions for the prophets which nobody else can reach? The Prophet
replied," No! "By Allah in whose Hands my life is, these are for the men
who believed in Allah and also believed in the Apostles."
