<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:370</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Qatada:</I></P>
We set out in the company of Allah's Apostle on the day (of the 
battle) of Hunain. When we faced the enemy, the Muslims retreated and 
I saw a pagan throwing himself over a Muslim. I turned around and came
upon him from behind and hit him on the shoulder with the sword He 
(i.e. the pagan) came towards me and seized me so violently that I 
felt as if it were death itself, but death overtook him and he 
released me. I followed 'Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), "What is
wrong with the people (fleeing)?" He replied, "This is the Will of 
Allah," After the people returned, the Prophet sat and said, "Anyone 
who has killed an enemy and has a proof of that, will posses his 
spoils." I got up and said, "Who will be a witness for me?" and then 
sat down. The Prophet again said, "Anyone who has killed an enemy and 
has proof of that, will possess his spoils." I (again) got up and 
said, "Who will be a witness for me?" and sat down. Then the Prophet 
said the same for the third time. I again got up, and Allah's Apostle 
said, "O Abu Qatada! What is your story?" Then I narrated the whole 
story to him. A man (got up and) said, "O Allah's Apostle! He is 
speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man are with me. So 
please compensate him on my behalf." On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 
"No, by Allah, he (i.e. Allah's Apostle ) will not agree to give you 
the spoils gained by one of Allah's Lions who fights on the behalf of 
Allah and His Apostle." The Prophet said, "Abu Bakr has spoken the 
truth." So, Allah's Apostle gave the spoils to me. I sold that armor 
(i.e. the spoils) and with its price I bought a garden at Bani Salima,
and this was my first property which I gained after my conversion to 
Islam.
