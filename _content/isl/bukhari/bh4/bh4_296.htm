<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:292</H3><P><I>Narrated Aslam:</I></P>
Umar bin Al-Khattab appointed a freed slave of his, called Hunai, 
manager of the Hima (i.e. a pasture devoted for grazing the animals of
the Zakat or other specified animals). He said to him, "O Hunai! Don't
oppress the Muslims and ward off their curse (invocations against you)
for the invocation of the oppressed is responded to (by Allah); and 
allow the shepherd having a few camels and those having a few sheep 
(to graze their animals), and take care not to allow the livestock of 
'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf and the livestock of ('Uthman) bin 'Affan, for 
if their livestock should perish, then they have their farms and 
gardens, while those who own a few camels and those who own a few 
sheep, if their livestock should perish, would bring their dependents 
to me and appeal for help saying, 'O chief of the believers! O chief 
of the believers!' Would I then neglect them? (No, of course). So, I 
find it easier to let them have water and grass rather than to give 
them gold and silver (from the Muslims' treasury). By Allah, these 
people think that I have been unjust to them. This is their land, and 
during the pre-lslamic period, they fought for it and they embraced 
Islam (willingly) while it was in their possession. By Him in Whose 
Hand my life is! Were it not for the animals (in my custody) which I 
give to be ridden for striving in Allah's Cause, I would not have 
turned even a span of their land into a Hima."
