<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:253</H3><P><I>Narrated Sahl:</I></P>
On the day (of the battle) of Khaibar the Prophet said, "Tomorrow I 
will give the flag to somebody who will be given victory (by Allah) 
and who loves Allah and His Apostle and is loved by Allah and His 
Apostle." So, the people wondered all that night as to who would 
receive the flag and in the morning everyone hoped that he would be 
that person. Allah's Apostle asked, "Where is 'Ali?" He was told that 
'Ali was suffering from eye-trouble, so he applied saliva to his eyes 
and invoked Allah to cure him. He at once got cured as if he had no 
ailment. The Prophet gave him the flag. 'Ali said, "Should I fight 
them till they become like us (i.e. Muslim)?" The Prophet said, "Go to
them patiently and calmly till you enter the land. Then, invite them 
to Islam, and inform them what is enjoined upon them, for, by Allah, 
if Allah gives guidance to somebody through you, it is better for you 
than possessing red camels."
