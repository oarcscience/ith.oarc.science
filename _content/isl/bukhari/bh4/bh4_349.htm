A man amongst us begot a boy whom he named Al-Qasim. On that the Ansar
said, (to the man), "We will never call you Abu-al-Qasim and will 
never please you with this blessed title." So, he went to the Prophet 
and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have begotten a boy whom I named 
Al-Qasim and the Ansar said, 'We will never call you Abu-al-Qasim, nor
will we please you with this title.' " The Prophet said, "The Ansar 
have done well. Name by my name, but do not name by my Kunya, for I am
Qasim."
