<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:398</H3><P><I>Narrated Sahl bin Abi Hathma:</I></P>
'Abdullah bin Sahl and Muhaiyisa bin Mas'ud bin Zaid set out to 
Khaibar, the inhabitants of which had a peace treaty with the Muslims 
at that time. They parted and later on Muhaiyisa came upon 'Abdullah 
bin Sah! and found him murdered agitating in his blood. He buried him 
and returned to Medina. 'Abdur Rahman bin Sahl, Muhaiyisa and 
Huwaiuisa, the sons of Mas'ud came to the Prophet and 'Abdur Rahman 
intended to talk, but the Prophet said (to him), "Let the eldest of 
you speak." as 'Abdur-Rahman was the youngest:. 'Abdur-Rahman kept 
silent and the other two spoke. The Prophet said, "If you swear as to 
who has committed the murder, you will have the right to take your 
right from the murderer." They said, "How should we swear if we did 
not witness the murder or see the murderer?" The Prophet said, "Then 
the Jews can clear themselves from the charge by taking Alaska (an 
oath taken by men that it was not they who committed the murder)." 
The!y said, "How should we believe in the oaths of infidels?" So, the 
Prophet himself paid the blood money (of 'Abdullah). (See 
Hadith No. 36 Vol. 9.)
