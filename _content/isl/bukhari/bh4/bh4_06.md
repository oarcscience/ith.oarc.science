### Hadith 4:7

*Narrated Sad:*

I fell sick and the Prophet paid me a visit. I said to him, "O Allah's
Apostle! I invoke Allah that He may not let me expire in the land whence
I migrated (i.e. Mecca)." He said, "May Allah give you health and let
the people benefit by you." I said, "I want to will my property, and I
have only one daughter and I want to will half of my property (to be
given in charity)." He said," Half is too much." I said, "Then I will
one third." He said, "One-third, yet even one-third is too much." (The
narrator added, "So the people started to will one third of their
property and that was Permitted for them.")
