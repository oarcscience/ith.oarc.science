<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:250</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</I></P>
That he heard the Prophet saying, "It is not permissible for a man to 
be alone with a woman, and no lady should travel except with a Muhram 
(i.e. her husband or a person whom she cannot marry in any case for 
ever; e.g. her father, brother, etc.)." Then a man got up and said, "O
Allah's Apostle! I have enlisted in the army for such-and-such Ghazwa 
and my wife is proceeding for Hajj." Allah's Apostle said, "Go, and 
perform the Hajj with your wife."
