The Prophet said, "The first batch (of people) who will enter Paradise
will be (glittering) like the full moon, and the batch next to them 
will be (glittering) like the most brilliant star in the sky. Their 
hearts will be as if the heart of a single man, for they will have 
neither enmity nor jealousy amongst themselves; everyone will have two
wives from the houris, (who will be so beautiful, pure and transparent
that) the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the 
bones and the flesh."
