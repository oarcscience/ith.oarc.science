### Hadith 4:378

*Narrated 'Abdullah:*

On the day (of the battle) of Hunain, Allah's Apostle favored some
people in the distribution of the booty (to the exclusion of others); he
gave Al-Aqra' bin Habis one-hundred camels and he gave 'Uyaina the same
amount, and also gave to some of the eminent Arabs, giving them
preference in this regard. Then a person came and said, "By Allah, in
this distribution justice has not been observed, nor has Allah's
Pleasure been aimed at." I said (to him), "By Allah, I will inform the
Prophet (of what you have said), "I went and informed him, and he said,
"If Allah and His Apostle did not act justly, who else would act justly.
May Allah be merciful to Moses, for he was harmed with more than this,
yet he kept patient."
