<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:113</H3><P><I>Narrated Muslim from Abu Aqil from Abu Al-Mutawakkil An-Naji:</I></P>
I called on Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari and said to him, "Relate to 
me what you have heard from Allah's Apostle ." He said, "I accompanied
him on one of the journeys." (Abu Aqil said, "I do not know whether 
that journey was for the purpose of Jihad or 'Umra.") "When we were 
returning," Jabir continued, "the Prophet said, 'Whoever wants to 
return earlier to his family, should hurry up.' We set off and I was 
on a black red tainted camel having no defect, and the people were 
behind me. While I was in that state the camel stopped suddenly 
(because of exhaustion). On that the Prophet said to me, 'O Jabir, 
wait!' Then he hit it once with his lash and it started moving on a 
fast pace. He then said, 'Will you sell the camel?' I replied in the 
affirmative when we reached Medina, and the Prophet went to the Mosque
along with his companions. I, too, went to him after tying the camel 
on the pavement at the Mosque gate. Then I said to him, 'This is your 
camel.' He came out and started examining the camel and saying, 'The 
camel is ours.' Then the Prophet sent some Awaq (i.e. an amount) of 
gold saying, 'Give it to Jabir.' Then he asked, 'Have you taken the 
full price (of the camel)?' I replied in the affirmative. He said, 
'Both the price and the camel are for you.' ''
