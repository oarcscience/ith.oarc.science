<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:319</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
That he and Abu Talha came in the company of the Prophet and Safiya 
was accompanying the Prophet, who let her ride behind him on his 
she-camel. During the journey, the she-camel slipped and both the 
Prophet and (his) wife fell down. Abu Talha (the sub-narrator thinks 
that Anas said that Abu Talha jumped from his camel quickly) said, "O 
Allah's Apostle! May Allah sacrifice me for your sake! Did you get 
hurt?" The Prophet replied,"No, but take care of the lady." Abu Talha 
covered his face with his garment and proceeded towards her and 
covered her with his garment, and she got up. He then set right the 
condition of their she-camel and both of them (i.e. the Prophet and 
his wife) rode and proceeded till they approached Medina. The Prophet 
said, "We are returning with repentance and worshipping and praising 
our Lord." The Prophet kept on saying this statement till he entered 
Medina.
