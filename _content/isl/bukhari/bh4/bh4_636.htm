<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:633</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</I></P>
The prostration in Sura-Sad is not amongst the compulsory 
prostrations, though I saw the Prophet prostrating on reciting The 
Statement of Allah:--and to David We gave Solomon (for a son). How 
excellent (a) slave he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to us) 
(38.30) And His Statement:-- He said: My Lord Forgive me and grant me 
a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' (38.35) And
His Statement:-- 'And they followed what the Devils gave out 
(falsely), of magic in the life-time of Solomon.' (2.102)
