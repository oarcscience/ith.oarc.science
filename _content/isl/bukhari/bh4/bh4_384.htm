<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:380</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
Umar bin Al-Khattab expelled all the Jews and Christians from the land
of Hijaz. Allah's Apostle after conquering Khaibar, thought of 
expelling the Jews from the land which, after he conquered it belonged
to Allah, Allah's Apostle and the Muslims. But the Jews requested 
Allah's Apostle to leave them there on the condition that they would 
do the labor and get half of the fruits (the land would yield). 
Allah's Apostle said, "We shall keep you on these terms as long as we 
wish." Thus they stayed till the time of 'Umar's Caliphate when he 
expelled them to Taima and Ariha.
