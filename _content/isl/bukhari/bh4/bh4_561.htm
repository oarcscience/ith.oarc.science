<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:558</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "I have been made victorious with As-Saba (i.e. an 
easterly wind) and the people of 'Ad were destroyed by Ad-Dabur (i.e. 
Prophet who distributed it among four persons: Al-Aqra' bin Habis 
Al-Hanzali from the tribe of Mujashi, 'Uyaina bin Badr Al-Fazari, Zaid
At-Ta'i who belonged to (the tribe of) Bani Nahban, and 'Alqama bin 
Ulatha Al-'Amir who belonged to (the tribe of) Bani Kilab. So the 
Quraish and the Ansar became angry and said, "He (i.e. the Prophet, ) 
gives the chief of Najd and does not give us." The Prophet said, "I 
give them) so as to attract their hearts (to Islam)." Then a man with 
sunken eyes, prominent checks, a raised forehead, a thick beard and a 
shaven head, came (in front of the Prophet ) and said, "Be afraid of 
Allah, O Muhammad!" The Prophet ' said "Who would obey Allah if I 
disobeyed Him? (Is it fair that) Allah has trusted all the people of 
the earth to me while, you do not trust me?" Somebody who, I think was
Khalid bin Al-Walid, requested the Prophet to let him chop that man's 
head off, but he prevented him. When the man left, the Prophet said, 
"Among the off-spring of this man will be some who will recite the 
Qur'an but the Qur'an will not reach beyond their throats (i.e. they 
will recite like parrots and will not understand it nor act on it), 
and they will renegade from the religion as an arrow goes through the 
game's body. They will kill the Muslims but will not disturb the 
idolaters. If I should live up to their time' I will kill them as the 
people of 'Ad were killed (i.e. I will kill all of them)."
