<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:221</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
Abu Sufyan said, "Heraclius sent for me when I was in 'llya' (i.e. 
Jerusalem). Then he asked for the letter of Allah's Apostle and when 
he had finished its reading there was a great hue and cry around him 
and the voices grew louder and we were asked to quit the place. When 
we were turned out, I said to my companions, 'The cause of Ibn Abi 
Kabsha has become conspicuous as the King of Bani Al-Asfar is afraid 
of him.' "
