<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:405</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Amash:</I></P>
I asked Abu Wail, "Did you take part in the battle of Siffin?" He 
said, 'Yes, and I heard Sahl bin Hunaif (when he was blamed for lack 
of zeal for fighting) saying, "You'd better blame your wrong opinions.
I wish you had seen me on the day of Abu Jandal.  If I had the courage
to disobey the Prophet's orders, I would have done so. We had kept out
swords on our necks and shoulders, for a thing which frightened us. 
And we did so, we found it easier for us, except in the case of the 
above battle (of ours).' "
