<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:71</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir:</I></P>
My father's mutilated body was brought to the Prophet and was placed 
in front of him. I went to uncover his face but my companions forbade 
me. Then mourning cries of a lady were heard, and it was said that she
was either the daughter or the sister of Amr. The Prophet said, "Why 
is she crying?" Or said, "Do not cry, for the angels are still shading
him with their wings." (Al-Bukhari asked Sadqa, a sub-narrator, "Does 
the narration include the expression: 'Till he was lifted?' " The 
latter replied, "Jabir may have said it.")
