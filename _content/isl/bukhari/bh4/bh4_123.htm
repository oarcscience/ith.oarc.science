<P>
"Allah's Apostle arranged a horse race amongst the horses that had 
been made lean, letting them start from Al-Hafya' and their limit 
(distance of running) was up to Thaniyat-al-Wada'. I asked Musa, 'What
was the distance between the two places?' Musa replied, 'Six or seven 
miles. He arranged a race of the horses which had not been made lean 
sending them from Thaniyat-al-Wada', and their limit was up to the 
mosque of Bani Zuraiq.' I asked, 'What was the distance between those 
two places?' He replied 'One mile or so.' Ibn 'Umar was amongst those 
who participated in that horse race."
