<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:369</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf:</I></P>
While I was standing in the row on the day (of the battle) of Badr, I 
looked to my right and my left and saw two young Ansari boys, and I 
wished I had been stronger than they. One of them called my attention 
saying, "O Uncle! Do you know Abu Jahl?" I said, "Yes, What do you 
want from him, O my nephew?" He said, "I have been informed that he 
abuses Allah's Apostle. By Him in Whose Hands my life is, if I should 
see him, then my body will not leave his body till either of us meet 
his fate." I was astonished at that talk. Then the other boy called my
attention saying the same as the other had said. After a while I saw 
Abu Jahl walking amongst the people. I said (to the boys), "Look! This
is the man you asked me about." So, both of them attacked him with 
their swords and struck him to death and returned to Allah'S Apostle 
to inform him of that. Allah's Apostle asked, "Which of you has killed
him?" Each of them said, "I Have killed him." Allah's Apostle asked, 
"Have you cleaned your swords?" They said, "No. " He then looked at 
their swords and said, "No doubt, you both have killed him and the 
spoils of the deceased will be given to Muadh bin Amr bin Al-Jamuh."  
The two boys were Muadh bin 'Afra and Muadh bin Amr bin Al-Jamuh.
