<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:402</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Abu Bakr, on the day of Nahr (i.e. slaughtering of animals for 
sacrifice), sent me in the company of others to make this 
announcement: "After this year, no pagan will be allowed to perform 
the Hajj, and none will be allowed to perform the Tawaf of the Ka'ba 
undressed." And the day of Al-Hajj-ul-Akbar is the day of Nahr, and it
called Al-Akbar because the people call the 'Umra Al-Hajj-ul-Asghar 
(i.e. the minor Hajj). Abu Bakr threw back the pagans' covenant that 
year, and therefore, no pagan performed the Hajj in the year of 
Hajj-ul-Wada' of the Prophets.
