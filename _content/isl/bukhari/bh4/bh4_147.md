### Hadith 4:146

*Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri*

The Prophet said, "A time will come when groups of people will go for
Jihad and it will be asked, 'Is there anyone amongst you who has enjoyed
the company of the Prophet?' The answer will be, 'Yes.' Then they will
be given victory (by Allah) (because of him). Then a time will come when
it will be asked. 'Is there anyone amongst you who has enjoyed the
company of the companions of the Prophet?' It will be said, 'Yes,' and
they will be given victory (by Allah). Then a time will come when it
will be said. 'Is there anyone amongst you who has enjoyed the company
of the companions of the companions of the Prophet?' It will be said,
'Yes,' and they will be given victory (by Allah)."
