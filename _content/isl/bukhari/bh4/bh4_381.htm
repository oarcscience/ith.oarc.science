<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:377</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
While I was walking with the Prophet who was wearing a Najrani outer 
garment with a thick hem, a bedouin came upon the Prophet and pulled 
his garment so violently that I could recognize the impress of the hem
of the garment on his shoulder, caused by the violence of his pull. 
Then the bedouin said, "Order for me something from Allah's Fortune 
which you have." The Prophet turned to him and smiled, and ordered 
that a gift be given to him.
