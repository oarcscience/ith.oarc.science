<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:41</H3><P><I>Narrated Abdullah bin Masud:</I></P>
I asked Allah's Apostle, "O Allah's Apostle! What is the best deed?" 
He replied, "To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times." 
I asked, "What is next in goodness?" He replied, "To be good and 
dutiful to your parents." I further asked, what is next in goodness?" 
He replied, "To participate in Jihad in Allah's Cause." I did not ask 
Allah's Apostle anymore and if I had asked him more, he would have 
told me more.
