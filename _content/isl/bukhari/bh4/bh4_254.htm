<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:252</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
When it was the day (of the battle) of Badr, prisoners of war were 
brought including Al-Abbas who was undressed. The Prophet looked for a
shirt for him. It was found that the shirt of 'Abdullah bin Ubai would
do, so the Prophet let him wear it. That was the reason why the 
Prophet took off and gave his own shirt to 'Abdullah. (The narrator 
adds, "He had done the Prophet some favor for which the Prophet liked 
to reward him.")
