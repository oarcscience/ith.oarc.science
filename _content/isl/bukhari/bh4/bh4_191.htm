<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:190</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle sent his letter to Khusrau and ordered his messenger 
to hand it over to the Governor of Bahrain who was to hand it over to 
Khusrau. So, when Khusrau read the letter he tore it. Said bin 
Al-Musaiyab said, "The Prophet then invoked Allah to disperse them 
with full dispersion, (destroy them (i.e. Khusrau and his followers) 
severely)".
