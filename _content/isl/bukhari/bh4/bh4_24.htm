<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:25</H3><P><I>Narrated Az-Zuhri:</I></P>
Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked 'Aisha about the meaning of the 
Quranic Verse:--
<P>
"And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with the orphan girls 
then marry (other) women of your choice." (4.2-3)
<P>
Aisha said, "It is about a female orphan under the guardianship of her
guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth,
and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of
her standard. So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the 
orphans unless they paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they
were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later on the people
asked Allah's Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following 
Verse:--
<P>
"They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah 
instructs you regarding them..." (4.127)
<P>
and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl was 
beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her
without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could 
get, but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he 
would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman instead of 
her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards
her, he had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her,
unless he treated her justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing 
all her rights.
