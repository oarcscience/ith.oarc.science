Allah's Apostle said, "During your sleep, Satan knots three knots at 
the back of the head of each of you, and he breathes the following 
words at each knot, 'The night is, long, so keep on sleeping,' If that
person wakes up and celebrates the praises of Allah, then one knot is 
undone, and when he performs ablution  the second knot is undone, and 
when he prays, all the knots are undone, and he gets up in the morning
lively and gay, otherwise he gets up dull and gloomy. "
