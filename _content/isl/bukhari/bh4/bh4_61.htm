<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:62</H3><P><I>Narrated Kharija bin Zaid:</I></P>
Zaid bin Thabit said, "When the Quran was compiled from various 
written manuscripts, one of the Verses of Surat Al-Ahzab was missing 
which I used to hear Allah's Apostle reciting. I could not find it 
except with Khuzaima bin Thabjt Al-Ansari, whose witness Allah's 
Apostle regarded as equal to the witness of two men. And the Verse 
was:-- "Among the believers are men who have been true to what they 
covenanted with Allah."    (33.23)
