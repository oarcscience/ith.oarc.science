<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:53</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Nobody who dies and finds good from Allah (in the 
Hereafter) would wish to come back to this world even if he were given
the whole world and whatever is in it, except the martyr who, on 
seeing the superiority of martyrdom, would like to come back to the 
world and get killed again (in Allah's Cause)."
<P>
Allah's Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all 
the world and whatever is in it. A place in Paradise as small as the 
bow or lash of one of you is better than all the world and whatever is
in it. And if a houri from Paradise appeared to the people of the 
earth, she would fill the space between Heaven and the Earth with 
light and pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world 
and whatever is in it."
