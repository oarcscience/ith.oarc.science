<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:412</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said on the day of the conquest of Mecca, "There is no
migration now, but there is Jihad (i.e.. holy battle) and good 
intentions. And when you are called for Jihad, you should come out at 
once" Allah's Apostle also said, on the day of the conquest of Mecca, 
"Allah has made this town a sanctuary since the day He created the 
Heavens and the Earth. So, it is a sanctuary by Allah's Decree till 
the Day of Resurrection. Fighting in it was not legal for anyone 
before me, and it was made legal for me only for an hour by daytime. 
So, it (i.e. Mecca) is a sanctuary by Allah's Decree till the Day of 
Resurrection. Its thorny bushes should not be cut, and its game should
not be chased, its fallen property (i.e. Luqata) should not be picked 
up except by one who will announce it publicly; and its grass should 
not be uprooted," On that Al-'Abbas said, "O Allah's Apostle! Except 
the Idhkhir, because it is used by the goldsmiths and by the people 
for their houses." On that the Prophet said, "Except the Idhkhir."
