### Hadith 4:585

*Narrated Abu Dhar:*

I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Which mosque was first built on the surface
of the earth?" He said, "Al-Masjid-ul-,Haram (in Mecca)." I said, "Which
was built next?" He replied "The mosque of Al-Aqsa ( in Jerusalem) ." I
said, "What was the period of construction between the two?" He said,
"Forty years." He added, "Wherever (you may be, and) the prayer time
becomes due, perform the prayer there, for the best thing is to do so
(i.e. to offer the prayers in time)."
