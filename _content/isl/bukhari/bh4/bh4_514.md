### Hadith 4:510

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

On the day (of the battle) of Uhud when the pagans were defeated, Satan
shouted, "O slaves of Allah! Beware of the forces at your back," and on
that the Muslims of the front files fought with the Muslims of the back
files (thinking they were pagans). Hudhaifa looked back to see his
father "Al-Yaman," (being attacked by the Muslims). He shouted, "O
Allah's Slaves! My father! My father!" By Allah, they did not stop till
they killed him. Hudhaifa said, "May Allah forgive you." 'Urwa said that
Hudhaifa continued to do good (invoking Allah to forgive the killer of
his father till he met Allah (i.e. died).
