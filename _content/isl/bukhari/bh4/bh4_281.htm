<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:278</H3><P><I>Narrated Salama:</I></P>
I went out of Medina towards Al-Ghaba. When I reached the mountain 
path of Al-Ghaba, a slave of 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf met me. I said to 
him, "Woe to you! What brought you here?" He replied, "The she-camels 
of the Prophet have been taken away." I said, "Who took them?" He 
said, "Ghatafan and Fazara." So, I sent three cries, "O Sabaha-h ! O 
Sabahah !" so loudly that made the people in between its (i.e. 
Medina's) two mountains hear me. Then I rushed till I met them after 
they had taken the camels away. I started throwing arrows at them 
saying, "I am the son of Al-Akwa"; and today perish the mean people!" 
So, I saved the she-camels from them before they (i.e. the robbers) 
could drink water. When I returned driving the camels, the Prophet met
me, I said, "O Allah's Apostle Those people are thirsty and I have 
prevented them from drinking water, so send some people to chase 
them." The Prophet said, "O son of Al-Akwa', you have gained power 
(over your enemy), so forgive (them). (Besides) those people are now 
being entertained by their folk."
