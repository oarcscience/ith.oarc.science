<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:262</H3><P><I>Narrated Jarir:</I></P>
Allah's Apostles said to me, "Will you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa? 
Dhul-Khalasa was a house (of an idol) belonging to the tribe of 
Khath'am called Al-Ka'ba Al-Yama-niya. So, I proceeded with one 
hundred and fifty cavalry men from the tribe of Ahmas, who were 
excellent knights. It happened that I could not sit firm on horses, so
the Prophet , stroke me over my chest till I saw his finger-marks over
my chest, he said, 'O Allah! Make him firm and make him a guiding and 
rightly guided man.' " Jarir proceeded towards that house, and 
dismantled and burnt it. Then he sent a messenger to Allah's Apostle 
informing him of that. Jarir's messenger said, "By Him Who has sent 
you with the Truth, I did not come to you till I had left it like an 
emancipated or gabby camel (i.e. completely marred and spoilt)." Jarir
added, "The Prophet asked for Allah's Blessings for the horses and the
men of Ahmas five times."
