<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:372</H3><P><I>Narrated Nafi:</I></P>
'Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "O Allah's Apostle! I vowed to observe 
Itikaf for one day during the Pre-lslamic period." The Prophet ordered
him to fulfill his vow. 'Umar gained two lady captives from the war 
prisoners of Hunain and he left them in some of the houses at Mecca. 
When Allah's Apostle freed the captives of Hunain without ransom, they
came out walking in the streets. 'Umar said (to his son), "O Abdullah!
See what is the matter." 'Abdullah replied, "Allah's Apostle has freed
the captives without ransom." He said (to him), "Go and set free those
two slave girls." (Nafi added:) Allah's Apostle did not perform the 
'Umra from Al-Jarana, and if he had performed the 'Umra, it would not 
have been hidden from 'Abdullah.
