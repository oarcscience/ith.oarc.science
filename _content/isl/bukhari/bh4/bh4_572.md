### Hadith 4:569

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "On the Day of Resurrection Abraham will meet his
father Azar whose face will be dark and covered with dust.(The Prophet
Abraham will say to him): 'Didn't I tell you not to disobey me?' His
father will reply: 'Today I will not disobey you.' 'Abraham will say: 'O
Lord! You promised me not to disgrace me on the Day of Resurrection; and
what will be more disgraceful to me than cursing and dishonoring my
father?' Then Allah will say (to him):' 'I have forbidden Paradise for
the disbelievers." Then he will be addressed, 'O Abraham! Look! What is
underneath your feet?' He will look and there he will see a Dhabh (an
animal,) blood-stained, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in
the (Hell) Fire."
