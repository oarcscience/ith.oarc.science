The Prophet was vigilant one night and when he reached Medina, he 
said, "Would that a pious man from my companions guard me tonight!" 
Suddenly we heard the clatter of arms. He said, "Who is that? " He 
(The new comer) replied, " I am Sad bin Abi Waqqas and have come to 
guard you." So, the Prophet slept (that night).
