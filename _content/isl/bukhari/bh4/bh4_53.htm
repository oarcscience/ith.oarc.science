The Prophet said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is! Were it not for 
some men amongst the believers who dislike to be left behind me and 
whom I cannot provide with means of conveyance, I would certainly 
never remain behind any Sariya' (army-unit) setting out in Allah's 
Cause. By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love to be martyred 
in Al1ah's Cause and then get resurrected and then get martyred, and 
then get resurrected again and then get martyred and then get 
resurrected again and then get martyred.
