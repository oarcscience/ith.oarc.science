### Hadith 4:279

*Narrated Abu Ishaq:*

A man asked Al-Bara "O Abu 'Umara! Did you flee on the day (of the
battle) of Hunain?" Al-Bara replied while I was listening, "As for
Allah's Apostle he did not flee on that day. Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith
was holding the reins of his mule and when the pagans attacked him, he
dismounted and started saying, 'I am the Prophet, and there is no lie
about it; I am the son of 'Abdul Muttalib.' On that day nobody was seen
braver than the Prophet
