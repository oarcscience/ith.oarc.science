The Prophet said, "The superiority of 'Aisha to other ladies is like 
the superiority of Tharid (i.e. meat and bread dish) to other meals. 
Many men reached the level of perfection, but no woman reached such a 
level except Mary, the daughter of Imran and Asia, the wife of 
Pharaoh."
<P>
those women who ride camels (i.e. Arabs), the ladies of Quraish are 
the best. They are merciful and kind to their off-spring and the best 
guardians of their husbands' properties.' Abu Huraira added, "Mary the
daughter of Imran never rode a camel."
