<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:144</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
Um Haram told me that the Prophet one day took a midday nap in her 
house. Then he woke up smiling. Um Haram asked, "O Allah's Apostle! 
What makes you smile?" He replied "I was astonished to see (in my 
dream) some people amongst my followers on a sea-voyage looking like 
kings on the thrones." She said, "O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to 
make me one of them." He replied, "You are amongst them." He slept 
again and then woke up smiling and said the same as before twice or 
thrice. And she said, "O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me one 
of them." And he said, "You are amongst the first batch." 'Ubada bin 
As-Samit married her (i.e. Um Haram) and then he took her for Jihad. 
When she returned, an animal was presented to her to ride, but she 
fell down and her neck was broken.
