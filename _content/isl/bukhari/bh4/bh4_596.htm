Some people asked the Prophet: "Who is the most honorable amongst the 
people?" He replied, "The most honorable among them is the one who is 
the most Allah-fearing." They said, "O Allah's Prophet! We do not ask 
about this." He said, "Then the most honorable person is Joseph, 
Allah's Prophet, the son of Allah's Prophet, the son of Allah's 
Prophet, the son of Allah's Khalil." They said, "We do not ask about 
this." He said, "Then you want to ask me about the Arabs' descent?" 
They said, "Yes." He said, "Those who were best in the pre-lslamic 
period, are the best in Islam, if they comprehend (the religious 
knowledge)."
