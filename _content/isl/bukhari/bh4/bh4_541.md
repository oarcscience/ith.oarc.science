### Hadith 4:538

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, because,
passing by a panting dog near a well and seeing that the dog was about
to die of thirst, she took off her shoe, and tying it with her
head-cover she drew out some water for it. So, Allah forgave her because
of that."
