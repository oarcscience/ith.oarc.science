<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:26</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
In the lifetime of Allah's Apostle , Umar gave in charity some of his 
property, a garden of date-palms called Thamgh. 'Umar said, "O Allah's
Apostle! I have some property which I prize highly and I want to give 
it in charity." The Prophet; said, "Give it in charity (i.e. as an 
endowment) with its land and trees on the condition that the land and 
trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, nor bequeathed, but
the fruits are to be spent in charity." So 'Umar gave it in charity, 
and it was for Allah's Cause, the emancipation of slaves, for the 
poor, for guests, for travelers, and for kinsmen. The person acting as
its administrator could eat from it reasonably and fairly, and could 
let a friend of his eat from it provided he had no intention of 
becoming wealthy by its means.
