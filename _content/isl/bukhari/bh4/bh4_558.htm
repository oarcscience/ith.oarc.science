<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:555</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Noah and his nation will come (on the Day of 
Resurrection and Allah will ask (Noah), "Did you convey (the 
Message)?' He will reply, 'Yes, O my Lord!' Then Allah will ask Noah's
nation, 'Did Noah convey My Message to you?' They will reply, 'No, no 
prophet came to us.' Then Allah will ask Noah, 'Who will stand a 
witness for you?' He will reply, 'Muhammad and his followers (will 
stand witness for me).' So, I and my followers will stand as witnesses
for him (that he conveyed Allah's Message)." That is, (the 
interpretation) of the Statement of Allah: "Thus we have made you a 
just and the best nation that you might be witnesses Over mankind .."
