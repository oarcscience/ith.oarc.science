<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:330</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
(the wife of the Prophet) We set out with Allahs Apostle on one of his
journeys till we reached Al-Baida' or Dhatul-Jaish, a necklace of mine
was broken (and lost). Allah's Apostle stayed there to search for it, 
and so did the people along with him. There was no water at that 
place, so the people went to Abu- Bakr As-Siddiq and said, "Don't you 
see what 'Aisha has done? She has made Allah's Apostle and the people 
stay where there is no water and they have no water with them." Abu 
Bakr came while Allah's Apostle was sleeping with his head on my 
thigh, He said, to me: "You have detained Allah's Apostle and the 
people where there is no water and they have no water with them.
<P>
So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say and hit me 
on my flank with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because 
of pain) but the position of Allah's Apostle on my thigh. Allah's 
Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Allah 
revealed the Divine Verses of Tayammum. So they all performed 
Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, "O the family of Abu Bakr! This is 
not the first blessing of yours." Then the camel on which I was riding
was caused to move from its place and the necklace was found beneath 
it.
