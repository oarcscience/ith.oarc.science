<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:595</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "The Adhan pronounced by Bilal should not stop you 
from taking Suhur, for he pronounces the Adhan at night, so that the 
one offering the late night prayer (Tahajjud) from among you might 
hurry up and the sleeping from among you might wake up. It does not 
mean that dawn or morning has started." Then he (the Prophet) pointed 
with his fingers and raised them up (towards the sky) and then lowered
them (towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas'ud imitated the gesture of
the Prophet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he 
put on each other and then stretched them to the right and left. These
gestures illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and 
right horizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers 
down is not the real dawn) .
