'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "Allah's Apostle entered the Ka'ba along 
with Usama bin Zaid, Bilal and 'Uthman bin Talha Al-Hajabi and closed 
the door and stayed there for some time. I asked Bilal when he came 
out, 'What did the Prophet do?' He replied, 'He offered prayer with 
one pillar to his left and one to his right and three behind.' In 
those days the Ka'ba was supported by six pillars." Malik said: "There
were two pillars on his (the Prophet's) right side."
