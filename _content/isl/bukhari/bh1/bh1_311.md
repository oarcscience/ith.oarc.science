*Narrated 'Aisha:*

A woman asked the Prophet about the bath which is take after finishing
from the menses. The Prophet told her what to do and said, "Purify
yourself with a piece of cloth scented with musk." The woman asked, "How
shall I purify myself with it" He said, "Subhan Allah! Purify yourself
(with it)." I pulled her to myself and said, "Rub the place soiled with
blood with it."
