I asked 'Uthman bin 'Affan about a person who engaged in intercourse but
did no discharge. 'Uthman replied, "He should perform ablution like the
one for ar ordinary prayer but he must wash his penis." 'Uthman added,
"I heard it from Allah's Apostle." I asked 'Ali Az-Zubair, Talha and
Ubai bin Ka'b about it and they, too, gave the same reply. (This order
was cancelled later on and taking a bath became necessary for such
cases).
