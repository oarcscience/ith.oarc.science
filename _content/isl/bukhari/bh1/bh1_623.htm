Abu Huraira said, "I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'The reward of a 
prayer in congregation is twenty five times greater than that of a 
prayer offered by a person alone. The angels of the night and the 
angels of the day gather at the time of Fajr prayer.' " Abu Huraira 
then added, "Recite the Holy Book if you wish, for "Indeed, the 
recitation of the Qur'an in the early dawn (Fajr prayer) is ever 
witnessed." (17.18).
<P>
is twenty seven times greater (than that of the prayer offered by a 
person alone).
