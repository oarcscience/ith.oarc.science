### Hadith 1:466

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "The prayer offered in congregation is twenty five
times more superior (in reward) to the prayer offered alone in one's
house or in a business center, because if one performs ablution and does
it perfectly, and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole intention of
praying, then for each step which he takes towards the mosque, Allah
upgrades him a degree in reward and (forgives) crosses out one sin till
he enters the mosque. When he enters the mosque he is considered in
prayer as long as he is waiting for the prayer and the angels keep on
asking for Allah's forgiveness for him and they keep on saying: 'O
Allah! Be Merciful to him, O Allah! Forgive him, as long as he keeps on
sitting at his praying place and does not pass wind. (See Hadith No.
620).
