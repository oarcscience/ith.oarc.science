<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:617</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is I was about to 
order for collecting fire-wood (fuel) and then order Someone to 
pronounce the Adhan for the prayer and then order someone to lead the 
prayer then I would go from behind and burn the houses of men who did 
not present themselves for the (compulsory congregational) prayer. By 
Him, in Whose Hands my soul is, if anyone of them had known that he 
would get a bone covered with good meat or two (small) pieces of meat 
present in between two ribs, he would have turned up for the 'Isha' 
prayer.'
