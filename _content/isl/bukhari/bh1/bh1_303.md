### Hadith 1:303

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

Fatima bint Abi Hubaish said to Allah's Apostle, "O Allah's Apostle! I
do not become clean (from bleeding). Shall I give up my prayers?"
Allah's Apostle replied: "No, because it is from a blood vessel and not
the menses. So when the real menses begins give up your prayers and when
it (the period) has finished wash the blood off your body (take a bath)
and offer your prayers."
