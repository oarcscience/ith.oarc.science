Some goods came to Allah's Apostle from Bahrain. The Prophet ordered 
the people to spread them in the mosque --it was the biggest amount of
goods Allah's Apostle had ever received. He left for prayer and did 
not even look at it. After finishing the prayer, he sat by those goods
and gave from those to everybody he saw. Al-'Abbas came to him and 
said, "O Allah's Apostle! give me (something) too, because I gave 
ransom for myself and 'Aqil" Allah's Apostle told him to take. So he 
stuffed his garment with it and tried to carry it away but he failed 
to do so. He said, "O Allah's Apostle! Order someone to help me in 
lifting it." The Prophet refused. He then said to the Prophet: Will 
you please help me to lift it?" Allah's Apostle refused. Then 
Al-'Abbas threw some of it and tried to lift it (but failed). He again
said, "O Allah's Apostle Order someone to help me to lift it." He 
refused. Al-'Abbas then said to the Prophet: "Will you please help me 
to lift it?" He again refused. Then Al-'Abbas threw some of it, and 
lifted it on his shoulders and went away. Allah's Apostle kept on 
watching him till he disappeared from his sight and was astonished at 
his greediness. Allah's Apostle did not get up till the last coin was 
distributed.
