<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:89</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Umar:</I></P>
My Ansari neighbor from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live at 
'Awali Al-Medina and used to visit the Prophet by turns. He used to go
one day and I another day. When I went I used to bring the news of 
that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when 
he went, he used to do the same for me. Once my Ansari friend, in his 
turn (on returning from the Prophet), knocked violently at my door and
asked if I was there." I became horrified and came out to him. He 
said, "Today a great thing has happened." I then went to Hafsa and saw
her weeping. I asked her, "Did Allah's Apostle divorce you all?" She 
replied, "I do not know." Then, I entered upon the Prophet and said 
while standing, "Have you divorced your wives?" The Prophet replied in
the negative. On what I said, "Allahu-Akbar (Allah is Greater)." (See 
Hadith No. 119, Vol. 3 for details)
