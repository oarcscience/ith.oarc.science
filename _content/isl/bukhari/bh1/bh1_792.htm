<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:790</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
I saw 'Abdullah bin 'Umar crossing his legs while sitting in the 
prayer and I, a mere youngster in those days, did the same. Ibn 'Umar 
forbade me to do so, and said, "The proper way is to keep the right 
foot propped up and bend the left in the prayer." I said 
questioningly, "But you are doing so (crossing the legs)." He said, 
"My feet cannot bear my weight."
