<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:2</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
(the mother of the faithful believers) Al-Harith bin Hisham asked 
Allah's Apostle "O Allah's Apostle! How is the Divine Inspiration 
revealed to you?" Allah's Apostle replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed)
like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of
all and then this state passes ' off after I have grasped what is 
inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to 
me and I grasp whatever he says." 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the 
Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the 
Sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).
