In the year of the conquest of Khaibar I went with Allah's Apostle 
till we reached Sahba,' a place near Khaibar, where Allah's Apostle 
offered the 'Asr prayer and asked for food. Nothing but Sawrq was

ate it and the Prophet got up for the evening prayer (Maghrib prayer),
rinsed his mouth with water and we did the same, and he then prayed 
without repeating the ablution.
