In the year of the conquest of Khaibar I went with Allah's Apostle 
till we reached Sahba,' a place near Khaibar, where Allah's Apostle 
offered the 'Asr prayer and asked for food. Nothing but Sawrq was 
brought. He ordered it to be moistened with water. He and all of us 
ate it and the Prophet got up for the evening prayer (Maghrib prayer),
rinsed his mouth with water and we did the same, and he then prayed 
without repeating the ablution.
