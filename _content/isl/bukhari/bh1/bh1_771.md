### Hadith 1:769

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Allah's Apostle fell from a horse and the right side of his body was
injured. We went to enquire about his health meanwhile it was time for
the prayer and he led the prayer sitting and we also prayed while
sitting. On completion of the prayer he said, "The Imam is to be
followed; say Takbir when he says it; bow when he bows; rise when he
rises and when he says "Sami'a-l-lahu Liman hamida," say, "Rabbana
walaka-lhamd", and prostrate if he prostrates." Sufyan narrated the same
from Ma'mar. Ibn Juraij said that his (the Prophet's) right leg had been
injured.
