### Hadith 1:804

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Some poor people came to the Prophet and said, "The wealthy people will
get higher grades and will have permanent enjoyment and they pray like
us and fast as we do. They have more money by which they perform the
Hajj, and 'Umra; fight and struggle in Allah's Cause and give in
charity." The Prophet said, "Shall I not tell you a thing upon which if
you acted you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? Nobody
would overtake you and you would be better than the people amongst whom
you live except those who would do the same. Say "Sub-han-al-lah",
"Alhamdu-lillah" and "Allahu Akbar" thirty three times each after every
(compulsory) prayer." We differed and some of us said that we should
say, "Subhan-al-lah" thirty three times and "Alhamdu lillah" thirty
three times and "Allahu Akbar" thirty four times. I went to the Prophet
who said, "Say, "Subhan-al-lah" and "Alhamdu lillah" and "Allahu Akbar"
all together for thirty three times."
