<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:83</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Amr bin Al 'Aas:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle stopped (for a while near the Jimar) at Mina during 
his last Hajj for the people and they were asking him questions. A man
came and said, "I forgot and got my head shaved before slaughtering 
the Hadi (sacrificing animal)." The Prophet said, "There is no harm, 
go and do the slaughtering now." Then another person came and said, "I
forgot and slaughtered (the camel) before Rami (throwing of the 
pebbles) at the Jamra." The Prophet said, "Do the Rami now and there 
is no harm."
<P>
The narrator added: So on that day, when the Prophet was asked about 
anything (as regards the ceremonies of Hajj) performed before or after
its due time, his reply was: "Do it (now) and there is no harm."
