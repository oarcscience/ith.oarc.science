Whenever Ibn 'Umar started the prayer with Takbir, he used to raise 
his hands: whenever he bowed, he used to raise his hands (before 
bowing) and also used to raise his hands on saying, "Sami a-l-lahu 
Liman hamida", and he used to do the same on rising from the second 
Rak'a (for the 3rd Rak'a). Ibn 'Umar said: "The Prophet used to do the
same."
