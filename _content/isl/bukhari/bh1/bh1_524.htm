<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:522</H3><P><I>Narrated Saiyar bin Salama:</I></P>
I along with my father went to Abu- Barza Al-Aslarrni and my father 
asked him, "How Allah's Apostle used to offer the five compulsory 
congregational prayers?" Abu- Barza said, "The Prophet used to pray 
the Zuhr prayer which you (people) call the first one at mid-day when 
the sun had just declined The Asr prayer at a time when after the 
prayer, a man could go to the house at the farthest place in Medina 
(and arrive) while the sun was still hot. (I forgot about the Maghrib 
prayer). The Prophet Loved to delay the 'Isha which you call Al- Atama
and he disliked sleeping before it and speaking after it. After the 
Fajr prayer he used to leave when a man could recognize the one 
sitting beside him and he used to recite between 60 to 100 Ayat (in 
the Fajr prayer) .
