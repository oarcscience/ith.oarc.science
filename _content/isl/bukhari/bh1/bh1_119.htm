<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:119</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
I said to Allah's Apostle "I hear many narrations (Hadiths) from you 
but I forget them." Allah's Apostle said, "Spread your Rida' 
(garment)." I did accordingly and then he moved his hands as if 
filling them with something (and emptied them in my Rida') and then 
said, "Take and wrap this sheet over your body." I did it and after 
that I never forgot any thing.
