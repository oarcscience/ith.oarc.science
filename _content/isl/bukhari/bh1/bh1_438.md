### Hadith 1:437

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:*

In the life-time of Allah's Apostle the mosque was built of adobes, its
roof of the leaves of date-palms and its pillars of the stems of
date-palms. Abu Bakr did not alter it. 'Umar expanded it on the same
pattern as it was in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle by using adobes,
leaves of date-palms and changing the pillars into wooden ones. 'Uthman
changed it by expanding it to a great extent and built its walls with
engraved stones and lime and made its pillars of engraved stones and its
roof of teak wood.
