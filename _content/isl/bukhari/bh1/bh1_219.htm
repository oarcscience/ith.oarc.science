<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:219</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
A Bedouin stood up and started making water in the mosque. The people 
caught him but the Prophet ordered them to leave him and to pour a 
bucket or a tumbler of water over the place where he had passed the 
urine. The Prophet then said, "You have been sent to make things easy 
and not to make them difficult."
