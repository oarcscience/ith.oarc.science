<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:542</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Musa:</I></P>
My companions, who came with me in the boat and I landed at a place 
called Baqi Buthan. The Prophet was in Medina at that time. One of us 
used to go to the Prophet by turns every night at the time of the Isha
prayer. Once I along with my companions went to the Prophet and he was
busy in some of his affairs, so the 'Isha' prayer was delayed to the 
middle of the night He then came out and led the people (in prayer). 
After finishing from the prayer, he addressed the people present there
saying, "Be patient! Don't go away. Have the glad tiding. It is from 
the blessing of Allah upon you that none amongst mankind has prayed at
this time save you." Or said, "None except you has prayed at this 
time." Abu Muisa added, 'So we returned happily after what we heard 
from Alllah's Apostle ."
