Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet arrived at Mecca and sent for 'Uthman bin
Talha. He opened the gate of the Ka'ba and the Prophet, Bilal, Usama 
bin Zaid and 'Uthman bin Talha entered the Ka'ba and then they closed 
its door (from inside). They stayed there for an hour, and then came 
out." Ibn 'Umar added, "I quickly went to Bilal and asked him (whether
the Prophet had prayed). Bilal replied, 'He prayed in it.' I asked, 
'Where?' He replied, 'Between the two pillars.' "Ibn 'Umar added, "I 
forgot to ask how many Rakat he (the Prophet) had prayed in the 
Ka'ba."
