When the Prophet came to Medina, he stayed first with his grandfathers
or maternal uncles from Ansar. He offered his prayers facing 
Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he 
wished that he could pray facing the Ka'ba (at Mecca). The first 
prayer which he offered facing the Ka'ba was the 'Asr prayer in the 
company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer 
with him came out and passed by some people in a mosque who were 
bowing during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He said addressing 
them, "By Allah, I testify that I have prayed with Allah's Apostle 
facing Mecca (Ka'ba).' Hearing that, those people changed their 
direction towards the Ka'ba immediately. Jews and the people of the 
scriptures used to be pleased to see the Prophet facing Jerusalem in 
prayers but when he changed his direction towards the Ka'ba, during 
the prayers, they disapproved of it.
<P>
Al-Bara' added, "Before we changed our direction towards the Ka'ba 
(Mecca) in prayers, some Muslims had died or had been killed and we 
did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers.) Allah 
then revealed: And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be 
lost (i.e. the prayers of those Muslims were valid).' " (2:143).
