The people mentioned the fire and the bell (they suggested those as 
signals to indicate the starting of prayers), and by that they 
mentioned the Jews and the Christians. Then Bilal was ordered to

the Iqama (the call for the actual standing for the prayers in rows) 
by saying its wordings once. (Iqama is pronounced when the people are 
ready for the prayer).
