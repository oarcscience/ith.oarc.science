In the mosque l asked Ibn Abi Hadrad to pay the debts which he owed to
me and our voices grew louder. Allah's Apostle heard that while he was
in his house. So he came to us raising the curtain of his room and 
said, "O Ka'b!" I replied, "Labaik, O Allah's Apostle!" He said, "O 
Ka'b! reduce your debt to one half," gesturing with his hand. I said, 
"O Allah's Apostle! I have done so." Then Allah's Apostle said (to Ibn
Abi Hadrad), "Get up and pay the debt to him."
