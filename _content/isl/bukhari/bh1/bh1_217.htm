<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:217</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
The Prophet once passed by two graves and said, "These two persons are
being tortured not for a major sin (to avoid). One of them never saved
himself from being soiled with his urine, while the other used to go 
about with calumnies(to make enmity between friends)." The Prophet 
then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree, split it into (pieces) and
fixed one on each grave. They said, "O Allah's Apostle! Why have you 
done so?" He replied, "I hope that their punishment might be lessened 
till these (the pieces of the leaf) become dry." (See the foot-note of
Hadith 215).
