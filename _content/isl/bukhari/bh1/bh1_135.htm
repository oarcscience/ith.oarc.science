'Abdullah bin 'Umar said: "A man got up in the mosque and said: O 
Allah's Apostle 'At which place you order us that we should assume the
Ihram?' Allah's Apostle replied, 'The residents of Medina should 
assure the Ihram from Dhil-Hulaifa, the people of Syria from Al-Ju,hfa
and the people of Najd from Qarn." Ibn 'Umar further said, "The people
consider that Allah's Apostle had also said, 'The residents of Yemen 
should assume Ihram from Yalamlam.' " Ibn 'Umar used to say, "I do 
not: remember whether Allah's Apostle had said the last statement or 
not?"
