<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:125</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Musa:</I></P>
A man came to the Prophet and asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What kind of 
fighting is in Allah's cause? (I ask this), for some of us fight 
because of being enraged and angry and some for the sake of his pride 
and haughtiness." The Prophet raised his head (as the questioner was 
standing) and said, "He who fights so that Allah's Word (Islam) should
be superior, then he fights in Allah's cause."
