<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:682</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Once Allah's Apostle prayed two Rakat (instead of four) and finished 
his prayer. Dhu-l-yadain asked him whether the prayer had been reduced
or whether he had forgotten. Allah's Apostle asked the people whether 
Dhu-l-yadain was telling the truth. The people replied in the 
affirmative. Then Allah's Apostle stood up, offered the remaining two 
Rakat and then finished his prayer with Taslim and then said, "Allahu 
Akbar." He followed it with two prostrations like ordinary 
prostrations or a bit longer.
