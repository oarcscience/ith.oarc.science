<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:55</H3><P><I>Narrated Ziyad bin'Ilaqa:</I></P>
I heard Jarir bin 'Abdullah (Praising Allah). On the day when 
Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba died, he (Jarir) got up (on the pulpit) and 
thanked and praised Allah and said, "Be afraid of Allah alone Who has 
none along with Him to be worshipped.(You should) be calm and quiet 
till the (new) chief comes to you and he will come to you soon. Ask 
Allah's forgiveness for your (late) chief because he himself loved to 
forgive others." Jarir added, "Amma badu (now then), I went to the 
Prophet and said, 'I give my pledge of allegiance to you for Islam." 
The Prophet conditioned (my pledge) for me to be sincere and true to 
every Muslim so I gave my pledge to him for this. By the Lord of this 
mosque! I am sincere and true to you (Muslims). Then Jarir asked for 
Allah's forgiveness and came down (from the pulpit).
