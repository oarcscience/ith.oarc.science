<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:316</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Urwa:</I></P>
'Aisha said, "We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj. Some of us
intended to perform 'Umra while others Hajj. When we reached Mecca, 
Allah's Apostle said, 'Those who had assumed the lhram for'Umra and 
had not brought the Hadi should finish his lhram and whoever had 
assumed the Ihram for 'Umra and brought the Hadi should not finish the
Ihram till he has slaughtered his Hadi and whoever had assumed the 
lhram for Hajj should complete his Hajj." 'Aisha further said, "I got 
my periods (menses) and kept on menstruating till the day of 'Arafat, 
and I had assumed the Ihram for 'Umra only (Tamattu'). The Prophet 
ordered me to undo and comb my head hair and assume the lhram for Hajj
only and leave the 'Umra. I did the same till I completed the Hajj. 
Then the Prophet sent 'Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me and ordered 
me to perform 'Umra from At-Tan'im in lieu of the missed 'Umra."
