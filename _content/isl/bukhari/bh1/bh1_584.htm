<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:582</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "When the Adhan is pronounced Satan takes to his
heels and passes wind with noise during his flight in order not to 
hear the Adhan. When the Adhan is completed he comes back and again 
takes to his heels when the Iqama is pronounced and after its 
completion he returns again till he whispers into the heart of the 
person (to divert his attention from his prayer) and makes him 
remember things which he does not recall to his mind before the prayer
and that causes him to forget how much he has prayed."
