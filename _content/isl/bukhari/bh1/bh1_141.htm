<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:141</H3><P><I>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle proceeded from 'Arafat till when he reached the 
mountain pass, he dismounted, urinated and then performed ablution but
not a perfect one. I said to him, ("Is it the time for) the prayer, O 
Allah's Apostle?" He said, "The (place of) prayer is ahead of you." He
rode till when he reached Al-Muzdalifa, he dismounted and performed 
ablution and a perfect one, The (call for) Iqama was pronounced and he
led the Maghrib prayer. Then everybody made his camel kneel down at 
its place. Then the Iqama was pronounced for the 'Isha' prayer which 
the Prophet led and no prayer was offered in between the two . prayers
('Isha' and Maghrib).
