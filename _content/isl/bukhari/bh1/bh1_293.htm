'Aisha  said, "We set out with the sole intention of performing Hajj 
and when we reached Sarif, (a place six miles from Mecca) I got my 
menses. Allah's Apostle came to me while I was weeping. He said 'What 
is the matter with you? Have you got your menses?' I replied, 'Yes.' 
He said, 'This is a thing which Allah has ordained for the daughters 
of Adam. So do what all the pilgrims do with the exception of the 
Taw-af (Circumambulation) round the Ka'ba." 'Aisha added, "Allah's 
Apostle sacrificed cows on behalf of his wives."
