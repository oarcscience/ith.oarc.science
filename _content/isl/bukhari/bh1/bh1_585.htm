Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri told my father, "I see you liking sheep and the 
wilderness. So whenever you are with your sheep or in the wilderness 
and you want to pronounce Adhan for the prayer raise your voice in 
doing so, for whoever hears the Adhan, whether a human being, a jinn 
or any other creature, will be a witness for you on the Day of 
Resurrection." Abu Said added, "I heard it (this narration) from 
Allah's Apostle."
