### Hadith 1:197

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

When the ailment of the Prophet became aggravated and his disease became
severe, he asked his wives to permit him to be nursed (treated) in my
house. So they gave him the permission. Then the Prophet came (to my
house) with the support of two men, and his legs were dragging on the
ground, between 'Abbas, and another man." 'Ubaid-Ullah (the sub
narrator) said, "I informed 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas of what'Aisha said. Ibn
'Abbas said: 'Do you know who was the other man?' I replied in the
negative. Ibn 'Abbas said, 'He was 'Ali (bin Abi Talib)." 'Aisha further
said, "When the Prophet came to my house and his sickness became
aggravated he ordered us to pour seven skins full of water on him, so
that he might give some advice to the people. So he was seated in a
Mikhdab (brass tub) belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet. Then,
all of us started pouring water on him from the water skins till he
beckoned to us to stop and that we have done (what he wanted us to do).
After that he went out to the people."
