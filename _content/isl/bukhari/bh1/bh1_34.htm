<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:35</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "The person who participates in (Holy battles) in 
Allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah 
and His Apostles, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, 
or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to Paradise (if he is 
killed in the battle as a martyr). Had I not found it difficult for my
followers, then I would not remain behind any sariya going for Jihad 
and I would have loved to be martyred in Allah's cause and then made 
alive, and then martyred and then made alive, and then again martyred 
in His cause."
