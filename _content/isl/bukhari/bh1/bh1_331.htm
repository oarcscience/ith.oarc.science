<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:331</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "I have been given five things which were not given 
to any one else before me.
<P>
1. Allah made me victorious by awe, (by His frightening my enemies) 
for a distance of one month's journey.
<P>
2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for 
praying and a thing to perform Tayammum, therefore anyone of my 
followers can pray wherever the time of a prayer is due.
<P>
3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me yet it was not lawful
for anyone else before me.
<P>
4. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of 
Resurrection).
<P>
5. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation only but I have been 
sent to all mankind.
