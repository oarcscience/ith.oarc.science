<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:590</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Al-Harith:</I></P>
Once on a rainy muddy day, Ibn 'Abbas delivered a sermon in our 
presence and when the Mu'adhdhin pronounced the Adhan and said, "Haiya
ala-s-sala(t) (come for the prayer)" Ibn 'Abbas ordered him to say 
'Pray at your homes.' The people began to look at each other 
(surprisingly). Ibn 'Abbas said. "It was done by one who was much 
better than I (i.e. the Prophet or his Mu'adhdhin), and it is a 
license.'
