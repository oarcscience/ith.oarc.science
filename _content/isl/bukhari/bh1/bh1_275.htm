<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:275</H3><P><I>Narrated Maimuna:</I></P>
I placed water for the bath of the Prophet and screened him with a 
garment. He poured water over his hands and washed them. After that he
poured water with his right hand over his left and washed his private 
parts, rubbed his hands with earth and washed them, rinsed his mouth, 
washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out and 
then washed his face and forearms. He poured water over his head and 
body. He then shifted from that place and washed his feet. I gave him 
a piece of cloth but he did not take it and came out removing the 
water (from his body) with both his hands.
