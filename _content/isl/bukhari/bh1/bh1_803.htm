I remember Allah's Apostle and also the mouthful of water which he 
took from a bucket in our house and ejected (on me). I heard from 
ltban bin Malik Al-Ansari, who was one from Bani Salim, saying, "I 
used to lead my tribe of Bani Salim in prayer. Once I went to the 
Prophet and said to him, 'I have weak eye-sight and at times the 
rainwater flood intervenes between me and the mosque of my tribe and I
wish that you would come to my house and pray at some place so that I 
could take that place as a place for praying (mosque). He said, "Allah
willing, I shall do that." Next day Allah's Apostle along with Abu 
Bakr, came to my house after the sun had risen high and he asked 
permission to enter. I gave him permission, but he didn't sit till he 
said to me, "Where do you want me to pray in your house?" I pointed to
a place in the house where I wanted him to pray. So he stood up for 
the prayer and we aligned behind him. He completed the prayer with 
Taslim and we did the same simultaneously."
