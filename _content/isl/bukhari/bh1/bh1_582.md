### Hadith 1:580

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

When the number of Muslims increased they discussed the question as to
how to know the time for the prayer by some familiar means. Some
suggested that a fire be lit (at the time of the prayer) and others put
forward the proposal to ring the bell. Bilal was ordered to pronounce
the wording of Adhan twice and of the Iqama once only.

wording of Adhan twice ...](bh1_583)
