### Hadith 1:310

*Narrated Um-'Atiya:*

We were forbidden to mourn for a dead person for more than three days
except in the case of a husband for whom mourning was allowed for four
months and ten days. (During that time) we were not allowed to put ko,hl
(Antimony eye power) in our eyes or to use perfumes or to put on colored
clothes except a dress made of 'Asb (a kind of Yemen cloth, very coarse
and rough). We were allowed very light perfumes at the time of taking a
bath after menses and also we were forbidden to go with the funeral
procession .
