<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:79</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Musa:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "The example of guidance and knowledge with which 
Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of 
which was fertile soil that absorbed rain water and brought forth 
vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was 
hard and held the rain water and Allah benefited the people with it 
and they utilized it for drinking, making their animals drink from it 
and for irrigation of the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it 
was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth 
vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example
of the person who comprehends Allah's religion and gets benefit (from 
the knowledge) which Allah has revealed through me (the Prophets and 
learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person 
who does not care for it and does not take Allah's guidance revealed 
through me (He is like that barren land.)"
