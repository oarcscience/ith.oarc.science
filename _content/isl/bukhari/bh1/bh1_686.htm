<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:684</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
the mother of the faithful believers: Allah's Apostle in his last 
illness said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer." I 
said, "If Abu Bakr stood in your place, he would not be able to make 
the people hear him owing to his weeping. So please order 'Umar to 
lead the prayer." He said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the 
prayer." I said to Hafsa, "Say to him, 'Abu Bakr is a softhearted man 
and if he stood in your place he would not be able to make the people 
hear him owing to his weeping. So order 'Umar to lead the people in 
the prayer.' " Hafsa did so but Allah's Apostle said, "Keep quiet. 
Verily you are the companions of (Prophet) Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to 
lead the people in the prayer." Hafsa said to me, "I never got any 
good from you."
