### Hadith 1:314

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

On the 1st of Dhul-Hijja we set out with the intention of performing
Hajj. Allah's Apostle said, "Any one who likes to assume the Ihram for
'Umra he can do so. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have
assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. "Some of us assumed the Ihram for 'Umra
while the others assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I was one of those who
assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. I got menses and kept on menstruating until
the day of 'Arafat and complained of that to the Prophet . He told me to
postpone my 'Umra, undo and comb my hair, and to assure the Ihram of
Hajj and I did so. On the right of Hasba, he sent my brother
'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me to At-Tah'im, where I assumed the
Ihram for'Umra in lieu of the previous one. Hisham said, "For that
('Umra) no Hadi, fasting or alms were required.
