<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:665</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
Once I passed the night in the house of my aunt Maimuna. Allah's 
Apostle offered the 'Isha' prayer and then came to the house and 
offered four Rakat an slept. Later on, he woke up and stood for the 
prayer and I stood on his left side. He drew me to his right and 
prayed five Rakat and then two. He then slept till I heard him snoring
(or heard his breath sounds). Afterwards he went out for the morning 
prayer.
