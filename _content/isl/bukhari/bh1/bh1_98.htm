<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:98</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
I said: "O Allah's Apostle! Who will be the luckiest person, who will 
gain your intercession on the Day of Resurrection?" Allah's Apostle 
said: O Abu Huraira! "I have thought that none will ask me about it 
before you as I know your longing for the (learning of) Hadiths. The 
luckiest person who will have my intercession on the Day of 
Resurrection will be the one who said sincerely from the bottom of his
heart "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah."
<P>
And 'Umar bin 'Abdul 'Aziz wrote to Abu Bakr bin Hazm, "Look for the 
knowledge of Hadith and get it written, as I am afraid that religious 
knowledge will vanish and the religious learned men will pass away 
(die). Do not accept anything save the Hadiths of the Prophet. 
Circulate knowledge and teach the ignorant, for knowledge does not 
vanish except when it is kept secretly (to oneself)."
