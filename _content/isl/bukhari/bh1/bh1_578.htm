<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:576</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu 'Uthman:</I></P>
'Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr said, "The Suffa Companions were poor 
people and the Prophet said, 'Whoever has food for two persons should 
take a third one from them (Suffa companions). And whosoever has food 
for four persons he should take one or two from them' Abu Bakr took 
three men and the Prophet took ten of them."
<P>
'Abdur Rahman added, my father my mother and I were there (in the 
house). (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether 'Abdur Rahman also said,
'My wife and our servant who was common for both my house and Abu 
Bakr's house). Abu Bakr took his supper with the Prophet and remained 
there till the 'Isha' prayer was offered. Abu Bakr went back and 
stayed with the Prophet till the Prophet took his meal and then Abu 
Bakr returned to his house after a long portion of the night had 
passed. Abu Bakr's wife said, 'What detained you from your guests (or 
guest)?' He said, 'Have you not served them yet?' She said, 'They 
refused to eat until you come. The food was served for them but they 
refused." 'Abdur Rahman added, "I went away and hid myself (being 
afraid of Abu Bakr) and in the meantime he (Abu Bakr) called me, 'O 
Ghunthar (a harsh word)!' and also called me bad names and abused me 
and then said (to his family), 'Eat. No welcome for you.' Then (the 
supper was served). Abu Bakr took an oath that he would not eat that 
food. The narrator added: By Allah, whenever any one of us (myself and
the guests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it 
increased from underneath. We all ate to our fill and the food was 
more than it was before its serving.
<P>
Abu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving
or even more than that. He addressed his wife (saying) 'O the sister 
of Bani Firas! What is this?' She said, 'O the pleasure of my eyes! 
The food is now three times more than it was before.' Abu Bakr ate 
from it, and said, 'That (oath) was from Satan' meaning his oath (not 
to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it and then took 
the rest of it to the Prophet. So that meal was with the Prophet. 
There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of 
that treaty had elapsed the Prophet divided us into twelve (groups) 
(the Prophet's companions) each being headed by a man. Allah knows how
many men were under the command of each (leader). So all of them (12 
groups of men) ate of that meal."
