<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:64</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abbas:</I></P>
Once Allah's Apostle gave a letter to a person and ordered him to go 
and deliver it to the Governor of Bahrain. (He did so) and the 
Governor of Bahrain sent it to Chousroes, who read that letter and 
then tore it to pieces. (The sub-narrator (Ibn Shihab) thinks that Ibn
Al-Musaiyab said that Allah's Apostle invoked Allah against them 
(saying), "May Allah tear them into pieces, and disperse them all 
totally.)"
