<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:569</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abi Qatada:</I></P>
My father said, "One night we were traveling with the Prophet and some
people said, 'We wish that Allah's Apostle would take a rest along 
with us during the last hours of the night.' He said, 'I am afraid 
that you will sleep and miss the (Fajr) prayer.' Bilal said, 'I will 
make you get up.' So all slept and Bilal rested his back against his 
Rahila and he too was overwhelmed (by sleep) and slept. The Prophet 
got up when the edge of the sun had risen and said, 'O Bilal! What 
about your statement?' He replied, 'I have never slept such a sleep.' 
The Prophet said, 'Allah captured your souls when He wished, and 
released them when He wished. O Bilal! Get up and pronounce the Adhan 
for the prayer.' The Prophet performed ablution and when the sun came 
up and became bright, he stood up and prayed."
