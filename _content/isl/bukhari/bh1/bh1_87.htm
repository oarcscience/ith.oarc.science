<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:88</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abi Mulaika:</I></P>
'Uqba bin Al-Harith said that he had married the daughter of Abi Ihab 
bin 'Aziz. Later on a woman came to him and said, "I have suckled 
(nursed) Uqba and the woman whom he married (his wife) at my breast." 
'Uqba said to her, "Neither I knew that you have suckled (nursed) me 
nor did you tell me." Then he rode over to see Allah's Apostle at 
Medina, and asked him about it. Allah's Apostle said, "How can you 
keep her as a wife when it has been said (that she is your 
foster-sister)?" Then Uqba divorced her, and she married another man.
