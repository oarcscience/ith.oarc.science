<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:639</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</I></P>
I heard Anas saying, "A man from Ansar said to the Prophet, 'I cannot 
pray with you (in congregation).' He was a very fat man and he 
prepared a meal for the Prophet and invited him to his house. He 
spread out a mat for the Prophet, and washed one of its sides with 
water, and the Prophet prayed two Rakat on it." A man from the family 
of Al-Jaruid asked, "Did the Prophet used to pray the Duha (forenoon) 
prayer?" Anas said, "I did not see him praying the Duha prayer except 
on that day."
