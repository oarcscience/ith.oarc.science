The Prophet remained behind us on a journey. He joined us while we 
were performing ablution for the 'Asr prayer which was over-due and we
were just passing wet hands over our feet (not washing them 
thoroughly) so he addressed us in a loud voice saying twice orthriae, 
"Save your heels from the fire."
