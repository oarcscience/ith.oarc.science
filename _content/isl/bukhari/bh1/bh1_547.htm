<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:545</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Juraij from Nafi:</I></P>
'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "Once Allah's Apostle was busy (at the time 
of the 'Isha'), so the prayer was delayed so much so that we slept and
woke up and slept and woke up again. The Prophet came out and said, 
'None amongst the dwellers of the earth but you have been waiting for 
the prayer." Ibn 'Umar did not find any harm in praying it earlier or 
in delaying it unless he was afraid that sleep might overwhelm him and
he might miss the prayer, and sometimes he used to sleep before the 
'Isha' prayer. Ibn Juraij said, "I said to 'Ata', 'I heard Ibn 'Abbas 
saying: Once Allah's Apostle delayed the 'Isha' prayer to such an 
extent that the people slept and got up and slept again and got up 
again. Then 'Umar bin Al-Khattab I, stood up and reminded the Prophet 
I of the prayer.' 'Ata' said, 'Ibn 'Abbas said: The Prophet came out 
as if I was looking at him at this time, and water was trickling from 
his head and he was putting his hand on his head and then said, 
'Hadn't I thought it hard for my followers, I would have ordered them 
to pray ('Isha' prayer) at this time.' I asked 'Ata' for further 
information, how the Prophet had kept his hand on his head as he was 
told by Ibn 'Abbas. 'Ata' separated his fingers slightly and put their
tips on the side of the head, brought the fingers downwards 
approximating them till the thumb touched the lobe of the ear at the 
side of the temple and the beard on the face. He neither slowed nor 
hurried in this action but he acted like that. The Prophet said: 
"Hadn't I thought it hard for my followers I would have ordered them 
to pray at this time."
