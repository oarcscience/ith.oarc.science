Zaid bin Thabit said, "We took the "Suhur" (the meal taken before dawn
while fasting is observed) with the Prophet and then stood up for the 
(morning) prayer." I asked him how long the interval between the two 
(Suhur and prayer) was. He replied, 'The interval between the two was 
just sufficient to recite fifty to Sixth 'Ayat."
