<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:131</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
I was informed that the Prophet had said to Mu'adh, "Whosoever will 
meet Allah without associating anything in worship with Him will go to

of this good news?" The Prophet replied, "No, I am afraid, lest they 
should depend upon it (absolutely)."
