Some women requested the Prophet to fix a day for them as the men were
taking all his time. On that he promised them one day for religious

"A woman whose three children die will be shielded by them from the 
Hell fire." On that a woman asked, "If only two die?" He replied, 
"Even two (will shield her from the Hell-fire)."
