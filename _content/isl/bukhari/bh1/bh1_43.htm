A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to Allah's Apostle and we heard
his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he 
came near and then we came to know that he was asking about Islam. 
Allah's Apostle said, "You have to offer prayers perfectly five times 
in a day and night (24 hours)." The man asked, "Is there any more 
(praying)?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, but if you want to offer the
Nawafil prayers (you can)." Allah's Apostle further said to him: "You 
have to observe fasts during the month of Ramad, an." The man asked, 
"Is there any more fasting?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, but if you 
want to observe the Nawafil fasts (you can.)" Then Allah's Apostle 
further said to him, "You have to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)."
The man asked, "Is there any thing other than the Zakat for me to 
pay?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, unless you want to give alms of 
your own." And then that man retreated saying, "By Allah! I will 
neither do less nor more than this." Allah's Apostle said, "If what he
said is true, then he will be successful (i.e. he will be granted 
Paradise)."
