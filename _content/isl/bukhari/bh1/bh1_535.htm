The Prophet said, "The example of Muslims, Jews and Christians is like
the example of a man who employed laborers to work for him from 
morning till night. They worked till mid-day and they said, 'We are 
not in need of your reward.' SO the man employed another batch and 
said to them, 'Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the 
wages I had fixed (for the first batch). They worked Up till the time 
of the 'Asr prayer and said, 'Whatever we have done is for you.' He 
employed another batch. They worked for the rest of the day till 
sunset, and they received the wages of the two former batches."
