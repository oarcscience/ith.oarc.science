<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:364</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet forbade two kinds of sales i.e. Al-Limais and An-Nibadh 
(the former is a kind of sale in which the deal is completed if the 
buyer touches a thing, without seeing or checking it properly and the 
latter is a kind of a sale in which the deal is completed when the 
seller throws a thing towards the buyer giving him no opportunity to 
see, touch or check it) and (the Prophet forbade) also 
Ishtimal-As-Samma' and Al-Ihtiba' in a single garment.
