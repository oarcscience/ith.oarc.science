The Prophet said, "Martyrs are those who die because of drowning, 
plague, an abdominal disease, or of being buried alive by a falling 
building." And then he added, "If the people knew the Reward for the 
Zuhr prayer in its early time, they would race for it. If they knew 
the reward for the 'Isha' and the Fajr prayers in congregation, they 
would join them even if they had to crawl. If they knew the reward for
the first row, they would draw lots for it."
