<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:782</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Qilaba:</I></P>
Once Malik bin Huwairith said to his friends, "Shall I show you how 
Allah's Apostle used to offer his prayers?" And it was not the time 
for any of the compulsory congregational prayers. So he stood up (for 
the prayer) bowed and said the Takbir, then he raised his head and 
remained standing for a while and then prostrated and raised his head 
for a while (sat up for a while). He prayed like our Sheikh 'Amr Ibn 
Salama. (Aiyub said, "The latter used to do a thing which I did not 
see the people doing i.e. he used to sit between the third and the 
fourth Rak'a). IMalik bin Huwairith said, "We came to the Prophet 
(after embracing Islam) and stayed with him. He said to us, 'When you 
go back to your families, pray such and such a prayer at such and such
a time, pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, and when 
there is the time for the prayer then only of you should pronounce the
Adhan for the prayer and the oldest of you should lead the prayer."
