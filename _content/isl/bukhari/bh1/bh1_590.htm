Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever after listening to the Adhan says, 
'Allahumma Rabba hadhihi-d-da' watit-tammati was-salatil qa'imati, ati
Muhammadan al-wasilata wal-fadilata, wab' athhu maqaman 
mahmudan-il-ladhi wa' adtahu (O Allah! Lord of this perfect call (of 
not ascribing partners to You) and of the regular prayer which is 
going to be established! Kindly give Muhammad the right of 
intercession and superiority and send him (on the Day of Judgment) to 
the best and the highest place in Paradise which You promised him)', 
then intercession for me will be permitted for him on the Day of 
Resurrection").
