Ibn 'Umar said, "Allah's Apostle said, 'If the supper is served for 
anyone of you and the Iqama is pronounced, start with the supper and 
don't be in haste (and carry on eating) till you finish it." If food 
was served for Ibn 'Umar and Iqama was pronounced, he never came to

meals, he should not hurry up till he is; satisfied even if the prayer
has been started."
