<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:466</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "The prayer offered in congregation is twenty five 
times more superior (in reward) to the prayer offered alone in one's 
house or in a business center, because if one performs ablution and 
does it perfectly, and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole 
intention of praying, then for each step which he takes towards the 
mosque, Allah upgrades him a degree in reward and (forgives) crosses 
out one sin till he enters the mosque. When he enters the mosque he is
considered in prayer as long as he is waiting for the prayer and the 
angels keep on asking for Allah's forgiveness for him and they keep on
saying: 'O Allah! Be Merciful to him, O Allah! Forgive him, as long as
he keeps on sitting at his praying place and does not pass wind. (See 
Hadith No. 620).
