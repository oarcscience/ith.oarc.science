<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:191</H3><P><I>Narrated Amr bin Yahya:</I></P>
My father said, "I saw Amr bin Abi Hasan asking 'Abdullah bin Zaid 
about the ablution of the Prophet. Abdullah bin Zaid asked for an 
earthenware pot containing water and performed ablution in front of 
them. He poured water over his hands and washed them thrice. Then he 
put his (right) hand in the pot and rinsed his mouth and washed his 
nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out thrice with three 
handfuls of water Again he put his hand in the water and washed his 
face thrice. After that he put his hand in the pot and washed his 
forearms up to the elbows twice and then again put his hand in the 
water and passed wet hands over his head by bringing them to the front
and then to the back and once more he put his hand in the pot and 
washed his feet (up to the ankles.)"
