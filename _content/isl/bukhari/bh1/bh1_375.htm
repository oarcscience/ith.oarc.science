<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:375</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
Once Allah's Apostle fell off a horse and his leg or shoulder got 
injured. He swore that he would not go to his wives for one month and 
he stayed in a Mashruba (attic room) having stairs made of date palm 
trunks. So his companions came to visit him, and he led them in prayer
sitting, whereas his companions were standing. When he finished the 
prayer, he said, "Imam is meant to be followed, so when he says 
'Allahu Akbar,' say 'Allahu Akbar' and when he bows, bow and when he 
prostrates, prostrate and if he prays standing pray, standing. After 
the 29th day the Prophet came down (from the attic room) and the 
people asked him, "O Allah's Apostle! You swore that you will not go 
to your wives for one month." He said, "The month is 29 days."
