<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:165</H3><P><I>Narrated Humran:</I></P>
(the freed slave of 'Uthman bin 'Affan) I saw 'Uthman bin 'Affan 
asking (for a tumbler of water) to perform ablution (and when it was 
brought) he poured water from it over his hands and washed them thrice
and then put his right hand in the water container and rinsed his 
mouth and washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it 
out. Then he washed his face thrice and (then) forearms up to the 
elbows thrice, then passed his wet hands over his head and then washed
each foot thrice. After that 'Uthman said, "I saw the Prophet 
performing ablution like this of mine, and he said, 'If anyone 
performs ablution like that of mine and offers a two-rak'at prayer 
during which he does not think of anything else (not related to the 
present prayer) then his past sins will be forgiven. '
