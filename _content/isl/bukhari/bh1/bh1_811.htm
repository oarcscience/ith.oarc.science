<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:809</H3><P><I>Narrated Um Salama:</I></P>
"The Prophet after finishing the prayer with Taslim used to stay at 
his place for a while." Ibn Shihab said, "I think (and Allah knows 
better), that he used to wait for the departure of the women who had 
prayed." Ibn Shihab wrote that he had heard it from Hind bint 
Al-Harith Al-Firasiya from Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet (Hind 
was from the companions of Um Salama) who said, "When the Prophet 
finished the prayer with Taslim, the women would depart and enter 
their houses before Allah's Apostle departed."
