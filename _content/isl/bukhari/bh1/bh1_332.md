### Hadith 1:332

*Narrated 'Urwa's father:*

Aisha said, "I borrowed a necklace from Asma' and it was lost. So
Allah's Apostle sent a man to search for it and he found it. Then the
time of the prayer became due and there was no water. They prayed
(without ablution) and informed Allah's Apostle about it, so the verse
of Tayammum was revealed." Usaid bin Hudair said to 'Aisha, "May Allah
reward you. By Allah, whenever anything happened which you did not like,
Allah brought good for you and for the Muslims in that."

Al-Jurf and the time for the 'Asr prayer became due while he was at
Marbad-AnNa'am (sheep-fold), so he (performed Tayammum) and prayed there
and then entered Medina when the sun was still high but he did not
repeat that prayer.
