### Hadith 1:92

*Narrated Abu Musa:*

The Prophet was asked about things which he did not like, but when the
questioners insisted, the Prophet got angry. He then said to the people,
"Ask me anything you like." A man asked, "Who is my father?" The Prophet
replied, "Your father is Hudhafa." Then another man got up and said,
"Who is my father, O Allah's Apostle ?" He replied, "Your father is
Salim, Maula (the freed slave) of Shaiba." So when 'Umar saw that (the
anger) on the face of the Prophet he said, "O Allah's Apostle! We repent
to Allah (Our offending you)."
