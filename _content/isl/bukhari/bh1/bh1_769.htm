Abu Qilaba said, "Malik bin Huwairith used to demonstrate to us the 
prayer of the Prophet at times other than that of the compulsory 
prayers. So (once) he stood up for prayer and performed a perfect 
Qiyam (standing and reciting from the Holy Qur'an) and then bowed and 
performed bowing perfectly; then he raised his head and stood straight
for a while." Abu Qilaba added, "Malik bin Huwairith in that 
demonstration prayed like this Sheikh of ours, Abu Yazid." Abu, Yazid 
used to sit (for a while) on raising his head from the second 
prostration before getting up.
