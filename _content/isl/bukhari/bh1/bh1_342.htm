<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:342</H3><P><I>Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:</I></P>
I was with 'Abdullah and Abu Musa; the latter asked the former, "O Abu
AbdurRahman! What is your opinion if somebody becomes Junub and no 
water is available?" 'Abdullah replied, "Do not pray till water is 
found." Abu Musa said, "What do you say about the statement of 'Ammar 
(who was ordered by the Prophet to perform Tayammum). The Prophet said
to him: "Perform Tayammum and that would be sufficient." 'Abdullah 
replied, "Don't you see that 'Umar was not satisfied by 'Ammar's 
statement?" Abu- Musa said, "All right, leave 'Ammalr's statement, but
what will you say about this verse (of Tayammum)?" 'Abqiullah kept 
quiet and then said, "If we allowed it, then they would probably 
perform Tayammum even if water was available, if one of them found it 
(water) cold." The narrator added, "I said to Shaqrq, "Then did 
'Abdullah dislike to perform Tayammum because of this?" He replied, 
"Yes."
