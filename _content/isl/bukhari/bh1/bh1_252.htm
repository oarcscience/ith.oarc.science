While I and my father were with Jabir bin 'Abdullah, some People asked
him about taking a bath He replied, "A Sa' of water is sufficient for

was sufficient for one who had more hair than you and was better than 
you (meaning the Prophet)." And then Jabir (put on) his garment and 
led the prayer.
