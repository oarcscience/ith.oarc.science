<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:373</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Juhaifa:</I></P>
I saw Allah's Apostle in a red leather tent and I saw Bilal taking the
remaining water with which the Prophet had performed ablution. I saw 
the people taking the utilized water impatiently and whoever got some 
of it rubbed it on his body and those who could not get any took the 
moisture from the others' hands. Then I saw Bilal carrying an 'Anza (a
spear-headed stick) which he planted in the ground. The Prophet came 
out tucking up his red cloak, and led the people in prayer and offered
two Rakat (facing the Ka'ba) taking 'Anza as a Sutra for his prayer. I
saw the people and animals passing in front of him beyond the 'Anza.
