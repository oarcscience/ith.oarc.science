### Hadith 1:433

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

I saw seventy of As-Suffa men and none of them had a Rida' (a garment
covering the upper part of the body). They had either Izars (only) or
sheets which they tied round their necks. Some of these sheets reached

gather them with their hands lest their private parts should become
naked.
