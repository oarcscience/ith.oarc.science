<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:185</H3><P><I>Narrated Yahya Al-Mazini:</I></P>
A person asked 'Abdullah bin Zaid who was the grandfather of 'Amr bin 
Yahya, "Can you show me how Allah's Apostle used to perform ablution?"
'Abdullah bin Zaid replied in the affirmative and asked for water. He 
poured it on his hands and washed them twice, then he rinsed his mouth
thrice and washed his nose with water thrice by putting water in it 
and blowing it out. He washed his face thrice and after that he washed
his forearms up to the elbows twice and then passed his wet hands over
his head from its front to its back and vice versa (beginning from the
front and taking them to the back of his head up to the nape of the 
neck and then brought them to the front again from where he had 
started) and washed his feet (up to the ankles).
