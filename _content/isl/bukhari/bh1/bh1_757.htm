<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:755</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Ikrima:</I></P>
I prayed behind a Sheikh at Mecca and he said twenty two Takbirs 
(during the prayer). I told Ibn 'Abbas that he (i.e. that Sheikh) was 
foolish. Ibn 'Abbas admonished me and said, "This is the tradition of 
Abu-l-Qasim." And narrated Abu Huraira: Whenever Allah's Apostle stood
for the prayer, he said Takbir on starting the prayer and then on 
bowing. On rising from bowing he said, "Sami' a-l-lahu liman hamida," 
and then while standing straight he used to say, "Rabbana laka-l hamd"
(Al-Laith said, "(The Prophet said), 'Walaka-l-hamd'." He used to say 
Takbir on prostrating and on raising his head from prostration; again 
he would Say Takbir on prostrating and raising his head. He would then
do the same in the whole of the prayer till it was completed. On 
rising from the second Rak'a (after sitting for At-Tahiyyat), he used 
to say Takbir.
