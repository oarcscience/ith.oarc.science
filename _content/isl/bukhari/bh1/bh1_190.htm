<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:190</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amr bin Yahya:</I></P>
(on the authority of his father) 'Abdullah bin Zaid poured water on 
his hands from a utensil containing water and washed them and then 
with one handful of water he rinsed his mouth and cleaned his nose by 
putting water in it and then blowing it out. He repeated it thrice. 
He, then, washed his hands and forearms up to the elbows twice and 
passed wet hands over his head, both forwards and backwards, and 
washed his feet up to the ankles and said, "This is the ablution of 
Allah's Apostle."
