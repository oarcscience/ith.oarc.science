Whenever Allah's Apostle finished his prayers with Taslim, the women 
would get up and he would stay on for a while in his place before 
getting up. Ibn Shihab said, "I think (and Allah knows better), that 
the purpose of his stay was that the women might leave before the men 
who had finished their prayer. "
