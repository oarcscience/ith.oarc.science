I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "If Allah wants to do good to a 
person, He makes him comprehend the religion. I am just a distributor,
but the grant is from Allah. (And remember) that this nation (true 
Muslims) will keep on following Allah's teachings strictly and they 
will not be harmed by any one going on a different path till Allah's 
order (Day of Judgment) is established."
