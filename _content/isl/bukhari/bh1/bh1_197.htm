<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:197</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
When the ailment of the Prophet became aggravated and his disease 
became severe, he asked his wives to permit him to be nursed (treated)
in my house. So they gave him the permission. Then the Prophet came 
(to my house) with the support of two men, and his legs were dragging 
on the ground, between 'Abbas, and another man." 'Ubaid-Ullah (the sub
narrator) said, "I informed 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas of what'Aisha said. 
Ibn 'Abbas said: 'Do you know who was the other man?' I replied in the
negative. Ibn 'Abbas said, 'He was 'Ali (bin Abi Talib)." 'Aisha 
further said, "When the Prophet came to my house and his sickness 
became aggravated he ordered us to pour seven skins full of water on 
him, so that he might give some advice to the people. So he was seated
in a Mikhdab (brass tub) belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet. 
Then, all of us started pouring water on him from the water skins till
he beckoned to us to stop and that we have done (what he wanted us to 
do). After that he went out to the people."
