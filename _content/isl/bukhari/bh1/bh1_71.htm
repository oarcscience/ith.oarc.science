<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:72</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
We were with the Prophet and a spadix of date-palm tree was brought to
him. On that he said, "Amongst the trees, there is a tree which 
resembles a Muslim." I wanted to say that it was the date-palm tree 
but as I was the youngest of all (of them) I kept quiet. And then the 
Prophet said, "It is the date-palm tree."
