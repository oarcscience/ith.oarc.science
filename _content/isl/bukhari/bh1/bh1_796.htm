'Abdullah said, "Whenever we prayed behind the Prophet we used to 
recite (in sitting) 'Peace be on Gabriel, Michael, peace be on so and 
so. Once Allah's Apostle looked back at us and said, 'Allah Himself is
As-Salam (Peace), and if anyone of you prays then he should say, 
At-Tahiyatu lil-lahi wassalawatu wat-taiyibatu. AsSalamu 'alalika 
aiyuha-n-Nabiyu wa rahmatu-l-lahi wa barakatuhu. As-Salam alaina wa 
ala ibadil-lah is-salihin. (All the compliments, prayers and good 
things are due to Allah: peace be on you, O Prophet and Allah's mercy 
and blessings be on you. Peace be on us an on the true pious slaves of
Allah). (If you say that, it will be for all the slaves in the heaven 
and the earth). Ash-hadu an la-ilaha illa-l-lahu wa ash-hadu anna 
Muhammadan 'abduhu wa Rasuluhu. (I testify that none has the right to 
be worshipped but Allah and I also testify that Muhammad is His slave 
and His Apostle)."
