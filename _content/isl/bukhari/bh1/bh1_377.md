### Hadith 1:377

*Narrated Ishaq:*

Anas bin Malik said, "My grand-mother Mulaika invited Allah's Apostle
for a meal which she herself had prepared. He ate from it and said, 'Get
up! I will lead you in the prayer.' " Anas added, "I took my Hasir,
washed it with water as it had become dark because of long use and
Allah's Apostle stood on it. The orphan (Damira or Ruh) and I aligned
behind him and the old lady (Mulaika) stood behind us. Allah's Apostle
led us in the prayer and offered two Rak'at and then left."
