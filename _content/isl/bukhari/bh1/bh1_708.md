### Hadith 1:706

*Narrated Nafi':*

Whenever Ibn 'Umar started the prayer with Takbir, he used to raise his
hands: whenever he bowed, he used to raise his hands (before bowing) and
also used to raise his hands on saying, "Sami a-l-lahu Liman hamida",
and he used to do the same on rising from the second Rak'a (for the 3rd
Rak'a). Ibn 'Umar said: "The Prophet used to do the same."
