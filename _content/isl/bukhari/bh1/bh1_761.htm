<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:759</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Once the Prophet entered the mosque, a man came in, offered the prayer
and greeted the Prophet. The Prophet returned his greeting and said to
him, "Go back and pray again for you have not prayed." The man offered
the prayer again, came back and greeted the Prophet. He said to him 
thrice, "Go back and pray again for you have not prayed." The man 
said, "By Him Who has sent you with the truth! I do not know a better 
way of praying. Kindly teach Me how to pray." He said, "When you stand
for the prayer, say Takbir and then recite from the Qur'an what you 
know and then bow with calmness till you feel at ease, then rise from 
bowing till you stand straight. Afterwards prostrate calmly till you 
feel at ease and then raise (your head) and sit with Calmness till you
feel at ease and then prostrate with calmness till you feel at ease in
prostration and do the same in the whole of your prayer."
