We were in the company of the Prophet on a journey and the Mu'adhdhin 
wanted to pronounce the Adhan for the (Zuhr) prayer. The Prophet said 
to him, "Let it become cooler." Then he again wanted to pronounce the 
Adhan but the Prophet; said to him, "Let it become cooler." The 
Mu'adh-dhin again wanted to pronounce the Adhan for the prayer but the
Prophet said, "Let it become cooler," till the shadows of the hillocks
become equal to their sizes. The Prophet added, "The severity of the 
heat is from the raging of Hell."
