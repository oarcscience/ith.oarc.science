<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:395</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Umar (bin Al-Khattab):</I></P>
My Lord agreed with me in three things:
<P>
1. I said,"O Allah's Apostle, I wish we took the station of Abraham as
our praying place (for some of our prayers). So came the Divine 
Inspiration: And take you (people) the station of Abraham as a place 
of prayer (for some of your prayers e.g. two Rakat of Tawaf of 
Ka'ba)". (2.125)
<P>
2. And as regards the (verse of) the veiling of the women, I said, 'O 
Allah's Apostle! I wish you ordered your wives to cover themselves 
from the men because good and bad ones talk to them.' So the verse of 
the veiling of the women was revealed.
<P>
3. Once the wives of the Prophet made a united front against the 
Prophet and I said to them, 'It may be if he (the Prophet) divorced 
you, (all) that his Lord (Allah) will give him instead of you wives 
better than you.' So this verse (the same as I had said) was 
revealed." (66.5).
