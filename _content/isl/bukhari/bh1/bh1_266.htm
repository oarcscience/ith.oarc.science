<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:266</H3><P><I>Narrated Maimuna bint Al-Harith:</I></P>
I placed water for the bath of Allah's Apostle and put a screen. He 
poured water over his hands, and washed them once or twice. (The 
subnarrator added that he did not remember if she had said thrice or 
not). Then he poured water with his right hand over his left one and 
washed his private parts. He rubbed his hand over the earth or the 
wall and washed it. He rinsed his mouth and washed his nose by putting
water in it and blowing it out. He washed his face, forearms and head.
He poured water over his body and then withdrew from that place and 
washed his feet. I presented him a piece of cloth (towel) and he 
pointed with his hand (that he does not want it) and did not take it.
