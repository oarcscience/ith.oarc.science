<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:186</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amr:</I></P>
My father saw 'Amr bin Abi Hasan asking 'Abdullah bin Zaid about the 
ablution of the Prophet. 'Abdullah bin Zaid asked for earthen-ware pot
containing water and in front of them performed ablution like that of 
the Prophet . He poured water from the pot over his hand and washed 
his hands thrice and then he put his hands in the pot and rinsed his 
mouth and washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it 
out with three handfuls of water. Again he put his hand in the water 
and washed his face thrice and washed his forearms up to the elbows 
twice; and then put his hands in the water and then passed them over 
his head by bringing them to the front and then to the rear of the 
head once, and then he washed his feet up to the ankles.
