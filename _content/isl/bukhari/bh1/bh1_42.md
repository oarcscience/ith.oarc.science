### Hadith 1:43

*Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:*

Once a Jew said to me, "O the chief of believers! There is a verse in
your Holy Book Which is read by all of you (Muslims), and had it been
revealed to us, we would have taken that day (on which it was revealed
as a day of celebration." 'Umar bin Al-Khattab asked, "Which is that
verse?" The Jew replied, "This day I have perfected your religion For
you, completed My favor upon you, And have chosen for you Islam as your
religion." (5:3) 'Umar replied,"No doubt, we know when and where this
verse was revealed to the Prophet. It was Friday and the Prophet was
standing at 'Arafat (i.e. the Day of Hajj)"
