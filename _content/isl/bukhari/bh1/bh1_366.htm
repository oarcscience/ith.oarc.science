I went to Jabir bin 'Abdullah and he was praying wrapped in a garment 
and his Rida was Lying beside him. When he finished the prayers, I 
said "O 'Abdullah! You pray (in a single garment) while your Rida' is 
lying beside you." He replied, "Yes, I did it intentionally so that 
the ignorant ones like you might see me. I saw the Prophet praying 
like this. "
