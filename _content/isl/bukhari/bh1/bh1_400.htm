The Prophet saw some sputum in the direction of the Qibla (on the wall
of the mosque) and he disliked that and the sign of disgust was 
apparent from his face. So he got up and scraped it off with his hand 
and said, "Whenever anyone of you stands for the prayer, he is 
speaking in private to his Lord or his Lord is between him and his 
Qibla. So, none of you should spit in the direction of the Qibla but 
one can spit to the left or under his foot." The Prophet then took the
corner of his sheet and spat in it and folded it and said, "Or you can
do like this. "
