### Hadith 1:665

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

Once I passed the night in the house of my aunt Maimuna. Allah's Apostle
offered the 'Isha' prayer and then came to the house and offered four
Rakat an slept. Later on, he woke up and stood for the prayer and I
stood on his left side. He drew me to his right and prayed five Rakat
and then two. He then slept till I heard him snoring (or heard his
breath sounds). Afterwards he went out for the morning prayer.
