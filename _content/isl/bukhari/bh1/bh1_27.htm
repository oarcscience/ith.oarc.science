<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:28</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
The Prophet said: "I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of 
its dwellers were women who were ungrateful." It was asked, "Do they 
disbelieve in Allah?" (or are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied, 
"They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the 
favors and the good (charitable deeds) done to them. If you have 
always been good (benevolent) to one of them and then she sees 
something in you (not of her liking), she will say, 'I have never 
received any good from you."
