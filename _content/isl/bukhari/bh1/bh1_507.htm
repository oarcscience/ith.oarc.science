<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:505</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah:</I></P>
I asked the Prophet "Which deed is the dearest to Allah?" He replied, 
"To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times." I asked, 
"What is the next (in goodness)?" He replied, "To be good and dutiful 
to your parents" I again asked, "What is the next (in goodness)?" He 
replied, 'To participate in Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah's 
cause." 'Abdullah added, "I asked only that much and if I had asked 
more, the Prophet would have told me more."
