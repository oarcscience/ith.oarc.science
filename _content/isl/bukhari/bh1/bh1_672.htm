<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:670</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Mas'ud:</I></P>
A man came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! By Allah, I keep away from 
the morning prayer only because So and so prolongs the prayer when he 
leads us in it." The narrator said, "I never saw Allah's Apostle more 
furious in giving advice than he was at that time. He then said, "Some
of you make people dislike good deeds (the prayer). So whoever among 
you leads the people in prayer should shorten it because among them 
are the weak, the old and the needy."
