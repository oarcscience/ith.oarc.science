<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:818</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
One night I slept at the house of my aunt Maimuna and the Prophet 
slept (too). He got up (for prayer) in the last hours of the night and
performed a light ablution from a hanging leather skin. ('Amr, the 
sub-narrator described that the ablution was very light). Then he 
stood up for prayer and I got up too and performed the ablution in the
same way and joined him on his left side. He pulled me to the right 
and prayed as much as Allah will. Then he lay down and slept and I 
heard his breath sounds till the Mu'adh-dhin came to him to inform him
about the (Fajr) prayer. He left with him for the prayer and prayed 
without repeating the ablution. (Sufyan the subnarrator said: We said 
to 'Amr, "Some people say, 'The eyes of the Prophet sleep but his 
heart never sleeps.' " 'Amr said, "'Ubai bin 'Umar said, 'The dreams 
of the Prophets are Divine Inspirations. Then he recited, '(O my son),
I have seen in dream that I was slaughtering you (offering you in 
sacrifice).") (37.102)
