<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:340</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Imran:</I></P>
Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling 
till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and 
slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in 
the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that 
made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and
so and then so and so (the narrator 'Auf said that Abu Raja' had told 
him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to 
wake up was 'Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to 
sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to get up as we 
did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. 
So, 'Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a 
strict man, so he said, "Allahu Akbar" and raised his voice with 
Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of 
it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to
them. He said, "There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!"
So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the
Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So 
he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced 
and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he
saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, 
"O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?" He 
replied, "I am Junub and there is no water. " The Prophet said, 
"Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you."
<P>
Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of 
thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator 'Auf 
added that Abu Raja' had named him but he had forgotten) and 'Ali, and
ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water 
and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of 
water. They asked, "Where can we find water?" She replied, "I was 
there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are 
behind me." They requested her to accompany them. She asked, "Where?" 
They said, "To Allah's Apostle ." She said, "Do you mean the man who 
is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?" They replied, "Yes, the 
same person. So come along." They brought her to the Prophet and 
narrated the whole story. He said, "Help her to dismount." The Prophet
asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some
water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and 
opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and 
water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) 
all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of 
all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub 
and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and 
watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when
her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full
(of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah's Apostle) Then
the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour 
and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in
a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth 
full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the 
Prophet said to her, "We have not taken your water but Allah has given
water to us." She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: "O so 
and so what has delayed you?" She said, "A strange thing! Two men met 
me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi' and he did such and 
such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between 
this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising 
them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is 
Allah's true Apostle."
<P>
Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but 
never touched her village. One day she said to her people, "I think 
that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to
Islam?" They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.
<P>
Abu 'Abdultah said: The word Saba'a means "The one who has deserted 
his old religion and embraced a new religion." Abul 'Ailya said, "The 
Sabis are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of 
Psalms."
