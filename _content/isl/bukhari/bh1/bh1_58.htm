<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:59</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Amongst the trees, there is a tree, the leaves of 
which do not fall and is like a Muslim. Tell me the name of that 
tree." Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert areas.
And I thought of the date-palm tree. The others then asked, "Please 
inform us what is that tree, O Allah's Apostle?" He replied, "It is 
the date-palm tree."
