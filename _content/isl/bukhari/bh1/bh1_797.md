### Hadith 1:795

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

(the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle used to invoke Allah in the
prayer saying "Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min adhabil-qabri, wa a'udhu
bika min fitnatil-masihid-dajjal, wa a'udhu bika min fitnatil-mahya wa
fitnatil-mamati. Allahumma inni a'udhu bika minal-ma thami wal-maghrami.
(O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of the grave and
from the afflictions of Masi,h Ad-Dajjal and from the afflictions of
life and death. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the sins and from
being in debt)." Somebody said to him, "Why do you so frequently seek
refuge with Allah from being in debt?" The Prophet replied, "A person in
debt tells lies whenever he speaks, and breaks promises whenever he
makes (them)." 'Aisha also narrated: I heard Allah's Apostle in his
prayer seeking refuge with Allah from the afflictions of Ad-dajjal.
