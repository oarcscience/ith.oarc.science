<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:361</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
A man stood up and asked the Prophet about praying in a single 
garment. The Prophet said, "Has every one of you two garments?" A man 
put a similar question to 'Umar on which he replied, "When Allah makes
you wealthier then you should clothe yourself properly during prayers.
Otherwise one can pray with an Izar and a Rida' (a sheet covering the 
upper part of the body.) Izar and a shirt, Izar and a Qaba', trousers 
and a Rida, trousers and a shirt or trousers and a Qaba', Tubban and a
Qaba' or Tubban and a shirt." (The narrator added, "I think that he 
also said a Tubban and a Rida. ")
