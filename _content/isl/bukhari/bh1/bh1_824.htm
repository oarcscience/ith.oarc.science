A person asked Ibn Abbas, "Have you ever presented yourself at the 
('Id) prayer with Allah's Apostle?" He replied, "Yes." And had it not 
been for my kinship (position) with the Prophet it would not have been
possible for me to do so (for he was too young). The Prophet went to 
the mark near the house of Kathir bin As-Salt and delivered a sermon. 
He then went towards the women. He advised and reminded them and asked
them to give alms. So the woman would bring her hand near her neck and
take off her necklace and put it in the garment of Bilal. Then the 
Prophet and Bilal came to the house."
