### Hadith 1:127

*Narrated 'Abdullah:*

While I was going with the Prophet through the ruins of Medina and he
was reclining on a date-palm leaf stalk, some Jews passed by. Some of
them said to the others: Ask him (the Prophet) about the spirit. Some of
them said that they should not ask him that question as he might give a
reply which would displease them. But some of them insisted on asking,
and so one of them stood up and asked, "O Aba-l-Qasim ! What is the
spirit?" The Prophet remained quiet. I thought he was being inspired
Divinely. So I stayed till that state of the Prophet (while being
inspired) was over. The Prophet then said, "And they ask you (O
Muhammad) concerning the spirit --Say: The spirit -- its knowledge is
with my Lord. And of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a
little)." (17.85)
