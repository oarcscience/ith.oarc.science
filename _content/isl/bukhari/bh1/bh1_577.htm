<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:575</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</I></P>
The Prophet prayed one of the'lsha' prayer in his last days and after 
finishing it with Taslim, he stood up and said, "Do you realize (the 
importance of) this night? Nobody present on the
<P>
surface of the earth to-night would be living after the completion of 
one hundred years from this night."
<P>
The people made a mistake in grasping the meaning of this statement of
Allah's Apostle and they indulged in those things which are said about
these narrators (i.e. some said that the Day of Resurrection will be 
established after 100 years etc.) But the Prophet said, "Nobody 
present on the surface of earth tonight would be living after the 
completion of 100 years from this night"; he meant "When that century 
(people of that century) would pass away."
