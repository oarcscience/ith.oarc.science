Allah's Apostle sent for a Ansari man who came with water dropping 
from his head. The Prophet said, "Perhaps we have forced you to hurry 
up, haven't we?" The Ansari replied, "Yes." Allah's Apostle further 
said, "If you are forced to hurry up (during intercourse) or you do 
not discharge then ablution is due on you (This order was cancelled 
later on, i.e. one has to take a bath).
