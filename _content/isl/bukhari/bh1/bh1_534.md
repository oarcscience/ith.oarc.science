### Hadith 1:532

*Narrated Salim bin 'Abdullah:*

My father said, "I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'The period of your
stay as compared to the previous nations is like the period equal to the
time between the 'Asr prayer and sunset. The people of the Torah were
given the Torah and they acted (upon it) till mid-day then they were
exhausted and were given one Qirat (of gold) each. And then the people
of the Gospel were given the Gospel and they acted (upon it) till the
'Asr prayer then they were exhausted and were! given one Qirat each. And
then we were given the Qur'an and we acted (upon it) till sunset and we
were given two Qirats each. On that the people of both the scriptures
said, 'O our Lord! You have given them two Qirats and given us one
Qirat, though we have worked more than they.' Allah said, 'Have I
usurped some of your right?' They said, 'No.' Allah said: "That is my
blessing I bestow upon whomsoever I wish."
