### Hadith 1:427

*Narrated 'Aisha and 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:*

When the last moment of the life of Allah's Apostle came he started
putting his 'Khamisa' on his face and when he felt hot and short of
breath he took it off his face and said, "May Allah curse the Jews and
Christians for they built the places of worship at the graves of their
Prophets." The Prophet was warning (Muslims) of what those had done.

[Next: 1:428: Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, May Allah's curse be on
the Jews for they built...](bh1_429)
