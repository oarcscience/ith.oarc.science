Once'Umar bin 'Abdul 'Aziz delayed the prayer and 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair 
went to him and said, "Once in 'Iraq, Al-MughTra bin Shu'ba delayed 
his prayers and Abi Mas'ud Al-Ansari went to him and said, 'O Mughira!
What is this? Don't you know that once Gabriel came and offered the 
prayer (Fajr prayer) and Allah's Apostle prayed too, then he prayed 
again (Zuhr prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and again he prayed 
('Asr prayers and Allah's Apostle did the same; again he prayed 
(Maghrib-prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and again prayed ('Isha 
prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and (Gabriel) said, 'I was ordered 
to do so (to demonstrate the prayers prescribed to you)?'" 'Umar (bin 
'Abdul 'AzTz) said to 'Urwa, "Be sure of what you Say. Did Gabriel 
lead Allah's Apostle at the stated times of the prayers?" 'Urwa 
replied, "Bashir bin Abi Mas'ud narrated like this on the authority of
his father." Urwa added, "Aisha told me that Allah's Apostle used to 
pray 'Asr prayer when the sun-shine was still inside her residence 
(during the early time of 'Asr)."
