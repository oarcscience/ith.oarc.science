### Hadith 1:724

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle entered the mosque and a person followed him. The man
prayed and went to the Prophet and greeted him. The Prophet returned the
greeting and said to him, "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed."
The man went back prayed in the same way as before, returned and greeted
the Prophet who said, "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed." This
happened thrice. The man said, "By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I
cannot offer the prayer in a better way than this. Please, teach me how
to pray." The Prophet said, "When you stand for Prayer say Takbir and
then recite from the Holy Qur'an (of what you know by heart) and then
bow till you feel at ease. Then raise your head and stand up straight,
then prostrate till you feel at ease during your prostration, then sit
with calmness till you feel at ease (do not hurry) and do the same in
all your prayers
