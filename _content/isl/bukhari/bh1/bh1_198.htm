<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:198</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amr bin Yahya:</I></P>
(on the authority of his father) My uncle used to perform ablution 
extravagantly and once he asked 'Abdullah bin Zaid to tell him how he 
had seen the Prophet performing ablution. He asked for an earthen-ware
pot containing water, and poured water from it on his hands and washed
them thrice, and then put his hand in the earthen-ware pot and rinsed 
his mouth and washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing 
it Out thrice with one handful of water; he again put his hand in the 
water and took a handful of water and washed his face thrice, then 
washed his hands up to the elbows twice, and took water with his hand,
and passed it over his head from front to back and then from back to 
front, and then washed his feet (up to the ankles) and said, "I saw 
the Prophet performing ablution in that way."
