Aisha said, "I borrowed a necklace from Asma' and it was lost. So 
Allah's Apostle sent a man to search for it and he found it. Then the 
time of the prayer became due and there was no water. They prayed 
(without ablution) and informed Allah's Apostle about it, so the verse
of Tayammum was revealed." Usaid bin Hudair said to 'Aisha, "May Allah
reward you. By Allah, whenever anything happened which you did not 
like, Allah brought good for you and for the Muslims in that."
<P>
Al-Jurf and the time for the 'Asr prayer became due while he was at 
Marbad-AnNa'am (sheep-fold), so he (performed Tayammum) and prayed 
there and then entered Medina when the sun was still high but he did 
not repeat that prayer.
