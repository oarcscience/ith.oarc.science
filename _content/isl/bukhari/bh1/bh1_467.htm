<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:465</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
(the wife of the Prophet) I had seen my parents following Islam since 
I attained the age of puberty. Not a day passed but the Prophet 
visited us, both in the mornings and evenings. My father Abii Bakr 
thought of building a mosque in the courtyard of his house and he did 
so. He used to pray and recite the Qur'an in it. The pagan women and 
their children used to stand by him and look at him with surprise. Abu
Bakr was a Softhearted person and could not help weeping while 
reciting the Quran. The chiefs of the Quraish pagans became afraid of 
that (i.e. that their children and women might be affected by the 
recitation of Quran)."
