Once a Jew said to me, "O the chief of believers! There is a verse in 
your Holy Book Which is read by all of you (Muslims), and had it been 
revealed to us, we would have taken that day (on which it was revealed
as a day of celebration." 'Umar bin Al-Khattab asked, "Which is that 
verse?" The Jew replied, "This day I have perfected your religion For 
you, completed My favor upon you, And have chosen for you Islam as 
your religion." (5:3) 'Umar replied,"No doubt, we know when and where 
this verse was revealed to the Prophet. It was Friday and the Prophet 
was standing at 'Arafat (i.e. the Day of Hajj)"
