Allah's Apostle prayed facing Baitul-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen 
months but he loved to face the Ka'ba (at Mecca) so Allah revealed: 
"Verily, We have seen the turning of your face to the heaven!" (2:144)
So the Prophet faced the Ka'ba and the fools amongst the people namely
"the Jews" said, "What has turned them from their Qibla 
(Bait-ul-Maqdis) which they formerly observed"" (Allah revealed): 
"Say: 'To Allah belongs the East and the West. He guides whom he will 
to a straight path'." (2:142) A man prayed with the Prophet (facing 
the Ka'ba) and went out. He saw some of the Ansar praying the 'Asr 
prayer with their faces towards Bait-ul-Maqdis, he said, "I bear 
witness that I prayed with Allah's Apostle facing the Ka'ba." So all 
the people turned their faces towards the Ka'ba.
