### Hadith 1:46

*Narrated 'Abdullah:*

The Prophet said, "Abusing a Muslim is Fusuq (an evil doing) and
"Allah's Apostle went out to inform the people about the (date of the)
night of decree (Al-Qadr) but there happened a quarrel between two
Muslim men. The Prophet said, "I came out to inform you about (the date
of) the night of Al-Qadr, but as so and so and so and so quarrelled, its
knowledge was taken away (I forgot it) and maybe it was better for you.
Now look for it in the 7th, the 9th and the 5th (of the last 10 nights
of the month of Ramadan)."
