<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:295</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Urwa:</I></P>
A person asked me, "Can a woman in menses serve me? And can a Junub 
woman come close to me?" I replied, "All this is easy for me. All of 
them can serve me, and there is no harm for any other person to do the
same. 'Aisha told me that she used to comb the hair of Allah's Apostle
while she was in her menses, and he was in Itikaf (in the mosque). He 
would bring his head near her in her room and she would comb his hair,
while she used to be in her menses."
