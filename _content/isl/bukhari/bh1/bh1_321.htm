Hafsa said, 'We used to forbid our young women to go out for the two 
'Id prayers. A woman came and stayed at the palace of Bani Khalaf and 
she narrated about her sister whose husband took part in twelve holy 
battles along with the Prophet and her sister was with her husband in 
six (out of these twelve). She (the woman's sister) said, "We used to 
treat the wounded, look after the patients and once I asked the 
Prophet, 'Is there any harm for any of us to stay at home if she 
doesn't have a veil?' He said, 'She should cover herself with the veil
of her companion and should participate in the good deeds and in the 
religious gathering of the Muslims.' When Um 'Atiya came I asked her 
whether she had heard it from the Prophet. She replied, "Yes. May my 
father be sacrificed for him (the Prophet)! (Whenever she mentioned 
the Prophet she used to say, 'May my father be sacrificed for him) I 
have heard the Prophet saying, 'The unmarried young virgins and the 
mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who
often stay screened and the menstruating women should come out and 
participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of 
the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away 
from the Musalla (praying place).' " Hafsa asked Um 'Atiya 
surprisingly, "Do you say the menstruating women?" She replied, 
"Doesn't a menstruating woman attend 'Arafat (Hajj) and such and such 
(other deeds)?"
