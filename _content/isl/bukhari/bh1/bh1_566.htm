<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:564</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
By Allah, Who took away the Prophet. The Prophet never missed them 
(two Rakat) after the 'Asr prayer till he met Allah and he did not 
meet Allah till it became heavy for him to pray while standing so he 
used to offer most of the prayers while sitting. (She meant the two 
Rakat after Asr) He used to pray them in the house and never prayed 
them in the mosque lest it might be hard for his followers and he 
loved what was easy for them .
