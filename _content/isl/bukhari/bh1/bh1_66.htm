Once the Prophet was riding his camel and a man was holding its rein. 
The Prophet asked, "What is the day today?" We kept quiet, thinking 
that he might give that day another name. He said, "Isn't it the day 
of Nahr (slaughtering of the animals of sacrifice)" We replied, "Yes."
He further asked, "Which month is this?" We again kept quiet, thinking
that he might give it another name. Then he said, "Isn't it the month 
of Dhul-Hijja?" We replied, "Yes." He said, "Verily! Your blood, 
property and honor are sacred to one another (i.e. Muslims) like the 
sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and in this city
of yours. It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those 
who are absent because those who are absent might comprehend (what I 
have said) better than the present audience."
