<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:58</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Amongst the trees, there is a tree, the leaves 
of which do not fall and is like a Muslim. Tell me the name of that 
tree." Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert areas.
And I thought of the date-palm tree but felt shy to answer the others 
then asked, "What is that tree, O Allah's Apostle ?" He replied, "It 
is the date-palm true."
