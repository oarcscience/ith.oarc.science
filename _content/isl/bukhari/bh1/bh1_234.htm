<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:234</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Qilaba:</I></P>
Anas said, "Some people of 'Ukl or 'Uraina tribe came to Medina and 
its climate did not suit them. So the Prophet ordered them to go to 
the herd of (Milch) camels and to drink their milk and urine (as a 
medicine). So they went as directed and after they became healthy, 
they killed the shepherd of the Prophet and drove away all the camels.
The news reached the Prophet early in the morning and he sent (men) in
their pursuit and they were captured and brought at noon. He then 
ordered to cut their hands and feet (and it was done), and their eyes 
were branded with heated pieces of iron, They were put in 'Al-Harra' 
and when they asked for water, no water was given to them." Abu Qilaba
said, "Those people committed theft and murder, became infidels after 
embracing Islam and fought against Allah and His Apostle ."
