### Hadith 1:2

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

(the mother of the faithful believers) Al-Harith bin Hisham asked
Allah's Apostle "O Allah's Apostle! How is the Divine Inspiration
revealed to you?" Allah's Apostle replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed)
like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of
all and then this state passes ' off after I have grasped what is
inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me
and I grasp whatever he says." 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the Prophet
being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the Sweat
dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).
