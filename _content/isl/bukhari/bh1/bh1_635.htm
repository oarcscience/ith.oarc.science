"We were with 'Aisha discussing the regularity of offering the prayer 
and dignifying it. She said, 'When Allah's Apostle fell sick with the 
fatal illness and when the time of prayer became due and Adhan was 
pronounced, he said, 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.' He 
was told that Abu Bakr was a soft-hearted man and would not be able to
lead the prayer in his place. The Prophet gave the same order again 
but he was given the same reply. He gave the order for the third time 
and said, 'You (women) are the companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to 
lead the prayer.' So Abu Bakr came out to lead the prayer. In the 
meantime the condition of the Prophet improved a bit and he came out 
with the help of two men one on each side. As if I was observing his 
legs dragging on the ground owing to the disease. Abu Bakr wanted to 
retreat but the Prophet beckoned him to remain at his place and the 
Prophet was brought till he sat beside Abu Bakr." Al-A'mash was asked,
"Was the Prophet praying and Abu Bakr following him, and were the 
people following Abu Bakr in that prayer?" Al-A'mash replied in the 
affirmative with a nod of his head. Abu Muawiya said, "The Prophet was
sitting on the left side of Abu Bakr who was praying while standing."
