### Hadith 1:128

*Narrated Aswad:*

Ibn Az-Zubair said to me, "Aisha used to tell you secretly a number of
things. What did she tell you about the Ka'ba?" I replied, "She told me
that once the Prophet said, 'O 'Aisha! Had not your people been still
close to the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (infidelity)! I would have
dismantled the Ka'ba and would have made two doors in it; one for
entrance and the other for exit." Later on Ibn Az-Zubair did the same.
