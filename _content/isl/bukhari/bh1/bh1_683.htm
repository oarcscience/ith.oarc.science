When Allah's Apostle became seriously ill, Bilal came to him for the 
prayer. He said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer." I 
said, "O Allah's Apostle! Abu Bakr is a soft-hearted man and if he 
stands in your place, he would not be able to make the people hear 
him. Will you order 'Umar (to lead the prayer)?" The Prophet said, 
"Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer." Then I said to 
Hafsa, "Tell him, Abu i Bakr is a soft-hearted man and if he stands in
his place, he would not be able to make the people hear him. Would you
order 'Umar to lead the prayer?' " Hafsa did so. The Prophet said, 
"Verily you are the companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the 
people in the prayer." So Abu- Bakr stood for the prayer. In the 
meantime Allah's Apostle felt better and came out with the help of two
persons and both of his legs were dragging on the ground till he 
entered the mosque. When Abu Bakr heard him coming, he tried to 
retreat but Allah's Apostle beckoned him to carry on. The Prophet sat 
on his left side. Abu Bakr was praying while standing and Allah's 
Apostle was leading the prayer while sitting. Abu Bakr was following 
the Prophet and the people were following Abu Bakr (in the prayer).
