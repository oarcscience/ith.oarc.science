<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:265</H3><P><I>Narrated Maimuna:</I></P>
I placed water for the bath of Allah's Apostle and he poured water 
over his hands and washed them twice or thrice; then he poured water 
with his right hand over his left and washed his private parts (with 
his left hand). He rubbed his hand over the earth and rinsed his mouth
and washed his nose by putting water in it and blowing it out. After 
that he washed his face, both fore arms and head thrice and then 
poured water over his body. He withdrew from that place and washed his
feet.
