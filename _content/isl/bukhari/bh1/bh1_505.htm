that he had heard Hudhaifa saying, "Once I was sitting with 'Umar and 
he said, 'Who amongst you remembers the statement of Allah's Apostle 
about the afflictions?' I said, 'I know it as the Prophet had said 
it.' 'Umar said, 'No doubt you are bold.' I said, 'The afflictions 
caused for a man by his wife, money, children and neighbor are 
expiated by his prayers, fasting, charity and by enjoining (what is 
good) and forbidding (what is evil).' 'Umar said, 'I did not mean that
but I asked about that affliction which will spread like the waves of 
the sea.' I (Hudhaifa) said, 'O leader of the faithful believers! You 
need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and 
it.' 'Umar asked, Will the door be broken or opened?' I replied, 'It 
will be broken.' 'Umar said, 'Then it will never be closed again.' I 
was asked whether 'Umar knew that door. I replied that he knew it as 
one knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I 
narrated a Hadith that was free from any mis-statement" The 
subnarrator added that they deputed Masruq to ask Hudhaifa (about the 
door). Hudhaifa said, "The door was 'Umar himself."
