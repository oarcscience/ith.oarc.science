### Hadith 1:462

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

A man came to the Prophet while he was delivering the sermon and asked
him how to offer the night prayers. The Prophet replied, 'Pray two Rakat
at a time and then two and then two and so on and if you are afraid of
dawn (the approach of the time of the Fajr prayer) pray one Rak'a and
that will be the with for all the Rakat which you have the Prophet while
he was in the mosque.
