### Hadith 1:270

*Narrated Muhammad bin Al-Muntathir:*

on the authority of his father that he had asked 'Aisha about the saying
of Ibn 'Umar(i.e. he did not like to be a Muhrim while the smell of
scent was still coming from his body). 'Aisha said, "I scented Allah's
Apostle and he went round (had sexual intercourse with) all his wives,
and in the morning he was Muhrim (after taking a bath)."

[Next: 1:271: 'Aisha: It is as if I am just looking at the glitter of
scent in the parting ...](bh1_271)
