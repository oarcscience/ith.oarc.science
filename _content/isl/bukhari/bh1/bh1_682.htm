<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:680</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
When the Prophet, became ill in his fatal illness, Someone came to 
inform him about the prayer, and the Prophet told him to tell Abu Bakr
to lead the people in the prayer. I said, "Abu Bakr is a soft-hearted 
man and if he stands for the prayer in your place, he would weep and 
would not be able to recite the Qur'an." The Prophet said, "Tell Abu 
Bakr to lead the prayer." I said the same as before. He (repeated the 
same order and) on the third or the fourth time he said, "You are the 
companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the prayer." So Abu Bakr 
led the prayer and meanwhile the Prophet felt better and came out with
the help of two men; as if I see him just now dragging his feet on the
ground. When Abu Bakr saw him, he tried to retreat but the Prophet 
beckoned him to carry on. Abu Bakr retreated a bit and the Prophet sat
on his (left) side. Abu Bakr was repeating the Takbir (Allahu Akbar) 
of Allah's Apostle for the people to hear.
