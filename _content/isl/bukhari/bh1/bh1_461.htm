I was standing in the mosque and somebody threw a gravel at me. I 
looked and found that he was 'Umar bin Al-Khattab. He said to me, 
"Fetch those two men to me." When I did, he said to them, "Who are 
you? (Or) where do you come from?" They replied, "We are from Ta'if." 
'Umar said, "Were you from this city (Medina) I would have punished 
you for raising your voices in the mosque of Allah's Apostle
