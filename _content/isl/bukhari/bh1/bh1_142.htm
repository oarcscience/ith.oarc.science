Ibn 'Abbas performed ablution and washed his face (in the following 
way): He ladled out a handful of water, rinsed his mouth and washed 
his nose with it by putting in water and then blowing it out. He then,
took another handful (of water) and did like this (gesturing) joining 
both hands, and washed his face, took another handful of water and 
washed his right forearm. He again took another handful of water and 
washed his left forearm, and passed wet hands over his head and took 
another handful of water and poured it over his right foot (up to his 
ankles) and washed it thoroughly and similarly took another handful of
water and washed thoroughly his left foot (up to the ankles) and said,
"I saw Allah's Apostle performing ablution in this way."
