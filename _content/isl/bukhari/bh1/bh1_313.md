### Hadith 1:313

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

In the last Hajj of Allah's Apostle I assume the Ihram for Hajj along
with Allah Apostle. I was one of those who intended Tamattu' (to perform
Hajj an 'Umra) and did not take the Hadi (animal for sacrifice) with me.
I got my menses and was not clean till the night of 'Arafa I said, "O
Allah's Apostle! It is the night of the day of 'Arafat and I intended to
perform the Hajj Tamattu' with 'Umra Allah's Apostle told me to undo my
hair and comb it and to postpone the 'Umra. I did the same and completed
the Hajj. On the night of Al-Hasba (i.e. place outside Mecca where the
pilgrims go after finishing all the ceremonies Hajj at Mina) he (the
Prophet ordered 'Abdur Rahman ('Aisha's brother) to take me to At-Tan'im
to assume the lhram for'Umra in lieu of that of Hajj-atTamattu' which I
had intended to perform.
