We were with the Prophet on a full moon night. He looked at the moon 
and said, "You will certainly see your Lord as you see this moon, and 
there will be no trouble in seeing Him. So if you can avoid missing

<P>
And celebrate the praises Of Your Lord before The rising of the sun 
And before (its) setting." (50.39)
