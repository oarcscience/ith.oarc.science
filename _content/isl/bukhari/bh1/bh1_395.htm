<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:394</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah:</I></P>
The Prophet prayed (and the subnarrator Ibrahim said, "I do not know 
whether he prayed more or less than usual"), and when he had finished 
the prayers he was asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Has there been any 
change in the prayers?" He said, "What is it?' The people said, "You 
have prayed so much and so much." So the Prophet bent his legs, faced 
the Qibla and performed two prostrations (of Sahu) and finished his 
prayers with Tasiim (by turning his face to right and left saying: 
'As-Salamu'Alaikum-Warahmat-ullah'). When he turned his face to us he 
said, "If there had been anything changed in the prayer, surely I 
would have informed you but I am a human being like you and liable to 
forget like you. So if I forget remind me and if anyone of you is 
doubtful about his prayer, he should follow what he thinks to be 
correct and complete his prayer accordingly and finish it and do two 
prostrations (of Sahu)."
