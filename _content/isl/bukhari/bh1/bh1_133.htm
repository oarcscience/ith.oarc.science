<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:133</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</I></P>
Once Allah's Apostle said, "Amongst the trees there is a tree, the 
leaves of which do not fall and is like a Muslim, tell me the name of 
that tree." Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert 
areas and I thought of the date-palm tree but felt shy (to answer). 
The others asked, "O Allah's Apostle! inform us of it." He replied, 
"it is the date-palm tree." I told my father what had come to my mind 
and on that he said, "Had you said it I would have preferred it to 
such and such a thing that I might possess."
