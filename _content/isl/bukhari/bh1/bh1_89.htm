<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:90</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari:</I></P>
Once a man said to Allah's Apostle "O Allah's Apostle! I may not 
attend the (compulsory congregational) prayer because so and so (the 
Imam) prolongs the prayer when he leads us for it. The narrator added:
"I never saw the Prophet more furious in giving advice than he was on 
that day. The Prophet said, "O people! Some of you make others dislike
good deeds (the prayers). So whoever leads the people in prayer should
shorten it because among them there are the sick the weak and the 
needy (having some jobs to do)."
