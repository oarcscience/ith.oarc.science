### Hadith 1:403

*Narrated Abd Huraira and Abu Sa'id:*

Allah's Apostle saw some expectoration on the wall of the mosque; he
took gravel and scraped it off and said, "If anyone of you wanted to
spit, he should neither spit in front of him nor on his right but could
spit either on his left or under his left foot."

[Next: 1:404: Anas: The Prophet said, None of you should spit in front
or on his right ...](bh1_405)
