<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:273</H3><P><I>Narrated Maimuna:</I></P>
Water was placed for the ablution of Allah's Apostle after Janaba. He 
poured water with his right hand over his left twice or thrice and 
then washed his private parts and rubbed his hand on the earth or on a
wall twice or thrice and then rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by 
putting water in it and then blowing it out arid then washed his face 
and forearms and poured water over his head and washed his body. Then 
he shifted from that place and washed his feet. I brought a piece of 
cloth, but he did not take it and removed the traces of water from his
body with his hand."
