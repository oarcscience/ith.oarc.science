<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:637</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Al-Harith:</I></P>
Ibn Abbas addressed us on a (rainy and) muddy day and when the 
Mu'adh-dhin said, "Come for the prayer" Ibn 'Abbas ordered him to say,
"Pray in your homes." The people began to look at one another with 
surprise as if they did not like it. Ibn 'Abbas said, "It seems that 
you thought ill of it but no doubt it was done by one who was better 
than I (i.e. the Prophet). It (the prayer) is a strict order and I 
disliked to bring you out."
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas narrated the same as above but he said, "I did not like you
to make you sinful (in refraining from coming to the mosque) and to 
come (to the mosque) covered with mud up to the knees."
