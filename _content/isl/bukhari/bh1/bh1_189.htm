My aunt took me to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's Apostle! This son 
of my sister has got a disease in his legs." So he passed his hands on
my head and prayed for Allah's blessings for me; then he performed 
ablution and I drank from the remaining water. I stood behind him and 
saw the seal of Prophethood between his shoulders, and it was like the
"Zir-al-Hijla" (means the button of a small tent, but some said 'egg 
of a partridge.' etc.)
