We were forbidden to mourn for a dead person for more than three days 
except in the case of a husband for whom mourning was allowed for four
months and ten days. (During that time) we were not allowed to put 
ko,hl (Antimony eye power) in our eyes or to use perfumes or to put on
colored clothes except a dress made of 'Asb (a kind of Yemen cloth, 
very coarse and rough). We were allowed very light perfumes at the 
time of taking a bath after menses and also we were forbidden to go 
with the funeral procession .
