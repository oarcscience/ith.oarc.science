### Hadith 1:630

*Narrated Humaid:*

Anas was asked, "Did Allah's Apostle wear a ring?" He said, "Yes. Once
he delayed the 'Isha' prayer till mid-night and after the prayer, he
faced us and said, 'The people prayed and have slept and you remained in
prayer as long as you waited for it.' " Anas added, "As if I were just
now observing the glitter of his ring."
