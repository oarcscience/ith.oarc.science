<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:620</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "The reward of the prayer offered by a person in
congregation is twenty five times greater than that of the prayer 
offered in one's house or in the market (alone). And this is because 
if he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the
mosque with the sole intention of praying, then for every step he 
takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and his 
one sin is taken off (crossed out) from his accounts (of deeds). When 
he offers his prayer, the angels keep on asking Allah's Blessings and 
Allah's forgiveness for him as long as he is (staying) at his Musalla.
They say, 'O Allah! Bestow Your blessings upon him, be Merciful and 
kind to him.' And one is regarded in prayer as long as one is waiting 
for the prayer."
