Ibn Az-Zubair said to me, "Aisha used to tell you secretly a number of
things. What did she tell you about the Ka'ba?" I replied, "She told 
me that once the Prophet said, 'O 'Aisha! Had not your people been 
still close to the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (infidelity)! I 
would have dismantled the Ka'ba and would have made two doors in it; 
one for entrance and the other for exit." Later on Ibn Az-Zubair did 
the same.
