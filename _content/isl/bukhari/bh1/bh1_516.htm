<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:514</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Dhar Al-Ghifar:</I></P>
We were with the Prophet on a journey and the Mu'adhdhin (call maker 
for the prayer) wanted to pronounce the Adhan (call) for the Zuhr 
prayer. The Prophet said, 'Let it become cooler." He again (after a 
while) wanted to pronounce the Adhan but the Prophet said to him, "Let
it become cooler till we see the shadows of hillocks." The Prophet 
added, "The severity of heat is from the raging of the Hell-fire, and 
in very hot weather pray (Zuhr) when it becomes cooler."
