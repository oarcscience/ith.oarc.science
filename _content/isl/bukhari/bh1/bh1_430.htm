<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:429</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "I have been given five things which were not 
given to any amongst the Prophets before me. These are:
<P>
1. Allah made me victorious by awe (by His frightening my enemies) for
a distance of one month's journey.
<P>
2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for 
praying and a thing to perform Tayammum. Therefore my followers can 
pray wherever the time of a prayer is due.
<P>
3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me (and was not made so 
for anyone else).
<P>
4. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation exclusively but I have 
been sent 1o all mankind.
<P>
5. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of 
Resurrection.)
