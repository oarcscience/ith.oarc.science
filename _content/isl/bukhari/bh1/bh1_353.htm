<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:353</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Murra:</I></P>
(the freed slave of Um Hani) Um Hani, the daughter of Abi Talib said, 
"I went to Allah's Apostle in the year of the conquest of Mecca and 
found him taking a bath and his daughter Fatima was screening him. I 
greeted him. He asked, 'Who is she?' I replied, 'I am Um Hani bint Abi
Talib.' He said, 'Welcome! O Um Hani.' When he finished his bath he 
stood up and prayed eight Rak at while wearing a single garment 
wrapped round his body and when he finished I said, 'O Allah's Apostle
! My brother has told me that he will kill a person whom I gave 
shelter and that person is so and so the son of Hubaira.' The Prophet 
said, 'We shelter the person whom you have sheltered.' " Um Ham added,
"And that was before noon (Duha)."
