### Hadith 1:516

*Narrated Abu Al-Minhal:*

Abu Barza said, "The Prophet used to offer the Fajr (prayer) when one
could recognize the person sitting by him (after the prayer) and he used
to recite between 60 to 100 Ayat (verses) of the Qur'an. He used to

Medina and find the sun still hot. (The sub-narrator forgot what was

one third of the night or the middle of the night."
