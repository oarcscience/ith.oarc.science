<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:103</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:</I></P>
Whenever 'Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) heard anything which she did
not understand, she used to ask again till she understood it 
completely. Aisha said: "Once the Prophet said, "Whoever will be 
called to account (about his deeds on the Day of Resurrection) will 
surely be punished." I said, "Doesn't Allah say: "He surely will 
receive an easy reckoning." (84.8) The Prophet replied, "This means 
only the presentation of the accounts but whoever will be argued about
his account, will certainly be ruined."
