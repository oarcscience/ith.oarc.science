"The Prophet said, "Last night a big demon (afreet) from the Jinns 
came to me and wanted to interrupt my prayers (or said something 
similar) but Allah enabled me to overpower him. I wanted to fasten him
to one of the pillars of the mosque so that all of you could See him 
in the morning but I remembered the statement of my brother Solomon 
(as stated in Quran): My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me a kingdom 
such as shall not belong to anybody after me (38.35)." The sub 
narrator Rauh said, "He (the demon) was dismissed humiliated."
