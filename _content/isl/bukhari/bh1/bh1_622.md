### Hadith 1:620

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "The reward of the prayer offered by a person in
congregation is twenty five times greater than that of the prayer
offered in one's house or in the market (alone). And this is because if
he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the
mosque with the sole intention of praying, then for every step he takes
towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and his one sin
is taken off (crossed out) from his accounts (of deeds). When he offers
his prayer, the angels keep on asking Allah's Blessings and Allah's
forgiveness for him as long as he is (staying) at his Musalla. They say,
'O Allah! Bestow Your blessings upon him, be Merciful and kind to him.'
And one is regarded in prayer as long as one is waiting for the prayer."
