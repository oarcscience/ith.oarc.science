<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:804</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Some poor people came to the Prophet and said, "The wealthy people 
will get higher grades and will have permanent enjoyment and they pray
like us and fast as we do. They have more money by which they perform 
the Hajj, and 'Umra; fight and struggle in Allah's Cause and give in 
charity." The Prophet said, "Shall I not tell you a thing upon which 
if you acted you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? 
Nobody would overtake you and you would be better than the people 
amongst whom you live except those who would do the same. Say 
"Sub-han-al-lah", "Alhamdu-lillah" and "Allahu Akbar" thirty three 
times each after every (compulsory) prayer." We differed and some of 
us said that we should say, "Subhan-al-lah" thirty three times and 
"Alhamdu lillah" thirty three times and "Allahu Akbar" thirty four 
times. I went to the Prophet who said, "Say, "Subhan-al-lah" and 
"Alhamdu lillah" and "Allahu Akbar" all together for thirty three 
times."
