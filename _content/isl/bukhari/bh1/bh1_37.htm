The Prophet said, "Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens 
himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So 
you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and 
receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded; and gain strength 
by worshipping in the mornings, the nights." (See Fath-ul-Bari, Page 
102, Vol 1).
