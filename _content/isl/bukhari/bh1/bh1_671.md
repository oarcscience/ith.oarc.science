*Narrated 'Amr:*

Jabir bin 'Abdullah said, "Mu'adh bin Jabal used to pray with the
Prophet and then go to lead his people in prayer Once he led the 'Isha'
prayer and recited Surat "Al-Baqra." Somebody left the prayer and Mu'adh
criticized him. The news reached the Prophet and he said to Mu'adh, 'You
are putting the people to trial,' and repeated it thrice (or said
something similar) and ordered him to recite two medium Suras of
Mufassal." ('Amr said that he had forgotten the names of those Suras).
