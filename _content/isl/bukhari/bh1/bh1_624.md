### Hadith 1:622

*Narrated Salim:*

I heard Um Ad-Darda' saying, "Abu Ad-Darda' entered the house in an
angry mood. I said to him. 'What makes you angry?' He replied, 'By
Allah! I do not find the followers of Muhammad doing those good things
(which they used to do before) except the offering of congregational
prayer." (This happened in the last days of Abu Ad-Darda' during the
rule of 'Uthman) .

[Next: 1:623: Abu Musa: The Prophet said, The people who get tremendous
reward for the prayer...](bh1_625)
