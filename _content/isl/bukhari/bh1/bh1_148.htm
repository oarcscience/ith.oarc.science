<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:148</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
The wives of the Prophet used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place 
(near Baqia at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. 'Umar 
used to say to the Prophet "Let your wives be veiled," but Allah's 
Apostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam'a the wife of the 
Prophet went out at 'Isha' time and she was a tall lady. 'Umar 
addressed her and said, "I have recognized you, O Sauda." He said so, 
as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of 
veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed. So Allah revealed the 
verses of "Al-Hijab" (A complete body cover excluding the eyes).
