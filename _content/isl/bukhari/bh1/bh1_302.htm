<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:302</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
We set out with the Prophet for Hajj and when we reached Sarif I got 
my menses. When the Prophet came to me, I was weeping. He asked, "Why 
are you weeping?" I said, "I wish if I had not performed Hajj this 
year." He asked, "May be that you got your menses?" I replied, "Yes." 
He then said, "This is the thing which Allah has ordained for all the 
daughters of Adam. So do what all the pilgrims do except that you do 
not perform the Tawaf round the Ka'ba till you are clean."
