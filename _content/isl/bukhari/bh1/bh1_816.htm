<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:814</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Whoever eats garlic or onion should keep away from 
our mosque or should remain in his house." (Jabir bin 'Abdullah, in 
another narration said, "Once a big pot containing cooked vegetables 
was brought. On finding unpleasant smell coming from it, the Prophet 
asked, 'What is in it?' He was told all the names of the vegetables 
that were in it. The Prophet ordered that it should be brought near to
some of his companions who were with him. When the Prophet saw it he 
disliked to eat it and said, 'Eat. (I don't eat) for I converse with 
those whom you don't converse with (i.e. the angels)."
