<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:666</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
One night I slept at the house of (my aunt) Maimuna and the Prophet 
was there on that night. He performed ablution and stood up for the 
prayer. I joined him and stood on his left side but he drew me to his 
right and prayed thirteen Rakat and then slept till I heard his breath
sounds. And whenever he slept, he used to breathe with audible sounds.
The Mu'adhdhin came to the Prophet and he went out and prayed the 
morning prayer) without repeating the ablution.
