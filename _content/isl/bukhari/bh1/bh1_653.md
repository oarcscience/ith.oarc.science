### Hadith 1:651

*Narrated 'Urwa's father:*

'Aisha said, "Allah's Apostle ordered Abu Bakr to lead the people in the
prayer during his illness and so he led them in prayer." 'Urwa, a sub
narrator, added, "Allah's Apostle felt a bit relieved and came out and
Abu Bakr was leading the people. When Abu Bakr saw the Prophet he
retreated but the Prophet beckoned him to remain there. Allah's Apostle
sat beside Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr was following the prayer of Allah's
Apostle and the people were following the prayer of Abu Bakr."
