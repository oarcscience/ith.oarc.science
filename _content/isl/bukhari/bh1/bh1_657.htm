I went to 'Aisha and asked her to describe to me the illness of 
Allah's Apostle. 'Aisha said, "Yes. The Prophet became seriously ill 
and asked whether the people had prayed. We replied, 'No. O Allah's 
Apostle! They are waiting for you.' He added, 'Put water for me in a 
trough." 'Aisha added, "We did so. He took a bath and tried to get up 
but fainted. When he recovered, he again asked whether the people had 
prayed. We said, 'No, they are waiting for you. O Allah's Apostle,' He
again said, 'Put water in a trough for me.' He sat down and took a 
bath and tried to get up but fainted again. Then he recovered and 
said, 'Have the people prayed?' We replied, 'No, they are waiting for 
you. O Allah's Apostle.' He said, 'Put water for me in the trough.' 
Then he sat down and washed himself and tried to get up but he 
fainted. When he recovered, he asked, 'Have the people prayed?' We 
said, 'No, they are waiting for you. O Allah's Apostle! The people 
were in the mosque waiting for the Prophet for the 'Isha prayer. The 
Prophet sent for Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer. The 
messenger went to Abu Bakr and said, 'Allah's Apostle orders you to 
lead the people in the prayer.' Abu Bakr was a soft-hearted man, so he
asked 'Umar to lead the prayer but 'Umar replied, 'You are more 
rightful.' So Abu Bakr led the prayer in those days. When the Prophet 
felt a bit better, he came out for the Zuhr prayer with the help of 
two persons one of whom was Al-'Abbas. while Abu Bakr was leading the 
people in the prayer. When Abu Bakr saw him he wanted to retreat but 
the Prophet beckoned him not to do so and asked them to make him sit 
beside Abu Bakr and they did so. Abu Bakr was following the Prophet 
(in the prayer) and the people were following Abu Bakr. The Prophet 
(prayed) sitting."

'Ubaid-Ullah added "I went to 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas and asked him, 
Shall I tell you what Aisha has told me about the fatal illness of the
Prophet?' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'Go ahead. I told him her narration and he 
did not deny anything of it but asked whether 'Aisha told me the name 
of the second person (who helped the Prophet ) along with Al-Abbas. I 
said. 'No.' He said, 'He was 'Ali (Ibn Abi Talib).
