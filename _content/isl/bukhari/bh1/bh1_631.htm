<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:629</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Allah will give shade, to seven, on the Day when 
there will be no shade but His. (These seven persons are) a just 
ruler, a youth who has been brought up in the worship of Allah (i.e. 
worships Allah sincerely from childhood), a man whose heart is 
attached to the mosques (i.e. to pray the compulsory prayers in the 
mosque in congregation), two persons who love each other only for 
Allah's sake and they meet and part in Allah's cause only, a man who 
refuses the call of a charming woman of noble birth for illicit 
intercourse with her and says: I am afraid of Allah, a man who gives 
charitable gifts so secretly that his left hand does not know what his
right hand has given (i.e. nobody knows how much he has given in 
charity), and a person who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes 
are then flooded with tears."
