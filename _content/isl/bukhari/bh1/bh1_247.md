### Hadith 1:247

*Narrated Al-Bara 'bin 'Azib:*

The Prophet said to me, "Whenever you go to bed perform ablution like
that for the prayer, lie or your right side and say, "Allahumma aslamtu
wajhi ilaika, wa fauwadtu amri ilaika, wa alja'tu Zahri ilaika raghbatan
wa rahbatan ilaika. La Malja' wa la manja minka illa ilaika. Allahumma
amantu bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta wa bina-biyika-l ladhi arsalta" (O
Allah! I surrender to You and entrust all my affairs to You and depend
upon You for Your Blessings both with hope and fear of You. There is no
fleeing from You, and there is no place of protection and safety except
with You O Allah! I believe in Your Book (the Qur'an) which You have
revealed and in Your Prophet (Muhammad) whom You have sent). Then if you
die on that very night, you will die with faith (i.e. or the religion of
Islam). Let the aforesaid words be your last utterance (before sleep)."
I repeated it before the Prophet and when I reached "Allahumma amantu
bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta (O Allah I believe in Your Book which You
have revealed)." I said, "Wa-rasulika (and your Apostle)." The Prophet
said, "No, (but say): 'Wanabiyika-l-ladhi arsalta (Your Prophet whom You
have sent), instead."
