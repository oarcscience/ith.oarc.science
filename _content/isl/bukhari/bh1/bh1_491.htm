<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:489</H3><P><I>Narrated Busr bin Said:</I></P>
that Zaid bin Khalid sent him to Abi Juhaim to ask him what he had 
heard from Allah's Apostle about a person passing in front of another 
person who was praying. Abu Juhaim replied, "Allah's Apostle said, 'If
the person who passes in front of another person in prayer knew the 
magnitude of his sin he would prefer to wait for 40 (days, months or 
years) rather than to pass in front of him." Abu An-Nadr said, "I do 
not remember exactly whether he said 40 days, months or years."
