'Abdullah used to give a religious talk to the people on every 
Thursday. Once a man said, "O Aba 'Abdur-Rahman! (By Allah) I wish if 
you could preach us daily." He replied, "The only thing which prevents
me from doing so, is that I hate to bore you, and no doubt I take care
of you in preaching by selecting a suitable time just as the Prophet 
used to do with us, for fear of making us bored."
