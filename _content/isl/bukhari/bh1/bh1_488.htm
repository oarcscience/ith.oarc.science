Do you make us (women) equal to dogs and donkeys? While I used to lie 
in my bed, the Prophet would come and pray facing the middle of the 
bed. I used to consider it not good to stand in front of him in his 
prayers. So I used to slip away slowly and quietly from the foot of 
the bed till I got out of my guilt.
