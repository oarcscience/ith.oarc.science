The Prophet said, "Whenever anyone of you offers his prayer he is 
speaking in private to his Lord. So he should not spit to his right 
but under his left foot." Qatada said, "He should not spit in front of
him but to his left or under his feet." And Shu'ba said, "He should 
not spit in front of him, nor to his right but to his left or under 
his foot." Anas said: The Prophet said, "He should neither spit in the
direction of his Qibla nor to his right but to his left or under his 
foot."
