The Prophet and I used to take a bath from a single pot while we were 
Junub. During the menses, he used to order me to put on an Izar (dress
worn below the waist) and used to fondle me. While in Itikaf, he used 
to bring his head near me and I would wash it while I used to be in my
periods (menses).
