<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:114</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the ailment of the Prophet became worse, he 
said, 'Bring for me (writing) paper and I will write for you a 
statement after which you will not go astray.' But 'Umar said, 'The 
Prophet is seriously ill, and we have got Allah's Book with us and 
that is sufficient for us.' But the companions of the Prophet differed
about this and there was a hue and cry. On that the Prophet said to 
them, 'Go away (and leave me alone). It is not right that you should 
quarrel in front of me." Ibn 'Abbas came out saying, "It was most 
unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah's Apostle was prevented from
writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and 
noise. (Note: It is apparent from this Hadith that Ibn 'Abbes had 
witnessed the event and came out saying this statement. The truth is 
not so, for Ibn 'Abbas used to say this statement on narrating the 
Hadith and he had not witnessed the event personally. See Fath Al-Bari
Vol. 1, p.220 footnote.) (See Hadith No. 228, Vol. 4).
