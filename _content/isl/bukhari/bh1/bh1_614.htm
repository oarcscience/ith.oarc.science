<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:612</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle went out (of the mosque) when the Iqama had been 
pronounced and the rows straightened. The Prophet stood at his Musalla
(praying place) and we waited for the Prophet to begin the prayer with
Takbir. He left and asked us to remain in our places. We kept on 
standing till the Prophet returned and the water was trickling from 
his head for he had taken a bath (of Janaba).
