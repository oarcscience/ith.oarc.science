<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:374</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Hazim:</I></P>
Sahl bin Sa'd was asked about the (Prophet's) pulpit as to what thing 
it was made of? Sahl replied: "None remains alive amongst the people, 
who knows about it better than I. It was made of tamarisk (wood) of 
the forest. So and so, the slave of so and so prepared it for Allah's 
Apostle . When it was constructed and place (in the Mosque), Allah's 
Apostle stood on it facing the Qibla and said 'Allahu Akbar', and the 
people stood behind him (and led the people in prayer). He recited and
bowed and the people bowed behind him. Then he raised his head and 
stepped back, got down and prostrated on the ground and then he again 
ascended the pulpit, recited, bowed, raised his head and stepped back,
got down and prostrate on the ground. So, this is what I know about 
the pulpit."

Ahmad bin Hanbal said, "As the Prophet was at a higher level than the 
people, there is no harm according to the above-mentioned Hadith if 
the Imam is at a higher level than his followers during the prayers."
