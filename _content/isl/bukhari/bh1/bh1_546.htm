'Aisha said, "Once Allah's Apostle delayed the 'Isha' prayer till 
'Umar reminded him by saying, "The prayer!" The women and children 
have slept. Then the Prophet came out and said, 'None amongst the 
dwellers of the earth has been waiting for it (the prayer) except 
you." Urwa said, "Nowhere except in Medina the prayer used to be 
offered (in those days)." He further said, "The Prophet used to offer 
the 'Isha' prayer in the period between the disappearance of the 
twilight and the end of the first third of the night."
