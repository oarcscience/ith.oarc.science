saw Allah's Apostle when the 'Asr prayer was due and the people 
searched for water to perform ablution but they could not find it.

perform ablution from it. I saw the water springing out from 
underneath his fingers till all of them performed the ablution (it was
one of the miracles of the Prophet).
