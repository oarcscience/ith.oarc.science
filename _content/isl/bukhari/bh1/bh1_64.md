### Hadith 1:65

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Once the Prophet wrote a letter or had an idea of writing a letter. The
Prophet was told that they (rulers) would not read letters unless they
were sealed. So the Prophet got a silver ring made with "Muhammad
Allah's Apostle" engraved on it. As if I were just observing its white
glitter in the hand of the Prophet

the mosque with some people, ...](bh1_65)
