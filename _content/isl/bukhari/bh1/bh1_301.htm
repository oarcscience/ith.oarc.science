<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:301</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</I></P>
Once Allah's Apostle went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) o 
'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, 
"O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers 
of Hell-fire were you (women)." They asked, "Why is it so, O Allah's 
Apostle ?" He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to 
your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence 
and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by 
some of you." The women asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What is deficient 
in our intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is not the evidence of 
two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the 
affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. 
Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her 
menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the 
deficiency in her religion."
