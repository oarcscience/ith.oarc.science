While I was going to help this man ('Ali Ibn Abi Talib), Abu Bakra met
me and asked, "Where are you going?" I replied, "I am going to help 
that person." He said, "Go back for I have heard Allah's Apostle 
saying, 'When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, 
both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.' I
said, 'O Allah's Apostle! It is all right for the murderer but what 
about the murdered one?' Allah's Apostle replied, "He surely had the 
intention to kill his companion."
