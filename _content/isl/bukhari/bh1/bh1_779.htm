<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:777</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Salama:</I></P>
Once I went to Abu- Sa'id Al-Khudri and asked him, "Won't you come 
with us to the date-palm trees to have a talk?" So Abu Said went out 
and I asked him, "Tell me what you heard from the Prophet about the 
Night of Qadr." Abu Said replied, "Once Allah's Apostle performed 
I'tikaf (seclusion) on the first ten days of the month of Ramadan and 
we did the same with him. Gabriel came to him and said, 'The night you
are looking for is ahead of you.' So the Prophet performed the I'tikaf
in the middle (second) ten days of the month of Ramadan and we too 
performed I'tikaf with him. Gabriel came to him and said, 'The night 
which you are looking for is ahead of you.' In the morning of the 20th
of Ramadan the Prophet delivered a sermon saying, 'Whoever has 
performed I'tikaf with me should continue it. I have been shown the 
Night of "Qadr", but have forgotten its date, but it is in the odd 
nights of the last ten nights. I saw in my dream that I was 
prostrating in mud and water.' In those days the roof of the mosque 
was made of branches of date-palm trees. At that time the sky was 
clear and no cloud was visible, but suddenly a cloud came and it 
rained. The Prophet led us in the prayer and I saw the traces of mud 
on the forehead and on the nose of Allah's Apostle. So it was the 
confirmation of that dream."
