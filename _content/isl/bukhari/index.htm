<P>
The Hadith are anecdotes about Muhammad and other founders of Islam.
They are considered important source material
about religious practice, law, and historical traditions.
This is an extensive collection of Hadith as organized by 
Muhammad Ism&acirc;'&icirc;l al-Bukh&acirc;r&icirc;, one of the
most respected of the Hadith redactors. For more Hadith, see
<A HREF="../hadith/index">A Manual of Hadith</A>.</P>
