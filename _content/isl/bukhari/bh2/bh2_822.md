### Hadith 2:820

*Narrated Nafi:*

Ibn 'Umar used to spend the night at Dhi-Tuwa in between the two
Thaniyas and then he would enter Mecca through the Thaniya which is at
the higher region of Mecca, and whenever he came to Mecca for Hajj or
'Umra, he never made his she camel kneel down except near the gate of
the Masjid (Sacred Mosque) and then he would enter (it) and go to the
Black (stone) Corner and start from there circumambulating the Ka'ba
seven times: hastening in the first three rounds (Ramal) and walking in
the last four. On finishing, he would offer two Rakat prayer and set out
to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa before returning to his dwelling
place. On returning (to Medina) from Hajj or 'Umra, he used to make his
camel kneel down at Al-Batha which is at Dhu-l-Hulaifa, the place where
the Prophet used to make his camel kneel down.
