<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:319</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira.</I></P>
Once Allah's Apostle offered two Rakat and finished his prayer. So 
Dhul-Yadain asked him, "Has the prayer been reduced or have you 
forgotten?" Allah's Apostle said, "Has DhulYadain spoken the truth?" 
The people replied in the affirmative. Then Allah's Apostle stood up 
and offered the remaining two Rakat and performed Taslim, and then 
said Takbir and performed two prostrations like his usual 
prostrations, or a bit longer, and then got up.
