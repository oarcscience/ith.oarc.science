<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:130</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Livestock 
are destroyed and the roads are cut off. So please invoke Allah." So 
Allah's Apostle prayed and it rained from that Friday to the next 
Friday. Then he came to Allah's Apostle I and said, "O Allah's 
Apostle! Houses have collapsed, roads are cut off and the livestock 
are destroyed." So Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) prayed, "O Allah! (Let it
rain) on the tops of mountains, on the plateaus, in the valleys and 
over the places where trees grow." So the clouds cleared away from 
Medina as clothes are taken off.
