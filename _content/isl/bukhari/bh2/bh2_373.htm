The Prophet passed by a woman who was weeping beside a grave. He told 
her to fear Allah and be patient. She said to him, "Go away, for you 
have not been afflicted with a calamity like mine." And she did not 
recognize him. Then she was informed that he was the Prophet . so she 
went to the house of the Prophet and there she did not find any guard.
Then she said to him, "I did not recognize you." He said, "Verily, the
patience is at the first stroke of a calamity."
