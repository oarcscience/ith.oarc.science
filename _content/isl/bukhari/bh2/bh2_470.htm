<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:469</H3><P><I>Narrated Hisham's father:</I></P>
Aisha said, "I went to Abu Bakr (during his fatal illness) and he 
asked me, 'In how many garments was the Prophet shrouded?' She 
replied, 'In three Sahuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there
was neither a shirt nor a turban among them.' Abu Bakr further asked 
her, 'On which day did the Prophet die?' She replied, 'He died on 
Monday.' He asked, 'What is today?' She replied, 'Today is Monday.' He
added, 'I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.'
Then he looked at a garment that he was wearing during his illness and
it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, 'Wash this garment of 
mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.' I said, 'This 
is worn out.' He said, 'A living person has more right to wear new 
clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body's pus.' He 
did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the
morning."
