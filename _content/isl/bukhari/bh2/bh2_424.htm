<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:423</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The angel of death was sent to Moses and when he went to him, Moses 
slapped him severely, spoiling one of his eyes. The angel went back to
his Lord, and said, "You sent me to a slave who does not want to die."
Allah restored his eye and said, "Go back and tell him (i.e. Moses) to
place his hand over the back of an ox, for he will be allowed to live 
for a number of years equal to the number of hairs coming under his 
hand." (So the angel came to him and told him the same). Then Moses 
asked, "O my Lord! What will be then?" He said, "Death will be then." 
He said, "(Let it be) now." He asked Allah that He bring him near the 
Sacred Land at a distance of a stone's throw. Allah's Apostle 
(p.b.u.h) said, "Were I there I would show you the grave of Moses by 
the way near the red sand hill."
