<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:150</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Bakra:</I></P>
We were with Allah's Apostle when the sun eclipsed. Allah's Apostle 
stood up dragging his cloak till he entered the Mosque. He led us in a

(p.b.u.h) said, "The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of 
someone's death. So whenever you see these eclipses pray and invoke 
(Allah) till the eclipse is over."
