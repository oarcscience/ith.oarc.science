I heard Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan (repeating the statements of the Adhan)
while he was sitting on the pulpit. When the Muadh-dhin pronounced the
Adhan saying, "Allahu-Akbar, Allahu Akbar", Muawiya said: "Allah 
Akbar, Allahu Akbar." And when the Muadh-dhin said, "Ash-hadu an la 
ilaha illal-lah (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped 
but Allah)", Muawiya said, "And (so do) I". When he said, "Ash-hadu 
anna Muhammadan Rasulullah" (I testify that Muhammad is Allah's 
Apostle), Muawiya said, "And (so do) I". When the Adhan was finished, 
Muawiya said, "O people, when the Muadh-dhin pronounced the Adhan I 
heard Allah's Apostle on this very pulpit saying what you have just 
heard me saying".
