<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:444</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Ali:</I></P>
" We were accompanying a funeral procession in Baqi-I-Gharqad. The 
Prophet came to us and sat and we sat around him. He had a small stick
in his hand then he bent his head and started scraping the ground with
it. He then said, "There is none among you, and not a created soul, 
but has place either in Paradise or in Hell assigned for him and it is
also determined for him whether he will be among the blessed or 
wretched." A man said, "O Allah's Apostle! Should we not depend on 
what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us
is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst 
us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?" The 
Prophet said, "The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad 
deeds are made easy for the wretched." Then he recited the Verses:-- 
"As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes 
in the Best reward from Allah. " (92.5-6)
