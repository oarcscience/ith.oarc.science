<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:747</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Jamra:</I></P>
I asked Ibn Abbas about Hajj-at-Tamattu'. He ordered me to perform it.
I asked him about the Hadi (sacrifice). He said, "You have to 
slaughter a camel, a cow or a sheep, or you may share the Hadi with 
the others." It seemed that some people disliked it (Hajj-at-Tamattu).
I slept and dreamt as if a person was announcing: "Hajj Mabrur and 
accepted Mut'ah (Hajj-At-Tamattu')" I went to Ibn Abbas and narrated 
it to him. He said, "Allah is Greater. (That was) the tradition of Abu
was. "An accepted 'Umra and Hajj-Mabrur. "
