Ibn 'Umar never offered the Duha prayer except on two occasions: 
<P>
(1) Whenever he reached Mecca; and he always used to reach Mecca in 
the forenoon. He would perform Tawaf round the Ka'ba and then offer 
two Rakat at the rear of Maqam Ibrahim. 
<P>
(2) Whenever he visited Quba, for he used to visit it every Saturday. 
When he entered the Mosque, he disliked to leave it without offering a
prayer. Ibn 'Umar narrated that Allah's Apostle used to visit the 
Mosque of Quba (sometime) walking and (sometime) riding. And he (i.e. 
Ibn 'Umar) used to say, "I do only what my companions used to do and I
don't forbid anybody to pray at any time during the day or night 
except that one should not intend to pray at sunrise or sunset."
