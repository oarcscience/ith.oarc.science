<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:597</H3><P><I>Narrated Zaid bin Jubair:</I></P>
I went to visit 'Abdullah bin 'Umar at his house which contained many 
tents made of cotton cloth and these were encircled with Suradik (part
of the tent). I asked him from where, should one assume Ihram for 
Umra. He said, "Allah's Apostle had fixed as Miqat (singular of 
Mawaqit) Qarn for the people of Najd, Dhul-Hulaifa for the people of 
Medina, and Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham."
