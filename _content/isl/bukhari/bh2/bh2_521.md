### Hadith 2:520

*Narrated*

Narrate Aisha :

The Prophet said, "If a woman gives in charity from her husband's house
.." The Prophet (p.b.u.h) also said, "If a lady gives meals (in charity)
from her husband's house without spoiling her husband's property, she
will get a reward and her husband will also get a reward likewise. The
husband will get a reward because of his earnings and the woman because
of her spending."
