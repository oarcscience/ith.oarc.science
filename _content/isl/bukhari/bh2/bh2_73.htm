<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:74</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the 'Id 
prayer, should slaughter again." A man stood up and said, "This is the
day on which one has desire for meat," and he mentioned something 
about his neighbors. It seemed that the Prophet I believed him. Then 
the same man added, "I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me 
than the meat of two sheep." The Prophet permitted him to slaughter it
as a sacrifice. I do not know whether that permission was valid only 
for him or for others as well.
