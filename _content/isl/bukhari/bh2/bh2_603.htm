Allah's Apostle had fixed Dhul Hulaifa as the Mlqat for the people of 
Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; and Qarn Ul-Manazil for the 
people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. So, these (above
mentioned) are the Mawaqit for all those living at those places, and 
besides them for those who come through those places with the 
intention of performing Hajj and 'Umra and whoever lives within these 
places should assume Ihram from his dwelling place, and similarly the 
people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.
