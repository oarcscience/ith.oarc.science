### Hadith 2:49

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

Once the Prophet ascended the pulpit and it was the last gathering in
which he took part. He was covering his shoulder with a big cloak and
binding his head with an oily bandage. He glorified and praised Allah
and said, "O people! Come to me." So the people came and gathered around
him and he then said, "Amma ba'du." "From now onward the Ansar will
decrease and other people will increase. So anybody who becomes a ruler
of the followers of Muhammad and has the power to harm or benefit people
then he should accept the good from the benevolent amongst them (Ansar)
and overlook the faults of their wrong-doers."
