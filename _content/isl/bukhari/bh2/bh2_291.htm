<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:290</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah:</I></P>
We used to greet the Prophet while he was praying and he used to 
answer our greetings. When we returned from AnNajashi (the ruler of 
Ethiopia), we greeted him, but he did not answer us (during the 
prayer) and (after finishing the prayer) he said, "In the prayer one 
is occupied (with a more serious matter)."
