<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:120</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira;</I></P>
Whenever the Prophet (p.b.u.h) lifted his head from the bowing in the 
last Raka he used to say: "O Allah! Save 'Aiyash bin Abi Rabi'a. O 
Allah! Save Salama bin Hisham. O Allah! Save Walid bin Walid. O Allah!
Save the weak faithful believers. O Allah! Be hard on the tribes of 
Mudar and send (famine) years on them like the famine years of 
(Prophet) Joseph ." The Prophet further said, "Allah forgive the 
tribes of Ghifar and save the tribes of Aslam." Abu Az-Zinad (a 
sub-narrator) said, "The Qunut used to be recited by the Prophet in 
the Fajr prayer."
