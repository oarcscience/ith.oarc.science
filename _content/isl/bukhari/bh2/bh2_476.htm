I saw 'Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, "O 'Abdullah 
bin 'Umar! Go to the mother of the  believers Aisha and say, 'Umar bin
Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,' and request her to allow me to
be buried with my companions." (So, Ibn 'Umar conveyed the message to 
'Aisha.) She said, "I had the idea of having this place for myself but
today I prefer him ('Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried 
there)." When 'Abdullah bin 'Umar returned, 'Umar asked him, "What 
(news) do you have?" He replied, "O chief of the believers! She has 
allowed you (to be buried there)." On that 'Umar said, "Nothing was 
more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, 
when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her ('Aisha ) 
and say, 'Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives 
permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to 
the grave-yard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more 
right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h)
was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people
after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and 
obey him," and then he mentioned the name of 'Uthman, 'Ali, Talha, 
Az-Zubair, 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf and Sad bin Abi Waqqas. 
<P>
By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, "O chief of the 
believers! Be happy with Allah's glad tidings. The grade which you 
have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you 
ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all 
this." 'Umar replied, "O son of my brother! Would that all that 
privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither 
lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the 
early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor 
and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar 
who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He 
should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse 
their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and 
regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His 
Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and 
not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities."
