<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:197</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</I></P>
"I saw Allah's Apostle delaying the Maghrib prayer till he offered it 
along with the 'Isha' prayer whenever he was in a hurry during the 
journey." Salim narrated, "Ibn 'Umar used to do the same whenever he 
was in a hurry during the journey." And Salim added, "Ibn 'Umar used 
to pray the Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers together in Al-Muzdalifa." 
Salim said, "Ibn 'Umar delayed the Maghrib prayer because at that time
he heard the news of the death of his wife Safiya bint Abi 'Ubaid. I 
said to him, 'The prayer (is due).' He said, 'Go on.' Again I said, 
'The prayer (is due).' He said, 'Go on,' till we covered two or three 
miles. Then he got down, prayed and said, 'I saw the Prophet praying 
in this way, whenever he was in a hurry during the journey.'  
'Abdullah (bin 'Umar) added, "Whenever the Prophet was in a hurry, he 
used to delay the Maghrib prayer and then offer three Rakat (of the 
Maghrib) and perform Taslim, and after waiting for a short while, 
Iqama used to be pronounced for the 'Isha' prayer when he would offer 
two Rakat and perform Taslim. He would never offer any optional prayer
till the middle of the night (when he used to pray the Tahajjud)."
