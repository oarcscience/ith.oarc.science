A young Jewish boy used to serve the Prophet and he became sick. So 
the Prophet went to visit him. He sat near his head and asked him to 
embrace Islam. The boy looked at his father, who was sitting there; 
the latter told him to obey Abu-l-Qasim and the boy embraced Islam. 
The Prophet came out saying: "Praises be to Allah Who saved the boy 
from the Hell-fire."
