Ibn  Abbas was asked whether he had joined the Prophet in the 'Id 
prayer. He said, "Yes. And I could not have joined him had I not been 
young. (The Prophet came out) till he reached the mark which was near 
the house of Kathir bin As-Salt, offered the prayer, delivered the 
Khutba and then went towards the women. Bilal was accompanying him. He
preached to them and advised them and ordered them to give alms. I saw
the women putting their ornaments with their outstretched hands into 
Bilal's garment. Then the Prophet along with Bilal returned home.
