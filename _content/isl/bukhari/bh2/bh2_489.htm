<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:488</H3><P><I>Narrated Zaid bin Wahab:</I></P>
I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met Abu Dhar and
asked him, "What has brought you to this place?" He said, "I was in 
Sham and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of (the following verses
of the Quran): 'They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not 
in the way of Allah.' (9.34). Muawiya said, 'This verse is revealed 
regarding the people of the scriptures." I said, It was revealed 
regarding us and also the people of the scriptures." So we had a 
quarrel and Mu'awiya sent a complaint against me to 'Uthman. 'Uthman 
wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came 
to me as if they had not seen me before. So I told this to 'Uthman who
said to me, "You may depart and live nearby if you wish." That was the
reason for my being here for even if an Ethiopian had been nominated 
as my ruler, I would have obeyed him .
