<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:164</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amra bint 'AbdurRahman:</I></P>
A Jewess came to 'Aisha to ask her about something and then she said, 
"May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave." So 
'Aisha asked Allah's Apostle, "Would the people be punished in their 
graves?" Allah's Apostle asked Allah's refuge from the punishment of 
the grave (indicating an affirmative reply). Then one day Allah's 
Apostle rode (to leave for some place) but the sun eclipsed. He 
returned on the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings 
(of his wives) and stood up and started offering the (eclipse) prayer 
and the people stood behind him. He stood for a long period and then 
performed a long bowing and then stood straight for a long period 
which was shorter than that of the first standing, then he performed a
prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first bowing, then he 
raised his head and prostrated for a long time and then stood up (for 
the second Raka) for a long while, but the standing was shorter than 
the standing of the first Raka. Then he performed a prolonged bowing 
which was shorter than that of the first one. He then stood up for a 
long time but shorter than the first, then again performed a long 
bowing which was shorter than the first and then prostrated for a 
shorter while than that of the first prostration. Then he finished the
prayer and delivered the sermon and) said what Allah wished; and 
ordered the people to seek refuge with Allah from the punishment of 
the grave.
