<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:204</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</I></P>
We went to receive Anas bin Malik when he returned from Sham and met 
him at a place called 'Ain-at-Tamr. I saw him praying riding the 
donkey, with his face to this direction, i.e. to the left of the 
Qibla. I said to him, "I have seen you offering the prayer in a 
direction other than that of the Qibla." He replied, "If I had not 
seen Allah's Apostle doing it, I would not have done it."
