<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:662</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
The people used to fast on 'Ashura (the tenth day of the month of 
Muharram) before the fasting of Ramadan was made obligatory. And on 
that day the Ka'ba used to be covered with a cover. When Allah made 
the fasting of the month of Ramadan compulsory, Allah's Apostle said, 
"Whoever wishes to fast (on the day of 'Ashura') may do so; and 
whoever wishes to leave it can do so."
