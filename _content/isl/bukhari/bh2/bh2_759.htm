that 'Amra bint 'Abdur-Rahman had told him, "Zaid bin Abu Sufyan wrote
to 'Aisha that 'Abdullah bin Abbas had stated, 'Whoever sends his Hadi
(to the Ka'ba), all the things which are illegal for a (pilgrim) 
become illegal for that person till he slaughters it (i.e. till the 
10th of Dhul-Hijja).' " 'Amra added, 'Aisha said, 'It is not like what
Ibn Abbas had said: I twisted the garlands of the Hadis of Allah's 
Apostle with my own hands. Then Allah's Apostle put them round their 
necks with his own hands, sending them with my father; Yet nothing 
permitted by Allah was considered illegal for Allah's Apostle till he 
slaughtered the Hadis.' "
