### Hadith 2:603

*Narrated Salim bin 'Abdullah from his father:*

I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "The Miqat for the people of Medina is
Dhul-Hulaifa; for the people of Sham is Mahita; (i.e. Al-Juhfa); and for
the people of Najd is Qarn. And said Ibn 'Umar, "They claim, but I did
not hear personally, that the Prophet said, "The Miqat for the people of
Yemen is Yalamlam."

[Next: 2:604: Ibn Abbas: The Prophet fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat for
the people of Medina, ...](bh2_606)
