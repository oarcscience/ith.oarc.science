### Hadith 2:293

*Narrated Sahl bin Sad:*

The Prophet went out to affect a reconciliation between the tribes of
Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf and the time of the prayer became due; Bilal went to
Abu Bakr and said, "The Prophet is detained. Will you lead the people in
the prayer?" Abu Bakr replied, "Yes, if you wish." So Bilal pronounced
the Iqama and Abu Bakr led the prayer. In the meantime the Prophet came
crossing the rows (of the praying people) till he stood in the first row
and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr never looked hither and
thither during the prayer but when the people clapped too much, he
looked back and saw the Prophet in the (first) row. The Prophet waved
him to remain at his place, but Abu Bakr raised both his hands and sent
praises to Allah and then retreated and the Prophet went forward and led
the prayer. (See Hadith No. 295 & 296)
