<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:577</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
Some people from 'Uraina tribe came to Medina and its climate did not 
suit them, so Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) allowed them to go to the herd
of camels (given as Zakat) and they drank their milk and urine (as 
medicine) but they killed the shepherd and drove away all the camels. 
So Allah's Apostle sent (men) in their pursuit to catch them, and they
were brought, and he had their hands and feet cut, and their eyes were
branded with heated pieces of iron and they were left in the Harra (a 
stony place at Medina) biting the stones. (See Hadith No. 234, Vol. 1)
