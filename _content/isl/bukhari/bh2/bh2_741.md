*Narrated 'Abdullah:*

(the slave of Asma') During the night of Jam', Asma' got down at
Al-Muzdalifa and stood up for (offering) the prayer and offered the
prayer for some time and then asked, "O my son! Has the moon set?" I
replied in the negative and she again prayed for another period and then
asked, "Has the moon set?" I replied, "Yes." So she said that we should
set out (for Mina), and we departed and went on till she threw pebbles
at the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Aqaba) and then she returned to her dwelling
place and offered the morning prayer. I asked her, "O you! I think we
have come (to Mina) early in the night." She replied, "O my son! Allah's
Apostle gave permission to the women to do so."
