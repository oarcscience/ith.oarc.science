<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:589</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abbas :</I></P>
Al-Fadl (his brother) was riding behind Allah's Apostle and a woman 
from the tribe of Khath'am came and Al-Fadl started looking at her and
she started looking at him. The Prophet turned Al-Fadl's face to the 
other side. The woman said, "O Allah's Apostle! The obligation of Hajj
enjoined by Allah on His devotees has become due on my father and he 
is old and weak, and he cannot sit firm on the Mount; may I perform 
Hajj on his behalf?" The Prophet replied, "Yes, you may." That 
happened during the Hajj-al-Wida (of the Prophet ).
