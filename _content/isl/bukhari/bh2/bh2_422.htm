<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:421</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
A black person, a male or a female used to clean the Mosque and then 
died. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) did not know about it . One day the 
Prophet remembered him and said, "What happened to that person?" The 
people replied, "O Allah's Apostle! He died." He said, "Why did you 
not inform me?" They said, "His story was so and so (i.e. regarded him
as insignificant)." He said, "Show me his grave." He then went to his 
grave and offered the funeral prayer.
