<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:202</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amir bin Rabi'a,</I></P>
I saw the Prophet on his Mount praying Nawafil by nodding his head, 
whatever direction he faced, but Allah's Apostle never did the same in
'Umar used to offer the prayer on the back of his animal during the 
journey and never cared about the direction he faced. Ibn 'Umar said, 
"Allah's Apostle used to offer the optional prayer on the back of his 
Mount facing any direction and also used to pray the Witr on it but 
never offered the compulsory prayer on it."
