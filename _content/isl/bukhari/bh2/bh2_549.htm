<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:548</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</I></P>
Some Ansari persons asked for (something) from Allah's Apostle 
(p.b.u.h) and he gave them. They again asked him for (something) and 
he again gave them. And then they asked him and he gave them again 
till all that was with him finished. And then he said "If I had 
anything. I would not keep it away from you. (Remember) Whoever 
abstains from asking others, Allah will make him contented, and 
whoever tries to make himself self-sufficient, Allah will make him 
self-sufficient. And whoever remains patient, Allah will make him 
patient. Nobody can be given a blessing better and greater than 
patience."
