### Hadith 2:478

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

Thy Prophet sent Muadh to Yemen and said, "Invite the people to testify
that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and I am Allah's
Apostle, and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has
enjoined on them five prayers in every day and night (in twenty-four
hours), and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has
made it obligatory for them to pay the Zakat from their property and it
is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to the poor."
