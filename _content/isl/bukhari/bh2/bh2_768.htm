Ibn 'Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year of the Hajj of 
Al-Harawriya during the rule of Ibn Az-Zubair. Some people said to 
him, "It is very likely that there will be a fight among the people, 
and we are afraid that they might prevent you (from performing Hajj)."
He replied, "Verily, in Allah's Apostle there is a good example for 
you (to follow). In this case I would do the same as he had done. I 
make you witness that I have intended to perform 'Umra." When he 
reached Al-Baida', he said, "The conditions for both Hajj and 'Umra 
are the same. I make you witness that I have intended to perform Hajj 
along with 'Umra." After that he took a garlanded Hadi (to Mecca) 
which he bought (on the way). When he reached (Mecca), he performed 
Tawaf of the Ka'ba and of Safa (and Marwa) and did not do more than 
that. He did not make legal for himself the things which were illegal 
for a Muhrim till it was the Day of Nahr (sacrifice), when he had his 
head shaved and slaughtered (the sacrifice) and considered sufficient 
his first Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa), as a (Sa'i) for his Hajj and
'Umra both. He then said, "The Prophet used to do like that."
