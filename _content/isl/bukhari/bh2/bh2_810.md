### Hadith 2:808

*Narrated Salim bin Abdullah:*

'Abdullah bin 'Umar used to do Rami of the Jamrat-ud-Dunya with seven
small pebbles and used to recite Takbir on throwing each stone. He,
then, would proceed further till he reached the level ground, where he
would stay for a long time, facing the Qibla to invoke (Allah) while
raising his hands. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Wusta
similarly and would go to the left towards the level ground, where he
would stand for a long time facing the Qibla to invoke (Allah) while
raising his hands. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-'Aqaba from
the middle of the valley, but he would not stay by it. Ibn 'Umar used to
say, "I saw Allah's Apostle doing like that."
