### Hadith 2:547

*Narrated Abu Huraira*

Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered (a person) to collect Zakat, and that
person returned and told him that Ibn Jamil, Khalid bin Al-Walid, and
Abbas bin 'Abdul Muttalib had refused to give Zakat." The Prophet said,
"What made Ibn Jamll refuse to give Zakat though he was a poor man, and
was made wealthy by Allah and His Apostle ? But you are unfair in asking
Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping his armor for Allah's Cause (for
Jihad). As for Abbas bin 'Abdul Muttalib, he is the uncle of Allah's
Apostle (p.b.u.h) and Zakat is compulsory on him and he should pay it
double."
