Ibn Abbas said: "Allah's Apostle delivered a sermon on the Day of 
Nahr, and said, 'O people! (Tell me) what is the day today?' The 
people replied, 'It is the forbidden (sacred) day.' He asked again, 
'What town is this?' They replied, 'It is the forbidden (Sacred) 
town.' He asked, 'Which month is this?' They replied, 'It is the 
forbidden (Sacred) month.' He said, 'No doubt! Your blood, your 
properties, and your honor are sacred to one another like the sanctity
of this day of yours, in this (sacred) town (Mecca) of yours, in this 
month of yours.' The Prophet repeated his statement again and again. 
After that he raised his head and said, 'O Allah! Haven't conveyed 
(Your Message) to them'. Haven't I conveyed Your Message to them?' " 
Ibn Abbas added, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the following was 
his will (Prophet's will) to his followers:--It is incumbent upon 
those who are present to convey this information to those who are 
absent Beware don't renegade (as) disbelievers (turn into infidels) 
after me, Striking the necks (cutting the throats) of one another.' "
