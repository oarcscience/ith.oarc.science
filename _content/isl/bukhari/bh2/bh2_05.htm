Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "Any person who takes a bath on Friday
like the bath of Janaba and then goes for the prayer (in the first 
hour i.e. early), it is as if he had sacrificed a camel (in Allah's 
cause); and whoever goes in the second hour it is as if he had 
sacrificed a cow; and whoever goes in the third hour, then it is as if
he had sacrificed a horned ram; and if one goes in the fourth hour, 
then it is as if he had sacrificed a hen; and whoever goes in the 
fifth hour then it is as if he had offered an egg. When the Imam comes
out (i.e. starts delivering the Khutba), the angels present themselves
to listen to the Khutba."
