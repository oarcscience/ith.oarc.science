<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:432</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Allah has made Mecca a sanctuary (sacred place) and
it was a sanctuary before me and will be so after me. It was made 
legal for me (to fight in it) for a few hours of the day. None is 
allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs or to cut its trees or to chase 
its game or to pick up its fallen things except by a person who 
announces it publicly." On that Al-Abbas said (to the Prophet), 
"Except Al-Idhkhir for our goldsmiths and for our graves." And so the 
Prophet added, "Except Al-Idhkhir. " And Abu Huraira narrated that the
Prophet said, "Except Al-Idhkhir for our graves and houses." And Ibn 
Abbas said, "For their goldsmiths and houses."
