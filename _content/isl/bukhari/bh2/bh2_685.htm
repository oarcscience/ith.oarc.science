<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:683</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Urwa:</I></P>
'Aisha said, "The first thing the Prophet did on reaching Mecca, was 
the ablution and then he performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba and that was not
'Umra (alone), (but Hajj-al-Qiran). 'Urwa added: Later Abu Bakr and 
'Umar did the same in their Hajj." And I performed the Hajj with my 
father Az-Zubair, and the first thing he did was Tawaf of the Ka'ba. 
Later I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and the Ansar doing the same. My
mother (Asma') told me that she, her sister ('Aisha), Az-Zubair and 
such and such persons assumed Ihram for 'Umra, and after they passed 
their hands over the Black Stone Corner (of the Ka'ba) they finished 
the Ihram. (i.e. After doing Tawaf of the Ka'ba and Sa'i between 
Safa-Marwa.
