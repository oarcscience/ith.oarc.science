### Hadith 2:213

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Whenever the Prophet started the journey before noon, he used to delay
the Zuhr prayer till the time for the 'Asr prayer and then he would
dismount and pray them together; and whenever the sun declined before he
started the journey he used to offer the Zuhr prayer and then ride (for
the journey).
