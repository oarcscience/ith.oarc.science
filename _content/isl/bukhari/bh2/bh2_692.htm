<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:690</H3><P><I>Narrated Amr:</I></P>
We asked Ibn Umar: "May a man have sexual relations with his wife 
during the Umra before performing Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?" He 
said, "Allah's Apostle arrived (in Mecca) and circumambulated the Kaba
seven times, then offered two Rakat behind Maqam Ibrahim (the station 
of Abraham), then performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." Ibn Umar 
added, "Verily! In Allah's Apostle you have a good example." And I 
asked Jabir bin Abdullah (the same question), and he replied, "You 
should not go near your wives (have sexual relations) till you have 
finished Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. "
