### Hadith 2:656

*Narrated Yazid bin Ruman from 'Urwa:*

'Aisha said that the Prophet said to her, "O Aisha! Were your nation not
close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka'ba
demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been
left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have
made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the
west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations
laid by Abraham." That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to demolish the
Ka'ba. Jazz said, "I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished and rebuilt
the Ka'ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion
of Ka'ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the
north-west of the Ka'ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham
which were of stones resembling the humps of camels." So Jarir asked
Yazid, "Where was the place of those stones?" Jazz said, "I will just
now show it to you." So Jarir accompanied Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and
Jazz pointed to a place and said, "Here it is." Jarir said, "It appeared
to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so."
