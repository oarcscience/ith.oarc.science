Ibn 'Umar said, "When Allah's Apostle performed the first Tawaf he did
Ramal in the first three rounds and then walked in the remaining four 
rounds (of Tawaf of the Ka'ba), where as in performing Tawaf between 
Safa and Marwa he used to run in the midst of the rain-water passage,"
I asked Nafi', "Did 'Abdullah (bin 'Umar) use to walk steadily on 
reaching the Yemenite Corner?" He replied, "No, unless people were 
crowded at the Corner; otherwise he would not leave it without 
touching it."
