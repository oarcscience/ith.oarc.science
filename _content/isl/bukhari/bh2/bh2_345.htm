Allah's Apostle came to us when his daughter died and said, "Wash her 
thrice or five times or more, if you see it necessary, with water and 
Sidr and then apply camphor or some camphor at the end; and when you 
finish, notify me." So when we finished it, we informed him and he 
gave us his waist-sheet and told us to shroud the dead body in it.
