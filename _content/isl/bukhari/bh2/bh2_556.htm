The clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba narrated, "Muawiya wrote to 
Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba: Write to me something which you have heard from
the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ." So Al-Mughira wrote: I heard the Prophet 
saying, "Allah has hated for you three things: 
<P>
1. Vain talks, (useless talk) that you talk too much or about others. 
<P>
2. Wasting of wealth (by extravagance) 
<P>
3. And asking too many questions (in disputed religious matters) or 
asking others for something (except in great need). (See Hadith No. 
591, Vol. Ill)
