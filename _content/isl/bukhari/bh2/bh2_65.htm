Once the Prophet (p.b.u.h) led the fear prayer and the people stood 
behind him. He said Takbir (Allahu-Akbar) and the people said the 
same. He bowed and some of them bowed. Then he prostrated and they 
also prostrated. Then he stood for the second Raka and those who had 
prayed the first Raka left and guarded their brothers. The second 
party joined him and performed bowing and prostration with him. All 
the people were in prayer but they were guarding one another during 
the prayer.
