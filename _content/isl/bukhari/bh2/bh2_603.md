### Hadith 2:601

*Narrated Ibn Abbas :*

Allah's Apostle had fixed Dhul Hulaifa as the Mlqat for the people of
Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; and Qarn Ul-Manazil for the
people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. So, these (above
mentioned) are the Mawaqit for all those living at those places, and
besides them for those who come through those places with the intention
of performing Hajj and 'Umra and whoever lives within these places
should assume Ihram from his dwelling place, and similarly the people of
Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.

Mawaqit as follows: (No. 603) ...](bh2_604)
