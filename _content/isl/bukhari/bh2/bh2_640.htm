Abu Jamra Nasr bin 'Imran Ad-Duba'i said, "I intended to perform 
Hajj-at-Tamattu' and the people advised me not to do so. I asked Ibn 
Abbas regarding it and he ordered me to perform Hajj-at-Tammatu'. 
Later I saw in a dream someone saying to me, 'Hajj-Mabrur (Hajj 
performed in accordance with the Prophet's tradition without 
committing sins and accepted by Allah) and an accepted 'Umra.' So I 
told that dream to Ibn Abbas. He said, 'This is the tradition of 
Abu-l-Qasim.' Then he said to me, 'Stay with me and I shall give you a
portion of my property.' " I (Shu'ba) asked, "Why (did he invite 
you)?" He (Abu Jamra) said, "Because of the dream which I had seen."
