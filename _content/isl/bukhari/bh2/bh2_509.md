### Hadith 2:508

*Narrated Hakim bin Hizam*

The Prophet said, "The upper hand is better than the lower hand (i.e. he
who gives in charity is better than him who takes it). One should start

his expenses). And whoever abstains from asking others for some
financial help, Allah will give him and save him from asking others,
Allah will make him self-sufficient."
