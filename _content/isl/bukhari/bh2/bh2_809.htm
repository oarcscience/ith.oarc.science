Ibn 'Umar used to do Rami of the Jamrat-ud-Dunya (the Jamra near to 
the Khaif mosque) with seven small stones and used to recite Takbir on
throwing every pebble. He then would go ahead till he reached the 
level ground where he would stand facing the Qibla for a long time to 
invoke (Allah) while raising his hands (while invoking). Then he would
do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Wusta (middle Jamra) and then he would go to 
the left towards the middle ground, where he would stand facing the 
Qibla. He would remain standing there for a long period to invoke 
(Allah) while raising his hands, and would stand there for a long 
period. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Aqaba from the middle 
of the valley, but he would not stay by it, and then he would leave 
and say, "I saw the Prophet doing like this."
