'Abdullah (bin 'Abdullah) bin 'Umar said to his father, "Stay here, 
for I am afraid that it (affliction between Ibn Zubair and Al-Hajjaj) 
might prevent you from reaching the Ka'ba." Ibn 'Umar said, "(In this 
case) I would do the same as Allah's Apostle did, and Allah has said, 
'Verily, in Allah's Apostle, you have a good example (to follow).' So,
I make you, people, witness that I have made 'Umra compulsory for me."
So he assumed lhram for'Umra. Then he went out and when he reached 
Al-Baida', he assumed Ihram for Hajj and 'Umra (together) and said, 
"The conditions (requisites) of Hajj and 'Umra are the same." He, then
brought a Hadi from Qudaid. Then he arrived (at Mecca) and performed 
Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) once for both Hajj and 'Umra and did 
not finish the lhram till he had finished both Hajj and 'Umra.
