One night Allah's Apostle offered the prayer in the Mosque and the 
people followed him. The next night he also offered the prayer and too
many people gathered. On the third and the fourth nights more people 
gathered, but Allah's Apostle did not come out to them. In the morning
he said, "I saw what you were doing and nothing but the fear that it 
(i.e. the prayer) might be enjoined on you, stopped me from coming to 
you." And that happened in the month of Ramadan.
