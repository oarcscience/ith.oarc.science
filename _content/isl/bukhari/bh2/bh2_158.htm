<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:159</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amra bint 'AbdurRahman:</I></P>
A Jewess came to ask 'Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) about something.
She said to her, "May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the
grave." So 'Aisha ' asked Allah's Apostle "Would the people be 
punished in their graves?" Allah's Apostle after seeking refuge with 
Allah from the punishment of the grave (and thus replied in the 
affirmative). Then one day, Allah's Apostle rode to go to some place 
but the sun eclipsed. He returned in the forenoon and passed through 
the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood for the (eclipse) 
prayer, and the people stood behind him. He stood up for a long period
and then performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first
bowing. Then he raised his head and prostrated. Then he stood up (for 
the second Raka) for a long while but the standing was shorter than 
that of the first Raka. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was
shorter than the first one. Then he raised his head and prostrated. 
Then he stood up for a long time but shorter than the first. Then he 
performed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first. Then he 
raised his head and prostrated and finished the prayer and (then 
delivered the sermon and) said as much as Allah wished. And then he 
ordered the people to seek refuge with Allah from the punishment of 
the grave.
