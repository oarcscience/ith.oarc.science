Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "Anyone who takes a bath on Friday and
cleans himself as much as he can and puts oil (on his hair) or scents 
himself; and then proceeds for the prayer and does not force his way 
between two persons (assembled in the mosque for the Friday prayer), 
and prays as much as is written for him and remains quiet when the 
Imam delivers the Khutba, all his sins in between the present and the 
last Friday will be forgiven."
