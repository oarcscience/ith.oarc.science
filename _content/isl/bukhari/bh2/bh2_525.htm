<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:524</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Burda:</I></P>
from his father from his grandfather that the Prophet said, "Every 
Muslim has to give in charity." The people asked, "O Allah's Prophet! 
If someone has nothing to give, what will he do?" He said, "He should 
work with his hands and benefit himself and also give in charity (from
what he earns)." The people further asked, "If he cannot find even 
that?" He replied, "He should help the needy who appeal for help." 
Then the people asked, "If he cannot do that?" He replied, "Then he 
should perform good deeds and keep away from evil deeds and this will 
be regarded as charitable deeds."
