<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:806</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Amash:</I></P>
I heard Al-Hajjaj saying on the pulpit, "The Sura in which Al-Baqara 
(the cow) is mentioned and the Sura in which the family of 'Imran is 
mentioned and the Sura in which the women (An-Nisa) is mentioned." I 
mentioned this to Ibrahim, and he said, 'Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid told 
me, 'I was with Ibn Masud, when he did the Rami of the 
Jamrat-ul-Aqaba. He went down the middle of the valley, and when he 
came near the tree (which was near the Jamra) he stood opposite to it 
and threw seven small pebbles and said: 'Allahu-Akbar' on throwing 
every pebble.' Then he said, 'By Him, except Whom none has the right 
to be worshipped, here (at this place) stood the one on whom 
Surat-al-Baqra was revealed (i.e. Allah's Apostle).' "
