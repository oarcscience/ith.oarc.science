I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "The Miqat for the people of Medina is
Dhul-Hulaifa; for the people of Sham is Mahita; (i.e. Al-Juhfa); and 
for the people of Najd is Qarn. And said Ibn 'Umar, "They claim, but I
did not hear personally, that the Prophet said, "The Miqat for the 
people of Yemen is Yalamlam."
