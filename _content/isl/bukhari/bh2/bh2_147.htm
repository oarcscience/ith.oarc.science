Allah's Apostle  led the morning prayer in Al-Hudaibiya and it had 
rained the previous night. When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) had finished the
prayer he faced the people and said, "Do you know what your Lord has 
said?" They replied, "Allah and His Apostle know better." (The Prophet
said), "Allah says, 'In this morning some of My worshipers remained as
true believers and some became non-believers; he who said that it had 
rained with the blessing and mercy of Allah is the one who believes in
Me and does not believe in star, but he who said it had rained because
of such and such (star) is a disbeliever in Me and is a believer in 
star.' "
