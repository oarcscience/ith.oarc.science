<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:308</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle sent me for some job and when I had finished it I 
returned and came to the Prophet and greeted him but he did not return
my greeting. So I felt so sorry that only Allah knows it and I said to
myself,, 'Perhaps Allah's Apostle is angry because I did not come 
quickly, then again I greeted him but he did not reply. I felt even 
more sorry than I did the first time. Again I greeted him and he 
returned the greeting and said, "The thing which prevented me from 
returning the greeting was that I was praying." And at that time he 
was on his Rahila and his face was not towards the Qibla.
