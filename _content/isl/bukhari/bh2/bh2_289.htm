(freed slave of) Ziyad: I heard Abu Said Al-khudri narrating four 
things from the Prophet and I appreciated them very much. He said, 
conveying the words of the Prophet. 
<P>
(1) "A woman should not go on a two day journey except with her 
husband or a Dhi-Mahram. 
<P>
(2) No fasting is permissible on two days: 'Id-ul-Fitr and 
'Id-ul-Adha. 
<P>
(3) No prayer after two prayers, i.e. after the Fajr prayer till the 
sunrises and after the 'Asr prayer till the sun sets. 
<P>
(4) Do not prepare yourself for a journey except to three Mosques, 
i.e. Al-Masjid-AI-Haram, the Mosque of Aqsa (Jerusalem) and my 
Mosque."
