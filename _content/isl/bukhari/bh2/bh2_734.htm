<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:732</H3><P><I>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle proceeded from 'Arafat and dismounted at the 
mountainous pass and then urinated and performed a light ablution. I 
said to him, "(Shall we offer) the prayer?" He replied, "The prayer is
ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)." When he came to Al-Muzdalifa, he
performed a perfect ablution. Then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced
and he offended the Maghrib prayer and then every person made his 
camel kneel at his place; and then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced
and he offered the ('Isha') prayer and he did not offer any prayer in 
between them (i.e. Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers).
