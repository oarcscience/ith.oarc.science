### Hadith 2:671

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

When Allah's Apostle came to Mecca, he refused to enter the Ka'ba with
idols in it. He ordered (idols to be taken out). So they were taken out.
The people took out the pictures of Abraham and Ishmael holding Azlams
in their hands. Allah's Apostle said, "May Allah curse these people. By
Allah, both Abraham and Ishmael never did the game of chance with
Azlams." Then he entered the Ka'ba and said Takbir at its corners but
did not offer the prayer in it.
