<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:501</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
Some of the wives of the Prophet asked him, "Who amongst us will be 
the first to follow you (i.e. die after you)?" He said, "Whoever has 
the longest hand." So they started measuring their hands with a stick 
and Sauda's hand turned out to be the longest. (When Zainab bint Jahsh
died first of all in the caliphate of 'Umar), we came to know that the
long hand was a symbol of practicing charity, so she was the first to 
follow the Prophet and she used to love to practice charity. (Sauda 
died later in the caliphate of Muawiya).
