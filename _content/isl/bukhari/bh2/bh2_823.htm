<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:821</H3><P><I>Narrated Khalid bin Al-Harith:</I></P>
'Ubaidullah was asked about Al Mahassab. 'Ubaidullah narrated: Nafi' 
said, 'Allah's Apostles, 'Umar and Ibn 'Umar camped there." Nafi' 
added, "Ibn 'Umar used to offer the Zuhr and 'Asr prayers at it (i.e. 
Al-Mahassab)." I think he mentioned the Maghrib prayer also. I said, 
"I don't doubt about 'Isha' (i.e. he used to offer it there also), and
he used to sleep there for a while. He used to say, 'The Prophet used 
to do the same.' "
