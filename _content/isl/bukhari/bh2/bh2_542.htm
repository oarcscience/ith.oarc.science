On 'Id ul Fitr or 'Id ul Adha Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) went out to 
the Musalla. After finishing the prayer, he delivered the sermon and 
ordered the people to give alms. He said, "O people! Give alms." Then 
he went towards the women and said. "O women! Give alms, for I have 
seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women)."
The women asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What is the reason for it?" He 
replied, "O women! You curse frequently, and are ungrateful to your 
husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and 
religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious wise man 
astray." Then he left. And when he reached his house, Zainab, the wife
of Ibn Masud, came and asked permission to enter It was said, "O 
Allah's Apostle! It is Zainab." He asked, 'Which Zainab?" The reply 
was that she was the wife of Ibn Mas'ub. He said, "Yes, allow her to 
enter." And she was admitted. Then she said, "O Prophet of Allah! 
Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and 
intended to give it as alms, but Ibn Masud said that he and his 
children deserved it more than anybody else." The Prophet replied, 
"Ibn Masud had spoken the truth. Your husband and your children had 
more right to it than anybody else."
