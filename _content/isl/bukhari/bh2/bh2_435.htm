<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:434</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir:</I></P>
When the time of the Battle of Uhud approached, my father called me at
night and said, "I think that I will be the first amongst the 
companions of the Prophet to be martyred. I do not leave anyone after 
me dearer to me than you, except Allah's Apostle's soul and I owe some
debt and you should repay it and treat your sisters favorably (nicely 
and politely)." So in the morning he was the first to be martyred and 
was buried along with another (martyr). I did not like to leave him 
with the other (martyr) so I took him out of the grave after six 
months of his burial and he was in the same condition as he was on the
day of burial, except a slight change near his ear.
