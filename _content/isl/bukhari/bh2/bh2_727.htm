My father said, "(Before Islam) I was looking for my camel .." The 
same narration is told by a different sub-narrator. Jubair bin Mut'im 
said, "My camel was lost and I went out in search of it on the day of 
'Arafat, and I saw the Prophet standing in 'Arafat. I said to myself:

were called so, as they used to say, 'We are the people of Allah we 
shall not go out of the sanctuary). What has brought him here?"
