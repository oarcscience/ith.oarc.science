### Hadith 2:553

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar*

The Prophet said, "A man keeps on asking others for something till he
comes on the Day of Resurrection without any piece of flesh on his
face." The Prophet added, "On the Day of Resurrection, the Sun will come
near (to, the people) to such an extent that the sweat will reach up to
the middle of the ears, so, when all the people are in that state, they
will ask Adam for help, and then Moses, and then Muhammad (p.b.u.h) ."
The sub-narrator added "Muhammad will intercede with Allah to judge
amongst the people. He will proceed on till he will hold the ring of the
door (of Paradise) and then Allah will exalt him to Maqam Mahmud (the
privilege of intercession, etc.). And all the people of the gathering
will send their praises to Allah.
