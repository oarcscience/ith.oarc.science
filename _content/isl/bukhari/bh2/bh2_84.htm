The Prophet delivered the Khutba on the day of Nahr ('Id-ul-Adha) and 
said, "The first thing we should do on this day of ours is to pray and
then return and slaughter (our sacrifices). So anyone who does so he 
acted according to our Sunna; and whoever slaughtered before the 
prayer then it was just meat that he offered to his family and would 
not be considered as a sacrifice in any way. My uncle Abu Burda bin 
Niyyar got up and said, "O, Allah's Apostle! I slaughtered the 
sacrifice before the prayer but I have a young she-goat which is 
better than an older sheep." The Prophet said, "Slaughter it in lieu 
of the first and such a goat will not be considered as a sacrifice for
anybody else after you."
