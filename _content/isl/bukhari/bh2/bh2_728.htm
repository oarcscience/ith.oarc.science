<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:726</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Urwa:</I></P>
During the pre-lslamic period of Ignorance, the people used to perform
Tawaf of the Ka'ba naked except the Hums; and the Hums were Quraish 
and their offspring. The Hums used to give clothes to the men who 
would perform the Tawaf wearing them; and women (of the Hums) used to 
give clothes to the women who would perform the Tawaf wearing them. 
Those to whom the Hums did not give clothes would perform Tawaf round 
the Ka'ba naked. Most of the people used to go away (disperse) 
directly from 'Arafat but they (Hums) used to depart after staying at 
Al-Muzdalifa. 'Urwa added, "My father narrated that 'Aisha had said, 
'The following verses were revealed about the Hums: Then depart from 
the place whence all the people depart--(2.199) 'Urwa added, "They 
(the Hums) used to stay at Al-Muzdalifa and used to depart from there 
(to Mina) and so they were sent to 'Arafat (by Allah's order)."
