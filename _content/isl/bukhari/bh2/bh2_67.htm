<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:68</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) offered the Fajr prayer when it was still 
dark, then he rode and said, 'Allah Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. When we 
approach near to a nation, the most unfortunate is the morning of 
those who have been warned." The people came out into the streets 
saying, "Muhammad and his army." Allah's Apostle vanquished them by 
force and their warriors were killed; the children and women were 
taken as captives. Safiya was taken by Dihya Al-Kalbi and later she 
belonged to Allah's Apostle go who married her and her Mahr was her 
manumission.
