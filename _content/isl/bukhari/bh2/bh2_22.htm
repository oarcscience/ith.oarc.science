<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:23</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Umar:</I></P>
One of the wives of  Umar (bin Al-Khattab) used to offer the Fajr and 
the 'Isha' prayer in congregation in the Mosque. She was asked why she
had come out for the prayer as she knew that  Umar disliked it, and he
has great ghaira (self-respect). She replied, "What prevents him from 
stopping me from this act?" The other replied, "The statement of 
Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) : 'Do not stop Allah's women-slave from 
going to Allah s Mosques' prevents him."
