<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:216</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Imran bin Husain:</I></P>
(who had piles) I asked Allah's Apostle about the praying of a man 
while sitting. He said, "If he prays while standing it is better and 
he who prays while sitting gets half the reward of that who prays 
standing; and whoever prays while Lying gets half the reward of that 
who prays while sitting."
