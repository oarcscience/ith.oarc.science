### Hadith 2:736

*Narrated Salim:*

'Abdullah bin 'Umar used to send the weak among his family early to
Mina. So they used to depart from Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram (that is
Al-Muzdalifa) at night (when the moon had set) and invoke Allah as much
as they could, and then they would return (to Mina) before the Imam had
started from Al-Muzdalifa to Mina. So some of them would reach Mina at
the time of the Fajr prayer and some of them would come later. When they
reached Mina they would throw pebbles on the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Aqaba) Ibn
'Umar used to say, "Allah's Apostle gave the permission to them (weak
people) to do so."
