I witnessed the Prophet when he was delivering the sermon on the Day 
of Nahr. A man stood up and said, "I thought that such and such was to
be done before such and such. I got my hair shaved before 
slaughtering." (Another said), "I slaughtered the Hadi before doing 
the Rami." So, the people asked about many similar things. The Prophet
said, "Do it (now) and there is no harm in all these cases." Whenever 
the Prophet was asked about anything on that day, he replied, "Do it 
(now) and there is no harm in it."
