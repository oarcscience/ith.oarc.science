### Hadith 2:528

*Narrated Anas:*

Abu Bakr wrote to me what Allah had instructed His Apostle (p.b.u.h) to
do regarding the one who had to pay one Bint Makhad (i.e. one year-old
she-camel) as Zakat, and he did not have it but had got Bint Labun (two
year old she-camel). (He wrote that) it could be accepted from him as
Zakat, and the collector of Zakat would return him 20 Dirhams or two
sheep; and if the Zakat payer had not a Bint Makhad, but he had Ibn
Labun (a two year old he-camel) then it could be accepted as his Zakat,
but he would not be paid anything .
