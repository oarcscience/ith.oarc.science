'Ata' said, "I heard Jabir bin 'Abdullah saying, 'We never ate the 
meat of the Budn for more than three days of Mina. Later, the Prophet 
gave us permission by saying: 'Eat and take (meat) with you. So we ate
(some) and took (some) with us.' " I asked 'Ata', "Did Jabir say (that
they went on eating the meat) till they reached Medina?" 'Ata' 
replied, "No."
