<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:617</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abbas:</I></P>
The Prophet with his companions started from Medina after combing and 
oiling his hair and putting on two sheets of lhram (upper body cover 
and waist cover). He did not forbid anyone to wear any kind of sheets 
except the ones colored with saffron because they may leave the scent 
on the skin. And so in the early morning, the Prophet mounted his 
Mount while in Dhul-Hulaifa and set out till they reached Baida', 
where he and his companions recited Talbiya, and then they did the 
ceremony of Taqlid (which means to put the colored garlands around the
necks of the Budn (camels for sacrifice). And all that happened on the
25th of Dhul-Qa'da. And when he reached Mecca on the 4th of Dhul-Hijja
he performed the Tawaf round the Ka'ba and performed the Tawaf between
Safa and Marwa. And as he had a Badana and had garlanded it, he did 
not finish his Ihram. He proceeded towards the highest places of Mecca
near Al-Hujun and he was assuming the Ihram for Hajj and did not go 
near the Ka'ba after he performed Tawaf (round it) till he returned 
from 'Arafat. Then he ordered his companions to perform the Tawaf 
round the Ka'ba and then the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, and to cut short
the hair of their heads and to finish their Ihram. And that was only 
for those people who had not garlanded Budn. Those who had their wives
with them were permitted to contact them (have sexual intercourse), 
and similarly perfume and (ordinary) clothes were permissible for 
them.
