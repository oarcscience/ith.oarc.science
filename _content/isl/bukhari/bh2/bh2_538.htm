"YOU are going to people of a (Divine) Book. First of all invite them 
to worship Allah (alone) and when they come to know Allah, inform them
that Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers in every day and night; 
and if they start offering these prayers, inform them that Allah has

amongst them and given to the poor amongst them; and if they obey you 
in that, take Zakat from them and avoid (don't take) the best property
of the people as Zakat."
