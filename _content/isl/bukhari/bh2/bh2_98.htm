On the day of Nahr Allah's Apostle delivered the Khutba after the 'Id 
prayer and said, "Anyone who prayed like us and slaughtered the 
sacrifice like we did then he acted according to our (Nusuk) tradition
of sacrificing, and whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the 
prayer, then that was just mutton (i.e. not sacrifice)." Abu Burda bin
Naiyar stood up and said, "O Allah's Apostle! By Allah, I slaughtered 
my sacrifice before I offered the (Id) prayer and thought that today 
was the day of eating and drinking (non-alcoholic drinks) and so I 
made haste (in slaughtering) and ate and also fed my family and 
neighbors." Allah's Apostle said, "That was just mutton (not a 
sacrifice)." Then Abu Burda said, "I have a young she-goat and no 
doubt, it is better than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a 
sacrifice for me?" The Prophet replied, "Yes. But it will not be 
sufficient for anyone else (as a sacrifice), after you."
