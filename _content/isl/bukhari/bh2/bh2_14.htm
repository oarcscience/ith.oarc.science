AbdurRahman bin Abi Bakr came holding a Siwak with which he was 
cleaning his teeth. Allah's Apostle looked at him. I requested 
Abdur-Rahman to give the Siwak to me and after he gave it to me I 
divided it, chewed it and gave it to Allah's Apostle. Then he cleaned 
his teeth with it and (at that time) he was resting against my chest.
