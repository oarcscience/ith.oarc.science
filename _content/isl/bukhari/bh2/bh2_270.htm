<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:270</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amr:</I></P>
I heard Abu Ash-sha'tha' Jabir saying, "I heard Ibn Abbas saying, 'I 
offered with Allah's Apostle eight Rakat (of Zuhr and 'Asr prayers) 
together and seven Rakat (the Maghrib and the 'Isha' prayers) 
together.' " I said, "O Abu Ash-shatha! I think he must have prayed 
the Zuhr late and the 'Asr early; the 'Isha early and the Maghrib 
late." Abu Ash-sha'tha' said, "I also think so." (See 
Hadith No. 518 Vol. 1).
