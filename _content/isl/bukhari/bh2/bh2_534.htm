<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:533</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
Abu Bakr , wrote to me about the Zakat which Allah had ordered His 
Apostle to observe: Whoever had to pay Jahda (Jahda means a 
four-year-old she-camel) as Zakat from his herd of camels and he had 
not got one, and he had Hiqqa (three-year-old she-camel), that Hiqqa 
should be accepted from him along with two sheep if they were 
available or twenty Dirhams (one Durham equals about 1/4 Saudi Riyal) 
and whoever had to pay Hiqqa as Zakat and he had no Hiqqa but had a 
Jadha, the Jadha should be accepted from him, and the Zakat collector 
should repay him twenty Dirhams or two sheep; and whoever had to pay 
Hiqqa as Zakat and he had not got one, but had a Bint Labun 
(two-year-old she-camel), it should be accepted from him along with 
two sheep or twenty Dirhams; and whoever had to pay Bint Labun and had
a Hiqqa, that Hiqqa should be accepted from him and the Zakat 
collector should repay him twenty Dirhams or two sheep; and whoever 
had to pay Bint Labun and he had not got one but had a Bint Makhad 
(one-year-old she camel), that Bint Makhad should be accepted from him
along with twenty Dirhams or two sheep.
