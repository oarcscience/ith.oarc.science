<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:671</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</I></P>
When Allah's Apostle came to Mecca, he refused to enter the Ka'ba with
idols in it. He ordered (idols to be taken out). So they were taken 
out. The people took out the pictures of Abraham and Ishmael holding 
Azlams in their hands. Allah's Apostle said, "May Allah curse these 
people. By Allah, both Abraham and Ishmael never did the game of 
chance with Azlams." Then he entered the Ka'ba and said Takbir at its 
corners but did not offer the prayer in it.
