### Hadith 2:792

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr :*

Allah's Apostle stopped (for a while near the Jimar at Mina) during his
last Hajj and the people started asking him questions. A man said,
"Ignorantly I got my head shaved before slaughtering." The Prophet
replied, "Slaughter (now) and there is no harm in it." Another man said,
"Unknowingly I slaughtered the Hadi before doing the Rami." The Prophet
said, "Do Rami now and there is no harm in it." So, on that day, when
the Prophet was asked about anything (about the ceremonies of Hajj) done
before or after (its stated time) his reply was, "Do it (now) and there
is no harm."
