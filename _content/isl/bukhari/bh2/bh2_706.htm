Ibn 'Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year when Al-Hajjaj attacked
Ibn Az-Zubair. Somebody said to Ibn 'Umar, "There is a danger of an 
impending war between them." Ibn 'Umar said, "Verily, in Allah's 
Apostle you have a good example. (And if it happened as you say) then 
I would do the same as Allah's Apostle had done. I make you witness 
that I have decided to perform 'Umra." Then he set out and when he 
reached Al-Baida', he said, "The ceremonies of both Hajj and 'Umra are
similar. I make you witness that I have made Hajj compulsory for me 
along with 'Umra." He drove (to Mecca) a Hadi which he had bought from
(a place called) Qudaid and did not do more than that. He did not 
slaughter the Hadi or finish his Ihram, or shave or cut short his hair
till the day of slaughtering the sacrifices (10th Dhul-Hijja). Then he
slaughtered his Hadi and shaved his head and considered the first 
Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) as sufficient for Hajj and 'Umra. Ibn 'Umar 
said, "Allah's Apostle did the same."
