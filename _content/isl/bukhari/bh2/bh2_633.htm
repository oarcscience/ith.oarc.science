<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:631</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:</I></P>
' Aisha said, "We set out with Allah's Apostles in the months of Hajj,
and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in
a state of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif (a village six miles from 
Mecca). The Prophet then addressed his companions and said, "Anyone 
who has not got the Hadi and likes to do Umra instead of Hajj may do 
so (i.e. Hajj-al-Tamattu) and anyone who has got the Hadi should not 
finish the Ihram after performing ' Umra). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). Aisha
added, "The companions of the Prophet obeyed the above (order) and 
some of them (i.e. who did not have Hadi) finished their Ihram after 
Umra." Allah's Apostle and some of his companions were resourceful and
had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had 
to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, "Allah's 
Apostle came to me and saw me weeping and said, "What makes you weep, 
O Hantah?" I replied, "I have heard your conversation with your 
companions and I cannot perform the Umra." He asked, "What is wrong 
with you?' I replied, ' I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my 
menses).' He said, ' It will not harm you for you are one of the 
daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He 
has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and 
Allah may reward you that." Aisha further added, "Then we proceeded 
for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then 
I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka'ba." Aisha 
added, "I went along with the Prophet in his final departure (from 
Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and 
we too, dismounted with him." He called ' Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr 
and said to him, ' Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and
let her assume Ihram for ' Umra, and when you had finished ' Umra, 
return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return
to me.' " ' Aisha added, ' ' So we went out of the sanctuary of Mecca 
and after finishing from the ' Umra and the Tawaf we returned to the 
Prophet at dawn. He said, 'Have you performed the ' Umra?' We replied 
in the affirmative. So he announced the departure amongst his 
companions and the people set out for the journey, and the Prophet: 
too left for Medina.''
