<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:83</H3><P><I>Narrated Said bin Jubair:</I></P>
I was with Ibn  Umar when a spear head pierced the sole of his foot 
and his foot stuck to the paddle of the saddle and I got down and 
pulled his foot out, and that happened in Mina. Al-Hajjaj got the news
and came to enquire about his health and said, "Alas! If we could only
know the man who wounded you!" Ibn Umar said, "You are the one who 
wounded me." Al-Hajjaj said, "How is that?" Ibn  Umar said, "You have 
allowed the arms to be carried on a day on which nobody used to carry 
them and you allowed arms to be carried in the Haram even though it 
was not allowed before."
