<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:706</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Urwa:</I></P>
I asked 'Aisha : "How do you interpret the statement of Allah,. : 
Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of 
Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka'ba or performs 'Umra, 
it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and 
Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there 
is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." 
'Aisha said, "O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this 
interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should 
have been, 'It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf 
between them.' But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed 
concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol
called "Manat" which they used to worship at a place called 
Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram 
(for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between 
Safa and Marwa. 
<P>
When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) 
regarding it, saying, "O Allah's Apostle! We used to refrain from 
Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." So Allah revealed: 'Verily; (the 
mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.' " 
Aisha added, "Surely, Allah's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf 
between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between
them." Later on I ('Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin 'Abdur-Rahman (of 'Aisha's
narration) and he said, 'i have not heard of such information, but I 
heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom 'Aisha
mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to 
perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. 
<P>
When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka'ba and did not mention Safa
and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! We used 
to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the 
verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka'ba and has not mentioned Safa and 
Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' 
So Allah revealed: "Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols 
of Allah." Abu Bakr said, "It seems that this verse was revealed 
concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf 
between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and 
those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam 
they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf
of the Ka'ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later 
after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka'ba.'
