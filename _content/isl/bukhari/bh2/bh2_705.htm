'Abdullah bin 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and his riding animal entered the 
house of Ibn 'Umar. He (the son of Ibn 'Umar) said, "I fear that this 
year a battle might take place between the people and you might be 
prevented from going to the Ka'ba. I suggest that you should stay 
here." Ibn Umar said, "Once Allah's Apostle set out for the 
pilgrimage, and the pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the 
Ka'ba. So, if the people intervened between me and the Ka'ba, I would 
do the same as Allah's Apostle had done . . . "Verily, in Allah's 
Apostle you have a good example." Then he added, "I make you a witness
that I have intended to perform Hajj along with 'Umra." After arriving
at Mecca, Ibn 'Umar performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa).
