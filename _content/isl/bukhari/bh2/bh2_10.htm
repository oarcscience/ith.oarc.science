<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:11</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</I></P>
Umar bin Al-Khattab saw a silken cloak (being sold) at the gate of the
Mosque and said to Allah's Apostle, "I wish you would buy this to wear
on Fridays and also on occasions of the arrivals of the delegations." 
Allah's Apostle replied, "This will be worn by a person who will have 
no share (reward) in the Hereafter." Later on similar cloaks were 
given to Allah's Apostle and he gave one of them to 'Umar bin 
Al-Khattab. On that 'Umar said, "O Allah's Apostle! You have given me 
this cloak although on the cloak of Atarid (a cloak merchant who was 
selling that silken cloak at the gate of the mosque) you passed such 
and such a remark." Allah's Apostle replied, "I have not given you 
this to wear". And so 'Umar bin Al-Khattab gave it to his pagan 
brother in Mecca to wear.
