The Prophet collected every two martyrs of Uhud in one piece of cloth,
then he would ask, "Which of them had (knew) more of the Quran?" When 
one of them was pointed out for him, he would put that one first in

Resurrection." He ordered them to be buried with their blood on their 
bodies and they were neither washed nor was a funeral prayer offered
