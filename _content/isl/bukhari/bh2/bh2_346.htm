<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:345</H3><P><I>Narrated Um 'Atiyya</I></P>
Allah's Apostle came to us and we were giving a bath to his (dead) 
daughter and said, "Wash her three, five or more times with water and 
Sidr and sprinkle camphor on her at the end; and when you finish, 
notify me." So when we finished, we informed him and he gave us his 
waist-sheet and told us to shroud her in it. Aiyub said that Hafsa 
narrated to him a narration similar to that of Muhammad in which it 
was said that the bath was to be given for an odd number of times, and
the numbers 3, 5 or 7 were mentioned. It was also said that they were 
to start with the right side and with the parts which were washed in 
ablution, and that Um 'Atiyya also mentioned, "We combed her hair and 
divided them in three braids."
