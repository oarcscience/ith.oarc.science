<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:499</H3><P><I>Narrated Aisha:</I></P>
A lady along with her two daughters came to me asking (for some alms),
but she found nothing with me except one date which I gave to her and 
she divided it between her two daughters, and did not eat anything 
herself, and then she got up and went away. Then the Prophet came in 
and I informed him about this story. He said, "Whoever is put to trial
by these daughters and he treats them generously (with benevolence) 
then these daughters will act as a shield for him from Hell-Fire." 
(See Hadith No. 24, Vol. 8).
