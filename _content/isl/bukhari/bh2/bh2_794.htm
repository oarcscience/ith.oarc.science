<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:792</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr :</I></P>
Allah's Apostle stopped (for a while near the Jimar at Mina) during 
his last Hajj and the people started asking him questions. A man said,
"Ignorantly I got my head shaved before slaughtering." The Prophet 
replied, "Slaughter (now) and there is no harm in it." Another man 
said, "Unknowingly I slaughtered the Hadi before doing the Rami." The 
Prophet said, "Do Rami now and there is no harm in it." So, on that 
day, when the Prophet was asked about anything (about the ceremonies 
of Hajj) done before or after (its stated time) his reply was, "Do it 
(now) and there is no harm."
