When the time of the death of Abu Talib approached, Allah's Apostle 
went to him and found Abu Jahl bin Hisham and 'Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya
bin Al-Mughira by his side. Allah's Apostle said to Abu Talib, "O 
uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, a sentence 
with which I shall be a witness (i.e. argue) for you before Allah. Abu
Jahl and 'Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said, "O Abu Talib! Are you going to
denounce the religion of Abdul Muttalib?" Allah's Apostle kept on 
inviting Abu Talib to say it (i.e. 'None has the right to be 
worshipped but Allah') while they (Abu Jahl and Abdullah) kept on 
repeating their statement till Abu Talib said as his last statement 
that he was on the religion of Abdul Muttalib and refused to say, 
'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.' (Then Allah's Apostle
said, "I will keep on asking Allah's forgiveness for you unless I am 
forbidden (by Allah) to do so." So Allah revealed (the verse) 
concerning him (i.e. It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who 
believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans 
even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that 
they are companions of the fire (9.113).
