The Prophet (p.b.u.h) offered the funeral prayer of a man one night 
after he was buried, he and his companions stood up (for the Prayer). 
He had asked them about him before standing, saying, "Who is this?" 
They said, "He is so and so and was buried last night." So all of them
offered the funeral prayer.
