<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:449</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:</I></P>
I came to Medina when an epidemic had broken out. While I was sitting 
with 'Umar bin Al-Khattab a funeral procession passed by and the 
people praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed to 
him." And another funeral procession passed by and the people praised 
the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed to him." A third 
(funeral procession) passed by and the people spoke badly of the 
deceased. He said, "It has been affirmed to him." I (Abu Al-Aswad) 
asked, "O chief of the believers! What has been affirmed?" He replied,
"I said the same as the Prophet had said, that is: if four persons 
testify the piety of a Muslim, Allah will grant him Paradise." We 
asked, "If three persons testify his piety?" He (the Prophet) replied,
"Even three." Then we asked, "If two?" He replied, "Even two." We did 
not ask him regarding one witness.
