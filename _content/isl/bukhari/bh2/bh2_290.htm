'Abdullah bin Abbas said that he had passed a night in the house of 
Maimuna the mother of the faithful believers , who was his aunt. He 
said, "I slept across the bed, and Allah's Apostle along with his wife
slept lengthwise. Allah's Apostle slept till mid-night or slightly 
before or after it. Then Allah's Apostle woke up, sat, and removed the
traces of sleep by rubbing his hands over his face. Then he recited 
the last ten verses of Surat-Al Imran (2). Then he went towards a 
hanging leather water-container and performed a perfect ablution and 
then stood up for prayer." 'Abdullah bin Abbas added, "I got up and 
did the same as Allah's Apostle had done and then went and stood by 
his side. Allah's Apostle then put his right hand over my head and 
caught my right ear and twisted it. He offered two Rakat, then two 
Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat 
and then offered one Raka Witr. Then he lay down till the Muadh-dhin 
came and then he prayed two light Rakat and went out and offered the 
early morning (Fajr) prayer."
