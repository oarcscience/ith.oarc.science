The Prophet fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina, 
Al-Juhfa, for the people of Sham, Yalamlam for the people of Yemen, 
and Qarn for the people of Najd. And these Mawaqlt are for those 
living at those very places, and besides them for those who come 
through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and Umra; 
and whoever is living inside these places can assume lhram from his 
own dwelling place, and the people of Mecca can assume lhram from 
Mecca.
