<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:251</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
A woman from the tribe of Bani Asad was sitting with me and Allah's 
Apostle (p.b.u.h) came to my house and said, "Who is this?" I said, 
"(She is) So and so. She does not sleep at night because she is 
engaged in prayer." The Prophet said disapprovingly: Do (good) deeds 
which is within your capacity as Allah never gets tired of giving 
rewards till you get tired of doing good deeds."
