Hafsa bint Sirin said, "On Id we used to forbid our girls to go out 
for 'Id prayer. A lady came and stayed at the palace of Bani Khalaf 
and I went to her. She said, 'The husband of my sister took part in 
twelve holy battles along with the Prophet and my sister was with her 
husband in six of them. My sister said that they used to nurse the 
sick and treat the wounded. Once she asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! If a 
woman has no veil, is there any harm if she does not come out (on 'Id 
day)?' The Prophet said, 'Her companion should let her share her veil 
with her, and the women should participate in the good deeds and in 
the religious gatherings of the believers.' " Hafsa added, "When 
Um-'Atiya came, I went to her and asked her, 'Did you hear anything 
about so-and-so?' Um-'Atlya said, 'Yes, let my father be sacrificed 
for the Prophet (p.b.u.h). (And whenever she mentioned the name of the
Prophet she always used to say, 'Let my father be' sacrificed for 
him). He said, 'Virgin mature girls staying often screened (or said, 
'Mature girls and virgins staying often screened--Aiyub is not sure as
which was right) and menstruating women should come out (on the 'Id 
day). But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla. 
And all the women should participate in the good deeds and in the 
religious gatherings of the believers'." Hafsa said, "On that I said 
to Um-'Atiya, 'Also those who are menstruating?' " Um-'Atiya replied, 
"Yes. Do they not present themselves at 'Arafat and elsewhere?".
