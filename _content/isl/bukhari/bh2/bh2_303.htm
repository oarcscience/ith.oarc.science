<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:301</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, "Satan came in front of 
me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand 
on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of 
the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. 
Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow 
on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' Then 
Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."
