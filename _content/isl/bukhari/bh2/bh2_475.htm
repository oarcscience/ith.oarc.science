<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:474</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Urwa:</I></P>
When the wall fell on them (i.e. graves) during the caliphate of 
Al-Walid bin 'Abdul Malik, the people started repairing it, and a foot
appeared to them. The people got scared and thought that it was the 
foot of the Prophet. No-one could be found who could tell them about 
it till I ('Urwa) said to them, "By Allah, this is not the foot of the
Prophet but it is the foot of Umar." Aisha narrated that she made a 
will to 'Abdullah bin Zubair, "Do not bury me with them (the Prophet 
and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the 
Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon 
as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet)."
