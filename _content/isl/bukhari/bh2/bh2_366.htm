<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:365</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibrahim:</I></P>
Once a meal was brought to 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf and he was fasting. 
He said, "Mustab bin 'Umar was martyred and he was better than I and 
was shrouded in his Burd and when his head was covered with it, his 
legs became bare, and when his legs were covered his head got 
uncovered. Hamza was martyred and was better than I. Now the worldly 
wealth have been bestowed upon us (or said a similar thing). No doubt,
I fear that the rewards of my deeds might have been given earlier in 
this world." Then he started weeping and left his food.
