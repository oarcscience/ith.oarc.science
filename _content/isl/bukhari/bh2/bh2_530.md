### Hadith 2:529

*Narrated Ibn Abbas :*

I am a witness that Allah's Apostle offered the Id prayer before
delivering the sermon and then he thought that the women would not be
able to hear him (because of the distance), so he went to them along
with Bilal who was spreading his garment. The Prophet advised and
ordered them to give in charity. So the women started giving their
ornaments (in charity). (The sub-narrator Aiyub pointed towards his ears
and neck meaning that they gave ornaments from those places such as
ear-rings and necklaces.)
