<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:448</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik, :</I></P>
A funeral procession passed and the people praised the deceased. The 
Prophet said, "It has been affirmed to him." Then another funeral 
procession passed and the people spoke badly of the deceased. The 
Prophet said, "It has been affirmed to him". 'Umar bin Al-Khattab 
asked (Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ), "What has been affirmed?" He 
replied, "You praised this, so Paradise has been affirmed to him; and 
you spoke badly of this, so Hell has been affirmed to him. You people 
are Allah's witnesses on earth."
