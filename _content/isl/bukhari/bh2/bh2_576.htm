The Prophet said, "A man from Bani Israel asked someone from Bani 
Israel to give him a loan of one thousand Dinars and the later gave it
to him. The debtor went on a voyage (when the time for the payment of 
the debt became due) but he did not find a boat, so he took a piece of
wood and bored it and put 1000 diners in it and threw it into the sea.
The creditor went out and took the piece of wood to his family to be 
used as fire-wood." (See Hadith No. 488 B, Vol. 3). And the Prophet 
narrated the narration (and said), "When he sawed the wood, he found 
his money."
