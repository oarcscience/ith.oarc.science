<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:69</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin  Umar:</I></P>
Umar bought a silk cloak from the market, took it to Allah's Apostle 
and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Take it and adorn yourself with it 
during the 'Id and when the delegations visit you." Allah's Apostle 
(p.b.u.h) replied, "This dress is for those who have no share (in the 
Hereafter)." After a long period Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent to  
Umar a cloak of silk brocade.  Umar came to Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) 
with the cloak and said, "O Allah's Apostle! You said that this dress 
was for those who had no share (in the Hereafter); yet you have sent 
me this cloak." Allah's Apostle said to him, "Sell it and fulfill your
needs by it."
