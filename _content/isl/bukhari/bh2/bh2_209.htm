<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:210</H3><P><I>Narrated Az-Zuhri:</I></P>
Salim told me, "'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, 'I saw Allah's Apostle 
delaying the Maghrib prayer till he offered it along with the Isha 
prayer whenever he was in a hurry during the journey.' " Salim said, 
"Abdullah bin Umar used to do the same whenever he was in a hurry 
during the journey. After making the call for Iqama, for the Maghrib 
prayer he used to offer three Rakat and then perform Tasllm. After 
waiting for a short while, he would pronounce the Iqama for the 'Isha'
prayer and offer two Rakat and perform Taslim. He never prayed any 
Nawafil in between the two prayers or after the 'Isha' prayers till he
got up in the middle of the night (for Tahajjud prayer)."
