<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:739</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah:</I></P>
(the slave of Asma') During the night of Jam', Asma' got down at 
Al-Muzdalifa and stood up for (offering) the prayer and offered the 
prayer for some time and then asked, "O my son! Has the moon set?" I 
replied in the negative and she again prayed for another period and 
then asked, "Has the moon set?" I replied, "Yes." So she said that we 
should set out (for Mina), and we departed and went on till she threw 
pebbles at the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Aqaba) and then she returned to her 
dwelling place and offered the morning prayer. I asked her, "O you! I 
think we have come (to Mina) early in the night." She replied, "O my 
son! Allah's Apostle gave permission to the women to do so."
