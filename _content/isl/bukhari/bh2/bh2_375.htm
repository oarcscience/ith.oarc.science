<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:374</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
We were (in the funeral procession) of one of the daughters of the 
Prophet and he was sitting by the side of the grave. I saw his eyes 
shedding tears. He said, "Is there anyone among you who did not have 
sexual relations with his wife last night?" Abu Talha replied in the 
affirmative. And so the Prophet told him to get down in the grave. And
so he got down in her grave.
