The Prophet said, "When it is a Friday, the angels stand at the gate 
of the mosque and keep on writing the names of the persons coming to 
the mosque in succession according to their arrivals. The example of 
the one who enters the mosque in the earliest hour is that of one 
offering a camel (in sacrifice). The one coming next is like one 
offering a cow and then a ram and then a chicken and then an egg 
respectively. When the Imam comes out (for Jumua prayer) they (i.e. 
angels) fold their papers and listen to the Khutba."
