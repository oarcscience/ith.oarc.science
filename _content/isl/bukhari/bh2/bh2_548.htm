<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:547</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira</I></P>
Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered (a person) to collect Zakat, and 
that person returned and told him that Ibn Jamil, Khalid bin Al-Walid,
and Abbas bin 'Abdul Muttalib had refused to give Zakat." The Prophet 
said, "What made Ibn Jamll refuse to give Zakat though he was a poor 
man, and was made wealthy by Allah and His Apostle ? But you are 
unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping his armor for 
Allah's Cause (for Jihad). As for Abbas bin 'Abdul Muttalib, he is the
uncle of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) and Zakat is compulsory on him and 
he should pay it double."
