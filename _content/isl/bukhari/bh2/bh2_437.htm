<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:436</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
The Prophet collected every two martyrs of Uhud (in one grave) and 
then he would ask, "Which of them knew the Quran more?" And if one of 
them was pointed out for him as having more knowledge, he would put 
him first in the Lahd. The Prophet said, "I will be a witness on these
on the Day of Resurrection." Then he ordered them to be buried with 
their blood on their bodies and he did not have them washed.
