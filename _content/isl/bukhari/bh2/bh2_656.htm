<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:654</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
I asked the Prophet whether the round wall (near Ka'ba) was part of 
the Ka'ba. The Prophet replied in the affirmative. I further said, 
"What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the 
building of the Ka'ba?" He said, "Don't you see that your people 
(Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the 
building of Ka'ba)?" I asked, "What about its gate? Why is it so 
high?" He replied, "Your people did this so as to admit into it 
whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people 
not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have 
recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike
it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the 
building of the Ka'ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level 
of the ground."
