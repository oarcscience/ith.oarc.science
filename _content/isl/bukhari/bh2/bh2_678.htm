Ibn 'Umar. said, "I have never missed the touching of these two stones
of Ka'ba (the Black Stone and the Yemenite Corner) both in the 
presence and the absence of crowds, since I saw the Prophet touching 
them." I asked Nafi': "Did Ibn 'Umar use to walk between the two 
Corners?" Nafi' replied, "He used to walk in order that it might be 
easy for him to touch it (the Corner Stone)."
