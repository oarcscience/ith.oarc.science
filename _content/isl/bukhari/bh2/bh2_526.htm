<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:525</H3><P><I>Narrated Um 'Atiyya:</I></P>
A sheep was sent to me (Nusaiba Al-Ansariya) (in charity) and I sent 
some of it to 'Aisha. The Prophet asked 'Aisha for something to eat. 
'Aisha replied that there was nothing except what Nusaiba Al-Ansariya 
had sent of that sheep. The Prophet said to her, "Bring it as it has 
reached its place."
