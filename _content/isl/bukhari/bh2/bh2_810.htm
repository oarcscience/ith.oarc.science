<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:808</H3><P><I>Narrated Salim bin Abdullah:</I></P>
'Abdullah bin 'Umar used to do Rami of the Jamrat-ud-Dunya with seven 
small pebbles and used to recite Takbir on throwing each stone. He, 
then, would proceed further till he reached the level ground, where he
would stay for a long time, facing the Qibla to invoke (Allah) while 
raising his hands. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Wusta 
similarly and would go to the left towards the level ground, where he 
would stand for a long time facing the Qibla to invoke (Allah) while 
raising his hands. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-'Aqaba from 
the middle of the valley, but he would not stay by it. Ibn 'Umar used 
to say, "I saw Allah's Apostle doing like that."
