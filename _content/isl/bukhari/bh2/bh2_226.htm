<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:227</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Ali bin Abi Talib</I></P>
One night Allah's Apostle came to me and Fatima, the daughter of the 
Prophet and asked, "Won't you pray (at night)?" I said, "O Allah's 
Apostle! Our souls are in the hands of Allah and if He wants us to get

saying anything and I heard that he was hitting his thigh and saying, 
"But man is more quarrelsome than anything." (18.54)
