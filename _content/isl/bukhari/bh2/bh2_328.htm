The news about the differences amongst the people of Bani'Amr bin 'Auf
reached Allah's Apostle and so he went to them along with some of his 
companions to affect a reconciliation between them. Allah's Apostle 
was delayed there, and the time of the prayer was due. Bilal went to 
Abu Bakr and said to him, "Allah's Apostle has been delayed (there) 
and the time of prayer is due. So will you lead the people in prayer?"
Abu Bakr said, "Yes, if you wish." Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu 
Bakr, went forward and said Takbir for the people. In the mean-time 
Allah's Apostle came crossing the rows (of the praying people) and 
stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, 
would never glance side-ways in his prayer but when the people clapped
much he looked back and (saw) Allah's Apostle . Allah's Apostle 
beckoned him to carry on the prayer. Abu Bakr raised his hands and 
thanked Allah, and retreated till he reached the (first) row. Allah's 
Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he 
completed the prayer he faced the people and said, "O people! Why did 
you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the 
prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever amongst you comes 
across something in the prayer should say, 'Subhan-Allah' for there is
none who will not turn round on hearing him saying Subhan-Allah. O 
Ab-u Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer 
when I beckoned you to do so?" Abu Bakr replied, "How dare the son of 
Abu Quhafa lead the prayer in the presence of Allah's Apostle ?"
