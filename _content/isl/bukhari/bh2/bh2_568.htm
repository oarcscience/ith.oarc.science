<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:567</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Umar:</I></P>
Once I gave a horse in Allah's Cause (in charity) but that person did 
not take care of it. I intended to buy it, as I thought he would sell 
it at a low price. So, I asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h) about it. He 
said, "Neither buy, nor take back your alms which you have given, even
if the seller were willing to sell it for one Dirham, for he who takes
back his alms is like the one who swallows his own vomit."
