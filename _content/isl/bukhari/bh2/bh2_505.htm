<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:504</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Seven people will be shaded by Allah 
under His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His. 
They are: 
<P>
(1) a just ruler; 
<P>
(2) a young man who has been brought up in the worship of Allah, (i.e.
worship Allah (Alone) sincerely from his childhood), 
<P>
(3) a man whose heart is attached to the mosque (who offers the five 
compulsory congregational prayers in the mosque); 
<P>
(4) two persons who love each other only for Allah's sake and they 
meet and part in Allah's cause only; 
<P>
(5) a man who refuses the call of a charming woman of noble birth for 
an illegal sexual intercourse with her and says: I am afraid of Allah;
<P>
(6) a person who practices charity so secretly that his left hand does
not know what his right hand has given (i.e. nobody knows how much he 
has given in charity). 
<P>
(7) a person who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes get flooded
with tears."
