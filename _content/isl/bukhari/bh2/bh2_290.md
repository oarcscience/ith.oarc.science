### Hadith 2:289

*Narrated Kuraib Maula Ibn Abbas:*

'Abdullah bin Abbas said that he had passed a night in the house of
Maimuna the mother of the faithful believers , who was his aunt. He
said, "I slept across the bed, and Allah's Apostle along with his wife
slept lengthwise. Allah's Apostle slept till mid-night or slightly
before or after it. Then Allah's Apostle woke up, sat, and removed the
traces of sleep by rubbing his hands over his face. Then he recited the
last ten verses of Surat-Al Imran (2). Then he went towards a hanging
leather water-container and performed a perfect ablution and then stood
up for prayer." 'Abdullah bin Abbas added, "I got up and did the same as
Allah's Apostle had done and then went and stood by his side. Allah's
Apostle then put his right hand over my head and caught my right ear and
twisted it. He offered two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then
two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat and then offered one Raka
Witr. Then he lay down till the Muadh-dhin came and then he prayed two
light Rakat and went out and offered the early morning (Fajr) prayer."
