<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:297</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
While Abu Bakr was leading the people in the morning prayer on a 
Monday, the Prophet came towards them suddenly having lifted the 
curtain of 'Aisha's house, and looked at them as they were standing in
rows and smiled. Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah's 
Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the 
Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to 
see the Prophet. The Prophet waved his hand to them to complete their 
prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The 
Prophet expired on that very day.
