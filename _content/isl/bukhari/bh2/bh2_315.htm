Allah's Apostle said, "When the Adhan for the prayer is pronounced, 
then Satan takes to his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the
Adhan and when the Muadh-dhin finishes, he comes back; and when the 
Iqama is pronounced he again takes to his heels and when it is 
finished, he again comes back and continues reminding the praying 
person of things that he used not to remember when not in prayer till 
he forgets how much he has prayed." Abu Salama bin 'Abdur-Rahman said,
"If anyone of you has such a thing (forgetting the number of Rakat he 
has prayed) he should perform two prostrations of Sahu (i.e. 
forgetfulness) while sitting." Abu Salama narrates this from Abu 
Huraira.
