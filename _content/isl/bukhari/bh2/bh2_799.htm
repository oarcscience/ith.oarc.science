<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:797</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Bakra:</I></P>
The Prophet delivered to us a sermon on the Day of Nahr. He said, "Do 
you know what is the day today?" We said, "Allah and His Apostle know 
better." He remained silent till we thought that he might give that 
day another name. He said, "Isn't it the Day of Nahr?" We said, "It 
is." He further asked, "Which month is this?" We said, "Allah and His 
Apostle know better." He remained silent till we thought that he might
give it another name. He then said, "Isn't it the month of 
Dhul-Hijja?" We replied: "Yes! It is." He further asked, "What town is
this?" We replied, "Allah and His Apostle know it better." He remained
silent till we thought that he might give it another name. He then 
said, "Isn't it the forbidden (Sacred) town (of Mecca)?" We said, 
"Yes. It is." He said, "No doubt, your blood and your properties are 
sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this 
month of yours, in this town of yours, till the day you meet your 
Lord. No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Allah's message to you? They said, 
"Yes." He said, "O Allah! Be witness. So it is incumbent upon those 
who are present to convey it (this information) to those who are 
absent because the informed one might comprehend it (what I have said)
better than the present audience, who will convey it to him. Beware! 
Do not renegade (as) disbelievers after me by striking the necks 
(cutting the throats) of one another."
