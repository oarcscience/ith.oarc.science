### Hadith 2:11

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:*

Umar bin Al-Khattab saw a silken cloak (being sold) at the gate of the
Mosque and said to Allah's Apostle, "I wish you would buy this to wear
on Fridays and also on occasions of the arrivals of the delegations."
Allah's Apostle replied, "This will be worn by a person who will have no
share (reward) in the Hereafter." Later on similar cloaks were given to
Allah's Apostle and he gave one of them to 'Umar bin Al-Khattab. On that
'Umar said, "O Allah's Apostle! You have given me this cloak although on
the cloak of Atarid (a cloak merchant who was selling that silken cloak
at the gate of the mosque) you passed such and such a remark." Allah's
Apostle replied, "I have not given you this to wear". And so 'Umar bin
Al-Khattab gave it to his pagan brother in Mecca to wear.
