Allah's Apostle distributed something (from the resources of Zakat) 
amongst a group of people while I was sitting amongst them, but he 
left a man whom I considered the best of the lot. So, I went up to 
Allah's Apostle and asked him secretly, "Why have you left that 
person? By Allah! I consider him a believer." The Prophet said, "Or 
merely a Muslim (Who surrender to Allah)." I remained quiet for a 
while but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew 
about him. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that person? 
By Allah! I consider him a believer. " The Prophet said, "Or merely a 
Muslim." I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my 
question because of what I knew about him. I said, "O Allah's Apostle!
Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him a believer." 
The Prophet said, "Or merely a Muslim." Then Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h)
said, "I give to a person while another is dearer to me, for fear that
he may be thrown in the Hell-fire on his face (by renegating from 
Islam)."
