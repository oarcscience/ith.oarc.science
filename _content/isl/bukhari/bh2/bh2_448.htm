When 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul died, Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) was 
called upon to offer his funeral prayer. When Allah's Apostle stood up
to offer the prayer, I got up quickly and said, "O Allah's Apostle! 
Are you going to pray for Ibn Ubai and he said so and so on such and 
such occasions?" And started mentioning all that he had said. Allah's 
Apostle smiled and said, "O 'Umar! Go away from me." When I talked too
much he said, "I have been given the choice and so I have chosen (to 
offer the prayer). Had I known that he would be forgiven by asking for
Allah's forgiveness for more than seventy times, surely I would have 
done so." ('Umar added): Allah's Apostle offered his funeral prayer 
and returned and after a short while the two verses of Surat Bara' 
were revealed: i.e. "And never (O Muhammad) pray for any of them who 
dies . . . (to the end of the verse) rebellion (9.84)" -- ('Umar 
added), "Later I astonished at my daring before Allah's Apostle on 
that day. And Allah and His Apostle know better."
