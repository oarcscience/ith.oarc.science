A person died and Allah's Apostle used to visit him. He died at night 
and (the people) buried him at night. In the morning they informed the
Prophet (about his death). He said, "What prevented you from informing
me?" They replied, "It was night and it was a dark night and so we 
disliked to trouble you." The Prophet went to his grave and offered 
the (funeral) prayer.
