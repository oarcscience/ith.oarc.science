### Hadith 2:708

*Narrated 'Amr bin Dinar:*

We asked Ibn 'Umar whether a man who, while performing 'Umra, had
performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba; and had not yet performed Tawaf between
Safa and Marwa, could have sexual relation with his wife, Ibn 'Umar
replied "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) reached Mecca and performed the seven
rounds (of Tawaf) of the Ka'ba and then offered a two-Rakat prayer
behind Maqam ibrahim and then performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf)
between Safa and Marwa." He added, "Verily! In Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h)
you have a good example." We asked Jabir bin 'Abdullah (the same
question) and he said, "He (that man) should not come near (his wife)
till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."
