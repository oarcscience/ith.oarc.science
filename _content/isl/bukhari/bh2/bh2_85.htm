The Prophet said, "No good deeds done on other days are superior to 
those done on these (first ten days of Dhul Hijja)." Then some 
companions of the Prophet said, "Not even Jihad?" He replied, "Not 
even Jihad, except that of a man who does it by putting himself and 
his property in danger (for Allah's sake) and does not return with any
of those things."
