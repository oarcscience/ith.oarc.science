<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:485</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "(On the Day of Resurrection) camels will come to 
their owner in the best state of health they have ever had (in the 
world), and if he had not paid their Zakat (in the world) then they 
would tread him with their feet; and similarly, sheep will come to 
their owner in the best state of health they have ever had in the 
world, and if he had not paid their Zakat, then they would tread him 
with their hooves and would butt him with their horns." The Prophet 
added, "One of their rights is that they should be milked while water 
is kept in front of them." The Prophet added, "I do not want anyone of
you to come to me on the Day of Resurrection, carrying over his neck a
sheep that will be bleating. Such a person will (then) say, 'O 
Muhammad! (please intercede for me,) I will say to him. 'I can't help 
you, for I conveyed Allah's Message to you.' Similarly, I do not want 
anyone of you to come to me carrying over his neck a camel that will 
be grunting. Such a person (then) will say "O Muhammad! (please 
intercede for me)." I will say to him, "I can't help you for I 
conveyed Allah's message to you."
