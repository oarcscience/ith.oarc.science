I heard Anas bin Malik saying, "On a Friday a person entered the main 
Mosque through the gate facing the pulpit while Allah's Apostle was 
delivering the Khutba. The man stood in front of Allah's Apostle and 
said, 'O Allah's Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are 
cut off; so please pray to Allah for rain.' " Anas added, "Allah's 
Apostle (p.b.u.h) raised both his hands and said, 'O Allah! Bless us 
with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain!' 
" Anas added, "By Allah, we could not see any trace of cloud in the 
sky and there was no building or a house between us and (the mountains
of) Sila." Anas added, "A heavy cloud like a shield appeared from 
behind it (i.e. Sila' Mountain). When it came in the middle of the 
sky, it spread and then rained." Anas further said, "By Allah! We 
could not see the sun for a week. Next Friday a person entered through
the same gate and at that time Allah's Apostle was delivering the 
Friday's Khutba. The man stood in front of him and said, 'O Allah's 
Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off, please 
pray to Allah to with-hold rain.' " Anas added, "Allah's Apostle I 
raised both his hands and said, 'O Allah! Round about us and not on 
us. O Allah! On the plateaus, on the mountains, on the hills, in the 
valleys and on the places where trees grow.' So the rain stopped and 
we came out walking in the sun." Sharik asked Anas whether it was the 
same person who had asked for the rain (the last Friday). Anas replied
that he did not know.
