### Hadith 2:308

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

Allah's Apostle sent me for some job and when I had finished it I
returned and came to the Prophet and greeted him but he did not return
my greeting. So I felt so sorry that only Allah knows it and I said to
myself,, 'Perhaps Allah's Apostle is angry because I did not come
quickly, then again I greeted him but he did not reply. I felt even more
sorry than I did the first time. Again I greeted him and he returned the
greeting and said, "The thing which prevented me from returning the
greeting was that I was praying." And at that time he was on his Rahila
and his face was not towards the Qibla.
