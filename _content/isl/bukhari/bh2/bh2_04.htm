<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:5</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said:</I></P>
I testify that Allah's Apostle said, "The taking of a bath on Friday 
is compulsory for every male Muslim who has attained the age of 
puberty and (also) the cleaning of his teeth with Siwak, and the using
of perfume if it is available."  Amr (a sub-narrator) said, "I confirm
that the taking of a bath is compulsory, but as for the Siwak and the 
using of perfume, Allah knows better whether it is obligatory or not, 
but according to the Hadith it is as above.")
