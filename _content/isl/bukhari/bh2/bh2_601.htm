people of Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; Qarn-al-Manazil for
the people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen; and these 
Mawaqit are for the people at those very places, and besides them for 
those who come thorough those places with the intention of performing 
Hajj and 'Umra; and whoever is living within these boundaries can 
assume lhram from the place he starts, and the people of Mecca can 
assume Ihram from Mecca.
