<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:190</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdur Rahman bin Yazid:</I></P>
We offered a four Rakat prayer at Mina behind Ibn 'Affan . 'Abdullah 
bin Masud was informed about it. He said sadly, "Truly to Allah we 
belong and truly to Him we shall return." And added, "I prayed two 
Rakat with Allah's Apostle at Mina and similarly with Abu Bakr and 
with 'Umar (during their caliphates)." He further said, "May I be 
lucky enough to have two of the four Rakat accepted (by Allah)."
