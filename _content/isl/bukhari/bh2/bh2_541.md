### Hadith 2:540

*Narrated Ishaq bin 'Abdullah bin Al Talha:*

I heard Anas bin Malik saying, "Abu Talha had more property of date-palm
trees gardens than any other amongst the Ansar in Medina and the most
beloved of them to him was Bairuha garden, and it was in front of the
Mosque of the Prophet . Allah's Apostle used to go there and used to
drink its nice water." Anas added, "When these verses were
revealed:--'By no means shall you Attain righteousness unless You spend
(in charity) of that Which you love. ' (3.92) Abu Talha said to Allah's
Apostle 'O Allah's Apostle! Allah, the Blessed, the Superior says: By no
means shall you attain righteousness, unless you spend (in charity) of
that which you love. And no doubt, Bairuha' garden is the most beloved
of all my property to me. So I want to give it in charity in Allah's
Cause. I expect its reward from Allah. O Allah's Apostle! Spend it where
Allah makes you think it feasible.' On that Allah's Apostle said,
'Bravo! It is useful property. I have heard what you have said (O Abu
Talha), and I think it would be proper if you gave it to your Kith and
kin.' Abu Talha said, I will do so, O Allah's Apostle.' Then Abu Talha
distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins."
