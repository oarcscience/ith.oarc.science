### Hadith 2:537

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

When Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent Muadh to Yemen, he said (to him),
"YOU are going to people of a (Divine) Book. First of all invite them to
worship Allah (alone) and when they come to know Allah, inform them that
Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers in every day and night; and if
they start offering these prayers, inform them that Allah has enjoined
on them, the Zakat. And it is to be taken from the rich amongst them and
given to the poor amongst them; and if they obey you in that, take Zakat
from them and avoid (don't take) the best property of the people as
Zakat."
