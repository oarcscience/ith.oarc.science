<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:502</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "A man said that he would give 
something in charity. He went out with his object of charity and 
unknowingly gave it to a thief. Next morning the people said that he 
had given his object of charity to a thief. (On hearing that) he said,
"O Allah! All the praises are for you. I will give alms again." And so
he again went out with his alms and (unknowingly) gave it to an 
adulteress. Next morning the people said that he had given his alms to
an adulteress last night. The man said, "O Allah! All the praises are 
for you. (I gave my alms) to an adulteress. I will give alms again." 
So he went out with his alms again and (unknowingly) gave it to a rich
person. (The people) next morning said that he had given his alms to a
wealthy person. He said, "O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I had
given alms) to a thief, to an adulteress and to a wealthy man." Then 
someone came and said to him, "The alms which you gave to the thief, 
might make him abstain from stealing, and that given to the adulteress
might make her abstain from illegal sexual intercourse (adultery), and
that given to the wealthy man might make him take a lesson from it and
spend his wealth which Allah has given him, in Allah's cause."
