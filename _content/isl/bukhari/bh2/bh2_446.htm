The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Whoever intentionally swears falsely by a
religion other than Islam, then he is what he has said, (e.g. if he 
says, 'If such thing is not true then I am a Jew,' he is really a 
Jew). And whoever commits suicide with piece of iron will be punished 
Prophet said, "A man was inflicted with wounds and he committed 
suicide, and so Allah said: My slave has caused death on himself 
hurriedly, so I forbid Paradise for him."
