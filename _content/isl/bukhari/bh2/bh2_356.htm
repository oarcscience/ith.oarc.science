While a man was riding (his Mount) in 'Arafat, he fell down from it 
(his Mount) and broke his neck (and died). The Prophet said, "Wash him
with water and Sidr and shroud him in two pieces of cloth, and neither
perfume him, nor cover his head, for he will be resurrected on the Day
of Resurrection saying, 'Labbaik,' (i.e. like a pilgrim)."
