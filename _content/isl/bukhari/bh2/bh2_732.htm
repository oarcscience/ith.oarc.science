rode behind Allah's Apostle from 'Arafat and when Allah's Apostle 
reached the mountain pass on the left side which is before 
Al-Muzdalifa he made his camel kneel and then urinated, and then I 
poured water for his ablution. He performed light ablution and then I 
said to him: (Is it the time for) the prayer, O Allah's Apostle!" He 
replied, "The (place of) prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at 
Al-Muzdalifa)." So Allah's Apostle rode till he reached Al-Muzdalifa 
and then he offered the prayer (there) . Then in the morning (10th 
Dhul-Hijja) Al-Faql (bin Abbas) rode behind Allah's Apostle. Kuraib, 
(a sub-narrator) said that 'Abdullah bin Abbas narrated from Al-Fadl, 
"Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) kept on reciting Talbiya (during the 
journey) till he reached the Jamra." (Jamrat-al-Aqaba)
