<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:426</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
We were in the funeral procession of the daughter of Allah's Apostle 
and Allah's Apostle was sitting near the grave and I saw his eyes full
of tears. He said, "Is there anyone amongst you who did not have 
sexual relations with his wife last night?" Abu Talha replied in the 
affirmative. And so Allah's Apostle told him to get down in her grave 
and he got down in her grave and buried her.
