We got down at Al-Muzdalifa and Sauda asked the permission of the 
Prophet to leave (early) before the rush of the people. She was a slow
woman and he gave her permission, so she departed (from Al-Muzdalifa) 
before the rush of the people. We kept on staying at Al-Muzdalifa till
dawn, and set out with the Prophet but (I suffered so much that) I 
wished I had taken the permission of Allah's Apostle as Sauda had 
done, and that would have been dearer to me than any other happiness.
