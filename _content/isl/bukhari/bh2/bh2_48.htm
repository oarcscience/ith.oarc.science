<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:49</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn  Abbas:</I></P>
Once the Prophet ascended the pulpit and it was the last gathering in 
which he took part. He was covering his shoulder with a big cloak and 
binding his head with an oily bandage. He glorified and praised Allah 
and said, "O people! Come to me." So the people came and gathered 
around him and he then said, "Amma ba'du." "From now onward the Ansar 
will decrease and other people will increase. So anybody who becomes a
ruler of the followers of Muhammad and has the power to harm or 
benefit people then he should accept the good from the benevolent 
amongst them (Ansar) and overlook the faults of their wrong-doers."
