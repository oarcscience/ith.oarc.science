<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:1</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
I heard Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) saying, "We (Muslims) are the last 
(to come) but (will be) the foremost on the Day of Resurrection though
the former nations were given the Holy Scriptures before us. And this 
was their day (Friday) the celebration of which was made compulsory 
for them but they differed about it. So Allah gave us the guidance for
it (Friday) and all the other people are behind us in this respect: 
the Jews' (holy day is) tomorrow (i.e. Saturday) and the Christians' 
(is) the day after tomorrow (i.e. Sunday)."
