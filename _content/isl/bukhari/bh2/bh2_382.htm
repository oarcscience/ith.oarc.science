<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:381</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah :</I></P>
On the day of the Battle of Uhud, my father was brought and he had 
been mayhemed and was placed in front of Allah's Apostle and a sheet 
was over him. I went intending to uncover my father but my people 
forbade me; again I wanted to uncover him but my people forbade me. 
Allah's Apostle gave his order and he was shifted away. At that time 
he heard the voice of a crying woman and asked, "Who is this?" They 
said, "It is the daughter or the sister of Amr." He said, "Why does 
she weep? (or let her stop weeping), for the angels had been shading 
him with their wings till he (i.e. the body of the martyr) was shifted
away."
