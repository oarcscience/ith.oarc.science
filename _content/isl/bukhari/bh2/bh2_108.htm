<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:109</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</I></P>
I asked Ibn 'Umar, "What is your opinion about the two Rakat before 
the Fajr (compulsory) prayer, as to prolonging the recitation in 
them?" He said, "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to pray at night two Rakat
followed by two and so on, and end the prayer by one Raka Witr. He 
used to offer two Rakat before the Fajr prayer immediately after the 
Adhan." (Hammad, the sub-narrator said, "That meant (that he prayed) 
quickly.)"
