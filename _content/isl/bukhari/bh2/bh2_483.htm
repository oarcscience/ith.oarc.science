<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:482</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</I></P>
A delegation of the tribe of 'Abdul Qais came to the Prophet and said,
"O Allah's Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi'a, and the infidels 
of the tribe of Mudar stands between us and you; so we cannot come to 
you except during the Sacred Months. Please order us to do something 
(religious deeds) which we may carry out and also invite to it our 
people whom we have left behind." The Prophet said, "I order you to do
four things and forbid you four others: (I order you) to have faith in
Allah, and confess that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah,
(and the Prophet gestured with his hand like this (i.e. one knot) and 
to offer prayers perfectly and to pay the Zakat, and to pay one-fifth 
of the booty in Allah's Cause. And I forbid you to use Dubba', Hantam,
Naqir and Muzaffat (all these are the names of utensils used for 
preparing alcoholic drinks)."
