Sahl bin Hunaif and Qais bin Sad were sitting in the city of 
Al-Qadisiya. A funeral procession passed in front of them and they 
stood up. They were told that funeral procession was of one of the 
inhabitants of the land i.e. of a non-believer, under the protection 
of Muslims. They said, "A funeral procession passed in front of the 
Prophet and he stood up. When he was told that it was the coffin of a 
Jew, he said, "Is it not a living being (soul)?"
