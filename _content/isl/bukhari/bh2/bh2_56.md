### Hadith 2:57

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) talked about Friday and said, "There is an
hour (opportune time) on Friday and if a Muslim gets it while praying
and asks something from Allah, then Allah will definitely meet his
demand." And he (the Prophet) pointed out the shortness of that time
with his hands.
