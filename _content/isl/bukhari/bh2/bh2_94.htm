'Ata' told me that he had heard Jabir bin 'Abdullah saying, "The 
Prophet stood up to offer the prayer of the 'Id ul Fitr. He first 
offered the prayer and then delivered the Khutba. After finishing it 
he got down (from the pulpit) and went towards the women and advised 
them while he was leaning on Bilal's hand. Bilal was spreading out his
garment where the women were putting their alms." I asked 'Ata' 
whether it was the Zakat of 'Id ul Fitr. He said, "No, it was just 
alms given at that time. Some lady put her finger ring and the others 
would do the same." I said, (to 'Ata'), "Do you think that it is 
incumbent upon the Imam to give advice to the women (on 'Id day)?" He 
said, "No doubt, it is incumbent upon the Imams to do so and why 
should they not do so?" Al-Hasan bin Muslim told me that Ibn  Abbas 
had said, "I join the Prophet, Abu Bakr,  Umar and 'Uthman in the 'Id 
ul Fitr prayers. They used to offer the prayer before the Khutba and 
then they used to deliver the Khutba afterwards. Once the Prophet I 
came out (for the 'Id prayer) as if I were just observing him waving 
to the people to sit down. He, then accompanied by Bilal, came 
crossing the rows till he reached the women. He recited the following 
verse: 'O Prophet! When the believing women come to you to take the 
oath of fealty to you . . . (to the end of the verse) (60.12).' After 
finishing the recitation he said, "O ladies! Are you fulfilling your 
covenant?" None except one woman said, "Yes." Hasan did not know who 
was that woman. The Prophet said, "Then give alms." Bilal spread his 
garment and said, "Keep on giving alms. Let my father and mother 
sacrifice their lives for you (ladies)." So the ladies kept on putting
their Fatkhs (big rings) and other kinds of rings in Bilal's garment."
Abdur-Razaq said, " 'Fatkhs' is a big ring which used to be worn in 
the (Pre-lslamic) period of ignorance.
