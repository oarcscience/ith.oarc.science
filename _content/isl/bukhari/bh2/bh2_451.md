### Hadith 2:450

*Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib :*

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "When a faithful believer is made to sit in
his grave, then (the angels) come to him and he testifies that none has
the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's Apostle.
And that corresponds to Allah's statement: Allah will keep firm those
who believe with the word that stands firm . . . (14.27).

[Next: 2:451: Shu'ba: Same as above and added, Allah will keep firm
those who believe . . ....](bh2_452)
