<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:40</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Hazim bin Dinar:</I></P>
Some people went to Sahl bin Sad As-Sa'idi and told him that they had 
different opinions regarding the wood of the pulpit. They asked him 
about it and he said, "By Allah, I know of what wood the pulpit was 
made, and no doubt I saw it on thy very first day when Allah's Apostle
I took his seat on it. Allah's Apostle sent for such and such an 
Ansari woman (and Sahl mentioned her name) and said to her, 'Order 
your slave-carpenter to prepare for me some pieces of wood (i.e. 
pulpit) on which I may sit at the time of addressing the people.' So 
she ordered her slave-carpenter and he made it from the tamarisk of 
the forest and brought it (to the woman). The woman sent that (pulpit)
to Allah's Apostle who ordered it to be placed here. Then I saw 
Allah's Apostle praying on it and then bowed on it. Then he stepped 
back, got down and prostrated on the ground near the foot of the 
pulpit and again ascended the pulpit. After finishing the prayer he 
faced the people and said, 'I have done this so that you may follow me
and learn the way I pray.' "
