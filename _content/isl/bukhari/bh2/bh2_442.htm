<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:441</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira :</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Every child is born with a true faith of Islam 
(i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) but his parents convert him to 
Judaism, Christianity or Magainism, as an animal delivers a perfect 
baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?" Then Abu Huraira recited the 
holy verses: "The pure Allah's Islamic nature (true faith of Islam) 
(i.e. worshipping none but Allah) with which He has created human 
beings. No change let there be in the religion of Allah (i.e. joining 
none in worship with Allah). That is the straight religion (Islam) but
most of men know, not." (30.30)
