<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:8</H3><P><I>Narrated Salman-Al-Farsi:</I></P>
The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Whoever takes a bath on Friday, purifies 
himself as much as he can, then uses his (hair) oil or perfumes 
himself with the scent of his house, then proceeds (for the Jumua 
prayer) and does not separate two persons sitting together (in the 
mosque), then prays as much as (Allah has) written for him and then 
remains silent while the Imam is delivering the Khutba, his sins 
in-between the present and the last Friday would be forgiven."
