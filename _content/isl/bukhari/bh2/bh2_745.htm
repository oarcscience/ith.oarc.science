I went out with 'Abdullah , to Mecca and when we proceeded to am' he 
offered the two prayers (the Maghrib and the 'Isha') together, making 
the Adhan and Iqama separately for each prayer. He took his supper in 
between the two prayers. He offered the Fajr prayer as soon as the day
dawned. Some people said, "The day had dawned (at the time of the 
prayer)," and others said, "The day had not dawned." 'Abdullah then 
said, "Allah's Apostle said, 'These two prayers have been shifted from
their stated times at this place only (at Al-Muzdalifa); first: The 
Maghrib and the 'Isha'. So the people should not arrive at 
Al-Muzdalifa till the time of the 'Isha' prayer has become due. The 
second prayer is the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.' " 
Then 'Abdullah stayed there till it became a bit brighter. He then 
said, "If the chief of the believers hastened onwards to Mina just 
now, then he had indeed followed the Sunna." I do not know which 
proceeded the other, his ('Abdullah's) statement or the departure of 
'Uthman . Abdullah was reciting Talbiya till he threw pebbles at the 
Jamrat-al-'Aqaba on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering) (that is the 10th 
of Dhul-Hijja).
