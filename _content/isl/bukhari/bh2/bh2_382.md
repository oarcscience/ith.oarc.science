### Hadith 2:381

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah :*

On the day of the Battle of Uhud, my father was brought and he had been
mayhemed and was placed in front of Allah's Apostle and a sheet was over
him. I went intending to uncover my father but my people forbade me;
again I wanted to uncover him but my people forbade me. Allah's Apostle
gave his order and he was shifted away. At that time he heard the voice
of a crying woman and asked, "Who is this?" They said, "It is the
daughter or the sister of Amr." He said, "Why does she weep? (or let her
stop weeping), for the angels had been shading him with their wings till
he (i.e. the body of the martyr) was shifted away."
