The people of Medina asked Ibn Abbas about a woman who got her menses 
after performing Tawaf-al-Ifada. He said, "She could depart (from 
Mecca)." They said, "We will not act on your verdict and ignore the 
verdict of Zaid." Ibn Abbas said, "When you reach Medina, inquire 
about it." So, when they reached Medina they asked (about that). One 
of those whom they asked was Um Sulaim. She told them the narration of
Safiya (812).
