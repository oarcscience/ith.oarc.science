### Hadith 2:672

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

When Allah's Apostle and his companions came to Mecca, the pagans
circulated the news that a group of people were coming to them and they
had been weakened by the Fever of Yathrib (Medina). So the Prophet
ordered his companions to do Ramal in the first three rounds of Tawaf of
the Ka'ba and to walk between the two corners (The Black Stone and
Yemenite corner). The Prophet did not order them to do Ramal in all the
rounds of Tawaf out of pity for them.

at Mecca; he kissed the Black Stone ...](bh2_675)
