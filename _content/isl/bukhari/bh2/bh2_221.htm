<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:222</H3><P><I>Narrated Salim's father:</I></P>
In the life-time of the Prophet whosoever saw a dream would narrate it
to Allah's Apostle. I had a wish of seeing a dream to narrate it to 
Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) I was a grown up boy and used to sleep in 
the Mosque in the life-time of the Prophet.  I saw in the dream that 
two angels caught hold of me and took me to the Fire which was built 
all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people in 
it were known to me. I started saying, "I seek refuge with Allah from 
the Fire." Then I met another angel who told me not to be afraid. I 
narrated the dream to Hafsa who told it to Allah's Apostle. The 
Prophet said, "Abdullah is a good man. I wish he prayed Tahajjud." 
After that 'Abdullah (i.e. Salim's father) used to sleep but a little 
at night.
