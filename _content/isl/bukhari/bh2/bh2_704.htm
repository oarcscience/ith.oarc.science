<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:702</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
We set out with Allah's Apostle in the year of his Last Hajj and we 
mended (the Ihram) for 'Umra. Then the Prophet said, "Whoever has a 
Hadi with him should assume Ihram for both Hajj and 'Umra, and should 
not finish it till he performs both of the them (Hajj and 'Umra)." 
When we reached Mecca, I had my menses. When we had performed our 
Hajj, the Prophet sent me with 'Abdur-Rahman to Tan'im and I performed
the 'Umra. The Prophet said, "This is in lieu of your missed 'Umra." 
Those who had assumed Ihram for 'Umra performed Tawaf (between Safa 
and Marwa) and then finished their Ihram. And then they performed 
another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) after returning from Mina. And 
those who had assumed lhram for Hajj and 'Umra to get her ( Hajj-Qiran
) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).
