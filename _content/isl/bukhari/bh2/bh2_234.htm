Anas bin Malik said, "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Zaid bin Thabit took 
their Suhur together. When they finished it, the Prophet stood for the
(Fajr) prayer and offered it." We asked Anas, "What was the interval 
between their finishing the Suhur and the starting of the morning 
prayer?" Anas replied, "It was equal to the time taken by a person in 
reciting fifty verses of the Quran."
