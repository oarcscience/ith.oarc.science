<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:528</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
Abu Bakr wrote to me what Allah had instructed His Apostle (p.b.u.h) 
to do regarding the one who had to pay one Bint Makhad (i.e. one 
year-old she-camel) as Zakat, and he did not have it but had got Bint 
Labun (two year old she-camel). (He wrote that) it could be accepted 
from him as Zakat, and the collector of Zakat would return him 20 
Dirhams or two sheep; and if the Zakat payer had not a Bint Makhad, 
but he had Ibn Labun (a two year old he-camel) then it could be 
accepted as his Zakat, but he would not be paid anything .
