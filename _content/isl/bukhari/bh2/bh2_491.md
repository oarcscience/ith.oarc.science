### Hadith 2:490

*Narrated Ibn Masud:*

I heard the Prophet saying, "There is no envy except in two: a person
whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it in the right way, and a
person whom Allah has given wisdom (i.e. religious knowledge) and he
gives his decisions accordingly and teaches it to the others."

[Next: 2:491: Abu Huraira Allah's Apostle said, If one give in charity
what equals one ...](bh2_492)
