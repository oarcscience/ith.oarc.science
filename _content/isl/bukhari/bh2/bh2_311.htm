The news about the differences amongst the people of Bani 'Amr bin 
'Auf at Quba reached Allah's Apostle and so he went to them along with
some of his companions to affect a reconciliation. Allah's Apostle was
delayed there and the time for the prayer became due. Bilal came to 
Abu Bakr! and said, "O Abu Bakr! Allah's Apostle is detained (there) 
and the time for the prayer is due. Will you lead the people in 
prayer?" Abu Bakr replied, "Yes, if you wish." So Bilal pronounced the
Iqama and Abu Bakr went forward and the people said Takbir. In the 
meantime, Allah's Apostle came piercing through the rows till he stood
in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would 
never look hither and thither during the prayer but when the people 
clapped much he looked back and saw Allah's Apostle. The Prophet 
beckoned him to carry on. Abu Bakr raised both his hands, praised 
Allah and retreated till he stood in the row and Allah's Apostle went 
forward and led the people in the prayer. When he had finished the 
prayer, he addressed the people and said, "O people! Why did you start
clapping when something happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is for
women. Whenever one is confronted with something unusual in the prayer
one should say, 'Sub Han Allah'." Then the Prophet looked towards Abu 
Bakr and asked, "What prevented you from leading the prayer when I 
beckoned you to carry on?" Abu Bakr replied, "It does not befit the 
son of Al Quhafa to lead the prayer in the presence of Allah's Apostle
