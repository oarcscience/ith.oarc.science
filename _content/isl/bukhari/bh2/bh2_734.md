### Hadith 2:732

*Narrated Usama bin Zaid:*

Allah's Apostle proceeded from 'Arafat and dismounted at the mountainous
pass and then urinated and performed a light ablution. I said to him,
"(Shall we offer) the prayer?" He replied, "The prayer is ahead of you
(i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)." When he came to Al-Muzdalifa, he performed a
perfect ablution. Then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he
offended the Maghrib prayer and then every person made his camel kneel
at his place; and then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he
offered the ('Isha') prayer and he did not offer any prayer in between
them (i.e. Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers).

prayers together at Jam' ...](bh2_735)
