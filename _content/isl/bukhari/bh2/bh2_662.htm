On the Day of Nahr at Mina, the Prophet said, "Tomorrow we shall stay 
at Khaif Bani Kinana where the pagans had taken the oath of Kufr 
(heathenism)." He meant (by that place) Al-Muhassab where the Quraish 
tribe and Bani Kinana concluded a contract against Bani Hashim and 
Bani 'Abdul-Muttalib or Bani Al-Muttalib that they would not 
intermarry with them or deal with them in business until they handed 
over the Prophet to them.
