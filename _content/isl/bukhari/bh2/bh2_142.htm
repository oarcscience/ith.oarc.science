<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:143</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
In the life-time of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) the people were 
afflicted with a (famine) year. While the Prophet was delivering the 
Khutba (sermon) on the pulpit on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and 
said, "O Allah's Apostle! The livestock are dying and the families 
(offspring) are hungry: please pray to Allah to bless us with rain." 
Allah's Apostle raised both his hands towards the sky and at that time
there was not a trace of cloud in they sky. Then the clouds started 
gathering like mountains. Before he got down from the pulpit I saw 
rain-water trickling down his beard. It rained that day, the next day,
the third day, the fourth day and till the next Friday, when the same 
Bedouin or some other person stood up (during the Friday Khutba) and 
said, "O Allah's Apostle! The houses have collapsed and the livestock 
are drowned. Please invoke Allah for us." So Allah's Apostle raised 
both his hands and said, "O Allah! Around us and not on us." Whichever
side the Prophet directed his hand, the clouds dispersed from there 
till a hole (in the clouds) was formed over Medina. The valley of 
Qanat remained flowing (with water) for one month and none, came from 
outside who didn't talk about the abundant rain.
