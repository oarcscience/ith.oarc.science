<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:672</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</I></P>
When Allah's Apostle and his companions came to Mecca, the pagans 
circulated the news that a group of people were coming to them and 
they had been weakened by the Fever of Yathrib (Medina). So the 
Prophet ordered his companions to do Ramal in the first three rounds 
of Tawaf of the Ka'ba and to walk between the two corners (The Black 
Stone and Yemenite corner). The Prophet did not order them to do Ramal
in all the rounds of Tawaf out of pity for them.
