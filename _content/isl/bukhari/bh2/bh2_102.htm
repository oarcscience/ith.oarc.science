On the days of Mina, (11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah) Abu Bakr 
came to her while two young girls were beating the tambourine and the 
Prophet was lying covered with his clothes. Abu Bakr scolded them and 
the Prophet uncovered his face and said to Abu Bakr, "Leave them, for 
these days are the days of 'Id and the days of Mina." 'Aisha further 
said, "Once the Prophet was screening me and I was watching the 
display of black slaves in the Mosque and ('Umar) scolded them. The 
Prophet said, 'Leave them. O Bani Arfida! (carry on), you are safe 
(protected)'."
