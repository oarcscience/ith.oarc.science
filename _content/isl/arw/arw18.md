*Arabian Wisdom*, by John Wortabet, \[1913\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span class="smallcaps">Knowledge</span>

*Koran.*    O God, increase my knowledge. Are they who know and they who
know not equal?

He who has been given wisdom has been given a great good.

What ye have been given of knowledge is only a small part.

Above a learned man there is one more learned.

*Traditions.*    Learned men are trustees to whom God has confided
mankind.

Stars are the beauty of the heavens, and learned men are the ornament of
a people.

Angels bend down their wings to a seeker of knowledge.

*Proverbs.*    The rank of the learned is the highest of all ranks.

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

If learning does not give wealth it will give esteem.

Knowledge increaseth the honour of a nobleman, and bringeth men of low
degree into the houses of kings.

A seat of learning is a garden of heaven.

Forgetfulness is the bane of knowledge.

It is difficult for a man to know himself.

Knowledge is a lamp from which men light their candles.

A mind without education is like a brave man without arms.

Kings govern men, and learned men govern kings.

That day in which I have learned nothing, and in which I have added
nothing to my knowledge, is no part of my life.

He who seeks learning without study will attain his end when the raven
becomes grey with age.

To every noble horse a stumble, and to every learned man an error.

Knowledge does not save from error, nor wealth from trouble.

The owner of the house knows best what is in it.
