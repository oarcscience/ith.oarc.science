<p>He is unthankful to God who is unthankful to man.</p>  
<p>He who is unthankful for little is unthankful for much.</p>  
<p>God continues His favours to him who is grateful.</p>  
<p>He who is ungrateful for the good he receives deserves that it should be withdrawn from him.</p>  
<p>Man can be thankful to God only so far as he does good to his fellow men.</p>  
<p>If a man professes to thank God and his wealth decreases, his thanksgiving must be vitiated by his neglect of the hungry and naked.</p>  
<p>Be grateful to him who has done you good, and do good to him who is grateful to you.</p>  
<p>Gratitude takes three forms&#8212;a feeling in the heart, an expression in words, and a giving in return.</p>  
<p>The most worthless things on earth are these</p>

<p>four&#8212;rain on a barren soil, a lamp in sunshine, a beautiful woman given in marriage to a blind man, and a good deed to one who is ungrateful.</p>
