### <span class="smallcaps">Humility</span>

Humility is that line of conduct which is a mean between overbearing
pride on the one hand and abject servility on the other, as economy is
the middle term between extravagance and avarice.

Humility is the crown of nobility, a ladder to honour, and a means of
procuring love and esteem.

He who humbleth himself, God lifteth him up.

When Abu-Bekr, "the righteous" (the first Khalif), was praised, he used
to say: "O God, Thou knowest me better than I know myself, and I know
myself better than they know me. Make me, I pray Thee, better than they
suppose; forgive me what they know not, and lay not to my account what
they say."

A wise man was once asked whether he knew of any good which is not
coveted, or any evil which deserves no mercy, and he said: "Yes, they
are humility and pride."

To despise a proud man is true humility.
