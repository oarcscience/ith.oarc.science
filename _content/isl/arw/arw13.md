*Arabian Wisdom*, by John Wortabet, \[1913\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

### <span class="smallcaps">Benevolence</span>

*Koran.*    Do good unto others as God has done unto you.

Is the reward of kindness anything but kindness?

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

He who does a kindly act shall be recompensed tenfold.

Ye can never be righteous unless ye give away from that which ye love.

*Traditions.*    The upper hand \[which giveth\] is better than the
lower hand \[which taketh\].

God's creatures are the objects of His care, and He loveth best that man
who is most helpful to them.

*Proverbs.*    Do not be ashamed to give little, for it is less than
that, if you give nothing.

If you give, give freely, and if you strike, strike boldly.

He who soweth kindness shall reap thanks.

What a man does for God is never lost.

Be merciful to him who is beneath you, and you will have mercy from Him
who is above you.

The best kind of good is that which is done most speedily.

Inopportune kindness is injustice.

No true joy but in doing good and no true sorrow but in doing evil.

Cruelty to animals is forbidden by God.

A peacemaker gets two-thirds of the blows.
