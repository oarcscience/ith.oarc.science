<p>If it were not for the faculty of speech, man would be nothing more than a silent picture or a contemptible animal.</p>  
<p>The tongue is the best part of man.</p>  
<p>Man is hidden behind his tongue.</p>  
<p>A man's talk shows what kind of mind he has.</p>  
<p>What you write is the truest thing that can be said of you.</p>  
<p>The words of eloquent men are like a mighty army, and their writings like glittering swords.</p>  
<p>Note down in writing what you learn. All knowledge which is not committed to writing is lost.</p>  
<p>The best handwriting is that which is most easily read.</p>  
<p>A bad pen is like an unruly, undutiful child.</p>  
<p>If you value a book you will read it through.</p>  
<p>If you write a book, be ready to encounter criticism.</p>  
<p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></A></p>  
<p>A book is like a garden carried in the pocket.</p>  
<p>A book is an eloquent, silent companion, or a speaking friend answering and questioning you.</p>  
<p>Books are the food of minds.</p>  
<p>There is something wise in every proverb.</p>  
<p>The tongues of men are the pens of truth.</p>  
<p>Poets, love-stricken, ramble up and down in every valley.</p>  
<p>Poetry is one of the musical instruments of Satan.</p>
