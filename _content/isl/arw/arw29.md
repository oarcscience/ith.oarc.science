### <span class="smallcaps">Deceit</span>

Deceit does more harm to the deceitful than to the deceived.

If a man commit these three things they will

rise against him in judgment and punishment—aggression, perfidy, and
deceit.

To be true to the perfidious is perfidy, and to deceive the deceitful is
lawful.

In deceiving your neighbour be more wary than when he is trying to
deceive you.

When one would deceive you, and you feign to be deceived, you have
deceived him.

He who would deceive one who cannot be deceived is only deceiving
himself.

He who allows himself to be deceived by what his enemy says is the
greatest enemy to himself.

A wise man neither deceives nor is deceived.

If a man believe in a stone it will do him good.

Self-deception is one of the forms of folly.

Most men think well of themselves, and this is self-delusion.

Vain desires are rarely realised, but they may give comfort in sorrow or
pleasure in empty hope.
