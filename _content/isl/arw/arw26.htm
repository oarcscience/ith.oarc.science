<p><i>Koran.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O ye that believe, fear God and be truthful! Verily God recompenseth the truthfulness of the truthful.</p>  
<p><i>Traditions.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be ever truthful, for truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to heaven.</p>  
<p>Veracity brings peace to the heart.</p>  
<p>No man's religion can be right until his heart become right, nor can his heart become right until his tongue is right.</p>  
<p>Keep to the truth though it may harm thee, and keep away from falsehood though it may profit thee.</p>  
<p>A man can be perfect only when he speaks the truth and acts according to the truth.</p>  
<p><i>Proverbs.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth is the sword of God, which always cleaves when it smites.</p>  
<p>Truth is armed with horns.</p>  
<p>By truth man is saved from evil.</p>  
<p>If falsehood saves from trouble truth saves much more.</p>  
<p>When thou speakest be truthful, and when thou actest be gentle.</p>  
<p>An ignorant man who is true is better than a clever man who is false.</p>  
<p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></A></p>  
<p>There are two kinds of truthfulness, and the greatest of them is that which may do thee harm.</p>  
<p>If truth and falsehood were pictured they would be represented by a terrible lion and a cunning fox.</p>  
<p>It is better to die a truthful man than to live the life of a liar.</p>
