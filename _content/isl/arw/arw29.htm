<p>Deceit does more harm to the deceitful than to the deceived.</p>  
<p>If a man commit these three things they will</p>  
<p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></A></p>  
<p>rise against him in judgment and punishment&#8212;aggression, perfidy, and deceit.</p>  
<p>To be true to the perfidious is perfidy, and to deceive the deceitful is lawful.</p>  
<p>In deceiving your neighbour be more wary than when he is trying to deceive you.</p>  
<p>When one would deceive you, and you feign to be deceived, you have deceived him.</p>  
<p>He who would deceive one who cannot be deceived is only deceiving himself.</p>  
<p>He who allows himself to be deceived by what his enemy says is the greatest enemy to himself.</p>  
<p>A wise man neither deceives nor is deceived.</p>  
<p>If a man believe in a stone it will do him good.</p>  
<p>Self-deception is one of the forms of folly.</p>  
<p>Most men think well of themselves, and this is self-delusion.</p>  
<p>Vain desires are rarely realised, but they may give comfort in sorrow or pleasure in empty hope.</p>
