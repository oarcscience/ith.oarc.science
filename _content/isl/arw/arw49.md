### <span class="smallcaps">Brothers, Relations</span>

A man who has no brother is like one who has a left arm and no right. A
brother is a wing.

When evil befalls you, you will know the value of a brother.

Your brother is he who shares your distress.

The same regard is due to the eldest brother from the youngest as that
which is due to a parent from his child.

God helps him who helps his brother. Who forsakes his brother will be
forsaken by God.

A man is a mirror in which his brother's likeness is seen.

The best man among you is he who is best to his relations.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

Blood does not become water.

Honour your tribe, for they are the wing with which you fly.

The measure of a man's greatness is that of his tribe (clan, party).

Be friendly to your relations, but do not depend on your relationship.

If it were not for my own arm, my mouth would have nothing to eat.
