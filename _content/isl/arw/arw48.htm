<p>When your father and mother become old, and you take them into your house, say not a word of impatience to them, nor rebuke them, but speak graciously, and be humble to them, and say: "O my God, be merciful to them, even as they tended me when I was young " <i>(Koran)</i>.</p>  
<p>Be dutiful to your father, and your son shall be dutiful to you.</p>

<p>He who is ill-mannered to his father will be ill-treated by his son.</p>  
<p>The good-will of parents procures the goodwill of God.</p>  
<p>The central gate of heaven is open to the man who has been dutiful to his parents.</p>  
<p>Paradise is open at the command of mothers.</p>  
<p>You, and all that you have, belong to your father.</p>  
<p>A daughter is always proud of her father.</p>  
<p>An unmarried daughter has a broken wing.</p>
