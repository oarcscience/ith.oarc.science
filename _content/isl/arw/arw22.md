### Ignorance, Folly

Ignorance is the greatest poverty.

Ignorance is death in life.

There is no evil so great as ignorance.

Folly is an incurable disease.

A foolish man is like an old garment, which if you patch it in one place
becomes rent in many other places.

It is just as allowable to blame a blind man for want of sight as to
blame a fool for his folly.

To bear the folly of a fool is indeed a great hardship.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

The best way to treat a fool is to shun him.

The fool is an enemy to himself—how can he then be a friend to others?

An ignorant man is highly favoured, for he casts away the burden of
life, and does not vex his soul with thoughts of time and eternity.

The most effectual preacher to a man is himself. A man never turns away
from his passions unless the rebuke comes from himself to himself.
