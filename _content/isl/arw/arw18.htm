<p><i>Koran.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O God, increase my knowledge. Are they who know and they who know not equal?</p>  
<p>He who has been given wisdom has been given a great good.</p>  
<p>What ye have been given of knowledge is only a small part.</p>  
<p>Above a learned man there is one more learned.</p>  
<p><i>Traditions.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned men are trustees to whom God has confided mankind.</p>  
<p>Stars are the beauty of the heavens, and learned men are the ornament of a people.</p>  
<p>Angels bend down their wings to a seeker of knowledge.</p>  
<p><i>Proverbs.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rank of the learned is the highest of all ranks.</p>  
<p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></A></p>  
<p>If learning does not give wealth it will give esteem.</p>  
<p>Knowledge increaseth the honour of a nobleman, and bringeth men of low degree into the houses of kings.</p>  
<p>A seat of learning is a garden of heaven.</p>  
<p>Forgetfulness is the bane of knowledge.</p>  
<p>It is difficult for a man to know himself.</p>  
<p>Knowledge is a lamp from which men light their candles.</p>  
<p>A mind without education is like a brave man without arms.</p>  
<p>Kings govern men, and learned men govern kings.</p>  
<p>That day in which I have learned nothing, and in which I have added nothing to my knowledge, is no part of my life.</p>  
<p>He who seeks learning without study will attain his end when the raven becomes grey with age.</p>  
<p>To every noble horse a stumble, and to every learned man an error.</p>  
<p>Knowledge does not save from error, nor wealth from trouble.</p>  
<p>The owner of the house knows best what is in it.</p>
