<p>All life ends in death.</p>  
<p>When I see all paths leading men unto death, and no paths leading from death unto us&#8212;no traveller there ever returning&#8212;not one of ages past ever remaining&#8212;I see that I also shall assuredly go where they have gone.</p>  
<p>If death be surely inevitable, be not a fool and die a coward's death.</p>  
<p>Death is a cup which every man must drink, and the grave a door which every man must enter.</p>  
<p>If we are hastening to death, why all this impatience with the ills of life?</p>  
<p>This life is a sleep, the life to come is a wakening;</p>  
<p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></A></p>  
<p>the intermediate step between them is death, and our life here is a disturbed dream.</p>  
<p>He who dreads the causes of death, they will surely seize him&#8212;do what he will to evade them.</p>  
<p>Death, so far as one can see, strikes at random, killing the man whom he hits, and leaving the man whom he misses to old age and decrepitude.</p>  
<p>Death covers all faults.</p>
