<p>Wise men are silent.</p>  
<p>Silence is often more eloquent than words.</p>  
<p>Be not hasty with your tongue. If words are silver, silence is gold.</p>  
<p>Not all that is known should be said.</p>  
<p>Silence is a wise thing, but they who observe it are few.</p>  
<p>When the mind becomes large speech becomes little.</p>  
<p>Restrain your tongue from saying anything but what is good.</p>  
<p>An unguarded word may do you great harm.</p>  
<p>A man who talks much is open to much blame.</p>  
<p>The most faulty of men are they that are most loquacious in matters which do not concern them.</p>  
<p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></A></p>  
<p>To guard his tongue is one of the best traits in a man's character.</p>  
<p>Man is saved from much evil if he guard his tongue.</p>  
<p>The tongue is a lion which must be chained, and a sharp sword which must be sheathed.</p>  
<p>Nothing on earth is so deserving of a long imprisonment as the tongue.</p>  
<p>Beware of saying anything of which you may be ashamed.</p>  
<p>It is better to regret a thing which you did not say than a thing which you did say.</p>  
<p>A slip of the foot is safer than a slip of the tongue. A false step may break a bone which can be set, but a slip of the tongue cannot be undone.</p>  
<p>A thrust of the tongue is sharper than the thrust of a lance.</p>  
<p>A word may cause much trouble, destroy a home, or open a grave.</p>  
<p>A great tree grows out of a small seed.</p>  
<p>The difference between loquacity and silence is like the difference between the noisy frog and the silent whale.</p>  
<p>Wisdom is made up of ten parts&#8212;nine of which are silence, and the tenth is brevity of language.</p>  
<p>A man conceals his ignorance by his silence.</p>  
<p>He who says what he should not say, will have to hear what he would not like to hear.</p>  
<p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></A></p>  
<p>He who talks much does little.</p>  
<p>What is said at night the day blots out.</p>
