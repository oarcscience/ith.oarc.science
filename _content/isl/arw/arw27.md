### <span class="smallcaps">Truthfulness to Promises</span>

*Koran.*    Be true to a covenant, for a covenant holds a man
responsible. Be faithful to your pledged covenants and keep your oaths.

*Traditions.*    A man who keeps not his word has no religion.

A true man's word is like an oath.

Be truthful in what you say, faithful to your promise, and careful of
what is entrusted to you.

A pledged word is as if you had made the gift.

*Proverbs.*    A true man keeps his promise.

A pledged word has the same value as a debt.

The promise of a true man is a greater obligation than a debt.

That man is a hypocrite who prays and fasts, but is untruthful in what
he says, false to his word, and unfaithful in discharging a trust.
