### <span class="smallcaps">Speaking, Writing, Books</span>

If it were not for the faculty of speech, man would be nothing more than
a silent picture or a contemptible animal.

The tongue is the best part of man.

Man is hidden behind his tongue.

A man's talk shows what kind of mind he has.

What you write is the truest thing that can be said of you.

The words of eloquent men are like a mighty army, and their writings
like glittering swords.

Note down in writing what you learn. All knowledge which is not
committed to writing is lost.

The best handwriting is that which is most easily read.

A bad pen is like an unruly, undutiful child.

If you value a book you will read it through.

If you write a book, be ready to encounter criticism.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

A book is like a garden carried in the pocket.

A book is an eloquent, silent companion, or a speaking friend answering
and questioning you.

Books are the food of minds.

There is something wise in every proverb.

The tongues of men are the pens of truth.

Poets, love-stricken, ramble up and down in every valley.

Poetry is one of the musical instruments of Satan.
