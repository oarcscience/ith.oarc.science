<p>A man who has no brother is like one who has a left arm and no right. A brother is a wing.</p>  
<p>When evil befalls you, you will know the value of a brother.</p>  
<p>Your brother is he who shares your distress.</p>  
<p>The same regard is due to the eldest brother from the youngest as that which is due to a parent from his child.</p>  
<p>God helps him who helps his brother. Who forsakes his brother will be forsaken by God.</p>  
<p>A man is a mirror in which his brother's likeness is seen.</p>  
<p>The best man among you is he who is best to his relations.</p>

<p>Blood does not become water.</p>  
<p>Honour your tribe, for they are the wing with which you fly.</p>  
<p>The measure of a man's greatness is that of his tribe (clan, party).</p>  
<p>Be friendly to your relations, but do not depend on your relationship.</p>  
<p>If it were not for my own arm, my mouth would have nothing to eat.</p>
