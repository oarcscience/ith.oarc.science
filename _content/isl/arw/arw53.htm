<p>Love of one's own country is a religious duty.</p>  
<p>A true man yearns towards his native country, and longs for his home as a lion longs for his lair.</p>  
<p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></A></p>  
<p>It is a sign of sound judgment when the heart craves for country and home.</p>  
<p>He is better to suffer hardship in one's own country than to enjoy ease in a foreign land.</p>  
<p>God blesses the land which is loved by its people.</p>  
<p>As a nurse who has brought you up, has a special claim on you, so has your country.</p>  
<p>He is an unwise man who alienates himself from his country and home.</p>  
<p>If it were not for love of country, unhappy lands would be desolate.</p>  
<p>It is an honour to you to love the land and house where you were born.</p>  
<p>An old man is most comfortable in his own house.</p>
