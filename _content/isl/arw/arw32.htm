<p>Economy saves half the cost of living.</p>  
<p>The value of economy is equal to half of your profits,</p>  
<p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></A></p>  
<p>Frugality saves a man from poverty.</p>  
<p>Little with economy is better than much with waste.</p>  
<p>Poverty with freedom from debt is great wealth.</p>  
<p>If you count beforehand you will thrive.</p>  
<p>The sea is made up of drops and the mountain of grains.</p>  
<p>My son, take a middle course between stinginess and extravagance, parsimony and prodigality.</p>  
<p>Extravagance dissipates great riches, and economy increases them when they are small.</p>  
<p>Extravagance ever leads to misery and ruin.</p>  
<p>Extravagance does as much harm to life as it adds to the pleasures of living.</p>  
<p>In all things take a middle course.</p>  
<p>Charity lies between two charities&#8212;one to yourself, the other to your needy fellow man.</p>  
<p>If you are too soft you will be squeezed, and if you are too dry you will be broken.</p>  
<p>He who spends and reckons not, ends in ruin and knows not.</p>  
<p>He who buys cheap meat will regret his purchase when it is served up.</p>
