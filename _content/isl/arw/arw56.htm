<p>An old man among his people is like a prophet sent from God.</p>  
<p>To venerate old age is to revere God.</p>  
<p>Youth is a kind of madness.</p>  
<p>The wisest young men are they who follow the good example of the old, and the most foolish old men are they who follow the bad example of the young.</p>  
<p>It is the duty of every one to be tender to the young and respectful to the old.</p>  
<p>An old man should not give up his old habits, nor take to new ones.</p>  
<p>An old man speaks of what he has seen, and a young man speaks of what he has heard.</p>  
<p>Grey hairs are a sign of wisdom, and are beautified by reverence.</p>  
<p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></A></p>  
<p>A hoary head is a rich cream churned by long years.</p>  
<p>Grey hairs are a message from the other world.</p>  
<p>After old age there is nothing but infirmity or death.</p>  
<p>An old man cries out, "O that youth would return for a day, that I might relate to it what the roll of years has done to me!"</p>  
<p>The hair often becomes white, not from the succession of years, but from a succession of evils.</p>  
<p>Life is a parting shadow and youth a departing guest.</p>  
<p>When a young man says he is hungry, believe him; but when he says he is tired, do not believe him.</p>
