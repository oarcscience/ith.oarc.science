<p>A man is truly religious when he is truly good.</p>  
<p>A good character is a great boon.</p>  
<p>Kind words are the bonds of love.</p>  
<p>A kind word is like an act of charity.</p>  
<p>If you cannot help men with money, help them with a cheerful face and a kindly bearing.</p>  
<p>No man is entitled to consideration unless he has these three things, or at least one of them: the fear of God to restrain him from evil, forbearance </p>  
<p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></A></p>  
<p>with wicked men, and a good nature towards all.</p>  
<p>There are cases where not kindness but severity is necessary.</p>  
<p>Kindness increases the love of friends, and diminishes the hatred of enemies.</p>  
<p>Be firm after you have been kind.</p>  
<p>God loves the man who is tender-hearted.</p>  
<p>An evil nature is a calamity from which there is no escape.</p>  
<p>If you hear that a mountain has moved from its place believe it, but if you hear that a man has changed his character do not believe it, for he will act only according to his nature.</p>  
<p>An inherited quality may be traced back to the seventh grandfather.</p>  
<p>There are four points in a good character from which all other good traits take their origin&#8212;prudence, courage, continence, and justice.</p>  
<p>When a woman has had more than one husband in this life, she will, in the future state, be free to be the wife of him whose character she esteemed the most.</p>
