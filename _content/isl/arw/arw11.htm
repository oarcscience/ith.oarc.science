<p>Son of man, if you have no self-respect, do what you will.</p>  
<p>Men see no fault in one who respects himself.</p>  
<p>If you fear not the consequences of an evil life, and have no sense of shame, you are free to do what you will.</p>  
<p>No, by God, life has no worth, and this world has no happiness to a man who has lost his self-respect and abandons himself to shamelessness.</p>  
<p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></A></p>  
<p>There is no good in a man who is not ashamed of men.</p>  
<p>He who has a brazen face has a craven heart.</p>  
<p>To be ashamed before God is to obey His commandments and to avoid what He has forbidden; to be ashamed before men is to avoid all harm to them; and to be ashamed before one's self is to be chaste and clean when one is alone.</p>  
<p>Be ashamed in your own sight more than in the sight of men.</p>  
<p>He who does a thing in secret of which he would be ashamed if done openly, has no respect for himself.</p>  
<p>He who respects not himself can have no respect for others.</p>  
<p>I shall not kiss a hand which deserves to be cut off.</p>
