### <span class="smallcaps">Death</span>

All life ends in death.

When I see all paths leading men unto death, and no paths leading from
death unto us—no traveller there ever returning—not one of ages past
ever remaining—I see that I also shall assuredly go where they have
gone.

If death be surely inevitable, be not a fool and die a coward's death.

Death is a cup which every man must drink, and the grave a door which
every man must enter.

If we are hastening to death, why all this impatience with the ills of
life?

This life is a sleep, the life to come is a wakening;

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

the intermediate step between them is death, and our life here is a
disturbed dream.

He who dreads the causes of death, they will surely seize him—do what he
will to evade them.

Death, so far as one can see, strikes at random, killing the man whom he
hits, and leaving the man whom he misses to old age and decrepitude.

Death covers all faults.
