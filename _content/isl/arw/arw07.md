### <span class="smallcaps">Forgiving Others</span>

*Koran.*    God forgiveth past sins; let men forgive and pardon. Forgive
freely. Forgiving others is the nearest thing to piety.

*Traditions.*    He who forgiveth others, God forgiveth him.

Be merciful, and you will have mercy; forgive and you will be forgiven.

*Sayings and Proverbs.*    Of all things God loveth best forgiveness
when one is able to inflict harm, and forbearance when one is angry.

The pleasure of forgiving is sweeter than the pleasure of revenge.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

Forgiveness is perfect when the sin is not remembered.

The most wicked of men is he who accepts no apology, covers no sin, and
forgives no fault.

Small men transgress, great men forgive.

A noble man condones and pardons, and when by chance he finds out a sin,
he conceals it.

A man said to another who had spoken evil of him: "If what you have said
be true, may God forgive me; and if false, may He forgive you."
