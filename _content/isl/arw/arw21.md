### <span class="smallcaps">Wisdom, Prudence, Experience</span>

Reason is a light in the heart which distinguishes between truth and
error.

A wise man sees with his heart what a fool does not see with his eyes.

Men should be judged according to their lights (reason).

A wise man is not he who considers how he may get out of an evil, but he
who sees that he does not fall into it.

Actions are judged by their endings. If you desire a thing, consider its
end.

A man cannot be wise without experience.

No wise man will be bitten twice from the same den.

No boon is so remunerative as reason.

Long experience is an addition to mind.

Consideration may take the place of experience.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

A wise man is he who has been taught by experience.

One word is sufficient to the wise man.

A cheap offer makes a wise purchaser wary.

He who considers consequences will attain his object, and he who does
not carefully think on them, evil will be sure to overtake him.

Everything has need of reason, and reason has need of experience.

Mind and experience are like water and earth co-operating—neither of
which alone can bring forth a flower.

Reason and anxious thought are inseparable.

A wise man is never happy. (For in much wisdom is much grief, and he
that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.—<span
class="smallcaps">Eccles</span>. i. 18.)
