<p>God is with them that are patient. God loveth them that are patient <i>(Koran)</i>.</p>  
<p>Patience is one-half of religious duty.</p>  
<p>There are two kinds of patience&#8212;one is for something which you desire, the other in something which you hate; and he is a strong man who can combine them both.</p>  
<p>Patience is mostly needed at the first shock.</p>  
<p>Grief is dispelled by patience.</p>  
<p>The device of a man who hath no device is patience.</p>  
<p>So long as there is a claimant, no just case is ever lost.</p>  
<p>Patience is a bitter cup, which the strong alone can drink.</p>  
<p>A misfortune is one, but it becomes two to the impatient.</p>  
<p>Patience is one of the gifts of heaven.</p>  
<p>He who is impatient to hear one word will have to listen to many words.</p>  
<p>Difficulties can be overcome only by patience.</p>  
<p>It is a good omen when your messenger is delayed.</p>  
<p>Rarely does a patient man fail in obtaining that which he seeks.</p>  
<p>Be patient&#8212;every cloud dissipates, and every evil which does not continue is a small thing.</p>
