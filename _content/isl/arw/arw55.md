### <span class="smallcaps">Health</span>

Health is a crown on the head of the hale, invisible except to the sick.

Sound health is beyond all price.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

The greatest gift to man is a long healthy life.

If there be anything more valuable than life, it is sound health.

It is wonderful that the envious see not the blessing of good health.

No man appreciates the worth of health until he is afflicted with
disease.

If your dinner is light, your dreams will be pleasant.

So long as the head is free from trouble, the body will be sound.
