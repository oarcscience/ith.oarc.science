<p>ARISE! and fill a golden goblet up<br> Until the wine of pleasure overflow,<br> Before into thy skull's pale empty cup<br> A grimmer Cup-bearer the dust shall throw.<br> Yea, to the Vale of Silence we must come;<br> Yet shall the flagon laugh and Heaven's dome<br> Thrill with an answering echo ere we go!</p>  
<p>Thou knowest that the riches of this field<br> Make no abiding, let the goblet's fire<br> Consume the fleeting harvest Earth may yield!<br> Oh Cypress-tree! green home of Love's sweet choir,<br> When I unto the dust I am have passed,<br> Forget thy former wantonness, and cast<br> Thy shadow o'er the dust of my desire.</p>  
<p>Flow, bitter tears, and wash me clean! for they<br> Whose feet are set upon the road that lies<br> 'Twixt Earth and Heaven Thou shalt be pure," they say,<br> "Before unto the pure thou lift thine eyes."<br> Seeing but himself, the Zealot sees but sin;<br> Grief to the mirror of his soul let in,<br> Oh Lord, and cloud it with the breath of sighs!</p>  
<p>No tainted eye shall gaze upon her face,<br> No glass but that of an unsullied heart<br> Shall dare reflect my Lady's perfect grace.<br> Though like to snakes that from the herbage start,<br> Thy curling locks have wounded me full sore,<br> Thy red lips hold the power of the bezoar&#151;<br> Ah, touch and heat me where I lie apart!</p>  
<p>And when from her the wind blows perfume sweet,<br> Tear, Hafiz, like the rose, thy robe in two,<br> And cast thy rags beneath her flying feet,<br> To deck the place thy mistress passes through.</p>
