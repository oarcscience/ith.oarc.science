<p>WHAT drunkenness is this that brings me hope&#151;<br> Who was the Cup-bearer, and whence the wine?<br> That minstrel singing with full voice divine,<br> What lay was his? for 'mid the woven rope<br> Of song, he brought word from my Friend to me<br> Set to his melody.</p>  
<p>The wind itself bore joy to Solomon;<br> The Lapwing flew from Sheba's garden close,<br> Bringing good tidings of its queen and rose.<br> Take thou the cup and go where meadows span<br> The plain, whither the bird with tuneful throat<br> Has brought Spring's sweeter note.</p>  
<p>Welcome, oh rose, and full-blown eglantine!<br> The violets their scented gladness fling,<br> Jasmin breathes purity-art sorrowing<br> Like an unopened bud, oh heart of mine?<br> The wind of dawn that sets closed blossoms free<br> Brings its warm airs to thee.</p>  
<p>Saki, thy kiss shall still my bitter cry!<br> Lift up your grief-bowed heads, all ye that weep,<br> The Healer brings joy's wine-cup&#151;oh, drink deep!<br> Disciple of the Tavern-priest am I;<br> The pious Sheikh may promise future bliss,<br> He brings me where joy is.</p>  
<p>The greedy glances of a Tartar horde<br> To me seemed kind&#151;my foeman spared me not<br> Though one poor robe was all that I had got.<br> But Heaven served Hafiz, as a slave his lord,<br> And when he fled through regions desolate,<br> Heaven brought him to thy gate.</p>
