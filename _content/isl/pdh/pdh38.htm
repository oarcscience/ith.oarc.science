<p>BELOVED, who has bid thee ask no more<br> How fares my life? to play the enemy<br> And ask not where he dwells that was thy friend?<br> Thou art the breath of mercy passing o'er<br> The whole wide world, and the offender I<br> Ah, let the rift my tears have channelled end,<br> Question the past no more!</p>  
<p>If thou would&#146;st know the secret of Love's fire,<br> It shall be manifest unto thine eyes:<br> Question the torch flame burning steadfastly,<br> But ask no more the sweet wind's wayward choir.<br> Ask me of faith and love that never dies;<br> Darius, Alexander's sovereignty,<br> I sing of these no more.</p>  
<p>Ask not the monk to give thee Truth's pure gold,<br> He hides no riches &#146;neath his lying guise;<br> And ask not him to teach thee alchemy<br> Whose treasure-house is bare, his hearth-stone cold.<br> Ask to what goal the wandering dervish hies,<br> They knew not his desire who counselled thee:<br> Question his rags no more!</p>  
<p>And in their learned books thou&#146;lt seek in vain<br> The key to Love's locked gateway; Heart grown wise<br> In pain and sorrow, ask no remedy!<br> But when the time of roses comes again,<br> Take what it gives, oh Hafiz, ere it flies,<br> And ask not why the hour has brought it thee,<br> And wherefore ask no more!</p>
