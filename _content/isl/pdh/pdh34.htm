<p>UPON a branch of the straight cypress-tree<br> Once more the patient nightingale doth rest:<br> "Oh Rose!" he cries, "evil be turned from thee!<br> I sing thee all men's thanks; thou blossomest<br> And hope springs up in every joyless heart&#151;<br> Let not the nightingale lament apart,<br> Nor with thy proud thorns wound his faithful breast."</p>  
<p>I will not mourn my woeful banishment,<br> He that has hungered for his lady's face<br> Shall, when she cometh, know a great content.<br> The Zealot seeks a heavenly dwelling-place,<br> Huris to welcome him in Paradise;<br> Here at the tavern gate my heaven lies,<br> I need no welcome but my lady's grace.</p>  
<p>Better to drink red wine than tears, say I,<br> While the lute sings; and if one bid thee cease,<br> "God is the merciful!" thou shalt reply.<br> To some, life brings but joy and endless ease;<br> Ah, let them laugh although the jest be vain!<br> For me the source of pleasure lay in pain,<br> And weeping for my lady I found peace.</p>  
<p>Hafiz, why art thou ever telling o'er<br> The tale of absence and of sorrow's night?<br> Knowest thou not that parting goes before<br> All meeting, and from darkness comes the light!</p>
