<p>ALL hail, Shiraz, hail! oh site without peer!<br> May God be the Watchman before thy gate,<br> That the feet of Misfortune enter not here!<br> Lest my Ruknabad be left desolate,<br> A hundred times, "God forbid!" I pray;<br> Its limpid stream where the shadows wait<br> Like the fount of Khizr giveth life for aye.</p>  
<p>'Twixt Jafrabad and Mosalla's close<br> Flies the north wind laden with ambergris&#151;<br> Oh, come to Shiraz when the north wind blows!<br> There abideth the angel Gabriel's peace<br> With him who is lord of its treasures; the fame<br> Of the sugar of Egypt shall fade and cease,<br> For the breath of our beauties has put it to shame.</p>  
<p>Oh wind that blows from the sun-rising,<br> What news of the maid with the drunken eyes,<br> What news of the lovely maid dost thou bring?<br> Bid me not wake from my dream and arise,<br> In dreams I have rested my head at her feet&#151;<br> When stillness unbroken around me lies,<br> The vision of her makes my solitude sweet.</p>  
<p>If for wine the Cup-bearer pour forth my blood,<br> As the milk from a mother's bosom flows,<br> At his word let my heart yield its crimson flood.<br> But, Hafiz, Hafiz! thou art of those<br> For ever fearing lest absence be near;<br> For the days when thou held'st the Beloved close,<br> Why rise not thy thanks so that all may hear?</p>
