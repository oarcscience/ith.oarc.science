<p><i>Thus said the Poet: "When Death comes to you,<br> All ye whose life-sand through the hour-glass slips,<br> He lays two fingers on your ears, and two<br> Upon your eyes he lays, one on your lips,<br> Whispering: Silence!" Although deaf thine ear,<br> Thine eye, my Hafiz, suffer Time's eclipse,<br> The songs thou sangest still all men may hear.</i></p>  
<p><i>Songs of dead laughter, songs of love once hot,<br> Songs of a cup once flushed rose-red with wine,<br> Songs of a rose whose beauty is forgot,<br> A nightingale that piped hushed lays divine:<br> And still a graver music runs beneath<br> The tender love notes of those songs of thine,<br> Oh, Seeker of the keys of Life and Death!</i></p>  
<p><i>While thou wert singing, the soft summer wind<br> That o&#146;er Mosalla's garden blew, the stream<br> Of Ruknabad flowing where roses twined,<br> Carried thy voice farther than thou could&#146;st dream.<br> To Isfahan and Baghdad's Tartar horde,<br> O&#146;er waste and sea to Yezd and distant Ind;<br> Yea, to the sun-setting they bore thy word.</i></p>  
<p><i>Behold we laugh, we warm us at Love's fire,<br> We thirst and scarce dare tell what wine we crave,<br> We lift our voices in Grief's dark-robed choir;<br> Sing thou the wisdom joy and sorrow gave!<br> If my poor rhymes held aught of the heart's lore,<br> Fresh wreaths were theirs to lay upon thy grave&#151;<br> Master and Poet, all was thine before!</i></p>
