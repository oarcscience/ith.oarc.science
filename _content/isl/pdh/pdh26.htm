<p>NOT one is filled with madness like to mine<br> In all the taverns! my soiled robe lies here,<br> There my neglected book, both pledged for wine.<br> With dust my heart is thick, that should be clear,<br> A glass to mirror forth the Great King's face;<br> One ray of light from out Thy dwelling-place<br> To pierce my night, oh God! and draw me near.</p>  
<p>From out mine eyes unto my garment's hem<br> A river flows; perchance my cypress-tree<br> Beside that stream may rear her lofty stem,<br> Watering her roots with tears. Ah, bring to me<br> The wine vessel! since my Love's cheek is hid,<br> A flood of grief comes from my heart unbid,<br> And turns mine eyes into a bitter sea!</p>  
<p>Nay, by the hand that sells me wine, I vow<br> No more the brimming cup shall touch my lips,<br> Until my mistress with her radiant brow<br> Adorns my feast-until Love's secret slips<br> From her, as from the candle's tongue of flame,<br> Though I, the sing&egrave;d moth, for very shame,<br> Dare not extol Love's light without eclipse.</p>  
<p>Red wine I worship, and I worship her&#151;<br> Speak not to me of anything beside,<br> For nought but these on earth or heaven I care.<br> What though the proud narcissus flowers defied<br> Thy shining eyes to prove themselves more bright,<br> Yet heed them not! those that are clear of sight<br> Follow not them to whom all light's denied.</p>  
<p>Before the tavern door a Christian sang<br> To sound of pipe and drum, what time the earth<br> Awaited the white dawn, and gaily rang<br> Upon mine ear those harbingers of mirth:<br> "If the True Faith be such as thou dost say,<br> Alas! my Hafiz, that this sweet To-day<br> Should bring unknown To-morrow to the birth!"</p>
