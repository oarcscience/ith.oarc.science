<p>WHAT is wrought in the forge of the living and life&#151;<br> All things are nought! Ho! fill me the bowl,<br> For nought is the gear of the world and the strife!<br> One passion has quickened the heart and the soul,<br> The Beloved's presence alone they have sought&#151;<br> Love at least exists; yet if Love were not,<br> Heart and soul would sink to the common lot&#151;<br> All things are nought!</p>  
<p>Like an empty cup is the fate of each,<br> That each must fill from Life's mighty flood;<br> Nought thy toil, though to Paradise gate thou reach,<br> If Another has filled up thy cup with blood;<br> Neither shade from the sweet-fruited trees could be bought<br> By thy praying-oh Cypress of Truth, dost not see<br> That Sidreh and Tuba were nought, and to thee<br> All then were nought!</p>  
<p>The span of thy life is as five little days,<br> Brief hours and swift in this halting-place;<br> Rest softly, ah rest! while the Shadow delays,<br> For Time's self is nought and the dial's face.<br> On the lip of Oblivion we linger, and short<br> Is the way from the Lip to the Mouth where we pass<br> While the moment is thine, fill, oh Saki, the glass<br> Ere all is nought!</p>  
<p>Consider the rose that breaks into flower,<br> Neither repines though she fade and die&#151;<br> The powers of the world endure for an hour,<br> But nought shall remain of their majesty.<br> Be not too sure of your crown, you who thought<br> That virtue was easy and recompense yours;<br> From the monastery to the wine-tavern doors<br> The way is nought</p>  
<p>What though I, too, have tasted the salt of my tears,<br> Though I, too, have burnt in the fires of grief,<br> Shall I cry aloud to unheeding ears?<br> Mourn and be silent! nought brings relief.<br> Thou, Hafiz, art praised for the songs thou hast wrought,<br> But bearing a stained or an honoured name,<br> The lovers of wine shall make light of thy fame&#151;<br> All things are nought!</p>
