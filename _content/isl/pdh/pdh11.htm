<p>OH Cup-bearer, set my glass afire<br> With the light of wine! oh minstrel, sing:<br> The world fulfilleth my heart's desire!<br> Reflected within the goblet's ring<br> I see the glow of my Love's red cheek,<br> And scant of wit, ye who fail to seek<br> The pleasures that wine alone can bring!</p>  
<p>Let not the blandishments be checked<br> That slender beauties lavish on me,<br> Until in the grace of the cypress decked,<br> My Love shall come like a ruddy pine-tree<br> He cannot perish whose heart doth hold<br> The life love breathes-though my days are told,<br> In the Book of the World lives my constancy.</p>  
<p>But when the Day of Reckoning is here,<br> I fancy little will be the gain<br> That accrues to the Sheikh for his lawful cheer,<br> Or to me for the draught forbidden I drain.<br> The drunken eyes of my comrades shine,<br> And I too, stretching my hand to the wine,<br> On the neck of drunkenness loosen the rein.</p>  
<p>Oh wind, if thou passest the garden close<br> Of my heart's dear master, carry for me<br> The message I send to him, wind that blows!<br> "Why hast thou thrust from thy memory<br> My hapless name?" breathe low in his ear;<br> "Knowest thou not that the day is near<br> When nor thou nor any shall think on me?"</p>  
<p>If with tears, oh Hafiz, thine eyes are wet,<br> Scatter them round thee like grain, and snare<br> The Bird of joy when it comes to thy net.<br> As the tulip shrinks from the cold night air,<br> So shrank my heart and quailed in the shade<br> Oh Song-bird Fortune, the toils are laid,<br> When shall thy bright wings lie pinioned there?</p>  
<p>The heavens' green sea and the bark therein,<br> The slender bark of the crescent moon,<br> Are lost in thy bounty's radiant noon,<br> Vizir and pilgrim, Kawameddin!</p>
