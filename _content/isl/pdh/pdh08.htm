<p>A FLOWER-TINTED cheek, the flowery close<br> Of the fair earth, these are enough for me<br> Enough that in the meadow wanes and grows<br> The shadow of a graceful cypress-tree.<br> I am no lover of hypocrisy;<br> Of all the treasures that the earth can boast,<br> A brimming cup of wine I prize the most&#151;<br> This is enough for me!</p>  
<p>To them that here renowned for virtue live,<br> A heavenly palace is the meet reward;<br> To me, the drunkard and the beggar, give<br> The temple of the grape with red wine stored!<br> Beside a river seat thee on the sward;<br> It floweth past-so flows thy life away,<br> So sweetly, swiftly, fleets our little day&#151;<br> Swift, but enough for me!</p>  
<p>Look upon all the gold in the world's mart,<br> On all the tears the world hath shed in vain<br> Shall they not satisfy thy craving heart?<br> I have enough of loss, enough of gain;<br> I have my Love, what more can I obtain?<br> Mine is the joy of her companionship<br> Whose healing lip is laid upon my lip&#151;<br> This is enough for me!</p>  
<p>I pray thee send not forth my naked soul<br> From its poor house to seek for Paradise<br> Though heaven and earth before me God unroll,<br> Back to thy village still my spirit flies.<br> And, Hafiz, at the door of Kismet lies<br> No just complaint-a mind like water clear,<br> A song that swells and dies upon the ear,<br> These are enough for thee!</p>
