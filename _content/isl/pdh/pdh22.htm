<p>FROM out the street of So-and-So,<br> Oh wind, bring perfumes sweet to me<br> For I am sick and pale with woe;<br> Oh bring me rest from misery!<br> The dust that lies before her door,<br> Love's long desired elixir, pour<br> Upon this wasted heart of mine&#151;<br> Bring me a promise and a sign!</p>  
<p>Between the ambush of mine eyes<br> And my heart's fort there's enmity&#151;<br> Her eye-brow's bow, the dart that flies,<br> Beneath her lashes, bring to me!<br> Sorrow and absence, glances cold,<br> Before my time have made me old;<br> A wine-cup from the hand of Youth<br> Bring me for pity and for ruth!</p>  
<p>Then shall all unbelievers taste<br> A draught or two of that same wine;<br> But if they like it not, oh haste!<br> And let joy's flowing cup be mine.<br> Cup-bearer, seize to-day, nor wait<br> Until to-morrow!&#151;or from Fate<br> Some passport to felicity,<br> Some written surety bring to me!</p>  
<p>My heart threw back the veil of woe,<br> Consoled by Hafiz melody:<br> From out the street of So-and-So,<br> Oh wind, bring perfumes sweet to me!</p>
