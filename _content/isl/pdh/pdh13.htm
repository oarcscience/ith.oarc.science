<p>MIRTH, Spring, to linger in a garden fair,<br> What more has earth to give? All ye that wait,<br> Where is the Cup-bearer, the flagon where?<br> When pleasant hours slip from the hand of Fate,<br> Reckon each hour as a certain gain;<br> Who seeks to know the end of mortal care<br> Shall question his experience in vain.</p>  
<p>Thy fettered life hangs on a single thread&#151;<br> Some comfort for thy present ills devise,<br> But those that time may bring thou shalt not dread.<br> Waters of Life and Irem's Paradise&#151;<br> What meaning do our dreams and pomp convey,<br> Save that beside a mighty stream, wide-fed,<br> We sit and sing of wine and go our way!</p>  
<p>The modest and the merry shall be seen<br> To boast their kinship with a single voice;<br> There are no differences to choose between,<br> Thou art but flattering thy soul with choice!<br> Who knows the Curtain's secret? . . . Heaven is mute<br> And yet with Him who holds the Curtain, e&#146;en<br> With Him, oh Braggart, thou would&#146;st raise dispute!</p>  
<p>Although His thrall shall miss the road and err,<br> 'Tis but to teach him wisdom through distress,<br> Else Pardon and Compassionate Mercy were<br> But empty syllables and meaningless.<br> The Zealot thirsts for draughts of Kausar's wine,<br> And Hafiz doth an earthly cup prefer&#151;<br> But what, between the two, is God's design?</p>
