*Poems from the Divan of Hafiz*, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, \[1897\], at

## III

WIND from the east, oh Lapwing of the day,  
I send thee to my Lady, though the way  
Is far to Saba, where I bid thee fly;  
Lest in the dust thy tameless wings should lie,  
Broken with grief, I send thee to thy nest,  
Fidelity.

Or far or near there is no halting-place  
Upon Love's road-absent, I see thy face,  
And in thine car my wind-blown greetings sound,  
North winds and east waft them where they are bound,  
Each morn and eve convoys of greeting fair  
I send to thee.

Unto mine eyes a stranger, thou that art  
A comrade ever-present to my heart,  
What whispered prayers and what full meed of praise  
I send to thee.

Lest Sorrow's army waste thy heart's domain,  
I send my life to bring thee peace again,  
Dear life thy ransom! From thy singers learn  
How one that longs for thee may weep and bum  
Sonnets and broken words, sweet notes and songs  
I send to thee.

Give me the cup! a voice rings in mine cars  
Crying: "Bear patiently the bitter years!  
For all thine ills, I send thee heavenly grace.  
God the Creator mirrored in thy face  
Thine eyes shall see, God's image in the glass  
I send to thee.

Hafiz, thy praise alone my comrades sing;  
Hasten to us, thou that art sorrowing!  
A robe of honour and a harnessed steed  
I send to thee."
