<p>THE rose has flushed red, the bud has burst,<br> And drunk with joy is the nightingale<br> Hail, Sufis! lovers of wine, all hail!<br> For wine is proclaimed to a world athirst.<br> Like a rock your repentance seemed to you;<br> Behold the marvel! of what avail<br> Was your rock, for a goblet has cleft it in two!</p>  
<p>Bring wine for the king and the slave at the gate<br> Alike for all is the banquet spread,<br> And drunk and sober are warmed and fed.<br> When the feast is done and the night grows late,<br> And the second door of the tavern gapes wide,<br> The low and. the mighty must bow the head<br> 'Neath the archway of Life, to meet what . . . outside?</p>  
<p>Except thy road through affliction pass,<br> None may reach the halting-station of mirth<br> God's treaty: Am I not Lord of the earth?<br> Man sealed with a sigh: Ah yes, alas!<br> Nor with Is nor Is Not let thy mind contend<br> Rest assured all perfection of mortal birth<br> In the great Is Not at the last shall end.</p>  
<p>For Assaf's pomp, and the steeds of the wind,<br> And the speech of birds, down the wind have fled,<br> And he that was lord of them all is dead;<br> Of his mastery nothing remains behind.<br> Shoot not thy feathered arrow astray!<br> A bow-shot's length through the air it has sped,<br> And then . . . dropped down in the dusty way.</p>  
<p>But to thee, oh Hafiz, to thee, oh Tongue<br> That speaks through the mouth of the slender reed,<br> What thanks to thee when thy verses speed<br> From lip to lip, and the song thou hast sung?</p>
