<p><i>Stanza 1</i>.&#151;Hafiz wrote this poem upon the death of his son.</p>  
<p><i>Stanza 3</i>.&#151;Rosenzweig, in his edition of the Divan, says that the allusion is to the dust and water which God kneaded into the body of Adam, and that, out of derision, Hafiz; calls the human body a house of joy.</p>  
<p>The moon, according to Persian superstition, has a baneful influence upon human life.</p>  
<p><i>Stanza 4</i>.&#151;Rosenzweig says that "I had not castled" means that Hafiz; had not taken the precaution of marrying his son, and so securing for himself grandchildren who would have been a consolation to him on their father's death. For that reason he had nothing more to lose, and was indifferent as to what his next move in the game should be.</p>
