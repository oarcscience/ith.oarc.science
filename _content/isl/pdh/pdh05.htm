<p>WIND from the east, oh Lapwing of the day,<br> I send thee to my Lady, though the way<br> Is far to Saba, where I bid thee fly;<br> Lest in the dust thy tameless wings should lie,<br> Broken with grief, I send thee to thy nest,<br> Fidelity.</p>  
<p>Or far or near there is no halting-place<br> Upon Love's road-absent, I see thy face,<br> And in thine car my wind-blown greetings sound,<br> North winds and east waft them where they are bound,<br> Each morn and eve convoys of greeting fair<br> I send to thee.</p>  
<p>Unto mine eyes a stranger, thou that art<br> A comrade ever-present to my heart,<br> What whispered prayers and what full meed of praise<br> I send to thee.</p>  
<p>Lest Sorrow's army waste thy heart's domain,<br> I send my life to bring thee peace again,<br> Dear life thy ransom! From thy singers learn<br> How one that longs for thee may weep and bum<br> Sonnets and broken words, sweet notes and songs<br> I send to thee.</p>  
<p>Give me the cup! a voice rings in mine cars<br> Crying: "Bear patiently the bitter years!<br> For all thine ills, I send thee heavenly grace.<br> God the Creator mirrored in thy face<br> Thine eyes shall see, God's image in the glass<br> I send to thee.</p>  
<p>Hafiz, thy praise alone my comrades sing;<br> Hasten to us, thou that art sorrowing!<br> A robe of honour and a harnessed steed<br> I send to thee."</p>
