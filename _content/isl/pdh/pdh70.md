## XXXI

*Stanza 3*.—The month of Sha’aban is the eighth month of the Arabic
year. It is followed by Ramazan, during which month the Prophet decreed
that from two hours before dawn until sunset nothing should pass the
lips of his followers. The fast is so strictly observed, especially by
the lower orders, that not only do they refrain from eating and
drinking, but they will not even smoke until the sunset gun puts an end
to the day's abstinence. The night, however, is passed in feasting and
revelry, and the richer classes will sleep late in Ramazan and shorten
the long hours that must pass before they may breakfast.
