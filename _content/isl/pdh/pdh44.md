## XLII

TRUE love has vanished from every heart;  
What has befallen all lovers fair?  
When did the bonds of friendship part?—  
What has befallen the friends that were?  
Ah, why are the feet of Khizr lingering?—  
The waters of life are no longer clear,  
The purple rose has turned pale with fear,  
And what has befallen the wind of Spring?

None now sayeth: "A love was mine,  
Loyal and wise, to dispel my care."  
None remembers love's right divine;  
What has befallen all lovers fair?  
In the midst of the field, to the players' feet,  
The ball of God's favour and mercy came,  
But none has leapt forth to renew the game—  
What has befallen the horsemen fleet?

Roses have bloomed, yet no bird rejoiced,  
No vibrating throat has rung with the tale;  
What can have silenced the hundred-voiced?  
What has befallen the nightingale?  
Heaven's music is hushed, and the planets roll  
In silence; has Zohra broken her lute?  
There is none to press out the vine's ripe fruit,  
And what has befallen the foaming bowl?

A city where kings are but lovers crowned,  
A land from the dust of which friendship springs—  
Who has laid waste that enchanted ground?  
What has befallen the city of kings?  
Years have passed since a ruby was won  
From the mine of manhood; they labour in vain,  
The fleet-footed wind and the quickening rain,  
And what has befallen the light of the sun?

Hafiz, the secret of God's dread task  
No man knoweth, in youth or prime  
Or in wisest age; of whom would’st thou ask:  
What has befallen the wheels of Time?
