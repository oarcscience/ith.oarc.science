*Poems from the Divan of Hafiz*, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, \[1897\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## X

This song is not to be found in the best editions of the Divan, and is
believed to be spurious; but it is printed in most of the popular
editions, and is as widely known as any of the poems which pass with a
better right under the name of Hafiz. It is set to a soft and well-nigh
tuneless air which sounds like dream music, or the echo of something
very beautiful coming from a great distance, the singer ending on an
almost whispered repetition of the first exquisite phrase. I have been
told that the boatmen on the Ganges sing it as they row, and the
monotonous accompaniment of the water under the oars must be even more
fitting to the melody than that of the lute strings.
