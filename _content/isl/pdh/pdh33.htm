<p>THE breath of Dawn's musk-strewing wind shall blow,<br> The ancient world shall turn to youth again,<br> And other wines from out Spring's chalice flow;<br> Wine-red, the judas-tree shall set before<br> The pure white jessamine a brimming cup,<br> And wind flowers lift their scarlet chalice up<br> For the star-pale narcissus to adore.</p>  
<p>The long-drawn tyranny of grief shall pass,<br> Parting shall end in meeting, the lament<br> Of the sad bird that sang "Alas, alas!"<br> Shall reach the rose in her red-curtained tent.<br> Forth from the mosque! the tavern calls to me!<br> Would'st hinder us? The preacher's homily<br> Is long, but life will soon be spent!</p>  
<p>Ah, foolish Heart! the pleasures of To-day,<br> If thou abandon, will To-morrow stand<br> Thy surety for the gold thou'st thrown away?<br> In Sha'aban the troops of Grief disband,<br> And crown the hours with wine's red coronet&#151;<br> The sun of merriment ere long will set,<br> And meagre Ramazan is close at hand!</p>  
<p>Dear is the rose&#151;now, now her sweets proclaim,<br> While yet the purple petals blush and blow;<br> Hither adown the path of Spring she came,<br> And by the path of Autumn she will go.<br> Now, while we listen, Minstrel, tune thy lay!<br> Thyself hast said: "The Present steals away<br> The Future comes, and bringing&#151;what? Dost know?"</p>  
<p>Summoned by thy melody did Hafiz rise<br> Out of the darkness near thy lips to dwell;<br> Back to the dark again his pathway lies&#151;<br> Sing out, sing clear, and singing cry: Farewell!</p>
