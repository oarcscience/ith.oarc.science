<p>MY lady, that did change this house of mine<br> Into a heaven when that she dwelt therein,<br> From head to foot an angel's grace divine<br> Enwrapped her; pure she was, spotless of sin;<br> Fair as the moon her countenance, and wise;<br> Lords of the kind and tender glance, her eyes<br> With an abounding loveliness did shine.</p>  
<p>Then said my heart: Here will I take my rest!<br> This city breathes her love in every part.<br> But to a distant bourne was she addressed,<br> Alas! he knew it not, alas, poor heart!<br> The influence of some cold malignant star<br> Has loosed my hand that held her, lone and far<br> She journeyeth that lay upon my breast.</p>  
<p>Not only did she lift my bosom's veil,<br> Reveal its inmost secret, but her grace<br> Drew back the curtain from Heaven's mansions pale,<br> And gave her there an eternal dwelling-place.<br> The flower-strewn river lip and meadows fair,<br> The rose herself but fleeting treasures were,<br> Regret and Winter follow in their trail.</p>  
<p>Dear were the days which perished with my friend&#151;<br> Ah, what is left of life, now she is dead,<br> All wisdomless and profitless I spend!<br> The nightingale his own life's blood doth shed,<br> When, to the kisses of the wind, the morn<br> Unveils the rose's splendour&#151;with his torn<br> And jealous breast he dyes her petals red.</p>  
<p>Yet pardon her, oh Heart, for poor wert thou,<br> A humble dervish on the dusty way;<br> Crowned with the crown of empire was her brow,<br> And in the realms of beauty she bore sway.<br> But all the joy that Hafiz&#146; hand might hold,<br> Lay in the beads that morn and eve he told,<br> Worn with God's praise; and see! he holds it now.</p>
