<p>NOT all the sum of earthly happiness<br> Is worth the bowed head of a moment's pain,<br> And if I sell for wine my dervish dress,<br> Worth more than what I sell is what I gain!<br> Land where my Lady dwells, thou holdest me<br> Enchained; else Fars were but a barren soil,<br> Not worth the journey over land and sea,<br> Not worth the toil!</p>  
<p>Down in the quarter where they sell red wine,<br> My holy carpet scarce would fetch a cup<br> How brave a pledge of piety is mine,<br> Which is not worth a goblet foaming up!<br> Mine enemy heaped scorn on me and said<br> "Forth from the tavern gate!" Why am I thrust<br> From off the threshold? is my fallen head<br> Not worth the dust?</p>  
<p>Wash white that travel-stained sad robe of thine!<br> Where word and deed alike one colour bear,<br> The grape's fair purple garment shall outshine<br> Thy many-coloured rags and tattered gear.<br> Full easy seemed the sorrow of the sea<br> Lightened by hope of gain&#151;hope flew too fast<br> A hundred pearls were poor indemnity,<br> Not worth the blast.</p>  
<p>The Sultan's crown, with priceless jewels set,<br> Encircles fear of death and constant dread<br> It is a head-dress much desired&#151;and yet<br> Art sure 'tis worth the danger to the head?<br> 'Twere best for thee to hide thy face from those<br> That long for thee; the Conqueror's reward<br> Is never worth the army's long-drawn woes,<br> Worth fire and sword.</p>  
<p>Ah, seek the treasure of a mind at rest<br> And store it in the treasury of Ease;<br> Not worth a loyal heart, a tranquil breast,<br> Were all the riches of thy lands and seas!<br> Ah, scorn, like Hafiz, the delights of earth,<br> Ask not one grain of favour from the base,<br> Two hundred sacks of jewels were not worth<br> Thy soul's disgrace!</p>
