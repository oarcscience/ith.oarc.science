<p>FORGET not when dear friend to friend returned,<br> Forget not days gone by, forget them not!<br> My mouth has tasted bitterness, and learned<br> To drink the envenomed cup of mortal lot;<br> Forget not when a sweeter draught was mine,<br> Loud rose the songs of them that drank that wine&#151;<br> Forget them not!</p>  
<p>Forget not loyal lovers long since dead,<br> Though faith and loyalty should be forgot,<br> Though the earth cover the enamoured head,<br> And in the dust wisdom and passion rot.<br> My friends have thrust me from their memory;<br> Vainly a thousand thousand times I cry:<br> Forget me not!</p>  
<p>Weary I turn me to my bonds again.<br> Once there were hands strong to deliver me,<br> Forget not when they broke a poor slave's chain!<br> Though from mine eyes tears flow unceasingly,<br> I think on them whose rose gardens are set<br> Beside the Zindeh Rud, and I forget<br> Life's misery.</p>  
<p>Sorrow has made her lair in my breast,<br> And undisturbed she lies&#151;forget them not<br> That drove her forth like to a hunted beast!<br> Hafiz, thou and thy tears shall be forgot,<br> Lock fast the gates of thy sad heart! But those<br> That held the key to thine unspoken woes&#151;<br> Forget them not!</p>
