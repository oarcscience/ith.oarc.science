<P>The path of religion is neither in works nor words; there are no buildings thereon, but only desolation. Whoso becomes silent to pursue the path, his speech is life and sweetness; if he speaks, it will not be out of ignorance, and if he is silent, it will not be from sloth; when silent, he is not devising frivolity; when speaking, he scatters abroad no trifling talk.</P>
<P>Those fools, the thieves and pickpockets, keep their knowledge to use in highway robbery. Thou seest, O Master, thou of many words, that thou hadst better have light in thy heart than words; when thou becomest silent, thou art most eloquent, but if thou speakest, thou art like a captain of war. '<I>Kun</I>,' consists of two letters, both voiceless; '<I>H&ucirc;</I>' consists of two letters, both silent. Doubt not concerning these words of mine; open thine eyes, pay heed for a little.</P>
<P>There exists the dog, and the stone; the stove of the bath, and the slave; but thou art excellent, like a jewel inside a casket. The king uses his silver for his daily needs, but his ruby be keeps for his treasure-house; silver is evil in its own ill-starred nature, the ruby is joyous because it is full of blood within.</P>

<P>pronounced their destruction, their name endures, indestructible as the spirit. The people of this generation, though amiable, are impudent as flies and wanton; in word they are all sweet as sugar, but when it comes to generosity, they tear men's hearts and burn their souls.</P>
<P>When He had adorned thy soul within thee, He held up before thee the mirror of the light; till pride made thee quick to anger, and thou lookedst upon thyself with the evil eye.</P>
<P>He has balanced day and night by the ruler of his justice, not by chance or at random.</P>
<P>While Reason digs for the secret, thou hast reached thy goal on the plain of Love.</P>
<P>The heart and soul of the seeker after God are concealed, but his tongue proclaims in truth, '<I>I am God</I>.'</P>
