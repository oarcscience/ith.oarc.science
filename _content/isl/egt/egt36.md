# ON CELEBRATING THE PRAISE OF GOD.

To call on the name of friends, and the unhappy ones of this world, how
thinkest thou of it? It is like calling on old women. Oppression, if He
ordain it, is all justice; a life without thought of Him is all wind. He
laughs who is brought to tears through Him; but that heart is an anvil
that thinks not on Him. Thou art secure when thou pronouncest His
name,--thou keepest a firm footing on thy path; make thou thy tongue
moist, like earth, with remembrance of Him, that He may fill thy mouth,
like the rose, with gold. He fills with life the soul of the wise man;
the heart of the lover of self He leaves thirsty. That thy purpose and
judgment may be true, have not His door at all; to pay heed to those
about us is the act of a thoughtless fool.
