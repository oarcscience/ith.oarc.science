# THE PARABLE OF THOSE WHO GIVE ALMS.

A certain wise and liberal man gave away so many bags of gold before his
son's eyes that when he saw his father's munificence he broke forth into
censure and remonstrance, saying, Father, where is my share of this? He
said, O son, in the treasury of God; I have given to God thy portion,
leaving no executor and none to divide it with thee, and He will give it
thee again.

He is Himself our Provider and our Master; shall He not suffice us, both
for faith and worldly goods? He is no other than the disposer of our
lives; He will not oppress thee,--He is not of those. To everyone He
gives back seventy-fold; and if He closes one door against thee, He
opens ten.
