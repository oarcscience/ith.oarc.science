# OF THE GUIDANCE OF THE QUR'ÂN.

It is the guide, and the lovers the travellers; it is a rope, and the
heedless sit in the pit. Thy soul has its home at the pit's bottom; the
Qur'ân's light is a rope let down to it; rise and seize the rope, so
thou mayest haply find salvation; else thou art lost in the pit's
depth,--flood and storm will destroy thee. Like Yûsuf thou art brought
by Satan into the pit; be thy wisdom the glad tidings, thy rope the
Qur'ân; if thou desirest to be as Yûsuf, and to enjoy high place, take
hold of it and come forth from the well.

The wise use the rope to obtain the water of life, but thou makest ready
thy rope to dance on it for daily bread. No one learns two letters of
the Qur'ân in a thousand centuries with such an eye as thine; the
understanding's arm turns about as does a wheel; body and soul are
captives of thy passions. If thou desirest throne and crown and honour,
why sittest thou for ever at the well's bottom? Thy Yûsuf is helpless in
the well, thy heart reciting the sûra '*safah*'; (Qur. 2:12) make of
sorrow a rope, of thy sighs a bucket, and draw up thy Yûsuf from the
well.
