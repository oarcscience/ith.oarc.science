# OF THOSE WHO HEED NOT.

A discerning man questioned one of the indifferent, whom he saw to be
very foolish and thoughtless, saying, Hast thou ever seen saffron, or
hast thou only heard the name? He said, I have it by me, and have eaten
a good deal of it, not once only, but a hundred times and more. Said the
wise and discerning man to him, Bravo, wretch! Well done, my friend!
Thou knowest not that there is a bulb as well! How long wilt thou wag
thy beard in thy folly?

He who knows not his own soul, how shall he know the soul of another?
and he who only knows hand and foot, how shall he know the Godhead? The
prophets are unequal to understanding this matter; why dost thou
foolishly claim to do so? When thou hast brought forward a demonstration
of this subject, then thou wilt know the pure essence of the faith;
otherwise what have faith and thou in common? thou hadst best be silent,
and speak not folly. The learned talk nonsense all; for true religion is
not woven about the feet of everyone.
