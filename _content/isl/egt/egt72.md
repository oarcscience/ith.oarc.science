# ON LAUD AND PRAISE.

In every mouth the tongue that utters speech becomes fragrant as musk in
praising Thee. In Thy decree and will, as Thou art far or near, lies for
the heart and soul eternal happiness or ruinous disaster, an
imperishable kingdom or everlasting beguilement; Thy servants wander to
and fro by day and night, all seeking Thyself from Thee. Fortune, and
empire, and the glory of both worlds he knows who understands things
manifest and hidden, yet longs not for them; for all is nothing without
Thee,--nothing. Destruction and creation are alike easy to Thee; all
that Thou hast willed, takes place. The cunning man, though mightier he
be, is yet the feebler in Thy praise; or in this court Zâl-i-zar, though
full of fury, is powerless as an old woman; in face of Thy decree of
'*Be, and it was*,' no one dares to question, 'What is this? How comes
that?'
