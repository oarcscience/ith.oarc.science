# ON DREAMS OF WILD ANIMALS.

A lion is a powerful and haughty adversary whose actions show no regard
for humanity. An elephant is a king,--but a terrible one, whose rage is
feared by all. Fortune and wealth come before thee as a sheep; a year of

every way advantageous;-this is no more than my master's words. The

bear is a treacherous adversary, and a robber; no one will come by any

enemies, evil-disposed every one of them. And although the fox is a
worker of wiles, yet it is still worse if thou see one dead. Every snake
is a rancorous enemy; but again it is worse for thee if it makes towards

denote calamities. Though in waking life a dog is a shepherd, in a dream
it means war.
