<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">TOWERING as Barkaidy's face,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The wintry night came in,<br> Cold as the music of his bass,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And lengthened as his chin.</p>  
<p>Sleep from my aching eyes had fled,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And kept as far apart<br> As sense from Ebn Fadhi's head,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Or virtue from his heart.</p>  
<p>The dubious paths my footsteps balked,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I slipped along the sod,<br> As if on Jaber's faith I'd walked,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Or on his truth had trod.</p>  
<p>At length the rising King of Day<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Burst on the gloomy wood,<br> Like Carawash's eye, whose ray<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Dispenses every good.</div></p>
