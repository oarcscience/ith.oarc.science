<p><small>[THIS author was a native of Syria, and died at Miafarakir, in the year of the Hejra 553.]</small></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">AS drenched in wine, the other night,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Zeid from the banquet sallied,<br> Thus I reproved his drunken plight,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he my prudence rallied:</p>  
<p>"In beverage so impure and vile<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How canst thou thus delight?"<br> "My cups," he answered, with a smile,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"Are generous and bright."</p>  
<p>"Beware those dangerous draughts," I cried;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"With love the goblet flows."<br> "And cursed is he," the youth replied,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"Who hatred only knows!"</p>  
<p>"Those cups too soon, with sickness fraught,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy stomach shall deplore."<br> "Then soon," he cried, "the noxious draught<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And all its ills are o&#8217;er."</p>  
<p>"Rash youth! thy guilty joys resign"&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"I will," at length he said:<br> "I vow I'll bid adieu to wine&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I am dead!"</div></p>
