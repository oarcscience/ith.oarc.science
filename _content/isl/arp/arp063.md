#### TO LEILA.

LEILA, with too successful art,  
  Has spread for me Love's cruel snare;  
And now, when she has caught my heart,  
  She laughs, and leaves it to despair.

Thus the poor sparrow pants for breath,  
  Held captive by a playful boy;  
And while it drinks the draught of death,  
  The thoughtless child looks on with joy.

Ah! were its fluttering pinions free,  
  Soon would it bid its chains adieu;  
Or did the child its sufferings see,  
  He'd pity and relieve them too.
