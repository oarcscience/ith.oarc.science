<P>
This is an anthology of 19th century Orientalist
translations of Arabian poetry, many of which are very rare, as is this
particular book.
Most of the included works either predated Muhammed or were contemporary,
so there are many fascinating bits of pre-Islamic lore.
Included is the Moallakat, or the 'Hanged' Poems, a collection of seven
pre-Islamic poets whose works were once displayed (i.e. 'hanged')
in the Ka'ba.
Another highlight is a synopsis of the 'Romance of Antar,' an oral
saga of a brave prince of old Arabia, and many deeds of derring-do.
The one downside here is all of the variant ways of
transliterating Arabic words, which
probably will take an specialist in Arabic literature to sort out.
