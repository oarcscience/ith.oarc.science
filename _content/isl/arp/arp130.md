### DEATH OF PRINCE SHAS AND KING ZOHEIR.

About this time Prince Shas, while journeying through the land of Aamir,
was foully murdered by a huntsman, called Thalaba. The Prince's
attendant escaped to carry the tidings to King Zoheir, who immediately
placed himself at the head of his warriors, and set out to avenge his
son's death. Khalid, the chief of the tribe, being absent in Irak, the
Aamirites feared to oppose the Absians, and offered to pay King Zoheir
ten times the usual price of blood. The King refused to compound with
them for the murder of his son, but after assailing the tribe, he was
duped into granting a truce, of which the Aamirites availed themselves
to occupy a strong position in the mountains, where they continued in
safety during the few days that remained before the sacred month of
Rejeb, when war ceased among the Arabs. Hostilities are renewed as soon
as the sacred month is past; and Khalid,

having in the interim returned from Irak, encounters King Zoheir, who is
slain by a foul stroke from Jandah, one of Khalid's followers; and the
Absians, being discomfited, return to their own land.
