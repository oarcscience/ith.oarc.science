<p>LEILA, with too successful art,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Has spread for me Love's cruel snare;<br> And now, when she has caught my heart,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;She laughs, and leaves it to despair.</p>  
<p>Thus the poor sparrow pants for breath,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Held captive by a playful boy;<br> And while it drinks the draught of death,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughtless child looks on with joy.</p>  
<p>Ah! were its fluttering pinions free,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon would it bid its chains adieu;<br> Or did the child its sufferings see,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He'd pity and relieve them too.</p>
