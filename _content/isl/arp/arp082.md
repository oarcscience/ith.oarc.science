#### A REMONSTRANCE WITH A DRUNKARD.

##### BY YAHIA BEN SALAMET.

<span class="small">\[THIS author was a native of Syria, and died at
Miafarakir, in the year of the Hejra 553.\]</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

AS drenched in wine, the other night,  
  Zeid from the banquet sallied,  
Thus I reproved his drunken plight,  
  Thus he my prudence rallied:

"In beverage so impure and vile  
  How canst thou thus delight?"  
"My cups," he answered, with a smile,  
  "Are generous and bright."

"Beware those dangerous draughts," I cried;  
  "With love the goblet flows."  
"And cursed is he," the youth replied,  
  "Who hatred only knows!"

"Those cups too soon, with sickness fraught,  
  Thy stomach shall deplore."  
"Then soon," he cried, "the noxious draught  
  And all its ills are o’er."

"Rash youth! thy guilty joys resign"—  
  "I will," at length he said:  
"I vow I'll bid adieu to wine—  
  As soon as I am dead!"
