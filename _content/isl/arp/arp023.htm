<TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/08200.jpg" ALT="D"></TD></TR></TABLE>DOTH fair Asoma give us notice of her departure? Oh, why are sojourners so frequently weary of their sojourning?</p>  
<p>2. <i>She is resolved to depart</i>, after our mutual vows among the sandy hillocks of Shamma, and in the nearer station of Khalsa;&#8212;</p>  
<p>3. <i>Vows, repeated in</i> Mohayat, Sifah, and Aglai, in Dhu Fitak, Adhib, and Wafa;&#8212;</p>  
<p>4. <i>Vows, renewed</i> in the bowers of Katha, and the dales of Shoreib, in the Two Valleys, and in the plains of Ayla.</p>  
<p>5. I see no remains of the troth which she plighted in those stations; and I waste the day in tears, frantic with grief; but oh, what part of my happiness will tears restore?</p>  
<p>6. Yet, O Hareth, <i>a new passion invites thee;</i> for Hinda is before thy eyes, and the fire which she kindles at night in the hills will direct thee to her abode:</p>  
<p>7. She kindles it with abundance of wood between the hilly stations of Akeik and Shakhsein, and it blazes like the splendour of the sun.</p>  
<p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></A></p>  
<p>8. I have been contemplating her fire from a distance on the hill whence our excursions are made; but oh, the scorching heat and the calamities of war prevent me from approaching her</p>  
<p>9. But I seek assistance in dispelling my care, when the sojourner of the tent hastily leaves his abode <i>through fear of some impending calamity</i>,</p>  
<p>10. On a camel, swift as an ostrich, the mother of many young ones; the long-necked inhabitant of the desert,</p>  
<p>11. Who hears a soft sound, and dreads the approach of the hunter, in the afternoon, just before the dusk of evening:</p>  
<p>12. Then mayst thou see behind her, from the quick motion of her legs, and the force with which she strikes the earth, a cloud of dust, thin as the gossamer,</p>  
<p>13. And the traces of her hoofs, which are such as to be soon effaced by the winds blowing over the sandy plain.</p>  
<p>14. With her I disport myself in the sultry noon, whilst every son of valour is like a blind camel devoted to death.</p>  
<p>15. Yet misfortunes and evil tidings have brought on us affairs which give us affliction and anguish;</p>  
<p>16. For our brethren, the family of Arakem, <i>the dragon-eyed</i>, have transgressed the bounds of justice against us, and have been vehement in their invectives:</p>  
<p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></A></p>  
<p>17. They have confounded the blameless among us with the guilty, and the most perfect innocence has not escaped their censure.</p>  
<p>18. They have insisted that all who pitch their tents in the desert are our associates, and that we are involved in their offences.</p>  
<p>19. They assembled their forces at night, and as soon as the dawn appeared, there was nothing heard among them but a tumultuous noise</p>  
<p>20. Of those who called and those who answered; the neighing of horses, and, among the rest, the lowing of camels.</p>  
<p>21. O thou, who adornest thy flowery speeches concerning us before Amru, can this falsehood be long undetected?</p>  
<p>22. Imagine not that thy instigation will animate him against us, or humiliate us; since long before thee our enemies have openly calumniated us;</p>  
<p>23. Yet we continued advancing ourselves in defiance of their hate, with laudable self-sufficiency and exalted reputation.</p>  
<p>24. Before this day, the eyes of nations have been dazzled by our glory, and have been moved by envious indignation and obstinate resentment.</p>  
<p>25. Fortune seemed to raise for us a dark rock,. with a pointed summit, dispelling the clouds;</p>  
<p>26. Thick and firm, secured from calamity; not to be weakened by any disaster, however grievous and violent.</p>  
<p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></A></p>  
<p>27.* Intrust to our wisdom every momentous affair from which you desire to be extricated, and by which the assemblies of chiefs are made unhappy.</p>  
<p>28.* If you inquire concerning our wars between Milaha and Dhakib, you will find on their plains many an unavenged and many an avenged corse:</p>  
<p>29.* Or, if you examine diligently the questions in which all tribes are deeply interested, you will see the difference between your offences and our innocence.</p>  
<p>30.* But if you decline <i>this fair discussion</i>, we shall turn from you with resentment, concealing hatred in our bosoms, as the mote is concealed in the closed eyelids.</p>  
<p>31.* Reject, if you please, the terms which we offer; but of whom have you heard that surpasses us in glory?</p>  
<p>32.* You have perfectly known us on the days when the warriors have assailed one another with rapacious violence, when every tribe has raised a tumultuous din;</p>  
<p>33.* When we brought up our camels from the palm-groves of Bahrein, and drove them by rapid marches, till we reached the plain of Hisa.</p>  
<p>34. Then we advanced against the sons of Tameim, and when the sacred month required a cessation of our war, we carried away the daughters of their tribe for our handmaids.</p>  
<p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></A></p>  
<p>35. <i>In opposition to us</i>, neither could the valiant man keep his ground on the level field, nor did precipitate flight avail the faint-hearted.</p>  
<p>36. No; the coward, who ran hastily from the plain, was not saved by the summit of rocks or the roughness of craggy paths.</p>  
<p>37. By these exertions we maintained our preeminence over the tribes, until Mondir, son of the beautiful Maisema, obtained the dominion.</p>  
<p>38. He was a prince who bore witness to our valour on the day of Hayarain, when the calamity of war was, in truth, a calamity:</p>  
<p>39. A prince who subjected nations; whose equal in magnanimity could not be found among them.</p>  
<p>40. Desist then from vaunting and from hostility: you have indeed pretended ignorance of our claims, but from that pretended ignorance will proceed your woe.</p>  
<p>41. Remember well the oaths taken in Dhu&#8217;lmejaaz: the covenants and vows of amity, which were made there of old.</p>  
<p>42. Beware of injustice and violence; nor let your intemperate passions impel you to violate your contracts written on tablets.</p>  
<p>43. Know, that we and you, on the day when we made our treaty, were equally bound by our respective engagements.</p>  
<p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></A></p>  
<p>44. Are we responsible for the crimes of Canda? Shall their conquering chief have the spoils, and shall reprisals be made upon us?</p>  
<p>45. Are we responsible for the excesses of Haneifa, and for all the conflicts which the dusty plain has seen accumulated?</p>  
<p>46. Must we answer for the offences of the sons of Ateik? No: whoever has broken his covenant, we are innocent of their war.</p>  
<p>47. Doth the guilt of Ibaad hang on our heads, as the burden is suspended on the centre of the camel's girths?</p>  
<p>48. Has the blame due to Kodhaa fallen upon us? or, rather, are we not secure from a single drop of their faults?</p>  
<p>49. Are we responsible for the crimes of Iyaad, as it was said to the tribe of Thasm, "Your brethren are rebels?"</p>  
<p>50. Those who raised the dissension belong not to us, neither Kais, nor Jondal, nor Hadda.</p>  
<p>51. Vain pretexts! Unjust aspersions! <i>That we should suffer for others</i>, as the roe is sacrificed in the place of the sheep!</p>  
<p>52. Fourscore warriors, indeed, advanced from Taureim, and their hands carried lances, whose points were Fate;</p>  
<p>53. Yet they profaned not the hallowed places of the sons of Rizaah on the hills of Nitaa, when they called on them for mercy.</p>  
<p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="green">p. 88</font></A></p>  
<p>54. They left them, however, wounded on the plain, and returned with captive herds and flocks so numerous, that the drivers of them were deafened with their cries.</p>  
<p>55. The vanquished tribe came afterwards to implore restitution, but not a single beast, either black or of a bright hue, was restored to them.</p>  
<p>56. So they retired with heart-breaking afflictions, nor could any stream of water quench their ardent rage.</p>  
<p>57. After this a troop of horsemen, led by the impetuous Ghallaak, assailed them without remorse or pity:</p>  
<p>58. Full many a son of Tagleb has been smitten, whose blood has flowed unrevenged, while the black dust covered his corse.</p>  
<p>59. Are your cares comparable to those of our tribe, when Mondir waged war against them? Are we, <i>like you</i>, become subject to the son of Hinda?</p>  
<p>60. When he fixed his abode in the lofty turrets of Maisuna, and sojourned in the nearer stations of Khaltha,</p>  
<p>61. From every tribe there flocked around him a company of robbers, impetuous as eagles:</p>  
<p>62. He led them on, and supplied them with dates and with water; so the will of God was accomplished, and afflicted men doomed to affliction.</p>  
<p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></A></p>  
<p>63. Then you invited them to attack you by your want of circumspection; and the vain security of your intemperate joy impelled them to be hostile.</p>  
<p>64. They surprised you not, indeed, by a sudden assault; but <i>they advanced, and</i> the sultry vapour of noon, <i>through which you saw them</i>, increased their magnitude.</p>  
<p>65. O thou inveterate and glozing calumniator, who inveighest against us before King Amru, will there be no end of thy unjust invectives?</p>  
<p>66. Between Amru and us many acts of amity have passed, and from all of them, no doubt, has benefit arisen.</p>  
<p>67. He is a just prince, and the most accomplished that walks the earth: all praise is below his merit:</p>  
<p>68. A prince descended from Irem! A warrior like him ought ever to be encircled with troops of genii, for he protects his domain, and refuses to punish even his opponents:</p>  
<p>69. A monarch who knows us by three infallible signs, by each of which our excellence is decided:&#8212;</p>  
<p>70. <i>The first is</i>, the conspicuous token of our valour, when all Arabia came forth in the rocky vales, each tribe of Maad under their banner,</p>  
<p>71. And assembled, in complete armour, round the warlike Kais, that valiant prince of Yemen, who stood <i>firm and brilliant</i> like a white cliff.</p>  
<p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></A></p>  
<p>72. Then came a legion of high-born youths, whom nothing could restrain but our long and glittering spears;</p>  
<p>73. But we repelled them with strokes, <i>which made their blood gush from their sides</i>, as the water streams from the mouth of a bottle which contains it.</p>  
<p>74. We drove them for refuge to the craggy hills of Thahlaan; we thrust them before us, till the muscles of their thighs were breeched in gore.</p>  
<p>75. We did with them a deed, the name of which God only knows; and no revenge could be taken for the blood of men who sought their own fate.</p>  
<p>76. Next advanced Hojar, son of Ommi Kathaam, with an army of Persians, clad in discoloured brass:</p>  
<p>77. A lion in the conflict, of a ruddy hue, trampling on his prey; but a vernal season of beneficence in every barren year.</p>  
<p>78. Yet we smote them on the foreheads with the edges of our scimitars, which quivered in their flesh, like buckets drawn from a deep well encircled with stone.</p>  
<p>79. <i>Secondly</i>, we broke the chains of Amriolkais, after his long imprisonment and anguish.</p>  
<p>80. We forcibly revenged the death of Mondir, king of Gassaan, that his blood might not flow in vain.</p>  
<p>81. We redeemed our captives with nine kings of illustrious race, whose spoils were exceedingly precious.</p>  
<p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></A></p>  
<p>82. With the horses, with the dark horses of the sons of Aus, came whole squadrons, fierce as eagles with crooked beaks:</p>  
<p>83. We scarce had passed through the cloud of dust when they turned their backs; and then how dreadfully blazed the fire of our vengeance!</p>  
<p>84. <i>Lastly</i>, we gave birth to Amru, the son of Omm Ayaas; for not long ago were the bridal gifts presented to us, <i>as kinsmen</i>.</p>  
<p>85. May our faithful admonition reach all our kindred tribes, extended as wide as our consanguinity, in plains beyond plains!</p>
