<p><small>He had no sooner finished. than Rakeek began, and in the same versification, and to the same air, sung as follows:</small></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">RAKEEK TO HIS FEMALE COMPANIONS.</h3>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">THOUGH the peevish tongues upbraid,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Though the brows of wisdom scowl,<br> Fair ones, here on roses laid,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Careless will we quaff the bowl.</p>  
<p>Let the cup, with nectar crowned,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Through the grove its beams display;<br> It can shed a lustre round,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Brighter than the torch of Day.</p>  
<p>Let it pass from hand to hand,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Circling still with ceaseless flight,<br> Till the streaks of gray expand<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;O&#8217;er the fleeting robe of Night.</p>  
<p>As Night flits, she does but cry.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"Seize the moments that remain":<br> Thus our joys with yours shall vie,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Tenants of yon hallowed fane!</div></p>
