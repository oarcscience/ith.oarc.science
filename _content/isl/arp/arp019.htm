<p><A NAME="img_05400"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/05400.jpg" ALT="H">HAVE the bards who preceded me left any theme unsung? <i>What, therefore, shall be my subject? Love only must supply my lay</i>. Dost thou then recollect, after long consideration, the mansion of thy beloved?</p>  
<p>2. O bower of Abla, in the valley of Jiwaa, give me tidings of my love! O bower of Abla, may the morning rise on thee with prosperity and health!</p>  
<p>3. There I stopped my camel, large as a tower, the anguish of my passion having delayed the accomplishment of my bold enterprise,</p>  
<p>4. Whilst Abla was dwelling in Jiwaa, and our tribe <i>were stationed</i> in Hazn, and Samaan, and Motathallem.</p>  
<p>5. Hail, dear ruins! with whose possessors I had old engagements; more dreary and more desolate <i>are you become</i>, after the departure <i>of my beloved</i> Omm Alheitham!</p>  
<p>6. She dwells in the land of my foes, like roaring lions: oh, how painful has been my search after thee, fair daughter of Makhrem!</p>  
<p>7. I felt myself attached to her at our first interview, although I had slain her countrymen in battle: I assure thee, by the life of thy father, that of my attachment there can be no doubt.</p>  
<p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></A></p>  
<p>8. <i>Thou hast possessed thyself of my heart;</i> thou hast fixed thy abode in it (imagine not that I delude thee), and art settled there as a beloved and cherished inhabitant.</p>  
<p>9. Yet how can I visit <i>my fair one</i>, whilst her family have their vernal mansion in Oneizatain, and mine are stationed in Ghailem?</p>  
<p>10. Surely thou hast firmly resolved to depart from me, since the camels of thy tribe are bridled even in so dark a night.</p>  
<p>11. Nothing so much alarms me <i>with a signal of her destined removal</i> as my seeing the camels of burden, which belong to her tribe, grazing on khimkhim-berries in the midst of their tents:</p>  
<p>12. Among them <i>are</i> forty-two milch-camels, dark as the plumes of a coal-black raven.</p>  
<p>13. Then, Antara, she pierced thee to the heart with her well-pointed teeth exquisitely white, the kiss of which is delicious, and the taste ravishingly sweet!</p>  
<p>14. From the mouth of this lovely damsel, when you kiss her lips, proceeds the fragrance of musk, as from the vase of a perfumer;</p>  
<p>15. Or like the scent of a blooming bower, whose plants the gentle rains have kept in continual verdure, which no filth has sullied, and to which there has been no resort:</p>  
<p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></A></p>  
<p>16. Every morning-cloud, clear of hail, has drenched it with a plentiful shower, and has left all the little cavities in the earth both round and bright as coins of silver:</p>  
<p>17. Profusely and copiously it descends; and every evening the stream, which nothing intercepts, gushes rapidly through it.</p>  
<p>18. The flies remain in it with incessant buzzing, and their murmurs are like the song of a man exhilarated with wine:</p>  
<p>19. Their sound, when they strike their slender legs against each other, is like the sound of a flint, from which the sparks are forced by a man with one arm, intent upon his labour.</p>  
<p>20. While thou, <i>fair</i> Abla, reclinest both evening and morning on the lap of a soft couch, I p&#257;ss whole nights on the back of a dark-coloured horse well caparisoned:</p>  
<p>21. My only cushion is the saddle of a charger with firm thick feet, strong-sided, and large in the place of his girths.</p>  
<p>22. Shall a camel of Shaden bear me to thy tent, <i>a camel</i>, far removed from her country, destitute of milk, and separated from the herd?</p>  
<p>23. She waves her tail in her playful mood, and proudly moves her body from side to side, even at the end of her nightly excursion: she strikes the hills with her quickly-moving and firmly-trampling hoofs.</p>  
<p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></A></p>  
<p>24. Thus the bird without ears, between whose feet there is but a small space, <i>the swift ostrich</i> beats the ground in his evening course.</p>  
<p>25. The young ostriches gather themselves around him, as a multitude of black Yemenian camels assemble round their Abyssinian <i>herdman</i>, who is unable to express himself <i>in the language of Arabia</i>.</p>  
<p>26. They follow him, guided by the loftiness of his head, which resembles the carriage of travelling damsels, raised on high, and covered like a tent.</p>  
<p>27. His head, <i>though lofty</i>, is small: when he is going to visit the eggs, <i>which his female left</i> in Dhulasheira, he looks like an Ethiop with short ears in a trailing garment of furred hides.</p>  
<p>28. <i>My camel</i> drinks the water of Dehradhain, but starts aside with disdain from the <i>hostile</i> rivulets of Dailem.</p>  
<p>29. She turns her right side, as if she were in fear of some large-headed screamer of the night,&#8212;</p>  
<p>30. Of a hideous wild-cat fixed to her body, who, as often as she bent herself towards him in her wrath, assailed her with his claws and his teeth.</p>  
<p>31. I continue all day on the well-cemented tower of her back, strongly raised, and firm as the pillars of him who pitches a tent.</p>  
<p>32. <i>When she rests</i>, she crouches on the soft bank of Ridaa, and groans through fatigue, like the soft sounding reed, which she presses with her weight.</p>  
<p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></A></p>  
<p>33. <i>Her sweat</i> resembles thick rob or tenacious pitch, which the kindled fire causes to bubble in the sides of a caldron;</p>  
<p>34. It gushes from behind her ears, when she boils with rage, exults in her strength, and struts in her pride, like the stallion of her herd, when his rivals assail him.</p>  
<p>35. O Abla, although thou droppest thy veil before me, yet know, that by my agility I have made captive many a knight clad in complete armour.</p>  
<p>36. Bestow on me the commendation which thou knowest to be due; since my nature is gentle and mild, when my rights are not invaded;</p>  
<p>37. But, when I am injured, my resentment is firm, and bitter as coloquinteda to the taste of the aggressor.</p>  
<p>38. I quaff; when the noontide heat is abated, old wine, purchased with bright and well-stamped coin;</p>  
<p>39. I quaff it in a goblet of yellow glass variegated with white streaks, whose companion is a glittering flagon, well secured by its lid from the blasts of the north:</p>  
<p>40. When I drink it, my wealth is dissipated, but my fame remains abundant and unimpaired;</p>  
<p>41. And when I return to sobriety, the dew of my liberality continues as fresh as before: give due honour, therefore, to those qualities which thou knowest me to possess.</p>  
<p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></A></p>  
<p>42. Many a consort of a fair one, whose beauty required no ornaments, have I left prostrate on the ground; and the life-blood has run sounding from his veins, opened by my javelin, like the mouth of a camel with a divided lip:</p>  
<p>43. With a nimble and double-handed stroke, I prevented his attack; and the stream that gushed from the penetrating wound bore the colour of anemones.</p>  
<p>44. Go, ask the warriors, O daughter of Malec, if thou art ignorant of my valour, <i>ask them</i> that which thou knowest not;</p>  
<p>45. <i>Ask how</i> I act, when I am constantly fixed to the saddle of an elegant horse, swimming in his course, whom my bold antagonists alternately wound;</p>  
<p>46. Yet sometimes he advances alone to the conflict, and sometimes he stands collected in a multitudinous throng of heroes with strong bows:</p>  
<p>47. <i>Ask</i>, and whoever has been witness to the combat will inform thee that I am impetuous in battle, but regardless of the spoils.</p>  
<p>48. Many a warrior, clad in a suit of mail, at whose violent assault the boldest men have trembled, who neither had saved himself by swift flight nor by abject submission,</p>  
<p>49. Has this arm laid prone with a rapid blow from a well-straightened javelin, firm between the knots:</p>  
<p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></A></p>  
<p>50. Broad were the lips of the wound; and the noise of the rushing blood called forth the wolves, prowling in the night, and pinched with hunger:</p>  
<p>51. With my swift lance did I pierce his coat of mail; and no warrior, however brave, is secure from its point.</p>  
<p>52. I left him, like a sacrificed victim, to the lions of the forest, who feasted on him between the crown of his head and his wrists.</p>  
<p>53. Often have I burst the interior folds of a well-wrought habergeon, worn by a famed warrior appointed to maintain his post;</p>  
<p>54. Whose hands were brisk in casting lots, when winter demands such recreation: a man censured for his disregard of wealth, and for causing the wine-merchant to strike his flag, <i>by purchasing all his store</i>.</p>  
<p>55. When he saw me descend from my steed, and rush towards him, he grinned with horror, but with no smile of joy.</p>  
<p>56. My engagement with him lasted the whole day, until his head and fingers, covered with clotted gore, appeared to be stained with the juice of idhlim.</p>  
<p>57. Then I fixed him with my lance; I struck him to the heart with an Indian scimitar, the blade of which was of a bright water, and rapid was the stroke it gave:</p>  
<p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></A></p>  
<p>58. A warrior, whose armour seemed to be braced on a lofty tree; a chief, who, like a king, wore sandals of leather stained with Egyptian thorn: a hero, without an equal.</p>  
<p>59. O lovely heifer! what a sweet prey was she to a hunter permitted to chase her! To me she was wholly denied: oh, would to heaven that she had not been forbidden me!</p>  
<p>60. I sent forth my handmaid, and said to her: "Go, ask tidings inquisitively of my beloved, and bring me intelligence."</p>  
<p>61. She said: "I have seen the hostile guards negligent of their watch, and the wild heifer may be smitten by any archer who desires to shoot her."</p>  
<p>62. Then she turned towards me with the neck of a young roe, well grown, of an exquisite breed among the gazals of the wood: a roe with a milk-white face.</p>  
<p>63. I have been informed of a man ungrateful for my kindness; but ingratitude turns the mind of a benefactor from any more beneficence.</p>  
<p>64. The instructions which my valiant uncle gave me I have diligently observed; at the time when the lips are drawn away from the bright teeth,</p>  
<p>65. In the struggle of the fight, into whose deepest gulfs the warriors plunge themselves without complaint or murmur.</p>  
<p>66. When my tribe has placed me as a shield between them and the hostile spears, I have not ignobly declined the danger, although the place where I fixed my foot was too narrow to admit a companion.</p>  
<p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></A></p>  
<p>67. When I heard the din of Morra raised in the field, and the sons of Rabeia in the thick dust;</p>  
<p>68.* And the shouts of Dhohol at the moment of assault, when they rush in troops to the conflict with all their sharp-biting lions;</p>  
<p>69. When even the mildest of the tribes saw the skirmish under their standards (and Death <i>spreads havoc</i> under the standard of the mildest nation),</p>  
<p>70. Then I knew with certainty, that, in so fierce a contest with them, many a heavy blow would make the perched birds of the brain fly quickly from every skull:</p>  
<p>71. As soon as I beheld the legions of our enemies advancing, and animating one another to battle, I too rushed forward, and acted without reproach.</p>  
<p>72. The troops called out "Antara!" while javelins, long as the cords of a well, were forcibly thrust against the chest of my dark steed.</p>  
<p>73. I ceased not to charge the foe with the neck and breast of my horse, until he was mantled in blood.</p>  
<p>74. My steed, bent aside with the stroke of the lances in his forehead, complained to me with gushing tears and tender sobbing:</p>  
<p>75. Had he known the art of discourse, he would have addressed me in a plaintive strain; and had he possessed the faculty of speech, he would have spoken to me distinctly.</p>  
<p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></A></p>  
<p>76. In the midst of the black dust, the horses were impetuously rushing with disfigured countenances; every robust stallion and every strong-limbed short-haired male.</p>  
<p>77. Then my soul was healed, and all my anguish was dispersed by the cry of the warriors, saying, "Well done, Antara: charge again!"</p>  
<p>78. My camels too are obedient to my will, as often as I desire to kindle the ardour of my heart, and press it on to some arduous enterprise.</p>  
<p>79. Yet I fear lest death should seize me before the adverse turn of war has overtaken the two sons of Demdem:</p>  
<p>80. Men who attacked my reputation, when I had given them no offence, and vowed, when I had never assailed them, to shed my blood;&#8212;</p>  
<p>81. Yes, they injured me: but I have left their father, like a victim, to be mangled by the lions of the wood, and by the eagles advanced in years.</p>
