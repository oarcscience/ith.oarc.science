<p>But at length Antar's love for Abla is the cause of so many dissensions in the tribe that King Zoheir requests him to depart. The noble hero, with his father and uncles, accordingly quits the land of Abs. After plundering the tribe of Fazarah, the warriors of Carad, led by Antar, invade the land of Shiban; and this was the hero's spirited war-song, before assailing Mooferrij, who had concealed Abla from him, and whom he took prisoner:</p>  
<p><big><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> morning of thrusts in the field of battle (where wine is not put round in glasses) is dearer to me than the varied amusements with the cup, and the ewer, and the flowers;&#8212;</p>  
<p>My wine is indeed that which gushes about the spear's point, when the war-steeds trample.</p>  
<p>I am the slave of whom it shall be reported that I encountered a thousand free-born heroes: my heart was created harder than steel; how, then, can I fear sword or spear?</big></p>  
<p><a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="green">p. 272</font></A></p>  
<p><big>I have met the chargers, and I cared not: I am raised above Arcturus, and the Lyre, or the Eagle: when the warrior beholds me, he avoids me, his courage fails, and he flies.</p>  
<p>Ye have indulged a thought, ye people of Shiban, but my horse and my perseverance have thwarted your imagination.</p>  
<p>Ask Rebia of me, when he came against me with the chiefs of Beder:</p>  
<p>I took their chiefs prisoners, and only quitted them when I had dispersed them over every desert.</p>  
<p>Here, now, again I come forth, and in you will I appease my heart, and allay my bosom:</p>  
<p>I will seize the property of Abla with my sword, and the Lord of the Balcony shall acknowledge my power.</big></p>
