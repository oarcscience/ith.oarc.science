<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">THE boatmen shout, "&#8217;Tis time to part,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;No longer we can stay; "<br> &#8217;Twas then Maimuna taught my heart<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How much a glance could say.</p>  
<p>With trembling steps to me she came;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell," she would have cried,<br> But ere her lips the word could frame,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In half-formed sounds it died.</p>  
<p>Then bending down, with looks of love,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Her arms she round me flung,<br> And as the gale hangs on the grove,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my breast she hung.</p>  
<p>My willing arms embraced the maid,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;My heart with raptures beat;<br> While she but wept the more and said,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"Would we had never met!"</div></p>
