<p>CHAPTER II., Verse 189.&#8212;But fight them that there be no sedition, and that the religion may be God's; but if they desist, then let there be no hostility save against the unjust.</p>  
<p>Chapter III., Verse 163.&#8212;Count not those who are killed in the way of God as dead, but living with their Lord; provided for, rejoicing in what God has brought them of His grace, and being glad for those who have not reached them yet&#8212;those left behind them; there is no fear for them, and they shall not be grieved, (165) glad at favour from God and grace, and that God wasteth not the hire of the believers.</p>  
<p>Chapter XLVIII., Verse 16.&#8212;"Ye shall be called out against a people endowed with vehement valour, and shall fight them or they shall become Muslims. And if ye obey, God will give you a good hire; but if ye turn your backs, as ye turned your backs before, He will torment you with grievous woe!"</p>
