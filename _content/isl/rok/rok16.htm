<p>CHAPTER II., Verse 179.&#8212;There is prescribed for you the fast as it was prescribed for those before you; haply ye may fear. (180) A certain number of days, but he amongst you who is ill or on a journey, then (let him fast) another number of days. And those who are fit to fast may redeem it by feeding a poor man; but he who follows an impulse to a good work it is better for him; and if ye fast it is better for you, if ye did but know.</p>  
<p>The month of Ramazan, wherein was revealed the Koran, for a guidance to men, and for manifestations of guidance, and for a discrimination. And he amongst you who beholds this month then let him fast it; but he who is sick or on a journey, then another number of days&#8212;God desires for you what is easy, and desires not for you what is difficult&#8212;that ye may complete the number and say, "Great is God," for that He has guided you; haply ye may give thanks.</p>
