<p>CHAPTER III., Verse 163.&#8212;Those who said of their brethren, whilst they themselves stayed at home, "Had they obeyed us they would not have been killed"; say, "Ward off from yourselves death, if ye do speak the truth."</p>  
<p>Chapter VII., Verse 33.&#8212;Every nation has its appointed time, and when their appointed time comes they cannot keep it back an hour, nor can they bring it on.</p>  
<p>Chapter X., Verse 11.&#8212;And if God should hasten on the bad to men as they would hasten on the good, their appointed time would surely be fulfilled. But we will let those who hope not for our meeting go on in their rebellion, blindly wandering on.</p>  
<p>Chapter XVI., Verse 63.&#8212;If God were to punish men for their wrongdoing, He would not leave upon the earth a single beast, but He respites them until a stated time; and when their time comes they cannot put it off an hour, nor can they bring it on.</p>  
<p>They set down to God what they abhor themselves; and their tongues describe the lie that "Good is to be theirs"; without a doubt theirs is the Fire, for, verily, they shall be sent on there!</p>

<p>Chapter XVII., Verse 14.&#8212;And every man's augury have we fastened on his neck.</p>  
<p>Chapter XXI., Verse 101.&#8212;Verily, those for whom the good (reward) from us was fore-ordained they from it shall be kept far away; they shall not hear the slightest sound thereof, and they in what their souls desire shall dwell for aye. The greatest terror shall not grieve them; and the angels shall meet them (saying), "This is your day which ye were promised!"</p>  
<p>Chapter LXII., Verse 8.&#8212;Say, "Verily, the death from which ye flee will surely meet you, then shall ye be sent back to Him who knows the unseen and the visible, and He will inform you of that which ye have done!"</p>
