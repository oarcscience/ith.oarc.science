### AS TO THE NATURE OF FIDELITY

O soul! be firm footed as regards fidelity,  
For money hath no currency without its stamp.  
If thou turnest not the rein from the path of fidelity,  
Thou wilt be a friend in the hearts of thine enemies.  
Turn not thy soul's face from the abode of fidelity,  
That thou be not ashamed before the face of thy friends.  
Place not thy foot outside the street of fidelity,  
Since tyranny is not fitting in the case of friends.  
It is wrong to separate thyself from beloved ones;  
It is contrary to fidelity to sever thyself from thy comrades. <span

Want of fidelity is the attribute of women.  
Do not learn the unseemly conduct of that sex.
