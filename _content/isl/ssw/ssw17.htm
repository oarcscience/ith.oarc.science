<p>Beware! thou that art snared in the net of avarice,<br> Lest thou be mad and intoxicated with the cup of greed.<br> Waste not thy life in the acquisition of wealth, <a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></A><br> Since an earthen pot is not of the same value as a pearl.<br> Whosoever hath fallen into the snare of greed<br> Giveth the harvest of his life to the winds.<br> I grant that all the wealth of Korah&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>
 is thine&#8212;<br> That all the riches of the habitable globe are with thee<br> But in the end thou wilt be enveloped in the earth,<br> Like the helpless, with distress of heart.<br> Why dost thou distress thyself with the anguish of gold?<br> Why dost thou bear the burden of distress, as if thou wert an ass?<br> Why dost thou undergo anguish on account of wealth,<br> For it will of a sudden be swept away. <a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></A><br> Hast thou thus given thine heart to the picture of money?<br> For with the taste thereof thou wilt become a penitent boon companion.<br> Thou art become such a lover of the face of gold,<br> That thine affairs are distressed and thy head upset.<br> Thou art become as it were a prey to its pursuit,<br> That thou thinkest not of the day of judgment.<br> Let not the heart of that base wretch rejoice,<br> Who on account of the world scattereth faith to the winds.</p>
