### IN CONDEMNATION OF PRIDE

Beware, O son! that thou dost not become proud,  
Lest fortune thereby slip from thine hands.  
Pride on the part of a wise man is not comely;  
Sad is such demeanour in the case of a prudent person.  
Pride is the habit of the ignorant,  
Pride doth not proceed from men of intelligence.  
Pride caused the fall of Azazil, <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7)  
And led to his being ensnared in the prison of the accursed.  
Whoever is by nature arrogant, <span id="page_37">p. 37</span>  
His head is filled with pride beyond imagination.  
Pride is the source of adversity,  
Pride is the nature of the evil-disposed.  
Since thou knowest about pride, why dost thou pursue it?  
If thou actest thus, thou doest wrong.
