<p>O soul! if thou makest choice of humility,<br> The people of the world will be thy friends.<br> Humility will augment thy station,<br> Just as the moon gets light from the sun.<br> Humility is the source of intimacy,<br> For exalted will be the dignity of friendship.<br> Humility exalteth a man,<br> Humility is a decoration to men of position.<br> Every one who is human is humble;<br> Nought becometh a man save magnanimity. <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></A><br> The man of wisdom maketh choice of humility;<br> The bough laden with fruit rests upon the earth.<br> Humility will increase thy reputation,<br> It will get thee a place in the glorious Paradise.<br> Humility is the key of the gate of Heaven;<br> It is an ornament to position and dignity.<br> Whoever is accustomed to humility<br> Will enjoy rank and power.<br> Whoever is born to command,<br> It is more than delightful to find in him humility.<br> Humility will make thee beloved in the world<br> Thou wilt become dear in men's hearts as their own soul.<br> Do not withhold humility from mankind,<br> For thus thou mayest withdraw thy neck (from perplexity) as it were a sword (from the scabbard). <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></A><br> Humility on the part of the exalted is commendable.<br> If a beggar be humble, it is his nature.</p>
