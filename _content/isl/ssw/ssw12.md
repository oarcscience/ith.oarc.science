### ON THE EXCELLENCE OF LEARNING

Sons of Adam from learning will find perfection—  
Not from dignity, and rank, and wealth, and property.  
Like a taper one must melt in pursuit of learning,  
Since without learning one cannot know God.  
A man of wisdom is a student of learning,  
For the market of wisdom is always brisk.  
Whoever is fortunate as regards Eternity,  
Maketh choice of the pursuit of knowledge. <span id="page_38">p.

This pursuit of knowledge is a duty on thy part,  
Even if it be necessary to traverse the earth.  
Go, seize fast hold of the skirt of knowledge,  
For learning will convey thee to everlasting abodes.  
Seek nought but knowledge if thou art wise,  
For it is neglectful to remain without wisdom.  
From learning there will come to thee perfection as regards religion and
the world,  
For thine affairs will be settled by knowledge.
