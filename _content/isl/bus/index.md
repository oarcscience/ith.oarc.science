This is a prose translation of the Bustan of Sadi, originally published
as part of the Wisdom of the East series in the early 20th century, and
long out of print. This little book is full of practical spiritual
wisdom. Sadi doesn't lean on allegory as much as other Sufi writers of
the period; most of the stories in this collection have a pretty obvious
moral lesson.

Born in Shiraz, Iran, in 1184, Sādi (pseudonym of Muslih-ud-Din Mushrif
ibn Abdullah) is considered one of the major medieval Persian poets. He
traveled widely, through regions of what is today Syria, Turkey, Egypt
and Iraq. Vignettes of gritty caravan and street scenes give life to his
tales. In old age he returned to Shiraz, and composed his two best-known
works, the poetic Bustan, or Orchard (in 1257), and the prose
[Gulistan](../gulistan.txt), the Rose Garden (in 1258). He died in 1283
or possibly 1291.
