### Sūra XXXVII.

### Ṣāffāt, or Those Ranged in Ranks.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. By those who range  
Themselves in ranks,

2\. And so are strong  
In repelling (evil),

3\. And thus proclaim  
The Message (of God)!

4\. Verily, verily, your God  
Is One!—

5\. Lord of the heavens  
And of the earth,

<span id="page_1191">p. 1191</span>

And all between them,  
And Lord of every point  
At the rising of the sun!

6\. We have indeed decked  
The lower heaven with beauty  
(In) the stars,—

7\. (For beauty) and for guard  
Against all obstinate  
Rebellious evil spirits,

8\. (So) they should not strain  
Their ears in the direction  
Of the Exalted Assembly

<span id="page_1192">p. 1192</span>

But be cast away  
From every side,

9\. Repulsed, for they are  
Under a perpetual penalty,

10\. Except such as snatch away  
Something by stealth, and they  
Are pursued by a flaming  
Fire, of piercing brightness.

11\. Just ask their opinion:  
Are they the more difficult  
To create, or the (other) beings  
We have created?  
Them have We created  
Out of a sticky clay!

12\. Truly dost thou marvel,  
While they ridicule,

13\. And, when they are  
Admonished, pay no heed,—

14\. And, when they see  
A Sign, turn it  
To mockery,

15\. And say, "This is nothing  
But evident sorcery!

16\. "What! when we die,  
And become dust and bones,

<span id="page_1193">p. 1193</span>

Shall we (then) be  
Raised up (again)?

17\. "And also our fathers  
Of old?"

18\. Say thou: "Yea, and ye shall  
Then be humiliated  
(On account of your evil).

19\. Then it will be a single  
(Compelling) cry;  
And behold, they will  
Begin to see!

20\. They will say, "Ah!  
Woe to us! this is  
The Day of Judgment!"

21\. (A voice will say,)  
"This is the Day  
Of Sorting Out, whose  
Truth ye (once) denied!"

##### SECTION 2.

22\. "Bring ye up",  
It shall be said,

<span id="page_1194">p. 1194</span>

"The wrong-doers  
And their wives,  
And the things they worshipped—

23\. "Besides God,  
And lead them to the Way  
To the (Fierce) Fire!

24\. "But stop them,  
For they must be asked:

25\. "What is the matter  
With you that ye  
Help not each other?"

26\. Nay, but that day they  
Shall submit (to judgment);

27\. And they will turn to  
One another, and question  
One [another](errata.htm#6).

28\. They will say: "It was ye  
Who used to come to us  
From the right hand  
(Of power and authority)!"

<span id="page_1195">p. 1195</span>

29\. They will reply: "Nay, ye  
Yourselves had no Faith!

30\. "Nor had we any authority  
Over you. Nay, it was  
Ye who were a people  
In obstinate rebellion!

31\. "So now has been proved true,  
Against us, the Word  
Of our Lord that we  
Shall indeed (have to) taste  
(The punishment of our sins).

32\. "We led you astray: for truly  
We were ourselves astray."

33\. Truly, that Day, they will  
(All) share in the Penalty.

34\. Verily that is how We  
Shall deal with Sinners.

35\. For they, when they were  
Told that there is  
No god except God, would  
Puff themselves up with Pride,

<span id="page_1196">p. 1196</span>

36\. And say: "What! Shall we  
Give up our gods.  
For the sake of  
A Poet possessed?"

37\. Nay! he has come  
With the (very) Truth,  
And he confirms (the Message  
Of) the apostles (before him).

38\. Ye shall indeed taste  
Of the Grievous Penalty;—

39\. But it will be no more  
Than the retribution  
Of (the Evil) that ye  
Have wrought;—

40\. But the sincere (and devoted)  
Servants of God,—

41\. For them is a Sustenance  
Determined,

42\. Fruits (Delights); and they  
(Shall enjoy) honour and dignity,

43\. In Gardens of Felicity,

<span id="page_1197">p. 1197</span>

44\. Facing each other  
On Thrones (of dignity):

45\. Round will be passed  
To them a Cup  
From a clear-flowing fountain,

46\. Crystal-white, of a taste  
Delicious to those  
Who drink (thereof),

47\. Free from headiness;  
Nor will they suffer  
Intoxication therefrom.

48\. And besides them will be  
Chaste women, restraining  
Their glances, with big eyes  
(Of wonder and beauty).

49\. As if they were  
(Delicate) eggs closely guarded.

50\. When they will turn to  
One another and question  
One another.

51\. One of them will start  
The talk and say:  
"I had an intimate  
Companion (on the earth),

<span id="page_1198">p. 1198</span>

52\. "Who used to say,  
"What! art thou amongst those  
Who bear witness to  
The truth (of the Message)?

53\. "When we die and become  
Dust and bones, shall we  
Indeed receive rewards  
And punishments?"

54\. (A voice) said: "Would ye  
Like to look down?"

55\. He looked down  
And saw him  
In the midst of the Fire.

56\. He said: "By God!  
Thou wast little short  
Of bringing me to perdition!

57\. "Had it not been for  
The Grace of my Lord,  
I should certainly have been  
Among those brought (there)!

58\. "Is it (the case) that  
We shall not die,

59\. "Except our first death,  
And that *we*  
Shall not be punished?"

60\. Verily this is  
The supreme achievement!

<span id="page_1199">p. 1199</span>

61\. For the like of this  
Let all strive,  
Who wish to strive.

62\. Is that the better entertainment  
Or the Tree of Zaqqūm?

63\. For We have truly  
Made it (as) a trial  
For the wrong-doers.

64\. For it is a tree  
That springs out  
Of the bottom of Hell-fire:

65\. The shoots of its fruit-stalks  
Are like the heads  
Of devils:

66\. Truly they will eat thereof  
And fill their bellies therewith.

67\. Then on top of that  
They will be given  
A mixture made of  
Boiling water.

68\. Then shall their return  
Be to the (Blazing) Fire.

<span id="page_1200">p. 1200</span>

69\. Truly they found their fathers  
On the wrong Path;

70\. So they (too) were rushed  
Down on their footsteps!

71\. And truly before them,  
Many of the ancients  
Went astray;—

72\. But We sent aforetime,  
Among them, (apostles)  
To admonish them;—

73\. Then see what was  
The End of those who  
Were admonished (but heeded not),—

74\. Except the sincere (and devoted)  
Servants of God.

<span id="page_1201">p. 1201</span>

##### SECTION 3.

75\. (In the days of old),  
Noah cried to Us,  
And We are the Best  
To hear prayer.

76\. And We delivered him  
And his people from  
The Great Calamity,

77\. And made his progeny  
To endure (on this earth);

78\. And We left (this blessing)  
For him among generations  
To come in later times:

79\. "Peace and salutation to Noah  
Among the nations!"

80\. Thus indeed do We reward  
Those who do right.

81\. For he was one  
Of Our believing Servants.

<span id="page_1202">p. 1202</span>

82\. Then the rest We overwhelmed  
In the Flood.

83\. Verily among those  
Who followed his Way  
Was Abraham.

84\. Behold, he approached his Lord  
With a sound heart.

85\. Behold, he said to his father  
And to his people, "What  
Is that which ye worship?

86\. "Is it a Falsehood—  
Gods other than God—  
That ye desire?

87\. "Then what is your idea  
About the Lord of the  
Worlds?"

88\. Then did he cast  
A glance at the Stars,

89\. And he said, "I am  
Indeed sick (at heart)!"

<span id="page_1203">p. 1203</span>

90\. So they turned away  
From him, and departed.

91\. When did he turn  
To their gods and said,  
"Will ye not eat  
(Of the offerings before you)?…

92\. "What is the matter  
With you that ye  
Speak not (intelligently)?"

93\. Then did he turn  
Upon them, striking (them)  
With the right hand.

94\. Then came (the worshippers)  
With hurried steps,  
And faced (him).

95\. He said: "Worship ye  
That which ye have  
(Yourselves) carved?

96\. "But God has created you  
And your handiwork!"

97\. They said, "Build him  
A furnace, and throw him  
Into the blazing fire!"

98\. (This failing), they then  
Sought a stratagem against him,

<span id="page_1204">p. 1204</span>

But We made them the ones  
Most humiliated!

99\. He said: "I will go  
To my Lord! He  
Will surely guide me!

100\. "O my Lord! grant me  
A righteous (son)!"

101\. So We gave him  
The good news  
Of a boy ready  
To suffer and forbear.

102\. Then, when (the son)  
Reached (the age of)  
(Serious) work with him,  
He said: "O my son  
I see in vision  
That I offer thee in sacrifice:  
Now see what is  
Thy view!" (The son) said:  
"O my father! Do  
As thou art commanded:

<span id="page_1205">p. 1205</span>

Thou will find me,  
If God so wills one  
Practising Patience and Constancy!"

103\. So when they had both  
Submitted their wills (to God),  
And he had laid him  
Prostrate on his forehead  
(For sacrifice),

104\. We called out to him,  
"O Abraham!

105\. "Thou hast already fulfilled  
The vision!"—thus indeed  
Do We reward  
Those who do right.

106\. For this was obviously  
A trial—

<span id="page_1206">p. 1206</span>

107\. And We ransomed him  
With a momentous sacrifice:

108\. And We left (this blessing)  
For him among generations  
(To come) in later times:

109\. "Peace and salutation  
To Abraham!"

110\. Thus indeed do We reward  
Those who do right

111\. For he was one  
Of Our believing Servants.

112\. And We gave him  
The good news  
Of Isaac—a prophet,—  
One of the Righteous.

113\. We blessed him and Isaac:  
But of their progeny  
Are (some) that do right,  
And (some) that obviously  
Do wrong, to their own souls.

##### SECTION 4.

114\. Again, (of old,)  
We bestowed Our favour

<span id="page_1207">p. 1207</span>

On Moses and Aaron,

115\. And We delivered them  
And their people from  
(Their) Great Calamity;

116\. And We helped them,  
So they overcame  
(their troubles);

117\. And We gave them  
The Book which helps  
To make things clear;

118\. And We guided them  
To the Straight Way.

119\. And We left (this blessing)  
For them among generations  
(To come) in later times:

120\. "Peace and salutation  
To Moses and Aaron!"

121\. Thus indeed do We reward  
Those who do right.

122\. For they were two  
Of Our believing Servants.

<span id="page_1208">p. 1208</span>

123\. So also was Elias  
Among those sent (by Us).

124\. Behold, he said  
To his people,  
"Will ye not fear (God)?

125\. "Will ye call upon Baal  
And forsake the Best  
Of Creators,—

126\. "God, your Lord and Cherisher  
And the Lord and Cherisher  
Of your fathers of old?"

127\. But they rejected him,  
And they will certainly  
Be called up (for punishment),—

128\. Except the sincere and devoted  
Servants of God (among them).

129\. And We left (this blessing)  
For him among generations  
(To come) in later times:

130\. "Peace and salutation  
To such as Elias!"

<span id="page_1209">p. 1209</span>

131\. Thus indeed do We reward  
Those who do right.

132\. For he was one  
Of Our believing Servants.

133\. So also was Lot  
Among those sent (by Us).

134\. Behold, We delivered him  
And his adherents, all

135\. Except an old woman  
Who was among those  
Who lagged behind:

136\. Then We destroyed  
The rest.

137\. Verily, ye pass  
By their (sites),  
By day—

138\. And by night:  
Will ye not understand?

<span id="page_1210">p. 1210</span>

##### SECTION 5.

139\. So also was Jonah  
Among those sent (by Us).

140\. When he ran away  
(Like a slave from captivity)  
To the ship (fully) laden,

141\. He (agreed to) cast lots,  
And he was condemned:

142\. Then the big Fish  
Did swallow him,  
And he had done  
Acts worthy of blame.

143\. Had it not been  
That he (repented and)  
Glorified God,

144\. He would certainly have  
Remained inside the Fish  
Till the Day of Resurrection.

<span id="page_1211">p. 1211</span>

145\. But We cast him forth  
On the naked shore  
In a state of sickness,

146\. And We caused to grow,  
Over him, a spreading plant  
Of the Gourd kind.

147\. And We sent him  
(On a mission)  
To a hundred thousand  
(Men) or more.

148\. And they believed;  
So We permitted them  
To enjoy (their life)  
For a while.

149\. Now ask them their opinion:  
Is it that thy Lord  
Has (only) daughters, and they  
Have sons?—

150\. Or that We created  
The angels female, and they  
Are witnesses (thereto)?

151\. Is it not that they  
Say, from their own invention,

<span id="page_1212">p. 1212</span>

152\. "God has begotten children"?  
But they are liars!

153\. Did He (then) choose  
Daughters rather than sons?

154\. What is the matter  
With you? How judge ye?

155\. Will ye not then  
Receive admonition?

156\. Or have ye  
An authority manifest?

157\. Then bring ye your Book  
(Of authority) if ye be  
Truthful!

158\. And they have invented  
A blood-relationship  
Between Him and the Jinns:  
But the Jinns know  
(Quite well) that they  
Have indeed to appear  
(Before His Judgment-seat)!

159\. Glory to God! (He is free)  
From the things they ascribe  
(To Him)!

160\. Not (so do) the Servants  
Of God, sincere and devoted.

<span id="page_1213">p. 1213</span>

161\. For, verily, neither ye  
Nor those ye worship—

162\. Can lead (any)  
Into temptation  
Concerning God,

163\. Except such as are  
(Themselves) going to  
The blazing Fire!

164\. (Those ranged in ranks say):  
"Not one of us but has  
A place appointed;

165\. "And we are verily  
Ranged in ranks (for service);

166\. "And we are verily those  
Who declare (God's) glory!"

167\. And there were those  
Who said,

168\. "If only we had had  
Before us a Message  
From those of old,

169\. "We should certainly have  
Been Servants of God,  
Sincere (and devoted)!"

<span id="page_1214">p. 1214</span>

170\. But (now that the Qur-ān  
Has come), they reject it:  
But soon will they know!

171\. Already has Our Word  
Been passed before (this)  
To Our Servants sent (by Us),

172\. That they would certainly  
Be assisted,

173\. And that Our forces,—  
They surely must conquer.

174\. So turn thou away  
From them for a little while,

175\. And watch them (how  
They fare), and they soon  
Shall see (how thou farest)!

176\. Do they wish (indeed)  
To hurry on our Punishment?

177\. But when it descends  
Into the open space  
Before them, evil will be  
The morning for those who  
Were warned (and heeded not)!

<span id="page_1215">p. 1215</span>

178\. So turn thou away  
From them for a little while,

179\. And watch (how they fare)  
And they soon shall see  
(How thou farest)!

180\. Glory to thy Lord,  
The Lord of Honour  
And Power! (He is free)  
From what they ascribe  
(To Him)!

181\. And Peace on the apostles!

182\. And Praise to God,  
The Lord and Cherisher  
Of the Worlds.
