### Sūra LXXX.

### *’Abasa*, or He Frowned.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. (The Prophet) frowned  
And turned away,

2\. Because there came to him  
The blind man (interrupting).

3\. But what could tell thee  
But that perchance he might  
Grow (in spiritual understanding)?—

4\. Or that he might receive  
Admonition, and the teaching  
Might profit him?

5\. As to one who regards  
Himself as self-sufficient,

6\. To him dost thou attend;

7\. Though it is no blame  
To thee if he grow not  
(In spiritual understanding).

<span id="page_1688">p. 1688</span>

8\. But as to him who came  
To thee striving earnestly,

9\. And with fear  
(In his heart),

10\. Of him wast thou unmindful.

11\. By no means  
(Should it be so)!  
For it is indeed  
A Message of instruction:

12\. Therefore let whoso will,  
Keep it in remembrance.

13\. (It is) in Books  
Held (greatly) in honour,

14\. Exalted (in dignity),  
Kept pure and holy,

15\. (Written) by the hands  
Of scribes—

16\. Honourable and  
Pious and Just.

17\. Woe to man!  
What hath made him  
Reject God:

<span id="page_1689">p. 1689</span>

18\. From what stuff  
Hath He created him?

19\. From a sperm-drop:  
He hath created him, and then  
Mouldeth him in due proportions;

20\. Then doth He make  
His path smooth for him;

21\. Then He causeth him to die,  
And putteth him in his Grave;

22\. Then, when it is  
His Will, He will  
Raise him up (again).

23\. By no means hath he  
Fulfilled what God  
Hath commanded him.

24\. Then let man look  
At his Food,  
(And how We provide it):

25\. For that We pour forth  
Water in abundance,

<span id="page_1690">p. 1690</span>

26\. And We split the earth  
In fragments,

27\. And produce therein Corn,

28\. And Grapes and nutritious Plants,

29\. And Olives and Dates,

30\. And enclosed Gardens,  
Dense with lofty trees,

31\. And Fruits and Fodder,—

32\. For use and convenience  
To you and your cattle.

33\. At length, when there  
Comes the Deafening Noise,—

34\. That Day shall a man  
Flee from his own brother,

35\. And from his mother  
And his father,

36\. And from his wife  
And his children.

<span id="page_1691">p. 1691</span>

37\. Each one of them,  
That Day, will have  
Enough concern (of his own)  
To make him indifferent  
To the others,

38\. Some Faces that Day  
Will be beaming,

39\. Laughing, rejoicing.

40\. And other faces that Day  
Will be dust-stained;

41\. Blackness will cover them:

42\. Such will be  
The Rejecters of God,  
The Doers of Iniquity.
