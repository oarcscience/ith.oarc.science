### Sūra XXV.

### Furqān, or The Criterion.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. Blessed is He Who  
Sent down the Criterion  
To His Servant, that  
May be an admonition  
To all creatures;—

2\. He to Whom belongs  
The dominion of the heavens  
And the earth: no son  
Has He begotten, nor has He  
A partner in His dominion:  
It is He Who created  
All things, and ordered them  
In due proportions.

3\. Yet have they taken,  
Besides Him, gods that can  
Create nothing but are themselves  
Created; that have no control  
Of hurt or good to themselves;  
Nor can they control Death  
Nor Life nor Resurrection.

<span id="page_927">p. 927</span>

4\. But the Misbelievers say:  
"Naught is this but a lie  
Which he has forged,  
And others have helped him  
At it." In truth it is they  
Who have put forward  
An iniquity and a falsehood.

5\. And they say: "Tales of  
The ancients, which he has caused  
To be written: and they  
Are dictated before him  
Morning and evening."

6\. Say: "The (Qur-ān) was sent down  
By Him Who knows  
The Mystery (that is) in the heavens  
And the earth: verily He  
Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

7\. find they say: "What sort  
Of an apostle is this,  
Who eats food, and walks  
Through the streets? Why  
Has not an angel  
Been sent down to him  
To give admonition with him?

<span id="page_928">p. 928</span>

8\. "Or (why) has not a treasure  
Been bestowed on him, or  
Why has he (not) a garden  
For enjoyment?" The wicked  
Say: "Ye follow none other  
Than a man bewitched."

9\. See what kinds of comparisons  
They make for thee!  
But they have gone astray,  
And never a way will they  
Be able to find!

##### SECTION 2.

10\. Blessed is He Who,  
If that were His Will,  
Could give thee better (things)  
Than those,—Gardens beneath which  
Rivers flow; and He could  
Give thee Palaces (secure  
To dwell in).

11\. Nay, they deny the Hour  
(Of the Judgment to come):  
But We have prepared  
A Blazing Fire for such  
As deny the Hour:

<span id="page_929">p. 929</span>

12\. When it sees them  
From a place far off,  
They will hear its fury  
And its raging sigh.

13\. And when they are cast,  
Bound together, into a  
Constricted place therein, they  
Will plead for destruction  
There and then!

14\. "This day plead not  
For a single destruction:  
Plead for destruction oft-repeated!"

15\. Say: "Is that best, or  
The eternal Garden, promised  
To the righteous? For them,  
That is a reward as well  
As a goal (of attainment).

16\. "For them there will be  
Therein all that they wish for:  
They will dwell (there) for aye:  
A promise to be prayed for  
From thy Lord."

17\. The Day He will gather  
Them together as well as  
Those whom they worship  
Besides God, He will ask;

<span id="page_930">p. 930</span>

"Was it ye who led  
These My servants astray,  
Or did they stray  
From the Path themselves?"

18\. They will say: "Glory to Thee!  
Not meet was it for us  
That we should take  
For protectors others besides Thee:  
But Thou didst bestow,  
On them and their fathers,  
Good things (in life), until  
They forgot the Message:  
For they were a people  
(Worthless and) lost."

19\. (God will say): "Now  
Have they proved you liars  
In what ye say: so  
Ye cannot avert (your penalty)  
Nor (get) help." And whoever  
Among you does wrong,  
Him shall We cause to taste  
Of a grievous Penalty.

20\. And the apostles whom We  
Sent before thee were all  
(Men) who ate food  
And walked through the streets:  
We have made some of you  
As a trial for others:  
Will ye have patience?  
For God is One Who  
Sees (all things).

<span id="page_931">p. 931</span>

##### SECTION 3.

21\. Such as fear not  
The meeting with Us  
(For Judgment) say:  
"Why are not the angels  
Sent down to us, or  
(Why) do we not see  
Our Lord?" Indeed they  
Have an arrogant conceit  
Of themselves, and mighty  
Is the insolence of their impiety!

22\. The Day they see the angels,—  
No joy will there be  
To the sinners that Day:  
The (angels) will say:  
"There is a barrier  
Forbidden (to you) altogether!

23: And We shall turn  
To whatever deeds they did  
(In this life), and We shall  
Make such deeds as floating dust  
Scattered about.

<span id="page_932">p. 932</span>

24\. The Companions of the Garden  
Will be well, that Day,  
In their abode, and have  
The fairest of places for repose:

25\. The Day the heaven shall be  
Rent asunder with clouds,  
And angels shall be sent down,  
Descending (in ranks),—

26\. That Day, the dominion  
As of right and truth,  
Shall be (wholly) for (God)  
Most Merciful: it will be  
A Day of dire difficulty  
For the Misbelievers.

27\. I the Day that the wrong-doer  
Will bite at his hands,  
He will say, "Oh! would that  
I had taken a (straight) path  
With the Apostle!

28\. "Ah! woe is me!  
Would that I had never  
Taken such a one  
For a friend!

29\. "He did lead me astray  
From the Message (of God)  
After it had come to me!  
Ah! the Evil One is  
But a traitor to man!

<span id="page_933">p. 933</span>

Then the Apostle will say:

30 "O my Lord! Truly  
My people took this Qur-ān  
For just foolish nonsense."

31\. Thus have We made  
For every prophet an enemy  
Among the sinners: but enough  
Is thy Lord to guide  
And to help.

32\. Whose who reject Faith  
Say: "Why is not the Qur-ān  
Revealed to him all at once?  
Thus (is it revealed), that We  
May strengthen thy heart  
Thereby, and We have  
Rehearsed it to thee in slow,  
Well-arranged stages, gradually.

33\. And no question do they  
Bring to thee but We  
Reveal to thee the truth  
And the best explanation (thereof),

<span id="page_934">p. 934</span>

34\. Whose who will be gathered  
To Hell (prone) on their faces,—  
They will be in an evil  
Plight, and, as to Path,  
Most astray.

##### SECTION 4.

35\. (Before this,) We sent Moses  
The Book, and appointed  
His brother Aaron with him  
As Minister;

36\. And We commanded: "Go ye  
Both, to the people who  
Have rejected our Signs:"  
And those (people) We destroyed  
With utter destruction.

37\. And the people of Noah,—  
When they rejected the apostles,  
We drowned them,  
And We made them  
As a Sign for mankind;  
And We have prepared  
For (all) wrong-doers  
A grievous Penalty;—

38\. As also ’Ad and <u>Th</u>amūd,  
And the Companions

<span id="page_935">p. 935</span>

Of the Rass, and many  
A generation between them.

39\. To each one We set forth  
Parables and examples;  
And each one We broke  
To utter annihilation  
(For their sins).

40\. And the (Unbelievers) must indeed  
Have passed by the town  
On which was rained  
A shower of evil: did they not  
Then see it (with their own  
Eyes)? But they fear not  
The Resurrection.

41\. When they see thee,  
They treat thee no otherwise  
Than in mockery: "Is this  
The one whom God has sent  
As an apostle?"

42\. "He indeed would well-nigh  
Have misled us from  
Our gods, had it not been  
That we were constant  
To them!"—Soon will they  
Know, when they see  
The Penalty, who it is  
That is most misled  
In Path!

43\. Seest thou such a one  
As taketh for his god  
His own passion (or impulse)?  
Couldst thou be a disposer  
Of affairs for him?

<span id="page_936">p. 936</span>

44\. Or thinkest thou that most  
Of them listen or understand?  
They are only like cattle;—  
Nay, they are worse astray  
In Path.

##### SECTION 5.

45\. Hast thou not turned  
Thy vision to thy Lord?—  
How He doth prolong  
The Shadow! If He willed,  
He could make it stationary!  
Then do We make  
The sun its guide;

<span id="page_937">p. 937</span>

46\. Then We draw it in  
Towards Ourselves,  
A contraction by easy stages.

47\. And He it is Who makes  
The Night as a Robe  
For you, and Sleep as Repose,  
And makes the Day  
(As it were) a Resurrection.

48\. And He it is Who sends  
The Winds as heralds  
Of glad tidings, going before  
His Mercy, and We send down

<span id="page_938">p. 938</span>

Pure water from the sky,—

49\. That with it We may give  
Life to a dead land,  
And slake the thirst  
Of things We have created,—  
Cattle and men in great numbers.

50\. And We have distributed  
The (water) amongst them, in order  
That they may celebrate  
(Our) praises, but most men  
Are averse (to aught) but  
(Rank) ingratitude.

51\. Had it been Our Will,  
We could have sent  
A warner to every centre  
Of population.

52\. Therefore listen not  
To the Unbelievers, but strive

<span id="page_939">p. 939</span>

Against them with the utmost  
Strenuousness, with the (Qur-ān).

53\. It is He Who has  
Let free the two bodies  
Of flowing water:  
One palatable and sweet,  
And the other salt  
And hitter; yet has He  
Made a barrier between them,  
A partition that is forbidden  
To be passed.

54\. It is He Who has  
Created man from water:  
Then has He established  
Relationships of lineage

<span id="page_940">p. 940</span>

And marriage: for thy Lord  
Has power (over all things).

55\. Yet do they worship,  
Besides God, things that can  
Neither profit them nor  
Harm them: and the Misbeliever  
Is a helper (of Evil),  
Against his own Lord!

56\. But thee We only sent  
To give glad tidings  
And admonition.

57\. Say: "No reward do I  
Ask of you for it but this:  
That each one who will  
May take a (straight) Path  
To his Lord."

58\. And put thy trust  
In Him Who lives  
And dies not; and celebrate  
His praise; and enough is He  
To be acquainted with  
The faults of His servants;—

59\. He Who created the heavens  
And the earth and all  
That is between, in six days,  
And is firmly established  
On the Throne (of authority):  
God Most Gracious:  
Ask thou, then, about Him  
Of any acquainted (with such things).

<span id="page_941">p. 941</span>

60\. When it is said to them,  
"Adore ye (God) Most Gracious!",  
They say, "And what is (God)  
Most Gracious? Shall we adore  
That which thou commandest us?"  
And it increases their flight  
(From the Truth).

##### SECTION 6

61\. Blessed is He Who made  
Constellations in the skies,  
And placed therein a Lamp  
And a Moon giving light;

62\. And it is He Who made  
The Night and the Day  
To follow each other:  
For such as have the will  
To celebrate His praises  
Or to show their gratitude.

63\. And the servants of (God)  
Most Gracious are those  
Who walk on the earth  
In humility, and when the ignorant  
Address them, they say,  
"Peace!";

<span id="page_942">p. 942</span>

64\. Those who spend the night  
In adoration of their Lord  
Prostrate and standing;

65\. Those who say, "Our Lord!  
Avert from us the Wrath  
Of Hell, for its Wrath  
Is indeed an affliction grievous,—

66\. "Evil indeed is it  
As an abode, and as  
A place to rest in";

67\. Those who, when they spend,  
Are not extravagant and not  
Niggardly, but hold a just (balance)  
Between those (extremes);

68\. Those who invoke not,  
With God, any other god,  
Nor slay such life as God  
Has made sacred, except  
For just cause, nor commit  
Fornication;—and any that does  
This (not only) meets punishment

<span id="page_943">p. 943</span>

69\. (But) the Penalty on the Day  
Of Judgment will be doubled  
To him, and he will dwell  
Therein in ignominy,—

70\. Unless he repents, believes,  
And works righteous deeds,  
For God will change  
The evil of such persons  
Into good, and God is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful,

71\. And whoever repents and does good  
Has truly turned to God  
With an (acceptable) conversion;—

72\. Those who witness no falsehood;  
And, if they pass by futility,  
They pass by it  
With honourable (avoidance);

73\. Those who, when they are  
Admonished with the Signs  
Of their Lord, droop not down  
At them as if they were  
Deaf or blind;

74\. And these who pray,  
"Our Lord! Grant unto us  
Wives and offspring who will be  
The comfort of our eyes,

<span id="page_944">p. 944</span>

And give us (the grace)  
To lead the righteous."

75\. Those are the ones who  
Will be rewarded with  
The highest place in heaven,  
Because of their patient constancy:  
Therein shall they be met  
With salutations and peace,

76\. Dwelling therein;—how beautiful  
An abode and place of rest!

77\. Say (to the Rejecters):  
"My Lord is not uneasy  
Because of you if ye call not on Him  
But ye have indeed rejected  
(Him), and soon will come  
The inevitable (punishment)!"
