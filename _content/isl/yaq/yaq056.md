### Sūra LVI.

### *Wāqi‘a,* or The Inevitable Event.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. When the Event Inevitable  
Cometh to pass,

2\. Then will no (soul)  
Entertain falsehood  
Concerning its coming.

3\. (Many) will it bring low;  
(Many) will it exalt;

4\. When the earth shall be  
Shaken to its depths,

5\. And the mountains shall  
Be crumbled to atoms,

6\. Becoming dust scattered abroad,

7\. And ye shall be sorted out  
Into three classes.

8\. Then (there will be)  
The Companions of  
The Right Hand;—  
What will be  
The Companions of  
The Right Hand?

<span id="page_1485">p. 1485</span>

9\. And the Companions of  
The Left Hand,—  
What will be  
The Companions of  
The Left Hand?

10\. And those Foremost  
(In Faith) will be  
Foremost (in the Hereafter).

11\. These will be  
Those Nearest to God:

12\. In Gardens of Bliss:

13\. A number of people  
From those of old,

14\. And a few from those  
Of later times.

15\. (They will be) on Thrones  
Encrusted (with gold  
And precious stones),

16\. Reclining on them,  
Facing each other.

<span id="page_1486">p. 1486</span>

17\. Round about them will (serve)  
Youths of perpetual (freshness),

18\. With goblets, (shining) beakers,  
And cups (filled) out of  
Clear-flowing fountains:

19\. No after-ache will they  
Receive therefrom, nor will they  
Suffer intoxication:

20\. And with fruits,  
Any that they may select;

21\. And the flesh of fowls,  
Any that they may desire.

22\. And (there will be) Companions  
With beautiful, big,  
And lustrous eyes,—

23\. Like unto Pearls  
Well-guarded.

24\. A Reward for the Deeds  
Of their past (Life).

25\. No frivolity will they  
Hear therein, nor any  
Taint of ill,—

<span id="page_1487">p. 1487</span>

26\. Only the saying,  
"Peace! Peace".

27\. The Companions of  
The Right Hand,—  
What will be  
The Companions of  
The Right Hand?

28\. (They will be) among  
Lote-trees without thorns,

29\. Among Ṭalḥ trees  
With flowers (or fruits)  
Piled one above another,—

30\. In shade long-extended,

31\. By water flowing constantly,

32\. And fruit in abundance.

33\. Whose season is not limited,  
Nor (supply) forbidden,

34\. And on Thrones (of Dignity),  
Raised high.

35\. We have created  
(their Companions)  
Of special creation.

<span id="page_1488">p. 1488</span>

36\. And made them  
Virgin-pure (and undefiled),—

37\. Beloved (by nature),  
Equal in age,—

38\. For the Companions  
Of the Right Hand.

##### SECTION 2.

39\. A (goodly) number  
From those of old,

40\. And a (goodly) number  
From those of later times.

41\. The Companions of  
The Left Hand,—  
What will be  
The Companions of  
The Left Hand?

42\. (They will be) in the midst  
Of a fierce Blast of Fire  
And in Boiling Water,

43\. And in the shades  
Of Black Smoke:

44\. Nothing (will there be)  
To refresh, nor to please:

45\. For that they were wont  
To be indulged, before that,

<span id="page_1489">p. 1489</span>

In wealth (and luxury),

46\. And persisted obstinately  
In wickedness supreme!

47\. And they used to say,  
"What! when we die  
And become dust and bones,  
Shall we then indeed  
Be raised up again?—

48\. "(We) and our fathers of old?"

49\. Say: "Yea, those of old  
And those of later times,

50\. "All will certainly be  
Gathered together for the meeting  
Appointed for a Day  
Well-known.

51\. "Then will ye truly,—  
O ye that go wrong,  
And treat (Truth) as Falsehood!—

52\. "Ye will surely taste  
Of the Tree of Zaqqūm.

53\. "Then will ye fill  
Your insides therewith,

54\. "And drink Boiling Water  
On top of it:

<span id="page_1490">p. 1490</span>

55\. "Indeed ye shall drink  
Like diseased camels  
Raging with thirst!"

56\. Such will be their entertainment  
On the Day of Requital!

57\. It is We Who have  
Created you: why will ye  
Not witness the Truth?

58\. Do ye then see?—  
The (human Seed) that  
Ye throw out,—

59\. Is it ye who create it,  
Or are We the Creators?

60\. We have decreed Death  
To be your common lot,  
And We are not  
To be frustrated

<span id="page_1491">p. 1491</span>

61\. From changing your Forms  
And creating you (again)  
In (Forms) that ye know not.

62\. And ye certainly know already  
The first form of creation:  
Why then do ye not  
Celebrate His praises?

63\. See ye the seed that  
Ye sow in the ground?

64\. Is it ye that cause it  
To grow, or are We  
The Cause?

65\. Were it Our Will,  
We could crumble it  
To dry powder, and ye would  
Be left in wonderment,

66\. (Saying), "We are indeed  
Left with debts (for nothing):

67\. "Indeed are we shut out  
(Of the fruits of our labour)",

68\. See ye the water  
Which ye drink?

69\. Do ye bring it Down  
(In rain) from the Cloud  
Or do We?

70\. Were it Our Will,  
We could make it

<span id="page_1492">p. 1492</span>

Salt (and unpalatable):  
Then why do ye not  
Give thanks?

71\. See ye the Fire  
Which ye kindle?

72\. Is it ye who grow  
The tree which feeds  
The fire, or do We  
Grow it?

73\. We have made it  
A memorial (of Our handiwork),  
And an article of comfort  
And convenience for  
The denizens of deserts.

74\. Then celebrate with praises,  
The name of thy Lord,  
The Supreme!

<span id="page_1493">p. 1493</span>

##### SECTION 3.

75\. Furthermore I call  
To witness the setting  
Of the Stars,—

76\. And that is indeed  
A mighty adjuration  
If ye but knew,—

77\. That this is indeed  
A Qur-ān most honourable,

78\. In a Book well-guarded,

79\. Which none shall touch  
But those who are clean:

80\. A Revelation from the Lord  
Of the Worlds.

81\. Is it such a Message  
That ye would hold  
In light esteem?

82\. And have ye made it  
Your livelihood that ye  
Should declare it false?

<span id="page_1494">p. 1494</span>

83\. Then why do ye not  
(Intervene) when (the soul  
Of the dying man)  
Reaches the throat,—

84\. And ye the while  
(Sit) looking on,—

85\. But We are nearer  
To him than ye,  
And yet see not,—

86\. Then why do ye not,—  
If you are exempt  
From (future) account,—

87\. Call back the soul,  
If ye are true  
(In your claim of Independence)?

88\. Thus, then, if he  
Be of those Nearest to God,

89\. (There is for him) Rest  
And Satisfaction, and  
A Garden of Delights.

<span id="page_1495">p. 1495</span>

90\. And if he be  
Of the Companions of  
The Right Hand,

91\. (For him is the salutation),  
"Peace be unto thee",  
From the Companions  
Of the Right Hand.

92\. And if he be  
Of those who treat  
(Truth) as Falsehood,  
Who go wrong,

93\. For him is Entertainment  
With Boiling Water,

94\. And burning in Hell-Fire.

95\. Verily, this is  
The Very Truth  
And Certainty.

96\. So celebrate with praises  
The name of thy Lord,  
The Supreme.
