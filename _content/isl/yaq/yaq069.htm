<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
<p>1. The Sure Reality!</p>  
<p>2. What is the Sure Reality?</p>  
<p>3. And what will make<br> Thee realise what<br> The Sure Reality is?</p>  
<p>4. The <u>Th</u>am&#363;d<br> And the &#8216;&#256;d people<br> (Branded) as false<br> The Stunning Calamity!</p>  
<p>5. But the <u>Th</u>am&#363;d,&#8212;<br> They were destroyed<br> By a terrible Storm<br> Of thunder and lightning!</p>  
<p>6. And the &#8216;&#256;d,&#8212;<br> They were destroyed<br> By a furious Wind,<br> Exceedingly violent;</p>  
<p><a name="page_1597"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1597</font></A></p>  
<p>7. He made it rage<br> Against them seven nights<br> And eight days in succession:<br> So that thou couldst see<br> The (whole) people lying<br> Prostrate in its (path),<br> As if they had been<br> Roots of hollow palm-trees<br> Tumbled down!</p>  
<p>8. Then seest thou any<br> Of them left surviving?</p>  
<p>9. And Pharaoh,<br> And those before him,<br> And the Cities Overthrown,<br> Committed habitual Sin,</p>  
<p>10. And disobeyed (each)<br> The apostle of their Lord;<br> So He punished them<br> With an abundant Penalty.</p>  
<p>11. We, when the water<br> (Of Noah's Flood) overflowed<br> Beyond its limits,<br> Carried you (mankind),<br> In the floating (Ark),</p>  
<p><a name="page_1598"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1598</font></A></p>  
<p>12. That We might<br> Make it a Message<br> Unto you, and that ears<br> (That should hear the tale<br> And) retain its memory<br> Should bear its (lessons)<br> In remembrance.</p>  
<p>13. Then, when one<br> Blast is sounded<br> On the Trumpet,</p>  
<p>14. And the earth is moved,<br> And its mountains,<br> And they are crushed to powder<br> At one stroke,&#8212;</p>  
<p>15. On that Day<br> Shall the (Great) Event<br> Come to pass,</p>  
<p>16. And the sky will be<br> Rent asunder, for it will<br> That Day be flimsy,</p>  
<p>17. And the angels will be<br> On its sides,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1599"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1599</font></A></p>  
<p>And eight will, that Day,<br> Bear the Throne<br> Of thy Lord above them.</p>  
<p>18. That Day shall ye be<br> Brought to Judgment:<br> Not an act of yours<br> That ye hide will be hidden.</p>  
<p>19. Then he that will be<br> Given his Record<br> In his right hand<br> Will say: "Ah here!<br> Read ye my Record!</p>  
<p>20. "I did really understand<br> That my Account would<br> (One Day) reach me!"</p>  
<p>21. And he will be<br> In a life of Bliss,</p>  
<p>22. In a Garden on high,</p>  
<p>23. The Fruits whereof<br> (Will hang in bunches)<br> Low and near.</p>  
<p>24. "Eat ye and drink ye,<br> With full satisfaction;</p>  
<p><a name="page_1600"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1600</font></A></p>  
<p>Because of the (good)<br> That ye sent before you,<br> In the days that are gone!"</p>  
<p>25. And he that will<br> Be given his Record<br> In his left hand,<br> Will say: "Ah! would<br> That my record had not<br> Been given to me!</p>  
<p>26. "And that I had never<br> Realised how<br> My account (stood)!</p>  
<p>27. "Ah! would that (Death)<br> Had made an end of me!</p>  
<p>28. "Of no profit to me<br> Has been my wealth!</p>  
<p>29. "My power has<br> Perished from me!"&#8230;</p>  
<p>30. (The stern command will say):<br> "Seize ye him,<br> And bind ye him,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1601"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1601</font></A></p>  
<p>31. "And burn ye him<br> In the Blazing Fire.</p>  
<p>32. "Further, make him march<br> In a chain, whereof<br> The length is seventy cubits!</p>  
<p>33. "This was he that<br> Would not believe<br> In God Most High,</p>  
<p>34. "And would not encourage<br> The feeding of the indigent!</p>  
<p>35. "So no friend hath he<br> Here this Day.</p>  
<p>36. "Nor hath he any food<br> Except the corruption<br> From the washing of wounds,</p>  
<p>37. "Which none do eat<br> But those in sin."</p>  
<p><a name="page_1602"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1602</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>38. So I do<br> Call to witness<br> What ye see</p>  
<p>39. And what ye see not,</p>  
<p>40. That this is<br> Verily the word<br> Of an honoured apostle;</p>  
<p>41. It is not the word<br> Of a poet:<br> Little it is<br> Ye believe!</p>  
<p>42. Nor is it the word<br> Of a soothsayer:<br> Little admonition it is<br> Ye receive.</p>  
<p>43. (This is) a Message<br> Sent down from the Lord<br> Of the Worlds.</p>  
<p>44. And if the apostle<br> Were to invent<br> Any sayings in Our name,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1603"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1603</font></A></p>  
<p>45. We should certainly seize him<br> By his right hand,</p>  
<p>46. And We should certainly<br> Then cut off the artery<br> Of his heart:</p>  
<p>47. Nor could any of you<br> Withhold him<br> (From Our wrath).</p>  
<p>48. But verily this<br> Is a Message for<br> The God-fearing.</p>  
<p>49. And We certainly know<br> That there are amongst you<br> Those that reject (it).</p>  
<p>50. But truly (Revelation)<br> Is a cause of sorrow<br> For the Unbelievers.</p>  
<p>51. But verily it is Truth<br> Of assured certainty.</p>  
<p>52. So glorify the name<br> Of thy Lord Most High.</p>
