### Sūra LXXXI.

### *Takwīr,* or the Folding Up.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*

1\. When the sun  
(With its spacious light)  
Is folded up;

2\. When the stars  
Fall, losing their lustre;

3\. When the mountains vanish  
(Like a mirage);

4\. When the she-camels,  
Ten months with young,  
Are left untended;

5\. When the wild beasts  
Are herded together

<span id="page_1694">p. 1694</span>

(In human habitations);

6\. When the oceans  
Boil over with a swell;

7\. When the souls  
Are sorted out,  
(Being joined, like with like);

8\. When the female (infant),  
Buried alive, is questioned—

9\. For what crime  
She was killed;

10\. When the Scrolls  
Are laid open;

<span id="page_1695">p. 1695</span>

11\. When the World on High  
Is unveiled;

12\. When the Blazing Fire  
Is kindled to fierce heat;

13\. And when the Garden  
Is brought near;—

14\. (Then) shall each soul know  
What it has put forward.

15\. So verily I call  
To witness the Planets—  
That recede,

<span id="page_1696">p. 1696</span>

16\. Go straight, or hide;

17\. And the Night  
As it dissipates;

18\. And the Dawn  
As it breathes away  
The darkness;—

19\. Verily this is the word  
Of a most honourable Messenger,

20\. Endued with Power,  
With rank before  
The Lord of the Throne,

21\. With authority there,  
(And) faithful to his trust.

22\. And (O people!)  
Your Companion is not  
One possessed;

<span id="page_1697">p. 1697</span>

23\. And without doubt he saw him  
In the clear horizon.

24\. Neither doth he withhold  
Grudgingly a knowledge  
Of the Unseen.

25\. Nor is it the word  
Of an evil spirit accursed!

26\. When whither go ye?

27\. Verily this is no less  
Than a Message  
To (all) the Worlds:

28\. (With profit) to whoever  
Among you wills  
To go straight:

29\. But ye shall not will  
Except as God wills,—  
The Cherisher of the Worlds.
