### Sūra LXII.

### *Jumu‘a*, or the Assembly (Friday) Prayer.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. Whatever is  
In the heavens and  
On earth, doth declare  
The Praises and Glory  
Of God,—the Sovereign,  
The Holy One, the Exalted  
In Might, the Wise.

2\. It is He Who has sent  
Amongst the Unlettered  
An apostle from among  
Themselves, to rehearse  
To them His Signs,  
To sanctify them, and  
To instruct them in Scripture  
And Wisdom,—although

<span id="page_1546">p. 1546</span>

They had been, before,  
In manifest error;—

3\. As well as (to confer  
All these benefits upon)  
Others of them, who  
Have not already joined them:  
And He is Exalted  
In Might, Wise.

4\. Such is the Bounty of God,  
Which He bestows  
On whom He will:  
And God is the Lord  
Of the highest bounty.

5\. The similitude of those  
Who were charged  
With the (obligations  
Of the) Mosaic Law,  
But who subsequently failed  
In those (obligations), is  
That of a donkey  
Which carries huge tomes  
(But understands them not).  
Evil is the similitude  
Of people who falsify  
The Signs of God:  
And God guides not  
People who do wrong.

6\. Say: "O ye that  
Stand on Judaism!

<span id="page_1547">p. 1547</span>

If ye think that ye  
Are friends to God,  
To the exclusion of  
(Other) men, then express  
Your desire for Death,  
If ye are truthful!"

7\. But never will they  
Express their desire  
(For Death), because of  
The (deeds) their hands  
Have sent on before them!  
And God knows well  
Those that do wrong!

8\. Say: "The Death from which  
Ye flee will truly  
Overtake you: then will  
Ye be sent back  
To the Knower of things  
Secret and open: and He  
Will tell you (the truth  
Of) the things that ye did!"

##### SECTION 2.

9\. O ye who believe!  
When the call is proclaimed  
To prayer on Friday  
(The Day of Assembly),

<span id="page_1548">p. 1548</span>

Hasten earnestly to the  
Remembrance  
Of God, and leave off  
Business (and traffic):  
That is best for you  
If ye but knew!

10\. And when the Prayer  
Is finished, then may ye  
Disperse through the land,  
And seek of the Bounty  
Of God: and celebrate  
The Praises of God  
Often (and without stint):  
That ye may prosper.

11\. But when they see  
Some bargain or some  
Amusement, they disperse  
Headlong to it, and leave  
Thee standing. Say:  
"The (blessing) from the Presence  
Of God is better than  
Any amusement or bargain!  
And God is the Best  
To provide (for all needs)."
