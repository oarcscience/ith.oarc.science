<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
<p>1. Y&#257; S&#299;n.</p>  
<p>2. By the Qur-&#257;n<br> Full of Wisdom,&#8212;</p>  
<p>3. Thou art indeed<br> One of the apostles,</p>  
<p>4. On a Straight Way.</p>  
<p>5. It is a Revelation<br> Sent down by (Him),<br> The Exalted in Might,<br> Most Merciful,</p>  
<p>6. In order that thou mayest<br> Admonish a people,<br> Whose fathers had received<br> No admonition, and who<br> Therefore remain heedless<br> (Of the Signs of God).</p>  
<p><a name="page_1170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1170</font></A></p>  
<p>7. The Word is proved true<br> Against the greater part of them:<br> For they do not believe.</p>  
<p>8. We have put yokes<br> Round their necks<br> Right up to their chins,<br> So that their heads are<br> Forced up (and they cannot see).</p>  
<p>9. And We have put<br> A bar in front of them<br> And a bar behind them,<br> And further, We have<br> Covered them up; so that<br> They cannot see.</p>  
<p>10. The same is it to them<br> Whether thou admonish them<br> Or thou do not admonish<br> Them: they will not believe.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1171"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1171</font></A></p>  
<p>11. Thou canst but admonish<br> Such a one as follows<br> The Message and fears<br> The (Lord) Most Gracious, unseen:<br> Give such a one, therefore,<br> Good tidings, of Forgiveness<br> And a reward most generous.</p>  
<p>12. Verily We shall give life<br> To the dead, and We record<br> That which they send before<br> And that which they leave<br> Behind, and of all things<br> Have We taken account</p>  
<p><a name="page_1172"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1172</font></A></p>  
<p>In a clear Book<br> (Of evidence).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>13. Set forth to them,<br> By way of a parable,<br> The (story of) the Companions<br> Of the City. Behold,<br> There came apostles to it.</p>  
<p>14. When We (first) sent<br> To them two apostles,<br> They rejected them:<br> But We strengthened them<br> With a third: they said,<br> "Truly, we have been sent<br> On a mission to you."</p>  
<p><a name="page_1173"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1173</font></A></p>  
<p>15. The (people) said: "Ye are<br> Only men like ourselves<br> And (God) Most Gracious<br> Sends no sort of revelation:<br> Ye do nothing but lie."</p>  
<p>16. They said: "Our Lord doth<br> Know that we have been sent<br> On a mission to you:</p>  
<p>17. "And our duty is only<br> To proclaim the clear Message.</p>  
<p>18. The (people) said: "For us,<br> We augur an evil omen</p>  
<p><a name="page_1174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1174</font></A></p>  
<p>From you: if ye desist not,<br> We will certainly stone you.<br> And a grievous punishment<br> Indeed will be inflicted<br> On you by us."</p>  
<p>19. They said: "Your evil omens<br> Are with yourselves:<br> (Deem ye this an evil omen).<br> If ye are admonished?<br> Nay, but ye are a people<br> Transgressing all bounds!</p>  
<p>20. Then there came running,<br> From the farthest part<br> Of the City, a man,<br> Saying, "O my People!<br> Obey the apostles:</p>  
<p>21. "Obey those who ask<br> No reward of you<br> (For themselves), and who have<br> Themselves received Guidance</p>  
<p><a name="page_1175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1175</font></A></p>  
<p>22, "It would not be reasonable<br> In me if I did not<br> Serve Him Who created me,<br> And to Whom ye shall<br> (All) be brought back.</p>  
<p>23. "Shall I take (other) gods<br> Besides Him? If (God)<br> Most Gracious should<br> Intend some adversity for me,<br> Of no use whatever<br> Will be their intercession<br> For me, nor can they<br> Deliver me.</p>  
<p>24."I would indeed,<br> If I were to do so,<br> Be in manifest Error.</p>  
<p>25. "For me, I have faith<br> In the Lord of you (all):<br> Listen, then, to me!"</p>  
<p>26. It was said: "Enter thou<br> The Garden." He said:<br> "Ah me! Would that<br> My People knew (what I know)!&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="page_1176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1176</font></A></p>  
<p>27. "For that my Lord<br> Has granted me Forgiveness<br> And has enrolled me<br> Among those held in honour!"</p>  
<p>28. And We sent not down<br> Against his People, after him,<br> Any hosts from heaven,<br> Nor was it needful<br> For Us so to do.</p>  
<p>29. It was no more than<br> A single mighty Blast,<br> And behold! they were (like ashes)<br> Quenched and silent.</p>  
<p>30. Ah! alas for (My) servants!<br> There comes not an apostle<br> To them but they mock him!</p>  
<p>31. See they not how many<br> Generations before them<br> We destroyed? Not to them<br> Will they return:</p>  
<p><a name="page_1177"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1177</font></A></p>  
<p>32. But each one of them<br> All&#8212;will be brought<br> Before Us (for judgment).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
<p>33. A Sign for them<br> Is the earth that is dead:<br> We do give it life,<br> And produce grain therefrom,<br> Of which ye do eat.</p>  
<p>34. And We produce therein<br> Orchards with date-palms<br> And vines, and We cause<br> Springs to gush forth therein:</p>  
<p>35. That they may enjoy<br> The fruits of this (artistry):<br> It was not their hands<br> That made this:<br> Will they not then give thanks?</p>  
<p><a name="page_1178"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1178</font></A></p>  
<p>36. Glory to God, Who created<br> In pairs all things that<br> The earth produces, as well as<br> Their own (human) kind<br> And (other) things of which<br> They have no knowledge.</p>  
<p>37. And a Sign for them<br> Is the Night: We withdraw<br> Therefrom the Day, and behold<br> They are plunged in darkness;</p>  
<p>38. And the Sun<br> Runs his course<br> For a period determined<br> For him: that is<br> The decree of (Him),<br> The Exalted in Might,<br> The All-Knowing.</p>  
<p>39. And the Moon,<br> We have measured for her<br> Mansions (to traverse)<br> Till she returns<br> Like the old (and withered)<br> Lower part of a date-stalk.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1179"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1179</font></A></p>  
<p>40. It is not permitted<br> To the Sun to catch up<br> The Moon, nor can<br> The Night outstrip the Day:<br> Each (just) swims along (its own) orbit<br> (According to Law).</p>  
<p>41. And a Sign for them<br> Is that We bore<br> Their race (through the Flood)<br> In the loaded Ark;</p>  
<p>42. And We have created<br> For them similar (vessels)<br> On which they ride.</p>  
<p>43. If it were Our Will,<br> We could drown them:<br> Then would there be<br> No helper (to hear<br> Their cry), nor could<br> They be delivered,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1180"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1180</font></A></p>  
<p>44. Except by way of Mercy<br> From Us, and by way<br> Of (worldly) convenience<br> (To serve them) for a time.</p>  
<p>45. When they are told,<br> "Fear ye that which is<br> Before you and that which<br> Will be after you, in order<br> That ye may receive Mercy,"<br> (They turn back).</p>  
<p>46. Not a Sign comes to them<br> From among the Signs<br> Of their Lord, but they<br> Turn away therefrom.</p>  
<p>47. And when they are told,<br> "Spend ye of (the bounties)<br> With which God<br> Has provided you," the Unbelievers<br> Say to those who believe:<br> "Shall we then feed those<br> Whom, if God had so willed,<br> He would have fed, (Himself)?&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="page_1181"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1181</font></A></p>  
<p>Ye are in nothing<br> But manifest error."</p>  
<p>48. Further, they say, "When<br> Will this promise (come to pass),<br> If what ye say is true?"</p>  
<p>49. They will not (have<br> To) wait for aught<br> But a single Blast:<br> It will seize them while<br> They are yet disputing<br> Among themselves!</p>  
<p>50. No (chance) will they then<br> Have, by will, to dispose<br> (Of their affairs), nor<br> To return to their own people!</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
<p>51. The trumpet shall be<br> Sounded, when behold!<br> From the sepulchres (men)<br> Will rush forth<br> To their Lord!</p>  
<p><a name="page_1182"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1182</font></A></p>  
<p>52. They will say: "Ah!<br> Woe unto us! Who<br> Hath raised us up<br> From our beds of repose?"<br> (A voice will say:)<br> "This is what (God)<br> Most Gracious had promised.<br> And true was the word<br> Of the apostles!"</p>  
<p>53. It will be no more<br> Than a single Blast,<br> When to! they will all<br> Be brought up before Us!</p>  
<p>54. Then, on that Day,<br> Not a soul will be<br> Wronged in the least,<br> And ye shall but<br> Be repaid the meeds<br> Of your past Deeds.</p>  
<p>55. Verily the Companions<br> Of the Garden shall<br> That Day have joy<br> In all that they do:</p>  
<p><a name="page_1183"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1183</font></A></p>  
<p>56. They and their associates<br> Will be in groves<br> Of (cool) shade, reclining<br> On Thrones (of dignity);</p>  
<p>57. (Every) fruit (enjoyment)<br> Will be there for them;<br> They shall have whatever<br> They call for;</p>  
<p>58. "Peace!"&#8212;a Word<br> (Of salutation) from a Lord<br> Most Merciful!</p>  
<p>59. "And O ye in sin!<br> Get ye apart this Day!</p>  
<p>60. "Did I not enjoin<br> On you, O ye children</p>  
<p><a name="page_1184"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1184</font></A></p>  
<p>Of Adam, that ye<br> Should not worship Satan;<br> For that he was to you<br> An enemy avowed?&#8212;</p>  
<p>61. "And that ye should<br> Worship Me, (for that) this<br> Was the Straight Way?</p>  
<p>62. "But he did lead astray<br> A great multitude of you.<br> Did ye not, then, understand?</p>  
<p>63. "This is the Hell<br> Of which ye were<br> (Repeatedly) warned!</p>  
<p>64. "Embrace ye the (Fire)<br> This Day, for that ye<br> (Persistently) rejected (Truth)."</p>  
<p>65. That Day shall We set<br> A seal on their mouths.<br> But their hands will speak<br> To Us, and their feet<br> Bear witness, to all<br> That they did.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1185"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1185</font></A></p>  
<p>66. If it had been Our Will,<br> We could surely have<br> Blotted out their eyes;<br> Then should they have<br> Run about groping for the Path,<br> But how could they have seen?</p>  
<p>67. And if it had been<br> Our Will, We could<br> Have transformed them<br> (To remain) in their places;<br> Then should they have been<br> Unable to move about,<br> Nor could they have returned<br> (After error).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
<p>68. If We grant long life<br> To any, We cause him<br> To be reversed in nature:<br> Will they not then understand?</p>  
<p>69. We have not instructed<br> The (Prophet) in Poetry,<br> Nor is it meet for him:<br> This is no less than</p>  
<p><a name="page_1186"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1186</font></A></p>  
<p>A Message and a Qur-&#257;n<br> Making things clear:</p>  
<p>70. That it may give admonition<br> To any (who are) alive,<br> And that the charge<br> May be proved against those<br> Who reject (Truth).</p>  
<p>71. See they not that it is<br> We Who have created<br> For them&#8212;among the things<br> Which our hands have fashioned&#8212;<br> Cattle, which are under<br> Their dominion?&#8212;</p>  
<p>72. And that We have<br> Subjected them to their (use)?<br> Of them some do carry them<br> And some they eat:</p>  
<p>73. And they have (other) profits<br> From them (besides), and they<br> Get (milk) to drink.<br> Will they not then<br> Be grateful?</p>  
<p>74. Yet they take (for worship)<br> Gods other than God,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1187"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1187</font></A></p>  
<p>(Hoping) that they might<br> Be helped!</p>  
<p>75. They have not the power<br> To help them: but they<br> Will be brought up<br> (Before Our Judgment-seat)<br> As a troop (to be condemned).</p>  
<p>76. Let not their speech, then,<br> Grieve thee. Verily We know<br> What they hide as well as<br> What they disclose.</p>  
<p>77. Doth not man see<br> That it is We Who<br> Created him from sperm?<br> Yet behold! he (stands forth)<br> As an open adversary!</p>  
<p>78. And he makes comparisons<br> For Us, and forgets his own<br> (Origin and) Creation:<br> He says, "Who can give<br> Life to (dry) bones<br> And decomposed ones (at that)?"</p>  
<p><a name="page_1188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1188</font></A></p>  
<p>79. Say, "He will give them<br> Life Who created them<br> For the first time!<br> For He is well-versed<br> In every kind of creation!</p>  
<p>80. "The same Who produces<br> For you fire out of<br> The green tree, when behold!<br> Ye kindle therewith<br> (Your own fires)!</p>  
<p>81. "Is not He Who created<br> The heavens and the earth<br> Able to create the like<br> Thereof?"&#8212;Yea, indeed!<br> For he is the Creator Supreme,<br> Of skill and knowledge (infinite)!</p>  
<p>82. Verily, when He intends<br> A thing, His Command is,<br> "Be", and it is!</p>  
<p>83. So glory to Him<br> In Whose hands is<br> The dominion of all things:<br> And to Him will<br> Be all brought back.</p>
