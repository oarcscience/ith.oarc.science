### Sūra LI.

### *Zāriyāt,* or the Winds That Scatter.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. By the (Winds)  
That scatter broadcast;

2\. And those that  
Lift and bear away  
Heavy weights;

3\. And those that  
Flow with ease  
And gentleness;

4\. And those that  
Distribute and apportion  
By Command;—

<span id="page_1421">p. 1421</span>

5\. Verily that which ye  
Are promised is true;

6\. And verily Judgment  
And Justice must  
Indeed come to pass.

7\. By the Sky  
With (its) numerous Paths,

8\. Truly ye are in  
A doctrine discordant,

9\. Through which are deluded (away  
From the Truth) such  
As would be deluded.

10\. Woe to the falsehood-mongers,—

11\. Those who (flounder) heedless  
In a flood of confusion:

12\. They ask, "When will be  
The Day of Judgment  
And Justice?"

<span id="page_1422">p. 1422</span>

13\. (It will be) a Day  
When they will be tried  
(And tested) over the Fire!

14\. "Taste ye your trial!  
This is what ye used  
To ask to be hastened!

15\. As to the Righteous,  
They will be in the midst  
Of Gardens and Springs,

16\. Taking joy in the things  
Which their Lord gives them,  
Because, before then, they  
Lived a good life.

17\. They were in the habit  
Of sleeping but little  
By night,

18\. And in the hours  
Of early dawn,

They (were found) praying  
For Forgiveness;

19\. And in their wealth  
And possessions (was remembered)  
The right of the (needy,)  
Him who asked, and him  
Who (for some reason) was  
Prevented (from asking).

<span id="page_1423">p. 1423</span>

20\. On the earth  
Are Signs for those  
Of assured Faith,

21\. As also in your, own  
Selves: will ye not  
Then see?

22\. And in heaven is  
Your Sustenance, as (also)  
That which ye are promised.

23\. Then, by the Lord  
Of heaven and earth,  
This is the very Truth,  
As much as the fact  
That ye can speak  
Intelligently to each other.

##### SECTION 2.

24\. Has the story  
Reached thee, of the honoured  
Guests of Abraham?

<span id="page_1424">p. 1424</span>

25\. Behold, they entered  
His presence, and said:  
"Peace!" He said, "Peace"  
(And thought, "These seem)  
Unusual people."

26\. Then he turned quickly  
To his household, brought  
Out a fatted calf,

27\. And placed it before them…  
He said, "Will ye not  
Eat?"

28\. (When they did not eat),  
He conceived a fear of them.  
They said, "Fear not,"  
And they gave him  
Glad tidings of a son  
Endowed with knowledge.

29\. But his wife came forward  
(Laughing) aloud: she smote  
Her forehead and said:  
"A barren old woman!"

30\. They said, "Even so  
Has thy Lord spoken:  
And He is full  
Of Wisdom and Knowledge."

<span id="page_1425">p. 1425</span>

31\. (Abraham) said: "And what,  
O ye Messengers,  
Is your errand (now)?"

32\. They said, "We have  
Been sent to a people  
(Deep) in sin;—

33\. "To bring on, on them,  
(A shower of) stones  
Of clay (brimstone),

34\. "Marked as from thy Lord  
For those who trespass  
Beyond bounds."

35\. Then We evacuated  
Those of the Believers  
Who were there,

36\. But We found not there  
Any just (Muslim) persons  
Except in one house:

37\. And We left there  
A Sign for such as  
Fear the Grievous Penalty.

<span id="page_1426">p. 1426</span>

38\. And in Moses  
(Was another Sign):  
Behold, We sent him  
To Pharaoh, with authority  
Manifest.

39\. But (Pharaoh) turned back  
With his Chiefs, and said,  
"A sorcerer, or  
One possessed!"

40\. So We took him  
And his forces, and  
Threw them into the sea;  
And his was the blame:

41\. And in the ‘Ād (people)  
(Was another Sign):  
Behold, We sent against them  
The devastating Wind:

42\. It left nothing whatever  
That it came up against,  
But reduced it to ruin  
And rottenness.

43\. And in the <u>Th</u>amūd  
(Was another Sign):  
Behold, they were told,  
"Enjoy (your brief day)  
For a little while!"

<span id="page_1427">p. 1427</span>

44\. But they insolently defied  
The Command of their Lord:  
So the stunning noise  
(Of an earthquake) seized  
Them, even while they  
Were looking on.

45\. Then they could not  
Even stand (on their feet),  
Nor could they help themselves.

46\. So were the People  
Of Noah before them:  
For they wickedly transgressed.

##### SECTION 3.

47\. With power and skill  
Did We construct  
The Firmament:  
For it is We Who create  
The vastness of Space.

<span id="page_1428">p. 1428</span>

48\. And We have spread out  
The (spacious) earth:  
How excellently  
We do spread out!

49\. And of every thing  
We have created pairs  
That ye may receive  
Instruction.

50\. Hasten ye then (at once)  
To God: I am from Him  
A Warner to you,  
Clear and open!

51\. And make not another  
An object of worship  
With God:  
I am from Him  
A Warner to you,  
Clear and open!

52\. Similarly, no apostle came  
To the Peoples before them,  
But they said (of him)  
In like manner,  
"A sorcerer, or  
One possessed"!

53\. Is this the legacy  
They have transmitted,

<span id="page_1429">p. 1429</span>

One to another  
Nay, they are themselves  
A people transgressing  
Beyond bounds!

54\. So turn away  
From them: not thine  
Is the blame.

55\. But teach (thy Message):  
For teaching benefits  
The Believers.

56\. I have only created  
Jinns and men, that  
They may serve Me.

57\. No Sustenance do I require  
Of them, nor do I  
Require that they should  
Feed Me.

58\. For God is He Who  
Gives (all) Sustenance,—  
Lord of Power,—  
Steadfast (for ever).

59\. For the wrong-doers,  
Their portion is like

<span id="page_1430">p. 1430</span>

Unto the portion of their  
Fellows (of earlier generations):  
Then let them not ask Me  
To hasten (that portion)!

60\. Woe, then, to the Unbelievers,  
On account of that Day  
Of theirs which they  
Have been promised!
