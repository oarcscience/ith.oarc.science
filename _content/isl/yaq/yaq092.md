### Sūra XCII.

### *Lail,* or The Night.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. By the Night as it  
Conceals (the light);

2\. By the Day as it  
Appears in glory;

3\. By (the mystery of)  
The creation of male  
And female;—

4\. Verily, (the ends) ye  
Strive for are diverse.

5\. Ṣo he who gives  
(In charity) and fears (God),

6\. And (in all sincerity)  
Testifies to the Best,—

<span id="page_1747">p. 1747</span>

7\. We will indeed  
Make smooth for him  
The path to Bliss,

8\. But he who is  
A greedy miser  
And thinks himself  
Self-sufficient,

9\. And gives the lie  
To the Best,—

10\. We will indeed  
Make smooth for him  
The Path to Misery;

11\. Nor will his wealth  
Profit him when he  
Falls headlong (into the Pit).

12\. Verily We take  
Upon Ourselves to guide,

13\. And verily unto Us  
(Belong) the End  
And the Beginning,

<span id="page_1748">p. 1748</span>

14\. Therefore do I warn you  
Of a Fire blazing fiercely;

15\. None shall reach it  
But those most unfortunate ones

16\. Who give the lie to Truth  
And turn their backs.

17\. But those most devoted  
To God shall be  
Removed far from it,—

18\. Those who spend their wealth  
For increase in self-purification,

19\. And have in their minds  
No favour from anyone  
For which a reward  
Is expected in return,

<span id="page_1749">p. 1749</span>

20\. But only the desire  
To seek for the Countenance  
Of their Lord Most High;

21\. And soon will they  
Attain (complete) satisfaction.
