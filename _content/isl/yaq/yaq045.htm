<p><a name="page_1355"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1355</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&#363;ra XLV.</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><i>Ja<u>th</u>iya</i>, or Bowing the Knee.</h3>  
<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
<p>1. <i>&#7716;&#257;-M&#299;m</i>.</p>  
<p>2. The revelation<br> Of the Book<br> Is from God<br> The Exalted in Power,<br> Full of Wisdom.</p>  
<p>3. Verily in the heavens<br> And the earth, are Signs<br> For those who believe.</p>  
<p>4. And in the creation<br> Of yourselves and the fact<br> That animals are scattered<br> (Through the earth), are Signs<br> For those of assured Faith.</p>  
<p>5. And in the alternation<br> Of Night and Day,<br> And the fact that God<br> Sends down Sustenance from<br> The sky, and revives therewith<br> The earth after its death,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1356"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1356</font></A></p>  
<p>And in the change<br> Of the winds,&#8212;are Signs<br> For those that are wise.</p>  
<p>6. Such are the Signs<br> Of God, which We rehearse to thee<br> In truth: then in what<br> Exposition will they believe<br> After (rejecting) God<br> And His Signs?</p>  
<p>7. Woe to each sinful<br> Dealer in Falsehoods:</p>  
<p>8. He hears the Signs<br> Of God rehearsed to him,<br> Yet is obstinate and lofty,<br> As if he had not<br> Heard them: then announce<br> To him a Penalty Grievous!</p>  
<p>9. And when he learns<br> Something of Our Signs,<br> He takes them in jest:<br> For such there will be<br> A humiliating Penalty.</p>  
<p>10. In front of them is<br> Hell: and of no profit<br> To them is anything<br> They may have earned,<br> Nor any protectors they<br> May have taken to themselves<br> Besides God: for them<br> Is a tremendous Penalty.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1357"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1357</font></A></p>  
<p>11. This is (true) Guidance:<br> And for those who reject<br> The Signs of their Lord,<br> Is a grievous Penalty<br> Of abomination.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>12. It is God Who has<br> Subjected the sea to you,<br> That ships may sail<br> Through it by His command,<br> That ye may seek<br> Of His Bounty, and that<br> Ye may be grateful.</p>  
<p>13. And He has subjected<br> To you, as from Him,<br> All that is in the heavens<br> And on earth: behold,<br> In that are Signs indeed<br> For those who reflect.</p>  
<p>14. Tell those who believe,<br> To forgive those who<br> Do not look forward<br> To the Days of God:</p>  
<p><a name="page_1358"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1358</font></A></p>  
<p>It is for Him to recompense<br> (For good or ill) each People<br> According to what<br> They have earned.</p>  
<p>15. If any one does<br> A righteous deed,<br> It enures to the benefit<br> Of his own soul;<br> If he does evil,<br> It works against<br> (His own soul).<br> In the end will ye<br> (All) be brought back<br> To your Lord.</p>  
<p>16. We did aforetime<br> Grant to the Children<br> Of Israel the Book,<br> The Power of Command,<br> And Prophethood; We gave<br> Them, for Sustenance, things<br> Good and pure; and We<br> Favoured them above the nations.</p>  
<p>17. And We granted them<br> Clear Signs in affairs</p>  
<p><a name="page_1359"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1359</font></A></p>  
<p>(Of Religion): it was only<br> After knowledge had been<br> Granted to them that they<br> Fell into schisms, through<br> Insolent envy among themselves<br> Verily thy Lord will judge<br> Between them on the Day<br> Of Judgment as to those<br> Matters in which they<br> Set up differences.</p>  
<p>18. Then we put thee<br> On the (right) Way<br> Of Religion: so follow<br> Thou that (Way),<br> And follow not the desires<br> Of those who know not.</p>  
<p>19. They will be of no<br> Use to thee in the sight<br> Of God: it is only<br> Wrong-doers (that stand as)<br> Protectors, one to another:<br> But God is the Protector<br> Of the Righteous.</p>  
<p>20. These are clear evidences<br> To men, and a Guidance<br> And Mercy to those<br> Of assured Faith.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1360"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1360</font></A></p>  
<p>21. What! do those who<br> Seek after evil ways<br> Think that We shall<br> Hold them equal with<br> Those who believe and<br> Do righteous deeds,&#8212;that<br> Equal will be their<br> Life and their death?<br> Ill is the judgment<br> That they make.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
<p>22. God created the heavens<br> And the earth for<br> Just ends, and in order<br> That each soul may find<br> The recompense of what<br> It has earned, and none<br> Of them be wronged.</p>  
<p>23. Then seest thou such<br> A one as takes<br> As his god his own<br> Vain desire? God has,<br> Knowing (him as such),<br> Left him astray, and sealed<br> His hearing and his heart<br> (And understanding), and put</p>  
<p><a name="page_1361"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1361</font></A></p>  
<p>A cover on his sight.<br> Who, then, will guide him<br> After God (has withdrawn<br> Guidance)? Will ye not<br> Then receive admonition?</p>  
<p>24. And they say: "What is<br> There but our life<br> In this world?<br> We shall die and we live,<br> And nothing but Time<br> Can destroy us." But<br> Of that they have no<br> Knowledge: they merely conjecture:</p>  
<p>25. And when Our Clear<br> Signs are rehearsed to them,<br> Their argument is nothing<br> But this: they say, "Bring<br> (Back) our forefathers, if<br> What ye say is true!"</p>  
<p>26. Say: "It is God Who<br> Gives you life, then<br> Gives you death; then<br> He will gather you together<br> For the Day of Judgment<br> About which there is<br> No doubt": but most<br> Men do not understand.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
<p>27. To God belongs<br> The dominion of the heavens<br> And the earth, and<br> The Day that the Hour</p>  
<p><a name="page_1362"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1362</font></A></p>  
<p>Of Judgment is established,&#8212;<br> That Day will the dealers<br> In Falsehood perish!</p>  
<p>28. And thou wilt see<br> Every sect bowing the knee:<br> Every sect will be called<br> To its Record: "This Day<br> Shall ye be recompensed<br> For all that ye did!</p>  
<p>29. "This Our Record speaks<br> About you with truth:<br> For We were wont<br> To put on record<br> All that ye did."</p>  
<p>30. Then, as to those who<br> Believed and did righteous<br> Deeds, their Lord will<br> Admit them to His Mercy:<br> That will be the Achievement's<br> For all to see.</p>  
<p>31. But as to those who<br> Rejected God, (to them<br> Will be said): "Were not<br> Our Signs rehearsed to you?<br> But ye were arrogant,<br> And were a people<br> Given to sin!</p>  
<p><a name="page_1363"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1363</font></A></p>  
<p>32. "And when it was said<br> That the promise of God<br> Was true, and that the Hour&#8212;<br> There was no doubt<br> About its (coming), ye<br> Used to say, "We<br> Know not what is<br> The Hour: we only think<br> It is an idea, and we<br> Have no firm assurance."</p>  
<p>33. Then will appear to them<br> The evil (fruits) of what<br> They did, and they will be<br> Completely encircled by that<br> Which they used to mock at!</p>  
<p>34. It will also be said:<br> "This Day We will forget<br> You as ye forgot<br> The meeting of this Day<br> Of yours! And your<br> Abode is the Fire, and<br> No helpers have ye!</p>  
<p>35. "This, because ye used<br> To take the Signs of God<br> In jest, and the life<br> Of the world deceived you:<br> (From) that Day, therefore,<br> They shall not be taken out<br> Thence, nor shall they be<br> Received into Grace.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1364"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1364</font></A></p>  
<p>36. Then Praise be to God,<br> Lord of the heavens<br> And Lord of the earth,&#8212;<br> Lord and Cherisher<br> Of all the worlds!</p>  
<p>37. To Him be Glory<br> Throughout the heavens<br> And the earth: and He<br> Is Exalted in Power,<br> Full of Wisdom!</p>
