### Sūra LXXXVII.

### *A’lā,* or The Most High.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious.  
Most Merciful*

1\. Glorify the name  
Of' thy Guardian-Lord  
Most High,

2\. Who hath created,  
And further, given  
Order and proportion;

3\. Who hath ordained laws.  
And granted guidance;

4\. And Who bringeth out  
The (green and luscious) pasture,

5\. And then doth make it  
(But) swarthy stubble.

6\. By degrees shall We  
Teach thee to declare

<span id="page_1724">p. 1724</span>

(The Message), so thou  
Shalt not forget,

7\. Except as God wills:  
For He knoweth  
What is manifest  
And what is hidden.

8\. And We will make it  
Easy for thee (to follow)  
The simple (Path).

9\. Therefore give admonition  
In case the admonition  
Profits (the hearer).

10\. The admonition will be received  
By those who fear (God):

11\. But it will be avoided  
By those most unfortunate ones,

12\. Who will enter  
The Great Fire,

13\. In which they will then  
Neither die nor live.

14\. But those will prosper  
Who purify themselves,

15\. And glorify the name  
Of their Guardian-Lord,  
And (lift their hearts)  
In Prayer.

16\. Nay (behold), ye prefer  
The life of this world;

17\. But the Hereafter  
Is better and more enduring.

18\. And this is  
In the Books  
Of the earliest (Revelations),—

19\. The Books of  
Abraham and Moses.
