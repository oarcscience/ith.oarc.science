### Sūra XXVII.

### *Naml*, or the Ants.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. *Tā*. *Sīn*.  
These are verses  
Of the Qur-ān,—a Book  
That makes (things) clear;

2\. A Guide; and Glad Tidings  
For the Relievers,—

3\. Those who establish regular prayers  
And give in regular charity,  
And also have (full) assurance  
Of the Hereafter.

4\. As to those who believe not  
In the Hereafter, We have  
Made their deeds pleasing  
In their eyes; and so they  
Wander about in distraction.

5\. Such are they for whom  
A grievous Penalty is (waiting):  
And in the Hereafter theirs  
Will be the greatest loss.

6\. As to thee, the Qur-ān  
Is bestowed upon thee  
From the presence of One  
Who is Wise and All-Knowing.

<span id="page_979">p. 979</span>

7\. Behold! Moses said  
To his family "I perceive  
A fire; soon will I bring you  
From there some information,  
Or I will bring you  
A burning brand to light  
Our fuel, that ye may  
Warm yourselves.

8\. But when he came  
To the (Fire), a voice  
Was heard: "Blessed are those  
In the Fire and those around:  
And Glory to God,  
The Lord of the Worlds.

9\. "O Moses! Verily,  
I am God, the Exalted  
In Might, the Wise!...

10\. "Now do thou throw thy rod!"  
But when he saw it  
Moving (of its own accord)  
As if it had been a snake,  
He turned back in retreat,  
And retraced not his steps:  
"O Moses!" (it was said),  
"Fear not: truly, in My presence,  
Those called as apostles  
Have no fear,—

<span id="page_980">p. 980</span>

11\. "But if any have done wrong  
And have thereafter substituted  
Good to take the place of evil,  
Truly, I am Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

12\. "Now put thy hand into  
Thy bosom, and it will  
Come forth white without stain  
(Or harm): (these are) among  
The nine Signs (thou wilt take)  
To Pharaoh and his people:  
For they are a people  
Rebellious in transgression."

13\. But when Our Signs came  
To them, that should have""  
Opened their eyes, they said:  
"This is sorcery manifest!"

14\. And they rejected those Signs  
In iniquity and arrogance,  
Though their souls were convinced  
Thereof: so see what was  
The end of those  
Who acted corruptly!

<span id="page_981">p. 981</span>

##### SECTION 2.

15\. We gave (in the past)  
Knowledge to David and Solomon  
And they both said:  
"Praise be to God, Who  
Has favoured us above many  
Of His servants who believe!

16\. And Solomon was David's heir.  
He said: "O ye people!  
We have been taught the speech"  
Of Birds, and on us  
Has been bestowed (a little)  
Of all things: this is  
Indeed Grace manifest (from God.)"

17\. And before Solomon were marshalled

<span id="page_982">p. 982</span>

His hosts,—of Jinns and men  
And birds, and they were all  
Kept in order and ranks.

18\. At length, when they came  
To a (lowly) valley of ants,  
One of the ants said:  
"O ye ants, get into  
Your habitations, lest Solomon  
And his hosts crush you  
(Under foot) without knowing it."

19\. So he smiled, amused  
At her speech; and he said:  
"O my Lord! so order me  
That I may be grateful  
For Thy favours, which Thou  
Hast bestowed on me and  
On my parents, and that  
I may work the righteousness  
That will please Thee:  
And admit me, by Thy Grace,  
To the ranks of Thy  
Righteous Servants."

<span id="page_983">p. 983</span>

20\. And he took a muster  
Of the Birds; and he said:  
"Why is it I see not  
The Hoopoe? Or is he  
Among the absentees?"

21\. "I will certainly punish him  
With a severe penalty,  
Or execute him, unless he  
Bring me a clear reason  
(For absence)."

22\. But the Hoopoe tarried not  
Far: he (came up and) said:  
"I have compassed (territory)  
Which thou hast not compassed,  
And I have come to thee  
From Saba with tidings true.

23\. "I found (there) a woman  
Ruling over them and provided  
With every requisite; and she  
Has a magnificent throne.

<span id="page_984">p. 984</span>

24\. "I found her and her people  
Worshipping the sun besides God:  
Satan has made their deeds  
Seem pleasing in their eyes,  
And has kept them away  
From the Path,—so  
They receive no guidance,—

25\. "(Kept them away from the Path),  
That they should not worship  
God, Who brings to light  
What is hidden in the heavens  
And the earth, and knows  
What ye hide and what  
Ye reveal.

26\. "God!—there is no god  
But He!—Lord of the Throne's  
Supreme!"

27\. (Solomon) said: "Soon shall we  
See whether thou hast told  
The truth or lied!

<span id="page_985">p. 985</span>

28\. "Go thou, with this letter  
Of mine, and deliver it  
To them: then draw back  
From them, and (wait to) see  
What answer they return"...

29\. (The Queen) said: "Ye chiefs!  
Here is—delivered to me—  
A letter worthy of respect.

30\. "It is from Solomon, and is  
(As follows), 'In the name  
Of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful:

31\. "'Be ye not arrogant  
Against me, but come  
To me in submission  
(To the true Religion).'"

##### SECTION 3.

32\. the said: "Ye chiefs!  
Advise me in (this)  
My affair: no affair  
Have I decided  
Except in your presence."

33\. They said: "We are endued  
With strength, and given  
To vehement war:  
But the command is  
With thee; so consider  
What thou wilt command."

34\. She said: "Kings, when they  
Enter a country, despoil it,

<span id="page_986">p. 986</span>

And make the noblest  
Of its people its meanest  
Thus do they behave.

35\. "But I am going to send  
Him a present, and (wait)  
To see with what (answer)  
Return (my) ambassadors."

36\. Now when (the embassy) came  
To Solomon, he said:  
"Will ye give me abundance  
In wealth? But that which  
God has given me is better  
Than that which He has  
Given you! Nay it is ye  
Who rejoice in your gift!

37\. "Go back to them, and be sure  
We shall come to them  
With such hosts as they  
Will never be able to meet:  
We shall expel them  
From there in disgrace,  
And they will feel  
Humbled (indeed)."

38\. He said (to his own men):  
"Ye Chiefs! which of you  
Can bring me her throne  
Before they come to me  
In submission?"

39\. Said an ‘Ifrit, of the Jinns:  
"I will bring it to thee

<span id="page_987">p. 987</span>

Before thou rise from thy  
Council: indeed I have  
Full strength for the purpose,  
And may he trusted."

40\. Said one who had knowledge  
Of the Book: "I will  
Bring it to thee within  
The twinkling of an eye!"  
Then when (Solomon) saw it  
Placed firmly before him,  
He said: "This is  
By the grace of my Lord!  
To test me whether I am  
Grateful or ungrateful!  
And if any is grateful,  
Truly his gratitude is (a gain)  
For his own soul; hut if  
Any is ungrateful, truly  
My Lord is Free of all Needs,  
Supreme in Honour!"

41\. He said: "Transform her throne  
Out of all recognition by her:  
Let us see whether she  
Is guided (to the truth)

<span id="page_988">p. 988</span>

Or is one of those who  
Receive no guidance."

42\. So when she arrived,  
She was asked, "Is this  
Thy throne?" She said,  
"It was just like this;  
And knowledge was bestowed  
On us in advance of this,  
And we have submitted  
To God (in Islam)."

43\. And he diverted her  
From the worship of others  
Besides God: for she was  
(Sprung) of a people  
That had no faith.

44\. She was asked to enter  
The lofty Palace: but  
When she saw it, she  
Thought it was a lake  
Of water, and she (tucked up  
Her skirts), uncovering her legs.  
He said: "This is  
But a palace paved

<span id="page_989">p. 989</span>

Smooth with slabs of glass."  
She said: "O my Lord!  
I have indeed wronged"  
My soul: I do (now)  
Submit (in Islam), with Solomon,  
To the Lord of the Worlds."

##### SECTION 4.

45\. We sent (aforetime),  
To the <u>Th</u>amūd, their brother  
Ṣaliḥ, saying, "Serve God":  
But behold, they became  
Two factions quarrelling  
With each other.

46\. He said: "O my people!  
Why ask ye to hasten on

<span id="page_990">p. 990</span>

The evil in preference to the good?  
If only ye ask God for forgiveness,  
Ye may hope to receive mercy.

47\. They said: "Ill omen  
Do we augur from thee  
And those that are with thee".  
He said: "Your ill omen  
Is with God; yea, ye are  
A people under trial."

48\. There were in the City  
Nine men of a family,  
Who made mischief in the land,  
And would not reform.

49\. They said: "Swear  
A mutual oath by God  
That we shall make  
A secret night attack  
On him and his people,  
And that we shall then  
Say to his heir (when he  
Seeks vengeance), 'We were not  
Present at the slaughter  
Of his people, and we are  
Positively telling the truth'."

<span id="page_991">p. 991</span>

50\. They plotted and planned,  
But We too planned,  
Even while they perceived it not.

51\. Then see what was the end  
Of their plot!—this,  
That We destroyed them  
And their people, all (of them).

52\. Now such were their houses,—  
In utter ruin,—because  
They practised wrong-doing.  
Verily in this is a Sign  
For people of knowledge.

53\. And We saved those  
Who believed and practised  
Righteousness.

54\. (We also sent) Lūt  
(As an apostle): behold,  
He said to his people,  
"Do ye do what is shameful  
Though ye see (its iniquity)?

55\. Would ye really approach men  
In your lusts rather than  
Women? Nay, ye are  
A people (grossly) ignorant!

56\. But his people gave  
No other answer but this:  
They said, "Drive out

<span id="page_992">p. 992</span>

The followers of Lūt from  
Your city: these are  
Indeed men who want  
To be clean and pure!"

57\. But We saved him  
And his family, except  
His wife: her We destined  
To be of those  
Who lagged behind.

58\. And We rained down on them  
A shower (of brimstone):  
And evil was the shower  
On those who were admonished  
(But heeded not)!

##### SECTION 5.

59\. Say: Praise be to God,  
And Peace on His servants  
Whom He has chosen  
(For His Message). (Who)  
Is better?—God or  
The false gods they associate  
(With Him)?

<span id="page_993">p. 993</span>

60\. Or, who has created  
The heavens and the earth,  
And who sends you down  
Rain from the sky?  
Yea, with it We cause  
To grow well-planted orchards  
Full of beauty and delight:  
It is not in your power  
To cause the growth  
Of the trees in them. (Can there be  
Another) god besides God?  
Nay, they are a people  
Who swerve from justice.

61\. Or, who has made the earth  
Firm to live in; made  
Rivers in its midst; set  
Thereon mountains immovable;  
And made a separating bar  
Between the two bodies  
Of flowing water?  
(Can there be another) god  
Besides God? Nay, most  
Of them know not.

62\. Or, who listens to the (soul)  
Distressed when it calls  
On Him, and who relieves  
Its suffering, and makes you

<span id="page_994">p. 994</span>

(Mankind) inheritors of the earth?'  
(Can there be another) god  
Besides God? Little it is  
That ye heed!

63\. Or, who guides you  
Through the depths of darkness  
On land and sea, and who  
Sends the winds as heralds  
Of glad tidings, going before  
His Mercy? (Can there be  
Another) god besides God?—  
High is God above what  
They associate with Him!

64\. Or, who originates Creation,  
Then repeats it,  
And who gives you sustenance  
From heaven and earth?  
(Can there be another) god  
Besides God? Say, "Bring forth  
Your argument, if ye  
Are telling the truth!"

65\. Say: None in the heavens  
Or on earth, except God,  
Knows what is hidden:  
Nor can they perceive  
When they shall be raised  
Up (for Judgment).

66\. Still less can their knowledge  
Comprehend the Hereafter: nay,

<span id="page_995">p. 995</span>

They are in doubt and uncertainty  
Thereanent; nay, they are blind  
Thereunto!

##### SECTION 6.

67\. The Unbelievers say: "What!  
When we become dust,  
We and our fathers,—shall we  
Really be raised (from the dead)?

68\. "It is true we were promised  
This,—we and our fathers  
Before (us): these are nothing  
But tales of the ancients."

69\. Say: "Go ye through the earth  
And see what has been  
The end of those guilty  
(Of sin)."

70\. But grieve not over them,  
Nor distress thyself  
Because of their plots.

71\. They also say: "When will  
This promise (come to pass)?  
(Say) if ye are truthful."

72\. Say: "It may be that  
Some of the events which  
Ye wish to hasten on  
May be (close) in your pursuit!"

<span id="page_996">p. 996</span>

73\. But verily thy Lord is  
Full of grace to mankind:  
Yet most of them are ungrateful.

74\. And verily thy Lord knoweth  
All that their hearts do hide,  
As well as all that  
They reveal.

75\. Nor is there aught  
Of the Unseen, in heaven  
Or earth, but is (recorded)  
In a clear record.

76\. Verily this Qur-ān doth explain  
To the Children of Israel  
Most of the matters  
In which they disagree.

77\. And it certainly is  
A Guide and a Mercy  
To those who believe.

78\. Verily thy Lord will decide  
Between them by His Decree:  
And He is Exalted in Might,  
All-Knowing.

79\. So put thy trust in God:  
For thou art on (the Path  
Of) manifest Truth.

<span id="page_997">p. 997</span>

80\. Truly thou canst not cause  
The Dead to listen, nor  
Canst thou cause the Deaf  
To hear the call,  
(Especially) when they  
Turn back in retreat.

81\. Nor canst thou be a guide  
To the Blind, (to prevent them)  
From straying: only those  
Wilt thou get to listen  
Who believe in Our Signs,  
And they will bow in Islam.

82\. And when the Word is  
Fulfilled against them (the unjust),  
We shall produce from the earth  
A Beast to (face) them:  
He will speak to them,  
For that mankind did not  
Believe with assurance  
In Our Signs.

##### SECTION 7.

83\. One Day We shall gather  
Together from every people  
A troop of those who reject  
Our Signs, and they shall  
Be kept in ranks,—

84\. Until, when they come  
(Before the Judgment-seat),  
(God) will say: "Did ye  
Reject My Signs, though ye

<span id="page_998">p. 998</span>

Comprehended them not  
In knowledge, or what  
Was it ye did?"

85\. And the Word will be  
Fulfilled against them, because  
Of their wrong-doing, and they  
Will be unable to speak  
(In plea).

86\. See they not that We  
Have made the Night  
For them to rest in  
And the Day to give  
Them light? Verily in this  
Are Signs for any people  
That believe!

87\. And the Day that the Trumpet  
Will be sounded—then will be  
Smitten with terror those  
Who are in the heavens,  
And those who are on earth,  
Except such as God will please  
(To exempt): and all shall come  
To His (Presence) as beings  
Conscious of their lowliness.

88\. Thou seest the mountains  
And thinkest them firmly fixed:  
But they shall pass away  
As the clouds pass away:

<span id="page_999">p. 999</span>

(Such is) the artistry of God,  
Who disposes of all things  
In perfect order: for He is  
Well acquainted with all that ye do.

89\. If any do good, good will  
(Accrue) to them therefrom;  
And they will be secure  
From terror that Day.

90\. And if any do evil,  
Their faces will be thrown  
Headlong into the Fire:  
"Do ye receive a reward  
Other than that which ye  
Have earned by your deeds?"

91\. For me, I have been  
Commanded to serve the Lord  
Of this City, Him Who has  
Sanctified it and to Whom  
(Belong) all things:  
And I am commanded  
To be of those who bow  
In Islam to God's Will,—

92\. And to rehearse the Qur-ān:  
And if any accept guidance,

<span id="page_1000">p. 1000</span>

They do it for the good  
Of their own souls,  
And if any stray, say:  
"I am only a Warner".

93\. And say: "Praise be to God,  
Who will soon show you  
His Signs, so that ye  
Shall know them"; and thy Lord  
Is not unmindful  
Of all that ye do.
