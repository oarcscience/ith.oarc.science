<p><a name="page_636"><font size="1" color="green">p. 636</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&#363;ra XV.</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><i>Al-Hijr</i>, or The Rocky Tract.</h3>  
<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious;<br> Most Merciful</i></p>  
<p>1. A. L. R. These are<br> The &#256;yats of Revelation,&#8212;<br> Of a Qur-&#257;n<br> That makes things clear.</p>  
<p><a name="page_637"><font size="1" color="green">p. 637</font></A></p>  
<p>2. Again and again will those<br> Who disbelieve, wish that they<br> Had bowed (to God's Will)<br> In Islam.</p>  
<p>3. Leave them alone, to enjoy<br> (The good things of this life)<br> And to please themselves:<br> Let (false) Hope amuse them: soon<br> Will knowledge (undeceive them).</p>  
<p>4. Never did We destroy<br> A population that had not<br> A term decreed and assigned<br> Beforehand.</p>  
<p>5. Neither can a people anticipate<br> Its Term, nor delay it.</p>  
<p>6. They say: "O thou to whom<br> The Message is being revealed!<br> Truly thou art mad (or possessed)!</p>  
<p><a name="page_638"><font size="1" color="green">p. 638</font></A></p>  
<p>7. "Why bringest thou not<br> Angels to us if it be<br> That thou hast the Truth?"</p>  
<p>8. We send not the angels<br> Down except for just cause:<br> If they came (to the ungodly),<br> Behold! no respite would they have!</p>  
<p>9. We have, without doubt,<br> Sent down the Message;<br> And We will assuredly<br> Guard it (from corruption).</p>  
<p>10. We did send apostles before thee<br> Amongst the religious sects<br> Of old:</p>  
<p>11. But never came an apostle<br> To them but they mocked him.</p>  
<p>12. Even so do we let it creep<br> Into the hearts of the sinners&#8212;</p>  
<p>13. That they should not believe<br> In the (Message); but the ways</p>  
<p><a name="page_639"><font size="1" color="green">p. 639</font></A></p>  
<p>Of the ancients have passed away.</p>  
<p>14. Even if We opened out to them<br> A gate from heaven,<br> And they were to continue<br> (All day) ascending therein,</p>  
<p>15. They would only say:<br> "Our eyes have been intoxicated:<br> Nay, we have been bewitched<br> By sorcery."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>16. It is We Who have set out<br> The Zodiacal Signs in the heavens,<br> And made them fair-seeming<br> To (all) beholders;</p>  
<p>17. And (moreover) We have guarded them</p>  
<p><a name="page_640"><font size="1" color="green">p. 640</font></A></p>  
<p>From every evil spirit accursed:</p>  
<p>18. But any that gains a hearing<br> By stealth, is pursued<br> By a flaming fire, bright (to see).</p>  
<p>19. And the earth We have spread out<br> (Like a carpet); set thereon<br> Mountains firm and immovable;<br> And produced therein all kinds<br> Of things in due balance.</p>  
<p>20. And We have provided therein<br> Means of subsistence,&#8212;for you<br> And for those for whose sustenance<br> Ye are not responsible.</p>  
<p>21. And there is not a thing<br> But its (sources and) treasures</p>  
<p><a name="page_641"><font size="1" color="green">p. 641</font></A></p>  
<p>(Inexhaustible) are with Us;<br> But We only send down<br> Thereof in due and ascertainable measures.</p>  
<p>22. And We send the fecundating winds,<br> Then cause the rain to descend<br> From the sky, therewith providing<br> You with water (in abundance),<br> Though ye are not the guardians<br> Of its stores.</p>  
<p>23. And verily, it is We<br> Who give life, and Who give<br> Death: it is We Who remain Inheritors<br> (After all else passes away).</p>  
<p><a name="page_642"><font size="1" color="green">p. 642</font></A></p>  
<p>24. To Us are known those of you<br> Who hasten forward, and those<br> Who lag behind.</p>  
<p>25. Assuredly it is thy Lord<br> Who will gather them together:<br> For He is Perfect in Wisdom<br> And Knowledge.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
<p>26. We created man from sounding clay,<br> From mud moulded into shape;</p>  
<p>27. And the Jinn race, We had<br> Created before, from the fire<br> Of a scorching wind.</p>  
<p>28. Behold! thy Lord said<br> To the angels: "I am about<br> To create man, from sounding clay<br> From mud moulded into shape;</p>  
<p><a name="page_643"><font size="1" color="green">p. 643</font></A></p>  
<p>29. "When I have fashioned him<br> (In due proportion) and breathed<br> Into him of My spirit,<br> Fall ye down in obeisance<br> Unto him.</p>  
<p>30. So the angels prostrated themselves,<br> All of them together:</p>  
<p>31. Not so Ibl&#299;s: he refused to be<br> Among those who prostrated themselves.</p>  
<p>32. (God) said: "O Ibl&#299;s!<br> What is your reason<br> For not being among those<br> Who prostrated themselves?"</p>  
<p>33. (Ibl&#299;s) said: "I am not one<br> To prostrate myself to man,<br> Whom Thou didst create<br> From sounding clay, from mud<br> Moulded into shape."</p>  
<p>34. (God) said: "Then get thee out<br> From here; for thou art<br> Rejected, accursed.</p>  
<p>35. "And the Curse shall be<br> On thee till the Day of Judgment."</p>  
<p><a name="page_644"><font size="1" color="green">p. 644</font></A></p>  
<p>36. (Ibl&#299;s) said: "O my Lord!<br> Give me then respite<br> Till the Day<br> The (dead) are raised."</p>  
<p>37. (God) said: "Respite<br> Is granted thee&#8212;</p>  
<p>38. "Till the Day<br> Of the Time Appointed."</p>  
<p>39. (Ibl&#299;s) said: "O my Lord!<br> Because Thou hast put me<br> In the wrong, I will<br> Make (wrong) fair-seeming<br> To them on the earth,<br> And I will put them<br> All in the wrong,&#8212;</p>  
<p>40. "Except Thy servants among them,<br> Sincere and purified<br> (By Thy grace)."</p>  
<p>41. (God) said: "This (Way<br> Of My sincere servants) is<br> Indeed a Way that leads<br> Straight to Me.</p>  
<p><a name="page_645"><font size="1" color="green">p. 645</font></A></p>  
<p>42. "For over My servants<br> No authority shalt thou<br> Have, except such as<br> Put themselves in the wrong<br> And follow thee."</p>  
<p>43. And verily, Hell<br> Is the promised abode<br> For them all!</p>  
<p>44. To it are seven Gates:<br> For each of those Gates<br> Is a (special) class<br> (Of sinners) assigned.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
<p>45. The righteous (will be)<br> Amid Gardens<br> And fountains<br> (Of clear-flowing water).</p>  
<p>46. (Their greeting will be):<br> "Enter ye here<br> In Peace and Security."</p>  
<p>47. And We shall remove<br> From their hearts any<br> Lurking sense of injury:<br> (They will be) brothers<br> (Joyfully) facing each other<br> On thrones (of dignity).</p>  
<p>48. There no sense of fatigue<br> Shall touch them,<br> Nor shall they (ever)<br> Be asked to leave.</p>  
<p><a name="page_646"><font size="1" color="green">p. 646</font></A></p>  
<p>49. Tell My servants<br> That I am indeed<br> The Oft-Forgiving,<br> Most Merciful;</p>  
<p>50. And that My Penalty<br> Will be indeed<br> The most grievous Penalty.</p>  
<p>51. Tell them about<br> The guests of Abraham.</p>  
<p>52. When they entered his presence<br> And said, "Peace!"<br> He said, "We feel<br> Afraid of you!"</p>  
<p>53. They said: "Fear not!<br> We give thee glad tidings</p>  
<p><a name="page_647"><font size="1" color="green">p. 647</font></A></p>  
<p>Of a son endowed<br> With wisdom."</p>  
<p>54. He said: "Do ye give me<br> Glad tidings that old age<br> Has seized me? Of what,<br> Then, is your good news?"</p>  
<p>55. They said: "We give thee<br> Glad tidings in truth:<br> Be not then in despair!"</p>  
<p>56. He said: "And who<br> Despairs of the mercy<br> Of his Lord, but such<br> As go astray?"</p>  
<p>57. Abraham said: "What then<br> Is the business on which<br> Ye (have come), O ye<br> Messengers (of God)?"</p>  
<p>58. They said: "We have been<br> Sent to a people<br> (Deep) in sin,</p>  
<p>59. "Excepting the adherents<br> Of L&#363;t: them we are certainly</p>  
<p><a name="page_648"><font size="1" color="green">p. 648</font></A></p>  
<p>(Charged) to save (from harm),&#8212;<br> All&#8212;</p>  
<p>60. "Except his wife, who,<br> We have ascertained,<br> Will be among those<br> Who will lag behind."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
<p>61. At length when the messengers<br> Arrived among the adherents<br> Of L&#363;t,</p>  
<p>62. He said: "Ye appear<br> To be uncommon folk."</p>  
<p>63. They said: "Yea,<br> We have come to thee<br> To accomplish that<br> Of which they doubt.</p>  
<p>64. "We have brought to thee<br> That which is inevitably<br> Due, and assuredly<br> We tell the truth.</p>  
<p>65. "Then travel by night<br> With thy household,<br> When a portion of the night<br> (Yet remains), and do thou</p>  
<p><a name="page_649"><font size="1" color="green">p. 649</font></A></p>  
<p>Bring up the rear:<br> Let no one amongst you<br> Look back, but pass on<br> Whither ye are ordered."</p>  
<p>66. And We made known<br> This decree to him,<br> That the last remnants<br> Of those (sinners) should be<br> Cut off by the morning.</p>  
<p>67. The inhabitants of the City<br> Came in (mad) joy<br> (At news of the young men).</p>  
<p>68. L&#363;t said: "These are<br> My guests: disgrace me not:</p>  
<p>69. "But fear God,<br> And shame me not."</p>  
<p>70. They said: "Did we not<br> Forbid thee (to speak)<br> For all and sundry?"</p>  
<p>71. He said: "There are<br> My daughters (to marry),<br> If ye must act (so)."</p>  
<p>72. Verily, by thy life (O Prophet),<br> In their wild intoxication,</p>  
<p><a name="page_650"><font size="1" color="green">p. 650</font></A></p>  
<p>They wander in distraction,<br> To and fro.</p>  
<p>73. But the (mighty) Blast<br> Overtook them before morning;</p>  
<p>74. And We turned (the Cities)<br> Upside down, and rained down<br> On them brimstones<br> Hard as baked clay.</p>  
<p>75. Behold! in this are Signs<br> For those who by tokens<br> Do understand.</p>  
<p>76. And the (Cities were)<br> Right on the high-road.</p>  
<p>77. Behold! in this<br> Is a Sign<br> For those who believe!</p>  
<p>78. And the Companions of the Wood<br> Were also wrong-doers;</p>  
<p><a name="page_651"><font size="1" color="green">p. 651</font></A></p>  
<p>79. So We exacted retribution<br> From them. They were both<br> On an open highway,<br> Plain to see.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
<p>80. The Companions of the Rocky Tract<br> Also rejected the apostles:</p>  
<p>81. We sent them Our Signs,<br> But they persisted<br> In turning away from them.</p>  
<p>82. Out of the mountains<br> Did they hew (their) edifices,<br> (Feeling themselves) secure.</p>  
<p>83. But the (mighty) Blast<br> Seized them of a morning,</p>  
<p>84. And of no avail to them<br> Was all that they did<br> (With such art and care)!</p>  
<p>85. We created not the heavens,<br> The earth, and all between them,</p>  
<p><a name="page_652"><font size="1" color="green">p. 652</font></A></p>  
<p>But for just ends.<br> And the Hour is surely<br> Coming (when this will be manifest).<br> So overlook (any human faults)<br> With gracious forgiveness.</p>  
<p>86. For verily it is thy Lord<br> Who is the Master-Creator,<br> Knowing all things.</p>  
<p>87. And We have bestowed<br> Upon thee the Seven<br> Oft-repeated (Verses)<br> And the Grand Qur-&#257;n.</p>  
<p>88. Strain not thine eyes.<br> (Wistfully) at what We<br> Have bestowed on certain classes<br> Of them, nor grieve over them:</p>  
<p><a name="page_653"><font size="1" color="green">p. 653</font></A></p>  
<p>But lower thy wing<br> (in gentleness)<br> To the Believers.</p>  
<p>89. And say: "I am indeed he<br> That warneth openly<br> And without ambiguity,"&#8212;</p>  
<p>90. (Of just such wrath)<br> As We sent down<br> On those who divided<br> (Scripture into arbitrary parts),&#8212;</p>  
<p>91. (So also on such)<br> As have made Qur-&#257;n<br> Into shreds (as they please).</p>  
<p>92. Therefore, by the Lord,<br> We will, of a surety,<br> Call them to account,</p>  
<p>93. For all their deeds.</p>  
<p>94. Therefore expound openly<br> What thou art commanded,<br> And turn away from those<br> Who join false gods with God.</p>  
<p>95. For sufficient are We<br> Unto thee against those</p>  
<p><a name="page_654"><font size="1" color="green">p. 654</font></A></p>  
<p>Who scoff,&#8212;</p>  
<p>96. Those who adopt, with God,<br> Another god: but soon<br> Will they come to know.</p>  
<p>97. We do indeed know<br> How thy heart is distressed<br> At what they say.</p>  
<p>98. But celebrate the praises<br> Of thy Lord, and be of those<br> Who prostrate themselves<br> In adoration.</p>  
<p>99. And serve thy Lord<br> Until there come unto thee<br> The Hour that is Certain.</p>
