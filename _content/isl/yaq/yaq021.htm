<p><a name="page_822"><font size="1" color="green">p. 822</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&#363;ra XXI.</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><i>Anbiy&#257;a,</i> or The Prophets</h3>  
<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
<p>1. Closer and closer to mankind<br> Comes their Reckoning: yet they<br> Heed not and they turn away.</p>  
<p>2. Never comes (aught) to them<br> Of a renewed Message<br> From their Lord, but they<br> Listen to it as in jest,&#8212;</p>  
<p>3. Their hearts toying as with<br> Trifles. The wrong-doers conceal<br> Their private counsels, (saying),<br> "Is this (one) more than<br> A man like yourselves?<br> Will ye go to witchcraft<br> With your eyes open?"</p>  
<p>4. Say: "My Lord<br> Knoweth (every) word (spoken)<br> In the heavens and on earth:<br> He is the One that heareth<br> And knoweth (all things)."</p>  
<p><a name="page_823"><font size="1" color="green">p. 823</font></A></p>  
<p>5. "Nay," they say, "(these are)<br> Medleys of dreams!&#8212;Nay,<br> He forged it!&#8212;Nay,<br> He is (but) a poet!<br> Let him then bring us<br> A Sign like the ones<br> That were sent to<br> (Prophets) of old!"</p>  
<p>6. (As to those) before them,<br> Not one of the populations<br> Which We destroyed believed:<br> Will these believe?</p>  
<p>7. Before thee, also, the apostles<br> We sent were but men,<br> To whom We granted inspiration:<br> If ye realise this not, ask<br> Of those who possess the Message.</p>  
<p>8. Nor did We give them<br> Bodies that ate no food,<br> Nor were they exempt from death.</p>  
<p>9. In the end We fulfilled<br> To them Our promise,<br> And We saved them<br> And those whom We pleased,</p>  
<p><a name="page_824"><font size="1" color="green">p. 824</font></A></p>  
<p>But We destroyed those<br> Who transgressed beyond bounds.</p>  
<p>10. We have revealed for you<br> (O men!) a book in which<br> Is a Message for you:<br> Will ye not then understand?</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>11. How many were the populations<br> We utterly destroyed because<br> Of their iniquities, setting up<br> In their places other peoples?</p>  
<p>12. Yet, when they felt<br> Our Punishment (coming),<br> Behold, they (tried to) flee<br> From it.</p>  
<p>13. Flee not, but return to<br> The good things of this life<br> Which were given you,<br> And to your homes,<br> In order that ye may<br> Be called to account</p>  
<p>14. They said: "Ah! woe to us!<br> We were indeed wrong-doers!"</p>  
<p>15. And that cry of theirs<br> Ceased not, till we made</p>  
<p><a name="page_825"><font size="1" color="green">p. 825</font></A></p>  
<p>Them as a field<br> That is mown, as ashes<br> Silent and quenched.</p>  
<p>16. Not for (idle) sport did We<br> Create the heavens and the earth<br> And all that is between!</p>  
<p>17. If it had been Our wish<br> To take (just) a pastime,<br> We should surely have taken<br> It from the things nearest<br> To Us, if We would<br> Do (such a thing)!</p>  
<p>18. Nay, We hurl the Truth<br> Against falsehood, and it knocks<br> Out its brain, and behold,<br> Falsehood doth perish!<br> Ah! woe be to you<br> For the (false) things<br> Ye ascribe (to Us).</p>  
<p>19. To Him belong all (creatures)<br> In the heavens and on earth:<br> Even those who are in His<br> (Very) Presence are not <br> Too proud to serve Him,<br> Nor are they (ever) weary<br> (Of His service):</p>  
<p>20. They celebrate His praises<br> Night and day, nor do they<br> Ever flag or intermit.</p>  
<p><a name="page_826"><font size="1" color="green">p. 826</font></A></p>  
<p>21. Or have they taken<br> (For worship) gods from the earth<br> Who can raise (the dead)?</p>  
<p>22. If there were, in the heavens<br> And the earth, other gods<br> Besides God, there would<br> Have been confusion in both!<br> But glory to God,<br> The Lord of the Throne:<br> (High is He) above<br> What they attribute to Him!</p>  
<p>23. He cannot be questioned<br> For His acts, but they<br> Will be questioned (for theirs).</p>  
<p>24. Or have they taken<br> For worship (other) gods<br> Besides him? Say, "Bring<br> Your convincing proof: this<br> Is the Message of those<br> With me and the Message<br> Of those before me."<br> But most of them know not<br> The Truth, and so turn away.</p>  
<p><a name="page_827"><font size="1" color="green">p. 827</font></A></p>  
<p>25. Not an apostle did We<br> Send before thee without<br> This inspiration sent by Us<br> To him: that there is<br> No god but I; therefore<br> Worship and serve Me.</p>  
<p>26. And they say: "(God)<br> Most Gracious has begotten<br> Offspring." Glory to Him!<br> They are (but) servants raised<br> To honour.</p>  
<p>27. They speak not before<br> He speaks, and they act<br> (In all things) by His command.</p>  
<p>28. He knows what is before them,<br> And what is behind them,<br> And they offer no intercession<br> Except for those who are<br> Acceptable, and they stand<br> In awe and reverence<br> Of His (glory).</p>  
<p>29. If any of them should say,<br> "I am a god besides Him",<br> Such a one We should<br> Reward with Hell: thus<br> Do We reward those<br> Who do wrong.</p>  
<p><a name="page_828"><font size="1" color="green">p. 828</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
<p>30. Do not the Unbelievers see<br> That the heavens and the earth<br> Were joined together (as one<br> Unit of Creation), before<br> We clove them asunder?<br> We made from water<br> Every living thing. Will they<br> Not then believe?</p>  
<p>31. And We have set on the earth<br> Mountains standing firm,</p>  
<p><a name="page_829"><font size="1" color="green">p. 829</font></A></p>  
<p>Lest it should shake with them,<br> And We have made therein<br> Broad highways<br> (between mountains)<br> For them to pass through:<br> That they may receive guidance.</p>  
<p>32. And We have made<br> The heavens as a canopy<br> Well guarded: yet do they<br> Turn away from the Signs<br> Which these things (point to)!</p>  
<p>33. It is He Who created<br> The Night and the Day,<br> And the sun and the moon:<br> All (the celestial bodies)<br> Swim along, each in its<br> Rounded course.</p>  
<p>34. We granted not to any man<br> Before thee permanent life<br> (Here): If then thou shouldst die,<br> Would they live permanently?</p>  
<p>35. Every soul shall have<br> A taste of death:<br> And We test you<br> By evil and by good</p>  
<p><a name="page_830"><font size="1" color="green">p. 830</font></A></p>  
<p>By way of trial.<br> To Us must ye return.</p>  
<p>36. When the Unbelievers see thee,<br> They treat thee not except<br> With ridicule. "Is this,"<br> (They say), "the one who talks<br> Of your gods?" And they<br> Blaspheme at the mention<br> Of (God) Most Gracious!</p>  
<p>37. Man is a creature of haste:<br> Soon (enough) will I show<br> You My Signs; then<br> Ye will not ask Me<br> To hasten them!</p>  
<p>38. They say: "When will this<br> Promise come to pass,<br> If ye are telling the truth?"</p>  
<p>39. If only the Unbelievers<br> Knew (the time) when they<br> Will not be able<br> To ward off the Fire<br> From their faces, nor yet<br> From their backs, and (when)<br> No help can reach them!</p>  
<p>40. Nay, it may come to them<br> All of a sudden and confound<br> Them: no power will they<br> Have then to avert it,<br> Nor will they (then)<br> Get respite.</p>  
<p><a name="page_831"><font size="1" color="green">p. 831</font></A></p>  
<p>41. Mocked were (many)<br> Apostles before thee;<br> But their scoffers<br> Were hemmed in<br> By the thing that they mocked.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
<p>42. Say, "Who can keep<br> You safe by night and by day<br> From (the Wrath of) (God)<br> Most Gracious?" Yet they<br> Turn away from the mention<br> Of their Lord.</p>  
<p>43. Or have they gods that<br> Can guard them from Us?<br> They have no power to aid<br> Themselves, nor can they<br> Be defended from Us.</p>  
<p>44. Nay, We gave the good things<br> Of this life to these men<br> And their fathers until<br> The period grew long for them;<br> See they not that We<br> Gradually reduce the land<br> (In their control) from<br> Its outlying borders? Is it<br> Then they who will win?</p>  
<p><a name="page_832"><font size="1" color="green">p. 832</font></A></p>  
<p>45. Say, "I do but warn you<br> According to revelation":<br> But the deaf will not hear<br> The call, (even) when<br> They are warned!</p>  
<p>46. If but a breath of the Wrath<br> Of thy Lord do touch them,<br> They will then say, "Woe<br> To us! we did wrong indeed!"</p>  
<p>47. We shall set up scales<br> Of justice for the day<br> Of Judgment, so that<br> Not a soul will be dealt with<br> Unjustly in the least.<br> And if there be<br> (No more than) the weight<br> Of a mustard seed,<br> We will bring it (to account):<br> And enough are We<br> To take account.</p>  
<p>48. In the past We granted<br> To Moses and Aaron</p>  
<p><a name="page_833"><font size="1" color="green">p. 833</font></A></p>  
<p>The Criterion (for judgment),<br> And a Light and a Message<br> For those who would do right,&#8212;</p>  
<p>49. Those who fear their Lord<br> In their most secret thoughts,<br> And who hold the Hour<br> (Of Judgment) in awe.</p>  
<p>50. And this is a blessed<br> Message which We have<br> Sent down: will ye then<br> Reject it?</p>  
<p><a name="page_834"><font size="1" color="green">p. 834</font></A></p>  
<p>51. We bestowed aforetime<br> On Abraham his rectitude<br> Of conduct, and well were we<br> Acquainted with him.</p>  
<p>52. Behold! he said<br> To his father and his people<br> "What are these images,<br> To which ye are<br> (So assiduously) devoted?"</p>  
<p>53. They said, "We found<br> Our fathers worshipping them."</p>  
<p>54. He said, "Indeed ye<br> Have been made in manifest<br> Error&#8212;ye and your fathers."</p>  
<p>55. They said, "Have you<br> Brought us the Truth,<br> Or are you one<br> Of those who jest?"</p>  
<p>56. He said, "Nay, your Lord<br> Is the Lord of the heavens<br> And the earth, He Who<br> Created them (from nothing):<br> And I am a witness<br> To this (truth).</p>  
<p><a name="page_835"><font size="1" color="green">p. 835</font></A></p>  
<p>57. "And by god, I have<br> A plan for your idols&#8212;<br> After ye go away<br> And turn your backs"&#8230;</p>  
<p>58. So he broke them to pieces,<br> (All) but the biggest of them,<br> That they might turn<br> (And address themselves) to it.</p>  
<p>59. They said, "Who has<br> Done this to our gods?<br> He must indeed be<br> Some man of impiety!"</p>  
<p>60. They said, "We heard<br> A youth talk of them:<br> He is called Abraham."</p>  
<p>61. They said, "Then bring him<br> Before the eyes of the people,<br> That they may bear witness:"</p>  
<p>62. They said, "Art thou<br> The one that did this<br> With our gods, O Abraham?"</p>  
<p><a name="page_836"><font size="1" color="green">p. 836</font></A></p>  
<p>63. He said: "Nay, this<br> Was done by &#8212;<br> This is their biggest one!<br> Ask them, if they<br> Can speak intelligently!"</p>  
<p>64. So they turned to themselves<br> And said, "Surely ye<br> Are the ones in the wrong!</p>  
<p>65. Then were they confounded<br> With shame: (they said),<br> "Thou knowest full well that<br> These (idols) do not speak!"</p>  
<p>66. (Abraham) said, "Do ye then<br> Worship, besides God,<br> Things that can neither<br> Be of any good to you<br> Nor do you harm?</p>  
<p>67. "Fie upon you, and upon<br> The things that ye worship<br> Besides God! Have ye<br> No sense?"&#8230;</p>  
<p>68. They said, "Burn him<br> And protect your gods,<br> If ye do (anything at all)!"</p>  
<p><a name="page_837"><font size="1" color="green">p. 837</font></A></p>  
<p>69. We said, "O Fire!<br> Be thou cool,<br> And (a means of) safety<br> For Abraham!"</p>  
<p>70. Then they sought a stratagem<br> Against him: but We<br> Made them the ones<br> That lost most!</p>  
<p>71. But We delivered him<br> And (his nephew) L&#363;t<br> (And directed them) to the land<br> Which We have blessed<br> For the nations.</p>  
<p>72. And We bestowed on him Isaac</p>  
<p><a name="page_838"><font size="1" color="green">p. 838</font></A></p>  
<p>And, as an additional gift,<br> (A grandson), Jacob, and We<br> Made righteous men of every one<br> (Of them).</p>  
<p>73. And We made them<br> Leaders, guiding (men) by<br> Our Command, and We<br> Sent them inspiration<br> To do good deeds,<br> To establish regular prayers,<br> And to practise regular charity;<br> And they constantly served<br> Us (and Us only).</p>  
<p>74. And to L&#363;t, too,<br> We gave Judgment and Knowledge,<br> And We saved him<br> From the town which practised<br> Abominations: truly they were<br> A people given to Evil,<br> A rebellious people.</p>  
<p>75. And We admitted him<br> To Our Mercy: for he<br> Was one of the Righteous.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
<p>76. (Remember) Noah, when<br> He cried (to Us) aforetime:<br> We listened to his (prayer)<br> And delivered him and his<br> Family from great distress.</p>  
<p><a name="page_839"><font size="1" color="green">p. 839</font></A></p>  
<p>77. We helped him against<br> People who rejected Our Signs:<br> Truly they were a people<br> Given to Evil: so We<br> Drowned them (in the Flood)<br> All together.</p>  
<p>78. And remember David<br> And Solomon, when they<br> Gave judgment in the matter<br> Of the field into which<br> The sheep of certain people<br> Had strayed by night:<br> We did witness their judgment.</p>  
<p>79. To Solomon We inspired<br> The (right) understanding<br> Of the matter: to each<br> (Of them) We gave Judgment<br> And Knowledge; it was<br> Our power that made<br> The hills and the birds<br> Celebrate Our praises,<br> With David: it was We<br> Who did (all these things).</p>  
<p>80. It was We Who taught him<br> The making of coats of mail</p>  
<p><a name="page_840"><font size="1" color="green">p. 840</font></A></p>  
<p>For your benefit, to guard<br> You from each other's violence:<br> Will ye then be grateful?</p>  
<p>81. (It was Our power that<br> Made) the violent (unruly)<br> Wind flow (tamely) for Solomon,<br> To his order, to the land<br> Which We had blessed:<br> For We do know all things.</p>  
<p>82. And of the evil ones,<br> Were some who dived<br> For him, and did other work<br> Besides; and it was We<br> Who guarded them.</p>  
<p>83. And (remember) Job, when<br> He cried to his Lord,<br> "Truly distress has seized me,<br> But Thou art the Most</p>  
<p><a name="page_841"><font size="1" color="green">p. 841</font></A></p>  
<p>Merciful of those that are<br> Merciful."</p>  
<p>84. So We listened to him:<br> We removed the distress<br> That was on him,<br> And We restored his people<br> To him, and doubled<br> Their number,&#8212;as a Grace<br> From Ourselves, and a thing<br> For commemoration, for all<br> Who serve Us.</p>  
<p>85. And (remember) Ism&#257;&#8216;&#299;l,<br> Idr&#299;s, and &#7826;ul-kifl, all<br> (Men) of constancy and patience;</p>  
<p>86. We admitted them to<br> Our Mercy: for they<br> Were of the Righteous ones.</p>  
<p><a name="page_842"><font size="1" color="green">p. 842</font></A></p>  
<p>87. And remember &#7826;un-n&#363;n,<br> When he departed in wrath:<br> He imagined that We<br> Had no power over him!<br> But he cried through the depths<br> Of darkness, "There is<br> No god but Thou:<br> Glory to Thee: I was<br> Indeed wrong!"</p>  
<p>88. So We listened to him:<br> And delivered him from<br> Distress: and thus do We<br> Deliver those who have faith.</p>  
<p>89. And (remember) Zakar&#299;y&#257;,<br> When he cried to his Lord:<br> "O my Lord! leave me not<br> Without offspring, though Thou<br> Art the best of inheritors."</p>  
<p>90. So We listened to him:<br> And We granted him</p>  
<p><a name="page_843"><font size="1" color="green">p. 843</font></A></p>  
<p>Yabya: We cured his wife's<br> (Barrenness) for him. These (three)<br> Were ever quick in emulation<br> In good works: they used<br> To call on Us with love<br> And reverence, and humble themselves<br> Before Us.</p>  
<p>91. And (remember) her who<br> Guarded her chastity:<br> We breathed into her<br> Of Our Spirit, and We<br> Made her and her son<br> A Sign for all peoples.</p>  
<p>92. Verily, this Brotherhood<br> Of yours is a single Brotherhood,<br> And I am your Lord<br> And Cherisher: therefore<br> Serve Me (and no other).</p>  
<p>93. But (later generations) cut off<br> Their affair (of unity),<br> One from another: (yet)<br> Will they all return to Us.</p>  
<p><a name="page_844"><font size="1" color="green">p. 844</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 7.</h5>  
<p>94. Whoever works any act<br> Of Righteousness and has Faith,&#8212;<br> His endeavour will not<br> Be rejected: We shall<br> Record it in his favour.</p>  
<p>95. But there is a ban<br> On any population which<br> We have destroyed: that they<br> Shall not return,</p>  
<p>96. Until the Gog and Magog (people)<br> Are let through (their barrier),<br> And they swiftly swarm<br> From every hill.</p>  
<p>97. Then will the True Promise<br> Draw nigh (of fulfilment):<br> Then behold! the eyes<br> Of the Unbelievers will<br> Fixedly stare in horror: "Ah!<br> Woe to us! we were indeed<br> Heedless of this; nay, we<br> Truly did wrong!"</p>  
<p><a name="page_845"><font size="1" color="green">p. 845</font></A></p>  
<p>98. Verily ye, (Unbelievers),<br> And the (false) gods that<br> Ye worship besides God,<br> Are (but) fuel for Hell!<br> To it will ye (surely) come!</p>  
<p>99. If these had been gods,<br> They would not have got there!<br> But each one will abide<br> Therein.</p>  
<p>100. There, sobbing will be<br> Their lot, nor will they<br> There hear (aught else).</p>  
<p>101. Whose hose for whom<br> The Good (Record) from Us<br> Has gone before, will be<br> Removed far therefrom.</p>  
<p>102. Not the slightest sound<br> Will they hear of Hell:<br> What their souls desired,<br> In that will they dwell.</p>  
<p>103. The Great Terror will<br> Bring them no grief:<br> But the angels will meet them<br> (With mutual greetings):<br> "This is your Day,&#8212;<br> (The Day) that ye were promised."</p>  
<p><a name="page_846"><font size="1" color="green">p. 846</font></A></p>  
<p>104. The Day that We roll up<br> The heavens like a scroll<br> Rolled up for books (completed),&#8212;<br> Even as We produced<br> The first Creation, so<br> Shall We produce<br> A new one: a promise<br> We have undertaken:<br> Truly shall We fulfil it.</p>  
<p>105. Before this We wrote<br> In the Psalms, after the Message<br> (Given to Moses): "My servants,<br> The righteous, shall inherit<br> The earth."</p>  
<p>106. Verily in this (Qur-&#257;n)<br> Is a Message for people<br> Who would (truly) worship God.</p>  
<p>107. We sent thee not, but<br> As a Mercy for all creatures.</p>  
<p><a name="page_847"><font size="1" color="green">p. 847</font></A></p>  
<p>108. Say: "What has come to me<br> By inspiration is that<br> Your God is One God:<br> Will ye therefore bow<br> To His Will (in Isl&#257;m)?"</p>  
<p>109. But if they turn back,<br> Say: "I have proclaimed<br> The Message to you all alike<br> And in truth; but I<br> Know not whether that<br> Which ye are promised<br> Is near or far.</p>  
<p>110. "It is He Who knows<br> What is open in speech<br> And what ye hide<br> (In your hearts).</p>  
<p>111. "I know not but that<br> It may be a trial<br> For you, and a grant<br> Of (worldly) livelihood<br> (To you) for a time."</p>  
<p><a name="page_848"><font size="1" color="green">p. 848</font></A></p>  
<p>112. Say: "O my Lord!<br> Judge Thou in truth!<br> "Our Lord Most Gracious<br> Is the One Whose assistance<br> Should be sought against<br> The blasphemies ye utter!</p>
