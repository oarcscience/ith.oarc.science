### Sura LXXVI.

### *Dahr,* or Time, or *Insān,* or Man.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Has there not been  
Over Man a long period  
Of Time, when he was  
Nothing—(not even) mentioned?

2\. Verily We created  
Man from a drop  
Of mingled sperm,  
In order to try him:  
So We gave him (the gifts).  
Of Hearing and Sight.

3\. We showed him, the Way:  
Whether he be grateful  
Or ungrateful (rests  
On his will).

4\. For the Rejecters  
We have prepared

<span id="page_1656">p. 1656</span>

Chains, Yokes, and  
A Blazing Fire.

5\. As to the Righteous,  
They shall drink  
Of a Cup (of Wine)  
Mixed with Kāfūr,—

6\. A Fountain where  
The Devotees of God  
Do drink, making it  
Flow in unstinted abundance.

7\. They perform (their) vows,  
And they fear a Day  
Whose evil flies far and wide.

8\. And they feed, for the love  
Of God, the indigent,  
The orphan, and the captive,—

<span id="page_1657">p. 1657</span>

9\. (Saying), "We feed you  
For the sake of God alone:  
No reward do we desire  
From you, nor thanks.

10\. "We only fear a Day  
Of distressful Wrath  
From the side of our Lord."

11\. But God will deliver  
Them from the evil  
Of that Day, and will  
Shed over them a Light  
Of Beauty and  
A (blissful) Joy.

12\. And because they were  
Patient and constant, He will  
Reward them with a Garden  
And (garments of) silk.

13\. Reclining in the (Garden)  
On raised thrones,  
They will see there neither  
The sun's (excessive heat)  
Nor (the moon's) excessive cold.

14\. And the shades of the (Garden)  
Will come low over them,  
And the bunches (of fruit),  
There, will hang low  
In humility.

<span id="page_1658">p. 1658</span>

15\. And amongst them will be  
Passed round vessels of silver  
And goblets of crystal,—

16\. Crystal-clear, made of silver:  
They will determine  
The measure thereof  
(According to their wishes).

17\. And they will be given  
To drink there of a Cup  
(Of Wine) mixed  
With Zanjaḅīl,—

18\. A fountain there,  
Called Salsabīl.

19\. And round about them  
Will (serve) youths  
Of perpetual (freshness):  
If thou seest them,  
Thou wouldst think them  
Scattered Pearls.

20\. And when thou lookest,  
It is there thou wilt see

<span id="page_1659">p. 1659</span>

A Bliss and  
A Realm Magnificent.

21\. Upon them will be  
Green Garments of fine silk  
And heavy brocade,  
And they will be adorned  
With Bracelets of silver;  
And their Lord will  
Give to them to drink  
Of a Wine  
Pure and Holy.

22\. "Verily this is a Reward  
For you, and your Endeavour  
Is accepted and recognised."

##### SECTION 2.

23\. It is We Who  
Have sent down the Qur-ān  
To thee by stages.

24\. Therefore be patient  
With constancy to the Command  
Of thy Lord, and hearken not  
To the sinner or the ingrate  
Among them.

25\. And celebrate the name

<span id="page_1660">p. 1660</span>

Of thy Lord morning  
And evening,

26\. And part of the night,  
Prostrate thyself to Him;  
And glorify Him  
A long night through.

27\. As to these, they love  
The fleeting life,  
And put away behind them  
A Day (that will be) hard.

28\. It is We Who created  
Them, and We have made  
Their joints strong;  
But, when We will,  
We can substitute  
The like of them  
By a complete change.

29\. This is an admonition:  
Whosoever will, let him  
Take a (straight) Path  
To his Lord.

30\. But ye will not,  
Except as God wills;

<span id="page_1661">p. 1661</span>

For God is full of  
Knowledge and Wisdom.

31\. He will admit  
To His Mercy Whom He will;  
But the wrong-doers,—  
For them has He prepared  
A grievous Penalty.
