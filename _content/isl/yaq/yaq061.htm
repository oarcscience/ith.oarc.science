<p><a name="page_1539"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1539</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&#363;ra LXI.</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><i>&#7778;aff,</i> or Battle Array.</h3>  
<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
<p>1. Whatever is<br> In the heavens and<br> On earth, let it declare<br> The Praises and Glory<br> Of God: for He is<br> The Exalted in Might,<br> The Wise.</p>  
<p>2. O ye who believe!<br> Why say ye that<br> Which ye do not?</p>  
<p>3. Grievously odious is it<br> In the sight of God<br> That ye say that<br> Which ye do not.</p>  
<p>4. Truly God loves those<br> Who fight in His Cause<br> In battle array, as if<br> They were a solid<br> Cemented structure.</p>  
<p>5. And remember, Moses said<br> To his people: "O my people!</p>  
<p><a name="page_1540"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1540</font></A></p>  
<p>Why do ye vex and insult<br> Me, though ye know<br> That I am the apostle<br> Of God (sent) to you?"<br> Then when they went wrong,<br> God let their hearts go wrong.<br> For God guides not those<br> Who are rebellious transgressors.</p>  
<p>6. And remember, Jesus,<br> The son of Mary, said:<br> "O Children of Israel!<br> I am the apostle of God<br> (Sent) to you, confirming<br> The Law (which came)<br> Before me, and giving<br> Glad Tidings of an Apostle<br> To come after me,<br> Whose name shall be A&#7717;mad."<br> But when he came to them<br> With Clear Signs,<br> They said, "This is<br> Evident sorcery!"</p>  
<p>7. Who doth greater wrong<br> Than one who invents</p>  
<p><a name="page_1541"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1541</font></A></p>  
<p>Falsehood against God,<br> Even as he is being invited<br> To Isl&#257;m? And God<br> Guides not those<br> Who do wrong.</p>  
<p>8. Their intention is<br> To extinguish God's Light<br> (By blowing) with their mouths:<br> But God will complete<br> (The revelation of) His Light,<br> Even though the Unbelievers<br> May detest (it).</p>  
<p>9. It is He Who has sent<br> His Apostle with Guidance<br> And the Religion of Truth,<br> That he may proclaim it<br> Over all religion,<br> Even though the Pagans<br> May detest (it).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>10. O ye who believe!<br> Shall I lead you<br> To a bargain that will<br> Save you from<br> A grievous Penalty?&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="page_1542"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1542</font></A></p>  
<p>11. That ye believe in God<br> And His Apostle, and that<br> Ye strive (your utmost)<br> In the Cause of God,<br> With your property<br> And your persons:<br> That will be best for you,<br> If ye but knew!</p>  
<p>12. He will forgive you<br> Your sins, and admit you<br> To Gardens beneath which<br> Rivers flow, and to beautiful<br> Mansions in Gardens<br> Of Eternity: that is indeed<br> The supreme Achievement.</p>  
<p>13. And another (favour<br> Will He bestow), which ye<br> Do love,&#8212;help from God<br> And a speedy victory.<br> So give the Glad Tidings<br> To the Believers.</p>  
<p>14. O ye who believe!<br> Be ye helpers of God:<br> As said Jesus the son of Mary<br> To the Disciples, "Who will be<br> My helpers to (the work<br> Of) God?" Said the Disciples,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1543"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1543</font></A></p>  
<p>"We are God's helpers!"<br> Then a portion of the Children<br> Of Israel believed, and<br> A portion disbelieved:<br> But We gave power<br> To those who believed,<br> Against their enemies,<br> And they became<br> The ones that prevailed.</p>
