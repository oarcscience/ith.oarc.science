### Sūra LXXV.

### *Qiyāmat,* or the Resurrection.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. I do call to witness  
The Resurrection Day;

2\. And I do call to witness  
The self-reproaching spirit:  
(Eschew Evil).

3\. Does man think that We  
Cannot assemble his bones?

4\. Nay, We are able to put  
Together in perfect order  
The very tips of his fingers.

5\. But man wishes to do  
Wrong (even) in the time  
In front of him.

6\. He questions: "When  
Is the Day of Resurrection?"

<span id="page_1650">p. 1650</span>

7\. At length, when  
The Sight is dazed,

8\. And the moon is  
Buried in darkness.

9\. And the sun and moon  
Are joined together,—

10\. That Day will Man say:  
"Where is the refuge?"

11\. By no means!  
No place of safety!

12\. Before thy Lord (alone),  
That Day will be  
The place of rest.

13\. That Day will Man  
Be told (all) that he  
Put forward, and all  
That he put back.

14\. Nay, man will be  
Evidence against himself,

15\. Even though he were  
To put up his excuses.

<span id="page_1651">p. 1651</span>

16\. Move not thy tongue  
Concerning the (Qur-ān)  
To make haste therewith,

17\. It is for Us to collect it  
And to promulgate it:

18\. But when We have  
Promulgated it, follow thou  
Its recital (as promulgated):

19\. Nay more, it is  
For us to explain it  
(And make it clear):

20\. Nay, (ye men!)  
But ye love  
The fleeting life,

21\. And leave alone  
The Hereafter.

22\. Some faces, that Day,  
Will beam (in brightness  
And beauty);—

23\. Looking towards their Lord;

<span id="page_1652">p. 1652</span>

24\. And some faces, that Day,  
Will be sad and dismal,

25\. In the thought that some  
Back-breaking calamity was about  
To be indicted on them;

26\. Yea, when (the soul)  
Reaches to the collar-bone  
(In its exit),

27\. And there will be a cry,  
"Who is a magician  
(To restore him)?"

28\. And he will conclude  
That it was (the Time)  
Of Parting;

29\. And one leg will be  
Joined with another:

30\. That Day the Drive  
Will be (all) to thy Lord!

##### SECTION 2.

31\. So he gave nothing  
In charity, nor  
Did he pray!—

<span id="page_1653">p. 1653</span>

32\. But on the contrary,  
He rejected Truth  
And turned away!

33\. Then did he stalk  
To his family  
In full conceit!

34\. Woe to thee,  
(O man!, yea, woe!

35\. Again, woe to thee,  
(O man!), yea, woe!

36\. Does Man think  
That he will be left  
Uncontrolled, (without purpose)?

37\. Was he not a drop  
Of sperm emitted  
(In lowly form)?

38\. Then did he become  
A leech-like clot;  
Then did (God) make  
And fashion (him)  
In due proportion.

39\. And of him He made  
Two sexes, male  
And female.

40\. Has not He, (the same),  
The power to give life  
To the dead?
