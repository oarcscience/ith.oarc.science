<p><a name="page_1102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1102</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&#363;ra XXXIII.</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><i>A&#7717;z&#257;b</i>, or The Confederates.</h3>  
<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
<p>1. O Prophet! Fear God,<br> And hearken not<br> To the Unbelievers<br> And the Hypocrites:<br> Verily god is full<br> Of knowledge and wisdom.</p>  
<p>2. But follow that which<br> Comes to thee by inspiration<br> From thy Lord: for God<br> Is well acquainted<br> With (all) that ye do.</p>  
<p>3. And put thy trust<br> In God, and enough is God<br> As a Disposer of affairs.</p>  
<p>4. God has not made<br> For any man two hearts</p>  
<p><a name="page_1103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1103</font></A></p>  
<p>In his (one) body: nor has<br> He made your wives whom<br> Ye divorce by &#7826;ih&#257;r<br> Your mothers: nor has He<br> Made your adopted sons<br> Your sons. Such is (only)<br> Your (manner of) speech<br> By your mouths. but God<br> Tells (you) the Truth, and He<br> Shows the (right) Way.</p>  
<p>5. Call them by (the names<br> Of) their fathers: that is<br> Juster in the sight of God.<br> But if ye know not<br> Their father's (names, call<br> Them) your Brothers in faith,<br> Or your <i>Maul&#257;s.<br> </i>But there is no blame<br> On you if ye make<br> A mistake therein:<br> (What counts is)<br> The intention of your hearts:<br> And god is Oft-Returning,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1104</font></A></p>  
<p>6. The Prophet is closer<br> To the Believers than<br> Their own selves,<br> And his wives are<br> Their mothers. Blood-relations<br> Among each other have<br> Closer personal ties,<br> In the Decree of God.<br> Than (the Brotherhood of)<br> Believers and Muh&#257;jirs:<br> Nevertheless do ye<br> What is just to your<br> Closest friends: such is<br> The writing in the Decree<br> (Of God).</p>  
<p>7. And remember We took<br> From the Prophets their<br> Covenant:<br> As (We did) from thee:<br> From Noah, Abraham, Moses,<br> And Jesus the son of Mary:<br> We took from them<br> A solemn Covenant:</p>  
<p><a name="page_1105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1105</font></A></p>  
<p>8. That (God) may question<br> The (Custodians) of Truth concerning<br> The Truth they (were charged with):<br> And He has prepared<br> For the Unbelievers<br> A grievous Penalty.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>9. O ye who believe!<br> Remember the Grace of God,<br> (Bestowed) on you, when<br> There came down on you<br> Hosts (to overwhelm you):<br> But We sent against them</p>  
<p><a name="page_1106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1106</font></A></p>  
<p>A hurricane and forces<br> That ye saw not:<br> But God sees (clearly)<br> All that ye do.</p>  
<p>10. Behold! they came on you<br> From above you and from<br> Below you, and behold,<br> The eyes became dim<br> And the hearts gaped<br> Up to the throats,<br> And ye imagined various<br> (Vain) thoughts about God!</p>  
<p>11. In that situation<br> Were the Believers tried:<br> They were shaken as by<br> A tremendous shaking.</p>  
<p>12. Find behold! The Hypocrites<br> And those in whose hearts<br> Is a disease (even) say: "God<br> And His Apostle promised us<br> Nothing but delusions!"</p>  
<p>13. Behold! A party among them<br> Said: "Ye men of Ya<u>th</u>rib!<br> Ye cannot stand (the attack)!<br> Therefore go back!"<br> And a band of them<br> Ask for leave of the Prophet,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1107</font></A></p>  
<p>Saying, "Truly our houses<br> Are bare and exposed," though<br> They were not exposed:<br> They intended nothing but<br> To run away.</p>  
<p>14. And if an entry had<br> Been effected to them<br> From the sides of the (City),<br> And they had been<br> Incited to sedition.<br> They would certainly have<br> Brought it to pass, with<br> None but a brief delay!</p>  
<p>15. And yet they had already<br> Covenanted with God not to turn<br> Their backs, and a covenant<br> With God must (surely)<br> Be answered for.</p>  
<p>16. Say: "Running away will not<br> Profit you if ye are<br> Running away from death<br> Or slaughter; and even if<br> (Ye do escape), no more<br> Than a brief (respite)<br> Will ye be allowed to enjoy!"</p>  
<p><a name="page_1108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1108</font></A></p>  
<p>17. Say: "Who is it that can<br> Screen you from God<br> If it be His wish<br> To give you Punishment<br> Or to give you Mercy?"<br> Nor will they find for themselves,<br> Besides God, any protector<br> Or helper.</p>  
<p>18. Verily God knows those<br> Among you who keep back<br> (Men) and those who say<br> To their brethren, "Come along<br> To us", but come not<br> To the fight except<br> For just a little while,</p>  
<p>19. Covetous over you<br> Then when fear comes,<br> Thou wilt see them looking<br> To thee, their eyes revolving,<br> Like (those of) one over whom<br> Hovers death: but when<br> The fear is past,<br> They will smite you<br> With sharp tongues, covetous<br> Of goods. Such men have<br> No faith, and so God<br> Has made their deeds<br> Of none effect: and that<br> Is easy for God.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1109</font></A></p>  
<p>20. They think that the Confederates<br> Have not withdrawn; and if<br> The Confederates should come (again),<br> They would wish they were<br> In the deserts (wandering)<br> Among the Bedouins, and<br> Seeking news about you<br> (From a safe distance);<br> And if they were<br> In your midst, they<br> Would fight but little.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
<p>21. Ye have indeed<br> In the Apostle of God<br> A beautiful pattern (of conduct)<br> For any one whose hope is<br> In God and the Final Day,<br> And who engages much<br> In the praise of God.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1110</font></A></p>  
<p>22. When the Believers saw<br> The Confederate forces,<br> They said: "This is<br> What God and His Apostle is<br> Had promised us, and God<br> And His Apostle told us<br> What was true." And it<br> Only added to their faith<br> And their zeal in obedience.</p>  
<p>23. Among the Believers are then<br> Who have been true to<br> Their Covenant with God:<br> Of them some have completed<br> Their vow (to the extreme),<br> And some (still) wait:<br> But they have never changed<br> (Their determination) in the least:</p>  
<p>24. That God may reward<br> The men of Truth for<br> Their Truth, and punish<br> The Hypocrites if that be</p>  
<p><a name="page_1111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1111</font></A></p>  
<p>His Will, or turn to them<br> In Mercy: for God is<br> Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>  
<p>25. And God turned back<br> The Unbelievers for (all)<br> Their fury: no advantage<br> Did they gain; and enough<br> Is God for the Believers<br> In their fight. And God<br> Is full of Strength, Able<br> To enforce His Will.</p>  
<p>26. And those of the people<br> Of the Book who aided<br> Them&#8212;God did take them<br> Down from their strongholds</p>  
<p><a name="page_1112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1112</font></A></p>  
<p>And cast terror into<br> Their hearts, (so that)<br> Some ye slew, and some<br> Ye made prisoners,</p>  
<p>27. And He made you heirs<br> Of their lands, their houses,<br> And their goods,<br> And of a land which</p>  
<p><a name="page_1113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1113</font></A></p>  
<p>Ye had not frequented<br> (Before). And God has<br> Power over all things.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
<p>28. O Prophet! say<br> To thy Consorts:<br> "If it be that ye desire<br> The life of this world,<br> And its glitter,&#8212;then come!<br> I will provide for your</p>  
<p><a name="page_1114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1114</font></A></p>  
<p>Enjoyment and set you free<br> In a handsome manner.</p>  
<p>29. But if ye seek God<br> And His Apostle, and<br> The Home of the Hereafter,<br> Verily God has prepared<br> For the well-doers amongst you<br> A great reward.</p>  
<p>30. O Consorts of the Prophet<br> If any of you were guilty<br> Of evident unseemly conduct,<br> The Punishment would be<br> Doubled to her, and that<br> Is easy for God</p>  
<p><a name="page_1115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1115</font></A></p>  
<p>31. But any of you that is<br> Devout in the service of<br> God and His Apostle,<br> And works righteousness,&#8212;<br> To her shall We grant<br> Her reward twice: and We<br> Have prepared for her<br> A generous Sustenance.</p>  
<p>32. O Consorts of the Prophet!<br> Ye are not like any<br> Of the (other) women:<br> If ye do fear (God),<br> Be not too complaisant<br> Of speech, lest one<br> In whose heart is<br> A disease should be moved<br> With desire: but speak ye<br> A speech (that is) just.</p>  
<p>33. And stay quietly in<br> Your houses, and make not<br> A dazzling display, like<br> That of the former Times<br> Of Ignorance; and establish<br> Regular Prayer, and give<br> Regular Charity; and obey<br> God and His Apostle.<br> And God only wishes<br> To remove all abomination</p>  
<p><a name="page_1116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1116</font></A></p>  
<p>From you, ye Members<br> Of the Family, and to make<br> You pure and spotless.</p>  
<p>34. And recite what is<br> Rehearsed to you in your<br> Homes, of the Signs of God<br> And His Wisdom:<br> For God understands<br> The finest mysteries and<br> Is well-acquainted (with them).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
<p>35. For Muslim men and women,&#8212;<br> For believing men and women,<br> For devout men and women,<br> For true men and women,<br> For men and women who are<br> Patient and constant, for men<br> And women who humble themselves<br> For men and women who give<br> In charity, for men and women<br> Who fast (and deny themselves),<br> For men and women who<br> Guard their chastity, and<br> For men and women who</p>  
<p><a name="page_1117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1117</font></A></p>  
<p>Engage much in God's praise,&#8212;<br> For them has God prepared<br> Forgiveness and great reward.</p>  
<p>36. It is not fitting<br> For a Believer, man or woman.<br> When a matter has been decided<br> By God and His Apostle,<br> To have any option<br> About their decision:<br> If any one disobeys God<br> And His Apostle, he is indeed<br> On a clearly wrong Path.</p>  
<p>37. Behold! thou didst say<br> To one who had received<br> The grace of God<br> And thy favour: "Retain thou<br> (In wedlock) thy wife,<br> And fear God." But thou<br> Didst hide in thy heart<br> That which God was about<br> To make manifest: thou didst<br> Fear the people, but it is</p>  
<p><a name="page_1118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1118</font></A></p>  
<p>More fitting that thou shouldst<br> Fear God. Then when Zaid<br> Had dissolved (his marriage)<br> With her, with the necessary<br> (Formality), We joined her<br> In marriage to thee:<br> In order that (in future)<br> There may be no difficulty<br> To the Believers in (the matter<br> Of) marriage with the vives<br> Of their adopted sons, when<br> The latter have dissolved<br> With the necessary (formality)<br> (Their marriage) with them.<br> And God's command must<br> Be fulfilled.</p>  
<p>38. There can be no difficulty<br> To the Prophet in what<br> God has indicated to him<br> As a duty. It was<br> The practice (approved) of God<br> Amongst those of old<br> That have passed away.<br> And the command of God<br> Is a decree determined.</p>  
<p>39. (It is the practice of those)<br> Who preach the Messages<br> Of God, and fear Him,<br> And fear none but God.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1119</font></A></p>  
<p>And enough is God<br> To call (men) to account.</p>  
<p>40. Muhammad is not<br> The father of any<br> Of your men, but (he is)<br> The Apostle of God,<br> And the Seal of the Prophets:<br> And God has full knowledge<br> Of all things.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
<p>41. O ye who believe!<br> Celebrate the praises of God,<br> And do this often;</p>  
<p>42. And glorify Him<br> Morning and evening.</p>  
<p>43. He it is Who sends<br> Blessings on you, as do<br> His angels, that He may<br> Bring you out from the depths<br> Of Darkness into Light:<br> And He is Full of Mercy<br> To the Believers.</p>  
<p>44. Their salutation on the Day<br> They meet Him will be<br> "Peace!"; and He has<br> Prepared for them<br> A generous Reward.</p>  
<p>45. O Prophet! Truly We<br> Have sent thee as</p>  
<p><a name="page_1120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1120</font></A></p>  
<p>A Witness, a Bearer<br> Of Glad Tidings,<br> And a Warner,&#8212;</p>  
<p>46. And as one who invites<br> To God's (Grace) by His leave,<br> And as a Lamp<br> Spreading Light.</p>  
<p>47. Then give the glad tidings<br> To the Believers, that<br> They shall have from God<br> A very great Bounty.</p>  
<p>48. And obey not (the behests)<br> Of the Unbelievers<br> And the Hypocrites,<br> And heed not their annoyances,<br> But put thy trust in God.<br> For enough is God<br> As a Disposer of affairs.</p>  
<p>49. O ye who believe!<br> When ye marry believing women,<br> And then divorce them<br> Before ye have touched them,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1121</font></A></p>  
<p>No period of &#8217;Iddat<br> Have ye to count<br> In respect of them:<br> So give them a present,<br> And set them free<br> In a handsome manner.</p>  
<p>50. O Prophet! We have<br> Made lawful to thee<br> Thy wives to whom thou<br> Hast paid their dowers;<br> And those whom thy<br> Right hand possesses out of<br> The prisoners of war whom<br> God has assigned to thee;<br> And daughters of thy paternal<br> Uncles and aunts, and daughters<br> Of thy maternal uncles<br> And aunts, who migrated<br> (From Mecca) with thee;<br> And any believing woman<br> Who dedicates her soul</p>  
<p><a name="page_1122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1122</font></A></p>  
<p>To the Prophet if the Prophet<br> Wishes to wed her;&#8212;this<br> Only for thee, and not<br> For the Believers (at large);<br> We know what We have<br> Appointed for them as to<br> Their wives and the captives<br> Whom their right hands<br> Possess;&#8212;in order that<br> There should be no difficulty<br> For thee. And God is<br> Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>  
<p>51. Thou mayest defer (the turn<br> Of) any of them that thou<br> Pleasest, and thou mayest receive<br> Any thou pleasest: and there<br> Is no blame on thee if<br> Thou invite one whose (turn)</p>  
<p><a name="page_1123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1123</font></A></p>  
<p>Thou hadst set aside.<br> This were nigher to<br> The cooling of their eyes,<br> The prevention of their grief,<br> And their satisfaction&#8212;<br> That of all of them&#8212;<br> With that which thou<br> Hast to give them:<br> And God knows (all)<br> That is in your hearts:<br> And God is All-Knowing,<br> Most Forbearing.</p>  
<p>52. It is not lawful for thee<br> (To marry more) women<br> After this, nor to change<br> Them for (other) wives,<br> Even though their beauty<br> Attract thee, except any<br> Thy right hand should<br> Possess (as handmaidens):<br> And God doth watch<br> Over all things.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1124</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 7.</h5>  
<p>53. O ye who believe!<br> Enter not the Prophet's houses,&#8212;<br> Until leave is given you,<br> For a meal, (and then)<br> Not (so early as) to wait<br> For its preparation: but when<br> Ye are invited, enter;<br> And when ye have taken<br> Your meal, disperse,<br> Without seeking familiar talk.<br> Such (behaviour) annoys<br> The Prophet: he is ashamed<br> To dismiss you, but<br> God is not ashamed<br> (To tell you) the truth.<br> And when ye<br> Ask (his ladies)<br> For anything ye want,<br> Ask them from before<br> A screen: that makes<br> For greater purity for<br> Your hearts and for theirs.<br> Nor is it right for you</p>  
<p><a name="page_1125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1125</font></A></p>  
<p>That ye should annoy<br> God's Apostle, or that<br> Ye should marry his widows<br> After him at any time.<br> Truly such a thing is<br> In God's sight an enormity.</p>  
<p>54. Whether ye reveal anything<br> Or conceal it, verily<br> God has full knowledge<br> Of all things.</p>  
<p>55. There is no blame<br> (On these ladies if they<br> Appear) before their fathers<br> Or their sons, their brothers,<br> Or their brothers&#8217; sons,<br> Or their sisters&#8217; sons,<br> Or their women,<br> Or the (slaves) whom<br> Their right hands possess.<br> And, (ladies), fear God;<br> For God is Witness<br> To all things.</p>  
<p>56. God and His Angels<br> Send blessings on the Prophet:</p>  
<p><a name="page_1126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1126</font></A></p>  
<p>O ye that believe!<br> Send ye blessings on him,<br> And salute him<br> With all respect.</p>  
<p>57. Those who annoy<br> God and His Apostle&#8212;<br> God has cursed them<br> In this world and<br> In the Hereafter,<br> And has prepared for them<br> A humiliating Punishment.</p>  
<p>58. And those who annoy<br> Believing men and women<br> Undeservedly, bear<br> (on themselves)<br> A calumny and a glaring sin.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 8.</h5>  
<p>59. O Prophet! Tell<br> Thy wives and daughters,<br> And the believing women,<br> That they should cast<br> Their outer garments over<br> Their persons (when abroad):<br> That is most convenient,<br> That they should be known</p>  
<p><a name="page_1127"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1127</font></A></p>  
<p>(As such) and not molested.<br> And God is Oft-Forgiving,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
<p>60. Truly, if the Hypocrites,<br> And those in whose hearts<br> Is a disease, and those who<br> Stir up sedition in the City,<br> Desist not, We shall certainly<br> Stir thee up against them:<br> Then will they not be<br> Able to stay in it<br> As thy neighbours<br> For any length of time:</p>  
<p>61. They shall have a curse<br> On them: wherever they<br> Are found, they shall be<br> Seized and slain<br> (Without mercy).</p>  
<p>62. (Such was) the practice<br> (Approved) of God among those<br> Who lived aforetime:<br> No change wilt thou find<br> In the practice (approved)<br> Of God.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1128</font></A></p>  
<p>63. Men ask thee concerning<br> The Hour: say, "The knowledge<br> Thereof is with God (alone)":<br> And what will make thee<br> Understand?&#8212;perchance<br> The Hour is nigh!</p>  
<p>64. Verily God has cursed<br> The Unbelievers and prepared<br> For them a Blazing Fire,&#8212;</p>  
<p>65. To dwell therein for ever:<br> No protector will they find,<br> Nor helper.</p>  
<p>66. The Day that their faces<br> Will be turned upside down<br> In the Fire, they will say:<br> "Woe to us! would that<br> We had obeyed God<br> And obeyed the Apostle!"</p>  
<p>67. And they would say:<br> "Our Lord! We obeyed<br> Our chiefs and our great ones,<br> And they misled us<br> As to the (right) path.</p>  
<p>68. "Our Lord! Give them<br> Double Penalty<br> And curse them<br> With a very great Curse!"</p>  
<p><a name="page_1129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1129</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 9.</h5>  
<p>69. O ye who believe!<br> Be ye not like those<br> Who vexed and insulted Moses,<br> But God cleared him<br> Of the (calumnies) they<br> Had uttered: and he<br> Was honourable in God's sight.</p>  
<p>70. O ye who believe!<br> Fear God, and (always) say<br> A word directed to the Right:</p>  
<p>71. That He may make<br> Your conduct whole and sound<br> And forgive you your sins:<br> He that obeys God<br> And His Apostle, has already<br> Attained the highest<br> Achievement.</p>  
<p>72. We did indeed offer<br> The Trust to the Heavens</p>  
<p><a name="page_1130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1130</font></A></p>  
<p>And the Earth<br> And the Mountains;<br> But they refused<br> To undertake it,<br> Being afraid thereof:<br> But man undertook it;&#8212;<br> He was indeed unjust<br> And foolish;&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="page_1131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1131</font></A></p>  
<p>73. (With the result (that<br> God has to punish<br> The Hypocrites, men and women,<br> And the Unbelievers, men<br> And women, and God turns<br> In Mercy to the Believers,<br> Men and women: for God<br> Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
