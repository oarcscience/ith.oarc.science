### Sūra L.

### *Qāf.*

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Qāf.*

By the Glorious Qur-ān  
(Thou art God's Apostle).

2\. But they wonder that  
There has come to them  
A Warner from among  
Themselves.  
So the Unbelievers say:  
"This is a wonderful thing!

3\. "What! When we die  
And become dust, (shall we  
Live again?) That is  
A (sort of) Return  
Far (from our understanding)."

4\. We already know  
How much of them  
The earth takes away:  
With Us is a Record  
Guarding (the full account).

5\. But they deny the truth  
When it comes to them:  
So they are in  
A confused state.

<span id="page_1411">p. 1411</span>

6\. Do they not look  
At the sky above them?—  
How We have made it  
And adorned it,  
And there are no  
Flaws in it?

7\. And the earth—  
We have spread it out,  
And set thereon mountains  
Standing firm, and produced  
Therein every kind of  
Beautiful growth (in pairs)—

8\. To be observed  
And commemorated  
By every devotee  
Turning (to God).

9\. And We send down  
From the sky Rain  
Charged with blessing,  
And We produce therewith  
Gardens and Grain for harvests;

10\. And tall (and stately)  
Palm-trees, with shoots  
Of fruit-stalks, piled  
One over another;—

11, As sustenance for  
(God's) Servants;—  
And We give (new) life  
Therewith to land that is  
Dead: thus will be  
The Resurrection.

<span id="page_1412">p. 1412</span>

12\. Before them was denied  
(The Hereafter) by the People  
Of Noah, the Companions  
Of the Rass, the <u>Th</u>amūd,

13\. The ‘Ād, Pharaoh,  
The Brethren of Lūṭ,

14\. The Companions of the Wood,  
And the People of Tubba‘;  
Each one (of them) rejected  
The apostles, and My warning  
Was duly fulfilled (in them).

15\. Were We then weary  
With the first Creation,  
That they should be  
In confused doubt  
About a new Creation?

##### SECTION 2.

16\. It was We Who  
Created man, and We know  
What dark suggestions his soul  
Makes to him: for We  
Are nearer to him  
Than (his) jugular vein.

17\. Behold, two (guardian angels)  
Appointed to learn (his doings)  
Learn (and note them),  
One sitting on the right  
And one on the left.

<span id="page_1413">p. 1413</span>

18\. Not a word does he  
Utter but there is  
A sentinel by him,  
Ready (to note it).

19\. And the stupor of death  
Will bring truth (before  
His eyes): "This was  
The thing which thou  
Wast trying to escape!"

20\. And the Trumpet  
Shall be blown:  
That will be the Day  
Whereof Warning (had been given).

21\. And there will come forth  
Every soul: with each  
Will be an (angel) to drive,  
And an (angel) to  
Bear witness.

22\. (It will be said:)  
"Thou wast heedless  
Of this; now have We  
Removed thy veil,

<span id="page_1414">p. 1414</span>

And sharp is thy sight  
This Day!"

23\. And his Companion will say:  
"Here is (his Record) ready  
With me!"

24\. (The sentence will be:)  
"Throw, throw into Hell  
Every contumacious Rejecter  
(Of God)!—

25\. "Who forbade what was good,  
Transgressed all bounds,  
Cast doubts and suspicions;

26\. "Who set up another god  
Beside God: throw him  
Into a severe Penalty."

27\. His Companion will say:  
"Our Lord! I did not  
Make him transgress,  
But he was (himself)  
Far astray."

<span id="page_1415">p. 1415</span>

28\. He will say: "Dispute not  
With each other  
In My Presence:  
I had already in advance  
Sent you Warning.

29\. "The Word changes not  
Before Me, and I do not  
The least injustice  
To My Servants."

##### SECTION 3.

30\. One Day We will  
Ask Hell, "Art thou  
Filled to the full?"  
It will say, "Are there  
Any more (to come)?"

31\. And the Garden  
Will be brought nigh

<span id="page_1416">p. 1416</span>

To the Righteous,—no more  
A thing distant.

32\. (A voice will say:)  
"This is what was  
Promised for you,  
For every one who turned  
(To God) in sincere repentance,  
Who kept (His Law),

33\. "Who feared (God)  
Most Gracious unseen,  
And brought a heart  
Turned in devotion (to Him):

34\. "Enter ye therein  
In Peace and Security;  
This is a Day  
Of Eternal Life!"

35\. There will be for them  
Therein all that they wish,—  
And more besides  
In Our Presence,

36\. But how many  
Generations before them  
Did We destroy (for their  
Sins),—stronger in power  
Than they? Then did they  
Wander through the land:  
Was there any place  
Of escape (for them)?

<span id="page_1417">p. 1417</span>

37\. Verily in this  
Is a Message  
For any that has  
A heart and understanding  
Or who gives ear and  
Earnestly witnesses (the truth).

38\. We created the heavens  
And the earth and all  
Between them in Six Days,  
Nor did any sense  
Of weariness touch Us.

39\. Bear, then, with patience,  
All that they say,  
And celebrate the praises  
Of thy Lord, before  
The rising of the sun  
And before (its) setting,

40\. And during part  
Of the night, (also,)  
Celebrate His praises,  
And (so likewise)  
After the postures  
Of adoration.

<span id="page_1418">p. 1418</span>

41\. And listen for the Day  
When the Caller will call  
Out from a place  
Quite near,—

42\. The Day when they will  
Hear a (mighty) Blast  
In (very) truth: that  
Will be the Day  
Of Resurrection.

43\. Verily it is We Who  
Give Life and Death;  
And to Us is  
The Final Goal—

44\. The Day when  
The Earth will be  
Rent asunder, from (men)  
Hurrying out: that will be  
A gathering together,—  
Quite easy for Us.

45\. We know best what they  
Say; and thou art not  
One to overawe them  
By force. So admonish  
With the Qur-ān such  
As fear My Warning!
