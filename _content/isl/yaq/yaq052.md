### Sūra LII.

### *Ṭūr,* or the Mount.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. By the Mount (of Revelation);

2\. By a Decree Inscribed

3\. In a Scroll unfolded;

4\. By the much-frequented Fane;

5\. By the Canopy Raised High;

<span id="page_1433">p. 1433</span>

6\. And by the Ocean  
Filled with Swell;—

7\. Verily, the Doom of thy Lord  
Will indeed come to pass;—

8\. There is none  
Can avert it;—

9\. On the Day when  
The firmament will be  
In dreadful commotion.

10\. And the mountains will fly  
Hither and thither.

11\. Then woe that Day  
To those that treat  
(Truth) as Falsehood;—

<span id="page_1434">p. 1434</span>

12\. That play (and paddle)  
In shallow trifles.

13\. That Day shall they be  
Thrust down to the Fire  
Of Hell, irresistibly.

14\. "This", it will be said,  
"Is the Fire,—which ye  
Were wont to deny!

15\. "Is this then a fake,  
Or is it ye that  
Do not see?

16\. "Burn ye therein:  
The same is it to you  
Whether ye bear it  
With patience, or not:  
Ye but receive the recompense  
Of your (own) deeds."

17\. As to the Righteous,  
They will be in Gardens,  
And in Happiness,—

18\. Enjoying the (Bliss) which  
Their Lord hath bestowed  
On them, and their Lord  
Shall deliver them from  
The Penalty of the Fire.

<span id="page_1435">p. 1435</span>

19\. (To them will be said:)  
"Eat and drink ye,  
With profit and health,  
Because of your (good) deeds."

20\. They will recline (with ease)  
On Thrones (of dignity)  
Arranged in ranks;  
And We shall join them  
To Companions, with beautiful  
Big and lustrous eyes.

21\. And those who believe  
And whose families follow  
Them in Faith,— to them  
Shall We join their families:  
Nor shall We deprive them  
(Of the fruit) of aught  
Of their works:  
(Yet) is each individual  
In pledge for his deeds.

<span id="page_1436">p. 1436</span>

22\. And We shall bestow  
On them, of fruit and meat,  
Anything they shall desire.

23\. They shall there exchange,  
One with another,  
A (loving) cup  
Free of frivolity,  
Free of all taint  
Of ill.

24\. Round about them will serve,  
(Devoted) to them,  
Youths (handsome) as Pearls  
Well-guarded.

25\. They will advance  
To each other, engaging  
In mutual enquiry.

26\. They will say: "Aforetime,  
We were not without fear  
For the sake of our people.

<span id="page_1437">p. 1437</span>

27\. "But God has been good  
To us, and has delivered us  
From the Penalty  
Of the Scorching Wind.

28\. "Truly, we did call  
Unto Him from of old:  
Truly it is He,  
The Beneficent, the Merciful!

##### SECTION 2.

29\. Wherefore proclaim thou  
The praises (of thy Lord):  
For by the Grace  
Of thy Lord, thou art  
No (vulgar) soothsayer, nor  
Art thou one possessed.

30\. Or do they say:—  
"A Poet! we await  
For him some calamity  
(Hatched) by Time!"

31\. Say thou: "Await ye!—  
I too will wait  
Along with you!"

<span id="page_1438">p. 1438</span>

32\. Is it that their faculties  
Of understanding urge them  
To this, or are they  
But a people transgressing  
Beyond bounds?

33\. Or do they say,  
"He fabricated the (Message)"?  
Nay, they have no faith!

34\. Let them then produce  
A recital like unto it,—  
If (it be) they speak  
The Truth!

35\. Were they created of  
nothing,  
Or were they themselves  
The creators?

36\. Or did they create  
The heavens and the earth?  
Nay, they have  
No firm belief.

<span id="page_1439">p. 1439</span>

37\. Or are the Treasures  
Of thy Lord with them,  
Or are they the managers  
(Of affairs)?

38\. Or have they a ladder,  
By which they can (climb  
Up to heaven and) listen  
(To its secrets)? Then let  
(Such a) listener of theirs  
Produce a manifest proof.

39\. Or has He only daughters  
And ye have sons?

40\. Or is it that thou  
Dost ask for a reward,  
So that they are burdened  
With a load of debt?—

41\. Or that the Unseen  
Is in their hands,  
And they write it down?

42\. Or do they intend  
A plot (against thee)?  
But those who defy God  
Are themselves involved  
In a Plot!

<span id="page_1440">p. 1440</span>

43\. Or have they a god  
Other than God?  
Exalted is God  
Far above the things  
They associate with Him!

44\. Were they to see  
A piece of the sky  
Falling (on them), they  
Would (only) say: "Clouds  
Gathered in heaps!"

45\. So leave them alone  
Until they encounter  
That Day of theirs,  
Wherein they shall (perforce)  
Swoon (with terror),—

46\. The Day when their plotting  
Will avail them nothing  
And no help shall be  
Given them.

47\. And verily, for those  
Who do wrong, there is  
Another punishment besides this:  
But most of them  
Understand not.

48\. Now await in patience  
The command of thy Lord:

<span id="page_1441">p. 1441</span>

For verily thou art  
In Our eyes:  
And celebrate the praises  
Of thy Lord the while  
Thou standest forth,

49\. And for part of the night  
Also praise thou Him,—  
And at the retreat  
Of the stars!
