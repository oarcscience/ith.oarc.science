### Sūra LXXXIII.

### *Taṭfīf,* or Dealing in Fraud.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Woe to those  
That deal in fraud,—

2\. Those who, when they  
Have to receive by measure  
From men, exact full measure,

3\. But when they have  
To give by measure  
Or weight to men,  
Give less than due.

4\. Do they not think  
That they will be called  
To account?—

5\. On a Mighty Day,

6\. A Day when (all) mankind  
Will stand before  
The Lord of the Worlds?

7\. Nay! Surely the Record  
Of the Wicked is

<span id="page_1704">p. 1704</span>

(Preserved) in *Sijjīn.*

8\. And what will explain  
To thee what *Sijjīn* is?

9\. (There is) a Register  
(Fully) inscribed.

10\. Woe, that Day, to those  
That deny—

11\. Those that deny  
The Day of Judgment.

12\. And none can deny it  
But the Transgressor  
Beyond bounds,  
The Sinner!

13\. When Our Signs are rehearsed  
To him, he says,  
"Tales of the Ancients!"

14\. By no means!  
But on their hearts  
Is the stain of the (ill)  
Which they do!

<span id="page_1705">p. 1705</span>

15\. Verily, from (the Light  
Of) their Lord, that Day,  
Will they be veiled.

16\. Further, they will enter  
The Fire of Hell.

17\. Further, it will be said  
To them: "This is  
The (reality) which ye  
Rejected as false!

18\. Nay, verily the Record  
Of the Righteous is  
(Preserved) in *‘Illīyīn.*

19\. And what will explain  
To thee what *‘Illīyīn* is?

20\. (There is) a Register  
(Fully) inscribed,

21\. To which bear witness  
Those Nearest (to God),

22\. Truly the Righteous  
Will be in Bliss:

<span id="page_1706">p. 1706</span>

23\. On Thrones (of Dignity)  
Will they command a sight  
(Of all things):

24\. Thou wilt recognise  
In their Faces  
The beaming brightness of Bliss.

25\. Their thirst will be slaked  
With Pure Wine sealed:

26\. The seal thereof will be  
Musk: and for this  
Let those aspire,  
Who have aspirations:

27\. With it will be (given)  
A mixture of *Tasnīm*:

28\. A spring, from (the waters)  
Whereof drink  
Those Nearest to God.

29\. Those in sin used  
To laugh at those  
Who believed,

30\. And whenever they passed  
By them, used to wink  
At each other (in mockery);

<span id="page_1707">p. 1707</span>

31\. And when they returned  
To their own people,  
They would return jesting;

32\. And whenever they saw them,  
They would say, "Behold!  
These are the people  
Truly astray!"

33\. But they had not been  
Sent as Keepers over them!

34\. But on this Day  
The Believers will laugh  
At the Unbelievers:

35\. On Thrones (of Dignity)  
They will command (a sight)  
(Of all things),

36\. Will not the Unbelievers  
Have been paid back  
For what they did?
