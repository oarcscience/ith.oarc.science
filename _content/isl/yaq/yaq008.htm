<p><a name="page_415"><font size="1" color="green">p. 415</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&#363;ra VIII.</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Anf&#257;l, or the Spoils of War.</h3>  
<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
<p>1. They ask thee concerning<br> (Things taken as) spoils of war.<br> Say: "(Such) spoils are<br> At the disposal of God<br> And the Apostle: so fear<br> God, and keep straight<br> The relations between yourselves:<br> Obey God and His Apostle,<br> If ye do believe."</p>  
<p>2. For, Believers are those<br> Who, when God is mentioned,<br> Feel a tremor in their hearts,<br> And when they hear<br> His Signs rehearsed, find<br> Their faith strengthened,<br> And put (all) their trust<br> In their Lord;</p>  
<p>3. Who establish regular prayers<br> And spend (freely) out of<br> The gifts We have given<br> Them for sustenance:</p>  
<p>4. Such in truth are the Believers:<br> They have grades of dignity<br> With their Lord, and forgiveness,<br> And generous sustenance:</p>  
<p><a name="page_416"><font size="1" color="green">p. 416</font></A></p>  
<p>5. Just as thy Lord ordered thee<br> Out of thy house in truth,<br> Even though a party among<br> The Believers disliked it,</p>  
<p>6. Disputing with thee concerning<br> The truth after it was made<br> Manifest, as if they were<br> Being driven to death<br> And they (actually) saw it.</p>  
<p>7. Behold! God promised you<br> One of the two (enemy) parties,<br> That it should be yours:<br> Ye wished that the one<br> Unarmed should be yours,<br> But God willed<br> To justify the Truth<br> According to His words,<br> And to cut off the roots<br> Of the Unbelievers;&#8212;</p>  
<p>8. That He might justify Truth<br> And prove Falsehood false,<br> Distasteful though it be<br> To those in guilt.</p>  
<p><a name="page_417"><font size="1" color="green">p. 417</font></A></p>  
<p>9. Remember ye implored<br> The assistance of your Lord,<br> And He answered you:<br> "I will assist you<br> With a thousand of the angels,<br> Ranks on ranks."</p>  
<p>10. God made it but a message<br> Of hope, and an assurance<br> To your hearts: (in any case)<br> There is no help.<br> Except from God:<br> And God is Exalted in Power,<br> Wise.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>11. Remember He covered you<br> With a sort of drowsiness,<br> To give you calm as from<br> Himself, and he caused<br> Rain to descend on you<br> From heaven, to clean you<br> Therewith, to remove from you<br> The stain of Satan,<br> To strengthen your hearts,<br> And to plant your feet<br> Firmly therewith.</p>  
<p>12. Remember thy Lord inspired<br> The angels (with the message):<br> "I am with you: give<br> Firmness to the Believers:</p>  
<p><a name="page_418"><font size="1" color="green">p. 418</font></A></p>  
<p>I will instil terror<br> Into the hearts of the Unbelievers:<br> Smite ye above their necks<br> And smite all their<br> Finger-tips off them.</p>  
<p>13. This because they contended<br> Against God and His Apostle:<br> If any contend against God<br> And His Apostle, God<br> Is strict in punishment.</p>  
<p>14. Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye<br> Then of the (punishment):<br> For those who resist God,<br> Is the penalty of the Fire."</p>  
<p>15. O ye who believe!<br> When ye meet<br> The Unbelievers<br> In hostile array,<br> Never turn your backs<br> To them.</p>  
<p>16. If any do turn his back<br> To them on such a day&#8212;<br> Unless it be in a stratagem<br> Of war, or to retreat<br> To a troop (of his own)&#8212;<br> He draws on himself<br> The wrath of God,<br> And his abode is Hell,&#8212;<br> An evil refuge (indeed)!</p>  
<p>17. It is not ye who<br> Slew them; it was God:</p>  
<p><a name="page_419"><font size="1" color="green">p. 419</font></A></p>  
<p>When thou threwest (a handful<br> Of dust), it was not<br> Thy act, but God's:<br> In order that He might<br> Test the Believers<br> By a gracious trial<br> From Himself: for God<br> Is He Who heareth<br> And knoweth (all things).</p>  
<p>18. That, and also because<br> God is He Who makes feeble<br> The plans and stratagems<br> Of the Unbelievers.</p>  
<p>19. (O Unbelievers!) if ye prayed<br> For victory and judgment,<br> Now hath the judgment<br> Come to you: if ye desist<br> (From wrong), it will be<br> Best for you: if ye return<br> (To the attack), so shall We.<br> Not the least good<br> Will your forces be to you<br> Even if they were multiplied:<br> For verily God<br> Is with those who believe!</p>  
<p><a name="page_420"><font size="1" color="green">p. 420</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
<p>20. O ye who believe!<br> Obey God and His Apostle,<br> And turn not away from him<br> When ye hear (him speak).</p>  
<p>21. Nor be like those who say,<br> "We hear," but listen not:</p>  
<p>22. For the worst of beasts<br> In the sight of God<br> Are the deaf and the dumb,&#8212;<br> Those who understand not.</p>  
<p>23. If God had found in them<br> Any good, He would indeed<br> Have made them listen:<br> (As it is), if He had made them<br> Listen, they would but have<br> Turned back and declined (faith).</p>  
<p>24. O ye who believe!<br> Give your response to God<br> And His Apostle, when He<br> Calleth you to that which<br> Will give you life;<br> And know that God<br> Cometh in between a man<br> And his heart, and that<br> It is He to Whom<br> Ye shall (all) be gathered.</p>  
<p><a name="page_421"><font size="1" color="green">p. 421</font></A></p>  
<p>25. And fear tumult or oppression,<br> Which affecteth not in particular<br> (Only) those of you who do wrong:<br> And know that God<br> Is strict in punishment.</p>  
<p>26. Call to mind when ye<br> Were a small (band),<br> Despised through the land,<br> And afraid that men might<br> Despoil and kidnap you;<br> But He provided a safe asylum<br> For you, strengthened you<br> With His aid, and gave you<br> Good things for sustenance:<br> That ye might be grateful.</p>  
<p>27. O ye that believe!<br> Betray not the trust<br> Of God and the Apostle,<br> Nor misappropriate knowingly<br> Things entrusted to you.</p>  
<p>28. And know ye<br> That your possessions</p>  
<p><a name="page_422"><font size="1" color="green">p. 422</font></A></p>  
<p>And your progeny<br> Are but a trial;<br> And that it is God<br> With whom lies<br> Your highest reward.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4</h5>  
<p>29. O ye who believe!<br> If ye fear God,<br> He will grant you a Criterion<br> (To judge between right and wrong),<br> Remove from you (all) evil<br> (That may afflict) you,<br> And forgive you:<br> For God is the Lord<br> Of grace unbounded.</p>  
<p>30. Remember how the Unbelievers<br> Plotted against thee, to keep<br> Thee in bonds, or slay thee,<br> Or get thee out (of thy home).<br> They plot and plan,<br> And God too plans,<br> But the best of planners<br> Is God.</p>  
<p>31. When Our Signs are rehearsed<br> To them, they say: "We<br> Have heard this (before):<br> If we wished, we could<br> Say (words) like these:<br> These are nothing<br> But tales of the ancients."</p>  
<p><a name="page_423"><font size="1" color="green">p. 423</font></A></p>  
<p>32. Remember how they said:<br> "O God! if this is indeed<br> The Truth from Thee,<br> Rain down on as a shower<br> Of stones from the sky,<br> Or send us a grievous Penalty.</p>  
<p>33. But God was not going<br> To send them a Penalty<br> Whilst thou wast amongst them;<br> Nor was He going to send it<br> Whilst they could ask for pardon</p>  
<p>34. But what plea have they<br> That God should not punish<br> Them, when they keep out<br> (Men) from the Sacred Mosque&#8212;<br> And they are not its guardians?<br> No men can be its guardians<br> Except the righteous; but most<br> Of them do not understand.</p>  
<p>35. Their prayer at the House<br> (Of God) is nothing but<br> Whistling and clapping of hands:<br> (Its only answer can be),<br> "Taste ye the Penalty<br> Because ye blasphemed."</p>  
<p>36. The Unbelievers spend their wealth<br> To hinder (men) from the path<br> Of God, and so will they<br> Continue to spend; but<br> In the end they will have<br> (Only) regrets and sighs;</p>  
<p><a name="page_424"><font size="1" color="green">p. 424</font></A></p>  
<p>At length they will be overcome:<br> And the Unbelievers will be<br> Gathered together to Hell;&#8212;</p>  
<p>37. In order that God may separate<br> The impure from the pure,<br> Put the impure, one on another,<br> Heap them together, and cast them<br> Into Hell. They will be<br> The ones to have lost.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
<p>38. Say to the Unbelievers,<br> If (now) they desist (from Unbelief),<br> Their past would be forgiven them;<br> But if they persist, the punishment<br> Of those before them is already<br> (A matter of warning for them).</p>  
<p>39. And fight them on<br> Until there is no <A HREF="errata.htm#2">more</A><br> Tumult or oppression,<br> And there prevail<br> Justice and faith in God<br> Altogether and everywhere;<br> But if they cease, verily God<br> Doth see all that they do.</p>  
<p>40. If they refuse, be sure<br> That God is your Protector&#8212;<br> The Best to protect<br> And the Best to help.</p>  
<p><a name="page_425"><font size="1" color="green">p. 425</font></A></p>  
<p>41. And know that out of<br> All the booty that ye<br> May acquire (in war),<br> A fifth share is assigned<br> To God,&#8212;and to the Apostle,<br> And to near relatives,<br> Orphans, the needy,<br> And the wayfarer,<br> If ye do believe in God<br> And in the revelation<br> We sent down to Our Servant<br> On the Day of Testing,&#8212;<br> The Day of the meeting<br> Of the two forces.<br> For God hath power<br> Over all things.</p>  
<p>42. Remember ye were<br> On the hither side<br> Of the valley, and they<br> On the farther side,<br> And the caravan<br> On lower ground than ye.<br> Even if ye had made<br> A mutual appointment<br> To meet, ye would certainly:<br> Have failed in the appointment:</p>  
<p><a name="page_426"><font size="1" color="green">p. 426</font></A></p>  
<p>But (thus ye met),<br> That God might accomplish<br> A matter already enacted;<br> That those who died might<br> Die after a clear Sign<br> (Had been given), and those who lived<br> Might live after a Clear Sign<br> (Had been given). And verily<br> God is He who heareth<br> And knoweth (all things).</p>  
<p>43. Remember in thy dream<br> God showed them to thee<br> As few: if He had shown<br> Them to thee as many,<br> Ye would surely have been<br> Discouraged, and ye would<br> Surely have disputed<br> In (your) decision: but God<br> Saved (you): for He knoweth<br> Well the (secrets) of (all) hearts.</p>  
<p>44. And remember when ye met,<br> He showed them to you<br> As few in your eyes,<br> And He made you appear<br> As contemptible in their eyes:<br> That God might accomplish<br> A matter already enacted.<br> For to God do all questions<br> Go back (for decision).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
<p>45. O ye who believe!<br> When ye meet a force,<br> Be firm, and call God<br> In remembrance much (and often);<br> That ye may prosper:</p>  
<p>46. And obey God and His Apostle;<br> And fall into no disputes,</p>  
<p><a name="page_427"><font size="1" color="green">p. 427</font></A></p>  
<p>Lest ye lose heart<br> And your power depart;<br> And be patient and persevering:<br> For God is with those<br> Who patiently persevere:</p>  
<p>47. And be not like those<br> Who started from their homes<br> Insolently and to be seen of men,<br> And to hinder (men)<br> From the path of God:<br> For God compasseth round about<br> All that they do.</p>  
<p>48. Remember Satan made<br> Their (sinful) acts seem<br> Alluring to them, and said:<br> "No one among men<br> Can overcome you this day,<br> While I am near to you":<br> But when the two forces<br> Came in sight of each other,<br> He turned on his heels,<br> And said: "Lo! I am clear<br> Of you; to! I see<br> What ye see not;<br> Lo! I fear God; for God<br> Is strict in punishment.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 7.</h5>  
<p>49. Lo! the Hypocrites say, and those<br> In whose hearts is a disease:<br> "These people,&#8212;their religion<br> Has misled them." But<br> If any trust in God, behold!<br> God is Exalted in might, Wise.</p>  
<p><a name="page_428"><font size="1" color="green">p. 428</font></A></p>  
<p>50. If thou couldst see,<br> When the angels take the souls<br> Of the Unbelievers (at death),<br> (How) they smite their faces<br> And their backs, (saying):<br> "Taste the Penalty of the blazing Fire&#8212;</p>  
<p>51. "Because of (the deeds) which<br> Your (own) hands sent forth:<br> For God is never unjust<br> To His servants:</p>  
<p>52. "(Deeds) after the manner<br> Of the People of Pharaoh<br> And of those before them:<br> They rejected the Signs of God,<br> And God punished them<br> For their crimes: for God<br> Is Strong, and Strict in punishment:</p>  
<p>53. "Because God will never change<br> The Grace which He hath bestowed<br> On a people until they change<br> What is in their (own) souls:<br> And verily God is He<br> Who heareth and knoweth (all things)."</p>  
<p>54. "(Deeds) after the manner<br> Of the People of Pharaoh<br> And those before them":<br> They treated as false the Signs<br> Of their Lord: so We</p>  
<p><a name="page_429"><font size="1" color="green">p. 429</font></A></p>  
<p>Destroyed them for their crimes,<br> And We drowned the People<br> Of Pharaoh: for they were all<br> Oppressors and wrong-doers.</p>  
<p>55. For the worst of beasts<br> In the sight of God<br> Are those who reject Him:<br> They will not believe.</p>  
<p>56. They are those with whom<br> Thou didst make a covenant,<br> But they break their covenant<br> Every time, and they have not<br> The fear (of God).</p>  
<p>57. If ye gain the mastery<br> Over them in war,<br> Disperse, with them, those<br> Who follow them,<br> That they may remember.</p>  
<p>58. If thou fearest treachery<br> From any group, throw back<br> (Their Covenant) to them, (so as<br> To be) on equal terms:<br> For God loveth not the treacherous.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 8.</h5>  
<p>59. Let not the Unbelievers<br> Think that they can<br> Get the better (of the godly):<br> They will never frustrate (them).</p>  
<p><a name="page_430"><font size="1" color="green">p. 430</font></A></p>  
<p>60. Against them make ready<br> Your strength to the utmost<br> Of your power, including<br> Steeds of war, to strike terror<br> Into (the hearts of) the enemies,<br> Of God and your enemies,<br> And others besides, whom<br> Ye may not know, but whom<br> God doth know. Whatever<br> Ye shall spend in the Cause<br> Of God, shall be repaid<br> Unto you, and ye shall not<br> Be treated unjustly.</p>  
<p>61. But if the enemy<br> Incline towards peace,<br> Do thou (also) incline<br> Towards peace, and trust<br> In God: for He is the One<br> That heareth and knoweth<br> (All things).</p>  
<p>62. Should they intend<br> To deceive thee,&#8212;verily God<br> Sufficeth thee: He it is<br> That hath strengthened thee<br> With his aid and<br> With (the company of)<br> The Believers;</p>  
<p>63. And (moreover) He hath put<br> Affection between their hearts:</p>  
<p><a name="page_431"><font size="1" color="green">p. 431</font></A></p>  
<p>Not if thou hadst spent<br> All that is in the earth,<br> Couldst thou have produced<br> That affection, but God<br> Hath done it: for He<br> Is Exalted in might, Wise.</p>  
<p>64. O Apostle! Sufficient<br> Unto thee is God,&#8212;<br> (Unto thee) and unto those<br> Who follow thee<br> Among the Believers.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 9.</h5>  
<p>65. O Apostle! rouse the Believers<br> To the fight. If there are<br> Twenty amongst you, patient<br> And persevering, they will<br> Vanquish two hundred: if a hundred,<br> They will vanquish a thousand<br> Of the Unbelievers: for these<br> Are a people without understanding.</p>  
<p><a name="page_432"><font size="1" color="green">p. 432</font></A></p>  
<p>66. For the present, God<br> Hath lightened your (task),<br> For He knoweth that there is<br> A weak spot in you:<br> But (even so), if there are<br> A hundred of you, patient<br> And persevering, they will<br> Vanquish two hundred, and if<br> A thousand, they will vanquish<br> Two thousand, with the leave<br> Of God: for God is with those<br> Who patiently persevere.</p>  
<p>67. It is not fitting<br> For an Apostle<br> That he should have<br> Prisoners of war until<br> He hath thoroughly subdued<br> The land. Ye look<br> For the temporal goods<br> Of this world; but God<br> Looketh to the Hereafter:<br> And God is Exalted in might, Wise.</p>  
<p>68. Had it not been for<br> A previous ordainment</p>  
<p><a name="page_433"><font size="1" color="green">p. 433</font></A></p>  
<p>From God, a severe penalty<br> Would have reached you<br> For the (ransom) that ye took.</p>  
<p>69. But (now) enjoy what ye took<br> In war, lawful and good:<br> But fear God: for God<br> Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 10.</h5>  
<p>70, O Apostle! say to those<br> Who are captives in your hands:<br> "If God findeth any good<br> In your hearts, He will<br> Give you something better<br> Than what has been taken<br> From you, and He will<br> Forgive you: for God<br> Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful."</p>  
<p>71. But if they have<br> Treacherous designs against thee,<br> (O Apostle!), they have already<br> Been in treason against God,<br> And so hath He given<br> (Thee) power over them.<br> And God is He who hath<br> (Full) knowledge and wisdom.</p>  
<p>72. Those who believed,<br> And adopted exile,</p>  
<p><a name="page_434"><font size="1" color="green">p. 434</font></A></p>  
<p>And fought for the Faith,<br> With their property<br> And their persons,<br> In the cause of God,<br> As well as those<br> Who gave (them) asylum<br> And aid,&#8212;these are (all)<br> Friends and protectors,<br> One of another.<br> As to those who believed<br> But came not into exile,<br> Ye owe no duty<br> Of protection to them<br> Until they come into exile;<br> But if they seek<br> Your aid in religion,<br> It is your duty<br> To help them,<br> Except against a people<br> With whom ye have<br> A treaty of mutual alliance.<br> And (remember) God<br> Seeth all that ye do.</p>  
<p>73. The Unbelievers are<br> Protectors, one of another:<br> Unless ye do this,<br> (Protect each other),<br> There would be<br> Tumult and oppression<br> On earth, and great mischief.</p>  
<p><a name="page_435"><font size="1" color="green">p. 435</font></A></p>  
<p>74. Those who believe,<br> And adopt exile,<br> And tight for the Faith,<br> In the cause of God,<br> As well as those<br> Who give (them) asylum<br> And aid,&#8212;these are (all)<br> In very truth the Believers:<br> For them is the forgiveness<br> Of sins and a provision<br> Most generous.</p>  
<p>75. And those who<br> Accept Faith subsequently,<br> And adopt exile,<br> And fight for the Faith<br> In your company,<br> They are of you.<br> But kindred by blood<br> Have prior rights<br> Against each other<br> In the Book of God.<br> Verily God is well-acquainted<br> With all things.</p>
