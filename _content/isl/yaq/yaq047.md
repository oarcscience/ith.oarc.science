### Sūra XLVII.

### *Muḥammad* (the Prophet).

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Those who reject God  
And hinder (men) from  
The Path of God,  
Their deeds will God  
Render astray  
(From their mark).

2\. But those who believe  
And work deeds of  
Righteousness, and believe  
In the (Revelation) sent down  
To Muhammad—for it is  
The Truth from their Lord,  
He will remove from them  
Their ills and improve  
Their condition.

3\. This because those who  
Reject God follow vanities,  
While those who believe follow  
The Truth from their Lord:  
Thus does God set forth  
For men their lessons  
By similitudes.

4\. Therefore, when ye meet  
The Unbelievers (in fight),

<span id="page_1379">p. 1379</span>

Smite at their necks;  
At length, when ye have  
Thoroughly subdued them,  
Bind a bond  
Firmly (on them): thereafter  
(Is the time for) either  
Generosity or ransom:  
Until the war lays down  
Its burdens. Thus (are ye  
Commanded): but if it  
Had been God's Will,  
He could certainly have exacted  
Retribution from them (Himself);  
But (He lets you fight)  
In order to test you,  
Some with others.  
But those who are slain  
In the way of God,  
He will never let  
Their deeds be lost.

5\. Soon will He guide them  
And improve their condition,

6\. And admit them to  
The Garden which He  
Has announced for them.

<span id="page_1380">p. 1380</span>

7\. O ye who believe!  
If ye will aid  
(The cause of) God,  
He will aid you,  
And plant your feet firmly.

8\. But those who reject (God),  
For them is destruction,  
And (God) will render  
Their deeds astray  
(From their mark).

9\. That is because they  
Hate the Revelation of God;  
So He has made  
Their deeds fruitless.

10\. Do they not travel  
Through the earth, and see  
What was the End  
Of those before them  
(Who did evil)?  
God brought utter destruction  
On them, and similar  
(Fates await) those who  
Reject God.

11\. That is because God  
Is the Protector of those  
Who believe, but  
Those who reject God  
Have no protector.

##### SECTION 2.

12\. Verily God will admit  
Those who believe and do  
Righteous deeds, to Gardens  
Beneath which rivers flow;

<span id="page_1381">p. 1381</span>

While those who reject God  
Will enjoy (this world)  
And eat as cattle eat;  
And the Fire will  
Be their abode.

13\. And how many cities,  
With more power than  
Thy city which has  
Driven thee out,  
Have We destroyed  
(For their sins)?  
And there was none  
To aid them.

14\. Is then one who is  
On a clear (Path)  
From his Lord,  
No better than one  
To whom the evil  
Of his conduct seems pleasing,  
And such as follow  
Their own lusts?

15\. (Here is) a Parable  
Of the Garden which  
The righteous are promised:  
In it are rivers  
Of water incorruptible;  
Rivers of milk  
Of which the taste  
Never changes; rivers

<span id="page_1382">p. 1382</span>

Of wine, a joy  
To those who drink;  
And rivers of honey  
Pure and clear. In it  
There are for them  
All kinds of fruits;  
And Grace from their Lord.  
(Can those in such Bliss)  
Be compared to such as  
Shall dwell for ever  
In the Fire, and be given,  
To drink, boiling water,  
So that it cuts up  
Their bowels (to pieces)?

16\. And among them are men  
Who listen to thee,  
But in the end, when they  
Go out from thee,  
They say to those who  
Have received Knowledge,  
"What is it he said  
Just then?" Such are  
Men whose hearts God  
Has sealed, and who  
Follow their own lusts.

17\. But to those who receive  
Guidance, He increases  
The (light of) Guidance,  
And bestows on them  
Their Piety and Restraint  
(From evil).

<span id="page_1383">p. 1383</span>

18\. Do they then only wait  
For the Hour,—that it  
Should come on them  
Of a sudden? But already  
Have come some tokens  
Thereof, and when it  
(Actually) is on them,  
How can they benefit  
Then by their admonition?

19\. Know, therefore, that  
There is no god  
But God, and ask  
Forgiveness for thy fault,  
And for the men  
And women who believe:  
For God knows how ye  
Move about and how  
Ye dwell in your homes.

<span id="page_1384">p. 1384</span>

##### SECTION 3.

20\. Those who believe say,  
"Why is not a Sūra  
Sent down (for us)?"  
But when a Sūra  
Of basic or categorical  
Meaning is revealed,  
And fighting is mentioned  
Therein, thou wilt see those  
In whose hearts is a disease  
Looking at thee with a look  
Of one in swoon at  
The approach of death.  
But more fitting for them—

21\. Were it to obey  
And say what is just,  
And when a matter  
Is resolved on, it were  
Best for them if they  
Were true to God.

22\. Then, is it  
To be expected of you,  
If ye were put in authority,  
That ye will do mischief  
In the land, and break  
Your ties of kith and kin?

<span id="page_1385">p. 1385</span>

23, Such are the men  
Whom God has cursed  
For He has made them  
Deaf and blinded their sight.

24\. Do they not then  
Earnestly seek to understand  
The Qur-ān, or are  
Their hearts locked up  
By them?

25\. Those who turn back  
As apostates after Guidance  
Was clearly shown to them,—  
The Evil One has instigated  
Them and buoyed them up  
With false hopes.

26\. This, because they said  
To those who hate what  
God has revealed, "We  
Will obey you in part  
Of (this) matter"; but God  
Knows their (inner) secrets.

27\. But how (will it be)  
When the angels take  
Their souls at death,  
And smite their faces  
And their backs?

<span id="page_1386">p. 1386</span>

28\. This because they followed  
That which called forth  
The Wrath of God, and  
They hated God's good pleasure;  
So He made their deeds  
Of no effect.

##### SECTION 4.

29\. Or do those in whose  
Hearts is a disease, think  
That God will not bring  
To light all their rancour?

30\. Had We so willed,  
We could have shown them  
Up to thee, and thou  
Shouldst have known them  
By their marks: but surely  
Thou wilt know them  
By the tone of their speech!  
And God knows  
All that ye do.

31\. And We shall try you  
Until We test those  
Among you who strive  
Their utmost and persevere  
In patience; and We shall  
Try your reported (mettle).

32\. Those who reject God,  
Hinder (men) from  
The Path of God, and resist  
The Apostle, after Guidance

<span id="page_1387">p. 1387</span>

Has been clearly shown to them,  
Will not injure God  
In the least, but He  
Will make their deeds  
Of no effect.

33\. O ye who believe!  
Obey God, and obey  
The Apostle, and make  
Not vain your deeds!

34\. Those who reject God,  
And hinder (men) from the Path  
Of God, then die rejecting God,—  
God will not forgive them.

35\. Be not weary and  
Faint-hearted, crying for peace,  
When ye should be  
Uppermost: for God is  
With you, and will never  
Put you in loss  
For your (good) deeds.

36\. The life of this world  
Is but play and amusement:  
And if ye believe  
And guard against evil,  
He will grant you  
Your recompense, and will not

<span id="page_1388">p. 1388</span>

Ask you (to give up)  
Your possessions.

37\. If He were to ask you  
For all of them, and  
Press you, ye would  
Covetously withhold, and He would  
Bring out all your ill-feeling.

38\. Behold, ye are those  
Invited to spend  
(Of your substance)  
In the Way of God:  
But among you are some  
That are niggardly. But any  
Who are niggardly are so  
At the expense of  
Their own souls.  
But God is free  
Of all wants,  
And it is ye that are needy.  
If ye turn back  
(From the Path), He will  
Substitute in your stead  
Another people; then they  
Would not be like you!
