### Sara LXXIX.

### *Nāzi’āt,* or Those Who Tear Out.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*

1\. By the (angels)  
Who tear out  
(The souls of the wicked)  
With violence;

2\. By those who gently  
Draw out (the souls  
Of the blessed);

3\. And by those who glide  
Along (on errands of mercy),

4\. Then press forward  
As in a race,

5\. Then arrange to do  
(The Commands of their Lord),—

<span id="page_1680">p. 1680</span>

6\. One Day everything that  
Can be in commotion will  
Be in violent commotion,

7\. Followed by oft-repeated  
(Commotions):

8\. Hearts that Day  
Will be in agitation;

9\. Cast down will be  
(Their owners’) eyes.

10\. They say (now): "What!  
Shall we indeed be  
Returned to (our) former state?—

11\. "What!—when we shall  
Have become rotten bones?"

12\. They say: "It would  
In that case, be  
A return with loss!"

13\. But verily, it will  
Be but a single

<span id="page_1681">p. 1681</span>

(Compelling) Cry,

14\. When, behold, they  
Will be in the (full)  
Awakening (to Judgment).

15\. Has the story  
Of Moses reached thee?

16\. Behold, thy Lord did call  
To him in the sacred valley  
Of Ṭuwā:—

17\. "Go thou to Pharaoh,  
For he has indeed  
Transgressed all bounds:

18\. "And say to him,  
"Wouldst thou that thou  
Shouldst he purified  
(From sin)?—

19\. "And that I guide thee  
To thy Lord, so thou  
Shouldst fear Him?"

<span id="page_1682">p. 1682</span>

20\. Then did (Moses) show him  
The Great Sign.

21\. But (Pharaoh) rejected it  
And disobeyed (guidance);

22\. Further, he turned his back,  
Striving hard (against God).

23\. Then he collected (his men)  
And made a proclamation,

24\. Saying, "I am your Lord,  
Most High".

25\. But God did punish him,  
(And made an) example  
Of him,—in the Hereafter,  
As in this life.

26\. Verily in this is  
An instructive warning  
For whosoever feareth (God).

##### SECTION 2.

27\. What! Are ye the more  
Difficult to create  
Or the heaven (above)?  
(God) hath constructed it:

<span id="page_1683">p. 1683</span>

28\. On high hath He raised  
Its canopy, and He hath  
Given it order and perfection.

29\. Its night doth He  
Endow with darkness,  
And its splendour doth He  
Bring out (with light).

30\. And the earth, moreover,  
Hath He extended  
(To a wide expanse);

31\. He draweth out  
Therefrom its moisture  
And its pasture;

32\. And the mountains  
Hath He firmly fixed;

33\. For use and convenience  
To you and your cattle.

<span id="page_1684">p. 1684</span>

34\. Therefore, when there comes  
The great, overwhelming (Event),—

35\. The Day when Man  
Shall remember (all)  
That he strove for,

36\. And Hell-Fire shall be  
Placed in full view  
For (all) to see,—

37\. Then, for such as had  
Transgressed all bounds,

38\. And had preferred  
The life of this world,

39\. The Abode will be  
Hell-Fire;

40\. And for such as had  
Entertained the fear  
Of standing before  
Their Lord's (tribunal)  
And had restrained  
(Their) soul from lower Desires,

41\. Their Abode will be  
The Garden.

<span id="page_1685">p. 1685</span>

42\. They ask thee  
About the Hour,—"When  
Will be its appointed time?"

43\. Wherein art thou (concerned)  
With the declaration thereof?

44\. With thy Lord is  
The Limit fixed therefor.

45\. Thou art but a Warner  
For such as fear it.

46\. The Day they see it,  
(It will be) as if they  
Had tarried but a single  
Evening, or (at most till)  
The following morn!
