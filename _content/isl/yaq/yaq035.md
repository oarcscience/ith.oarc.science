### Sūra XXXV.

### *Fāṭir,* or The Originator of Creation; or *Malāïka*, or The Angels.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Praise be to God,  
Who created (out of nothing)  
The heavens and the earth,  
Who made the angels  
Messengers with wings,—  
Two, or three, or four (Pairs):  
He adds to Creation  
As He pleases: for God  
Has power over all things.

2\. What God out of His Mercy  
Doth bestow on mankind  
There is none can withhold:  
What He doth withhold,

<span id="page_1153">p. 1153</span>

There is none can grant,  
Apart from Him:  
And He is the Exalted  
In Power, Full of Wisdom.

3\. O men! call to mind  
The grace of God unto you!  
Is there a Creator, other  
Than God, to give you  
Sustenance from heaven  
Or earth? There is  
No god but He: how  
Then are ye deluded  
Away from the Truth?

4\. And if they reject thee,  
So were apostles rejected  
Before thee: to God  
Go back for decision  
All affairs.

5\. O men! certainly  
The promise of God  
Is true. Let not then  
This present life deceive you,

<span id="page_1154">p. 1154</span>

Nor let the Chief Deceiver  
Deceive you about God.

6\. Verily Satan is an enemy  
To you: so treat him  
As an enemy. He only  
Invites his adherents,  
That they may become  
Companions of the Blazing Fire.

7\. For those who reject God,  
Is a terrible Penalty: but  
For those who believe  
And work righteous deeds,  
Is Forgiveness, and  
A magnificent Reward.

##### SECTION 2.

8\. Is he, then, to whom  
The evil of his conduct  
Is made alluring, so  
That he looks upon it  
As good, (equal to one  
Who is rightly guided)?  
For God leaves to stray  
Whom He wills, and guides  
Whom He wills. So  
Let not thy soul go out  
In (vainly) sighing after them:  
For God knows well  
All that they do!

9\. It is God Who sends  
Forth the Winds, so that

<span id="page_1155">p. 1155</span>

They raise up the Clouds,  
And We drive them  
To a land that is dead,  
And revive the earth therewith  
After its death: even so  
(Will be) the Resurrection!

10\. If any do seek  
For glory and power,—  
To God belong  
All glory and power.  
To Him mount up  
(All) Words of Purity:  
It is He Who exalts  
Each Deed of Righteousness.  
Those that lay Plots  
Of Evil,—for them  
Is a Penalty terrible;  
And the plotting of such  
Will be void (of result).

11\. And God did create  
You from dust;  
Then from a sperm-drop;  
Then He made you  
In pairs. And no female  
Conceives, or lays down  
(Her load), but with His  
Knowledge. Nor is a man

<span id="page_1156">p. 1156</span>

Long-lived granted length  
Of days, nor is a part  
Cut off from his life,  
But is in a Decree  
(Ordained). All this  
Is easy to God.

12\. Nor are the two bodies  
Of flowing water alike,—  
The one palatable, sweet,  
And pleasant to drink,  
And the other, salt  
And bitter. Yet from each  
(Kind of water) do ye  
Eat flesh fresh and tender,  
And ye extract ornaments  
To wear; and thou seest  
The ships therein that plough  
The waves, that ye may  
Seek (thus) of the Bounty  
Of God that ye  
May be grateful.

13\. He merges Night into Day,  
And He merges Day

<span id="page_1157">p. 1157</span>

Into Night, and He has  
Subjected the sun and  
The moon (to His Law):  
Each one runs its course  
For a term appointed.  
Such is God your Lord:  
To Him belongs all Dominion.  
And those whom ye invoke  
Besides Him have not  
The least power.

14\. If ye invoke them,  
They will not listen  
To your call, and if  
They were to listen,  
They cannot answer  
Your (prayer). On the Day  
Of Judgment they will reject  
Your "Partnership". And none,  
(O man!) can tell thee  
(The Truth) like the One  
Who is acquainted with all things.

##### SECTION 3.

15\. O ye men! It is  
Ye that have need

<span id="page_1158">p. 1158</span>

Of God: but God is  
The One Free of all wants,  
Worthy of all praise.

16\. If He so pleased, He  
Could blot you out  
And bring in  
A New Creation.

17\. Nor is that (at all)  
Difficult for God.

18\. Nor can a bearer of burdens  
Bear another's burden.  
If one heavily laden should  
Call another to (bear) his load,  
Not the least portion of it  
Can be carried (by the other),  
Even though he be nearly  
Related. Thou canst but  
Admonish such as fear  
Their Lord unseen  
And establish regular Prayer.  
And whoever purifies himself

<span id="page_1159">p. 1159</span>

Does so for the benefit  
Of his own soul; and  
The destination (of all)  
Is to God.

19\. The blind and the seeing  
Are not alike;

20\. Nor are the depths  
Of Darkness and the Light;

21\. Nor are the (chilly) shade  
And the (genial) heat of the sun:

22\. Nor are alike those  
That are living and those  
That are dead. God can  
Make any that He wills  
To hear; but thou  
Canst not make those  
To hear who are  
(Buried) in graves.

23\. Thou art no other  
Than a warner.

24\. Verily We have sent thee  
In truth, as a bearer  
Of glad tidings,  
And as a warner:

<span id="page_1160">p. 1160</span>

And there never was  
A people, without a warner  
Having lived among them  
(In the past).

25\. And if they reject thee,  
So did their predecessors,  
To whom came their apostles  
With Clear Signs, Books  
Of dark prophecies,  
And the Book  
Of Enlightenment.

26\. In the end did I  
Punish those who rejected  
Faith: and how (terrible)  
Was My rejection (of them)!

##### SECTION 4.

27\. Seest thou not that  
God sends down rain  
From the sky? With it  
We then bring out produce  
Of various colours  
And in the mountains

<span id="page_1161">p. 1161</span>

Are tracts white and red,  
Of various shades of colour,  
And black intense in hue.

28\. And so amongst men  
And crawling creatures and cattle,  
Are they of various colours.  
Those truly fear God,  
Among His Servants,  
Who have knowledge:  
For God is Exalted in Might,  
Oft-Forgiving.

29\. Those who rehearse the Book  
Of God, establish regular Prayer,  
And spend (in Charity)  
Out of what We have provided  
For them, secretly and openly,  
Hope for a Commerce  
That will never fail:

<span id="page_1162">p. 1162</span>

30\. For He will pay them  
Their meed, nay, He will  
Give them (even) more  
Out of His Bounty:  
For He is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Ready to appreciate (service).

31\. That which We have revealed  
To thee of the Book  
Is the Truth,—confirming  
What was (revealed) before it:  
For God is assuredly—  
With respect to His servants—  
Well acquainted and  
Fully Observant.

32\. Then We have given  
The Book for inheritance  
To such of Our servants  
As We have chosen:  
But there are among them  
Some who wrong their own

<span id="page_1163">p. 1163</span>

Souls; some who follow  
A middle course; and some  
Who are, by God's leave,  
Foremost in good deeds;  
That is the highest Grace.

33\. Gardens of Eternity will they  
Enter: therein will they  
Be adorned with bracelets  
Of gold and pearls;  
And their garments there  
Will be of silk.

34\. And they will say:  
"Praise be to God,  
Who has removed from us  
(All) sorrow: for our Lord  
Is indeed Oft-Forgiving  
Ready to appreciate (service):

35\. "Who has, out of His Bounty,  
Settled us in a Home  
That will last: no toil  
Nor sense of weariness  
Shall touch us therein."

36\. But those who reject (God)—  
For them will be  
The Fire of Hell:  
No term shall be determined

<span id="page_1164">p. 1164</span>

For them, so they should die,  
Nor shall its Penalty  
Be lightened for them.  
Thus do We reward  
Every ungrateful one!

37\. Therein will they cry  
Aloud (for assistance):  
"Our Lord! Bring us out:  
We shall work righteousness,  
Not the (deeds) we used  
To do"—"Did We not  
Give you long enough life  
So that he that would  
Should receive admonition?  
And (moreover) the warner  
Came to you. So taste ye  
(The fruits of your deeds):  
For the Wrong-doers  
There is no helper."

##### SECTION 5.

38\. Verily God knows  
(All) the hidden things  
Of the heavens and the earth:  
Verily He has full knowledge  
Of all that is  
In (men's) hearts.

39\. He it is that has made  
You inheritors in the earth:

<span id="page_1165">p. 1165</span>

If, then, any do reject  
(God), their rejection (works)  
Against themselves: their rejection  
But adds to the odium  
For the Unbelievers  
In the sight of their Lord:  
Their rejection but adds  
To (their own) undoing.

40\. Say: "Have ye seen  
(These) "Partners" of yours  
Whom ye call upon  
Besides God? Show me  
What it is they have created  
In the (wide) earth.  
Or have they a share  
In the heavens? Or  
Have We given them a Book  
From which they (can derive)  
Clear (evidence)?—Nay,  
The wrong-doers promise  
Each other nothing but delusions.

41\. It is God Who sustains  
The heavens and the earth,  
Lest they cease (to function):  
And if they should fail,  
There is none—not one—  
Can sustain them thereafter:

<span id="page_1166">p. 1166</span>

Verily He is Most Forbearing,  
Oft-Forgiving.

42\. They swore their strongest oaths  
By God that if a warner  
Came to them, they would  
Follow his guidance better  
Than any (other) of the Peoples:  
But when a warner came  
To them, it has only  
Increased their flight  
(From righteousness),—

43\. On account of their arrogance  
In the land and their  
Plotting of Evil.  
But the plotting of Evil  
Will hem in only  
The authors thereof. Now  
Are they but looking for  
The way the ancients  
Were dealt with? But  
No change wilt thou find  
In God's way (of dealing):  
No turning off wilt thou  
Find in God's way (of dealing).

<span id="page_1167">p. 1167</span>

44\. Do they not travel  
Through the earth, and see.  
What was the End  
Of those before them,  
Though they were superior  
To them in strength?  
Nor is God to be frustrated  
By anything whatever  
In the heavens  
Or on earth: for He  
Is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.

45\. If God were to punish  
Men according to what  
They deserve, He would not  
Leave on the back  
Of the (earth) a single  
Living creature: but He  
Gives them respite  
For a stated Term:  
When their Term expires,  
Verily God has in His sight  
All His servants.
