### Sūra LXX.

### *Ma‘ārij,* or the Ways of Ascent.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. A questioner asked  
About a Penalty  
To befall—

2\. The Unbelievers,  
The which there is none  
To ward off,—

3\. (A Penalty) from God,  
Lord of the Ways  
Of Ascent.

4\. The angels and  
The Spirit ascend  
Unto Him in a Day  
The measure whereof  
Is (as) fifty thousand years:

<span id="page_1606">p. 1606</span>

5\. Therefore do thou hold  
Patience,—a Patience  
Of beautiful (contentment).

6\. They see the (Day) indeed  
As a far-off (event):

7\. But We see it  
(Quite) near.

8\. The Day that  
The sky will be like  
Molten brass,

9\. And the mountains will be  
Like wool,

10\. And no friend will ask  
After a friend,

11\. Though they will be put  
In sight of each other,—  
The sinner's desire will be:  
Would that he could

<span id="page_1607">p. 1607</span>

Redeem himself from  
The Penalty of that Day  
By (sacrificing) his children,

12\. His wife and his brother,

13\. His kindred who sheltered him,

14\. And all, all that is  
On earth,—so it could  
Deliver him:

15\. By no means!  
For it would be  
The Fire of Hell!—

16\. Plucking out (his being)  
Right to the skull!—

17\. Inviting (all) such  
As turn their backs  
And turn away their faces  
(From the Right),

18\. And collect (wealth)  
And hide it (from use)!

<span id="page_1608">p. 1608</span>

19\. Truly man was created  
Very impatient;—

20\. Fretful when evil  
Touches him;

21\. And niggardly when  
Good reaches him;—

22\. Not so those devoted  
To Prayer;—

23\. Those who remain steadfast  
To their prayer;

24\. And those in whose wealth  
Is a recognised right

25\. For the (needy) who asks  
And him who is prevented  
(For some reason from asking);

26\. And those who hold  
To the truth of the Day  
Of Judgment;

<span id="page_1609">p. 1609</span>

27\. And those who fear  
The displeasure of their Lord,—

28\. For their Lord's displeasure  
Is the opposite of Peace  
And Tranquillity;—

29\. And those who guard  
Their chastity,

30\. Except with their wives  
And the (captives) whom  
Their right hands possess,—  
For (then) they are not  
To be blamed,

31\. But those who trespass  
Beyond this are transgressors;—

32\. And those who respect  
Their trusts and covenants;

33\. And those who stand firm  
In their testimonies;

<span id="page_1610">p. 1610</span>

34\. And those who guard  
(The sacredness) of their  
worship;—

35\. Such will be  
The honoured ones  
In the Gardens (of Bliss).

##### SECTION 2.

36\. Now what is  
The matter with the Unbelievers  
That they rush madly  
Before thee—

37\. From the right  
And from the left,  
In crowds?

38\. Does every man of them  
Long to enter  
The Garden of Bliss?

39\. By no means!  
For We have created them  
Out of the (base matter)  
They know!

40\. Now I do  
Call to witness

<span id="page_1611">p. 1611</span>

The Lord of all points  
In the East and the West  
That We can certainly—

41\. Substitute for them  
Better (men) than they;  
And We are not  
To be defeated  
(In Our Plan).

42\. So leave them  
To plunge in vain talk  
And play about,  
Until they encounter  
That Day of theirs which  
They have been promised!—

43\. The Day whereon  
They will issue  
From their sepulchres  
In sudden haste  
As if they were  
Rushing to a goal-post  
(Fixed for them),—

44\. Their eyes lowered  
In dejection,  
Ignominy covering them  
(All over)!  
Such is the Day  
The which they  
Are promised!
