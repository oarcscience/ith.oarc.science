<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
<p>1. By the Mount (of Revelation);</p>  
<p>2. By a Decree Inscribed</p>  
<p>3. In a Scroll unfolded;</p>  
<p>4. By the much-frequented Fane;</p>  
<p>5. By the Canopy Raised High;</p>  
<p><a name="page_1433"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1433</font></A></p>  
<p>6. And by the Ocean<br> Filled with Swell;&#8212;</p>  
<p>7. Verily, the Doom of thy Lord<br> Will indeed come to pass;&#8212;</p>  
<p>8. There is none<br> Can avert it;&#8212;</p>  
<p>9. On the Day when<br> The firmament will be<br> In dreadful commotion.</p>  
<p>10. And the mountains will fly<br> Hither and thither.</p>  
<p>11. Then woe that Day<br> To those that treat<br> (Truth) as Falsehood;&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="page_1434"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1434</font></A></p>  
<p>12. That play (and paddle)<br> In shallow trifles.</p>  
<p>13. That Day shall they be<br> Thrust down to the Fire<br> Of Hell, irresistibly.</p>  
<p>14. "This", it will be said,<br> "Is the Fire,&#8212;which ye<br> Were wont to deny!</p>  
<p>15. "Is this then a fake,<br> Or is it ye that<br> Do not see?</p>  
<p>16. "Burn ye therein:<br> The same is it to you<br> Whether ye bear it<br> With patience, or not:<br> Ye but receive the recompense<br> Of your (own) deeds."</p>  
<p>17. As to the Righteous,<br> They will be in Gardens,<br> And in Happiness,&#8212;</p>  
<p>18. Enjoying the (Bliss) which<br> Their Lord hath bestowed<br> On them, and their Lord<br> Shall deliver them from<br> The Penalty of the Fire.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1435"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1435</font></A></p>  
<p>19. (To them will be said:)<br> "Eat and drink ye,<br> With profit and health,<br> Because of your (good) deeds."</p>  
<p>20. They will recline (with ease)<br> On Thrones (of dignity)<br> Arranged in ranks;<br> And We shall join them<br> To Companions, with beautiful<br> Big and lustrous eyes.</p>  
<p>21. And those who believe<br> And whose families follow<br> Them in Faith,&#8212; to them<br> Shall We join their families:<br> Nor shall We deprive them<br> (Of the fruit) of aught<br> Of their works:<br> (Yet) is each individual<br> In pledge for his deeds.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1436"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1436</font></A></p>  
<p>22. And We shall bestow<br> On them, of fruit and meat,<br> Anything they shall desire.</p>  
<p>23. They shall there exchange,<br> One with another,<br> A (loving) cup<br> Free of frivolity,<br> Free of all taint<br> Of ill.</p>  
<p>24. Round about them will serve,<br> (Devoted) to them,<br> Youths (handsome) as Pearls<br> Well-guarded.</p>  
<p>25. They will advance<br> To each other, engaging<br> In mutual enquiry.</p>  
<p>26. They will say: "Aforetime,<br> We were not without fear<br> For the sake of our people.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1437"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1437</font></A></p>  
<p>27. "But God has been good<br> To us, and has delivered us<br> From the Penalty<br> Of the Scorching Wind.</p>  
<p>28. "Truly, we did call<br> Unto Him from of old:<br> Truly it is He,<br> The Beneficent, the Merciful!</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>29. Wherefore proclaim thou<br> The praises (of thy Lord):<br> For by the Grace<br> Of thy Lord, thou art<br> No (vulgar) soothsayer, nor<br> Art thou one possessed.</p>  
<p>30. Or do they say:&#8212;<br> "A Poet! we await<br> For him some calamity<br> (Hatched) by Time!"</p>  
<p>31. Say thou: "Await ye!&#8212;<br> I too will wait<br> Along with you!"</p>  
<p><a name="page_1438"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1438</font></A></p>  
<p>32. Is it that their faculties<br> Of understanding urge them<br> To this, or are they<br> But a people transgressing<br> Beyond bounds?</p>  
<p>33. Or do they say,<br> "He fabricated the (Message)"?<br> Nay, they have no faith!</p>  
<p>34. Let them then produce<br> A recital like unto it,&#8212;<br> If (it be) they speak<br> The Truth!</p>  
<p>35. Were they created of<br> nothing,<br> Or were they themselves<br> The creators?</p>  
<p>36. Or did they create<br> The heavens and the earth?<br> Nay, they have<br> No firm belief.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1439"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1439</font></A></p>  
<p>37. Or are the Treasures<br> Of thy Lord with them,<br> Or are they the managers<br> (Of affairs)?</p>  
<p>38. Or have they a ladder,<br> By which they can (climb<br> Up to heaven and) listen<br> (To its secrets)? Then let<br> (Such a) listener of theirs<br> Produce a manifest proof.</p>  
<p>39. Or has He only daughters<br> And ye have sons?</p>  
<p>40. Or is it that thou<br> Dost ask for a reward,<br> So that they are burdened<br> With a load of debt?&#8212;</p>  
<p>41. Or that the Unseen<br> Is in their hands,<br> And they write it down?</p>  
<p>42. Or do they intend<br> A plot (against thee)?<br> But those who defy God<br> Are themselves involved<br> In a Plot!</p>  
<p><a name="page_1440"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1440</font></A></p>  
<p>43. Or have they a god<br> Other than God?<br> Exalted is God<br> Far above the things<br> They associate with Him!</p>  
<p>44. Were they to see<br> A piece of the sky<br> Falling (on them), they<br> Would (only) say: "Clouds<br> Gathered in heaps!"</p>  
<p>45. So leave them alone<br> Until they encounter<br> That Day of theirs,<br> Wherein they shall (perforce)<br> Swoon (with terror),&#8212;</p>  
<p>46. The Day when their plotting<br> Will avail them nothing<br> And no help shall be<br> Given them.</p>  
<p>47. And verily, for those<br> Who do wrong, there is<br> Another punishment besides this:<br> But most of them<br> Understand not.</p>  
<p>48. Now await in patience<br> The command of thy Lord:</p>  
<p><a name="page_1441"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1441</font></A></p>  
<p>For verily thou art<br> In Our eyes:<br> And celebrate the praises<br> Of thy Lord the while<br> Thou standest forth,</p>  
<p>49. And for part of the night<br> Also praise thou Him,&#8212;<br> And at the retreat<br> Of the stars!</p>
