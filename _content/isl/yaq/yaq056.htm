<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
<p>1. When the Event Inevitable<br> Cometh to pass,</p>  
<p>2. Then will no (soul)<br> Entertain falsehood<br> Concerning its coming.</p>  
<p>3. (Many) will it bring low;<br> (Many) will it exalt;</p>  
<p>4. When the earth shall be<br> Shaken to its depths,</p>  
<p>5. And the mountains shall<br> Be crumbled to atoms,</p>  
<p>6. Becoming dust scattered abroad,</p>  
<p>7. And ye shall be sorted out<br> Into three classes.</p>  
<p>8. Then (there will be)<br> The Companions of<br> The Right Hand;&#8212;<br> What will be<br> The Companions of<br> The Right Hand?</p>  
<p><a name="page_1485"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1485</font></A></p>  
<p>9. And the Companions of<br> The Left Hand,&#8212;<br> What will be<br> The Companions of<br> The Left Hand?</p>  
<p>10. And those Foremost<br> (In Faith) will be<br> Foremost (in the Hereafter).</p>  
<p>11. These will be<br> Those Nearest to God:</p>  
<p>12. In Gardens of Bliss:</p>  
<p>13. A number of people<br> From those of old,</p>  
<p>14. And a few from those<br> Of later times.</p>  
<p>15. (They will be) on Thrones<br> Encrusted (with gold<br> And precious stones),</p>  
<p>16. Reclining on them,<br> Facing each other.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1486"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1486</font></A></p>  
<p>17. Round about them will (serve)<br> Youths of perpetual (freshness),</p>  
<p>18. With goblets, (shining) beakers,<br> And cups (filled) out of<br> Clear-flowing fountains:</p>  
<p>19. No after-ache will they<br> Receive therefrom, nor will they<br> Suffer intoxication:</p>  
<p>20. And with fruits,<br> Any that they may select;</p>  
<p>21. And the flesh of fowls,<br> Any that they may desire.</p>  
<p>22. And (there will be) Companions<br> With beautiful, big,<br> And lustrous eyes,&#8212;</p>  
<p>23. Like unto Pearls<br> Well-guarded.</p>  
<p>24. A Reward for the Deeds<br> Of their past (Life).</p>  
<p>25. No frivolity will they<br> Hear therein, nor any<br> Taint of ill,&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="page_1487"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1487</font></A></p>  
<p>26. Only the saying,<br> "Peace! Peace".</p>  
<p>27. The Companions of<br> The Right Hand,&#8212;<br> What will be<br> The Companions of<br> The Right Hand?</p>  
<p>28. (They will be) among<br> Lote-trees without thorns,</p>  
<p>29. Among &#7788;al&#7717; trees<br> With flowers (or fruits)<br> Piled one above another,&#8212;</p>  
<p>30. In shade long-extended,</p>  
<p>31. By water flowing constantly,</p>  
<p>32. And fruit in abundance.</p>  
<p>33. Whose season is not limited,<br> Nor (supply) forbidden,</p>  
<p>34. And on Thrones (of Dignity),<br> Raised high.</p>  
<p>35. We have created<br> (their Companions)<br> Of special creation.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1488"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1488</font></A></p>  
<p>36. And made them<br> Virgin-pure (and undefiled),&#8212;</p>  
<p>37. Beloved (by nature),<br> Equal in age,&#8212;</p>  
<p>38. For the Companions<br> Of the Right Hand.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>39. A (goodly) number<br> From those of old,</p>  
<p>40. And a (goodly) number<br> From those of later times.</p>  
<p>41. The Companions of<br> The Left Hand,&#8212;<br> What will be<br> The Companions of<br> The Left Hand?</p>  
<p>42. (They will be) in the midst<br> Of a fierce Blast of Fire<br> And in Boiling Water,</p>  
<p>43. And in the shades<br> Of Black Smoke:</p>  
<p>44. Nothing (will there be)<br> To refresh, nor to please:</p>  
<p>45. For that they were wont<br> To be indulged, before that,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1489"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1489</font></A></p>  
<p>In wealth (and luxury),</p>  
<p>46. And persisted obstinately<br> In wickedness supreme!</p>  
<p>47. And they used to say,<br> "What! when we die<br> And become dust and bones,<br> Shall we then indeed<br> Be raised up again?&#8212;</p>  
<p>48. "(We) and our fathers of old?"</p>  
<p>49. Say: "Yea, those of old<br> And those of later times,</p>  
<p>50. "All will certainly be<br> Gathered together for the meeting<br> Appointed for a Day<br> Well-known.</p>  
<p>51. "Then will ye truly,&#8212;<br> O ye that go wrong,<br> And treat (Truth) as Falsehood!&#8212;</p>  
<p>52. "Ye will surely taste<br> Of the Tree of Zaqq&#363;m.</p>  
<p>53. "Then will ye fill<br> Your insides therewith,</p>  
<p>54. "And drink Boiling Water<br> On top of it:</p>  
<p><a name="page_1490"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1490</font></A></p>  
<p>55. "Indeed ye shall drink<br> Like diseased camels<br> Raging with thirst!"</p>  
<p>56. Such will be their entertainment<br> On the Day of Requital!</p>  
<p>57. It is We Who have<br> Created you: why will ye<br> Not witness the Truth?</p>  
<p>58. Do ye then see?&#8212;<br> The (human Seed) that<br> Ye throw out,&#8212;</p>  
<p>59. Is it ye who create it,<br> Or are We the Creators?</p>  
<p>60. We have decreed Death<br> To be your common lot,<br> And We are not<br> To be frustrated</p>  
<p><a name="page_1491"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1491</font></A></p>  
<p>61. From changing your Forms<br> And creating you (again)<br> In (Forms) that ye know not.</p>  
<p>62. And ye certainly know already<br> The first form of creation:<br> Why then do ye not<br> Celebrate His praises?</p>  
<p>63. See ye the seed that<br> Ye sow in the ground?</p>  
<p>64. Is it ye that cause it<br> To grow, or are We<br> The Cause?</p>  
<p>65. Were it Our Will,<br> We could crumble it<br> To dry powder, and ye would<br> Be left in wonderment,</p>  
<p>66. (Saying), "We are indeed<br> Left with debts (for nothing):</p>  
<p>67. "Indeed are we shut out<br> (Of the fruits of our labour)",</p>  
<p>68. See ye the water<br> Which ye drink?</p>  
<p>69. Do ye bring it Down<br> (In rain) from the Cloud<br> Or do We?</p>  
<p>70. Were it Our Will,<br> We could make it</p>  
<p><a name="page_1492"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1492</font></A></p>  
<p>Salt (and unpalatable):<br> Then why do ye not<br> Give thanks?</p>  
<p>71. See ye the Fire<br> Which ye kindle?</p>  
<p>72. Is it ye who grow<br> The tree which feeds<br> The fire, or do We<br> Grow it?</p>  
<p>73. We have made it<br> A memorial (of Our handiwork),<br> And an article of comfort<br> And convenience for<br> The denizens of deserts.</p>  
<p>74. Then celebrate with praises,<br> The name of thy Lord,<br> The Supreme!</p>  
<p><a name="page_1493"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1493</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
<p>75. Furthermore I call<br> To witness the setting<br> Of the Stars,&#8212;</p>  
<p>76. And that is indeed<br> A mighty adjuration<br> If ye but knew,&#8212;</p>  
<p>77. That this is indeed<br> A Qur-&#257;n most honourable,</p>  
<p>78. In a Book well-guarded,</p>  
<p>79. Which none shall touch<br> But those who are clean:</p>  
<p>80. A Revelation from the Lord<br> Of the Worlds.</p>  
<p>81. Is it such a Message<br> That ye would hold<br> In light esteem?</p>  
<p>82. And have ye made it<br> Your livelihood that ye<br> Should declare it false?</p>  
<p><a name="page_1494"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1494</font></A></p>  
<p>83. Then why do ye not<br> (Intervene) when (the soul<br> Of the dying man)<br> Reaches the throat,&#8212;</p>  
<p>84. And ye the while<br> (Sit) looking on,&#8212;</p>  
<p>85. But We are nearer<br> To him than ye,<br> And yet see not,&#8212;</p>  
<p>86. Then why do ye not,&#8212;<br> If you are exempt<br> From (future) account,&#8212;</p>  
<p>87. Call back the soul,<br> If ye are true<br> (In your claim of Independence)?</p>  
<p>88. Thus, then, if he<br> Be of those Nearest to God,</p>  
<p>89. (There is for him) Rest<br> And Satisfaction, and<br> A Garden of Delights.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1495"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1495</font></A></p>  
<p>90. And if he be<br> Of the Companions of<br> The Right Hand,</p>  
<p>91. (For him is the salutation),<br> "Peace be unto thee",<br> From the Companions<br> Of the Right Hand.</p>  
<p>92. And if he be<br> Of those who treat<br> (Truth) as Falsehood,<br> Who go wrong,</p>  
<p>93. For him is Entertainment<br> With Boiling Water,</p>  
<p>94. And burning in Hell-Fire.</p>  
<p>95. Verily, this is<br> The Very Truth<br> And Certainty.</p>  
<p>96. So celebrate with praises<br> The name of thy Lord,<br> The Supreme.</p>
