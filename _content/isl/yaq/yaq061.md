### Sūra LXI.

### *Ṣaff,* or Battle Array.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Whatever is  
In the heavens and  
On earth, let it declare  
The Praises and Glory  
Of God: for He is  
The Exalted in Might,  
The Wise.

2\. O ye who believe!  
Why say ye that  
Which ye do not?

3\. Grievously odious is it  
In the sight of God  
That ye say that  
Which ye do not.

4\. Truly God loves those  
Who fight in His Cause  
In battle array, as if  
They were a solid  
Cemented structure.

5\. And remember, Moses said  
To his people: "O my people!

<span id="page_1540">p. 1540</span>

Why do ye vex and insult  
Me, though ye know  
That I am the apostle  
Of God (sent) to you?"  
Then when they went wrong,  
God let their hearts go wrong.  
For God guides not those  
Who are rebellious transgressors.

6\. And remember, Jesus,  
The son of Mary, said:  
"O Children of Israel!  
I am the apostle of God  
(Sent) to you, confirming  
The Law (which came)  
Before me, and giving  
Glad Tidings of an Apostle  
To come after me,  
Whose name shall be Aḥmad."  
But when he came to them  
With Clear Signs,  
They said, "This is  
Evident sorcery!"

7\. Who doth greater wrong  
Than one who invents

<span id="page_1541">p. 1541</span>

Falsehood against God,  
Even as he is being invited  
To Islām? And God  
Guides not those  
Who do wrong.

8\. Their intention is  
To extinguish God's Light  
(By blowing) with their mouths:  
But God will complete  
(The revelation of) His Light,  
Even though the Unbelievers  
May detest (it).

9\. It is He Who has sent  
His Apostle with Guidance  
And the Religion of Truth,  
That he may proclaim it  
Over all religion,  
Even though the Pagans  
May detest (it).

##### SECTION 2.

10\. O ye who believe!  
Shall I lead you  
To a bargain that will  
Save you from  
A grievous Penalty?—

<span id="page_1542">p. 1542</span>

11\. That ye believe in God  
And His Apostle, and that  
Ye strive (your utmost)  
In the Cause of God,  
With your property  
And your persons:  
That will be best for you,  
If ye but knew!

12\. He will forgive you  
Your sins, and admit you  
To Gardens beneath which  
Rivers flow, and to beautiful  
Mansions in Gardens  
Of Eternity: that is indeed  
The supreme Achievement.

13\. And another (favour  
Will He bestow), which ye  
Do love,—help from God  
And a speedy victory.  
So give the Glad Tidings  
To the Believers.

14\. O ye who believe!  
Be ye helpers of God:  
As said Jesus the son of Mary  
To the Disciples, "Who will be  
My helpers to (the work  
Of) God?" Said the Disciples,

<span id="page_1543">p. 1543</span>

"We are God's helpers!"  
Then a portion of the Children  
Of Israel believed, and  
A portion disbelieved:  
But We gave power  
To those who believed,  
Against their enemies,  
And they became  
The ones that prevailed.
