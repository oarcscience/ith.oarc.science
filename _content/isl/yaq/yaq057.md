### Sūra LVII.

### *Ḥadīd,* or Iron.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Whatever is in  
The heavens and on earth,—  
Let it declare  
The Praises and Glory of God:  
For He is the Exalted  
In Might, the Wise.

2\. To Him belongs the dominion  
Of the heavens and the earth:  
It is He Who gives  
Life and Death; and He  
Has Power over all things.

3\. He is the First  
And the Last,  
The Evident  
And the Immanent:  
And He has full knowledge  
Of all things.

4\. He it is Who created  
The heavens and the earth  
In six Days, and is moreover  
Firmly established on the Throne  
(Of authority). He knows  
What enters within the earth

<span id="page_1498">p. 1498</span>

And what comes forth out  
Of it, what comes down  
From heaven and what mounts  
Up to it. And He is  
With you wheresoever ye  
May be. And God sees  
Well all that ye do.

5\. To Him belongs the dominion  
Of the heavens and the earth:  
And all affairs are  
Referred back to God.

6\. He merges Night into Day,  
And He merges Day into Night;  
And He has full knowledge  
Of the secrets of (all) hearts.

7\. Believe in God  
And His Apostle,  
And spend (in charity)  
Out of the (substance)  
Whereof He has made you  
Heirs. For, those of you  
Who believe and spend  
(In charity),—for them  
Is a great Reward.

8\. What cause have ye  
Why ye should not believe  
In God?—And the Apostle  
Invites you to believe

<span id="page_1499">p. 1499</span>

In your Lord, and has  
Indeed taken your Covenant,  
If ye are men of faith.

9\. He is the One Who  
Sends to His Servant  
Manifest Signs, that He  
May lead you from  
The depths of Darkness  
Into the Light And verily,  
God is to you  
Most kind and Merciful.

10\. And what cause have ye  
Why ye should not spend  
In the cause of God?—  
For to God belongs  
The heritage of the heavens  
And the earth.  
Not equal among you  
Are those who spent (freely)  
And fought, before the Victory,  
(With those who did so later).  
Those are higher in rank  
Than those who spent (freely)  
And fought afterwards.  
But to all has God promised  
A goodly (reward). And God  
Is well acquainted  
With all that ye do.

<span id="page_1500">p. 1500</span>

##### SECTION 2.

11\. Who is he that will  
Loan to God a beautiful  
Loan? For (God) will  
Increase it manifold  
To his credit,  
And he will have (besides)  
A liberal reward.

12\. One Day shalt thou see  
The believing men and  
The believing women—  
How their Light runs  
Forward before them  
And by their right hands:  
(Their greeting will be):  
"Good News for you this Day!  
Gardens beneath which How rivers!  
To dwell therein for aye!  
This is indeed  
The highest Achievement!

13\. One Day will the Hypocrites  
Men and women—say  
To the Believers: "Wait  
For us! Let us borrow  
(A light) from your Light!"  
It will be said: "Turn  
Ye back to your rear!  
Then seek a light (where  
Ye can)!" So a wall  
Will be put up betwixt them,

<span id="page_1501">p. 1501</span>

With a gate therein.  
Within it will be Mercy  
Throughout, and without it,  
All alongside, will be  
(Wrath and) Punishment!

14\. (Those without) will call out,  
"Were we not with you?  
(The others) will reply, "True!  
But ye led yourselves  
Into temptation; ye looked forward  
(To our ruin); ye doubted  
(God's Promise); and (your false)  
Desires deceived you; until  
There issued the Command  
Of God. And the Deceiver  
Deceived you in respect of God.

15\. "This Day shall no ransom  
Be accepted of you, nor  
Of those who rejected God.  
Your abode is the Fire:  
That is the proper place .  
To claim you: and an evil  
Refuge it is!"

16\. Has not the time arrived  
For the Believers that  
Their hearts in all humility  
Should engage in the remembrance

<span id="page_1502">p. 1502</span>

Of God and of the Truth  
Which has been revealed (to them),  
And that they should not  
Become like those to whom  
Was given Revelation aforetime,  
But long ages passed over them  
And their hearts grew hard?  
For many among them  
Are rebellious transgressors.

17\. Know ye (all) that  
God giveth life  
To the earth after its death  
Already have We shown  
The Signs plainly to you,  
That ye may learn wisdom.

18\. For those who give  
In Charity, men and women,  
And loan to God  
A Beautiful Loan,  
It shall be increased manifold  
(To their credit),  
And they shall have (besides)  
A liberal reward.

19\. And those who believe  
In God and His apostles—  
They are the Sincere  
(Lovers of Truth), and

<span id="page_1503">p. 1503</span>

The Witnesses (who testify),  
In the eyes of their Lord:  
They shall have their Reward  
And their Light,  
But those who reject God  
And deny Our Signs,—  
They are the Companions  
Of Hell-Fire.

##### SECTION 3.

20\. Know ye (all), that  
The life of this world  
Is but play and amusement,  
Pomp and mutual boasting  
And multiplying, (in rivalry)  
Among yourselves, riches  
And children.  
Here is a similitude:  
How rain and the growth  
Which it brings forth, delight  
(The hearts of) the tillers;  
Soon it withers; thou  
Wilt see it grow yellow;  
Then it becomes dry  
And crumbles away.  
But in the Hereafter  
Is a Penalty severe  
(For the devotees of wrong).  
And Forgiveness from God  
And (His) Good Pleasure

<span id="page_1504">p. 1504</span>

(For the devotees of God).  
And what is the life  
Of this world, but  
Goods and chattels  
Of deception?

21\. Be ye foremost (in seeking)  
Forgiveness from your Lord,  
And a Garden (of Bliss),  
The width whereof is  
As the width of  
Heaven and earth,  
Prepared for those who believe  
In God and His apostles:  
That is the Grace of God,  
Which He bestows on whom  
He pleases: and God is  
The Lord of Grace abounding.

22\. No misfortune can happen  
On earth or in your souls  
But is recorded in  
A decree before We bring  
It into existence:  
That is truly easy for God:

23\. In order that ye may  
Not despair over matters  
That pass you by,  
Nor exult over favours  
Bestowed upon you.  
For God loveth not

<span id="page_1505">p. 1505</span>

Any vainglorious boaster,—

24\. Such persons as are  
Covetous and commend  
Covetousness to men.  
And if any turn back  
(From God's Way), verily  
God is free of all needs,  
Worthy of all praise.

25\. We sent aforetime  
Our apostles with Clear Signs  
And sent down with them  
The Book and the Balance  
(Of Right and Wrong), that men  
May stand forth in justice;  
And We sent down Iron  
In which is (material for)  
Mighty war, as well as  
Many benefits for mankind,  
That God may test who  
It is that will help,

<span id="page_1506">p. 1506</span>

Unseen, Him and His apostles:  
For God is Full of Strength,  
Exalted in Might  
(And able to enforce His Will).

##### SECTION 4.

26\. And We sent Noah  
And Abraham, and established  
In their line Prophethood  
And Revelation: and some of them!  
Were on right guidance,  
But many of them  
Became rebellious transgressors.

27\. Then, in their wake,  
We followed them up  
With (others of) Our apostles:  
We sent after them  
Jesus the son of Mary,  
And bestowed on him  
The Gospel; and We ordained  
In the hearts of those  
Who followed him  
Compassion and Mercy.

<span id="page_1507">p. 1507</span>

But the Monasticism  
Which they invented  
For themselves, We did not  
Prescribe for them:  
(We commanded) only  
The seeking for the Good  
Pleasure of God; but that  
They did not foster  
As they should have done.  
Yet We bestowed, on those  
Among them who believed,  
Their (due) reward, but  
Many of them are  
Rebellious transgressors.

28\. O ye that believe!  
Fear God, and believe  
In His Apostle, and He will  
Bestow on you a double  
Portion of His Mercy:  
He will provide for you

<span id="page_1508">p. 1508</span>

A Light by which ye  
Shall walk (straight  
In your path), and He  
Will forgive you (your past):  
For God is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful:

29\. That the People of  
The Book may know  
That they have no power  
Whatever over the Grace  
Of God, that (His) Grace  
Is (entirely) in his hand,  
To bestow it on  
Whomsoever He wills.  
For God is the Lord.  
Of Grace abounding.
