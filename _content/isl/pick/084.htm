<A NAME="an_084_002">2</A>&nbsp;And attentive to her Lord in fear, </P>
<A NAME="an_084_003">3</A>&nbsp;And when the earth is spread out </P>
<A NAME="an_084_004">4</A>&nbsp;And hath cast out all that was in her, and is empty </P>
<A NAME="an_084_005">5</A>&nbsp;And attentive to her Lord in fear! </P>
<A NAME="an_084_006">6</A>&nbsp;Thou, verily, O man, art working toward thy Lord a work which thou wilt  meet (in His presence). </P>
<A NAME="an_084_007">7</A>&nbsp;Then whoso is given his account in his right hand </P>
<A NAME="an_084_008">8</A>&nbsp;He truly will receive an easy reckoning </P>
<A NAME="an_084_009">9</A>&nbsp;And will return unto his folk in joy. </P>
<A NAME="an_084_010">10</A>&nbsp;But whoso is given his account behind his back, </P>
<A NAME="an_084_011">11</A>&nbsp;He surely will invoke destruction </P>
<A NAME="an_084_012">12</A>&nbsp;And be thrown to scorching fire. </P>
<A NAME="an_084_013">13</A>&nbsp;He verily lived joyous with his folk, </P>
<A NAME="an_084_014">14</A>&nbsp;He verily deemed that he would never return (unto Allah). </P>
<A NAME="an_084_015">15</A>&nbsp;Nay, but lo! his Lord is ever looking on him! </P>
<A NAME="an_084_016">16</A>&nbsp;Oh, I swear by the afterglow of sunset, </P>
<A NAME="an_084_017">17</A>&nbsp;And by the night and all that it enshroudeth, </P>

<A NAME="an_084_019">19</A>&nbsp;That ye shall journey on from plane to plane. </P>
<A NAME="an_084_020">20</A>&nbsp;What aileth them, then, that they believe not </P>
<A NAME="an_084_021">21</A>&nbsp;And, when the Qur'an is recited unto them, worship not (Allah) ? </P>
<A NAME="an_084_022">22</A>&nbsp;Nay, but those who disbelieve will deny; </P>
<A NAME="an_084_023">23</A>&nbsp;And Allah knoweth best what they are hiding. </P>
