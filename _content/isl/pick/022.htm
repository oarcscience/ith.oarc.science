<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">22. al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage</H1>
<A NAME="an_022_001">1</A>&nbsp;O mankind! Fear your Lord. Lo! the earthquake of the Hour (of Doom) is a  tremendous thing. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_002">2</A>&nbsp;On the day when ye behold it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling  and every pregnant one will be delivered of her burden, and thou (Muhammad) wilt  see mankind as drunken, yet they will not be drunken, but the Doom of Allah will be  strong (upon them). </P>
<A NAME="an_022_003">3</A>&nbsp;Among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge,  and followeth each froward devil; </P>
<A NAME="an_022_004">4</A>&nbsp;For him it is decreed that whoso taketh him for friend, he verily will mislead  him and will guide him to the punishment of the Flame. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_005">5</A>&nbsp;O mankind! if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then lo! We have  created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a little  lump of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We may make (it) clear for you. And We  cause what We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed time, and afterward We  bring you forth as infants, then (give you growth) that ye attain your full strength.  And among you there is he who dieth (young), and among you there is he who is  brought back to the most abject time of life, so that, after knowledge, he knoweth  naught. And thou (Muhammad) seest the earth barren, but when We send down water  thereon, it doth thrill and swell and put forth every lovely kind (of growth). </P>
<A NAME="an_022_006">6</A>&nbsp;That is because Allah, He is the Truth and because He quickeneth the dead,  and because He is Able to do all things; </P>
<A NAME="an_022_007">7</A>&nbsp;And because the Hour will come, there is no doubt thereof; and because  Allah will raise those who are in the graves. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_008">8</A>&nbsp;And among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without  knowledge or guidance or a scripture giving light, </P>
<A NAME="an_022_009">9</A>&nbsp;Turning away in pride to beguile (men) from the way of Allah. For him in  this world is ignominy, and on the Day of Resurrection We make him taste the doom  of burning. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_010">10</A>&nbsp;(And unto him it will be said): This is for that which thy two hands have sent  before, and because Allah is no oppressor of His slaves. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_011">11</A>&nbsp;And among mankind is he who worshippeth Allah upon a narrow marge so  that if good befalleth him he is content therewith, but if a trial befalleth him, he falleth  away utterly. He loseth both the world and the Hereafter. That is the sheer loss. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_012">12</A>&nbsp;He calleth, beside Allah, unto that which hurteth him not nor benefiteth him.  That is the far error. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_013">13</A>&nbsp;He calleth unto him whose harm is nearer than his benefit; verily an evil  patron and verily an evil friend! </P>
<A NAME="an_022_014">14</A>&nbsp;Lo! Allah causeth those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens  underneath which rivers flow. Lo! Allah doth what He intendeth. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_015">15</A>&nbsp;Whoso is wont to think (through envy) that Allah will not give him  (Muhammad) victory in the world and the Hereafter (and is enraged at the thought of  his victory), let him stretch a rope up to the roof (of his dwelling), and let him hang  himself. Then let him see whether his strategy dispelleth that whereat he rageth!. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_016">16</A>&nbsp;Thus We reveal it as plain revelations, and verily Allah guideth whom He  will. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_017">17</A>&nbsp;Lo! those who believe (this revelation), and those who are Jews, and the  Sabaeans and the Christians and the Magians and the idolaters - Lo! Allah will decide  between them on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! Allah is Witness over all things. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_018">18</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not seen that unto Allah payeth adoration whosoever is in the  heavens and whosoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and  the hills, and the trees, and the beasts, and many of mankind, while there are many  unto whom the doom is justly due. He whom Allah scorneth, there is none to give  him honour. Lo! Allah doeth what He will. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_019">19</A>&nbsp;These twain (the believers and the disbelievers) are two opponents who  contend concerning their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will  be cut out for them; boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads, </P>
<A NAME="an_022_020">20</A>&nbsp;Whereby that which is in their bellies, and their skins too, will be melted; </P>
<A NAME="an_022_021">21</A>&nbsp;And for them are hooked rods of iron. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_022">22</A>&nbsp;Whenever, in their anguish, they would go forth from thence they are driven  back therein and (it is said unto them): Taste the doom of burning. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_023">23</A>&nbsp;Lo! Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will be allowed armlets of gold, and  pearls, and their raiment therein will be silk. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_024">24</A>&nbsp;They are guided unto gentle speech; they are guided unto the path of the  Glorious One. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_025">25</A>&nbsp;Lo! those who disbelieve and bar (men) from the way of Allah and from the  Inviolable Place of Worship, which We have appointed for mankind together, the  dweller therein and the nomad: whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein, him  We shall cause to taste a painful doom. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_026">26</A>&nbsp;And (remember) when We prepared for Abraham the place of the (holy)  House, saying: Ascribe thou no thing as partner unto Me, and purify My House for  those who make the round (thereof) and those who stand and those who bow and  make prostration. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_027">27</A>&nbsp;And proclaim unto mankind the pilgrimage. They will come unto thee on  foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every deep ravine, </P>
<A NAME="an_022_028">28</A>&nbsp;That they may witness things that are of benefit to them, and mention the  name of Allah on appointed days over the beast of cattle that He hath bestowed upon  them. Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor unfortunate. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_029">29</A>&nbsp;Then let them make an end of their unkemptness and pay their vows and go  around the ancient House. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_030">30</A>&nbsp;That (is the command). And whoso magnifieth the sacred things of Allah, it  will be well for him in the sight of his Lord. The cattle are lawful unto you save that  which hath been told you. So shun the filth of idols, and shun lying speech, </P>
<A NAME="an_022_031">31</A>&nbsp;Turning unto Allah (only), not ascribing partners unto Him; for whoso  ascribeth partners unto Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky and the birds had  snatched him or the wind had blown him to a far-off place. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_032">32</A>&nbsp;That (is the command). And whoso magnifieth the offerings consecrated to  Allah, it surely is from devotion of the hearts, </P>
<A NAME="an_022_033">33</A>&nbsp;Therein are benefits for you for an appointed term; and afterward they are  brought for sacrifice unto the ancient House. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_034">34</A>&nbsp;And for every nation have We appointed a ritual, that they may mention the  name of Allah over the beast of cattle that He hath given them for food; and your God  is One God, therefor surrender unto Him. And give good tidings (O Muhammad) to  the humble, </P>
<A NAME="an_022_035">35</A>&nbsp;Whose hearts fear when Allah is mentioned, and the patient of whatever may  befall them, and those who establish worship and who spend of that We have  bestowed on them. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_036">36</A>&nbsp;And the camels! We have appointed them among the ceremonies of Allah.  Therein ye have much good. So mention the name of Allah over them when they are  drawn up in lines. Then when their flanks fall (dead), eat thereof and feed the beggar  and the suppliant. Thus have We made them subject unto you, that haply ye may give  thanks. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_037">37</A>&nbsp;Their flesh and their food reach not Allah, but the devotion from you  reacheth Him. Thus have We made them subject unto you that ye may magnify Allah  that He hath guided you. And give good tidings (O Muhammad) to the good. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_038">38</A>&nbsp;Lo! Allah defendeth those who are true. Lo! Allah loveth not each  treacherous ingrate. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_039">39</A>&nbsp;Sanction is given unto those who fight because they have been wronged; and  Allah is indeed Able to give them victory; </P>
<A NAME="an_022_040">40</A>&nbsp;Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they  said: Our Lord is Allah - For had it not been for Allah's repelling some men by means  of others, cloisters and churches and oratories and mosques, wherein the name of  Allah is oft mentioned, would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helpeth  one who helpeth Him. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty - </P>
<A NAME="an_022_041">41</A>&nbsp;Those who, if We give them power in the land, establish worship and pay the  poor-due and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity. And Allah's is the sequel of events. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_042">42</A>&nbsp;If they deny thee (Muhammad), even so the folk of Noah, and (the tribes of)  A'ad and Thamud, before thee, denied (Our messengers); </P>
<A NAME="an_022_043">43</A>&nbsp;And the folk of Abraham and the folk of Lot; </P>
<A NAME="an_022_044">44</A>&nbsp;(And) the dwellers in Midian. And Moses was denied; but I indulged the  disbelievers a long while, then I seized them, and how (terrible) was My abhorrence! </P>
<A NAME="an_022_045">45</A>&nbsp;How many a township have We destroyed while it was sinful, so that it lieth  (to this day) in ruins, and (how many) a deserted well and lofty tower! </P>
<A NAME="an_022_046">46</A>&nbsp;Have they not travelled in the land, and have they hearts wherewith to feel  and ears wherewith to hear ? For indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the  hearts, which are within the bosoms, that grow blind. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_047">47</A>&nbsp;And they will bid thee hasten on the Doom, and Allah faileth not His  promise, but lo! a Day with Allah is as a thousand years of what ye reckon. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_048">48</A>&nbsp;And how many a township did I suffer long though it was sinful! Then I  grasped it. Unto Me is the return. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_049">49</A>&nbsp;Say: O mankind! I am only a plain warner unto you. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_050">50</A>&nbsp;Those who believe and do good works, for them is pardon and a rich  provision; </P>
<A NAME="an_022_051">51</A>&nbsp;While those who strive to thwart Our revelations, such are rightful owners of  the Fire. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_052">52</A>&nbsp;Never sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited (the  message) Satan proposed (opposition) in respect of that which he recited thereof. But  Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth. Then Allah establisheth His revelations.  Allah is Knower, Wise; </P>
<A NAME="an_022_053">53</A>&nbsp;That He may make that which the devil proposeth a temptation for those in  whose hearts is a disease, and those whose hearts are hardened - Lo! the evil-doers are  in open schism - </P>
<A NAME="an_022_054">54</A>&nbsp;And that those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth  from thy Lord, so that they may believe therein and their hearts may submit humbly  unto Him. Lo! Allah verily is guiding those who believe unto a right path. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_055">55</A>&nbsp;And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the Hour  come upon them unawares, or there come unto them the doom of a disastrous day. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_056">56</A>&nbsp;The Sovereignty on that day will be Allah's, He will judge between them.  Then those who believed and did good works will be in Gardens of Delight, </P>
<A NAME="an_022_057">57</A>&nbsp;While those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations, for them will be a  shameful doom. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_058">58</A>&nbsp;Those who fled their homes for the cause of Allah and then were slain or  died, Allah verily will provide for them a good provision. Lo! Allah, He verily is Best  of all who make provision. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_059">59</A>&nbsp;Assuredly He will cause them to enter by an entry that they will love. Lo!  Allah verily is Knower, Indulgent. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_060">60</A>&nbsp;That (is so). And whoso hath retaliated with the like of that which he was  made to suffer and then hath (again) been wronged, Allah will succour him. Lo! Allah  verily is Mild, Forgiving. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_061">61</A>&nbsp;That is because Allah maketh the night to pass into the day and maketh the  day to pass into the night, and because Allah is Hearer, Seer. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_062">62</A>&nbsp;That is because Allah, He is the True, and that whereon they call instead of  Him, it is the false, and because Allah, He is the High, the Great. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_063">63</A>&nbsp;Seest thou not how Allah sendeth down water from the sky and then the  earth becometh green upon the morrow ? Lo! Allah is Subtile, Aware. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_064">64</A>&nbsp;Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Lo!  Allah, He verily is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_065">65</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not seen how Allah hath made all that is in the earth subservient  unto you ? And the ship runneth upon the sea by His command, and He holdeth back  the heaven from falling on the earth unless by His leave. Lo! Allah is, for mankind,  Full of Pity, Merciful. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_066">66</A>&nbsp;And He it is Who gave you life, then He will cause you to die, and then will  give you life (again). Lo! man is verily an ingrate. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_067">67</A>&nbsp;Unto each nation have We given sacred rites which they are to perform; so  let them not dispute with thee of the matter, but summon thou unto thy Lord. Lo! thou  indeed followest right guidance. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_068">68</A>&nbsp;And if they wrangle with thee, say: Allah is Best Aware of what ye do. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_069">69</A>&nbsp;Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that  wherein ye used to differ. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_070">70</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not known that Allah knoweth all that is in the heaven and the  earth ? Lo! it is in a record. Lo! that is easy for Allah. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_071">71</A>&nbsp;And they worship instead of Allah that for which He hath sent down no  warrant, and that whereof they have no knowledge. For evil-doers there is no helper. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_072">72</A>&nbsp;And when Our revelations are recited unto them, thou knowest the denial in  the faces of those who disbelieve; they all but attack those who recite Our revelations  unto them. Say: Shall I proclaim unto you worse than that ? The Fire! Allah hath  promised it for those who disbelieve. A hapless journey's end! </P>
<A NAME="an_022_073">73</A>&nbsp;O mankind! A similitude is coined, so pay ye heed to it: Lo! those on whom  ye call beside Allah will never create a fly though they combine together for the  purpose. And if the fly took something from them, they could not rescue it from it. So  weak are (both) the seeker and the sought! </P>
<A NAME="an_022_074">74</A>&nbsp;They measure not Allah His rightful measure. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_075">75</A>&nbsp;Allah chooseth from the angels messengers, and (also) from mankind. Lo!  Allah is Hearer, Seer. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_076">76</A>&nbsp;He knoweth all that is before them and all that is behind them, and unto  Allah all things are returned. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_077">77</A>&nbsp;O ye who believe! Bow down and prostrate yourselves, and worship your  Lord, and do good, that haply ye may prosper. </P>
<A NAME="an_022_078">78</A>&nbsp;And strive for Allah with the endeavour which is His right. He hath chosen  you and hath not laid upon you in religion any hardship; the faith of your father  Abraham (is yours). He hath named you Muslims of old time and in this (Scripture),  that the messenger may be a witness against you, and that ye may be witnesses  against mankind. So establish worship, pay the poor-due, and hold fast to Allah. He is  your Protecting friend. A blessed Patron and a blessed Helper!
