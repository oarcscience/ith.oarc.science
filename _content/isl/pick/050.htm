<A NAME="an_050_001">1</A>&nbsp;Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_002">2</A>&nbsp;Nay, but they marvel that a warner of their own hath come unto them; and  the disbelievers say: This is a strange thing: </P>
<A NAME="an_050_003">3</A>&nbsp;When we are dead and have become dust (shall we be brought back again) ?  That would be a far return! </P>
<A NAME="an_050_004">4</A>&nbsp;We know that which the earth taketh of them, and with Us is a recording  Book. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_005">5</A>&nbsp;Nay, but they have denied the truth when it came unto them, therefor they  are now in troubled case. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_006">6</A>&nbsp;Have they not then observed the sky above them, how We have constructed  it and beautified it, and how there are no rifts therein ? </P>
<A NAME="an_050_007">7</A>&nbsp;And the earth have We spread out, and have flung firm hills therein, and  have caused of every lovely kind to grow thereon, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_008">8</A>&nbsp;A vision and a reminder for every penitent slave. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_009">9</A>&nbsp;And We send down from the sky blessed water whereby We give growth  unto gardens and the grain of crops, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_010">10</A>&nbsp;And lofty date-palms with ranged clusters, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_011">11</A>&nbsp;Provision (made) for men; and therewith We quicken a dead land. Even so  will be the resurrection of the dead. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_012">12</A>&nbsp;The folk of Noah denied (the truth) before them, and (so did) the dwellers at  Ar-Rass and (the tribe of) Thamud, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_013">13</A>&nbsp;And (the tribe of) A'ad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_014">14</A>&nbsp;And the dwellers in the wood, and the folk of Tubb'a: every one denied their  messengers, therefor My threat took effect. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_015">15</A>&nbsp;Were We then worn out by the first creation ? Yet they are in doubt about a  new creation. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_016">16</A>&nbsp;We verily created man and We know what his soul whispereth to him, and  We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_017">17</A>&nbsp;When the two Receivers receive (him), seated on the right hand and on the  left, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_018">18</A>&nbsp;He uttereth no word but there is with him an observer ready. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_019">19</A>&nbsp;And the agony of death cometh in truth. (And it is said unto him): This is that  which thou wast wont to shun. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_020">20</A>&nbsp;And the trumpet is blown. This is the threatened Day. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_021">21</A>&nbsp;And every soul cometh, along with it a driver and a witness. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_022">22</A>&nbsp;(And unto the evil-doer it is said): Thou wast in heedlessness of this. Now  We have removed from thee thy covering, and piercing is thy sight this day. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_023">23</A>&nbsp;And (unto the evil-doer) his comrade saith: This is that which I have ready  (as testimony). </P>
<A NAME="an_050_024">24</A>&nbsp;(And it is said): Do ye twain hurl to hell each rebel ingrate, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_025">25</A>&nbsp;Hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_026">26</A>&nbsp;Who setteth up another god along with Allah. Do ye twain hurl him to the  dreadful doom. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_027">27</A>&nbsp;His comrade saith: Our Lord! I did not cause him to rebel, but he was  (himself) far gone in error. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_028">28</A>&nbsp;He saith: Contend not in My presence, when I had already proffered unto  you the warning. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_029">29</A>&nbsp;The sentence that cometh from Me cannot be changed, and I am in no wise a  tyrant unto the slaves. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_030">30</A>&nbsp;On the day when We say unto hell: Art thou filled ? and it saith: Can there be  more to come ? </P>
<A NAME="an_050_031">31</A>&nbsp;And the Garden is brought nigh for those who kept from evil, no longer  distant. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_032">32</A>&nbsp;(And it is said): This is that which ye were promised.  (It is) for every  penitent and heedful one, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_033">33</A>&nbsp;Who feareth the Beneficent in secret and cometh with a contrite heart. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_034">34</A>&nbsp;Enter it in peace. This is the day of immortality. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_035">35</A>&nbsp;There they have all that they desire, and there is more with Us. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_036">36</A>&nbsp;And how many a generation We destroyed before them, who were mightier  than these in prowess so that they overran the lands! Had they any place of refuge  (when the judgment came) ? </P>
<A NAME="an_050_037">37</A>&nbsp;Lo! therein verily is a reminder for him who hath a heart, or giveth ear with  full intelligence. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_038">38</A>&nbsp;And verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between  them, in six Days, and naught of weariness touched Us. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_039">39</A>&nbsp;Therefor (O Muhammad) bear with what they say, and hymn the praise of  thy Lord before the rising and before the setting of the sun; </P>
<A NAME="an_050_040">40</A>&nbsp;And in the night-time hymn His praise, and after the (prescribed)  prostrations. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_041">41</A>&nbsp;And listen on the day when the crier crieth from a near place, </P>
<A NAME="an_050_042">42</A>&nbsp;The day when they will hear the (Awful) Cry in truth. That is the day of  coming forth (from the graves). </P>
<A NAME="an_050_043">43</A>&nbsp;Lo! We it is Who quicken and give death, and unto Us is the journeying. </P>
<A NAME="an_050_044">44</A>&nbsp;On the day when the earth splitteth asunder from them, hastening forth (they  come). That is a gathering easy for Us (to make). </P>
<A NAME="an_050_045">45</A>&nbsp;We are Best Aware of what they say, and thou (O Muhammad) art in no wise  a compeller over them. But warn by the Qur'an him who feareth My threat.
