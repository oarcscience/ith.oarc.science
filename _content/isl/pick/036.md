# 36. Ya Sin: Ya Sin

<span id="an_036_001">1</span> Ya Sin.

<span id="an_036_002">2</span> By the wise Qur'an,

<span id="an_036_003">3</span> Lo! thou art of those sent

<span id="an_036_004">4</span> On a straight path,

<span id="an_036_005">5</span> A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful,

<span id="an_036_006">6</span> That thou mayst warn a folk whose fathers
were not warned, so they are heedless.

<span id="an_036_007">7</span> Already hath the judgment, (for their
infidelity) proved true of most of them, for they believe not.

<span id="an_036_008">8</span> Lo! We have put on their necks carcans
reaching unto the chins, so that they are made stiff-necked.

<span id="an_036_009">9</span> And We have set a bar before them and a
bar behind them, and (thus) have covered them so that they see not.

<span id="an_036_010">10</span> Whether thou warn them or thou warn them
not, it is alike for them, for they believe not.

<span id="an_036_011">11</span> Thou warnest only him who followeth the
Reminder and feareth the Beneficent in secret. To him bear tidings of
forgiveness and a rich reward.

<span id="an_036_012">12</span> Lo! We it is Who bring the dead to life.
We record that which they send before (them, and their footprints. And
all things We have kept in a clear Register.

<span id="an_036_013">13</span> Coin for them a similitude: The people
of the city when those sent (from Allah) came unto them;

<span id="an_036_014">14</span> When We sent unto them twain, and they
denied them both, so We reinforced them with a third, and they said: Lo!
we have been sent unto you.

<span id="an_036_015">15</span> They said: Ye are but mortals like unto
us. The Beneficent hath naught revealed. Ye do but lie!

<span id="an_036_016">16</span> They answered: Our Lord knoweth that we
are indeed sent unto you,

<span id="an_036_017">17</span> And our duty is but plain conveyance (of
the message).

<span id="an_036_018">18</span> (The people of the city) said: We augur
ill of you. If ye desist not, we shall surely stone you, and grievous
torture will befall you at our hands.

<span id="an_036_019">19</span> They said: Your evil augury be with you!
Is it because ye are reminded (of the truth) ? Nay, but ye are froward
folk!

<span id="an_036_020">20</span> And there came from the uttermost part
of the city a man running. He cried: O my people! Follow those who have
been sent!

<span id="an_036_021">21</span> Follow those who ask of you no fee, and
who are rightly guided.

<span id="an_036_022">22</span> For what cause should I not serve Him
Who hath created me, and unto Whom ye will be brought back ?

<span id="an_036_023">23</span> Shall I take (other) gods in place of
Him when, if the Beneficent should wish me any harm, their intercession
will avail me naught, nor can they save ?

<span id="an_036_024">24</span> Then truly I should be in error
manifest.

<span id="an_036_025">25</span> Lo! I have believed in your Lord, so
hear me!

<span id="an_036_026">26</span> It was said (unto him): Enter paradise.
He said: Would that my people knew

<span id="an_036_027">27</span> With what (munificence) my Lord hath
pardoned me and made me of the honoured ones!

<span id="an_036_028">28</span> We sent not down against his people
after him a host from heaven, nor do We ever send.

<span id="an_036_029">29</span> It was but one Shout, and lo! they were
extinct.

<span id="an_036_030">30</span> Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never
came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him!

<span id="an_036_031">31</span> Have they not seen how many generations
We destroyed before them, which indeed returned not unto them;

<span id="an_036_032">32</span> But all, without exception, will be
brought before Us.

<span id="an_036_033">33</span> A token unto them is the dead earth. We
revive it, and We bring forth from it grain so that they eat thereof;

<span id="an_036_034">34</span> And We have placed therein gardens of
the date-palm and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush
forth therein,

<span id="an_036_035">35</span> That they may eat of the fruit thereof,
and their hands made it not. Will they not, then, give thanks ?

<span id="an_036_036">36</span> Glory be to Him Who created all the
sexual pairs, of that which the earth groweth, and of themselves, and of
that which they know not!

<span id="an_036_037">37</span> A token unto them is night. We strip it
of the day, and lo! they are in darkness.

<span id="an_036_038">38</span> And the sun runneth on unto a
resting-place for him. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise.

<span id="an_036_039">39</span> And for the moon We have appointed
mansions till she return like an old shrivelled palm-leaf.

<span id="an_036_040">40</span> It is not for the sun to overtake the
moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit.

<span id="an_036_041">41</span> And a token unto them is that We bear
their offspring in the laden ship,

<span id="an_036_042">42</span> And have created for them of the like
thereof whereon they ride.

<span id="an_036_043">43</span> And if We will, We drown them, and there
is no help for them, neither can they be saved;

<span id="an_036_044">44</span> Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort
for a while.

<span id="an_036_045">45</span> When it is said unto them: Beware of
that which is before you and that which is behind you, that haply ye may
find mercy (they are heedless).

<span id="an_036_046">46</span> Never came a token of the tokens of
their Lord to them, but they did turn away from it!

<span id="an_036_047">47</span> And when it is said unto them: Spend of
that wherewith Allah hath provided you, those who disbelieve say unto
those who believe: Shall we feed those whom Allah, if He willed, would
feed ? Ye are in naught else than error manifest.

<span id="an_036_048">48</span> And they say: When will this promise be
fulfilled, if ye are truthful ?

<span id="an_036_049">49</span> They await but one Shout, which will
surprise them while they are disputing.

<span id="an_036_050">50</span> Then they cannot make bequest, nor can
they return to their own folk.

<span id="an_036_051">51</span> And the trumpet is blown and lo! from
the graves they hie unto their Lord,

<span id="an_036_052">52</span> Crying: Woe upon us! Who hath raised us
from our place of sleep ? This is that which the Beneficent did promise,
and the messengers spoke truth.

<span id="an_036_053">53</span> It is but one Shout, and behold them
brought together before Us!

<span id="an_036_054">54</span> This day no soul is wronged in aught;
nor are ye requited aught save what ye used to do.

<span id="an_036_055">55</span> Lo! those who merit paradise this day
are happily employed,

<span id="an_036_056">56</span> They and their wives, in pleasant shade,
on thrones reclining;

<span id="an_036_057">57</span> Theirs the fruit (of their good deeds)
and theirs (all) that they ask;

<span id="an_036_058">58</span> The word from a Merciful Lord (for them)
is: Peace!

<span id="an_036_059">59</span> But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day!

<span id="an_036_060">60</span> Did I not charge you, O ye sons of Adam,
that ye worship not the devil - Lo! he is your open foe! -

<span id="an_036_061">61</span> But that ye worship Me ? That was the
right path.

<span id="an_036_062">62</span> Yet he hath led astray of you a great
multitude. Had ye then no sense ?

<span id="an_036_063">63</span> This is hell which ye were promised (if
ye followed him).

<span id="an_036_064">64</span> Burn therein this day for that ye
disbelieved.

<span id="an_036_065">65</span> This day We seal up their mouths, and
their hands speak out to Us and their feet bear witness as to what they
used to earn.

<span id="an_036_066">66</span> And had We willed, We verily could have
quenched their eyesight so that they should struggle for the way. Then
how could they have seen ?

<span id="an_036_067">67</span> And had We willed, We verily could have
fixed them in their place, making them powerless to go forward or turn
back.

<span id="an_036_068">68</span> He whom we bring unto old age, We
reverse him in creation (making him go back to weakness after strength).
Have ye then no sense ?

<span id="an_036_069">69</span> And We have not taught him (Muhammad)
poetry, nor is it meet for him. This is naught else than a Reminder and
a Lecture making plain,

<span id="an_036_070">70</span> To warn whosoever liveth, and that the
word may be fulfilled against the disbelievers.

<span id="an_036_071">71</span> Have they not seen how We have created
for them of Our handiwork the cattle, so that they are their owners,

<span id="an_036_072">72</span> And have subdued them unto them, so that
some of them they have for riding, some for food ?

<span id="an_036_073">73</span> Benefits and (divers) drinks have they
from them. Will they not then give thanks ?

<span id="an_036_074">74</span> And they have taken (other) gods beside
Allah, in order that they may be helped.

<span id="an_036_075">75</span> It is not in their power to help them;
but they (the worshippers) are unto them a host in arms.

<span id="an_036_076">76</span> So let not their speech grieve thee (O
Muhammad). Lo! We know what they conceal and what proclaim.

<span id="an_036_077">77</span> Hath not man seen that We have created
him from a drop of seed ? Yet lo! he is an open opponent.

<span id="an_036_078">78</span> And he hath coined for Us a similitude,
and hath forgotten the fact of his creation, saying: Who will revive
these bones when they have rotted away ?

<span id="an_036_079">79</span> Say: He will revive them Who produced
them at the first, for He is Knower of every creation,

<span id="an_036_080">80</span> Who hath appointed for you fire from the
green tree, and behold! ye kindle from it.

<span id="an_036_081">81</span> Is not He Who created the heavens and
the earth Able to create the like of them ? Aye, that He is! for He is
the All-Wise Creator,

<span id="an_036_082">82</span> But His command, when He intendeth a
thing, is only that He saith unto it: Be! and it is.

<span id="an_036_083">83</span> Therefor Glory be to Him in Whose hand
is the dominion over all things! Unto Him ye will be brought back.
