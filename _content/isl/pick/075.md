# 75. al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection

<span id="an_075_001">1</span> Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection;

<span id="an_075_002">2</span> Nay, I swear by the accusing soul (that
this Scripture is true).

<span id="an_075_003">3</span> Thinketh man that We shall not assemble
his bones ?

<span id="an_075_004">4</span> Yea, verily. We are Able to restore his
very fingers!

<span id="an_075_005">5</span> But man would fain deny what is before
him.

<span id="an_075_006">6</span> He asketh: When will be this Day of
Resurrection ?

<span id="an_075_007">7</span> But when sight is confounded

<span id="an_075_008">8</span> And the moon is eclipsed

<span id="an_075_009">9</span> And sun and moon are united,

<span id="an_075_010">10</span> On that day man will cry: Whither to
flee!

<span id="an_075_011">11</span> Alas! No refuge!

<span id="an_075_012">12</span> Unto thy Lord is the recourse that day.

<span id="an_075_013">13</span> On that day man is told the tale of that
which he hath sent before and left behind.

<span id="an_075_014">14</span> Oh, but man is a telling witness against
himself,

<span id="an_075_015">15</span> Although he tender his excuses.

<span id="an_075_016">16</span> Stir not thy tongue herewith to hasten
it.

<span id="an_075_017">17</span> Lo! upon Us (resteth) the putting
together thereof and the reading thereof.

<span id="an_075_018">18</span> And when We read it, follow thou the
reading;

<span id="an_075_019">19</span> Then lo! upon Us (resteth) the
explanation thereof.

<span id="an_075_020">20</span> Nay, but ye do love the fleeting Now

<span id="an_075_021">21</span> And neglect the Hereafter.

<span id="an_075_022">22</span> That day will faces be resplendent,

<span id="an_075_023">23</span> Looking toward their Lord;

<span id="an_075_024">24</span> And that day will other faces be
despondent,

<span id="an_075_025">25</span> Thou wilt know that some great disaster
is about to fall on them.

<span id="an_075_026">26</span> Nay, but when the life cometh up to the
throat

<span id="an_075_027">27</span> And men say: Where is the wizard (who
can save him now) ?

<span id="an_075_028">28</span> And he knoweth that it is the parting;

<span id="an_075_029">29</span> And agony is heaped on agony;

<span id="an_075_030">30</span> Unto thy Lord that day will be the
driving.

<span id="an_075_031">31</span> For he neither trusted, nor prayed.

<span id="an_075_032">32</span> But he denied and flouted.

<span id="an_075_033">33</span> Then went he to his folk with glee.

<span id="an_075_034">34</span> Nearer unto thee and nearer,

<span id="an_075_035">35</span> Again nearer unto thee and nearer (is
the doom).

<span id="an_075_036">36</span> Thinketh man that he is to be left
aimless ?

<span id="an_075_037">37</span> Was he not a drop of fluid which gushed
forth ?

<span id="an_075_038">38</span> Then he became a clot; then (Allah)
shaped and fashioned

<span id="an_075_039">39</span> And made of him a pair, the male and
female.

<span id="an_075_040">40</span> Is not He (Who doeth so) Able to bring
the dead to life ?
