<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">69. al-Haqqah: The Inevitable</H1>
<A NAME="an_069_001">1</A>&nbsp;The Reality! </P>
<A NAME="an_069_002">2</A>&nbsp;What is the Reality ? </P>
<A NAME="an_069_003">3</A>&nbsp;Ah, what will convey unto thee what the reality is! </P>
<A NAME="an_069_004">4</A>&nbsp;(The tribes of) Thamud and A'ad disbelieved in the judgment to come. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_005">5</A>&nbsp;As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the lightning. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_006">6</A>&nbsp;And as for A'ad, they were destroyed by a fierce roaring wind, </P>
<A NAME="an_069_007">7</A>&nbsp;Which He imposed on them for seven long nights and eight long days so that  thou mightest have seen men lying overthrown, as they were hollow trunks of palm- trees. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_008">8</A>&nbsp;Canst thou (O Muhammad) see any remnant of them ? </P>
<A NAME="an_069_009">9</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh and those before him, and the communities that were  destroyed, brought error, </P>
<A NAME="an_069_010">10</A>&nbsp;And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, therefor did He grip them  with a tightening grip. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_011">11</A>&nbsp;Lo! when the waters rose, We carried you upon the ship </P>
<A NAME="an_069_012">12</A>&nbsp;That We might make it a memorial for you, and that remembering ears (that  heard the story) might remember. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_013">13</A>&nbsp;And when the trumpet shall sound one blast </P>
<A NAME="an_069_014">14</A>&nbsp;And the earth with the mountains shall be lifted up and crushed with one  crash, </P>
<A NAME="an_069_015">15</A>&nbsp;Then, on that day will the Event befall. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_016">16</A>&nbsp;And the heaven will split asunder, for that day it will be frail. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_017">17</A>&nbsp;And the angels will be on the sides thereof, and eight will uphold the Throne  of thy Lord that day, above them. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_018">18</A>&nbsp;On that day ye will be exposed; not a secret of you will be hidden. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_019">19</A>&nbsp;Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say: Take,  read my book! </P>
<A NAME="an_069_020">20</A>&nbsp;Surely I knew that I should have to meet my reckoning. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_021">21</A>&nbsp;Then he will be in blissful state </P>
<A NAME="an_069_022">22</A>&nbsp;In a high garden </P>
<A NAME="an_069_023">23</A>&nbsp;Whereof the clusters are in easy reach. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_024">24</A>&nbsp;(And it will be said unto those therein): Eat and drink at ease for that which  ye sent on before you in past days. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_025">25</A>&nbsp;But as for him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say: Oh,  would that I had not been given my book </P>
<A NAME="an_069_026">26</A>&nbsp;And knew not what my reckoning! </P>
<A NAME="an_069_027">27</A>&nbsp;Oh, would that it had been death! </P>
<A NAME="an_069_028">28</A>&nbsp;My wealth hath not availed me, </P>
<A NAME="an_069_029">29</A>&nbsp;My power hath gone from me. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_030">30</A>&nbsp;(It will be said): Take him and fetter him </P>
<A NAME="an_069_031">31</A>&nbsp;And then expose him to hell-fire </P>
<A NAME="an_069_032">32</A>&nbsp;And then insert him in a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_033">33</A>&nbsp;Lo! He used not to believe in Allah the Tremendous, </P>
<A NAME="an_069_034">34</A>&nbsp;And urged not on the feeding of the wretched. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_035">35</A>&nbsp;Therefor hath he no lover here this day, </P>
<A NAME="an_069_036">36</A>&nbsp;Nor any food save filth </P>
<A NAME="an_069_037">37</A>&nbsp;Which none but sinners eat. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_038">38</A>&nbsp;But nay! I swear by all that ye see </P>
<A NAME="an_069_039">39</A>&nbsp;And all that ye see not </P>
<A NAME="an_069_040">40</A>&nbsp;That it is indeed the speech of an illustrious messenger. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_041">41</A>&nbsp;It is not poet's speech - little is it that ye believe! </P>
<A NAME="an_069_042">42</A>&nbsp;Nor diviner's speech - little is it that ye remember! </P>
<A NAME="an_069_043">43</A>&nbsp;It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_044">44</A>&nbsp;And if he had invented false sayings concerning Us, </P>
<A NAME="an_069_045">45</A>&nbsp;We assuredly had taken him by the right hand </P>
<A NAME="an_069_046">46</A>&nbsp;And then severed his life-artery, </P>
<A NAME="an_069_047">47</A>&nbsp;And not one of you could have held Us off from him. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_048">48</A>&nbsp;And lo! it is a warrant unto those who ward off (evil). </P>
<A NAME="an_069_049">49</A>&nbsp;And lo! We know that some among you will deny (it). </P>
<A NAME="an_069_050">50</A>&nbsp;And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_051">51</A>&nbsp;And lo! it is absolute truth. </P>
<A NAME="an_069_052">52</A>&nbsp;So glorify the name of thy Tremendous Lord.
