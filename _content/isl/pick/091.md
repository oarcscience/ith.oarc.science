------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 91. ash-Shams: The Sun

<span id="an_091_001">1</span> By the sun and his brightness,

<span id="an_091_002">2</span> And the moon when she followeth him,

<span id="an_091_003">3</span> And the day when it revealeth him,

<span id="an_091_004">4</span> And the night when it enshroudeth him,

<span id="an_091_005">5</span> And the heaven and Him Who built it,

<span id="an_091_006">6</span> And the earth and Him Who spread it,

<span id="an_091_007">7</span> And a soul and Him Who perfected it

<span id="an_091_008">8</span> And inspired it (with conscience of) what
is wrong for it and (what is) right for it.

<span id="an_091_009">9</span> He is indeed successful who causeth it to
grow,

<span id="an_091_010">10</span> And he is indeed a failure who stunteth
it.

<span id="an_091_011">11</span> (The tribe of) Thamud denied (the truth)
in their rebellious pride,

<span id="an_091_012">12</span> When the basest of them broke forth

<span id="an_091_013">13</span> And the messenger of Allah said: It is
the she-camel of Allah, so let her drink!

<span id="an_091_014">14</span> But they denied him, and they hamstrung
her, so Allah doomed them for their sin and rased (their dwellings).

<span id="an_091_015">15</span> He dreadeth not the sequel (of events).
