# 37. as-Saffat: The Rangers

<span id="an_037_001">1</span> By those who set the ranks in battle
order

<span id="an_037_002">2</span> And those who drive away (the wicked)
with reproof

<span id="an_037_003">3</span> And those who read (the Word) for a
reminder,

<span id="an_037_004">4</span> Lo! thy Lord is surely One;

<span id="an_037_005">5</span> Lord of the heavens and of the earth and
all that is between them, and Lord of the sun's risings.

<span id="an_037_006">6</span> Lo! We have adorned the lowest heaven
with an ornament, the planets;

<span id="an_037_007">7</span> With security from every froward devil.

<span id="an_037_008">8</span> They cannot listen to the Highest Chiefs
for they are pelted from every side,

<span id="an_037_009">9</span> Outcast, and theirs is a perpetual
torment;

<span id="an_037_010">10</span> Save him who snatcheth a fragment, and
there pursueth him a piercing flame.

<span id="an_037_011">11</span> Then ask them (O Muhammad): Are they
stronger as a creation, or those (others) whom we have created ? Lo! We
created them of plastic clay.

<span id="an_037_012">12</span> Nay, but thou dost marvel when they mock

<span id="an_037_013">13</span> And heed not when they are reminded,

<span id="an_037_014">14</span> And seek to scoff when they behold a
portent.

<span id="an_037_015">15</span> And they say: Lo! this is mere magic;

<span id="an_037_016">16</span> When we are dead and have become dust
and bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised (again) ?

<span id="an_037_017">17</span> And our forefathers ?

<span id="an_037_018">18</span> Say (O Muhammad): Ye, in truth; and ye
will be brought low.

<span id="an_037_019">19</span> There is but one Shout, and lo! they
behold,

<span id="an_037_020">20</span> And say: Ah, woe for us! This is the Day
of Judgment.

<span id="an_037_021">21</span> This is the Day of Separation, which ye
used to deny.

<span id="an_037_022">22</span> (And it is said unto the angels):
Assemble those who did wrong, together with their wives and what they
used to worship

<span id="an_037_023">23</span> Instead of Allah, and lead them to the
path to hell;

<span id="an_037_024">24</span> And stop them, for they must be
questioned.

<span id="an_037_025">25</span> What aileth you that ye help not one
another ?

<span id="an_037_026">26</span> Nay, but this day they make full
submission.

<span id="an_037_027">27</span> And some of them draw near unto others,
mutually questioning.

<span id="an_037_028">28</span> They say: Lo! ye used to come unto us,
imposing, (swearing that ye spoke the truth).

<span id="an_037_029">29</span> They answer: Nay, but ye (yourselves)
were not believers.

<span id="an_037_030">30</span> We had no power over you, but ye were
wayward folk.

<span id="an_037_031">31</span> Now the Word of our Lord hath been
fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are about to taste (the doom).

<span id="an_037_032">32</span> Thus we misled you. Lo! we were
(ourselves) astray.

<span id="an_037_033">33</span> Then lo! this day they (both) are
sharers in the doom.

<span id="an_037_034">34</span> Lo! thus deal We with the guilty.

<span id="an_037_035">35</span> For when it was said unto them, There is
no God save Allah, they were scornful

<span id="an_037_036">36</span> And said: Shall we forsake our gods for
a mad poet ?

<span id="an_037_037">37</span> Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he
confirmed those sent (before him).

<span id="an_037_038">38</span> Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful
doom -

<span id="an_037_039">39</span> Ye are requited naught save what ye did
-

<span id="an_037_040">40</span> Save single-minded slaves of Allah;

<span id="an_037_041">41</span> For them there is a known provision,

<span id="an_037_042">42</span> Fruits. And they will be honoured

<span id="an_037_043">43</span> In the Gardens of delight,

<span id="an_037_044">44</span> On couches facing one another;

<span id="an_037_045">45</span> A cup from a gushing spring is brought
round for them,

<span id="an_037_046">46</span> White, delicious to the drinkers,

<span id="an_037_047">47</span> Wherein there is no headache nor are
they made mad thereby.

<span id="an_037_048">48</span> And with them are those of modest gaze,
with lovely eyes,

<span id="an_037_049">49</span> (Pure) as they were hidden eggs (of the
ostrich).

<span id="an_037_050">50</span> And some of them draw near unto others,
mutually questioning.

<span id="an_037_051">51</span> A speaker of them saith: Lo! I had a
comrade

<span id="an_037_052">52</span> Who used to say: Art thou in truth of
those who put faith (in his words) ?

<span id="an_037_053">53</span> Can we, when we are dead and have become
mere dust and bones - can we (then) verily be brought to book ?

<span id="an_037_054">54</span> He saith: Will ye look ?

<span id="an_037_055">55</span> Then looketh he and seeth him in the
depth of hell.

<span id="an_037_056">56</span> He saith: By Allah, thou verily didst
all but cause my ruin,

<span id="an_037_057">57</span> And had it not been for the favour of my
Lord, I too had been of those haled forth (to doom).

<span id="an_037_058">58</span> Are we then not to die

<span id="an_037_059">59</span> Saving our former death, and are we not
to be punished ?

<span id="an_037_060">60</span> Lo! this is the supreme triumph.

<span id="an_037_061">61</span> For the like of this, then, let the
workers work.

<span id="an_037_062">62</span> Is this better as a welcome, or the tree
of Zaqqum ?

<span id="an_037_063">63</span> Lo! We have appointed it a torment for
wrong-doers.

<span id="an_037_064">64</span> Lo! it is a tree that springeth in the
heart of hell.

<span id="an_037_065">65</span> Its crop is as it were the heads of
devils

<span id="an_037_066">66</span> And lo! they verily must eat thereof,
and fill (their) bellies therewith.

<span id="an_037_067">67</span> And afterward, lo! thereupon they have a
drink of boiling water

<span id="an_037_068">68</span> And afterward, lo! their return is
surely unto hell.

<span id="an_037_069">69</span> They indeed found their fathers astray,

<span id="an_037_070">70</span> But they make haste (to follow) in their
footsteps.

<span id="an_037_071">71</span> And verily most of the men of old went
astray before them,

<span id="an_037_072">72</span> And verily We sent among them warners.

<span id="an_037_073">73</span> Then see the nature of the consequence
for those warned,

<span id="an_037_074">74</span> Save single-minded slaves of Allah.

<span id="an_037_075">75</span> And Noah verily prayed unto Us, and
gracious was the Hearer of his prayer

<span id="an_037_076">76</span> And We saved him and his household from
the great distress,

<span id="an_037_077">77</span> And made his seed the survivors,

<span id="an_037_078">78</span> And left for him among the later folk
(the salutation):

<span id="an_037_079">79</span> Peace be unto Noah among the peoples!

<span id="an_037_080">80</span> Lo! thus do We reward the good.

<span id="an_037_081">81</span> Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves.

<span id="an_037_082">82</span> Then We did drown the others.

<span id="an_037_083">83</span> And lo! of his persuasion verily was
Abraham

<span id="an_037_084">84</span> When he came unto his Lord with a whole
heart;

<span id="an_037_085">85</span> When he said unto his father and his
folk: What is it that ye worship ?

<span id="an_037_086">86</span> Is it a falsehood - gods beside Allah -
that ye desire ?

<span id="an_037_087">87</span> What then is your opinion of the Lord of
the Worlds ?

<span id="an_037_088">88</span> And he glanced a glance at the stars

<span id="an_037_089">89</span> Then said: Lo! I feel sick!

<span id="an_037_090">90</span> And they turned their backs and went
away from him.

<span id="an_037_091">91</span> Then turned he to their gods and said:
Will ye not eat ?

<span id="an_037_092">92</span> What aileth you that ye speak not ?

<span id="an_037_093">93</span> Then he attacked them, striking with his
right hand.

<span id="an_037_094">94</span> And (his people) came toward him,
hastening.

<span id="an_037_095">95</span> He said: Worship ye that which ye
yourselves do carve

<span id="an_037_096">96</span> When Allah hath created you and what ye
make ?

<span id="an_037_097">97</span> They said: Build for him a building and
fling him in the red-hotfire.

<span id="an_037_098">98</span> And they designed a snare for him, but
We made them the undermost.

<span id="an_037_099">99</span> And he said: Lo! I am going unto my Lord
Who will guide me.

<span id="an_037_100">100</span> My Lord! Vouchsafe me of the righteous.

<span id="an_037_101">101</span> So We gave him tidings of a gentle son.

<span id="an_037_102">102</span> And when (his son) was old enough to
walk with him, (Abraham) said: O my dear son, I have seen in a dream
that I must sacrifice thee. So look, what thinkest thou ? He said: O my
father! Do that which thou art commanded. Allah willing, thou shalt find
me of the steadfast.

<span id="an_037_103">103</span> Then, when they had both surrendered
(to Allah), and he had flung him down upon his face,

<span id="an_037_104">104</span> We called unto him: O Abraham!

<span id="an_037_105">105</span> Thou hast already fulfilled the vision.
Lo! thus do We reward the good.

<span id="an_037_106">106</span> Lo! that verily was a clear test.

<span id="an_037_107">107</span> Then We ransomed him with a tremendous
victim.

<span id="an_037_108">108</span> And We left for him among the later
folk (the salutation):

<span id="an_037_109">109</span> Peace be unto Abraham!

<span id="an_037_110">110</span> Thus do We reward the good.

<span id="an_037_111">111</span> Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves.

<span id="an_037_112">112</span> And we gave him tidings of the birth of
Isaac, a prophet of the righteous.

<span id="an_037_113">113</span> And We blessed him and Isaac. And of
their seed are some who do good, and some who plainly wrong themselves.

<span id="an_037_114">114</span> And We verily gave grace unto Moses and
Aaron,

<span id="an_037_115">115</span> And saved them and their people from
the great distress,

<span id="an_037_116">116</span> And helped them so that they became the
victors.

<span id="an_037_117">117</span> And We gave them the clear Scripture

<span id="an_037_118">118</span> And showed them the right path.

<span id="an_037_119">119</span> And We left for them among the later
folk (the salutation):

<span id="an_037_120">120</span> Peace be unto Moses and Aaron!

<span id="an_037_121">121</span> Lo! thus do We reward the good.

<span id="an_037_122">122</span> Lo! they are two of Our believing
slaves.

<span id="an_037_123">123</span> And lo! Elias was of those sent (to
warn),

<span id="an_037_124">124</span> When he said unto his folk: Will ye not
ward off (evil) ?

<span id="an_037_125">125</span> Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the
Best of creators,

<span id="an_037_126">126</span> Allah, your Lord and Lord of your
forefathers ?

<span id="an_037_127">127</span> But they denied him, so they surely
will be haled forth (to the doom)

<span id="an_037_128">128</span> Save single-minded slaves of Allah.

<span id="an_037_129">129</span> And we left for him among the later
folk (the salutation):

<span id="an_037_130">130</span> Peace be unto Elias!

<span id="an_037_131">131</span> Lo! thus do We reward the good.

<span id="an_037_132">132</span> Lo! he is one of our believing slaves.

<span id="an_037_133">133</span> And lo! Lot verily was of those sent
(to warn).

<span id="an_037_134">134</span> When We saved him and his household,
every one,

<span id="an_037_135">135</span> Save an old woman among those who
stayed behind;

<span id="an_037_136">136</span> Then We destroyed the others.

<span id="an_037_137">137</span> And lo! ye verily pass by (the ruin of)
them in the morning

<span id="an_037_138">138</span> And at night-time; have ye then no
sense ?

<span id="an_037_139">139</span> And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent
(to warn)

<span id="an_037_140">140</span> When he fled unto the laden ship,

<span id="an_037_141">141</span> And then drew lots and was of those
rejected;

<span id="an_037_142">142</span> And the fish swallowed him while he was
blameworthy;

<span id="an_037_143">143</span> And had he not been one of those who
glorify (Allah)

<span id="an_037_144">144</span> He would have tarried in its belly till
the day when they are raised;

<span id="an_037_145">145</span> Then We cast him on a desert shore
while he was sick;

<span id="an_037_146">146</span> And We caused a tree of gourd to grow
above him;

<span id="an_037_147">147</span> And We sent him to a hundred thousand
(folk) or more

<span id="an_037_148">148</span> And they believed, therefor We gave
them comfort for a while.

<span id="an_037_149">149</span> Now ask them (O Muhammad): Hath thy
Lord daughters whereas they have sons ?

<span id="an_037_150">150</span> Or created We the angels females while
they were present ?

<span id="an_037_151">151</span> Lo! it is of their falsehood that they
say:

<span id="an_037_152">152</span> Allah hath begotten. Allah! verily they
tell a lie.

<span id="an_037_153">153</span> (And again of their falsehood): He hath
preferred daughters to sons.

<span id="an_037_154">154</span> What aileth you ? How judge ye ?

<span id="an_037_155">155</span> Will ye not then reflect ?

<span id="an_037_156">156</span> Or have ye a clear warrant ?

<span id="an_037_157">157</span> Then produce your writ, if ye are
truthful.

<span id="an_037_158">158</span> And they imagine kinship between him
and the jinn, whereas the jinn know well that they will be brought
before (Him).

<span id="an_037_159">159</span> Glorified be Allah from that which they
attribute (unto Him),

<span id="an_037_160">160</span> Save single-minded slaves of Allah.

<span id="an_037_161">161</span> Lo! verily, ye and that which ye
worship,

<span id="an_037_162">162</span> Ye cannot excite (anyone) against Him.

<span id="an_037_163">163</span> Save him who is to burn in hell.

<span id="an_037_164">164</span> There is not one of us but hath his
known position.

<span id="an_037_165">165</span> Lo! we, even we are they who set the
ranks,

<span id="an_037_166">166</span> Lo! we, even we are they who hymn His
praise

<span id="an_037_167">167</span> And indeed they used to say:

<span id="an_037_168">168</span> If we had but a reminder from the men
of old

<span id="an_037_169">169</span> We would be single-minded slaves of
Allah.

<span id="an_037_170">170</span> Yet (now that it is come) they
disbelieve therein; but they will come to know.

<span id="an_037_171">171</span> And verily Our word went forth of old
unto Our bondmen sent (to warn)

<span id="an_037_172">172</span> That they verily would be helped,

<span id="an_037_173">173</span> And that Our host, they verily would be
the victors.

<span id="an_037_174">174</span> So withdraw from them (O Muhammad)
awhile,

<span id="an_037_175">175</span> And watch, for they will (soon) see.

<span id="an_037_176">176</span> Would they hasten on Our doom ?

<span id="an_037_177">177</span> But when it cometh home to them, then
it will be a hapless morn for those who have been warned.

<span id="an_037_178">178</span> Withdraw from them awhile

<span id="an_037_179">179</span> And watch, for they will (soon) see.

<span id="an_037_180">180</span> Glorified be thy Lord, the Lord of
Majesty, from that which they attribute (unto Him)

<span id="an_037_181">181</span> And peace be unto those sent (to warn).

<span id="an_037_182">182</span> And praise be to Allah, Lord of the
Worlds!
