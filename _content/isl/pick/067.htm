<A NAME="an_067_001">1</A>&nbsp;Blessed is He in Whose hand is the Sovereignty, and, He is Able to do all  things. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_002">2</A>&nbsp;Who hath created life and death that He may try you which of you is best in  conduct; and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving, </P>
<A NAME="an_067_003">3</A>&nbsp;Who hath created seven heavens in harmony. Thou (Muhammad) canst see  no fault in the Beneficent One's creation; then look again: Canst thou see any rifts ? </P>
<A NAME="an_067_004">4</A>&nbsp;Then look again and yet again, thy sight will return unto thee weakened and  made dim. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_005">5</A>&nbsp;And verily We have beautified the world's heaven with lamps, and We have  made them missiles for the devils, and for them We have prepared the doom of flame. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_006">6</A>&nbsp;And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there is the doom of hell, a  hapless journey's end! </P>
<A NAME="an_067_007">7</A>&nbsp;When they are flung therein they hear its roaring as it boileth up, </P>
<A NAME="an_067_008">8</A>&nbsp;As it would burst with rage. Whenever a (fresh) host is flung therein the  wardens thereof ask them: Came there unto you no warner ? </P>
<A NAME="an_067_009">9</A>&nbsp;They say: Yea, verily, a warner came unto us; but we denied and said: Allah  hath naught revealed; ye are in naught but a great error. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_010">10</A>&nbsp;And they say: Had we been wont to listen or have sense, we had not been  among the dwellers in the flames. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_011">11</A>&nbsp;So they acknowledge their sins; but far removed (from mercy) are the  dwellers in the flames. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_012">12</A>&nbsp;Lo! those who fear their Lord in secret, theirs will be forgiveness and a great  reward. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_013">13</A>&nbsp;And keep your opinion secret or proclaim it, lo! He is Knower of all that is in  the breasts (of men). </P>
<A NAME="an_067_014">14</A>&nbsp;Should He not know what He created ? And He is the Subtile, the Aware. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_015">15</A>&nbsp;He it is Who hath made the earth subservient unto you, so Walk in the paths  thereof and eat of His providence. And unto Him will be the resurrection (of the  dead). </P>
<A NAME="an_067_016">16</A>&nbsp;Have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not cause  the earth to swallow you when lo! it is convulsed ? </P>
<A NAME="an_067_017">17</A>&nbsp;Or have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not let  loose on you a hurricane ? But ye shall know the manner of My warning. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_018">18</A>&nbsp;And verily those before them denied, then (see) the manner of My wrath  (with them)! </P>
<A NAME="an_067_019">19</A>&nbsp;Have they not seen the birds above them spreading out their wings and  closing them ? Naught upholdeth them save the Beneficent. Lo! He is Seer of all  things. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_020">20</A>&nbsp;Or who is he that will be an army unto you to help you instead of the  Beneficent ? The disbelievers are in naught but illusion. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_021">21</A>&nbsp;Or who is he that will provide for you if He should withhold His providence  ? Nay, but they are set in pride and frowardness. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_022">22</A>&nbsp;Is he who goeth groping on his face more rightly guided, or he who walketh  upright on a straight road ? </P>
<A NAME="an_067_023">23</A>&nbsp;Say (unto them, O Muhammad): He it is who gave you being, and hath  assigned unto you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give ye! </P>
<A NAME="an_067_024">24</A>&nbsp;Say: He it is Who multiplieth you in the earth, and unto Whom ye will be  gathered. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_025">25</A>&nbsp;And they say: When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ? </P>
<A NAME="an_067_026">26</A>&nbsp;Say: The knowledge is with Allah only, and I am but a plain warner; </P>
<A NAME="an_067_027">27</A>&nbsp;But when they see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve will be awry,  and it will be said (unto them): This is that for which ye used to call. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_028">28</A>&nbsp;Say (O Muhammad): Have ye thought: Whether Allah causeth me  (Muhammad) and those with me to perish or hath mercy on us, still, who will protect  the disbelievers from a painful doom ? </P>
<A NAME="an_067_029">29</A>&nbsp;Say: He is the Beneficent. In Him we believe and in Him we put our trust.  And ye will soon know who it is that is in error manifest. </P>
<A NAME="an_067_030">30</A>&nbsp;Say: Have ye thought: If (all) your water were to disappear into the earth,  who then could bring you gushing water ?
