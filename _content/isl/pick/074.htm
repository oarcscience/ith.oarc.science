<A NAME="an_074_001">1</A>&nbsp;O thou enveloped in thy cloak, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_002">2</A>&nbsp;Arise and warn! </P>
<A NAME="an_074_003">3</A>&nbsp;Thy Lord magnify, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_004">4</A>&nbsp;Thy raiment purify, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_005">5</A>&nbsp;Pollution shun! </P>
<A NAME="an_074_006">6</A>&nbsp;And show not favour, seeking wordly gain! </P>
<A NAME="an_074_007">7</A>&nbsp;For the sake of thy Lord, be patient! </P>
<A NAME="an_074_008">8</A>&nbsp;For when the trumpet shall sound, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_009">9</A>&nbsp;Surely that day will be a day of anguish, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_010">10</A>&nbsp;Not of ease, for disbelievers. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_011">11</A>&nbsp;Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_012">12</A>&nbsp;And then bestowed upon him ample means, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_013">13</A>&nbsp;And sons abiding in his presence </P>
<A NAME="an_074_014">14</A>&nbsp;And made (life) smooth for him. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_015">15</A>&nbsp;Yet he desireth that I should give more. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_016">16</A>&nbsp;Nay! For lo! he hath been stubborn to Our revelations. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_017">17</A>&nbsp;On him I shall impose a fearful doom. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_018">18</A>&nbsp;For lo! he did consider; then he planned - </P>
<A NAME="an_074_019">19</A>&nbsp;(Self-)destroyed is he, how he planned! </P>
<A NAME="an_074_020">20</A>&nbsp;Again (self-)destroyed is he, how he planned! - </P>
<A NAME="an_074_021">21</A>&nbsp;Then looked he, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_022">22</A>&nbsp;Then frowned he and showed displeasure. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_023">23</A>&nbsp;Then turned he away in pride </P>
<A NAME="an_074_024">24</A>&nbsp;And said: This is naught else than magic from of old; </P>
<A NAME="an_074_025">25</A>&nbsp;This is naught else than speech of mortal man. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_026">26</A>&nbsp;Him shall I fling unto the burning. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_027">27</A>&nbsp; - Ah, what will convey unto thee what that burning is! - </P>
<A NAME="an_074_028">28</A>&nbsp;It leaveth naught; it spareth naught </P>
<A NAME="an_074_029">29</A>&nbsp;It shrivelleth the man. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_030">30</A>&nbsp;Above it are nineteen. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_031">31</A>&nbsp;We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and their number  have We made to be a stumbling-block for those who disbelieve; that those to whom  the Scripture hath been given may have certainty, and that believers may increase in  faith; and that those to whom the Scripture hath been given and believers may not  doubt; and that those in whose hearts there is disease, and disbelievers, may say:  What meaneth Allah by this similitude ? Thus Allah sendeth astray whom He will,  and whom He will He guideth. None knoweth the hosts of thy Lord save Him. This is  naught else than a Reminder unto mortals. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_032">32</A>&nbsp;Nay, by the Moon </P>
<A NAME="an_074_033">33</A>&nbsp;And the night when it withdraweth </P>
<A NAME="an_074_034">34</A>&nbsp;And the dawn when it shineth forth, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_035">35</A>&nbsp;Lo! this is one of the greatest (portents) </P>
<A NAME="an_074_036">36</A>&nbsp;As a warning unto men, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_037">37</A>&nbsp;Unto him of you who will advance or hang back. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_038">38</A>&nbsp;Every soul is a pledge for its own deeds; </P>
<A NAME="an_074_039">39</A>&nbsp;Save those who will stand on the right hand. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_040">40</A>&nbsp;In gardens they will ask one another </P>
<A NAME="an_074_041">41</A>&nbsp;Concerning the guilty: </P>
<A NAME="an_074_042">42</A>&nbsp;What hath brought you to this burning ? </P>
<A NAME="an_074_043">43</A>&nbsp;They will answer: We were not of those who prayed </P>
<A NAME="an_074_044">44</A>&nbsp;Nor did we feed the wretched. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_045">45</A>&nbsp;We used to wade (in vain dispute) with (all) waders, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_046">46</A>&nbsp;And we used to deny the Day of Judgment, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_047">47</A>&nbsp;Till the Inevitable came unto us. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_048">48</A>&nbsp;The mediation of no mediators will avail them then. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_049">49</A>&nbsp;Why now turn they away from the Admonishment, </P>
<A NAME="an_074_050">50</A>&nbsp;As they were frightened asses </P>
<A NAME="an_074_051">51</A>&nbsp;Fleeing from a lion ? </P>
<A NAME="an_074_052">52</A>&nbsp;Nay, but everyone of them desireth that he should be given open pages (from  Allah). </P>
<A NAME="an_074_053">53</A>&nbsp;Nay, verily. They fear not the Hereafter. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_054">54</A>&nbsp;Nay, verily. Lo! this is an Admonishment. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_055">55</A>&nbsp;So whosoever will may heed. </P>
<A NAME="an_074_056">56</A>&nbsp;And they will not heed unless Allah willeth (it). He is the fount of fear. He is  the fount of Mercy.
