# 83. at-Tatfif: The Defrauders

<span id="an_083_001">1</span> Woe unto the defrauders:

<span id="an_083_002">2</span> Those who when they take the measure from
mankind demand it full,

<span id="an_083_003">3</span> But if they measure unto them or weight
for them, they cause them loss.

<span id="an_083_004">4</span> Do such (men) not consider that they will
be raised again

<span id="an_083_005">5</span> Unto an Awful Day,

<span id="an_083_006">6</span> The day when (all) mankind stand before
the Lord of the Worlds ?

<span id="an_083_007">7</span> Nay, but the record of the vile is in
Sijjin -

<span id="an_083_008">8</span> Ah! what will convey unto thee what
Sijjin is! -

<span id="an_083_009">9</span> A written record.

<span id="an_083_010">10</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_083_011">11</span> Those who deny the Day of Judgment

<span id="an_083_012">12</span> Which none denieth save each criminal
transgressor,

<span id="an_083_013">13</span> Who, when thou readest unto him Our
revelations, saith: (Mere) fables of the men of old.

<span id="an_083_014">14</span> Nay, but that which they have earned is
rust upon their hearts.

<span id="an_083_015">15</span> Nay, but surely on that day they will be
covered from (the mercy of) their Lord.

<span id="an_083_016">16</span> Then lo! they verily will burn in hell,

<span id="an_083_017">17</span> And it will be said (unto them): This is
that which ye used to deny.

<span id="an_083_018">18</span> Nay, but the record of the righteous is
in 'Illiyin -

<span id="an_083_019">19</span> Ah, what will convey unto thee what
'Illiyin is! -

<span id="an_083_020">20</span> A written record,

<span id="an_083_021">21</span> Attested by those who are brought near
(unto their Lord).

<span id="an_083_022">22</span> Lo! the righteous verily are in delight,

<span id="an_083_023">23</span> On couches, gazing,

<span id="an_083_024">24</span> Thou wilt know in their faces the
radiance of delight.

<span id="an_083_025">25</span> They are given to drink of a pure wine,
sealed,

<span id="an_083_026">26</span> Whose seal is musk - for this let (all)
those strive who strive for bliss -

<span id="an_083_027">27</span> And mixed with water of Tasnim,

<span id="an_083_028">28</span> A spring whence those brought near (to
Allah) drink.

<span id="an_083_029">29</span> Lo! the guilty used to laugh at those
who believed,

<span id="an_083_030">30</span> And wink one to another when they passed
them;

<span id="an_083_031">31</span> And when they returned to their own
folk, they returned jesting;

<span id="an_083_032">32</span> And when they saw them they said: Lo!
these have gone astray.

<span id="an_083_033">33</span> Yet they were not sent as guardians over
them.

<span id="an_083_034">34</span> This day it is those who believe who
have the laugh of disbelievers,

<span id="an_083_035">35</span> On high couches, gazing.

<span id="an_083_036">36</span> Are not the disbelievers paid for what
they used to do ?
