<A NAME="an_036_001">1</A>&nbsp;Ya Sin. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_002">2</A>&nbsp;By the wise Qur'an, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_003">3</A>&nbsp;Lo! thou art of those sent </P>
<A NAME="an_036_004">4</A>&nbsp;On a straight path, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_005">5</A>&nbsp;A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_006">6</A>&nbsp;That thou mayst warn a folk whose fathers were not warned, so they are  heedless. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_007">7</A>&nbsp;Already hath the judgment, (for their infidelity) proved true of most of them,  for they believe not. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_008">8</A>&nbsp;Lo! We have put on their necks carcans reaching unto the chins, so that they  are made stiff-necked. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_009">9</A>&nbsp;And We have set a bar before them and a bar behind them, and (thus) have  covered them so that they see not. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_010">10</A>&nbsp;Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not, it is alike for them, for they  believe not. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_011">11</A>&nbsp;Thou warnest only him who followeth the Reminder and feareth the  Beneficent in secret. To him bear tidings of forgiveness and a rich reward. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_012">12</A>&nbsp;Lo! We it is Who bring the dead to life. We record that which they send  before (them, and their footprints. And all things We have kept in a clear Register. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_013">13</A>&nbsp;Coin for them a similitude: The people of the city when those sent (from  Allah) came unto them; </P>
<A NAME="an_036_014">14</A>&nbsp;When We sent unto them twain, and they denied them both, so We  reinforced them with a third, and they said: Lo! we have been sent unto you. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_015">15</A>&nbsp;They said: Ye are but mortals like unto us. The Beneficent hath naught  revealed. Ye do but lie! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_016">16</A>&nbsp;They answered: Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_017">17</A>&nbsp;And our duty is but plain conveyance (of the message). </P>
<A NAME="an_036_018">18</A>&nbsp;(The people of the city) said: We augur ill of you. If ye desist not, we shall  surely stone you, and grievous torture will befall you at our hands. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_019">19</A>&nbsp;They said: Your evil augury be with you! Is it because ye are reminded (of  the truth) ? Nay, but ye are froward folk! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_020">20</A>&nbsp;And there came from the uttermost part of the city a man running. He cried:  O my people! Follow those who have been sent! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_021">21</A>&nbsp;Follow those who ask of you no fee, and who are rightly guided. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_022">22</A>&nbsp;For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto  Whom ye will be brought back ? </P>
<A NAME="an_036_023">23</A>&nbsp;Shall I take (other) gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should wish  me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save ? </P>
<A NAME="an_036_024">24</A>&nbsp;Then truly I should be in error manifest. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_025">25</A>&nbsp;Lo! I have believed in your Lord, so hear me! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_026">26</A>&nbsp;It was said (unto him): Enter paradise. He said: Would that my people knew </P>
<A NAME="an_036_027">27</A>&nbsp;With what (munificence) my Lord hath pardoned me and made me of the  honoured ones! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_028">28</A>&nbsp;We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do  We ever send. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_029">29</A>&nbsp;It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_030">30</A>&nbsp;Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger  but they did mock him! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_031">31</A>&nbsp;Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which  indeed returned not unto them; </P>
<A NAME="an_036_032">32</A>&nbsp;But all, without exception, will be brought before Us. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_033">33</A>&nbsp;A token unto them is the dead earth. We revive it, and We bring forth from it  grain so that they eat thereof; </P>
<A NAME="an_036_034">34</A>&nbsp;And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We  have caused springs of water to gush forth therein, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_035">35</A>&nbsp;That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they  not, then, give thanks ? </P>
<A NAME="an_036_036">36</A>&nbsp;Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs, of that which the earth  groweth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_037">37</A>&nbsp;A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in  darkness. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_038">38</A>&nbsp;And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of  the Mighty, the Wise. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_039">39</A>&nbsp;And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old  shrivelled palm-leaf. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_040">40</A>&nbsp;It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day.  They float each in an orbit. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_041">41</A>&nbsp;And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_042">42</A>&nbsp;And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_043">43</A>&nbsp;And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can  they be saved; </P>
<A NAME="an_036_044">44</A>&nbsp;Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_045">45</A>&nbsp;When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which  is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy (they are heedless). </P>
<A NAME="an_036_046">46</A>&nbsp;Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn  away from it! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_047">47</A>&nbsp;And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided  you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom  Allah, if He willed, would feed ? Ye are in naught else than error manifest. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_048">48</A>&nbsp;And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful ? </P>
<A NAME="an_036_049">49</A>&nbsp;They await but one Shout, which will surprise them while they are disputing. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_050">50</A>&nbsp;Then they cannot make bequest, nor can they return to their own folk. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_051">51</A>&nbsp;And the trumpet is blown and lo! from the graves they hie unto their Lord, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_052">52</A>&nbsp;Crying: Woe upon us! Who hath raised us from our place of sleep ? This is  that which the Beneficent did promise, and the messengers spoke truth. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_053">53</A>&nbsp;It is but one Shout, and behold them brought together before Us! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_054">54</A>&nbsp;This day no soul is wronged in aught; nor are ye requited aught save what ye  used to do. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_055">55</A>&nbsp;Lo! those who merit paradise this day are happily employed, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_056">56</A>&nbsp;They and their wives, in pleasant shade, on thrones reclining; </P>
<A NAME="an_036_057">57</A>&nbsp;Theirs the fruit (of their good deeds) and theirs (all) that they ask; </P>
<A NAME="an_036_058">58</A>&nbsp;The word from a Merciful Lord (for them) is: Peace! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_059">59</A>&nbsp;But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day! </P>
<A NAME="an_036_060">60</A>&nbsp;Did I not charge you, O ye sons of Adam, that ye worship not the devil - Lo!  he is your open foe! - </P>
<A NAME="an_036_061">61</A>&nbsp;But that ye worship Me ? That was the right path. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_062">62</A>&nbsp;Yet he hath led astray of you a great multitude. Had ye then no sense ? </P>
<A NAME="an_036_063">63</A>&nbsp;This is hell which ye were promised (if ye followed him). </P>
<A NAME="an_036_064">64</A>&nbsp;Burn therein this day for that ye disbelieved. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_065">65</A>&nbsp;This day We seal up their mouths, and their hands speak out to Us and their  feet bear witness as to what they used to earn. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_066">66</A>&nbsp;And had We willed, We verily could have quenched their eyesight so that  they should struggle for the way. Then how could they have seen ? </P>
<A NAME="an_036_067">67</A>&nbsp;And had We willed, We verily could have fixed them in their place, making  them powerless to go forward or turn back. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_068">68</A>&nbsp;He whom we bring unto old age, We reverse him in creation (making him go  back to weakness after strength). Have ye then no sense ? </P>
<A NAME="an_036_069">69</A>&nbsp;And We have not taught him (Muhammad) poetry, nor is it meet for him.  This is naught else than a Reminder and a Lecture making plain, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_070">70</A>&nbsp;To warn whosoever liveth, and that the word may be fulfilled against the  disbelievers. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_071">71</A>&nbsp;Have they not seen how We have created for them of Our handiwork the  cattle, so that they are their owners, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_072">72</A>&nbsp;And have subdued them unto them, so that some of them they have for  riding, some for food ? </P>
<A NAME="an_036_073">73</A>&nbsp;Benefits and (divers) drinks have they from them. Will they not then give  thanks ? </P>
<A NAME="an_036_074">74</A>&nbsp;And they have taken (other) gods beside Allah, in order that they may be  helped. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_075">75</A>&nbsp;It is not in their power to help them; but they (the worshippers) are unto them  a host in arms. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_076">76</A>&nbsp;So let not their speech grieve thee (O Muhammad). Lo! We know what they  conceal and what proclaim. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_077">77</A>&nbsp;Hath not man seen that We have created him from a drop of seed ? Yet lo! he  is an open opponent. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_078">78</A>&nbsp;And he hath coined for Us a similitude, and hath forgotten the fact of his  creation, saying: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away ? </P>
<A NAME="an_036_079">79</A>&nbsp;Say: He will revive them Who produced them at the first, for He is Knower  of every creation, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_080">80</A>&nbsp;Who hath appointed for you fire from the green tree, and behold! ye kindle  from it. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_081">81</A>&nbsp;Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the like of  them ? Aye, that He is! for He is the All-Wise Creator, </P>
<A NAME="an_036_082">82</A>&nbsp;But His command, when He intendeth a thing, is only that He saith unto it:  Be! and it is. </P>
<A NAME="an_036_083">83</A>&nbsp;Therefor Glory be to Him in Whose hand is the dominion over all things!  Unto Him ye will be brought back.
