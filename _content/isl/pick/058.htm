<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">58. al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded</H1>
<A NAME="an_058_001">1</A>&nbsp;Allah hath heard the saying of her that disputeth with thee (Muhammad)  concerning her husband, and complaineth unto Allah. And Allah heareth your  colloquy. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_002">2</A>&nbsp;Such of you as put away your wives (by saying they are as their mothers) -  They are not their mothers; none are their mothers except those who gave them birth -  they indeed utter an ill word and a lie. And lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_003">3</A>&nbsp;Those who put away their wives (by saying they are as their mothers) and  afterward would go back on that which they have said, (the penalty) in that case (is)  the freeing of a slave before they touch one another. Unto this ye are exhorted; and  Allah is Informed of what ye do. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_004">4</A>&nbsp;And he who findeth not (the wherewithal), let him fast for two successive  months before they touch one another; and for him who is unable to do so (the  penance is) the feeding of sixty needy ones. This, that ye may put trust in Allah and  His messenger. Such are the limits (imposed by Allah); and for disbelievers is a  painful doom. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_005">5</A>&nbsp;Lo! those who oppose Allah and His messenger will be abased even as those  before them were abased; and We have sent down clear tokens, and for disbelievers is  a shameful doom </P>
<A NAME="an_058_006">6</A>&nbsp;On the day when Allah will raise them all together and inform them of what  they did. Allah hath kept account of it while they forgot it. And Allah is Witness over  all things. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_007">7</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not seen that Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is  in the earth ? There is no secret conference of three but He is their fourth, nor of five  but He is their sixth, nor of less than that or more but He is with them wheresoever  they may be; and afterward, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what  they did. Lo! Allah is Knower of all things. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_008">8</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not observed those who were forbidden conspiracy and afterward  returned to that which they had been forbidden, and (now) conspire together for crime  and wrongdoing and disobedience toward the messenger ? And when they come unto  thee they greet thee with a greeting wherewith Allah greeteth thee not, and say within  themselves: Why should Allah punish us for what we say ? Hell will suffice them;  they will feel the heat thereof - a hapless journey's end! </P>
<A NAME="an_058_009">9</A>&nbsp;O ye who believe! When ye conspire together, conspire not together for  crime and wrongdoing and disobedience toward the messenger, but conspire together  for righteousness and piety, and keep your duty toward Allah, unto whom ye will be  gathered. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_010">10</A>&nbsp;Lo! Conspiracy is only of the devil, that he may vex those who believe; but  he can harm them not at all unless by Allah's leave. In Allah let believers put their  trust. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_011">11</A>&nbsp;O ye who believe! when it is said unto you, Make room! in assemblies, then  make room; Allah will make way for you (hereafter). And when it is said, Come up  higher! go up higher; Allah will exalt those who believe among you, and those who  have knowledge, to high ranks. Allah is Informed of what ye do. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_012">12</A>&nbsp;O ye who believe! When ye hold conference with the messenger, offer an  alms before your conference. That is better and purer for you. But if ye cannot find  (the wherewithal) then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_013">13</A>&nbsp;Fear ye to offer alms before your conference ? Then, when ye do it not and  Allah hath forgiven you, establish worship and pay the poor-due and obey Allah and  His messenger. And Allah is Aware of what ye do. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_014">14</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not seen those who take for friends a folk with whom Allah is  wroth ? They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear a false oath knowingly. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_015">15</A>&nbsp;Allah hath prepared for them a dreadful doom. Evil indeed is that which they  are wont to do. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_016">16</A>&nbsp;They make a shelter of their oaths and turn (men) from the way of Allah; so  theirs will be a shameful doom. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_017">17</A>&nbsp;Their wealth and their children will avail them naught against Allah. Such  are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_018">18</A>&nbsp;On the day when Allah will raise them all together, then will they swear unto  Him as they (now) swear unto you, and they will fancy that they have some standing.  Lo! is it not they who are the liars ? </P>
<A NAME="an_058_019">19</A>&nbsp;The devil hath engrossed them and so hath caused them to forget  remembrance of Allah. They are the devil's party. Lo! is it not the devil's party who  will be the losers ? </P>
<A NAME="an_058_020">20</A>&nbsp;Lo! those who oppose Allah and His messenger, they will be among the  lowest. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_021">21</A>&nbsp;Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers. Lo!  Allah is Strong, Almighty. </P>
<A NAME="an_058_022">22</A>&nbsp;Thou wilt not find folk who believe in Allah and the Last Day loving those  who oppose Allah and His messenger, even though they be their fathers or their sons  or their brethren or their clan. As for such, He hath written faith upon their hearts and  hath strengthened them with a Spirit from Him, and He will bring them into Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide. Allah is well pleased with  them, and they are well pleased with Him. They are Allah's party. Lo! is it not Allah's  party who are the successful ?
