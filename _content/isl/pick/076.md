------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 76. ad-Dahr: The Man

<span id="an_076_001">1</span> Hath there come upon man (ever) any
period of time in which he was a thing unremembered ?

<span id="an_076_002">2</span> Lo! We create man from a drop of
thickened fluid to test him; so We make him hearing, knowing.

<span id="an_076_003">3</span> Lo! We have shown him the way, whether he
be grateful or disbelieving.

<span id="an_076_004">4</span> Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers
manacles and carcans and a raging fire.

<span id="an_076_005">5</span> Lo! the righteous shall drink of a cup
whereof the mixture is of Kafur,

<span id="an_076_006">6</span> A spring wherefrom the slaves of Allah
drink, making it gush forth abundantly,

<span id="an_076_007">7</span> (Because) they perform the vow and fear a
day whereof the evil is wide- spreading,

<span id="an_076_008">8</span> And feed with food the needy wretch, the
orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him,

<span id="an_076_009">9</span> (Saying): We feed you, for the sake of
Allah only. We wish for no reward nor thanks from you;

<span id="an_076_010">10</span> Lo! we fear from our Lord a day of
frowning and of fate.

<span id="an_076_011">11</span> Therefor Allah hath warded off from them
the evil of that day, and hath made them find brightness and joy;

<span id="an_076_012">12</span> And hath awarded them for all that they
endured, a Garden and silk attire;

<span id="an_076_013">13</span> Reclining therein upon couches, they
will find there neither (heat of) a sun nor bitter cold.

<span id="an_076_014">14</span> The shade thereof is close upon them and
the clustered fruits thereof bow down.

<span id="an_076_015">15</span> Goblets of silver are brought round for
them, and beakers (as) of glass

<span id="an_076_016">16</span> (Bright as) glass but (made) of silver,
which they (themselves) have measured to the measure (of their deeds).

<span id="an_076_017">17</span> There are they watered with a cup
whereof the mixture is of Zanjabil,

<span id="an_076_018">18</span> (The water of) a spring therein, named
Salsabil.

<span id="an_076_019">19</span> There wait on them immortal youths,
whom, when thou seest, thou wouldst take for scattered pearls.

<span id="an_076_020">20</span> When thou seest, thou wilt see there
bliss and high estate.

<span id="an_076_021">21</span> Their raiment will be fine green silk
and gold embroidery. Bracelets of silver will they wear. Their Lord will
slake their thirst with a pure drink.

<span id="an_076_022">22</span> (And it will be said unto them): Lo!
this is a reward for you. Your endeavour (upon earth) hath found
acceptance.

<span id="an_076_023">23</span> Lo! We, even We, have revealed unto thee
the Qur'an, a revelation;

<span id="an_076_024">24</span> So submit patiently to thy Lord's
command, and obey not of them any guilty one or disbeliever.

<span id="an_076_025">25</span> Remember the name of thy Lord at morn
and evening.

<span id="an_076_026">26</span> And worship Him (a portion) of the
night. And glorify Him through the livelong night.

<span id="an_076_027">27</span> Lo! these love fleeting life, and put
behind them (the remembrance of) a grievous day.

<span id="an_076_028">28</span> We, even We, created them, and
strengthened their frame. And when We will, We can replace them,
bringing others like them in their stead.

<span id="an_076_029">29</span> Lo! this is an Admonishment, that
whosoever will may choose a way unto his Lord.

<span id="an_076_030">30</span> Yet ye will not, unless Allah willeth.
Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise.

<span id="an_076_031">31</span> He maketh whom He will to enter His
mercy, and for evil-doers hath prepared a painful doom.
