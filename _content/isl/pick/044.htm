<A NAME="an_044_001">1</A>&nbsp;Ha. Mim. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_002">2</A>&nbsp;By the Scripture that maketh plain </P>
<A NAME="an_044_003">3</A>&nbsp;Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning - </P>
<A NAME="an_044_004">4</A>&nbsp;Whereon every wise command is made clear </P>
<A NAME="an_044_005">5</A>&nbsp;As a command from Our presence - Lo! We are ever sending - </P>
<A NAME="an_044_006">6</A>&nbsp;A mercy from thy Lord. Lo! He, even He is the Hearer, the Knower, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_007">7</A>&nbsp;Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye would  be sure. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_008">8</A>&nbsp;There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and giveth death; your Lord and  Lord of your forefathers. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_009">9</A>&nbsp;Nay, but they play in doubt. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_010">10</A>&nbsp;But watch thou (O Muhammad) for the day when the sky will produce  visible smoke </P>
<A NAME="an_044_011">11</A>&nbsp;That will envelop the people. This will be a painful torment. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_012">12</A>&nbsp;(Then they will say): Our Lord relieve us of the torment. Lo! we are  believers. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_013">13</A>&nbsp;How can there be remembrance for them, when a messenger making plain  (the Truth) had already come unto them, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_014">14</A>&nbsp;And they had turned away from him and said: One taught (by others), a  madman ? </P>
<A NAME="an_044_015">15</A>&nbsp;Lo! We withdraw the torment a little. Lo! ye return (to disbelief). </P>
<A NAME="an_044_016">16</A>&nbsp;On the day when We shall seize them with the greater seizure, (then) in truth  We shall punish. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_017">17</A>&nbsp;And verily We tried before them Pharaoh's folk, when there came unto them  a noble messenger, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_018">18</A>&nbsp;Saying: Give up to me the slaves of Allah. Lo! I am a faithful messenger  unto you. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_019">19</A>&nbsp;And saying: Be not proud against Allah. Lo! I bring you a clear warrant. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_020">20</A>&nbsp;And lo! I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to  death. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_021">21</A>&nbsp;And if ye put no faith in me, then let me go. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_022">22</A>&nbsp;And he cried unto his Lord, (saying): These are guilty folk. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_023">23</A>&nbsp;Then (his Lord commanded): Take away My slaves by night. Lo! ye will be  followed, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_024">24</A>&nbsp;And leave the sea behind at rest, for lo! they are a drowned host. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_025">25</A>&nbsp;How many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_026">26</A>&nbsp;And the cornlands and the goodly sites </P>
<A NAME="an_044_027">27</A>&nbsp;And pleasant things wherein they took delight! </P>
<A NAME="an_044_028">28</A>&nbsp;Even so (it was), and We made it an inheritance for other folk; </P>
<A NAME="an_044_029">29</A>&nbsp;And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_030">30</A>&nbsp;And We delivered the Children of Israel from the shameful doom; </P>
<A NAME="an_044_031">31</A>&nbsp;(We delivered them) from Pharaoh. Lo! he was a tyrant of the wanton ones. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_032">32</A>&nbsp;And We chose them, purposely, above (all) creatures. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_033">33</A>&nbsp;And We gave them portents wherein was a clear trial. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_034">34</A>&nbsp;Lo! these, forsooth, are saying: </P>
<A NAME="an_044_035">35</A>&nbsp;There is naught but our first death, and we shall not be raised again. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_036">36</A>&nbsp;Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the truth! </P>
<A NAME="an_044_037">37</A>&nbsp;Are they better, or the folk of Tubb'a and those before them ? We destroyed  them, for surely they were guilty. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_038">38</A>&nbsp;And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,  in play. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_039">39</A>&nbsp;We created them not save with truth; but most of them know not. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_040">40</A>&nbsp;Assuredly the Day of Decision is the term for all of them, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_041">41</A>&nbsp;A day when friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_042">42</A>&nbsp;Save him on whom Allah hath mercy. Lo! He is the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_043">43</A>&nbsp;Lo! the tree of Zaqqum, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_044">44</A>&nbsp;The food of the sinner! </P>
<A NAME="an_044_045">45</A>&nbsp;Like molten brass, it seetheth in their bellies </P>
<A NAME="an_044_046">46</A>&nbsp;As the seething of boiling water. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_047">47</A>&nbsp;(And it will be said): Take him and drag him to the midst of hell, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_048">48</A>&nbsp;Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_049">49</A>&nbsp;(Saying): Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble! </P>
<A NAME="an_044_050">50</A>&nbsp;Lo! this is that whereof ye used to doubt. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_051">51</A>&nbsp;Lo! those who kept their duty will be in a place secured. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_052">52</A>&nbsp;Amid gardens and watersprings, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_053">53</A>&nbsp;Attired in silk and silk embroidery, facing one another. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_054">54</A>&nbsp;Even so (it will be). And We shall wed them unto fair ones with wide, lovely  eyes. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_055">55</A>&nbsp;They call therein for every fruit in safety. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_056">56</A>&nbsp;They taste not death therein, save the first death. And He hath saved them  from the doom of hell, </P>
<A NAME="an_044_057">57</A>&nbsp;A bounty from thy Lord. That is the supreme triumph. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_058">58</A>&nbsp;And We have made (this Scripture) easy in thy language only that they may  heed. </P>
<A NAME="an_044_059">59</A>&nbsp;Wait then (O Muhammad). Lo! they (too) are waiting.
