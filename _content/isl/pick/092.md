# 92. al-Layl: The Night

<span id="an_092_001">1</span> By the night enshrouding

<span id="an_092_002">2</span> And the day resplendent

<span id="an_092_003">3</span> And Him Who hath created male and female,

<span id="an_092_004">4</span> Lo! your effort is dispersed (toward
divers ends).

<span id="an_092_005">5</span> As for him who giveth and is dutiful
(toward Allah)

<span id="an_092_006">6</span> And believeth in goodness;

<span id="an_092_007">7</span> Surely We will ease his way unto the
state of ease.

<span id="an_092_008">8</span> But as for him who hoardeth and deemeth
himself independent,

<span id="an_092_009">9</span> And disbelieveth in goodness;

<span id="an_092_010">10</span> Surely We will ease his way unto
adversity.

<span id="an_092_011">11</span> His riches will not save him when he
perisheth.

<span id="an_092_012">12</span> Lo! Ours it is (to give) the guidance

<span id="an_092_013">13</span> And lo! unto Us belong the latter
portion and the former.

<span id="an_092_014">14</span> Therefor have I warned you of the
flaming Fire

<span id="an_092_015">15</span> Which only the most wretched must
endure,

<span id="an_092_016">16</span> He who denieth and turneth away.

<span id="an_092_017">17</span> Far removed from it will be the
righteous

<span id="an_092_018">18</span> Who giveth his wealth that he may grow
(in goodness).

<span id="an_092_019">19</span> And none hath with him any favour for
reward,

<span id="an_092_020">20</span> Except as seeking (to fulfil) the
purpose of his Lord Most High.

<span id="an_092_021">21</span> He verily will be content.
