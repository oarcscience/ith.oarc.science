</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">4. <i>He Commands</i></h3>  
<p>It is in the Revelation that God makes known His sovereign will; what He has chosen for men and what He has forbidden.</p>  
<p><DIR>O believers, eat of the good things<br> wherewith We have provided you, and give thanks<br> to God, if it be Him that you serve.<br> These things only has He forbidden you:<br> carrion, blood, the flesh of swine,<br> what has been hallowed to other than God.<br> Yet whoso is constrained, not desiring<br> nor transgressing, no sin shall be on him;<br> God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.</p>  
<p>Those who conceal what of the Book God has sent down<br> on them, and sell it for a little price--they shall eat<br> naught but the Fire in their bellies; God shall not<br> speak to them on the Day of Resurrection<br> neither purify them; there awaits them<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;a painful chastisement.<br> Those are they that have bought error at<br> the price of guidance, and chastisement at<br> the price of pardon; how patiently they<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;shall endure the Fire!</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>That, because God has sent down the Book<br> with the truth; and those that are<br> at variance regarding the Book<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;are in wide schism.</p>  
<p>It is not piety, that you turn your faces<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;to the East and to the West.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;True piety is this:<br> to believe in God, and the Last Day,<br> the angels, the Book, and the Prophets,<br> to give of one's substance, however cherished,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;to kinsmen, and orphans,<br> the needy, the traveller, beggars,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and to ransom the slave,<br> to perform the prayer, to pay the alms.<br> And they who fulfill their covenant<br> when they have engaged in a covenant,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and endure with fortitude<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;misfortune, hardship and peril,<br> these are they who are true in their faith,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;these are the truly godfearing.</p>  
<p>O believers, prescribed for you is<br> retaliation, touching the slain;<br> freeman for freeman, slave for slave,<br> female for female. But if aught is pardoned<br> a man by his brother, let the pursuing<br> be honourable, and let the payment be<br> with kindliness. That is a lightening<br> granted you by your Lord, and a mercy;<br> and for him who commits aggression<br> after that--for him there awaits<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;a painful chastisement.<br> In retaliation there is life for you,<br> men possessed of minds; haply you<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;will be godfearing. (2:172-179)</p>  
<p>O believers, prescribed for you is<br> the Fast, even as it was prescribed for</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>those that were before you--haply you<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;will be godfearing--<br> for days numbered; and if any of you<br> be sick, or if he be on a journey,<br> then a number of other days; and for those<br> who are able to fast, a redemption<br> by feeding a poor man. Yet better<br> it is for him who volunteers good,<br> and that you should fast is better for you,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;if you but know;<br> the month of Ramadan, wherein the Koran<br> was sent down to be a guidance<br> to the people, and as clear signs<br> of the Guidance and the Salvation.<br> So let those of you, who are present<br> at the month, fast it; and if any of you<br> be sick, or if he be on a journey,<br> then a number of other days; God desires<br> ease for you, and desires not hardship<br> for you; and that you fulfil the number, and<br> magnify God that He has guided you, and haply<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;you will be thankful. (2:183-185)</p>  
<p>Permitted to you, upon the night of<br> the Fast, is to go in to your wives;<br> they are a vestment for you, and you are<br> a vestment for them. God knows that you have been<br> betraying yourselves, and has turned to you<br> and pardoned you. So now lie with them,<br> and seek what God has prescribed for you.<br> And eat and drink, until the white thread<br> shows clearly to you from the black thread<br> at the dawn; then complete the Fast<br> unto the night, and do not lie with them<br> while you cleave to the mosques. Those are<br> God's bounds; keep well within them. So God<br> makes clear His signs to men; haply they<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;will be godfearing.</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>Consume not your goods between you<br> in vanity; neither proffer it<br> to the judges, that you may sinfully<br> consume a portion of other men's goods,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and that wittingly. (2:187-188)</p>  
<p>And fight in the way of God with those<br> who fight with you, but aggress not: God loves<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;not the aggressors.<br> And slay them wherever you come upon them,<br> and expel them from where they expelled you;<br> persecution is more grievous than slaying.<br> But fight them not by the Holy Mosque<br> until they should fight you there;<br> then, if they fight you, slay them--<br> such is the recompense of unbelievers--<br> but if they give over, surely God is<br> All-forgiving, All-compassionate.<br> Fight them, till there is no persecution<br> and the religion is God's; then if they<br> give over, there shall be no enmity<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;save for evildoers.<br> The holy month for the holy month;<br> holy things demand retaliation.<br> Whoso commits aggression against you,<br> do you commit aggression against him<br> like as he has committed against you;<br> and fear you God, and know that God is<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;with the godfearing.</p>  
<p>And expend in the way of God;<br> and cast not yourselves by your own hands<br> into destruction, but be good-doers; God<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;loves the good-doers.</p>  
<p>Fulfil the Pilgrimage and the Visitation<br> unto God; but if you are prevented,<br> then such offering as may be feasible.<br> And shave not your heads, till the offering</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>reaches its place of sacrifice. If any<br> of you is sick, or injured in his head,<br> then redemption by fast, or freewill offering,<br> or ritual sacrifice. When you are secure,<br> then whosoever enjoys the Visitation<br> until the Pilgrimage, let his offering<br> be such as may be feasible; or if he<br> finds none, then a fast of three days<br> in the Pilgrimage, and of seven when<br> you return, that is ten completely;<br> that is for him whose family are not<br> present at the Holy Mosque. And fear<br> God, and know that God is terrible<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;in retribution. (2:190-196)</p>  
<p>Prescribed for you is fighting, though it be<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;hateful to you.<br> Yet it may happen that you will hate a thing<br> which is better for you; and it may happen that you<br> will love a thing which is worse for you; God knows,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and you know not.</p>  
<p>They will question thee concerning<br> the holy month, and fighting in it.<br> Say: "Fighting in it is a heinous thing,<br> but to bar from God's way, and disbelief in Him,<br> and the Holy Mosque, and to expel its people<br> from it--that is more heinous in God's sight;<br> and persecution is more heinous than slaying."<br> They will not cease to fight with you,<br> till they turn you from your religion,<br> if they are able; and whosoever of you<br> turns from his religion, and dies disbelieving--<br> their works have failed in this world and the next;<br> those are the inhabitants of the Fire; therein<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they shall dwell forever.<br> But the believers, and those who emigrate<br> and struggle in God's way--those have hopes of</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>God's compassion; and God is All-forgiving,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;All-compassionate.</p>  
<p>They will question thee concerning<br> wine, and arrow-shuffling. Say: "In both<br> is heinous sin, and uses for men,<br> but the sin in them is more heinous<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;than the usefulness."</p>  
<p>They will question thee concerning<br> what they should expend. Say: "The abundance."<br> So God makes clear His signs to you; haply<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;you will reflect;<br> in this world, and the world to come.</p>  
<p>They will question thee concerning<br> the orphans. Say: "To set their affairs<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;aright is good.<br> And if you intermix with them, they are<br> your brothers. God knows well<br> him who works corruption from him<br> who sets aright; and had He willed<br> He would have harassed you. Surely God is<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;All-mighty, All-wise."</p>  
<p>Do not marry idolatresses, until<br> they believe; a believing slavegirl<br> is better than an idolatress, though<br> you may admire her. And do not marry<br> idolaters, until they believe. A believing<br> slave is better than an idolater, though<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;you may admire him.<br> Those call unto the Fire; and God calls unto<br> Paradise, and pardon, by His leave, and He<br> makes clear His signs to the people; haply<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they will remember.</p>  
<p>They will question thee concerning<br> the monthly course. Say: "It is hurt;<br> so go apart from women during<br> the monthly course, and do not approach them</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>till they are clean. When they have cleansed<br> themselves, then come unto them as God<br> has commanded you." Truly, God loves<br> those who repent, and He loves those<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;who cleanse themselves.<br> Your women are a tillage for you; so come<br> unto your tillage as you wish, and forward<br> for your souls; and fear God, and know that<br> you shall meet Him. Give thou good tidings<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;to the believers.</p>  
<p>Do not make God a hindrance, through your oaths,<br> to being pious and godfearing, and putting<br> things right between men. Surely God is<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;All-hearing, All-knowing.<br> God will not take you to task for a slip<br> in your oaths; but He will take you to task<br> for what your hearts have earned; and God is<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;All-forgiving, all-clement. (2:216-225)</p>  
<p>Such of your women as commit indecency,<br> call four of you to witness against them;<br> and if they witness, then detain them<br> in their houses until death takes them<br> or God appoints for them a way.<br> And when two of you commit indecency,<br> punish them both; but if they repent<br> and make amends, then suffer them to be;<br> God turns, and is All-compassionate.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> (4:15-16)</p>  
<p>O believers, draw not near to prayer<br> when you are drunken until you know<br> what you are saying, or defiled--unless<br> you are traversing a way--until you<br> have washed yourselves; but if you are<br> sick, or on a journey, or if any of you<br> comes from the privy, or you have touched<br> women, and you can find no water,</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>then have recourse to wholesome dust<br> and wipe your faces and your hands; God is<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;All-pardoning, All-forgiving. (4:43)</p>  
<p>This is the recompense of those who fight<br> against God and His Messenger,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and hasten<br> about the earth, to do corruption there:<br> they shall be slaughtered, or crucified,<br> or their hands and feet shall alternately<br> be struck off, or they shall be banished<br> from the land. That is a degradation for them<br> in this world; and in the world to come awaits them<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;a mighty chastisement,<br> except for such as repent, before you<br> have power over them. So know you that<br> God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.</p>  
<p>O believers, fear God, and seek the means<br> to come to Him, and struggle in His way;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;haply you will prosper. (6:33-35)</p>  
<p>The fornicatress and the fornicator--<br> scourge each one of them a hundred stripes,<br> and in the matter of God's religion<br> let no tenderness for them seize you<br> if you believe in God and the Last Day;<br> and let a party of the believers<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;witness their chastisement.<br> The fornicator shall marry none but<br> a fornicatress or an idolatress,<br> and the fornicatress--none shall marry her<br> but a fornicator or an idolator;<br> that is forbidden to the believers.</p>  
<p>And those who cast it up on women in<br> wedlock, and then bring not four witnesses,<br> scourge them with eighty stripes, and do not<br> accept any testimony of theirs ever; those--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they are the ungodly,</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>save such as repent thereafter and<br> make amends; surely God is All-forgiving,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;All compassionate.<br> And those who cast it up on their wives<br> having no witnesses except themselves,<br> the testimony of one of them shall be<br> to testify by God four times that he<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;is of the truthful.<br> and a fifth time, that the curse of<br> God shall be upon him, if he should<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;be of the liars.<br> It shall avert from her the chastisement<br> if she testify by God four times that he<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;is of the liars.<br> and a fifth time, that the wrath of<br> God shall be upon her, if he should<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;be of the truthful. (23:2-9)</p>  
<p>And be thou not loud in thy prayer,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;nor hushed therein,<br> but seek thou for a way between that.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And say:<br> "Praise belongs to God, who has not<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;taken to Him a son,<br> and who has not any associate in the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Kingdom,<br> nor any protector out of humbleness."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And magnify Him<br> With repeated magnificats. (17:110-111)</DIR></p>
