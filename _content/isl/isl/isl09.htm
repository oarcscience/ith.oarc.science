<p><DIR>When the sun shall be darkened,<br> when the stars shall be thrown down,<br> when the mountains shall be set moving,<br> when the pregnant camels shall be neglected,<br> when the savage beasts shall be mustered,<br> when the seas shall be set boiling,</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>when the souls shall be coupled,<br> when the buried infant shall be asked for what sin she was<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;slain,<br> when the scrolls shall be unrolled,<br> when the heavens shall be stripped off,<br> when Hell shall be set blazing,<br> when Paradise shall be brought nigh,<br> then shall a soul know what it has produced.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;No! I swear by the slinkers,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;the runners, the sinkers,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;by the night swarming,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;by the dawn sighing,<br> truly this is the word of a noble Messenger<br> having power, with the Lord of the Throne secure,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;obeyed, moreover trusty. (81:1-21)</p>  
<p>So, when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast<br> and the earth and the mountains are lifted up and<br> crushed with a single blow,<br> then, on that day, the Terror shall come to pass,<br> and heaven shall be split, for upon that day it<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;shall be very frail,<br> and the angels shall stand upon its borders, and<br> upon that day eight shall carry above them the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Throne of thy Lord.<br> On that day you shall be exposed, not one secret<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;of yours concealed.<br> Then as for him who is given his book in his right hand,<br> he shall say, "Here, take and read my book! Certainly<br> I thought that I should encounter my reckoning." So he<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;shall be in a pleasing life<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;in a lofty Garden,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;its clusters nigh to gather.<br> "Eat and drink with wholesome appetite for that you did<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;long ago, in the days gone by."<br> But as for him who is given his book in his left hand,<br> he shall say, "Would that I had not been given my book<br> and not known by reckoning! Would it had been the end!</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>&nbsp;&nbsp;My wealth has not availed me,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;my authority is gone from me."<br> Take him, and fetter him, and then roast him in Hell,<br> then in a chain of seventy cubits' length insert him!<br> Behold, he never believed in God the All-mighty, and<br> he never urged the feeding of the needy; therefore he<br> today has not here one loyal friend, neither any food<br> saving foul pus, that none excepting the sinners eat. (69:13-37)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Terror descends<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;(and none denies its descending)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;abasing, exalting,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;when the earth shall be rocked<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and the mountains crumbled<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and become a dust scattered,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and you shall be three bands--</p>  
<p>Companions of the Right (O Companions of the Right!)<br> Companions of the Left (O Companions of the Left!)<br> and the Outstrippers: the Outstrippers<br> those are they brought nigh the Throne,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;in the Gardens of Delight<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;(a throng of the ancients<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and how few of the later folk)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;upon close-wrought couches<br> reclining upon them, set face to face,<br> immortal youth going round about them<br> with goblets, and ewers, and a cup from a spring<br> (no brows throbbing, no intoxication)<br> and such fruits as they shall choose,<br> and such flesh of fowl as they desire,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and wide-eyed houris<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;as the likeness of hidden pearls,<br> a recompense for that they laboured.<br> Therein they shall hear no idle talk, no cause of sin,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;only the saying "Peace, Peace!"</p>  
<p>The Companions of the Right (O Companions of the Right!)<br> mid thornless lote-trees and serried acacias,</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>and spreading shade and outpoured waters,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and fruits abounding<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;unfailing, unforbidden,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and upraised couches.<br> Perfectly We formed them, perfect,<br> and We made them spotless virgins,<br> chastely amorous, like of age<br> for the Companions of the Right.<br> A throng of the ancients<br> and a throng of the later folk.</p>  
<p>The Companions of the Left (O Companions of the Left!)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;mid burning winds and boiling waters<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and the shadow of a smoking blaze<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;neither cool, neither goodly;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and before that they lived at ease,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and persisted in the Great Sin,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;ever saying,<br> "What, when we are dead and become<br> dust and bones, shall we indeed<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;be raised up?<br> What, and our fathers, the ancients?"</p>  
<p>Say: "The ancients, and the later folk<br> shall be gathered to the appointed time<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;of a known day.<br> Then you erring ones, you that cried lies,<br> you shall eat of a tree called Zakkoum,<br> and you shall fill therewith your bellies<br> and drink on top of that boiling water<br> lapping it down like thirsty camels."<br> This shall be their hospitality on the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Day of Doom. (56:1-56)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By the loosed ones successively<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;storming tempestuously<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;by the scatters scattering<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and the severally severing</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>&nbsp;&nbsp;and those hurling a reminder<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;excusing or warning,<br> Surely that which you are promised is about to fall!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stars shall be extinguished,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;when heaven shall be split<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;when the mountains shall be scattered<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and when the Messengers' time is set,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;to what day shall they be delayed?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;to the Day of Decision.<br> And what shall teach thee what is the Day of Decision?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Woe that day unto those who cry it lies!</p>  
<p>Did We not destroy the ancients,<br> and then follow them with the later folk?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;So We serve the sinners.<br> Woe that day unto those who cry it lies!</p>  
<p>Did We not create you of a mean water,<br> that We laid within a sure lodging<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;till a known term decreed?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A><br> We determined; excellent determiners are We.<br> Woe that day unto those who cry it lies!</p>  
<p>Made We not the earth to be a housing<br> for the living and for the dead?<br> Set We not therein soaring mountains?<br> Sated you with sweetest water?<br> Woe that day unto those who cry it lies!</p>  
<p>Depart to that you cried was lies!<br> Depart to a triple-massing shadow<br> unshading against the blazing flame<br> that shoots sparks like dry faggots,<br> sparks like to golden herds.<br> Woe that day unto those who cry it lies!</p>  
<p>This is the day they shall not speak<br> neither be given leave, and excuse themselves.<br> Woe that day unto those who cry it lies!<br> "This is the Day of Decision; We have joined you with the ancients;</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>if you have a trick, try you now to trick Me!"<br> Woe that day unto those who cry it lies!</p>  
<p>Truly the godfearing shall dwell amid shades and fountains,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and such fruits as their hearts desire:<br> "Eat and drink, with wholesome appetite, for<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;that you were working."<br> Even so do We recompense the good-doers.<br> Woe that day unto those who cry it lies!</p>  
<p>"Eat and take your joy a little; you are sinners!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Woe that day unto those who cry it lies!</p>  
<p>When it is said to them, "Prostrate yourselves!" they prostrate not.<br> Woe that day unto those who cry it lies!</p>  
<p>In what discourse after this will they believe? (77:1-50)</DIR></p>
