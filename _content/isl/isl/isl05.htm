</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">1. <i>God Speaks to Man</i></h3>  
<p>The first words of the "S&#363;ra (chapter) of the Clot" are the first which were revealed to Muhammad. The section</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>which follows the "S&#363;ra of the Clot" here is the opening portion of the second and longest chapter of the Qur&#8217;&#257;n, the "S&#363;ra of the Cow." It thus forms a sort of introduction to the Book as a whole.</p>  
<p><DIR>Recite: In the Name of thy Lord who created,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;created Man of a blood-clot.</p>  
<p>Recite: And thy Lord is the Most Generous,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;who taught by the Pen.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;taught Man that he knew not.</p>  
<p>No indeed; surely Man waxes insolent,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;for he thinks himself self-sufficient.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Surely unto thy Lord is the Returning.</p>  
<p>What thinkest thou? He who forbids<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;a servant when he prays--</p>  
<p>What thinkest thou? If he were upon guidance<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;or bade to godfearing--<br> What thinkest thou? If he cries lies, and turns away--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Did he not know that God sees?</p>  
<p>No indeed; surely, if he gives not over,<br> We shall seize him by the forelock,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;a lying, sinful forelock.<br> So let him call on his concourse!<br> We shall call on the guards of Hell.</p>  
<p>No indeed; do thou not obey him,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and bow thyself, and draw nigh. (96:1-19)</DIR></p>  
<p align="center"><i>Alif Lam Mim</i></p>  
<p><DIR>This is the Book, wherein is no doubt,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;a guidance to the godfearing<br> who believe in the Unseen, and perform the prayer,<br> and expend of what We have provided them;<br> who believe in what has been sent down to thee</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>and what has been sent down before thee,<br> and have faith in the Hereafter;<br> those are upon guidance from their Lord,<br> those are the ones who prosper.</p>  
<p>As for the unbelievers, alike it is to them<br> whether thou hast warned them or hast not warned them,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they do not believe.<br> God has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and on their eyes is a covering,<br> and there awaits them a mighty chastisement.</p>  
<p>And some men there are who say,<br> "We believe in God and the Last Day";<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;but they are not believers.<br> They would trick God and the believers,<br> and only themselves they deceive,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and they are not aware.<br> In their hearts is a sickness,<br> and God has increased their sickness,<br> and there awaits them a painful chastisement<br> for that they have cried lies.<br> When it is said to them, "Do not corruption in the land,"<br> they say, "We are only ones that put things right."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Truly, they are the workers of corruption<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;but they are not aware.<br> When it is said to them, "Believe as the people believe,"<br> they say, "Shall we believe, as fools believe?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Truly, they are the foolish ones,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;but they do not know.<br> When they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe";<br> but when they go privily to their Satans, they say,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"We are with you; we were only mocking."<br> God shall mock them, and shall lead them on<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;blindly wandering in their insolence.<br> Those are they that have bought error<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;at the price of guidance,<br> and their commerce has not profited them,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and they are not right-guided.</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>The likeness of them is as the likeness of a man<br> who kindled a fire, and when it lit all about him<br> God took away their light, and left them in darkness<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;unseeing,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;deaf, dumb, blind--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;so they shall not return;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;or as a cloudburst out of heaven<br> in which is darkness, and thunder, and lightning--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they put their fingers in their ears<br> against the thunderclaps, fearful of death;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and God encompasses the unbelievers;<br> the lightning wellnigh snatches away their sight;<br> whensoever it gives them light, they walk in it,<br> and when the darkness is over them, they halt;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;had God willed, He would have taken away<br> their hearing and their sight.<br> Truly, God is powerful over everything.<br> O you men, serve your Lord who created you,<br> and those that were before you; haply so<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;you will be godfearing;<br> who assigned to you the earth for a couch,<br> and heaven for an edifice, and sent down<br> out of heaven water, wherewith He brought forth<br> fruits for your provision; so set not up<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;compeers to God wittingly.<br> And if you are in doubt concerning that We have<br> sent down on Our servant, then bring one <i>s&#363;ra</i><br> like it, and call your witnesses, apart from<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;God, if you are truthful.<br> And if you do not--and you will not--then<br> fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;prepared for unbelievers.</p>  
<p>Give thou good tidings to those who believe<br> and do deeds of righteousness, that for them<br> await gardens underneath which rivers flow;<br> whensoever they are provided with fruits therefrom<br> they shall say, "This is that wherewithal<br> we were provided before"; that they shall be</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>given in perfect semblance; and there<br> for them shall be spouses purified; therein<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they shall dwell forever. (2:1-25)</p>  
<p>Blessed be He in whose hand is the Kingdom--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He is powerful over everything--<br> who created death and life, that He might try you<br> which of you is fairest in works; and He is<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;the All-mighty, the All-forgiving-<br> who created seven heavens one upon another.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou seest not in the creation<br> of the All-merciful any imperfection.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Return thy gaze; seest thou any fissure?<br> Then return thy gaze again, and again, and thy gaze comes<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;back to thee dazzled, aweary.<br> And we adorned the lower heaven with lamps, and made them<br> things to stone Satans; and We have prepared for them<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;the chastisement of the Blaze.</p>  
<p>And for those who disbelieve in their Lord<br> there awaits the chastisement of Gehenna--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;an evil homecoming! (67:1-7)</DIR></p>  
<p>The story of the Garden of Eden is similar to that contained in Genesis; however, the doctrine of Original Sin is not accepted in Islam. Adam's fall is not seen as a sin, but an error in judgment, and has not tainted the human race with its consequences. From the Creation, man has made a contract to serve God.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Alif Lam Mim Sad</i></p>  
<p><DIR>&nbsp;&nbsp;A Book sent down to thee--<br> so let there be no impediment in thy breast<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;because of it--<br> to warn thereby, and as a reminder to believers:</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>Follow what has been sent down to you from your<br> Lord, and follow no friends other than He; little<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;do you remember.<br> How many a city We have destroyed! Our might came<br> upon it at night, or while they took their ease<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;in the noontide,<br> and they but cried, when Our might came upon them,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"We were evildoers."<br> So we shall question those unto whom a Message was sent,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and We shall question the Envoys,<br> And We shall relate to them with knowledge; assuredly<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;We were not absent.<br> The weighing that day is true; he whose scales are heavy--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they are the prosperers,<br> and he whose scales are light--they have lost their souls<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;for wronging Our signs.</p>  
<p>We have established you in the earth<br> and there appointed for you livelihood;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;little thanks you show.<br> We created you, then We shaped you,<br> then We said to the angels: "Bow yourselves<br> to Adam"; so they bowed themselves,<br> save Iblis--he was not of those<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;that bowed themselves.<br> Said He, "What prevented thee to<br> bow thyself, when I commanded thee?"<br> Said he, "I am better than he; Thou<br> createdst me of fire, and him Thou<br> createdst of clay."<br> Said He, "Get thee down out of it;<br> it is not for thee to wax proud here,<br> so go thou forth; surely thou art<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;among the humbled."<br> Said he, "Respite me till the day<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they shall be raised."<br> Said He, "Thou art among the ones<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;that are respited."<br> Said he, "Now, for Thy perverting me,</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>I shall surely sit in ambush for them<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;on Thy straight path;<br> then I shall come on them from before them<br> and from behind them, from their right hands<br> and their left hands; Thou wilt not find<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;most of them thankful."<br> Said He, "Go thou forth from it, despised<br> and banished. Those of them that follow<br> thee--I shall assuredly fill Gehenna<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;with all of you."</p>  
<p>"O Adam, inherit, thou and thy wife,<br> the Garden, and eat of where you will,<br> but come not nigh this tree, lest you be<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;of the evildoers."<br> Then Satan whispered to them, to reveal<br> to them that which was hidden from them<br> of their shameful parts. He said, "Your Lord<br> has only prohibited you from this tree<br> lest you become angels, or lest you<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;become immortals."<br> And he swore to them, "Truly, I am for you<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;a sincere adviser."<br> So he led them on by delusion; and when<br> they tasted the tree, their shameful parts<br> revealed to them, so they took to stitching<br> upon themselves leaves of the Garden.<br> And their Lord called to them, "Did not I<br> prohibit you from this tree, and say<br> to you, 'Verily Satan is for you<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;a manifest foe'?"<br> They said, "Lord, we must have wronged ourselves,<br> and if Thou dost not forgive us, and<br> have mercy upon us, we shall surely be<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;among the lost."<br> Said He, "Get you down, each of you<br> an enemy to each. In the earth a sojourn<br> shall be yours, and enjoyment<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;for a time."</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_23"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 23</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>Said He, "Therein you shall live, and<br> therein you shall die, and from there you<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;shall be brought forth." (7:1-24)</p>  
<p>And when thy Lord took from the Children of Adam,<br> from their loins, their seed, and made them testify<br> touching themselves, "Am I not your Lord?"<br> They said, "Yes, we testify--lest you should say<br> on the Day of Resurrection, 'As for us, we<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;were heedless of this,'<br> or lest you say, 'Our fathers were idolaters<br> aforetime, and we were seed after them.<br> What, wilt Thou then destroy us for the deeds<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;of vain-doers?'"</p>  
<p>So We distinguish the signs; and haply<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they will return.</p>  
<p>And recite to them the tidings of him to whom<br> We gave Our signs, but he cast them off,<br> and Satan followed after him, and he became<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;one of the perverts.<br> And had We willed, We would have raised him up<br> thereby; but he inclined towards the earth<br> and followed his lust. So the likeness of him<br> is as the likeness of a dog; if thou attackest it<br> it lolls its tongue out, or if thou leavest it<br> it lolls its tongue out. That is that people's likeness<br> who cried lies to Our signs. So relate the story;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;haply they will reflect.<br> An evil likeness is the likeness of<br> the people who cried lies to Our signs, and<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;themselves were wronging.<br> Whomsoever God guides,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;he is rightly guided;<br> and whom He leads astray--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they are the losers.<br> We have created for Gehenna<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;many jinn and men;</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>they have hearts, but understand<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;not with them;<br> they have eyes, but perceive<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;not with them;<br> they have ears, but they hear<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;not with them.<br> They are like cattle; nay, rather<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they are further astray.<br> Those--they are the heedless.<br> To God belong the Names Most Beautiful;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;so call Him by them,<br> and leave those who blaspheme His Names--<br> they shall assuredly be recompensed<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;for the things they did. (7:172-180)</DIR></p>  
<p>The Qur&#8217;&#257;n repeatedly reminds man that he is surrounded with the evidences of Divine handiwork; it expresses astonishment that he can nevertheless be so blind as not to remember the Creator.</p>  
<p><DIR><DIR>God's command comes;<br> so seek not to hasten it.<br> Glory be to Him!</DIR></DIR></p>  
<p><DIR>High be He exalted above that they associate with Him!<br> He sends down the angels with the Spirit of His command<br> upon whomsoever He will among His servants, saying:</DIR></p>  
<p><DIR><DIR>Give you warning<br> that there is no God but I;<br> so fear you Me!</DIR></DIR></p>  
<p><DIR>He created the heavens and the earth in truth;<br> high be He exalted above that they associate with Him!<br> He created man of a sperm-drop; yet, behold,<br> he is a manifest adversary. And the cattle--<br> He created them for you; in them is warmth, and uses<br> various, and of them you eat, and there is beauty</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>in them for you, when you bring them home to rest<br> and when you drive them forth abroad to pasture;<br> and they bear your loads unto a land that you<br> never would reach, excepting with great distress.<br> Surely your Lord is All-clement, All-compassionate.<br> And horses, and mules, and asses, for you to ride,<br> and as an adornment; and He creates what you know not.</DIR></p>  
<p><DIR><DIR>God's it is to show the way;<br> and some do swerve from it.<br> If He willed, He would have<br> guided you all together.</DIR></DIR></p>  
<p><DIR>It is He who sends down to you out of heaven water<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;of which you have to drink,<br> and of which trees, for you to pasture your herds,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and thereby He brings forth<br> for you crops, and olives, and palms, and vines,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and all manner of fruit.<br> Surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect.<br> And He subjected to you the night and day, and<br> the sun and moon; and the stars are subjected<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;by His command.<br> Surely in that are signs for a people who understand.<br> And that which He has multiplied for you in the earth<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;of diverse hues.<br> Surely in that is a sign for a people who remember.<br> It is He who subjected to you the sea, that you<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;may eat of it<br> fresh flesh, and bring forth out of it ornaments<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;for you to wear;<br> and thou mayest see the ships cleaving through it;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and that you may seek<br> of His bounty, and so haply you will be thankful.<br> And He cast on the earth firm mountains, lest it<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;shake with you,<br> and rivers and ways; so haply you will be guided;<br> and waymarks; and by the stars they are guided.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is He who creates as<br> he who does not create? Will you not remember?</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>If you count God's blessing, you will never number it;<br> surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And God knows what you keep secret<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and what you publish.<br> And those they call upon, apart from God,<br> created nothing, and themselves are created,<br> dead, not alive, and not aware when<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;they shall be raised.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Your God is One God.<br> And they who believe not in the world to come,<br> their hearts deny, and they have waxed proud.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Without a doubt God<br> knows what they keep secret<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;and what they publish;<br> He loves not those that wax proud.
