<p>Eastern Iran had been hospitable to &#7776;&#363;fism, and with the development of Persian vernacular literature from the eleventh century onward, &#7776;&#363;f&#299; poets made an immortal</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A></p>  
<p>contribution to Islamic literature. This was particularly true wherever Persian became the literary language--chiefly those areas where Arabic was not (Persia, Turkey, India, Central Asia), and with the devastation of the Eastern Islamic world by the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century and the career of T&#299;m&#363;r (Tamerlane) in the fourteenth this tendency became stronger; &#7776;&#363;fism succeeded in offering men a vision of beauty and some consolation in an exceedingly chaotic and cruel time, and some of Persia's greatest poets wrote in the age of the Mongols.</p>  
<p>A younger eleventh-century contemporary of Ab&#363; Sa&#8216;&#299;d ibn Ab&#299; Khayr was &#8216;Abdallah al-An&#7777;&#257;r&#299; (died A.H. 481/A.D. 1088), the patron saint of Herat in Khurasan. P&#299;r-i-An&#7777;&#257;r, as he is better known, composed the earliest Persian devotional poetry known, though not all the verses ascribed to him by later generations are his.</p>

<p><i>Far&#299;d al-D&#299;n &#8216;A&#7789;&#7789;&#257;r</i>: A native of Nishapur, &#8216;A&#7789;&#7789;&#257;r is usually believed to have perished in Genghis Khan's invasion of Khurasan, in A.H. 617/A.D. 1220. He was a druggist, who collected the sayings and teachings of &#7776;&#363;f&#299; saints, and is credited with a very considerable literary output. His Persian poems show great story-telling ability, as well as devotion to the memory of al-&#7716;all&#257;j and, in common with other later Persian mystic poets, a clear pantheistic bias. It is not always clear how much of this is conviction, and how much poetic license; how much philosophy, and how much edifying literature; the poets and their admirers frequently found it advisable to leave that undefined. The following is the culmination of his long mystical epic, <i>Man&#7789;iq al-&#7788;ayr</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ibn al-F&#257;ri&#7693;</i>: A contemporary and friend of Ibn al-&#8216;Arab&#299; was &#8216;Umar ibn al-F&#257;ri&#7693; of Cairo (died A.H. 632/A.D. 1235), the greatest mystical poet who wrote in Arabic, the only one who can compare to the great Persian Stiff poets. He was venerated as a saint during his lifetime, and like other mystics is said to have written as the result of ecstatic inspiration. His odes, like those of St. John of the Cross, are tender and rapturous addresses to God as Absolute Beauty; at times, his imagery seems almost Keatsian.</p>

<p><i>Jal&#257;l al-D&#299;n R&#363;m&#299;</i>: R&#363;m&#299; (died 1273), the theologian of Persian poetry, came of an East Persian family which emigrated to Konya, the Salj&#363;q capital of Muslim Anatolia (Ram), shortly before the Mongol invasions devastated Persia and Iraq. As it passed through Nishapur, the family is said to have visited the aged &#8216;A&#7789;&#7789;&#257;r, who predicted the infant Jal&#257;l al-D&#299;n's future greatness.</p>  
<p>In Konya, Jal&#257;l al-D&#299;n succeeded his father as professor in a madrasa, or college for training of <i>&#8216;ulam&#257;&#8217;</i>. Already something of a &#7776;&#363;f&#299;, he came under the powerful influence of the &#7776;&#363;f&#299; Shams al-D&#299;n Tabr&#299;z&#299;, who visited Konya and who played Socrates to R&#363;m&#299;'s Plato. R&#363;m&#299; left off teaching and became a changed man. His devotion to this eccentric and enthusiastic friend and master out-raged his disciples, and they forced Tabr&#299;z&#299; to leave the city. At the pleading of R&#363;m&#299; he twice returned, and was finally killed by an angry mob. In acknowledgment of the debt he owed him, R&#363;m&#299; called his own collection of poems (<i>Diw&#257;n</i>), The Diw&#257;n of Shams-i-Tabr&#299;z.</p>  
<p>But R&#363;m&#299;'s greatest work is his <i>Mathnav&#299;</i>, "The Qur&#8217;&#257;n of the Persian Language," a vast poem containing fables, allegories and reflections on &#7776;&#363;f&#299; thought. While it has little artistic unity, being apparently written in periods of inspiration over a long space of time, it is a poetic work of unquestioned genius, erudition and deep religious feeling.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A></p>  
<p>R&#363;m&#299; also founded the Mawl&#257;w&#299; or Mevlevi brother-hood, the "Whirling Dervishes," whose mystical dance in the <i>sam&#257;&#8216;</i>, to recall the order of the heavenly spheres, is a sedate gyrating. Sections of the <i>Mathnav&#299;</i> or the <i>Diw&#257;n</i> such as the superb opening "Song of the Reed Flute," from the <i>Mathnav&#299;</i>, which plaintively tells of the soul's longing for God, the Source of its existence, were chanted at these sessions.</p>

<p><i>J&#257;m&#299;</i>: The Mongols were driven from Iran by the terrible T&#299;m&#363;r (Tamerlane) in the fourteenth century--a Transoxanian Turk who was as great a catastrophe for the Muslim lands he ravaged as the early Mongols had ever</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A></p>  
<p>been. However, in the fifteenth century his descendants, the T&#299;m&#363;r&#299; dynasty in Eastern Persia, patronized a brilliant revival of Persian-Islamic culture, the "T&#299;m&#363;r&#299; Renaissance." One of the chief ornaments of the T&#299;m&#363;r&#299; court in Herat was the last great mystical poet to write in Persian, Mulla N&#363;r al-D&#299;n &#8216;Abd al-Rahm&#257;n J&#257;m&#299; (died A.H. 898/A.D. 1492). By 1507 the wild Uzbeks of Central Asia had destroyed the T&#299;m&#363;r&#299; power (although a prince of the T&#299;m&#363;r&#299; line was to found the Great Mughal dynasty of Delhi).</p>  
<p>A practicing mystic, deeply influenced by the ideas of Ibn al-&#8216;Arab&#299;, J&#257;m&#299; was also a scholar, a biographer and a poet of great and varied accomplishment.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Notwithstanding his piety and mysticism, J&#257;m&#299; had a sharp tongue and was ready at repartee. Thus on one occasion he was repeating with fervour the line:</p>

<p>His Beauty everywhere doth show itself,<br> And through the forms of earthly beauties shines<br> Obscured as through a veil.
