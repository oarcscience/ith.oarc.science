<P>Jesus answered: 'Believe me when God chose me to send me to the house of Israel, he gave me a book like unto a clear mirror which came down into my heart in such wise that all that I speak cometh forth from that book. And when that book shall have finished coming forth from my mouth, I shall be taken up from the world.'</P>

<P>Said Peter: 'Is there written therein the glory of paradise?'</P>
