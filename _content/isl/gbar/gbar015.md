### 15. Miracle wrought by Jesus at the marriage, turning the water into wine.

When the feast of tabernacles was nigh, a certain rich man invited Jesus
with his disciples and his mother to a marriage. Jesus therefore went,
and as they were feasting the wine ran short. His mother accosted Jesus,
saying: 'They have no wine.' Jesus answered: 'What is that to me, mother
mine?' His mother commanded the servants that whatever Jesus should
command them they should obey. There were there six vessels for water
according to the custom of Israel to purify themselves for prayer. Jesus
said: 'Fill these vessels with water.' The servants did so. Jesus said
unto them: 'In the name of God, give to drink unto them that are
feasting.' The servants thereupon bare unto the master of the
ceremonies, who rebuked the attendants saying: 'O worthless servants,
why have ye kept the better wine till now?' For he knew nothing of all
that Jesus had done.

The servants answered: 'O sir, there is here a holy man of God, for he
hath made of water, wine.' The master of the ceremonies thought that the
servants were drunken; but they that were sitting near to Jesus, having
seen the whole matter, rose from the table and paid him reverence,
saying: 'Verily thou art an holy one of God, a true prophet sent to us
from God!'

Then his disciples believed on him, and many returned to their heart,
saying: 'Praised be God, who hath mercy upon Israel, and visited the
house of Judah with love, and blessed be his holy name.
