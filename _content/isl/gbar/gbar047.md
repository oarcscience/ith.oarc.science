### 47.

Jesus went down, in the second year of his prophetic ministry, from
Jerusalem, and went to Nain. Whereupon, as he drew nigh to the gate of
the city, the citizens were bearing to the sepulchre the only son of his
mother, a widow, over whom every one was weeping. Whereupon, when Jesus
had arrived, the men understood how that Jesus, a prophet of Galilee,
was come: and so they set themselves to beseech him for the dead man,
that he being a prophet should raise him up; which also his disciples
did. Then Jesus feared greatly, and turning himself to God, said: 'Take
me from the world, O Lord, for the world is mad, and they wellnigh call
me God!' And having said this, he wept.

Then came the angel Gabriel, and said: 'O Jesus, fear not, for God hath
given thee power over every infirmity, insomuch that all that thou shalt
grant in the name of God shall be entirely accomplished.' Hereupon Jesus
gave a sigh, saying: 'Thy will be done, Lord God almighty and merciful.
' And having said this, he drew near to the mother of the dead, and with
pity said to her: 'Woman, weep not,' And having taken the hand of the
dead, he said: 'I say unto thee, young man, in the name of God arise up
healed!'

Then the boy revived, whereupon all were filled with fear, saying: 'God
hath raised up a great prophet amongst us, and he hath visited his
people.'
