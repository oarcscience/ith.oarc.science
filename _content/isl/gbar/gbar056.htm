<P>'God shall open the book in the hand of his messenger, and his messenger reading therein shall call all the angels and prophets and all the elect, and on the forehead of each one shall be written the mark of the messenger of God. And in the book shall be written the glory of paradise.</P>

<P>'Then shall each pass to the right hand of God; next to whom shall sit the messenger of God, and the prophets shall sit near him, and the saints, and the angel shall then sound the trumpet, and shall call Satan to judgment.</P>
