### 58.

While Jesus was speaking the disciples wept bitterly. And Jesus wept
many tears.

Then after he had wept, John spake: O master, two things we desire to
know. The one is, how it is possible that the messenger of God, who is
full of mercy and pity, should have no pity on reprobates that day,
seeing that they are of the same clay as himself? The other is, how is
it to be understood that the sword of Michael is heavy as ten hells then
is there more than one hell?' Jesus replied: 'Have ye not heard what
David the prophet saith how that the just shall laugh at the destruction
of sinners, and shall deride him with these words, saying: "I saw the
man who put his hope in his strength and his riches, and forgot God."
Verily, therefore, I say unto you, that Abraham shall deride his father,
and Adam all reprobate men: and this shall be because the elect, shall
rise again so perfect and united to God that they shall not conceive in
their minds the smallest thought against his justice; therefore shall
each of them demand justice, and above all the messenger of God. As God
liveth, in whose presence I stand, though now I weep for pity of
mankind, on that day I shall demand justice without mercy against those
who despise my words, and most of all against those who defile my
gospel.
