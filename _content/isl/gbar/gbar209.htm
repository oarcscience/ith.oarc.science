<H3>209.</H3>

<P>At this time, while the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus, was standing in prayer, the angel Gabriel visited her and narrated to her the persecution of her son, saying: 'Fear not, Mary, for God will protect him from the world.' Wherefore Mary, weeping, departed from Nazareth, and came to Jerusalem to the house of Mary Salome, her sister, seeking her son.</P>

<P>But since he had secretly retired beyond the brook Cedron she was not able to see him any more in this world; save after the deed of shame, for that the angel Gabriel, with the angels Michael, Rafael, and Uriel, by command of God brought him to her.</P>
