### 6. Three magi are led by a star in the east to Judaea, and, finding Jesus, make obeisance to him and gifts.

In the reign of Herod, king of Judaea, when Jesus was born, three magi
in the parts of the east were observing the stars of heaven. Whereupon
appeared to them a star of great brightness, wherefore having concluded
among themselves, they came to Judaea, guided by the star, which went
before them, and having arrived at Jerusalem they asked where was born
the King of the Jews. And when Herod heard this he was affrighted, and
all the city was troubled. Herod therefore called together the priests
and the scribes, saying: 'Where should Christ be born?' They answered
that he should be born in Bethlehem; for thus it is written by the
prophet: 'And thou, Bethlehem, art not little among the princes of
Judah: for out of thee shall come forth a leader, who shall lead my
people Israel.'

Herod accordingly called together the magi and asked them concerning
their coming: who answered that they had seen a star in the east, which
had guided them thither, wherefore they wished with gifts to worship
this new King manifested by his star.

Then said Herod: 'Go to Bethlehem and search out with all diligence
concerning the child; and when ye have found him, come and tell it to
me, because I also would fain come and worship him.' And this he spake
deceitfully.
