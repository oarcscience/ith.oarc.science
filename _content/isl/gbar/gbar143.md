### 143.

Then came all the disciples to Damascus, by the will of God. And on that
day Judas the traitor, more than any other, made show of having suffered
grief at Jesus' absence. Wherefore Jesus said: 'Let every one beware of
him who without occasion laboureth to give thee tokens of love.'

And God took away our understanding, that we might not know to what end
he said this.

After the coming of all the disciples, Jesus said: 'Let us return into
Galilee, for thus hath the angel of God said unto me, that I needs must
go thither.' Whereupon, one sabbath morning, Jesus came to Nazareth.
When the citizens recognized Jesus, everyone disired to see him.
Whereupon a publican, by name Zacchaeus, who was of small stature, not
being able to see Jesus by reason of the great multitude, climbed to the
top of a sycamore, and there waited for Jesus to pass that place when he
went to the synagogue. Jesus then, having come to that place, lifted up
his eyes and said: 'Come down, Zacchaeus, for to-day I will abide in thy
house.'

The man came down and received him with gladness, making a splendid
feast.

The Pharisees murmured, saying to Jesus' disciples: 'Wherefore is your
master gone in to eat with publicans and sinners?'

Jesus answered: 'For what cause doth the physician \[enter\] into an
house? Tell me, and I will tell you wherefore I am come in hither.' They
answered: 'To heal the sick.'

'Ye say the truth,' said Jesus, 'for the whole have no need of medicine,
only the sick.'
