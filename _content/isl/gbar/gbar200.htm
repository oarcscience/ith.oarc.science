<P>Jesus then turned to Lazarus, and said: 'Brother, I must needs for a short time abide in the world, wherefore when I shall be near to thine house I will not ever go elsewhere, because thou wilt minister unto me, not for love of me, but for love of God.'</P>

<P>It was nigh unto the Passover of the Jews, wherefore Jesus said to his disciples: 'Let us go to Jerusalem to eat the paschal lamb.' And he sent Peter and John to the city, saying: 'Ye shall find an ass near the gate of the city with a colt, loose her and bring her hither; for I needs must ride thereon into Jerusalem. And if anyone ask you saying, "Wherefore loose ye her?" say unto them: "The Master hath need thereof," and they will suffer thee to bring her.'</P>

<P>The disciples went, and found all that Jesus had told them and accordingly they brought the ass and the colt. The disciples accordingly placed their mantles upon the colt, and Jesus rode thereon. And it came to pass that, when the men of Jerusalem heard that Jesus of Nazareth was coming, the men went forth with their children eager to see Jesus, bearing in their hands branches of palm and olive, singing: 'Blessed be he that cometh to us in the name of God. Hosanna, son of David!'</P>

<P>Jesus having come into the city, the men spread out their garments under the feet of the ass, singing: 'Blessed be he that cometh to us in the name of the Lord God; hosanna, son of David!'</P>

<P>The Pharisees rebuked Jesus, saying: 'Seest thou not what these say? Cause them to hold their peace!'</P>

<P>Then said Jesus: 'As God liveth in whose presence my soul standeth, if men should hold their peace, the stones would cry out against the unbelief of malignant sinners.' And when Jesus had said this all the stones of Jerusalem cried out with a great noise: 'Blessed be he who cometh to us in the name of the Lord God!'</P>

<P>Nevertheless the Pharisees remained still in their unbelief, and, having assembled themselves together, took counsel to catch him in his talk.</P>
