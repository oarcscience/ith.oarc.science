<H3>194.</H3>

<P>The scribes and Pharisees took counsel with the high priest to slay Lazarus; for many renounced their traditions and believed in the word of Jesus, because the miracle of Lazarus was a great one, seeing that Lazarus had conversation with men, and ate and drank. But because he was powerful, having a following in Jerusalem, and possessing with his sister Magdala and Bethany, they knew not what to do.</P>

<P>Jesus entered into Bethany, into the house of Lazarus, and Martha, with Mary, ministered unto him.</P>

<P>Mary, sitting one day at the feet of Jesus, was listening to his words, whereupon Martha said to Jesus: 'Lord, seest thou not that my sister taketh no care for thee, and provideth not that which thou must eat and thy disciples?'</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'Martha, Martha, do thou take thought for that which thou shouldst do; for Mary hath chosen apart which shall not be taken away from her for ever.</P>

<P>Jesus, sitting at a table with a great multitude that believed in him, spake, saying: 'Brethren, I have but little time to remain with you, for the time is at hand that I must depart from the world. Wherefore I bring to your mind the words of God spoken to Ezekiel the prophet, saying: "As I, your God, live eternally, the soul that sinneth, it shall die, but if the sinner shall repent he shall not die but live."</P>

<P>'Wherefore the present death is not death, but rather the end of a long death: even as the body when separated from the sense in a swoon, though it have the soul within it, hath no other advantage over the dead and buried save this, that the buried [body] awaiteth God to raise it again, but the unconscious waiteth for the sense to return.</P>

<P>'Behold, then, the present life that it is death, through having no perception of God.</P>
