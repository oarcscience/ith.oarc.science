<H3>72.</H3>

<P>At night Jesus spake in secret with his disciples, saying: 'Verily I say unto you that Satan desireth to sift you as wheat; but I have besought God for you, and there shall not perish of you save he that layeth snares for me.' And this he said of Judas, because the angel Gabriel said to him how that Judas had hand with the priests, and reported to them all that Jesus spake.</P>

<P>With tears drew near unto Jesus he who writeth this, saying: 'O master, tell me, who is he that should betray thee?'</P>

<P>Jesus answered, saying: 'O Barnabas, this is not the hour for thee to know him, but soon will the wicked one reveal himself, because I shall depart from the world.'</P>

<P>Then wept the apostles, saying: 'O master, wherefore wilt thou forsake us? It is much better that we should die than be forsaken of thee!'</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'Let not your heart be troubled, neither be ye fearful: for I have not created you, but God our creator who hath created you will protect you. As for me, I am now come to the world to prepare the way for the messenger of God, who shall bring salvation to the world. But beware that ye be not deceived, for many false prophets shall come, who shall take my words and contaminate my gospel.'</P>

<P>Then said Andrew: 'Master, tell us some sign, that we may know him.'</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'He will not come in your time, but will come some years after you, when my gospel shall be annulled, insomuch that there shall be scarcely thirty faithful. At that time God will have mercy on the world, and so he will send his messenger, over whose head will rest a white cloud, whereby he shall be known of one elect of God, and shall be by him manifested to the world. He shall come with great power against the ungodly, and shall destroy idolatry upon the earth. And it rejoiceth me because that through him our God shall be known and glorified, and I shall be known to be true; and he will execute vengeance against those who shall say that I am more than man. Verily I say to you that the moon shall minister sleep to him in his boyhood, and when he shall be grown up he shall take her in his hands. Let the world beware of casting him out because he shall slay the idolaters, for many more were slain by Moses, the servant of God, and Joshua, who spared not the cities which they burnt, and slew the children; for to an old wound one applieth fire.</P>

<P>'He shall come with truth more clear than that of all the prophets, and shall reprove him who useth the world amiss. The towers of the city of our father shall greet one another for joy: and so when idolatry shall be seen to fall to the ground and confess me a man like other men, verily I say unto you the messenger of God shall be come.'</P>
