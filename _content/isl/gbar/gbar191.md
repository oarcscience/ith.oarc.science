### 191.

The scribe then said: 'Pardon me, O master, for I have sinned.'

Said Jesus: 'God pardon thee; for against him hast thou sinned.'

Whereupon said the scribe: 'I have seen an old book written by the hand
of Moses and Joshua (he who made the sun stand still as thou hast done),
servants and prophets of God, which book is the true book of Moses.
Therein is written that Ishmael is the father of Messiah, and Isaac the
father of the messenger of the Messiah. And thus saith the book, that
Moses said: "Lord God of Israel, mighty and merciful, manifest to thy
servant the splendour of thy glory. Whereupon God showed him his
messenger in the arms of Ishmael, and Ishmael in the arms of Abraham.
Nigh to Ishmael stood Isaac, in whose arms was a child, who with finger
pointed to the messenger of God, saying: "This is he for whom God hath
created all things." 'Whereupon Moses cried out with joy: "O Ishmael,
thou hast in thine arms all the world, and paradise! Be mindful of me,
God's servant, that I may find grace in God's sight by means of thy son,
for whom God hath made all."
