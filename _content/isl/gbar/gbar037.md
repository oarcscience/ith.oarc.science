### 37.

The disciples wept at the words of Jesus and besought him, saying:
'Lord, teach us to make prayer.'

Jesus answered: 'Consider what ye would do if the Roman governor seized
you to put you to death, and that same do ye when ye go to make prayer.
And let your words be these: "O Lord our God, hallowed be thy holy name,
thy kingdom come in us, thy will be done always, and as it is done in
heaven so be it done in earth; give us the bread for every day, and
forgive us our sins, as we forgive them that sin against us, and suffer
us not to fall into temptations, but deliver us from evil, for thou art
alone our God, to whom pertaineth glory and honour for ever.'
