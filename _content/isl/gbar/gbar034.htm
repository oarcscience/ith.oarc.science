<P>There stood before the door one who had his right hand shrunken in such fashion that he could not use it. Whereupon Jesus, having lift up his heart to God, prayed, and then said: 'In order that ye may know that my words are true, I say, "In the name of God, man, stretch out thine infirm hand."' He stretched it out whole, as if it had never had aught ill with it.</P>

<P>Then with fear of God they began to eat. And having eaten somewhat, Jesus said again: 'Verily I say unto you, that it were better to burn a city than to leave there an evil custom. For on account of such is God wroth with the princes and kings of the earth, to whom God hath given the sword to destroy iniquities.'</P>

<P>Afterwards said Jesus: 'When thou are invited, remember not to set thyself in the highest place, in order that if a greater friend of the host come the host say not unto thee: "Arise and sit lower down!" which were a shame to thee. But go and sit in the meanest place, in order that he who invited thee may come and say: "Arise, friend, and come and sit here, above!" For then shalt thou have great honour: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</P>

<P>'Verily I say unto you, that Satan became not reprobate for other sin than for his pride. Even as saith the prophet Isaiah, reproaching him with these words: "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, that wert the beauty of the angels, and didst shine like the dawn: truly to earth is fallen thy pride!"</P>

<P>'Verily I say unto you, that if a man knew his miseries, he would always weep here on earth and account himself most mean, beyond every other thing. For no other cause did the first man with his wife weep for a hundred years without ceasing, craving mercy of God, for they knew truly whither they had fallen through their pride.'</P>

<P>And having said this, Jesus gave thanks; and that day it was published through Jerusalem how great things Jesus had said, with the miracle he had wrought, insomuch that the people gave thanks to God blessing his holy name.</P>

<P>But the scribes and priests, having understood that he spake against the traditions of the elders, were kindled with greater hatred. And like Pharaoh they hardened their heart; wherefore they sought occasion to slay him, but found it not.</P>
