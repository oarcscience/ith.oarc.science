### 5. Circumcision of Jesus.

When the eight days were fulfilled according to the law of the Lord, as
it is written in the book of Moses, they took the child and carried him
to the temple to circumcise him. And so they circumcised the child, and
gave him the name Jesus, as the angel of the Lord had said before he was
conceived in the womb. Mary and Joseph perceived that the child must
needs be for the salvation and ruin of many. Wherefore they feared God,
and kept the child with fear of God.
