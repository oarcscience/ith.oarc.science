<P>
Not many primary Shiite texts were translated into
English during the 19th century.
The following are translations of Shiite documents,
prepared by a volunteer for sacred-texts [TJ].
The views expressed are those of the translator, and the
translations are presented without any editing.
The copyright status of these texts is dubious, so these files
are made available here for research purposes only, not for republication.
