<p>1. O camel-driver, turn aside at Sal&#8216; and halt by the <i>b&aacute;n</i> tree of al-Mudarraj,</p>  
<p>2. And call to them, imploring their pity and grace, 'O my princes, have ye any consolation?'</p>  
<p>3. At R&aacute;ma, between an-Naq&aacute; and &#7716;&aacute;jir, is a girl enclosed in a howdah.</p>  
<p>4. Oh, her beauty&#8212;the tender maid! Her fairness gives light like lamps to one travelling in the dark.</p>  
<p>5. She is a pearl hidden in a shell of hair as black as jet,</p>  
<p>6. A pearl for which reflection dives and remains unceasingly in the deeps of that ocean.</p>  
<p>7. He who looks upon her deems her to be a gazelle of the</p>  
<p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A></p>  
<p>sand-hills because of her neck and the loveliness of her gestures.</p>  
<p>8. &#8217;Tis as though she were the morning sun in Aries, crossing the degrees of the zodiac at their farthest height.</p>  
<p>9. If she lifts her veil or uncovers her face, she holds cheap the rays of the bright dawn.</p>  
<p>10. I called to her, between the guarded pasture and R&aacute;ma, 'Who will help a man that alighted at Sal&#8216; in good hope?</p>  
<p>11. Who will help a man lost in a desert, dismayed, confounded in his wits, miserable?</p>  
<p>12 Who will help a man drowned in his tears, intoxicated by the wine of passion for those well-set teeth?</p>  
<p>13. Who will help a man burned by his sighs, distraught by the beauty of those spacious eyebrows?'</p>  
<p>14. The hands of Love have played at their will with his heart, and he commits no sin in that which he seeks.</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'Halt by the <i>b&aacute;n</i> tree of al-Mudarraj': he says, addressing the Divine messenger which calls the aspirations that seek to know and behold Him, 'Appear to me in the station of self-subsistence and lovingkindness gradually (###), not suddenly, lest I perish.'</p>  
<p>2. 'And call to them,' i.e. to the Divine Names.</p>  
<p>3. 'R&aacute;ma,' one of the stations of abstraction and isolation.</p>  
<p>'Between an-Naq&aacute; and &#7716;&aacute;jir,' between the white hill and the most inaccessible veil, to which the hearts of mystics can never attain.</p>  
<p>'A girl enclosed in a howdah,' i.e. the Essential Knowledge contained in the hearts of some gnostics.</p>  
<p>4. 'To one travelling in the dark,' i.e. to those who ascend and journey in the night (like the Prophet).</p>  
<p>6. God is beyond the reach of mental effort; He is revealed by Divine favour to a heart empty of all thoughts.</p>  
<p>8. 'Crossing the degrees of the zodiac,' etc., in reference to the magnification and glory which the seer feels in himself as he continues to contemplate her.</p>  
<p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></A></p>  
<p>10. 'Sal&#8216;,' one of the stations of Divine sanctity.</p>  
<p>12. 'In his tears,' i.e. in the knowledge that comes of contemplation.</p>  
<p>'Wine,' i.e. every science that inspires joy and rapture in the human soul, e.g. the science of the Divine perfection.</p>  
<p>'Those well-set teeth,' i.e. the grades of knowledge of God.</p>  
<p>13. 'Those spacious eyebrows,' i.e. the station between the two Waz&iacute;rs and Im&aacute;ms. He alludes to the station of the Qu&#7789;b.</p>
