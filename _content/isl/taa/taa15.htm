<p>1. At Dh&uacute; Salam and the monastery in the abode of al-&#7716;im&aacute;, are gazelles who show thee the sun in the forms of marble statues.</p>  
<p>2. Therefore I watch spheres and serve in a church and guard a many-coloured meadow in the spring.</p>  
<p>3. And at one time I am called the herdsman of the gazelles in the desert, and at another time I am called a Christian monk and an astrologer.</p>  
<p>4. My Beloved is three although He is One, even as the (three) Persons (of the Trinity) are made one Person in essence.</p>  
<p>5. So be not displeased, O friend, that I speak of gazelles that move round the marble statues as 'a shining sun',</p>  
<p>6. Or that I use metaphorically the necks of the gazelles, the face of the sun, and the breast and wrist of the white statue,</p>  
<p>7. Just as I have lent to the branches (spiritual) endowments and to the meadows moral qualities, and to the lightning laughing lips.</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'Dh&uacute; Salam': a station to which submission is rendered on account of its beauty.</p>  
<p>'The monastery,' referring to a Syrian ecstasy (###).</p>  
<p>'The abode of al-&#7716;im&aacute;,' that which surrounds the most inaccessible veil of Divine glory.</p>  
<p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></A></p>  
<p>'Gazelles,' i.e. forms of Divine and prophetic wisdom which descend upon his spirit.</p>  
<p>'Marble statues,' i.e. sorts of knowledge (###) with which neither reason nor lust is connected; hence he makes them inanimate (###).</p>  
<p>2. 'I watch spheres,' i.e. the spiritual states in which these sorts of knowledge revolve, like the sun.</p>  
<p>'And serve in a church,' because marble effigies are found in churches.</p>  
<p>'And guard,' etc.: the meadows where these gazelles pasture are the scenes of devotional acts and Divine morals; they are described as 'many-coloured', i.e. adorned with the Divine realities, and spring-like, because that which is new and fresh is more delightful to the soul.</p>  
<p>3. He refers to his ever-changing spiritual states, which bring with them manifold Divine influences and sciences. Although the spiritual experiences vary, the Divine substance (###) remains one. This is the 'transformation' (###) of which Muslim speaks in the chapter on Faith<A HREF="errata.htm#0">.</A> Those who worship God in the sun behold a sun, and those who worship Him in living things see a living thing, and those who worship Him in inanimate objects see an inanimate object, and those who worship Him as a Being unique and unparalleled see that which has no like.</p>  
<p>4. He says, 'Number does not beget multiplicity in the Divine substance, as the Christians declare that the Three Persons of the Trinity are One God, and as the Koran declares (xvii, 110): "<i>Call on God or call on the Merciful; howsoever ye invoice Him, it is well, for to Him belong the most excellent Names</i>."' The cardinal Names in the Koran are three, viz. Allah and ar-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n and ar-Rabb, by which One God is signified, and the rest of the Names serve as epithets of those three.</p>  
<p>6. 'Necks,' indicating the Light (###), as in the Tradition 'The muezzins shall be the longest-necked of mankind on the Day of Resurrection'.</p>  
<p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></A></p>  
<p>'The face of the sun,' as in the Tradition 'Ye shall see your Lord as ye see the sun'.</p>  
<p>'The breast and wrist of the white statue,' as in the Tradition which mentions the breast and fore-arm of the Almighty.</p>  
<p>7. 'The branches,' i.e. the souls distraught by the majesty of God and turned away by love from the consciousness of their personality and from the contemplation of their phenomenal nature.</p>  
<p>'The meadow,' i.e. the station of union (###) in which God has placed them.</p>  
<p>'Moral qualities,' i.e. the scented breaths of Divine Mercy, viz. the goodly praise (###) of the kind mentioned in the Tradition 'Even as Thou dost praise Thyself'.</p>  
<p>'The lightning,' i.e. a manifestation of the Divine Essence.</p>  
<p>'Laughing lips,' as God is said in the Tradition to rejoice at the repentance of His servant, or to laugh (###).</p>
