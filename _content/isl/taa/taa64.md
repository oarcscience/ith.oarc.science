*The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq*, by Ibn al-Arabi, tr. Reynold A. Nicholson,
\[1911\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### LXI

1\. O *bán* tree of the valley, on the bank of the river of Baghdád!

2\. A mournful dove that cooed on a swaying bough filled me with grief
for thee.

3\. His plaintive song reminds me of the plaintive song of the lady of
the chamber.

4\. Whenever she tunes her triple chords, thou must forget the brother
of al-Hádí.

5\. And if she lavishes her melody, who is Anjasha the camel-driver?

6\. I swear by Dhu ’l-Khaḍimát and then by Sindád

7\. That I am passionately in love with Salmá, who dwells at Ajyád.

8\. No; I am mistaken: she dwells in the black clot of blood in the
membrane of my liver.

9\. Beauty is confounded by her, and odours of musk and saffron are
scattered abroad.
