<p>The author says: A dervish recited to me the following verse, to which I knew not any brother&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>'Everyone who hopes for thy bounty receives copious showers thereof; thy lightning never breaks its promise of rain except with me.'</small></div></p>  
<p>I admired its application and pursued its meaning, and I composed some verses in the same rhyme, including this verse among them on account of its perfection, and I said in answer to that dervish (may God have mercy on him!) as follows:&#8212;</p>  
<p>1. Halt by the ruined abodes at La&#8216;la&#8216; and mourn for our loved ones in that wilderness.</p>  
<p>2. Halt by thy dwelling-places and call to them, wondering at their loneliness, with exquisite lamentation.</p>  
<p>3. 'Beside thy <i>b&aacute;n</i> tree I have seen many a one like myself plucking the fruit of comely forms and the roses of a verdant meadow.</p>  
<p>4. Everyone who hopes for thy bounty receives copious showers thereof; thy lightning never breaks its promise of rain except with me.'</p>  
<p>5. She said, 'Yes; there hath been that meeting in the shadow of my boughs in the most plenteous spot,</p>  
<p>6. When my lightning was one of the lightnings of smiling mouths; but to-day my lightning is the flash of this brilliant stone.</p>  
<p>7. Reproach, then, a fate which we had no means of averting: what is the fault of the camping-place at La&#8216;la&#8216;?'</p>  
<p>8. I excused her when I heard her speech and how she was complaining even as I complain with a sorrowful heart,</p>  
<p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="green">p. 97</font></A></p>  
<p>9. And I asked her, when I saw her demesne, through which the four winds sweep at night,</p>  
<p>10. 'Did their winds tell thee where they rested at noontide?' She said, 'Yes; they rested at Dh&aacute;t al-Ajra&#8216;,</p>  
<p>11. Where the white tents are radiant with those rising suns within.'</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'The ruined abodes,' i.e. the vestiges of the dwelling-places of the Divine Names in the hearts of gnostics.</p>  
<p>'In that wilderness,' i.e. in his empty heart.</p>  
<p>3. 'Plucking the fruit of comely forms,' i.e. the manifold knowledge of the Divine Self-subsistence (###) with which, according to our doctrine, it is possible to be invested. This investiture (###) is a matter of dispute amongst the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s; Ibn Junayd al-Ifr&iacute;q&iacute; and his followers consider that it is not correct.</p>  
<p>'The roses of a verdant meadow,' referring to the station of Shame (###), which results from meditation and contemplation.</p>  
<p>4. 'Thy lightning never breaks its promise,' etc., i.e. through the lack of Divine favour (###). He also indicates that he himself is in a lofty station which was not reached by any of his peers, because the lightning is a <i>locus</i> of manifestation for the Essence, and from this <i>locus</i> the soul of the seer gains no knowledge, inasmuch as it is a manifestation devoid of material form.</p>  
<p>6. 'When my lightning,' etc., i.e. that manifestation took place in a lovely form, but my manifestation to thee is formless and inanimate (####) and is not determined by love and passion.</p>  
<p>11. 'The white tents,' in reference to the veils of light which are drawn over the splendours of the face of God.</p>
