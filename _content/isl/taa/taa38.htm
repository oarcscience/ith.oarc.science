<p>1. Three full moons, unadorned by any ornament, went forth to at-Tan&#8216;&iacute;m with veiled faces.</p>  
<p>2. They unveiled shining faces like suns and cried with a loud voice 'Labbayka', visiting the holy shrines.</p>  
<p>3. And they approached, walking slowly as the <i>qa&#7789;&aacute;</i> birds walk, in gowns of striped Yemen cloth.</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. Three Divine Names went forth from the Divine Presence to at-Tan&#8216;&iacute;m, desiring to manifest their traces, i.e. their bliss (###) consists in such manifestation. 'With veiled faces,' lest anyone who was unable to endure the sight of their splendour should behold them and perish.</p>  
<p>2. 'They unveiled,' i.e. in the heart that was prepared to receive them.</p>  
<p>'The holy shrines,' i.e. this noble heart.</p>  
<p>3. 'In gowns of striped Yemen cloth,' i.e. graced by the subordinate Names which attended them like priests.</p>
