<p>1. O driver of the reddish-white camels, do not hasten with them, but stop! for I am a cripple going after them.</p>  
<p>2. Stop the camels and tighten their reins! I beseech thee by God, by my passion, by my anguish, O driver!</p>  
<p>3. My soul is willing, but my foot does not second her. Who will pity and help me?</p>  
<p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A></p>  
<p>4. What shall the skilled craftsman do in a case where his tools have declared themselves to be working mischief?</p>  
<p>5. Turn aside, for their tents are on the right of the valley. God bless thee, O valley, for what thou containest!</p>  
<p>6. Thou hast collected a folk who are my soul and my breath and the inmost core of the black clot in the membrane of my liver.</p>  
<p>7. May my love be unblest if I do not die of grief at &#7716;&aacute;jir or Sal&#8216; or Ajy&aacute;d!</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. The Divine Spirit which speaks in Man and is charged with the governance of this body says to the camel-driver, i.e. to God's summoner who guides the lofty aspirations in their journey heavenward, 'Do not hasten with them, for I am hampered by this body to which I am tied until death.'</p>  
<p>3. 'Who will pity and help me?' He refers to the decree of God (###).</p>  
<p>4. He says, 'What shall I do? Though I am able to quit the body at times, i.e. in moments of passing away and absence (###) under the influence of ecstasy, my aim is to depart entirely; and, moreover, at such moments the sensible world exercises a powerful attraction upon me. This attraction (here called "his tools") spoils what I am endeavouring to do, and disturbs my state of passing away and absence in order to bring me back to the body.'</p>  
<p>5. 'Their tents,' i.e. the abodes of these aspirations, which are, in their knowledge of God, not in God, since He is not a <i>locus</i> for anything. Knowledge of God is the utmost goal to which contingent being can attain, and the whole universe depends on knowledge and on nothing else.</p>  
<p>'On the right of the valley,' referring to the occasion when God spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai (Kor. xix, 53).</p>  
<p>'What thou containest,' i.e. Divine, holy, and Mosaic kinds of knowledge.</p>  
<p>7. '&#7716;&aacute;jir,' i.e. the intermediate world (###).</p>  
<p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></A></p>  
<p>'Sal&#8216;,' a mountain near Medina, i.e. the station of Mu&#7717;ammad.</p>  
<p>'Ajy&aacute;d,' a mountain near Mecca, i.e. a Divine station which causes me to pass away from all phenomenal existence.</p>
