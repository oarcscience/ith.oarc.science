*The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq*, by Ibn al-Arabi, tr. Reynold A. Nicholson,
\[1911\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### LVII

1\. O breeze of the wind, bear to the gazelles of Najd this message: 'I
am faithful to the covenant which ye know.'

2\. And say to the young girl of the tribe, 'Our trysting-place is at
the guarded pasture beside the hills of Najd on the Sabbath morn,

3\. On the red hill towards the cairns and on the right hand of the
rivulets and the solitary landmark.'

4\. And if her words be true and she feel the same tormenting desire for
me as I feel

5\. For her, then we shall meet covertly in the heat of noon at her tent
with the most inviolable troth,

6\. And she and I will communicate what we suffer of love and sore
tribulation and grievous pain.

7\. Is this a vague dream or glad tidings revealed in sleep or the
speech of an hour in whose speech was my happy fortune?

8\. Perchance he who brought the objects of desire (into my heart) will
bring them face to face with me, and their gardens will bestow on me the
gathered roses.

#### COMMENTARY

1\. 'O breeze of the wind,' i.e. the subtle spiritual sense which
gnostics use as a medium of communication.

'The gazelles of Najd,' i.e. the exalted spirits.

2\. 'The young girl of the tribe,' i.e. the spirit especially akin to
himself.

3\. 'The red hill,' i.e. the station of beauty, since red is the fairest
of all the colours.

'The solitary landmark,' i.e. the Divine singleness (\#\#\#), which is
inferior to oneness (\#\#\#).

5\. 'In the heat of noon,' i.e. in the station of equilibrium (\#\#\#).

7\. 'Is this a vague dream?' (cf. Kor. xii, 44), i.e. this union is
impossible, for my spirit cannot escape from the corporeal world.
