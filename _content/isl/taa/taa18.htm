<p>1. They left me at al-Uthayl and an-Naq&aacute; shedding tears and complaining of the fire (that consumed me).</p>  
<p>2. My father be the ransom of him for whose sake I melted with anguish! My father be the ransom of him for whose sake I died of fear!</p>  
<p>3. The blush of shame on his cheek is the whiteness of dawn conversing with the redness of eve.</p>  
<p>4. Patience decamped and grief pitched tents, and I lie prostrate between these two.</p>  
<p>5. Who will compose my distracted thoughts? Who will relieve my pain? Guide me to him! Who will ease my sorrow? Who will help a passionate lover?</p>  
<p>6. Whenever I keep secret the torments of desire, my tears betray the flame within and the sleeplessness.</p>  
<p>7. And whenever I say, 'Give me one look!' the answer is, 'Thou art not hindered but for pity's sake.'</p>  
<p>8. It cannot be that one look from them will avail thee. Is it aught but the glimpse of a levin that flashed?</p>  
<p>9. I am not forgetting the time when the camel-driver, wishing for separation and seeking al-Abraq, urged them on.</p>  
<p>10. The ravens of separation croaked at them&#8212;may God not preserve a raven that croaked!</p>  
<p>11. The raven of separation is only a camel which carried away the loved ones with a swift wide-stepping pace.</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. He laments the departure of his companions, viz. the spiritual angelic beings who suffer no natural bondage, whilst he is left a prisoner in this body, occupied with governing it and prevented from wandering freely through the celestial spheres.</p>

<p>'Al-Uthayl,' his natural constitution (###).</p>  
<p>'An-Naq&aacute;,' his body.</p>  
<p>2. 'My father,' i.e. the Highest Spirit (###) which is his real father in the world above and his phenomenal mother in the world below.</p>  
<p>'Of him for whose sake I melted with anguish': he refers to the Divine mystery contained in his heart.</p>  
<p>'Of fear,' i.e. fear of the radiance of the Divine majesty.</p>  
<p>6. The love that is revealed is stronger and more passionate, for there is no good in a love that is ruled by reason.</p>  
<p>7. God in His mercy veils the splendours of His face from His creatures.</p>  
<p>8. The more the Beloved looks on thee, the more is thy anguish increased. Vision is possible only in moments of ecstasy.</p>  
<p>9. 'The camel-driver,' i.e. the voice of God calling those exalted spiritual beings to ascend towards Him.</p>  
<p>'Separation,' i.e. their departure from the phenomenal world.</p>  
<p>'Al-Abraq,' the place where God is manifested in His essence.</p>  
<p>10. 'The ravens of separation,' i.e. considerations affecting his phenomenal existence, which hinder him from the ascent to God.</p>  
<p>11. 'A camel,' i.e. the ravens of separation are really a man's aspirations (###), since aspiration bears him aloft and unites him with the object of his search.</p>
