<p>1. O breeze of the wind, bear to the gazelles of Najd this message: 'I am faithful to the covenant which ye know.'</p>  
<p>2. And say to the young girl of the tribe, 'Our trysting-place is at the guarded pasture beside the hills of Najd on the Sabbath morn,</p>  
<p>3. On the red hill towards the cairns and on the right hand of the rivulets and the solitary landmark.'</p>  
<p>4. And if her words be true and she feel the same tormenting desire for me as I feel</p>  
<p>5. For her, then we shall meet covertly in the heat of noon at her tent with the most inviolable troth,</p>  
<p>6. And she and I will communicate what we suffer of love and sore tribulation and grievous pain.</p>

<p>7. Is this a vague dream or glad tidings revealed in sleep or the speech of an hour in whose speech was my happy fortune?</p>  
<p>8. Perchance he who brought the objects of desire (into my heart) will bring them face to face with me, and their gardens will bestow on me the gathered roses.</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'O breeze of the wind,' i.e. the subtle spiritual sense which gnostics use as a medium of communication.</p>  
<p>'The gazelles of Najd,' i.e. the exalted spirits.</p>  
<p>2. 'The young girl of the tribe,' i.e. the spirit especially akin to himself.</p>  
<p>3. 'The red hill,' i.e. the station of beauty, since red is the fairest of all the colours.</p>  
<p>'The solitary landmark,' i.e. the Divine singleness (###), which is inferior to oneness (###).</p>  
<p>5. 'In the heat of noon,' i.e. in the station of equilibrium (###).</p>  
<p>7. 'Is this a vague dream?' (cf. Kor. xii, 44), i.e. this union is impossible, for my spirit cannot escape from the corporeal world.</p>
