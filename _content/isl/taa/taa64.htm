<p>1. O <i>b&aacute;n</i> tree of the valley, on the bank of the river of Baghd&aacute;d!</p>  
<p>2. A mournful dove that cooed on a swaying bough filled me with grief for thee.</p>  
<p>3. His plaintive song reminds me of the plaintive song of the lady of the chamber.</p>  
<p>4. Whenever she tunes her triple chords, thou must forget the brother of al-H&aacute;d&iacute;.</p>  
<p>5. And if she lavishes her melody, who is Anjasha the camel-driver?</p>  
<p>6. I swear by Dhu &#8217;l-Kha&#7693;im&aacute;t and then by Sind&aacute;d</p>  
<p>7. That I am passionately in love with Salm&aacute;, who dwells at Ajy&aacute;d.</p>  
<p>8. No; I am mistaken: she dwells in the black clot of blood in the membrane of my liver.</p>  
<p>9. Beauty is confounded by her, and odours of musk and saffron are scattered abroad.</p>
