<p>1. Their abodes have become decayed, but desire of them is ever new in my heart and decayeth not.</p>  
<p>2. These tears are shed over their ruined dwellings, but souls are ever melted at the memory of them.</p>  
<p>3. Through love of them I called out behind their riding-camels, 'O ye who are rich in beauty, here am I, a beggar!</p>  
<p>4. I have rolled my cheek in the dust in tender and passionate affection: then, by the true love which I owe to you, I, do not make hopeless</p>  
<p>5. One who is drowned in his tears and burned in the fire of sorrow with no respite!'</p>  
<p>6. O thou who wouldst kindle a fire, be not hasty! Here is the fire of passion. Go and take of it!</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'Their abodes have become decayed': he says, 'the places of austerities and mortifications, where the Divine Names made works (###) their abode, have become decayed through age and loss of youthful strength.' The word ### is used in reference to the springtide (###) of human life.</p>  
<p>3. 'Behind their riding-camels,' i.e. the powers of youth and the delights of the commencement (###).</p>  
<p>4. 'I have rolled my cheek in the dust,' i.e. desiring to be united with you, for God says, 'Seek access to Me by means of that which I have not,' viz. abasement and indigence.</p>  
<p>6. 'Here is the fire of passion,' i.e. in my heart.</p>
