<p>1. The loved ones of my heart&#8212;where are they? Say, by God, where are they?</p>  
<p>2. As thou sawest their apparition, wilt thou show to me their reality?</p>  
<p>3. How long, how long was I seeking them! and how often did I beg to be united with them,</p>  
<p>4. Until I had no fear of being parted from them, and yet I feared to be amongst them.</p>  
<p>5. Perchance my happy star will hinder their going afar from me,</p>  
<p>6. That mine eye may be blest with them, and that I may not ask, 'Where are they?'</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'The loved ones,' i.e. the sublime spirits.</p>  
<p>2. 'Their apparition,' i.e. their manifestation in the world of similitude.</p>  
<p>4: 'I feared to be amongst them,' i.e. lest their radiance should consume me.</p>  
<p>5. 'My happy star,' i.e. the Divine favour predestined to me.</p>
