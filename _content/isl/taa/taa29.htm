<p>1. In the valley-curve between the two stony tracts is the trysting-place. Make our camels kneel, for here is the journey's end.</p>  
<p>2. Do not seek (any other spot) and do not call after this, 'O B&aacute;riq! O &#7716;&aacute;jir! O Thahmad!'</p>  
<p>3. And play as friendly full-breasted damsels played, and pasture as shy gazelles pastured</p>

<p>4. In a meadow whose flies sang and hummed and a warbling bird there answered them joyously.</p>  
<p>5. Soft were its sides and soft its breeze, and the clouds were flashing and thundering,</p>  
<p>6. And the raindrops were descending from the crevices of the clouds like tears shed by a passionate lover because he is parted from her he loves.</p>  
<p>7. And drink the pure essence of its wine with its intoxication, and listen rapturously to a singer who chanteth there:</p>  
<p>8. 'O the pure wine that in Adam's time related concerning the Garden of Eden an authentic tradition!</p>  
<p>9. Verily, the fair women scattered it from the water of their mouths like musk and the virgins bestowed it on us without stint.'</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'In the valley-curve between the two stony tracts,' i.e. in the place where Divine favours are bestowed on the soul which is the <i>locus</i> of an Essential manifestation.</p>  
<p>'The trysting-place,' referring either to the station of Faith or to God's taking a covenant from the souls of mankind.</p>  
<p>'The journey's end,' i.e. the mystery of everlasting life.</p>  
<p>2. 'Do not seek,' etc., in accordance with the Tradition, 'There is no mark beyond God.'</p>  
<p>3. 'And play,' etc., referring to the various states of this gnostic in which he is transported from one Divine Name to another. 'Full-breasted damsels' and 'shy gazelles' refer to the abstruse sciences of pure unification.</p>

<p>7. 'The pure essence of its wine,' i.e. spiritual meanings and Divine sciences, which fill the heart with delight.</p>  
<p>'A singer,' i.e. the voice (###) produced by the universal praise (###); the human soul hears it in its essence and is enraptured.</p>  
<p>8. 'The Garden of Eden,' i.e. this wine is derived from the Presence which comes to dwell in the souls of gnostics at the time of nurture (###).</p>  
<p>9. 'The fair women,' i.e. the Divine Names.</p>  
<p>'From the water of their mouths,' i.e. from the station of speech and expression.</p>
