*The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq*, by Ibn al-Arabi, tr. Reynold A. Nicholson,
\[1911\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### LII

1\. I am content with Raḍwá as a meadow and a lodging-place, for it has
a pasture in which is cool water.

2\. May be, those whom I love will hear of its fertility, so that they
will take it as an abode and lodging-place.

3\. For lo, my heart is attached to them and listens silently whenever
the camel-driver urges them on with his chant.

4\. And if they call to one another to set out and cross the desert,
thou wilt hear its wailing behind their camels.

5\. And if they make for az-Zawrá, it will be in front of them, and if
they are bound for al-Jar‘á, it will alight there.

6\. No fortune is found except where they are and where they encamp, for
the bird of Fortune has fledglings in their tribe.

7\. Fear for myself and fear for her sake battled with each other, and
neither gave way to its adversary.

8\. When her splendours dazzle mine eyes, the sound of my sobbing
deafens her ears.
