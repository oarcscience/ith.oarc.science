<p>1. O garden of the valley, answer the lady of the preserve and her who hath shining front-teeth, O garden of the valley</p>  
<p>2. And let a little of thy shades o&#8217;ershadow her for a short time until she be settled in the meeting-place.</p>  
<p>3. And her tents be pitched in thy midst. Then thou wilt have as much as thou wishest of dew to feed the tender shoots,</p>  
<p>4. And as much as thou wishest of showers and the moisture of clouds passing over her <i>b&aacute;n</i> trees at eve and morn,</p>  
<p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></A></p>  
<p>5. And as much as thou wishest of dense shade and fruit, delicious to the gatherer, swaying the bough (on which it hangs),</p>  
<p>6. And of those who seek Zar&uacute;d and its sands, and of those who chant as they drive the camels from behind, and of those who march in front and lead them well.</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'O garden of the valley,' in reference to the bush in which the Divine light appeared to Moses.</p>  
<p>'The lady of the preserve,' i.e. the reality of Moses, signifying a spiritual degree which the gnostic inherited from Moses. 'Preserve' denotes the station of Glory unattainable by his essence.</p>  
<p>'Shining front-teeth,' because he is in the station of converse and speech (###).</p>  
<p>2. 'Until she be settled,' i.e. until the place be ready for her reception, so that she may speak from his essence to his essence without regard to anything extraneous.</p>  
<p>3. 'Dew to feed the tender shoots,' i.e. gracious sorts of knowledge which nourish the human organism.</p>  
<p>6. 'Zar&uacute;d and its sands,' i.e. elusive sorts of knowledge which are not to be apprehended save in moments of ecstasy.</p>  
<p>'And of those who chant,' etc. The <i>&#7717;&aacute;d&iacute;</i> who drives the camels from behind typifies that which comes with fear and chiding and menaces, while the <i>&#7717;&aacute;d&iacute;</i> who goes in front of the camels typifies that which comes with hope and joy and kindness. The former is the servant of the Wrathful (###), and the latter is the servant of the Merciful (###).</p>
