But ye honour not the orphan,<br> Nor urge ye one another to feed the poor,<br> And ye devour heritages, devouring greedily,<br> And ye love riches with exceeding love.<br> Aye. But when the earth shall be crushed with crushing, crushing,<br> And thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank,<br> And Hell on that day shall be moved up,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>--Man shall on that day remember himself. But how shall remembrance help him?<br> He shall say, Oh! would that I had prepared for this my life! On that day none shall punish as God punisheth,<br> And none shall bind with such bonds as He.<br> Oh, thou soul which art at rest,<br> Return to thy Lord, pleased, and pleasing him:<br> Enter thou among my servants,<br> And enter thou my Paradise.</p>
