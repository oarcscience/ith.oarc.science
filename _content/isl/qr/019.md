### SURA XIX. <span id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_290)--MARY \[LVIII.\]

MECCA.--98 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
KAF. HA. YA. AIN. SAD. <span id="fr_291"></span>[2](#fn_291) A recital
of thy Lord's mercy to his servant Zachariah;  
When he called upon his Lord with secret calling,  
And said: "O Lord, verily my bones are weakened, and the hoar hairs
glisten on my head,  
And never, Lord, have I prayed to thee with ill success.  
But now I have fears for my kindred after me; <span
id="fr_292"></span>[3](#fn_292) and my wife is barren:  
Give me, then, a successor as thy special gift, who shall be my heir and
an heir of the family of Jacob: and make him, Lord, well pleasing to
thee."  
--"O Zachariah! verily we announce to thee a son,--his name John:  
That name We have given to none before him." <span
id="fr_293"></span>[4](#fn_293)  
He said: "O my Lord! how when my wife is barren shall I have a son, and
when I have now reached old age, failing in my powers?"  
He said: So shall it be. Thy Lord hath said, Easy is this to me, for I
created thee aforetime when thou wast nothing."  
He said: "Vouchsafe me, O my Lord! a sign." He said: "Thy sign shall be
that for three nights, though sound in health, thou speakest not to
man."  
And he came forth from the sanctuary to his people, and made signs to
them to sing praises morn and even.  
We said: "O John! receive the Book with purpose of heart:" <span
id="fr_294"></span>[5](#fn_294)--and We bestowed on him wisdom while yet
a child;  
And mercifulness from Ourself, and purity; and pious was he, and duteous
to his parents; and not proud, rebellious.  
And peace was on him on the day he was born, and the day of his death,
and shall be on the day when he shall be raised to life!  
And make mention in the Book, of Mary, when she went apart from her
family, eastward, <span id="fr_295"></span>[6](#fn_295)  
And took a veil to shroud herself from them: <span
id="fr_296"></span>[7](#fn_296) and we sent our spirit <span
id="fr_297"></span>[8](#fn_297) to her, and he took before her the form
of a perfect man. <span id="fr_298"></span>[9](#fn_298)  
She said: "I fly for refuge from thee to the God of Mercy! If thou
fearest Him, begone from me."  
He said: "I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a
holy son."  
She said: "How shall I have a son, when man hath never touched me? and I
am not unchaste."  
He said: "So shall it be. Thy Lord hath said: 'Easy is this with me;'
and we will make him a sign to mankind, and a mercy from us. For it is a
thing decreed."  
And she conceived him, <span id="fr_299"></span>[10](#fn_299) and
retired with him to a far-off place.  
And the throes came upon her <span id="fr_300"></span>[11](#fn_300) by
the trunk of a palm. She said: "Oh, would that I had died ere this, and
been a thing forgotten, forgotten quite!"  
And one cried to her from below her: <span
id="fr_301"></span>[12](#fn_301) "Grieve not thou, thy Lord hath
provided a streamlet at thy feet:--  
And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee: <span
id="fr_302"></span>[13](#fn_302) it will drop fresh ripe dates upon
thee.  
Eat then and drink, and be of cheerful eye: <span
id="fr_303"></span>[14](#fn_303) and shouldst thou see a man,  
Say,--Verily, I have vowed abstinence to the God of mercy.--To no one
will I speak this day."  
Then came she with the babe to her people, bearing him. They said, "O
Mary! now hast thou done a strange thing!  
O sister of Aaron! <span id="fr_304"></span>[15](#fn_304) Thy father was
not a man of wickedness, nor unchaste thy mother."  
And she made a sign to them, pointing towards the babe. They said, "How
shall we speak with him who is in the cradle, an infant?"  
It said, <span id="fr_305"></span>[16](#fn_305) "Verily, I am the
servant of God; He hath given me the Book, and He hath made me a
prophet;  
And He hath made me blessed wherever I may be, and hath enjoined me
prayer and almsgiving so long as I shall live;  
And to be duteous to her that bare me: and he hath not made me proud,
depraved.  
And the peace of God was on me the day I was born, and will be the day I
shall die, and the day I shall be raised to life."  
This is Jesus, the son of Mary; this is a statement of the truth
concerning which they doubt.  
It beseemeth not God to beget a son. Glory be to Him! when he decreeth a
thing, He only saith to it, Be, and it Is. <span
id="fr_306"></span>[17](#fn_306)  
And verily, God is my Lord and your Lord; adore Him then. This is the
right way.  
But the Sects have fallen to variance among themselves about Jesus: but
woe, because of the assembly of a great day, to those who believe not!  
Make them hear, make them behold the day when they shall come before us!
But the offenders this day are in a manifest error.  
Warn them of the day of sighing when the decree shall be accomplished,
while they are sunk in heedlessness and while they believe not.  
Verily, we will inherit the earth and all who are upon it. To us shall
they be brought back.  
Make mention also in the Book of Abraham; for he was a man of truth, a
Prophet. <span id="fr_307"></span>[18](#fn_307)  
When he said to his Father, "O my Father! why dost thou worship that
which neither seeth nor heareth, nor profiteth thee aught?  
O my Father! verily now hath knowledge come to me which hath not come to
thee. Follow me therefore--I will guide thee into an even path.  
O my Father! worship not Satan, for Satan is a rebel against the God of
Mercy.  
O my Father! indeed I fear lest a chastisement from the God of Mercy
light upon thee, and thou become Satan's vassal."  
He said, "Castest thou off my Gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I
will surely stone thee. Begone from me for a length of time."  
He said, "Peace be on thee! I will pray my Lord for thy forgiveness, for
he is gracious to me:  
But I will separate myself from you, and the gods ye call on beside God,
and on my Lord will I call. Haply, my prayers to my Lord will not be
with ill success."  
And when he had separated himself from them and that which they
worshipped beside God, we bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each of
them we made a prophet:  
And we bestowed gifts on them in our mercy, and gave them the lofty
tongue of truth." <span id="fr_308"></span>[19](#fn_308)  
And commemorate Moses in "the Book;" for he was a man of purity:
moreover he was an Apostle, a Prophet:  
From the right side of the mountain we called to him, and caused him to
draw nigh to us for secret converse:  
And we bestowed on him in our mercy his brother Aaron, a Prophet.  
And commemorate Ismael in "the Book;" for he was true to his promise,
and was an Apostle, a Prophet;  
And he enjoined prayer and almsgiving on his people, and was well
pleasing to his Lord.  
And commemorate Edris <span id="fr_309"></span>[20](#fn_309) in "the
Book;" for he was a man of truth, a Prophet:  
And we uplifted him to a place on high. <span
id="fr_310"></span>[21](#fn_310)  
These are they among the prophets of the posterity of Adam, and among
those whom we bare with Noah, and among the posterity of Abraham and
Israel, and among those whom we have guided and chosen, to whom God hath
shewed favour. When the signs of the God of Mercy were rehearsed to
them, they bowed them down worshipping and weeping.  
But others have come in their place after them: they have made an end of
prayer, and have gone after their own lusts; and in the end they shall
meet with evil:--  
Save those who turn and believe and do that which is right, these shall
enter the Garden, and in nought shall they be wronged:  
The Garden of Eden, which the God of Mercy hath promised to his
servants, though yet unseen: <span id="fr_311"></span>[22](#fn_311) for
his promise shall come to pass:  
No vain discourse shall they hear therein, but only "Peace;" and their
food shall be given them at morn and even:  
This is the Paradise which we will make the heritage of those our
servants who fear us.  
We <span id="fr_312"></span>[23](#fn_312) come not down from Heaven but
by thy Lord's command. His, whatever is before us and whatever is behind
us, and whatever is between the two! And thy Lord is not forgetful,--  
Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between them!
Worship Him, then, and abide thou steadfast in his worship. Knowest thou
any other of the same name? <span id="fr_313"></span>[24](#fn_313)  
Man saith: "What! after I am dead, shall I in the end be brought forth
alive?"  
Doth not man bear in mind that we made him at first, when he was
nought?  
And I swear by thy Lord, we will surely gather together them and the
Satans: then will we set them on their knees round Hell:  
Then will we take forth from each band those of them who have been
stoutest in rebellion against the God of Mercy:  
Then shall we know right well to whom its burning is most due:  
No one is there of you who shall not go down unto it <span
id="fr_314"></span>[25](#fn_314)--This is a settled decree with thy
Lord--  
Then will we deliver those who had the fear of God, and the wicked will
we leave in it on their knees.  
And when our clear signs are rehearsed to them, the infidels say to
those who believe: "Which of the two parties <span
id="fr_315"></span>[26](#fn_315) is in the best plight? and which is the
most goodly company?"  
But how many generations have we brought to ruin before them, who
surpassed them in riches and in splendour!  
SAY: As to those who are in error, the God of Mercy will lengthen out to
them a length of days  
Until they see that with which they are threatened, whether it be some
present chastisement, or whether it be "the Hour," and they shall then
know which is in the worse state, and which the more weak in forces:  
But God will increase the guidance of the already guided.  
And good works which abide, are in thy Lord's sight better in respect of
guerdon, and better in the issue than all worldly good.  
Hast thou marked him who believeth not in our signs, and saith, "I shall
surely have riches and children bestowed upon me?"  
Hath he mounted up into the secrets of God? Hath he made a compact with
the God of Mercy?  
No! we will certainly write down what he saith, and will lengthen the
length of his chastisement:  
And we will inherit what he spake of, and he shall come before us all
alone.  
They have taken other gods beside God to be their help. <span
id="fr_316"></span>[27](#fn_316)  
But it shall not be. Those gods will disavow their worship and will
become their enemies.  
Seest thou not that we send the Satans against the Infidels to urge them
into sin?  
Wherefore be not thou in haste with them; <span
id="fr_317"></span>[28](#fn_317) for a small number of days do we number
to them.  
One day we will gather the God-fearing before the God of Mercy with
honours due: <span id="fr_318"></span>[29](#fn_318)  
But the sinners will we drive unto Hell, like flocks driven to the
watering.  
None shall have power to intercede, save he who hath received permission
at the hands of the God of Mercy.  
They say: "The God of Mercy hath gotten offspring." Now have ye done a
monstrous thing!  
Almost might the very Heavens be rent thereat, and the Earth cleave
asunder, and the mountains fall down in fragments,  
That they ascribe a son to the God of Mercy, when it beseemeth not the
God of Mercy to beget a son!  
Verily there is none in the Heavens and in the Earth but shall approach
the God of Mercy as a servant. He hath taken note of them, and numbered
them with exact numbering:  
And each of them shall come to Him, on the day of Resurrection,
singly:  
But love will the God of Mercy vouchsafe to those who believe and do the
things that be right.  
Verily we have made this Koran easy and in thine own tongue, that thou
mayest announce glad tidings by it to the God-fearing, and that thou
mayest warn the contentious by it.  
How many generations have we destroyed before them! Canst thou search
out one of them? or canst thou hear a whisper from them?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_290"></span>[1](019.htm#fr_290) Comp. the first 37 verses
of this Sura with Sura iii. 35-57 with reference to the different style
adopted by Muhammad in the later Suras, probably for the purpose of
avoiding the imputation of his being merely a poet, a sorcerer, or
person possessed. Sura lii. 29, 30; xxi. 5; lxviii. 2, 51. This Sura is
one of the fullest and earliest Koranic Gospel Histories, and was
recited to the Nagash or King of Æthiopia, in the presence of the
ambassadors of the Koreisch. His. 220; Caussin, i. 392; Sprenger (Life
of M.) p. 193.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[2](019.htm#fr_291) See Sura lxviii. I, p. 32.
Golius conjectured that these letters represent coh ya'as, thus he
counselled, and that they were added by some Jewish scribe. Sprenger
(Journ. of As. Soc. of Bengal, xx. 280) arranges them as Ain, Sad, Kaf,
Ha, Ya, and supposes them to be taken from the Arabic words for Aisa
(Jesus) of the Nazarenes, King of the Jews. But we can hardly imagine
that Muhammad would ascribe such a title to our Lord, and the word which
Dr. Sprenger uses for Jews is not the form peculiar to the Koran.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[3](019.htm#fr_292) Lest they should desert the
worship of the God of Israel.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[4](019.htm#fr_293) Ar. Yahia. It may be true
that the name in this form had never been given. Otherwise, we have in
this passage a misunderstanding of Luke i. 61, as well as ignorance of
the Jewish Scriptures. Comp. 2 Kings xxv. 23; 1 Chron. iii. 16; Ezra
viii. 12; Jerem. xl. 8. Some commentators try to avoid the difficulty by
rendering samiyan, deserving of the name.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[5](019.htm#fr_294) Or, with firm resolve. See
Sura \[xcvii.\] iii. 36. The speaker is God.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[6](019.htm#fr_295) To an eastern chamber in
the temple to pray. Or it may mean, to some place eastward from
Jerusalem, or from the house of her parents.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[7](019.htm#fr_296) Thus the Protev. Jac. c. 12
says that Mary, although at a later period, \[greek text\] But Wahl, she
laid aside her veil.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[8](019.htm#fr_297) Gabriel.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[9](019.htm#fr_298) See Sura \[lxxxix.\] vi. 9.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[10](019.htm#fr_299) It is quite clear from
this passage, and from verse 36, that Muhammad believed Jesus to have
been conceived by an act of the divine will. Comp. Sura \[xcvii.\] iii.
52; see also note at Sura \[xci.\] ii. 81.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[11](019.htm#fr_300) Or, the throes urged her
to the trunk of, etc.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[12](019.htm#fr_301) This was either the Infant
which spoke as soon as born, or Gabriel. Comp. Thilo Cod. Apoc. 136-139
on this passage. Beidhawi explains: from behind the palm tree.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[13](019.htm#fr_302) See Thilo Cod. Apoc. N. T.
p. 138, and the Hist. Nat. Mar. c. 20, which connects similar incidents
with the flight into Egypt. Thus also Latona, \[greek text\], Call. H.
in Apoll. and \[greek text\], H. in Delum.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[14](019.htm#fr_303) Or, settle, calm thine
eye, refresh thine eye. The birth of a son is still called korrat ol
ain.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[15](019.htm#fr_304) The anachronism is
probably only apparent. See Sura iii. 1, n. Muhammad may have supposed
that this Aaron (or Harun) was the son of Imran and Anna. Or, if Aaron
the brother of Moses be meant Mary may be called his sister, either
because she was of the Levitical race, or by way of comparison.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[16](019.htm#fr_305) See Sura \[cxiv.\] v. 109.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[17](019.htm#fr_306) From the change in the
rhyme, and from the more polemical tone of the following five verses, it
may be inferred that they were added at a somewhat later period.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[18](019.htm#fr_307) The title Nabi, prophet,
is used of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as depositaries of the worship of
the one true God, but with a mission restricted to their own families;
whereas Houd, Saleh, Shoaib, etc., are designated as (Resoul) apostles
and envoys, charged with a more extended mission to the tribes of
Arabia. In Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, etc., are united the office and
gift both of prophet (nabi) and apostle (resoul).

<span id="fn_308"></span>[19](019.htm#fr_308) Made them to be highly
praised. Beidh.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[20](019.htm#fr_309) Enoch. Beidhawi derives
the name Edris from the Ar. darasa, to search out, with reference to his
knowledge of divine mysteries. The Heb. Enoch, in like manner, means
initiated.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[21](019.htm#fr_310) Comp. Gen. v. 24, and the
tract Derek Erez in Midr. Jalkut, c. 42, where Enoch is reckoned among
the nine according to other Talmudists, thirteen (Schroeder's Talm. und
Rabb. Judenthum)--individuals who were exempted from death and taken
straight to Paradise. It should be observed that both here and Sura xxi.
85, Edris is named after Ismael.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[22](019.htm#fr_311) Maracci and Beidhawi, in
absentid. Sale, as an object of faith. Beidhawi ad f. in reward for
their secret faith. Ullmann für die verborgene Zukunft.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[23](019.htm#fr_312) This verse is to be
understood as an answer on the part of Gabriel to Muhammad's complaints
of the long intervals between the revelations.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[24](019.htm#fr_313) The idolaters called their
deities Gods, but as Polytheists were unused to the singular Allah, God.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[25](019.htm#fr_314) Even the pious on their
way to Paradise are to pass the confines of Hell.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[26](019.htm#fr_315) The Koreisch, or the
Muslims.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[27](019.htm#fr_316) Or, glory, strength.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[28](019.htm#fr_317) To call down judgments
upon them.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[29](019.htm#fr_318) As ambassadors come into
the presence of a prince. Sale. This is implied in the original.
