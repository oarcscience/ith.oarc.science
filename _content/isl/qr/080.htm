<P><A NAME="fn_65"></A><A HREF="080.htm#fr_65">1</A> We are told in the traditions, etc., that when engaged in converse with Walid, a chief man among the Koreisch, Muhammad was interrupted by the blind Abdallah Ibn Omm Makt&ucirc;m, who asked to hear the Koran. The Prophet spoke very roughly to him at the time, but afterwards repented, and treated him ever after with the greatest respect. So much so, that he twice made him Governor of Medina.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_66"></A><A HREF="080.htm#fr_66">2</A> That is, if he does not embrace Islam, and so become pure from sin, thou wilt not be to blame; thou art simply charged with the delivery of a message of warning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_67"></A><A HREF="080.htm#fr_67">3</A> Ex spermate.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_68"></A><A HREF="080.htm#fr_68">4</A> Descriptions of the Day of Judgment now become very frequent. See Sura lxxxv. p. 42, and almost every Sura to the lv., after which they become gradually more historical.</P>
