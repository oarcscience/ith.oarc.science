<p align="center">MEDINA.--24 Verses</p>  
<p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful!</p>  
<p>ALL that is in the Heavens and all that is on the Earth praiseth God! He, the Mighty, the Wise!</p>  
<p>He it is who caused the unbelievers among the people of the Book to quit their homes and join those who had EMIGRATED previously.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1105"></A><A HREF="#fn_1105"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Ye did not think that they would quit them; and they on their part thought that their fortresses would protect them against God: But God came upon them whence they looked not for Him, and cast such fear into their hearts that by their own hands as well as by the hands of the victorious believers they demolished their houses! Profit by this example ye who are men of insight!</p>  
<p>And were it not that God had decreed their exile, surely in this world would he have chastised them: but in the world to come the chastisement of the fire awaiteth them.</p>  
<p>This because they set them against God and his apostle; and whoso setteth him against God. . . . ! God truly is vehement in punishing.</p>  
<p>Your cutting down some of their palm trees and sparing others was by God's permission, and to put the wicked to shame.</p>  
<p>After the spoils of these Jews which God hath assigned to his apostle, ye pressed not with horse or camel.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1106"></A><A HREF="#fn_1106"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> But God giveth his apostles power over what he will. God is Almighty.</p>  
<p>The spoil taken from the people of the towns and assigned by God to his apostle, belongeth to God, and to the apostle, and to his kindred, and to the orphan, and to the poor, and to the wayfarer, that none of it may circulate among such of you only as are rich: What the apostle hath given you, take: What he hath refused you, refuse: And fear ye God, for God is severe in punishing.</p>  
<p>To the poor refugees (Mohadjerin) also doth a part belong, who have been driven from their homes and their substance, and who seek favour from God and his goodwill, and aid God and his apostle. These are the men of genuine virtue.</p>  
<p>They of Medina who had been in possession of their abodes and embraced the faith before them, cherish those who take refuge with them; and they find not in their breasts any desire for what hath fallen to their share: they prefer them before themselves, though poverty be their own lot. And with such as are preserved from their own covetousness shall it be well.</p>  
<p>And they who have come after them into the faith say, "O our Lord! forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in the faith, and put not into our hearts ill-will against those who believe. O our Lord! thou verily art Kind, Merciful."</p>  
<p>Hast thou not observed the disaffected saying to their unbelieving brethren&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1107"></A><A HREF="#fn_1107"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> among the people of the Book, "If ye be driven forth, we will go forth with you; and in what concerneth you, never will we obey any one; and if ye be attacked we will certainly come to your help." But God is witness that they are liars.</p>  
<p>No! if they were driven forth, they would not share their banishment; if they were attacked they would not help them, or if they help them they will surely turn their backs: then would they remain unhelped.</p>  
<p>Assuredly the fear of you is more intense in their hearts than the fear of God! This because they are a people devoid of discernment.</p>  
<p>They (the Jews) will not fight against you in a body except in fenced towns or from behind walls. Mighty is their valour among themselves! thou thinkest them united--but their hearts are divided. This for that they are a people who understand not.</p>  
<p>They act like those who lately preceded them,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1108"></A><A HREF="#fn_1108"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> who also tasted the result of their doings; and a grievous chastisement awaiteth them--</p>  
<p>Like Satan when he saith to a man, "Be an infidel:" and when he hath become an infidel, he saith, "I share not thy guilt:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1109"></A><A HREF="#fn_1109"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> verily, I fear God the Lord of the Worlds."</p>  
<p>Of both, therefore, shall the end be that they dwell for ever in the fire: This is the recompense of the evil doers.</p>  
<p>O ye who believe! fear God. And let every soul look well to what it sendeth on before for the morrow. And fear ye God: Verily, God is cognisant of what ye do.</p>  
<p>And be ye not like those who forget God, and whom He hath therefore caused to forget their proper selves. Such men are the evil doers.</p>  
<p>The inmates of the Fire and the inmates of Paradise are not to be held equal. The inmates of Paradise only shall be the blissful.</p>  
<p>Had we sent down this Koran on some mountain, thou wouldst certainly have seen it humbling itself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1110"></A><A HREF="#fn_1110"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and cleaving asunder for the fear of God. Such are the parables we propose to men in order that they may reflect.</p>  
<p>He is God beside whom there is no god. He knoweth things visible and invisible: He is the Compassionate, the Merciful.</p>  
<p>He is God beside whom there is no god: He is the King, the Holy, the Peaceful, the Faithful, the Guardian, the Mighty, the Strong, the Most High! Far be the Glory of God from that which they unite with Him!</p>  
<p>He is God, the Producer, the Maker, the Fashioner! To Him are ascribed excellent titles. Whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth praiseth Him. He is the Mighty, the Wise!</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1105"></A><A HREF="059.htm#fr_1105">1</A> The Jews of Nadhir, three miles from Medina, had broken a treaty made with Muhammad, and in the month Rab* of the fourth year of the Hejira were besieged by him and driven first to the Jews of Kainoka, who had emigrated previously, under compulsion, after the battle of Bedr, and subsequently out of Arabia.
