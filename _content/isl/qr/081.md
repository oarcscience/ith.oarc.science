### SURA LXXXI.--THE FOLDED UP \[XXXII.\]

MECCA.--29 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
WHEN the sun shall be FOLDED UP, <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78)  
And when the stars shall fall,  
And when the mountains shall be set in motion,  
And when the she-camels shall be abandoned,  
And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together, <span
id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_79)  
And when the seas shall boil,  
And when souls shall be paired with their bodies,  
And when the female child that had been buried alive shall be asked  
For what crime she was put to death, <span
id="fr_80"></span>[3](#fn_80)  
And when the leaves of the Book shall be unrolled,  
And when the Heaven shall be stripped away, <span
id="fr_81"></span>[4](#fn_81)  
And when Hell shall be made to blaze,  
And when Paradise shall be brought near,  
Every soul shall know what it hath produced.  
It needs not that I swear by the stars <span
id="fr_82"></span>[5](#fn_82) of retrograde motions  
Which move swiftly and hide themselves away,  
And by the night when it cometh darkening on,  
And by the dawn when it brighteneth,  
That this is the word of an illustrious Messenger, <span
id="fr_83"></span>[6](#fn_83)  
Endued with power, having influence with the Lord of the Throne,  
Obeyed there by Angels, faithful to his trust,  
And your compatriot is not one possessed by djinn;  
For he saw him in the clear horizon: <span
id="fr_84"></span>[7](#fn_84)  
Nor doth he grapple with heaven's secrets, <span
id="fr_85"></span>[8](#fn_85)  
Nor doth he teach the doctrine of a cursed <span
id="fr_86"></span>[9](#fn_86) Satan.  
Whither then are ye going?  
Verily, this is no other than a warning to all creatures;  
To him among you who willeth to walk in a straight path:  
But will it ye shall not, unless as God willeth it, <span
id="fr_87"></span>[10](#fn_87) the Lord of the worlds.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_78"></span>[1](081.htm#fr_78) Involutus fuerit tenebris.
Mar. Or, thrown down.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[2](081.htm#fr_79) Thus Bab. Talm. Erchin, 3.
"In the day to come (i.e., of judgment) all the beasts will assemble and
come, etc."

<span id="fn_80"></span>[3](081.htm#fr_80) See Sura xvi. 61; xvii. 33.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[4](081.htm#fr_81) Like a skin from an animal
when flayed. The idea is perhaps borrowed from the Sept. V. of Psalm
civ. 2. Vulg. sicut pellem.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[5](081.htm#fr_82) Mercury, Venus, Jupiter,
Mars, Saturn.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[6](081.htm#fr_83) Gabriel; of the meaning of
whose name the next verse is probably a paraphrase.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[7](081.htm#fr_84) Sura 1iii. 7.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[8](081.htm#fr_85) Like a mere Kahin, or
soothsayer.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[9](081.htm#fr_86) Lit. stoned. Sura iii. 31.
This vision or hallucination is one of the few clearly stated miracles,
to which Muhammad appeals in the Koran. According to the tradition of
Ibn-Abbas in Waquidi he was preserved by it from committing suicide by
throwing himself down from Mount Hira, and that after it, God cheered
him and strengthened his heart, and one revelation speedily followed
another.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[10](081.htm#fr_87) Comp. the doctrine of
predestination in Sura 1xxvi. v. 25 to end.
