The fire which ye obtain by friction--<br> Is it ye who rear its tree, or do we rear it?<br> It is we who have made it for a memorial and a benefit to the wayfarers of the desert,<br> Praise therefore the name of thy Lord, the Great.<br> It needs not that I swear by the setting of the stars,<br> And it is a great oath, if ye knew it,<br> That this is the honourable Koran,<br> Written in the preserved Book:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A><br> Let none touch it but the purified,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A><br> It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.<br> Such tidings as these will ye disdain?<br> Will ye make it your daily bread to gainsay them?<br> Why, at the moment when the soul of a dying man shall come up into his throat,<br> And when ye are gazing at him,<br> Though we are nearer to him than ye, although ye see us not:--<br> Why do ye not, if ye are to escape the judgment,<br> Cause that soul to return? Tell me, if ye speak the truth.<br> But as to him who shall enjoy near access to God,<br> His shall be repose, and pleasure, and a garden of delights.<br> Yea, for him who shall be of the people of the right hand,<br> Shall be the greeting from the people of the right hand--"Peace be to thee."<br> But for him who shall be of those who treat the prophets as deceivers,<br> And of the erring,<br> His entertainment shall be of scalding water,<br> And the broiling of hell-fire.<br> Verily this is a certain truth:<br> Praise therefore the name of thy Lord, the Great.</p>
