### SURAH <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146) LIII.--THE STAR \[XLVI.\]

MECCA.--62 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
By the STAR when it setteth,  
Your compatriot erreth not, nor is he led astray,  
Neither speaketh he from mere impulse.  
The Koran is no other than a revelation revealed to him:  
One terrible in power <span id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_147) taught it
him,  
Endued with wisdom. With even balance stood he  
In the highest part of the horizon:  
Then came he nearer and approached,  
And was at the distance of two bows, or even closer,--  
And he revealed to his servant what he revealed.  
His heart falsified not what he saw.  
What! will ye then dispute with him as to what he saw?  
He had seen him also another time,  
Near the Sidrah-tree, which marks the boundary. <span
id="fr_148"></span>[3](#fn_148)  
Near which is the garden of repose.  
When the Sidrah-tree <span id="fr_149"></span>[4](#fn_149) was covered
with what covered it, <span id="fr_150"></span>[5](#fn_150)  
His eye turned not aside, nor did it wander:  
For he saw the greatest of the signs of his Lord.  
Do you see Al-Lat and Al-Ozza, <span id="fr_151"></span>[6](#fn_151)  
And Manat the third idol besides? <span
id="fr_152"></span>[7](#fn_152)  
What? shall ye have male progeny and God female?  
This were indeed an unfair partition!  
These are mere names: ye and your fathers named them thus: God hath not
sent down any warranty in their regard. A mere conceit and their own
impulses do they follow. Yet hath "the guidance" from their Lord come to
them.  
Shall man have whatever he wisheth?  
The future and the present are in the hand of God:  
And many as are the Angels in the Heavens, their intercession shall be
of no avail <span id="fr_153"></span>[8](#fn_153)  
Until God hath permitted it to whom he shall please and will accept.  
Verily, it is they who believe not in the life to come, who name the
angels with names of females:  
But herein they have no knowledge: they follow a mere conceit; and mere
conceit can never take the place of truth.  
Withdraw then from him who turneth his back on our warning and desireth
only this present life.  
This is the sum of their knowledge. Truly thy Lord best knoweth him who
erreth from his way, and He best knoweth him who hath received
guidance.  
And whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth is God's that he may
reward those who do evil according to their deeds: and those who do good
will He reward with good things.  
To those who avoid great crimes and scandals but commit only lighter
faults, verily, thy Lord will be diffuse of mercy. He well knew you when
he produced you out of the earth, and when ye were embryos in your
mother's womb. Assert not then your own purity. He best knoweth who
feareth him.  
Hast thou considered him who turned his back?  
Who giveth little and is covetous?  
Is it that he hath the knowledge and vision of the secret things?  
Hath he not been told of what is in the pages of Moses?  
And of Abraham faithful to his pledge?  
That no burdened soul shall bear the burdens of another,  
And that nothing shall be reckoned to a man but that for which he hath
made efforts:  
And that his efforts shall at last be seen in their true light:  
That then he shall be recompensed with a most exact recompense,  
And that unto thy Lord is the term of all things,  
And that it is He who causeth to laugh and to weep,  
And that He causeth to die and maketh alive,  
And that He hath created the sexes, male and female,  
From the diffused germs of life, <span id="fr_154"></span>[9](#fn_154)  
And that with Him is the second creation,  
And that He enricheth and causeth to possess,  
And that He is the Lord of Sirius, <span
id="fr_155"></span>[10](#fn_155)  
And that it was He who destroyed the ancient Adites,  
And the people of Themoud and left not one survivor,  
And before them the people of Noah who were most wicked and most
perverse.  
And it was He who destroyed the cities that were overthrown.  
So that that which covered them covered them.  
Which then of thy Lord's benefits wilt thou make a matter of
doubt? <span id="fr_156"></span>[11](#fn_156)  
He who warneth you is one of the warners of old.  
The day that must draw nigh, draweth nigh already: and yet none but God
can reveal its time.  
Is it at these sayings that ye marvel?  
And that ye laugh and weep not?  
And that ye are triflers?  
Prostrate yourselves then to God and worship.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_146"></span>[1](053.htm#fr_146) This Sura was revealed at
about the time of the first emigration of Muhammad's followers to
Abyssinia, A. 5. The manner in which the Prophet cancelled the
objectionable verses 19, 20, is the strongest proof of his sincerity (as
also is the opening of Sura 1xxx.) at this period. Had he not done so,
nothing would have been easier for him than to have effected a
reconciliation with the powerful party in Mecca, who had recently
compelled his followers to emigrate.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[2](053.htm#fr_147) The Angel Gabriel, to the
meaning of whose name, as the strong one of God, these words probably
allude.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[3](053.htm#fr_148) That is, Beyond which
neither men nor angels can pass (Djelal). The original word is also
rendered, the Lote-Tree of the extremity, or of the loftiest spot in
Paradise, in the seventh Heaven, on the right hand of the throne of God.
Its leaves are fabled to be as numerous as the members of the whole
human family, and each leaf to bear the name of an individual. This tree
is shaken on the night of the 15th of Ramadan every year a little after
sunset, when the leaves on which are inscribed the names of those who
are to die in the ensuing year fall, either wholly withered, or with
more or less green remaining, according to the months or weeks the
person has yet to live.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[4](053.htm#fr_149) The Sidrah is a prickly
plum, which is called Ber in India, the zizyphus Jujuba of Linnæus. A
decoction of the leaves is used in India to wash the dead, on account of
the sacredness of the tree.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[5](053.htm#fr_150) Hosts of adoring angels, by
which the tree was masked.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[6](053.htm#fr_151) Al-Lat or El-Lat, probably
the Alilat of Herodotus (iii. 8) was an idol at Nakhlah, a place east of
the present site of Mecca. Al-Ozza was an idol of the Kinanah tribe; but
its hereditary priests were the Banu Solaym, who were stationed along
the mercantile road to Syria in the neighbourhood of Chaibar.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[7](053.htm#fr_152) When at the first recital
of this Sura, the prophet had reached this verse, he continued,

These are the exalted females, \[or, sublime swans, i.e., mounting
nearer and nearer to God\]

And truly their intercession may be expected.

These words, however, which were received by the idolaters with great
exultation, were disowned by Muhammad in the course of a few days as a
Satanic suggestion, and replaced by the text as it now stands. The
probability is that the difficulties of his position led him to attempt
a compromise of which he speedily repented. In the Suras subsequent to
this period the denunciations of idolatry become much sterner and
clearer. The authorities are given by Weil, Sprenger and Muir. See Sura
\[lxvii.\] xvii. 74-76.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[8](053.htm#fr_153) Verses 26-33 are probably
later than the previous part of the Sura, but inserted with reference to
it. Some (as Omar b. Muhammad and Itq.) consider verse 33, or (as
Itq.36) verses 34-42, or (as Omar b. Muhammad) the whole Sura, to have
originated at Medina.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[9](053.htm#fr_154) Ex spermate cum seminatum
fuerit.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[10](053.htm#fr_155) The Dog-star, worshipped
by the Arabians.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[11](053.htm#fr_156) Compare the refrain in
Sura lv. p. 74.
