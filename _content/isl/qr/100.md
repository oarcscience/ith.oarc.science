### SURA C.--THE CHARGERS \[XXXIV.\]

Mecca.--11 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
By the snorting CHARGERS!  
And those that dash off sparks of fire!  
And those that scour to the attack at morn!  
And stir therein the dust aloft;  
And cleave therein their midway through a host!  
Truly, Man is to his Lord ungrateful.  
And of this he is himself a witness;  
And truly, he is vehement in the love of this world's good.  
Ah! knoweth he not, that when that which is in the graves shall be laid
bare,  
And that which is in men's breasts shall be brought forth,  
Verily their Lord shall on that day be informed concerning them?
