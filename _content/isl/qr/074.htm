<P><A NAME="fn_24"></A><A HREF="074.htm#fr_24">1</A> This Sura is placed by Muir in the &#8220;second stage&#8221; of Meccan Suras, and twenty-first in chronological order, in the third or fourth year of the Prophet&#8217;s career. According, however, to the chronological list of Suras given by Weil (Leben M. p. 364) from ancient tradition, as well as from the consentient voice of tradionists and commentaries (v. N&ouml;ld. Geschichte, p. 69; Sprenger&#8217;s Life of Mohammad, p. 111) it was the next revealed after the Fatrah, and the designation to the prophetic office. The main features of the tradition are, that Muhammad while wandering about in the hills near Mecca, distracted by doubts and by anxiety after truth, had a vision of the Angel Gabriel seated on a throne between heaven and earth, that he ran to his wife, Chadijah, in the greatest alarm, and desired her, perhaps from superstitious motives (and believing that if covered with clothes he should be shielded from the glances of evil spirits--comp. Stanley on I Cor. xi. 10), to envelope him in his mantle; that then Gabriel came down and addressed him as in v. I. This vision, like that which preceded Sura xcvi., may actually have occurred during the hallucinations of one of the epileptic fits from which Muhammad from early youth appears to have suffered. Hence Muhammad in Sura lxxxi. appeals to it as a matter of fact, and such he doubtless believe it to be. It may here be observed, that however absurd the Muslim traditions may be in many of their details, it will generally be found that where there is an ancient and tolerably universal consent, there will be found at the bottom a residuum of fact and historical truth. At the same time there can be no doubt but that the details of the traditions are too commonly founded upon the attempt to explain or to throw light upon a dark passage of the Koran, and are pure inventions of a later age.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_25"></A><A HREF="074.htm#fr_25">2</A> The Arabic words are not those used in later Suras to express the same idea.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_26"></A><A HREF="074.htm#fr_26">3</A> Said to be Walid b. Mogheira, a person of note among the unbelieving Meccans. This portion of the Sura seems to be of a different date from the first seven verses, though very ancient, and the change of subject is similar to that at v. 9 of the previous Sura.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_27"></A><A HREF="074.htm#fr_27">4</A> This and the three following verses wear the appearance of having been inserted at a later period to meet objections respecting the number of the angels who guard hell, raised by the Jews; perhaps at Medina, as the four classes of persons specified are those whom Muhammad had to deal with in that city, viz., the Jews, Believers, the Hypocrites, or undecided, and Idolaters. These are constantly mentioned together in the Medina Suras.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_28"></A><A HREF="074.htm#fr_28">5</A> That is, who believe, and do not believe.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_29"></A><A HREF="074.htm#fr_29">6</A> As the word sakar disturbs the rhyme, it may have been inserted by a mistake of the copyist for the usual word, which suits it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_30"></A><A HREF="074.htm#fr_30">7</A> That is, death. Beidh. Comp. Sura xv. 99.</P>
