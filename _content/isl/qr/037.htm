<p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> By the angels ranged in order for Songs of Praise,<br> And by those who repel demons,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> And by those who recite the Koran for warning,<br> Truly your God is but one,<br> Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between them, and Lord of the East.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> We have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars.<br> They serve also as a guard against every rebellious Satan,<br> That they overhear not what passeth in the assembly on high, for they are darted at from every side,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> Driven off and consigned to a lasting torment;<br> While, if one steal a word by stealth, a glistening flame pursueth him.<br> Ask the Meccans then, Are they, or the angels whom we have made, the stronger creation? Aye, of coarse clay have we created them.<br> But while thou marvellest they mock;<br> When they are warned, no warning do they take;<br> And when they see a sign, they fall to mocking,<br> And say, "This is no other than clear sorcery:<br> What! when dead, and turned to dust and bones, shall we indeed be raised?<br> Our sires also of olden times?"<br> Say, Yes; and ye shall be covered with disgrace.<br> For, one blast only, and lo! they shall gaze around them, And shall say, "Oh! woe to us! this is the day of reckoning; This is the day of decision which ye gainsaid as an untruth."<br> Gather together those who have acted unjustly, and their consorts,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and the gods whom they adored<br> Beside God; and guide them to the road for Hell.<br> Set them forth: they shall be questioned.<br> "How now, that ye help not one another?"<br> But on this day they shall submit themselves to God,<br> And shall address one another with mutual reproaches.<br> They shall say, "In sooth, ye came to us in well-omened sort:"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><br> But they will answer, "Nay, it was ye who would not believe; and we had no power whatever over you. Nay, ye were people given to transgress;<br> Just, therefore, is the doom which our Lord hath passed upon us.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> We shall surely taste it:<br> We made you err, for we had erred ourselves."<br> Partners therefore shall they be in punishment on that day.<br> Truly, thus will we deal with the wicked,<br> Because when it was said to them, There is no God but God, they swelled with pride,<br> And said, "Shall we then abandon our gods for a crazed poet?"<br> Nay, he cometh with truth and confirmeth the Sent Ones of old.<br> Ye shall surely taste the painful punishment,<br> And ye shall not be rewarded but as ye have wrought,<br> Save the sincere servants of God!<br> A stated banquet shall they have<br> Of fruits; and honoured shall they be<br> In the gardens of delight,<br> Upon couches face to face.<br> A cup shall be borne round among them from a fountain,<br> Limpid, delicious to those who drink;<br> It shall not oppress the sense, nor shall they therewith be drunken.<br> And with them are the large-eyed ones with modest refraining glances, fair like the sheltered egg.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A><br> And they shall address one another with mutual questions.<br> Saith one of them, "I truly had a bosom friend,<br> Who said, 'Art thou of those who credit it?<br> What! when we shall have died, and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be judged?"'<br> He shall say to those around him, "Will ye look?"<br> And he shall look and see him in the midst of Hell.<br> And he shall say to him, "By God, thou hadst almost caused me to perish;<br> And, but for the favour of my Lord, I had surely been of those who have been brought with thee into torment."<br> "But do we not die," say the blessed,<br> "Any other than our first death? and have we escaped the torment?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A><br> This truly is the great felicity!<br> For the like of this should the travailers travail!<br> Is this the better repast or the tree Ez-zakkoum?<br> Verily, we have made it for a subject of discord to the wicked.<br> It is a tree which cometh up from the bottom of hell;<br> Its fruits is as it were the heads of Satans;<br> And, lo! the damned shall surely eat of it and fill their bellies with it:<br> Then shall they have, thereon, a mixture of boiling water:<br> Then shall they return to hell.<br> They found their fathers erring,<br> And they hastened on in their footsteps.<br> Also before them the greater number of the ancients had erred.<br> Though we had sent warners among them.<br> But see what was the end of these warned ones,<br> Except of God's true servants.<br> Noah called on us of old, and right prompt were we to hear him,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A><br> And we saved him and his family out of the great distress,<br> And we made his offspring the survivors;<br> And we left for him with posterity,<br> "Peace be on Noah throughout the worlds!"<br> Thus do we reward the well-doers,<br> For he was one of our believing servants;--<br> And the rest we drowned.<br> And truly, of his faith was Abraham,<br> When he brought to his Lord a perfect heart,<br> When he said to his father and to his people, "What is this ye worship?<br> Prefer ye with falsehood gods to God?<br> And what deem ye of the Lord of the worlds?"<br> So gazing he gazed towards the stars,<br> And said, "In sooth I am ill:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A><br> And they turned their back on him and departed.<br> He went aside to their gods and said, "Do ye not eat?<br> What aileth you that ye do not speak?"<br> He broke out upon them, with the right hand striking:<br> When his tribesmen came back to him with hasty steps<br> He said, "Worship ye what ye carve,<br> When God hath created you, and that ye make?"<br> They said, "Build up a pyre for him and cast him into the glowing flame."<br> Fain would they plot against him, but we brought them low.<br> And he said, "Verily, I repair to my Lord who will guide me:<br> O Lord give me a son, of the righteous."<br> We announced to him a youth of meekness.<br> And when he became a full-grown youth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A><br> His father said to him, "My son, I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice thee; therefore, consider what thou seest right."<br> He said, "My father, do what thou art bidden; of the patient, if<br> God please, shalt thou find me."<br> And when they had surrendered them to the will of God, he laid him down upon his forehead:<br> We cried unto him, "O Abraham!<br> Now hast thou satisfied the vision." See how we recompense the righteous.<br> This was indeed a decisive test.<br> And we ransomed his son with a costly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> victim,<br> And we left this&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> for him among posterity,<br> "PEACE BE ON ABRAHAM!"<br> Thus do we reward the well-doers,<br> For he was of our believing servants.<br> And we announced Isaac to him--a righteous Prophet--<br> And on him and on Isaac we bestowed our blessing. And among their offspring were well-doers, and others, to their own hurt undoubted sinners.<br> And of old,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> to Moses and to Aaron shewed we favours:<br> And both of them, and their people, we rescued from the great distress:<br> And we succoured them, and they became the conquerors:<br> And we gave them (Moses and Aaron) each the lucid book:<br> And we guided them each into the right way:<br> And we left this for each among posterity,<br> "PEACE BE ON MOSES AND AARON."<br> Thus do we reward the well-doers,<br> For they were two of our believing servants.<br> And Elias truly was of our Sent Ones,<br> When he said to his people, "Fear ye not God?<br> Invoke ye Baal and forsake ye the most skilful Creator?<br> God is your Lord, and the Lord of your sires of old?"<br> But they treated him as a liar, and shall therefore be consigned to punishment,<br> Except God's faithful servants.<br> And we left this for him among posterity,<br> "PEACE BE ON ELIASIN!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A><br> Thus do we reward the well-doers,<br> For he was one of our believing servants.<br> And Lot truly was of our Sent Ones,<br> When we rescued him and all his family,<br> Save an aged woman among those who tarried.<br> Afterward we destroyed the others.<br> And ye indeed pass by their ruined dwellings at morn<br> And night: will ye not then reflect?<br> Jonas, too, was one of the Apostles,<br> When he fled unto the laden ship,<br> And lots were cast,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> and he was doomed,<br> And the fish swallowed him, for he was blameworthy.<br> But had he not been of those who praise Us,<br> In its belly had he surely remained, till the day of resurrection.<br> And we cast him on the bare shore--and he was sick;--<br> And we caused a gourd-plant to grow up over him,<br> And we sent him to a hundred thousand persons, or even more,<br> And because they believed, we continued their enjoyments for a season.<br> Inquire then of the Meccans whether thy Lord hath daughters, and they, sons?<br> Have we created the angels females? and did they witness it?<br> Is it not a falsehood of their own devising, when they say,<br> "God hath begotten"? They are indeed liars.<br> Would he have preferred daughters to sons?<br> What reason have ye for thus judging?<br> Will ye not then receive this warning?<br> Have ye a clear proof for them?<br> Produce your Book if ye speak truth.<br> And they make him to be of kin with the Djinn: but the Djinn have long known that these idolaters shall be brought up before God.<br> Far be the glory of God from what they impute to him.<br> "His faithful servants do not thus.<br> Moreover, ye and what ye worship<br> Shall not stir up any against God,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A><br> Save him who shall burn in Hell.<br> And verily each one of us hath his appointed place,<br> And we range ourselves in order,<br> And we celebrate His praises."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A><br> And if those infidels say,<br> "Had we a revelation transmitted to us from those of old,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A><br> We had surely been God's faithful servants."<br> Yet they believe not the Koran. But they shall know its truth at last.<br> Our word came of old to our servants the apostles,<br> That they should surely be the succoured,<br> And that our armies should procure the victory for them.<br> Turn aside therefore from them for a time,<br> And behold them, for they too shall in the end behold their doom.<br> Would they then hasten our vengeance?<br> But when it shall come down into their courts, an evil morning shall it be to those who have had their warning.<br> Turn aside from them therefore for a time.<br> And behold; for they too shall in the end behold their doom.<br> Far be the glory of thy Lord, the Lord of all greatness, from what they impute to him,<br> And peace be on his Apostles!<br> And praise be to God the Lord of the worlds.</p>
