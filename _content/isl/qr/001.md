### SURA I. <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41) \[VIII.\]

MECCA.--7 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
PRAISE be to God, Lord of the worlds!  
The compassionate, the merciful!  
King on the day of reckoning!  
Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.  
Guide Thou us on the straight path, <span
id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42)  
The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious;--with whom thou art
not angry, and who go not astray. <span id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_41"></span>[1](001.htm#fr_41) This Sura, which Nöldeke
places last, and Muir sixth, in the earliest class of Meccan Suras, must
at least have been composed prior to Sura xxxvii. 182,where it is
quoted, and to Sura xv. 87, which refers to it. And it can scarcely be
an accidental circumstance that the words of the first, second, and
fifth verses do not occur in any other Suras of the first Meccan period
as given by Nöldeke, but frequently in those of the second, which it
therefore, in Nöldeke, opinion, immediately precedes. But this may be
accounted for by its having been recast for the purposes of private and
public devotion by Muhammad himself, which is the meaning probably of
the Muhammadan tradition that it was revealed twice. It should also be
observed that, including the auspicatory formula, there are the same
number of petitions in this Sura as in the Lord's Prayer. It is recited
several times in each of the five daily prayers, and on many other
occassions, as in concluding a bargain, etc. It is termed "the Opening
of the Book," "the Completion," "the Sufficing Sura," the Sura of
Praise, Thanks, and Prayer," "the Healer," "the Remedy," "the Basis,"
"the Treasure," "the Mother of the Book," "the Seven Verses of
Repetition." The Muhammadans always say "Amen" after this prayer,
Muhammad having been instructed, says the Sonna, to do so by the Angel
Gabriel.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[3](001.htm#fr_43) The following transfer of
this Sura from the Arabic into the corresponding English characters may
give some idea of the rhyming prose in which the Koran is written:

Bismillahi 'rahhmani 'rrahheem.  
El-hamdoo lillahi rabi 'lalameen.  
Arrahhmani raheem.  
Maliki yowmi-d-deen.  
Eyaka naboodoo, wa‚yaka nest aeen.  
Ihdina 'ssirat almostakeem.  
Sirat alezeena anhamta aleihim, gheiri-'l mughdoobi aleihim, wala
dsaleen.  
Ameen.
