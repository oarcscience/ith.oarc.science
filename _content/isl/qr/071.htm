<p align="center">MECCA.--29 Verses</p>  
<p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> We sent NOAH to his people, and said to him, "Warn thou thy people ere there come on them an afflictive punishment."<br> He said, "O my people! I come to you a plain-spoken warner:<br> Serve God and fear Him, and obey me:<br> Your sins will He forgive you, and respite you till the fixed Time; for when God's fixed Time hath come, it shall not be put back. Would that ye knew this!"<br> He said, "Lord I have cried to my people night and day; and my cry doth but make them flee from me the more.<br> So oft as I cry to them, that thou mayest forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears, and wrap themselves in their garments, and persist in their error, and are disdainfully disdainful.<br> Then I cried aloud to them:<br> Then again spake I with plainness, and in private did I secretly address them:<br> And I said, Beg forgiveness of your Lord, for He is ready to forgive.<br> He will send down the very Heaven upon you in plenteous rains;<br> And will increase you in wealth and children; and will give you gardens, and will give you watercourses:--<br> What hath come to you that ye hope not for goodness from the hand of God?<br> For He it is who hath formed you by successive steps.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> See ye not how God hath created the seven heavens one over the other?<br> And He hath placed therein the moon as a light, and hath placed there the sun as a torch;<br> And God hath caused you to spring forth from the earth like a plant;<br> Hereafter will He turn you back into it again, and will bring you forth anew--<br> And God hath spread the earth for you like a carpet,<br> That ye may walk therein along spacious paths."'<br> Said Noah, "O my Lord! they rebel against me, and they follow those whose riches and children do but aggravate their ruin."<br> And they plotted a great plot;<br> And they said, "Forsake not your Gods; forsake not Wadd nor Sowah,<br> Nor Yaghuth and Yahuk and Nesr;"<br> And they caused many to err;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>--and thou, too, O Muhammad! shalt be the means of increasing only error in the wicked--<br> Because of their sins they were drowned, and made to go into the Fire;<br> And they found that they had no helper save God.<br> And Noah said, "Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels on the Earth:<br> For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only sinners, infidels.<br> O my Lord, forgive me, and my parents, and every one who, being a believer, shall enter my house, and believers men and women: and add to the wicked nought but perdition."</p>
