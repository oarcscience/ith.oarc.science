### CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH

We have now traced the transmission of a particular type of Hellenistic
culture through the Syrian Church, the Zoroastrians of Persia, and the
pagans of Harran to the Islamic community, where it was rather
compromised by the patronage of those whom the official Muslim teachers
decided to regard as heretics. In spite of this censure it has left a
very distinct and enduring impression on Muslim theology and on popular
beliefs. After a chequered career in the East it passed over to the
Western Muslim community in Spain, where it had a very specialised
development, which finally made a deeper impression on Christian and
Jewish thought than on that of the Muslims themselves, and attained its
final evolution in North-East Italy, where, as an anti-ecclesiastical
influence, it prepared the way for the Renascence. But this main line of
development is not really the most important; all along that line it was
branching off on one side or another, and its richest fruits must be
sought in these side issues, in the scholasticism which, in Islam, in
Judaism, and in Christianity, was a reaction from its teaching, and in
the medical, chemical, and other scientific studies of the Middle Ages,
which largely owed their inspiration to its influence. It is the most
romantic history of culture drift which is known to us in detail.
