<p>Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d Fa&#7693;lu&#146;llah was born at Mayhana, the chief town of the Kh&aacute;war&aacute;n district of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, on the 1st of Mu&#7717;arram, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 357 (December 7th, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 967). His father Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Khayr, known in Mayhana as B&aacute;b&uacute; Bu &#146;l-Khayr, was a druggist, "a pious and religious man, well acquainted with the sacred law of Islam (<i>shar&iacute;&#145;a</i>) and with the Path of &#7778;&uacute;fisim (<i>&#7789;ar&iacute;qa</i>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>." He and other &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s were in the habit of meeting every night in the house of one of their number. Whenever a strange &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; arrived in the town, they would invite him to join them, and after partaking of food and finishing their prayers and devotions they used to listen to music and singing (<i>sam&aacute;&#145;</i>). One night, when B&aacute;b&uacute; Bu &#146;l-Khayr was going to meet his friends, his wife begged him to take Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d with him in order that the dervishes might look on him with favour; so Bu &#146;l-Khayr let the lad accompany him. As soon as it was time for the music to begin, the singer (<i>qaww&aacute;l</i>) chanted this quatrain:</p>  
<p><DIR>God gives the dervish love&#151;and love is woe;<br> By dying near and dear to Him they grow.<br> The generous youth will freely yield his life,<br> The man of God cares naught for worldly show.</DIR></p>  
<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="green">p. 4</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> On hearing this song the dervishes fell into ecstasy and kept up the dance till daybreak. The <i>qaww&aacute;l</i> sang the quatrain so often that Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d got it by heart. When he returned home, he asked his father the meaning of the verses that had thrown the dervishes into such transports of joy. "Hush!" said his father, "you cannot understand what they mean: what does it matter to you?" Afterwards, when Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d had attained to a high spiritual degree, he used sometimes to say of his father, who was then dead, "I want B&aacute;b&uacute; Bu &#146;l-Khayr to-day, to tell him that he himself did not know the meaning of what he heard on that night&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."</p>  
<p>Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was taught the first rudiments of Moslem education&#151;to read the Koran&#151;by Ab&uacute; Mu&#7717;ammad &#145;Ayy&aacute;r&iacute;, an eminent divine, who is buried at Nas&aacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. He learned grammar from Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d &#145;Ayy&aacute;r&iacute; and the principles of Islam from Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Q&aacute;sim Bishr-i Y&aacute;s&iacute;n, both of Mayhana. The latter seems to have been a remarkable man.</p>  
<p>I have already referred to the mystical quatrains which Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was fond of quoting in his discourses and which are commonly thought to be his own. Against this hypothesis we have his definite statement that these quatrains were composed by other &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s and that Bishr-i Y&aacute;s&iacute;n was the author of most of them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. From Bishr, too, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d learned the doctrine of disinterested love, which is the basis of &#7778;&uacute;fisim.</p>

<p>One day Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Q&aacute;sim Bishr-i Y&aacute;s&iacute;n (may God sanctify his honoured spirit!) said to me: "O Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, endeavour to remove self-interest (<i>&#7789;ama&#145;</i>) from thy dealings with God. So long as that exists, sincerity (<i>ikhl&aacute;&#7779;</i>) cannot be attained. Devotions inspired by self-interest are work done for wages, but devotions inspired by sincerity are work done to serve God. Learn by heart the Tradition of the Prophet&#151;<i>God said to me on the night of my Ascension, O Mohammed! as for those who would draw nigh to Me, their best means of drawing nigh is by performance of the obligations which I have laid upon them. My servant continually seeks to win My favour by works of supererogation until I love him; and when I love him, I am to him an ear and an eye and a hand and a helper: through Me he hears, and through Me he sees, and through Me he takes</i>." Bishr explained that to perform obligations means "to serve God," while to do works of supererogation means "to love God"; then he recited these lines:</p>  
<p><DIR>Perfect love proceeds from the lover who hopes naught for himself;<br> What is there to desire in that which has a price?<br> Certainly the Giver is better for you than the gift:<br> How should you want the gift, when you possess the very Philosopher's Stone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?</DIR></p>  
<p>On another occasion Bishr taught his young pupil how to practise "recollection" (<i>dhikr</i>). "Do you wish," he asked him, "to talk with God?" "Yes, of course I do," said Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d. Bishr told him that whenever he was alone he must recite the following quatrain, no more and no less:</p>  
<p><DIR>Without Thee, O Beloved, I cannot rest;<br> Thy goodness towards me I cannot reckon.<br> Tho&#146; every hair on my body becomes a tongue,<br> A thousandth part of the thanks due to Thee I cannot tell.</DIR></p>  
<p>Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was constantly repeating these words. "By the blessing which they brought," he says, "the Way to God was opened to me in my childhood." Bishr died in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 380 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 990). Whenever Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d went to the graveyard of Mayhana his first visit was always paid to the tomb of the venerated teacher who had given him his first lesson in &#7778;&uacute;fism&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

<p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A></p>  
<p>If we can believe Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d when he declares that in his youth he knew by heart 30,000 verses of pre-Islamic poetry, his knowledge of profane literature must have been extensive&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. After completing this branch of education, he set out for Merv with the purpose of studying theology under Ab&uacute; &#145;Abdallah al-&#7716;u&#7779;r&iacute;, a pupil of the famous Sh&aacute;fi&#145;ite doctor, Ibn Surayj. He read with al-&#7716;u&#7779;r&iacute; for five years, and with Ab&uacute; Bakr al-Qaff&aacute;l for five more&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. From Merv he moved to Sarakhs, where he attended the lectures of Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; Z&aacute;hir&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> on Koranic exegesis (in the morning), on systematic theology (at noon), and on the Traditions of the Prophet (in the afternoon)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's birth and death are the only events of his life to which a precise date is attached. We know that he studied at Merv for ten years, and if we assume that his <i>Wanderjahre</i> began at the usual time, he was probably between 25 and 28 when he first came to Sarakhs. Here his conversion to &#7778;&uacute;fisim took place. He has described it himself in the following narrative, which I will now translate without abridgement. I have relegated to the foot of the page, and distinguished by means of square brackets, certain passages that interrupt the narrative and did not form part of it originally.</p>  
<p>Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d said as follows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>:</p>  
<p><small>At the time when I was a student, I lived at Sarakhs and read with Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute;, the doctor of divinity. One day, as I was going into the city, I saw Luqm&aacute;n of Sarakhs seated on an ash-heap near the gate, sewing a patch on his gaberdine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>. I went up to him and</small></p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></A></p>  
<p><small>stood looking at him, while he continued to sew&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>. As soon as he had sewn the patch on, he said, "O Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d! I have sewn thee on this gaberdine along with the patch." Then he rose and took my hand, leading me to the convent (<i>kh&aacute;naq&aacute;h</i>) of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s in Sarakhs, and shouted for Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l &#7716;asan, who was within. When Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l appeared, Luqm&aacute;n placed my hand in his, saying, "O Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l, watch over this young man, for he is one of you&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A>." The Shaykh took my hand and led me into the convent. I sat down in the portico and the Shaykh picked up a volume and began to peruse it. As is the way of scholars, I could not help wondering what the book was. The Shaykh perceived my thought. "Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d!" he said, "all the hundred and twenty-four thousand prophets were sent to preach one word. They bade the people say 'Allah' and devote themselves to Him. Those who heard this word with the ear alone, let it go out by the other ear; but those who heard it with their souls imprinted it on their souls and repeated it until it penetrated their hearts and souls, and their whole being became this word. They were made independent of the pronunciation of the word, they were released from the sound and the letters. Having understood the spiritual meaning of this word, they became so absorbed in it that they were no more conscious of their own non-existence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." This saying took hold of me</small></p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></A></p>  
<p><small>and did not allow me to sleep that night. In the morning, when I had finished my prayers and devotions, I went to the Shaykh before sunrise and asked permission to attend Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute;'s lecture on Koranic exegesis. He began his lecture with the verse, <i>Say Allah! then leave them to amuse themselves in their folly</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. At the moment of hearing this word a door in my breast was opened, and I was rapt from myself. The Im&aacute;m Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; observed the change in me and asked, "Where were you last night?" I said, "With Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l &#7716;asan." He ordered me to rise and go back to Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l, saying, "It is unlawful for you to come from that subject (&#7778;&uacute;fisim) to this discourse." I returned to the Shaykh, distraught and bewildered, for I had entirely lost myself in this word. When Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l saw me, he said: "Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d!</p>  
<p><DIR><i>mastak shuda&#146;&iacute; ham&iacute; nad&aacute;n&iacute; pas u p&iacute;sh</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</DIR></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Thou art drunk, poor youth! Thou know&#146;st not head from tail."</p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> "O Shaykh!" I said, "what is thy command?" He said, "Come in and sit down and devote thyself wholly to this word, for this word hath much work to do with thee." After I had stayed with him for a long time, duly performing all that was required by this word, he said to me one day, "O Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d! the doors of the letters of this word&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> have been opened to thee. Now the hosts (of spiritual grace) will rush into thy breast, and thou wilt experience diverse kinds of self-culture (<i>adab</i>)." Then he exclaimed, "Thou hast been transported, transported, transported! Go and seek a place of solitude, and turn aside from men as thou hast turned aside from thyself, and behave with patience and resignation to God's will." I abandoned my studies and came home to Mayhana and retired into the niche of the chapel in my own house. There I sat for seven years, saying continually, "Allah! Allah! Allah!" Whenever drowsiness or inattention arising from the weakness of human nature came over me, a soldier with a fiery spear&#151;the most terrible and alarming figure that can possibly be imagined&#151;appeared in front of the niche&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and shouted at me, saying, "O Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, say Allah!" The dread of that apparition used to keep me</small></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></A></p>  
<p><small>burning and trembling for whole days and nights, so that I did not again fall asleep or become inattentive; and at last every atom of me began to cry aloud, "Allah! Allah! Allah!"</small></p>  
<p>Countless records of mystical conversion bear witness to the central fact in this description&#151;the awakening of the soul in response to some unsuspected stimulus, by which, as Arnold says,</p>  
<p><DIR><small>A bolt is shot back somewhere in the breast,</small></DIR></p>  
<p>opening a way for the flood of transcendental consciousness to burst through. The accompanying ecstasy is a normal feature, and so is the abandonment of past occupations, habits, ambitions, and the fixing of every faculty upon that supreme reality which is henceforth the single object of desire. All these phenomena, however sudden they may seem, are the climax of an interior conflict that perhaps only makes itself known at the moment when it is already decided. Probably in Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's case the process was at least to some extent a conscious one. He had been long and earnestly engaged in the study of theology.</p>  
<p><small>I possessed many books and papers, but though I used to turn them over and read them one after the other, I was never finding any peace. I prayed to God, saying, "O Lord, nothing is revealed to my heart by all this study and learning: it causes me to lose Thee, O God! Let me be able to do without it by giving me something in which I shall find Thee again&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."</small></p>  
<p>Here Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d acknowledges that he sought spiritual peace, and that all his efforts to win it from intellectual proofs ended in failure. The history of that struggle is unwritten, but not until the powers of intellect were fully tried and shown to be of no avail, could mightier forces drawn from a deeper source come overwhelmingly into action. As regards the perpetual iteration of the name Allah, I need hardly remind my readers that this is a method everywhere practised by Moslem mystics for bringing about <i>fan&aacute;</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the passing-away from self, or in Pascal's phrase, "oubli du monde et de tout hormis Dieu."</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></A></p>  
<p>We have seen that the first act of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d after his conversion was to enquire of Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l what he must do next. That is to say, he had implicitly accepted Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l as his spiritual director, in accordance with the rule that "if any one by means of asceticism and self-mortification shall have risen to an exalted degree of mystical experience, <i>without having a P&iacute;r to whose authority and example he submits himself</i>, the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s do not regard him as belonging to their community&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." In this way a continuous tradition of mystical doctrine is secured, beginning with the Prophet and carried down through a series of dead P&iacute;rs to the living director who forms the last link of the chain until he too dies and is succeeded by one of his pupils.</p>  
<p>Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's lineage as a &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; is given in the following table:</p>  
<p><DIR>Mohammed, the Prophet<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> &#145;Al&iacute; (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 661)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> &#7716;asan of Basra (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 728)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> &#7716;ab&iacute;b &#145;Ajam&iacute; (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 737)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> D&aacute;wud &#7788;&aacute;&#146;&iacute; (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 781)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> Ma&#145;r&uacute;f Karkh&iacute; (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 815)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> Sar&iacute; Saqa&#7789;&iacute; (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 867)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> Junayd of Baghd&aacute;d (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 909)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> Murta&#145;ish of Baghd&aacute;d (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 939)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> Ab&uacute; Na&#7779;r al-Sarr&aacute;j of &#7788;&uacute;s (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 988)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l &#7716;asan of Sarakhs<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br> Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d ibn Abi &#146;l-Khayr</DIR></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></A></p>  
<p>The appearance of Mohammed and his son-in-law at the head of a list of this kind fits in with the fiction&#151;which was necessary for the existence of &#7778;&uacute;fisim within Islam&#151;that the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s are the legitimate heirs and true interpreters of the esoteric teaching of the Prophet. &#7716;asan of Basra, &#7716;ab&iacute;b &#145;Ajam&iacute;, and D&aacute;wud &#7788;&aacute;&#146;&iacute; were ascetics and quietists rather than mystics. Even if we take the ninth century as a starting-point, it must not be supposed that any fixed body of doctrine was handed down. Such a thing is foreign to the nature of &#7778;&uacute;fism, which essentially is not a system based on authority and tradition, but a free movement assuming infinitely various forms in obedience to the inner light of the individual soul. Before the time of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, certain eminent theosophists&#151;Junayd, for instance&#151;had founded schools which owed their origin to controversies over particular questions of mystical theory and practice, while at a later period &#7778;&uacute;fism branched off into great organisations comparable to the Christian monastic orders. Everywhere we find divergent tendencies asserting themselves and freely developing a vigorous life.</p>  
<p>There is no difficulty in believing that Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, after passing through the spiritual crisis which has been described, returned to Mayhana and spent some time in solitary meditation, though doubts are suggested by the statement, which occurs in the two oldest biographies, that his seclusion (<i>khalwat</i>) lasted for seven years. According to the <i>&#7716;&aacute;l&aacute;t &uacute; Sukhun&aacute;n</i>, at the end of this period&#151;Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l having died in the meanwhile&#151;he journeyed to &Aacute;mul in order to visit Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#145;Abb&aacute;s Qa&#7779;&#7779;&aacute;b&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The <i>Asr&aacute;r</i>, however, mentions a second period during which he practised the most severe austerities, first at Sarakhs under the care of Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l and then, for seven years&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, in the deserts and mountains of Mayhana, until at the age of 40 he attained to perfect saintship. These numbers can only be regarded as evidence of a desire to make him exemplify a theoretically symmetrical scheme of the mystic's progress towards perfection, but it is none the less probable that for many years</p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></A></p>  
<p>after his conversion Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was painfully treading the <i>via purgativa</i>, which &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s call "the Path" (<i>&#7789;ar&iacute;qa</i>). His biographers give an interesting account of his self-mortification (<i>muj&aacute;hada</i>). The details are derived either from his public discourses or from the testimony of eye-witnesses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The author of the <i>Asr&aacute;r</i> relates that after seven years of solitary retirement Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d came back to Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l, who gave him a cell opposite his own, in order that he might keep him always under observation, and prescribed such moral and ascetic discipline as was necessary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. When some time had passed, he was transferred to the cell of Ab&uacute; l-Fad' himself and subjected to still closer supervision (mur&aacute;qabat-i a&#7717;w&aacute;l). We are not told how long he remained in the convent at Sarakhs. At last Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l bade him return to Mayhana and take care of his mother. Here he lived in a cell, apparently in his father's house, though he also frequented several cloisters in the neighbourhood, especially one known as "The Old Cloister" (<i>Rib&aacute;&#7789;-i Kuhan</i>) on the Merv road&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Among the ascetic exercises in which he was now constantly engaged the following are recorded&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>:</p>  
<p>He showed excessive zeal in his religious ablutions, emptying a number of water-jugs for every single <i>wu&#7693;&uacute;&#146;</i>.</p>  
<p>He was always washing the door and walls of his cell.</p>  
<p>He never leaned against any door or wall, or rested his body on wood or on a cushion, or reclined on a couch.</p>  
<p>All the time he wore only one shirt, which gradually increased in weight because, whenever it was torn, he would sew a patch on it. At last it weighed 20 maunds.</p>  
<p>He never quarrelled with any one nor spoke to any one, except when necessity forced him to do so.</p>  
<p>He ate no food by day, and broke his fast with nothing more than a piece of bread.</p>  
<p>He did not sleep by day or night but shut himself in his cell, where he had made an excavation in the wall, just high and broad enough to stand in, which could be closed by means</p>

<p>of a door. He used to stand here and close the door and occupy himself with recollection (<i>dhikr</i>), stuffing his ears with cotton-wool in order that no disturbing sound might reach him, and that his attention might remain concentrated. At the same time he never ceased to watch over his inmost self (<i>mur&aacute;qabat-i sirr</i>), in order that no thought except of God might cross his mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>After a while he became unable to bear the society or even the sight of men. He wandered alone in desert and mountainous places and would often disappear for a month or more. His father used to go in search of him and find out where he was from labourers or travellers who had seen him. To please his father, he would come home, but ere long he would feel the presence of human creatures to be unendurable and would again flee to mountains and wildernesses, where he was sometimes seen roaming with a venerable old man clad in white raiment. Many years afterwards, when Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d had risen to eminence, he declared to those who questioned him that this old man was the prophet Kha&#7693;ir&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Although he was carefully watched, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d contrived to escape from his father's house night after night. On one occasion his father (who felt a natural anxiety as to the object of these nocturnal excursions) followed him, unperceived, at a little distance.</p>  
<p><small>My son (he relates) walked on until he reached the Old Cloister (<i>Rib&aacute;&#7789;-i Kuhan</i>). He entered it and shut the gate behind him, while I went up on the roof. I saw him go into a chapel, which was in the <i>rib&aacute;&#7789;</i>, and close the door. Looking through the chapel window, I waited to see what would happen. There was a stick lying on the floor, and it had a rope fastened to it. He took up the stick and tied the end of the rope to his foot. Then, laying the stick across the top of a pit that was at the corner of the chapel, he slung himself into the pit head downwards, and began to recite the Koran. He remained in that posture until daybreak, when, having recited the whole Koran, he raised himself from the pit, replaced the stick where he had found it, opened the door, came out of the chapel, and commenced to perform his ablution in the middle</small></p>

<p>The following passage illustrates another side of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's asceticism. He said,</p>  
<p><small>One day I said to myself, "Knowledge, works, meditation&#151;I have them all; now I want to become absent from them (<i>ghaybat&iacute; az &iacute;n</i>)." On consideration I saw that the only way to attain this was by acting as a servant to the dervishes, for <i>when God wishes to benefit a man, He shows to him the path of self-abasement</i>. Accordingly I made it my business to wait upon them, and I used to clean their cells and privies and lavatories. I persevered in this work for a long time, until it became a habit. Then I resolved to beg for the dervishes, which seemed to me the hardest thing I could lay upon myself. At first, when people saw me begging, they would give me a piece of gold, but soon it was only copper, and by degrees it came down to a single raisin or nut. In the end even this was refused. One day I was with a number of dervishes, and there was nothing to be got for them. For their sake I parted with the turban I had on my head, then I sold one after the other my slippers, the lining of my <i>jubba</i>, the cloth of which it was made, and the cotton quilting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</small></p>  
<p>During the period of ascetic discipline which he underwent at Mayhana, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d sometimes visited Sarakhs for the purpose of receiving spiritual guidance from Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l. His biographer says that he travelled on his bare feet, but if we may trust &#145;Abdu &#146;l-&#7778;amad, one of his disciples, he usually flew through the air; it is added that this phenomenon was witnessed only by persons of mystical insight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. According to the <i>Asr&aacute;r</i>, he returned to Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l for another year's training and was then sent by him to Ab&uacute; &#145;Ab&uacute; <i>al-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n</i> al-Sulam&iacute;, who invested him with the patched frock (<i>khirqa</i>) that proclaims the wearer to be a recognised member of the brotherhood of &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Al-Sulam&iacute; of N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1021), a pupil of Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Q&aacute;sim al-Na&#7779;r&aacute;b&aacute;d&iacute;, was a celebrated mystic.</p>  
<p>He is the author of the <i>&#7788;abaq&aacute;tu &#146;l-&#7778;&uacute;fiyya</i>&#151;biographies of the early &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; Shaykhs&#151;and other important works.</p>  
<p>On Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's return, Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l said to him,</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> "Now all is finished. You must go to Mayhana and call the people to God and admonish them and show them the way to the Truth." He came back to Mayhana, as his Director enjoined, but instead of contenting himself with Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l's assurance that all was now finished, he increased his austerities and was more assiduous than ever in his devotions. In the following discourse he refers to the veneration which the people began to manifest towards him at this time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><small>When I was a novice, I bound myself to do eighteen things: I fasted continually; I abstained from unlawful food; I practised recollection (<i>dhikr</i>) uninterruptedly; I kept awake at night; I never reclined on the ground; I never slept but in a sitting posture; I sat facing the Ka&#145;ba; I never leaned against anything; I never looked at a handsome youth or at women whom it would have been unlawful for me to see unveiled; I did not beg; I was content and resigned to God's will; I always sat in the mosque and did not go into the market, because the Prophet said that the market is the filthiest of places and the mosque the cleanest. In all my acts I was a follower of the Prophet. Every four-and-twenty hours I completed a recitation of the Koran. In my seeing I was blind, in my hearing deaf, in my speaking dumb. For a whole year I conversed with no one. People called me a lunatic, and I allowed them to give me that name, relying on the Tradition that a man's faith is not made perfect until he is supposed to be mad. I performed everything that I had read or heard of as having been done or commanded by the Prophet. Having read that when he was wounded in the foot in the battle of U&#7717;ud, he stood on his toes in order to perform his devotions&#151;for he could not set the sole of his foot upon the ground&#151;I resolved to imitate him, and standing on tiptoe I performed a prayer of 400 genuflexions. I modelled my actions, outward and inward, upon the Sunna of the Prophet, so that habit at last became nature. Whatever I had heard or found in books concerning the acts of worship performed by the angels, I performed the same. I had heard and seen in writing that some angels worship God on their heads. Therefore I placed my head on the ground and bade the blessed mother of Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir tie my toe with a cord and fasten the cord to a peg and then</small></p>

<p><small>shut the door behind her. Being left alone, I said, "O Lord! I do not want myself: let me escape from myself!" and I began a recitation of the whole Koran. When I came to the verse, <i>God shall suffice thee against them, for He heareth and knoweth all</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, blood poured from my eyes and I was no longer conscious of myself. Then things changed. Ascetic experiences passed over me of a kind that can be described in words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and God strengthened and aided me therein, but I fancied that all these acts were done by me. The grace of God became manifest and showed me that this was not so, and that these were the acts of divine favour and grace. I repented of my belief and realised that it was mere self-conceit. Now if you say that you will not tread this path because it is self-conceit, I reply that your refusal to tread it is self-conceit. Until you have undergone all this, its self-conceit will not be revealed to you. Self-conceit appears only when you fulfil the Law, for self-conceit lies in religion, and religion is of the Law. To abstain from religious acts is infidelity, and to perform such acts self-consciously is dualism. If "thou" exists and "He" exists, "two" exists; and that is dualism. You must put your "self" away altogether.</p>  
<p>I had a cell in which I sat, and sitting there I was enamoured of passing-away from myself. A light flashed upon me, which utterly destroyed the darkness of my being. God . Almighty revealed to me that I was neither that nor this: that this was His grace even as that was His gift. So it came to pass that I said:</p>  
<p><DIR>When I mine eyes have opened, all Thy beauty I behold;<br> When I tell Thee my secret, all my body is ensouled.<br> Methinks, unlawful &#146;tis for me to talk with other men,<br> But when with Thee I am talking, ah! the tale is never told.</DIR></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Then the people began to regard me with great approval. Disciples gathered round me and were converted to &#7778;&uacute;fisim. My neighbours too showed their respect for me by ceasing to drink wine. This proceeded so far that a melon-skin which I had thrown away was bought for twenty pieces of gold. One day when I was riding on horseback, my horse dropped dung. Eager to gain a blessing, the people came and picked up the dung and smeared their heads and faces with it. After a time it was revealed to me that I was not the real object of their veneration. A voice cried from the corner of the mosque, <i>Is not thy Lord enough for thee</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>?</small></p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> <small>A light gleamed in my breast, and most veils were removed. The people who had honoured me now rejected me, and even went before the cadi to bear witness that I was an infidel. The inhabitants of every place that I entered declared that their crops would not grow on account of my wickedness. Once, whilst I was seated in the mosque, the women went up on to the roof and bespattered me with filth; and still I heard a voice saying, <i>Is not thy Lord enough for thee?</i> The congregation desisted from their prayers, saying, "We will not pray together so long as this madman is in the mosque." Meanwhile I was reciting these verses:</p>  
<p><DIR>I was a lion&#151;the fierce pard was ware<br> Of my pursuit. I conquered everywhere.<br> But since I drew Thy love close to my heart,<br> Lame foxes drive me from my forest-lair.</DIR></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> This joyous transport was followed by a painful contraction (<i>qab&#7693;</i>). I opened the Koran, and my eye fell on the verse, <i>We will prove you with evil and with good, to try you; and unto Us shall ye return</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, as though God said to me, "All this which I put in thy way is a trial. If it is good, it is a trial, and if it is evil, it is a trial. Do not stoop to good or to evil, but dwell with Me!" Once more my "self" vanished, and His grace was all in all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</small></p>  
<p>After the death of his father and mother&#151;which the biographer leaves undated, only observing, in the spirit of a true &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;, that these events removed the obstacle of filial affection from his path&#151;Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d is said to have roamed for seven years in the deserts between Mayhana and B&aacute;ward (Ab&iacute;ward) and between Merv and Sarakhs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. He then returned to Mayhana. By this time Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l, to whom he had hitherto confided all his perplexities, was dead. Feeling that he required a spiritual Director, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d set out for &Aacute;mul in &#7788;abarist&aacute;n, whither many &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s were flocking in consequence of the fame of Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#145;Abb&aacute;s Qa&#7779;&#7779;&aacute;b. He was accompanied by A&#7717;mad Najj&aacute;r and Mu&#7717;ammad Fa&#7693;l, his disciple and lifelong friend, who is buried at Sarakhs.

<p>valley, having performed their ablutions and prayers on the rocky bank of a stream, they were approaching the tomb of Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; <A NAME="img_01800"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/01800.jpg"> (?), which it was their purpose to visit, when they saw a lad driving an ox and ploughing, and on the edge of the field an old man sowing millet-seed. The old man seemed to have lost his wits, for he was always looking towards the tomb and uttering loud cries.</p>  
<p><small>"We were deeply moved," said Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, "by his behaviour. He came to meet us and salaamed and said, 'Can you lift a burden from my breast?' 'If God will,' I replied. 'I have been thinking,' he said, 'if God, when He created the world, had created no creatures in it; and if He had filled it full of millet from East to West and from earth to heaven; and if then He had created one bird and bidden it eat one grain of this millet every thousand years; and if, after that, He had created a man and had kindled in his heart this mystic longing and had told him that he would never win to his goal until this bird left not a single millet-seed in the whole world, and that he would continue until then in this burning pain of love&#151;I have been thinking, it would still be a thing soon ended!' The words of the old peasant (said Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d) made all the mystery plain to me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."</small></p>  
<p>Nas&aacute;, which the travellers skirted but did not enter, was known amongst &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s by the name of "Little Syria" (<i>Sh&aacute;m-i k&uacute;chak</i>), because it boasted as many tombs of saints as Syria of prophets. The author of the <i>Asr&aacute;r</i> says that in his time the cemetery overlooking the town contained 400 sepulchres of great Shaykhs and holy men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

<p>during the massacres and ravages of more than thirty years.</p>  
<p><small>Every calamity that threatened Nas&aacute; has been averted by the favour and kindness of God and by the blessings of the tombs of departed Shaykhs and by the prayers of the living. Even now (he continues), when religion in Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n is almost extinct and scarcely any vestige of &#7778;&uacute;fisim is left, there are still in Nas&aacute; many excellent Shaykhs and &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, richly endowed with inward experiences, as well as numerous hidden saints who exert a powerful and beneficent influence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</small></p>  
<p>In the upper part of the town, adjoining the cemetery, stood a convent for &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, the Kh&aacute;naq&aacute;h-i Sar&aacute;w&iacute;. It had recently been founded by the famous mystic, Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; Daqq&aacute;q of N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r (<i>ob</i>. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1015). The legend concerning its foundation was that Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; had a dream in which the Prophet ordered him to build a house for &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, and not only pointed out the site but also drew a line showing its dimensions. Next morning, when Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; went to the place indicated, he and all those who were with him saw a line distinctly marked on the ground; and upon this line the outer wall of the convent was raised&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. When Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d arrived at Yaysama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, a village in the neighbourhood of Nas&aacute;, he went to visit the tomb of A&#7717;mad &#145;Al&iacute; Nasaw&iacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Meanwhile Shaykh A&#7717;mad Na&#7779;r&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, who was then in charge of the convent at Nas&aacute;, put out his head from his cell and said to the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s seated in the portico, "The royal falcon of the mystic Way (<i>sh&aacute;hb&aacute;z-i &#7789;ar&iacute;qa</i>) is passing!

<p>friends noticed a butcher who wore a fur gaberdine (<i>p&uacute;st&iacute;n</i>) and was seated in his shop, with pieces of meat hanging in front of him. He came forward to greet the strangers, and bade an apprentice follow them and see where they lodged. They found quarters in a mosque beside the river, and when they had performed their ablutions and prayers the butcher appeared, bringing some viands of which they partook.</p>  
<p><small>"After we had done," said Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, "he asked whether any of us could answer a question. My friends pointed to me. He then said, 'What is the duty of a slave and what is the duty of a labourer for hire?' I replied in terms of the religious law. He asked, 'Is there nothing else?' I remained silent. With a stern look he exclaimed, 'Do not live with one whom thou hast divorced!' meaning that since I had discarded exoteric knowledge (<i>&#145;ilm-i &#7827;&aacute;hir</i>), I must not have any further dealings with it. Then he added, 'Until thou art free, thou wilt never be a slave&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and until thou art an honest and sincere labourer, thou wilt never receive the wages of everlasting bliss.'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></small></p>  
<p>To digress a little, as the leisurely style of Oriental biography permits, it will be remembered that on his conversion to &#7778;&uacute;fisim Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d immediately abandoned the study of theology and jurisprudence in which he had spent so much of his youth. He collected all the volumes that he had read, together with his own note-books, buried them, and erected over them a mound of stone and earth (<i>d&uacute;k&aacute;n&iacute;</i>). On this mound he planted a twig of myrtle, which took root and put forth leaves, and in the course of time became a large tree. The people of Mayhana used to pluck boughs from it, hoping thereby to win a blessing for their new-born children, or in order to lay them on their dead before interment. The author of the <i>Asr&aacute;r</i>, who had often seen it and admired its beautiful foliage, says that it was destroyed, with other relics of the saint, during the invasion of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n by the Ghuzz&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. When Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d buried his books, it was suggested that he might have done better to give them to some one who would</p>

<p>profit by reading them. "I wished," he said, "that my heart should be entirely void of the consciousness of having conferred an obligation and of the recollection of having bestowed a gift&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." Once he was heard wailing in his cell the whole night long. Next morning he explained that he had been visited with a violent toothache as a punishment for having dipped into a tome which he took away from a student&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Here are two more of his sayings on the same topic: "Books! ye are excellent guides, but it is absurd to trouble about a guide after the goal has been reached." "The first step in this affair (&#7778;&uacute;fisim) is the breaking of ink-pots&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the tearing-up of books and the forgetting of all kinds of (intellectual) knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>."</p>  
<p>We left Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d on his way to &Aacute;mul. He is said to have resided there for one year&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> in the convent of which Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#145;Abb&aacute;s Qa&#7779;&#7779;&aacute;b was the head. The Shaykh gave him a cell in the assembly-room (<i>jam&aacute;&#145;at-kh&aacute;na</i>), facing the oratory&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> reserved for himself, where he had sat for forty-one years in the midst of his disciples&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. It was the custom of Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#145;Abb&aacute;s, when he saw a dervish performing supererogatory prayers at night, to say to him, "Sleep, my son! All the devotions of your Director are performed for your sake, for they are of no use to him and he does not need them himself"; but he never said this to Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, who used to pray all night and fast all day. During the night Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d kept his eyes continually fixed upon his navel, and his mind upon the spiritual "states" (<i>a&#7717;w&aacute;l</i>) and acts of the Shaykh. One day the Shaykh had some blood let from his arm. At night the bandage slipped off, uncovering the vein, so that his garment was stained with blood. As he came out of the oratory, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, who was always on the watch to serve him, ran up to</p>

<p>him, washed and bandaged his arm, and taking from him the soiled garment offered his own, which the Shaykh put on, while Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d clad himself in a <i>khashan</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that he had. Then he washed and cleaned the Shaykh's garment, hung it on the rope (<i>&#7717;abl</i>) to dry, rubbed and folded it, and brought it to the Shaykh. "It is thine," said the Shaykh, "put it on!" "Nay," cried Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, "let the Shaykh put it on me with his own blessed hand!"</p>  
<p>This was the second gaberdine (<i>khirqa</i>) with which Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was invested, for he had already received one from Ab&uacute; &#145;Ab&uacute; <i>al-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n</i> al-Sulam&iacute; of N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Here the author of the <i>Asr&aacute;r</i> introduces a disquisition on the meaning of such investiture&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, with the object of refuting those who hold that a S&uacute;f&iacute; ought not to accept a <i>khirqa</i> from more than one P&iacute;r. In the first place, he describes the endowments in virtue of which the P&iacute;r is privileged to invest a disciple with the <i>khirqa</i>. The P&iacute;r should be worthy of imitation, <i>i.e.</i>, he should have a perfect knowledge, both theoretical and practical, of the three stages of the mystical life&#151;the Law, the Path, and the Truth; he should also be entirely purged of fleshly attributes (<i>&#7779;if&aacute;t-i bashariyya</i>), so that nothing of his lower "self" (<i>nafs</i>) remains in him. When such a P&iacute;r has become thoroughly acquainted with a disciple's acts and thoughts and has proved them by the test of experience and, through spiritual insight, knows that he is qualified to advance beyond the position of a famulus (<i>maq&aacute;m-i khidmat</i>)&#151;whether his being thus qualified is due to the training which he has received from this P&iacute;r or to the guidance and direction of another P&iacute;r possessing a like authority&#151;then he lays his hand on the disciple's head and invests him with the <i>khirqa</i>. By the act of investiture he announces his conviction that the disciple is fit to associate with the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, and if he is a person of credit and renown amongst them, his declaration carries the same weight as, in matters of law, the testimony of an</p>

<p>honest witness and the sentence of an incorruptible judge. Accordingly, whenever an unknown dervish comes into a convent or wishes to join a company of &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, they ask him, "Who was the P&iacute;r that taught thee&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?" and "From whose hand didst thou receive the <i>khirqa</i>?" &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s recognise no relationship but these two, which they regard as all-important. They do not allow any one to associate with them, unless he can show to their satisfaction that he is lineally connected in both these ways with a fully accredited P&iacute;r.</p>  
<p>Having insisted that the whole Path of &#7778;&uacute;fisim turns upon the P&iacute;r (<i>mad&aacute;r-i &#7789;ar&iacute;qa bar p&iacute;r ast</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>), the author of the <i>Asr&aacute;r</i> comes to the question in dispute&#151;"Is it right to receive investiture from the hands of more than one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>?" He answers, in effect, "Yes, it is right, provided that the second investiture is not accompanied with the intention of annulling the first&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>." His argument is a universal principle, which can be stated in a few words. Ultimately and essentially all things are one. Difference and duality are phenomena which disappear when unity is reached. The sayings of the great mystics differ in expression, but their meaning is the same. There are many religions, but only one God; diverse ways, but only one goal. Hence those who raise an objection against the double investiture proclaim themselves to be still on the plane of dualism, which the P&iacute;rs have transcended. In reality, all &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, all P&iacute;rs, and all <i>khirqas</i> are one. Amidst these sublime truths it is rather a shock to meet with the remark that the novice who receives two <i>khirqas</i> resembles a man who calls two witnesses to attest his competence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.</p>

This event approximately coincides with the beginning of a new period in his spiritual history. The long discipline of the Path, broken by fleeting visions and ecstasies, brought him at last into the full and steady splendour of illumination. The veil, which had hitherto been lifted only to fall again, was now burst asunder. Henceforth no barrier (<i>&#7717;ij&aacute;b</i>) in the shape of "self"&#151;that insidious obstacle which it is the whole business of the via purgative to remove&#151;could even temporarily shut off his consciousness of the Unseen. While conversing with Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; Daqq&aacute;q, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d asked him whether this experience was ever permanent. " No," said Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute;. Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d bowed his head, then he repeated the question and received the same answer, whereupon he bowed his head as before. On being asked for the third time, Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; replied, "If it ever is permanent, it is extremely rare." Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d clapped his hands joyfully and exclaimed several times, "This"&#151;referring to his own case&#151;"is one of these rarities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>." Continuous though his illumination may have been, it was not of uniform intensity, but was subject to the fluctuations which are described in the technical language of &#7778;&uacute;fisim as contraction (<i>qab&#7693;</i>) and expansion (<i>bas&#7789;</i>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Often, when he fell into the former state, he would go about asking questions of every one, in the hope of hearing some words that might relieve his oppression&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. When <i>qab&#7693;</i> was violent, he would visit the tomb of Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l &#7716;asan at Sarakhs. His eldest son, Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir, relates that one day Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, while preaching, began to weep, and the whole congregation wept with him. Giving orders that his horse should be saddled, he immediately set out for Sarakhs, accompanied by all who were present. As soon as they entered the desert, his feeling of "contraction" was dispelled. He began to speak freely, while those around him shouted with joy. On arriving at Sarakhs he turned aside from the highroad in the direction</p>

<p>of the tomb of Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l &#7716;asan and bade the <i>qaww&aacute;l</i> sing this verse:</p>  
<p><DIR>Here is the mansion of delight, the home of bounty and of grace!<br> All eyes towards the Ka&#145;ba turn, but ours to the Beloved's face.</DIR></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> During the <i>qaww&aacute;l's</i> chant Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d and the dervishes with bare heads and feet circumambulated the tomb, shrieking ecstatically. When quiet was restored, he said, "Mark the date of this day, for you will never see a day like this again." Afterwards he used to tell any of his disciples who thought of making the pilgrimage to Mecca that they must visit the tomb of Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l &#7716;asan and perform seven circumambulations there&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>It is stated on the authority of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's grandson, Shaykhu &#146;l-Isl&aacute;m Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, who was the grandfather of Mu&#7717;ammad ibnu &#146;l-Munawwar, the compiler of the <i>Asr&aacute;r</i>, that Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d attained to perfect illumination at the age of forty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. That statement may be approximately correct, though we cannot help regarding as suspicious its combination with the theory founded on a passage in the Koran&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that no one under forty years of age ever attained to the rank of prophecy or saintship, excepting only Ya&#7717;y&aacute; ibn Zakariyy&aacute; (John the Baptist) and Jesus. At this point the biographer concludes the first chapter of his work, describing Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's conversion and novitiate, and enters on the mature period of his mystical life&#151;the period of illumination and contemplation.</p>  
<p>In the foregoing pages we have been mainly concerned with his progress as an ascetic. We are now to see him as Theosophist and Saint. It must be added, however, that in this higher stage he did not discontinue his austerities. He took pains to conceal them, and all our information about them is derived from allusions in his public speeches or from the exhortations which he addressed to novices. According to his disciples, after becoming an adept there was no rule or practice of the Prophet that he left unperformed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>for Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's biography, consisting for the most part of miscellaneous anecdotes, are of such a kind that it is impossible to give a connected account of events in their chronological order. Concerning his movements we know nothing of importance beyond the following facts:</p>  
<p>(a) He left Mayhana and journeyed to N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r, where he stayed for a considerable time.</p>  
<p>(b) Shortly before quitting N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r he paid a visit to Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan Kharaq&aacute;n&iacute; at Kharaq&aacute;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>(c) Finally, he returned from N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r to Mayhana. The anecdotes in the second chapter of the <i>Asr&aacute;r</i> form three groups in correspondence with this local division:</p>  
<p><DIR>1. N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r (pp. 68-174).</p>  
<p>2. Kharaq&aacute;n (pp. 175-190).</p>  
<p>3. Mayhana (pp. 191-247).</DIR></p>  
<p>Various circumstances indicate that his residence in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r was a long one, probably extending over several years, but we find no precise statement&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and the evidence that can be obtained from his reported meetings with famous contemporaries is insufficient, in my opinion, to serve as a basis for investigation. His visit to Kharaq&aacute;n supplies a <i>terminus ad quem</i>, for Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan Kharaq&aacute;n&iacute; is known to have died in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 425 = <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1033-4. Unless the stories of his friendship with Qushayr&iacute; are inventions, he can hardly have settled in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r before <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 415 = <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1024, since Qushayr&iacute; (born <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 376 = <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 986) is described at the date of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's arrival as a celebrated teacher with numerous pupils.</p>  
<p>For the reasons mentioned above, we must now content ourselves with the barest outline of a narrative and seek compensation in episodes, incidents, and details which often reveal the personality and character of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d in a surprising</p>

<p>manner and at the same time let us see how the monastic life was lived and by what methods it was organised.</p>  
<p>When Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d set out for N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r, he did not travel alone, but was attended by the disciples whom he had already gathered round him at Mayhana, while many new converts joined the party at &#7788;&uacute;s. Here he preached to crowded assemblies and moved his audience to tears. On one of these occasions an infant fell from the gallery (<i>b&aacute;m</i>), which was thronged with women. Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d exclaimed, "Save it!" A hand appeared in the air and caught the child and placed it unhurt on the floor. The spectators raised a great cry and scenes of ecstasy ensued. "I swear," says Sayyid Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute;, who relates the story, "that I saw this with my own eyes. If I did not see it, may both my eyes become blind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!" At &#7788;&uacute;s Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d is said to have passed by a number of children standing together in the street of the Christians (<i>k&uacute;y-i tars&aacute;y&aacute;n</i>) and to have pointed out one of them to his companions, saying, "If you wish to look at the prime minister of the world, there he is!" The boy, whose future eminence was thus miraculously foretold, and who, forty years afterwards, repeated those prophetic words to a great-grandson of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, was the illustrious statesman Ni&#7827;&aacute;mu &#146;l-Mulk (born <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1018)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>On entering N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was met by an influential patron of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, Khw&aacute;ja Ma&#7717;m&uacute;d-i Mur&iacute;d, who installed him and his disciples in the monastery (<i>kh&aacute;naq&aacute;h</i>) of Ab&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; &#7788;aras&uacute;s&iacute; in the street of the carpet-beaters (?)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, which seems to have been his headquarters as long as he remained in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. His preaching and, above all, the extraordinary powers of telepathy which he displayed in public made many converts and brought in large sums of money&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. &#7716;asan-i</p>

<p><small>When people were proclaiming everywhere in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r that a &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; P&iacute;r had arrived from Mayhana and was preaching sermons in the street of the carpet-beaters and was reading men's secret thoughts, I said to myself&#151;for I hated the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s&#151;"How can a &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; preach, when he knows nothing about theology? How can he read men's thoughts, when God has not given knowledge of the Unseen to any prophet or to any other person?" One day I went to the hall where he preached, with the intention of putting him to the proof, and sat down in front of his chair. I was handsomely dressed and had a turban of fine &#7788;abar&iacute; stuff wound on my head. While the Shaykh was speaking, I regarded him with feelings of hostility and disbelief. Having finished his sermon, he asked for clothes on behalf of a dervish. Every one offered something. Then he asked for a turban. I thought of giving mine, but again I reflected that it had been brought to me from &Aacute;mul as a present and that it was worth ten N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r&iacute; d&iacute;n&aacute;rs, so I resolved not to give it. The Shaykh made a second appeal, and the same thought occurred to me, but I rejected it once more. An old man who was seated beside me asked, "O Shaykh! does God plead with His creatures?" He answered, "Yes, but He does not plead more than twice for the sake of a &#7788;abar&iacute; turban. He has already spoken twice to the man sitting beside you and has told him to give to this dervish the turban which he is wearing, but he refuses to do so, because it is worth ten pieces of gold and was brought to him from &Aacute;mul as a present." On hearing these words, I rose, trembling, and went forward to the Shaykh and kissed his foot and offered my turban and my whole suit of clothes to the dervish. Every feeling of dislike and incredulity was gone. I became a Moslem anew, bestowed on the Shaykh all the money and wealth I possessed, and devoted myself to his service&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</small></p>  
<p>While Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was enthusiastically welcomed by the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s of N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r, he met with formidable opposition from the parties adverse to them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, namely, the Karr&aacute;m&iacute;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, whose</p>

<p>chief was Ab&uacute; Bakr Is&#7717;&aacute;q, and the <i>A&#7779;&#7717;&aacute;b-i ra&#146;y </i>(liberal theologians) and Sh&iacute;&#145;ites led by Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; &#7778;&aacute;&#145;id. The leaders of those parties drew up a written charge against him, to the following effect:</p>  
<p><small>A certain man has come hither from Mayhana and pretends to be a &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;. He preaches sermons in the course of which he recites poetry but does not quote the Traditions of the Prophet. He holds sumptuous feasts and music is played by his orders, whilst the young men dance and eat sweetmeats&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and roasted fowls and all kinds of fruit. He declares that he is an ascetic, but this is neither asceticism nor &#7778;&uacute;fisim. Multitudes have joined him and are being led astray. Unless measures be taken to repair it, the mischief will soon become universal.</small></p>  
<p>The authorities at the court of Ghazna, to whom the document was sent, returned it with the following answer written on the back: "Let the leaders of the Sh&aacute;fi&#145;ites and &#7716;anafites sit in council and inquire into his case and duly inflict upon him whatever penalty the religious law demands." This answer was received on a Thursday. The enemies of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d rejoiced and immediately held a meeting and determined that on Saturday he and all the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s should be gibbeted in the market-place. His friends were anxious and alarmed by rumours of what was impending, but none dared tell him, since he desired to have nothing communicated to him, and in fact always knew by miraculous intuition all that was going on.</p>  
<p><small>When we had performed the afternoon prayers (says &#7716;asan-i Mu&#146;addib), the Shaykh called me and asked, "How many are the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s?" I replied, "A hundred and twenty&#151;eighty travellers (<i>mus&aacute;fir</i>) and forty residents (<i>muq&iacute;m</i>)." "To-morrow," said he, "what will you give them for dinner?" "Whatever the Shaykh bids," I replied. "You must place before each one," said he, "a lamb's head and provide plenty of crushed sugar to sprinkle on the lamb's brains, and let each one have a pound of khal&iacute;fat&iacute; sweets, and see that there is no lack of aloes-wood for burning and rose-water for spraying over them, and get well-laundered linen robes.</small></p>

Now, at the moment when the Shaykh gave me these directions, there was not a single loaf in the store-room of the convent, and in the whole city I did not know any one of whom I could venture to beg a piece of silver, because these rumours had shaken the faith of all our friends; nor had I courage to ask the Shaykh how I should procure the things which he required. It was near sunset. I left him and stood in the street of the carpet-beaters, utterly at a loss what to do, until the sun had almost set and the merchants were closing their shops and going home. When the hour of evening prayer arrived and it was now dark, a young man running to his house&#151;for he was late&#151;saw me as I stood there, and cried, "O &#7716;asan! what are you doing?" I told him that the Shaykh had given me certain orders, that I had no money, and that I would stay there till morning, if necessary, since I durst not return. Throwing back his sleeve, he bade me put my hand in. I did so and drew forth a handful of gold, with which I returned in high spirits to the convent. On making my purchases, I found that the sum was exactly right&#151;not a dirhem too much or too little. Early next morning I got the linen robes and laid the table in the congregational mosque, as the Shaykh had directed. He came thither with all his disciples, while many spectators occupied the galleries above. Now, when Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; &#7778;&aacute;&#145;id and Ust&aacute;d Ab&uacute; Bakr Karr&aacute;m&iacute; were informed that the Shaykh had prepared a feast for the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s in the mosque, Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; &#7778;&aacute;&#145;id exclaimed, "Let them make merry to-day and eat roast lamb's head, for to-morrow their own heads will be devoured by crows"; and Ab&uacute; Bakr said, "Let them grease their bellies to-day, for to-morrow they will grease the scaffold." These threats were conveyed to the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s and made a painful impression. As soon as they finished the meal and washed their hands, the Shaykh said to me, "&#7716;asan! take the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s' prayer-rugs to the chancel (maq&#7779;&uacute;ra) after Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; &#7778;&aacute;&#145;id (who was the official preacher), for to-day we will perform our prayers under his leadership." Accordingly, I carried twenty prayer-rugs into the chancel and laid them in two rows; there was no room for any more. Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; &#7778;&aacute;&#145;id mounted the pulpit and delivered a hostile address; then he came down and performed the service of prayer.</small></p>  
<p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> <small>As soon as he pronounced the final salutation (<i>sal&aacute;m</i>), the Shaykh rose and departed, without waiting for the customary devotions (<i>sunna</i>). Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; &#7778;&aacute;&#145;id faced towards him, whereupon the Shaykh looked at him askance. The Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; at once bowed his head. When the Shaykh and his disciples returned to the convent, he said, "&#7716;asan! go to the Kirm&aacute;n&iacute; market-place. There is a confectioner there who has fine cakes made of white sesame and pistachio kernels. Buy ten maunds&#146; worth. A little further on you will find a man who sells raisins. Buy ten maunds' worth and clean them. Tie up the cakes and raisins in two white cloths (<i>du iz&aacute;r-i f&uacute;&#7789;a-i k&aacute;f&uacute;r&iacute;</i>) and put them on your head and take them to Ust&aacute;d Ab&uacute; Bakr Is&#7717;&aacute;q and tell him that he must break his fast with them to-night." I followed the Shaykh's instructions in every particular. When I gave his message to Ab&uacute; Bakr Is&#7717;&aacute;q, the colour went out of his face and he sat in amazement, biting his fingers. After a few minutes he bade me be seated and having summoned Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Q&aacute;simak, his chamberlain, despatched him to Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; &#7778;&aacute;&#145;id. "Tell him," said he, "that I withdraw from our arrangement, which was that to-morrow we should bring this Shaykh and the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s to trial and severely punish them. If he asks why, let him know that last night I resolved to fast. To-day, while riding on my ass to the congregational mosque, I passed through the Kirm&aacute;n&iacute; marketplace and saw some fine cakes in a confectioner's shop. It occurred to me that on returning from prayers I would send to purchase them and break my fast with them to-night. Further on, I saw some raisins which I thought would be very nice with the cakes, and I resolved to buy some. When I came home, I had forgotten all about the matter and I had not spoken of it to any one. Now Shaykh Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d sends me the same cakes and raisins which I noticed this morning and desired to buy, and bids me break my fast with them! I have no course but to abandon proceedings against a man who is so perfectly acquainted with 'the thoughts of his fellow-creatures." The chamberlain went to Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; &#7778;&aacute;&#145;id and returned with the following message: "I was on the point of sending to you in reference to this affair. To-day the Shaykh was present when I conducted public worship. No sooner had I pronounced the salutation than he went off without performing the <i>sunnat</i>. I turned towards him, intending to ask how his neglect of devotions on a Friday was characteristic of ascetics and &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s</small></p>  
<p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></A></p>  
<p><small>and to make this the foundation of a bitter attack upon him. He looked askance at me. I almost fainted with fear. He seemed to be a hawk and I a sparrow which he was about to destroy. I struggled to speak but could not utter a word. To-day he has shown to me his power and majesty. I have no quarrel with him. If the Sultan has issued an edict against him you were responsible. You were the principal and I was only a subordinate." When the chamberlain had delivered this message, Ab&uacute; Bakr Is&#7717;&aacute;q turned to me and said: "Go and tell your Shaykh that Ab&uacute; Bakr Is&#7717;&aacute;q Karr&aacute;m&iacute; with 20,000 followers, and Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; &#7778;&aacute;&#145;id with 30,000, and the Sultan with 100,000 men and 750 war elephants, made ready for battle and tried to subdue him, and that he has defeated all their armies with ten maunds of cake and raisins and has routed right wing, left wing, and centre. He is free to hold his religion, as we are free to hold ours. <i>Ye have your religion and I have my religion</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."</p>  
<p>I came back to the Shaykh (said &#7716;asan-i Mu&#146;addib) and told him all that had passed. He turned to his disciples and said, "Since yesterday ye have been trembling for fear that the scaffold would be soaked with your blood. Nay, that is the lot of such as &#7716;usayn-i Man&#7779;&uacute;r &#7716;all&aacute;j, the most eminent mystic of his time in East and West. Scaffolds drip with the blood of heroes, not of cowards." Then he bade the <i>qaww&aacute;l</i> sing these lines:</p>  
<p><DIR>With shield and quiver meet thine enemy!<br> Vaunt not thyself but make thy vaunt of Me.<br> Let Fate be cool as water, hot as fire,<br> Do thou live happy, whichsoe&#146;er it be!</DIR></p>  
<p>The <i>qaww&aacute;l</i> sang and all the disciples began to shout and fling their gaberdines away.</p>  
<p>After that day no one in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r ventured to speak a word in disparagement of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</small></p>  
<p>The story may not be entirely fictitious. It shows, at any rate, that Moslems ascribe a miraculous character to telepathic powers, nor does it exaggerate the awe inspired by a holy man who displays them effectively. Most of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's recorded miracles are of this kind. That Mohammedan saints have often been thought-readers seems to me beyond question,</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></A></p>  
<p>whatever doubts one may feel as to a great part of the evidence preserved in their legends. Whether Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was actually threatened with legal prosecution or not, we can well believe that the orthodox parties were scandalised by his luxurious manner of living and by the unlicensed practices in which he and his disciples indulged. He made no attempt to rebut the charges brought against him, and from numerous anecdotes related by those who held him in veneration it is clear that if the document said to have been sent to Ghazna be genuine, his accusers set down nothing but what was notoriously true. They gained sympathy, if not active support, from many &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s who perceived the danger of antinomianism and desired above all things to secure the position of &#7778;&uacute;fisim within Islam. Of this party the chief representative in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r was Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Q&aacute;sim Qushayr&iacute;, well known as the author of <i>al-Ris&aacute;latu &#146;l-Qushayr&iacute;yya f&iacute; &#145;ilmi &#146;l-ta&#7779;awwuf</i>, which he composed in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 437 = <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1045-6 with the avowed object of demonstrating that the history and traditions of &#7778;&uacute;fisim are bound up with strict observance of the Mohammedan religious law.</p>  
<p>The biographer gives an interesting but probably untruthful account of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's public and private relations with Qushayr&iacute;, who is depicted as having been induced by personal experience of his miraculous intuition to repent of the hostile feelings with which he regarded the new-comer. During the first year of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's stay in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r, his prayer-meetings were attended by seventy disciples of Qushayr&iacute;, and finally he himself agreed to accompany them. While Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was preaching, Qushayr&iacute; reflected: "This man is inferior to me in learning and we are equal in devotion: whence did he get this power of reading men's thoughts?" Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d at once paused in his discourse and fixing his eye on Qushayr&iacute; reminded him of a certain ritual irregularity of which he had been guilty in private on the preceding day. Qushayr&iacute; was dumbfounded. Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, as soon as he left the pulpit, approached him and they embraced each other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Their harmony, however, was not yet complete, for they</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></A></p>  
<p>differed in the great controversy, which had long been raging, whether audition (<i>sam&aacute;&#145;</i>) was permissible; in other words, "Did the religious law sanction the use of music, singing, and dancing as a means of stimulating ecstasy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?" One day Qushayr&iacute;, while passing Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's convent, looked in and saw him taking part with his disciples in an ecstatic dance. He thought to himself that, according to the Law, no one who dances like this is accepted as a witness worthy of credit. Next day he met Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d on his way to a feast. After they had exchanged salutations, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d said to him, "When have you seen me seated amongst the witnesses?" Qushayr&iacute; understood that this was the answer to his unspoken thought&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. He now dismissed from his mind all unfriendly feelings, and the two became so intimate that not a day passed without one of them visiting the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, while on Qushayr&iacute;'s invitation Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d conducted a service once a week in the former's convent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>These anecdotes and others of the same tendency may be viewed, not as records of what happened, but rather as illustrations of the fact that in balancing the rival claims of religious law and mystical truth Qushayr&iacute; and Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d were inclined by temperament to take opposite sides. In every case, needless to say, the legalist is worsted by the theosophist, whose inner light is his supreme and infallible authority. The following stories, in which Qushayr&iacute; plays his usual r&ocirc;le, would not have been worth translating unless they had incidentally sketched for us the ways and manners of the dervishes whom Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d ruled over.</p>  
<p><small>One day Shaykh Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d with Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Q&aacute;sim Qushayr&iacute; and a large number of &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; disciples were going through the marketplace of N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r. A certain dervish let his eye fall on some boiled turnips set out for sale at the door of a shop and felt a craving for them. The Shaykh knew it by clairvoyance (<i>fir&aacute;sa</i>). He pulled in</small></p>

<p><small>the reins of his horse and said to &#7716;asan, "Go to that man's shop and buy all the turnips and beetroot that he has and bring them along." Meanwhile he and Qushayr&iacute; and the disciples entered a neighbouring mosque. When &#7716;asan returned with the turnips and beetroot, the dinner-call was given and the dervishes began to eat. The Shaykh joined them, but Qushayr&iacute; refrained and secretly disapproved, because the mosque was in the middle of the marketplace and was open in front. He said to himself, "They are eating in the street!" The Shaykh, as was his custom, took no notice. Two or three days afterwards he and Qushayr&iacute; with their disciples were present at a splendid feast. The table was covered with viands of all sorts. Qushayr&iacute; wished very much to partake of a certain dish, but he could not reach it and was ashamed to ask for it. He felt extremely annoyed. The Shaykh turned to him and said, "Doctor, when food is offered, you refuse it, and when you want it, it is not offered." Qushayr&iacute; silently begged God to forgive him for what he had done&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>One day Qushayr&iacute; unfrocked a dervish and severely censured him and ordered him to leave the city. The reason was that the dervish admired Ism&aacute;&#145;&iacute;lak-i Daqq&aacute;q, one of Qushayr&iacute;'s disciples, and had requested a certain friend to make a feast and invite the singers (<i>qaww&aacute;l&aacute;n</i>) and bring Ism&aacute;&#145;&iacute;lak with him. "Let me enjoy his company this evening (he pleaded) and shout in ecstasy at the sight of his beauty, for I am on fire with love for him." The friend consented and gave a feast which was followed by music and singing (<i>sam&aacute;&#145;</i>). On hearing of this, Qushayr&iacute; stripped the dervish of his gaberdine and banished him from N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r. When the news came to the convent of Shaykh Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, the dervishes were indignant, but they said nothing about it to the Shaykh, knowing that he was acquainted by clairvoyance with all that passed. The Shaykh called &#7716;asan-i Mu&#146;addib and bade him make ready a fine banquet and invite the reverend Doctor (Qushayr&iacute;) and all the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s in the town. "You must get plenty of roast lamb," he said, "and sweetmeats, and light a great many candles." At nightfall, when the company assembled, the Shaykh and the Doctor took their seats together on a couch, and the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s sat in front of it in three rows, a hundred men in each row. Khw&aacute;ja Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir, the Shaykh's eldest son, who was exceedingly handsome, presided</small></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></A></p>  
<p><small>over the table. As soon as the time came for dessert, &#7716;asan placed a large bowl of <i>lawz&iacute;na</i> before the Shaykh and the Doctor. After they had helped themselves, the Shaykh said to Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir, "Take this bowl and go to yonder dervish, B&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; Tursh&iacute;z&iacute;, and put half of this <i>lawz&iacute;na</i> in his mouth and eat the other half yourself." Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir went to the dervish, and kneeling respectfully before him, took a portion of the sweetmeat, and after swallowing a mouthful put the other half in the dervish's mouth. The dervish raised a loud cry and rent his garment and ran forth from the convent, shouting "Labbayk!" The Shaykh said, "Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir! I charge you to wait upon that dervish. Take his staff and ewer and follow him and be assiduous in serving him until he reaches the Ka&#145;ba." When the dervish saw Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir coming after him, he stopped and asked him where he was going. Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir said, "My father has sent me to wait upon you," and told him the whole story. B&uacute; &#145;Al&iacute; returned to the Shaykh and exclaimed, "For God's sake, bid Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir leave me!" The Shaykh did so, whereupon the dervish bowed and departed. Turning to Qushayr&iacute;, the Shaykh said, "What need is there to censure and unfrock and disgrace a dervish whom half a mouthful of <i>lawz&iacute;na</i> can drive from the city and cast away into the &#7716;ij&aacute;z? For four years he has been devoted to my Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir, and except on your account I should never have divulged his secret." Qushayr&iacute; rose and prayed God to forgive him and said, "I have done wrong. Every day I must learn from you a new lesson in &#7778;&uacute;fisim." All the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s rejoiced and there were manifestations of ecstasy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</small></p>  
<p>Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's invariable success in conciliating his opponents is perhaps the greatest miracle that his biographers record, but their belief in it will hardly be shared by us. His mode of life in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r, as depicted by his own friends and followers, must have shocked &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s of the old school who had been taught to model themselves upon the saintly heroes of Moslem asceticism. What were they to think of a man whose visitors found him lolling on cushions, like a lord, and having his feet massaged by one of his dervishes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?

<p>or by exhortations to regard the inward nature and disposition rather than the outward act&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>? From the following anecdote it appears that such arguments did not always suffice.</p>  
<p><small>When Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was at N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r, a merchant brought him a present of a large bundle of aloes-wood and a thousand N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r&iacute; d&iacute;n&aacute;rs. The Shaykh called &#7716;asan-i Mu&#146;addib and bade him prepare a feast; and in accordance with his custom he handed over the thousand d&iacute;n&aacute;rs to him for that purpose. Then he ordered that an oven should be placed in the hall and that the whole bundle of aloes-wood should be put in it and burned, saying, "I do this that my neighbours may enjoy its perfume with me." He also ordered a great number of candles to be lighted, though it was still day. Now, there was at that time in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r a very powerful inspector of police, who held rationalistic views&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and detested the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s. This man came into the monastery and said to the Shaykh, "What are you doing? What an unheard-of extravagance, to light candles in the daytime and burn a whole bundle of aloes-wood at once! It is against the law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>." The Shaykh replied, "I did not know that it is against the law. Go and blow out these candles." The inspector went and puffed at them, but the flame flared over his face and hair and dress, and most of his body was scorched. "Did not you know," said the Shaykh, "that</p>  
<p><DIR>Whoever tries to blow a candle out<br> That God hath lighted, his moustache gets burnt?"</DIR></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The inspector fell at the Shaykh's feet and became a convert&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.</small></p>  
<p>While the relations which Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d established with the jurists and theologians of N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r cannot have been friendly, it is likely enough that he convinced his adversaries of the wisdom or necessity of leaving him alone. In order to understand</p>

<p>their attitude, we must remember the divinity that hedges the Oriental saint not merely in the eyes of mystics but amongst all classes of society. He wields an illimitable and mysterious power derived from Allah, whose chosen instrument he is. As his favour confers blessing, so his displeasure is fraught with calamity. Countless tales are told of vengeance inflicted on those who have annoyed or insulted him, or shown any want of respect in his presence. Even if his enemies are willing to run the risk, they must still reckon with the widely spread feeling that it is impious to criticise the actions of holy men, which are inspired and guided by Allah Himself.</p>  
<p>Naturally, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d required large sums of money for maintaining the convent with, perhaps, two or three hundred disciples, on such a liberal scale of living as he kept up. A certain amount was contributed by novices who, on their conversion, put into the common stock all the worldly goods they possessed, but the chief part of the revenues came in the shape of gifts from lay brethren or wealthy patrons or persons who desired the Shaykh to exert his spiritual influence on their behalf. No doubt, much food and money was offered and accepted; much also was collected by &#7716;asan-i Mu&#146;addib, who seems to have been an expert in this business. When voluntary contributions failed, the Shaykh's credit with the tradesmen of N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r enabled him to supply the needs of his flock. Here are some anecdotes which describe how he triumphed over financial difficulties.</p>  
<p>The &#145;Am&iacute;d of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n relates as follows:</p>  
<p><small>The cause of my devotion to Shaykh Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d and his disciples was this. When I first came to N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r, my name was &#7716;&aacute;jib Mu&#7717;ammad and I had no servant to attend upon me. Every morning I used to pass the gate of the Shaykh's convent and look in, and whenever I saw the Shaykh, that day brought me a blessing, so that I soon began to regard the sight of him as a happy omen. One night I thought that on the morrow I would go and pay my respects to him and take him a present. I took a thousand silver dirhems of the money which had been recently coined&#151;thirty dirhems to the d&iacute;n&aacute;r&#151;and wrapped them in a piece of paper,</small></p>  
<p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></A></p>  
<p><small>intending to visit the Shaykh next day and lay them before him. I was alone in the house at the time when I formed this plan, nor did I speak of it to any one. Afterwards it occurred to me that a thousand dirhems are a great sum, and five hundred will be ample; so I divided the money into two equal parts, which I placed in two packets. Next morning, after prayers, I went to visit the Shaykh, taking one packet with me and leaving the other behind my pillow. As soon as we had exchanged greetings, I gave the five hundred dirhems to &#7716;asan-i Mu&#146;addib, who with the utmost courtesy approached the Shaykh and whispered in his ear" &#7716;&aacute;jib Mu&#7717;ammad has brought some pieces of money (<i>shikasta-&iacute;</i>)." The Shaykh said, "God bless him! but he has not brought the full amount: he has left half of it behind his pillow. &#7716;asan owes a thousand dirhems. Let him give &#7716;asan the whole sum in order that &#7716;asan may satisfy his creditors and be freed from anxiety." On hearing these words, I was dumbfounded and immediately sent a servant to bring the remainder of the money for &#7716;asan. Then I said to the Shaykh, "Accept me." He took my hand and said, "It is finished. Go in peace&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."</small></p>  
<p>During Shaykh Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's stay in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r &#7716;asan-i Mu&#146;addib, his steward, had contracted many debts in order to provide the dervishes with food. For a long time he received no gift of money and his creditors were dunning him. One day they came in a body to the convent gate. The Shaykh told &#7716;asan to let them in. On being admitted, they bowed respectfully to the Shaykh and sat down. Meanwhile a boy passed the gate, crying "Sweet cakes (<i>n&aacute;&#7789;if</i>)!" "Go and fetch him," said the Shaykh. When he was brought in, the Shaykh bade &#7716;asan seize the cakes and serve them out to the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s. The boy demanded his money, but the Shaykh only said, "It will come." After waiting an hour, the boy said again, "I want my money" and got the same reply. At the end of another hour, having been put off for the third time, he sobbed, "My master will beat me," and burst into tears. Just then some one entered the convent and placed a purse of gold before the Shaykh, saying, "So-and-so has sent it and begs that you will pray for him." The Shaykh ordered &#7716;asan to pay the creditors and the cake-boy. It was exactly the sum required, neither more nor less. The Shaykh said, "It came in consequence of the tears of this lad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>."</p>

<p><small>There was in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r a rich broker, B&uacute; &#145;Amr by name, who was such an enthusiastic admirer (<i>mu&#7717;ibb&iacute;</i>) of Shaykh Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d that he entreated &#7716;asan-i Mu&#146;addib to apply to him for anything that the Shaykh might want, and not to be afraid of asking too much. One day (said &#7716;asan) the Shaykh had already sent me to him seven times with divers requisitions which he satisfied in full. At sunset the Shaykh told me to go to him once more and procure some rosewater, aloes-wood, and camphor. I felt ashamed to return to him; however, I went. He was closing his shop. When he saw me, he cried, "&#7716;asan! what is it? You come late." I expressed to him the shame which I felt for having called upon him so frequently in one day and I made him acquainted with the Shaykh's instructions. He opened the shop-door and gave me all that I needed; then he said, "Since you are ashamed to apply to me for these trifles, to-morrow I will give you a thousand d&iacute;n&aacute;rs on the security of the caravanseray and the bath-house, in order that you may use that sum for ordinary expenses and come to me for matters of greater importance." I rejoiced, thinking that now I was quit of this ignoble begging. When I brought the rose-water, aloes-wood, and camphor to the Shaykh, he regarded me with disapproval and said, "&#7716;asan! go and purge thy heart of all desire for worldly vanities, that I may let thee associate with the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s." I went to the convent gate and stood with bare head and feet and repented and asked God to forgive me and wept bitterly and rubbed my face on the ground; but the Shaykh did not speak to me that night. Next day when he preached in the hall, he paid no attention to B&uacute; &#145;Amr, although he was accustomed to look at him every day in the course of his sermon. As soon as he had finished, B&uacute; &#145;Amr came to me and said, "&#7716;asan! what ails the Shaykh? He has not looked at me to-day." I said that I did not know, and then I told him what had passed between the Shaykh and me. B&uacute; &#145;Amr went up to the Shaykh's chair and kissed it, saying, "O prince of the age, my life depends on thy look. To-day thou hast not looked at me. Tell me what I have done, that I may ask God's forgiveness and beseech thee to pardon my offence." The Shaykh said, "Will you fetch me down from the highest heaven to earth and demand a pledge from me in return for a thousand d&iacute;n&aacute;rs? If you wish me to be pleased with you, give me the money now, and you will see how little it weighs in the scales of my lofty spirit!" B&uacute; &#145;Amr</small></p>

<p><small>immediately went home and brought back two purses, each containing five hundred N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r&iacute; d&iacute;n&aacute;rs. The Shaykh handed them to me and said, "Buy oxen and sheep. Make a hotchpotch (<i>har&iacute;sa</i>) of the beef and a <i>z&iacute;ra-b&aacute;</i> of the mutton, seasoned with saffron and otto of roses. Get plenty of <i>lawz&iacute;na</i> and rose-water and aloes-wood, and light a thousand candles in the daytime. Lay the tables at P&uacute;shang&aacute;n (a beautiful village, which is a pleasure resort of the people of N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r), and proclaim in the city that all are welcome who wish to eat food that entails neither obligation in this world nor calling to account in the next." More than two thousand men assembled at P&uacute;shang&aacute;n. The Shaykh came with his disciples and entertained high and low and with his own blessed hand sprinkled rose-water over his guests while they partook of the viands.</small></p>  
<p>Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's methods of raising money are further illustrated by the story in which it is recorded that, while preaching in public, he held up a sash and declared that he must have three hundred d&iacute;n&aacute;rs in exchange for it, which sum was at once offered by an old woman in the congregation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. On another occasion, being in debt to the amount of five hundred d&iacute;n&aacute;rs, he sent a message to a certain Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l Fur&aacute;t&iacute; that he was about to visit him. Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l entertained him sumptuously for three days, and on the fourth day presented him with five hundred d&iacute;n&aacute;rs, adding a hundred for travelling expenses and a hundred more as a gift. The Shaykh said, "I pray that God may take from thee the riches of this world." "Nay," cried Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l, "for had I lacked riches, the blessed feet of the Shaykh would never have come here, and I should never have waited upon him and gained from him spiritual power and peace." Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d then said, "O God! do not let him be a prey to worldliness: make it a means of his spiritual advancement, not a plague!" In consequence of this prayer Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Fa&#7693;l and his family prospered greatly and reached high positions in church and state&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Apparently, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d did not scruple to employ threats when the prospective donor disappointed him. And his threats were not to be despised! For example, there was the Am&iacute;r Mas&#145;&uacute;d who, after once paying the Shaykh's debts, obstinately</p>

<p>refused to comply with a second demand; whereupon Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d caused the following verse to be put into his hands by &#7716;asan-i Mu&#146;addib:</p>  
<p><DIR>Perform what thou hast promised, else thy might<br> And valour will not save thy life from me!</DIR></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The Am&iacute;r flew into a rage and drove &#7716;asan from his presence. On being told of this Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d uttered no word. That same night Mas&#145;&uacute;d, as is the custom of Oriental princes, slipped out from his tent in disguise to make a round of the camp and hear what the soldiers were saying. The royal tent was guarded by a number of huge Gh&uacute;r&iacute; dogs, kept in chains by day but allowed to roam at night, of such ferocity that they would tear to pieces any stranger who approached. They did not recognise their master, and before any one could answer his cries for help he was a mangled corpse&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Stories of this type, showing the saint as a minister of divine wrath and vengeance, must have influenced many superstitious minds. The average Moslem's fatalism and belief in clairvoyance lead him to justify acts which to us seem desperately immoral. Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d is said to have corresponded with his famous contemporary, Ibn S&iacute;n&aacute; (Avicenna)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. I cannot regard as historical the account of their meeting in the monastery at N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r, or the report that after they had conversed with each other for three days and nights the philosopher said to his pupils, "All that I know he sees," while the mystic declared, "All that I see he knows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>." Even less probable is the statement that Avicenna's mystical writings were the result of a miracle wrought by Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, which first opened his eyes to the reality of saintship and &#7778;&uacute;fisim&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Among the eminent Persian mystics of this epoch none was so nearly akin to Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d in temperament and character as Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan of Kharaq&aacute;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.

<p>finally settling at Mayhana, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d paid him a visit, which is described with great particularity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. A complete version would be tedious, but I have translated the most interesting passages in full. When Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir, the eldest son of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, announced his intention of making the pilgrimage to Mecca, his father with a numerous following of &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s and disciples resolved to accompany him. As soon as the party left N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r behind them, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d exclaimed, "Were it not for my coming, the holy man could not support this sorrow." His companions wondered whom he meant. Now, A&#7717;mad the son of Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan Kharaq&aacute;n&iacute; had just been arrested and put to death on his wedding-eve. Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan did not know until next morning, when, hearing the call to prayer, he came forth from his cell and trod upon the head of his son, which the executioners had flung away. On arriving at Kharaq&aacute;n, Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d went into the convent and entered the private chapel where Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan usually sat. Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan rose and walked halfway down the chapel to meet him, and they embraced each other. Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan took Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's hand and led him to his own chair, but he declined to occupy it; and since Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan was equally averse to take the place of honour, both seated themselves in the middle of the chapel. While they sat there weeping, Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan begged Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d to give him a word of counsel, but Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d said, "It is for thee to speak." Then he bade the Koran-readers who were with him read the Koran aloud, and during their chant the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s wept and wailed. Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan threw his gaberdine (<i>khirqa</i>) to the readers. After that, the bier was brought out, and they prayed over the dead youth and buried him with manifestations of ecstasy. When the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s had retired to their cells, a dispute arose between them and the readers for the possession of Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan's <i>khirqa</i>, which the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s claimed in order that they might tear it to pieces. Ab&uacute; l-&#7716;asan sent a message by his servant to say that the readers should keep the <i>khirqa</i>, and he gave the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s another <i>khirqa</i>, to be torn to pieces and distributed among them. A separate chamber was prepared for Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, who lodged with Ab&uacute;</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> &#146;l-&#7716;asan three days and nights. In spite of his host's entreaties he refused to speak, saying, "I have been brought hither to listen." Then Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan said, "I implored God that He would send to me one of His friends, with whom I might speak of these mysteries, for I am old and feeble and could not come to thee. He will not let thee go to Mecca. Thou art too holy to be conducted to Mecca. He will bring the Ka&#145;ba to thee, that it may circumambulate thee." Every morning Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan came to the door of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's room and asked&#151;addressing the mother of Khw&aacute;ja Mu&#7827;affar, whom Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d had brought with him on this journey&#151;"How art thou, O <i>faq&iacute;ra</i>? Be sage and vigilant, for thou consortest with God. Here nothing of human nature remains, nothing of the flesh (<i>nafs</i>) remains. Here all is God, all is God." And in the daytime when Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d was alone, Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan used to come to the door and draw back the curtain and beg leave to come in and beseech Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d not to rise from his couch; and he would kneel beside him and put his head close to him, and they would converse in low tones and weep together; and Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan would slip his hand underneath Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's garment and lay it upon his breast and cry, "I am laying my hand upon the Everlasting Light.&#133;" Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan said, "O Shaykh, every night I see the Ka&#145;ba circumambulating thy head: what need for thee to go to the Ka&#145;ba? Turn back, for thou wast brought hither for my sake. Now thou hast performed the pilgrimage." Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d said, "I will go and visit Bis&#7789;&aacute;m and return here." "Thou wishest to perform the <i>&#145;umra</i>," said Ab&uacute; &#146;l-&#7716;asan, "after having performed the <i>&#7717;ajj</i>." Then Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d set out for Bis&#7789;&aacute;m, where he visited the shrine of B&aacute;yaz&iacute;d-i Bis&#7789;&aacute;m&iacute;. From Bis&#7789;&aacute;m the pilgrims journeyed westward to D&aacute;mgh&aacute;n, and thence to Rayy. Here Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d made a halt and declared that he would go no farther in the direction of Mecca. Bidding farewell to those who still persisted in their intention of performing the pilgrimage, the rest of the party, including Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d and his son Ab&uacute; &#7788;&aacute;hir, turned their faces towards Kharaq&aacute;n and N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r.</p>  
<p>The last years of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's life were spent in retirement</p>  
<p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></A></p>  
<p>at Mayhana. We are told that his final departure from N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r was deeply regretted by the inhabitants, and that the chief men of the city urged him in vain to alter his decision&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. With advancing years he may have felt that the duties which devolved upon him as a director of souls (not to speak of bodies) were too heavy a burden: in his old age he could not rise without being helped by two disciples who took hold of his arms and lifted him from his seat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. He left no money in the convent, saying that God would send whatever was necessary for its upkeep. According to the biographer, this prediction was fulfilled, and although the convent never possessed a sure source of income (<i>ma&#145;l&uacute;m</i>), it attracted a, larger number of dervishes and received more spiritual and material blessings than any other religious house in N&iacute;sh&aacute;p&uacute;r, until it was destroyed by the invading Ghuzz&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d lived 1000 months (83 years + 4 months). He died at Mayhana on the 4th of Sha&#145;b&aacute;n, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 440 = 12th of January, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1049, and was buried in the mosque opposite his house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. His tomb bore the following lines in Arabic, which he himself had chosen for an epitaph:</p>  
<p><DIR>I beg, nay, charge thee: Write on my gravestone,<br> "This was love's bondsman," that when I am gone,<br> Some wretch well-versed in passion's ways may sigh<br> And give me greeting, as he passes by&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.</DIR></p>  
<p>Apart from several allusions to his corpulence, the only description of Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's personal appearance that his biographers have preserved is the following, which depicts him as he was seen by an old man whom he saved from dying of thirst in the desert:</p>  
<p><small>tall, stout, with a white skin and wide eyes and a long beard falling to the navel; clad in a patched frock (<i>muraqqa&#145;</i>); in, his hands a staff and a ewer; a prayer-rug thrown over his shoulder, also a razor and toothpick; a &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; cap on his head, and on his feet shoes of cotton soled with linen-rags (<i>jumjum</i>); light was shining from his face&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</small></p>

<p>This sketch of his life has shown us the saint and the abbot in one. Before coming into closer touch with the former character, I should like to refer to a few passages of specially monastic interest.</p>  
<p>The first gives ten rules which Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d caused to be put in writing, in order that they might be observed punctiliously by the inmates of his convent. In the original, after every rule there follow some words of the Koran on which it is based.</p>  
<p>I. Let them keep their garments clean and themselves always pure.</p>  
<p>II. Let them not sit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the mosque or in any holy place for the sake of gossiping.</p>  
<p>III. In the first instance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> let them perform their prayers in common.</p>  
<p>IV. Let them pray much at night.</p>  
<p>V. At dawn let them ask forgiveness of God and call unto Him.</p>  
<p>VI. In the morning let them read as much of the Koran as they can, and let them not talk until the sun has risen.</p>  
<p>VII. Between evening prayers and bedtime prayers let them occupy themselves with repeating some litany (<i>wird&iacute; &uacute; dhikr&iacute;</i>).</p>  
<p>VIII. Let them welcome the poor and needy and all who join their company, and let them bear patiently the trouble of (waiting upon) them.</p>  
<p>IX. Let them not eat anything save in participation with one another.</p>  
<p>X. Let them not absent themselves without receiving permission from one another.</p>  
<p>Furthermore, let them spend their hours of leisure in one of three things: either in the study of theology or in some devotional exercise (<i>wird&iacute;</i>) or in bringing comfort to some one. Whosoever loves this community and helps them as much as he can is a sharer in their merit and future recompense&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

<p><small>P&iacute;r Ab&uacute; &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; Dand&aacute;n&iacute;, a disciple of Shaykh Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d, used continually to stand beside him with a pair of nail-scissors in his hand. Whenever the Shaykh looked at his woollen gaberdine and saw the nap (<i>purz</i>) on it, he would pull the nap with his fingers, and then Ab&uacute; &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; would at once remove it with the nail-scissors, for the Shaykh was so absorbed in contemplation of God that he did not wish to be disturbed by perceiving the state of his clothes. Ab&uacute; &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; was the Shaykh's barber and used regularly to trim his moustache. A certain dervish desired to be taught the proper way of doing this. Ab&uacute; &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; smiled and said, "It is no such easy matter. A man needs seventy masters of the craft to instruct him how the moustache of a dervish ought to be trimmed." This Ab&uacute; &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; related that the Shaykh, towards the end of his life, had only one tooth left. "Every night, after supper, I used to give him a toothpick, with which he cleansed his mouth; and when he washed his hands, he would pour water on the toothpick and lay it down. One evening I thought to myself, 'He has no teeth and does not require a toothpick: why should he take it from me every night?' The Shaykh raised his head and looked at me and said, 'Because I wish to observe the Sunna and because I hope to win divine mercy. The Prophet has said, May God have mercy upon those of my people who use the toothpick in their ablutions and at their meals!' I was overcome with shame and began to weep&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."</small></p>  
<p>P&iacute;r &#7716;ubb&iacute; was the Shaykh's tailor. One day he came in with a garment belonging to the Shaykh which he had mended. At that moment the Shaykh was taking his noonday siesta and reclining on a couch, while Khw&aacute;ja &#145;Abdu &#146;l-Kar&iacute;m, his valet, sat beside his pillow and fanned him. Khw&aacute;ja &#145;Abdu &#146;l-Kar&iacute;m exclaimed, "What are you doing here?" P&iacute;r &#7716;ubb&iacute; retorted, "Wherever there is room for you, there is room for me." The valet laid down the fan and struck him again and again. After seven blows the Shaykh said, "That is enough." P&iacute;r &#7716;ubb&iacute; went off and complained to Khw&aacute;ja Najj&aacute;r, who said to the Shaykh, when he came out for afternoon prayers, "The young men lift their hands against the elders: what says the Shaykh?" The Shaykh replied, "Khw&aacute;ja &#145;Abdu &#146;l-Kar&iacute;m's hand is my hand," and nothing more was said about it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

The following is a translation of the text as it stands in Zhukovski's edition: "Whenever I have addressed poetry to any one, that which falls from my lips is the composition of venerable &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s (<i>&#145;az&iacute;z&aacute;n</i>), and most of it is by Shaykh Ab&uacute; &#146;l-Q&aacute;sim Bishr."

<IMG SRC="img/00400.jpg">) we ought not to read <A NAME="img_00401"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/00401.jpg">. The statement will then run: "I have never composed poetry. That which falls from my lips, etc." In another passage (A 263, 10) it is stated on the authority of the writer's grandfather (Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d's grandson) that of all the poetry attributed to Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d only one verse and one <i>rub&aacute;&#145;&iacute;</i>, which are cited, were his own composition, the remainder being quoted from his spiritual directors. The credibility of this is not affected by the explanation that he was too absorbed in ecstasy to think about versifying. In addition to the single <i>rub&aacute;&#145;&iacute;</i>, of which Ab&uacute; Sa&#145;&iacute;d is expressly named as the author, H and A contain twenty-six which he is said to have quoted on different occasions.
