<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">One</span> of the deepest differences between Arabs and Persians shows itself in the extent and character of the mystical poetry of each people. As regards Persia, the names of San&aacute;&#146;&iacute;, &#145;A&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;r, Jal&aacute;lu&#146;dd&iacute;n R&uacute;m&iacute;, Sa&#145;d&iacute;, Hafiz, and J&aacute;m&iacute; are witnesses enough. Whether quantity or quality be considered, the best part of medieval Persian poetry is either genuinely mystical in spirit or is so saturated with mystical ideas that it will never be more than half understood by those who read it literally. When we turn to Arabic poetry of the period subsequent to the rise and development of &#7778;&uacute;fisim, what do we find? No lack of poets, certainly, though few of them reach the first rank and their output is scanty compared with the opulent genius of their Persian contemporaries. But from Mutanabb&iacute; and Ma&#145;arr&iacute; down to the bards unknown in Europe who flourished long after the Baghd&aacute;d Caliphate had fallen, it is</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></A></p>  
<p>remarkable how seldom they possess the note (as Newman would say) of mysticism. The main reason, I think, lies in racial endowment. The Arab has no such passion for an ultimate principle of unity as has always distinguished the Persians and Indians&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. He shares with other Semitic peoples an incapacity for harmonising and unifying the particular facts of experience: he discerns the trees very clearly, but not the wood. Like his art, in which "we everywhere find a delicate sense for detail, but nowhere large apprehension of a great and united whole&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>," his poetry, intensely subjective in feeling and therefore lyrical in form, presents only a series of brilliant impressions, full of life and colour, yet essentially fragments and moments of life, not fused into the substance of universal thought by an imagination soaring above place and time. While nature keeps Arabian poetry within definite bounds, convention deprives the Arabic-writing poet, who is not necessarily an Arab, of the verse-form that is most suitable for continuous narrative or exposition&#151;the allegorical, romantic, or didactic <i>mathnaw&iacute;</i>&#151;and leaves him no choice but to fall back upon prose if he cannot make the <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;da</i> or the <i>ghazal</i> answer his purpose. Both these types of verse are associated with love: the <i>ghazal</i> is a love-lyric, and the <i>qa&#7779;&iacute;da</i>, though its proper motive is praise, usually begins "with the mention of women and the constantly shifted habitations of the wandering tribesmen seeking pasture throughout the Winter and Spring; the poet must tell of his love and its troubles, and, if he likes, may describe the beauty of his mistress&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_524"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>." Thus the models of Arabic mystical poetry are the secular odes and songs of which this passion is the theme; and the imitation is often so close that unless we have some clue to the writer's intention, it may not be possible to know whether his beloved is human or</p>

<p>divine&#151;indeed, the question whether he himself always knows is one which students of Oriental mysticism cannot regard as impertinent.</p>  
<p align="justify'">Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute;, a great theosophist rather than a great poet, deserves to be mentioned amongst the few Arabs who have excelled in this ambiguous style&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; but its supreme master is Sharafu&#146;dd&iacute;n &#145;Umar Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;, a native of Cairo, who was born seventeen years after Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute; and died five years before him (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1182-1235)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The two seem never to have met. The description of Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute; as Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;'s teacher (<i>ust&aacute;dh</i>) rests upon a far-fetched interpretation of the verse,</p>  
<p><DIR>O camel-driver crossing the wilderness with thy howdahs,<br> Kindly halt beside the hills of &#7788;ayyi&#146;!</DIR></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Here N. detects an allusion to Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute;, who belonged to the &#7788;ayyi&#146; tribe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_529"></A><A HREF="#fn_527"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>It rarely happens that the outward lives of mystics are eventful. The poet's chief biographer&#151;his grandson, &#145;Al&iacute;&#151;has much to say about his personal beauty, his ecstatic temperament, his generosity and unselfishness, his seclusion from the world, and the veneration in which he was held by all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_528"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. As his name declares, he was the son of a notary (<i>f&aacute;ri&#7693;</i>). In his youth he practised religious austerities on Mt Muqa&#7789;&#7789;am near Cairo, returning at intervals to attend the law-courts with his father and study theology. One day he encountered a saint in the guise of an old greengrocer, who told him that the hour of his illumination was at hand, but that he must go to the &#7716;ij&aacute;z to receive it. Accordingly Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; set out for Mecca, where the promise was fulfilled. Many of his odes celebrate the hills and valleys in the neighbourhood of the</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Holy City, scenes endeared by the visions and ecstasies which they recalled to his mind. After fifteen years&#146; absence from Egypt he heard the voice of the saint, who was then on his deathbed, bidding him return to Cairo, in order to pray over him and bury him. Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; obeyed, and having performed this pious duty settled in Cairo for the rest of his life, lodging (it is said) in the mosque al-Azhar, as his father had done. The biographer &#145;Al&iacute;, whose mother was a daughter of Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;, mentions two sons of the poet, Kam&aacute;lu&#146;dd&iacute;n Mu&#7717;ammad and &#145;Abdu &#146;l-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n, who were invested with the <i>khirqa</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_529"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> by the famous &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;, Shih&aacute;bu&#146;dd&iacute;n Ab&uacute; &#7716;af&#7779; &#145;Umar al-Suhraward&iacute; on the occasion of his meeting with Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; at Mecca in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1231.</p>  
<p>The <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i>, first edited by the aforesaid &#145;Al&iacute; from a manuscript in the author's handwriting, is a thin volume comprising about twenty qa&#7779;&iacute;das and <i>qi&#7789;&#145;as</i> together with some quatrains (<i>rub&aacute;&#145;&iacute;yy&aacute;t</i>) and enigmas (<i>algh&aacute;z</i>). The longest ode, the <i>Na&#7827;mu &#146;l-sul&uacute;k</i> or "the Mystic's Progress," generally known as the <i>T&aacute;&#146;iyyatu &#146;l-kubr&aacute;</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_530"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, has been omitted from the Marseilles edition, which is otherwise complete. Owing to its expository and descriptive character this poem stands apart from the purely lyrical odes, and I have treated it as an independent work. The Wine Ode (<i>Khamriyya</i>) and several other pieces have been published with a French prose translation in the <i>Anthologie arabe</i> of Grangeret de Lagrange (Paris, 1828), and a few more will be found in De Sacy's <i>Chrestomathie arabe</i>. Italy possesses a prose rendering of the minor poems by P. Valerga (Firenze, 1874). There is nothing in English except some fragments which hardly amount to a hundred lines in all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_531"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. I hope to persuade my readers that the <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i> of Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;, though it will not please every</p>

<p>taste, is too curious and exquisite to be left on one side by those who take an interest in Oriental poetry.</p>  
<p>Concerning the subtle quality of his thought no less than of his style, it would be hard to better what a French critic wrote ninety years ago:</p>  
<p><small>L&#146;intelligence parfaite de ses productions ne peut &ecirc;tre que le fruit d&#146;une &eacute;tude longue et approfondie de la po&eacute;sie arabe. Deux causes principales les rendent d&#146;un difficile acc&egrave;s. La premi&egrave;re, c&#146;est qu&#146;il arrive souvent &agrave; ce po&euml;te de quintessencier le sentiment; et alors ses id&eacute;es sont si subtiles, si d&eacute;li&eacute;es, et, pour ainsi dire, si impalpables, qu&#146;elles &eacute;chappent presque aux poursuites du lecteur le plus attentif: souvent m&ecirc;me elles disparoissent d&egrave;s qu&#146;on les touche pour les transporter dans une autre langue. On voit qu&#146;il a pris plaisir, par un choix de pens&eacute;es extraordinaires, et par la singularit&eacute; des tours, &agrave; mettre &agrave; l&#146;&eacute;preuve la sagacit&eacute; de ceux qui &eacute;tudient ses ouvrages. Au reste, les lettr&eacute;s de l&#146;Orient pensent qu&#146;un po&euml;te est sans g&eacute;nie et sans invention, ou bien qu&#146;il compte peu sur leur intelligence, quand il n&#146;a pas soin de leur m&eacute;nager des occasions fr&eacute;quentes de faire briller cette p&eacute;n&eacute;tration qui sait d&eacute;couvrir les sens les plus cach&eacute;s. Il faut donc que le po&euml;te arabe, si&#146;l veut obtenir les suffrages et l&#146;admiration des connoisseurs, n&#146;oublie pas de porter quelquefois &agrave; l&#146;exc&egrave;s le raffinement et la subtilit&eacute; dans ses compositions, d&#146;aiguiser ses pens&eacute;es, et de les envelopper de telle sorte dans les expressions, qu&#146;elles se pr&eacute;sentent au lecteur comme des &eacute;nigmes, qu&#146;elles r&eacute;veillent son attention, piquent sa curiosit&eacute;, et mettent en jeu toutes les facult&eacute;s de son esprit. Or, il faut convenir qu&#146; Omar ben-F&acirc;redh n&#146;a point manqu&eacute; &agrave; ce devoir prescrit aux po&euml;tes arabes, et qu&#146;il n&#146;a point voulu que ses lecteurs lui reprochassent de leur avoir enlev&eacute; les occasions de montrer leur sagacit&eacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_532"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</small></p>  
<p>This describes very well a general and obvious feature of Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;'s style, a feature which is entirely absent both from pre-Islamic and early Islamic poetry, although since the time of Mutanabb&iacute;, who first brought it into prominence, it has maintained itself, not merely as a local or temporary fashion but with all the force of a fixed and almost universally accepted tradition. While Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; has nothing in common</p>

<p>with the <i>imitatorum seruum pecus</i>, he neither attempted nor desired to swim against the stream; and it is probable that only his mysticism saved him from the worst excesses of metaphysical wit. In him, as in Meleager and Petrarch, "the religion of love is reduced to a theology; no subtlety, no fluctuation of fancy or passion is left unregistered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." If his verse abounds in fantastic conceits, if much of it is enigmatic to the last degree, the conceits and enigmas are not, as a rule, rhetorical ornaments or intellectual conjuring tricks, but like tendrils springing from a hidden root are vitally connected with the moods of feeling which they delineate. It may be difficult to believe, what is related on the testimony of his most intimate friends, that he used to dictate his poems at the moment when he came out of a deep ecstatic trance, during which "he would now stand, now sit, now repose on his side, now lie on his hack, wrapped like a dead man; and thus would he pass ten consecutive days, more or less, neither eating nor drinking nor speaking nor stirring." His style and diction resemble the choicest and finest jewel-work of a fastidious artist rather than the first-fruits of divine inspiration. Yet I am not inclined to doubt the statement that his poetry was composed in an abnormal manner&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_536"></A><A HREF="#fn_534"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The history of mysticism records numerous instances of the kind. Blake said that he was drunk with intellectual vision whenever he took a pencil or graver in his hand. "St Catherine of Siena," we are told, "dictated her great Dialogue to her secretaries whilst in the state of ecstasy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_537"></A><A HREF="#fn_535"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>." "When Jal&aacute;lu&#146;dd&iacute;n R&uacute;m&iacute; was drowned in the ocean of Love he used to take hold of a pillar in his house and set himself turning round it. Meanwhile he versified and dictated, and people wrote down the verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_538"></A><A HREF="#fn_536"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>." Since the form of such automatic composition will largely depend on materials stored within the mystic's brain, and on the literary models with which he is familiar, we need not be surprised if his visions and revelations sometimes find spontaneous utterance in an elaborately artificial style.

<p>intense passion and glowing rapture of Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;'s poetry are in keeping with this account of the way in which it was produced&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_537"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. That he may have written it while not under the influence of ecstasy, I can conceive&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_540"></A><A HREF="#fn_538"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; but that he wrote it in cold blood, for the sake of those who might enjoy sharpening their wits upon it, seems to me incredible.</p>  
<p>The double character of Islamic mystical poetry makes it attractive to many who are out of touch with pure mysticism. Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; would not be so popular in the East if he were understood entirely in a spiritual sense. The fact that parts of the <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i> cannot be reasonably understood in any other sense would not, perhaps, compel us to regard the whole as spiritual, unless that view of its meaning were supported by the poet's life, the verdict of his biographers and commentators, and the agreement of Moslem critical opinion; but as things are, we can declare, with N&aacute;bulus&iacute;, that "in every erotic description, whether the subject thereof be male or female, and in all imagery of gardens, flowers, rivers, birds and the like he refers to the Divine Reality manifested in phenomena, and not to those phenomena themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_541"></A><A HREF="#fn_539"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>." This Reality, <i>i.e.</i> God (or, in some places, Mohammed conceived as the Logos) is the Beloved whom the poet addresses and celebrates under many names&#151;now as one of the heroines of Arabian Minnesong, now as a gazelle or a driver of camels or an archer shooting deadly glances from his eye; most frequently as plain He or She. The Odes retain the form, conventions, topics, and images of ordinary love-poetry: their</p>

<p>inner meaning hardly ever obtrudes itself, although its presence is everywhere suggested by a strange exaltation of feeling, fine-drawn phantasies in which (as the same French critic remarks) the poet is rapt "au-del&agrave; des bornes de la droite raison," mysterious obscurities of diction and subtle harmonies of sound. If Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; had followed the example of Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute; and written a commentary on his own poems, it might have added considerably to our knowledge of his mystical beliefs, but I am not sure that it would have had much greater interpretative value than the work of his commentators, who profess to explain the esoteric meaning of every verse in the Odes. While such analysis may be useful within certain limits, we should recognise how little it is capable of revealing. An eminent scholar came to Ibnu l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; and asked permission to write a commentary on his masterpiece, the <i>Na&#7827;mu &#146;l-Sul&uacute;k</i>. "In how many volumes?" "Two." The poet smiled. "Had I wished," said he, "I could have written two volumes of commentary on every verse of it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_542"></A><A HREF="#fn_540"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." The more interpreters, the more interpretations, as those who have given time and labour to the study of mysticism well know. Poetry of this kind suggests more than it says, and means all that it may suggest.</p>  
<p>We cannot do without the commentators, however, and they will help us a good deal if we learn to use them discreetly. When they handle their text like philologists and try to fasten precise mystical significations upon individual words and phrases, the process is as fatal to poetry as the result is likely to be far from truth. Against this, they have the immense advantage of being &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s, that is to say, of knowing through tradition and their own experience what Europeans can only acquire by study and perceive by sympathy. They are the poet's fellow-citizens in the ideal world from which he drew his inspiration; they have dreamed his dreams and travelled on his path towards his goal; they do not miss the main drift of his allegory even though they err in some of the details.</p>

<p>After reading a little of Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;'s poetry, one can take a general view of the whole. All his odes are variations on a single theme, and the variations themselves have a certain interior uniformity. Not only do the same "leitmotifs" recur again and again, but the same metaphors, conceits and paradoxes are continually reappearing in new dress. Although translators must regret this monotony, which they cannot make other than tedious, I think most of them would agree that the poet has triumphed over it by means of the delicacy of his art, the beauty of his diction, and the "link&egrave;d sweetness" of his versification&#151;powerful spells to enchant those who read him in his own language. The <i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i> is a miracle of literary accomplishment, yet the form would be cold and empty without the spirit which it enshrines. Like Sidney, Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; looked into his heart before he wrote. His verse is charged with the fire and energy of his inmost feelings.</p>  
<p><DIR>Where eyes encounter souls in battle-fray,<br> I am the murdered man whom &#146;twas no crime to slay.<br> At the first look, ere love in me arose,<br> To that all-glorious beauty I was vowed.<br> God bless a racked heart crying,<br> And lids that passion will not let me close,<br> And ribs worn thin,<br> Their crookedness wellnigh to straightness shaped<br> By the glow within,<br> And seas of tears whence I had never &#145;scaped<br> But for the fire of sighing!<br> How sweet are maladies which hide<br> Me from myself, my loyal proofs to Love!<br> Though after woeful eve came woeful dawn,<br> It could not move<br> Once to despair my spirit: I never cried</DIR></p>

<p>Here the Moslem commentator, startled for a moment out of his lucubrations on syntax and rhetoric, pauses to pay a tribute of admiration to the poet, a tribute which is the more noteworthy because in these six verses Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; comes as near as he ever does to the modern European conception of what poetry should be. Unadorned simplicity is the antithesis of his style. For our taste, he has far too much of the gift of</p>

Concerning his verbal euphuism a treatise might be written. One verse&#151;an extreme instance, no doubt&#151;will serve as a sample of many:</p>

<p>His extravagant flights of fancy are generally accompanied by an equal exaltation of feeling and sustained by the fiery element in which they move; at times, however, they sink into something very like the "sweet smoke of rhetoric," <i>e.g.</i>,</p>  
<p><DIR>I sowed roses on his cheek by looking (at him): mine eye has the right to gather that which it planted.<br> But if he refuses, then his (teeth white as) camomile will be my amends: &#146;tis no bad bargain when one is given pearls instead of flowers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>Besides the two protagonists, Arabian love-poetry introduces several minor figures, who play a helping or hindering part in the idyll. Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;, of course, uses them allegorically. One of them is the "watcher" (<i>raq&iacute;b</i>), who prevents the lover from approaching. The "slanderer" (<i>w&aacute;sh&iacute;</i>) represents the logical and intellectual faculty, which cannot pierce beyond the outward forms of things. More important than either of these (to judge by the frequent passages of description</p>

<p>Any one of the Odes will furnish examples of this Arabian eloquence which has its roots deep in the structure of the language and defies all attempts to transplant it.</p>  
<p>In his famous Wine Ode (<i>Khamriyya</i>) Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; develops a symbolism which elsewhere he only uses incidentally. His sparing use of it may perhaps be attributed to</p>

<p>his respect for the Mohammedan religious law, just as the antinomian bias of some Persian mystics seems to express itself in the freedom of their bacchanalian imagery. According to Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;'s custom, the symbolism is precise and circumstantial, so that its interpretation is far more baffling than in Persian odes of the same kind, where large and simple ideas carry the reader easily along. I hope that the literal translation given below, together with the notes accompanying it, will make the meaning tolerably clear, though we may doubt whether the poet would always have accepted the interpretation given by his commentator, &#145;Abdu &#146;l-Ghan&iacute; al-N&aacute;bulus&iacute;, who not only explains too much but brings in philosophical theories that belong to Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute; rather than to Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;. Into this question, however, I need not enter now.</p>

<p>The <i>Khamriyya</i> forms a link between the love-lyrics and the great Ode in which Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; describes his own mystical experience and puts it forth (excepting, however, the highest stage of all) as a doctrine for others. This Ode, the author's masterpiece, bears a plain and appropriate title, <i>Na&#7827;mu &#146;l-sul&uacute;k</i>, "The Poem of the Mystic's Progress"; the meaning of the name al-<i>T&aacute;&#146;iyyatu &#146;l-kubr&aacute;</i>, by which it is commonly known, has been explained above&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_606"></A><A HREF="#fn_604"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. The <i>T&aacute;&#146;iyya</i>, with its 760 verses, is nearly as long as all the minor poems together, if we leave the quatrains and enigmas out of reckoning. It was edited in 1854 by Joseph von Hammer and may be studied in the fully vocalised text which he copied from an excellent manuscript in his possession. To transcribe</p>

<p>is one thing, to translate is another; and as "translation" of a literary work usually implies that some attempt has been made to understand it, I prefer to say that Von Hammer rendered the poem into German rhymed verse by a method peculiar to himself, which appears to have consisted in picking out two or three words in each couplet and filling the void with any ideas that might strike his fancy. Perhaps, in a sense, the <i>T&aacute;&#146;iyya</i> is untranslatable, and certainly it offers very slight encouragement to the translator whose aim may be defined as "artistic reproduction." On the other hand, it seemed to me that a literal prose version with explanatory notes would at least enable the reader to follow the course of the poem and become acquainted with its meaning, while any one who ventured on the Arabic text would profit by the labours of a fellow-student and would not be so likely to lose heart,</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Though formally an ode (<i>qa&#7779;&iacute;da</i>), the <i>T&aacute;&#146;iyya</i> is addressed to a disciple, so that its prevailing tone is didactic and descriptive, the exposition being only now and then interrupted by strains of pure lyric enthusiasm. Not that the poem is deficient either in beauty or in power; much, if not most of it, combines these qualities, and in the following version I have tried to preserve some traces of them. Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; is here illustrating the doctrine that phenomena are merely the illusory medium through which the soul acts in the world. For this purpose he compares the soul to the showman of the shadow-lantern who throws his puppets on a screen, keeping himself out of sight while he manipulates them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_607"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

<p>Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; more often reminds us of Dante than of Lucretius, but these verses may be compared with a passage in the <i>De rerum natura</i> (2, 323 foll.) where the author illustrates "the perpetual motion of the atoms going on beneath an appearance of absolute rest" by a picture "taken from the pomp of human affairs and the gay pageantry of armies":</p>  
<p><DIR>Praeterea magnae legiones cum loca cursu<br> camporum complent belli simulacra cientes,<br> fulgor ibi ad caelum se tollit totaque circum<br> aere renidescit tellus supterque uirum ui<br> excitur pedibus sonitus clamoreque montes<br> icti reiectant uoces ad sidera mundi<br> et circumuolitant equites mediosque repente<br> tramittunt ualido quatientes impete campos.</DIR></p>

<p>"The truth and fulness of life in this passage are immediately perceived, but the element of sublimity is added by the thought in the two lines with which the passage concludes, which reduces the whole of this moving and sounding pageant to stillness and silence&#151;</p>

<p>A similar and perhaps even more striking effect is produced when Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;, after having brought before his readers the spectacle of restless life and strife which fills the world, at once transforms it into a vision of eternal order and harmony&#151;</p>

<p>In reading the <i>T&aacute;&#146;iyya</i> it is a rare pleasure to meet with. even ten or twenty consecutive lines like these, which require no commentary to interpret them. Yet the poem, as a whole, is not unduly cryptic in expression. Those who blame a writer for obscurity ought to ask themselves whether his meaning could have been given more clearly; and if so, whether he can allege good and sufficient reasons for his default. On these counts I think Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; will secure an acquittal, if we remember that he was bound by the poetic forms and fashions of his day. The obscurity does not lie in his style so much as in the nature of his subject.</p>

<p>While his symbolism may have served him at times as a mask when plain speaking would have been dangerous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_612"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he generally uses it as the only possible means of imparting mystical truth; and in his own circle, no doubt, it was understood readily enough. We, on the other hand, must begin by learning it and end with recognising that no intellectual effort will bring us to the stage whence an initiated Mohammedan sets out.</p>  
<p>What makes the interpretation of the poem especially uncertain is that the author's account of his religious and mystical experience is psychological in character and throws but a faint light on his theological position. Was he really a pantheist, or was he an orthodox mystic whose feeling of oneness with God expressed itself in the language of pantheism? Does the <i>T&aacute;&#146;iyya</i> reflect the doctrines of Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute;, as its commentators believe? Although such questions cannot be ignored by any one who attempts to translate or explain the poem, they are not easy to answer definitely. I have followed K&aacute;sh&aacute;n&iacute; in the main; nevertheless I regard his interpretation as representing a point of view which is alien to Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;. Logically, the mystical doctrine of <i>itti&#7717;&aacute;d</i> (<i>Einswerden</i>) leads to the pantheistic monism of Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute;; but those who find in the <i>T&aacute;&#146;iyya</i> a poetical version of that system are confusing mysticism with philosophy. In some passages, however, we meet with philosophical ideas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_615"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and may draw inferences from them. While they do not appear to me to support the view that Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; was a follower of Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute;, they imply pantheism and monism on the plane of speculative thought, where commentators and theologians</p>

<p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="green">p. 194</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (not poets and mystics) are accustomed to dwell. I consider, therefore, that K.'s interpretation, false as it is to the spirit of the poem, places it in a medium intelligible to us and conveys its meaning in a relatively adequate form. And my readers will see at once how the mystical content of the <i>T&aacute;&#146;iyya</i> as well as its philosophical implications are illustrated by the foregoing essay on the <i>Ins&aacute;nu &#146;l-K&aacute;mil</i>.</p>  
<p>Was Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; consciously a pantheist? I do not think so. But in the permanent unitive state which he describes himself as having attained, he cannot speak otherwise than pantheistically: he is so merged in the Oneness that he identifies himself now with Mohammed (the Islamic Logos), now with God, whose attributes he assumes and makes his own.</p>  
<p>Many of these passages are such as no medieval religion but Islam would have tolerated, and we cannot wonder that he was charged with heresy. His opponents accused him of holding the doctrine of incarnation (<i>&#7717;ul&uacute;l</i>) and of pretending to be the <i>Qu&#7789;b</i>. He disavows hula l and shows how it differs from his own doctrine (<i>vv</i>. 277 foll.). As regards the <i>Qu&#7789;b</i>, the most explicit reference occurs in <i>vv</i>. 500-1:</p>  
<p><DIR>Therefore &#146;tis upon me the heavens turn, and marvel thou at their <i>Qu&#7789;b</i> (Pole) which encompasses them, howbeit the Pole is a central point.<br> And there was no <i>Qu&#7789;b</i> before me, whom I should succeed after having passed three grades (of sanctity), although the <i>Awt&aacute;d</i> rise to the rank of <i>Qu&#7789;b</i> from the rank of <i>Badal</i>.</DIR></p>  
<p>Here is another suspected verse (313):</p>  
<p><DIR>And my spirit is a spirit to all the spirits (of created beings); and whatsoever thou seest of beauty in the universe flows from the bounty of my nature.</DIR></p>  
<p>Evidently the poet declares himself to be one with the spiritual <i>Qu&#7789;b</i> (the Logos), whom in <i>v</i>. 501 he distinguishes from the terrestrial <i>Qu&#7789;b</i> (the head of the &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; hierarchy). The latter presides over the visible world. On his death he is succeeded by one of the three saints known as <i>Awt&aacute;d</i>, who are next to him in dignity and have themselves risen from the</p>  
<p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></A></p>  
<p>ranks of the forty <i>Abd&aacute;l</i> or <i>Budal&aacute;</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_616"></A><A HREF="siim18.htm#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The dominion of the spiritual <i>Qu&#7789;b</i>, the real Pole (<i>al-Qu&#7789;bu &#146;l-&#7717;aq&iacute;q&iacute;</i>), extends over the created things of both the visible and invisible worlds. He has neither predecessor nor successor, for he is the Spirit of Mohammed, <i>i.e.</i>, the essence of Man and the final cause of creation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_617"></A><A HREF="siim18.htm#fn_615"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693;, then, does not profess this heretical doctrine (<i>qu&#7789;biyya</i>, <i>qu&#7789;b&aacute;niyya</i>) in the sense which &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute;s ordinarily assign to it. His "Poleship" is not the temporal vicegerency delegated by Mohammed to the supreme saint of every age, but a pure consciousness of being one with the Spirit, who as the perfect image of God encompasses all things with his knowledge, power and glory.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_522"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_524">163:1</A> Even Zoroastrianism does not exclude the monistic principle. It seems to be uncertain whether Ormuzd and Ahriman stood in direct and equal antagonism to each other, or whether A&#7749;ra Mainyu (Ahriman), the evil spirit, and Spenta Mainyu, the good spirit, were conceived as opposite emanations of One (Ormuzd) who is above them both. In any case, the struggle between Ormuzd and Ahriman ends with the complete destruction of the latter.</P>

The two verses which he cites might bear an allegorical sense as easily as many of a similar kind in the Song of Solomon; and, in any case, they are extracted from <i>rub&aacute;&#145;&iacute;</i>s. The fact that Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; is known to have written one amatorious epigram (<i>D&iacute;w&aacute;n</i>, p. 549, 9 fol. Ibn Khallik&aacute;n, De Slane's translation, vol.

<P><A NAME="fn_546"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_548">172:2</A> According to N. the words "those who beheld thee" refer to the Light of Mohammed, which emanated from the Light of God.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_548"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_550">173:2</A> "Within thy borders": literally "within thy preserve (<i>&#7717;im&aacute;</i>)." The Divine Essence is preserved (made inaccessible) by the spiritual and sensible forms in which it veils itself. As the Bedouin poet brags about himself in order to assert the dignity of his tribe, so when the Mohammedan saints boast of the unique endowments which God has bestowed upon them, it is not self-glorification, but thanksgiving to Him "from whom all blessings flow."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_549"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_551">173:3</A> Real Being is manifested in phenomena, just as the light of the sun is reflected by the moon.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_550"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_552">173:4</A> See Kor. 6, 76 foll. "And when the night overshadowed him, he saw a <a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></A> star, and he said, This is my Lord; but when it set, he said, I like not gods which set. And when he saw the moon rising, he said, This is my Lord; but when he saw it set, he said, Verily, if my Lord direct me not, I shall become one of the people who go astray" (Sale's translation).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_551"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_553">174:1</A> In this verse there is an untranslatable play on the double meaning of Badr, which signifies (I) a place between Mecca and Medina where the Prophet won his memorable victory over the Meccan idolaters in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 624; (2) a full moon. Thus the <i>ahlu</i><i> Badr</i> are to Moslems more than what of &#0959;&#7985; &#0956;&#0945;&#0961;&#0945;&#0952;&#0969;&#0957;&#0959;&#0956;&#0940;&#0967;&#0945;&#0953; were to the Greeks of Plato's time, while the phrase also suggests the perfect illumination reserved for adepts in mysticism. Irish politics of forty years ago would provide an exact parallel, if the Moonlighters were regarded as national heroes and saints. The poet says that the men of Badr, <i>i.e.</i>, the noble company of mystics, journey not so much in the light which phenomena derive from Reality as in the light of Reality itself.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_587"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_589">184:2</A>. The soul was intoxicated with the wine of Divine Love (<i>i.e.</i> was rapt in contemplation of God) during its pre-existence in the eternal knowledge of God before the body was created.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_588"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_590">184:3</A> The full-moon is the Perfect Man, <i>i.e.</i> the gnostic or saint in whom God reveals Himself completely and who is, as it were, filled with Divine Love. The new moon is the gnostic veiled by his individuality, so that he manifests only a part of the Divine Light, not the whole; he causes the wine of Love to circle, <i>i.e.</i> he displays and makes known to others the Names and Attributes of God. When the wine is watered, <i>i.e.</i> when pure contemplation is blended with the element of religion, the seeker of God obtains spiritual direction and is like a traveller guided by the stars in his night-journey.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_589"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_591">184:4</A> N.'s commentary on this verse is characteristically recondite. He interprets "its perfume" as the sphere of the Primal Intelligence, whence emanate all created things; "its taverns" as the Divine Names and Attributes; "its resplendence" as the human intellect, which is a flash of the Primal Intelligence. Divine Love, being of the essence of God, has no form except in the imagination.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_590"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_592">185:1</A> "Time," <i>i.e.</i> the world of change. The second hemistich may be rendered literally: "&#146;tis as though its occultation were a concealment in the breasts of (human) minds."</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_592"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_594">185:3</A> This verse describes the gradual fading of ecstasy from the heart of the mystic.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_593"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_595">185:4</A> I need not trouble my readers with the detailed allegorical analysis to which the commentator subjects this and the next nine verses. They explain themselves, if taken as a fanciful description of the miracles wrought by Divine Love.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_594"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_596">186:1</A> The <i>fid&aacute;m</i> is a strainer placed over the mouth of the bottle, so that the wine may run clear.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_595"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_597">186:2</A> Vv. 23-30 are wanting in the commentary of B&uacute;r&iacute;n&iacute; and may have been inserted in the poem by a copyist. See Nallino, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 31, note I. Divine Love, as the eternal source of all created things, is logically prior to them, although it does not precede them in time, which itself is created.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_596"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_598">186:3</A> Inasmuch as real being belongs to God alone, mystical union cannot be likened to the permeation of one body by another, as when water is absorbed by a sponge.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_597"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_599">186:4</A> This enigmatic verse refers to Being under its two aspects. Wine signifies pure being, vine phenomenal being. In so far as man is related to the Divine Spirit (here identified with Adam, whom God "created in His own <a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="green">p. 187</font></A> image"), he is pure reality; but in so far as he belongs to Nature, he is unreal. "Its mother" is the mother of wine, <i>i.e.</i> the vine, which is a symbol for the material world.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_598"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_600">187:1</A> The "vessels" are the phenomenal forms by which real being is manifested. They are "subtle," <i>i.e.</i> spiritual, because every such form is the veil of a reality. These realities "increase," <i>i.e.</i> appear as the Many, by means of the forms which our senses perceive.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_599"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_601">187:2</A> Absolute Being or God or Divine Love&#151;all these terms are the same in essence&#151;is not conditioned by time.</P>

This, I think, is merely a paradox indicating the timeless nature of reality. The word "orphanhood" (<i>yutm</i>) may allude to Mohammed (cf. note on the <i>T&aacute;&#146;iyya</i>, <i>vv</i>. 288-9). In this case the meaning will be that Mohammed (as the Logos) existed before the creation of Adam. According to N., Absolute Being is made an " orphan " by the passing-away (<i>fan&aacute;</i>) of the spirit in man. Universal Spirit or Reason, the first emanation, may be said to "die" when its essence (the human spirit) is mystically re-united with the Absolute; and its "death" leaves the Absolute, <i>i.e.</i> the phenomenal world regarded as the other self of the Absolute, "an orphan in the bosom of its mother Nature."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_601"></A><A HREF="siim17.htm#fr_603">187:4</A> Moslems associate with Christianity the beverage forbidden by their own religion. When their poets describe a wine-party, the scene is often laid in the neighbourhood of a Christian monastery (<i>dayr</i>). Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; says that the Christians became intoxicated without having drunk, <i>i.e.</i> their doctrine that God reveals Himself in Christ is only a glimpse of the truth, <a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 188</font></A> which is fully realised by Moslem saints, that God reveals Himself in every atom of existence. Cf. the <i>T&aacute;&#146;iyya</i>, <i>v</i>. 730 foll. and <A HREF="siim14.htm#page_140">p. 140</A> <i>supra</i>.</P>

I give Munro's translation: "Again when mighty legions fill with their movements all parts of the plains, waging the mimicry of war, the glitter then lifts itself up to the sky, and the whole earth round gleams with brass, and beneath a noise is raised by the mighty trampling of men, and the mountains stricken by the shouting re-echo the voices to the stars of heaven, and horsemen fly about and suddenly wheeling scour across the middle of the plains, shaking them with the vehemence of their charge. And yet there is some place on the high hills, seen from which they appear to stand still and to rest on the plains as a bright spot."</P>

The spiritual and sensible worlds derive their life from Universal Spirit and Universal Soul (<i>v</i>. 405; cf. <i>v</i>. 492). In <i>v</i>. 455 the &#7716;all&aacute;jian terms, <i>l&aacute;h&uacute;t</i> (divinity) and <i>n&aacute;s&uacute;t</i> (humanity) are used in the same way as by Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute;, to denote the inward and outward aspects of the Being with whom the "unified" mystic is one (cf. Massignon, <i>Kit&aacute;b al-&#7788;aw&aacute;s&iacute;n</i>, p. 139). Allusions to the pre-existence of the soul occur in <i>vv</i>. 41, 257-8, 428, 670 and 759. Unlike J&iacute;l&iacute;, Ibnu &#146;l-F&aacute;ri&#7693; shows no sign of acquaintance with Ibnu &#146;l-&#145;Arab&iacute;'s philosophical terminology or, so far as I have observed, of being directly influenced by him in any considerable degree.</P>
