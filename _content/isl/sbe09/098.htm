<p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
<p>Those of the people of the Book and the idolaters</p>  
<p><a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="green">p. 338</font></A></p>  
<p>who misbelieve did not fall off until there came to them the manifest sign,--</p>  
<p>An apostle from God reading pure pages wherein are right scriptures:</p>  
<p>Nor did those who were given the Book divide into sects until after there came to them the manifest sign.</p>  
<p>But they were not bidden aught but to worship God, being sincere in religion unto Him as &#8216;Han&icirc;fs, and to be steadfast in prayer, and to give alms: for that is the standard religion.</p>  
<p>[5] Verily, those who disbelieve amongst the people of the Book and the idolaters shall be in the fire of hell, to dwell therein for aye; they are wretched creatures!</p>  
<p>Verily, those who believe and act aright, they are the best of creatures; their reward with their Lord is gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye; God shall be well pleased with them, and they with Him! that is for him who fears his Lord!</p>
