<p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
<p>I need not swear by the resurrection day!</p>  
<p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="green">p. 311</font></A></p>  
<p>Nor need I swear by the self-accusing soul!</p>  
<p>Does man think that we shall not collect his bones? Able are we to arrange his finger tips!</p>  
<p>[5] Nay, but man wishes to be wicked henceforward! he asks, When is the resurrection day?</p>  
<p>But when the sight shall be dazed, and the moon be eclipsed, and the sun and the moon be together, [10] and man shall say upon that day, 'Where is a place to flee to?'--nay, no refuge! and to thy Lord that day is the sure settlement: He will inform man on that day of what He has sent forward or delayed!</p>  
<p>Nay, man is an evidence against himself, [15] and even if he thrusts forward his excuses--.</p>  
<p>Do not move thy tongue thereby to hasten it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_446"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is for us to collect it and to read it; and when we read it then follow its reading. And again it is for us to explain it.</p>  
<p>[20] Nay, indeed, but ye love the transient life, and ye neglect the hereafter!</p>  
<p>Faces on that day shall be bright, gazing on their Lord!</p>  
<p>And faces on that day shall be dismal!</p>  
<p>[25] Thou wilt think that a back-breaking calamity has happened to them!</p>  
<p>Nay, but when the [soul] comes up into the throat, and it is said, 'Who will charm it back?' and he will think that it is his parting [hour]. And leg shall be pressed on leg&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; [30] unto thy Lord on that day shall the driving be.</p>  
<p>For he did not believe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and did not pray; but</p>

<p>he said it was a lie, and turned his back! Then he went to his people haughtily--woe to thee, and woe to thee! again woe to thee, and woe to thee!</p>  
<p>Does man think that he shall be left to himself?</p>  
<p>Wasn't&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="076.htm#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he a clot of emitted seed? Then he was congealed blood, and (God) created him, and fashioned him, and made of him pairs, male and female.</p>  
<p>[35] Is not He able to quicken the dead?</p>
