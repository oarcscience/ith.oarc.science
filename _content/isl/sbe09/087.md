### THE CHAPTER OF THE MOST HIGH.

### (LXXXVII. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

Celebrated the name of thy Lord most High, who created and fashioned,
and who decreed and guided, and who brings forth the pasture, \[5\] and
then makes it dusky stubble!

We will make thee recite, and thou shalt not forget <span
id="fr_479"></span>[2](#fn_479), save what God pleases. Verily, He knows
the open and what is concealed; and we will send

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

thee easily to ease; wherefore remind, for, verily, the reminder is
useful.

\[10\] But he who fears will be mindful; but the wretch will avoid it;
he who will broil on the great fire, and then therein shall neither die
nor live!

Prosperous is he who purifies himself, \[15\] and remembers the name of
his Lord and prays!

Nay! but ye prefer the life of this world, while the, hereafter is
better and more lasting.

Verily, this was in the books of yore,--the books of Abraham and Moses.
