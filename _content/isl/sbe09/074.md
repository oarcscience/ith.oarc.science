### THE CHAPTER OF THE 'COVERED <span id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_441).'

### (LXXIV. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

O thou who art covered! rise up and warn! And thy Lord magnify!

\[5\] And thy garments purify!

And abomination shun!

And grant not favours to gain increase!

And for thy Lord await!

And when the trump is blown,--for that day is a

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

difficult day! \[10\] for the misbelievers aught but easy!

Leave me alone with him I have created, and for whom I have made
extensive wealth <span id="fr_442"></span>[1](#fn_442), and sons that he
may look upon, and for whom I have smoothed things down. \[15\] Then he
desires that I should increase! nay, verily, he is hostile to our signs!
I will drive him up a hill! Then he reflected and planned! May he be
killed,--how he planned! \[20\] Again, may he be killed,--how he
planned! Then he looked; then he frowned and scowled; then he retreated
and was big with pride and said, 'This is only magic exhibited! \[25\]
this is only mortal speech!'--I will broil him in hell-fire! and what
shall make thee know what hell-fire is? It will not leave and will not
let alone. It scorches the flesh; \[30\] over it are nineteen (angels).

We have made only angels guardians of the fire, and we have only made
their number a trial to those who misbelieve; that those who have been
given the Book may be certain, and that those who believe may be
increased in faith; and that those who have been given the Book and the
believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts is sickness, and
the misbelievers may say, 'What does God mean by this as a parable?'

Thus God leads astray whom He pleases, and guides him He pleases: and
none knows the hosts of thy Lord save Himself; and it is only a reminder
to mortals!

\[35\] Nay, by the moon!

And the night when it retires!

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

And the morning when it brightly dawns!

Verily, it is one of the greatest misfortunes; a warning to mortals;
\[40\] for him amongst you who wishes to press forward or to tarry!

Every soul is pledged <span id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_443) for what it
earns; except the fellows of the right: in gardens shall they ask each
other about the sinners!--\`What drove you into hell-fire?'

They shall say, 'We weren't <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_444) of
those who prayed; \[45\] we didn't feed the poor; but we did plunge into
discussion with those who plunged, and we called the judgment day a lie
until the certainty <span id="fr_445"></span>[3](#fn_445) did come to
us!'

But there shall not profit them the intercession of the intercessors.

\[50\] What ailed them that they turned away from the memorial as though
they were timid asses fleeing from a lion?

Nay, every man of them wished that he might have given him books spread
open!

Nay, but they did not fear the hereafter!

Nay, it is a memorial! and let him who will remember it; \[55\] but none
will remember it except God please. He is most worthy of fear; and he is
most worthy to forgive!
