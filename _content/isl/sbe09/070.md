### THE CHAPTER OF THE ASCENTS.

### (LXX. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

An asker <span id="fr_427"></span>[1](#fn_427) asked for torment that
must befall, for the unbelievers; there is no repelling it; from God the
Lord of the ascents <span id="fr_428"></span>[2](#fn_428), whereby
ascend the angels

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

and the Spirit unto Him in a day whose length is fifty thousand
years <span id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_429).

\[5\] Wherefore be patient with fair patience; verily, they see it as
afar off, but we see it nigh!

The day when the heaven shall be as molten brass, and the mountains
shall be, like flocks of wool; \[10\] when no warm friend shall question
friend; they shall gaze on each other, and the sinner would fain give as
a ransom from the torment of that day his sons and his mate, and his
brother and his kin who stand by him, and all who are in the earth, that
yet it might rescue him!

\[15\] Nay, verily, it is a flame,--dragging by the scalp! it shall call
those who retreated and turned their backs and who amassed and hoarded!

Verily, man is by nature rash <span id="fr_430"></span>[2](#fn_430)!
\[20\] when evil touches him, very impatient; when good touches him,
niggardly; all save those who pray, who remain at their prayers, and in
whose wealth is a reasonable due (set aside) \[25\] for him who asks and
him who is kept from asking, and those who believe in a day of judgment,
and those who shrink in terror from the torment of their Lord;--verily,
the torment of their Lord is not safe;--and those who guard their
private parts, \[30\] except for their wives or the (slave girls) whom
their right hands possess, for they are not to be blamed; but whoso
craves beyond this, they are the transgressors; and those who observe
their trusts and their compacts, and those who are upright in their
testimonies, and those who keep their prayers, \[35\] these shall dwell
in gardens honoured.

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

What ails the misbelievers that they hurry on before thee, crowding
together on the right and on the left <span
id="fr_431"></span>[1](#fn_431)? Does every man of them wish to enter
the garden of pleasure?

Nay, we created them of what they know!

\[40\] And I need not swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests <span
id="fr_432"></span>[2](#fn_432); verily, we are able to change them for
others better, nor are we prevented!

So leave them to plunge in discussion, and to play until they meet that
day of theirs which they are threatened with, the day when they shall
come forth in haste from the graves, as though they flock to a standard!
with their looks abashed; meanness shall cover then! That is the day
which they were promised!
