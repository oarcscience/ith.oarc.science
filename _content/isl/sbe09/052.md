### THE CHAPTER OF THE MOUNT.

### (LII. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

By the mount! by the Book inscribed upon an outstretched vellum! by the
frequented house <span id="fr_338"></span>[3](#fn_338)! \[5\] by the
elevated roof <span id="fr_339"></span>[4](#fn_339)! by the swelling
sea! verily, the torment of thy Lord will come to pass;--there is none
to avert it!

The day when the heavens shall reel about,

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[10\] and the
mountains shall move about,--then woe upon that day to those who call
(the apostles) liars, who plunge into discussion for a sport!

On the day when they shall be thrust away into the fire of hell,--'This
is the fire, the which ye used to call a lie!--\[15\] Is it magic, this?
or can ye not see?--broil ye therein, and be patient thereof or be not
patient, it is the same to you: ye are but rewarded for that which ye
did do!'

Verily, the pious (shall be) in gardens and pleasure, enjoying what
their Lord has given them; for their Lord will save them from the
torment of hell.

'Eat and drink with good digestion, for that which ye have done!'

\[20\] Reclining on couches in rows; and we will wed them to large-eyed
maids.

And those who believe and whose seed follows them in the faith, we will
unite their seed with them; and we will not cheat them of their work at
all;--every man is pledged for what he earns <span
id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_340).

And we will extend to them fruit and flesh such as they like. They
shall. pass to and fro therein a cup in which is neither folly nor sin.

And round them shall go boys of theirs, as though they were hidden
pearls.

\[25\] And they shall accost each other and ask questions, and shall
say, 'Verily, we were before amidst our families shrinking with
terror <span id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_341), but God has been gracious
to us and saved us from the torment of the hot blast.

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

'Verily, we used to call on Him before; verily, He is the righteous, the
compassionate!'

Wherefore do thou <span id="fr_342"></span>[1](#fn_342) remind them: for
thou art, by the favour of thy Lord, neither a soothsayer nor mad!

Will they say, 'A poet; we wait for him the sad accidents of fate?'

\[30\] Say, 'Wait ye then; for I too am of those who wait!'

Do their dreams bid them this? or are they an outrageous people?

Or will they say, 'He has invented it?'--nay, but they do not believe!

But let them bring a discourse like it, if they tell the truth!

\[35\] Or were they created of nothing, or were they the creators? Or
did they create the heavens and the earth?--nay, but they are not sure!

Or have they the treasures of thy Lord? or are they the governors
supreme?

Or have they a ladder whereon they can listen <span
id="fr_343"></span>[2](#fn_343)?--then let their listener bring obvious
authority.

Has He daughters, while ye have sons?

\[40\] Or dost thou ask them a hire, while they are borne down by debt?

Or have they the unseen, so that they write it down?

Or do they desire a plot?--but those who misbelieve it is who are
plotted against!

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

Or have they a god beside God? celebrated be God's praises above what
they join with Him!

But if they should see a fragment of the sky falling down, they would
say, 'Clouds in masses!'

\[45\] But leave them till they meet that day of theirs whereon they
shall swoon <span id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_344); the day when their
plotting shall avail them naught, and they shall not be helped!

And, verily, there is a torment beside that <span
id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_345) for those who do wrong; but most of them
do not know!

But wait thou patiently for the judgment of thy Lord, for thou art in
our eyes. And celebrate the praises of thy Lord what time thou risest,
and in the night, and at the fading of the stars!
