### THE CHAPTER OF THE ELEPHANT.

### (CV. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

Hast thou not seen what thy Lord did with the fellows of the
elephant <span id="fr_501"></span>[2](#fn_501)?

Did He not make their stratagem lead them astray, and send down on them
birds in flocks, to throw down on them stones of baked clay, \[5\] and
make them like blades of herbage eaten down?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_501"></span>[341:2](105.htm#fr_501) Abrahat el Asram, an
Abyssinian Christian, and viceroy of the king of Sanaa in Yemen in the
year in which Mohammed was born, marched with a large army and some
elephants upon Mecca, with the intention of destroying the Kaabah. He
was defeated and his army destroyed in so sudden a manner as to have
given rise to the <span id="page_342">p. 342</span> legend embodied in
the text. It is conjectured that small-pox broke out amongst his men.
