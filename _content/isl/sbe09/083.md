### THE CHAPTER OF THOSE WHO GIVE SHORT WEIGHT.

### (LXXXIII. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

Woe to those who give short weight! who when

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

they measure against others take full measure; but when they measure to
them or weigh to them, diminish!

Do not these think that they shall be raised again \[5\] at the mighty
day? the day when men shall stand before the Lord of the worlds!

Nay, verily, the book of the wicked is in Si*gg*în <span
id="fr_469"></span>[1](#fn_469); and what shall make thee know what
Si*gg*în is?--a book inscribed!

\[10\] Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!

Who call the judgment day a lie! but none shall call it a lie except
every sinful transgressor, who, when our signs are read to him, says,
'Old folks' tales!'

Nay, but that which they have gained has settled upon their hearts.

Nay, verily, \[15\] from their Lord on that day are they veiled; and
then, verily, they shall broil in hell; then it shall be said, 'This is
what ye once did call a lie!'

Nay, verily, the book of the righteous is in ‘Illiyûn <span
id="fr_470"></span>[2](#fn_470); and what shall make thee know what
‘Illiyûn is?--\[20\] a book inscribed! those nigh to God shall witness
it.

Verily, the righteous shall be in pleasure; upon couches shall they
gaze; thou mayest recognise in their faces the brightness of pleasure;
\[25\] they shall be given to drink wine that is sealed, whose seal is
musk; for that then let the aspirants aspire!

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --and it shall be
tempered with Tasnîm <span id="fr_471"></span>[1](#fn_471),--a spring
from which those nigh to God shall drink.

Verily, those who sin do laugh at those who believe; \[30\] and when
they pass by they wink at one another, and when they return to their
family they return ridiculing them; and when they see them they say,
'Verily, these do go astray!'--but they are not sent as guardians over
them!

But to-day those who believe shall at the misbelievers laugh! \[35\]
Upon couches shall they gaze; are the misbelievers rewarded for what
they have done?
