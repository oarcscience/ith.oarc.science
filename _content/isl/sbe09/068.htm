<p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
<p>N.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_417"></A><A HREF="#fn_417"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> By the pen, and what they write, thou art not, by God's grace, mad! and, verily, thine is a hire that is not grudged! [5] and, verily, thou art of a grand nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_418"></A><A HREF="#fn_418"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!</p>  
<p>But thou shalt see and they shall see which of you is the infatuated.</p>  
<p>Verily, thy Lord He knows best who errs from His way; and He knows best those who are guided.</p>  
<p>Then obey not those who call thee liar; they would fain that thou shouldst be smooth with them, then would they be smooth with thee!</p>  
<p>[10] And obey not any mean swearer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_419"></A><A HREF="#fn_419"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, a backbiter,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="green">p. 296</font></A></p>  
<p>a walker about with slander; a forbidder of good, a transgressor, a sinner; rude, and base-born too; though he have wealth and sons!</p>  
<p>[15] When our signs are recited to him he says, 'Old folks&#8217; tales!'</p>  
<p>We will brand him on the snout!</p>  
<p>Verily, we have tried them as we tried the fellows of the garden when they swore, 'We will cut its fruit at morn!'</p>  
<p>But they made not the exception&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_420"></A><A HREF="#fn_420"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and there came round about it an encompassing calamity from thy Lord the while they slept; [20] and on the morrow it was as one the fruit of which is cut.</p>  
<p>And they cried to each other in the morning, 'Go early to your tilth if ye would cut it!'</p>  
<p>So they set off, saying privily to each other, 'There shall surely enter it to-day unto you no poor person!'</p>  
<p>[25] And they went early deciding to be stingy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_421"></A><A HREF="#fn_421"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>And when they saw it they said, 'Verily, we have erred! Nay, we are forbidden (its fruit)!'</p>  
<p>Said the most moderate of them, 'Said I not to you, "unless ye celebrate God's praises!"'</p>  
<p>Said they, 'Celebrated be the praises of our Lord! verily, we were unjust!'</p>  
<p>[30] And they approached each other with mutual blame.</p>  
<p>Said they, 'O woe to us! verily, we have been outrageous! Haply our Lord may give us instead a better than it; verily, we unto our Lord do yearn,'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="green">p. 297</font></A></p>  
<p>Thus is the torment, but, verily, the torment of the hereafter is greater, if ye did but know!</p>  
<p>Verily, for the pious with their Lord are gardens of pleasure!</p>  
<p>[35] Shall we then make the Muslims like the sinners? What ails you? how ye judge!</p>  
<p>Or have ye a book in which ye can study, that ye are surely to have what ye may choose?</p>  
<p>Or have ye oaths binding on us until the judgment day that ye are surely to have what ye may judge?</p>  
<p>[40] Ask them, which of them will vouch for this?</p>  
<p>Or have they partners, then let them bring their partners if they do speak the truth?</p>  
<p>On the day when the leg shall be bared&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_422"></A><A HREF="#fn_422"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and they shall be called to adore and shall not be able!</p>  
<p>Lowering their looks, abasement shall attack them, for they were called to adore while yet they were safe!</p>  
<p>But let me alone with him who calls this new discourse a lie. We will surely bring them down by degrees from whence they do not know.</p>  
<p>[45] And I will let them have their way! for my device is sure.</p>  
<p>Or dost thou ask them a hire for it while they are burdened with debts?</p>  
<p>Or have they the knowledge of the unseen, so that they write?</p>  
<p>But wait patiently for the judgment of thy Lord, and be not like the fellow of the fish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_423"></A><A HREF="#fn_423"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, when he cried out as he was choking with rage.</p>  
<p>

<p>Had it not been that grace from his Lord reached him, he would have been cast out on the naked (shore) and blamed the while!</p>  
<p>[50] But his Lord elected him, and made him of the pious.</p>  
<p>The misbelievers well-nigh upset thee with their looks when they hear the reminder, and they say, 'Surely he is mad!'</p>  
<p>And yet it is but a reminder to the worlds!</p>
