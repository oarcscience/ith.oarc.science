<p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
<p>What is in the heavens and what is in the earth celebrates the praises of God the King, the holy, the mighty, the wise!</p>  
<p>He it is who sent unto the Gentiles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_401"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> a prophet amongst themselves to recite to them His signs and to purify them, and to teach them the Book and</p>

<p><a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="green">p. 283</font></A></p>  
<p>the wisdom, although they were before in obvious error.</p>  
<p>And others of them have not yet overtaken them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_402"></A><A HREF="#fn_402"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; but He is the mighty, the wise!</p>  
<p>That is God's grace, He gives it to whomsoever He will; for God is Lord of mighty grace.</p>  
<p>[5] The likeness of those who were charged with the law and then bore it not is as the likeness of an ass bearing books: sorry is the likeness of the people who say God's signs are lies! but God guides not an unjust people.</p>  
<p>Say, 'O ye who are Jews! if ye pretend that ye are the clients of God, beyond other people; then wish for death if ye do speak the truth!'</p>  
<p>But they never wish for it, through what their hands have sent before! but God knows the unjust.</p>  
<p>Say, 'Verily, the death from which ye flee will surely meet you; then shall ye be sent back to Him who knows the unseen and the visible, and He will inform you of that which ye have done''</p>  
<p>O ye who believe! when the call to prayer is made upon the Congregation Day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, then hasten to the remembrance of God, and leave off traffic; that is better for you, if ye did but know!</p>  
<p>[10] And when prayer is performed, then disperse abroad in the land, and crave of God's grace; and remember God much; haply ye may prosper!</p>  
<p>But when they see merchandise or sport they flock to it and leave thee standing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>! Say, 'What is</p>

<p>with God is better than sport and than merchandise, for God is the best of providers!'</p>
