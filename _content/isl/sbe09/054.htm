<p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
<p>The Hour draws nigh, and the moon is split</p>

<p>asunder&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But if they see a sign they turn aside and say, 'Magic, continuous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!'</p>  
<p>And they call it a lie and follow their lusts; but every matter is settled!</p>  
<p>There has come to them some information&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with restraint in it--[5] wisdom far-reaching--but warners avail not!</p>  
<p>But turn thy back on them!</p>  
<p>The day when the caller&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> shall call to an awkward thing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Humbly casting down their looks shall they come forth from their graves, as though they were locusts scattered abroad!</p>  
<p>Hurrying forwards to the caller! the misbelievers shall say, 'This is a difficult day!'</p>  
<p>Noah's people before them called (the apostles) liars; they called our servant a liar; and they said, 'Mad!' and he was rejected.</p>  
<p>[10] And he called upon his Lord, 'Verily, I am overcome, come then to my help!'</p>  
<p>And we opened the gates of heaven with water pouring down!</p>  
<p>

<p>And we made the earth burst forth in springs, and the waters met at a bidding already decreed.</p>  
<p>But we bore him on the thing of planks and nails; sailing on beneath our eyes, a reward for him who had been disbelieved!</p>  
<p>[15] And we left it a sign;--but is there any one who will mind?</p>  
<p>&#8216;&Acirc;d called the apostles liars, and how was my punishment and my warning?</p>  
<p>Verily, we sent on them a cold storm wind on a day of continuous ill-luck!</p>  
<p>[20] It reft men away as though they had been palm stumps torn up!</p>  
<p>We have made the Qur&#8217;&acirc;n easy as a reminder--but is there any one who will mind?</p>  
<p>Tham&ucirc;d called the warnings lies, and said, 'A mortal, one of us, alone, shall we follow him? then indeed were we in error and excitement&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!</p>  
<p>[25] 'Is the warning cast on him alone among us? nay, he is an insolent liar!</p>  
<p>'They shall know to-morrow about the insolent liar!</p>  
<p>'Verily, we are about to send the she-camel as a trial for them, then watch them and have patience! and inform them that the water is shared between them (and her); each draught shall be sought by turns.'</p>  
<p>Then they called their companion, and he plied (a knife) and hamstrung her.</p>  
<p>[30] Then how was my punishment and my warning? Verily, we sent against them one noise, and they were like the dry sticks of him who builds a fold.</p>

<p>We have made the Qur&#8217;&acirc;n easy as a reminder--but is there any one who will mind?</p>  
<p>Lot's people called the apostles liars; verily, we sent against them a heavy sand storm; all, save Lot's family, we saved them at the dawn. [35] As a favour from us; so do we reward him who gives thanks!</p>  
<p>He indeed had warned them of our assault, but they doubted of the warning.</p>  
<p>And they desired his guest, and we put out their eyes.</p>  
<p>'So taste ye my torment and warning!'</p>  
<p>And there overtook them on the morning a settled punishment!</p>  
<p>'So taste ye my torment and warning!'</p>  
<p>[40] We have made the Qur&#8217;&acirc;n easy as a reminder--but is there any one who will mind?</p>  
<p>The warning came to Pharaoh's people; they called our signs all lies, and we seized on them with the seizing of a mighty powerful one.</p>  
<p>Are your misbelievers better than they? or have ye an exemption in the Scriptures? Or do they say we are a victorious company?</p>  
<p>[45] The whole shall be routed and shall turn their backs in flight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Nay, the Hour is their promised time! and the Hour is most severe and bitter!</p>  
<p>Verily, the sinners are in error and excitement. On the day when they shall be dragged to the fire upon their faces!--'Taste ye the touch of hell.'</p>  
<p>Verily, everything have we created by decree, [50] and our bidding is but one (word), like the twinkling of an eye!</p>  
<p>

<p>We have destroyed the like of you--but is there any who will mind?</p>  
<p>And everything they do is in the books&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and everything small and great is written down.</p>  
<p>Verily, the pious shall be amid gardens and rivers, [55] in the seat of truth, with the powerful king.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_354"></A><A HREF="054.htm#fr_354">255:1</A> According to a tradition this refers to a miracle: the unbelievers having asked for a sign, the moon appeared to be cloven in twain. The tradition is, however, supported by very doubtful authority, and is directly opposed to the teaching of the Qur&#8217;&acirc;n elsewhere, for the power to comply with the demand for a sign is always distinctly disclaimed. The more usual explanation is the natural one, that the expression merely refers to one of the signs of the day of judgment.</P>
