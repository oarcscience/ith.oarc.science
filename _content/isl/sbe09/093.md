### THE CHAPTER OF THE FORENOON.

### (XCIII. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

By the forenoon!

And the night when it darkens!

is better for thee than the former; \[5\] and in the end thy Lord will
give thee, and thou shalt be well pleased!

Did He not find thee an orphan, and give thee

shelter? and find thee erring, and guide thee? and find thee poor with a
family, and nourish thee?

But as for the orphan oppress him not; \[10\] and as for the beggar
drive him not away; and as for the favour of thy Lord discourse thereof.
