### THE CHAPTER OF THE RENDING ASUNDER.

### (LXXXIV. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

When the heaven is rent asunder and gives ear unto its Lord, and is
dutiful!

And when the earth is stretched out and casts forth what is in it, and
is empty, \[5\] and gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful!

O man! verily, thou art toiling after thy Lord, toiling; wherefore shalt
thou meet Him!

And as for him who is given his book in his right hand, he shall be
reckoned with by an easy reckoning; and he shall go back to his family
joyfully.

\[10\] But as for him who is given his book behind his back <span
id="fr_472"></span>[2](#fn_472), he shall call out for destruction, but
he

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

shall broil in a blaze! Verily, he was amongst his family joyful.
Verily, he thought that he should never return to God.

\[15\] Yea, verily, his Lord on him did look!  
I need not swear by the evening glow,  
Or by the night, and what it drives together,  
Or by the moon when it is at its full,  
Ye shall be surely transferred from state to state <span
id="fr_473"></span>[1](#fn_473)!

\[20\] What ails them that they do not believe? and, when the Qur’ân is
read to them, do not adore? Nay, those who misbelieve do say it is a
lie, but God knows best the (malice) that they hide.

So give them the glad tidings of grievous woe! \[25\] save those who
believe and act aright, for them is hire that is not grudged!
