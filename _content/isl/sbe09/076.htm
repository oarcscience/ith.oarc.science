<p>Does there not come on man a portion of time when he is nothing worth mentioning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_450"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?</p>  
<p>Verily, we created man from a mingled clot, to try him; and we gave him hearing and sight. Verily, we guided him in the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful.</p>  
<p>Verily, we have prepared for those who misbelieve chains and fetters and a blaze!</p>  
<p>[5] Verily, the righteous shall drink of a cup tempered with K&acirc;f&ucirc;r&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, a spring from which God's servants shall drink and make it gush out as they please!</p>
