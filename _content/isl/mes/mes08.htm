<p align="center"><i>Sheykh Sal&#257;hu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><i> Fer&#299;d&#363;n, surnamed Zer-K&#363;b</i> (<i>Goldbeater</i>).</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">1.</h3>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sheykh Sal&#257;hu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n</span> was originally a fellow-disciple with Jel&#257;l, as pupils to Seyyid Burh&#257;nu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n. He afterwards became a goldbeater, as his parents were poor.</p>  
<p>After a while, when Jel&#257;l's reputation became great, Sal&#257;h went and paid him his respects. Jel&#257;l knew how highly Burh&#257;n had esteemed Sal&#257;h, when his pupil. He therefore received him in a very friendly manner, and their intercourse became warmly renewed.</p>  
<p>One day, after the murder of Shemsu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, and the return of Jel&#257;l from Damascus, he sent for Sal&#257;h, and appointed him his own assistant in the government and instruction of the disciples, presenting him also to the king in that capacity.</p>  <h4 align="center">2.</h4>  
<p>Jel&#257;l's first royal protector, &#8216;Al&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Keyqub&#257;d, was now dead, and his son, Gay&#257;su-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Key-Khusrev, reigned in his stead.</p>  
<p>The monarch one day made a feast in the vineyards, and went forth into the fields for a walk, alone. He picked up a young snake, carried it indoors, placed it in a gold box, sealed this up, and then rejoined his courtiers.</p>  
<p>To those attendants the king exhibited the sealed packet, as having just then been privately received from the Qaysar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p>of Constantinople with a message to this effect: "If your religion of Isl&#257;m be the true faith, some one of your wise men will be able to see into this packet without breaking its seals, and to tell what it contains."</p>  
<p>The king then called upon his ministers to prove their loyalty to him, and their faithfulness to their religion, by solving this riddle. None of them was able.</p>  
<p>The packet was now sent round in succession to all the eminent teachers and theologians of the city; but none could unravel the enigma.</p>  
<p>At last it was brought to Jel&#257;l, as Sheykh Fer&#299;d&#363;n and he were sitting together. Jel&#257;l invited Fer&#299;d&#363;n to tell them the contents of the packet; and he immediately replied: "It is not a dignified act in the king to imprison a young snake in a gold box, sealing this up as a packet, and then tempting his courtiers, ministers, and learned men with a false pretence. A saint, however, knows not only the solution of so paltry a trick as this, but is also aware of every thought in the king's heart, and every secret of earth and heaven."</p>  
<p>When this answer was reported to the king, he came to the college, and professed himself a disciple, remarking: "If the disciples of Shemsu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n possess such power, and work such miracles, how great must have been the sanctity of the murdered martyr."</p>  
<p>Fer&#299;d&#363;n acted for ten years as assistant to Jel&#257;l.</p>  <h4 align="center">3.</h4>  
<p>F&#257;tima, the daughter of Sheykh Sal&#257;hu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Fer&#299;d&#363;n, was married to Sultan Veled, Jel&#257;l's son. Jel&#257;l used to teach her to read the Qur&#8217;&#257;n and other books.</p>  
<p>Jel&#257;l used to call F&#257;tima his <i>right eye;</i> her sister Hediyya, <i>his left eye;</i> and their mother, Lat&#299;fa Kh&#257;t&#363;n, <i>the personification of God's grace</i>.</p>  
<p>When F&#257;tima's marriage was solemnised, all the angels of heaven were present, and wished the young couple all happiness.</p>

<p>She was a saint, and continually worked miracles. She fasted by day and watched by night, tasting food only once in three days. She was very charitable to the poor, the orphans, and the widows, distributing to them food and raiment.</p>  
<p>Sheykh Fer&#299;d&#363;n died on New Year's Day, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 657 (28th December, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1258).</p>
