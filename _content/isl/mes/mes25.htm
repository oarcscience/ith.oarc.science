<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hus&#257;mu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n</span>, Light of the Truth, take up, my friend,<br> A sheet, that thou a Teacher's virtues mayst append.<br> True, thou&#8217;rt not strong; thy frame is delicate, at best;<br> But thou&#8217;rt the sun that lights my thoughts to their safe nest.<br> Thou art both lamp and lantern, all in one. Dost see?<br> Guide to my heart's behests, clue to my wish thou&#8217;rt he.<br> Their thread is in thy hand; thy guidance can it shift;<br> The pearls upon it strung are gems, thy soul's free gift.</p>  
<p>Write down the qualities by which a Teacher's known.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span> Select thy Teacher first; then, follow all he's shown.<br> A Teacher's summer's glow; cold winter, crowd terrene;<br> The rabble's darkness self; the Teacher, moon serene.</p>  
<p>Young Fortune have I named my Teacher, for the nonce;&#8212;<br> Young Fortune, truth's real Teacher; vigorous at once.<br> An ancient Teacher he; commencement he ne&#8217;er had;<br> A solitary pearl;&#8212;all peerless, never sad.<br> Increase of age gives wine fresh strength, as well is known;<br> Especially truth's wine, that flows from God's high throne.<br> Select a Teacher, then. Without such, travel's vain;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_10">10</A></FONT></span> The way is dangerous,&#8212;beset with evil's train.</p>

<p>By well-known road, though travelled many times before,<br> Without a guide to venture, opens peril's door.<br> How then an unknown path thou ne&#8217;er hast followed yet?<br> Go not alone, without a guide;&#8212;act not in fret.<br> Unless thy Teacher be at hand to lead thee right,<br> The clamours of the demons surely thee&#8217;ll affright.<br> Those demons will mislead thee, into danger cast;<br> More clever ones than thou have lost their wits at last.</p>  
<p>Learn from the Prophet's words the error of their ways;<br> How Satan led them far astray in bygone days. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_15">15</A></FONT></span><br> From off the track to all that's good he them misled;<br> Them carried off; them rendered blind, by vain thoughts fed.<br> Behold their bones, their skeletons, along the road!<br> Take warning thence. Drive not thy beast with maddening goad!<br> Dismount; and to the rightful path safe lead him back,<br> Where guides abound,&#8212;experienced travellers dot the track.<br> Leave not thy beast; his rein loose not thou from thy hand.<br> His inclination is to wander o&#8217;er the land.<br> One moment only leave him carelessly to roam;<br> Towards the pastures he at once will rush, all foam. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_20">20</A></FONT></span><br> Thy beast is not a friend to travelling by the road.<br> How many muleteers through this have lost a load!<br> Know'st not the way? Observe which path thy beast would take,<br> And follow the reverse. Secure this will thee make.<br> "Consult thou them;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> but then, do not what they advise;<br> For he who them opposes not, to ruin hies.<br> Lend not thyself to lust and fancy's every wind;<br> For these are what lead men astray; to God's truth blind.</p>

<p>The Prophet said to &#8216;Al&#299;: "Cousin, list to me.<br> The 'Lion of the Truth'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> art thou; a hero. See!<br> Trust not too much, however, to thy courage, sole;<br> Confide, much rather, on God's aim to keep thee whole.<br> Put faith in aid from His divine, omniscient mind,<br> That never can be baffled by disputant blind.<br> His shadow on the earth is what keeps it in place;<br> His spirit, sunbird-like, soars in supernal space.<br> Were I to speak His praises until judgment day,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_30">30</A></FONT></span> No end, no interruption, would admit my say.<br> Himself He's veiled in man, as sun behind a cloud.<br> This seek to comprehend.

<p>God hath declared his hand is like the hand of God,<br> By saying: "God's right hand above all hands doth plod.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_40">40</A></FONT></span><br> God's hand it is that kills him; makes him living, too.<br> But what is living? The everlasting spirit. Lo!<br> Whoever journeys, now and then, this road alone,<br> The prayers of saints it is leads him to safety's zone.<br> A saint's protection is not less than angel's aid;<br> His help is God's right hand, when all is truly said.<br> Now, if an absent saint have such portentous power,<br> A present Teacher's honour sure must higher tower.<br> If for the absent tempting viands are prepared,<br> For present guests what may not largely be outshared? <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_45">45</A></FONT></span><br> The varlet who to serve his lord is present there,<br> Must rank before the absentee, for goodly fare.<br> Thus, having Teacher chosen, be not too thin-skinned,<br> Nor wishy-washy, to a muddy puddle kinned.<br> For every buffet, see thou do not umbrage take:<br> How can a mirror polished be, unless it bear a shake?"</p>  
<p>Hear now this pregnant tale narrators have preserved;<br> A practice it relates in Qazw&#299;n much observed:<br> Upon the breast, the arms, the bladebones, and the like,<br> With needle's point and indigo, tattooed designs they strike. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_50">50</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>A certain Qazw&#299;n bully to an artist hied,<br> To have a brave design imprinted on his hide.<br> The artist first inquired what pattern he'd select.<br> The man a lion rampant thought he must elect;<br> And said: "My luck resides in Leo,&#8212;lion-sign;<br> Depict thou then a lion, deep-blue stained, benign."<br> The artist then demanded where he'd wish it done;<br> Our man replied: "Between my bladebones it enthrone."</p>  
<p>The artist then began to ply his needles&#8217; train;<br> The Qazw&#299;n bully bellowed, smarting with the pain. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_55">55</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_m216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></A></p>  
<p>The artist he addressed: "Most clever man of skill,<br> Thou&#8217;lt drive me mad. What picture works me so much ill?"<br> Said he: "A lion's form is what thou didst enjoin."<br> "O yes!" replied the bully. "What part dost thou coin?"<br> The artist: "At the tail have I commenced this time."<br> Our man: "O never mind the tail, designer prime!<br> Your lion's tail has whacked me on my rump so hard,<br> That I've no power to breathe, nor such pain disregard.<br> Allow thy lion to remain without a tail;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_60">60</A></FONT></span> Thy needles have unnerved me with their sharp assail."</p>  
<p>The artist then began upon another part,<br> And worked his instruments. They soon induced new smart.<br> The patient screamed again: "What member limnest thou now?"<br> Our artist answered: "&#8217;Tis the lion's ear, I trow."<br> His man replied: "O leave him without ears this time;<br> An earless lion's not so bad. Cut short the rhyme."</p>  
<p>Anew the artist on a part assayed his hand.<br> Afresh the bully interfered, by pain unmanned.<br> "What part art now at work on? Say, my worthy friend!"<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_65">65</A></FONT></span> "O," said the artist, "now his body I append."<br> "Leave out his body!" gasped the suffering Qazw&#299;n man;<br> "The pain's unbearable. Make short work, as thou can."</p>  
<p>The artist now quite lost his wits, as well he might;<br> He scratched his head; sought how to mend his plight;<br> Dashed all his needles, indigo, design, to earth;<br> In anger saying: "What the plague's come now to birth?<br> A lion tailless, headless, bodiless, who's seen?<br> God such a lion ne&#8217;er created, sure, I ween!"</p>  
<p><a name="page_m217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 217</font></A></p>  
<p>Have patience, thou too, brother, with thy needle's smart.<br> So shalt thou &#8217;scape the sting of conscience in thy heart. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_70">70</A></FONT></span><br> They who have conquered,&#8212;freed themselves from body's thrall,<br> Are worshipped in the spheres, the sun, the moon, stars, all.<br> Whoever's killed pride's demon in his earthly frame,<br> The sun and clouds are slaves, to do his bidding, tame.<br> His heart can lessons give of flaming to the lamp;<br> The very sun not equals him in ardent vamp.<br> For God hath said, in speaking of the scorching sun,<br> These words: "It swerved from them."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> It had new course to run.</p>  
<p>The sharpest thorns are welcome, as the roseleaf soft,<br> To finite who to th&#8217; Infinite can soar aloft. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75">75</A></FONT></span><br> What signifies to glorify the Lord of heaven;<br> To humble self to dust; with meekness, pride to leaven?<br> What use to learn to formulate God's unity;<br> What use to bow one's self before. the Deity?<br> Wouldst shine as brilliantly in sight of all?<br> Annihilate thy darksome self, thy being's pall.<br> Let thy existence in God's essence be enrolled,<br> As copper in alchemist's bath is turned to gold.<br> Quit "I" and "We," which o&#8217;er thy heart exert control.<br> &#8217;Tis egotism, estranged from God, that clogs thy soul. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_80">80</A></FONT></span></p>
