<p align="center"><i>Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, Veled, Sult&#257;nu-&#8217;l-&#8216;Ulem&#257; (The Beauty of the Religion of Islam, Son, Sultan of the Doctors of the Law)</i>.</p>  <h4 align="center">1.</h4>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> king of Khur&#257;s&#257;n,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> &#8216;Al&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Muhammed, Khurrem-Sh&#257;h, uncle of Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Muhammed Kh&#8217;&#257;rezm-Sh&#257;h, and the proudest, as he was the most handsome man of his time, gave his daughter, Melika&#8217;i-Jih&#257;n (Queen of the World), as to the only man worthy of her, to Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Huseyn, el Khat&#299;b&#299;, of the race of Ab&#363;-Bekr.</p>  
<p>An ancestor of his was one of the original Muslim conquerors of Khur&#257;s&#257;n. He was himself very virtuous and learned, surrounded with numerous disciples. He had not married until then; which gave him many an anxious and self-accusing thought.</p>  
<p>He himself, the king, the king's daughter, and the king's Vaz&#299;r were all four warned in a dream by the Prince of the Apostles of God (Muhammed) that he should wed the princess; which was done. He was then thirty years old. In due course, nine months afterwards, a son was born to</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="green">p. 4</font></A></p>  
<p>him, and was named Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Muhammed. He is commonly mentioned as Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Veled.</p>  
<p>When adolescent, this latter was so extremely learned that the family of his mother wished to raise him to the throne as king; but this he utterly rejected.</p>  
<p>By the divine command, as conveyed in the selfsame night, and in an identical dream, to three hundred of the most learned men of the city of Balkh,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the capital of the kingdom, where he dwelt, those sage doctors unanimously conferred upon him the honorific title of Sult&#257;nu-&#8217;l-&#8216;Ulem&#257;, and they all became his disciples.</p>  
<p>Such are the names and titles by which he is more commonly mentioned; but he is also styled Mevl&#257;n&#257;yi Buzurg (the Greater or Elder Master). Many miracles and prodigies were attributed to him; and some men were found who conceived a jealousy at his growing reputation and influence.</p>  <h4 align="center">2.</h4>  
<p>In <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 605 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1208) he, Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Veled, began to preach against the innovations of the king and sundry of his courtiers, declaiming against the philosophers and rationalists, while he pressed all his hearers to study and practise the precepts of Isl&#257;m. Those courtiers maligned him with the king, calling him an intriguer who had designs on the throne. The king sent and made him an offer of the sovereignty, promising to retire elsewhere himself. Bah&#257; answered that he had no concern with earthly greatness, being a poor recluse; and that he would willingly leave the country, so as to remove from the king's mind all misgivings on his score.</p>  
<p>He accordingly quitted Balkh, with a suite of about forty souls, after delivering a public address in the great mosque before the king and people. In this address he foretold the advent of the Moguls to overturn the kingdom, possess the country, destroy Balkh, and drive out the king, who</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></A></p>  
<p>would then flee to the Roman land, and there at length be killed.</p>  
<p>So he left Balkh, as the prophet (Muhammed) had fled from Mekka to Med&#299;na. His son Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n was then five, and the elder brother, &#8216;Al&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, seven years old.</p>  
<p>The people everywhere on his road, hearing of his approach or forewarned in dreams of his coming, flocked to meet him and do him honour. Thus he drew near to Bagd&#257;d. Here he was met by the great Sheykh Shah&#257;bu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, &#8216;Umer, Suherverd&#299;, the most eminent man of the place, deputed by the Caliph Musta&#8216;zim to do him honour. He became the guest of the Sheykh.</p>  
<p>The Caliph sent him a present of three thousand sequins, but he declined the gift as being money unlawfully acquired. He also refused to visit the Caliph; but consented to preach in the great mosque after the noon service of worship on the following Friday, the Caliph being present. In his discourse he reproached the Caliph to his face with his evil course of life, and warned him of his approaching slaughter by the Moguls with great cruelty and ignominy. The Caliph again sent him rich presents in money, horses, and valuables, but he refused to accept them.</p>  
<p>Before Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n quitted Bagd&#257;d, intelligence was received there of the siege of Balkh, of its capture, and of its entire destruction, with its twelve thousand mosques, by the Mogul army of five hundred thousand men commanded by Jeng&#299;z in person (in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 608, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1211). Fourteen thousand copies of the Qur&#8217;&#257;n were destroyed, fifteen thousand students and professors of the law were slain, and two hundred thousand adult male inhabitants led out and shot to death with arrows.</p>  
<p>Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n went from Bagd&#257;d to Mekka,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> performed the greater pilgrimage there, proceeding thence to Damascus, and next to Malatia (Melitene, on the Upper Euphrates), where, in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 614 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1217), he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A></p>  
<p>heard of the death of Jeng&#299;z. The Selj&#363;q&#299; Sultan, &#8216;Al&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Keyqub&#257;d, was then sovereign of the land of Rome (R&#363;m, <i>i.e.</i>, Asia Minor), and was residing at S&#299;w&#257;s (Sebaste). In <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 620 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1223) Sultan Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, the dispossessed monarch of Kh&#8217;&#257;rezm (Chorasmia) was killed in a battle fought by him in Azerb&#257;yj&#257;n (Atropatene) against the Sultans of Rome, Syria, and Egypt, when his forces were totally defeated. And thus ended that great dynasty, after ruling about a hundred and forty years.</p>  
<p>Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n went from Malatia and remained four years near Erzinj&#257;n (the ancient Aziris, on the Western Euphrates), in Armenia, at a college built for him by a saintly lady, &#8216;Ismet Kh&#257;t&#363;n. She was the wife of the local sovereign, Melik Fakhru-&#8217;d-D&#299;n. She and her husband both died, and then Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n passed on to Larenda (in Cataonia), in Asia Minor, and remained there about seven years at the head of a college, the princess Melika'i-Jih&#257;n, his mother, being still with him.</p>  
<p>Here it was that his younger son, Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Muhammed, the future author of the Mesnev&#299;, attained to man's estate, being then eighteen years old; when, in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 623 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1226), he married a young lady named Gevher Kh&#257;t&#363;n, daughter of the Lala Sherefu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, of Samarqand. She gave birth in due course to Jel&#257;l's eldest son, &#8216;Al&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n.</p>  
<p>The king had now returned to his capital, Qonya (the ancient Iconium). Hearing of Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n's great learning and sanctity, the king sent and invited him to the capital, where he installed him in a college, and soon professed himself a disciple. Many miracles are related as having been worked at Qonya by Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, who at length died there on Friday, the 18th of Reb&#299;&#8216;u-&#8217;l-&#257;khir, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 628 (February <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1231). The Sultan erected a marble mausoleum over his tomb, on which this date is recorded. Many miracles continued to occur at this sanctuary. The Sultan died also a few years later, in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 634 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1236).</p>  
<p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></A></p>  
<p>(After the death of Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Veled, and the acquisition of still greater fame by his son Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, who received the honorific title of Khud&#257;vendg&#257;r&#8212;<i>Lord</i>&#8212;the father was distinguished from the son, among the disciples, by the customary title of Mevl&#257;n&#257; Buzurg&#8212;<i>the Greater or Elder Master</i>. The traditions collected by Efl&#257;k&#299;, relating to this period, vary considerably from one another on minor points of date and order of succession, though the main facts come out sufficiently clear.)</p>  <h4 align="center">3.</h4>  
<p>Jel&#257;l's son, Sultan Veled, related to Efl&#257;k&#299; that his father Jel&#257;l used frequently to say, "I and all my disciples will be under the protection of the <i>Great Master</i>, my father, on the day of resurrection; and under His guidance we shall enter the divine presence; God will pardon all of us for His sake."</p>  <h4 align="center">4.</h4>  
<p>It is related that when the <i>Great Master</i> departed this life, his son, Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, was fourteen years old. (This is apparently a copyist's error for "twenty-four." Jal&#257;l is said to have been born in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 604&#8212;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1207.) He married when seventeen (or eighteen); and often did he say in the presence of the congregation of his friends, "The <i>Great Master</i> will remain with me a few years. I shall be in need of Shemsu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n of Tebr&#299;z (the capital of Azerb&#257;yj&#257;n); for every prophet has had an Ab&#363;-Bekr, as Jesus had His apostles."</p>  <h4 align="center">5.</h4>  
<p>Shortly after the death of the Great Master Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Veled, news was received by the Sultan &#8216;Al&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n of Qonya of the arrival of Sultan Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Kh&#8217;&#257;rezm-Sh&#257;h on the borders of Asia Minor. The Sultan went and prayed at the tomb of the deceased saint, and then prepared to meet the Kh&#8217;&#257;rezmians, who were in the neighbourhood</p>  
<p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></A></p>  
<p>of Erzenu-&#8217;r-R&#363;m (Erzen of the Romans, the ancient Arzes, now Erzerum). Scouts brought in the intelligence that the Kh&#8217;&#257;rezmians were very numerous; and great anxiety prevailed among the Sultan's troops. He resolved to see for himself.</p>  
<p>He put on a disguise and set out with a few followers, on fleet horses, for the Kh&#8217;&#257;rezmian camp. They gave out that they were nomad Turks of the neighbourhood, their ancestors having come from the Oxus; that latterly the Sultan had withdrawn his favour from them; and that, in consequence, they had for some time past been looking for the Kh&#8217;&#257;rezmian advent. This was reported to the king, Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, who sent for them and received them kindly, giving them tents and assigning them rations.</p>  
<p>During the night King Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n began to reflect that every one had hitherto spoken well of Sultan &#8216;Al&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, and a doubt arose in his mind in consequence respecting the story of these newcomers, especially as he learned that the Sultan was on his march to meet him. Consulting with the Prince of Erzenu-&#8217;r-Ram, further perquisition was postponed until the morrow.</p>  
<p>But at midnight the deceased saint of Qonya, Bah&#257;-Veled, appeared in a dream to Sultan &#8216;Al&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, and warned him to fly at once. The Sultan awoke, found it was a dream, and went to sleep again. The saint now appeared a second time. The Sultan saw himself seated on his throne, and the saint coming to him, smiting him on the breast with his staff, and angrily saying, "Why sleepest thou? Arise!"</p>  
<p>Now the Sultan did arise, quietly called his people, saddled horses, and stole away out of the camp. Towards morning King Jel&#257;l caused guards to be placed round the tents of the strangers to watch them. But afterwards, when orders were given to bring them to the king's presence to be questioned, their tents were found to be empty. Pursuit was attempted, but in vain.</p>  
<p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></A></p>  
<p>After an interval the two armies came into collision. The Sultan of Qonya was victorious. From that time forward, whenever difficulties threatened, he always betook himself to the shrine of the saint, Bah&#257; Veled, who always answered his prayers.</p>  
<p>(As Sultan Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Kh&#8217;&#257;rezm-Sh&#257;h has already been stated to have died in battle in Azerb&#257;yj&#257;n in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1223, whereas the saint of Qonya did not die until <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1231, eight years afterwards, the discrepancy of that date with the present anecdote is irreconcilable.)</p>  <h4 align="center">6.</h4>  
<p>The Great Master, Bah&#257; Veled, used to say that while he himself lived no other teacher would be his equal, but that when his son, Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, should succeed him at his death, that son of his would equal and even surpass him:</p>  <h4 align="center">7.</h4>  
<p>Seyyid Burh&#257;nu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Term&#299;z&#299;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is related to have said that one night the door of the mausoleum of Bah&#257; Veled opened of itself, and that a great glory shone forth from it, which gradually filled his house, so that no shadow fell from anything. The glory then gradually filled the city in like manner, spreading thence over the whole face of nature. On beholding this prodigy the Seyyid swooned away.</p>  
<p>This vision is a sure indication that the whole human race will one day own themselves the disciples of the descendants of the great saint.</p>  <h4 align="center">8.</h4>  
<p>Before he quitted Balkh, Bah&#257; Veled one day saw a man performing his devotions in the great mosque in his shirt sleeves, with his coat upon his back. Bah&#257; reproved him, telling him to put on his coat properly and decently,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></A></p>  
<p>then to continue his devotions. "And what if I will not?" asked the man in a disdainful tone. "Thy dead-like soul will obey my command, quit thy body, and thou wilt die!" answered Bah&#257;. Instantly the man fell dead; and crowds flocked to become disciples to the saint who spoke with such power and authority.</p>  <h4 align="center">9.</h4>  
<p>When Sultan &#8216;Al&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n had fortified Qonya, he invited Bah&#257; Veled to mount to the terraced roof of the palace, thence to survey the walls and towers. After his inspection, Bah&#257; remarked to the Sultan, "Against torrents, and against the horsemen of the enemy, thou hast raised a goodly defence. But what protection hast thou built against those unseen arrows, the sighs and moans of the oppressed, which overleap a thousand walls and sweep whole worlds to destruction? Go to, now! strive to acquire the blessings of thy subjects. These are a stronghold, compared to which the walls and turrets of the strongest castles are as nothing."</p>  <h4 align="center">10.</h4>  
<p>On one occasion Sultan &#8216;Al&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n paid a visit to Bah&#257; Veled. In lieu of his hand the latter offered the tip of his staff to be kissed by the Sultan, who thought within himself: "The proud scholar!" Bah&#257; read the Sultan's thoughts as a seer, and remarked in reply thereto: "Mendicant students are bound to be humble and lowly. Not so a Sultan of the Faith who has attained to the utmost circumference of the orbit thereof, and revolves therein."</p>  <h4 align="center">11.</h4>  
<p>A certain Sheykh Hajj&#257;j, a disciple of Bah&#257; Veled and one of God's elect not known to the herd of mankind, quitted the college after the decease of his teacher, and betook himself to his former trade of a weaver, therewith</p>  
<p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></A></p>  
<p>to gain an honest livelihood. He used to buy the coarsest brown bread of unsifted flour, mash this up with water, and break his fast with this sop alone. All the rest of his earnings he saved up until they would reach to two or three hundred piastres. This sum he would then carry to the college, and place it in the shoes of his teacher's son, Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, the new rector. This practice he continued so long as he lived.</p>  
<p>At his death a professional washer was appointed to perform the last ablution for Sheykh Hajj&#257;j. In the execution of his office the washer was about to touch the privities of the deceased, when the defunct seized his hand with so strong a grip as to make him scream with pain and fright. The friends came to rescue him, but they were unable to release the imprisoned hand. They therefore sent word to Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n of what had occurred. He came and saw, knew the reason, and whispered into the ear of the deceased man: "The poor simpleton has been unaware of the high station of thy sanctity. Pardon his unintentional transgression for my sake." Immediately the poor washer's hand was released; but three days afterwards he was himself washed and borne lifeless to his grave.</p>  <h4 align="center">12.</h4>  
<p>The Sultan had a governor of his childhood still living, the Em&#299;r Bedru-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Guhert&#257;sh, commonly known as the Dizd&#257;r (Castellan), whom he held in great esteem. One day, as Bah&#257; Veled was lecturing in the mosque, in presence of the Sultan and his court, he suddenly called upon the Dizd&#257;r to recite any ten verses of the Qur&#8217;&#257;n, saying he would then expound them to the congregation. The Dizd&#257;r had been admiring the eloquence of the preacher's expositions. Upon this sudden call, without the slightest hesitation and without ever having committed them to memory, he recited the first ten verses of chapter xxiii., "The believers have attained to prosperity," &amp;c., which</p>  
<p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Bah&#257; forthwith explained in such a manner as to draw down the plaudits of the assembly. The Dizd&#257;r, with the Sultan's permission, went to the foot of the pulpit and declared himself a disciple to Bah&#257;. "Then," said the preacher, "as a thank-offering for this happy event, do thou build and endow a college where my descendants shall teach their disciples after me." The Dizd&#257;r did so, and richly endowed it. This is the college where Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n afterwards lived. When the Dizd&#257;r died he left all his possessions to enrich the foundation. (See chap. iii. No. 69.)</p>  <h4 align="center">13.</h4>  
<p>The Sultan had a dream (something like one of Nebuchadnezzar's). He saw himself with a head of gold, a breast of silver, a belly of brass, thighs of lead, and shanks of tin. Bah&#257; Veled explained the dream as follows:&#8212;"All will go well in the kingdom during thy lifetime. It will be as silver in the days of thy son; as brass in the next generation, when the rabble will get the upper hand. Troubles will thicken during the next reign; and after that the kingdom of Rome will go to ruin, the house of Selj&#363;q will come to an end, and unknown upstarts will seize the reins of government."</p>
