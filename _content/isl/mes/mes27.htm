<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> kings of yore a custom had, so I've been told,<br> Of course thou&#8217;st heard it;&#8212;must remember it, of old,<br> On their left hand their champions took their usual place;<br> Because the heart is on the left of body's space.<br> Their chancellor and scribes stood on their right hand all;<br> In that the writer's art to the right hand doth fall.<br> Before their face the holy teachers stood erect,&#8212;<br> The mirrors of the soul;&#8212;than mirror more correct.<br> Their breasts they've polished with the acts of thought and praise,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span> That, mirror-like, they catch each image facts may raise.<br> Each object born in nature with a lovely mien<br> Should always have a mirror set to catch its sheen.<br> A beauteous face enamoured is with mirror's glance;<br> Heart's piety's the polish best the soul can chance.</p>  
<p>A friend of tried sincerity came from afar,<br> And guest became with trusty Joseph;&#8212;free from bar.<br> They had been friends before, in childhood's artless days;<br> Had leant their elbows on one cushion, in their ways.</p>  
<p>His brethren's envy and wrong-dealing touched upon,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_10">10</A></FONT></span> Said Joseph: "&#8217;Twas a chain. It bound a lion. &#8217;Non!<br> Disgrace affects not lions, if with chains they're bound.<br> With God's decree I quarrel not;&#8212;it's always sound.</p>  
<p><a name="page_m229"><font size="1" color="green">p. 229</font></A></p>  
<p>A lion with a chain around his lordly neck,<br> Is still the lord of them who forged the chain as check."<br> The friend asked: "How wert, in the well, the prison, cast?"<br> Said Joseph: "As the moon in wane and change at last."</p>  
<p>At change, the new moon's bent in two, a poor weak thing,<br> But ripens to the full apace, night's matchless king.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Pearls in a mortar pounded are, by chance, sometimes;<br> Still, they're esteemed a joy to glad eyes in all climes. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_15">15</A></FONT></span><br> Then, grains of wheat are cast into the lowly earth;<br> But golden ears thence spring, a source of glee and mirth.<br> These, too, are ground to dust in mill;&#8212;vile as to show;<br> Increased in value, thence, bread it becomes, we know.<br> Again &#8217;tis crushed between the teeth; to chyme it turns,<br> And feeds the mind, the thoughts, the soul;&#8212;in wisdom burns.<br> The soul, in turn, is subject to the stress of love;<br> New miracles, as seen, "the sowers marvel "&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> prove.<br> But truce to these reflections; let us follow now<br> The words of Joseph's friend. &#8217;Tis worth while these to know. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_20">20</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>That conversation closed, said Joseph to his guest:<br> "What gift, my friend, hast brought in token of thy zest?"</p>  
<p>To go with empty hands and visit friends long missed,<br> Is like a man who goes to mill without his grist.<br> E&#8217;en God will ask His creatures in the judgment day:<br> "What offerings have you brought to meet your Maker? Say!<br> Alone, and empty-handed? Is it thus you come?<br> E&#8217;en as We first created you? Gifts left at home?'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p>What have you brought as timely offerings in your hands?<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_25">25</A></FONT></span> What are the gifts with which you'd grace your new life's lands?<br> Or, was it that you'd no belief in this return?<br> Our promise of this day by you was laughed to scorn?<br> If you denied thus the hope to be My guest,<br> Then dust and ashes wait you in My realm, at best.<br> If you did not deny it, whence your empty hands?<br> How come you to a friend's gate, scorning just demands?"</p>  
<p>Put by a little from thy daily meat and drink,<br> So shalt thou have a store for offerings&#8217; binding link.<br> "Sleep little" when thou art of those "who lay them down."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_30">30</A></FONT></span> "Of mornings," be of them who "ask for pardon's crown."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> Give signs of life, though slight;&#8212;as babes do in the womb;<br> So may God grant thee inward light to cheer thy tomb.<br> And when thou &#8217;scapest from dark and narrow prison there,<br> Then mayst thou soar from earth beyond the realms of air.<br> "The spacious land of God" &#8217;tis named in holy writ,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> The land to which the prophets all have gladly flit.<br> The heart is never lonesome in that vast abode;<br> Its green trees never wither, frosts no leaves corrode.<br> If now thou load thyself with sensual burden's weight,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_35">35</A></FONT></span> Fatigued and jaded, faint thou&#8217;lt prove beneath their freight.</p>  
<p>In sleep thou bearest no burden; borne thou art, instead.<br> Fatigue is thence recruited;&#8212;strength regains its head.<br> Know then, thy sleep's a foretaste of what is to come,<br> From the rapt state of saints arriving at their home.<br> The saints were well prefigured by the "Sleepers Seven."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><br> "Their sleep," "their stretchings," "their awaking," lead to heaven.</p>

<p>Without the least exertion on their parts by acts,<br> The "right and left-hand registers" draw them by facts.<br> The "right-hand register" &#8217;s the record of good deeds;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> The "left-hand register" &#8217;s the list of fleshly greeds.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_40">40</A></FONT></span><br> But both of these abolished are in case of saints.<br> To them such things are but as echo dies and faints.<br> Though good and evil may their echoes round thee peal,<br> The echoing mountain hears them not in the ordeal.</p>  
<p>Now Joseph once again inquired: "What offering bringest?"<br> His friend, ashamed of urgent pressing, sighed. Thou singest?<br> Said he: "Full many offerings have I sought and seen;<br> But none was worthy of thee; or I much misween.<br> How could I bring a diamond to its native mine;<br> Or add a drop of water to a sea of brine? <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_45">45</A></FONT></span><br> Shall I to K&#257;sh&#257;n cummin bring, whence it is drawn,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> By offering up my life and soul to beauty's fawn?<br> I know no rarity that's not surpassed by thee;<br> Thy loveliness the rarity men nowhere see.<br> The fittest present, then, I've found, a mirror is.<br> And this I've brought; unsullied, bright, refulgent &#8217;tis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_348"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><br> Therein thou&#8217;lt contemplate thy beauteous, matchless face,<br> As beaming as the sun that decorates sky's space.<br> A mirror have I brought, thou charming, witching one;<br> In it admire thyself; and think of me, when gone." <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_50">50</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>The mirror now he drew from underneath his skirt.<br> A mirror is, to beauty, with attractions girt.<br> In non-existence&#8217; mirror if existence gleams,<br> Present this mirror to it, thou, as best beseems.<br> In non-existence mirrored, being we may see;<br> As wealthy men their wealth may show by beggars&#8217; glee.</p>

<p>The hungry man's the mirror best shows what is bread.<br> And tinder mirrors flint and steel's gleam, quickly spread.<br> Wherever want, defect, is seen, beauty's most prized.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_55">55</A></FONT></span> The mirror of perfection's then best realised.</p>  
<p>If clothes grew, ready cut and sewn, to meet our needs,<br> Where'd be the use of tailor's art, to fashion weeds?<br> The unhewn trunk is needed, for the carver's skill,<br> And carpenter, to cut out thence his frames, his thill.<br> The surgeon hastens to the couch where suffering lies;<br> Where limbs are broken, there his bandages he ties.<br> Were there no patient, malady, no fever, ache,<br> Could art sublime, the medical, its marvels make?<br> If humble brass and copper were not to be found,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_60">60</A></FONT></span> Th&#8217; alchemist's stone could not to gold transmute them round.<br> Defect is thus the mirror whence perfection's seen;<br> And vileness is the foil to show off grandeur's sheen.<br> By contrast does each opposite its fellow show,<br> Sweet honey by sharp vinegar we best can know.<br> The man who sees and feels his imperfections sore,<br> Exerts himself to cure them quickly. all the more.<br> And he'll ne&#8217;er take his flight towards heaven's eternal King,<br> Who holds at heart the thought that he's a perfect thing.</p>  
<p>No worse disease exists, to taint the human mind,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_65">65</A></FONT></span> Than self-conceit, that paints its owner gold refined.<br> How many bitter tears has not the vain to shed,<br> Ere arrogance can be expelled, and pride be dead!<br> The malady of Satan,&#8212;self-conceit:&#8212;"I'm best,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_350"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Exists in germ in every panting human breast.<br> These fancy they have mortified themselves throughout.<br> Take them to be pure streams; their filth seek in the grout.</p>
