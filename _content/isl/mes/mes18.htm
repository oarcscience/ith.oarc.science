<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A certain</span> Jewish King, in savage, brutal scenes,<br> From hate of Jesus, persecuted Nazarenes.<br> &#8217;Twas Jesu's age, when he the Gospel first did teach;<br> In Jesus, Moses, and in Moses, Jesus preach.</p>  
<p>That King God made squint-eyed; things straight he could not see.<br> A King and squint-eyed? Ah! that one the two should be!</p>  
<p>A master once a squint-eyed slave commanded so:<br> "Come here; that bottle from its shelf, go, fetch me; go."<br> The squint-eye straightway asked: "Which, master, of the two?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> The case explain; clear up the doubt, and truly show." <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span><br> His master answered: "Two there's not; there is but one;<br> Put off thy strabism; with stupidity have done."<br> "Good master," quoth he, "chide me not; &#8217;tis nature's fault."<br> The master quick rejoined: "Look now; break one; halt! halt!"<br> As soon as one was broken, both were gone from sight.<br> Poor squint-eye nearly lost his wits in childish fright.</p>

<p>There was but one; his eyes were cause that he saw two.<br> The one away, the other consequently was gone too.</p>  
<p>Desire or rage, at times, makes people double see.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_10">10</A></FONT></span> The mind's distortion brings the eyes perverse to be.<br> From passion's mists our reason ever blinded lies.<br> The heart its clouds sends up; the mind's eye's vision flies.<br> The judge to taking bribes who basely bends himself,<br> Can never well discern the right and wrong, from pelf.<br> Our King through Israelitish rancour grew so blind,<br> A s nothing to distinguish in his rage of mind.<br> By thousands, faithful seekers of God's will he slew.<br> "Vouchsafe us help, O God of Moses, Jesus too!"</p>  
<p>He had a Vaz&#299;r, brigandlike for craft and force.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_15">15</A></FONT></span> In knavish stratagems he had no peer; of course.<br> He whispered to the King: "These Christians, as in hives,<br> All keep their faith a mystery, to save their lives.<br> To kill them thus is profitless. Give breathing-time,<br> Religion can't be smelt out just like musk or thyme.<br> A secret &#8217;tis, well wrapped in many folds of guile.<br> In outward show, as friends, perfidiously they smile."<br> The King, with grimace fierce: "What have we then to do?<br> What remedy proposest thou to make them rue?<br> I will not leave alive one Christian in the land,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_20">20</A></FONT></span> Whose faith is shown to all, or in his bosom banned."</p>  
<p>The Vaz&#299;r to him: "King, my hands and ears cut off;<br> My nose and lips the same. Give orders; let them scoff.<br> Unto the gallows send me; I'll of all be seen.<br> Then let an intercessor plead,&#8212;some prince,&#8212;your queen.<br> Let all this happen where some spacious public place<br> May let all see, that all may know of my disgrace.</p>

<p>Then drive me forth; away from thee in exile sent;<br> And they'll receive me, under feint of sorrow bent.<br> 'In secret,' I'll pretend, 'a Christian I'm at heart;<br> Call God to witness how my faith has worked my hurt. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_25">25</A></FONT></span><br> The King a knowledge gained of zeal in me that burned;<br> Its flame to put out quite, his anger on me turned.<br> I strove to hide my faith, my leaning to keep hid;<br> Affected still to be, think, act, just as he bid.<br> Suspicion crossed his mind; my secret he espied;<br> All I could plead for nothing went; he said I lied.<br> "Thy specious words," quoth he, "are needles in a loaf;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> My eye, as through a glass, sees all thy thoughts; thou oaf!<br> No curtain of thy trickeries can veil thy faith from me;<br> I'm proof against thy knaveries; thy cunning I can see." <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_30">30</A></FONT></span><br> Were not the faith of Jesus the refuge of my heart,<br> He'd not have mutilated me in this sad sort.<br> For love of Jesus, head and life I will lay down;<br> All persecution suffer to gain a martyr's crown.<br> My life I will not grudge to lose for Jesus&#8217; sake.<br> His faith I hold from point to point without mistake.<br> I dread his doctrine's fall to uninstructed guides.<br> The truth from their bad teaching still to ruin glides.<br> Thanks be to God, to Jesus thanks, who me have made<br> A teacher perfect of the faith so free from shade. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_35">35</A></FONT></span><br> The Jew and Judaism I have forsworn in sooth;<br> About my loins the sacred cord&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I wear; &#8217;tis truth.<br> This age the age of Jesus is; O men, give ear!<br> His doctrine take to heart; nought else have you to fear."</p>  
<p>The Vaz&#299;r having laid this plot before the King,<br> All shame and scruple vanished; &#8217;twas a perfect thing.</p>

<p>In presence of the public, nose, ears were cut off.<br> The rabble wondered greatly; now's the time to scoff.<br> He fled unto the Christians; begged them him to hear;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_40">40</A></FONT></span> And straightway set up preaching; saintlike was he there.</p>  
<p>The Christians soon with one accord accepted him,<br> In multitudes they round him flocked, all meek and prim.<br> The Gospel's holy words, the prayer, the cord, he'd preach;<br> The mysteries of all of these to them he'd teach.<br> To outward view a guide to sanctity was he;<br> In very truth, a trap and fowler's whistle; see.<br> Of such effect his wiles, disciples were deceived;<br> From Jesu's teaching fell, and in this cheat believed.<br> It is so. Often does the flesh, for selfish end,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_45">45</A></FONT></span> Intrude itself across the soul's most fervent trend.<br> Meek virtue was not what they sought to gain the most;<br> Of him they learned to ferret out new sins, and boast.<br> Hair-splitting casuists, point by point they sin dissect;<br> They grow too wise; &#8217;twixt rose and garlic links detect.<br> Of such avail's the subtle cunning of these men,<br> That honest teachers oft are made to swerve by them.</p>  
<p>The Christian folk in him their confidence thus place.<br> Gregarious, like sheep, &#8217;s the mob of every race.<br> A gen&#8217;ral favourite was he; all loved him well;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_50">50</A></FONT></span> Christ's vicar called they him; as who the truth could tell.<br> This cursed Antichrist, so full of fraud and wile!<br> Grant help, O God! &#8217;Tis Thou alone canst curb such guile.<br> The devil's snares are spread abroad in tempting guise,<br> Their baits are various; we, like birds, shut fast our eyes.<br> If saved from one, another tempts; we thither stray;<br> Like hawks and eagles, heinous sins make us their prey.<br> Thou shieldest us, O gracious God! But ever still,<br> With froward hearts and minds we counteract Thy will.</p>

<p>How many sparks of fire from flint and steel have flown!<br> How many hearts, like tinder, make those sparks their own!<br> But in the dark some thief his finger presses there;<br> And ev&#8217;ry train puts out that has been lighted here.<br> Extinguished if those sparks were not, a flame would rise;<br> A burning light be kindled, flashing &#8217;yond the skies.<br> A thousand snares are laid to catch our tripping feet;<br> But, Lord, if us Thou shield, harm never shall us meet. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_65">65</A></FONT></span><br> If but Thy grace will guide us, lead us on our way,<br> No thief can steal our peace of mind, our light of day.</p>

<p>Within his cell ensconced, the Vaz&#299;r answer gave:<br> "Disciples mine, my firm resolve from me receive.<br> To me a very strict commandment Jesus spake:<br> 'From friends and kin of every class seclusion seek.<br> Thy face set tow&#8217;rds a wall; sit in some cell apart,<br> Forsake thyself; forgetfulness cast o&#8217;er thy heart.'<br> Permission's thus denied with men to hold discourse.<br> I've naught to say; with mortals more I'll not converse.<br> Good-bye, my friends!

<p>The legion-captains now he called to him apart;<br> But one by one, in secret, counsels to impart.<br> To ev&#8217;ry one he said: "Successor thee I name,<br> The faith of Jesus to uphold and keep from shame.<br> All other captains thy commands will have to hear;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_340">340</A></FONT></span> &#8217;Tis Jesus thus appoints thee others&#8217; loads to bear.<br> Should any one against thee neck rebellious raise,<br> Him kill, imprison, or in exile end his days.<br> But while I live divulge not what to thee I've told,<br> Keep secret till my death this charge thou hast to hold.<br> Let no one know till then &#8217;tis thou art chosen out,<br> Proclaim not thou thyself a king or prince devout.<br> Behold this scroll; take, study it; thyself instruct,<br> &#8217;Tis Jesu's doctrine pure; from this His Church construct."</p>

<p>He named them each successor; made them so to feel.<br> Whate&#8217;er he told to one, to each did he reveal.<br> He gave to each a volume, writ from end to end;<br> No two alike; each different, and hard to blend.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Their doctrines various, of every changing hue;<br> Diverse in sense, as objects' forms exposed to view.<br> Their precepts and commands a very maze of guile,<br> Their sentiments impossible to reconcile.</p>  
<p>The Vaz&#299;r now delayed another forty days;<br> Then slew himself,&#8212;set free his soul from earth's affrays. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_350">350</A></FONT></span><br> The people, hearing of his death, were sorely grieved;<br> Around his corpse collected; eyes, ears, scarce believed.<br> With many bitter moans to sorrow they gave vent;<br> Their breasts they beat, their hair they tore, their clothing rent.<br> To count their multitudes is in God's power alone;<br> Turks, Arabs, Kurds, and Romans,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> men of every zone.<br> They scattered o&#8217;er their heads the dust from his last home;<br> To mourn for him was balm, all ills to overcome.<br> They wept.

<p>A month of mourning past, the people sought to know<br> Whom he'd appointed in his place their way to show.<br> Whom must we recognise successor to our saint?<br> Into whose hands commit the task of our restraint?</p>

<p>With pleasure I'd this matter clearer put, and joy.<br> But tender consciences I seek not to annoy.<br> Abstruser points there are, as keen as sword in fight.<br> If reason's shield thou hast not, refuge take in flight. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_380">380</A></FONT></span><br> My arguments contest not, unless well prepared.<br> Sharp blade will cut; it pities not; no life is spared.<br> I sheathe my sword of argument,&#8212;will not make assault.<br> Lest muddlers read me wrong, and say &#8217;tis I'm at fault.</p>
