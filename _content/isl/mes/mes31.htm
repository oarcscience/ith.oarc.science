<p>FROM &#8216;Al&#299; may we learn sincerity of meeds.<br> "God's Lion" we may hold free from all gross misdeeds.<br> In fight he'd conquered one who'd earned a hero's crown.<br> His sword he'd swiftly raised, his victim to hew down.<br> That champion spat in &#8216;Al&#299;'s face, to mark disdain;<br> The face of one, the Prophet's pride, all saints&#8217; chieftain.<br> He spat upon a face to which the moon bowed low,<br> And offered adoration in the temple's show.</p>  
<p>That instant &#8216;Al&#299; dropped his sword, high poised in air,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span> And left the spitter harmless;&#8212;action debonnair.<br> This raised the foe's astonishment; called forth his awe.<br> That pardon, that forgiveness, grew not from war's law.</p>  
<p>He said to &#8216;Al&#299;: "Thou thy sword hadst raised to slay.<br> Why hast thou dropt it now,&#8212;prolonged my forfeit day?<br> What hast thou seen, surpassing prowess of my arm,<br> That thus thou hast repented,&#8212;left me free from harm?<br> What may it be has calmed the fury of thy breast,<br> Which as the lightning gleamed, and, straightway sank to rest?<br> What didst thou see, that, by reflection on me cast,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_10">10</A></FONT></span> A spark has leapt to life in my despairing breast?<br> What was thy vision, far above the world of fact,<br> Than life far sweeter, whence my life receives new pact?</p>

<p>For bravery, 'God's Lion' art thou justly named.<br> For kindness, I now know, thou art too little famed.<br> For generosity, thou&#8217;rt Moses&#8217; cloud divine,<br> From which poured forth the quails and manna, as from mine!"</p>  
<p>The clouds rain wheat. Man, then, by labour and by skill,<br> Reduces this to food, when finely ground in mill.<br> But Moses&#8217; cloud, more generous far, with open hand,<br> Sent down in plenty food prepared, by God's command. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_15">15</A></FONT></span><br> For them who ate at Providence's table, free,<br> God's mercy was displayed;&#8212;a banner all could see.<br> For forty years that daily bread&#8212;abounding grace&#8212;<br> Failed not.
