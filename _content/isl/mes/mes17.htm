<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">An</span> oilman there was, who a parrot possessed,<br> Soft-voiced, and green-coated; could talk with the best.<br> The oilshop her charge when the man was away;<br> The customers coaxed she the whole live-long day.<br> Her speech was quite human, her words full of sense,<br> In all parrot-tricks she was void of offence.</p>  
<p>One day the man popped out, on bus&#8217;ness intent;<br> The parrot, as usual, had charge while he went.<br> A cat, as it chanced, of a mouse in full chase<br> Bounced into the shop. This poor Poll could not face. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span><br> From perch away flew she; took refuge on shelf;<br> Some jars she knocked over; the oil spread itself.</p>  
<p>The master returning, first sat himself down,<br> As lord of the manor; the shop was his own.<br> The oil-pools he spied, and then Polly's wet coat;<br> A blow on the head made her feathers drop out.</p>  
<p>In silence some days Polly brooded, from grief;<br> The oilman's bereft of his wits, to be brief.<br> He plucked at his beard; he heaved a deep sigh;<br> "Alas!" then, he shrieked out, "day's darkened on high <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_10">10</A></FONT></span><br> My hand, would it withered had, ere I'd struck Poll;<br> I've silenced her prattle that always was droll!"</p>  
<p><a name="page_m20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></A></p>  
<p>His alms now he showers on each passing scamp,<br> In hopes Poll her chatter &#8217;d get back by some tramp.<br> Three days and three nights in this guise did he pass,<br> Despair at his heart, like a lorn lovesick lass;<br> Incessantly sobbing and sighing, his word<br> Was: "Pray now, will speech e&#8217;er return to my bird?"</p>  
<p>A bare-headed mendicant happened to pass;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_15">15</A></FONT></span> Whose scalp was close shaved, smooth and shining as glass.<br> At once our Poll-parrot her silence forswore,<br> Screamed after the mendicant: "Poor head! Sore! Sore!<br> Old bald-pate! old bald-pate! What is it thou&#8217;st done?<br> Upset some one's oil jar? The oil is&#8217;t all gone?"<br> The passers-by smiled all at Polly's mistake,<br> &#8217;Tween bald-head and bare-head no diff&#8217;rence to make.</p>  
<p>So thou, my dear friend, think thyself not a saint;<br> A quean to a queen bears resemblance, but faint.<br> Mankind on this point in great error still stands;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_20">20</A></FONT></span> Th&#8217; elect of the Lord are ignored on all hands.<br> The equals of prophets acknowledged they be;<br> Of saints they're the brethren, as all men agree.<br> Fools say: "The elect are but human, you see;<br> To eat and to sleep they're constrained, just as we."</p>  
<p>Through blindness they miss the real point of the strife,<br> The diff&#8217;rence between them's immense all through life.<br> The wasp and the bee eat and drink from the fields;<br> The one stings, the other sweet honey still yields.<br> The deer of both sorts browse the same mountain's side;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_25">25</A></FONT></span> The one gives rich musk; dung the other; go, hide.<br> The canes of two species in one land may grow;<br> Quite empty that one; from this, sugar will flow.<br> By thousands, examples of pairs thus are known,<br> Which differ as much as does cheese from the moon.</p>

<p>Our bread, in one case, turns to dirt in our meat;<br> Another produces the mind, God's own seat.<br> His food the one man swells with envy and greed;<br> By like means another gains virtue indeed.<br> One soil is productive; one barren and salt;<br> One angel's in heaven; the other's at fault. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_30">30</A></FONT></span><br> In form, many pairs may appear as though one,<br> Clear water is sometimes as hard as a stone.<br> Excepting the taster by practice, who knows<br> The wholesome from unwholesome water that flows?</p>  
<p>Supposing saints&#8217; miracles tricks, magic-wrought,<br> They fancy them both the result of deep thought.<br> Magicians, at bidding of Pharaoh, did cast<br> Their wands down, to Moses&#8217; rod as a repast.<br> From his rod to their wands a chasm there must be;<br> From his act to theirs we an interval see. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_35">35</A></FONT></span><br> God's curse on their witchcraft and devilish art!<br> His blessing on Moses, who chose the best part!</p>

<p>No virtue in mere words or letters is found;<br> "Believer" &#8217;s a word in itself but a sound.<br> If "Hypocrite!" cast in their teeth be at last,<br> As scorpion's sting to their souls it clings fast.<br> If "Hypocrite" &#8217;s name be not product of hell,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_50">50</A></FONT></span> So bitter at all times why does its sound tell?<br> This name's great repulsion is not in its form;<br> The bitter it smacks of is not from a corm.<br> The word's but a vase; &#8217;tis its sense is the wine;<br> The sense of a book in the title may shine.</p>

His epistle began: "Musaylama, the Apostle of God, to Mohammed, the Apostle of God." Mohammed's answer commenced with: "Muhammed, the Apostle of God, to Musaylama the liar." He was eventually defeated and slain in battle, in the eleventh year of the Hijra after Mohammed's decease; when all Arabia submitted to Isl&#257;m. He was killed by Wahshi, the Ethiopian slave who, in the battle of &#8217;Uhud, had formerly driven the self-same javelin through the body of Hamza, Mohammed's uncle. Wahshi lived long after these events, in Syria. He used to say that, as a pagan, he had slain one of the best of men, and, as a Muslim, one of the worst. When Mekka was taken, he was proscribed; but he got away safely. Not long afterwards, he made his submission, and Muhammed forgave him, as he did others in analogous circumstances.</P>
