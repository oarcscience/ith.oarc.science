<P><A NAME="fn_54"></A><A HREF="mes15.htm#fr_55">m1:1</A> The reed-flute is the sacred musical instrument of the Mevlev&#299; dervishes, commonly known as the Dancing Dervishes, from their peculiar religious waltz to the sound of the reed-flute, &amp;c., with outstretched arms and inclined head, in their special public services of commemoration. They love the reed-flute as the symbol of a sighing absent lover.</P>
