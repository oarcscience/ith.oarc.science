<p>HAST heard, perchance, there was in days of good &#8216;Umer<br> A minstrel talented, whose harpings moved the sphere?<br> The nightingales all wept in transports at his voice,<br> One pleasure made men's hearts a hundredfold rejoice.<br> His song enchanted every gathering where he went,<br> Applause as thunder broke forth, to his heart's content.<br> Like voice of Isr&#257;f&#299;l, whose trump on judgment day,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Will wake the dead to life, his made the saddest gay.<br> Dear friend to Isr&#257;f&#299;l he was, and mendicant;<br> His notes made plumes to sprout on hide of elephant. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>Some day will Isr&#257;f&#299;l attention pay to moans.<br> Their souls he will recall to old and putrid bones.<br> The prophets, likewise, all, musicians are on hearts.<br> Disciples hence expire with joy by fits and starts.<br> Our outward ears the strains hear not which thence proceed;<br> Those ears, in many ways, degraded are indeed.</p>  
<p>Mankind the songs of fairies never hear at all,<br> They are not versed in fairies&#8217; ways, their voices small.</p>

Who holds the rod?</p>  
<p>The inward hymn that's sung by all the hearts of saints<br> Commences: "O component parts of that thing <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">not</span>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> Now since they take their rise in this <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">not</span>, negative,<br> They put aside the hollow phantom where we live.</p>

<p>The saints are Isr&#257;f&#299;ls of this our passing time.<br> The spiritually dead through them live life sublime.<br> Our souls mere corpses are; their graves, our bodies&#8217; crowds.<br> At voice of saint do they arise, clothed in their shrouds.<br> They say: "This voice has in it something to be feared.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_20">20</A></FONT></span> To raise the dead, God's voice alone has power, we've heard.<br> We were all dead, and unto earth had we returned.<br> The voice of God we've heard; our prisons we have spurned."</p>  
<p>The voice of God without, also within the vail,<br> Can give the gift to all, it gave to Mary: "Hail!"<br> O ye whose death was not that which attacks the flesh,<br> At sound of the Beloved's voice ye&#8217;ve risen afresh.</p>

<p>That voice the Bridegroom's voice most truly was, &#8217;tis said,<br> Although &#8217;twas from the lips of His servant, Ahmed.<br> God said to him: "Thy tongue, thy eye, thy ear, I am;<br> All thy contentment, anger, thoughts, &#8217;tis I undam. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_25">25</A></FONT></span><br> Go on; 'By Me he hears, by Me he sees;' that's thee;<br> Thou art the head; thou holdest the place of Head's trustee.<br> In ecstasy, since thou art 'He the Lord's who is,'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> I will be thine; for see, &#8217;tis said: 'The Lord is his.'<br> Now will I say to thee: 'Thou art;' and now; 'I am.'<br> What I may say's as clear as is the sun in heaven.<br> Wherever I may shine an instant in a lamp,<br> A world of doubts I solve; on all My seal I stamp.<br> The darkness which the sun could never yet illume,<br> By magic of My breath grows bright as peacock's plume. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_30">30</A></FONT></span><br> Wherever gloom may reign as undisturbed night,<br> When shone upon by Me, like noonday's forthwith bright."</p>

<p>Seek light as listest; whether from the moon or sun.<br> The moon derives her sheen from daystar's golden tun.<br> Imbibe what light thou canst from any twinkling star.<br> The Prophet said: "Stars are all my disciples."

<p>He further said: "How happy they who see my face,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_251"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> And happy they who look on them in their own place."<br> He said: "Good luck to all who have the happy chance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> To look on my disciples,&#8212;mirrors of my glance."<br> If thou by taper's aid proceed to light a lamp,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_40">40</A></FONT></span> The eye that sees its light, perceives the taper's stamp.<br> If one lamp from another should be lighted; well!<br> The light received from this, has come from that one's cell.<br> And so, if through a thousand wicks the light should pass,<br> Who sees the last enjoys the gift of all the mass.<br> The light of this last lamp's as pure as is the whole;<br> No difference is there. And thus &#8217;tis with the soul.<br> The light diffused by teachers in these latter days,<br> No other is than what was shown by earlier rays.</p>  
<p>Our Prophet said: "The breathings of the Lord your God,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_254"></A><A HREF="#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_45">45</A></FONT></span> In these your days of pilgrimage, on all sides prod.<br> Your ears and minds lend ye to all signs of the times;<br> Perchance ye may inhale those breathings in these climes."</p>  
<p>One breathing came and found you. Straightway it was gone.<br> To all who sought, new life it gave. It then had done.<br> Another breathing's come. Be ye not unprepared.<br> Ye may not let it go by. Something must be shared.<br> It found your souls on fire. &#8217;Tis thence they cease to burn.<br> Your souls it found all corpses.

<p>One breathing from the Lord, when blown on earth and air,<br> Ill qualities converts straight into all that's fair.<br> For fear lest any breathing such as this thee shake,<br> Read thou the text: "They shunned the task to undertake."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_255"></A><A HREF="#fn_254"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Had not " they shrunk from it," where now would&#8217;st thou have been?<br> Had they not feared, would&#8217;st thou this grade have ever seen?<br> But yesterday an opening gleamed for better things;<br> Till greed for fleshly morsels stopped the way of kings. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_55">55</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>For sake of some such morsel Luqm&#257;n was made bail.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> The time's now that for Luqm&#257;n morsel&#8217;d not avail.<br> The troubles we endure are all for morsel's sake.<br> Be Luqm&#257;n.

<p>Thorn-eating camel, truly, is this world of ours,<br> Ahmed, then, came and mounted;&#8212;him that camel bears.<br> O camel, on thy back thou bearest a vase of rose.<br> On thee from thence have sprouted rosebuds, as God knows.<br> Thy tastes thee lead to camel-thorn and wastes of sand.<br> To thee the thorn's a rose; the wilderness, rich land.</p>  
<p>O thou who in such quest hast wandered up and down,<br> How long wilt thou contend rose-garden's sandy down?</p>

<p>Now Ahmed came; a tender, kind companion, he.<br> "Speak to me, O Humayr&#257;," said he, "speak to me."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Put thou thy shoe, Humayr&#257;, quick into the fire.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> The rocks will rubies turn, from his feet's blood in mire.<br> This Humayr&#257;'s a woman's name, the poet's love.<br> Such is the Arab custom.

<p>If thou&#8217;rt made sweet through sugar, it may happen still,<br> That sugar none thou find, to sweeten thee at will.<br> But if thou sweet become, like sugar, through good heart,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75">75</A></FONT></span> This sweetness from thy sugar never will depart.</p>

<p>Good &#8216;&#256;&#8217;isha, the gem of honour's casket wide,<br> Then asked the Prophet (who's of both the worlds the Pride): <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_160">160</A></FONT></span><br> "O thou who of all creatures every essence art,<br> What was the reason rain this day has played its part?<br> Was it a rain of mercy, such as sometimes falls;<br> Or was it as a menace justice fitly calls?<br> Was it a vernal rain, dispensing benefits;<br> Or was it an autumnal shower, to dig grave pits?"</p>  
<p>He answered: "&#8217;Twas a sprinkle, sent to soothe our care,&#8212;<br> That fruit inherited by all who Adam share.<br> Should man remain exposed for long to care's fierce flame,<br> &#8217;Twould work him wrack and ruin, crush his mortal frame." <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_165">165</A></FONT></span></p>

<p>Our minstrel in old age felt poverty's sure pinch.<br> No money could he earn; bread, not enough for finch.<br> He prayed: "O God, long life and full to me Thou&#8217;st given,<br> To worthless sinner Thou hast shown foretaste of heaven.<br> I've slighted Thy commandments seventy years and more,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_185">185</A></FONT></span> Not one day hast Thou let me pangs of want feel sore.<br> No longer can I earn; I'm now Thy household guest;<br> I'll harp for love of Thee, Thou giver of my feast."</p>

<p>Thought he: "This cannot be my quest." So, off again<br> He wandered; still no other offered; this was plain.<br> He said within himself: "The Lord of servant spake,<br> Devout, approved, accepted, loved for God's own sake.<br> An ancient minstrel this.

<p>Now &#8216;Umer him considered; saw he was afraid;<br> His cheeks all pale and wan; looks, modest as a maid;<br> Then said: "Fear not!

<p>A torrent, now, of tears, he shed, in anguish deep;<br> His harp then dashed to pieces.

<p>To him then &#8216;Umer: "This contrition deep of thine<br> Is proof thou sober art, though grief thy heart entwine.<br> Thy worldly journey's over, other path now take;<br> For this sobriety's a sin thou must forsake.<br> Sobriety's a virtue in the road thou&#8217;st trod.<br> The past and future both are curtains hiding God.<br> Set fire to both of them! How long wilt thou remain<br> Partitioned up by diaphragms like a reed cane?<br> So long as reed has diaphragms, it's not our friend;<br> With lips and voice of ours its notes it cannot blend. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_310">310</A></FONT></span><br> So long as thou goest round the house, thou waverer art;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> But when thou&#8217;st entered, then full ease reigns in thy heart.<br> O thou, whose knowledge of full knowledge is not half,<br> Contrition is, with thee, worse than thy fault, mooncalf.<br> Thou&#8217;rt contrite for the past. On what occasion<br> Wilt thou contrition feel for this contrition?<br> At one time worshipper thou wert of notes of harp;<br> And now, like lover, thou &#8217;dst kiss sighs and moans so sharp."</p>  
<p>Like mirror, &#8216;Umer having thus reflected truth,<br> The harper's heart received enlightenment, forsooth. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_315">315</A></FONT></span><br> He, spirit-like, became relieved of moan and smile.<br> His old mind took its leave, his new heart was docile.<br> Amazement fell upon him, stupor bathed each sense,<br> Ecstatic trance then followed, earth and sky flew hence.<br> A yearning and a longing past description.<br> As I cannot explain; try thy perception.<br> Such ecstasy, such words, beyond all mood and tense;<br> Immersion total in God's glorious effulgence.</p>

<p>Immersion such, escape therefrom impossible;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_320">320</A></FONT></span> That sea henceforth to him became impassable.</p>  
<p>Our partial wisdom's not part of omniscience,<br> Until God's promptings come its promptings to enhance.<br> But when our souls are made those impulses to feel,<br> That sea in waves straight rises, under which we reel.</p>  
<p>The story of the harper and his state now ends;<br> Both harper and that state have grown to be our friends.<br> The harper sealed his mouth from any further song.<br> We, too, will leave his tale half told; it is too long.</p>  
<p>In order to attain to his high state of bliss,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_325">325</A></FONT></span> Had one a hundred lives, they might be staked for this.<br> Be thou, then, like a falcon, ever on the wing,<br> To catch that gnat, thy soul; sunlike, for ever sing.<br> He casts himself, for love, from highest heaven's height;<br> If flagons empty, he with wine fills them, so bright.</p>  
<p>O spiritual Sun, transfuse Thou life to all.<br> A new life give, O God, to this our earthly ball.<br> Into the frames of men both life and soul infuse<br> From out Thy hidden world, as water dost diffuse.</p>  
<p>The Prophet has informed us that, for warning's sake,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_330">330</A></FONT></span> Two angels evermore sweet invocation make:<br> "O God, dispensers bless! Do Thou them feed and tend!<br> Give them ten thousandfold for every mite they spend!<br> But hoarders, O our Lord God, in this lower scene,<br> Do Thou afflict with loss,&#8212;no profit intervene!"</p>  
<p>How many hoardings better than dispensings are!<br> Save in God's service, wealth of God spend not. Take care!<br> So mayst thou get in recompense a hundredfold.<br> So mayst thou &#8217;scape the punishment of sins untold.</p>

<p>Just like the unjust steward, who, as justice due,<br> The treasure of his lord bestowed on rebel crew.<br> He falsely pictured to himself he'd justice wrought,<br> With public money spent, the poor to terms he'd brought. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_340">340</A></FONT></span><br> Such justice from such culprit, what could it effect?<br> His lord, to anger moved, excuses did reject.</p>
