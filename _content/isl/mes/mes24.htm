<p>Pretenders carry famine in their heart of hearts.<br> We suffer only want of bread for our repasts.<br> Why, then, pretender-like, should we our want disguise?<br> Why, for appearance' sake, our soul, too, bastardise?</p>

<p>"All those anxieties that fall on us like darts,<br> Are but the vapours, tempests, of our human hearts.<br> Those cares are like a sickle, made to cut us down.<br> This is a fact, though we are slow the truth to own.<br> Our ev&#8217;ry suffering, here, a portion is of death.<br> This part of death, then, drive away whilst thou hast breath.<br> If from this part of death thou findst thou canst not run;<br> Thou&#8217;rt sure whole death will follow, as the light the sun.<br> If thou canst learn to think this part of death is sweet,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_55">55</A></FONT></span> Thou knowest that God will make its whole thy tastes to meet.</p>

<p>The verdure's beauty infinite is, as a part;<br> The cooing of the dove's as infinite, in logic art.<br> But go we not too far afield for sorts and kinds;<br> Or poor disciples ne&#8217;er will slake their thirsting minds.</p>

<p>The prime of remedies is abstinence, we know.<br> And scratching irritates the itch;&#8212;as leeches show.<br> Of treatment medical the base is abstinence.<br> Therefore be abstinent. Show strength of mind and sense.<br> Accept my counsel.

<p>If, like some thorns, his stem display no single rose,<br> That springtide will prove fatal to his safe repose.<br> But he that blooms from head to foot with righteous deeds,<br> With joy shall welcome spring's awakening of those meads.</p>  
<p>The useless thorn desires the nipping wintry blast,<br> To lay all low and simplify the flowery vast;<br> That so, all beauty cloaked, all squalor hid, the same,<br> All glorious hues, all hideous sights, be rendered tame.<br> The leaf's fall to such thorn more grateful is than spring;<br> The ruby and the flint are one in tithesman's ring. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_685">685</A></FONT></span><br> True, that the gardener's eye in winter knows the thorn;<br> But what is one eye's scrutiny to general scorn!</p>  
<p>The vulgar public is, as &#8217;twere, one witless wight;<br> Each star's a clipping of the moon, in its fond sight.<br> Not so great men of wisdom, radiant with troth,<br> They shout with joy: "Good tidings! Spring breaks into growth!"</p>  
<p>Unless the flowers blossom on the fertile trees,<br> How can the fruit be gathered, honey store the bees?<br> The flowers blow and fade; the fruit begins to swell.<br> So, when our bodies die, our souls in glory dwell. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_690">690</A></FONT></span><br> The fruit's reality; the flower is but a sign;<br> The flower's the harbinger; the fruit, the true design.<br> The flower blown and past, the fruit then comes in sight;<br> The first must perish ere the other can see light.<br> Unless a loaf be broke, no nutriment it yields;<br> Until the grapes are crushed, no cup of wine man wields.<br> So drugs, to prove a solace to the sufferer's ache,<br> Together must be blended, rolled in one smooth cake. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_691">691</A></FONT></span></p>
