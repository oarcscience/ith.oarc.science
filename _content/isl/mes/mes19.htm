<p>The truth doth shed a shining light on human souls,<br> Received by heaven's favourites, in special ghostly strolls.<br> Illumined with that light, as spangles deck a bride,<br> They turn their souls to God, contemning all beside.<br> Who feels not keenly love's great soul-compelling might,<br> Is portionless of spangles from truth's flashing light.</p>

<p>Though not herself, to save her infant, she'd bow down.<br> But lo! a miracle! The babe cried: "Let alone!<br> Uninjured am I here. Come in. Be not dismayed.<br> &#8217;Tis cool and pleasant.

<p>Come in; come in! All of you, saints of God, elect!<br> Resigned ones!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Faith's cup of martyrdom select!<br> Come in!

<p>Thus loudly cried the infant from its bed of flame.<br> Th&#8217; assembled crowds all heard it. All were seized with shame.<br> A sudden holy impulse urged them to obey.<br> In crowds those men and women cast their lives away.<br> No force was needed;&#8212;no compulsion;&#8212;all was love;<br> For bitterness is sweet to all whom love doth move.<br> To such a point it came that guards and soldiers, all,<br> Were fain to cry: "Withhold! The fire is more than full!"</p>  
<p>The Jewish king at sight of all this love and zeal,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75">75</A></FONT></span> Was shamed,&#8212;was thunderstruck; his wicked heart did reel.<br> He saw that faith can give the lover's ardent flame.<br> Self-sacrifice is naught in true devotion's name.<br> Thank God! Beelzebub was conquered in that Jew.<br> Thank God! &#8217;Twas Satan's self these darksome deeds did rue.<br> The shame he sought to bring upon the cheeks of some,<br> A hundredfold was heaped on his own head at home.<br> He thought from others&#8217; shame the veiling leaf to tear;<br> He saw them safe, his own foul nakedness laid bare.</p>  
<p>A ribald fellow once, by lewdest mob sustained,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_80">80</A></FONT></span> Called railing out on Ahmed. Wry his mouth remained.<br> He then came begging pity, in the Prophet's trace:<br> "Forgive, Muhammed, who&#8217;rt endued with wisdom's grace.<br> For want of knowing better, insolent I was.<br> &#8217;Tis I that merit scorn and mockery. Alas!"</p>

<p>When God decides to humble any sinner, proud,<br> A demon stirs this last t&#8217; insult some man of God.<br> And he whom God elects to cloak where &#8217;tis he halts,<br> Has grace bestowed on him to cover others&#8217; faults.<br> Should favour from the Lord in mercy reach a man,<br> Humility is given him; to pray &#8217;s part of his plan. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_85">85</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>How blessed are the eyes that smart with sorrow's brine!<br> How blessed is the heart inflamed with love divine!<br> Contrition's tears are ever hallowed by heaven's smile.<br> The latter end of all things man should scan awhile.<br> Wherever water flows, the fields are fresh and green.<br> Tears followed are by grace;&#8212;as all the prophets ween.<br> Then imitate the water-wheel, that groans and weeps.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> By prayers, and moans, and tears, a man his heart pure keeps.<br> Wouldst thou shed tears?

<p>The Jewish king reproached the fire: "O raging thing!<br> Thy all-destructive might, where is it? Where's thy sting?<br> If thou wilt not consume, what quality hast thou?<br> Or has my fortune veered; and with it, thy dread glow?<br> Thou sparest not thy worshippers, the Magian race.<br> Whence comes it; these who spurn thee, Christians, meet with grace?<br> Thou never wast, O fire, for patience noted here.<br> Why burn&#8217;st thou not?

<p>Bewitched thee have they? Or is&#8217;t magic natural?<br> Or is&#8217;t my fortune wills that thou turn prodigal?"</p>  
<p>To him the fire: "O miscreant! I'm still the same.<br> Come in and try, thou, how thou&#8217;lt find my smallest flame.<br> My nature, as my substance, has not suffered change.<br> Outside my nature's limit I've no power to range.<br> At door of Turkman's tent the savage household dogs<br> Do wag their tails before a guest, and crouch like logs.<br> But should a stranger pass by, near the guarded tent,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100">100</A></FONT></span> Him then those dogs assail, with lion-like intent.<br> Less than a dog I'm not, in service to my Lord.<br> Than Turkman less, there's none, in rights, upon earth's sward."</p>  
<p>When fire thy body injures, and inflicts some harm;<br> Remember, its consuming power can also warm.<br> And when a fire thus serves thee, acts some needful part,<br> Reflect! Those qualities thou seest did God impart.<br> Art injured, &#8217;haps? Fall down; entreat the Lord with prayer.<br> The hurtful power was given by Him in gracious care.<br> Should He so will, each injury a blessing is.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_105">105</A></FONT></span> Chained captives find their freedom by a word of His.</p>  
<p>Fire, air, earth, water, all are servants of their God.<br> I, thou, them lifeless deem.

<p>One means comes from another means; and cause from cause.<br> Without a means or cause, no means from self e&#8217;er rose.<br> The means by which all prophets&#8217; miracles are wrought,<br> Of higher order are than earthly means; no doubt.<br> Man's mind can compass how these latter act, and when;<br> The former hidden are from all but prophet's ken.<br> These former &#8217;tis that give the latter power to act;<br> And rarely, that, their normal action, counteract.</p>  
<p>A means a rope is, by the help of which we reach;<br> And in this worldly pit by means each reaches each. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_115">115</A></FONT></span><br> Around its coiling cylinder the well-rope's wound.<br> To shut our eyes to this would blind indeed be found.<br> The ropes by means of which results are seen to steer,<br> In this our world, deem not they're moved by star or sphere;<br> Lest thou become confused and giddy like a wheel;&#8212;<br> Take fire, consume, like tinder, sparks of shame to feel.</p>  
<p>The air becomes a fire at times by God's decree.<br> Both air and fire run wild with joy, His means to be.<br> The streams of mercy, the consuming fires of wrath,<br> Thou&#8217;lt see, my son, are both from God.

<p>Shayb&#257;n the shepherd, too, a circle round his fold<br> Was used to draw; whate&#8217;er the season, hot or cold;<br> On Fridays, when, at midday's sacred hour of praise,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_125">125</A></FONT></span> He to a congregation hied; lest wolf should seize.<br> No wolf was ever known to break the holy spell;<br> Nor sheep to stray beyond; each knew the limit well.</p>

<p>The Jewish king now manifested great surprise.<br> These things, he said, were mockeries, mere patent lies.<br> His councillors conjured him more sedate to be;<br> And not to push his hardihood to rash degree.</p>

<p>Each man will turn his eyes in hope towards the place,<br> Where he has tasted joy some former day of grace.<br> The pleasures of each kind are most with their own kin;<br> As part must share with whole its qualities, its sin.<br> Things needs must be assigned unto a common class,<br> If aught they have in common; two will form a race.<br> Thus bread and water are not human at the first;<br> But human they become, through hunger and through thirst.<br> In form they have no tie with us of human kind;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_160">160</A></FONT></span> But through a special link they kindred with us find.</p>  
<p>If pleasure, then, we find in what's not of our race,<br> Be sure there's some connection through which this takes place.<br> If that connection but resemblance be in shape,<br> It will not last; it's for a time; it must escape.</p>  
<p>&#8217;Tis true that birds find pleasure in a whistle's note;<br> But then they fancy &#8217;tis their mate's, on whom they dote.<br> And if a thirsty man take pleasure in his wine,<br> He tastes the lees, and loathes. To water he'll incline.<br> A pauper may amused be with counterfeited coin;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_165">165</A></FONT></span> But take this to the mint; defaced &#8217;twill be, in fine.<br> Then be not thou misled with gilded counterfeit;<br> Delusion will thee plunge headlong into hell's pit.</p>
