<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Great</span> Princes all! We've killed our dread external foe.<br> Within us, still, a worse than he remains, I trow.<br> To slay this inner foe is not the task of mind;<br> Our moral lion's not destroyed by tricks refined.</p>  
<p>Our flesh, a hell; that hell a fiery dragon is.<br> Whole oceans can't extinguish those fierce flames of his.<br> Earth's seven oceans all were lost within his maw;<br> His raging fires would still burn high, to mankind's awe.<br> Pitcoal, hard-hearted miscreants; these are its food;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> They sink within it, miserable, abject brood. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span><br> Withal, its craving hunger ne&#8217;er will be appeased,<br> Until the voice of God cry unto it: "Art eased?"<br> "Eased?" will it answer; "No; not yet awhile by far;<br> Behold my flame, my fury,&#8212;burning, fiery roar."<br> It swallows down a universe in its fell mood;<br> And instantly shrieks out: "More food!

<p>The foot of God alone can stamp out hell's alarms.<br> Who else but God supreme to bend such bow has arms?<br> Straight arrows serve alone to be shot from a bow;<br> But lust's distorted spring shoots crooked arrows too.<br> Be thou in mind upright as arrow straight for bow.<br> A bow will not shoot straight, unless the arrow's so.</p>  
<p>We've fought our fight and conquered in our outward strife.<br> Now turn we our attention to the inner life.<br> We've done with outer warfare, lesser as it is;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_15">15</A></FONT></span> And as the Prophet, wage the greater warfare, his.<br> We put our trust in God; from Him we ask for aid;<br> With His assistance faith can move a mountain staid.<br> To rout an armed foe is nothing very fresh;<br> A lion true is he who conquers his own flesh.<br> To illustrate this truth, give ear unto a tale,<br> That thou of these few words the moral mayest inhale.</p>

<p>He sought for &#8216;Umer with redoubled zeal and zest;<br> But in so doing lost his horse, and eke his chest.<br> He wandered everywhere to seek the Caliph out.<br> Like one distracted asked each passer-by his route.<br> "Is&#8217;t possible," he said, "that such a man there be,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_40">40</A></FONT></span> When like the soul to sight invisible is he?"</p>  
<p>He sought for him as though he &#8217;d been his truant slave,<br> But: "He who seeks shall find" &#8217;s a very well-known stave.<br> A desert-Arab woman saw he at the last,<br> Who told him &#8216;Umer, then, beneath date-palm slept fast.<br> Beneath a date-palm! Far from mankind's busy plod.<br> That date-palm's shadow shaded the Shadow of God!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>He went towards the tree; a station took afar;<br> He saw &#8216;Umer; a fit of trembling showed his fear.<br> On that ambassador did awe and dread alight.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_45">45</A></FONT></span> While o&#8217;er his heart there stole a sense of sweet delight.<br> Two feelings, love and dread, by nature opposites,<br> Were mingled in his bosom by some occult rites.<br> He thought within himself: "I've many princes seen;<br> In sovereign presence I have ever welcome been.<br> This fit of awe and trembling's very strange to me;<br> And yet without dismay this man I cannot see.<br> I've been in forests where the lions make their lair;<br> I've met them face to face; yet knew not what was fear.<br> In battle I've been, oft; in thickest of the fight.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_50">50</A></FONT></span> My arm's upheld our cause, when in most desperate plight.<br> Wounds have I dealt, received, that threatened life to take,<br> Among the brave, the bravest; my heart knew no quake.<br> This man is weaponless, supine upon the ground.<br> Why then this tremor? It my every limb has bound.<br> A ghostly awe is this; it's not a mortal fear.<br> Most certainly it's not a dread of this man here.</p>

<p>He who fears God has admonition of the Lord;<br> Both men and demons stand in awe of his mere word."<br> Mute he remained in reverential attitude,<br> Till &#8216;Umer woke from his trance of beatitude. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_55">55</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>Profound obeisance and grave salutation made,<br> As said the Prophet: "First, salute; then, embassade."<br> The Caliph answered: "And on thee be peace! Draw near;"<br> Assured him of protection; bade him put off fear.<br> "Fear not" a word of comfort is to trembling soul;<br> A generous tribute &#8217;tis, when strong with weak condole.<br> Men set at ease the object whom they wish to raise,&#8212;<br> Relieve his heart from palpitation; bid fears cease.<br> But unto one who feals no dread how say: "Fear not "?<br> What lesson's this thou givest to one whose lesson's got? <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_60">60</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>So &#8216;Umer put at ease that much perturbed man;<br> And calmed his wavering mind, as noble hearts best can.<br> To him he then addressed some subtle words of sense,<br> Set forth the attributes of God,&#8212;man's best defence,<br> Declared the goodness of the Lord to all who trust<br> In Him alone; the rank they gain in trance combust.</p>  
<p>Saint's ecstasy springs from a glimpse of God, his pride.<br> His station's that of intimate. He's bridegroom; God is bride.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> A bride's veiled graces are not seen by groom alone;<br> Her unveiled charms solely to him in private shown. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_65">65</A></FONT></span><br> In state she first appears before the people all;<br> Her veil removed, the groom alone is at her call.<br> Entranced are many Gnostic worshippers, I ween;<br> Few gain admission to the presence-chamber scene.</p>

<p>&#8216;Umer told all the stations passed through by his soul;&#8212;<br> Its flights, fights, tribulations, ere it was made whole.<br> He spoke of times when flight of time's of no account;<br> Of Holiness's station, glorious to recount.<br> He talked of atmospheres in which his righteous soul<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_70">70</A></FONT></span> Had soared to seek fresh conquests of devotion's whole.<br> Its every flight had been beyond th&#8217; horizon scant;<br> Beyond the hope, or e&#8217;en desire, of aspirant.</p>  
<p>He found a willing list&#8217;ner in the stranger guest,<br> Whose mind was framed t&#8217; investigate such mysteries blest.<br> The teacher was perfection; novice full of zeal;<br> Like clever jockey on a steed with lightning heel.<br> He found his scholar apt, of great capacity.<br> So good seed sowed in fertile soil sagacity.</p>  
<p>Th&#8217; ambassador now asked: "Of true believers Prince!<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75">75</A></FONT></span> How can a soul from heaven come down to earth's province;&#8212;<br> How can so great a bird be cooped up in a cage?"</p>  
<p>He answered: "God speaks words of power, most sage.<br> Those words, addressed to nothings without eyes or ears,<br> Set them in motion. Like a ferment, fruit it bears.<br> Those words no sooner spoken, quick those nothings all<br> In motion put themselves, and reach existence&#8217; hall.<br> Or He commands these beings, creatures of His own;<br> And they return to nothing, whence He them had drawn.<br> He speaks unto the flowers; they forthwith burst in bloom.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_80">80</A></FONT></span> His voice the flint hears; lo, it's a cornelian stone.<br> A spell He laid on matter; spirit it became.<br> By charm from Him the sun sprang forth, a lambent flame.<br> If He but whisper words of awe, the sun again<br> Is seized with darkness of eclipse, like night amain.<br> What is&#8217;t He says, by which the teeming eye of cloud<br> Sheds forth its tears, as drops from water-skin unsewed?</p>

<p>What incantation to the earth addresses He,<br> To make it produce cattle,&#8212;whose hides used may be?<br> The hesitations of each puzzled child of thought<br> Arise from some enigma by which God's him caught. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_85">85</A></FONT></span><br> On horns of a dilemma is he fixed, poor man.<br> 'Shall I do this,' says he, 'when &#8217;ts opposite I can?'<br> From God, too, is the power to make selection's choice<br> Of two solutions. One is taken, through inward voice.<br> Wouldst thou be always free from hesitation, fool?<br> Stuff not thy mind's ear tight with doubt's dull cotton-wool;<br> That thou mayst solve the riddles God may set for thee;&#8212;<br> That thou mayst understand the full of mercy free.<br> Then shall thy heart receive His inspiration's gift,&#8212;<br> A power of speaking from an inward impulse&#8217; drift. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_90">90</A></FONT></span><br> The ear and eye of soul are organs not of sense;<br> The ears of sense and mind are not like soul's, intense.<br> The word "<i>compulsion</i>" puts me out of humour quite.<br> Who hath not love of God, compulsion's slave's, by right.<br> This union's based on truth (compulsion is too proud);<br> It is a glimpse of sunshine breaking through a cloud.<br> Be it compulsion. Man's compulsion it is not;&#8212;<br> Not the compulsion of browbeating from a sot.<br> Compulsion's felt by them, my very worthy friend,<br> Whose eyes of faith, ope&#8217;d in their hearts, on God attend. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_95">95</A></FONT></span><br> The absent and the future patent are to them;<br> To speak about the past is what they most contemn.<br> Election and compulsion, theirs, are not the same.<br> As dewdrops in the oyster-shell rare pearls became.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Outside, they're dewdrops, solely, whether great or small;<br> Inside they're pearls of price, whose value knows no fall.<br> Such men by nature are just like the musk-deer's pod;<br> It's fed with blood of artery, musk it yields, through God.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar's ambassador no sooner &#8216;Umer heard,<br> Than light broke on his heart; at which he stroked his beard.<br> All questions and all answers from his mind went quite;<br> All sense of right and wrong had vanished front his sight. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_145">145</A></FONT></span><br> He'd found the source; what need, then, of the streams?<br> To gather further wisdom, pondering on the means,<br> He said: "&#8216;Umer, pray tell me what's the end and use<br> Of shutting up that thing of light in darkness&#8217; house?<br> How can clear water be expected from black mud?<br> Why then is the pure soul combined with flesh and blood?"<br> He answered: "Most important question hast thou raised.<br> A sense, a spirit, by the letter paraphrased.<br> The free, the jocund spirit prisoner thou&#8217;st made;<br> As though the mind, the air, could into letter fade. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_150">150</A></FONT></span><br> Thou hast done this for explanation's sake,&#8212;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Thou, who beyond the explanation place wouldst take.<br> How should the man in whom the explanation's gleamed,<br> Not yet distinguish what's to me so clearly beamed?<br> Ten thousand explanations are there, each of which<br> Is most momentous,&#8212;than ten thousand others, rich.<br> With that, thy speech, now compoundly particular,<br> A universal explanation were,&#8212;no bar.<br> Thou art a partial,&#8212;seekest explanation still;<br> Why set thyself, then, to deny th&#8217; universal? <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_155">155</A></FONT></span><br> Unless thy speech contain some use, propound it not;<br> And if it have, objection quit; give what thou&#8217;st got.</p>

<p>Thanks are incumbent upon every mortal's head;<br> Contention and sour looks are surely no one's bread.<br> If to put on sour looks, of thankfulness sign be,<br> Then vinegar the sweetest-spoken thing we'd see.<br> If vinegar desire to hearts a way to find,<br> It oxymel becomes, with honey sweet combined.<br> True, verse is not best vehicle for sense abstract.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_160">160</A></FONT></span> It's like a sling; one's never certain how &#8217;t will act."</p>  
<p>Th&#8217; ambassador his senses lost with this one cup<br> Of wine spiritual. His mission he gave up.<br> O&#8217;erwhelmed with wonder at the power of God, he fell.<br> He came ambassador; now sovereign was, as well.</p>  
<p>A river overflooded constitutes a lake.<br> Some grains, when sown in earth, a field of corn can make.<br> When eaten, bread assimilated is by man,<br> That bread inanimate takes life, and reason can.<br> When wood or candle is made victim unto fire,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_165">165</A></FONT></span> Its substance dark becomes a source of light entire.<br> Black <i>stibium</i>, a stone, when placed in human eye,<br> Expands the power of vision, objects can descry.<br> Good luck to him who's saved from his own fleshly self,<br> And has become a parcel of some living elf.<br> Alas for him, who, living, sits among the dead.<br> He's dead himself, his life from out of him has fled.</p>  
<p>If thou take refuge in the Qur&#8217;&#257;n, God's own book,<br> With spirit of Muhammed thou&#8217;lt soon exchange look.<br> The Qur&#8217;&#257;n is the essence of all prophets right.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_170">170</A></FONT></span> They were the whales who swam in ocean of God's might.<br> If thou canst read or not, the Qur&#8217;&#257;n take to heart,<br> The saints and prophets study; they were as thou art.<br> Read thou it carefully; read, mark, digest its tales;<br> Thy soul, like bird in cage, will long to break its rails.</p>

<p>The bird shut up, imprisoned in a little cage,<br> That seeks not to get out, is ignorant, not sage.</p>  
<p>The souls who've freed themselves from cages of the flesh,<br> Are worthy fellow-travellers with prophets, fresh.<br> Their voices they lift up, religion to impart:<br> "The way of sure deliverance is here. Take heart! <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_175">175</A></FONT></span><br> Religion hath us saved from fleshly cages, sure.<br> No other way is there, salvation to secure.<br> You then upon yourselves will chastisements inflict,<br> That you may be delivered from the world's respect."</p>  
<p>Respect of mortal man a heavy fetter is;<br> Within religion's path the gravest bond is this.<br> Consider well this tale, ingenuous young friend; <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_179">179</A></FONT></span><br> &#8217;Twill teach thee many lessons may thy morals mend.</p>
