<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Give</span> ear to this advice from one who's well informed:<br> "Lay down your head where&#8217;er by wine you've been transformed."<br> Whene&#8217;er a drunken man reels forth from tavern door,<br> A laughing-stock he's made by urchin and by boor.<br> Now here, now there, he lurches, stumbling on his road;<br> Falls in the mire; is mocked and jeered, scorned as a toad.<br> The children of the neighbourhood his steps surround,<br> Unconscious what is wine's hilarity profound.</p>  
<p>So are all people children, round the saints of God;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span> None adults are, save they who've cast off passion's clod.<br> &#8217;Twas said: "The world's a toy, a plaything; and men all<br> Are infants."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> These are God's words. True in sense they fall.<br> No child but loves his toys, his playthings, games, and sports;<br> By cultivation of the mind man sense imports.</p>  
<p>Man's love for worldly things is like child's love for toys;<br> The child and man, in these, repeat each other's joys.<br> The child, in play, performs the very selfsame part,<br> He'll act when grown a hero, learnt debating art.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_m249"><font size="1" color="green">p. 249</font></A></p>  
<p>Men's quarrels are the same as those fought out by boys;<br> They're senseless, reasonless; they squabble for mere toys. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_10">10</A></FONT></span><br> Their weapons are but wooden swords, as used in play;<br> Their objects are not worth a thought, by night or day.<br> They mount their hobby-horses, ride about on sticks;<br> Declaring &#8217;tis Bucephalus, Eclipse, that kicks.<br> &#8217;Tis they who bear a burden, pack-horse-like, or ass;<br> Their vanity converts them into horsemen's mass.</p>  
<p>So let it be till that day when God's riders shall,<br> On steeds of fire, transcend the seventh heaven's rolling ball.<br> "The spirit and the angels mount unto their God."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> The spheres shall shake, when under saintly footsteps trod. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_15">15</A></FONT></span><br> Whereas the raff of mankind mount their own coat-tails;<br> Imagining they're horsemen, prancing as ship sails.</p>  
<p>The Lord hath said: "Imagining's of no avail."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> Imagination's steed to scale heaven's heights must fail.<br> Imagination's best is but a choice of doubts;<br> Man ne&#8217;er disputes about the sun, whate&#8217;er the whim he flouts.<br> The time will come, he'll see what wretched screw he rides;<br> That which he deemed a courser's but his own shanks&#8217; sides.<br> His senses, thoughts, and reasonings, he then will find,<br> Are but the infant's hobby, pa's cane, more refined. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_20">20</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>The wisdom of the saints is what bears them aloft.<br> The science of the worldly is their load;&#8212;how oft!<br> The wisdom of the heart sustains and elevates;<br> But knowledge sensuously acquired as burden rates.<br> &#8217;Tis God hath said: "An ass with volumes for his load."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> So knowledge is a burden, when not of God's code.</p>

<p>All science not received from word of God direct,<br> Hath no endurance; paint it is; our eyes detect.</p>  
<p>Still, if man bear his burden well, he's recompensed;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_25">25</A></FONT></span> His burden is removed; ease to him is dispensed.<br> See, then, you bear not science' load from fleshly lust;<br> Lest you should suffer inwardly fatigue,&#8212;disgust;<br> But mount the agile steed of sacred lore divine;<br> So shall the burden on your back at once decline.<br> Unless you drink His cup, how &#8217;scape from fleshly lust?<br> O you, who, in His name, content are with the Just!<br> When from His name and attributes some inkling's born,<br> This inkling points the road to union one fair morn.<br> Thou&#8217;st never known a guide, but some one must be led;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_30">30</A></FONT></span> And when no road is travelled, gnome can't dog man's tread.<br> Thou&#8217;st never heard a name, but indicates a thing;<br> A flower thou&#8217;st never plucked from verbal <i>rosa's</i> ding.<br> Hast thou pronounced a name? Straightway the thing ensue.<br> The moon seek in the sky;&#8212;not in lake-waters, blue.<br> But wouldst thou cast aside all names and words, as vain,<br> Thyself, then, purge of self. Abstraction thou shalt gain.<br> Wouldst be a sword? Cast off soft iron's yield refined;<br> By discipline the mirror burnish of thy mind.<br> Discharge thyself of every particle of self;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_35">35</A></FONT></span> So shalt thou see thyself pure, free from soil of pelf.<br> Within thy heart thou&#8217;st see the wisdom of the saints,<br> Without a book, a teacher, or professor's plaints.</p>  
<p>The Prophet said: "That man is one of my true flock,<br> Whose heart and mind are hewn from my own calling's rock.<br> His soul perceives me through the selfsame holy light<br> That unto me reveals his soul serenely bright.<br> Reports, traditions, chains of evidence, are lost;<br> When soul communes with soul, minds freely can accost."</p>

<p>This riddle solve: "A Kurd I last night was, by birth;<br> And then, this morning, Arab am, by afterbirth."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_40">40</A></FONT></span><br> If one, sincere, a Kurdish boor was overnight,<br> Sincerity an Arab made him by daylight.<br> Example seekest of science springing in the heart?<br> This contest heed of Chinaman and Roman's art.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_374"></A><A HREF="#fn_373"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The Chinese urged they had the greater painter's skill.<br> The Romans pleaded they of art the throne did fill.<br> The sovereign heard them both; decreed a contest fair;<br> Results the palm should give the worthiest of the pair.</p>  
<p>The parties twain a wordy war waged in debate;<br> The Romans&#8217; show of science did predominate. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_45">45</A></FONT></span><br> The Chinamen then asked to have a house assigned<br> For their especial use; and one for Rome designed,<br> Th&#8217; allotted houses stood on either side one street;<br> In one the Chinese, one the Roman, artists meet.</p>  
<p>The Chinese asked a hundred paints for their art's use;<br> The sovereign his resources would not them refuse.<br> Each morning from the treasury rich colours&#8217; store<br> Was served out to the Chinese till they asked no more.<br> The Romans argued: "Colour or design is vain;<br> We simply have to banish soil and filth amain." <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_50">50</A></FONT></span><br> They closed their gate. To burnish then they set themselves;<br> As heaven's vault, simplicity filled all their shelves.<br> Vast difference there is &#8217;twixt colours and not one.<br> The colours are as clouds; simplicity's the moon.<br> Whatever tinge you see embellishing the clouds,<br> You know comes from the sun, the moon, or stars in crowds.</p>

<p><a name="page_m252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></A></p>  
<p>At length the Chinamen their task had quite fulfilled.<br> With joy intense their hearts did beat, their bosoms thrilled.<br> The sovereign came, inspected all their rich designs,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_55">55</A></FONT></span> And lost his heart with wonder at their talents&#8217; signs.<br> He then passed to the Romans, that his eyes might see.<br> The curtains were withdrawn, to show whate&#8217;er might be.<br> The Chinese paintings all, their whole designs in full,<br> Reflected truly were on that high-burnished wall.<br> Whatever was depicted by the Chinese art<br> Was reproduced by mirrors, perfect every part.</p>  
<p>Those Romans are our mystics;&#8212;know, my worthy friend;<br> No art, no learning; study, none;&#8212;but gain their end.<br> They polish well their bosoms, burnish bright their hearts,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_60">60</A></FONT></span> Remove all stain of lust, of self, pride, hate's deep smarts.<br> That mirror's purity prefigures their hearts&#8217; trust;<br> With endless images reflections it incrust.</p>  
<p>The formless Form the thousand&nbsp;thousand hidden forms<br> Flashed in his breast on Moses&#8217; heart, like mirrored storms.<br> That Form, &#8217;tis true, the heaven of heavens cannot contain;<br> Nor all the space between the zenith and the main.<br> These numbered are, and limited within their bounds;<br> The mirror of the heart is boundless in its rounds.</p>  
<p>Here, reason stands aghast, O erring child of sense;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_65">65</A></FONT></span> The heart's with God,&#8212;the heart is God, boundless, immense<br> From all eternity, the figures of all things,<br> Unnumbered, multitudinous, gleam in heart's wings.<br> To all eternity each new-created form<br> In heart of saint reflected is, most multiform.<br> His polished heart is cleansed from being's soiling stain;<br> And at each moment contemplates fresh beauty's train.</p>  
<p><a name="page_m253"><font size="1" color="green">p. 253</font></A></p>  
<p>The outward gilt, the shell, of science they despise;<br> The banner of real certitude floats where they rise.<br> They've thought abandoned; light and life they've truly found;<br> Their breasts and hearts are filled with love's inspiring sound. 70</p>  
<p>Death, that dread thing of which all mankind stand in fear,<br> Is laughed and mocked at by the saints, when it draws near.<br> No man has power to dominate their tranquil minds.<br> The shell may injured be; the pearl harm never finds.<br> The rhetor's art, the jurist's skill, they set at naught;<br> But poverty, abasement, to themselves they've taught.<br> The scenes of all eight paradises&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_375"></A><A HREF="#fn_374"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are consumed<br> In that full blaze with which their holy heart's illumed.<br> They're more exalted than the heavens and what's beyond;<br> Their place is in the court of love divine, all-fond. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_75">75</A></FONT></span></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_374"></A><A HREF="mes29.htm#fr_375">m253:1</A> Commonly, in Isl&#257;m, eight paradises, or, properly, eight mansions of Paradise, are reported, mentioned, and believed. Baydh&#257;v&#299;, in Qur&#8217;&#257;n ii. 23, gives only seven, and one of those is wrong. Guided by him, however, I have corrected this, and verified the others, besides finding the eighth. Their names, then, are as follows:&#8212;1. <i>Jennatu-&#8217;l-Khuld</i>, the Paradise (garden) of Eternal Duration; 2. <i>Jennatu &#8216;Aden</i>, the Garden of Eden; 3. <i>Jennatu-&#8217;l-Firdaws</i>, the Garden of Paradise; 4. <i>Jennatu-&#8217;l-Me&#8217;v&agrave;</i>, the Garden of the Abode; 5. <i>Jennatu-&#8217;n-Na&#8216;&#299;m</i>, the Paradise of the Pleasantness; 6. <i>D&#257;ru-&#8217;s-Sel&#257;m</i>, the Home of Security; 7. <i>D&#257;ru-&#8217;l-Maq&#257;ma</i>, the House of Sojourn; 8. <i>&#8216;Illiy&#363;n</i>, the Sublime Heights. Baydh&#257;v&#299; has <i>D&#257;ru-&#8217;l-Khuld</i> for <i>Jennatu-&#8217;l-Khuld;</i> but that is one of the names of Hell, as occurring in Qur&#8217;&#257;n xli. 28. There is also a <i>D&#257;ru-&#8217;l-Qar&#257;r</i>, Home of Permanence, mentioned in Qur&#8217;&#257;n xl. 42; but it applies to Hell and Heaven, as does the <i>D&#257;ru-&#8217;l-Baq&#257;</i>, Home of Duration, commonly used, but not found in the Qur&#8217;&#257;n.</P>
