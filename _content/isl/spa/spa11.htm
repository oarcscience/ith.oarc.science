<p align="center"><small>AN ODE TO SPRING.</small></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">From</span> whence hath the spring again returned unto us,<br> Which hath made the country round a garden of flowers?</p>  
<p>There are the anemone and sweet basil, the lily and thyme;<br> The jasmine and white rose, the narcissus and pomegranate blossom.</p>  
<p>The wild flowers of spring are manifold, and of every hue;<br> But the dark-red tulip, above them all, predominateth.</p>  
<p>The maidens place nosegays of flowers in their bosoms;<br> The youths, too, fasten bouquets of them in their turbans.</p>  
<p>Come now, musician! apply the bow to thy violin:<br> Bring out the tone and the melody of every string!</p>  
<p>And thou, cupbearer! bring us full and overflowing cups,<br> That I may become fraught with wine's inebriety!</p>  
<p>The Af<u>gh</u>&#257;n youths have again dyed red their hands,<br> Like as the falcon dyeth his talons in the blood of the quarry.</p>  
<p>They have made rosy their bright swords with gore:<br> The tulip-bed hath blossomed, even in the heat of summer.</p>  
<p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></A></p>  
<p>Ae-mal <u>Kh</u>&#257;n and Dar-y&#257; <u>Kh</u>&#257;n&#8212;from death preserve them!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> Were neither of them, at fault, when opportunity occurred.</p>  
<p>They dyed red the valley of <u>Kh</u>aibar, with the blood of the foe:<br> On Karrapah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> too, they poured forth war's din and tumult.</p>  
<p>From Karrapah, even unto B&#257;jawrr,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> both plain and mountain,<br> Time after time, as from an earthquake, quaked and shook.</p>  
<p>It is now the fifth year, since in this neighbourhood,<br> Every day heareth the clashing of glittering swords.</p>  
<p>Since I arrived in this part,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A> I have become a nonentity&#8212;<br> Either I am despicable, or this people are infamous grown.</p>  
<p>I cry out unto them, "Troops, troops," until I am weary;<br> But deaf to all, they neither say "Die," nor "Thy sacrifice."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;&sect;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>When the state of the Y&#363;sufz&#299;s became known unto me,<br> Low&#257;<u>gh</u>ar was then my better place, not Dam<u>gh</u>&#257;r.</p>  
<p>The dogs of the <u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>aks are far better than the Y&#363;sufz&#299;s,<br> Though, in disposition, the <u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>aks are more worthless than dogs.</p>  
<p>The whole of the other Af<u>gh</u>&#257;ns, from &#7730;andah&#257;r unto A<u>tt</u>ak,<br> In honour's cause, both secretly and openly, are one.</p>  
<p>See how many battles have been fought on all sides;<br> Yet still, amongst the Y&#363;sufz&#299;s, there is no sense of shame.</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>The first fight was at the higher back of Mount Tat&#257;rah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> Where forty thousand Mu<u>gh</u>als were scattered like chaff.</p>  
<p>When their sisters and daughters fell into the bonds of the Af<u>gh</u>&#257;ns,<br> With horses and camels, elephants and baggage, string after string.</p>  
<p>The second battle was with Mir Husain in the Do&#257;bah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> When his head was crushed, like that of a venemous snake.</p>  
<p>After that again, was the affair at the fort of Noh<u>s&#146;h</u>airah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A><br> When from the Mu<u>gh</u>als I extracted my own inebriation.</p>  
<p>And then came Jaswant Singh and <u>Sh</u>uja&aelig;at <u>Kh</u>&#257;n,<br> Of whom, Ae-mal <u>Kh</u>&#257;n plucked up the roots at Gand&#257;b.</p>  
<p>The sixth was over Mukarram <u>Kh</u>&#257;n and <u>Sh</u>am<u>sh</u>er <u>Kh</u>&#257;n,<br> Both of whom, at <u>Kh</u>&#257;pa<u>sh</u>, Ae-mal scattered to the winds.</p>  
<p>These are the greatest triumphs that I hold in recollection;<br> But the lesser ones, in all directions, who shall compute?</p>  
<p>Up to the present time, victory hath been always with us;<br> And for the future, upon God, is our dependence placed.</p>  
<p>A year hath passed since Aurangzeb is encamped against us,<br> Disordered and perplexed in appearance, and wounded in heart.</p>  
<p>It is now year after year, that his nobles fall in battle;<br> But his armies swept away, who shall number them!</p>  
<p>The treasures of India have been spread out before us:<br> The red gold <i>muhurs</i> have been engulphed in the hills.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></A></p>  
<p>It would not have entered one's head in eighteen guesses,<br> That such events would e&#8217;er have happened in these parts.</p>  
<p>Still Aurangzeb's malevolence hath not a whit diminished,<br> Though the curses of his father it before drew down.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>For this reason, also, no one can place dependence on him:<br> He is malignant and perfidious; a breaker of his word.</p>  
<p>For this state of things, no other termination can be seen,<br> Than that the Mu<u>gh</u>als be annihilated, or the Af<u>gh</u>&#257;ns undone.</p>  
<p>If this, which is beheld, be the revolutions of destiny&#8212;<br> If in this be the will of the Almighty, the time is come.</p>  
<p>Fate revolveth not in the same fashion at all times<br> Now &#8217;tis propitious to the rose; now favourable to the thorn.</p>  
<p>At a period so pregnant with honour and glory, as the present,<br> In what manner do these base and recreant Af<u>gh</u>&#257;ns act?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>There is no deliverance in any thing, save the sword:<br> Af<u>gh</u>&#257;ns, who nourish any other idea than this, are lost, indeed.</p>  
<p>The Af<u>gh</u>&#257;ns are far superior to the Mu<u>gh</u>als at the sword,<br> Were but the Af<u>gh</u>&#257;ns, in intellect, a little discreet.</p>  
<p>If the different tribes would but support each other,<br> Kings would have to bow down in prostration before them.</p>  
<p>But whether it be concord or strife, or folly or wisdom,<br> The affairs of every one are in the hands of the Almighty.</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="green">p. 153</font></A></p>  
<p>Let us see what the Afr&#299;d&#299;s, Mohmands, and <u>Sh</u>&#299;nw&#257;ris will do;<br> For the Mu<u>gh</u>als are now lying encamped at Nangrah&#257;r.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>I alone, amongst the Af<u>gh</u>&#257;ns, grieve for our honour and renown;<br> Whilst the Y&#363;sufz&#299;s, at their ease, are tilling their fields.</p>  
<p>They who now act so dishonourably, and so shamelessly,<br> Will, hereafter, the upshot of their own acts perceive.</p>  
<p>In my poor judgment, death is more preferable than life,<br> When existence can no longer, with honour, be enjoyed.</p>  
<p>In this world, he will not always remain with life;<br> But the memory of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l</span> will long, long endure!</p>  
<p>It was the first of the Third Sister,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> in the year of <u>Gh</u>af&#363;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A><br> That I, whilst at Barmawul, indited these lines.</p>  <h4 align="center">II.</h4>  
<p>What wonderfully delicious wine is this,<br> Which the cupbearer, with welcome, presents!</p>  
<p>The laughing of the bud in the parterre were impossible,<br> Did not the zephyr, every morning, over it pass.</p>  
<p>Its counsel regarding the nightingale was this,<br> That the morn should the rosebud's garment rend.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A></p>

<p>Appreciate thou the value of Philomel, O rose,<br> Although thou bloomest in this thy beauty now!</p>  
<p>Since his cure dependeth upon the object of his heart,<br> Of the lover's disease, what do physicians know?</p>  
<p>Save the beloved-one's beaming countenance, imagine not<br> That <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l</span> will be, with any other face, content.</p>  <h4 align="center">III.</h4>  
<p>Spring hath returned: the narcissus in the garden wantoneth,<br> And the breeze of the morning, the spikenard disordereth.</p>  
<p>For five short days, the rose of the parterre will bloom;<br> But on the sixth, it scattereth its existence to the winds.</p>  
<p>The enamoured nightingale layeth its head at the rose's feet,<br> As the Brahman bendeth, in adoration, his idol before.</p>  
<p>Acquire thou humility from the example of the cypress,<br> That with such loftiness, showeth this much lowliness.</p>  
<p>The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Karl&#257;rrnaey</span>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> hath quaffed no other wine whatever&#8212;<br> The whole of this inebriety proceedeth from creation's cup.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  <h4 align="center">IV.</h4>  
<p>My beloved is offended: would there were any one who would conciliate her!<br> Arise quickly, O mediator! for my heart is grieved on her account.</p>

<p>He will be constantly plunging into the deep seas of injustice,<br> Who rendereth up his heart unto the heart-ravishers of these days.</p>  
<p>What a vile world it is! what are its customs! what its ways!<br> It abandoneth, altogether, the starving, and giveth invitation to the cloyed!</p>  
<p>Punished they cannot be; but would I could lay hands, as I wish, on them;<br> For &#8217;tis those sable locks of thine, that are ever of hearts making theft.</p>  
<p>The tyranny of thy dark tresses is by no means hidden from view&#8212;<br> The impassioned-one, who may be powerful, soon her tyranny displayeth.</p>  
<p>Thou that givest thyself unto the tender passion, accept in love<br> The taunts and reproaches, that the world, upon lovers, ever cast.</p>  
<p>Thy blood-thirsty locks have not made me, only, desolate;<br> And many more, like unto me, forlorn, will they, even yet, destroy.</p>  
<p>Wouldst thou, this one so arrogant of her beauty see, draw near!<br> Alas! towards <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l</span>, her coquetry she openly displayeth.</p>  <h4 align="center">V.</h4>  
<p>Wherefore doth Aurangzeb his throne and crown adorn?<br> For death will assail, and lay waste the both of them.</p>  
<p>His evil name only will remain behind in the world;<br> Knowing, as he doth, whether he as Kasr&#257;, or as Huj&#257;j acteth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>

<p>O&#8217;erwhelmed in grief, I know not of festival or feast,<br> Though the whole people of Dilh&#299; make gladness and joy.</p>  
<p>All the water went to the eyes, and the heart's fire blazed out&#8212;<br> Alas, how can any one, in such a state of mind as this exist!</p>  
<p>They turn pale when they lay finger upon my pulse;<br> Then, by what means, can the physicians, my disorder cure?</p>  
<p>Separation lacerateth my heart in the same manner,<br> As the falcon rendeth the partridge and the quail.</p>  
<p>When two friends may be separated by a distant land,<br> How desirous God maketh them of a mere salutation!</p>  
<p>My tears are produced through the emotions of the heart,<br> Like as fire expelleth the moisture from the roasting meat.</p>  
<p>Alas, every arrow that is discharged from fatality's bow,<br> Destiny maketh poor <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l's</span> heart the butt of!</p>  <h4 align="center">VI.</h4>  
<p>Thou wast saying, "Grieve not any more; for I am thine, and thou art mine:"<br> Whether thou hast falsely or truly spoken, thou hast, indeed, given me life again.</p>  
<p>What a lovely calamity thou art! a charmer, incomparable, art thou!<br> Would that there were not this defect, that thou hadst not such a cruel heart!</p>  
<p>Should the whole universe, in every direction, be with the lovely filled;<br> Even then, it would be astonishing, if one were found beautiful like thee.</p>  
<p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="green">p. 157</font></A></p>  
<p>With so many victims slain, even yet thou showiest no pity or regret:<br> But what matter, though the executioner shed blood a hundred times over?</p>  
<p>Since out of thy garden, or thy parterre, I beg for a rose from thee,<br> Shouldst thou but a straw on me bestow, yet I, as a rose, receive it.</p>  
<p>As long as I may exist, I am, indeed, the captive of those ringlets,<br> In every hair of which, hundreds of hearts will ever be enthralled.</p>  
<p>Whether old, or whether young, all are distracted about thee:<br> There is not a person in the town, that is not enamoured of thee.</p>  
<p>The cypress-tree behold! it very soon ceaseth to be looked upon,<br> When thou, with this stature and figure, through the garden trippest.</p>  
<p>The prospect of Heaven to come, is bliss to both monk and priest;<br> But <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l</span> hath gained Paradise, at once, in meeting thee.</p>  <h4 align="center">VII.</h4>  
<p>Again the minstrel's rebeck toucheth the heart profoundly;<br> For it discovereth new and fresh strains of melodious harmony.</p>  
<p>Leave the monk in the monastery's nook! I will to the garden;<br> For the flowers of spring instruct me in righteousness&#8217; ways.</p>  
<p>Beggars have much anxiety about filling their bellies;<br> And kings should be solicitous regarding dominion and realm.</p>  
<p>If this be not the effect of my good fortune, what is it then,<br> That against the guardian she crieth out to this degree?</p>  
<p>How much more will be the extent of the love of her constancy,<br> When, in injustice and inconstancy, such favour she bestoweth?</p>  
<p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></A></p>  
<p>Within this city, the juice of the grape is thus so openly sold;<br> Because the censor, himself, favoureth the bibbers of wine.</p>  
<p>From thy coldness to me, I grow both joyful and melancholy,<br> Like unto one that giveth thanks to, and yet complaineth of another.</p>  
<p>If to love to look upon the pretty creatures be aught of sinfulness,<br> Then <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l</span> committeth iniquity, all his life long.</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII.</h4>  
<p>When towards his father a son acteth perfidiously,<br> After what manner, to others, will he sincerity show?</p>  
<p>See, what further perfidy must be within his heart,<br> When the hypocrite maketh avowal of his own misdeeds.</p>  
<p>Neither will I pardon the enormities of the degenerate,<br> Nor will the Almighty forgive the fallen angel his sins.</p>  
<p>All these minor hills are as nothing: desirous am I,<br> That my God, betwixt us, would place even &#7730;&#257;f&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> itself.</p>  
<p>The conduct of his own son is best known to his father;<br> Then why will people commend the degenerate unto me?</p>  
<p>Neither can any liar utter falsehoods like him,<br> Nor can any one equal him in cunning and deceit.</p>  
<p>There are both a thousand varieties of vain lies in his heart,<br> And a thousand vaunts of morality upon his tongue.</p>  
<p>That I cherished, and brought up such an undutiful son,<br> It was, alas! for this, that he should, against me, rise up!</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="green">p. 159</font></A></p>  
<p>Let me not, indeed, cast eyes upon him whilst I live;<br> And after death, let him not dare my grave to approach.</p>  
<p>Sorrow and grief shall, whilst living, leave his heart,<br> If fate, unto <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l</span>, shall due justice grant.</p>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
<p>Every sick person that is impatient with his physician,<br> Bringeth, if thou but consider, affliction upon himself.</p>  
<p>The fish existeth in the river; but should it come out thereof,<br> Can it be comfortable, or at ease, upon the dry land?</p>  
<p>Though the bat hideth himself from the light of the sun,<br> In what manner doth the sun sustain injury therefrom?</p>  
<p>&#8217;Tis the nature of dogs to howl at the sight of the moon;<br> And thus, by their yelping, bring disgrace on themselves.</p>  
<p>The dung-beetle is distressed by the flower's perfume;<br> Because its existence is sustained by offensiveness.</p>  
<p>That the prophets are evil in the sight of the infidel,<br> Is, because whatever they do, is with the Devil's advice.</p>  
<p>Unfortunate, indeed, is he, who acteth on his enemy's counsel:<br> Can an opponent and an enemy ever give good advice?</p>  
<p>The heron, on the river's bank, is with thirst parched;<br> For every penurious creature followeth his own avaricious ways.</p>  
<p>With the precepts of the &#7730;ur&#8217;&#257;n, F&#257;r&#363;&#7731; is acquainted:<br> It pointeth not out the right path to B&#363;-L&#7717;ab, or to B&#363;-Jhal.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>

<p>The purity of the Musalm&#257;n, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l</span>! is possible;<br> But no ablutions, no purifications, can make the Gabr&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> clean.</p>  <h4 align="center">X.</h4>  
<p>Through sorrow at the poor-spiritedness of the Af<u>gh</u>&#257;ns,<br> I have abandoned greatness, and taken meanness in hand.</p>  
<p>Had this much even been gained in the matter, it were good&#8212;<br> Had I wreaked upon the recreant my full meed of revenge.</p>  
<p>From the time when the jewel of my honour became broken,<br> I have not left, for a moment, my eyes free from tears.</p>  
<p>That pearl came not into my hands, after all my trouble,<br> And, therefore, my boat I have drawn up on the sea-shore.</p>  
<p>This waist of mine, that in resistance was a mountain,<br> Through chagrin and disappointment, unto the Mu<u>gh</u>al I bent.</p>  
<p>But let good fortune once commence again to aid me,<br> That it may relieve me from the weight of affliction's load</p>  
<p>This misery of mine is not to be compared to any other grief,<br> Although I may have experienced a thousand woes and sorrows.</p>  
<p>The back of fortune, and. the world's, both are turned upon me;<br> Hence, through sorrow, I turned my face from all, the Mu<u>gh</u>al unto.</p>  
<p>Were it in my power, or were it mine own free-will,<br> I would not, even two paces, towards them advance.</p>  
<p>I am obliged to hearken to crooked words from the mouths of those,<br> Unto whom, in my lifetime, I never before a straight one gave.</p>

<p>The outcries of my own people, and of strangers, affect me,<br> Notwithstanding I used, even from a whisper, to screen myself.</p>  
<p>I am now ashamed of those proud and boastful words,<br> That, before every one, were wont to issue from my lips.</p>  
<p>A hundred reproaches and indignities are heaped upon me,<br> Who ever guarded myself from detraction and reproach.</p>  
<p>&#8217;Tis for this reason the elephant streweth dust upon his head,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> That I made him acquainted with <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l's</span> sorrows.</p>  <h4 align="center">XI.</h4>  
<p>If, for once only, she will show her face from the veil,<br> She will take the diploma of beauty from the sun.</p>  
<p>The tulip shall borrow bloom from her countenance;<br> The hyacinth will grow furious at the sight of her curls.</p>  
<p>Wherefore Both the world accuse fortune thus falsely?<br> &#8217;Tis she, that with her eyes, hath desolated the world.</p>  
<p>Either those orbs of hers are red from wine's effects,<br> Or some one hath roused her from sleep, unseasonably.</p>  
<p>She quaffeth the blood of hearts in the place of wine;<br> Then again, taketh roasted hearts, as au incitement to more.</p>  
<p>The special death of the slaughtered by the hand of the beloved,<br> Is that they may enter Paradise, without rendering account.</p>  
<p>Let my heart be a compass, and let it never vary or turn<br> In any other direction, save the altar of thine eyebrows unto.</p>

<p>There is nothing whatever in it&#8212;there is a great bustle in an empty shop:<br> When I duly considered the matter, I found it all mere fancy&#8212;a phantom&#8212;a dream.</p>  
<p>One is being laid in the cold grave, whilst another, at home, sitteth unconcerned;<br> Then there are three days of mourning; and on the fourth, the case is changed.</p>

<p>The songs of the nightingales will not always be made for thee;<br> For thou, O lovely rose! art notorious for thy lack of constancy.</p>  
<p>Delight, then, the senses of the nightingale with thine own fragrance,<br> For the few, short days, that thou freshly bloomest, the garden within.</p>  
<p>Should I desire to mention, unto any one, thy injustice, &#8217;tis unspeakable;<br> Yet with all this heavy amount of wrongs, thou art my life still.</p>  
<p>But shouldst thou complain, unto any one, of the injustice of thy beloved,<br> May all love's calamities befall thee; for thou sayest what is false.</p>

<p>Should one but restrain his eyes, there would be no misery:<br> It is the eyesight that hurleth the thunderbolts upon the heart.</p>  
<p>Forbid, O God, that any one in the world should fall in love!<br> For it is like unto an invading army in the body's realm.</p>  
<p>This poor, maddened heart of mine, began to laugh yestreen;<br> But see! to-day, it has commenced, once more, to weep again.</p>  
<p>That I have drawn out the diver of thought from the depths of the ocean,<br> Come and behold; for the words of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l</span> are pearls, indeed!</p>  <h4 align="center">LXXXVIII.</h4>

<p>The running stream and life's career are both one and the same&#8212;<br> In this world, those joyous days and nights, return to us no more!</p>  
<p>All love, save that of God, if thou perceivest, is, altogether,<br> As if one built a bridge of straws upon the surface of the stream.</p>  
<p>With all this grace and beauty that I see possessed by thee,<br> Whether thou art of human mould, or a fay, I cannot say.</p>  
<p>Without the wind's aid, I attain not to the object of my desire,<br> Notwithstanding I launch upon the waters the boat of my heart.</p>  
<p>From the dusky snakes of thy tresses he entertaineth no dread,<br> Who, in his mouth, holdeth the snake-root of thy affection and love.</p>  
<p>The heart of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l</span>, in piety, was like unto a mountain;<br> But, all at once &#8217;tis to a gossamer changed, through his love for thee.</p>

<p>Of the preciousness of youth what doubt can be entertained?<br> The period of old age is pregnant with infirmities and defects!</p>  
<p>Every now and again, fresh wounds break out upon my heart;<br> And salt is spread and sprinkled upon my wounds always.</p>  
<p>Should joy and gladness approach thee, be not overjoyed thereat;<br> For care and sorrow ever stare happiness in the face.</p>  
<p>Murmur not at the tyranny, or the injustice of any one;<br> For it is fate that dealeth out misfortune upon us all.</p>  
<p>Without some wise object, He hath not brought sorrow upon us;<br> For affliction is the test on the face of the dastard and the brave.</p>  
<p>As much as happiness exceedeth, so much the more lavish is misery:<br> Fortunate is he, indeed, for whose belly sufficeth the dry crust.</p>

<p>Since so many pleasant and familiar faces are buried beneath this earth,<br> When I shall join them in the grave, it will be a very paradise to me.</p>  
<p>Is old age come upon me? am I imbecile grown? or is there aught else?<br> For that doth not succeed which I set about; and yet people and country are the same.</p>  
<p>Tho&#8217; I speak unto folks ever so kindly, they take in bad part what I say unto them<br> &#8217;Tis either the good fortune of the Mu<u>gh</u>als, or my intellect hath deficient become.</p>  
<p>No! &#8217;tis not the good fortune of the Mu<u>gh</u>als, nor am I in intellect wanting<br> &#8217;Tis, entirely, through old age, that my affairs are all disordered and confused.</p>  
<p>The Mu<u>gh</u>als whom I now set eyes upon, are not such as were wont to be:<br> The day of their swords is past and gone, and but the pen remaineth unto them.</p>

<p>Like as when fire reacheth brushwood, and it ceaseth to be;<br> So with absence's pangs&#8212;they last, only, for a few short days.</p>
