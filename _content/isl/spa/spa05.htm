<p align="center"><small>IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD!</small></p>  <h4 align="center">I.</h4>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Behold</span>! such an Omnipotent Being is my God,<br> That He is the possessor of all power, authority, and will.</p>  
<p>Should one enumerate all the most mighty, pure, and eminent,<br> My God is mightier, purer, and more eminent than all.</p>  
<p>No want, nor requirement of His, is dependant upon any one;<br> Neither is my God under obligation, nor beholden to any.</p>  
<p>Out of nothingness He produced the form of entity;<br> In such wise is my God the Creator, and the Nourisher of all.</p>  
<p>He is the artist and the artificer of all and every created thing:<br> My God is, likewise, the hearer of every word and accent.</p>  
<p>That which hath neither type nor parallel anywhere,<br> Its essence and its nature, its material and its principle, my God is.</p>  
<p>All the structures, whether of this world or of that to come,<br> My God is the architect, and the builder of them all.</p>  
<p>He is the decipherer and the construer of the unwritten pages&#8212;<br> The unfolder and the elucidator of all mysteries my God is.</p>  
<p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A></p>  
<p>Apparent or manifest; hidden or obscure; intermediate or intercalary;<br> My God is cognizant of, and familiar with, all matters and things.</p>  
<p>He hath neither partner nor associate&#8212;His dominion is from Himself alone<br> A sovereign, without colleague or coadjutor, my God is.</p>  
<p>Not that His unity and individuality proceed from impuissance;<br> For, in His one and unique nature, He is infinite, unlimited.</p>  
<p>They have neither need nor necessity of the friendship of others,<br> Unto whom my God is beneficently and graciously inclined.</p>  
<p>Wherefore then the occasion that I should seek Him elsewhere,<br> Since, in mine own dwelling, my God is ever at my side?</p>  
<p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</span>! He is neither liable to change, nor to mutation&#8212;<br> My God is unchangeable and immutable, for ever and ever!</p>  <h4 align="center">II.</h4>  
<p>My weeping for the beloved hath passed beyond all computation;<br> Yet the dear one is in no way affected at the sight of my tears.</p>  
<p>Though every one of my words should be pearls of great price,<br> Still she doth not account them at all worthy of her ears.</p>  
<p>Were she overcome by sleep, I would arouse her by my cries;<br> But though fully awake, my loved one is asleep unto me.</p>  
<p>Like unto a writing, I speak, though with mouth covered;<br> But my silence surpasseth my wails and my lamentations?</p>  
<p>When is there security for the crop of love in scorching ground!<br> It requireth a salamander to exist in this desert of mine.</p>  
<p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></A></p>  
<p>This is not my love that separation hath parted from me:<br> &#8217;Tis my soul, which hath become separated from this body of mine.</p>  
<p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</span>, desire naught else than the beloved of my heart,<br> Should my prayer be accepted at the threshold of the Almighty.</p>  <h4 align="center">III.</h4>  
<p>There is no return for thee, a second time, unto this world!<br> To-day is thy opportunity, whether thou followest evil or good!</p>  
<p>Every thing for which the opportunity is gone, is the ph&#339;nix of our desires;<br> But the immortal bird hath never been caught in any one's net.</p>  
<p>The stream, that hath left the sluice, floweth not back again!<br> The hour, which hath passed away, returneth to us no more!</p>  
<p>For time is, alas! like unto the dead in the sepulchre's niche;<br> And no one hath brought, by weeping, the dead to life again.</p>  
<p>If thou hast any object to attain, be quick, for time is short:<br> Flatter not thyself on the permanency of this brief existence!</p>  
<p>Each target, of which, in thy heart, thou considerest thyself sure,<br> Through pride and vanity, thou wilt surely miss thine aim of.</p>  
<p>Over-sanguine hope hath rendered many desponding:<br> Be not off thy guard as to the deceit and fraud of time!</p>  
<p>When thy mouth becometh shattered by the stroke of death,<br> In what manner wilt thou then offer praises with it?</p>  
<p>The bereaved woman, who giveth utterance to her bewailings,<br> Lamenteth over thee, if thou understandest what she says.</p>  
<p>Thou art not a child, that one should teach thee by force:<br> Thou art wise and intelligent, and arrived at maturity's years.</p>  
<p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></A></p>  
<p>Exercise, then, thine own understanding as to good and evil,<br> Whether thy well-being lieth in this, or in that.</p>  
<p>Conceal thy face beneath thy mantle, and open thine eyes:<br> Fly not far away on the winds of vanity and ambition!</p>  
<p>Soar not unto the heavens with thy head in the air,<br> For thou art, originally, from the dust of the earth created.</p>  
<p>At the last day, inquiry will not be made of thee,<br> As to whether thou art the son or grandson of such an one.</p>  
<p>To the bride, who may not be handsome in her own person,<br> What signify her mother's or her grandmother's good looks?</p>  
<p>Practise goodness in thine own person, and fear evil!<br> Presume not on the virtues of thy father or thy mother!</p>  
<p>These precepts, O my friend! I urge upon myself:<br> Be not then grieved that I have made use of thy name.</p>  
<p>I use thine and those of others, but speak to myself alone:<br> With any one else, I have neither motive nor concern.</p>  
<p>Whatever I utter, I address the whole unto myself:<br> All these failings and defects are only mine own.</p>  
<p>Had I a place for these sorrows within my own breast,<br> Why should I give utterance unto these declamations?</p>  
<p>Since the racking pains of mortality are before thee,<br> Why dost thou not die, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</span>! before they come?</p>  <h4 align="center">IV.</h4>  
<p>No one hath proved any of the world's faithfulness or sincerity;<br> And none, but the faithless and perfidious, have any affection for it.</p>  
<p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></A></p>  
<p>They who may lay any claim unto it, as belonging to them,<br> Speak wholly under delusion; for the world is no one's own.</p>  
<p>Fortune is like unto a potter&#8212;it fashioneth and breaketh:<br> Many, like unto me and thee, it hath created and destroyed.</p>  
<p>Every stone and clod of the world, that may be looked upon,<br> Are all sculls; some those of kings, and some of beggars.</p>  
<p>It behoveth not that one should place a snare in the world's path;<br> For the capture of the griffin and the ph&#339;nix cannot be effected.</p>  
<p>Who can place any dependence upon this fleeting breath?<br> It is impossible to confine the wind with the strongest chain!</p>  
<p>Whether the sun or the moon, the upshot is extinction:<br> Doth the flower always bloom? Nothing can exist for ever!</p>  
<p>Walk not, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</span>! contrary to the ways of the enlightened;<br> Since the love of the world is not approved of by any wise man.</p>  <h4 align="center">V.</h4>  
<p>If one seek a charmer in the world, this is the one:<br> This is the dear one, who is the ornament of the universe.</p>  
<p>There will hot be such another lover in it as myself;<br> Nor will ever such a beloved one be created like thee.</p>  
<p>I had shown patience under thy harshness and cruelty;<br> But, in the place of lamentation, joy and gladness cannot be.</p>  
<p>I will never consent to be separated from thee,<br> So long as my soul is not separated from this body of mine.</p>  
<p>Like unto the congregation behind, with the priest before,<br> In such wise have I imitated and followed thee.</p>  
<p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></A></p>  
<p>I am not the only one&#8212;the whole world loveth thee!<br> Whether it be the beggar, or the sovereign of the age.</p>  
<p>Would that thou wouldst grant me a deed of protection,<br> Since thou puttest me off with the promise of to-morrow!</p>  
<p>&#8217;Tis not that of mine own accord I am smitten with thee:<br> &#8217;Twas a voice from thy direction that reached me.</p>  
<p>Indeed, from all eternity, I am devoted unto thee&#8212;.<br> It is not that to-day only, I have a beginning made.</p>  
<p>When with the sword of thy love it shall be severed,<br> Then will the neck of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</span> have its duty performed.</p>  <h4 align="center">VI.</h4>  
<p>The godly are the light and the refulgence of the world:<br> The pious are the guides and the directors of mankind.</p>  
<p>If any one seek the way unto God and his Prophet,<br> The devout are the guides to point out the path.</p>  
<p>The alchemist, that searcheth about for the philosopher's stone,<br> Will find it the bosom companion of the sanctified.</p>  
<p>In the society of the enlightened, he will turn to red gold,<br> Though a person may be as a stone or a clod of the desert.</p>  
<p>The ignorant are, as it were, like unto the dead:<br> Verily, the wise are like unto the saints themselves.</p>  
<p>The enlightened are, comparatively, like unto the Messiah;<br> Since, from their breath, the dead return to life again.</p>  
<p>He who may not possess some portion of wisdom<br> Is not a man: he is, as it were, but an empty model.</p>  
<p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></A></p>  
<p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</span>, am the servant of every enlightened being,<br> Whether he be of the highest, the middle, or the lowest degree.</p>  <h4 align="center">VII.</h4>  
<p>Come, do not be the source of trouble unto any one;<br> For this short life of thine will soon be lost, O faithless one!</p>  
<p>No one is to be a tarrier behind, in this world:<br> All are to be departers, either to-day or to-morrow.</p>  
<p>Those dear friends, who to-day bloom before thee,<br> Will, in two or three short days, fade and decay.</p>  
<p>If the sight of any be pleasing to thee, cherish them:<br> After they wither and die, when will they again revive?</p>  
<p>The leaves of autumn, that fall from the branch,<br> By no contrivance can the sage attach them again.</p>  
<p>When the rain-drops fall from the sky upon the earth,<br> They cannot again ascend unto the heavens whence they came.</p>  
<p>Imagine not, that those tears which the eye sheddeth,<br> Shall e&#8217;er again return to the eyes they flowed from.</p>  
<p>This is a different sun that riseth every morn:<br> The sun, that setteth once, riseth not again.</p>  
<p>Though paradise is not gained by devotion, without grace;<br> Still, every man his neck from the debt must release.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Shouldst thou incur a hundred toils for the flesh's sake,<br> Not one shall be of any avail to-morrow unto thee.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></A></p>  
<p>Shouldst thou gorge thy stomach with the world itself,<br> Thou wilt not be remembered, either in blessings or in prayers.</p>  
<p>Shouldst thou give but a grain of corn unto the hungered,<br> Verily, it will be hereafter thy provision in eternity.</p>  
<p>Shouldst thou bestow but a drop of water on the thirsty,<br> It will become an ocean between thee and the fire of hell.</p>  
<p>Shouldst thou once bow thy head in the road of the Almighty,<br> Thou shalt, at the last day, be more exalted than any.</p>  
<p>This world, then, is the mart, if one be inclined to traffic;<br> But in that world there is neither barter nor gain.</p>  
<p>If friends comprehend aught, to-day is their time,<br> That one friend may show self-devotion to another.</p>  
<p>If there is any real existence here, of a truth &#8217;tis this,<br> That in some one's society it should in happiness pass.</p>  
<p>May God protect us from such a state of existence,<br> Where thou mayst speak ill of others, and others of thee.</p>  
<p>Poison even, is pleasant, if it be in peace and in concord;<br> But not sugar, combined with sedition and with strife.</p>  
<p>The belly, filled with rubbish, is well, if free from sorrow;<br> But not so, though gorged with confection of the dregs of woe.</p>  
<p>The back, bent from toil, is indeed estimable;<br> But not from a purse of ill-gotten money round the waist.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>A blind man, who seeth nothing, is truly excellent;<br> Better than that he should set eyes on another man's wife.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></A></p>  
<p>A dumb person is far better without palate or tongue,<br> Than that his tongue should become the utterer of evil words.</p>  
<p>A deaf man, who cannot hear, is preferable by far,<br> Than that his ears should be open to scandalous tales.</p>  
<p>Demon or devil, that may come upon one, is agreeable;<br> But let not the Almighty a bad man before thee bring!</p>  
<p>Than to bear the society of a fool, it is more preferable<br> That a fiery dragon should become one's bosom friend.</p>  
<p>If there be a real difficulty, it is the healing of hearts;<br> But the profit and loss of the world are trifling affairs.</p>  
<p>Its advantages, or its detriments, are trivial matters&#8212;<br> God forbid that any one become infamous for despicable things!</p>  
<p>Forbid that any such desire of thine be accomplished,<br> Whereby the heart of thy brother or relation be grieved!</p>  
<p>Should one eat delicious food, and another be eyeing it,<br> Such is not victuals, it is mere poison, so to speak.</p>  
<p>It behoveth at times to respect other's wishes, at times thine own;<br> But thine own good pleasure is not to be regarded always.</p>  
<p>The wise concern not themselves in such matters,<br> In which there's constant grief, and not an hour's pleasure.</p>  
<p>It is incumbent on judges to administer justice;<br> But not to give their ears unto venal things.</p>  
<p>Thoughts and ideas of all sorts enter into man's mind;<br> But it is not meet to account them all right and just.</p>  
<p>The devout should have a constant eye towards their faith;<br> For some thoughts are virtues, whilst others are sins.</p>  
<p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></A></p>  
<p>God forbid that iniquity proceed from any one's hands!<br> What affinity is there between sin and innocence&#8212;evil and good?</p>  
<p>It is not that all men are equally on a parity together;<br> For some are eminent, some indifferent, some vile and base.</p>  
<p>The dignity of every one lieth within its own degree:<br> It idiot meet that the groom should the noble's rank acquire.</p>  
<p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</span>, neither thank, nor complain of any one;<br> For I have no other friend or enemy but myself.</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII.</h4>  
<p>He hath obtained happiness and felicity in this world,<br> Who in it hath acquired contentment and peace.</p>  
<p>The dominion of Solomon, for a thousand years,<br> Equaleth not an hour's devotion, in this world.</p>  
<p>One breath, in remembrance of the Deity, is more inestimable<br> Than the whole wealth of the universe, in this world.</p>  
<p>They have found advantage and emolument in it,<br> Who occupied themselves in piety, in this world.</p>  
<p>If there be any blessing, truly, it is that of devotion:<br> Consider that there is no greater good, in this world.</p>  
<p>If there be any toils and troubles, verily they are religion's:<br> No other labours and trials are of avail, in this world.</p>  
<p>All, all is transitory, and perisheth, save the Almighty,<br> Whether it be pleasure, or whether it be beauty, in this world.</p>  
<p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></A></p>  
<p>Even the monarch, he goeth down unto the dust at last:<br> Then what is glory, and what is .fame, in this world?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>There will be no greater blockhead therein, than he<br> Who seeketh for happiness or tranquillity, in this world.</p>  
<p>Thou, who desirest in this life a short period of repose,<br> Say, hath any one yet obtained it, in this world?</p>  
<p>Relentless fate will make it like unto the shifting sands,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> Whoever buildeth up a structure, in this world.</p>  
<p>It is not a whit less than the stumbling of the drunkard,<br> Man's brief stability and continuance, in this world.</p>  
<p>Come near the running stream&#8212;here behold life!<br> There are many such like emblems, in this world.</p>  
<p>Every one that approacheth the graveyard of the dead,<br> Should consider it a sufficient admonition, in this world.</p>  
<p>These massive courts, these firm and compact mansions,<br> Will certainly at last be desolate, in this world.</p>  
<p>The insatiable eyes of destiny, indeed, are not such<br> That they suffer any one to be in safety, in this world.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></A></p>  
<p>Whatever cometh into it, departeth from it again:<br> All creatures are merely travellers, in this world.</p>  
<p>When the judgment cometh, austerities cannot be practised:<br> He is the man, who hath mortified the flesh, in this world.</p>  
<p>Since to-morrow he will rise again with the same qualities,<br> Let not God give any one an evil nature, in this world!</p>  
<p>That will, verily, be unto him a harvest after death,<br> Whatever he may have sown in the field of this world.</p>  
<p>Although that world cannot be seen here below;<br> Yet I can perceive its signs and its omens, in this world.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>There will be no reciprocity of viaticum in the last day;<br> For I have myself beheld doomsday, in this world.</p>  
<p>They will go down into the tomb as a deposit also,<br> Whoever may exist as a deposit, in this world.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Virtue is present bliss; but propitious fortune is necessary,<br> That one may acquire felicity, in this world.</p>  
<p>Good habits, virtuous actions, and a noble disposition,<br> Are paradise and happiness, too, in this world.</p>  
<p>Contrariety and opposition plunge a man's life in torment:<br> Such antagonism is of no avail, in this world.</p>  
<p>The hand to the forehead, and on the breast,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> to every one:<br> This, indeed, is greatness and distinction, in this world.</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></A></p>  
<p>If exalted rank be of advantage unto any one,<br> A high place is justice and equity, in this world.</p>  
<p>No other regrets can be taken out of it by us,<br> Save those of affection and kindness, in this world.</p>  
<p>The whole of that world's traffic is carried on in this,<br> If one desire to follow commerce, in this world.</p>  
<p>If man's good fortune may not have become inverted,<br> The truth is by no means hidden from him, in this world.</p>  
<p>It behoveth that good be rendered for good, evil for evil,<br> If any one seek after holiness, in this world.</p>  
<p>The Almighty hath bestowed sanctity upon them,<br> Who have shown stedfastness and constancy, in this world.</p>  
<p>Should all created beings combine in union together,<br> They will not be able to change their lot, in this world.</p>  
<p>If any one here below can be called a man, verily &#8217;tis he<br> Who may have neither need nor necessity, in this world.</p>  
<p>Since solicitude on its account is the cause of all sin,<br> How can people show such a hankering, for this world?</p>  
<p>Over <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</span>, indeed, this life hath passed away,<br> Even as a short hour glideth away, in this world.</p>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
<p>Consider not the wise of this world shrewd and sagacious;<br> For foolish and silly are all the wise ones of this world.</p>  
<p>The light of wisdom is prohibited unto those hearts,<br> On which may rest the dirt and dust of this world.</p>  
<p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></A></p>  
<p>What one of the world saith, is all nonsense and absurdity:<br> Emptiness and folly are every word and speech of this world.</p>  
<p>They merely play and gambol, after the manner of infants,<br> Who occupy themselves with the affairs of this world.</p>  
<p>Like unto babies, with their mouths filled with milk,<br> Are all the subtle and the experienced of this world.</p>  
<p>He will ever continue to be a dolt and an idiot,<br> Who may be drunk from the intoxication of this world.</p>  
<p>In truth, the toper's inebriation will not be so great<br> As will be that of the drunken with the wine of this world.</p>  
<p>There is a medicine in the world for every sick person;<br> But, alas! there is no physic for the sick of this world.</p>  
<p>The cure of every one that hath been burned can be effected;<br> But not that of the scorched from the fiery sparks of this world.</p>  
<p>Whatever thou throwest into the fire consumeth away;<br> And satiated will never become the seeker of this world:</p>  
<p>He will ever be as a captive, sunk in distress and sorrow;<br> Then God forbid one should become the slave of this world!</p>  
<p>He will be for ever immersed in lurid gloom and darkness,<br> Whoever may be the captive of the infidel of this world.</p>  
<p>Whether it be adoration unto the idol, or unto the world,<br> Still, idolators all, are the worshippers of this world.</p>  
<p>He is the true Muslim amongst the whole of the Faithful,<br> Who hath burst asunder the Hind&#363; cord&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> of this world.</p>

<p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></A></p>  
<p>Headless behind, his body remaineth, but the head will go;<br> How, then, is the possessor of a head, a head-man of this world?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>They make their sons and daughters orphans, and desert them&#8212;<br> All are unnatural&#8212;the fathers and the mothers of this world.</p>  
<p>There will be a load of misery for ever upon his head,<br> Round which may be wrapped the turban of this world.</p>  
<p>All is affliction; whether it be bought, or whether it be sold;<br> For there is nought else whatever in the b&#257;z&#257;r of this world.</p>  
<p>They cheat and impose&#8212;the whole fraternity are knaves&#8212;<br> All the buyers, and all the sellers of this world.</p>  
<p>They will never show the least affection towards it,<br> Who may be acquainted with the secrets of this world.</p>  
<p>He whose regard may be directed to religion and piety,<br> Fostereth not any hopes or expectations of this world.</p>  
<p>He who quaileth at the sight of a precipice or an abyss,<br> Will never travel upon the dangerous path of this world.</p>  
<p>The whole of its friends and associates are impostors&#8212;<br> What dependence can be placed on the deceivers of this world?</p>  
<p>Its old and its young, alike, are all rivals of each other&#8212;<br> Where is the true friend in the region of this world?</p>  
<p>Whatever may be created, the whole shall fade and perish&#8212;<br> Draw near! behold the raids and ravages of this world!</p>  
<p>Unto whom it cometh, from him it again departeth;<br> For I have well observed the gait and movements of this world.</p>

<p>Of their exits and their entrances there is no computation:<br> They are like unto the fathomless ocean that rolleth along.</p>

<p>If any one should say, He cannot be seen, verily, He cannot:<br> And should he so say, He is, in truth, apparent unto all.</p>  
<p>Without doubt and without distrust, consider Him immaculate<br> In all things soever, of which people are hard of belief.</p>  
<p>No one hath lauded Him equal unto His just deserts;<br> Neither hath any one-sufficiently resounded His praise.</p>  
<p>Out of the thousands of His excellencies and His perfections,<br> Deem not, that one, by <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</span>, hath been adequately expressed.</p>
