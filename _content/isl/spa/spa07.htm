<p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thou</span>, in heart ignorant concerning thine own soul!<br> O man, seek thou the nature of it, from the reality itself!</p>  
<p>From the refulgence of religion, acquire thou comprehension:<br> Bear away, unto the desert, this darkness of infidelity!</p>  
<p>Sin abandon; and set out towards devotion and piety!<br> This is the road, without anxiety, and from danger free.</p>  
<p>This secret praise is the lamp of truth and orthodoxy;<br> Therefore, from the Immaculate's hand, the lighted lamp take.</p>  
<p>Should perception's light become enkindled in thine heart,<br> Thou wilt, altogether, acquire life's happiness and felicity.</p>  
<p>The penetrating, and the enlightened, are spectators of both worlds;<br> But the bat flieth about in the dark, without seeing.</p>  
<p>What do I, blind that I am, know of the state of the sublime?<br> How wilt thou, from the deaf, ask the import of sound?</p>  
<p>Thou wilt comprehend, forthwith, the language of all things,<br> Shouldst thou, sagacious one! make thine heart's ear to hear.</p>  
<p>Err not, regarding the amount of attributes and properties;<br> And unto the source of the essence, bear the essence itself.</p>  
<p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></A></p>  
<p>About their own materiality, the enlightened are in torment;<br> But there can be no dread of mortality from corruption itself.</p>  
<p>Every attainer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> who hath passed beyond this nature frail,<br> Assuredly discovereth the signification of immortality.</p>  
<p>He wandereth about in the boundlessness of infinity:<br> He arrived even unto his home, that he might unity behold.</p>  
<p>That fruit, which on its own branch acquired ripeness,<br> This brief claim of its own perfection, made to the parent tree&#8212;</p>  
<p>"Notwithstanding there is not much excess in thy greatness;<br> Still, within this body of mine, do I see thee, entirely, O tree!</p>  
<p>From the first, thy root germinated from me, and flourished:<br> The development of thy purpose devolved, wholly, on me."</p>  
<p>Answer, to this effect, on the part of the tree, proceeded&#8212;<br> "Colour and flavour, O fruit! whence didst thou acquire?</p>  
<p>From one fruit, naught but a single tree is produced;<br> And the fruit of that tree is renewed, year by year."</p>  
<p>The reply from the tree, however, is here sound and wise,<br> Though the observation of its fruit is, of attention, worthy.</p>  
<p>From that, which possesseth no kernel, no corn groweth:<br> It is not advisable that any one should sow husked seed.</p>  
<p>The reputation of the servant lieth with his master;<br> And without the servant, the master's dignity is not.</p>  
<p>Invoke, then, within thine heart, the sayings of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">M&#299;rz&#257;</span>,<br> If the page of thy mind be unblotted, and unstained.</p>  
<p>

<p>When, with the mind, I examined the shoulder-bone of prediction,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> I saw that, within unity's area, the community of plenitude dwelleth.</p>  
<p>In what manner shall I describe the infiniteness of the Omniscient,<br> When all that's inscrutable, He hath drawn, like a veil, over His face?</p>  
<p>I behold, floating upon the surface of the waters, the ship of the earth;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> And on all sides, I perceive, cones of stone have protruded therefrom.</p>  
<p>For how long shall the heavenly bodies, in the firmament, revolve?<br> By what art, profound, hath the Great Sage suspended them therein?</p>  
<p>The conception of the intellect of the wise is unable to penetrate<br> Unto where the hand of, "Let it be," and "It was,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> hath reached.</p>  
<p>These unadorned heavens became arrayed with embellishments,<br> Which He, with the diamonds of omnipotence, carved out.</p>  
<p>The lamp of the sun and the moon became enkindled therein&#8212;<br> He assented not that, unrevealed, His own skill should remain.</p>  
<p>From the clouds, He caused the genial rain to descend on earth;<br> And herbs and plants of every kind he disseminated thereon.</p>  
<p>

<p>On its face, the phenomena of spring and autumn, so admirable, arose;<br> And the gradations of heat and cold were diffused throughout.</p>  
<p>From the whole achromatism of colour, that manifesteth itself,<br> The face of nature is with every tint and hue emblazoned.</p>  
<p>On all sides, where&#8217;er I cast mine eyes, of every tinge and dye,<br> The chequered carpet of the Great Chamberlain is spread out.</p>  
<p>The countless creatures that, in all directions, meet the eye,<br> Are the army of this great chess-board, in order arranged.</p>  
<p>Here, the destiny of every one, whatever he may be, is fulfilled&#8212;<br> From the game's commencement, the knights are mounted, the footmen on foot.</p>  
<p>And mankind themselves, originally, are of one origin and race;<br> Yet some rule empires, whilst others beg from door to door!</p>  
<p>Though the beasts of the field exist, from inconvenience free,<br> The whole burden of "Do" and "Refrain" is laid upon mankind.</p>  
<p>Unto every man his own private interests are the most agreeable;<br> But the decrees of the Great Judge are separately meted unto all.</p>  
<p>The mercy of the All-merciful is equally extended to all men;<br> Though some have chosen to deny Him, whilst others have obeyed.</p>  
<p>For the use of mankind were all living creatures produced;<br> And man himself created, to acquire knowledge of the truth.</p>  
<p>He, who in this life, acquireth not a perception of the nature divine,<br> Hath naught of humanity in him; and &#8217;tis just to term him a beast.</p>  
<p>Whosoever giveth ear unto the inordinate promptings of carnality,<br> Though, in outward appearance, he liveth, yet his soul is annihilated.</p>  
<p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></A></p>  
<p>Wherefore doth he give himself airs about this short existence;<br> Since, without an aim, he is standing like a sign-post in the path?</p>  
<p>Like unto the hare, with eyes wide open, he for ever sleepeth:<br> In what manner, as though entranced, shall the sleep-overcome awake?</p>  
<p>He hath abandoned the path at the counsel of the Accursed:<br> His mind is misled by hypocrisy's manifold deceits.</p>  
<p>The poor, ignorant creature is accounted a demon, and beast of prey:<br> Even worse still&#8212;he is amongst decayed carcasses numbered.</p>  
<p>His dark, confined heart is as a tomb, for his soul is dead:<br> His decked-out body, a grave, on which the mould is beaten down.</p>  
<p>His distressed and distracted mind is the emblem of the worm:<br> His sepulchre is intact: it is his soul that is devoured.</p>  
<p>He hath no peace nor tranquillity: nought else save torment:<br> Every moment overwhelmed in misery: driven away as one unclean.</p>  
<p>He possesseth not strength sufficient, the human form to support&#8212;<br> He took the deposit on his head, without calculating its weight.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Like unto the mule, it is expelled from its own kindred race,<br> That, which being one by nature, hath become, with another, mixed.</p>  
<p>Tyrant and fool that he was, he should have acted in this way&#8212;<br> He should have cried with piercing cries, and have dashed his head.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Such a ponderous load, as neither Heaven nor earth could bear,<br> By what strength could the weak, helpless, ignorant, sustain</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></A></p>  
<p>It behoveth to call for aid, with all speed, unto the perfect,<br> That they may consign the burden into the hands of the Master.</p>  
<p>Unto every wise man, who hath become released from the debt,<br> Therefrom, the hereditary gift of knowledge divine hath fallen.</p>  
<p>The gravity and importance of such knowledge the saints know;<br> Since they have sought it in the mind, and unto the world's limits.</p>  
<p>His laws and His edicts go out upon every person and thing:<br> He hath built up a wall from this crude and untempered dust.</p>  
<p>He made the inanimate to be counted among the living,<br> When He, the Immaculate, with His own breath, breathed on them.</p>  
<p>He will live for ever and ever, and death shall affect him not,<br> Through whom the Eternal hath drawn the thread of vitality.</p>  
<p>What blessed one became purified from ungodliness and scepticism?<br> He, whom the Lord of Holiness hath, with sanctity's water, cleansed.</p>  
<p>Upon the face of the waters, his lamp effulgent burneth;<br> And, like straws, infidelity and mistrust consume thereon.</p>  
<p>At his entreaty, from the stars, was ill-presage wholly removed;<br> And, thro&#8217; his good offices, no hour is accounted portentous.</p>  
<p>O M&#298;RZ&#256;! of the praises due unto the perfections of the saints,<br> Who, commensurate with their infinity, hath a tittle rendered?</p>  <h4 align="center">III</h4>

<p>Set out in pursuit of the great object of solicitude,<br> Whilst thou thy command upon the bridle retainest.</p>  
<p>The Omnipotent is, by no means, distant from thee;<br> For He is nearer unto thee, than even thine own self.</p>  
<p>Whether on the earth, or whether in the heavens,<br> The Omniscient there also is present in the midst.</p>  
<p>He became, in unity and individuality, unique:<br> In immensity, and in infinitude, He is diffused.</p>  
<p>From His divinity, He departed and advanced towards it;<br> And now, throughout the whole universe, He moveth.</p>  
<p>The limits of His boundless infinity cannot be discovered;<br> And in mankind is His abode, and His place of sojourn.</p>  
<p>He himself inflicteth, and He himself performeth;<br> And man He hath made, the motive and the plea.</p>  
<p>From every saint that hath commenced his mission,<br> Some sign, or some indication becometh manifest.</p>  
<p>The scepticism of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">M&#299;rz&#257;</span> hath vanished, and is no more;<br> But whatever is by him spoken, M&#299;&#8217;&#257;n Ro<u>s&#146;h</u>&#257;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> speaketh.</p>

<p>Tho&#8217; the object thou seekest be obscure and invisible,<br> Ride lightly, and without baggage, in following it.</p>  
<p>Its acquirement is attended with much trouble and toil:<br> Determine thou, therefore, a dauntless spirit to show.</p>  
<p>Since the lamp of love and affection is become lighted,<br> Like the moth, to-day, become thou the sacrifice thereon.</p>

<p>God is one&#8212;without partner, and without associate:<br> Forbear thou, then, from all, contrary thereto.</p>

<p>The Devil spread out for man, the snare of posterity;<br> And wealth, and various pleasures, are the baits thereon.</p>  
<p>Distinction, and fame, one of its ramparts became,<br> Whilst another of its attractions were silver and gold.</p>  
<p>He layeth out separate snares quietly, and with caution;<br> But the whole are like unto embroidery upon the carpet.</p>  
<p>He will neither be prosperous nor happy, in this world,<br> Who giveth ear unto the temptations of the Accursed.</p>  
<p>Though a whole region should fall beneath his sway;<br> Still, that man's heart will long, another to acquire.</p>

<p>The hearts of lovers ever kindle, at the loved-one's glance;<br> For &#8217;tis a flame; and her eyes are like firebrands unto.</p>  
<p>To-day she hath again lighted the lamp of her beauty;<br> And her adorers&#8217; hearts, like the moth, are oblations thereon.</p>

<p>Care and anxiety are the motives of existence;<br> But what is life unto them, that before death die?</p>
