<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> promise of the kiss, the beloved ever putteth off for to-morrow;<br> Then how can my heart place confidence in a pledge like this?</p>  
<p>Whoso is vain enough to depend upon the affairs of the future,<br> The wise and sagacious will laugh that foolish man to scorn.</p>  
<p>My friend is not acquainted with the deceitfulness of the world;<br> Yet still she deceiveth, having, in her heart, naught of truthfulness.</p>  
<p>Do not presume to this degree, upon the loveliness of the face:<br> Behold the autumn! doth it ever, to the rose, any bloom impart?</p>  
<p>Thou, who through arrogance, attest thus falsely towards me;<br> Time will pay back unto thee the requital of these deeds of thine.</p>  
<p>In the land of association, the appliances of pleasure will be many;<br> But the troops of bereavement, full speedily, lay it waste.</p>  
<p>Never cast thou thine eyes upon the rose, O nightingale!<br> For separation will make those fresh wounds of thine still worse.</p>  
<p>But is the nightingale wont, through advice, the rose to forswear?<br> No! &#8217;tis the blast of autumn only that separateth them by force!</p>  
<p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></A></p>  
<p>Full many have departed in sorrow, with the hope of to-morrow;<br> Then who will place any reliance on life's fidelity to-day?</p>  
<p>Thou, who in the hope of existence therefrom, restest in tranquillity<br> Doth the empyrean ever any opportunity for continuance allow?</p>  
<p>To-day, I perceive the crisis of a contingency on the world impending;<br> But the future may make apparent unto it some other event.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Severed</span> had never beheld Bij&#257;p&#363;r, even in his dreams;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> But, at last, that presenteth itself, which his destiny decreed!</p>  <h4 align="center">II.</h4>  
<p>When, in the shape of a shield, the hair on the forehead is plaited&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A><br> The roses wreathed therein, impart the intrinsic virtues of the sun.</p>  
<p>The live-coal-like ruby in her nose jewel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A> is fire itself;<br> And the red bul&#257;&#7731;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_309"></A><A HREF="#fn_309"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;&sect;</FONT></A> like unto a spark of fire, is placed by its side.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>The chamkala&#8217;&#299;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_310"></A><A HREF="#fn_310"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> on her forehead is hence red with her lover's blood,<br> That every jewel therein, for piercing, is like a lancet disposed.</p>  
<p>Her eyebrows are a bent bow; her eyelashes, arrows adjusted:<br> The ornaments of beauty are sometimes a sword; at others, a dagger made.</p>  
<p>The devotee of a hundred years is, with one of her glances undone,<br> When she decketh out her beauteous person, and goeth forth.</p>  
<p>When she disposeth her flowing tresses in curls about her face,<br> To the Ethiop army she accordeth permission, devastation to make.</p>  
<p>Her dark eyes she maketh still more black, by the antimony;<br> And every eyelash she will make moist in her lover's blood.</p>  
<p>Soft and tender tales she telleth, but they are all dissimulation:<br> She casteth her enchantments round the heart, by pretexts and pleas.</p>  
<p>For her lover, Tartarus and Elysium are ready provided;<br> Since the sweet Paradise of conjunction, separation turneth to Hell.</p>  
<p>The shadow of love is, undoubtedly, the philosopher's stone;<br> Since upon whomever it may be rubbed, his body is turned to gold.</p>  
<p>The punishment is death, in the creed of passion's votaries,<br> For him, who entereth love's path, and feareth its struggles and strife.</p>  
<p>Never let him, at any time, gaze upon the face of the beloved,<br> Who may be partial unto life, and for his head may fear.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="green">p. 254</font></A></p>  
<p>Like unto the inroads the heart-ravishers make my heart upon&#8212;<br> When do the <u>Kh</u>aibar&#299;s such upon the Mu<u>gh</u>als&#8217; heads ever make?</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Separated</span> will not, thro&#8217; injustice, turn his back to the beloved;<br> Though she should make his body red with blood all over!</p>  <h4 align="center">III.</h4>  
<p>With the scar of sorrow, he will his own heart afflict,<br> If, on the world's affairs, any one should reliance place.</p>  
<p>Do not grow vain of its favour; for all is deception:<br> Do not imagine, that, in reality, it benevolence showeth.</p>  
<p>When it did not act faithfully with those that have gone,<br> Whoever seeketh constancy from it to-day, erreth greatly.</p>  
<p>The foundation of all its acts is on injustice based:<br> From the age hope not for good faith; for it knoweth it not.</p>  
<p>Do not pride thyself on the friendship of that friend,<br> Who, in the same breath, in a thousand other places smileth.</p>  
<p>I place not an hour's reliance on the permanence of life:<br> He is a fool who nourisheth great hopes of immutability.</p>  
<p>All those splendid edifices, that thou, in the world, beholdest,<br> Cruel destiny, at last, will them to a naked desert turn.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Separated</span>, in the Dakhan, would not have a moment stayed;<br> But when doth fate ever fulfil our wishes and requests!</p>  <h4 align="center">IV.</h4>  
<p>What shall I say unto any one regarding the anguish of separation?<br> Since it hath not even left within me the power to complain!</p>  
<p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="green">p. 255</font></A></p>  
<p>Since every injury she heapeth upon me is right and lawful;<br> At least, let the proud one stand once with face towards me.</p>  
<p>The gold bracelets upon her wrists make an amazing display:<br> Fit Let them never become broken from the disasters of fate!</p>  
<p>For my case, O physician! thou ever showest commiseration&#8212;<br> Thou sayest, "by antidotes, thou wilt be from thy afflictions relieved."</p>  
<p>The diseases of the body thou knowest, without doubt;<br> But when is the agony of the heart laid bare unto thee?</p>  
<p><u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>ak that I am, with exile I am never content;<br> But affection for my friend hath from my kin severed me.</p>  
<p>The grief of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Separated</span> shall be changed into gladness,<br> If any one, from the tavern, shall bring wine unto me.</p>  <h4 align="center">V.</h4>  
<p>Like as absence from the beloved hath made day dark to me,<br> Let there never be, unto any one, such a dark and lurid day!</p>  
<p>Do not be overjoyed, O marplot! on account of my disjunction;<br> For at last, dark and overcast like this, shall be thy day!</p>  
<p>Though constancy may grant to no one the opportunity of association,<br> The night of separation, at last, shall become the unclouded day!</p>  
<p>The spring-time of youth was, than the flowers more pleasant;<br> But, alas! it was not so very lasting, the constancy of that day!</p>  
<p>Draw near, O friend, and honour me with a sight of thee!<br> For the Almighty hath not in the world created an unchanging day!</p>  
<p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></A></p>  
<p>Thou that ever puttest off, for to-morrow, the promise of meeting,<br> Consider what phase may be assumed by to-morrow's day!</p>  
<p>The day of delight and pleasure hath passed, as the wind, away&#8212;<br> For how long shall malice on me be vented by trouble's day!</p>  
<p>TTruly, it will be, at last, like the wind that hath passed away,<br> This, that I now behold&#8212;separation's long, dreary day!</p>  
<p>The grief and joy of fortune's changes shall not last for aye:<br> Verily, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Separated</span>! it shall reach its end, this oppression's day!</p>  <h4 align="center">VI.</h4>  
<p>Account as wind or as dust, the world's pains and pleasures:<br> The free man is not disquieted, by either its troubles or its cares.</p>  
<p>Their coming, and their going, are more speedy than the dawn;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_311"></A><A HREF="#fn_311"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> For I have, myself, experienced the heat and the cold of time.</p>  
<p>Show thou no hankering for the fare on the board of fortune;<br> For there is not a morsel thereon, free from bitterness and woe.</p>  
<p>In a moment it produceth forms and figures of manifold fashions&#8212;<br> As a mere throw of the dice account the revolutions of fate.</p>  
<p>Whoso may plume himself on a lucky turn of good fortune,<br> It dealeth him a painful wound, at the moment of exulting thereon.</p>  
<p>If, with the eye of understanding, its sorrows and joys be viewed,<br> The permanence of their duration is, than that of the flower no more.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="green">p. 257</font></A></p>  
<p>Turn thy back, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Separated</span>! unto evil; thy face towards good,<br> That, on the Great Day of Assembly,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_312"></A><A HREF="#fn_312"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> thou mayest not, with fear, be pale.</p>  <h4 align="center">VII.</h4>  
<p>In love for thee, O never let my heart grow cold<br> Like thine, that in perpetrating injustice, never groweth cold!</p>  
<p>When will any one a true and sincere lover style me,<br> If my heart, in grief for thee, unto constancy turn cold?</p>  
<p>No! my heart shall never wax cold unto faithfulness;<br> Nor, in this world, will thy nature, unto tyranny grow cold.</p>  
<p>Nal, with all his wrongs, did not his back on Daman turn;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_313"></A><A HREF="#fn_313"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> Then how can any one's heart now, unto thee turn cold?</p>  
<p>What clamour did the unscathed raise on him always;<br> Yet the love of Majn&#363;n for his Layl&#257; grew not cold.</p>  
<p>Advisers would, unto him, good counsel ever give?<br> But no admonitions made W&#257;mik, unto &AElig;a&#7827;r&#257; cold!</p>  
<p>Neither did the world show constancy unto the departed;<br> Nor have the souls of the covetous, unto the world grown cold.</p>  
<p>My burnt-up heart hath become as fresh at a sight of thee,<br> As the seed of sweet basil maketh the heat-stricken cold.</p>  
<p>The hope of my meeting hath cooled the fever of absence;<br> And the perspiration of recovery always maketh the feverish cold.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="green">p. 258</font></A></p>  
<p>Even at thy death, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Separated</span> will not thy love renounce;<br> And forsworn is he, if, in life, his heart unto thee turn cold!</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII.</h4>  
<p>O thou, who pridest thyself on the plenitude of the world's wealth!<br> How is it that the condition of thy forefathers restraineth thee not?</p>  
<p>Their obvious existence, than that of the flowers hath been less;<br> Place then no reliance upon the mere phantasies of the world.</p>  
<p>What is it to thee, though the face of the earth be broad?<br> But three yards, in its bosom, is all thy portion thereof.</p>  
<p>Since, beneath the earth's surface, thy abode is appointed,<br> Fruitlessly, upon it, thou buildest thy mansions and thy courts.</p>  
<p>Gaiety and enjoyment are intended for the callous and unconscious;<br> But sorrow and concern are, wholly, the portion of the enlightened.</p>  
<p>The votaries of the world are all tyrants and oppressors;<br> From any one of them, of faithfulness, I have never yet heard.</p>  
<p>They evince not a particle of shame, even in humanity's name:<br> They worry and rend each other, like unto ravenous beasts.</p>  
<p>Outwardly, they may practise the appearance of friendship;<br> But the heart of every man is filled with opposition and strife.</p>  
<p>Those deceptions that the world's sons now-a-day practise,<br> Even the fox would not be guilty of such wiles and deceits.</p>  
<p>Weep not, though thou shouldst experience adversity's frowns!<br> For the evils and afflictions of this transient world shall not endure.</p>  
<p>With the true and sincere, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Separated</span>! love and affection are good;<br> But with the deceitful, friendship advantageth not the least.</p>  
<p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="green">p. 259</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
<p>Since I am ever hopeful of meeting thee, either to day or to-morrow,<br> Uselessly, in this insane idea, passeth my sweet life away.</p>  
<p>With cries and supplications, I seek it to-day, but find it not;<br> For the soldiery of separation destroy the period of my joy.</p>  
<p>The tree of prosperity yielded not to me the fruit of my desires:<br> In wails and lamentations, unjustly, my body I wearied make.</p>  
<p>In the beginning, when the tree of affection was created,<br> Its innate properties brought forth absence's bitter fruit.</p>  
<p>I was wont, unconsciously, to eat of the fruit of separation,<br> When, in the garden, I planted affection's tender sprout.</p>  
<p>In disjunction, O friends! I perceive no fault whatever:<br> The heart, this misfortune permitteth, when acquainted therewith.</p>  
<p>With the sword of separation, He cleaveth asunder, at last,<br> The heart of him, whom He, of a lovely face, enamoured maketh.</p>  
<p>The game of absence, He at that time made so absorbing,<br> When, in the world, He thus the mart of affection thronged.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Separated</span> mentioned not, unto a soul, the secret of love;<br> But, in the alley of his beloved, the world humiliated him.</p>  <h4 align="center">X.</h4>  
<p>When He, of His omnipotence, first the pen produced,<br> The destiny of every one, He then with its tongue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> wrote down.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="green">p. 260</font></A></p>  
<p>To-day, at every respiration, that allotment arriveth&#8212;<br> To the share of some, He joy assigned; to the lot of others, grief.</p>  
<p>By strife and contention now, he cannot great become,<br> Who, from all eternity, was entered in an inferior degree.</p>  
<p>Thro&#8217; the hatred of the envious, never can become crooked&#8212;<br> The lot of him, which, in the beginning, He made straight.</p>  
<p>When doth death seize the skirt of any one, out of season?<br> Yet they will not tarry a moment, whose time is fulfilled.</p>  
<p>The will of destiny ejected him from the abode of bliss;<br> And then it charged unfortunate Adam with the sin.</p>  
<p>At the wounds of fortune, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Separated</span>! do not sigh;<br> For God hath, for the stricken, prepared a wondrous salve!</p>  <h4 align="center">XI.</h4>  
<p>Whoever dwelleth in this abode of calamity and affliction,<br> For every one, there is trouble, each according to his case.</p>  
<p>I seek after a place of safety, but I am unable to find one;<br> The world, to this degree, is so full of misery and woe:</p>  
<p>Though fortune may, a thousand joys, on thee bestow,<br> With one affliction, it trampleth them all in the dust.</p>  
<p>Neither is its most propitious time worthy of rejoicing;<br> Nor is its most portentous hour for lamentation befitting.</p>  
<p>Be not cast down at its sorrows, for they do not continue;<br> And with its pleasures also, do not thou grow overjoyed.</p>  
<p>If fortune grant unto thee an interview with a pretty one,<br> With the sting of separation, it speedily pierceth thy heart.</p>  
<p><a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="green">p. 261</font></A></p>  
<p>Prosperity never entereth within the precincts of one's abode,<br> Until misery and adversity its companions it maketh.</p>  
<p>Good fortune, by its own words, saith, "I am not lasting,"<br> If thou shouldst but reverse the letters of that word.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_315"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The pigeon of vitality, it bringeth quickly down from its flight,<br> When the falcon of destiny spreadeth its pillions to the wind.</p>  
<p>It draweth, without pretext, the dragon from the cave:<br> From the river it extracteth the fish, weak and paralyzed.</p>  
<p>There is no cause for arrogance in life's immutability;<br> For it passeth by like the wind, both month and year.</p>  
<p>Like a fool, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Separated</span>! do not thou its slave become;<br> For the world's joys and sorrows are a phantom and a dream!</p>  <h4 align="center">XII.</h4>  
<p>Whoever have fattened on the fleeting wealth of the world,<br> The worms of the earth, at last, have become glutted with them!</p>  
<p>The world's great ones too, whose history the books relate,<br> One after the other have fallen, slaughtered by the knife of death!</p>  
<p>Their wealth, lands, and mansions, they have transmitted to others:<br> Body by body, they have fallen asleep in the house of the tomb!</p>  
<p>Of the empty adulations of the world, they were amazingly vain;<br> But they were overcome with regret, when the time of departure came.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="green">p. 262</font></A></p>  
<p>Seeing that the world showed no constancy to the departed,<br> How are those who remain, so ardent, to-day, in its pursuit?</p>  
<p>The world is a faithless bride, that destroyeth her husband;<br> Hence the wise, for this reason, are to her friendship so cold.</p>  
<p>The flowers, that every season bloomed in the garden so sweetly,<br> Have likewise, in the autumn, thus been scattered to the winds.</p>  
<p>O thou, of vain pleasures so proud! for thy departure prepare!<br> Thy cotemporaries have grown weary in looking out for thee!</p>  
<p>Behold these graves! say, what wilt thou with gardens do?<br> Look upon thy dear friends! observe what they have become!</p>  
<p>Bend thy looks upon them&#8212;comely youths, and youthful brides!<br> Separate from each other, in their graves they have withered away!</p>  
<p>By virtuous actions, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Separated</span>! Heaven is attainable;<br> Then never follow in the way of those who have gone astray.</p>  <h4 align="center">XIII.</h4>  
<p>For the soul's journey, the white steed became saddled in the heart,<br> When upon my chin grew white the hair of youthful days.</p>  
<p>When the spring-time of youth unto the body bade adieu,<br> The black hair waxed silvery in the autumn of old age.</p>  
<p>Since the miseries of absence have not reduced them to ashes;<br> What! have these bones of my body, all, into iron turned?</p>  
<p>Either my good fortune, fallen asleep, giveth me no aid,<br> Or the rulers of the present age have stony-hearted grown.</p>  
<p>Whereas the heads thereof make no impression on their bodies,<br> On their armour must have broken the arrows of my sighs.</p>  
<p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="green">p. 263</font></A></p>  
<p>Sorrow, to this degree, causeth the blood from mine eyes to flow,<br> That the garments of my body have become tinged therefrom.</p>  
<p>Behold the state of my eyeballs, by separation caused!<br> They have assumed the appearance of red roses within the parterre!</p>  
<p>Though in the heart it may not have fallen, woe's seed sprouteth,<br> When, by the plough of disjunction, its ground-plot may be turned.</p>  
<p>Would, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Separated</span>! that absence were, in the world, unknown;<br> For from its inroads have become desolate the people thereof!</p>  <h4 align="center">XIV.</h4>  
<p>Of the pangs of separation I became deserving that day,<br> When, weeping and sobbing, from my love I was severed.</p>  
<p>At that time, for my life, in tears of blood I mourned,<br> When, turning my back upon A<u>tt</u>ak, I weeping began.</p>  
<p>How shall I now pine after the rocks and shrubs of my country?<br> For, having made my parting salutation, I bade them farewell.</p>  
<p>Embedded in my heart, from Roh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_316"></A><A HREF="#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> an arrow I brought away&#8212;<br> I failed to bid adieu to my bower, or its sacrifice to become.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>With much toil, in the world I had a garden laid out;<br> And, as yet, I had not smelt a flower, when from it I was torn.</p>  
<p>The blue heavens laughed from delight until they grew red,<br> When facing Ho<u>dd</u>aey's mountain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_318"></A><A HREF="#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> I turned from it away.</p>  
<p>There is no magician in the Dakhan that can charm me;<br> For I am a prisoner become, in a dragon's cavern profound.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="green">p. 264</font></A></p>  
<p>The assignment of union was hung on the horns of the deer,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_319"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> When I crossed to the other bank of Narbada's swift stream.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_320"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The riches of association were a hoard that I gloated over;<br> But in absence's wars, I have to a mere thread and fibre changed.</p>  
<p>How shall I, to-day, complain of bereavement unto any one?<br> I, myself, made a purchase of sorrow, when I a lover became.</p>  
<p>The vast dust of separation hath hidden happiness from me&#8212;<br> I am utterly weary grown at the noise of summoning it back.</p>  
<p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>ak</span>, call unto my beloved, but she is not forthcoming:<br> Mortified and despairing thereat, I have become wedded unto woe!</p>  <h4 align="center">XV.</h4>  
<p>Come, my love! let us, in one home, our abode take up;<br> And from our minds dismiss all long and lingering hope!</p>  
<p>Hand in hand we will saunter about; for such is fortunate:<br> It is not advisable that to-day's inclinations we for to-morrow defer.</p>  
<p>From all eternity, revolving fortune is cruel and unjust:<br> It is a fallacy if we, to-day, nourish a hope of its constancy.</p>  
<p>We were many friends, like unto a flock, gathered together,<br> When the wolf of separation, by violence, tore us from each other away.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="green">p. 265</font></A></p>  
<p>Our dear, dear friends have from the world departed:<br> How long then shall we exist in this sublunary sphere?</p>  
<p>How can any one the hope of joy and happiness entertain?<br> For He brought us into this abode, grief and misery to endure!</p>  
<p>Living, O friend! <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Separated</span> would not have left thee;<br> But &#8217;tis the king's tyranny that hath, by force, parted us!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_321"></A><A HREF="#fn_321"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  <h4 align="center">XVI.</h4>  
<p>The wise, for this reason, unto the world's affairs will be cold;<br> That all its griefs are like the blast, and like the dust its joys.</p>  
<p>Do not, O Darwe<u>sh</u>! false account my sorrow and my sighs;<br> For, at that time, the eyes will weep, when the heart may aching be.</p>  
<p>The head of courage will not bow for the sake of throne and crown;<br> When the man, of spirit free, may know what the world's gifts are.</p>  
<p>That man, who may traffic in perfidiousness, and in iniquity,<br> Will be pale and ghastly, when he entereth the assembly of the just.</p>  
<p>In the estimation of the wise, even worse than the ox they are,<br> Who may be constantly overwhelmed in gluttony's cares.</p>  
<p>The revolving heavens are a mill, and man the grain therein:<br> He is no sooner in the world, than he will into meal be ground.</p>  
<p>It is out of the question altogether, that in Pu<u>s&#146;h</u>to any other bard,<br> Shall, like <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Separated</span>, so unrivalled, in the art poetic be.</p>

<p>Completely false and lying are they all, from first to last,<br> Who are gathered around the table of the transient world!</p>  
<p>The universe is like unto the shop of the sweetmeat-seller:<br> Account its resorters nothing else but the flies that they are!</p>  
<p>The degree of affection, that the flies in that quarter bestow,<br> Is according to the quality of the sweets therein contained.</p>  
<p>Place no reliance soever upon the mere display of their sincerity:<br> Falsely, they deception practise: they are their own weal's friends!</p>  
<p>In the day of prosperity, of constancy, they ever make boast;<br> But when a slight disaster occurreth, they all take to flight.</p>  
<p>The heart's eyes, for its own objects, show sycophancy to the tongue;<br> Then do not pride thyself on their oaths; for all are knaves.</p>  
<p>Should they become aware of a good friend's affliction,<br> Their tongues cry, "Dear! dear!" but they exult in their hearts.</p>  
<p>Hope not, in this world, to find a friend, sincere and true;<br> For the sons of the present day are hypocrites and rogues.</p>  
<p>There is neither love, nor affection, nor friendship in them:<br> By some craft they acquire; for they are all the loaf's slaves.</p>  
<p>The world's interests and profits are their object, and these they pursue:<br> They are neither stedfast on faith's path, nor infidels are they.</p>  
<p>Like as they plot against the very heart's blood of one another,<br> In hatching each other's ruin are wolves ever thus occupied?</p>  
<p><a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="green">p. 267</font></A></p>  
<p>As yet, the day of doom hath not been viewed by human eye;<br> But its operations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_322"></A><A HREF="#fn_322"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> I, to-day, perceive; since all are for themselves.</p>  
<p>Never yet have I found, in any one, either fidelity or truth;<br> Whether it be in brethren or kinsmen, in relations or friends!</p>  
<p>Since I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Separated</span>, became acquainted with its secrets,<br> I find the world hath countless women, and but few, few men!</p>
