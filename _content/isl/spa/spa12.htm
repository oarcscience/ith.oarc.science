<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A<u>sh</u>raf <u>Kh</u>&#257;n</span>, eldest son of <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l <u>Kh</u>&#257;n, the subject of the preceding notice, was born in the year <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">h.</span> 1044 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1634); and when the war, which had been carried on by his father and other Af<u>gh</u>&#257;n chieftains, against the Mu<u>gh</u>al Emperor, died out, <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l, wholly disgusted with the world, resigned the chieftainship of the <u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>ak tribe in favour of A<u>sh</u>raf, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 1093 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1681.) The circumstances, which brought these matters about, having been related at length in the notice preceding <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>&#7717;&#257;l's poems, need not be repeated here.</p>  
<p>A<u>sh</u>raf endeavoured for some time to carry on the government of his clan, and also to perform his duties towards the Mu<u>gh</u>al Government, by aiding the Pe<u>s&#146;h</u>&#257;war authorities in the administration of the affairs of that province; but he was opposed and thwarted in all his endeavours by his brother Bahr&#257;m, the same who endeavoured to take the life of his father, who styles him "Bahr&#257;m the Degenerate," and "The Malignant;" and by whose machinations, A<u>sh</u>raf was, at last, betrayed into the hands of Aurangzeb, in the year <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">h.</span> 1095 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1683). The affairs of the Dakhan having called for the presence of that monarch, who continued in that part of India for several years, the <u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>ak chief was taken along with him, as a state prisoner; and was subsequently sent to the strong fortress of Bij&#257;p&#363;r, situated in what is, at present, termed the Southern Mah&#257;rata country, where he continued to languish in exile for the remainder of his life. He died in the year <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">h.</span> 1105 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1693), and in the 60th year of his age.</p>

<p>A<u>sh</u>raf used, occasionally, to devote some of his leisure time to poetry, before he assumed the government of his clan, incited, doubtless, by the example of his brave old father, and his brothers &AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir and &#7778;adr <u>Kh</u>&#257;n, who were also gifted with the "<i>caco&euml;thes scribendi</i>." During his exile he wrote a great number of poems, and collected the whole, as they now stand, in the form of a D&#299;w&#257;n, or Alphabetical Collection. According to the usual custom among Eastern poets, A<u>sh</u>raf assumed the name of "The Severed" or "Exiled;" and many of his poems, written in the most pathetic style, plainly tell where, and under what circumstances, they were composed. The original D&#299;w&#257;n, or Collection, arranged and written by himself, at Bij&#257;p&#363;r, is still in the possession of his descendants, and from it the following poems were extracted; indeed, I am not aware that any other copy of his poems exists. A<u>sh</u>raf is regarded by the Af<u>gh</u>&#257;ns as a good poet; but his effusions are, without reason apparently, considered difficult and abstruse.</p>  
<p>When Af&#7827;al <u>Kh</u>&#257;n, his son, became firmly established in the chieftainship, he caused the remains of his father to be removed from Bij&#257;p&#363;r to Sar&#257;&#8217;e&#8212;where the <u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>ak chiefs have been usually interred&#8212;a distance of some fifteen hundred miles.</p>
