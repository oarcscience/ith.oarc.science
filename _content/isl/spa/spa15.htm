<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arise</span>, O cupbearer! bring the goblet; for see, the leaves burst forth!<br> They give, unto the parterre, the happy tidings of the coming of spring.</p>  
<p>In thy wine there is the intoxication of uniformity and sincerity,<br> That changeth my intellect's black and white to one uniform tinge.</p>  
<p>Like unto ice, shall the heart of the tale-bearer melt away altogether,<br> If the beloved, unto me, will show her countenance like the sun.</p>  
<p>The black-eyed ones have not the fragrance of constancy within them;<br> On this point, regarding them, what hope shall any one indulge?</p>  
<p>He, who may be existing on affection and love, never, never, dieth;<br> And the Almighty, too, is competent, my life, eternal to make.</p>  
<p>With the whole heart she hath made away; but, even yet, behold<br> What enchantments, charms, deceits, and spells she employeth still!</p>  
<p>What! hath <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>, this time, so benefited by her,<br> That he will place this much confidence in the beloved again?</p>  
<p><a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="green">p. 272</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">II.</h4>  
<p>If I have my own friend chosen, with the censure attendant thereon;<br> The world's calumny and detraction I have accepted likewise.</p>  
<p>The pangs of separation from her would not have been so great,<br> Had I, when enjoying her society, constantly lamented and wept.</p>  
<p>Like unto the bee, I would have clasped the rose for ever to my breast,<br> Had I perceived in it the fragrance of constancy and faith.</p>  
<p>They who, without asking, bestow, and mention not the obligation,<br> The generosity of them, above all others, have I ever preferred.</p>  
<p>For this reason, the envious wandereth about from door to door,<br> Because I have driven him away from the threshold of my abode.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>, at that time, everlasting life acquired,<br> When, with the sword of her glances, she deprived me of life.</p>  <h4 align="center">III.</h4>  
<p>Behold! the bee and the nightingale great folly commit,<br> Who, whilst the autumn is impending, give their love to the rose!</p>  
<p>For how long shall this lamp in the garden continue to burn?<br> One day, the cold, boisterous blast of destiny shall extinguish it!</p>  
<p>Totally changed to repulsiveness, in the morning becometh<br> The prettiness of the glow-worm, that, at night, giveth such effulgence and light.</p>  
<p><a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="green">p. 273</font></A></p>  
<p>The covert polytheist, equally with the open, appeareth unto them;<br> For when do the sanctified, to the whole or the parts, cast their eyes?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The rose-bud openeth from the effect of the dew's moisture;<br> But the humidity of wine rendereth still harder the niggard's heart.</p>  
<p>The spectators would declare the many beauties of her countenance;<br> But amazement calleth out to them the more silent to remain.</p>  
<p>Thy pen, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>! became, of musk, the diffuser;<br> Since thou greatly praisest the curls and ringlets of the fair.</p>  <h4 align="center">IV.</h4>  
<p>Whether it be chieftainship, or lordliness, or a monarch's sway;<br> If thou perceivest, they are all fruitless trouble and anxiety.</p>  
<p>Without the fair, both life and death, are one and the sane thing;<br> For the sake of the dear ones, alone, is existence of any usefulness.</p>  
<p>By fate, the curls of the beloved must have been destined<br> For the derangement and disorder of my heart, from the beginning of time.</p>  
<p>It is through inebriation, that the goblet hath fallen to the ground:<br> Account it not rage or anger, O cupbearer! &#8217;tis but the levity of youth.</p>  
<p>At the errors of the wise, indignation and reproach are levelled;<br> But the excuse of fools is their own ignorance and foolishness.</p>  
<p>Thou wilt either give some one's dwelling to the flames, or shed his blood;<br> Seeing that thou hast donned garments of the Ar<u>gh</u>ow&#257;n's red hue.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>

<p>The fire of love shall come forth from the earth over the graves<br> Of all, whose affection for their love, from the soul itself, proceedeth.</p>  
<p>I will leave the walls of the cloister, and go out unto the tavern;<br> For therein is to be found safety from this, and the next world's ills.</p>  
<p>The universe lieth under the seal of content and resignation:<br> Shouldst thou draw it on thy finger, it is Sul&#299;m&#257;n's magic ring.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The red tears that course each other down thy cheeks, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>!<br> Are a sumptuous banquet of rubies for thine own dear friend.</p>  <h4 align="center">V.</h4>  
<p>When I beheld the beloved with my rivals associated,<br> I would cry out and complain, coupled with piercing cries.</p>  
<p>The mirror of the heart becometh bright through humility;<br> Hence, too, the meek and lowly are conjoined with the dust.</p>  
<p>&#8217;Twas from the heart's anguish, that the nightingale bewailed,<br> Because he perceived the sharp thorn with the rose entwined.</p>  
<p>But like unto a thorn, indeed, every flower my heart pierceth,<br> Whenever, without thee with me, I enter the parterre.</p>  
<p>Through thy curls my heart hath become utterly deranged:<br> Let not then, O God, any Muslim be with Hind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> connected!</p>

<p>Folly keepeth the fool ever occupied in delight and pleasure;<br> But prudence immerseth the wise in the river of care and woe.</p>  
<p>Since, at last, departure therefrom is with great grief attended,<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span> will have naught to do with this place of spring.</p>  <h4 align="center">VI.</h4>  
<p>Although it may be bitter, still swallow the wine of thy wrath:<br> Act not unjustly or tyrannically towards any one, upright man!</p>  
<p>The falcon, that drinketh the blood of his quarry, dieth full soon:<br> Restrain thyself, then, my heart! from such ensanguined food.</p>  
<p>There is no need of manacle, or fetter, or dungeon, to restrain them;<br> For the words of the wise are fettered in the prison of the mouth.</p>  
<p>Every mild and gentle being, who clemency's armour weareth,<br> Is not pierced with the arrows of fortune's reverses and mishaps.</p>  
<p>He who falleth from the heart's high rock is dashed to atoms:<br> Let not the Almighty, then, cast any one from such a rock as this!</p>  
<p>Though men, in origin are one, yet their diversity is excessive;<br> Since one is equal to one, one to a hundred, one to a thousand others.</p>  
<p>For a single <i>din&#257;r</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> a hundred pearls may be purchased;<br> And a single pearl is, likewise, for a hundred <i>din&#257;rs</i> bought.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="green">p. 276</font></A></p>  
<p>Whether monarch, or whether nobles, thou thyself shalt outvie them;<br> For thou, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>! on any one, placest not thy hopes.</p>  <h4 align="center">VII.</h4>  
<p>Why scornest thou me, O fair one! who so ill-favoured am?<br> &#8217;Tis destiny's doings that made me ungraceful; thee, lovely to behold!</p>  
<p>Come once again, and upon the flowers cast thine eyes once more,<br> O zephyr of the morn! that thou mayest unclose the folded bud anew!</p>  
<p>In thy absence, the rose would tear its own breast into a hundred shreds;<br> And the cypress, O charmer! from separation, would in tears dissolve.</p>  
<p>Why, O rose! turnest thou thy face away from the lovelorn nightingale?<br> For even with these charms of thine, his wails have famous made thee.</p>  
<p>When thou castest the fragrant <i>&aelig;&#363;d</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_328"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> into the fire, it yieldeth more perfume;<br> And I will constancy increase, if thou thy injustice shouldst augment.</p>  
<p>Thou art the sun of beauty, and all these other beauteous ones are stars:<br> They will into nothingness vanish, if thou shouldst show thy face.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="green">p. 277</font></A></p>  
<p>Thou always designatest <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span> as hypocrite and deceiver;<br> But mayest thou, elsewhere, a more sincere lover find than he!</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII.</h4>  
<p>Was it a pearl that was observed the nose jewel within,<br> Or was it a sparkling dew-drop upon the Ar<u>gh</u>ow&#257;n's breast?</p>  
<p>Musk-deer from far-off <u>Kh</u>ut&#x324;an are both those eyes of thine,<br> That ever graze the spikenard and sweet basil upon.</p>  
<p>I can discover naught on earth in comparison to thine eyebrows;<br> But I have found somewhat of similarity in the heaven's arch.</p>  
<p>What connection is there between pearls and the teeth of the dear one?<br> Those are in the oyster's bosom&#8212;the teeth are in her mouth.</p>  
<p>Because the poets were wont with thy lips to compare it,<br> The ruby became mortified, and fled back to the mine,</p>  
<p>No one is capable of giving an explanation of their sweetness;<br> For the ambrosial nectar of Paradise is indigenous to thy lips.</p>  
<p>When I look upon thy face, I am at the Almighty's works amazed,<br> Seeing that He preserveth thee safe and uninjured from its glow.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>I have well examined the display of the flowers of the universe;<br> But there is no flower like thee in any one of its parterres.</p>  
<p>In gratitude, that He hath bestowed such curls upon thee,<br> By them, draw out those immersed in the well of thy chin!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="green">p. 278</font></A></p>  
<p>Those in thy presence, from modesty, know not what to say;<br> Whilst those absent, describe thee by metaphor and simile.</p>  
<p>Close well, then, thine eyes, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>! all things upon;<br> And then, within thyself, do thou the whole universe survey!</p>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
<p>At last, he will depart from it, his heart with anguish seared;<br> Bootlessly, then, the gardener prideth himself on this parterre!</p>  
<p>They who may have entered within the tavern of the world,<br> Shall all, in their turn, drink out of death's fatal cup!</p>  
<p>He merely guardeth the portion of others, for they will take it;<br> Wherefore, then, is the rich man of his wealth so very vain?</p>  
<p>He doth not revel, like the nightingale, among the roses;<br> But he sitteth perched, like a crow, a rotten carcass upon.</p>  
<p>Sovereigns search about for it, but by beggars it is found;<br> Whether it be rest, or tranquillity; or peace, or repose.</p>  
<p>The radiance of the lamp cannot be found within the tomb,<br> Except thou shouldst the lamp of sighs carry with thee there.</p>  
<p>These are red tears thou seest, by unhappy Majn&#363;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> shed;<br> For the tulip hath not bloomed, either in upland or in mead.</p>  
<p>Set out, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>! upon the path of inexistence;<br> Haply thou mayest find therein trace of the dear one's door!</p>  <h4 align="center">X.</h4>  
<p>Whereas the oyster with a single drop of rain-water is satisfied,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> Its priceless pearls go out into every country, and every clime.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="green">p. 279</font></A></p>  
<p>If thou seek after honour, be then with thy lot content!<br> Shouldst thou to eminence aspire, of what thou hast, liberally give!</p>  
<p>The ties of the wealth of the world are the bonds of Hell;<br> Hence the free and noble placed it on the palms of their hands.</p>  
<p>L have with mine own eyes well watched the world's people&#8212;<br> One amasseth wealth with great avarice; another wasteth it away.</p>  
<p>Since life itself is not perpetual, what then advantageth it,<br> Though one, in magnificence, a Sul&#299;m&#257;n, or an A&#7779;af&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> be?</p>  
<p>A man's superiority, in wisdom and knowledge consisteth;<br> The beast's, in grazing; and on hay, and on grass, growing fat.</p>  
<p>If thou art magnanimous, pain not the hearts of others;<br> But make thine heart the target of the arrows of good and bad!</p>  
<p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>! have the fear of God ever before thee;<br> For unto them that fear, He hath said, "Fear thou not!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  <h4 align="center">XI.</h4>  
<p>This exclamation from the nightingale at day-dawn reached my ear&#8212;<br> "O rose! thy merriment hath plunged me into sorrow and tears!"</p>  
<p>Its languid effect is far more exquisite than its intoxication;<br> But the sleepy languor of thine eyes exceedeth that of wine.</p>  
<p>The fair ones of the present day are worshippers of Mammon&#8212;<br> In their alley, without wealth's appliances, place not thy foot!</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_280"><font size="1" color="green">p. 280</font></A></p>  
<p>My love for the dear one increaseth from thy detractions;<br> Then, O traducer! as much as thy heart desireth disparage her!</p>  
<p>From distressing thoughts and cares the mind becometh distracted;<br> But the heart acquireth comfort from reliance and resignation.</p>  
<p>May the Almighty never leave those eyes from albugo free,<br> Which, when thy face may be visible, shall look upon a rose!</p>  
<p>Thou art, when seated, the light of the whole assembly:<br> What matter, then, tho&#8217; the dawn of day the lamp extinguish?</p>  
<p>When thou givest me wine, laugh heartily, O cupbearer!<br> Learn thou this from the merry gurgle of the flask of wine!</p>  
<p>There is, doubtless, a difference in the sight of the beholders;<br> And if not so, the parts are by no means distinct from the whole.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Metaphorically, this world is like unto eternity's bridge;<br> Then, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>, do thou over it swiftly pass!</p>  <h4 align="center">XII.</h4>  
<p>In the world, there is no perfection without declination;<br> Then, on account of declination, mourn, O perfect man!</p>  
<p>The dread of separation was as bitter as absence itself;<br> Hence from association I never any pleasure derived.</p>  
<p>From thee, the sun luminous grew, and from it the moon:<br> Who then, with thy face shall the full moon compare?</p>  
<p>At thy departure, my very soul even deserteth the body;<br> But do not thou for a moment leave me, O image of my love!</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="green">p. 281</font></A></p>  
<p>Since I did not die when separated from her; on meeting,<br> I am so ashamed that I am unable to look her in the face.</p>  
<p>The same who hath inflicted the wound upon my heart,<br> Hath also applied the soft bandage thereunto.</p>  
<p>Shouldst thou pass the alley of the beloved of my heart,<br> Deliver, O zephyr of the morning! this message unto her&#8212;</p>  
<p>"Tho&#8217;, without thee, I am not one moment from sorrow free;<br> Yet, ever joyful and gay, may the Almighty keep thee!"</p>  
<p>With much sorrow, many loving ones have been torn away&#8212;<br> May God never send unto us the <u>Gh</u>ow&#257;s year&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> again!</p>  
<p>The fragrance of musk and amber emanateth from every word,<br> When <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span> praiseth that black mole of thine.</p>  <h4 align="center">XIII.</h4>  
<p>The flowers of spring have put forth their blossoms in garden and in mead:<br> On the house-tops there are flowers, in the lanes, and in the hedges too.</p>  
<p>The stones, the bushes, the thorns, the weeds&#8212;all are by flowers hidden:<br> Of every blemish and defect the flowers have the concealers become.</p>  
<p>Wherever the eyesight may be directed, all, all are flowers there&#8212;<br> Flowers in front, and flowers behind&#8212;flowers on every side.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_282"><font size="1" color="green">p. 282</font></A></p>  
<p>No single spot whatever is of fragrant flowers left devoid&#8212;<br> Flowers in the market, flowers in the wilds, flowers in the hills.</p>  
<p>The nightingale, to revel and disport, with a loud voice, crieth out;<br> For the spring passeth away, and every moment the flowers fade and decay!</p>  
<p>The youths and maidens, in their gambols and revelry, place<br> Flowers in their hair, flowers in their bosoms, flowers in their turbans.</p>  
<p>The entire person of the beloved is of fragrant flowers composed&#8212;<br> Her feet are flowers, her hands flowers, her sweet face flowers also.</p>  
<p>Let the wine be rosy, the goblet rosy, the wine-flask rosy likewise!<br> The cupbearer a flower, the associates flowers, the scene all flowers too!</p>  
<p>When she smelleth unto a flower, let great caution be observed,<br> Lest on her tender, delicate lips, the flower a wound should inflict.</p>  
<p>Gentle and simple, they have filled with delight by their display&#8212;<br> The flowers have, on every one, a load of obligation conferred.</p>  
<p>But though flowers may have bloomed of a thousand hues,<br> No flower hath been seen like unto the beloved one of my heart.</p>  
<p>That they thus heartily laugh, with such gladness and such glee,<br> What! of autumn's near approach, are not the flowers aware?</p>  
<p>Since in them may be seen the emblem of his own loved one;<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span> thus remembereth the flowers in his strains.</p>  <h4 align="center">XIV.</h4>  
<p>The folks of the world give us their admonitions most unjustly;<br> For every man pleaseth himself according to his own mind.</p>  
<p><a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="green">p. 283</font></A></p>  
<p>What have others to do with us, forsooth, that they restrain us,<br> If, for the sake of the beloved, we sacrifice life and goods?</p>  
<p>When love, like a mighty river, hath overflowed the heart,<br> Doth any one attempt a dam to raise on the face of the flood?</p>  
<p>By the severance of all worldly concerns, sanctity is acquired;<br> But not by saddling oneself with worldly obligations and ties.</p>  
<p>Involuntarily, and impulsively, the heart is given to the fair:<br> This matter is not brought about by counsel, or such like things.</p>  
<p>The brutes chew the cud upon their food; but it behoveth man<br> To ruminate upon every word that issueth from his mouth.</p>  
<p>As long, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>! as thy strains may be repeated,<br> From them flow so many varying, and delightful sweets.</p>  <h4 align="center">XV.</h4>  
<p>If the surface of thy face be not soiled, be under no concern;<br> And the mirror of my heart, too, is not by rust affected.</p>  
<p>Whosoever cometh near pitch, becometh defiled;<br> Then get thee away behind me, O thou so very white!</p>  
<p>He, whose heart hath consumed in the flames of love,<br> What apprehension need he have of the fire of Hell?</p>  
<p>She would make the dark night one of moonlight to her lover,<br> If the moon-faced one would draw aside the veil from her face.</p>  
<p>From time to time, every thing hath gone out of my heart,<br> Save the remembrance of the fair, that will never depart.</p>  
<p>&#8217;Tis from the wails of the nightingale it is thus so affected&#8212;<br> This rose-bud, that rendeth its garment into shreds.</p>  
<p><a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="green">p. 284</font></A></p>  
<p>All else is a mere vail, save the love of the Deity:<br> Then, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>, do thou no other love pursue!</p>  <h4 align="center">XVI.</h4>  
<p>On ascending to the terrace-roof of wealth, show thou no arrogance;<br> But always have before thine eyes the fear of falling therefrom!</p>  
<p>It hath raised up many, and dashed them again to the ground:<br> Fortune's wheel raiseth uppermost, that it may again cast down.</p>  
<p>At the outset, acquire thou the wings of affection and love,<br> If of soaring in the heavens thou the intention nourish.</p>  
<p>They whose hearts beauty's face may not with love inspire,<br> Their countenances are not worthy even to be looked upon!</p>  
<p>I would say, I should go and consort with the dogs at her door;<br> But she would not, even then, one day, say to me " Come here!"</p>  
<p>Since mine eyes became not blind,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_337"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> from the absence of my love,<br> With all my heart I am now willing they should go out of my head.</p>  
<p>Through contentment, and not through gold, is opulence acquired:<br> The whiteness of the heart is essential, not the whiteness of the hair.</p>  
<p>Thou hast rendered it sweeter than Persian, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>!<br> Although the Pu<u>s&#146;h</u>to language was so bitter before.</p>  <h4 align="center">XVII.</h4>  
<p>Since the heart is torn from it, in the end, in anguish and woe,<br> Why do people set their hearts this fleeting world upon?</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>From this garden's roses, constancy's fragrance emanateth not:<br> Most unjustly do the nightingales hazard their hearts upon them.</p>  
<p>Since the thought of the curls of the beloved is dishevelled and deranged,<br> Let my heart be disordered for ever! let it never be composed!</p>  
<p>So hard, so pitiless, and so regardless, as is that heart of thine,<br> There will be none other like it, the whole universe within!</p>  
<p>Wherever its ravisher may be, there will the heart be also;<br> For when do the heart-ravishers in their breasts retain their hearts?</p>  
<p>Why hast Thou, O God! my heart filled with a giddy fair one's love?<br> That, though guiltless of any fault, every moment the heart afflicteth.</p>  
<p>Proximity and remoteness&#8212;conjunction and separation&#8212;will be all one to him,<br> Whose heart hath a place acquired in immateriality's abode.</p>  
<p>The flames of Hell I accept, with all my heart, a hundred times over;<br> But God forbid that in separation's fire the heart be consumed!</p>  
<p>Eat! drink wine! raise the song! do all, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span>!<br> But this one thing&#8212;do not thou the heart of the Muslim afflict!</p>  <h4 align="center">XVIII.</h4>  
<p>O cupbearer! unto me such a cup of forgetfulness give,<br> That on quaffing it I may oblivious and insensate become!</p>  
<p><a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="green">p. 286</font></A></p>  
<p>Reproached and reviled by the world, to the deserts and wilds I flee;<br> Like even unto Majn&#363;n, I make the wilderness my home.</p>  
<p>The fruit of its aims and desires, it shall then eat therefrom,<br> When the grain, in the earth, shall itself to extinction give.</p>  
<p>Since it is filled with the conceptions of the faces of the fair,<br> The picture gallery of M&#257;n&#299;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> this mind of mine must be.</p>  
<p>My heart becometh, through envy and jealousy, to pieces torn,<br> When her fingers draw the comb through her flowing hair.</p>  
<p>For a minstrel, in the spring-time, I have no necessity;<br> The sweet melody of the nightingale is sufficient for me.</p>  
<p>Nightly, in my dwelling, with this intent, I gather a party together,<br> That possibly, under this plea, the charmer might attend.</p>  
<p>As an inducement, that he should risk his life to obtain it,<br> The diver desireth that the oyster-shell a pearl should contain.</p>  
<p>A hundred times over, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&AElig;abd-ul-&#7730;&#257;dir</span> would sacrifice it for her,<br> If, by parting with his head, he might his loved one obtain.</p>
