<A NAME="quran"></A>
<H3>Qur'an</H3>

<P>
The Qur'an is the primary text of Islam, revealed to the Prophet Muhammed
beginning in the year 610 C.E.
It was canonicalized between 644 and 656.
The Qur'an is required reading for anyone who wants to understand Islam.
Qur'an means "The Recital" in Arabic; according to the story, the angel
Gabriel commanded Muhammed to "Recite!".

The Hadith, second only to the Qur'an in importance and authority,
are collections of Islamic traditions and laws (<I>Sunna</I>).
This includes traditional sayings of Muhammed and later Islamic sages.
By the ninth century over 600,000 Hadith had been recorded;
these were later edited down to about 25,000.

<P>
It is our policy to preserve the original text and titles 
of books transcribed for this site.
This has some theological implications in this section.
Some Muslims do not believe that any text other than the actual Arabic
text of the Quran (even a transliteration or an Arabic text with vowels)
can strictly be called 'the Qur'an'.
This is because the Arabic text is considered canonical
and there can be no other versions of it.
The phrase 'the meaning of the Quran' is typically used to
describe texts which would otherwise be described as 'translations'.
Please be aware of this issue where this site presents or refers to
a 'translation,' 'translator' or 'transliteration' of the Quran.
In addition, many of these books were originally written by Europeans
during the 19th century and use the term 'Mohammedan'
to refer to Muslims (by analogy with 'Buddhist,' 'Christian' etc.)
Most Muslims deprecate this term today because the founder of Islam
is considered a human prophet, rather than an entity to be worshipped, as the
term could be taken to imply.
In the interest of archival accuracy this terminology has been
retained in the etexts; in text that we've written, we have attempted to
avoid it, except in quotations.
No disrespect to Islam or Muslims is intended thereby.
