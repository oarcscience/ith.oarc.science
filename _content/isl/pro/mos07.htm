<center><font size=+3>Taking Off The Shoes in The Valley of Tuwa</font></center>
It is mentioned that Al-Mahdi (PUH), the awaited, may our souls be a ransom
to him, was asked about God's commandment for Moses to take off his shoes
by saying: So take off thy shoes, for lo! thou art in the holy valley of
Tuwa(TaHa:12), so the one asking said: the scholars of the two creeds [he
did not appoint which creeds at that time] say that this commandment was
because it (the shoes) were made of skin (of the dead animals), so he (PUH)
said what was in general like: whoever said that had made lies about Moses
and did not know truely his prophecy, because such matter has two relative
conditions: either the prayers of Moses was accepted, or it was not accepted,
so if praying with it (the shoes of skin) was accepted and allowed, then
it is allowed for Moses to wear it also in that holy spot even if it was
a sacred place, and if praying was not allowed with it then they had pointed
out that Moses knows nothing about the allowed and what is not allowed
and how the prayer is accepted and how it is not, and this is a disbelieve.
So then the one asking said: then I said to him (PUH): O master then what
is the interpretation of this? So he (PUH) said: Moses was in the holy
valley and he showed to his Lord the absolute love and sincerity and the
great happiness for speaking to Him without a medium betweem both of them
and for making him a messanger to the pharaoh that he was afraid of him
and of his people, so then God said to him: if you are truely loving Me
and sincere then take off your shoes meaning take off the love of your
family and people and make it all to Me and do not make it busy with something
else, Allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body(Al-Ahz&acirc;b:4).
<br>It is mentioned that Moses loved his wife so much and he left her with
her birth pains without someone to take care of her in coldness and in
wilderness, and went on searching for fire and then he met that great happiness.
<br>It is mentioned in Torah that Moses (PUH) had a son and he called Gershom,
and it is a name that gives a feeling of being strange. We have the right
to talk about the matter of taking off the shoes and talk about what is
apparent and understood in the regulations of those who regulate, and that
the commandment from Him, the Exalted, to take off the shoes was to be
polite in that holy spot, and because he (Moses) was in front of the Great
of heavens and earth and their Creator, and he was talking to the One that
has everything in His hands and He is the Resurrector and the Eternal,
the Lord of angels and the soul, so in that situation Moses even should
have crawled on his knees and prostrate on the live coal for the God of
the worlds, with addition of taking of the shoes, and he should have forget
about everything else and only work his heart and his senses with his real
Lord and his Creator that speaks to him, and being with bare foots is a
sign of humiliation, and to get the bless from the soil of the holy spot,
and for this reason the old faithful people used to pilgrimage around Kaaba
with bare foots. Then Moses wore his shoes like everyone else to protect
his feet from being polluted and against insects and shocks from rocks
and thorns and so on, and maybe God ordered him to take them off because
He made him safe in that spot and He told him about the purity of that
spot.
<br>It is mentioned that once the prophet (PUH) was asked: why the valley
of Tuwa was called the holy valley? He said: because in it the souls were
sanctified and the angels were chosen and there God spoke to Moses. As
attributed to Ibn-`Abb&acirc;s about the meaning of the mount of Sinai
he said that it is every mountain that has olive trees on it or any other
fruitful trees that people might use, and every mountain that has such
characteristics is called the mount of Sinai , and if it has nothing that
people might use of plants or trees it would not be called by this name
but only called a mountain, so we say: language is the source whenever
we doubt about the meaning of something in the language, and the holy phrases
that point out to this matter are a lot, and in the chapter of TaHa: Hath
there come unto thee the story of Moses ? When he saw a fire and said unto
his folk: Lo! Wait! I see a fire afar off. Peradventure I may bring you
a brand therefrom or may find guidance at the fire.And when he reached
it, he was called by name: O Moses! Lo! I, even I, am thy Lord, So take
off thy shoes, for lo! thou art in the holy valley of Tuwa(TaHa:9-12),
and the holy phrases are a lot in many chapters: Al-Qasas, Al-Forq&acirc;n,
Al-Shu`ar&acirc;', Al-Sajdah, Al-N&acirc;zi`&acirc;t, and others, and they
interpret each other, and its matter is not hidden from the sacred faith
and its people.
