<center><font size=+3>Mutation of Israelites</font></center>
God did say: And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We
said unto them: Be ye apes, despised and hated! And We made it an example
to their own and to succeeding generations, and an admonition to the Allah-fearing
(Al-Baqarah:65-66), and also: Ask them (O Muhammad) of the township that
was by the sea...etc(Al-A`r&acirc;f: 163). In one narration they were three
groups: one did the forbidden deeds, and one denied this, and one that
did not deny and did not do the forbidden, so God saved those who denied
this attitude, and made those who did not deny it as a dust, and mutated
the group that used to do the foribdden deeds and made them as apes. The
narrator of this narration, and he is `Ali ben T&acirc;woos: the mutation
of the group that did not deny into dust or grains might be because that
they made the greatness of God so small and made it such an easy thing
to come over God's laws, so God made them small and turned them into grains.
<br>As attributed to `Ali ben Al-Husain (PUH) about God's saying: And ye
know of those of you who broke the Sabbath...etc, that they were living
by the sea and God with the prophets forbade them to hunt fishes in Sabbath
so they made a tricky way to allow what had been illegal for them, so they
made ditches and made a way leading to a basin that whales can enter but
cannot leave it, so the whales came on the Sabbath and feeling safe and
then fell into the basin, and when it was night time and desired to leave
they couldn't and remained there, so they can pick them from there without
hunting and easily on the next day and so they say "we did not hunt on
Sabbath" and they did so until their fortunes increased.
<br>In brief, what they did and what they ended up with as been told in
the narration of Al-Sajj&acirc;d (`Ali ben Al-Husain) (PUH) is that they
were in a town of a population of nearly eighty thousand, and those who
did the forbidden deeds counted as much as seventy thousand, and the rest
are those who denied such deeds, and those who denied such deeds did leave
the rest to another village, and God then mutated those who did the wrong
deeds into apes, and after mutation the others did visit them to check
their conditions after such rebel and bad deeds and they found them turned
into apes, and the comers used to identify each ape of them and say for
any of them: your are so and so, and the ape would shake his head for agreement
with a tear in his eyes for his sorrow and regret for what he did and for
what happened to him, and they remained like this for three days, and God
then sent down on them the rains and storms that swept them to the sea
and whoever remained was mutated again as well, this is as it is mentioned
in the Tales of Prophets for Al-Jaz&acirc;'iri. Then said Al-Sajj&acirc;d
(PUH): and those you see now with the same shape are similar creatures
but they are not the same as those before and they are not from their descendants,
and then he (PUH) said: God mutated those for hunting fishes in ways God
did not allow so how is it then with those who killed the children of the
prophet of God and broke their veils? even though God did not mutate them
in this life but He prepared for them what is counted as multiplies of
the torture of mutation, and then he (PUH) said: those who broke the Sabbath
if only they asked God by the rights of Muhammad and his Household (PUT)
to prevent them from doing such bad deeds, He would answer them, but God
did not inspire them to do so for their rebellious nature and so He did
not guide them to the way of their happiness.
<br>In a narration told about the interpretation of God's saying: Those
of the Children of Israel who went astray were cursed by the tongue of
David, and of Jesus, son of Mary..etc(Al-M&acirc;'idah:78), and the most
famous thing is that apes are mentioned by the tongue of David and the
pigs by the tongue of Jesus, and Al-Baydh&acirc;wi [seems a scholar name]
said: it is mentioned that when the people of Obbalah - and it is a village
- when they broke the Sabbath, God damned them by the tongue of David and
were mutated to apes and pigs, and the people of the table when they disbelieved
in Jesus he prayed against them and damned them and they were mutated into
pigs and they were counted as much as five thousand men. Al-Sayid Al-Jaz&acirc;'iri
said: Obbalah is a location near by Basra, and in God's saying: Ask them
(O Muhammad) of the township that was by the sea(Al-A`r&acirc;f:163), and
as mentioned in the interpretation of `Ali ben Ibr&acirc;him: it was a
township that belonged to the Israelites and was by the sea, and in low
and high tides the sea used to go into their rivers and farms and the fishes
used to out of the sea and reach the end of their farms, and God prohibited
them to hunt on Sabbath so they get to prepare the nets on the night before
Sabbath and hunt on sunday while the fishes used to go out on Sabbath and
sunday, so their scholars prohibited them to do so but they didn't stop
so they were mutated into apes and pigs, and the reason for prohibitition
of hunting on Sabbath was that that all believers and faithful ones and
others had their holiday on friday but the jews denied that and made it
on Sabbath (saturday) and said: our holiday is on Sabbath so God prohibited
hunting for them on Sabbath, and we've pointed out that they were divided
into three main groups, one group was advising against the wrong doing,
and another group did not advise nor do the bad deeds and they said to
the ones advising: Why preach ye to a folk whom Allah is about to destroy
or punish with an awful doom(Al-A`r&acirc;f:164) and the answer was: In
order to be free from guilt before your Lord, and that haply they may ward
off (evil)(Al-A`r&acirc;f:164), and then the first group said: by God we
shall not sit with you and do not live with you in this town that you made
sins in starting from this night for we fear that adversities would be
revealed upon you and us, so it is mentioned that they left the town and
settled down near by and slept under the sky, and when it was the morning
time they went to check the sinners so they reached the gate of the town
and it was closed, and they knocked on it but none did answer and they
did not hear any sounds or movements, but they heard sounds like moaning
that doesn't sound like human voices, so then they put a ladder on the
town's wall and made a man to climb over, so when he went on top and looked
on it he found out that most of the people turned into apes, so they broke
the door and got inside and they said to them: hadn't we forbid you!. Whoever
wants to check the story can check the long stories mentioned about them
in this matter, and God is the Bringer of success.
