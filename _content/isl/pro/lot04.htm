Wife of Lot (PUH)</a></big></big></big><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a name="015_071">The wife of Lot (PUH)
was from village and she followed the religion of her own people and
did not believe in Lot or his religion and never followed him by any
way, but she followed her people and their religion and she liked their
deeds and she was an enemy to Lot and to everything connected to him
and to anyone who loves him, so she was a disbeliever and used to guide
the people for his guests, and they said: she assigned a sign between
her and her people to tell them about his guests, and that is whenever
guests would come to him at night she would work some fire on the roof
of the house, and at daytime she would make a smoke instead, and in
some speeches it is mentioned that after leaving Abraham, the angels
went to Lot and found him watering his plants, so Lot said to them: who
are you? They answered: we are travellers, make us your guests tonight.
Then he said: O people, the people of this village are people of evil
and God damned them, they commit sodomy with men and take their money,
so they said: we've been late, make us your guests. Then he went to his
wife and said: we have some guests tonight so keep it a secret and I
shall forgive you for all your deeds until this very day, so she said:
I will, and when Gabriel and the angels entered to his home, his wife
made a fire on the roof and so the people of the village knew about it
and came to him from every direction and when they reached the door
they said to Lot: </a><a name="015_070">Have we not forbidden you from
entertaining anyone? He answered: </a><a name="011_078">Here are my
daughters! They are purer for you, and he meant by that their wives
because the prophet is considered to be like the father of his nation
so he called them back to what is allowed, so he said: your wives are
purer for you. They said: </a><a name="011_079">Well thou knowest that
we have no right to thy daughters, and well thou knowest what we want,
then Lot said when he was despaired: </a><a name="011_080">Would that
I had strength to resist you or had some strong support.<br>
In speeches: no prophet was sent after Lot unless he was of a high
place among his people, and maybe the saying of Lot "</a><a
 name="011_080">Would that I had strength" was dedicated to the angels
and the purpose of it is to mean if only he have strength to protect
them, and Lot did not know they were angels at that time, then the
angels told him about their real identity and for the purpose for their
arrival, but the apparent thing in the holy phrases is that the speech
was dedicated to his people and not to the angels, because when they
(his people) came running towards him, it is more accurate to be with
them at that moment, and only God knows.When the people tried to take
the guests of Lot out of his home by force and attacked his house, God
made them unable to see any place to get into the house, and so they
did not see the way nor the door and did not know where are they, and
the earth shaken under their feet and their heads flipped upside down
and their eyes and their hearts been blind.<br>
Then angels took out Lot and his daughters and his wife from the
village and ordered them that no one should look back and they should
go to wherever they are ordered, so they obeyed the commandments except
his wife and she looked back to the village to see what happened to it
and her heart was there more than it is with Lot, and so she had the
punishment that was revealed on them, and she was a disbeliever, so God
rained with baked clay, and flipped their lands and made the highest of
it to the lowest, and God said in the chapter of Al-Tahreem: </a><a
 name="066_010">Allah citeth an example for those who disbelieve: the
wife of Noah and the wife of Lot, who were under two of Our righteous
slaves yet betrayed them so that they (the husbands) availed them
naught against Allah and it was said (unto them): Enter the Fire along
with those who enter(Al-Tahreem:10). It is said that in Torah mentioned
the story in the same way that quran did but it did not mention
anything about offering his daughters, and it mentioned that while the
wife of Lot was walking away from the village she looked back at her
people and then she was turned to a pillar of salt, and Lot with his
daughters then took refuge in a village called Zoar which was kept in
safe.<br>
