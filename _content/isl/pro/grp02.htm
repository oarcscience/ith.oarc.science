<center><font size=+3>Ishmael, Other Than The Son of Abraham (PUT)</font></center>
It is mentioned that he is other than the son of Abraham, the friend of
God (PUH) but it is possibly the son of Ezekiel the prophet was mentioned
before, the one who resurrected the dead people by the permission of God
and the owner of the bright miracles and the one whose prays are answered
and hard working for God, and as attributed to Al-S&acirc;diq (PUH) that
he said: Ishmael that God said about him in His holy book: And make mention
in the Scripture of Ishmael. Lo! he was a keeper of his promise, and he
was a messenger (of Allah), a prophet(Mariam:54), he was not Ishmael the
son of Abraham but he was a prophet that God sent to his people and they
took him and skinned his head and his face, so then an angel came to him
and said: God the Almighty sent me to you so order me with whatever you
want, so then he answered: this is to be done to me like it will be done
with Al-Husain ben `Ali (PUT), and in other narrations he said "like it
will be done to the prophets." As reported by Al-K&acirc;fi from Al-S&acirc;diq
(PUH) he said: he was called "keeper of his promise" because he promised
a man in a place so he waited for him there for one year, and so God called
him "keeper of his promise" and then the man came to him after that and
Ishmael said to him: I am still waiting for you.
<br>As attributed to Al-Ridh&acirc; (PUH) he said what has the meaning
in general: he had promised someone with a certain promise and waited for
him for one year and he is Ishmael ben Ezekiel, and God praised him again
by saying: He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving, and was
acceptable in the sight of his Lord(Mariam:55). In a narration attributed
to Zayd Al-`Ajli from Al-S&acirc;diq (PUH) and it is a long one about someone
that asked him (PUH) about Ishmael the keeper of his promise, he answered:
he is Ishmael ben Ezekiel the prophet, the one that was sent to his people
but they disbelieved in him and killed him and skinned his face, so then
God had the wrath upon them and He sent down Sat&acirc;t&acirc;'eel, the
angel of torture, and he said to him (Ishmael): O Ishmael, I am the angel
of torture and directed by the Lord of Exaltness to you to torture your
folks as you like, and then Ishmael said: no need for that O Sat&acirc;t&acirc;'eel,
then God inspired to him: what do you need O Ishmael? Then Ishmael said:
O Lord, You had the covenant for Yourself for being a God, and for Muhammad
to be a prophet, and for his viceroys to be leaders and You told Your creatures
about what will happen to Al-Husain ben `Ali after the prophet, and You
promised Al-Husain that he will be back into life again to take revenge
for what had been done to him, so my need to You O Lord is to let me back
into life again to take revenge from those who did that to me as You would
turn Al-Husain back into life again, and God then promised Ishmael ben
Ezekiel to do that, and he will be back with Al-Husain ben `Ali (PUT).
