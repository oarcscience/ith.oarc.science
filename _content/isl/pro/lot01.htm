Funny Stories</a></big></big></big><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a name="029_029">The people of Sodom
were people of evil and rudeness, and they had a judge that judges for
them always wether they were right or wrong as it is said, so then
Sarah the wife of Abraham sent a messenger to Sodom to see the
conditions of Lot and his safety, and when he arrived there one man saw
him and came to him and hit him on his head with a stone so his blood
went out, then he hanged on him and said: this huge amount of blood if
it was in your body any longer it would harm you so I wanted my fees!
When the debate went for so long between them and the messenger of
Sarah could not get rid of that man he called him for a judgement, so
they went to the ruler of Sodom, and when he heard their story he
judged for the the messenger to pay for the sodomite the fees, so when
the messenger of Sarah, Elazar, saw such unjustice he took a stone and
hit the judge on his head and made his blood go out and said to him:
the fees that you must pay to me for hitting you, pay them back to the
man that hit me and made my blood go out, then he left out back to
where he came from to escape this village and its unjustice.<br>
Abdul-Wah&acirc;b Al-Najj&acirc;r said in his stories: I was reading
the poem of Al-Ma`arri [a poet's name]:<br>
</a>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a name="029_029"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Who is the one that saw a judge<br>
That did not judge as the way of Sodom<br>
</span></a>&lt;&gt;<a name="029_029">and I did not understand what did
he
mean by that and did he mean by Sodom, until I read this story and then
I understood what is meant by the poem. There are other stories
attributed to them that would make the author and the reader so shy of
it but we left it out because they are connected to funny legends. How
awfully great what the people of Sodom did and it was not of benefit
for them the residence of the prophet Lot among them and his guides and
advices, and they did not care about his warnings although he promised
them the benefits and goodness, and he carried out lot of their
troubles, and he stayed with them for long time but no results could be
gained from them, then he prayed to God to punish them, and God allowed
to punish them as soon as possible. Then God sent His messengers to
flip upside down their villages and to tell Abraham about that before
it is done, and when they went to him they brought to him the tidings
about his son Isaac, and Jacob after Isaac. When they went to Abraham,
he thought them to be guests, so he made for them some food and got a
fat sheep for this, and when he saw that their hands do not try to get
some of the food he got into doubts about them and got scared from
them, so they told him that they are messenger of God had been sent by
Him to take revenge from the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and they are
the ones that are expressed as to be the people of Lot. Some historians
said: I think that the dead sea which is known now as the sea of Lot
and/or the lake of Lot was not there before this incident, but it
appeared because of the earthquake that made the toppest of the land to
the lowest and it became lower than the sea level by almost four
hundred meters. Some news been told lately about fiding some traces
that belong to the villages of the people of Lot on the edges of the
dead sea. When Abraham knew that the people of Lot will be destroyed
and that the angels are sent to do so, and he saw that they had young
people, sick people and children that did not do any wrong and also in
the land there is Lot and his household, he was affected for this
matter, for he had a passionate heart, so he could not hold hisself and
started arguing about that and the angels then answered him "we know
who is there better" and told him that Lot and his family will get no
harm and they will be saved, and the judgement of God will not return
back. God said: </a><a name="011_074">And when the awe departed from
Abraham, and the glad news reached him, he pleaded with Us on behalf of
the folk of Lot.</a><a name="011_075"> Lo! Abraham was mild, imploring,
penitent(Hud:74-75).<br>
God said about the people of Lot in the chapter of Al-A`r&acirc;f: </a><a
 name="007_080">And Lot! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Will ye
commit abomination such as no creature ever did before you ?</a><a
 name="007_081">
Lo! ye come with lust unto men instead of women. Nay, but ye are wanton
folk.</a><a name="007_082"> And the answer of his people was only that
they said (one to another):
Turn them out of your township. They are folk, forsooth, who keep pure.</a><a
 name="007_083">
And We rescued him and his household, save his wife, who was of those
who stayed behind.</a><a name="007_084"> And We rained a rain upon
them. See now the nature of the consequence of
evil-doers!(Al-A`r&acirc;f:80-84) And we've mentioned before the
ancestry of Lot and that he is the son of Haran ben Terah, the cousin
of Abraham, and also been said that he is his maternal cousin and that
Sarah the wife of the Abraham is his sister, and we've mentioned before
that there is nothing wrong about that, and Lot is Abraham's cousin and
also his maternal cousin and also a brother of Sarah the wife of
Abraham (PUH), check back and meditate and only God knows.<br>
The people Lot used to come with lust to men instead of women and so
they cut off the child birth and make people avoid passing into their
lands for this deed because they used to do it with strangers that pass
through their lands, and they used to throw stones on strangers and the
one that hit him then this strnager would be for him, so they take his
money and commit sodomy with him or take three coins from him and leave
his money alone, and they had a judge that allows all of that, and in
their gatherings they used to do abominations without being shy, so God
revelaed His anger upon them and His punishment, and it was the black
stones or in some other tales the black water and it is a sign for
God's anger and a gate to lands' destruction. Every type is mentioned
and it might be that every type was done indeed, and so their lands
were flipped upside down and then been rained by the black stones, as
it is told in details in the chapter of Hud: </a><a name="011_077">And
when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was distressed and knew not how
to protect them. He said: This is a distressful day.</a><a
 name="011_078">
And his people came unto him, running towards him - and before then
they used to commit abominations - He said: O my people! Here are my
daughters! They are purer for you. Beware of Allah, and degrade me not
in (the person of) my guests. Is there not among you any upright man ?</a><a
 name="011_079">
They said: Well thou knowest that we have no right to thy daughters,
and well thou knowest what we want.</a><a name="011_080">He said: Would
that I had strength to resist you or had some strong support (among
you)!</a><a name="011_081">
(The messengers) said: O Lot! Lo! we are messengers of thy Lord; they
shall not reach thee. So travel with thy people in a part of the night,
and let not one of you turn round - (all) save thy wife. Lo! that which
smiteth them will smite her (also). Lo! their tryst is (for) the
morning. Is not the morning nigh ?</a><a name="011_082">
So when Our commandment came to pass We overthrew (that township) and
rained upon it stones of clay, one after another,</a><a name="011_083">
Marked with fire in the providence of thy Lord (for the destruction of
the wicked). And they are never far from the wrong-doers(Hud:77-83),
and lot of such tidings been brought by other holy phrases from other
chapters with little differences, and we'd like to point that out as
headlines, in the chapter of Al-Hijr: </a><a name="015_070">They said;
Have we not forbidden you from (entertaining) anyone ?</a><a
 name="015_071">
He said: Here are my daughters, if ye must be doing
(so)(Al-Hijr:70-71), and in the chapter of Al-Shu`ar&acirc;': </a><a
 name="026_166">And leave the wives your Lord created for you ? Nay,
but ye are froward folk(Al-Shu`ar&acirc;':166).<br>
