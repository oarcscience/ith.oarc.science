and Phrases That Mentioned Abraham (PUH)</a></big></big></big><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a name="014_037">Abraham (PUH) was
mentioned in twenty five chapters in holy quran: Al-Baqarah,
&Acirc;l-`Imr&acirc;n, Al-Nis&acirc;', Al-An`&acirc;m, Al-Tawbah, Hud,
Yusuf, Ibr&acirc;him, Al-Hijr, Al-Nahal, Mariam, Al-Anbiy&acirc;',
Al-Haj, Al-Shu`ar&acirc;', Al-`Ankabut, Al-Ahz&acirc;b,
Al-S&acirc;ff&acirc;t, S&acirc;d, Al-Shur&acirc;, Al-Zokhrof,
Al-&ETH;&acirc;riy&acirc;t, Al-Najm, Al-Hadeed, Al-Momtahanah,
Al-A`l&acirc;. In the chapter of Al-Baqarah, the Exalted says: </a><a
 name="002_127">And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the
foundations of the House, (Abraham prayed): Our Lord! Accept from us
(this duty). Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower.</a><a
 name="002_128">
Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation
submissive unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship, and relent
toward us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the
Merciful(Al-Baqarah:127-128) In the chapter of &Acirc;l-`Imr&acirc;n: </a><a
 name="003_096">Lo! the first Sanctuary appointed for mankind was that
at Becca, a blessed place, a guidance to the
peoples(&Acirc;l-`Imr&acirc;n:96). In the chapter of Ibr&acirc;him: </a><a
 name="014_035">And when Abraham said: My Lord! Make safe this
territory, and preserve me and my sons from serving
idols(Ibr&acirc;him:35). In the chapter of Al-Haj:&nbsp; </a><a
 name="022_026">And (remember) when We prepared for Abraham the place
of the (holy) House, saying: Ascribe thou no thing as partner unto Me,
and purify My House for those who make the round (thereof) and those
who stand and those who bow and make prostration(Al-Haj:26), so follow
(read)&nbsp; and notice&nbsp; (think).<br>
We've pointed out that the story of Abraham (PUH) is connected to other
stories like the story of Lot, and the story of his son Ishmael and the
story of his son Isaac, and we've mentioned that Lot was his maternal
cousin and also&nbsp; his nephew and they were in the same time&nbsp;
sequence, and Lot believed in his uncle Abraham and so he was calling
people to his religion. The Exalted said: </a><a name="029_026">And
Lot believed him, and said: Lo! I am a fugitive unto my
Lord(Al-`Ankabut:26). They say that Ishmael was born when Abraham was
eighty six years old, and Abraham lived for one hundred and seventy
five years, while Isaac was born&nbsp; while Abraham was&nbsp; one
hundred years old and his mother is Sarah the maternal cousin of
Abraham.<br>
They say that Abraham (PUH) got another six children from other woman
other than Sarah and Hagar, but quran did not mention apparently except
ishmael and Isaac. Torah mentioned that Abraham married a woman called
Keturah [Arabic: Qaturah] and she gave birth for six children for him,
and it mentioned their names but there is no need to mention them now
because it has no effects. In Muruj Al-&ETH;ahab for Al-Mas`udi he
said: After Sarah's death, Abraham married Qantur&acirc;' [just another
variation of the name] and he had six children from her and they are
Marq, Nafas, Madan, Midian, Sin&acirc;n and Sereh [Hebrew: Zimran,
Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, Shuah].<br>
Lot was mentioned in fourteen chapters in holy quran: Al-An`&acirc;m,
Al-A`r&acirc;f, Hud, Al-Hijr, AL-Anbiy&acirc;', Al-Haj,
Al-Shu`ar&acirc;', Al-Naml, Al-`Ankabut, Al-S&acirc;ff&acirc;t,
S&acirc;d, Al-Qamar, Al-Tahreem. Isaac was mentioned in eight chapters:
Al-Baqarah, &Acirc;l-`Imr&acirc;n, Al-Nis&acirc;', Al-An`&acirc;m,
Ibr&acirc;him, Mariam, Al-Anbiy&acirc;', S&acirc;d. Their stories are
mentioned in quran either in details or in brief, sometimes mentioning
only some of their matters, and in some others more than that, and most
of the prophets and viceroys are mentioned in that way. They mentioned
that Ishmael lived for one hundred and thirty seven years, and we've
mentioned that he died in Mecca and been buried there in the place that
is known as Hajar Isma`eel, that is the one located near by the Holy
house, with his mother, and this is the most popular.<br>
It is mentioned that Ishmael had twelve sons, and some of them are:
Had&acirc;r, Tayyim, Mibs&acirc;m, Dawmah, Qidmah and Qayd&acirc;r, and
they are mentioned in Genesis in Torah [The full list of names in Torah
is: Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad,
Temah, Jetur, Naphish, Kedemah], and they mentioned that all of them
started tribes of their own, and only God knows. Until now we did not
find a specific way of how Abraham died and quran did not mention how,
but Torah mentioned that. In summary, Abraham (PUH) lived for one
hundred and seventy five years. In Muruj Al-&ETH;ahab for Al-Mas`udi:
Abraham died in the lands of Shem, and his age was at that time one
hundred and ninty five years, and God revealed upon him ten books. When
he died, his sons Isaac and Ishmael in the cave of Al-Makfeelah in the
field of `Afroon ben Sarsar Al-Hashi, and there Sarah was buried before
him, and it is the place of the monument of Al-Khaleel in Jirun and now
it is called the city of Al-Khaleel (Hebron), and its old name was the
village of Arbo` as it is mentioned in the tales of Abul-Wah&acirc;b
Al-Najj&acirc;r.<br>
