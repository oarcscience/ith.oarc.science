(Angels prostration for Adam PUH)</P>
<P>Said God let praise be to Him: And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam, they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride, and so became a disbeliever (Al-Baqarah: 34). And in another position He said to Iblis blaming him for not prostrating: He said: What hindered thee that thou didst not fall prostrate when I bade thee? (Al-A'raf: 12). The damned said then: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire while him Thou didst create of mud, and continued: Now, because Thou hast sent me astray, verily I shall lurk in ambush for them on Thy Right Path, then I shall come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right hands and from their left hands, and Thou wilt not find most of them beholden (unto Thee). And also said: Reprieve me till the day when they are raised (from the dead). and God answered: Then lo! thou art of those reprieved Till the Day of appointed time. And God said also: and they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He was of the jinn, so he rebelled against his Lord's command (Al-Kahf: 50) <BR>
So the phrases that points out the facts about the creation of Adam (PUH) and the prostration of Angels before him after the commandments of God and the rebel of Iblis against God's command for he is created of fire and Adam was created of mud or clay and God's damnations upon him and his exile out of paradise and keeping him unable to get through the veils while he used to go through them with Angles before and the request of Iblis for God to compensate him for his worship to God for thousands of years and the God's answer to him and giving him whatever he likes of life's goods and the most important of those goods is staying alive as long as life do exist and being in control of Adam's descendants and being close to them as blood in the vessels and Made (God) their chests a home for him and for his sons (Iblis) except the faithful slaves of God, such phrases are a lot in the Holy Book and they can be founded also in Holy Books that was revealed before Quran. <BR>
Meditate in these Holy phrases a meditation of thinking and not as memorizing a tale. Without understanding the desired meaning of God's speech, and you must check out the truth from these who who know Quran very well, or their viceroys, who act and do as they did, and don't take saying meant to give explanation to the phrases of the Book of your God who said: None knoweth its explanation save Allah. And those who are of sound instruction say: We believe therein; the whole is from our Lord; but only men of understanding really heed (Al-Imran: 7), and those who know are only who upon them the Holy Book was revealed and that is Muhammad (PUH) and his descendants who had the Prevention (They make no mistakes) and they know better. [Note: this paragraph contained a high level of philosophical terms which I couldn't translate nor understand, so it was approperiate to take the overall meaning and translate it] <BR>
And what was told of tidings from them (the Holy Family PUT) that growing proud was the first sin, so Iblis did say: O Lord, release me from prostration before Adam, and I used to worship you as no close Angel did nor a sent prophet, then the God did say to him: no need for your worshipping, but I want to be worshipped as I want not as you want. And so Iblis refused to prostrate, then God said to him: Get out of it, you are damned. Then said Iblis: O Lord! how? and you are the Just that does no wrong, so my reward for worshipping is false? Then God said to him: No, but ask anything of life's matter as a reward for your deeds and I shall give it to you. The first thing he asked was to be immortal until the time of the doomsday, so God said to him: it is yours.Then he asked to be in control of Adam's descendants, so God said to him: I made you of control. Then he asked to make him run through them as blood in vessels, so God said to him: I made you run through them. Then Iblis did say: no one would give a birth for one, shall be accompanied by two for me, and I will see them but they won't and I would be shaped in front of them in whatever shape I like, so the God said then: I give all of that. Then the damned (Iblis) said: O Lord, give me more. So then the God said: I made for you and your descendants homes in their chests. After all that Iblis did say: O Lord, this is enough for me. Then that he did say: O Lord by your Highness I would make them do mischiefs except your faithful slaves, then I shall come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right hands and from their left hands, and Thou wilt not find most of them beholden. <BR>
It was told about the explanation of the Holy phrase "then I shall come upon them from before them" is that "I will make them not serious in thinking of the doomsday" like telling them that God is merciful and only punishes for worshipping another, but everything else God can forgive you about. And "from behind them" that is "I will order them to keep on gathering money and be misers to keep it for their heirs", and "from their right hands" that is "I will worsen their believes and let them add and chang<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">e their creeds", and "from their left hands" that is "I will make their hearts in great love for joys and amusement and whatever like it." <BR>
From Ibn 'Abb&#226;s, that the first one to measure (compare) was Iblis, and he was wrong in this matter, and whoever af</FONT>ter him would do the same he would be paired by God in the doomsday with Iblis, and the measurement (comparement) is that when he said: You made me of fire and made him of mud (or clay), and that meant to be that I'm (Iblis speaking) of more honour than him (Adam) and better, because fire is higher and of more honour than mud, and so the prostrate must have been from him (Adam) to me (Iblis) and not the other wise by the measurements of honour and priority, and the damned didn't know the honour of Adam and of what God knows from his virtues (Adam's) and the Holy Lights that he bore in his descendants, and it will come from his descendants the prophets and their viceroys with the saints and the faithful, and the masters of the creation, Muhammad and his Household (family, descendants) that God wish is but to remove uncleanness far from them, and cleanse them with a thorough cleansing, who are the main reason for the creation of the universe and everything in it. And so he (Iblis) envied him (Adam) and got wicke<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">d. And for the God's saying "Lo! I am about to create a mortal out of mire, And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My Spirit, then fall down before him prostrate" (Sad: 71,72) the Prince of Believers ('Ali ben Abi T&#226;lib PUH) commented abou</FONT>t this: They all prostrated, except Iblis who got pride growing into him for his creation of fire and scorned the mud (or clay) creation, and so God gave him the delay for he (Iblis) deserved damnations, and for the completeness of his trouble, and the completeness of his mortality, so God said to him: Then lo! thou art of those reprieved, Till the Day of appointed time (Al-Hijr: 37,38). <BR>
Notice how much did the Prince of Believers (PUH) overflow us with the facts about this interesting matter of unique meanings and wisdom that could be deduced from its deepest secrets and its hidden jokes. We have left out most of his speech (PUH) for the fear of boredom, and it was told that after what God gave to Iblis from control and power, Adam (PUH) said: O Lord, you have given Iblis the control over my descendants and made him run as the blood in the vessel into them and all of the other things that you gave to him, so for what for me and my descendants? So God answered him: the wrong done would be counted as one, and the good done would be counted as ten. Then did Adam (PUH) say: O Lord, give me more, so the God answered: Repentance would be accepted until the soul would come to the throat [apparently meant at death time], then Adam (PUH) said: O Lord, give me more. So<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> the God answered: I will forgive no matter what, then Adam (PUH) said: O Lord this is quite enough. One questioner did say to Al-Imam Al-S&#226;diq (PUH): O may I be a ransom to you, for what did Iblis deserve all of what God gave him? he answered (PUH): for </FONT>something he did to God and God appreciated that for him, then the question did say: and what did he do may I be a ransom to you? he answered (PUH): for two bows (kneeling, in prayer) he did in heavens in a time of four thousands years. And it was told from<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Al-Nahj [Nahj Al-Bal&#226;gha, a book that collected speeches of&nbsp; 'Ali ben Abi T&#226;lib PUH] that Al-Imam 'Ali (PUH) said that he (Iblis) did pray two bows in heavens in six thousands years. It is not known if it is counted as years of earthly time, or in time o</FONT>f<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> heavens, and it is not quite far that both tales are true and God only knows. <BR>
From Tawoos and Moj&#226;hid: that Iblis before doing the sin was one of the Angels and his name was 'Az&#226;ziel, and he was one of the earth's inhabitants, and the inhabitants of ear</FONT>th from Angels were called the Djinn, and among Angels there were on like him in his worshipping and wisdom, so when he rebelled against God may praise be to Him, God damned him and made him a demon and called him Iblis, and he was noted as being a disbeliever in God's knowledge. The apparent from this tale that Iblis was one of the Angels opposes the apparent phrase from the Holy Book "all save Iblis. He was of the jinn, so he rebelled against his Lord's command" (Al-Kahf: 50) and also opposes the famous opinion among&nbsp; the wise men of Muslims and its tales and stories, and it is the base that all Muslims agreed on naturally and the repeated phrases in the Holy Book about this matter, and the most of the explanations made for them (the phrases), and even it o<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">pposes the thought of Iblis when he said: You created me of fire and created him of mud..etc and so this tale opposes the most famous opinions about the matter so be aware. <BR>
From Jameel ben Dar&#226;j said: I asked Ab&#226; 'Abdullah Al-S&#226;diq (PUH) about whether Ib</FONT>lis was one of the Angels or Djinn, so he said (PUH): Angels saw that he was one of them but only God knew that he wasn't one of them, and when was ordered to prostrate he did what he did. Some wise men that are into deep insight said that wise men of Islam differ in considering whether Iblis is one of the Angels or not. Most of the speakers about the matter and lot of our wise men [Shiites wise men are meant here] like Al-Shaikh Al-Mofeed and others that said that Iblis is one of the Djinn and not Angels, and then he said (Al-Shaikh Al-Mofeed) that tidings been told frequently from the Imam's of Guidance (PUT) about this fact, and it is true in the creed of Imamism. [Imamism: this term is coined by me and don't know if there is an equivalent term for it. It points out to the creed of believing in the 12 viceroys or Imams after the death of the prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him and his Household], and other branch believed that he (Iblis) was one of the Angels. <BR>
The clue of the second branch that believe<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">d that Iblis is one of the Angels is from some Hadith's (or speeches) and one of them is what have been mentioned before from Tawoos and Moj&#226;hid, and also believed that Iblis was one of the keepers of paradises, and he held the treasures of heavens and ea</FONT>rth, and other stuff had been said, but anyhow as you can see nothing of that is convenient to what was mentioned about the believe of the first branch which is the most choosen and the most supported with the confession of Iblis himself as mentioned before<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">. <BR>
It had been told from Al-Zajj&#226;j that he said: Holy phrases did differ in mentioning of what did the creation of Adam (PUH) start with. In one position in the Holy Book that God created him out of sand, and in other out of mud, and in another out of bla</FONT>ck mud, and also in another position out of clay. He continued: and all of the previous belong to one origin which is the sand, which is the origin of mud, and so God informed us that he made him out of sand, then made it into mud, then transferred into black mud and finally as clay. </P>
