<div style="text-align: left;">&lt;&gt;<big><small>It is mentioned that
Abraham
used to live in the deserts of the lands of Shem, then when he was
given Ishmael (PUH) from Hagar, theit matter became so heavy on Sarah
and she had been sad for this since she didn't have any children, so
Abraham complaint about this to God, so then God inspired unto him and
ordered him to move Ishmael and his mother away from her, so then he
said: O God where to? and to what place? So He said: to My place. Then
God got down Gabriel with Al-Bur&acirc;q [Al-Bur&acirc;q: in Islamic
believes, it is a heavenly creature created of light and by which the
prophet Muhammad (PUH) was able to travel to Jerusalem and then to
heavens in one night. Tidings about this event are mentioned in the
beginning of the chapter of Al-Isr&acirc;', which means "The Night
Journey"], so it carried them with Hagar to the place of God, and
Abraham used to say whenever they pass by a place with trees palms ,
used to say t Gabriel: O Gabriel in here? And he answeres him back: go
ahead, until they reached Mecca and put them in the place of the House
(Kaaba), so when they settled down in that place there were some trees
there and so Hagar and the others sat in the shadow of one of them, and
when Abraham wanted to leave Hagar said to him: O Abraham, are going to
leave us in a place that has no one around nor water or plants? So then
said Abraham: the One that ordered me to put you here will be enough
for you, and then he left them, but before leaving that spot he turned
his face towards them and said to God as it is mentioned in quran: </small></big><a
 name="014_037">Our Lord! Lo! I have settled some of my posterity in
an uncultivable valley near unto Thy holy House, our Lord! that they
may establish proper worship; so incline some hearts of men that they
may yearn toward them, and provide Thou them with fruits in order that
they may be thankful(Ibrahim:37). Then Hagar stayed with her son
Ishmael (PUH), and when it was noon time, Ishmael became thirsty and
asked for water from his mother, so then Hagar wandered in the valley
and called: is there anyone in the valley? Then Ishmael disappeared,
then she went over Al-Saf&acirc; [Mountain's name] and she saw a mirage
in the valley and she thought it was water so she came down and
approached it, so when she reached Al-Marw&acirc; [the name of the
passage in the valley] then Ishmael disappeared from her sight and then
she saw a mirage in the position of Al-Saf&acirc;, and so on she did
that for seven times, and on the seventh time and while she was on
Al-Marw&acirc; she looked to Ishmael (PUH) and water appeared under his
feet, so she came back to him and gathered the sand around it because
it was flowing and so she tightened the flow by gathering the sand
around it and that is why it is called Zamzam [Arabic: Zam = tightened,
strengthened. Literature]. The tribe of Jorhom at that time were
settling in `Araf&acirc;t [another mountain], so when the water
appeared in Mecca and the birds and the rest of animals started to
dwell around it they knew that there is some water and they followed
them, until then they saw a woman and a boy settlled there under a tree
and water appeared for both of them, so they said to Hagar: who are you
and what is wrong with you and with this boy? So she said: I am the
mother of the son of Abraham the friend of God and this is his son, so
they said to her: do you allow us to be near you? So then she took the
permission from Abraham because he used to visit them by any chance he
had, so then Abraham allowed them and the tribe of Jorhom settled down
near them, thus Hagar and Ishmael didn't stay alone, and on the third
time when Abraham checked them and saw many people around them he
turned to be so glad for this. Then Ishmael grew up and every member of
Jorhom's tribe gave them some camels and they used to make a living by
them, and then when Ishmael turned to be a man, God ordered Abraham to
build the House, so he asked: O God in which spot? So He answered back:
in the spot that I revealed the dome over Adam, and the dome remained
there even at the time of the flood at the time of Noah (PUH) and when
the whole earth was sunk down, God uplifted this dome and so she was
called the Saved House because it was saved from sinking [Saved House,
in Arabic: Al-Bayt Al-`Ateeq].<br>
