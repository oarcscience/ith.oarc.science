<center><font size=+3>Gospel of Luke</font></center>
The story of Luke is even weirder than that of Matthew and Mark, and he
was a physician from Antakya (Antioch) and he didn't see the Messiah at
all and he was taught the christianity from Polos (Paul) which was a fundamentalistic
jew against the christians and he didn't see the Messiah in his life and
used to harm christians, and they said that he found out that it's of no
use to harm the christians while he needed them so he preteneded to be
one of them and showed that he believed in the Messiah and he claimed that
he had an epileptic fit and the Messiah showed himself for him and touched
him and ordered him not to harm the christians, and since that time he
believed in him and the Messiah sent him to spread his gospel, and talking
about him would be long and bad to hear, and he legalized for them to eat
the carrion and the wine drinking and that he knew that faith only is enough
to servive without doing anything, and the writing of the gospel of Luke
was after that Mark wrote his own and that was after the death of Peter
and Paul, and some well-known christian writers wrote about Luke and his
gospel: he had mixed the lies of novels with the truth of the miracles,
and some of them said: Matthew and Mark are different in their writings
and if they agreed then their saying is more probable than the saying of
Luke, and the one who copied these lines, `Abdul-Waha&acirc;b Al-Najj&acirc;r
said: let the reader know that Luke mentioned many things in his gospel
adding to what was mentioned in the gospel of Matthew in some twenty locations,
some of them are miracles and some of them are different stories, and his
additions compared to Mark are counted as so much.
