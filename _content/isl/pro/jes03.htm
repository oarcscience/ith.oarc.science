<center><font size=+3>The Table And The Mutation Among The Israelites</font></center>
In the interpretation of Al-`Askiri (PUH) as attributed to the prophet
(PUH) that he said: O servants of God, when the people of Jesus asked him
to reveal a table from heaven and he asked God to do so, God did say then:
Lo! I send it down for you. And whoso disbelieveth of you afterward, him
surely will I punish with a punishment wherewith I have not punished any
of (My) creatures(Al-M&acirc;'idah:115). When it was revealed, those who
had the faith and their faith grew even stronger got saved, and those who
disbelieved then after God did mutate him either in the shape of a pig
or a monkey or a cat or a bear or in the shape of birds and creatures of
the sea, and so until four hundred of them were mutated. It is mentioned
that the table that was revealed for Jesus had nine types of food that
were founded by the Will of God and they were not of the food of this life
or the food of paradise, as it was mentioned, and it was one of the holiest
miracles for the prophets. The prince of believers (PUH) said in some of
his speeches: if you willed I shall talk about the Jesus of Mary, his pillow
was the stone and his clothes were the harshest and his food was the hunger
and his light at night was the moon and his shadows in winter were the
east and west of the lands, and his fruit were what the earth planted and
he had no wife to charm him nor a son that he would be sad for, nor money
that would grab his attention nor greed that would humiliate him, his own
transportation tool was his legs and his own servant was his own hands..etc.
In Irsh&acirc;d Al-Quloob (Guiding the Hearts) [a book's name] by Al-Daylami,
it is mentioned that Jesus said: my servant is my hands and my own animal
is my legs and my bed is the ground and my pillow is the stones and my
warmth in winter is the eastern of lands and my light at night is the moon
and my food is the hunger and my motto is my fear and my clothes are made
of wool and my fruit is what the earth planted for beasts, and so I sleep
and I have nothing at all, and wake up and I have nothing, and there is
no one on earth that is richer than I do. Apparently, the meaning of "his
food is the hunger" might be that he doesn't eat anything unless hunger
occupied him totally and he had lust for food and so the hunger is his
own food. The purpose of richness here is the richness of the soul and
the unnecessity for people, Al-Jaza'iri mentioned that.
<br>As attributed to Al-S&acirc;diq (PUH) that he used to say: fear God
and don't envy each other, for Jesus the son of Mary used to walk on the
lands and he went out for some destination and there was a short man with
him and he used to stay a lot with him and when Jesus ended up to the sea
he said: by the name of God, by the truth that He had given, and then he
walked on the surface of the water, and then the short man said when he
saw that: by the name of God, by the truth He had given, and he walked
on the surface of water and catched Jesus and he wondered about himself
and said: this is Jesus the Spirit of God walks on water and I do so too
then why he is preferred upon me? Then he was drowned in water and he asked
for help from Jesus and Jesus helped him out and said to him: what did
you say O short man? He answered: I said: this is Jesus the Spirit of God
walks on water and I do so too then why he is preferred upon me? and I
was amazed for myself, then Jesus said to him: you have put yourself in
a position that was not made for you so God hated you for what you said,
so repent, and the man repented and God got him back to the position that
God had put him in before so fear God and don't envy each other.
