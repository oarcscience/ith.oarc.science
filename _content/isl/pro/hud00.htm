<center><font size=+3>Hud (PUH)</font></center>
He is the prophet that was sent to '&Acirc;d ben 'Ewas ben Eram ben S&acirc;m
ben Nuh [i.e.ben Shem ben Noah] as it was reported, and Hud (PUH) is the
son of 'Abdullah ben Rab&acirc;h ben Khalood ben '&Acirc;d ben 'Ewas ben
Eram ben S&acirc;m ben Nuh (PUH), as mentioned in Safeenat Al-Bih&acirc;r
[book's name] for Al-Muhaddi&thorn; Al-Qommi, and it is the same as that
mentioned in Qisas Al-Anbiy&acirc;' [stories of prophets] for 'Abdul-Wah&acirc;b
Al-Najj&acirc;r. It is reported also that Hud is the son of Sh&acirc;likh
ben Arfakhshd ben Shem ben Noah (PUH), so the number of fathers between
the messenger and his nation is equal so between them and Shem only two
and no more, and for the first report about the fathers of Hud (PUH) there
is more than four fathers obviously. God the Exalted did say: And unto
(the tribe of) A'ad (We sent) their brother, Hud. He said: O my people!
Serve Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil)
?(Al-A`r&acirc;f:65), and the meaning, and God knows better, that We sent
to '&Acirc;d their brother Hud, and it is a joining for what was before
from the story of Noah (PUH) by God's saying: We sent Noah (of old) unto
his people, and he said: O my people! Serve Allah. Ye have no other God
save Him. Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an Awful Day(Al-A`r&acirc;f:59),
and God did make them the inhabitants of earth after the people of Noah
(PUH), and God did provide them with large bodies, and it was mentioned
that one of them could reach the tallness of seventy to one hundred cubits,
and as reported from Abi Ja`far Al-S&acirc;diq (PUH): they were like long
palm trees, one of them can hit the mountain and break a piece of it. And
it was said: as a sign of their might, one man of them can knock of rocks
by his hand. and they used to worship idols that they called gods, and
for this Hud (PUH) said to them: Would ye wrangle with me over names which
ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which no warrant from Allah hath
been revealed?(Al-A'r&acirc;f:71). They are the people that God destroyed
by the fatal wind, and they used to say to Hud (PUH) when he used to calls
them to worship God and worship no other god with Him: We think that you've
been under the spell of our gods for calling them with bad names.
<br>When Hud (PUH) called them to God and to His religion and even exaggerated
in his sermons and guiding them and warned them against the Will of the
Almighty and His punishment in this life and the after-life, all of that,
did not bring anything with them, then God saved the rains from them until
aridity became over them so that they can be aware of what happened to
them and get back to obey God, but that did nothing to them and their ego
increased, and in a speech reported to Al-Sajj&acirc;d (PUH) when someone
told him (PUH) by the purpose of criticism that your grandfather [the prophet
Muhammad PUH] said: our brothers wronged us and we fought them for their
wrong, so he (PUH) said in his answer: woe to you, don't you read the Quran?
And unto (the tribe of) A'ad (We sent) their brother, Hud(Al-A'r&acirc;f:65),
And unto Midian (We sent) their brother, Shu'eyb(Al-A'r&acirc;f:85), And
to (the tribe of) Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih(Al-A'r&acirc;f:73),
so they are like them, and they were brothers for them in the tribe and
not in religion, and in another reported speech he said to them: So God
destroyed A'ad and saved Hud, and destroyed Thamud and saved Salih..etc.
<br>And in Al-K&acirc;fi [a book's name] it is reported from Al-B&acirc;qir
(PUH), that Noah brought tidings for Shem in advance for the coming of
Hud and said to him: God will send a prophet called Hud, and he will call
his people to God but they will deny him and He will destroy them with
the wind, so whoever reaches his days let him believe in him and follow
him, and there were prophets between both of them. And in Al-Ikm&acirc;l
[a book's name] as reported from Al-S&acirc;diq (PUH) it is that when Noah
was about to die he called his followers and said to them: you have to
know that after my death there will be an absence in which tyrants will
appear, and God will save you by a viceroy from my descendants called Hud,
he has respect and calm look-likes, he looks like me in shape and manner,
and from them also (PUT) [meaning the Household members PUT]: when Hud
was sent, he was a descendant of Shem (PUH) and the others said who is
more stronger than we are so they were destroyed by the wind, and Hud foretold
his people about S&acirc;lih (PUH) and advised them to follow him, and
as mentioned from Al-B&acirc;qir (PUH) that prophets were sent in special
and general prophecy, and Hud was sent in a special prophecy to A'ad.
