Ezra, is the son of Sherahy&acirc; (Seraiah), and he is a prophet that
God inspired to him, and some groups of jews said that Ezra is the son
of God, and they say that he was called like that just because he revived
the Torah after being burned by Nebuchadnezzar as it is told in Majma`
Al-Bahrain [book's name], but it is well-known that jews made that out
after that christian called the Messiah the son of God, but let God be
Exalted above all what they say so highly, but they are both of them servants
of God and were ordered to spread the calls of God and to tell His laws
and regulations like the others, and as God said: Say: O People of the
Scripture! Come to an agreement between us and you: that we shall worship
none but Allah, and that we shall ascribe no partner unto Him, and that
none of us shall take others for lords beside Allah(Al-`Imr&acirc;n:64),
and so jews took him (Ezra) as a god as christian did with the Messiah,
Jesus the son of Mary, and a son of God as it is well-known, may God fight
against them wouldn't they understand.
<br>It is narrated that when God had mercy upon the Israelites and destroyed
Nebuchadnezzar and got them back to their lands and their life, and Ezra,
as they said, escaped from Nebuchadnezzar and got into a spring and disappeared,
so when they got back to their lands he got back with them and was among
them, and it is attributed to Al-S&acirc;diq (PUH) that he said about the
interpretation of God's saying: Or (bethink thee of) the like of him who,
passing by a township which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How
shall Allah give this township life after its death? And Allah made him
die a hundred years, then brought him back to life. He said: How long hast
thou tarried? (The man) said: I have tarried a day or part of a day. (He)
said: Nay, but thou hast tarried for a hundred years..etc(Al-Baqarah:259),
that it was revealed telling the story of Ezra, and some said it is the
story of Jeremiah (PUH), and Al-Sayid Al-Jaz&acirc;'iri in his tales said:
there was a debate about the one that God made dead for one hundred years
and then resurrected him, whether he is Jeremiah and Ezra and there had
been narrations about both of them.
<br>For the people of Scriptures [meaning christians and jews] it is pointed
out that it is Ezra, and it is mentioned that God inspired to Ezra (PUH):
O Ezra, if you did a sin don't look to how small it is but look to whom
you did the sin, and if I gave you some fortune don't look to how small
is it but look to who gave it you, and if you have an adversity don't complain
about Me to My creations as I do not complain about you to My angels when
your sins and secrets are obvious for Me. It is narrated by Al-S&acirc;diq
(PUH): when the Israelites did the sins and rebelled against God's commandments,
God wanted to put over them who would humble them and kill them and so
then God inspired to Jeremiah: O Jeremiah, no land I did choose from among
all of the lands and I put in it the best of trees and bore the worst of
fruit, and it is a long talk with lot of describtions about the Israelites
and their sins and bad habits in that holy spot, and then God explained
to Jeremiah: O Jeremiah, the land is Jerusalem, and what God planted in
it was the Israelites, the ones that God made them to live there, and as
long they worked with sins and changed the religion of God and disbelieved
and rebelled, then God shall take revenge of the wrong-doers, and He swore
by His own Exaltness that He shall test them by an adversity that the wisemen
shall be baffled with it and swore that He shall make over them the worst
of His servants by birth, and he shall kill their warriors and captivate
their women and destroy their Temple that they are proud of and he shall
throw their stones that they make pride of over people into the garbages
for one hundred years..etc, and it was as it is said with Nebuchadnezzar
and his torture, and we've mentioned his story in details before [please
check the chapter of Jesus], and that was the speech of God with Jeremiah
and I liked to mention it here because it mentions the name of a great
prophet whereas Quran didn't mention his name obviously, but the agreements
of all the interpreters of Quran, the Gospel and the Torah, all of those
agreements proved his existance as well as they agreed for the existance
of Daniel and Isaiah and other prophets, and as for Ezra, Quran mentioned
his name along with the name of the Messiah as for comparison.
<br>In a narration it is told that when Nebuchadnezzar killed whatever
he killed in the lands of Canaan and Iraq and then killed by God, then
went out Jeremiah riding an ass with some figs with him and some juice,
and then he looked at the beasts eating the dead bodies and he thought
for a moment and said: shall God resurrect those and they were eaten by
those beasts? and then God caused him to die in his place and it is as
God said: Or (bethink thee of) the like of him who, passing by a township
which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this
township life after its death? And Allah made him die a hundred years,
then brought him back to life(Al-Baqarah:259). So Jeremiah remained dead
for one hundred years and then God resurrected him and inspired to him:
how many days you've been there? he answered: maybe a day or some days,
and then God said to him: you remained for one hundred years..etc. We've
mentioned before that this thing happened with Ezra and not Jeremiah, and
we've explained that both versions of the story was mentioned and it might
be most probable on the side of Jeremiah more.
<br>As attributed to Ibn `Abb&acirc;s he said: Ezra said: O Lord, I looked
to all Your deeds and I knew how just You are in my mind, and remained
one thing I didn't understand, and that is when You reveal Your wrath upon
a village, You send down Your punishment and there are children in the
village, so then God ordered him to get out to the landscapes and it was
so hot so he saw a tree and sat under it and slept there and suddenly an
ant came and pinched him so he rubbed the earth with his leg and killed
lot of ants, so he knew that it is an example that was given for him as
to make people imagine it when they ask him about this, otherwise he wouldn't
stand against the Will of God and all of his deeds are done for the benefit
of the servants of God, and He is not to be asked about what He is doing
and they shall be asked.
<br>Then God said to him: O Ezra, if some people deserved My punishment
then I shall reveal it at the time of the end of life of those children,
so they shall be dead by their own destiny and the others shall be punishment
with My own punishment. No doubt that all of that was destined by His own
knowledgement and it is essential as the thought find it essential, that
everything happens in this world and no single bead in the darkness of
the earth and nothing wet or dry, unless they are all recorded and known.
They say that some scholars said that Ibn Al-Kaww&acirc;' said to the prince
of believers (PUH): who is older than his father in this life? Then said
the prince of believers (PUH): yes, he is Ezra, for he passed over a deserted
village while riding an ass and carrying with him some milk and juice,
and when passed over this village he said: shall God revive this after
its death? So God then caused him to die for one hundred year and his descendants
generated and then God resurrected him, so these are sons that are older
than their father. In another narration it is mentioned that Ezra went
out of home and his wife was pregnant in her last month of pregnancy and
he was fifty years old at that time, so his son later on met him and he
was one hundred years old, and God resurrected Ezra at the same age that
he was in. This is the last thing we would like to mention about this matter.
