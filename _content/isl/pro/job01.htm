<center><font size=+3>The Back of Gifts From God to Job (PUH)</font></center>
What is mentioned about this matter is that God ordered His servant Job
to strike the ground with his leg, and when he did that, a spring appeared
and been told that this is a spring that is cool bath and a refreshing
drink, and so he had a bath with it and drank until he was satisfied and
so his appearance and his inside were cured, and what is apparent from
the holy phrase that it was only one spring and he drank and had a bath
from it for God's saying "This (spring) is a cool bath and a refreshing
drink" which denotes a single form and that the bath and drinking was from
one source. They say that there were two springs so he drank from one and
bathed with the other and then God made him healthy again and banished
all the pains that were in him and gave him back his beauty and his dignity
so that if someone that saw him while he was sick wouldn't know him after
being healthy again, and thus, his wife Ramhah the daughter of Joseph the
Righteous (PUH) came to him and did not know him and so she asked him about
her sick husband Job, and there were a dialogue between them about his
characterisitics, and then he identified hisself to her and told her that
he is Job and that God made him healthy again, so when she turned to be
sure of that she fell prostrating to thank God and God also gave her back
her beauty and youth for her patience and her care for her husband and
her sincerity and for sharing his adversities, and although he lost everything
she stood beside him serving him and taking care of him and so she was
equal to him in his adversities, for this when Job swore that he must beat
her one hundred times by flogging, his Lord ordered him to beat her but
as if he does not beat her and never hurt her and so Job can satisfy the
oath that he made and this is in God saying: And (it was said unto him):
Take in thine hand a branch and smite therewith, and break not thine oath(S&acirc;d:44),
and it is a full hand of stems or something like it for he swore that he
must flog her for one hundred times for something that she said and he
denied, so God said to him: take a branch as much as the number of beats
that you swore with and then strike her all at once and you did your oath
and did not oppose the commandment of your Lord, and it is mentioned by
Ibn `Abb&acirc;s that the reason for this that the Satan met her in the
shape of a physician and she called him to cure Job so he said to her:
I will cure him but he should say to me then "you cured me" and I do not
ask for more than that, and she said yes, and when she suggested that to
Job he swore to flog her.
<br>Some of the tales that are suitable for this matter is what was mentioned
by Al-S&acirc;diq (PUH): God tests the faithful man with every test and
take out his soul in many ways but never test him by removing his mind,
don't you see Job (PUH) how the Satan took all his riches and children
and everything he had but did not take control over his mind and left that
for him to remember God with it. He (PUH) also said: when in the doomsday
the beautiful woman that astrayed by her beauty is brought and she would
say: O Lord, You made me pretty and faced what I faced, and then Mary is
brought and they will say to her (the woman): are you better than her?
I made her beautiful and she did not astray, and the handsome man that
was astrayed because of his beauty and he would say: O Lord, You made me
handsome and I faced what I faced from women, and then Joseph is brought
and it is said to him (the man): are you more handsome than him? I made
him handsome and he did not astray, and then the man that astrayed because
of his troubles is brought and he would say: O Lord, Your adversities were
so tough that made me astray, and then Job is brought and it is said to
him (the man): are your adversities are more than his? I tested him with
much more adversities but he did not astray. The meaning os astray here
is doing the sins and may exceed that to disbelieving and refusing the
religion, so we take refuge by God, the Exalted, from the evil of the devil
and from the reasons of disbelieving and from the bad spirit talk, and
we shall ask Him, the Exalted, for forgiveness and health, by His beloved
the prophet (PUH) and his Household the chosen (PUT). We've pointed out
that God gave Job's wife, Rahmah the daughter of Joseph, her youth back
as well as He did to Job with gifts, and she gave birth to twenty six males,
and he had seven males and seven females that Go resurrected them, because
God tested him for no sins he made for seven years, but God's judgements
desired that as a test for his faith and He is never asked about His deeds
but only them will be asked. He (Al-S&acirc;diq PUH) also said: God tested
Job for no sins he made and he was patient until he was mocked at by his
enemies and the prophets can't bear mocking, and after God's gifts to him
and his health back, Job was asked: what was the worse thing you faced
during this period? He said: mocking of the enemies. They say also that
God rained him in his home with gold and he used to collect it, and when
the wind blows up something away, he used to ran after it and then Gabriel
(PUH) said to him: aren't you satisfied Job? He answered then: who is satisfied
enough from his Lord's gifts?
<br>As attributed to Al-S&acirc;diq (PUH): Job (PUH) with all what he was
tested with, he never had a bad smell and never had an ugly shape and never
been bleeding and people never saw him dirty and they never felt afraid
of him for his shape, and worms did not ever approached his body, and this
is how God does to all the prophets that He puts under the test, but people
kept away from him because of his poverity and weakness for their ignorance
for what (gifts) he had in God's hands.
<br>As attributed to some scholars that he (Al-S&acirc;diq PUH) said also:
it is not denied that the adversities and pains that Job had in his body
and his household and his riches reached a level of sadness and pain that
exceed the pain that would someone with leprosy would have, and it is not
denied that the pains increased for him, but it denied for him everything
that would make people disgusted. That was an answer for him (PUH) for
the claims that say: that Job had some diseases that made people disgusted
for because of the smell of the shape and that the meat of his body was
melting down and he had worms in his body and whenever something falls
from his body he gets it back to its place seeking God's blessings and
people then threw him later on to the trash outside of the town, and his
wife was always with him and always seeking for help for him and they used
to give some help to her, and whatever he lost of riches and children and
health was because of the Satan, and God ordered the Satan with this and
said to him: I gave permission for you over his money, his children, his
farms, his sheeps and his body except of his mind, his eyes, his tongue
and his hearing, so then the Satan breathed at him and he made him like
one ulcer from the top of his head to the tip of his foot and he stayed
like that for long time praising God until his body had some worms in it,
and the worm used to get out of his body and he gets it back to its position
saying: get back to your position that God created you from, and he smelled
bad which made the people of the town got him out to the trash our of the
town..etc. This is something that no one bear to mention unless it was
for mocking.
<br>There are many weird and amazing stories and only God knows everything
that was, but what is supposed by the rules of justice is what we've mentioned
before about the rights of the of viceroys of God and of the One who chose
them to accomplish such commandments, and God is the One that we seek for
help and He has the commandments and no strength except by Him, then let
a just man look at the tales of such exaggerating narrators and let him
judge by his heart, they said that the Satan when to some monks that used
to be with him (Job) and they were on mountains worshipping God, so he
came to them in a shape of an old man and he said to them: let us go to
that servant of adversities and ask him about his adversities, so they
rode their mules and they came to him, and when they went closer, their
moles kept away because of his bad smell, so they tied them together and
went to him by walking and they sat with him and asked him about the reason
for his troubles, and they said to him: we see that adversities were revealed
upon you for your bad soul and for something you keep a secret in you and
you show something opposite to it..etc. There is a long talk from them
and his answers to them were also likewise and it is heavy to be mentioned,
until he said to them: if only I can sit in front of my Lord to give my
clues, and then God sent a cloud and a speaker spoke from it with ten thousand
tongues and languages saying: O Job give your clues for I am close to you
and I will always be. A narrator said: then Job wore his apron and kneeled
down and said: You've tested me with such adversities and You know that
no two things were offered to me but I shall choose the hardest one to
my body and I never had food from my own unless there was a wretch with
me on my table, he (the narrator) continued: then he was said unto him
(Job): O Job who made worshipping beloved to you? Who made you worship
God while people are not aware? You also praise Him while people are sleeping,
do you make favour to God what God has the favour for you? When he heard
that from his Lord he took some sand and put it in his mouth and said:
You, my Lord, did all that for me, so then God revealed an angel down and
he kicked the ground with his feet and a water spring appeared and he washed
him with that water and he got back to the best of his conditions..etc.
This is as we see is something we deny and it is something that could be
for someone denoted to be a prophet.
