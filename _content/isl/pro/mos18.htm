<center><font size=+3>The Chieftains and `Iwaj ben `In&acirc;q and what
Happened With Them</font></center>
As Al-&THORN;a`labi mentioned: God promised Moses to make him live with
his people in the holy lands, which was the lands of Shem, and there lived
also the tyrants, or the giants, the descendants of `Iml&acirc;q ben L&acirc;wi
(Levi) ben Shem ben Noah [could not find any close record for this names
chain], so God ordered Moses and his people to go the lands of Shem and
said to him: O Moses I detined it as a living place for you so fight against
the foes for I will bring victory to you, and take twelve chieftains from
your folks, a chieftain from each tribe to take care of the tribe and take
their covenants to do what they are ordered to do, so Moses then chose
the chieftains, one chieftain from each tribe and made them the rulers
of their tribes and so Moses went along with the Israelites..etc, and in
this narration some exaggerations especially about `Iwaj ben `In&acirc;q
and about him being one of the giants in the lands of Shem [notice that
in Torah, it is mentioned the name of Anak, a progenitor of giants, and
the name is close to Arabic, and even closer when read in Hebrew, so the
story might be about one of the children of Anak].
<br>In brief what he mentioned is that when Moses walked with the Israelites
towards the lands of Shem (Canaan) he sent spies before him to see the
conditions and so he sent the twelve chieftains to spy for him so one man
met them and he was `Iwaj ben `In&acirc;q so he took them all and made
them in his cloth and went to his wife and said to her: look to those people
that claim that they want to fight against us, and he threw them between
her hands and said: shall I crash them with my feet? But his wife said:
no but release them to let them tell their people what they saw, and so
he did. They say that `Iwaj lived for three thousands years until he was
killed by Moses ben Amram (PUH), and they say that the height of Moses
was ten cubits and the length of his staff was also ten cubits and he jumped
as high as ten cubits and stroke `Iwaj with it (the staff) but he stroke
only his foot's top and killed him and then some of his (Moses') people
came and cutt of his head, and when he was killed he fell upon the Nile
of Egypt so he was made as a bridge for a year. his mother was `In&acirc;q,
one of Adam's daughters, and she died during the life of her father Adam,
and the narration of Al-&THORN;a`labi is long about this matter, and he
mentioned that because of the height of `Iwaj, he used to pick up a whale
from the sea and raise it up with his hands and cook it by the sun and
then eat it.
<br>What they have mentioned about his height is unbelievable and it bears
no fruit to discuss it. They say that during the Flood he came to Noah
and said to him: carry me with you in the Ark but Noah refused to do so
and that water covered everything on earth and yet it did not exceed his
knees. As for the chieftains that Moses sent to the giants in the lands
of Shem to spy on them, they got back in safe to him from their travel
and they were absent for forty days and saw strange things and found out
that there is no human can fight them (the giants) so they decided to keep
what they saw of strange things as a secret and never tell any one of the
Israelites or they will never go with Moses to such a thing, so they made
a covenant with each other that they will keep it as a secret and not tell
any one except of Moses and Aaron and they will decide what to do.
<br>So they went along and they reached their folks and then got to Moses
and told him about what they saw, but then they broke the covenant and
everyone of them started to tell his tribe about what they saw and advises
them not to go with Moses to fight the giants, except of Joshua ben Nun
and Caleb ben Jephunneh as it was said, and he (Caleb) is the husband of
Mary the sister of Moses and Aaron. When the folks head from the chieftains
what was scary for them they raised their voices crying and saying: wish
if we were dead in the lands of Egypt and never were out of it and God
were not to let us into these lands so that our fortunes and our women
would be a gain for them, then they got ready to get back to Egypt and
denied to go with Moses and said to him that there are giant people there,
so Moses said to them: the One that saved you and splitted the sea for
you is able to make you win against them, but they denied to do so and
decided to go back to Egypt, so then Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes
and said to them: go to the giants through the gate and when you go there
you will win against them for God will fullfil his promise to you to let
you win against them and we've seen them and tested them and they have
weak hearts although their bodies are powerful, so do not be afraid of
them and leave it all for God if you were believers. Then the Israelites
desired to throw them with stones and refused their commands and said:
O Moses, we will never go in there as long they are there so go with your
Lord and fight for we are staying here, so then Moses turned to be so angry
and prayed against them and said: My Lord! I have control of none but myself
and my brother, so distinguish between us and the wrong-doing folk(Al-M&acirc;'idah:25),
and he finished praying a cloud appeared on "Qobbat Al-Zomor" [maybe this
phrase means "on the crowds"], and God inspired to Moses: until when they
will not believe in you and the miracles? I shall destroy them all and
make for you who is mighter and more in number, so then Moses regretted
when he prayed against them and said: O Lord, if You destroyed them all
people and nations would say that these people are killed because You could
not bring them into the holy lands, and You are the Merciful that forgive
the sins, so forgive them for their sins and do not destroy them, so then
God said: I forgave them but I forbade them from going into the holy lands
except of my servants Joshua and Caleb, and I shall keep them dwelling
on earth for forty years, as much as the number of days they spent spying
on the giants, and We shall flip their dead bodies in these deserts and
their children will go into it, and that is God's saying: For this the
land will surely be forbidden them for forty years that they will wander
in the earth, bewildered. So grieve not over the wrongdoing folk(Al-M&acirc;'idah:26).
They were six hundred thousand warriors added to them the families and
women and children, so they were all during these forty years travelling
hardly and when night comes they find themselves in the same position that
they travelled from.
<br>During that time, the ten chieftains that broke their covenant died,
and they died suddenly in a disgusted way during the Wandering, and also
died those who exceeded twenty years old of men except of Joshua and Caleb,
and none of those who said: So go thou and thy Lord and fight! We will
sit here(Al-M&acirc;'idah:24) did enter Jericho. So, when all died and
the forty years passed and other generations of them appeared, they went
to fight the giants and God made the victory for them and won against them
and they lived there after the Wandering. After all these adversities God
did say: O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured
you and how I preferred you to (all) creatures(Al-Baqarah:47).
<br>Apparently, the holy phrase points out to the favours of God for the
Israelites during the Wandering and before the Wandering and after the
Wandering, for He saved them from the evil of the pharaoh and his deeds
and got them out of his slavery and destroyed him with his people, and
then after the Wandering He made them rule the lands, and we've talked
a lot about the Wandering&nbsp; for it has lot of stories about it, and
to take the sermons out of what happened to the folks of this story, and
all is for God the One, and no strength except by Him.
