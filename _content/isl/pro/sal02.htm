<center><font size=+3>The Land of S&acirc;lih's (PUH) People</font></center>

<p>We've pointed out previously their living places although there is some
controversy that had not been under discussion, so after tracing back we've
found out that it lies between Sh&acirc;m (modern Syria and surroundings)
and Hij&acirc;z (in KSA) in a place called Al-Hijr. God said: Though ye
hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful?(Al-Sho`ar&acirc;':149),
and from Ibn-`Abb&acirc;s as reported in interpreting the meanings of this
holy phrase: they used to build castles in every position and hew houses
in the mountains to be their dwellings places in winter so it is better
and warmer, and &THORN;emud was in W&acirc;di Al-Qur&acirc; [= Valley of
Villages] between Medina and Sh&acirc;m, and A'ad was in Yemen, and the
ages of &THORN;emud's people used to range between one thousand years and
three hundred years. And in His saying: Ye choose castles in the plains(Al-A`r&acirc;f:74),
meaning that they used to build the castles in the plains, and it is said
that they used to make it there to take a rest in them. Abdul-Wah&acirc;b
Al-Najj&acirc;r [another person that has also a book about prophets] said
in his stories: Their homes were in Al-Hijr and it is between Hij&acirc;z
and Sh&acirc;m in W&acirc;di Al-Qur&acirc; and they are apparent still
til this very day, and some of my friends visited it and got into the king's
home and it was a house with some rooms and has a large hall and carved
into stone, and the place of their dwellings is known today as Faj Al-N&acirc;qah
[= The Hole of The She-Camel].
<br>Al-Mas'udi said: Their remains are still obvious in the way as you
come back from Sh&acirc;m, and Al-Hijr of &THORN;emud is in the southern-east
part of the land of Midian and it is near the bay of Aqabah. And in the
speech of S&acirc;lih (PUH) as been told by the Holy Book: And remember
how He made you viceroys after A'ad and gave you station in the earth.
Ye choose castles in the plains and hew the mountains into dwellings(Al-A`r&acirc;f:74)
and this is a point to denote the origin of &THORN;emud and their time
and that they are the remains of A'ad, and this is as said by some historians.
The people of Hadramawt claim that the lands of &THORN;emud were part of
A'ad colonies, so Abdul-Wah&acirc;b Al-Najj&acirc;r said: This is closer
to the logic and doesn't conflict with what was said before, and also he
reported some speeches and tidings in this section from european orientalists
and also copied from the book of Jorji Zed&acirc;n (Al-`Arab Qabl Al-Isl&acirc;m)
[=Arabs before Islam] and also from so many others discussing &THORN;emud
and the origin of &THORN;emud and their time, and he mentioned his point
of view about all of that in a long speech that we don't need to mention
here after stating the holy phrase that discusses their situation and after
what was traced from the Prophet and his Household (PUT), and we've explained
as much as possible for those who has an attentive ears and an awakened
heart.
<br>Then in the speech about the prophets and messengers and their situations
with their people, Quran ordered them one by one by names and moves from
one before to the one after, and it is a clue for their time and place
order, as understood by logic, look into the chapters of Al-A`r&acirc;f,
Hud, Al-Anbiy&acirc;', Al-Mu'minun, Al-Sho`ar&acirc;', Al-Qasas, Fossilat,
and the others, you will see them mostly moving from one known story to
another one the same as in the story of Noah to the story of Hud, and the
story of S&acirc;lih to the story of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (PUT). It
is for sure that their prophecy is proved according to the time order that
Quran provided as to mention Jacob after Isaac and he is after Abraham,
and also Solomon after David, and Jesus after Moses, and it is after Abraham
and after Noah and after Adam, and their end is the prophet Muhammad and
his Household (PUT). [here comes some lines that I couldn't translate easily.
They bear much philosophical terms I guess plus they add nothing to the
subject].
<p>Some scholars mentioned about this matter that deserves to be mentioned
here which is comparing `Ali ben Abi T&acirc;lib, the prince of believers
(PUH), with the She-Camel of S&acirc;lih, because there are some speeches
(Hadiths) that had been proved and traced back to the prophet (PUH), and
also it is mentioned a comparison between Al-Zahr&acirc;' [meaning F&acirc;tima,
the daughter of the prophet] with her (the she-camel) for some reasons.
As traced back from the prophet (PUH) that he said to `Ali (PUH): The most
unblessed in this life is the one who killed the she-camel of S&acirc;lih
and the one who will strike you on the head O `Ali until the blood of your
head dye your beard. For many times it is reported from him (PUH) [meaning
`Ali ben Abi T&acirc;lib] that he compared his killer with the killer of
the she-camel of S&acirc;lih, and it is mentioned that some historians
wrote papers and explained in length the possible reasons for such comparison.
Some scholars said: whoever meditates through it will see the similarities,
and that is `Ali (PUH) was a miracle shown by God through the prophet Muhammad
(PUH) and he said (`Ali PUH): And what miracle is greater than me?. Al-F&acirc;dhil
Al-Mo`tazali Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed [person's name] in his interpretations:
The history of this life is known and checked for the time after the flood
until this very day, and never reached us in this period of time any tidings
about any man from Arabs, Persians, Turks, Indians, Romans or any others,
that has such bravery or even being close to him (`Ali PUH) in any character
of completeness.
<br>The owner of the book called "Al-`Adasiy&acirc;t" [?] mentioned that:
Gabriel (PUH) said to the prophet (PUH): God sent `Ali with the prophets
in secret, and sent him with you in public. His birth (`Ali PUH) was in
the Holy Kaaba, which is the rock of God's shrine, as the she-camel got
out from a rock and this had never happened for any prophet or a viceroy
of a prophet, and he (PUH) used to give the wisdom and knowledge for people
as the she-camel used to give the people, and the reason for his killing
is the same as this for killing the she-camel if anyone did meditate in
both cases, and it is a long story, and after his killing they killed his
son, Al-Husain (PUH), as they (people of S&acirc;lih) killed the weanling
of the she-camel, and so on with such similarities, and this is all what
we could mention in explaining the situation of S&acirc;lih (PUH) with
his people, and may God help us.
