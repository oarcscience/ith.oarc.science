<div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big>The Prophet Lot (PUH)<br>
</big></big></big>
<div style="text-align: left;">We've pointed out before that the story
of Lot is connected to the story of Abraham (PUH) and also connected to
the stories of his sons Ishmael and Isaac for they are mentioned with
him in many holy phrases and tales because they all share the same call
to God and they all lived in the same time, and the religion of all is
the same religion of Abraham (PUH), and he is their master and the one
that was a subject to many troubles, and God revealed upon him only the
books that explain the religion and laws, and they followed him for
whatever he said, and Lot got out with him when he was banished from
his own lands and he was the first to believe in him, and Lot is the
nephew and the maternal cousin for Abraham and this matter had been
investigated when we talked about the conditions of Abraham. God said: <a
 name="029_026">And Lot believed him, and said: Lo! I am a fugitive
unto my Lord(Al-`Ankabut:26). Lot was mentioned in quran in fourteen
chapters: Al-An`&acirc;m, Al-A`r&acirc;f, Hud, Al-Hijr,
Al-Anbiy&acirc;', Al-Haj, Al-Shu`ar&acirc;', Al-Naml, Al-`Ankabut,
Al-S&acirc;ff&acirc;t, S&acirc;d, Q&acirc;f, Al-Qamar, Al-Tahreem. We
mentioned before that when quran comes to mention about any prophet's
conditions, it either mention their conditions in details or in brief.<br>
They mentioned that Lot owned many riches and cattles of camels,
horses, sheeps and cows and other animals, along with servants and gold
and silver, like his uncle Abraham, and only God knows, and after they
had travelled out of Iraq to the lands of Shem and Palestine, Lot (PUH)
most probably settled in Jordan, and the village he settled in was
called Sadoom (Sodom) and beside it the village of `&Acirc;moor&acirc;'
(Gomorrah). This is what Al-Mas`udi said in Muruj Al-&ETH;ahab: And God
sent Lot to Sodom and its five villages are: Sabghah, `Amrah,
Edm&acirc;', Sabugh and B&acirc;li` [maybe the Hebrew names are:
Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, Bela and Zoar], and the people of Lot are
Al-Mu'tafika, and this name is derived from "Ifk" which means "lying"
and this is the opinion of whoever followed derivation method, and God
said: </a><a name="053_053">And Al-Mu'tafikah He
destroyed(Al-Najm:53), and this land is located in the lands of Shem
after Jordan and Palestine, and torturing stones there can be seen by
travellers, and Lot lived there for something more than twenty years
and used to call the people for God but they did not believe in him so
then they were taken away by God's punishment according what God
mentioned about them (in quran), then God punished the people of Lot at
the time of Abraham (PUH) for their deeds and doings.<br>
The people of Lot were people of evil and took off the cover of
shyness, and they were never shy to do the bad things that even animals
deny to do as well as the human souls, and they were never shy of each
other to do the most awful things, so all would gather, the old and the
young, the father and the son, the master and the slave, they all
gather together to commit sodomy with a strange man even in front of
their women and daughters, and they used to fart in their gatherings
and clubs as it is interpreted by God's saying: </a><a name="029_029">and
commit ye not abomination in your meetings(Al-`Ankabut:29).<br>
