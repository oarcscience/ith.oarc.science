<center><font size=+3>The Wife of The Pharaoh, &Acirc;siyyah bent Muz&acirc;him</font></center>
She was one of the Israelites and was a faithful woman, and she was keeping
her faith a secret to avoid the pharaoh, and when Moses defeated the wizards
and they all believed in Moses and his Lord and lot of the Israelites showed
their faith in Moses as well, she then showed his faith and her love to
God and her tongue mentioned the sanctification for Him, so when the pharaoh
knew about that, he got extremely angry and forbade her but she did not
stop, so then he started to torture her, and as attributed to Ibn-`Abb&acirc;s
that he said: the pharaoh took his wife &Acirc;siyyah and when he knew
that she was a believer and tortured her in several ways to let her stop
believing, so then Moses passed by while she was being tortured so she
complained to him by moving her finger so he prayed to God to have some
relief towards her and so God did and she did not feel the pains of torture
and she did not die because of the torture and she said while being tortured:
My Lord! Build for me a home with thee in the Garden, and deliver me from
Pharaoh and his work, and deliver me from evil-doing folk(Al-Tahreem:11),
so God inspired to her to lift her head up and so she did and she saw her
home in paradise and it was built with pearls so she laughed, and the pharaoh
then said: look how crazy she is, she laughs while being tortured. Some
say that she was tortured under the sun and when everyone is gone away
from her the angels came down to her and showed her her house in paradise.
<br>As it is attributed to the prophet (PUH) he said: the best women of
paradise are four, Khadijah bent Khuwaylid [The prophet's wife] and F&acirc;timah
bent Muhammad [the prophet's daughter], and Mary the daughter of Amram
[Mary the mother of Jesus], and &Acirc;siyyah bent Muz&acirc;him, the pharaoh's
wife. In a long narration that he (PUH) considered Ezekiel and his job
and his wife and children, and his wife was the brusher for the pharaoh's
daughters and she was a believer and once the brush fell off her hand and
she said: by name of God! Then the daughter of the pharaoh said: he is
my father, but the brusher the wife of Ezekiel said: no but He is my Lord
and your Lord and your father's Lord, so the daughter told her father the
pharaoh and so he called her with her children and said to her: who is
your lord? She said: my and your lord is God, so then he ordered for an
oven made of copper and it was boiled and then called her with her children
and warned her but she did not get back to his religion and so when he
wanted to throw her with her children into the oven she said: I request
from you to gather my bones with my children's bones and bury them, he
said then: your request will be fulfilled for the rights you have unto
us, so then he ordered their children to be thrown into the oven one by
another while she was looking at them and the last of them was an infant
which said to his mother: be patient mother you are on the truthful way,
and then she was thrown into the oven with her infant, until he (PUH) said
at the end: and the wife of the pharaoh was one of the Israelites and she
was a faithful woman and she used to worship God in secret until the pharaoh
killed the wife of Ezekiel then she saw the angels flying with her soul
and she was sure of that by many signs and so her faith increased and while
she was like that the pharaoh went to her and told her what did he do,
so then she said: woe to you O pharaoh! how dare you against God the Exalted,
so he said to her: maybe you've been crazy like your mate before, so she
said to him then: not been crazy but I believed in God, my Lord and your
Lord and the Lord of the worlds, until he (PUH) said: then the pharaoh
swore that she will taste the death or disbelieve in the God of Moses,
and then he (PUH) said: then her mother met her and asked her to be with
the pharaoh but she denied to be so and said: to disbelieve in God then
this is something I will not do, so then the pharaoh ordered to bring her
and she was stended by four wedges in her hands and legs and kept on torturing
her until she died. So may peace be upon her with her mate.
