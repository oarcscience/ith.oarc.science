<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Sage</span> his Satire ended; and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Shah</span><br> With Magic-mighty <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wisdom</span> his pure <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Will</span><br> Leaguing, its Self-fulfilment wrought from Heaven.<br> And Lo! from Darkness came to Light <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A Child</span>,<br> Of Carnal Composition Unattaint,&#8212;<br> A Rosebud blowing on the Royal Stem,&#8212;<br> A Perfume from the Realm of Wisdom wafted;<br> The Crowning Jewel of the Crown; a Star<br> Under whose Augury triumph&#8217;d the Throne.<br> For whose Auspicious Name they clove the Words<br> "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;mat</span>"&#8212;Incolumity from Evil&#8212;<br> And "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ausem&aacute;n</span>"&#8212;the Heav&#8217;n from which he came<br> And hail&#8217;d him by the title of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span>.<br> And whereas from no Mother Milk he drew,<br> They chose for him a Nurse&#8212;her name <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abs&aacute;l</span>&#8212;<br> Her Years not Twenty&#8212;from the Silver Line<br> Dividing the Musk-Harvest of her Hair<br> Down to her Foot that trampled Crowns of Kings,<br> A Moon of Beauty Full; who thus elect<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span> of Auspicious Augury<br> Should carry in the Garment of her Bounty,</p>  
<p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></A></p>  
<p>Should feed Him with the Flowing of her Breast.<br> As soon as she had opened Eyes on him<br> She closed those Eyes to all the World beside,<br> And her Soul crazed, a-doting on her Jewel,<br> Her Jewel in a Golden Cradle set;<br> Opening and shutting which her Day's Delight,<br> To gaze upon his Heart-inflaming Cheek,<br> Upon the Darling whom, could she, she would<br> Have cradled as the Baby of her Eye.<br> In Rose and Musk she wash&#8217;d him&#8212;to his Lips<br> Press&#8217;d the pure Sugar from the Honeycomb;<br> And when, Day over, she withdrew her Milk,<br> She made, and having laid him in, his Bed,<br> Burn&#8217;d all Night like a Taper o&#8217;er his Head.</p>  
<p>Then still as Morning came, and as he grew,<br> She dress&#8217;d him like a Little Idol up;<br> On with his Robe&#8212;with fresh Collyrium Dew<br> Touch&#8217;d his Narcissus Eyes&#8212;the Musky Locks<br> Divided from his Forehead&#8212;and embraced<br> With Gold and Ruby Girdle his fine Waist.&#8212;</p>

<p>So rear&#8217;d she him till full Fourteen his Years,<br> Fourteen-day full the Beauty of his Face,<br> That rode high in a Hundred Thousand Hearts;<br> Yea, when <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span> was but Half-lance high,<br> Lance-like he struck a wound in every One,<br> And burn&#8217;d and shook down Splendour like a Sun.</p>
