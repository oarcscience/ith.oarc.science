"One knocked at the Beloved's Door; and a Voice asked from within, 'Who is there?' and he answered,' It is I: Then the Voice said, This House will not hold Me and Thee.' And the Door was not opened. Then went the Lover into the Desert, and fasted and prayed in Solitude. And after a Year he returned, and knocked again at the Door. And again the Voice asked, 'Who is there?' and he said, 'It is Thyself!' and the Door was opened to him."</p>

One of Noah's Sons (Canaan or Yam, some think) would not believe. "And the Ark swam with them between waves like Mountains, and Noah called up to his Son, who was separated from him, saying, 'Embark with us, my Son, and stay not with the Unbelievers.' He answered, 'I will get on a Mountain which will secure me from the Water.' Noah replied, 'There is no security this Day from the Decree of God, except for him on whom he shall have Mercy.' And a Wave passed between them, and he became one of those who were drowned. And it was said, 'Oh Earth, swallow up thy waters, and Thou, oh Heaven, withhold thy Rain!' And immediately</p>

<p>Page <A HREF="saab16.htm#page_27">27</A> and elsewhere&#8212;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Throne</span> is spoken of as 'under Foot.' The Persepolitan Sculpture still discovers its King keeping his Chair as Europeans do with a separate Footstool. But in J&aacute;mi's time The Throne was probably of the same Fashion that Chardin saw Sol&iacute;man twice crowned on 200 years after&#8212;perhaps the very same&#8212;"Un petit Tabouret carr&eacute;," 3 feet high, Golden and Jewelled, on which the Prince gathers up his feet in Oriental fashion, so as it serves for Throne and Footstool too. "Ce Tabouret, hors le Temps qu&#8217;il sert &agrave; cette C&eacute;remonie se garde avec grand Soin dans le Tr&eacute;sor Royal qui est au Donjon de la Forteresse d&#8217;Ispahan," where also, to prove the Conservatism of Persia so far as Habits go," J&#8217;ai&#8217;vu," he says, "des Habits de Tamurlan; ils sont taill&eacute;s tout comme ceux qu&#8217;on fait aujourd&#8217;hui, sans aucune difference." So the Mirrors used in Persia 200 years ago were commonly of polished Metal, just as J&aacute;mi so often describes. [Sol&iacute;man's 2nd Coronation came about because of his having fallen so ill from Debauchery, that his Astrologers said his first must have taken place under an Evil conjunction of Stars&#8212;so he must be crowned again&#8212;which he was&#8212;Chardin looking on both times.]</p>

<p>I have proposed "The Planets" for those mysterious "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Seven and Four</span>." But there is a large Choice, especially for the ever mystical "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Seven</span>"&#8212;Seven Commandments; 7 Climates; 7 Heavens, etc. The "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Four</span>" may be the 4 Elements, or even the 4 acknowledged Mahommedan Gospels&#8212;namely, The Pentateuch, Psalms, New Testament, and Kur&aacute;n. For Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n, though fabled 'not' of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Faith</span>, yet allegorically represents The Mirror of all Faith, and as The original Form of the Human Soul might be intuitively enlightened with all the Revelations that were to be&#8212;might even be, in esoteric Suf&iacute;ism, The Come and Coming Twelfth Im&aacute;m who had 'read' all the previous Eleven; it being one Doctrine in the East that it is ever the 'Last' and most perfect Prophet who was 'First' Created and reserved in the Interior Heaven nearest to God till the Time of his Mission should come.</p>  
<p>Sir John Chardin quotes Seven Magnificats written in gold upon azure over Shah Abbas&#8217; Tomb in the great Mosque at K&oacute;m&#8212;composed, he says, "par le docte Hasan-Cazy," mainly in glory of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ali</span> the Darling Im&aacute;m of Persia, but of which the First Hymn "est tout de Mahomet." This has some passages so very parallel with the Sage's Address to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span>, that (knowing how little worth such parallels are, especially in a Country where Magnificent Titles of Honour are stereotyped ready to be lavished on Prophet or Khan) nevertheless really seemed borrowed by "le docte Hasan-Cazy," who probably was hard set to invent any new. They show at least how J&aacute;mi saluted his 'Alien' Prince with Titles due to Mahomet's Self, and may perhaps light any curious Reader to a better understanding of these Seven and Four. He calls Mahomet "Infaillible Expositeur des Quatre Livres"&#8212;those Gospels;&#8212;[So Sir John: but the Kur&aacute;n being one, this looks rather addrest to Ali than Mahomet.]-</p>

The Neo-Platonists held that Matter and Spirit could have no Intercourse&#8212;they were, as it were, 'incommensurate.' How then, granting this premise, was Creation possible?

God the "Actus Purus," created an &#338;on; this &#338;on created a Second; and so on, until the Tenth &#338;on was sufficiently Material (as the Ten were in a continually descending Series) to affect Matter, and so cause the Creation by giving to Matter the Spiritual 'Form.'</p>
