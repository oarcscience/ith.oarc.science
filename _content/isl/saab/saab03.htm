<p>Oh Thou whose Memory quickens Lovers&#8217; Souls,<br> Whose Fount of Joy renews the Lover's Tongue,<br> Thy Shadow falls across the World, and They<br> Bow down to it; and of the Rich in Beauty<br> Thou art the Riches that make Lovers mad.<br> Not till thy Secret Beauty through the Cheek<br> Of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Laila</span> smite does she inflame <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Majn&uacute;n</span>,<br> And not till Thou have sugar&#8217;d <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sh&iacute;r&iacute;n's</span> Lip<br> The Hearts of those Two Lovers fill with Blood.<br> For Lov&#8217;d and Lover are not but by Thee,<br> Nor Beauty;&#8212;Mortal Beauty but the Veil<br> Thy Heavenly hides behind, and from itself<br> Feeds, and our Hearts yearn after as a Bride<br> That glances past us Veil&#8217;d&#8212;but ever so<br> As none the Beauty from the Veil may know.<br> How long wilt thou continue thus the World<br> To cozen with the Fantom of a Veil</p>

<p>From which Thou only peepest?&#8212;Time it is<br> To unfold thy perfect Beauty. I would be<br> Thy Lover, and Thine only&#8212;I, mine Eyes<br> Seal&#8217;d in the Light of Thee to all but Thee,<br> Yea, in the Revelation of Thyself<br> Self-Lost, and Conscience-quit of Good and Evil.<br> Thou movest under all the Forms of Truth,<br> Under the Forms of all Created Things;<br> Look whence I will, still nothing I discern<br> But Thee in all the Universe, in which<br> Thyself Thou dost invest, and through the Eyes<br> Of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Man</span>, the subtle Censor scrutinize.<br> To thy Har&iacute;m <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dividuality</span><br> No Entrance finds&#8212;no Word of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">This</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">That</span>;<br> Do Thou my separate and Deriv&eacute;d Self<br> Make one with thy Essential! Leave me room<br> On that Div&aacute;n which leaves no Room for Two;<br> Lest, like the Simple Kurd of whom they tell,<br> I grow perplext, Oh God! &#8217;twixt "I" and "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thou</span>;"<br> If I&#8212;this Dignity and Wisdom whence?<br> If <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thou</span>&#8212;then what this abject Impotence?</p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>A Kurd perplext by Fortune's Frolics<br> Left his Desert for the City.<br> Sees a City full of Noise and<br> Clamour, agitated People,<br> Hither, Thither, Back and Forward<br> Running, some intent on Travel,<br> Others home again returning,<br> Right to Left, and Left to Right,<br> Life-disquiet everywhere!<br> Kurd, when he beholds the Turmoil,<br> Creeps aside, and, Travel-weary,<br> Fain would go to Sleep; "But," saith he,<br> "How shall I in all this Hubbub<br> "Know myself again on waking?"<br> So by way of Recognition<br> Ties a Pumpkin round his Foot,<br> And turns to Sleep. A Knave that heard him<br> Crept behind, and slily watching<br> Slips the Pumpkin off the Sleeper's<br> Ancle, ties it round his own,<br> And so down to sleep beside him.<br> By and by the Kurd awaking<br> Looks directly for his Signal&#8212;<br> Sees it on another's Ancle&#8212;<br> Cries aloud, "Oh Good-for-Nothing<br> "Rascal to perplex me so!<br> "That by you I am bewilder&#8217;d,<br> "Whether I be I or no!<br> "If I&#8212;the Pumpkin why on <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">You</span>?<br> "If <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">You</span>&#8212;then Where am I, and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Who</span>?"</small></div></p>  
<p>Oh God! this poor bewilder&#8217;d Kurd am I,<br> Than any Kurd more helpless!&#8212;Oh, do thou<br> Strike down a Ray of Light into my Darkness!<br> Turn by thy Grace these Dregs into pure Wine,<br> To recreate the Spirits of the Good!<br> Or if not that, yet, as the little Cup<br> Whose Name I go by, not unworthy found<br> To pass thy salutary Vintage round!</p>
