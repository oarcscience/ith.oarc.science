<p>Heaven's Dome is but a wondrous House of Sorrow,<br> And Happiness therein a lying Fable.<br> When first they mix&#8217;d the Clay of Man, and cloth&#8217;d<br> His Spirit in the Robe of Perfect Beauty,<br> For Forty Mornings did an Evil Cloud<br> Rain Sorrows over him from Head to Foot;<br> And when the Forty Mornings pass&#8217;d to Night,<br> Then came one Morning-Shower&#8212;one Morning-Shower<br> Of Joy&#8212;to Forty of the Rain of Sorrow!&#8212;</p>

And when came Night,<br> He hid him in some Corner of the House,<br> And communed with the Fantom of his Love.<br> "Oh Thou whose Presence so long sooth&#8217;d my Soul,<br> "Now burnt with thy Remembrance! Oh so long<br> "The Light that fed these Eyes now dark with Tears!</p>

<p>Oh Long, Long Home of Love now lost for Ever!<br> "We were Together&#8212;that was all Enough&#8212;<br> "We two rejoicing in each other's Eyes,<br> "Infinitely rejoicing&#8212;all the World<br> "Nothing to Us, nor We to all the World&#8212;<br> "No Road to reach us, nor an Eye to watch&#8212;<br> "All Day we whisper&#8217;d in each other's Ears,<br> "All Night we slept in one another's Arms&#8212;<br> "All seem&#8217;d to our Desire, as if the Hand<br> "Of unjust Fortune were for once too short.<br> "Oh would to God that when I lit the Pyre<br> "The Flame had left Thee Living and me Dead,<br> "Not Living worse than Dead, depriv&#8217;d of Thee!<br> "Oh were I but with Thee!&#8212;at any Cost<br> "Stript of this terrible Self-solitude!<br> "Oh but with Thee Annihilation&#8212;lost,<br> "Or in Eternal Intercourse renew&#8217;d!</p>

Oh my Camel!"<br> Quoth he, "Camel of my Soul!&#8212;<br> "That Lost with Her I lost might be,<br> "Or found, She might be found with Me!"</small></div></p>
