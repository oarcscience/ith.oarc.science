### XIV.

First spoke <span class="smallcaps">The Shah</span>;—"<span
class="smallcaps">Salámán</span>, Oh my Soul,  
"Oh Taper of the Banquet of my House,  
"Light of the Eyes of my Prosperity,  
"And making bloom the Court of Hope with Rose;  
"Years Rose-bud-like my own Blood I devour’d  
"Till in my hand I carried thee, my Rose;  
"Oh do not tear my Garment from my Hand,  
"Nor wound thy Father with a Dagger Thorn.  
"Years for thy sake the Crown has worn my Brow,  
"And Years my Foot been growing to the Throne

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

"Only for Thee—Oh spurn them not with Thine;  
"Oh turn thy Face from Dalliance unwise,  
"Lay not thy Heart's hand on a Minion!  
"For what thy Proper Pastime? Is it not  
"To mount and manage <span class="smallcaps">Rakhsh</span> along the
Field;  
"Not, with no stouter weapon than a Love-lock,  
"Idly reclining on a Silver Breast.  
"Go, fly thine Arrow at the Antelope  
"And Lion—let not me my Lion see  
"Slain by the Arrow eyes of a Ghazal.  
"Go, flash thy Steel among the Ranks of Men,  
"And smite the Warriors’ Necks; not, flying them,  
"Lay down thine own beneath a Woman's Foot.  
"Leave off such doing in the Name of God,  
"Nor bring thy Father weeping to the Ground;  
"Years have I held myself aloft, and all  
"For Thee—Oh Shame if thou prepare my Fall!"

<span class="small">When before <span class="smallcaps">Shirúeh's</span>
Feet  
Drencht in Blood fell <span class="smallcaps">Kai Khusrau</span>,  
He declared this Parable—  
"Wretch!—There was a Branch that, waxing  
"Wanton o’er the Root he drank from,  
"At a Draught the Living Water  
"Drain’d wherewith Himself to crown;  
"Died the Root—and with it died  
"The Branch—and barren was brought down!"</span>
