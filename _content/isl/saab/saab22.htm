<p>When by and bye <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Shah</span> was made aware<br> Of that Soul-wasting absence of his Son,<br> He reach&#8217;d a Cry to Heav&#8217;n&#8212;his Eyelashes</p>  
<p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></A></p>  
<p>Wept Blood&#8212;Search everywhere he set a-foot,<br> But none could tell the hidden Mystery.<br> Then bade he bring a Mirror that he had,<br> A Mirror, like the Bosom of the Wise,<br> Reflecting all the World, and lifting up<br> The Veil from all its Secret, Good and Evil.<br> That Mirror bade he bring, and, in its Face<br> Looking, beheld the Face of his Desire.<br> He saw those Lovers in the Solitude,<br> Turn&#8217;d from the World, and all its ways, and People,<br> And looking only in each other's Eyes,<br> And never finding any Sorrow there.<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Shah</span> beheld them as they were, and Pity<br> Fell on his Eyes, and he reproach&#8217;d them not;<br> And, gathering all their Life into his hand,<br> Not a Thread lost, disposed in Order all.<br> Oh for the Noble Nature, and Clear Heart,<br> That, seeing Two who draw one Breath, together<br> Drinking the Cup of Happiness and Tears<br> Unshatter&#8217;d by the Stone of Separation,<br> Is loath their sweet Communion to destroy,<br> Or cast a Tangle in the Skein of Joy.</p>  
<p>The Arrows that assail the Lords of Sorrow<br> Come from the Hand of Retribution.<br> Do Well, that in thy Turn Well may betide Thee;</p>  
<p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></A></p>  
<p>And turn from Ill, that Ill may turn beside Thee.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Firh&aacute;d</span>, Moulder of the Mountain,<br> Love-distracted look&#8217;d to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sh&iacute;r&iacute;n</span>,<br> And <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sh&iacute;r&iacute;n</span> the Sculptor's Passion<br> Saw, and turn&#8217;d her Heart to Him.</p>  
<p>Then the Fire of Jealous Frenzy<br> Caught and carried up the Harvest<br> Of the Might of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kai Khusrau</span>.</p>  
<p>Plotting with that ancient Hag<br> Of Fate, the Sculptor's Cup he poison&#8217;d,<br> And remained the Lord of Love.</p>  
<p>So&#8212;But Fate that Fate avenges<br> Arms <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Shir&uacute;eh</span> with the Dagger,<br> That at once from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sh&iacute;r&iacute;n</span> tore him,<br> Hurl&#8217;d him from the Throne of Glory.</small></div></p>
