<p>The Incomparable Creator, when this World<br> He did create, created First of All<br> The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">First Intelligence</span>&#8212;First of a Chain<br> Of Ten Intelligences, of which the Last<br> Sole Agent is in this our Universe,<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Active Intelligence</span> so call&#8217;d; The One<br> Distributor of Evil and of Good,<br> Of Joy and Sorrow, Himself apart from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Matter</span>,<br> In Essence and in Energy&#8212;his Treasure<br> Subject to no such Talisman&#8212;He yet<br> Hath fashion&#8217;d all that is&#8212;Material Form,<br> And Spiritual, sprung from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Him</span>&#8212;by <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Him</span><br> Directed all, and in his Bounty drown&#8217;d.<br> Therefore is He that Firm&aacute;n-issuing <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Shah</span><br> To whom the World was subject. But because<br> What He distributes to the Universe<br> Himself from still a Higher Power receives,<br> The Wise, and all who comprehend aright,<br> Will recognise that Higher in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Sage</span>.</p>  
<p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></A></p>  
<p>His the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prime Spirit</span> that, spontaneously<br> Projected by the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tenth Intelligence</span>,<br> Was from no Womb of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Matter</span> reproduced<br> A Special Essence called <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Soul</span>&#8212;a <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Child</span><br> Fresh sprung from Heaven in Raiment undefiled<br> Of Sensual Taint, and therefore call&#8217;d <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span>.</p>  
<p>And who <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abs&aacute;l</span>&#8212;The Lust-adoring Body,<br> Slave to the Blood and Sense&#8212;through whom <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Soul</span>,<br> Although the Body's very Life it be,<br> Does yet imbibe the Knowledge and Desire<br> Of Things of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sense</span>; and these united thus<br> By such a Tie <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God</span> only can unloose,<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Body</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Soul</span> are Lovers Each of other.</p>  
<p>What is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Sea</span> on which they sail&#8217;d?&#8212;The Sea<br> Of Animal Desire&#8212;the Sensual Abyss,<br> Under whose Waters lie a World of Being<br> Swept far from God in that Submersion.</p>  
<p>And wherefore was it Aiwa in that Isle<br> Deceived in her Delight, and that <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span><br> Fell short of his Desire?&#8212;That was to show<br> How <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Passion</span> tires, and how with Time begins<br> The Folding of the Carpet of Desire</p>  
<p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></A></p>  
<p>And what the turning of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n's</span> Heart<br> Back to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Shah</span>, and looking to the Throne<br> Of Pomp and Glory? What but the Return<br> Of the Lost <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Soul</span> to its true Parentage,<br> And back from Carnal Error looking up<br> Repentant to its Intellectual Throne.</p>  
<p>What is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Fire</span>?&#8212;Ascetic Discipline,<br> That burns away the Animal Alloy,<br> Till all the Dross of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Matter</span> be consumed,<br> And the Essential Soul, its raiment clean<br> Of Mortal Taint, be left. But forasmuch<br> As any Life-long Habit so consumed,<br> May well recur a Pang for what is lost,<br> Therefore <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Sage</span> set in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n's</span> Eyes<br> A Soothing Fantom of the Past, but still<br> Told of a Better Venus, till his Soul<br> She fill&#8217;d, and blotted out his Mortal Love.<br> For what is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zuhrah</span>?&#8212;That Divine Perfection,<br> Wherwith the Soul inspir&#8217;d and all array&#8217;d<br> In Intellectual Light is Royal blest,<br> And mounts <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Throne</span>, and wears<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crown</span>, and Reigns<br> Lord of the Empire of Humanity.</p>  
<p>This is the Meaning of This Mystery<br> Which to know wholly ponder in thy Heart,<br> Till all its ancient Secret be enlarged.<br> Enough&#8212;The written Summary I close,<br> And set my Seal:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Truth God only Knows</span>.</p>
