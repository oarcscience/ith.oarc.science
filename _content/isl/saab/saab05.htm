<p>When Night had thus far brought me with my Book,<br> In middle Thought Sleep robb&#8217;d me of myself;<br> And in a Dream Myself I seem&#8217;d to see,<br> Walking along a straight and even Road,<br> And clean as is the Soul of the Sufi;<br> A Road whose spotless Surface neither Breeze<br> Lifted in Dust, nor mix&#8217;d the Rain to Mire.<br> There I, methought, was pacing tranquilly,<br> When, on a sudden, the tumultuous Shout<br> Of Soldiery behind broke on mine Ear,<br> And took away my Wit and Strength for Fear.<br> I look&#8217;d about for Refuge, and Behold!<br> A Palace was before me; whither running<br> For Refuge from the coming Soldiery,</p>

<p>Suddenly from the Troop a Sh&aacute;hzem&aacute;n,<br> By Name and Nature <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hasan</span>&#8212;on the Horse<br> Of Honour mounted&#8212;robed in Royal Robes,<br> And wearing a White Turban on his Head,<br> Turn&#8217;d his Rein tow&#8217;rd me, and with smiling Lips<br> Open&#8217;d before my Eyes the Door of Peace.<br> Then, riding up to me, dismounted; kiss&#8217;d<br> My Hand, and did me Courtesy; and I,<br> How glad of his Protection, and the Grace<br> He gave it with!&#8212;Who then of gracious Speech<br> Many a Jewel utter&#8217;d; but of these<br> Not one that in my Ear till Morning hung.<br> When, waking on my Bed, my waking Wit<br> I question&#8217;d what the Vision meant, it answered;<br> "This Courtesy and Favour of the Shah<br> Foreshadows the fair Acceptance of thy Verse,<br> Which lose no moment pushing to Conclusion."<br> This hearing, I address&#8217;d me like a Pen<br> To steady Writing; for perchance, I thought,<br> From the same Fountain whence the Vision grew<br> The Interpretation also may come True.</p>
