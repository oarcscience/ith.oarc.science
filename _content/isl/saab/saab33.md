### APPENDIX.

<span class="small">*What follows concerning the Royal Game of* <span
class="smallcaps">Chúgán</span> *comes from the Appendix to Vol. 1. of
Sir William Ouseley's Travels in the East*.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Firdúsi</span> tells of <span
class="smallcaps">Siavesh</span> and his Iranian (Persian) Heroes
astonishing <span class="smallcaps">Afrasiáb</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Turán</span> with their Skill at this Game 600 years
before Christ; and <span class="smallcaps">Gushtasp</span> (Hystaspes),
to the sound of Drum and Trumpet, drives the Ball Invisible with his
Blow. <span class="smallcaps">Nizámi</span> sets <span
class="smallcaps">Shírín</span> and her Maidens playing at it, against
her King, <span class="smallcaps">Khusrau Parvíz</span>, and his
Ministers;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"On one side was the Moon and her Stars,  
"On the other <span class="smallcaps">The Shah</span> and his
Firmán-bearers."

</div>

Ouseley however (allowing for Poetic License) believes the Game was
played "through almost every Reign of the Sassanian Dynasty—as much
esteemed by the Mahommedan Kings as by their Fire-worshipping
Predecessors."

"We find the Greek Emperor, Manuel Commenus, with his Byzantine Princes
and Nobles, enjoying this Amusement on Horse-back in the 12th Century;
the Wooden Ball having been exchanged for one more soft, form’d of stuff
'd Leather; and the Stick, or Wand, instead of a Hammer-like Head,
terminating in a Hoop; which, as our Battledores or Tennis-rackets,
presented to the Ball a reticulated space. This Imperial Sport is well
described by the Historian Cinnamus, who

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

probably was a Spectator." It went by the slightly altered name <span
class="smallcaps">Tsukanisterion</span>—which word, however, since <span
class="smallcaps">Chúgán</span> means the Bandy-stick employed, more
properly signifies, I suppose, the Ground played on; and equally related
to the Persian, had they chosen to affix, as so often, the Verb common
to themselves, the Greeks, the Latins, and us, and called the place of
Exercise <span class="smallcaps">Chúgán</span>*istán*; or <span
class="smallcaps">Chúgán</span>-*stand*.

Piétro della Valle, who saw it played in <span class="smallcaps">Shah
Abbas’</span> time (1618), calls it "Pallamaglio," and found both Game
and Name subsisting in the Florentine "<span
class="smallcaps">Calcio</span>"—only that the Florentine played a-foot,
and the Persian "piu nobilmente a Cavallo." The Spanish Jesuit Ovalle
found it also (also on Foot) under the name of "<span
class="smallcaps">Chueca</span>," in South America, in 1646.

Ducange finds Name and Game also in the "<span
class="smallcaps">Chicane</span>"of Languedoc, from which he naturally
thinks it borrowed; not daring to push Derivation to the English word
"Chiquen," he says, "qui signifie un Poullet; en sorte que ‘*Chiquaner*’
seroit imiter les Poullets qui ont coutûme de courir les uns apres les
autres pour arracher les morceaux du Bec," etc.

Englishmen know the Game well (on Foot too, and with such Leather Balls
as the Persians perhaps knew not how to harden), under many Forms and
Names—Golf, Stow-Ball, Shinty, Hocky, Bandy, etc.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

And now with regard to the Frontispiece. It is "accurately copied" from
an Engraving in Sir William's Book, which he says (and as those who care
to look into the Bodleian for it may see), is " accurately copied from a
very beautiful Persian MS., containing the Works of Hafíz, transcribed
in the Year 956 of the Hejirah, 1549 of Christ; the MS. is in my own
Collection. This Delineation exhibits the Horsemen contending for the
Ball; their short Jackets seem peculiarly adapted to the Sport; we see
the <span class="smallcaps">Míl</span>, or Goals; Servants attend on
Foot Holding <span class="smallcaps">Chúgáns</span> in readiness for
other Persons who may join in the Amusement, or to supply the place of
any that may be broken. A young Prince—as his <span
class="smallcaps">Parr</span>, or Feather, would indicate—receives on
his Entrance into the <span class="smallcaps">Meidan</span>, or Place of
Exercise, a <span class="smallcaps">Chúgán</span> from the hands of a
bearded Man very plainly dressed; yet (as an intelligent Painter at
Ispahan assured me, and as appears from other Miniatures in the same
Book) this Bearded Figure is meant to represent Hafíz himself," etc.

The Persian legend at the Top Corner is the Verse from Hafíz which the
Drawing illustrates;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Shahsuvára Khúsh bemeidán ámedy gúiy bezann.

</div>

Though the Sticks, or Bats, are here represented *long*, they really
were (as Chardin and others report) so short as to

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

cause the Rider to stoop below the Saddlebow to strike; which, the Horse
going full gallop, was great part of the Difficulty. And Tabri describes
Events in the Eighth Century (just before his own Time), when Harun
Alraschid was still little, so that when on Horseback, "he could not
reach to strike the Ball with a Chúgán." Ouseley also, judging from the
Illustration (in which Persian Artists are not very accurate), thinks
the Chúgán sticks were only *generally*, or partially. semicircular at
the striking End. But that they were so (varying perhaps a little in
degree as our Bandy sticks do) is proved by the Text of the Present
Poem, as also by a previous line in the Original, where—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The Realm of Existence is the space of his Meidan,  
"The Ball of Heaven in the Crook of his <span
class="smallcaps">Chúgán</span>."

</div>

And passages in Hafíz speak of his Heart as being carried off by his
Beloved's Eyebrow; which no Persian Lover ever dreamt of but as arched
indeed.

 

As the "<span class="smallcaps">Fair One</span>" of Persian Mysticism is
the Deity's Self—so the Points of that Beauty (as in our Canticles)
adumbrate so many of the Deity's Attributes; varying however with
various Poets, or their Commentators. Sir W. Jones speaks of <span
class="smallcaps">The Hair</span> as emblematic of "The Expansion of
Divine Glory"—<span class="smallcaps">The Lips</span> as of "Hidden
Mysteries"—The Down of the Cheek as "Spirits round the

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Throne," whose
central point of excessive Light is darken’d into the Mole upon the
Cheek!—Tholuck, from a Turkish Commentary, interprets the Ringlets as
"The Divine Mysteries;" the Forehead their Manifestation, etc.

 

The Beauty of <span class="smallcaps">Absál</span>, though Sensual, yet
seduces <span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> (<span
class="smallcaps">The Soul</span>) with its Likeness to the Divine; and
her Tresses, as we see, play their part, involving him in their
Intricacies. The following Ode of Jámi's on the subject very happily
entangles the Ear with its repetitions of that mysterious <span
class="smallcaps">Zulf</span> which closes the first two, and every
alternate Line, to the End. "Le Texte de cette Ode," says De Saçy, "est
d’une Charme inexprimable que l’on chercheroit inutilement dans une
Traduction." The Persian therefore is here vocalized as nearly as
possible in English Notes, to give the Reader a Notion of the harmony
which is its chief Merit. But I subjoin for the Lover of literal
Translation a very literal one, which he can if he chooses place word
for word under the Persian, and, if he will accept a very little help at
starting, may construe into what form he pleases: supplying for himself
a Verb and a Point where the Reader of the original has to do so.

 

The apostrophized *’i* (here written, but in Persian only pronounced)
either denotes that the following Noun, Pronoun, or Adjective belongs to
it as Genitive or

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Epithet—as in the
first line "*dil’i man*" ="heart of I (Me);" or acts merely as a
*passing Note* of harmony (with a People who hate all harshness but in
Deed) between any two Consonants and a third, or between any consonanted
long Vowel and a succeeding Consonant, unless that long Vowel's
Consonant be *n*. "Tamám ’i zulf" in line 3 is an instance of the *’i*
in its latter use. In both cases it is common in quantity.

The ra in the 5th and last lines mark the Dative.
