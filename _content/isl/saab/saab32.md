### XXX.

The Incomparable Creator, when this World  
He did create, created First of All  
The <span class="smallcaps">First Intelligence</span>—First of a Chain  
Of Ten Intelligences, of which the Last  
Sole Agent is in this our Universe,  
<span class="smallcaps">Active Intelligence</span> so call’d; The One  
Distributor of Evil and of Good,  
Of Joy and Sorrow, Himself apart from <span
class="smallcaps">Matter</span>,  
In Essence and in Energy—his Treasure  
Subject to no such Talisman—He yet  
Hath fashion’d all that is—Material Form,  
And Spiritual, sprung from <span class="smallcaps">Him</span>—by <span
class="smallcaps">Him</span>  
Directed all, and in his Bounty drown’d.  
Therefore is He that Firmán-issuing <span
class="smallcaps">Shah</span>  
To whom the World was subject. But because  
What He distributes to the Universe  
Himself from still a Higher Power receives,  
The Wise, and all who comprehend aright,  
Will recognise that Higher in <span class="smallcaps">The Sage</span>.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

His the <span class="smallcaps">Prime Spirit</span> that,
spontaneously  
Projected by the <span class="smallcaps">Tenth Intelligence</span>,  
Was from no Womb of <span class="smallcaps">Matter</span> reproduced  
A Special Essence called <span class="smallcaps">The Soul</span>—a <span
class="smallcaps">Child</span>  
Fresh sprung from Heaven in Raiment undefiled  
Of Sensual Taint, and therefore call’d <span
class="smallcaps">Salámán</span>.

And who <span class="smallcaps">Absál</span>—The Lust-adoring Body,  
Slave to the Blood and Sense—through whom <span class="smallcaps">The
Soul</span>,  
Although the Body's very Life it be,  
Does yet imbibe the Knowledge and Desire  
Of Things of <span class="smallcaps">Sense</span>; and these united
thus  
By such a Tie <span class="smallcaps">God</span> only can unloose,  
<span class="smallcaps">Body</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Soul</span> are Lovers Each of other.

What is <span class="smallcaps">The Sea</span> on which they sail’d?—The
Sea  
Of Animal Desire—the Sensual Abyss,  
Under whose Waters lie a World of Being  
Swept far from God in that Submersion.

And wherefore was it Aiwa in that Isle  
Deceived in her Delight, and that <span
class="smallcaps">Salámán</span>  
Fell short of his Desire?—That was to show  
How <span class="smallcaps">Passion</span> tires, and how with Time
begins  
The Folding of the Carpet of Desire

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

And what the turning of <span class="smallcaps">Salámán's</span> Heart  
Back to <span class="smallcaps">The Shah</span>, and looking to the
Throne  
Of Pomp and Glory? What but the Return  
Of the Lost <span class="smallcaps">Soul</span> to its true Parentage,  
And back from Carnal Error looking up  
Repentant to its Intellectual Throne.

What is <span class="smallcaps">The Fire</span>?—Ascetic Discipline,  
That burns away the Animal Alloy,  
Till all the Dross of <span class="smallcaps">Matter</span> be
consumed,  
And the Essential Soul, its raiment clean  
Of Mortal Taint, be left. But forasmuch  
As any Life-long Habit so consumed,  
May well recur a Pang for what is lost,  
Therefore <span class="smallcaps">The Sage</span> set in <span
class="smallcaps">Salámán's</span> Eyes  
A Soothing Fantom of the Past, but still  
Told of a Better Venus, till his Soul  
She fill’d, and blotted out his Mortal Love.  
For what is <span class="smallcaps">Zuhrah</span>?—That Divine
Perfection,  
Wherwith the Soul inspir’d and all array’d  
In Intellectual Light is Royal blest,  
And mounts <span class="smallcaps">The Throne</span>, and wears  
<span class="smallcaps">The Crown</span>, and Reigns  
Lord of the Empire of Humanity.

This is the Meaning of This Mystery  
Which to know wholly ponder in thy Heart,  
Till all its ancient Secret be enlarged.  
Enough—The written Summary I close,  
And set my Seal:

     <span class="smallcaps">The Truth God only Knows</span>.
