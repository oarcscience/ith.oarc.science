### XXIX.

### EPILOGUE.

Under the Outward Form of any Story  
An Inner Meaning lies—This Story now  
Completed, do Thou of its Mystery  
(Whereto the Wise hath found himself a way)  
Have thy Desire—No Tale of *I* and <span
class="smallcaps">Thou</span>,  
Though *I* and <span class="smallcaps">Thou</span> be its
Interpreters.  
What signifies <span class="smallcaps">The Shah</span>? and what <span
class="smallcaps">The Sage</span>?  
And what <span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> not of Woman born?  
And what <span class="smallcaps">Absál</span> who drew him to Desire?  
And what the <span class="smallcaps">Kingdom</span> that awaited him  
When he had drawn his Garment from her Hand?  
What means that <span class="smallcaps">Fiery Pile</span>? and what
<span class="smallcaps">The Sea</span>?

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

And what that Heavenly <span class="smallcaps">Zuhrah</span> who at
last  
Clear’d <span class="smallcaps">Absál</span> from the Mirror of his
Soul?  
Learn part by part the Mystery from me;  
All Ear from Head to Foot and Understanding be.
