### XXV.

When in this Plight <span class="smallcaps">The Shah</span> <span
class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> saw,  
His Soul was struck with Anguish, and the Vein  
Of Life within was strangled—what to do  
He knew not. Then he turn’d him to <span class="smallcaps">The
Sage</span>—  
"Oh Altar of the World, to whom Mankind  
"Directs the Face of Prayer in Weal or Woe,  
"Nothing but Wisdom can untie the Knot;  
"And art not Thou the Wisdom of the World,  
"The Master-Key of all its Difficulties?  
"<span class="smallcaps">Absál</span> is perisht; and, because of Her,  
"<span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> dedicates his Life to Sorrow;  
"I cannot bring back Her, nor comfort Him.  
"Lo, I have said! My Sorrow is before Thee;  
"From thy far-reaching Wisdom help Thou Me  
"Fast in the Hand of Sorrow! Help Thou Me,  
"For I am very wretched!" Then <span class="smallcaps">The
Sage</span>—  
"Oh Thou that err’st not from the Road of Right,  
"If but <span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> have not broke my Bond,  
"Nor lies beyond the Noose of my Firmán,  
"He quickly shall unload his Heart to me,  
"And I will find a Remedy for all."
