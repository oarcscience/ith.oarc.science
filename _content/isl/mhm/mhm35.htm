<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: I was suspected on account of some property I had gotten and so I fled, I knew not whither, until I came to a desert, and my wandering led me to the shade of a tent. I found near the pegs thereof a youth playing in the sand with those of his own age, and reciting a</p>

<p><A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A></p>  
<p>poem which was in keeping with his condition but did not accord with his powers of improvisation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_661"></A><A HREF="#fn_661"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>And I felt it to be far from him to be able to weave its fabric, so I said: 'Young Arab, dost thou recite or compose this poem?' He said: 'Nay, but I compose it.' Then he recited saying:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'And verily though I be young&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_662"></A><A HREF="#fn_662"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> And the eye disdain me,<br> My demon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_663"></A><A HREF="#fn_663"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is the chief of the <i>Jinn</i><br> And he takes me through all the range of the poetic art,<br> Until he drives away what occurs of doubt.<br> Therefore go at thine ease and depart from me.'</DIR></p>  
<p>I said: 'O young Arab, terror has brought me to thee. Is there, therefore, safety or hospitality with thee?' He replied: 'Thou hast descended in the very house of safety and alighted on the land of hospitality.' He said: 'Then he arose and seized me by the sleeve and I went with him to a tent whose curtains were lowered.' Then he shouted: 'O damsel of the tribe, here is a neighbour whose country has rejected him, and whose ruler has oppressed him. Fame, which he has heard, or a report, which has reached him, has driven him to us, so give him shelter.' The damsel said: 'Stay, O townsman.'</p>  
<p><DIR>'O townsman, stay and fear no ill,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_664"></A><A HREF="#fn_664"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><br> For thou art in the house of al-Aswad ibn Qin&aacute;n&iacute;<br> The mightiest son of woman from Maa&#8216;d and Ya&#8216;rub,<br> And the most promise-keeping of them in every place.<br> The best striker with the sword among them in defence of his neighbour,<br> And the greatest smiter with the spear in protecting him.<br> It is as though death and bounty were in his hand</DIR></p>

<p>Then the young man took me by the hand to the house which she had indicated. I beheld and lo! there were seven persons in it.
