<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: I was at Isfahan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_322"></A><A HREF="#fn_322"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>

<p>intending to go to Rayy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and so I alighted in the city as alights the fleeting shade. I was expecting to see the caravan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> at every glance and looking out for the mount to appear at every sunrise. Now, when that which I expected, was about to happen, I heard the call to prayer and to respond to it was obligatory. So I slipped away from my companions, taking advantage of the opportunity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of joining in public prayers, and dreading, at the same time, the loss of the caravan I was leaving. But I sought aid against the difficulty of the desert through the blessing of prayer, and, therefore, I went to the front row and stood up. The Imam went up to the niche and recited the opening chapter of the Qur&#8217;&aacute;n according to the intonation of &#7716;amza,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in regard to using 'madda' and '&#7717;amza,' while I experienced disquieting grief&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> at the thought of missing the caravan, and of separation from the mount. Then he followed up the S&uacute;ratal-F&aacute;ti&#7717;a with S&uacute;rat al-W&aacute;qi&#8216;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_328"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> while I suffered the fire of patience and tasked myself severely. I was roasting and grilling on the live coal</p>

<p>of rage. But, from what I knew of the savage fanaticism of the people&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of that place, if&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> prayers were cut short of the final salutation, there was no alternative but silence and endurance, or speech and the grave. So I remained standing thus on the foot of necessity till the end of the chapter. I had now despaired of the caravan and given up all hope of the supplies and the mount. He next bent his back&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> for the two prostrations with such humility and emotion, the like of which I had never seen before. Then he raised his hands and his head and said: 'May God accept the praise of him who praises Him,' and remained standing till I doubted not but that he had fallen asleep. Then he placed his right hand on the ground, put his forehead on the earth and pressed his face thereto. I raised my head to look for an opportunity to slip away, but I perceived no opening in the rows, so I re-addressed myself to prayer until he repeated the Takb&iacute;r&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> for the sitting posture. Then he stood up for the second prostration and recited the S&uacute;ras of al-Fat&iacute;&#7717;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and al-Q&aacute;ri&#8216;a with an intonation which occupied the duration of the Last Day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and well-nigh exhausted the spirits of the congregation. Now, when he had finished his two prostrations and proceeded to wag his jaws&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> to pronounce the testimony to God's unity, and to turn his face to the right and to the left&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> for the final salutation, I said: 'Now God has made escape easy, and deliverance is nigh'; but a man stood up and said: 'Whosoever of you loves the Companions and the Muslim community let him lend me his ears for a moment.' Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: I clave to my place in order to save my dignity. Then he said: 'It is incumbent upon</p>

<p>me that I should speak nothing but verity and testify to nought but the truth. I have brought you good tidings from your Prophet, but I will not communicate it until God hath purged this musjid of every vile person who denies his prophetic office.' Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: Now he had bound me with cords and fettered me with bands of iron.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_337"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Then he said: 'I saw the Prophet in a dream!--May God send His blessings upon him--like the sun beneath the clouds, and the moon at the full. He was walking, the stars following him; he was trailing his skirts and the angels held them up. Then he taught me a prayer and admonished me to teach it to his people. So I wrote it down on these slips of paper&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with the perfumes of Khal&uacute;q,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> musk, saffron and socc,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and whoever asks for a copy as a gift, I will present it to him, but whosoever hands me back the cost of the paper I will accept it.' Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: Dirhems poured upon him to such an extent that he was bewildered. Then he went out and I followed him wondering at the cleverness of his imposture&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and his artifice to gain his living. And I determined to question him concerning his condition, but I restrained myself, and to converse with him, but I remained silent, and I pondered over his eloquence with his shamelessness, his pleasantness with his mendicity, his catching men by his artifice and his drawing gold from men by his ingenuity. Then I looked and lo! it was Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717; al-Iskander&iacute;. So I asked: 'What set thee on this stratagem?' He smiled and recited, saying:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'Men are asses,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> so lead them one after the other,<br> Compete with, and excel them,<br> Till thou hast obtained from them<br> What thou desirest, then quit.'</DIR></p>

Conquered in the Khal&iacute;fate of &#8216;Umar. During the Arab ascendancy, and under the Selj&uacute;ks, it was a place of considerable importance. Ibn F&aacute;ris, the poet and grammarian and instructor of al-Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute;, was born here. The derivative adjective from Rayy is R&aacute;z&iacute;.</P>

For the rules as to its use, in intoning the Qur&#8217;&aacute;n, see Suy&uacute;&#7789;&iacute;, <i>Itq&aacute;n</i>, pp. 227-31. (Calcutta, edition, 1852). &#7716;amza ibn al-Hab&iacute;b (80-156 A.H.) buried at H&uacute;lw&aacute;n, was one of the seven recognized readers of the Qur&#8217;&aacute;n. He is charged with exaggerating the use of <i>madda</i> and <i>hamza</i>. The objection is repudiated, however, by &#7716;amza's admirers, see <i>Manduat al-&#8216;Ulum&iacute;n Turkish</i>, i, 483 (Constantinople edition, A H. 1313). Al-Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute; evidently believed the charge to be well grounded and hence the appropriateness of the allusion.</P>
