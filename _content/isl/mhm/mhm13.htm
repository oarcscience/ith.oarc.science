<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: When I was in my young days, I rode my mount into every species of blind folly and urged my courser into every kind of error until I had drunk of life a delicious draft and had donned the flowing robes of fortune. But when the day brightened&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> my night and I gathered up my skirts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and prepared for the final judgement, I mounted a tame steed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> in order to discharge a bounden duty.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> There accompanied me on the road a friend in whom I saw nothing wrong to make me repudiate him. Now, when we had exchanged confessions and confidences, the story revealed that he was a K&uacute;fan by principle and a &#7778;&uacute;f&iacute; by persuasion,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> and so we travelled on.</p>  
<p>Now, when we alighted at K&uacute;fa,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> we went to his house and</p>

He answered: 'The envoy of night and its messenger, the defeated and hunted of hunger, a well-bred personage in the leash of misfortune and bad times; a guest, whose tread is light&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and whose stray&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is a loaf; a neighbour who asks aid against hunger and a patched smock; an exile after whose departure the fire of banishment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> was kindled, in whose wake the howling dogs have barked, after whom pebbles were cast and the areas swept.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> His jaded camel is fatigue; his pleasure is affliction, and between him and his two chicks is a vast desert.'

He replied, 'No fire so hot to cause aloeswood to diffuse its fragrance as that of generosity, and the envoy of benevolence is met by no one better than the messenger of gratitude. Therefore, whoever possesses plenty, let him do good, for generosity will not pass unrewarded&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> by God and man.
