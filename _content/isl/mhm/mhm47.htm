He answered, 'To the Ka&#8216;ba.' So I said: 'Excellent! Excellent! is its feast, though still unprepared! We are, in that case, fellow-travellers.' He said: 'How is that, when I am going up and thou art going down?' I asked: 'How canst thou go <i>up</i> to the Ka&#8216;ba?'

<P><A NAME="fn_901"></A><A HREF="mhm47.htm#fr_901">150:2</A> Nishapur (<i>Naisabur</i>): A well-known town, the capital of the province of the same name, situated forty-nine miles west of Meshed. It was captured by the Arabs in A.H. 31. Yaq&uacute;t in his <i>Geographical Dictionary</i>, iv, 757, referring to this place says of all the cities he had visited Naisabur (Nishapur) was the finest. It was in this city, says Tha&#8216;alibi (<i>Yatima</i>, iv, 168) that Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute; wrote his four hundred maq&aacute;m&aacute;t and vanquished his great literary rival the renowned Ab&uacute; Bakr al-Khw&aacute;razm&iacute;.</P>

The primary meaning is loudness of voice and then vehement eloquence. Shiqshiqa is also the name of a sermon preached by &#8216;Al&iacute; and interrupted by a member of the congregation, a man from &#8216;Ir&aacute;q, handing him a letter. When desired by Ibn &#8216;Abb&aacute;s to continue his address, &#8216;Al&iacute; answered: 'Alas! Ibn &#8216;Abb&aacute;s, the Shiqshiqa has roared and subsided', meaning that the inspiration of the moment had gone. [<i>Nahaj</i><i> al-Bal&aacute;gha</i>, p. 26 (Beyrut ed. A.H. 1308)]. The saying became proverbial. See Freytag, <i>Arab Proverbs</i>, i, 673.</P>

These expressions regarding the two Ka&#8216;bas will be found in No. 38, page 101, of Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute;'s Letters. They are cited by Tha&#8216;&aacute;lib&iacute; (<i>Yat&iacute;ma</i> iv, 176) as a specimen of Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute;'s elegant epistolary style. They are also quoted by Ibn Khallikan, 113. Their chief merit consists of a mere play on words impossible to preserve in a rendering into English. For similar and additional criticisms of the Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; and a description of what a Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; should be, see the Author's Letters, pp. 168-9.</P>
