### XL. THE MAQAMA OF KNOWLEDGE

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was crossing one of those
parts where exile had thrown me, when behold I met a man who was asking
another, 'By what means hast thou acquired knowledge?' And the latter,
answering him, said: 'I sought it and found it to be difficult of
access. <span id="fr_916"></span>[2](#fn_916) It is not shot with a
shaft, nor allotted by the divining arrows. <span
id="fr_917"></span>[3](#fn_917) It is not seen in the dream nor
controlled with the bridle. <span id="fr_918"></span>[4](#fn_918) It is
neither inherited from paternal uncles, nor borrowed from the generous.
Therefore I adopted, as a means of attainment thereto, the making of
clods a bed, the taking of a stone for a pillow, repelling weariness,
braving danger, prolonging vigils, making a companion of travel, much
reading and meditation. And I found it to be a thing suitable only for
planting, and it is not planted save in the mind. A quarry that is
ensnared but rarely and is not caught, save in the breast. A bird that
is deluded only by the snaring of the word, and nought catches it but
the net of memory. Therefore I laid it upon my soul and confined it
within my eye. I spent

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

my means, but stored my mind. I wrote elegantly by virtue of much
reading, and passed on from reading to investigation, and from
investigation to composition, and I relied therein on divine guidance.'

Now I heard language such as penetrated the ear, reached the heart, and
quickly entered the breast, so I asked: 'O young man! Whence the orient
of this sun?' Then he began to say:--

'Alexandria is my home, <span id="fr_919"></span>[1](#fn_919) if but in
it my resting-place were fixed.  
But my night I pass in Syria, in ‘Iráq my day.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_916"></span>[152:2](mhm48.htm#fr_916) … *Difficult of
access:* This and the succeeding five sentences will be found in No. 41,
p. 165 of the Letters where almost the entire maqáma is reproduced
verbatim.

<span id="fn_917"></span>[152:3](mhm48.htm#fr_917) … *By the divining
arrows:* By means of which the Arabs in the time of the Ignorance.
(Barbarism), sought to know what was allotted to them. This practice is
forbidden in Qur’án, v, 4.

<span id="fn_918"></span>[152:4](mhm48.htm#fr_918) … *With a bridle:*
Literally, with a bit, i.e. the appurtenances of a bridle, by an
extension of meaning, applied to this with its straps; arabicized from
the Persian … *Lagám*.

<span id="fn_919"></span>[153:1](mhm48.htm#fr_919) *Alexandria is my
home:* Metre, *mujtath*.

Cf. the fifteenth maqáma, p. 74. A very interesting disquisition on
knowledge and the course to be followed in the acquisition thereof. We
have doubtless in this maqáma a statement of the author's own methods of
study. An amplification of the idea will be found on pp. 165-8 of the
Letters. For a synopsis of both, see end of the Cambridge MS, 1066
(Badí‘ al- Zamán).
