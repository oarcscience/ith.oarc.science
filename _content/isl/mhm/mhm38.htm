In the time of al-Man&#7779;&uacute;r (A.D. 754-75) it was the cantonment of the city. It was built by the Khal&iacute;fa's son al-Mahd&iacute;, in A.H. 159, and in time grew to the size of the capital itself. It was also the necropolis of the &#8216;Abb&aacute;sid Khal&iacute;fas. (Yaq&uacute;t, ii, 783. See also Le Strange, <i>Baghdad</i>.)</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_727"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_727">122:7</A> <i>Which had appropriated to itself the secret of all beauty:</i> The cathedral masjid of Ru&#7779;&aacute;fa was larger and more magnificent than that of Baghdad itself.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_728"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_728">123:1</A> <i>Finally the discussion led them:</i> <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> 'the end of the discussion led them' <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> means the hinder part of anything, particularly the buttock or rump. In poetry it signifies the second half of a verse or couplet, the first half being called &#7779;adr (<FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT>)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_729"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_729">123:2</A> <i>Him who throttles by the sudden attack:</i> From <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> he went lightly or stealthily, and <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> he despatched him. (Lane's Lexicon, article p. 887.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_730"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_730">123:3</A> <i>Him who substitutes by cajoling:</i> For this use of the word <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> than that adopted by the commentator, see Letters of the author, p 329, line 8.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_731"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_731">123:4</A> <i>Him who invites to compromise:</i> In a case where he has no legal claim.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_732"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_732">123:5</A> <i>Who sweeps off the change:</i> The explanation of this trick is as follows: the thief goes to a money changer on the pretext of changing a dinar then snatches what the man has before him and decamps.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_733"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_733">123:6</A> <i>Him who induces sleep:</i> The thief being in company with some one who has money pretends to be drowsy and thus induces his victim to go to sleep, he then robs him of his property. But, literally, 'him who puts to sleep with the eye.' More probably, therefore, hypnotic suggestion.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_734"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_734">123:7</A> <i>Him who confounds with backgammon:</i> The thief takes with him into the house he intends to rob a backgammon or chess-board, usually made of cloth, and spreads it out. In case he is discovered by the master of the house he raises a cry that he has been cheated at the game and his opponent refuses to pay his losses.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_735"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_735">123:8</A> <i>By means of the mantle:</i> The thief observes a man wearing a mantle, goes quickly behind him, raises the skirt of the garment, in order to get at the purse usually carried underneath, and begins sewing it to the collar. If he is discovered, and the man turns round, he says, 'Do not be afraid, I was only mending thy cloak; dost thou not want it done?' In this way he manages to escape with or without the purse.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_736"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_736">123:9</A> <i>Him who brings thee a lock:</i> The thief contrives to sell the shopkeeper a defective lock. If the latter uses it to lock up his shop, the thief takes advantage of the first opportunity to effect an entrance and to help himself to the merchant's goods.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_737"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_737">124:1</A> <i>Hemp</i> (<FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT>): Arabicized from the Persian <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> (Sanskrit <i>bhang&#257;</i>), Baron Hammer Purgstall is wrong in identifying it with the Coptic <i>bendj</i>, plural <i>nebendj</i>, which he says is the same plant as the &#0957;&#0951;&#0960;&#0949;&#0957;&#0952;&#0951;&#0962; which so much perplexed the commentators of Homer (<A HREF="errata.htm#8">Odyssey</A>, 4. 221 sq.), for two reasons:</p>  
<p><DIR>(a) There is no such word as <i>bendj</i> or <i>nebendj</i> in Coptic.</p>  
<p>(b) It is a good Sanskrit word and is found in the Athara-Veda Samhita (xi. 6. 15). Also see Monier Williams' Sanskrit and English Dictionary, article Bhang&#257;.</DIR></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_738"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_738">124:2</A> <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> <i>By juggling:</i> Arabicized from the Persian <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> literally anything new; also magic and enchantment.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_739"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_739">124:3</A> <i>Him who changes his shoes:</i> A very easy thing to do at the masjid or the bath where shoes and sandals have to be left outside.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_740"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_740">124:4</A> <i>Him who ties his two ropes:</i> the modus operandi is this: The thief climbs upon the terrace or roof of a house, ties to the end of a rope what he wishes to steal, descends quickly and pulls his booty down.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_741"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_741">124:5</A> <i>Him who ascends from the well:</i> Which he has been using as a place of concealment.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_743"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_743">124:7</A> <i>The gentry of the cloth:</i> That is, the wearers of the ascetic garb. This is still a very popular form of disguise in the East.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_744"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_744">124:8</A> <i>Him who enters the assemblies:</i> By virtue of being well-dressed and of respectable appearance. This is the fourth time the author uses the word <i>Maq&aacute;ma</i>. Here it means companies of respectable people.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_745"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_745">124:9</A> <i>From the night patrol:</i> The thief enters a house to rob it. If he is surprised, he declares he has run away from the night patrol and is the victim of an injustice. If he is believed he waits for an opportunity to help himself and then disappears.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_746"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_746">124:10</A> <i>Him who flies the bird:</i> The thief causes his pigeon to fly into a house and then follows it. If he is discovered he pretends he has come for his bird. This is like the excuse of the poacher who, when found trespassing, asserts he is looking for his sheep!</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_747"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_747">124:11</A> <i>Him who plays with the strap:</i> The explanation of this trick is as follows: The thief starts a game which consists of one hiding something and asking another to say where it is. If he fails he is beaten on his hand or leg with a strap. Such a game is bound to end in a quarrel which the sharper takes advantage of to appropriate whatever he can.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_748"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_748">125:1</A> <i>Him who gets a meal:</i> Literally, to blow the trumpet, which means to indulge in vain and empty talk.

<P><A NAME="fn_750"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_750">125:3</A> <i>The master gardeners:</i> The thief represents himself to be an expert gardener. If you employ him he soon begins to help himself to the produce of the garden and this he does without arousing suspicion, because he is thought to have your authority to do so <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> Gardens: Arabicized from the well-known Persian word <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> <i>B&uacute;st&aacute;n</i>.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_755"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_755">125:8</A> <i>The possessors of keys:</i> Those who carry about a number of keys with which they endeavour to open doors, boxes, etc.--pickers of locks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_756"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_756">125:9</A> <i>The men of cotton and wind:</i> The plan is as follows: the thief scatters some cotton so that the wind may blow it into certain houses and then, on the pretext of collecting his cotton, he goes in and robs them. The word <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> is probably of foreign origin.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_757"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_757">126:1</A> <i>When the plunge or dip makes it possible:</i> I think <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> 'to go deep' would make better sense than <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> 'to make possible', i.e. when the bathers plunge into the water.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_758"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_758">126:2</A> <i>Him who robs with two sticks:</i> The thief stands upon the roof of his house and lies in wait for the caravan.

<P><A NAME="fn_759"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_759">126:3</A> <i>Him who swears to a debt:</i> This is a species of black-mailing.

<P><A NAME="fn_761"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_761">126:5</A> <i>Him who gives a bill of exchange:</i> The fraud is perpetrated as follows: The thief sees a traveller with a large sum of money in cash and offers to relieve him of the trouble of carrying it by giving him a bill of exchange on some one in the town to which he is journeying. The bill is, of course, worthless. (<FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT>) Arabicized from the Persian <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> literally, pierced; a consignment made by a person of one country to a person of another.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_762"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_762">126:6</A> <i>Him who changes the purse:</i> The swindler bargains for some goods, produces a purse and counts out in gold or silver a sum which the shopkeeper declines to take, he then puts the purse back into his pocket. The haggling continues, and eventually he persuades the shopkeeper to accept the amount first counted. He then pulls out a purse exactly like the first, but which contains only coppers. If the merchant accepts the purse without counting the contents, the thief makes off with the goods.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_763"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_763">126:7</A> <i>Him who gives to bankrupts:</i> The swindler contrives to secure the confidence of some merchants, takes a quantity of goods and sells them on credit to impecunious traders, at double the prime cost, and leads the public to believe he is doing a flourishing business. Then, when he has sold them articles of the value equal to what he owes his creditors, he announces he has gone bankrupt and that his outstandings represent exactly the amount of his liabilities. In this way he benefits by precisely half the amount of goods he has taken from his creditors.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_764"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_764">126:8</A> <i>Him who clips his sleeve:</i> When the sharper sees a man placing some money before a shopkeeper, or a money changer, he seizes him and accuses him of having robbed him and exhibits his cut sleeve as evidence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_765"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_765">126:9</A> <i>Him who stitches the breast:</i> This is similar to the mantle trick.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_766"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_766">126:10</A> <i>Him who says 'Dost thou not know?'</i> The swindler goes up to his dupe and says, 'Art thou not aware of what happened to so and so to-day? A thief seized his clothes thus'--suiting the action to the word--pulls him and, in the pulling, contrives to rob him of his money.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_767"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_767">127:1</A> <i>Him who bites:</i> The sharper picks a quarrel with some one and, when they come to blows and seize each other he contrives, in the struggle, to tear with his teeth his antagonist's clothes where he thinks the money is put away.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_768"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_768">127:2</A> <i>Him who ties:</i> The thief being seated near some one he wishes to rob, attaches to a piece of string, which he retains hold of, whatever he finds it possible to relieve the individual of. When the man gets up and goes away, the article is left behind.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_769"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_769">127:3</A> <i>'He is not asleep':</i> The robber and his accomplices find a man asleep and make a noise until they wake him by saying, 'He is asleep' or 'He is not asleep', and in their conversation they lead him to believe that they have buried a treasure there, and so now he pretends to be asleep. Then to prove whether or no he is asleep they begin to feel him and, during the process, rob him. After they have gone he gets up only to find that he has been both robbed and hoaxed and the buried treasure consists of worthless shells.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_770"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_770">127:4</A> <i>Him who deceives thee with a thousand:</i> The sharper deposits for safe custody with a merchant a bag supposed to contain a thousand dinars. On the top he has put a layer or two of dinars while the remainder consists of coppers. He returns later and takes out a few pieces. This is repeated until the silver is exhausted. Then he buys largely from the merchant who unhesitatingly gives him credit in the belief that he has a large sum in deposit. He then bolts. After some time has elapsed the merchant gets suspicious, opens the bag and discovers that he has been duped.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_771"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_771">127:5</A> <i>Him who passes behind:</i> The thief goes with an accomplice to a shop and asks &iacute;or something which he cleverly passes unobserved to his fellow who immediately runs away with it. He then pretends to be very much upset and exclaims: 'What am Ito do? The fellow has gone off with it!'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_772"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_772">127:6</A> <i>Him who steals in fetters:</i> The robber appears as an escaped prisoner in fetters and tells a pitiful tale how he has been unjustly dealt with. You pity him, loose his bonds, and treat him kindly. He repays your kindness by robbing you the first opportunity he gets.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_773"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_773">127:7</A> <i>Him who beats with the shoe:</i> The sharper takes off his old shoes to beat some one who has a good pair. The latter takes his off to retaliate and in the struggle that ensues the former makes off with the good shoes of the latter!</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_774"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_774">127:8</A> <i>Him who questions the truth:</i> The thief knows you have a certain sum of money with you. He approaches you and says he has goods to sell of greater value than the money you possess, but he is willing to take what you actually have. He then asks if you have the amount with you and you say 'Yes'. He will retort 'Never'. Then you produce it and count it. If he can contrive to get hold of it he will swear it does not belong to you. Then he either bolts with all or makes a compromise with you.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_775"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_775">128:1</A> <i>Him who got the better of then:</i> That is, the thieves. This story has been suppressed on grounds of decency.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_776"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_776">128:2</A> <i>And a phantom:</i> Metre, <i>taw&iacute;l</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_777"></A><A HREF="mhm38.htm#fr_777">128:3</A> <i>In a garb not his own:</i> The usual garb of night is darkness, so that 'not his own' would mean brightness, i.e. moonlight. Night personified is here regarded as masculine.</p>  
<p>This maq&aacute;ma may be compared to Har&iacute;r&iacute;, xxx, 372, in which we have examples of the cant of beggars, mountebanks, prestigiators and the like. Here Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute; gives illustrations of the methods pursued by the fraternity of burglars, thieves, sharpers, swindlers, pickpockets and the like. Cf. Gaubari, <i>Endickte Geheimnisse</i> (von de Go&eacute;je Z.D.M.G.), xx, 504.</P>
