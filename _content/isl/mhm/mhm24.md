### XVI. THE MAQAMA OF THE BLIND

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was passing through one of the
towns of Ahwaz when my supreme object was to capture a stray word, <span
id="fr_438"></span>[6](#fn_438) or add to my store an eloquent
expression. My journeying led me to a vast open space of the town where
lo!

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

there was a company of people gathered around and listening to a man who
was tapping the ground with beats which varied not, I knew there must be
a tune with those beats. So I withdrew not, in order that I might enjoy
the song or hear a chaste expression, but remained among the spectators,
shouldering this one and pushing that one, until I reached the man. I
passed my eye over him <span id="fr_439"></span>[1](#fn_439)and I found
him to be a person short and portly like a beetle, <span
id="fr_440"></span>[2](#fn_440) blind, and wrapped up in a woollen
blanket, whirling round like a top, wearing a burnous <span
id="fr_441"></span>[3](#fn_441) too long for him, and supporting himself
with a staff to which were attached a number of tiny bells. With this he
was beating the ground with a rythmical sound, while with plaintive air
and pathetic voice proceeding from a straightened breast, he sang:--

'O people my debt weighs down my back, <span
id="fr_442"></span>[4](#fn_442)  
And my wife demands her dowry,  
After abundance and plenty, I have become  
A dweller in a barren land and an ally of penury.  
O people, is there a generous man among ye,  
Who will aid me against the vicissitudes of time?  
O people, because of my poverty my patience is exhausted,  
While now no flowing robes my state conceal,  
Time with its destroying hand hath scattered  
What I had of silver and gold;  
In the evening I repair to a house the size of a span,  
My lot is obscure and my pot is small.  
If God but seal my affair with good,  
He will send me ease after difficulty.  
Is there among ye a worthy youth of noble origin,  
Who will acquire through me a great reward?  
Even though he value not thankfulness?'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: By Heavens! my heart became tender towards him and
my eyes were filled with tears for him.

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> So I gave him a
dinar I had with me. And he delayed not but said:--

'What beauty is hers <span id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_443) and how
intensely yellow.  
Light, stamped and round,  
Water almost drops from her lustre,  
A noble mind hath produced her,  
Yea, a soul of a youth possessed by generosity,  
Which makes him do what it will.  
O thou for whom this praise is meant,  
Exaggeration cannot describe the extent of thy worth.  
I therefore refer thee to God <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_444) with
whom is thy reward.  
May God have mercy upon him who will bind her to her pair  
And associate her with her sister.'

The people then gave him what they were disposed to give. Then he left
them. But I followed him, for I knew by the quickness with which he
recognized the dinar that he was feigning blindness. As soon as we were
alone <span id="fr_445"></span>[3](#fn_445) I stretched forth my right
hand, seized his left arm and said: 'By Heavens! thou shalt disclose to
me thy secret, or else I will assuredly expose thee.' Then he opened his
pair of almonds. <span id="fr_446"></span>[4](#fn_446) I drew his veil
from his face and behold--by Heavens! it was our Sheikh Abú’l-Fatḥ,
al-Iskanderí. Said I: 'Art thou Abú’l-Fatḥ?' He answered: 'Nay;

I am Abú Qalamún, <span id="fr_447"></span>[5](#fn_447) In every hue do
I appear,  
Choose a base calling, For base is thy age,  
Repel time <span id="fr_448"></span>[6](#fn_448) with folly, For verily
time is a kicking camel.  
Never be deceived by reason, Madness is the only reason.' <span
id="fr_449"></span>[7](#fn_449)
