### LI. THE MAQAMA OF BISHR

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: Bishr ibn ‘Awánah, the ‘Abdíte,
was a robber, and he made a raid upon some riders on camels among whom
was a beautiful woman whom he married. And he said: 'I have never seen
the like of to-day.' <span id="fr_1088"></span>[4](#fn_1088) So she
recited:--

'The intense blackness in my eye, <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[5](#fn_1089) and a fore-arm white as silver have
delighted Bishr,  
Whilst there is near him, within view, one of slender waist walking
proudly in a pair of anklets,  
The most beautiful of those that walk on two feet. <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[6](#fn_1090)  
If Bishr were to bring her and me together,  
My exile would be lasting and my separation prolonged:  
And, if he were to measure her beauty with mine,  
The morning would manifest itself to the possessor of two eyes.'  <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[7](#fn_1091)

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

Said Bishr: 'Fie on thee! <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1](#fn_1092) Whom
dost thou mean?' She replied: 'Thy paternal uncle's daughter, Fátima.'
He asked: 'Is she as beautiful as thou hast described?' She answered:
'More so, and much more so.' Then he recited saying:--

'Fie on thee! O possessor of white front teeth, I did not think I would
exchange thee;  
But now thou hast signified by allusion, the valley is open to thee, so
sing and lay thine eggs. <span id="fr_1093"></span>[2](#fn_1093)  
Mine eyelids shall not close in slumber until I raise mine honour from
base degrees.'

So she said:--

'Many a wooer  <span id="fr_1094"></span>[3](#fn_1094) has importunately
pressed his suit for her,  
While she is cousin to thee, the daughter of a paternal uncle, closely
related.' <span id="fr_1095"></span>[4](#fn_1095)

Then he sent to his uncle asking for his daughter in marriage, but the
uncle denied him his request. <span id="fr_1096"></span>[5](#fn_1096)
Therefore he swore not to show any of them any consideration, if he
would not marry his daughter to him. So he inflicted many injuries upon
them, and continuously vexed them. Therefore the men of the tribe
assembled before his uncle and said: 'Save us from thy madman.' He
replied: 'Clothe me not with infamy, <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[6](#fn_1097) but respite me that I may destroy him
by stratagem.' They said: 'Do so.' Then his uncle said to him: 'I have
sworn not to marry this my

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

daughter, save to him who will drive to her a thousand she-camels as a
dowry, and I will be satisfied with none but the she-camels of the
Khuzá‘ah.' <span id="fr_1098"></span>[1](#fn_1098) Now the object of the
uncle was that Bishr should traverse the road between him and the
Khuzá‘ah so that a lion might tear him to pieces; for the Arabs used to
avoid that way in which there was a lion named Dadh and a serpent called
Shuja‘. One of them says concerning her

'Swifter to slay <span id="fr_1099"></span>[2](#fn_1099) than Dadh <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[3](#fn_1100) and Shuja‘.  
If Dadh is the king of beasts, she is the queen of serpents.'

Then did Bishr travel that road, but he had not traversed half of it
when he met the lion. His colt reared and beat the ground with its
hind-feet. So he alighted and hamstrung it. Then he drew his sword on
the lion, attacked it and cut it in two, breadthwise. Then he wrote with
the blood of the lion on his shirt to his cousin:--

'O 'Fáṭima, <span id="fr_1101"></span>[4](#fn_1101) if thou hadst been
present in the valley of Khabt, <span id="fr_1102"></span>[5](#fn_1102)
when the lion met thy brother Bishr,  
Then thou wouldst have seen a lion <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[6](#fn_1103) visiting a lion, the lion victorious
meeting another.  
"He advanced proudly, <span id="fr_1104"></span>[7](#fn_1104) and my
colt timidly drew back and I exclaimed, "Mayest thou be slaughtered for
a colt!  
Let both my feet reach the surface of the ground, for I perceive the
earth has a surer back than thou."

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

And I said to him <span id="fr_1105"></span>[1](#fn_1105)--and he had
displayed sharpened fangs and a frowning face;  
In treachery one of his paws gripped the ground while he stretched forth
the other to pounce upon me,  
Indicating his strength of claw, sharpness of fang and glances thou
wouldst reckon to be live coals;  
And in my right hand was a keen edge, upon whose blade the trace of
deadly blows remains--  
Hath it not reached thee what its keen edges did at Káz̤ima, <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[2](#fn_1106) the morning I met ‘Amr?  
And my heart is like thine, it dreads not the attack, then how should it
fear intimidation?  
And thou desirest for the cubs food, and I seek for the paternal uncle's
daughter a dowry.  
Therefore in respect of what dost thou induce one like me to turn his
back, and, perforce, to place his life in thy hands?  
I have admonished thee, O lion, therefore seek other than me as food,
for verily my flesh is bitter.  
But when he thought my counsel insincere and he disagreed with me, as
though I had spoken vainly,  
He moved and I moved, like two lions desiring one object, which, when
they sought it, they found to be difficult of attainment.  
I shook the sword at him and I thought verily I had with it drawn forth
the dawn in the darkness.  
And I bestowed upon him a deadly blow, which showed him that it told him
false when it promised him it would betray me.  
I let the Indian sword in my right hand go, and it slashed ten of his
ribs.  
So he fell on the ground covered with blood, and it was as though in him
I had demolished a lofty edifice.  
And I said to him; "It is to me a hard thing  <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[3](#fn_1107) that I have slain my like in courage
and glory.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

But thou didst desire a thing that none beside thee desired, therefore,
O lion, I could not endure it.  
Thou didst endeavour to instruct me to flee; by the life of thy father!
thou didst attempt a difficult thing.  
But grieve not, for thou didst meet an ingenuous one who is careful not
to be blamed, therefore, thou hast died honourably.  
For, if thou art slain, there is no disgrace, for thou didst meet one
freeborn on both sides?"'

Now, when these lines reached his uncle, he repented of his forbidding
him to marry her, and he feared lest the serpent might suddenly attack
him. So he arose, went in his track, and came up with him when the
fierceness of the serpent had taken possession of him, but, when he saw
his uncle, rage of the days of savagery <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1](#fn_1108) seized him, so that he put his hand
into the serpent's mouth, thrust his sword into her and said:--

'A Bishr, whose ambition <span id="fr_1109"></span>[2](#fn_1109) for
greatness is far-reaching;  
when his uncle saw him in the open plain,  
It was as though he were bereft of himself, and his mother were bereft
of him;  
She attacked with an attack that caused him concern. Then he arose
against the offspring of the desert and his hand and sleeve disappeared
in its mouth.  
And its life is my life, and my venom is its venom.'

Now when he had slain the serpent, his uncle said: 'Verily I exposed
thee to danger in a matter from which God hath diverted me. So return,
that I may marry thee to my daughter.' Now when he turned back, Bishr
filled his mouth with boasting, until there appeared on his horse a
beardless youth, like unto the crescent moon, enveloped in his weapons.
So he said: 'O Uncle, I hear the sound of a quarry.' And he went forth
and behold, a spear's length off, a young man who said: 'May thy mother
be bereft of thee! O Bishr, if thou hast slain a worm and a beast, dost
thou fill thy jaws with boasting? Thou art safe if thou

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

surrender thy uncle.' Said Bishr: 'Perish thy mother! Who art thou?' He
answered: 'The black day and the red death.' <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1](#fn_1110) Said Bishr: 'May she, who excreted
thee, be bereft of thee.' He retorted: 'O Bishr and she that excreted
thee.' Then each one attacked the other, but Bishr could do nothing to
him, while the youth was able to inflict upon him twenty thrusts in the
region of the kidneys, <span id="fr_1111"></span>[2](#fn_1111) but, as
often as the point of the spear touched him, he prevented it from
wounding his body, in order to spare him. He said: 'O Bishr, what
thinkest thou? Could I not, if I wished, have given thee as food to the
point of the spear?' <span id="fr_1112"></span>[3](#fn_1112)

He then threw down the spear, drew his sword, and struck Bishr twenty
blows with the flat of the blade, but Bishr could not deal him one. Then
he said: 'O Bishr, surrender thy uncle and go in safety.' He replied:
'Yes, on condition that thou tell me who thou art.' He said: 'I am thy
son.' He <span id="fr_1113"></span>[4](#fn_1113) exclaimed: 'Good
gracious! I have never approached a worthy woman, whence then this
gift?' He answered: 'I am the son of the woman who directed thee to thy
uncle's daughter.' Then said Bishr:--

'That staff is from this stave. <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[5](#fn_1114)  
Does the serpent bring forth other than the serpent?' <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[6](#fn_1115)

And he swore never to ride a noble steed or wed a fair lady. Then he
married his uncle's daughter to his son.
