<p>that chief scholar and narrator of the Arabs, &#8216;Ismat ibn Badr, the Faz&aacute;rite'.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The conversation finally led us to discuss those who pardon their enemies out of gentleness and those who forgive them out of contempt, till we mentioned As-&#7778;alatan, al-&#8216;Abd&iacute;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and al-Ba&#8216;ith,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the contempt of Jar&iacute;r and al-Farazdaq for them.</p>  
<p>Said &#8216;Ismat: 'I will relate to you what mine eyes have seen and not what I have got from another. When I was journeying in the country of Tam&iacute;m, mounted on a noble camel and leading a spare mount, there appeared before me a rider on a dusky camel, frothing thickly at the mouth. He continued to advance towards me till our bodies collided,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> when he shouted: "Peace be unto you!" I said, "And upon thee peace and the mercy and blessing of God! Who is the loud-voiced rider who salutes with the salutation of Isl&aacute;m?" He answered: "I am Ghailan, ibn &#8216;Uqba." So I said: Welcome to him of fair renown and famous lineage whose diction is well-known." He replied: "Broad be thy valley and powerful thy associates! but who art thou? I answered, "I am &#8216;Ismat ibn Badr, the Faz&aacute;rite." He said, "May God prolong thy life! What an excellent friend, associate and companion!" Then we travelled together. When we had journeyed on till noon,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> he said: "&Iacute;smat, shall we not take a nap, for the sun has melted our brain?

Then we unsaddled and partook of some food. Now Dh&uacute;'l-Rumma was a small eater. After that we prayed. Then each of us betook himself to the shade of a tamarisk tree, intending to take the noonday nap. Dh&uacute;&#8217;l-Rumma lay down and I desired to do as he did. So I lay on my back, but no sleep took possession of my eyes. I looked and saw a short distance of a large-humped camel, jaded by the sun, with her saddle thrown off, and behold a man like a hireling, or slave was standing guarding her. But I turned away from them, for what had I to do with enquiring about that which did not concern me? Dh&uacute;&#8217;l-Rumma slept for a little&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> while and then awoke. Now this was in the days of his satirizing the tribe of Murr&iacute;, so he raised his voice,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and recited saying:--</p>  
<p><DIR>"Are the traces of Maiya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to be found on the obliterated surface of the sand dune<br> Which the gale has persistently covered up?<br> Nought remains but a battered tent-peg,<br> And a fireplace without a fire-taker,<br> A cistern with both sides broken,</DIR></p>

<p>When he got as far as this verse, the sleeper awoke, began to rub his eyes and to say: "Does little Dh&uacute; al-Rumma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> deprive me of sleep with an incorrect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and unpopular poem?" I said: "O Ghailan, who is this?" He replied: "al-Farazdaq?" Then Dh&uacute; al-Rumma waxed hot and said:--</p>  
<p><DIR>"As for the base men of Maj&aacute;sh&#8216;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> Never has the thunder-cloud watered their pastures.<br> Soon they will be fettered and restrained from noble enterprises,<br> And the restrainer shall restrain them!"</DIR></p>  
<p>Then I said: "Now he will choke and fret and thoroughly lampoon him and his tribe."</p>  
<p>But by Heavens! al-Farazdaq only said: "Fie on thee little Dh&uacute; al-Rumma dost thou oppose one like me with stolen verses?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Then he went to sleep again, as though he had not heard anything. Dh&uacute; al-Rumma went away and I went with him, and verily I perceived in him humiliation until we parted.'</p>

Mr. Macartney, the editor of Dh&uacute;&#8217;l-Rumma's Diw&aacute;n, to whose courtesy I am indebted for much useful information regarding this poet, says, 'although these verses put into the mouth of Dh&uacute;&#8217;l-Rumma do not exist in the MSS. of the Diw&aacute;n, still they have a genuine ring and the ideas have their correspondences in the Diw&aacute;n.'</P>

<p>This Qa&#7779;&iacute;da begins with the conventional erotic prologue over the deserted encampment of the beloved, a prelude which was condemned in the poet's own day. It is related that, as Dh&uacute; al-Rumma was reciting his verses in the camel market, he said to al-Farazdaq who stopped to hear him: 'Well, Ab&uacute; Fir&aacute;s! what dost thou think of that which thou hast heard?' Al-Farazdaq replied: 'What thou hast uttered is really admirable.' 'Why then ', said the other, 'is my name not mentioned with those of the first-rate poets?' 'Thou hast been prevented from attaining their eminence' answered al-Farazdaq 'by thy lamentations over dunghills, and thy descriptions of the excrements of cattle and their pinfolds.' Ibn Khallikan, ii, 447.</P>
