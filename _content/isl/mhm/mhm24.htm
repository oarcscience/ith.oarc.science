<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: I was passing through one of the towns of Ahwaz when my supreme object was to capture a stray word,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> or add to my store an eloquent expression. My journeying led me to a vast open space of the town where lo!</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></p>  
<p>there was a company of people gathered around and listening to a man who was tapping the ground with beats which varied not, I knew there must be a tune with those beats. So I withdrew not, in order that I might enjoy the song or hear a chaste expression, but remained among the spectators, shouldering this one and pushing that one, until I reached the man. I passed my eye over him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>and I found him to be a person short and portly like a beetle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> blind, and wrapped up in a woollen blanket, whirling round like a top, wearing a burnous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> too long for him, and supporting himself with a staff to which were attached a number of tiny bells. With this he was beating the ground with a rythmical sound, while with plaintive air and pathetic voice proceeding from a straightened breast, he sang:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'O people my debt weighs down my back,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><br> And my wife demands her dowry,<br> After abundance and plenty, I have become<br> A dweller in a barren land and an ally of penury.<br> O people, is there a generous man among ye,<br> Who will aid me against the vicissitudes of time?<br> O people, because of my poverty my patience is exhausted,<br> While now no flowing robes my state conceal,<br> Time with its destroying hand hath scattered<br> What I had of silver and gold;<br> In the evening I repair to a house the size of a span,<br> My lot is obscure and my pot is small.<br> If God but seal my affair with good,<br> He will send me ease after difficulty.<br> Is there among ye a worthy youth of noble origin,<br> Who will acquire through me a great reward?<br> Even though he value not thankfulness?'</DIR></p>  
<p>Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: By Heavens! my heart became tender towards him and my eyes were filled with tears for him.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> So I gave him a dinar I had with me. And he delayed not but said:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'What beauty is hers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and how intensely yellow.<br> Light, stamped and round,<br> Water almost drops from her lustre,<br> A noble mind hath produced her,<br> Yea, a soul of a youth possessed by generosity,<br> Which makes him do what it will.<br> O thou for whom this praise is meant,<br> Exaggeration cannot describe the extent of thy worth.<br> I therefore refer thee to God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_444"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with whom is thy reward.<br> May God have mercy upon him who will bind her to her pair<br> And associate her with her sister.'</DIR></p>  
<p>The people then gave him what they were disposed to give. Then he left them. But I followed him, for I knew by the quickness with which he recognized the dinar that he was feigning blindness. As soon as we were alone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_445"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> I stretched forth my right hand, seized his left arm and said: 'By Heavens! thou shalt disclose to me thy secret, or else I will assuredly expose thee.' Then he opened his pair of almonds.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_446"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> I drew his veil from his face and behold--by Heavens! it was our Sheikh Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717;, al-Iskander&iacute;. Said I: 'Art thou Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717;?' He answered: 'Nay;</p>  
<p><DIR>I am Ab&uacute; Qalam&uacute;n,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> In every hue do I appear,<br> Choose a base calling, For base is thy age,<br> Repel time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> with folly, For verily time is a kicking camel.<br> Never be deceived by reason, Madness is the only reason.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></DIR></p>
