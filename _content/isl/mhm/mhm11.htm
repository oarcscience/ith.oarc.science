Now when separation bent, or was about to bend, its bow at us, there came into my presence a youth in an attractive &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> dress with a beard that extended so far as to pierce the two arteries attached to the jugular vein, and with eyes which had absorbed the waters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of the two rivers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. He met me with such benefaction that I proportionately increased my praise of it. Then he asked me: 'Dost thou intend to go on a journey?' I replied: 'Yes, indeed.' He said, 'May thy scout find good pasture and thy guide not lose his way! When dost thou intend to start?' I answered, 'Early to-morrow morning.' Then he indited the following:--</p>

<p>Whither art thou going? I replied: 'To my own country.' He said, 'Mayest thou reach thy native land and accomplish thy business; but when dost thou return? I answered, 'Next year.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> He then said: 'Mayest thou fold the robes and roll up the thread?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> Where art thou in regard to generosity?'

<p>from this road, bring with thee for me an enemy in the guise of a friend, in golden vein that invites to infidelity, spins on the finger, round as the disc of the sun, that lightens the burden of debt and plays the r&ocirc;le of the two-faced.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: 'Then I knew it was a dinar that he demanded.

In the time of Josephus their settlements gave the name Nabatene to the borderland between Syria and Arabia from the Euphrates to the Red Sea. Before their appearance in history, about 312 B.C., they had already some tinge of civilization. Though true Arabs they came under the influence of Aramean culture, and Syriac was the language of their coins and inscriptions when the tribe grew into a kingdom and profited by the decay of the Selucids to extend itself over the country east of the Jordan. As allies of the Romans they continued to flourish throughout the first Christian century. About A.D. 105, Trajan most unwisely broke up the Nabatean nationality. Encl. Bib., iii, 3254-5.</P>
