We replied: 'Guests who have tasted nothing for three nights.' He related: 'He coughed and then said: "O young men! What do you say to fresh butter of the flock, like the head of a bald man, in a broad shallow dish adorned with the dates of Khaibar,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_814"></A><A HREF="#fn_814"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> taken from the bunch of a branch of a tall, young, and large palm-tree?

We answered: 'Yes, by Heavens! we like it.' 'Ha, ha,' laughed the old man, 'Your uncle also likes it.' Then he said: 'O young men! What is your opinion of white flour like unto a piece of molten silver collected on a round piece of hide with the odour of the qaraz&#0804?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_818"></A><A HREF="#fn_818"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> From among you one springs forward, a young, comely and active man, and mixes it without violently disturbing or scattering it. Then he leaves it before it is well kneaded. After a while he mixes it thoroughly with milk, more or less diluted with water.

Then, when the fire subsides, he spreads it over his oven,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_821"></A><A HREF="#fn_821"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> goes to his dough, flattens it out, after he has well kneaded it, lays it upon the hot ashes and then covers it up.'</p>

He related: 'Each one of us stretched his neck towards what he had described, his mouth watered and he licked his lips and smacked them,' and we answered: 'Yes, by Heavens! we like it.' 'Ha! ha!' laughed the old man, and said: 'And your uncle, by Heavens! does not hate it.' Then he said: 'What is your opinion, O young men, of a wild she-kid of Nejd and Aliya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_831"></A><A HREF="#fn_831"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> which has fed upon the artemisia Judaica of Nejd, the artemisia abrotanum and hashim,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_832"></A><A HREF="#fn_832"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> nibbled at the thick herbage and is filled with tender grass?

Next it is suspended head downwards in an oven till it is perfectly baked without being either burnt or underdone, and then it is placed before you with its skin cracked, exposing white fat, on a table with thin cakes disposed thereon, as though they were unfolded Egyptian linen, or fine cloth of Kohist&aacute;n coloured with red clay.

O young men, do you like it?' We replied: 'Yes, by Heavens! we like it.' He said: 'And your uncle, by Heavens! will dance for it.' Then one of us sprang towards him with a sword and said: 'Does not our hunger suffice thee that thou mockest us?' Then his daughter brought us a tray upon which were a piece of dry bread, scraps and leavings, and she entertained us well. So we departed, praising her and blaming him.</p>
