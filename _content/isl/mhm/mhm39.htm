<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: I entered Ba&#7779;ra when I was wide of fame and abundant of reputation, and there came to me two young men. One of them said: 'May God strengthen the Shaikh! this youth entered our house and seized a kitten&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_778"></A><A HREF="#fn_778"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> with vertigo in its head, with the sacred cord&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_779"></A><A HREF="#fn_779"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and a whirling sphere around its middle.

If it be given a thing, it returns it. If it be tasked with a journey, it goes energetically, and, if it is made to draw the rope, it lengthens it. There it is, bone and wood. It contains property, immoveable and moveable, a past and a future.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_781"></A><A HREF="#fn_781"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Said the young man: 'Yes, may God strengthen the Shaikh! for he forcibly took from me:--</p>

He suggests that the correct word is <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> from the Persian <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> a furred animal and, as the context shows, a kitten. I think his view is correct. If we accept as the arabicized form of <FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT> the slight error in pointing is the kind of one a copyist might easily make.</P>
