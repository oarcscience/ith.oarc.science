<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: When I was returning from Yemen and making for my native land, a fellow-traveller joined me with his baggage and we journeyed together for three days, until the highland attracted me, and the lowland swallowed him. So I ascended and he descended. I fared eastwards and he went westwards, but I regretted separating from him after the mountain and its ruggedness took possession of me, and the vale and its depth seized him.</p>  
<p>'By Heavens! separation from him left me desiring him, and he left me suffering from his absence after him. Now when I parted from him, he was a man of wealth and beauty, of goodly appearance and perfection. Well, Time dealt us its</p>

<p>blows, but I pictured him to myself at all times, and called him to mind every moment, and I did not think Time would help me to him or through him, till I carne to Shir&aacute;z.</p>  
<p>'Now one day, while I was in my chamber,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_784"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> suddenly there appeared before me an old man, whose countenance poverty had marred,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_785"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> whose lustre Time had entirely exhausted, whose erectness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_786"></A><A HREF="#fn_786"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> disease had bent, and whose nails destitution had clipped; with a face more wretched than his actual state, and a garb more dreadful than his condition, with dry gums and parched lips, muddy feet, with a blistered hand,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> with canine teeth that misfortune had destroyed, and a bitter existence. And he saluted me. My eye disdained him, but I returned his greeting. So he said: 'O God make us better than we are suspected to be.' Therefore I smoothed out for him the wrinkles of my face,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_788"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> opened my ear to him and said: 'Proceed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_789"></A><A HREF="#fn_789"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> with thy story!' Then he said: 'I have suckled thee on the breast of covenant, and shared with thee the rein of protection&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_790"></A><A HREF="#fn_790"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and, in the opinion of the wise, acquaintance is sacred and friendship is kinship.' I then said: 'Art thou a fellow-townsman, or a fellow-tribesman?' He said: 'Nought unites us save the land of exile, and nothing binds us together but the relationship of neighbourhood.' Then I asked: 'Which road bound us both with one cord?' He replied: 'The road to Yemen.' Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: So I asked: 'Art thou Ab&uacute;&#8217;l Fat&#7717; al-Iskander&iacute;?' He replied: 'I am that person.' I said:</p>
