<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: While we were at Sariah&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1036"></A><A HREF="#fn_1036"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with the governor thereof there came before him a youth with the fragrance of saffron upon him. So the assembly stood up for him and, out of respect, he was seated in the chief place; but awe of him hindered me from asking him his name. Then he began and said to the governor: 'What hast thou done with yesterday's discussion, perhaps thou hast relegated it to oblivion?'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1037"></A><A HREF="#fn_1037"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> He said: 'God forbid! but there has hindered me from attaining to it a reason which it is impossible to explain, and one whose wounds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1038"></A><A HREF="#fn_1038"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> cannot be healed?' Said the intruder: 'Sirrah, the delay in the fulfilment of this promise has been long, and I shall not find thy morrow regarding it other than thy to-day, or</p>

<p><A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thy to-day concerning it other than thy yesterday. In promise breaking, I can only compare thee to the Salix Aegyptia tree whose blossoms fill the eye, but there is no fruit there.'</p>  
<p>Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: When he had reached this point,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1039"></A><A HREF="#fn_1039"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I cut him short and said: 'God guard thee, art thou not al-Iskander&iacute;?' He answered: 'And perpetual may thy preservation be, how excellent is thy sagacity!' Then I said: 'Welcome to the commander of speech and to the stray of the generous.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1040"></A><A HREF="#fn_1040"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I have searched for it till I found it, and sought it till I obtained it.' Then we became mutually friendly till the highland attracted me and the lowland swallowed him. I ascended and he descended, and I fared eastwards and he westwards. After his departure, I said:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'O would that I knew of a brother&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1041"></A><A HREF="#fn_1041"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> whose hands were straitened, but whose fame was extensive:<br> Last night he passed with me, but where will he pass this our night?<br> May poverty not prosper,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1042"></A><A HREF="#fn_1042"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> for he is its exile, and, owing to poverty, I have been deprived of him.<br> I will surely place over it, in Khalaf ibn A&#7717;mad, one who will destroy it.'</DIR></p>
