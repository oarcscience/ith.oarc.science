<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M: related to us and said: I entered Ba&#7779;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_379"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> when, as regards age, I was in the prime of youth; as to attire,</p>  
<p>I was clad in the variegated striped stuffs of Yemen, and, in the</p>

<p>matter of wealth, I had cattle and sheep. And I came to Mirbad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_380"></A><A HREF="#fn_380"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with some friends upon whom eyes fastened.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_381"></A><A HREF="#fn_381"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> We proceeded a short distance to the recreation grounds among the green plains wherein a certain spot arrested us and so we alighted there. We made for the gaming arrows of pleasure and whirled them, throwing off bashfulness, as there was not one among us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> who was not of us. But in less than the twinkling of an eye, there came in our view the figure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of a man which the hollows lowered from, and the ridges exposed to sight. We perceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_384"></A><A HREF="#fn_384"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> he was coming towards us and so we craned our necks to see him, till his journeying brought him to us. He greeted us with the salutation of Isl&aacute;m and we returned him the due greeting.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_385"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Then he ran his eye over us and said: 'O people, there is not one of you but looks askance at me with excessive caution. Now none can acquaint you concerning me more truthfully than I can myself. I am a man from among the citizens of Alexandria&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_386"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> on the Umayyad frontiers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_387"></A><A HREF="#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> Excellence was generous to me,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_388"></A><A HREF="#fn_388"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> pleasure hailed me, and a distinguished house bred me.</p>  
<p>Then did fortune deny me both her meaner and better gifts, and caused little ones with inflamed crops to follow me,</p>  
<p><DIR>As if they were serpents&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_389"></A><A HREF="#fn_389"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> in an arid land,<br> Whose venom would be fatal were they to bite.<br> When we tarry they send me out to earn,<br> And when we travel they ride on me.'</DIR></p>

<p>'Now is there a youth who will give them a supper, or cover them? And is there a generous man who will grant them a morning meal, or clothe them?'</p>  
<p>Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: By Heavens! there had never sought the seclusion of my ear a speech more winning, estimable, loftier or more original than that which I heard from him. Perforce we had recourse to our belts,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> rejecting our sleeves, and eschewing our pockets.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> And I gave him my ornamented robe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_405"></A><A HREF="#fn_405"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and the company followed my example,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_406"></A><A HREF="#fn_406"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and we said to him: 'Go and join thy children.' So he turned away from us after thanksgiving, to which he rendered the full meed, and eulogy with which he filled his mouth.</p>
