<p>SAID &#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M: One of my journeys set me down at Damascus. Now one day when I was at the door of my house there suddenly appeared before me a troop of the sons of S&aacute;s&aacute;n.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>

<p>They had muffled up their faces, and besmeared their clothes with red ochre while each of them had tucked under his armpit a stone with which he beat his breast. Among them was their chief, who was reciting, they alternating with him; he intoning and they answering him. And, when he saw me, he said:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'I desire from thee&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a white cake upon a clean table.<br> I desire course salt, I want plucked greens.<br> I desire fresh meat, I want some sour vinegar.<br> I desire a sucking kid, I want a young ram.<br> I desire water with ice, filled in a rare vessel.<br> I desire a vat of wine from which I may get up drunk,<br> And a cheerful cup-bearer, congenial to the minds.<br> I desire from thee a shirt, a coat and a turban.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> I desire thick sandals, with which I may visit the privy.<br> I desire a comb and a razor, I want a vessel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and a bath glove,<br> O what an excellent guest am I! and what a charming host art thou!<br> I will be content with this from thee, and I do not wish to impose.'</DIR></p>  
<p>Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m, I gave him a dirhem and said to him, 'I announce to thee the invitation, and we will soon prepare and</p>

<p>make ready to receive thee. We will do our best endeavour and thou hast our promise for the future. And this dirhem will be a reminder for thee, so take the ready money and expect the promised.' He seized it and went to another man, and I thought he would address him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with the same with which he had addressed me, but he recited:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'O excellent one!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who hath appeared,<br> As if in stature he were a branch.<br> My tooth desires meat,<br> Therefore coat it with bread.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> And bestow something upon me and give it now down,<br> Drop thy hand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> from thy waist and undo the purse's knot,<br> And put both thy hands&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> under both thy arms for me designedly.'</DIR></p>  
<p>Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: When this speech of his had penetrated my ear I&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> knew there was excellence behind it, so I followed him until he reached the mother of his house, and I stood away from him so that he could not see me, but I could see him. The princes lowered their veils and behold their chief was Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717;, al-Iskander&iacute;! So I looked at him and said: 'Sirrah, what meaneth this fraud?' Then he indited, saying,</p>  
<p><DIR>'This age is ill-starred,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A><br> And, as thou seest, oppressive;<br> In it stupidity is estimable<br> And intelligence a defect and a reproach,<br> And wealth is a nocturnal visitant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> but<br> It hovers only over the ignoble.'</DIR></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_492"></A><A HREF="mhm27.htm#fr_492">81:7</A> <i>S&aacute;s&aacute;n:</i> S&aacute;s&aacute;n al-Akbar, son of Bahman, son of Isfandiyar, son of Gushtasp a prince of Western Persia, is the reputed chief and patron of all beggars and mountebanks. The legend mentioned by Ibn al-M&uacute;kaff&aacute; is that B&aacute;hman being near his death sent for his daughter &#7716;omaya, who was pregnant, and settled the succession on her and her child, if the child proved a boy, to the exclusion of his own son S&aacute;s&aacute;n. S&aacute;s&aacute;n indignant at this left the court and lived the life of a shepherd among the Kurds so that his name became a proverb for one who leads a vagabond <A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A> life. Hence 'the people of S&aacute;s&aacute;n, the Kurd', is a phrase signifying beggars, prestigiators, people that feign blindness, go about with dogs, monkeys and the like. These people had a cant of their own which was not thought unworthy of study by the learned.</p>  
<p>Sher&iacute;sh&iacute; gives another account of the origin of this term. He says that after the Persians had been subdued in the time of the Khal&iacute;fa &#8216;Umar, they submitted peaceably to the conquerors adopting their manners and their religion, and that, being a clever and artful people, they betook themselves to various ways of making a living, one of which was mendicancy. Their way of exciting commiseration was to give out that they belonged to the royal house of S&aacute;s&aacute;n, or, as we call them, the S&aacute;s&aacute;nians, and to describe the cruel change of fortune and their deplorable condition. So that at last people came to call a beggar a S&aacute;s&aacute;n&iacute;. This may be the true derivation, but it is evident from the forty-ninth maq&aacute;ma that &#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute; adopted the legend which makes S&aacute;s&aacute;n a real person. (Chenery, translation of <i>&#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute;</i>, p. 287-8, and <i>&#7716;ar&iacute;r&iacute;</i> i. 23.)</P>
