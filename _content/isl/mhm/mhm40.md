### XXXII. THE MAQAMA OF SHIRAZ <span id="fr_783"></span>[4](#fn_783)

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: When I was returning from Yemen
and making for my native land, a fellow-traveller joined me with his
baggage and we journeyed together for three days, until the highland
attracted me, and the lowland swallowed him. So I ascended and he
descended. I fared eastwards and he went westwards, but I regretted
separating from him after the mountain and its ruggedness took
possession of me, and the vale and its depth seized him.

'By Heavens! separation from him left me desiring him, and he left me
suffering from his absence after him. Now when I parted from him, he was
a man of wealth and beauty, of goodly appearance and perfection. Well,
Time dealt us its

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

blows, but I pictured him to myself at all times, and called him to mind
every moment, and I did not think Time would help me to him or through
him, till I carne to Shiráz.

'Now one day, while I was in my chamber, <span
id="fr_784"></span>[1](#fn_784) suddenly there appeared before me an old
man, whose countenance poverty had marred, <span
id="fr_785"></span>[2](#fn_785) whose lustre Time had entirely
exhausted, whose erectness <span id="fr_786"></span>[3](#fn_786) disease
had bent, and whose nails destitution had clipped; with a face more
wretched than his actual state, and a garb more dreadful than his
condition, with dry gums and parched lips, muddy feet, with a blistered
hand, <span id="fr_787"></span>[4](#fn_787) with canine teeth that
misfortune had destroyed, and a bitter existence. And he saluted me. My
eye disdained him, but I returned his greeting. So he said: 'O God make
us better than we are suspected to be.' Therefore I smoothed out for him
the wrinkles of my face, <span id="fr_788"></span>[5](#fn_788) opened my
ear to him and said: 'Proceed <span id="fr_789"></span>[6](#fn_789) with
thy story!' Then he said: 'I have suckled thee on the breast of
covenant, and shared with thee the rein of protection <span
id="fr_790"></span>[7](#fn_790) and, in the opinion of the wise,
acquaintance is sacred and friendship is kinship.' I then said: 'Art
thou a fellow-townsman, or a fellow-tribesman?' He said: 'Nought unites
us save the land of exile, and nothing binds us together but the
relationship of neighbourhood.' Then I asked: 'Which road bound us both
with one cord?' He replied: 'The road to Yemen.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám:
So I asked: 'Art thou Abú’l Fatḥ al-Iskanderí?' He replied: 'I am that
person.' I said:

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'How thin thou art
become since parting from me, and thou hast changed beyond my
recognition; therefore lay before me thy whole case and the cause of thy
disordered condition.' He said: 'I have married a beautiful woman of
base stock, <span id="fr_791"></span>[1](#fn_791) and I am afflicted
with a daughter by her. So because of her I am in affliction, and she
has despoiled me of my living and sapped my youthful vigour.' I said:
'Why dost thou not absolutely divorce her and be at rest?' <span
id="fr_792"></span>[2](#fn_792)
