### XLVI. THE MAQAMA OF THE YELLOW

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: When I desired to return from
the Pilgrimage there carne into my presence a youth and he said: 'I have
a young man of yellow origin who invites to unbelief and dances upon the
finger. Exile has disciplined him. The desire for recompense has brought
me to thee that I might represent his case before thee. He has demanded
of thee in marriage a yellow damsel <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[2](#fn_1030) that pleaseth the company and
rejoiceth the beholders. Now, if thou dost assent, there will be
begotten of them both an offspring <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[3](#fn_1031) that will fill the regions and men's
ears. And when thou hast folded this robe <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[4](#fn_1032) and rolled up this thread <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[5](#fn_1033) it will have preceded thee into thy
country. Therefore now decide regarding the unfolding of what is in
thine hand.'

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

Said ‘Ísá Ibn Hishám: I was astonished at his narration and his
witticism in his solicitation, so I complied with his request. Then he
recited saying:--

'By the lower hand, <span id="fr_1034"></span>[1](#fn_1034) glory is
duped,  
But the hand of the generous man and his judgement are supreme.' <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[2](#fn_1035).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1030"></span>[174:2](mhm54.htm#fr_1030) *A yellow damsel:*
An allusion to Qur’án, ii, 64.

<span id="fn_1031"></span>[174:3](mhm54.htm#fr_1031) *An offspring:*
That is, praise.

<span id="fn_1032"></span>[174:4](mhm54.htm#fr_1032) *When thou hast

<span id="fn_1033"></span>[174:5](mhm54.htm#fr_1033) … It (i.e. praise)
will have preceded thee.

<span id="fn_1034"></span>[175:1](mhm54.htm#fr_1034) *By the lower
hand:* Metre, *kámil*. … The lower hand: The receiving or begging hand.
*As opposed to the supreme or superior*, i.e. the giving hand. A
tradition of the Prophet … supports the explanation given in the note.
See Musnad of Imam Ibn Ḥanbal. (Ob. 241 A.H.) vol. ii, p. 524, line 13,
vol. iii, page 402, line 14, and p. 503, line 10. Also al-Jamá al-Saghīr
with commentary by al-Zubeidī, part i, pp. 97-98, lines 20-23 and line 1
respectively. Cf. English Bible: 'It is more blessed to give than to
receive' (Acts xx. 35.). Also the line of the poet:

…

For verily thou knowest not when a suppliant comes whether he or thou
art more blessed through what thou givest him. (Al-Jamá al-Ṣaghīr, part
i, p. 97.) See note on page 40.

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[175:2](mhm54.htm#fr_1035) *But the hand of
the generous man and his judgement are supreme:* The fact of the
generous man being beguiled into giving is not to be attributed to the
weakness of his intellect. Cf. *Ḥarírí*, i, 31, on the subject of the
dinar.
