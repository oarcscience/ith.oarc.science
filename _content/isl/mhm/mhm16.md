### VIII. THE MAQAMA OF ADHARBAYJÁN

SAID ‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM: When wealth girded me with its flowing robe, I was
suspected of being possessed of property that I had stolen, or of a
treasure <span id="fr_276"></span>[5](#fn_276) that I had found, so the
darkness of the night urged me to flee, and the horse carried me away.
In my flight I traversed paths that had never been trodden before, and
where a bird could not find its way, until I passed through the land of
terror, crossed its frontiers, entered the protected domain of safety,
and there found tranquility. I arrived at Adharbayján <span
id="fr_277"></span>[6](#fn_277) and verily the camel's feet were abraded
and the

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

stages travelled had consumed their flesh. And when I reached it,

'We alighted intending the stay to be three days, <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_278)  
But it was so pleasant to us that we stopped there a month.'

Now one day while I was in one of its streets, there suddenly appeared a
man with a small drinking-vessel which he had placed under his arm, with
a walking-stick with which he supported himself, with a tall round
cap <span id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_279) which he had donned, <span
id="fr_280"></span>[3](#fn_280) and a waist-wrapper <span
id="fr_281"></span>[4](#fn_281) which he had put on. <span
id="fr_282"></span>[5](#fn_282) He raised his voice and said: 'O God who
createth things and causeth them to return again, the quickener of bones
and the destroyer of them, the Creator of the sun and who causeth it to
revolve; the Maker of the dawn to appear <span
id="fr_283"></span>[6](#fn_283) and its Illuminator, who sendeth us
bounteous benefits <span id="fr_284"></span>[7](#fn_284) and upholdeth
the heavens <span id="fr_285"></span>[8](#fn_285) that they fall not
upon us; the Creator of souls, male and female; <span
id="fr_286"></span>[9](#fn_286) who hath made the sun <span
id="fr_287"></span>[10](#fn_287) for a light, <span
id="fr_288"></span>[11](#fn_288) the firmament for a roof <span
id="fr_289"></span>[12](#fn_289) and the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

earth as a carpet; <span id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_290) who hath
ordained the night for rest <span id="fr_291"></span>[2](#fn_291) and
the day for labour; <span id="fr_292"></span>[3](#fn_292) who formeth
the pregnant clouds, <span id="fr_293"></span>[4](#fn_293) and sendeth
in vengeance the thunderbolts; <span id="fr_294"></span>[5](#fn_294) who
knoweth what is above the stars and what is beneath the uttermost parts
of the earth, I beseech Thee to send Thy blessings upon Muḥammad, the
chief of the prophets, and upon his holy family, and that Thou wilt aid
me against exile, that I may rein her round <span
id="fr_295"></span>[6](#fn_295) homeward; and against hardship that I
may be delivered from its depressing shade, and that Thou wilt make it
easy for me to obtain at the hands of one of pious nature and pure
origin, <span id="fr_296"></span>[7](#fn_296) blessed with true
religion, who is not blind to manifest truth, a camel to traverse this
road, provision to suffice me and a travelling companion.' Said ‘Ísá ibn
Hishám, I whispered to myself, 'This man is more eloquent than our
al-Iskanderí, Abú’l-Fatḥ!' Then I turned a glance upon him and lo, by
Heavens! it was Abú’l-Fatḥ! So I said: 'O Abú’l-Fatḥ! has thy mischief
reached this land and thy hunting for game extended to this tribe?' Then
he indited saying:--

'I am a mighty wanderer over the countries, <span
id="fr_297"></span>[8](#fn_297)  
And a great traverser of the horizons.  
I am the toy of time, <span id="fr_298"></span>[9](#fn_298)  
And am continually on the road. <span id="fr_299"></span>[10](#fn_299)

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

Blame me not--mayest thou receive right guidance!  
For my mendicity, but taste it.'
