<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: I lost some camels of mine and I went forth in search of them. I alighted in a verdant valley and behold there were running brooks,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_836"></A><A HREF="#fn_836"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> tall trees, ripe fruits, blossoming flowers and broad plains, and lo! an old man was seated there. Now that which terrifies a solitary person from his like made me afraid of him, but he said: 'Have no fear.' Then I saluted him and he ordered me to sit down, and I obeyed. Then he asked me concerning my condition and I informed him. Then he said to me: 'Thou hast got thy guide and found thy stray. Dost thou recite anything of the poems of the Arabs?' I answered: 'Yes,' and I recited from Imr-al-Qais, &#8216;Obeid, Lab&iacute;d, and &#7788;arafa. But he was not pleased with anything of that and he asked: 'Shall I repeat some of my poetry?' I said to him: 'Produce it.' Then he recited:</p>  
<p><DIR>'The co-partners have separated,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_837"></A><A HREF="#fn_837"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> but had I obeyed, they would not have parted.<br> And they have severed our cords from the bonds of union,'</DIR></p>

<p><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A></p>  
<p>until he went over the whole qa&#7779;&iacute;da. I said: 'O Shaikh! this is Jar&iacute;r's poem, the boys have conned it, the women know it, it has entered the tents and reached the assemblies.' He said: 'Stop this but if thou dost know a poem of Ab&uacute; N&uacute;w&aacute;s repeat it to me.' So I recited to him</p>  
<p><DIR>'I will not lament over the deserted abode,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_838"></A><A HREF="#fn_838"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Nor will I yearn after the drivers of the white camels.<br> The dwelling most worthy of abandonment is that one;<br> In which union with the beloved is not long enjoyed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_839"></A><A HREF="#fn_839"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> What a splendid night was that which is past.

<p><DIR>And both his eyeballs clad themselves with sleep from my bag.<br> Then he stretched himself on a couch which was finer to me,<br> In spite of its disordered condition, than the throne of Balq&iacute;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_843"></A><A HREF="#fn_843"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,<br> And I visited his sleeping-place before the dawn,<br> And when the sound of the church bells&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_844"></A><A HREF="#fn_844"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> indicated the morning.<br> So he asked, "Who is that?" I answered:<br> "The priest has come.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_845"></A><A HREF="#fn_845"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> And thy convent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_846"></A><A HREF="#fn_846"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> must be ministered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_847"></A><A HREF="#fn_847"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> by the priest."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_848"></A><A HREF="#fn_848"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A><br> He said: "By my life thou art a vile sort of a man."<br> But I said: 'Never!

<p>He related: 'Then he rejoiced, cried out and shouted.' So I said: 'God disfigure thee for an old man! I know not whether thou be more stupid in arrogating to thyself Jar&iacute;r's poetry, or in thy delight at the poem of Ab&uacute; N&uacute;w&aacute;s who is a libertine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_849"></A><A HREF="#fn_849"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and a vagabond.'

<p>and when thou dost meet on the road a man with a leathern bottle, who goes about in the houses, around the cooking-pots, boasts of his form and glories in his beard, say to him: "Direct me to a bound fish in a sea, slender in the waist, that stings like a wasp, and turbans with light." His father is a stone, his mother a male. Gold is his head and flame is his name, and the rest of him is tail. He acts upon clothes with &#7789;he action of the moth. In the house he is the bane of the oil, a greedy drinker never satisfied, and a glutton never sated. A bountiful giver whom none forbids; he climbs the acclivity, and his property does not decrease through generosity. What pleases him grieves thee, and what benefits thee injures him. I was going to conceal from thee my story and live with thee in comfort, but thou didst refuse, now hear the truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_850"></A><A HREF="#fn_850"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> There is not a poet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_851"></A><A HREF="#fn_851"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> but has a helper from among us.

I am the Shaikh Abd M&uacute;rrah.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_852"></A><A HREF="#fn_852"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: 'Then he vanished and I saw him not. And I went on headlong and met a man with a fly-whisk&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_853"></A><A HREF="#fn_853"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in his hand. I said to myself,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_854"></A><A HREF="#fn_854"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> "By Heavens! this is my man." So I told him what I had heard of him. Then he handed me a lamp, pointed to a dark cave in the mountain and said: "There is the cave and thou hast with thee the lamp."' He related: 'I entered it and behold I found my camels and they had taken the other direction, but I turned their heads and drove them back. Now, while I was in that situation in the wood, creeping stealthily through the thicket, lo! Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717; al-Iskander&iacute; met me with a greeting.' I said to him: 'Sirrah! what has driven thee to this place?' He answered: 'The injustice of the days in decisions, and the non-existence of generous men.' I said: 'O Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717;, give then thy command.' He said: 'Bear me</p>

<p><DIR>'My soul a ransom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_856"></A><A HREF="#fn_856"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> for the man who gave me the choice.<br> I tasked him extremely, but he was generous.<br> He scratched not his beard, he wiped not his nose and he did not cough.'</DIR></p>  
<p>Then I told him the story of the old man, whereupon he pointed to his turban and said: 'This is the fruit of his benevolence.' I exclaimed: 'O Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717;, hast thou begged from the devil? Thou art indeed a mighty mendicant.'</p>
