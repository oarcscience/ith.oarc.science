<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: While I was in the city of Peace,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> returning from the Sacred Territory,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I was swaggering along, with the swaggering of pedestrians, on the bank of the Tigris, observing those rare sights and closely examining those embellishments until, suddenly, I reached a ring of men crowding together, excitement agitating their heads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and laughter exploding&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> their cheeks. Curiosity impelled me to do what it had driven them to do, till I stood within earshot of the voice of a man without being able to see his face, because of the intensity of the thronging and the excessiveness of the crowding, and behold! it was a monkey-trainer causing his monkey to dance and making those near him to laugh. So I bounded as bounds the well-trained hound,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and went forward, after the manner of one lame, over the necks of the people. This one's shoulder throwing me in that one's stomach,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> until I made the beards of two men my carpet and sat down after much fatigue.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> And verily shame choked me with its spittle and the straitness of the place distressed me. When the monkey-trainer had finished his performance and the place of assembly divested itself of its people, I arose, and verily terror had clothed me in its garb, and I stood up that I might see his face, and lo! by Heavens! it was Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717;, al-Iskander&iacute;.
