THE MAQAMA OF KHALAF&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></h3>  
<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: When I was invested with authority over Ba&#7779;ra, and was going down thither from the Presence,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> there accompanied me on the boat a youth, as though he were health in the body. He said: 'In the sides of the world and its directions I am lost, but I can be counted equal to a thousand and I can take the place of a line. Dost thou desire to take me as a favourite,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and not seek from me any recommendation?' I said: 'What recommendation stronger than thy excellence, and what means greater than thy wisdom?</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Nay, but I will render thee the service of a friend&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and be partners with thee in easy and straitened circumstances.' So we travelled on. Now, when we reached Ba&#7779;ra, he disappeared from me for days, and, because of his absence, my endurance was straitened&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and I had no patience left, so I searched for him in the interior&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of the country till I found him. Then I asked him: 'What didst thou disapprove of and why didst thou flee?' He said: 'Verily estrangement rankles in the breast as fire is kindled in the fire-stick. If it be extinguished, it will subside&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and vanish, but, if it continue to exist, it will scatter and spread. And the vessel Will fill and overflow, if the drops fall into it consecutively; and reproach, when it is left alone, will hatch and lay.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> No snare catches the free-born like bounty, and no scourge repels him like rudeness. But, in any case, we look down from above, upon the generous with an amorous glance, and upon the ignoble with a contemptuous regard. Therefore he who meets us with a long nose,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> we will meet him with an elephant's trunk, and him who regards us askance, we will dispose of for a paltry price. Now, thou didst not plant me for thy slave to uproot me, nor didst thou buy me for thy servants to sell me. A man is known by his servants, as a book i s known by its superscription. Therefore, if their rudeness was something that thou didst command, what made it necessary? And, if thou vast not aware of it, that is most surprising.' Then He said</p>

<p>Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; Ibn Hish&aacute;m: 'Then he turned away and I followed him to conciliate him, and I ceased not to soothe him till he turned back after he had sworn, "I will not go to one whose company is bad." So I gave him the respect due to him.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_891"></A><A HREF="mhm46.htm#fr_891">148:2</A> <i>Khalaf ibn Ahmed:</i> Am&iacute;r of Sijistan (Seistan) (b. 326, died in prison A.H. 399). The date of his appointment by the Samanide ruler is not given but in 354 there is a reference to a revolt against his rule (Ibn al-Ath&iacute;r, viii, 416). In 393 Ma&#7717;m&uacute;d of Ghazna wrested Sijistan from him and sent him into honourable captivity to Juzj&aacute;n, but four years later he was detected in an attempt to incite Ilik Khan against the conqueror and was kept in close confinement in Jardiz till his death in A.H. 399. He was a great patron of letters and is said to have got together a number of learned men to make an exhaustive compilation of interpretations of the Qur&#8217;&aacute;n. The result of their labours was a work of a hundred volumes! His cruel treatment of his sons and the treacherous way he compassed the death of the Q&aacute;&#7693;&iacute; Ab&uacute; Y&uacute;suf have cast a stain upon his memory. (H. F. Ahmedroz in the <i>JRAS</i>, 1901, pp. 524-31, and Ibn al-Ath&iacute;r, ix, 113-123.)</P>
