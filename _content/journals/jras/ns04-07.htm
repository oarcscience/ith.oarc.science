<BLOCKQUOTE>ART. VII.--<I>Khuddaka P&aacute;.tha, a P&aacute;li Text, with a Translation and Notes.</I> By R. C. CHILDERS, late of the Ceylon Civil Service.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="center"><SMALL>[Received February 15, 1869.]</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Khuddaka P&aacute;.tha, or "Lesser Readings," is one of the books of the Buddhist Scriptures. It is the first of the fifteen divisions of Khuddaka Nik&aacute;ya, and immediately precedes Dhammapada. The text which I have adopted is that of a manuscript written and collated for me by a Singhalese priest of great learning. I have compared with it the Burmese manuscript belonging to the collection presented by Sir A. Phayre to the India Office Library. This, however, I found to contain numerous clerical and other errors, and it failed to supply me with a single corrected reading.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Khuddaka P&aacute;.tha possesses a high authority in Ceylon. It is quoted in the Commentaries of Buddhaghosa, many of the examples in Sandhi Kappa and other grammatical works are drawn from it, and seven of its nine chapters are included in the course of homilies read at the Buddhist ceremony of Pirit. Three of the s&uacute;tras, viz., Ma"ngala Sutta, Ratana Sutta, and Metta Sutta recur in Sutta Nip&aacute;ta, the fifth division of Khuddaka Nik&aacute;ya, and Paramattha Jotik&aacute;, Buddhaghosa's commentary on Sutta Nip&aacute;ta, is also looked upon as the commentary of Khuddaka P&aacute;.tha.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Khuddaka P&aacute;.tha takes its name from its first four texts, which are very brief, and are termed P&aacute;.thas in contradistinction to the S&uacute;tras, or sermons, which follow. The four P&aacute;.thas, and the Ma"ngala, Ratana and Metta S&uacute;tras, are translated by Gogerly in his version of Pirit in the "Ceylon Friend" (June, July, and August, 1839).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{1.} Thus I have heard. On a certain day dwelt Buddha at &Ccedil;ravasti, at the Jetavana monastery, in the garden of An&aacute;thapi.n.daka. And when the night was far advanced a certain radiant celestial being, illuminating the whole of Jetavana, approached the Blessed One, and saluted him and stood aside.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{10.} For weeping and sorrow and all manner of lamentation are of no avail, if their relatives stand thus sorrowing it benefits not the dead.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{1.} A man buries a treasure in a deep pit, reasoning thus within himself, "When occasion arises this treasure will be of use to me,--{2.} if I am accused by the king, or plundered by robbers, or for release from debt, or in famine or in misfortune." Such are the reasons for which men conceal what in this world is called treasure.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{3.} Meanwhile all this treasure, lying day after day concealed in a deep pit, profits him nothing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{4.} Either the treasure vanishes from its resting place, or its owner's sense becomes distracted with care, or N&aacute;gas remove it,{5.} or malignant spirits convey it away, or his enemies or his kinsmen dig it up in his absence. The treasure is gone when the merit that produced it is exhausted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{6.} There is a treasure that man or woman may possess, a treasure laid up in the heart, a treasure of charity, piety, temperance, soberness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{7.} It is found in the sacred shrine, in the priestly assembly, in the individual man, in the stranger and sojourner, in the father, the mother, the elder brother.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{8.} A treasure secure, impregnable, that cannot pass away. When a man leaves the fleeting riches of this world, this he takes with him after death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>I.</B> The Sara.n&aacute;gamana occupies in the Buddhist system a similar place to that which the Creed holds in the Christian. Koeppen says of it, "This confession of faith is among the Southern Buddhists the best known and commonest form of prayer." (Rel. des Buddha, vol. i., p. 444). In the P&uacute;ral&aacute;sasutta section of Paramattha Jotik&aacute; Buddhaghosa speaks of "this glorious hymn" as the foundation of the Three Pitakas. . . .</P>

'saliva,' si"nh&aacute;.nik&aacute; 'mucus,' lasik&aacute; 'oil that lubricates the joints,' mutta.m 'urine,' matthake matthalu"nga.m 'brain.'" Gogerly translates kes&aacute;lom&aacute; by "hair," and to make up the number of thirty-two strangely renders matthake matthalu"nga.m by "the cranium, the brains."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>IV.</B> This P&aacute;.tha is a collection of ten of the classifications of technical terms so frequently met with in the Buddhist writings. The system of classification characterises the literature of the Hindus in a greater degree than that of any other people, but it is in the Buddhist philosophy that it has received its highest development. Indeed there is scarcely a branch of Buddhist teaching into which it has not been carried with an elaboration and detail perfectly astonishing. There can be little doubt that the great founder of Buddhism adopted the system of classification with the view of impressing his doctrines upon the memory of his followers, in an age when books were scarce, and reading and writing rare accomplishments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>V.</B> {V. 4.} Buddhaghosa . . . goes on to explain at some length what this "suitable" or "congenial" abode is. It may be a place where good men dwell and religion flourishes . . . . Or it may be a spot hallowed by the presence of Buddha when on earth . . . . Or it may be the "Majjhima Desa."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{V. 13.} This P&aacute;da {the second line of the couplet} contains nine syllables instead of eight, and the effect is to give strong emphasis to the sentence. Irregularities of this sort are of frequent occurence in P&aacute;li verse. Fausb&ouml;ll has collected a large number of instances of a redundant syllable (Dh. p. 440), and cases of a deficient syllable sometimes (though rarely) present themselves. Vowels are frequently lengthened or shortened to suit the exigencies of metre, and the circumstances that in P&aacute;li external Sandhi is to a very great extent optional, gives to the poetical texts an apparent roughness and want of polish from which Sanskrit verse is almost wholly free. These metrical irregularities in the Canonical books are explained from a religious point of view in the following remarkable passage from Culla Sadda N&iacute;ti:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buddha makes no account of the length or shortness of vowels in words; he delivers his doctrine in the form best suited to convey its meaning, and least likely to obscure its real nature. But some one may ask, Is the length or shortness of vowels a matter of no importance? And another may reply, Well, but if it is, how is it that the old schoolmen in their verses here and there go so far as to elide a letter altogether, for the sake of not violating the metre? The truth is that these are poetical licenses, and are called vowel changes when rhythm has to be preserved, and euphony where the metere has to be preserved. When it is necessary to observe the

niceties of metre and of rhythm, then, and then only, does Buddha observe them: and this is what I meant when I said that Buddha makes no account of the length or shortenss of vowels. And when he adheres to metre and rhythm he does so not as poets and men of letters do, because it is part of their profession to do it; but of the words which in the countless ages of his probation proceeded from the lotus of his blessed mouth, formed in accordance with his perfect literary knowledge, some are intended to preserve metre and rhythm, others are not so intended, and it is in the case of the former alone that he preserves metrical and rhetorical accuracy. For be it known that Buddha does not preserve the niceties of metre and rhythm out of a spirit of rivalry with others. If this work is written with the syllabic irregularity which characterises all our religious books, let me not be blamed on that account. For what says one of our commentaries:--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our sovereign lord has declared salvation<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be in the spirit and not in the letter.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore let not the wise man delight in letters and syllables,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let him fix his mind upon the sense."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To preserve the meaning all this has been said:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore let the wise man hold fast the meaning and make light of the letter."</P>

intended is "praised by the good" and that eight men only are spoken of (viz. Magga.t.th&aacute; and Phala.t.th&aacute; in the four paths), but taking advantage of the fact that Sata.m also means "a hundred," Buddhaghosa observes that Puggal&aacute; a.t.tha sata.m pasatth&aacute; may also be translated "a hundred and eight praised individuals." This number is obtained by adding up the sub-divisions of the four paths (ekab&iacute;j&iacute;, kola"nkolo, etc.).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<I>There are eight orders of men</I> . . . .} I have paraphrased this passage to make it read intelligibly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Khuddakap&aacute;.thappakara.na.m. The meaning of this title is, "The book which contains the short readings." Compare Khuddakanik&aacute;ya, which means not "the short collection," but "the collection of short books," viz. Khuddakap&aacute;.tha, Dhammapada, etc. D&iacute;ghanik&aacute;ya means "the collection of long Sutras," as appears from the fifth verse of Buddhaghosa's introduction to Brahmaj&aacute;la Sutta A.t.thakath&aacute;:--"The noble Long Collection, distinguished by its long discourses, of subtle meaning, praised by Buddha and his apostles, and possessed of the qualities that sustain faith."</P>
