<P ALIGN="center">ART. III.--<I>A Collection of Kammav&acirc;c&acirc;s</I>. By HERBERT BAYNES, M.R.A.S.</P>

<P>HAVING recently received from Mandalay through the kindness of an uncle, several interesting and important Buddhist MSS. in P&acirc;li, Burmese and Shan, I venture to lay before the Society a Collection of Kammav&acirc;c&acirc;s, some of which, though known to European scholars, have hitherto remained inedited.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Manuscript is a very handsome copy of the Kammav&acirc;c&acirc;"m in Burmese Ritual, or 'tamarind-seed' letters painted with a thick black resinous gum on 16 leaves of royal discarded pasohs, each leaf containing 6 lines each side.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It begins with the Upasampad&acirc; or Buddhist Ordination Service, which is perhaps the best known of all the Kammav&acirc;c&acirc;s, having been edited by Spiegel in 1841, by Dickson in 1881, and by Frankfurter in 1883. Then follow eight others, namely:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Ka.thinadussa.m uppanna.m, 'the Bestowment of the Ka.thina Robe.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Tic&icirc;varena avippav&acirc;sa, 'the Investiture of a Bhikkhu with the three Robes.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. S&icirc;m&acirc;-sammannit&acirc; sam&acirc;na-samv&acirc;s&acirc; ekuposath&acirc;, 'the fixing of a Boundary for the Performance of the Uposath&acirc;.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Thera-Sammuti, 'the Election of an Elder.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. N&acirc;ma-Sammuti, 'naming a Bhikkhu.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Vih&acirc;ra-kappiyabh&ucirc;mi-Sammuti, 'the Dedication of a Vih&acirc;ra.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Ku.tivatthu-Sammuti, 'fixing a Site for a Bhikkhu's Residence.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Nissaya-mutta-Sammuti, 'Consent to a Release from Nissaya.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first seven are given by Dr. Frankfurter in his <I>Handbook of P&acirc;li</I>, but whilst in his MS. the Bestowment of the Ka.thina Robe comes <I>fourth</I> in the series, in mine it occupies the <I>second</I> place. So far as I know, the eighth and ninth Kammav&acirc;c&acirc;s have never been published. They are as follows:--</P>

<P ALIGN="center">VIII.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Venerable Assembly hear me! A certain Bhikkhu, at his own instance, is about to build a house, not by the direction of others, for himself to live in. So he asks the Sa.mgha to inspect the site. If it seem meet to the Sa.mgha, let it appoint such and such Bhikkhus to inspect the site of the house with the said Bhikkhu. This is the motion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venerable Sirs, let the Brotherhood hear me! A certain Bhikkhu, at his own instance, and not by the direction of others, is about to build a house to live in. So he asks the Sa.mgha to inspect the site. The Sa.mgha appoints such and such Bhikkhus to inspect the site for the house with the said Bhikkhu.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whosoever is in favour of appointing such and such of the Bhikkhus to inspect the site with the said Bhikkhu, let him be silent; whosoever does not approve, let him speak.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such and such Bhikkhus have been elected by the Sa.mgha to inspect the site of the house with the said Bhikkhu. By its silence the Sa.mgha approves; thus I understand it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connexion with this Act of the Buddhist Chapter it is well to remember the following instructions given in the P&acirc;timokkha (iv. 6):--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any Bhikkhu, at his own instance, and not by the direction of others, should get a house built for himself to live in, he must have it built of the following dimensions. The length twelve spans of the span of Buddha, the breadth inside seven such spans. He must assemble the priests to lay out the site. The site must be laid out by them so as to do no damage [i.e. so as not to destroy white ants' nests or the abodes of other living things], and, so as to have a clear space round it sufficient for a cart drawn by a yoke of oxen to pass. If any Bhikkhu, at his own instance, gets a house built on a site where life will be destroyed, and which has not sufficient space around, or if he fails to assemble the Bhikkhus to lay out the site, or if he exceed the limits (named above), he is guilty of an offence involving temporary separation from the Brotherhood.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deing desirous, Venerable Sirs, of your consent to a release from Nissaya, I hereby ask the Sa.mgha, formally, for such release. [This should be asked a second and a third time.]</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venerable Sirs, may the Brotherhood hear me! If it seem meet to the Sa.mgha, let it consent to the said Bhikkhu's being released from Nissaya. This is the motion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Venerable Assembly hear me! The Sa.mgha consents to the said Bhikkhu's release from Nisaya. Whosoever is in favour of the motion, let him be silent; whosoever does not approve, let him speak.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release has been granted to the said Bhikkhu by the Sa.mgha. By its silence the Sa.mgha approves; thus I understand.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second MS. consists of 58 Talipat leaves of 5 lines in characters which are midway between Burmese and Kambodian. Like the first it begins with the <I>Upasampad&acirc;</I>. Then comes what may be called the Act of the Chapter with regard to Bhikkhus who have committed offences involving temporary separation from the Fraternity. We have, in fact, to deal with those questions of Probation, Penance and Rehabilitation which are discussed in the first three <I>Khandhakas</I> of the <I>Cullavagga</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venerable Sirs, I have been guilty of many Sa.mgh&acirc;dises&acirc; offences, but I am not aware of the degree of the offences and am unaware of the duration of the times. I do not remember the degree of the offences, nor do I remember the duration of the times. I am uncertain as to the degree of the offences and as to the duration of the times. So I ask the Venerable Assembly for a probation of Complete Purification on account of these offences.</P>

He does not recollect either, and is, indeed, uncertain as to both. So he asks the Sa.mgha for a probation of Complete Purification on account of these offences. And the Sa.mgha accordingly imposes such probation upon this Bhikkhu. Whosoever is in favour of granting to this Bhikkhu a probation of Complete Purification on account
