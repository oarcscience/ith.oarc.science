<BLOCKQUOTE>ART. XXIV.--<I>Sansk.rit Text of the &#352;iksh&acirc;-Patr&icirc; of the Sv&acirc;mi-N&acirc;r&acirc;ya.na Sect</I>. Edited by Professor MONIER WILLIAMS, C.I.E., D.C.L.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>[THE text of the &#352;iksh&acirc;-Patr&icirc; of the modern Vaish.nava Sect, called Sv&acirc;mi-N&acirc;r&acirc;ya.na, was lithographed in Samvat 1928 (A.D. 1872) by order of the Heads of the Sect. It has a Gujar&acirc;t&icirc; Commentary by Nity&acirc;nanda-muni. So far as I know, this is the only version of the text that has yet appeared. It was given to me by the Wart&acirc;l Mah&acirc;r&acirc;ja on the occasion of my first visit to Wart&acirc;l in 1875. It is full of mistakes, and in preparing the following edition of the text I have taken as my guide the far more accurate manuscript and Sansk.rit commentary written by Pa.n.dit &#352;at&acirc;nanda-muni, and given to me by the Mah&acirc;r&acirc;ja on the same occasion.]</P>

<P ALIGN="center">TRANSLATION OF THE FOREGOING &#352;IKSH&Acirc;-PATR&Icirc;.<BR> BY PROFESSOR MONIER WILLIAMS.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In making the following translation I have been careful to study the Sansk.rit commentary called Artha-d&icirc;pik&acirc;, written for me in clear beautiful characters by Pa.n.dit &#352;at&acirc;nanda-muni (one of the disciples of Sv&acirc;mi-N&acirc;r&acirc;ya.na), by order of the Wart&acirc;l Mah&acirc;r&acirc;ja, after one of the formal visits to the Wart&acirc;l Temple, which were kindly arranged for me by Mr. Frederick Sheppard, C.S., late Collector of Kaira, and now Commissioner. The translation is the first ever made by any European scholar, though it is right I should mention that I have consulted a fairly accurate version (not always perfect either in its renderings or its English) written by She.th Bhogil&acirc;l Pr&acirc;nj&icirc;vand&acirc;s, of the Bombay Education Society's Institution, Ahmedabad, and given in Mr. H. C. Briggs' work, "The Cities of Gujar&acirc;sh.tra." I have also received assistance from my friend Pa.n.dit Shy&acirc;maj&icirc; K.rish.na-varm&acirc;, of Balliol College, Oxford.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. I meditate in my heart on that K.rish.na on whose left side is seated R&acirc;dh&acirc;, on whose breast reclines &#352;r&icirc; (Lakshm&icirc;), and who enjoyed sport (with them) in V.rind&acirc;vana.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. I, Sahaj&acirc;nanda.h Sv&acirc;m&icirc; (afterwards called Sv&acirc;m&icirc;-N&acirc;r&acirc;ya.na), living at V.ritt&acirc;laya, write this Letter of instructions (or Book of directions) to all my followers scattered throughout various countries.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_3"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT>. Let the two youths named Ayodhy&acirc;-pras&acirc;da and Raghu-v&icirc;ra, the sons of my two brothers, R&acirc;ma-prat&acirc;pa and I&ccedil;&ccedil;h&acirc;-r&acirc;ma, who were the children of Dharma (or Hari-pras&acirc;da);</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_4"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT>. And let those Naish.thika Brahma&ccedil;&acirc;r&icirc;s (that is to say, those Brahmans who continue Brahma-&ccedil;&acirc;r&icirc;s or celibates all

their lives), the chief among whom is Mukund&acirc;nanda, and those G.rihasthas (householders), such as May&acirc;r&acirc;ma-Bha.t.ta, and other of my followers;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_5"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>5</FONT>. And let those women, whether wives or widows, who have become my disciples, and the whole number of holy men (S&acirc;dhus), such as Mukt&acirc;nanda and others;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_6"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>6</FONT>. Let all these (persons) constantly give heed to my prayers for their perpetual continuance in their own proper duties--(my prayers) offered up with repetition of the name K.rish.na (N&acirc;r&acirc;ya.na), and in accordance with the sacred scriptures. (Literally--Let my benedictory words which keep them in their own duties be always read by all these persons accompanied by repetition of the name of K.rish.na, and approved by the &#352;&acirc;stras.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_7"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>7</FONT>. Let this Letter of directions, which has important objects (to be hereafter enumerated), and which promotes the welfare of all living beings, be studied with perfect concentration of mind by all these (persons).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_8"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>8</FONT>. Those (virtuous) persons who conform to the good usages enjoined by the sacred &#352;&acirc;stras will always enjoy great happiness both in this world and in that which is to come.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_9"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>9</FONT>. But those evil-minded persons who wilfully transgress such (good usages) will certainly suffer great misery in this world as well as in the next.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_10"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>10</FONT>. Therefore let all of you who are my disciples always remain careful and well-contented in the observance of this (Book of directions).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_11"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>11</FONT>. Let no followers of mine ever intentionally kill any living thing whatever--not even a louse, flea, or the most minute insect.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_12"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>12</FONT>. The killing of any animal such as a goat, etc., for the purpose of sacrificing to the Gods and Pit.ris, must not be practised; because it is declared, that abstinence from injury to others is the highest of all duties.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_13"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>13</FONT>. The killing of any human being in any way, at any place, for any object, (even) for the sake of acquiring a wife, wealth, or political supremacy, is wholly prohibited.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_14"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>14</FONT>. Suicide at a sacred place of pilgrimage, or from passion, either by hanging, or by poison in consequence of the commission of a criminal act,<A NAME="page_752_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_752_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> is prohibited.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_15"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>15</FONT>. Flesh meat should never be eaten, not even that which remains of a sacrifice. Spirituous liquor of any kind should never be drunk, not even that presented to the Gods.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_16"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>16</FONT>. If an unlawful act has been committed anywhere by one's self or any other person, no member either of one's own or any other person's body should be on that account mutilated with a weapon of any kind through anger.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_17"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>17</FONT>. All theft is prohibited, even that which is committed under pretence of contributing to religious purposes; nor must such things as wood and flowers that have an owner ever be abstracted without his permission.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_18"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>18</FONT>. Let no male or female followers of mine ever commit adultery. Let them shun gaming and similar vices, and abstain from all intoxicating liquors and substances such as hemp, etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_19"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>19</FONT>. Nowhere--except in Jagann&acirc;tha-pur&icirc;--let a man accept water or food which has been cooked by one from whom food is not to be taken (<I>i.e.</I> from a person of low caste), even though that food may have formed the Pras&acirc;da<A NAME="page_752_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_752_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> of K.rish.na (that is, the remains of what has been presented as an offering to K.rish.na).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_20"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>20</FONT>. No calumnious language must be used against any one for the sake of promoting one's own interests. No abusive words must ever be spoken.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_21"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>21</FONT>. Never use nor listen to profane language against the Gods, sacred places, Br&acirc;hmans, holy women, S&acirc;dhus and the Vedas.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_22"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>22</FONT>. The remains of the offering to that Goddess to whom flesh and liquor are offered and in whose presence the killing of goats, etc., takes place, are not to be eaten.</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_23"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>23</FONT>. If you happen on the road to see before you a temple of &#352;iva or any other God, having first made a salutation, respectfully enter inside to view the image.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_24"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>24</FONT>. Let no one abandon the duties of the class and order to which he belongs, nor practise the religious duties of others; nor have anything to do with those propounded by heretical teachers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_25"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>25</FONT>. The narrative of the exploits of the Lord K.rish.na should not be heard from the mouth of any person whose words lead one to fall from his worship or from duty.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_26"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>26</FONT>. Never tell a truth which is likely to cause serious injury to yourself or to any one else. Avoid associating with ungrateful persons. Never accept a bribe from any person whatever.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_27"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>27</FONT>. Never associate with thieves, wicked or vicious persons, heretics, people who are in love, and people who are engaged in dishonest occupations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_28"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>28</FONT>. Never associate with those who, through eager desire to obtain a wife, wealth or some sensual gratification, practise sinful acts under pretext of devotion to religion or to sacred knowledge.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_29"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>29</FONT>. Never pay attention to those books in which K.rish.na and his incarnations are impugned by controversial arguments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_30"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>30</FONT>. No unstrained water or milk should be drunk, nor should water containing minute insects be used for such purposes as bathing, etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_31"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>31</FONT>. Never take medicine which is mixed with spirituous liquor or flesh meat; or which has been prescribed by a physician whose character is unknown.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_32"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>32</FONT>. Never allow bodily excretions or evacuations or saliva to fall in places prohibited by the &#352;&acirc;stras or by public custom.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_33"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>33</FONT>. Never enter or leave (a house) by a side entrance (or private door); never take up your residence at a place belonging to another person, without asking the owner's permission.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_34"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>34</FONT>. Males ought not to listen to (discourses on) religious

knowledge, or to tales (about the exploits of heroes) from the mouths of women,<A NAME="page_754_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_754_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> nor ought they to carry on controversial discussions with females; nor with a king or his officials.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_35"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>35</FONT>. Never speak disrespectfully of religious preceptors, of superiors, of those who have gained renown in the world, of learned men, and of those that carry arms.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_36"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>36</FONT>. Never do any act rashly; nor be slow in a religious duty. Impart to others the knowledge you may receive, and daily associate with holy men.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_37"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>37</FONT>. Do not go empty-handed to pay a visit to a religious preceptor, a god or a king. Never betray a trust or violate confidence. Never praise yourself with your own lips.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_38"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>38</FONT>. The clothing of my followers should not be of such an improper kind that, when put on, the limbs are exposed to view.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_39"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>39</FONT>. The worship of K.rish.na must not be performed without attending to religious duties. Adoration of K.rish.na should not be abandoned through fear of the reproaches of ignorant people.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_40"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>40</FONT>. On religious festivals and on ordinary days, the males and females that go to K.rish.na's temple should keep separate and not touch each other.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_41"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>41</FONT>. Those twice-born persons who have received initiation into the worship of K.rish.na from a duly qualified religious teacher should always wear on their necks two rosaries made of Tuls&icirc; wood (one for R&acirc;dh&acirc; and another for K.rish.na), and should make an upright mark on their foreheads.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_42"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>42</FONT>. This mark should be made with Gop&icirc;-&ccedil;andana (<I>i.e.</I> white earth from Dv&acirc;rik&acirc;), or with sandal which is left from that employed in the worship of Hari (K.rish.na), and mixed with saffron.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_43"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>43</FONT>. Within this (erect mark) there ought to be made a round (v.ritta) mark with the materials (or earth) used for the Pu.n.dra, or with saffron which has served for the

<!------------------------page 755------------------------>

<A NAME="page_755"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 755</FONT></A>

Pras&acirc;da of R&acirc;dh&acirc; and K.rish.na (that is, with a portion left from that employed in their worship).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_44"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>44</FONT>. Those pure &#352;&ucirc;dras who are worshippers of K.rish.na, while practising their own peculiar duties, should, like the twice-born, use a rosary and a vertical mark on the forehead.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_45"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>45</FONT>. By those (&#352;&ucirc;dra) worshippers who are different from the pure &#352;&ucirc;dras two rosaries made of sandal wood, etc., are to be worn on the throat, and only a round mark is to be made on the forehead.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_46"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>46</FONT>. Those twice-born of my followers, who have inherited from their forefathers the custom of using a rosary of Rudr&acirc;ksha berries (sacred to &#352;iva), and the three horizontal (&#352;aiva) marks, should not discontinue that practice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_47"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>47</FONT>. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya.na and &#352;iva should be equally regarded as manifestations of one and the same Universal Spirit, since both have been declared in the Vedas to be forms of Brahma.<A NAME="page_755_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_755_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_48"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>48</FONT>. In times of slight distress my adherents shall not chiefly (or by preference) follow the laws which are laid down by the &#352;&acirc;stras for times of (excessive) distress.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_49"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>49</FONT>. Every day let every man awake before sunrise, and after calling on the name of K.rish.na, proceed to the rites of bodily purification.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_50"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>50</FONT>. Having seated himself in some place apart, let him cleanse his teeth, and then, having bathed with pure water, put on two well-washed garments (an under and an upper).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_51"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>51</FONT>. Then having seated himself on a clean and single (asa.mk&icirc;r.na) seat placed on ground purified (with cow-dung, etc.), let a man sip water with his face either to the east or north.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_52"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>52</FONT>. My male followers should then make the vertical mark with the round spot in it on their foreheads, and wives should only make a circular mark with red powder (of saffron).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_53"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>53</FONT>. A widow is prohibited from making either a vertical

<!------------------------page 756------------------------>

<A NAME="page_756"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 756</FONT></A>

or round mark on her forehead. In the next place all my followers ought to engage in the mental worship of K.rish.na.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_54"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>54</FONT>. After engaging in mental worship, let them bow down before the pictures of R&acirc;dh&acirc; and K.rish.na, and repeat the eight-syllabled prayer to K.rish.na (that is--the formula meaning 'K.rish.na is my refuge') as many times as possible. After that they may apply themselves to their secular affairs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_55"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>55</FONT>. All my ordinary disciples should perform the preceding rules; but those who like Ambar&icirc;sha have dedicated their whole souls (to the Deity) should be most particular in performing the duties ending with mental worship in the order enumerated (in the preceding six verses as well as the following):--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_56"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>56</FONT>. (Such devoted persons) should also then worship an image made of either stone or metal, and the black stone called &#352;&acirc;la-gr&acirc;ma (representing Vish.nu), with the (sixteen) offerings (of sandal, etc.), such as are procurable, and the eight-syllabled mantra of K.rish.na should be repeated (manu = mantra).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_57"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>57</FONT>. Next (in order to the performance of brahma-yaj"na) the hymn celebrating the praises of K.rish.na should be recited according to ability, and those that have not studied Sansk.rit should at least repeat his name.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_58"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>58</FONT>. All who have devoted themselves (in this way) to the worship of K.rish.na, should next present an offering (of cooked food) to him, and then they should eat the remains of the offering (pr&acirc;s&acirc;dikam). They should at all times be full of joy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_59"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>59</FONT>. Since they are called the passionless (nirgu.na) worshippers of the passionless K.rish.na, therefore, in consequence of that, all their acts are also (called) passionless (nirgu.na).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_60"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>60</FONT>. By these devoted (worshippers) indeed no water should be drunk, nor should any leaves, roots or fruits anywhere be eaten which have not been presented to K.rish.na.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_61"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>61</FONT>. All those who from old age or some grievous calamity are unable (to perform worship) should make over the (image 

<!------------------------page 757------------------------>

<A NAME="page_757"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 757</FONT></A>

or &#352;ala-gr&acirc;ma stone) of K.rish.na to the charge of some other devotee (able to carry on the proper services), and should themselves act to the best of their ability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_62"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>62</FONT>. An image (or &#352;&acirc;la-gr&acirc;ma) of K.rish.na, given by a religious leader (<I>&acirc;&ccedil;&acirc;rya</I>), or consecrated by him, should be worshipped, but to other images it is sufficient to make obeisance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_63"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>63</FONT>. Every day all my followers should go to the temple of God in the evening, and there loudly repeat the names of the lord of R&acirc;dhik&acirc;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_64"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>64</FONT>. The story of his exploits should be related as well as heard with the greatest reverence, and on festivals hymns in praise of K.rish.na should be sung accompanied by musical instruments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_65"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>65</FONT>. In this manner all my followers should every day perform religious duties. Moreover, they should study works both in Sansk.rit and in the popular dialects, according to their mental abilities.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_66"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>66</FONT>. Whatever individual is appointed to any office, he should be so appointed with strict regard to his qualifications, after due consideration, and never in any other way.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_67"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>67</FONT>. Let every one always provide his own servants with food and clothing in the most suitable manner, and according to his own pecuniary means.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_68"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>68</FONT>. In conversation every person should be addressed conformably to his character (or qualities), and suitably to time and place, and not in any other manner.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_69"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>69</FONT>. By all well-conducted persons due deference must be shown to a religious guide, a king, an elder, an ascetic, a learned man, and one that practises austerities, by rising from the seat and so forth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_70"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>70</FONT>. No man should sit down on the ground in the presence of a religious preceptor, a god, or king, or in a (solemn) assembly, in such a (disrespectful) attitude as to make one foot rest on the thigh, or with a cloth tied round the (waist and) knees.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_71"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>71</FONT>. A controversial discussion should never be carried on with a religious teacher (<I>&acirc;&ccedil;&acirc;rya</I>). He is to be honoured 

<!------------------------page 758------------------------>

<A NAME="page_758"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 758</FONT></A>

with gifts of food, money, clothes, and with all other things according to ability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_72"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>72</FONT>. When any of my disciples hear of his arrival, they should immediately show their respect by advancing to meet him, and when he departs, they should accompany him as far as the confines of the village.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_73"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>73</FONT>. If an act, attended with large recompense, be opposed to religious duty, that act ought not to be committed; for religious duty (when performed) confers all desired objects.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_74"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>74</FONT>. An unrighteous act that may have been committed by great persons in former times must never be held (worthy of imitation); but their virtuous conduct only is to be imitated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_75"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>75</FONT>. Let not the secrets of any one be ever anywhere divulged, the neglect (vyatikrama) of proper respect (for those deserving of reverence) should never be made, (as if all were to be looked at) with an equal eye (of esteem).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_76"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>76</FONT>. All my disciples should practise special religious observances during the four special months (beginning with &Acirc;sh&acirc;.dha). But those who are sickly need only practise the same in the one month of &#352;r&acirc;va.na only.</P>

Reading and listening to the exploits of Vish.nu, singing his praises, solemn worship, repetition of his mantra ("Great K.rish.na is my refuge"), recitation of the hymn of praise (<I>i.e.</I> of the thousand names of Vish.nu), reverential circumambulations (from left to right with the right side towards the object adored),</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_78"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>78</FONT>. Prostration with the eight members (of the body) these are considered the best religious observances; any one of these ought to be performed with special devotion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_79"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>79</FONT>. The fasts of all the eleventh days (of the waxing and waning moon) should be carefully observed; also of the birthdays of K.rish.na; and of the night of &#352;iva (<I>&#352;iva-r&acirc;tri</I>) with rejoicings during the day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_80"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>80</FONT>. On a fast-day sleeping by day should most carefully be avoided, since by such sleep the merit of fasting is lost to men, quite as much as by sexual intercourse.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_82"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>82</FONT>. Having conformed to that order, all religious fasts and festivals should be observed accordingly; and the form of worshipping K.rish.na directed by him (Vi.th.thale&#353;a) should be adopted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_83"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>83</FONT>.

Vish.nu, &#352;iva, Ga.na-pati (Ga.ne&#353;a), P&acirc;rvat&icirc;, and the Sun, these five deities should be honoured with worship by my followers.<A NAME="page_759_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_759_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_86"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>86</FONT>. On the occurrence of eclipses of the sun and moon, all my followers should immediately suspend their other business, and, having purified themselves, should make repetition of the (eight-syllabled) mantra of K.rish.na.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_87"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>87</FONT>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_96"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>96</FONT>. All my twice-born disciples who wish good to themselves should recite these sacred books and hear them recited.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_97"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>97</FONT>. In deciding questions of ancient usage (&acirc;&ccedil;&acirc;ra), or practice, or penance, the code of Y&acirc;j"navalkya, with its commentary the Mit&acirc;kshar&acirc;, should be taken (as the best authority).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_98"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>98</FONT>. The tenth and fifth books of the Bh&acirc;gavata Pur&acirc;.na are to be regarded as having the preeminence over all the

<A NAME="page_761"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 761</FONT></A>

other sacred books for the understanding of the glory of K.rish.na.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_99"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>99</FONT>. The tenth and fifth books of the Bh&acirc;gavata Pur&acirc;.na and the code of Y&acirc;j"navalkya are respectively my Bhakti-&#353;&acirc;stra (manual of faith), Yoga-&#353;&acirc;stra (manual of devotion), and Dharma-&#353;&acirc;stra (manual of law).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_100"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>100</FONT>. As a treatise on the soul, the commentary on the Bhagavad-G&icirc;t&acirc; as well as that on the &#352;&acirc;r&icirc;raka-S&ucirc;tras of Vy&acirc;sa, made by R&acirc;m&acirc;nuj&acirc;&ccedil;&acirc;rya, commends itself to my approval.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_101"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>101</FONT>. Whatever precepts in these sacred books have for their subject the excessive exaltation of K.rish.na and of Justice (V.risha), of faith and of indifference to the world--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_102"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>102</FONT>. Such precepts should be regarded as taking precedence over all others. Their essential doctrine is that devotion to K.rish.na should be joined with the performance of duty.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_103"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>103</FONT>. Duty (<I>dharma</I>) is that good practice which is enjoined both by the Veda (&#352;ruti) and by the law (Sm.riti) founded on the Veda. Devotion (<I>bhakti</I>) is intense love for K.rish.na, accompanied with a due sense of his glory.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_104"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>104</FONT>. Indifference to worldly objects means absence of satisfaction in any object except K.rish.na. True knowledge consists in discriminating rightly between the nature of the personal soul (jiva), of the external world (M&acirc;y&acirc;), and of the Supreme Being (&Icirc;&#353;a).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_105"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>105</FONT>. The personal soul dwells in the heart. It is as subtle as an atom; it is all thought; it has the faculty of knowledge; it is ascertained to be constantly pervading the whole body (<I>i.e.</I> the three corporeal envelopes k&acirc;ra.na, s&ucirc;kshma, and sth&ucirc;la) by its power of perception; it is characterized by indivisibility and the like.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_106"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>106</FONT>. The external world (M&acirc;y&acirc;) is identical with the energizing power of K.rish.na. It is composed of the three Gu.nas; it is darkness; it is to be understood as the cause of the soul's having such ideas in regard to the body, and the things relating to the body, as are conveyed by the expressions I, mine, and the like.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_107"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>107</FONT>. He who abides in the living personal soul in the 

<!------------------------page 762------------------------>

<A NAME="page_762"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 762</FONT></A>

character of an internal monitor, as the personal soul dwells in the heart, he is to be considered as the Self-existent Supreme Being, the Rewarder of all actions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_108"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>108</FONT>. That Being, known by various names--such as the glorious K.rish.na, Param Brahma, Bhagav&acirc;n, Purushottama.h--the cause of all manifestations, is to be adored by us as our one chosen deity.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_109"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>109</FONT>. He, together with R&acirc;dh&acirc;, should be regarded as the Supreme Lord, under the name of R&acirc;dh&acirc;-K.rish.na. With Rukmi.n&icirc; and Ram&acirc; he is known as Lakshm&icirc;-N&acirc;r&acirc;ya.na.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_110"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>110</FONT>. When joined with Arjuna, he is known by the name of Nara-N&acirc;r&acirc;ya.na; when associated with Bala-bhadra ( = Bala-r&acirc;ma), or any other divine personage, he is called Ram&acirc;-K.rish.na and so on.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_111"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>111</FONT>. Those devoted (female companions of the god) R&acirc;dh&acirc; and his other (consorts) are in some places represented at his side. In other places (their images do not appear, because) they are supposed to be one with his body and he with theirs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_112"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>112</FONT>. On no account let it be supposed that difference in forms makes any difference in the identity of the deity. For the two-armed K.rish.na may exhibit himself with four arms (or eight, or a thousand, or any number of arms).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_113"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>113</FONT>. Towards him alone ought all faith and worship (bhakti) to be directed by every human being on earth in every possible manner. Nothing else, except such (faith), is able to procure salvation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_114"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>114</FONT>. The best result of the virtues of those who possess good qualities is faith in K.rish.na and association with holy men; without these, even persons who know (the &#352;&acirc;stras) go downwards (towards a lower state).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_115"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>115</FONT>. Meditation should be directed towards K.rish.na, his incarnations and their images, but not towards living men, nor (inferior) gods, etc., nor devotees, nor (even) those who (merely) have knowledge of Brahma.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_116"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>116</FONT>. Having perceived, by abstract meditation, that the Spirit or Self is distinct from its three bodies (viz. the gross, subtle and causal bodies), and that it is a portion of the one 

<!------------------------page 763------------------------>

<A NAME="page_763"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 763</FONT></A>

Spirit of the Universe (Brahma), every man ought to worship K.rish.na by means of that (self) at all times.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_117"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>117</FONT>. The tenth book of the Bh&acirc;gavata-Pur&acirc;.na should be listened to reverentially, and learned men should read it daily or (if frequent reading is impossible, at least) once a year.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_118"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>118</FONT>. The repetition (of the Bh&acirc;gavata), as well as of the thousand names of Vish.nu, etc., should be performed as far as possible in a pure place (such as the precincts of a temple); for (such repetition) causes the accomplishment of desired objects.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_119"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>119</FONT>. On the occurrenee of any disaster caused by the elements (such as a flood or fire), or when any human calamity or sickness takes place, a man should be wholly occupied in striving to preserve himself and other people and in nothing else.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_120"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>120</FONT>. Religious usages, business transactions and penances, should be adapted to country, time, age, property, rank and ability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_121"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>121</FONT>. The (philosophical) doctrine approved by me is the Vi&#353;ish.t&acirc;dvaita (of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja),<A NAME="page_763_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_763_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and the desired heavenly abode is Goloka. There to worship K.rish.na, and be united with him as the Supreme Soul of the Universe, is to be considered salvation (Mukti).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_122"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>122</FONT>. These that have been specified are the general duties, applicable to all my followers, whether male or female. Now I am about to enumerate the special duties.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_123"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>123</FONT>. The two sons of my elder and younger brothers (viz. Ayodhy&acirc;-pras&acirc;da and Raghu-v&icirc;ra) ought never to impart instruction to any women except their nearest relations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_124"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>124</FONT>. They ought never to touch or converse with any women in any place whatever. Cruelty should never be shown towards any person. A deposit belonging to another should never be taken charge of.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_125"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>125</FONT>. In business matters no one should stand security for

<!------------------------page 764------------------------>

<A NAME="page_764"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 764</FONT></A>

any other person. In passing through a time of distress it is right to ask for alms, but debts should not be contracted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_126"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>126</FONT>. One should not sell corn bestowed by one's own disciples; having given away old corn, new corn is to be bought. That is not called a sale.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_127"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>127</FONT>. On the fourth day of the light-half of the month Bh&acirc;dra, the worship of Ga.ne&#353;a should be performed, and on the fourteenth of the dark-half of &Acirc;&#353;vina, Hanum&acirc;n should be worshipped.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_128"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>128</FONT>. Those two sons (of my brothers, viz. Ayodhy&acirc;-pras&acirc;da and Raghu-v&icirc;ra), who have been appointed as spiritual guides to guard the religious interests of my followers, should initiate all desirous of obtaining salvation (in the use of the mantra of K.rish.na).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_129"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>129</FONT>. They should cause each of their disciples to continue steadfast in his own appointed duty. Honour should be paid to holy men, and the sacred &#352;&acirc;stras should be reverently repeated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_130"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>130</FONT>. Worship of Lakshm&icirc;-N&acirc;r&acirc;ya.na, and other forms of K.rish.na that have been set up and consecrated by me in the great temples, should be performed with the proper ceremonies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_131"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>131</FONT>. Any one who may come to the temple of K.rish.na to ask for a gift of food (cooked or uncooked) should be received with respect, and food given to him according to ability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_132"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>132</FONT>. Having established a school for giving instruction, some learned Br&acirc;hman should be appointed over it. True knowledge should be promoted throughout the world, for that is an act of great merit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_133"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>133</FONT>. The two wives of these (sons of my brothers), with the permission of their respective husbands, should initiate females only (eva) in the Mantra of K.rish.na.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_134"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>134</FONT>. They should never touch or speak to other males than their nearest relations; nor should they ever show their faces to them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_135"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>135</FONT>. My male followers who are householders should never touch widows unless they are their own near relatives.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_136"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>136</FONT>. They should not remain alone in any private place with a youthful mother, sister or daughter, except in a time of distress. Nor should a wife be given away (to another man).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_137"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>137</FONT>. No attachment should on any account be formed with a woman who in any transactions has been brought into connexion with the king of the country.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_138"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>138</FONT>. When a guest has arrived at a house, he should be honoured by those (who live in it) with food and other things according to ability. Offerings to the Gods and the Pit.ris (at the Devat&acirc;-tarpa.na and Pit.ri-tarpa.na and &#352;r&acirc;ddha ceremonies) should be made according to right usage and according to one's means.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_139"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>139</FONT>. It is the duty of my disciples, as long as they live and according to their ability, to honour with faithful attention their father, mother, spiritual preceptor, and any one affected with sickness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_140"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>140</FONT>. Every person should, according to his ability, carry on some occupation suitable to his caste and religious order. Those that live by agriculture should not allow a bull to be gelded.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_141"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>141</FONT>. Provisions and money should be laid by according to circumstances and time; and those that keep cattle should store up as much hay as these animals may need for their consumption.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_142"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>142</FONT>. If a man can himself attend to the proper feeding of cows and other animals with hay and water, then only he may keep them, otherwise he must not do so.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_143"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>143</FONT>. No business in regard to giving or receiving land or property should ever be transacted even with a son or friend, without a written deed attested by witnesses.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_144"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>144</FONT>. When any pecuniary transactions connected with giving away a girl in marriage have to be transacted for one's self or another person, the money to be delivered over should not be settled by verbal agreement, but only by a written contract attested by witnesses.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_145"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>145</FONT>. A man's expenditure ought always to be in proportion to his income. Otherwise it is certain that great misery will arise.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_146"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>146</FONT>. Every day one should take note of one's income and expenditure in the regular business of life, and write them down with one's own hand.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_147"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>147</FONT>. My followers should assign a tithe of the grain, money, etc., acquired by their own occupation or exertions, to K.rish.na, and the poor should give a twentieth part.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_148"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>148</FONT>. The due performance of fasts, of which the eleventh-day fasts are the principal, should be effected according to the &#352;&acirc;stras and one's ability; for this will lead to the attainment of desired objects.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_149"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>149</FONT>. Every year in the month &#352;r&acirc;va.na one should perform, or cause others to perform, cheerfully the worship of &#352;iva with the leaves of the Bilva-tree, etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_150"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>150</FONT>. Neither money, nor utensils, nor ornaments, nor clothes should be borrowed for use (on festive occasions) from one's own spiritual preceptor, or from the temple of K.rish.na.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_151"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>151</FONT>. While going to do homage to great K.rish.na, to a spiritual preceptor, or to a holy man, food should not be accepted from others on the road, or at the places of pilgrimage; for such food takes away religious merit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_152"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>152</FONT>. The full amount of promised wages should be paid to a workman. Payment of a debt is never to be kept secret. Let no one have any dealings with wicked men.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_153"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>153</FONT>. If through great distress caused by a famine, by enemies, or by (the oppression of) a king, any danger of destruction arises anywhere to character, wealth or life,</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_154"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>154</FONT>. The wise among my followers should at once quit even their own native country, and having gone to another, let them reside there happily.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_155"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>155</FONT>. Wealthy householders should perform those sacrifices in honour of Vish.nu which entail no killing of animals. Br&acirc;hmans and holy men (S&acirc;dhus) should be fed on festival days at sacred places of pilgrimage.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_156"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>156</FONT>. They should observe the great festivals in honour of the Deity in the temples, and should distribute various gifts among Br&acirc;hmans who are deserving objects (of generosity).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_158"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>158</FONT>.

All who are S&acirc;dhus are bound, just like those who have made a vow of perpetual celibacy, to avoid associating with women, or with men who are fond of women, and should subdue their (six) internal enemies (lust, anger, avarice, infatuation, pride, and envy).</P>

<!------------------------page 771------------------------>

<A NAME="page_771"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 771</FONT></A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_203"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>203</FONT>. Thus I have specified in a summary manner the general duties of all. Those who desire more particular instructions must refer to the sacred books handed down by tradition.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_204"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>204</FONT>. Having myself extracted the essence of an the sacred &#352;&acirc;str&acirc;s, I have written this Directory, which leads men to the attainment of desired objects.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_209"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>209</FONT>. But in the absence of a reader (vaktrabh&acirc;ve), worship should be paid to it every day, and it should be honoured with the greatest reverence as my word and my representative.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_210"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>210</FONT>. This Directory should only be given to those persons who are endowed with a nature of the divine type; never to a man possessing a nature of the demoniacal type.<A NAME="page_772_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_772_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_212"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>212</FONT>. May K.rish.na, the remover of the sufferings of his worshippers, the maintainer of devotion, accompanied with the performance of proper duties, the bestower of the desires of the heart, grant us blessings of all kinds!</P>

<P><A NAME="page_754_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_754_fr_1">1</A> This is in strict unison with the present Hind&ucirc; practice of keeping women ignorant. That women in ancient times were not only educated, but sometimes erudite and celebrated as religious teachers, is proved by the example of Maitrey&icirc;, G&acirc;rg&icirc; and others.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_755_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_755_fr_1">1</A> This precept furnishes an interesting proof of the tolerant character of Vaish.navism, and of its harmony with the pantheism of the Ved&acirc;nta.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_759_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_759_fr_1">1</A> It is evident from this verse, as from <A HREF="#pp_47">verse 47</A>, that although Vaish.navas give preferential worship to Vish.nu, they are really Pantheists in the sense of honouring other deities, as manifestations of the Supreme Being. It may be observed that although five deities are here mentioned, Ga.napati and P&acirc;rvat&icirc; are connected with &#352;iva, as the Sun is with Vish.nu.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_763_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_763_fr_1">1</A> This verse proves that in their philosophical ideas the Sv&acirc;mi-N&acirc;r&acirc;ya.na sect are followers of the R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja sect. Compare <A HREF="#pp_100">verse 100</A>.</P>
