ONCE upon earth there lived a saintly king<BR>
Named Hari&#353;chandra; pure in heart and mind,<BR>
In virtue eminent, he ruled the world,<BR>
Guarding mankind from evil. While he reigned<BR>
No famine raged, nor pain; untimely death<BR>
Ne'er cut men off; nor were the citizens<BR>
Of his fair city lawless. All their wealth,<BR>
And power, and works of righteousness, ne'er filled<BR>
Their hearts with pride; in everlasting youth<BR>
And loveliness the women passed their days.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It so fell out, that while this mighty king<BR>
Was hunting in the forest, that he heard<BR>
The sound of female voices raised in cry<BR>
Of supplication. Then he turned and said,<BR>
Leaving the deer to fly unheeded: "Stop!<BR>
Who art thou, full of tyranny and hate,<BR>
That darest thus oppress the earth; while I,<BR>
The tamer of all evil, live and rule?"<BR>
Then, too, the fierce Gane&#353;a,--he who blinds<BR>
The eyes, and foils the wills of men,--he heard<BR>
The cry, and thus within himself he thought:<BR>
"This surely is the great ascetic's work,<BR>
The mighty Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra; he whose acts<BR>
Display the fruits of penance hard and sore.<BR>
Upon the sciences he shows his power,<BR>
While they, in patience, discipline of mind,<BR>
And silence perfected, cry out with fear,<BR>
'What shall we do? The illustrious Kau&#353;ika<BR>
Is powerful; and we, compared with him,<BR>


<!------------------------page 356------------------------>

<A NAME="page_356"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 356</FONT></A>

Are feeble.' Thus they cry. What shall I do?<BR>
My mind is filled with doubt. Yet stay; a thought<BR>
Has come across me: Lo! this king who cries<BR>
Unceasingly, 'Fear not!' meeting with him,<BR>
And entering his heart, I will fulfil<BR>
All my desire." Then filled with Rudra's son--<BR>
Inspired with rage by Vigna Raj--the king<BR>
Spake up and said: "What evil doer is here,<BR>
Binding the fire on his garment's hem,<BR>
While I, his king, in power and arms renowned,<BR>
Resplendent in my glory, pass for nought?<BR>
Surely the never-ending sleep of death<BR>
Shall overtake him, and his limbs shall fail,<BR>
Smitten with darts from my far-reaching bow,<BR>
Whose fame this lower world may scarce contain."<BR>
Hearing the prince's words, the saint was filled<BR>
With wrath o'erpow'ring, and the sciences<BR>
Fell blasted in a moment at his glance.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the king beheld the pious sage<BR>
All-powerful, he quaked exceedingly,<BR>
And trembled like the sacred fig-tree's leaves.<BR>
Then Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra cried: "Stop, miscreant!"<BR>
And Hari&#353;chandra, humbly falling down<BR>
Before the saint, in accents low and meek:<BR>
"O Lord! most holy! most adorable!<BR>
Oh, blame me not! This is no fault of mine!<BR>
My duty calls," he said, "I must obey."<BR>
"Is it not written in the Holy Law,<BR>
'Alms must be given by a virtuous king;<BR>
His people must be fought for, and be kept<BR>
From every ill'?" Then Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra spoke<BR>
And said: "To whom, O king, should'st thou give alms?<BR>
For whom in battle should'st thou fight? and whom<BR>
Should'st thou protect? Oh, tell me, nor delay,<BR>
But quickly answer, if thou fearest sin."<BR>
"Alms should be given to Br&acirc;hmans," said the king:<BR>
"Those who are weak should be protected: foes<BR>
In battle should be met and overcome."<BR>


<!------------------------page 357------------------------>

<A NAME="page_357"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 357</FONT></A>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra spoke and said: "O king!<BR>
If thus indeed thou rightly dost perceive<BR>
Thy royal duty, give thine alms to me;<BR>
I am a holy Br&acirc;hman, and I seek<BR>
A dwelling-place; moreover I would gain<BR>
A wife: therefore bestow on me thine alms."<BR>
The king, his heart filled with exceeding joy,<BR>
Felt, as it were, his youth return, and said:<BR>
"Fear not! but tell me, son of Kau&#353;ika,<BR>
Thy heart's desire; and be it hard to gain,<BR>
Or be it easy, it shall still be thine.<BR>
Say, shall I give thee gold, or wealth, or life?<BR>
Or shall I give thee wife, or child, or land?<BR>
Or my prosperity itself?" "O king!"<BR>
The sage replied, "thy present I accept;<BR>
But let thine alms, I pray, be granted first,--<BR>
The offering for the kingly sacrifice."<BR>
"O Br&acirc;hman!" said the king, "the alms are thine;<BR>
Further than this, whatever be the gift<BR>
Thou mayest desire, freely I give it thee.<BR>
Ask what thou wilt." Then Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra spake:<BR>
"Give me the earth, its mountains, seas, and towns,<BR>
With all its kingdoms, chariots, horses, men;<BR>
Its elephants, its treasure-houses too;<BR>
Its treasures vast, and all whate'er beside<BR>
Is recognized as thine: oh! give me all,<BR>
I pray, except thyself, thy wife, thy son,<BR>
And this thy righteousness, that follows close<BR>
Beside thee. Sinless one! oh thou who art<BR>
Perfect in righteousness! oh give me all--<BR>
All beside these. What need of further words."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king, with heart rejoicing, and unchanged<BR>
In countenance, hearing the sage's words,<BR>
Said, humbly bowing down before the saint,<BR>
"So be thy wish fulfilled." "O saintly king,"<BR>
Said Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra, "if the world is mine,<BR>
And power, and wealth, I pray you who shall reign,<BR>
Since in this kingdom as a devotee<BR>


<!------------------------page 358------------------------>

<A NAME="page_358"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 358</FONT></A>

I dwell?" Then Hari&#353;chandra said: "'Ere this,<BR>
Before the world was thine by my free gift,<BR>
Thou wast the lord of all; how much more now?<BR>
Thy right is doubly sure." Then said the sage:<BR>
"If this indeed be so,--if the whole world<BR>
Be truly mine, and all its sovereignty,<BR>
Then should'st thou not remain, nor leave thyself<BR>
Aught of that kingdom which thou hast renounced,<BR>
But, casting off thy royal ornaments,<BR>
Thou should'st depart, clothed in a dress of bark."<BR>
The king, obedient to the sage's word,<BR>
Stripped off his royal dress, and, with his wife<BR>
And son, made haste to go. Then said the saint:<BR>
"Stop, Hari&#353;chandra! Hast thou then forgot<BR>
The offering for the kingly sacrifice<BR>
That thou hast promised us?" Replied the king:<BR>
"O mighty saint! the kingdom now is <I>thine</I>;<BR>
All have I given to <I>thee</I>: and as for me,<BR>
What have I left?--nought! save myself,<BR>
My wife, my son!" "Thou sayest the truth, indeed,"<BR>
Answered the sage; "but yet there still remains<BR>
The offering for the kingly sacrifice.<BR>
And this know well: A vow to Br&acirc;hmans made,<BR>
If unfulfilled, works special woe to him<BR>
Who made the vow. For in this sacrifice<BR>
Must offerings of worth be freely made<BR>
To Br&acirc;hmans;--offerings until they cry<BR>
Hold! that suffices for us! Therefore pay<BR>
Thy promised vow, nor longer hesitate.<BR>
'Alms are for Br&acirc;hmans,' thou thyself hast said,<BR>
'Those who are weak must be protected: foes<BR>
In battle must be met and overcome.'"<BR>
"O saintly priest!" answered the king, "my wealth<BR>
Is all departed: nothing now remains<BR>
For me to give: yet grant me time I pray,<BR>
And I will pay the offering!" "Noble king,"<BR>
Said Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra, "speak I pray thee! Say<BR>
What time dost thou appoint that I should wait?<BR>


<!------------------------page 359------------------------>

<A NAME="page_359"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 359</FONT></A>

Speak! no delay! or else my curse of fire<BR>
Shall burn thee up." Then Hari&#353;chandra said:<BR>
"Most holy Br&acirc;hman! when a month has past<BR>
The money for the offering shall be thine.<BR>
Now I have nothing. Oh! be pleased to grant<BR>
Remission for the present." Said the sage,<BR>
"Go! go! most noble prince! maintain thy faith!<BR>
And may'st thou prosper! may no enemies<BR>
Harass thy road." Commanded thus, the king<BR>
Departed as an outcast;--he, the king<BR>
Of all the earth, an exile with his wife<BR>
Unused to go afoot, and with his son<BR>
Went forth: while cries and lamentations rose<BR>
On every side: "Our hearts are filled with pain,<BR>
Why dost thou leave us thus? O virtuous king!<BR>
Show mercy to thy subjects. Righteousness<BR>
Indeed shines forth in thee; if thou art full<BR>
Of mercy, may it overflow on us.<BR>
Stay! Mighty Prince! one moment, while we gaze<BR>
With lover's eyes upon thy beauteous form.<BR>
Alas! our Prince! Shall we ne'er see thee more?<BR>
How changed thy princely state! Thou, who did'st once<BR>
Go forth, surrounded by attendant kings,<BR>
Who marched on foot; while stately elephants<BR>
Bore e'en thy ministers. Now, Lord of Kings!<BR>
Thyself art driven forth on foot. Yet, stay!<BR>
Think, Hari&#353;chandra! how wilt thou endure<BR>
The dust, the heat, the toil? Stay, mighty prince,<BR>
Nor cast thy duty off. Oh, show to us<BR>
Some mercy, for herein thy duty lies.<BR>
Behold, we cast off all for thee! Our wives,<BR>
Our wealth, our children, our possessions, all<BR>
Have we relinquished; like thy shadow,<BR>
We would follow thee. Oh leave us not!<BR>
For wheresoe'er thou art is happiness,<BR>
And heaven itself would be no heaven to us<BR>
Without our prince." Then, overwhelmed with grief<BR>
At these laments, the king stayed on his course,<BR>


<!------------------------page 360------------------------>

<A NAME="page_360"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 360</FONT></A>

In pity for his loving citizens.<BR>
Then Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra, filled with rage, his eyes<BR>
Rolling with wrath, exclaimed: "Shame on thee! shame!<BR>
O full of falsehood, and of wickedness.<BR>
How! would'st thou, then, speaker of lies!<BR>
Resume the gifts that thou hast freely made,<BR>
And reinstate thee in thy kingdom?" "Sir!<BR>
I go!" replied the king to these rude words,<BR>
And trembling crept away in haste, his wife<BR>
Holding him by the hand. And, as she went,<BR>
Her fragile form o'ercome with weariness,<BR>
The Br&acirc;hman smote her fiercely with his stick.<BR>
Then Hari&#353;chandra, pained with inmost grief,<BR>
Seeing the stroke, said meekly, "Sir! I go!"<BR>
Nor further spoke. Filled with compassion then,<BR>
The Vi&#353;vadevas said: "What sin is this?<BR>
What torments shall indeed suffice for him<BR>
By whom this pious king--the offerer<BR>
Of prayer, and sacrifice, has been cast forth.<BR>
Who now will sanctify the Soma-juice<BR>
With prayers and hymns, at the great sacrifice,<BR>
That we may drink it with rejoicing hearts?"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, having heard these words, the Br&acirc;hman turned<BR>
Upon the Vi&#353;vedev&acirc;s; and, in wrath<BR>
Exceeding hot, he spake a fearful curse:<BR>
"You shall be cast down from the height of heaven,<BR>
And live as men." The curse had hardly passed<BR>
His lips, when filled with pity for their fate,<BR>
The sage yet further added: "you shall live<BR>
Indeed as men, but yet, there shall be born<BR>
To you no son, nor shall you know the state<BR>
Of marriage. Envy, love, and wrath shall ne'er<BR>
Hold sway o'er you: and when the appointed time<BR>
Has past, you shall re-enter once again<BR>
The courts of heaven, and wear again the form<BR>
Which you had lost." The Vi&#353;vedev&acirc;s then<BR>
Came down from heaven, and, clothed in human form,<BR>
Were born as men, the sons of Pritha, wife<BR>


<!------------------------page 361------------------------>

<A NAME="page_361"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 361</FONT></A>

Of Pa.n.du. Therefore those five P&acirc;.n.davas--<BR>
Mighty in war--by Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra cursed,<BR>
Knew not the state of marriage. Thou hast heard<BR>
The tale of Pa.n.du's sons; thy question, too,<BR>
Of fourfold import has been answered.<BR>
I pray thee, say, what further would'st thou hear?<BR>

&nbsp;<BR>

<P ALIGN="center">BOOK VIII.</P>

Said Jaim&icirc;ni: An answer ye have found<BR>
To all my questions; and indeed have filled<BR>
Me full of deepest interest. Oh! I long<BR>
To hear yet more! Alas! that saintly king!<BR>
What grief he suffered! Did he e'er attain<BR>
To any comfort answering to his woe?<BR>
Noblest of Birds! Oh tell me this, I pray.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Birds continued: Then the king,<BR>
O'ercome with grief and pain, hearing the words<BR>
Of Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra, with his wife and son<BR>
Journeyed along, dragging his weary steps.<BR>
At length the holy place appeared in view--<BR>
The shrine of &#352;iva; thus within himself,<BR>
He said: "Benares, sacred to the god,<BR>
Lies now before me; there shall I find rest,<BR>
For there man has no power." The king approached<BR>
The gates on foot: lo! at the entry stood<BR>
The Br&acirc;hman Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra. Mighty Saint!<BR>
The king, his hands in supplication joined,<BR>
With humble reverence, said: "Here is my life,<BR>
My wife, my son, I offer all to thee;<BR>
Accept, I pray, the offering! or choose<BR>
Whatever else thou wouldest!" But the sage<BR>
Replied: "The month is past! most saintly king!<BR>
Give me the present for the sacrifice--<BR>


<!------------------------page 362------------------------>

<A NAME="page_362"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 362</FONT></A>

The offering thou hast promised." "One half-day<BR>
As yet remains before the month be past,<BR>
Oh Br&acirc;hman of surpassing piety,<BR>
And penances unfading. Wait, I pray,<BR>
A few short hours." Then Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra said:<BR>
"So be it, king! once more I will return,<BR>
But if the offering be not duly paid,<BR>
Before the sinking of this evening's sun,<BR>
My curse shall smite thee." And the priest<BR>
Departed, while the king, in anxious thought,<BR>
Debated thus: "How shall I make the gift?<BR>
The promised gift? where are my friends? my wealth?<BR>
I may not beg for alms; how can I then<BR>
Fulfil my vow? Nor even in the world<BR>
Beyond shall I find rest. Destruction waits,<BR>
If with my promise unfulfilled, I pass<BR>
From hence. A robber of the holy saints;<BR>
I shall become the lowest of the low.<BR>
Nay, I will sell myself! and, as a slave,<BR>
Redeem my promise." Then the queen, in tears<BR>
Bewildered, and afflicted, lost in thought,<BR>
With face cast down, "Maintain thy truth," she said,<BR>
"Most mighty prince! Oh! let not doubt prevail!<BR>
The man devoid of truth is to be shunned<BR>
Like contact with the dead. The highest law<BR>
Declares, that inward truth and faithfulness<BR>
Must be maintained. Burnt sacrifices, alms,<BR>
The study of the scriptures, penances,<BR>
Are counted not for righteousness to him<BR>
Whose word is faithless. Listen! noble prince!<BR>
Is it not written in the sacred law:<BR>
'The wise attain Salvation through the truth,<BR>
While lies and falsehood are destruction's way<BR>
To men of low and evil minds.' There lived,<BR>
'Tis said, a king upon the earth, by whom<BR>
The kingly sacrifice--burnt offerings too,<BR>
Were offered in abundance. That same king<BR>
Fell once from truthfulness, and by that fall,<BR>


<!------------------------page 363------------------------>

<A NAME="page_363"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 363</FONT></A>

He lost his righteousness, and forfeited<BR>
His place in heaven. Prince! I have borne a son"--<BR>
Her utterance failed her, issuing forth in nought<BR>
But sighs and lamentations. Then the king,<BR>
With eyes o'erflowing, said, "Behold thy son!<BR>
He stands beside thee! cast away thy grief!<BR>
Tell me what presses on thee." Said the queen,<BR>
"Prince, I have borne a son; and sons are born<BR>
To none but worthy women. This my son<BR>
Shall take me--he shall offer me for sale--<BR>
Then with the money gained, pay thou the priest<BR>
The promised offering." Hearing these words,<BR>
He fell down fainting. When his sense returned,<BR>
Filled with exceeding pain, the king burst forth,<BR>
Lamenting: "This, alas! most loving one!<BR>
Is hardly to be framed in words, much less<BR>
Be carried out in deed. Alas! alas!"--<BR>
His spirit fled again, and to the earth<BR>
He fell unconscious. Overcome with grief,<BR>
The queen exclaimed, filled with compassion: "King!<BR>
How art thou fallen from thy high estate!<BR>
The ground is now thy resting-place, whom once<BR>
A gorgeous couch received. Lo! this my lord,<BR>
By whom wealth, honour, power, are freely given<BR>
An offering to the Br&acirc;hman--see, he lies<BR>
Insensate on the ground. Ye gods of heaven!<BR>
Tell me, I pray you, has this noble king,<BR>
Equal to gods in rank, committed sin<BR>
Against you, that he lies thus overcome<BR>
With woe?" Then fell the queen, bereft of sense<BR>
Upon the earth, o'erwhelmed with grief and pain,<BR>
Seeing her husband's misery. When the boy<BR>
Beheld his parents lying on the ground,<BR>
He cried in terror: "Father! give me food!<BR>
Mother! my tongue is parched with thirst!" Meanwhile<BR>
Upon the scene the mighty Br&acirc;hman came;<BR>
And when he saw the king lie senseless, "King!"--<BR>
Sprinkling cold water on his face--he said,<BR>


<!------------------------page 364------------------------>

<A NAME="page_364"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 364</FONT></A>

"Rise up! rise up! Pay me the promised vow;<BR>
For this thy misery from day to day<BR>
Increases, and will yet increase, until<BR>
The debt be paid." The water's cooling touch<BR>
Refreshed the king; his consciousness returned;<BR>
But when he saw the Br&acirc;hman, faintness seized<BR>
His limbs again. Then overpowering rage<BR>
Seized Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra; but before he left,<BR>
The best of Br&acirc;hmans said: "If what is just,<BR>
Or right, or true, enters thy mind, O king!<BR>
Give me the present. Lo! by truth divine<BR>
The sun sends forth his vivifying rays<BR>
Upon the earth. By truth this mighty world<BR>
Stands firm and steadfast. Truth all law excels.<BR>
By truth the very heaven itself exists.<BR>
Wert thou to weigh the truth, and in the scale<BR>
Opposing, wert to place burnt-offerings,<BR>
And sacrifices countless, still the truth<BR>
Would far outweigh them all. Why need I waste<BR>
My words of loving-kindness upon thee--<BR>
An ill-intentioned, false, ignoble man.<BR>
Thou art a king,--so should the truth prevail<BR>
With thee. Yet hear me;--if the offering<BR>
Be still unpaid when th' evening's sun has sunk<BR>
Behind the western mountain to his rest,<BR>
My curse shall smite thee." Speaking words like these<BR>
The Br&acirc;hman left him; and the king, o'ercome<BR>
With fear--a fugitive--robbed of his wealth--<BR>
Degraded to unfathomable depths--<BR>
The victim of his evil creditor--<BR>
Heard once again the counsel of his wife:<BR>
"O king! sell <I>me</I>! nor let the fiery curse<BR>
Dissolve thy being!" Urged repeatedly,<BR>
The king at length replied: "Most loving one!<BR>
What the most wicked man could hardly do,<BR>
That same will I:--and I will sell my wife.<BR>
Alas! that I should utter such a word!"<BR>
And going with his wife into the town--<BR>


<!------------------------page 365------------------------>

<A NAME="page_365"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 365</FONT></A>

Eyes dimmed with tears, voice choked with grief--he cried:<BR>
"Come hither, townsmen! hearken unto me!<BR>
A wretch! inhuman! savage as a fiend!<BR>
I offer here my wife for sale, and yet<BR>
I live! Here is a female slave! Who buys?<BR>
Make haste and speak." "The female slave is mine!"<BR>
(So spake an ancient Br&acirc;hman to the king.)<BR>
"Money I have in heaps, and I will pay<BR>
You well for her. My wife is delicate;<BR>
Her household duties are beyond her strength;<BR>
I want a slave, and therefore I will give<BR>
A price proportioned to the woman's skill<BR>
And temper; nor will I o'erlook her youth<BR>
And beauty. What you think is fair and right,<BR>
That will I pay." Struck dumb with grief, the king<BR>
Stood mute, nor answered aught. And then the priest,<BR>
Tying the price in the king's garment-hem--<BR>
His bark-cloth garment--roughly grasped the queen,<BR>
And dragged her off. But when the loving child<BR>
Beheld his mother led away, he seized<BR>
Her by her garment. And the queen exclaimed:<BR>
"If only for a moment, noble sir!<BR>
Oh! let me go! that I may gaze once more<BR>
Upon my child, whom I shall never see,<BR>
And never touch again! My child, behold<BR>
Thy mother, now a slave! And thou--a prince!<BR>
Oh, touch me not! My lot of servitude<BR>
Forbids that thou should'st touch me." But the child,<BR>
His eyes bedewed with tears, ran after her,<BR>
Calling her "Mother!" As the boy came near,<BR>
The Br&acirc;hman spurned him with his foot; but he<BR>
Still following close would not be torn from her,<BR>
Calling her "Mother!" "Oh, my lord! I pray,<BR>
Be gracious to me!" said the queen. "Oh, buy<BR>
My son with me; divide us not! For I<BR>
Without him shall be nought of use to you.<BR>
Be gracious, O my lord!" Then said the priest:<BR>


<!------------------------page 366------------------------>

<A NAME="page_366"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 366</FONT></A>

"Here! take the money! give the boy to me!<BR>
The saints, who know the scriptures, have ordained<BR>
The right and lawful sum. Take it!" He tied<BR>
The money in the king's bark dress, and led<BR>
Them both away--the mother and the child--<BR>
Together bound. But when the king beheld<BR>
Himself bereft of both his wife and son,<BR>
He burst forth: "Ah! my wife! whom neither sun,<BR>
Nor moon, nor air have ever seen I who hast<BR>
Been kept from vulgar gaze! Alas I a slave<BR>
Hast thou become! Alas! thou, too, my son!--<BR>
A scion of the noble dynasty,<BR>
Sprung from the sun! disgrace has seized on thee,<BR>
And--shame upon me!--thou too art a slave!<BR>
Ye have become a sacrifice; ye, through my fault,<BR>
Have fallen. Would that I were dead!" Thus spoke<BR>
The king. Meanwhile the Br&acirc;hman hastily<BR>
Entered the grove wherein his dwelling stood,<BR>
And vanished with his slaves. Then met the king<BR>
The Br&acirc;hman Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra. "Prince!" he said,<BR>
Pay me the offering!" Hari&#353;chandra gave<BR>
The money gain&egrave;d by the shameful sale<BR>
Of wife and child. And when the priest beheld<BR>
The money, overcome with wrath, he said:<BR>
"How canst thou mock me with this paltry sum!<BR>
Base Kshatriya! And thinkest thou that this<BR>
Suffices for a sacrificial gift<BR>
Such as I would accept? But if thy mind<BR>
Thus far misleads thee, thou shalt feel my power--<BR>
Power transcendant, gained by penances,<BR>
And scripture meditation. Yes! the power<BR>
Of my pure Br&acirc;hmanhood shall show itself<BR>
On thee." "More will I give thee," said the king,<BR>
"But wait, most noble saint! Nought have I left!<BR>
Even my wife and child are sold." Replied<BR>
The Br&acirc;hman: "Hold! be silent! Further time<BR>
Than the remaining fourth part of to-day<BR>
I grant thee not." Enraged, he turned away,<BR>


<!------------------------page 367------------------------>

<A NAME="page_367"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 367</FONT></A>

Departing with the money. And the king,<BR>
Immersed in grief and fear, with face cast down,<BR>
Cried out: "If there be any one of you<BR>
Who wants a slave, let him make haste and speak<BR>
While day remains." Then Dharma, putting on<BR>
The form of a Cha.n.d&acirc;la, hastily<BR>
Came forward, taking pity on the king.<BR>
His countenance was fearful,--black, with tusks<BR>
Projecting; savage in his words; his smell<BR>
Was foul and horrible; a crowd of dogs<BR>
Came after him. "Tell me thy price," he said;<BR>
"Be quick; and whether it be large or small<BR>
I care not, so I have thee as my slave:"<BR>
The king, beholding such a loathsome form,<BR>
Of mien revolting--"What art thou?" he said.<BR>
"Men call me a Cha.n.d&acirc;la," he replied.<BR>
I dwell in this same city--in a part<BR>
Of evil fame. As of a murderer<BR>
Condemned to death, such is my infamy.<BR>
My calling is a robber of the dead."<BR>
"I will not be a slave," exclaimed the king,<BR>
"To thee, a base Cha.n.d&acirc;la. Better far<BR>
That I should perish by the fiery curse."<BR>
The words were scarcely uttered, when the saint<BR>
Returned, his countenance with rage<BR>
Distorted; and he thus addressed the king:<BR>
"The sum is fair; why dost thou not accept<BR>
The offer? Then indeed thou mightest pay<BR>
The gift thou owest for the sacrifice."<BR>
"O son of Ku&#353;ika!" replied the king,<BR>
"Consider this, I pray!--my noble race!<BR>
Truly am I descended from the sun!<BR>
How can I then become, though sore in want,<BR>
Lowest of creatures--a Cha.n.d&acirc;la's slave?"<BR>
"Delay no more," the Br&acirc;hman said, "but pay<BR>
The gift at once, and sell thyself a slave<BR>
To the Cha.n.d&acirc;la--or assuredly<BR>
I curse thee." "Saintly priest, be merciful!"<BR>


<!------------------------page 368------------------------>

<A NAME="page_368"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 368</FONT></A>

The king entreated; and, immersed in care,<BR>
He seized the Br&acirc;hman's feet, exclaiming thus:<BR>
"What am I but a slave, o'erwhelmed with grief!<BR>
Fear holds me! Saintly priest, be merciful!<BR>
Protect me, mighty saint! Save me, I pray,<BR>
From this most horrible Cha.n.d&acirc;la. Sir!<BR>
Most noble saint! hereafter shall thy will<BR>
Be all the object of my life! To serve<BR>
Thy lightest wish shall be my highest joy!<BR>
Thus will I make the offering--I will be<BR>
Thy <I>slave</I>!" Replied the Brahman: "If thou art<BR>
My slave, then will I sell thee as a slave<BR>
To the Cha.n.d&acirc;la." Then, filled with delight,<BR>
Paying the money, the &#352;vap&acirc;ka bound<BR>
His lately-purchased slave, and striking him,<BR>
Led hill away. Parted from all his friends;<BR>
In utmost grief; in the Cha.n.d&acirc;la's house<BR>
Abiding--morning, noon, and eventide,<BR>
And night, the king thus made lament:<BR>
"Alas! my tender wife, overwhelmed with pain,<BR>
Looking upon her son in misery,<BR>
Bewails her lot. But yet she says: 'The king<BR>
Will surely ransom us, for he has gained<BR>
By now more money than the Br&acirc;hman paid<BR>
For us;' and all the time she little knows<BR>
My fate--worse than her own. For I have passed<BR>
From woe to woe--kingdom and friends--my wife,<BR>
My son, have passed from me, and now the state<BR>
Of a Cha.n.d&acirc;la holds me." While he dwelt<BR>
A slave in the Cha.n.d&acirc;la's house, the forms<BR>
Of those he loved were still before his eyes--<BR>
Were ever in his mind. Meanwhile the king,<BR>
Obedient to his master's will, became<BR>
A robber of the dead; and night and day<BR>
He watched for plunder. "One part of the spoil<BR>
Is for the king, three for thy master, two<BR>
For thee. Go to the city's southern part,<BR>
Where is the dwelling of the dead, there wait."<BR>


<!------------------------page 369------------------------>

<A NAME="page_369"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 369</FONT></A>

Obeying the Cha.n.d&acirc;la, to the place<BR>
Of burial he went;--an awful place,<BR>
Filled full of fearful sounds and loathsome sights--<BR>
Of evil smells, and smoke, and locks of hair<BR>
Fallen from the dead; while troops of fiends and ghouls,<BR>
Vampires and demons, wandered to and fro.<BR>
Vultures and jackals prowled, and spirit forms'<BR>
Of evil hovered o'er. The ground was strewn<BR>
With heaps of bones; and wailing, sharp and shrill,<BR>
Re-echoed from the mourners of the dead.<BR>
The bodies on the funeral piles, half burnt,<BR>
Crackled and hissed; showing their shining teeth,<BR>
They grinned, as if in sport; while all the time<BR>
The howl of demons and the wail of fiends<BR>
Were mingled with the roar of flames--a sound<BR>
Of fearful import, such as ushers in<BR>
The day of doom. The sights, and sounds, and smells--<BR>
The heaps of ashes, and the piles of bones,<BR>
Blackened with filth--the smoke, the shouts,<BR>
The yells--struck fear on fear into the heart.<BR>
The burial-place resembled nought but hell.<BR>
Such was the place appointed for the king.<BR>
"Priests! Br&acirc;hmans! Counsellors! how have I fallen<BR>
From all my royal state! Alas! my queen!<BR>
Alas! my son! Oh! miserable fate!<BR>
We have been torn asunder by the power<BR>
Of Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra." Thoughts like these possessed<BR>
His inmost mind; while foul, unshorn, unwashed,<BR>
He served his master. Running here and there,<BR>
Armed with a jagged club, he sought the dead,<BR>
From whom he gained his wages. So he lived,<BR>
Degraded from his caste. Old knotted rags<BR>
Served as his dress; his face and arms and feet<BR>
With dust and ashes from the funeral piles<BR>
Begrimed; his hands defiled with putrid flesh<BR>
From contact with the bodies of the dead.<BR>
So neither day nor night he ceased from toil.<BR>
And twelve months passed--twelve weary months, which seemed<BR>


<!------------------------page 370------------------------>

<A NAME="page_370"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 370</FONT></A>

To his grief-stricken mind a hundred years;<BR>
And then at last, worn out, the best of kings<BR>
Lay down to rest; and as upon his couch<BR>
All motionless in sleep he lay, he saw<BR>
A wondrous vision. By the power divine<BR>
He seemed to wear another form,--a form<BR>
Both new and strange,--and in that form to pay<BR>
The vow. Twelve years of expiation passed<BR>
With difficulty. Then within himself<BR>
King Hari&#353;chandra thought: "So too will I,<BR>
When I am freed from hence, perform my vows<BR>
With generous freedom." Forthwith he was born<BR>
As a Pukkasa; while a place was found<BR>
For him among the dead, and funeral rites<BR>
Were ordered as his task. Thus seven years<BR>
Were passed; then to the burying-place was brought<BR>
A Br&acirc;hman seeking sepulture: in life<BR>
He had been poor, but honest; and the king,<BR>
Though he knew this--the dead man's poverty<BR>
And his uprightness--pressed his friends to pay<BR>
The funeral dues. "Enforce thy right," they said,<BR>
"And do this evil deed; yet know thou this:<BR>
Once upon earth there was a mighty king<BR>
Named Hari&#353;chandra; though he but disturbed<BR>
A Br&acirc;hman's sleep, through that offence he lost<BR>
His merit, and by Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra's curse<BR>
Became a base Pukkasa." "Yet the king<BR>
Spared not the dead man's friends, but still required<BR>
His fee. Therefore they cursed him in their rage--<BR>
"Go!--go!--thou most degraded of mankind--<BR>
Go to the lowest hell!" Then in his dream<BR>
The king beheld the messengers of death.<BR>
Fearful to look at, armed with heavy chains,<BR>
They seized him, and they bound him hand and foot,<BR>
And bore him off. And then, in fear and pain,<BR>
Headlong he fell into the bath of oil<BR>
In N&acirc;raka. There, torn with instruments<BR>
Sharp-edged as razors, fed on putrid blood,<BR>


<!------------------------page 371------------------------>

<A NAME="page_371"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 371</FONT></A>

He saw himself. For seven years in hell--<BR>
Now burnt from day to day, now tossed and torn,<BR>
Now cut by knives, and now by icy winds<BR>
Frozen and numbed--a dead Pukkasa's fate<BR>
He underwent. Each day in N&acirc;raka,<BR>
A hundred years of mortal reckoning--<BR>
So count the demons who inhabit hell.<BR>
Then he beheld himself cast up to earth,<BR>
His spirit entering a filthy dog;<BR>
Feeding on things all foul and horrible--<BR>
Consumed by cold. A month thus passed away.<BR>
His spirit changed its dwelling, and he saw<BR>
Himself an ass; and after that an ox,<BR>
A cow, a goat, a sheep, a bird, a worm.<BR>
So day by day he saw his spirit change<BR>
Its outward shape. A multitude of forms--<BR>
Some moving, others rooted to the ground--<BR>
Received his soul. And when the hundred years<BR>
Were passed and gone, he saw himself again<BR>
Re-occupy his pristine human form--<BR>
Once more a king. And then he seemed to lose<BR>
His kingdom, casting it away in games<BR>
Of chance. Turned from his home a wanderer<BR>
Into the forest with his wife and child:<BR>
Devoured by a ravening beast, but raised<BR>
To life again on earth, he sore bewailed<BR>
His wife: "Alas! why hast thou left me thus?<BR>
Alas! O Saivya! where hast thou gone?"<BR>
Then in his dream he seemed to see his wife<BR>
And son lamenting: "What hast thou to do<BR>
With gambling? Oh protect us, mighty king!"<BR>
The vision faded, and he saw no more<BR>
The cherished forms. And then the dream returned<BR>
By power divine. And Hari&#353;chandra stood<BR>
In heaven, and he beheld his wife on earth,<BR>
With flowing hair, dragged forcibly along--<BR>
Stripped of her clothes: the cry came to his ear,<BR>
"Protect us, king of men!" Then, snatched away,<BR>


<!------------------------page 372------------------------>

<A NAME="page_372"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 372</FONT></A>

The demons hurried him before the judge;<BR>
And Hari&#353;chandra seemed to hear the words:<BR>
"Go forth! return once more to earth! Thy grief<BR>
Is well nigh past and ended; joy ere long<BR>
Shall come to thee. The sorrows that remain<BR>
Endure." The king, then driven from the sky<BR>
By Yama's messengers, falling through space--<BR>
Senseless in fear and terror, filled with pain<BR>
Yet more exceeding--thought within himself,<BR>
"How shall I suffer all these torments sore!--<BR>
The changes manifold of form--the pain<BR>
In N&acirc;raka." Then Hari&#353;chandra sought<BR>
Aid from the gods: "O mighty lords," he said,<BR>
"Protect me! O protect my wife and child!<BR>
O mighty Dharma, thee I worship! Thee,<BR>
O Krish.na, the Creator! Faultless ones,<BR>
Both far and near, before you now I come,<BR>
A suppliant. On thee, O lord of prayer,<BR>
I call! on thee, O Indra too! to thee<BR>
O ancient one! I pray--immutable!"<BR>
The vision fled, the king arose from sleep.<BR>
His tangled hair, his body black and grimed,<BR>
Recalled to him his state--the plunderer<BR>
Of dead men's clothes. His recollection gone,<BR>
He thought not of his sorrowing wife and child,<BR>
For reason failed. The loss of kingdom, wealth,<BR>
And friends, his dwelling-place among the tombs,<BR>
Had overthrown his senses, and destroyed<BR>
His mind. Then to the burying-place the queen<BR>
Came, bearing the dead body of her son--<BR>
Pale and distracted. "My beloved son!<BR>
My child!" she kept exclaiming, while she threw<BR>
Dust on her head. "Alas! alas! O king!<BR>
O that thou could'st behold thy child," she said--<BR>
"Thy child now lying dead upon the earth,<BR>
Killed by a serpent's bite. Alas! my son!<BR>
So lovely! so delightful!" Then the king,<BR>
Rearing the sounds of mourning, went in haste<BR>


<!------------------------page 373------------------------>

<A NAME="page_373"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 373</FONT></A>

To rob the dead: nor did he recognize<BR>
His wife, in that sad mourner, changed by grief<BR>
As if into another. And the queen<BR>
Knew not the form that stood before her, clothed<BR>
In rags, with matted hair, withered and foul.<BR>
Then recollection dawned upon the king,<BR>
Seeing the dead child's princely form, the thought<BR>
Of his own son came o'er him. "Ah! my child!<BR>
What evil chance," he said, "has brought thee here!<BR>
A child of princely race thou seemest. He, my son,<BR>
Long lost to me through my accursed fate,<BR>
Would have been even such as thou in age."<BR>
Then raised the queen her voice, and thus she spoke:<BR>
"Alas! has some unexpiated crime<BR>
Brought upon us, my child! this endless woe.<BR>
My absent lord! since thou did'st not console<BR>
My grief in times gone by, how can the pain<BR>
I suffer now assuage? Did'st thou not lose<BR>
Thy kingdom? did'st thou not desert thy friends?<BR>
Did'st thou not sell thy wife and child?" The king<BR>
Heard her lament, and as he heard, the wail<BR>
Fell from his eyes,--he recognized again<BR>
His wife and son--and saying but the words,<BR>
"Ah! Saivya! Ah! my beloved child!"<BR>
He fainting fell to earth. Then, too, the queen,<BR>
Hearing her husband's voice, o'ercome with grief,<BR>
Insensate fell. Returning consciousness<BR>
Brought to them both affliction's heaviest weight<BR>
And mutual lamentations. "Ah! my son!"<BR>
Thus mourned the king, "my inmost heart is torn,<BR>
When I behold thy form so delicate:<BR>
My child! embracing thee in tend'rest love,<BR>
Words of affection I will speak, that rise<BR>
Unbidden to my lips. Alas! thy limbs<BR>
Will be defiled by my embrace; the dust<BR>
That clings about my garments will pollute<BR>
Thy lovely form! Alas! my child, thou had'st<BR>
An evil father! He who should have kept<BR>


<!------------------------page 374------------------------>

<A NAME="page_374"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 374</FONT></A>

All dangers from thee, he it was who sold<BR>
Thee as a slave! and yet in heart and mind<BR>
First of all things I love thee. Ah! my child!<BR>
Thy father's realm--my heaped-up wealth--all this<BR>
By lawful right was thine inheritance,<BR>
And now thou liest slain! Ah me! the tears<BR>
Rise to my eyes in blinding force: thy form,<BR>
In grace and beauty like the lotus flower,<BR>
Fades from my sight." He spoke, and faltering<BR>
With grief embraced his son. The queen exclaimed:<BR>
"This is indeed my lord--I know his voice!<BR>
I know his form! this is the mighty king.<BR>
The wisest of all beings. But how changed!<BR>
What fate is this? Ah what a dreadful place<BR>
For him, the lord of men. This grief yet more<BR>
Is added to the mourning for my son--<BR>
My husband's fate--for as a slave he serves<BR>
A base Cha.n.d&acirc;la. Curs&eacute;d be that god,<BR>
Or demon foul, through whom a godlike king<BR>
Has fallen to this degraded state; the lot<BR>
Of a &#352;vap&acirc;ka. Ah! most noble prince,<BR>
My mind is filled with grief, when I recall<BR>
Thy regal state, thy past magnificence.<BR>
No kingly ensigns go before thee now,<BR>
No captive kings, brought down to slavery,<BR>
Humbly precede thee, casting in the way<BR>
Their garments, lest the dust should soil thy feet.<BR>
But now! O king! alas, thyself a slave,<BR>
Thou livest in this fearful place, begrimed<BR>
With filth; thy sacred cord concealed, thy hair<BR>
Tangled and long, plunder of dead men's clothes<BR>
Thy livelihood. Ah! king! and is thy life<BR>
Spent in this awful wise?" So spake the queen,<BR>
And falling on his neck, embraced her lord:<BR>
While she, sprung from a king herself, bewailed<BR>
Her sorrows endless. "King! I pray thee speak!<BR>
Is this a dream? If it be real and true,<BR>
Then justice, truth, and righteousness have fled<BR>


<!------------------------page 375------------------------>

<A NAME="page_375"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 375</FONT></A>

And gone from earth: nor aught avails mankind,<BR>
Of sacrifice, or reverence, to gods<BR>
Or priests! 'Tis vain to follow innocence<BR>
If thou, most perfect, purest of mankind,<BR>
Art brought to such a depth of infamy."<BR>
Then spoke the king, and told his sorrowing wife<BR>
How he had fallen to this wretched state,--<BR>
The state of a Cha.n.d&acirc;la. She, in turn,<BR>
Weeping, with many sighs, poured out her tale,<BR>
Telling him how the serpent's bite had killed<BR>
Their child. "Beloved one! I suffer not<BR>
These evils," said the king, "by mine own will--<BR>
Thou seest what I endure; my evil fate<BR>
Depends not on myself. I am a slave,<BR>
And if I fly from the Cha.n.d&acirc;la's bonds,<BR>
The fiery torment in the depths of hell<BR>
Will overtake me, and I shall become<BR>
A slave again. My doom is fixed! lo! hell<BR>
Is my abode hereafter; and in forms,<BR>
Creeping and loathsome, shall my soul abide.<BR>
Yet from this miserable life on earth<BR>
There is one only refuge. He! my son!<BR>
My hope! my stay! is dead; drowned by the sea<BR>
Of my misfortunes. But I am a slave!<BR>
I am dependent on another's will!<BR>
Can I give up my wife? Yes! even so!<BR>
For know thou this: one who is steeped in woe<BR>
Cares not for evil chances; not the state<BR>
Of the most loathsome beast, nor yet the wood<BR>
Of sword-leaved plants, nor even hell's dread stream,<BR>
Could add the smallest fraction to the pain<BR>
I have already borne. My son is dead!<BR>
Who then will make atonement for my sins?<BR>
Yet listen to my words, beloved one,<BR>
If I have offered sacrifice, and paid<BR>
Due reverence to the saints; if I have given<BR>
Alms to the needy--may we meet again<BR>
Hereafter, in the world to come, and find<BR>


<!------------------------page 376------------------------>

<A NAME="page_376"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 376</FONT></A>

The refuge for our woes denied us here.<BR>
Let us together follow in the path<BR>
By which our son has gone. Our hopeless fate<BR>
Can never alter here. Whatever words<BR>
I may have uttered, thoughtlessly, in jest,<BR>
These, when I pray for pardon, shall receive<BR>
Fullest forgiveness. Thou must not despise<BR>
Thy lord: nor pride thee on thy queenly state<BR>
Now passed and gone." The prince's wife replied:<BR>
"I am prepared to tread that path with thee,<BR>
O king, most saintly! and with thee that world<BR>
To enter." While she spoke these words, the king<BR>
Made up the funeral pile, and placed thereon<BR>
His son, himself ascending with his wife.<BR>
And then, in meditation wrapt, he thought<BR>
Upon N&acirc;r&acirc;yana, the lord supreme,<BR>
And V&acirc;sudeva, lord of deities,<BR>
&#352;iva, and Br&acirc;hma the eternal god,<BR>
And Krish.na clothed in glory. As the king<BR>
Was meditating, all the gods from heaven<BR>
Came down headed by Dharma. And they said:<BR>
"Hear us, O king! hear us, O lord! The gods--<BR>
Even the mighty gods have come to earth,<BR>
And at their head is Dharma. Gods, and saints,<BR>
And heroes--yea, and Vi&#353;v&acirc;mitra too,<BR>
The sage implacable,--all summon thee--<BR>
Ascend! to heaven: receive the due reward,<BR>
That thou hast gained. O king! slay not thyself!<BR>
I, perfect Righteousness, I summon thee<BR>
To enter now the heaven that thou hast gained<BR>
By thy transcendant virtues, self-control,<BR>
Patience, and truth." Then Indra spoke, and said:--<BR>
"O Hari&#353;chandra! King, most eminent!<BR>
In virtue! lo! before you Indra stands--<BR>
For I am he. The everlasting world<BR>
Thou hast attained: together with thy wife,<BR>
And son, ascend to heaven;--to that third heav'n--<BR>
So difficult to be attained by men--<BR>


<!------------------------page 377------------------------>

<A NAME="page_377"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 377</FONT></A>

The heav'n that thou hast won." Then Indra rained<BR>
Life-giving am.rit from the sky, and flowers<BR>
That blossomed in the heavenly courts: while sounds<BR>
Of music filled the air, and round him stood<BR>
The gods, a vast assembly. Then the son<BR>
Of Hari&#353;chandra rose, restored to life,<BR>
And health, his mind and senses whole, his form<BR>
More beautiful than ever: and the king<BR>
Embraced his wife and son, with perfect joy<BR>
Filled to o'erflowing, crowned with heavenly wreaths.<BR>
Then Indra said: "Thou, with thy wife, and son,<BR>
Shalt dwell in bliss supreme: bliss that thyself<BR>
Hast purchased, by thy virtues and thy toils."<BR>
Then spoke the king: "Hear me! most holy gods!<BR>
Unbidden by my master, will I not<BR>
To heaven itself ascend." Then Dharma spoke:<BR>
"I am thy master. I assumed the form<BR>
Of a Cha.n.d&acirc;la. All thy pain and woe<BR>
Was brought upon thee by my magic power,<BR>
And thou wast made a slave! I have beheld<BR>
Thy truth, and thy uprightness. Saintly king!<BR>
The highest place that heaven accords to men,<BR>
Whose virtue has been tried and proved:--to that<BR>
Ascend!" But Hari&#353;chandra answering, said:<BR>
"Receive, most mighty lord! my words of praise<BR>
And thanksgiving. I offer them to thee<BR>
Full of affection. Lo! my people stand<BR>
With grieving hearts, longing for my return.<BR>
Can I ascend to heav'n while they on earth<BR>
Lament for me? If they have ever slain,<BR>
Br&acirc;hmans, or teachers of the holy law,--<BR>
If lust or avarice have ruled their hearts,--<BR>
Then may my labours and my toils atone,<BR>
For these their sins. I may not leave my friends.<BR>
For neither here, nor in the world to come,<BR>
Can there be peace to one who casts aside<BR>
The friend whose love is pure and true--the friend<BR>
Who serves him from the heart. Return!<BR>


<!------------------------page 378------------------------>

<A NAME="page_378"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 378</FONT></A>

Return! to heaven! O Indra! If thou grant<BR>
My friends to rise with me, to heav'n will I<BR>
Ascend; if not, with them will I descend<BR>
To N&acirc;raka." "O king! thy prayer is heard!<BR>
Thy people's sins are pardoned: even for them,<BR>
Hard though it be, thy toils and pains have gained<BR>
A place in heaven." Thus mighty Indra spoke.<BR>
Replied the king: "Indra! I will not leave<BR>
My kinsmen. By his kinsmen's help a king<BR>
His kingdom rules; by them he offers up<BR>
The kingly sacrifice, and for himself<BR>
Lays up a store of meritorious deeds.<BR>
So have my kinsmen too enabled me<BR>
To work whate'er I may of righteousness.<BR>
My actions virtuous, my granted prayers,<BR>
Truly I owe to them, for by their aid<BR>
Have these been possible. May the reward<BR>
Thou grantest me, I pray, be shared with them.<BR>
My kinsmen, though I should ascend to heaven,<BR>
I will not leave." "So be it!" Indra said;<BR>
"So be it!" said the Br&acirc;hman; Dharma, too,<BR>
Gave his assent; and then, in countless hosts,<BR>
Appeared the heavenly chariots. Indra said:<BR>
"Men of Ayodhya, ascend to heaven."<BR>
The saintly Br&acirc;hman, having heard with joy<BR>
The words of Indra, poured the sacred oil<BR>
Upon the prince, and with the perfect ones,<BR>
The sages, and the gods, anointed him<BR>
"Son of the mighty king." Then all the throng--<BR>
The king, his wife, his son, his followers--<BR>
Filled with rejoicing and delight, ascend<BR>
To heaven, surrounding, as they go, the king<BR>
Borne in his chariot. He, too, filled with joy--<BR>
The mighty father, who eternal bliss<BR>
Both for his people and himself had gained,<BR>
Once more in form and mien a king--reposed,<BR>
Resting from all his toils, his faithful friends<BR>
Surrounding him with a protecting wall.<BR>


<!------------------------page 379------------------------>

<A NAME="page_379"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 379</FONT></A>

And Indra spoke and said: "Upon this earth<BR>
Great Hari&#353;chandra's equal has not been<BR>
Nor shall be. Whosoe'er may hear his life,<BR>
His toils, his sorrows, and in sympathy<BR>
For him lament, transcendant happiness<BR>
Shall he attain, and all his heart's desire<BR>
Shall be accomplished. Is his prayer a wife,<BR>
Or son, or kingdom, he shall gain them all,<BR>
E'en heaven itself. And he who imitates<BR>
The truth, and steadfastness, of that great king,<BR>
Like him shall enter everlasting rest.<BR></TD></TR>
