<P ALIGN="center">ART. IV.--<I>Bh&ucirc;ridatta J&acirc;taka Vatthu</I>. By R. F. ST. ANDREW ST. JOHN, M.A.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">PREFATORY REMARKS.</P>

<P>THIS translation has been made from a Burmese copy printed at the Hanthawati Press, Rangoon, but there is nothing to show whence the text was taken. I have also made use of a manuscript taken from the Mandalay Library, and now at the India Office. The g&acirc;th&acirc;, which in many places seem to be imperfect, are not given in the shape of g&acirc;th&acirc; in the Mandalay copy. In some cases the Burmese translation was redundant, and in others defective, so in translating them, though not a P&acirc;li scholar, I have done my best to stick to the P&acirc;li text, receiving some valuable assistance from Prof. Rhys Davids. The J&acirc;taka is No. 547 in the Ceylon List, and what is called one of the Greater J&acirc;taka, probably composed at a late date, as it refers to the Pa.n.dara J&acirc;taka, No. 521 [vol. v. p. 75, of Fausb&ouml;ll], which I have translated in a note from another Burmese source.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this very remarkable J&acirc;taka is to set forth the general wickedness of Brahmans and the arguments in their favour given by K&acirc;.n&acirc;ri.t.tha, who in a former birth had been a sacrificial Brahman, which arguments are refuted at length by the Bodhisat Bh&ucirc;ridatta. There are two points to which I would draw special attention, which may throw light on the date or period at which it was composed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1st. In the twenty-first stanza of the first discourse (F. 157) there is a reference to certain practices in the country of Kamboja, which apparently has no connexion with what goes before.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd. The appellation of the snake-charmer-Alamp&acirc;yano. A derivative of this word, viz. Alampay, is now used in Burmese to denote a person who is skilled in catching snakes (<I>vide</I> Judson's Dictionary), and it may be argued

<!------------------------p. 78------------------------>

<A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A>

that this word was taken from the name of this snake-charmer celebrated in J&acirc;taka-lore. I think, however, that there is evidence to show that it was not the man's proper name, but the name of the trade, for I find that the words used by the snake-charmer himself in relating the story of the Garu.la are, Alamp&acirc;ya.namantan&acirc;ma "the charms of a snake-charmer."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word, therefore, I take it, has its derivation from Alam implying <I>full, sufficient</I>, and p&acirc;ya <I>drinking</I> or <I>having drunk</I>. It may also be noted that the same word occurs in the Sudhammacari Stories, which I have given in <I>Folk Lore Journal</I>, vol. vii. part iv. p. 311, and that the Princess Sudhamma-cari is said to have been the daughter of Madda, a R&acirc;j&acirc; of Kamboja.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is much to be regretted that books which appear to be published by the "Text-book Committee of Rangoon " are not more carefully edited. They are full of errors.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S.--Since the above was written Professor Fausb&ouml;ll has had the very great kindness to favour me with a copy of his transcript of the P&acirc;li verses of this J&acirc;taka. It would have been impossible without his aid, so graciously given, to restore the right reading of many of them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, when the most excellent Buddha was residing in the J&ecirc;tavana Monastery, he came into the hall, and, sitting down, looked round at the Rahans assembled there. Seeing amongst them some laymen who were keeping the fast-day, he took them as the subject of his discourse, and said, "O devout laymen, ye do well in keeping the fast; but, inasmuch as ye have me to give you instruction, you must not think overmuch of your devoutness, for in past times there have been others who, though they had no teacher relinquished great wealth in order to keep the fast."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At their request he then related the following birth-story:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times long past, when Br&acirc;hmadatta reigned in B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi, he appointed his eldest son to be Upar&acirc;j&acirc;; but, seeing that he had accumulated much wealth and many adherents, he feared that he might become a source of danger to the throne, and said, "Dear son, I pray you depart into some other country, until I shall have passed away, when you can return and assume the royal estate, which is your inheritance." The Prince, obedient to his father's commands, left his country as a solitary wanderer, and took up his abode in a hut in a valley near the river Yamun&acirc;, where he assumed the garb of an ascetic, living on the fruits which he found in the forest. At that time a certain N&acirc;ga lady,<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> who had lost her husband, came up from N&acirc;ga land, and, seeing the Prince's footprints on the river shore, followed them till she came to the hut. The Prince being absent, in search of fruit, she entered, and, seeing his couch of dead leaves and other utensils, reasoned thus with herself: "This hut belongs to a hermit: I will try him in order to find out whether he be a real ascetic, or only some person who is pretending to be one. If he be a real ascetic he will have no carnal desires and refuse to sleep on a couch that is adorned. If, however, he does recline on it, he will not be a real hermit, and will be willing to become my husband and dwell with me in this forest." She then went down to N&acirc;ga land, and, bringing thence some fairy flowers, spread them on the couch and withdrew.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cool of the evening the Prince came back to his hut, and, seeing the flowers, exclaimed, "Who on earth can have done this?" He then made his supper and fell asleep upon the bed with sensations of delight. In the morning he got up, and, having swept out his cell, went again in search of fruits. When he was gone, the Nagini came again, and, seeing that the flowers were faded and crushed, said, "Evidently this is no hermit, but a man of ordinary passions." She then removed the old flowers and strewed the

couch with fresh ones. The second night the Prince was again very much astonished, but slept on the couch. In the morning he went out and concealed himself in the bushes near his hut to watch, and, on seeing the lovely Nagini, carne out full of love for her, and asked her who she was. The lady replied, "My lord, I am a Nagini, and my husband is dead. Whence come you, my lord?" The Prince told her that he was the son of the R&acirc;j&acirc; of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi, and proposed that they should dwell together. The Nagini at once agreed, and caused a splendid fairy palace to spring up, in which they dwelt with all manner of delights. In due course the Nagini bore a son, whom they named S&acirc;gara, because he was born near the sea; and when he was able to run, she had a daughter, whom they called Samuddaj&acirc; for the same reason.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many years after this a hunter of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi came that way, and, recognizing the Prince, told him all that was going on. He told the Prince he would tell the R&acirc;j&acirc; all about him, but, on reaching B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi, found that the R&acirc;j&acirc; was dead. On the seventh day after his decease the funeral took place, and then the nobles consulted, saying, "Sirs, a country that is kingless cannot ward off the thorns of strife, and as we know not where our Prince is, we are powerless. We had better make ready the consecrated car<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> and send it forth in search of a king." Whilst they were thus deliberating, the hunter returned and reported his discovery. As soon as the nobles heard the news, they rewarded the hunter, and proceeded with a great retinue as the hunter directed them. On reaching the Prince's dwelling, they told the Prince that he must return with them and take up the reins of government. Upon this the Prince went to his wife and said, "Lady, my father has departed this life for that of the Devas, and the nobles have come to ask me to assume the royal estate: let us both go and reign in B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi, which is twelve yojana in extent; you, my queen, will be the chief of 16,000 ladies." But

she answered, "My lord R&acirc;j&acirc;, I cannot, for I am endowed with a poison (or flame) which shows itself on the slightest feeling of irritation, and though I feel strongly that I ought to live with my husband, yet if I were to accompany him and anything were to arouse my anger, those who were the cause would be reduced to fine ashes: for this reason I cannot go with you." Next morning she entreated him as follows: "My dear lord, since I cannot accompany you, and these children of ours, though N&acirc;gas, are still to a certain extent human, be kind to them, if you really love me. Being of a race that lives in the waters, they are very tender, and cannot bear the rays of the sun; cause therefore, I pray you, that they make vessels to hold water, in which they may be conveyed, and when they arrive at B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi have a tank made for them to sport in." Having thus spoken, she passed round him by the right hand and, after saluting him and embracing both the children, departed weeping to serpent-land.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the R&acirc;j&acirc;, heavy at heart and with brimming eyes, went forth from their palace to where the nobles were waiting for him, and when they had poured over him the water of consecration, he directed them to prepare the vessels in which to carry his children. When the vessels had been prepared, he directed that they should be placed on wheels and filled with water. In course of time they got to B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi, which was decorated for the occasion, and remained for seven days in a great pavilion surrounded by singers and dancers, whilst the nobles drank sweet liquors.<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> The R&acirc;j&acirc; then ordered a lotus tank<SUP><SMALL>[2]</SMALL></SUP> to be made for the children to play in.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, when they were letting the water into the tank, a tortoise got in by accident, and being unable to get out concealed himself there. When the Prince and Princess were swimming about, one day, it put its head above the water and looked at them. The children, seeing the tortoise, fled in terror to their father, and told him there was a

demon in the tank. The King summoned his attendants, and ordered that the tortoise should be caught. When it was found and brought, and the children declared that it was the demon that had frightened them, he ordered that it should be punished.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One nobleman suggested that it ought to be pounded in a mortar, another said that it ought to be boiled and eaten, another that it should be roasted; but one noble who was afraid of water, suggested that it should be thrown into a whirlpool in the river Yamun&acirc;. On hearing this, the tortoise put out its head and said, "O R&acirc;j&acirc;, what have I done? It would be a terrible punishment to throw me into a whirlpool, and I am ready to undergo any punishment rather than that."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King, being very angry, at once ordered that the tortoise should be thrown into the whirlpool, and when the sentence had been executed, the tortoise was sucked down by the current to serpent-land.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then a son of Dhatara.t.tha, the N&acirc;ga king, was sporting in the whirlpool, and seeing the tortoise, ordered it to be seized; whereupon the tortoise, who saw himself in a worse plight, cried out, "Friends, why do you, who are the servants of Dhatara.t.tha, treat me so roughly? I am an ambassador<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> from the R&acirc;j&acirc; of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi, named Cittac&ucirc;.la, and he has sent me to inform your lord Dhatara.t.tha that he wishes to give him his daughter in marriage. Take me before your R&acirc;j&acirc;." When the N&acirc;ga youths heard this, they took him before the R&acirc;j&acirc;. But the R&acirc;j&acirc; was displeased and said, "The R&acirc;j&acirc; of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi ought not to have sent such an ugly fellow as this as his ambassador."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tortoise called out, "O R&acirc;j&acirc; of the N&acirc;gas, why do you say this? Ought an ambassador to be as tall as a palm tree?<SUP><SMALL>[2]</SMALL></SUP> Ambassadors, whether they be tall or short, are estimated after the manner in which they perform their duties. O R&acirc;j&acirc;, my master the King of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi has many ambassadors: on land he employs men, and in the air

birds; I am Cittac&ucirc;.la the tortoise, no common tortoise, but a nobleman and bosom friend of the R&acirc;j&acirc;; do not revile me."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the King of the N&acirc;gas inquired on what business he had been sent, and the tortoise answered, "My lord, our master has made friends with all the kings who are on the face of the earth, but has not yet made an alliance with Dhatara.t.tha, the King of the N&acirc;gas; he is, however, willing to give you his daughter Samuddaj&acirc; in marriage, and ordered me to come to your majesty and inform you. Do not delay, O R&acirc;j&acirc;, but send some messengers with me to arrange the day for the wedding."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dhatara.t.tha, being pleased at this speech, summoned some of the N&acirc;ga youths, and directed them to go to B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi and arrange the wedding. So they went with the tortoise; but just before they got to B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi, the tortoise, seeing a pool of water handy, slipped into it and hid himself under pretence of gathering lilies as a present. After waiting some time for the tortoise, they went on, and taking human form went into the presence of the R&acirc;j&acirc;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King asked them why they had come and they answered, "Your Majesty, we have been sent by Dhatara.t.tha, the King of the N&acirc;gas, and we trust that your Majesty is in good health." The R&acirc;j&acirc; then asked them what special business they had been sent on, and they said:</P>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the King hearing this, he was enraged, and answered:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the N&acirc;ga youths thought, "Of a truth this R&acirc;j&acirc; belongs not to a race that is suitable to match with our King Dhatara.t.tha, and yet he sent his ambassador Cittac&ucirc;.la to say he would give his daughter: we must display our power, and frighten this King of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi, who has insulted our R&acirc;j&acirc;." So they said:</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top">3. </TD><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely now, both life and kingdom are rejected by thee, R&acirc;j&acirc;,<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The R&acirc;j&acirc; of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi exclaimed:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing this, the young N&acirc;gas were very wroth and said, "Though we could now slay the King of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi, with the breath of our nostrils, since we are under our master's order to arrange a marriage and not commit destruction, it will not be right for us to do so; so we will go and report the matter to our Lord." They therefore returned to serpent-land, and on arrival there the Serpent King questioned them, saying, "Dear sirs, how is it? Have you brought the Princess Samuddaj&acirc;?" The enraged messengers answered, "O R&acirc;j&acirc;, you sent us to the King of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi without knowing the truth of the matter; if you are angry and desire to slay us, do it here in serpent-land. The R&acirc;j&acirc; of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi was puffed up with pride and reviled thee." Thereupon the Serpent King cried:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the serpent tribes had assembled, they said, "O R&acirc;j&acirc;, if we are to go to B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi and slay no one, what are we to do?" And the R&acirc;j&acirc; answered:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they spread themselves all over the city of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi in the houses, the streets, and water-tanks, at midnight.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the four young N&acirc;gas who had acted as ambassadors, twining their bodies round the legs of the couch on which the King was sleeping, spread out their hoods and showed their fangs and hissed loud enough to split his head. Dhatara.t.tha the N&acirc;ga King, too, overshadowed the whole city. Those who woke up in the night and stretched out their hands or feet felt nothing but hissing serpents, and shrieked out "Alas! the serpents, the serpents." Some struck lights, and looking out saw the serpents writhing and twining themselves all over the gates and battlements and with one voice shrieked and wailed. So the whole city was in confusion, and when the day dawned, all the people, from the King downwards, were in a state of terror and cried out, "O great Lord of the N&acirc;gas, why do you thus torment us?" The serpents answered, "Your king sent an ambassador to our king promising his daughter in marriage, and afterwards treated our ambassadors with contumely, acting deceitfully and treating our king as though he were nought but a brute beast; verily if your king gives not his daughter to our king, we will destroy this city and all its inhabitants."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing this, the people answered, "O great N&acirc;gas, be not afraid, but open a road for us to go to the palace and we will entreat our king." So the N&acirc;gas allowed them to pass, and the people assembled at the door of the palace and wept with a great lamentation. The Queen, too, with all the ladies of the palace, cried out, "O R&acirc;j&acirc;, give your daughter Samuddaj&acirc; to the King of the N&acirc;gas." The four young N&acirc;gas round the King's couch cried out, "Give, give!"<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the King of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi was stricken with terror and shrieked out thrice, "I will give my daughter Samuddaj&acirc; to Dhatara.t.tha the king of the N&acirc;gas."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had uttered these words, all the N&acirc;gas retired

to a distance of three leagues from B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi and dwelt in a city which they had built for the purpose; they also sent suitable presents for the Princess. The R&acirc;j&acirc; of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi received the presents and informed the messengers that he would send his daughter in due state. He then sent for Samuddaj&acirc; and taking her to an upper chamber in a turret of the palace, opened the window, and said, "My darling daughter, look at that beautiful city. I am going to give you in marriage to the R&acirc;j&acirc; of that city, where you will be a queen. It is not far from here, and when you call to mind your parents, it will be easy to return and see them." Having thus spoken persuasively, he caused her to wash her head, and when she had been decked in jewels and rich garments, he sent her in a carriage<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> with a retinue of nobles. The nobles of the N&acirc;gas also came out to meet her with great honour. They then entered the N&acirc;ga city and presented her to the King, who sent them back to B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi with rich presents. The King of the N&acirc;gas placed the Princess in a splendid palace on a magnificent couch surrounded by N&acirc;ga damsels in human form, where she soon fell into a deep sleep.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Dhatara.t.tha, accompanied by all his hosts, departed thence to serpent-land, and when the Princess woke up and saw all the N&acirc;ga palaces and gardens, which were like those in the land of the Devas, she inquired of her attendants; saying, "This country is very splendid and not like my own native land, whose country is it?" and they answered "Lady, it is the city of your lord and husband, Dhatara.t.tha, the King of the N&acirc;gas; it is not suitable for those who have not acquired merit. Since you have acquired merit, you have obtained this fairy dwelling-place and wealth." King Dhatara.t.tha issued a proclamation to be made by beat of drum throughout all serpent-land, saying, "Let no one dare show himself to Queen Samuddaj&acirc; in serpent form." So the Princess dwelt happily with R&acirc;j&acirc; Dhatara.t.tha, unaware that she was not in the country of men.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in due course Queen Samuddaj&acirc; bore a son to Dhatara.t.tha, and as he was very beautiful, he was called Sudassana. Again, she bore another, who was named Datta. He was the Bodhisat. After this she bore Subhoga, and then a fourth, who was called Ari.t.tha. Up to that time Queen Samuddaj&acirc; did not know that she was in serpent-land; but one day some one said to the little Ari.t.tha, "Your mother is not a N&acirc;ga, but a human being;" so he determined to put her to the test, and one day when at her breast he changed himself into serpent form and coiled his tail round his mother's instep. When the Queen saw this, she was terrified, and, shrieking, struck him to the earth with her hand, and one of her finger nails happening to injure his eye, he became blind in that eye, and the blood ran out. Dhatara.t.tha, hearing the Queen cry out, asked what was the matter, and hearing what Prince Ari.t.tha had done, threatened to have him slain. But Queen Samuddaj&acirc; said, "O R&acirc;j&acirc;, one of his eyes is put out, do not punish him further, be merciful I pray you." So the R&acirc;j&acirc;, out of love for his Queen, pardoned him. From that day Queen Samuddaj&acirc; knew that she was in serpent-land, and her son Ari.t.tha was called K&acirc;.n&acirc;ri.t.tha.<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the Prince was grown up, their father divided his country into five parts, and gave them each a division with a proper retinue. He kept one division for himself. Sudassana, Subhoga and K&acirc;.n&acirc;ri.t.tha used to come once a month to see their father, but Datta came every fortnight, and if there was any difficult question, he would solve it.<SUP><SMALL>[2]</SMALL></SUP> When he went with his father to Vir&ucirc;pakkha,<SUP><SMALL>[3]</SMALL></SUP> be also solved any difficult questions that were asked. One day Vir&ucirc;pakkha went with all the N&acirc;ga hosts to T&acirc;v&acirc;timsa to do homage to Sakko, and a difficult question was mooted. When no one was able to solve it, the Bodhisat Datta

explained it, at which Sakko was delighted, and said, "Dear son, Datta, you are as full of wisdom as the earth is thick, from henceforth you shall be called Bh&ucirc;ri-datta."<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day he remained in attendance on Sakko.<SUP><SMALL>[2]</SMALL></SUP> Seeing Sakko in his palace, called Vejayanta, surrounded by beautiful fairies dressed in goodly apparel and covered with jewels, he was desirous of becoming a Deva, and thought, "What advantage is there in being a raw-flesh<SUP><SMALL>[3]</SMALL></SUP> eating N&acirc;ga? I will return to serpent-land and keep the fast-days." So he returned to serpent-land, and said, "Dear father and mother, I intend to keep the fast-days." They answered, "Dear son, do as you wish, but, if you keep them outside serpent-land, on the surface of the earth, there will be danger." The Bodhisat answered, "Good, I will keep them in a quiet garden in serpent-land."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whilst thus engaged, the young N&acirc;ga girls surrounded him, playing on various instruments, and disturbed him; so he said, "I cannot keep the fast properly here, I will go to the country of men;" but, fearing that his parents might prevent him, he called his wives and said, "Ladies, I intend to go to the country of men and coiling myself round an ant hill at the foot of a banyan tree on the banks of the Yamun&acirc;, keep a fourfold fast: on the morning of the following day come with all your retinue and musicians, and conduct me back to serpent-land." Having thus instructed them, he went and coiled himself on the top of an ant hill and reflected thus, "If any one desires to take my skin, my sinews, my bone or my blood, let him do so." Then, making himself rigid like the log of a harrow, he kept the fast. When &Acirc;ru.na sent forth his rays, the N&acirc;ga women came as directed and conducted him back to N&acirc;ga-land, and in this manner he fasted many times.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time there dwelt in a village near the gate of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi a Brahman (named Nes&acirc;da), who, with his son Somadatta, used to get his living by killing deer. One day this Brahman, not being able to find even a lizard, said, "Dear son Somadatta, if we go home empty-handed, your mother will scold." Just then they came close to the place where the Bodhisat was fasting and went down to the Yamun&acirc; to drink. On coming up they saw the track of a deer, so the Brahman said to his son, "Somadatta, I see the footprints of a deer, stand still for a little and I will shoot it. Then taking his bow and arrows, he remained on the watch at the foot of a tree. The deer came down to drink and the Brahman shot at it, but it made off, leaving traces of its blood. The two hunters followed it up, and when they found it, the sun was just setting, and they arrived at the banyan tree where the Bodhisat was fasting. They agreed that they would go no further that night, and, having hid away the carcase of the deer, climbed into the tree. In the morning the Brahman woke up, and just then the N&acirc;ga ladies had come to escort Bh&ucirc;ridatta back to serpent-land. Hearing the sound of their music, he tried to waken his son Somadatta, but being unable, he let him sleep and went alone, and going up to the Bodhisat said:<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he had said this, he reflected, "This Brahman is a cruel old fellow; if he were to point me out to a snake-charmer, I should incur great danger. I will therefore carry him off to serpent-land and endow him with great wealth, and so be able to continue my fasts in security." He therefore said to the Brahman, "Come with me to serpent-land and see all its delights. I will give you great wealth." The Brahman answered, "My lord, I am not alone, but my son is up in the tree: if he may come too, I will go. After saying, "Call your son," the Bodhisat said:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then bore away both father and son to serpent-land, and on arriving there they changed their human appearance to that of fairies. The Bodhisat gave them much riches and five hundred fairy wives. So the two Brahmans enjoyed great wealth and the Bodhisat was able to keep his fasts. Every half-moon he came to see his father and mother and preach the law; then he went to the Brahmans, and inquired after their health and wishes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day the old Brahman, after about a year had passed, felt unhappy, and wishing to return to the country of men, began to feel as if serpent-land were hell, and all the beautiful ornamented palaces like prisons, and the lovely N&acirc;ga girls like devils; so he determined to go and talk to Somadatta. On getting there he said, "Dear son, are you happy here?" Somadatta replied, "Dear father, why should I not be happy? are you not happy too?" His father answered, "Dear son, it is long since I have seen your mother, brothers, and sisters, I am unhappy, let us go away." At first Somadatta refused; but as his father besought him, he at last consented. The old Brahman thought, "If I tell Bh&ucirc;ridatta that I am unhappy, he will

If he says that he fasts in order to go to Deva-land, I will say that we too must go back in order to get permission from our relatives to become ascetics: if I put it in this way, he will not be able to refuse, but will give me permission to return to earth."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bodhisat then said: "O Brahman, since you are determined to be an ascetic, so be it; but if at any time through inability to carry out your vows, you relinquish that life, come to me, without fear, and I will give you great wealth."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bh&ucirc;ridatta, Prince of Nigas," said the Brahman, "your words are very pleasant: in the hour of need I will certainly come to you for help."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bodhisat then summoned some N&acirc;ga youths and directed them to conduct the Brahman and his son back to the country of men; so they took them close to the city of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi and left them. The Brahman then said to his son, "Dear Somadat, this is the spot where I killed the deer, and here I slew a wild boar;" and thus conversing about the old familiar haunts, they came to a pool of water, in which they proceeded to bathe; and as soon as they went into the water, their fairy garments disappeared, and their old garments came in place of them, and their bows and arrows. Then Somadatta wept and said, "Father, to what misery we have returned after so much magnificence!" But the old Brahman replied, "Son, be not afraid, deer are not scarce in the forest, and we can still get our livelihood by killing them." Thus conversing they arrived at their home.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Somadatta's mother heard that her husband and son had arrived, she ran out to meet them, and, bringing them into the house, set food and drink before them. When he had eaten and drunk, he fell asleep, and then she said to her son, "Dear Somadat, you and your father have been absent for a long time, what city have you been residing in?" He said, "Dearest mother, Bh&ucirc;ridatta, the King of the Serpents, carried us both off to his country, but, though

we enjoyed great wealth and pleasure there, we were unhappy and have come back." "If that is true," said the Brahmaness, "have you brought any precious stones with you?" "No," said Somadat, "we have brought none." "Didn't the Serpent King give you a single thing?" asked the mother. "He offered my father a ruby ring, mother, but he would not take it; and I heard him tell the Serpent King that as soon as he got back to earth, he would turn hermit." "Ah!" said the Brahmaness, "he has forsaken his wife and family all these long years, and I have had all the trouble of feeding the household, whilst he has been enjoying himself, and now he wants to become a hermit!" So in a furious passion she began to belabour her husband with the stirring stick, saying, "Heh! Brahman, what do you mean by coming back from Bh&ucirc;ridatta's country after refusing the wishing ring? You are going to be a hermit, are you? Very well, get out of my house sharp, will you!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brahman cried out, "Madam, do not get into such a passion; deer are not scarce in the forest. I will practise my calling as a hunter, and support you and your family." He then went off with his son into the forest.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time a Garu.la was perched on the top of a silk cotton tree in a forest on the shore of the southern ocean, flapping its wings, by which means it divided the waters and seized a N&acirc;ga that was below. In those days the Garu.las did not know the proper way of seizing a N&acirc;ga, and used to seize them by the head; but afterwards, through the advice of a hermit, which is related in the Pa.n.dara J&acirc;taka,<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> they learnt to seize

<P>In the country of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi, when Brahmadat was king, 500 sailors were wrecked in the sea, and, by the force of the wind, one of them was carried to Karampira harbour. On account of his emaciated body, people said, "This ascetic is a person of small requirements," so they kept him. Thinking that he was now well off, and to keep up his character, when they offered him garments he declined them. The people, thinking it was impossihle to find a more abstemious man, had a great regard for him and built him a cell, and he was known far and wide as the "Naked one of Karampira" (Karampira acelaka). A prince of the N&acirc;gas and a prince of the Garu.las used to come and worship him, and one day, when so engaged, the Garu.la said, "We Garu.las when catching N&acirc;gas are often destroyed by drowning, there must be some secret cause for this; when the N&acirc;ga comes, ask him the reason and let me know." The ascetic agreed, and when the N&acirc;ga came, he questioned him; and the N&acirc;ga said, "If I were to tell this, all the future generations of N&acirc;gas would be destroyed; but if you will promise not to reveal it, I will tell you." The ascetic promised, saying, "If I do, may my head be split in seven!" The N&acirc;ga then said, "When the Garu.las are going to swoop, we make ourselves a thousand cubits long and swallow a great rock and then show fight with our heads, so when the Garu.las seize our heads they cannot lift us and get drowned; but if the Garu.las seized us by the tail and held us upside down, we should vomit the rock." The hermit, however, did not keep his promise, but told the Garu.la. The Garu.la, therefore, went and seized the N&acirc;ga, and whilst he was being carried off, he told the Garu.la how he had been deceived. The Garu.la took pity on him, and telling him that it is always best to keep secrets, let him go. The N&acirc;ga then wished that the punishment of oath-breaking should befall the hermit, and immediately his head split into seven pieces and he went to Avici.]</SMALL></P>

them by the tail. This Garu.la, however, not knowing the right way, seized this N&acirc;ga by the head, and carried it off wriggling to the Himavanta forest. There was also at that time in the country of K&acirc;si an ascetic Brahman, who dwelt occasionally in a cell in the Himavanta, near which there was a great banyan tree, and as this hermit was sitting at the foot of the tree, the Garu.la flew past with the N&acirc;ga. The N&acirc;ga twisted its tail round the branches of the banyan tree, but the strength of the Garu.la was such that it carried off the tree with the N&acirc;ga, without being aware that it had done so. The Garu.la, perched in a tree, devoured the N&acirc;ga's entrails, and threw the body into the sea, whereupon the banyan tree fell with a crash. The Garu.la looked round to see what it was, and thought, "Why, this must have been the banyan tree, that grew by the hermit's cell. I must go and find out whether he is angry with me for what has been done." So he flew down to the hermit's cell, and, having taken up a reverent attitude, said, "O hermit, what is this level spot!" The hermit answered, "O Garu.la, my supporter, a Garu.la came flying by here with a N&acirc;ga, and as he passed the N&acirc;ga twisted its tail in the banyan tree and it was carried away." "Is the Garu.la to be blamed, O hermit?" "No, Garu.la, the N&acirc;ga did it in self-defence; and is not to be blamed." "Reverend Sir, I am that Garu.la, and I am much gratified at the manner in which you have replied to my questions; I know a charm that will keep

off all serpents, and will impart it to you for your kindness." The hermit answered, "I have no need for snake-charms, go in peace." But the Garu.la insisted and taught him the charm.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also at this time a poor Brahman in B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi who was sore pressed by his creditors, so he went out into the forest, saying, "It is better that I should die there than continuing to live in this wretched manner." In due course he came to this hermit's cell, and served the hermit in many ways, and in return the hermit imparted to him the snake-charm, which had been taught him by the Garu.la, and also gave him some of the medicine which had been given him. The poor Brahman, having now got a means of livelihood, stayed a day or two longer, and then saying he had got the rheumatism, and wanted to get medicine for it, took his departure. After a short time he arrived at the banks of the Yamun&acirc;, and went along the road repeating his charm. Just then a thousand of Bh&ucirc;ridatta's female attendants came, bringing with them the great wishing ruby, and, whilst they disported in the water, placed it on a sand-bank, to give forth its light during the watches of the night. At dawn they put on their ornaments, and, surrounding the great ruby, displayed their splendour. As the Brahman came up, the N&acirc;gas heard him reciting his charm, and, thinking he was a Garu.la, fled, leaving the ruby, on seeing which the Brahman was delighted and carried it off.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then the Brahman, Nes&acirc;da, and his son, Somadatta, came out of the forest, and, seeing the Brahman carrying the ruby, he said, "Dear Somadat, is not this the ruby that the Prince Bh&ucirc;ridat offered us?" "Yes, father, it is the very same." "Then (said Nes&acirc;da) we will get it by stratagem, for he does not know its value." Somadatta answered, "Father, when Prince Bh&ucirc;ridatta offered it to you, you refused it; why do you want it now? Perhaps the Brahman will be too sharp for you. Do not speak to to him, but keep still." But Nes&acirc;da answered, "That may be, but just see how we shall both try to get round one another."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said Nes&acirc;da, "O snake-charmer, the nature of rubies is such that if one looks after and honours them, they bring great luck to their owners; but if they are not well looked after, they bring harm. You are not the sort of person to carry about a ruby, sell it me for a hundred pieces of gold. I know how to treat it."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said Somadatta; "I will flee from thee, for I cannot remain with one who can do such evil deeds." So with a mighty cry he called on the Devas to witness that he could no longer remain with so base a father, and fled into the Himavanta forest, where he became a hermit and attained so much merit that he at last migrated to the Brahma heavens.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nes&acirc;da, thinking that his son had gone home, and that the snake-charmer was heavy of heart, said, "Friend snake-charmer, do not be unhappy, I will show you Bh&ucirc;ridatta the N&acirc;ga Prince." He then took him to where Bh&ucirc;ridatta was fasting, and when they got there, and saw him on the top of the ant hill, he stopped and said, pointing at him:</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD VALIGN="top">62. </TD><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take thou then this mighty serpent, bring to me thy precious jewel,<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Bh&ucirc;ridatta opened his eyes, and beholding Nes&acirc;da, thought, "That man wishes to do me a mischief whilst I am fasting. I took both him and his son to N&acirc;ga-land, and when they wished to depart, I offered them precious stones, but he would not take them, and now he has come with this snake-charmer. If I were to show my wrath to this Brahman, who is so treacherous to his friends, my

fasting would be of no avail. It is better to pursue this course of religious duties than to be irritated. If this serpent-charmer wishes to cut me in twain, let him do so: if he desires to cook me, he may do so; or toast me on a spit, he may do so: I will not be angry. If I were to look at those two, in my wrath, they would melt like cakes of honey; but I will not, and if they smite me, yet will I not be enraged." Then, closing his eyes in fixed determination, he withdrew his head into his coils and lay motionless.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said Nes&acirc;da again, "Snake-charmer, seize this serpent and give me the ruby." Whereupon the snake-charmer in delight threw him the ruby, saying, "Take it, brother." But the ruby slipped through his fingers and falling to the earth, disappeared, going back to serpent-land. When Nes&acirc;da saw that the ruby was gone and his son too, and that he had also lost his friend Bh&ucirc;ridatta, he said, "Alas! I have greatly erred in not listening to the advice of my son," and he wept bitterly.<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake-charmer then, having smeared himself all over with ointment to protect him, and having recited his charm, approached the Bodhisat, and seizing him by the tail, grasped him firmly by the head. He then opened his mouth, and having put drugs into it, spat into it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bodhisat, however, for fear that he might lose the merit of his religious duties, remained unangered and with closed eyes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the snake-charmer held him by the tail,and shaking his head downwards, caused him to vomit, and then laying him at full length, kneaded him like a piece of leather.

<P><SMALL>[1. The Mandalay MS. does not give S. 64.]</SMALL></P>

Then again taking him by the tail he banged him up and down, like one who washes clothes. Still, though the Bodhisat underwent all this misery, he showed no anger. The snake-charmer having thus taken all the strength out of him, and woven a basket of canes, put him into it. As the body of the N&acirc;ga Prince was larger than the basket, the snake-charmer pressed him into it with his heel, and having thus forced him into it, carried him off to the neighbouring village, where he summoned the people to see a performance. When the people were assembled, he cried out, "Come forth, prince of serpents." The Bodhisat, thinking that it would be better to come out and dance, so that the Brahman might get a considerable amount of money, and then release him, came forth and did all that the snake-charmer ordered him to do. When the people saw him go through this performance, there was not a dry eye amongst them, and they threw their gold and silver ornaments to the Brahman: and in that village alone he got property worth a thousand pieces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it happened that when the snake-charmer caught Bh&ucirc;ridatta, he had determined to let him go again, after he had accumulated a thousand pieces of silver; but being a covetous man, he broke this good intention, and having made a handsome decorated cage and purchased a comfortable carriage, he went from town to town, surrounded by many followers, and at last arrived at the city of B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi. He fed Bh&ucirc;ridatta on parched corn and honey, and caught frogs for him, but the Bodhisat refused to eat, seeing that he would not be released; however, the snake-charmer made him dance in all the quarters of the city. On the 15th day of the month, which was a holiday, he obtained permission to give a performance before the R&acirc;j&acirc;, and tiers of seats were erected on the plain before the palace.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the day that Bh&ucirc;ridatta was caught, his mother, Samuddaj&acirc;, dreamt that "A man, with red eyes, cut off her right arm with a sword and carried it away streaming with blood." She sprang up in terror, feeling for her arm,

but finding it was there, knew that it was only a dream. Then she thought this evil dream must portend some great calamity to her or her husband, and said, "Verily, I am in great fear for my son Bh&ucirc;ridatta, for all the others are in N&acirc;ga-land, but he has gone to fast in the country of men: I fear that he has been seized by a snake-charmer, or a Garu.la." On the 15th day after this dream she thought. "It is more than half a month since Bh&ucirc;ridatta came here; I feel certain some evil has befallen him." So she began to weep, and her heart dried up with grief. She was always gazing on the road expecting to see him come. After a month had expired her eldest son, Sudassana, came to see her, but on account of her grief she said nothing to him. So Sudassana, seeing how different his reception was, said:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when Bh&ucirc;ridatta's wives were unable to find him at his place on the ant hill, they were not alarmed, but thought he had probably gone to see his mother, and being on the way to inquire, they met her on the road, and told her that he had been absent for more than half a moon, and thought he had gone to her. When they found this was not the case, they fell at her feet weeping. His mother joining in their lamentations, went with them up into his palace, saying:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Bhoga and Ari.t.tha, the younger brethren, were coming to pay their respects to their parents, they heard the sound of the wailing, and came to Bh&ucirc;ridatta's palace to comfort their mother, saying, "Mother, be comforted; no mortal can escape the law of death and destruction."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mother replied, "Dear sons, I know that all that exists is destroyed, but, nevertheless, I am terribly disturbed at not seeing Bh&ucirc;ridatta. Dear Sudassana, if I see not my son Bh&ucirc;ridatta, I shall die this very night."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princes answered, "Dear mother, be not afraid, we will go into the forest, the mountains, the caves, the villages, towns, cities, and everywhere in search of Bh&ucirc;ridatta. You shall see him within seven days."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudassana said, "If we search together, the search will be long; we will separate and search in different directions. One of us will go to the Deva-land, one to Himavanta, and one to the country of men." As K&acirc;.n&acirc;ri.t.tha was fierce, he thought it best not to send him amongst men, for he might reduce everything to ashes; so he said, "Brother Ari.t.tha, do you go to Deva-land, and as the Devas are desirous of hearing the law, without fail bring him thence."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then directed S&ucirc;bhoga to go to Himavanta, saying that he himself would go to the land of men. Then he thought, "If I go as a youth, men will think nought of me; but if I go as a hermit, they will respect me, for the children of men love hermits." Thereupon he took the form of a hermit and took leave of his mother.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Bh&ucirc;ridatta had a cousin<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> who was very fond of him, named Ajamukh&icirc;.<SUP><SMALL>[2]</SMALL></SUP> She loved him better than all her other cousins, and seeing Sudassana about to depart, she said, "Cousin, I am very sad, let me accompany you in your search for Bh&ucirc;ridatta!" He answered, "Child, I am going disguised as a hermit, and it will not do for a woman to go with me." Then she said, "I will take the form of a frog and go in your hair-knot." On his agreeing to this Ajamukh&icirc; took the form of a frog, and stowed herself away in Sudassana's top-knot.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudassana then caused Bh&ucirc;ridatta's wives to show him the ant hill, and when he saw traces of blood, and the spot where the snake-charmer had woven the cage of cane and bamboo, he said, "Without doubt my brother has been taken by a snake-charmer, who is ill-treating him." So in great sorrow he tracked the bloodstains and footprints until he came to the village where the first performance was held. On questioning the villagers, as to whether any snake-charmer had been there, he was told that one had been there about a month previously. On asking if he had taken any money, they said, "O yes, he is quite a rich man, for he got about a thousand pieces of silver here." So they went on making inquiries until they came to the King's palace. Just at this moment the snake-charmer, who had bathed and dressed himself, had taken up his cage and gone to the gate of the palace, and the people of the city were assembled to see the performance. The snake-charmer spread out a magnificent carpet, placed his cage open upon it, and playing on his drum, cried out, "Come forth, great

N&acirc;ga." Sudassana, standing in the crowd, saw the serpent-prince raise his head and gaze at the crowd. Now there are two occasions on which N&acirc;gas are wont to gaze; first, when they are in fear of Garu.las: second, when they see a friend.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bodhisat, seeing his brother in the crowd disguised as a hermit, came out of the cage with his eyes streaming with tears, and went straight towards his brother. The people stood aside with fear, but Sudassana kept his place. The serpent, laying his head on Sudassana's instep, wept. Sudassana also wept.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pits were dug, Sudassana filled one with drugs, the middle one he ordered to be filled with cow dung, and into the third he put some fairy medicines.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake-charmer was standing near the holes, and the flames taking hold of him, his skin peeled off, so that he became a white leper, on which, in his terror, he cried out thrice, "I release the N&acirc;ga King."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King replied, "Very good, go quickly, but I, too, should like to see my sister. How can it be managed?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sudassana asked after his grandfather, and the R&acirc;j&acirc; told him that he was so terrified that the day after he had given Samuddaj&acirc; in marriage, he had relinquished his kingdom and become a hermit. Sudassana then told the R&acirc;j&acirc; that if he would appoint a day, they would bring their mother to meet him at their grandfather's hermitage.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bh&ucirc;ridatta returned, the whole country was convulsed with weeping, and he, being much distressed by a month's confinement in the snake-charmer's basket, retired to sleep in his palace.

Just at that moment Subhoga arrived there too, and, hearing Nes&acirc;da make his confession, said, "This is the wretch who, through covetousness for my brother's ruby, not content with the great wealth that he had offered him, pointed him out to the snake-charmer.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the assembled N&acirc;gas heard this discourse, they were delighted and gave praise. Then Bh&ucirc;ridatta caused them to turn the Brahman Nes&acirc;da out of serpent-land. R&acirc;j&acirc; S&acirc;gara Br&acirc;hmadatta, on the appointed day, surrounded by his whole army, went to the place where his father was residing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bh&ucirc;ridatta caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum throughout the whole of N&acirc;ga-land, that he proposed visiting his grandfather and uncle: and going forth from the river Yamun&acirc; with a great retinue and splendour, in due course, he arrived at his grandfather's hermitage. His parents and brethren followed after him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When S&acirc;gara Bh&ucirc;ridatta saw the Bodhisat coming with his attendants, he did not recognize him, but said to his father in the following stanzas (185 to 198):</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O hermit, my father, who, I pray, is this who comes with drums and other musical instruments playing before him? Whose face and crown is it that flashes like lightning? He is young indeed, but his glory flashes forth like gold flowing from the furnace? Who is he? His white umbrella delighteth the heart like Jamb&ucirc;raj gold. Those waving c&acirc;m&acirc;ris,<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> whose are they? and whose the splendidly jewelled peacock fans?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his father answered (199), "Dear son, this is no other than your nephew, the son of Dhatara.t.tha, King of the N&acirc;gas: those others are also his men; their power is very great and their hosts are many. They are also the sons of my daughter Samuddaj&acirc;."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst they were thus talking, the company of the N&acirc;gas arrived and sat down in a suitable place. Samuddaj&acirc;, after doing reverence to her father, returned weeping to N&acirc;ga-land. Br&acirc;hmadatta remained two or three days and then returned to B&acirc;r&acirc;.nasi. Samuddaj&acirc; died in N&acirc;ga-land, and Bh&ucirc;ridatta continued his fasts for the rest of his life, and when he died he went to Deva-land with all his followers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Teacher then summed up the J&acirc;taka as follows:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bh&ucirc;ridatta's parents were reborn of royal race; the hunter Nes&acirc;da became Devadatta; his son Somadatta became &Acirc;nanda; Ajamukh&icirc; is now Upalava.m.sa; Sudassena is Sariputtar&acirc;; Subhoga is Moggal&acirc;na; K&acirc;.n&acirc;ri.t.tha became Sunnakkhat (Sunakkhatto, a Prince of the Licchavi) and Bh&ucirc;ridatta is myself, the incomparable and omniscient Buddha.</P>
