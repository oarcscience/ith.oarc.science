<BLOCKQUOTE>ART. IV.--<I>The Tattva-muktav&acirc;l&icirc; of Gau.da-p&ucirc;r.n&acirc;nanda-chakra-vartin</I>. Edited and Translated by Prof. E. B. COWELL.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>THE following poem was written by a native of Bengal, named P&ucirc;r.n&acirc;nanda Chakravartin. Nothing is known as to his date; if the work were identical with the poem of the same name mentioned in the account of the R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja system in M&acirc;dhava's Sarvadar&#353;anasa.mgraha, it would be, of course, older than the fourteenth century, but this is very uncertain; I should be inclined to assign it to a later date. The chief interest of the poem consists in its being a vigorous attack on the Ved&acirc;nta system by a follower of the P&ucirc;r.napraj&ntilde;a school, which was founded by Madhva (or &Acirc;nandat&icirc;rtha) in the thirteenth century in the South of India. Some account of his system (which in many respects agrees with that of R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja) is given in Wilson's "Hindu Sects;"<A NAME="page_137_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_137_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> but the fullest account is to be found in the fifth chapter of the Sarvadar&#353;anasa.mgraha. Both the R&acirc;m&acirc;nujas and the P&ucirc;r.napraj&ntilde;as hold in opposition to the Ved&acirc;nta<A NAME="page_137_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_137_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> that individual souls are distinct from Brahman; but they differ as to the sense in which they are thus distinct. The former

<!------------------------page 138------------------------>

<A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A>

maintain that "unity" and "plurality" are equally true from different points of view; the latter hold that the relation between the individual soul and Brahman is that of a master and a servant, and consequently that they are absolutely separate. It need not surprise us, therefore, to see that, although R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja is praised in the fifty-third sloka of this poem as "the foremost of the learned," some of his tenets are attacked in the eightieth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanskrit text of this poem was published in the Benares Pa.n.dit for Sept. 1871, by Pa.n.dit Vech&acirc;r&acirc;ma &#352;arman. An edition, with a Bengali translation, was also published some years ago in Calcutta, by Jagad&acirc;nanda Gosw&acirc;min;<A NAME="page_138_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_138_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> but the text is so full of false readings of every kind, and the translation in consequence goes so often astray, that I have not found much help from it. I have collated the text in the Benares Pa.n.dit (A.) with a MS. (B.) sent to me by my friend, Pa.n.dit Mahe&#353;achandra Ny&acirc;yaratna, the Principal of the Calcutta Sanskrit College. He has also sent me the readings in certain passages from two MSS. in the Calcutta Sanskrit College Library (C.D.); and I have to thank him for his help in explaining some obscure allusions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poem itself seems to me an interesting contribution to the history of Hindu philosophical controversy,<A NAME="page_138_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_138_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> and so I have subjoined a literal English translation. I would venture to remind my readers of the words of the manager in the prologue of the M&acirc;lavik&acirc;gnimitra, "Every old poem is not good because it is old, nor is every modern poem to be blamed simply because it is modern."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. Victorious is the garland-wearing foster-son of Nanda,--the protector of his devotees,--the destroyer of the cruel king,--dark-blue like the delicate tam&acirc;la blossoms,--formidable with his many outspread rays,--mighty with all his attendant powers,<A NAME="page_155_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_155_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>--and having his forehead radiant like the moon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. This follower of the Pur&acirc;.nas, who holds by his own belief, reads to his heart's content the Pur&acirc;.na in the morning, and he listens devotedly with profound meditation, his whole mind intent on the meaning of the book.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_3"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT>. Having abandoned the doctrine of the oneness of the individual and the Supreme Soul, he establishes by argument their mutual difference; having used &#352;ruti and &#352;m.riti as a manifold proof, he employs Inference in many ways in the controversy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_4"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT>. This individual soul must be different from Brahman because it is always circumscribed,--many are the similar arguments which are to be acknowledged in the course of our reasonings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_5"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>5</FONT>. "Might we not say that a jar and a web could be called identical because both are cognizable?"<A NAME="page_155_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_155_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> But we cannot say so in regard to these two things in question, for Brahman alone is that which cannot be cognized.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_6"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>6</FONT>. The sentence "Thou art That" (<I>tat tvam asi</I>) which is understood in its primary meaning as referring to the object of the Veda,<A NAME="page_155_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_155_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>--the author thus explains its meaning, as he knows his own doctrine, and has fixed his mind on the system of Duality; since the word 'that' (<I>tat</I>) is here indeclinable and implies a difference, and the word 'thou' (<I>tvam</I>) means that which is to be differentiated, the sign of the genitive case has been elided;<A NAME="page_155_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_155_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> "thou only," such is not the meaning of the sentence.<A NAME="page_155_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_155_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<!------------------------page 156------------------------>

<A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_7"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>7</FONT>. He is all-knowing, all-seeing, Himself the three worlds, in whose belly thou art thyself contained,--He causes at once by a movement of the brow the creation, preservation, and absorption of all beings! Thou art ignorant, and only seest relatively, He is the adorable, the one Witness of all worlds; thou art changing, He is One; thou art all dull and stained, not such is He.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_8"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>8</FONT>. As for the text "I am Brahman," you must take the nominative case as only used there for the genitive by the licence of an inspired speaker. How, if it were otherwise, would there be a genitive in the illustration,<A NAME="page_156_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_156_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> as in the sentence "as the sparks of the fire"?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_9"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>9</FONT>. The poets call a lad fire (from his hot temper), the face the orb of a full moon, the eye a blue lotus, the bosom mount Meru, and the hand a young shoot; by a confusion of the superimposed appearance we may thus have the idea of identity where there is still a real difference; and so too must we deal with those words of &#352;ruti "I am Brahman."<A NAME="page_156_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_156_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_10"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>10</FONT>. As there are many waves in the sea, so are we many individual souls in Brahman; the wave can never become the sea; how then wilt thou, the individual soul, become Brahman?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_11"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>11</FONT>. In the depths of all &#352;&acirc;stras the two things are both recognized, knowledge and ignorance; so too virtue and vice; and thus also science, and next to it closely clinging behind, but other than it, appears false science; thus everywhere there are opposite pairs, and similar is the notorious pair, Brahman and the soul. How can these two have oneness? Let the good answer with an upright mind.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_12"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>12</FONT>. Thou, O Soul, art the reflection of the Supreme Being, who possesses the power of illusion and is the substratum of

<!------------------------page 157------------------------>

<A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A>

all, while He, the adorable, shines forth as Himself the original; the one moon in the sky is seen manifold in water and the like; therefore there is a difference between thee and Brahman as between the reflection and its original.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_13"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>13</FONT>. Yonder Brahman is described by the words of the sacred texts as not to be known, nor to be reasoned about, and as devoid of all desire; but thou art within the range of speech and of thought; how shall there be oneness of thee and Brahman?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_14"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>14</FONT>. Thou art verily bereft of thy understanding, O individual Soul, by the darkness of this doctrine of M&acirc;y&acirc;, while thou constantly proclaimest like a madman "I am Brahman"; where is thy sovereignty, where thy empire, where thy omniscience? There is as vast a difference between Brahman and thee as between mount Meru and a mustard-seed!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_15"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>15</FONT>. Thou art a finite soul, He is indeed all-pervading; thou standest only on one spot, while He is everywhere always; thou, being of a moment, art happy and unhappy; He is happy at all times; how canst thou say "I am He"? Fie! art thou not ashamed?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_16"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>16</FONT>. Glass is glass, and a gem is a gem; a shell is but a shell, and silver is silver; there is never seen a transposition<A NAME="page_157_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_157_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> among them. But wherever other things are imagined, to be found in something else, it is through an error; and so it is when the soul utters such words as "that art thou!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_17"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>17</FONT>. The meaning of the word "<I>that</I>" (<I>tat</I>) is an ocean of immortality, filled with manifest and supreme felicity; the meaning of the word "<I>thou</I>" is a most miserable being, bewildered in mind through the burden of the fear of existence; these two can never be one, they are divided by the nature of things; the doctrine of Non-unity is the truth for all worlds, thou art but His slave.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_18"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>18</FONT>. If Brahman were meant by these words, the power employed would not be Denotation, for their literal meaning

<!------------------------page 158------------------------>

<A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A>

does not apply;<A NAME="page_158_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_158_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> consequently it must be the second power of a word, Indication.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_19"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>19</FONT>. Yet if so, why should it be Indication? for this arises from some association with the primary meaning; but with what can that substance be associated which is disconnected with everything and without a second?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_20"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>20</FONT>. That power of a word is Indication, by which, when the primary meaning is precluded, some other meaning is indicated in connexion therewith, through some motive or through common currency; and its causes are thus three.<A NAME="page_158_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_158_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_21"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>21</FONT>. Now if there is no Denotation in a phrase, how can there arise any Indication? First there should be some primary meaning precluded, and then there may be the Indication of something else.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_22"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>22</FONT>. Where there is no accepted Denotation, how can you there have Indication? If there is no village, how can there be a boundary?--there is no child without a father.<A NAME="page_158_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_158_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_23"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>23</FONT>. "The lances enter, the swords, the bows and arrows,"--here we have Indication; for the sentence must suggest something else to complete itself, as there cannot be "entrance" in the case of an inanimate subject.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_24"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>24</FONT>. "A herd-station on the Ganges,"--here we have the self-sacrifice of the primary to another meaning, since the Ganges, as being in the form of water, cannot be the site of a herd-station.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_25"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>25</FONT>. In the example "gh&icirc; is life" there is produced the

<!------------------------page 159------------------------>

<A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A>

idea of sameness of form; in the example "this is life" there arises the idea of identity;<A NAME="page_159_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_159_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> but the knowledge of the meaning of the sentences will be produced by a metaphor,--there is not brought about a real oneness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_26"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>26</FONT>. The doctrine of Identity is established with a desperate effort, and men have recourse to the power "Indication"; but there are three things which should rise to our view,--the primary meaning, the indicated meaning, and their connexion.<A NAME="page_159_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_159_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_27"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>27</FONT>. There is here no Denotation from the absence of conventional agreement; there is no Indication from the absence of any reason [to establish it]; by what reason, on the theory of M&acirc;y&acirc;, can Brahman be ever made known?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_28"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>28</FONT>. He is described<A NAME="page_159_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_159_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> in the Veda by the primary power of words [Denotation] as the Maker of the Universe; and by Inference we establish the conclusion that all these things have a Maker.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_29"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>29</FONT>. The Vedas are a proof, the &#352;m.ritis are a proof; there is a being to be proved and known there in many passages; it is the great Personality which is to be made known by all the Vedas,--therefore it is this which the Veda takes as its subject.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_30"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>30</FONT>. True verbal testimony produces knowledge even in regard to that which is absolutely non-existent,--then how much more in regard to Brahman the Lord, the maker of all that moves or is motionless!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_31"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>31</FONT>. It is said,<A NAME="page_159_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_159_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> "Speech retires therefrom together with the Mind,"--but this is its explanation,--give ear: Together with the Mind Speech makes Him its object, and then retires, because His nature is not to be fathomed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_32"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>32</FONT>. "Brahman is not to be made the object of mind or of

<!------------------------page 160------------------------>

<A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A>

words,"<A NAME="page_160_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_160_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>--from this saying it is understood that he is only to be declared by Revelation, Revelation has no faltering action.<A NAME="page_160_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_160_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_33"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>33</FONT>. "He who is versed in the Word-Brahman attains to the highest Brahman,"<A NAME="page_160_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_160_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>--surely such words of inspired sages are not mistaken babble.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_34"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>34</FONT>. Assuredly the conventional meaning of the words "existent," "thought," and "joy" applies to Brahman, just as the words "pot," "cloth," etc., refer to those particular objects.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_35"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>35</FONT>. The perception of the conventional meaning of words is aroused by the dialogue of the orderer and the ordered; and afterwards by insertion and omission the child becomes thoroughly skilled in the use of the words.<A NAME="page_160_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_160_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_36"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>36</FONT>. So through hearing the words of the teacher and repeated study of the &#353;&acirc;stras the conventional meaning of such words as Brahman, etc., is assuredly produced in the pupil.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_37"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>37</FONT>. This earth must surely have had a maker; for its having the nature of an effect is a sign, just as we see to be the case in pots, etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_38"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>38</FONT>. If it is established that the supreme Lord is the maker, then his having a body follows as a matter of course;<A NAME="page_160_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_160_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A> for in all effects, as pots and the like, the maker is seen to have a body and not to be bodiless.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_39"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>39</FONT>. [The objector urges] "If the supreme Lord has a body, then he will be like to beings such as we are; there cannot be a maker without an intermediate agency,<A NAME="page_160_fr_6"></A><A HREF="#page_160_note_6"><SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP></A>--I see no difference whatever."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_40"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>40</FONT>. But great is the difference which is declared to exist between the Adorable Lord and men working with spades,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_41"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>41</FONT>. The Master can make, not make,<A NAME="page_161_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_161_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> and alter; hence one may learn that vast is the interval between the two.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_42"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>42</FONT>. If the body is called the site of enjoyment, it is well known that this definition will hold good [even in this highest case<A NAME="page_161_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_161_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>],--there is nothing deficient but everything is present in the Lord's body,<A NAME="page_161_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_161_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A> since He is the husband of Lakshm&icirc;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_43"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>43</FONT>. "Every body is influenced by deserts,"--if this universal law is accepted, then He who is the Maker of all must be impelled [to create the world] by the deserts which dominate over beings like us.<A NAME="page_161_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_161_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_44"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>44</FONT>. "Every body must be non-eternal,"--this is a general law, yet still &Icirc;&#353;vara's body may be eternal; for earth is everywhere seen to be non-eternal, while in the form of its atoms it is eternal.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_45"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>45</FONT>. One must not say, "why should the desert of one attach itself to another?" For it was in consequence of the respective merits and demerits of the elephant and the crocodile that the holder of the discus made all haste to interfere in the battle.<A NAME="page_161_fr_6"></A><A HREF="#page_161_note_6"><SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_46"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>46</FONT>. It has been heard of old that all this universe proceeded from the lotus of the navel of the Lord; hence is it established that be has a body, for how can there be a navel without a body?</P>

<A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_47"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>47</FONT>. The body of God is very pure,--to be enjoyed by all the senses, as being richly endowed with the six qualities,<A NAME="page_162_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_162_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>--and to be discovered by means of all the Vedas,--Gang&acirc; verily is the water wherewith he washes his feet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_48"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>48</FONT>. Whenever by the influence of time there comes the increase of evil and the diminution of right, then the adorable Lord accomplishes the preservation of the good and the destruction of the wicked.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_49"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>49</FONT>. The Lord is said to be twofold, as the Incarnation and He who becomes incarnate; so too the souls are twofold, as divided into faithful and faithless.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_50"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>50</FONT>. Now some say that the personal soul is only the reflection of the Supreme; but their opinion does not at all hold, since it cannot be established.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_51"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>51</FONT>. For how could there arise a reflection of that Infinite and stainless one? and how could an insentient [reflection] enjoy the pain and pleasure arising from the merit and demerit declared in the Veda?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_52"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>52</FONT>. There may indeed be a reflection of that which is limited; but how shall there be one of Him whose attribute is infinity?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_53"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>53</FONT>. R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja, the foremost of the learned, condemned this theory of an original and its reflection; the fact that this doctrine is not accepted by the learned, will not make it seem more plausible.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_54"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>54</FONT>. There is an eternal division between the two, from the words of the Veda, "two birds;"<A NAME="page_162_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_162_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> from the mention there of "two friends," how can there be identity between them?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_55"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>55</FONT>. I become Brahman, that is, I cease to have mundane existence through beholding the soul in Brahman; the result of this would be the abolition of sorrow, etc., but in no way absolute Oneness.</P>

On the neck of the faithful may this Tattvamukt&acirc;val&icirc;<A NAME="page_173_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_173_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> abide for ever,--whose beauty is increased by the apt arrangement of sweet and soft words but which is free from rhetorical ornaments,--beautiful with a profusion of sentences sweet like milk, and with its parts all bright and elegant,--a special source of delight to the intelligent,--charming with a host of excellences and devoid of even the trace of a fault.</P>

S. according to their respective relation to the Ved&acirc;nta, we can easily understand why M&acirc;dhava there places these two systems so low down in the scale, and only just above the atheistic schools of the Ch&acirc;rv&acirc;kas, Buddhists, and Jainas.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_155_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_155_fr_1">1</A>. The Bengali translation explains these as the internal powers (<I>antara"ng&acirc;</I>) Hl&acirc;din&icirc;, etc., and the external (<I>bahira"ng&acirc;</I>) Prahv&acirc;, etc.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_155_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_155_fr_2">2</A>. There is a favourite Naiy&acirc;yik example of a <I>keval&acirc;nvayi</I> middle term, "a jar is nameable because it is cognizable as a web is."</P>

<P><A NAME="page_155_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_155_fr_3">3</A>. Or <I>vedavishaye</I> may perhaps simply mean <I>vede</I>, cf. &#353;l. 112.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_155_note_4"></A><A HREF="#page_155_fr_4">4</A>. The author here explains the sentence <I>tat tvam asi</I>, as really meaning <I>tasya tvam asi</I> "thou art Its."</P>

<P><A NAME="page_155_note_5"></A><A HREF="#page_155_fr_5">5</A>. In "Thou art that," 'thou' and 'that' would refer to the same subject (<I>s&acirc;m&acirc;n&acirc;dhikara.nya</I>).</P>

<P><A NAME="footnotes_page_156"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN SIZE="1">p. 156</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="page_156_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_156_fr_1">1</A>. This is often used as an illustration in Ved&acirc;nta works, as <I>e.g.</I> B.rihad &Acirc;ra.ny. Up. ii. 1. 20, "as the spider proceeds with his web, as the little sparks proceed from fire, so from this Soul proceed all vital airs, all worlds, all gods, all beings."</P>

<P><A NAME="page_156_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_156_fr_2">2</A>. This is another suggested method of interpreting the words "I am Brahman." It may be only a common case of "qualified superimponent indication," as "the man of the Panj&acirc;b is an ox" (cf. K&acirc;vya Prak&acirc;&#353;a, ii. 10-12). Cf. the definition of upach&acirc;ra in the S&acirc;hitya Darpa.na: <I>upach&acirc;ro hi n&acirc;m&acirc;tyanta.m vi&#353;akalitayoh &#353;&acirc;d.ri&#353;y&acirc;ti&#353;ayamahimn&acirc; bhedaprat&icirc;tisthaganam&acirc;tram</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_157_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_157_fr_1">1</A>. Dr. Banerjea (<I>Dialogues</I>, p. 379) reads <I>kad&acirc;py atyayaj&ntilde;&acirc;nam, i.e.</I> vyabhich&acirc;ra; but all the MSS. which I have compared read <I>na kad&acirc; vyatyaya</I> (or <I>vyatyaya.m</I>) <I>j&ntilde;&acirc;nam</I>; <I>kad&acirc;</I> seems irregularly used for <I>kad&acirc;pi</I>, as it is also in &#353;l. 113, <I>c</I>.</P>

<!----------------------footnotes page 158------------------------>

<P><A NAME="footnotes_page_158"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN SIZE="1">p. 158</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="page_158_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_158_fr_1">1</A>. In such sentences as "That art thou," "I am Brahman," etc., the primary power of the words, <I>i.e.</I> "Denotation" (<I>abhidh&acirc;</I>), could not express the unconditioned Brahman destitute of all attributes; for Denotation rests upon the ordinary conventional meaning, and how could this take in an idea so far removed from ordinary experience? Nor could it be the secondary power "Indication" (<I>laksha.n&acirc;</I>), as in the well-known instance of "the herd-station on the Ganges," where the Ganges, by "indication," means the shore and not the stream. For "indication" must be based on some connexion between the primary and the indicated secondary meaning; but how can that which is "without a second" be connected with anything?</P>

<P><A NAME="page_158_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_158_fr_2">2</A>. I suppose that these are (1) the incompatibility of the primary sense; (2) the common currency of the secondary meaning, <I>e.g.</I> when "Europe" is used to imply its inhabitants in the phrase "Europe makes war:" (3) a motive, as in "a herd-station on the Ganges," where "Ganges" is used instead of "the bank of the Ganges," in order to imply the coolness and purity of the spot.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_158_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_158_fr_3">3</A>. Cf. the Bengali proverb <I>m&acirc;th&acirc; n&acirc;i t&acirc;r m&acirc;th&acirc;byath&acirc;</I>, "he has no head and yet he has a headache."</P>

In the first ex. there is <I>&#353;uddha-s&acirc;ropa-laksha.n&acirc;</I> or "pure superimponent indication," in the second there is <I>&#353;uddha-s&acirc;dhyavas&acirc;na-l.</I> or "pure introspeceptive indication," where the gh&icirc; is swallowed up in the "life." Most writers, however, disallow <I>upach&acirc;ra</I> in <I>&#353;uddha-laksha.n&acirc;</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_159_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_159_fr_2">2</A>. He seems to imply that each of these three requisites fails in the present case,--there is no primary meaning, and still less a secondary, and there is no connexion with any other object.</P>

"On the old man's saying, when giving directions to the middle-aged man," etc. The S&acirc;hitya D. uses the terms <I>&acirc;v&acirc;poddh&acirc;rau</I>, the Siddh&acirc;ntamukt&acirc;val&icirc; (p. 80) uses <I>&acirc;v&acirc;podv&acirc;pan</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_161_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_161_fr_2">2</A>. With this curious use of <I>akartum</I> (extending the analogy of such forms as <I>akurvan</I>, <I>ak.ritv&acirc;</I>, etc.) cf. Theognis, 621: {Greek: <I>pas tis plo&uacute;sion &aacute;ndpa t&iacute;ei at&iacute;ei d&egrave; penixr&oacute;n</I>}. Cf. Shilleto, Cambridge Journ. of Philology, 1876, p. 161.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_161_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_161_fr_3">3</A>. Could <I>loke</I> mean that it will hold good "of the world" as his body?</P>

<P><A NAME="page_161_note_5"></A><A HREF="#page_161_fr_5">5</A>. <I>I.e.</I> he creates the world to give their deserts to the different souls.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_161_note_6"></A><A HREF="#page_161_fr_6">6</A>. The objector urges "why should our good or evil deserts oblige God to act in a certain way?" He answers by referring to the well-known legend given in the Bh&acirc;gavata Pur&acirc;.na, viii. ch. 2-4. A certain king, named Indradyumna, became an elephant through Agastya's curse. One day, while drinking in a lake, he was seized by a crocodile, and the struggle lasted for a thousand years. At last, in despair, he prayed to Vish.nu, who came down mounted on Garu.da and killed the crocodile. Thus we see that, although in one sense the deserts of one being cannot attach themselves to another, still they must cause certain actions in another being, or it would be impossible that each should receive its due reward or punishment.</P>

These six qualities, according to the Commentator on the Bh&acirc;gavata P. i. 3. 36, are sovereignty, knowledge, glory, prosperity, dispassion, and virtue; a different list is given in the Sarva Dar&#353;.

<P><A NAME="page_163_note_4"></A><A HREF="#page_163_fr_4">4</A>. In Ved&acirc;nta S. i. 2. 4, it is shown that certain passages in the Upanishads refer to Brahman and not the embodied soul, "because of the application therein of the terms object and agent;" as <I>e.g.</I> in the passage of the Chh&acirc;ndogya Upan. iii. 14, "I shall attain it when I have departed from hence." These words imply an agent who attains and also an object which is attained, <I>i.e.</I> Brahman. &#352;a"nkara in his comment on i. 2. 11 illustrates this by the passage in the Katha Upanishad iii. 1, "The two, drinking the due reward from their works, in this world entered the cave, in the highest place of the supreme soul" (sc. the heart).</P>

<P><A NAME="page_163_note_5"></A><A HREF="#page_163_fr_5">5</A>. Cf. Ved&acirc;nta S&ucirc;tras i. 2. 6, where &#352;a"nkara quotes the passage from the Bhagavad G&icirc;t&acirc; (xviii. 61), "The Lord of all beings abides in the region of the heart,--causing all beings to revolve by his illusion as though mounted on a machine."</P>

<P><A NAME="page_163_note_6"></A><A HREF="#page_163_fr_6">6</A>. He uses this very expression <I>up&acirc;syop&acirc;sakabh&acirc;va</I> in his Comment. on i. 2. 4.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_164_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_164_fr_2">2</A>. I suppose that this means that the <I>dvandva</I> compound <I>d.rishadupala</I> has some analogy to one like <I>j&icirc;v&acirc;tm&acirc;nau</I>, which involves identity, as the upper and lower millstone form one instrument; but there (in accordance with P&acirc;.n. 2. 2. 34, <I>v&acirc;rtt.</I>) the less important word meaning the upper and smaller stone (<I>upal&acirc;</I>) is placed last (cf. 2. 2. 31).</P>

<P><A NAME="page_164_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_164_fr_3">3</A>. But <I>j&icirc;v&acirc;tm&acirc;nau</I> is a <I>dvandva</I>, not a <I>karmadh&acirc;raya</I> compound.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_166_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_166_fr_2">2</A>. This is an attack on R&acirc;m&acirc;nuja's system, as opposed to that of P&ucirc;r.napraj&ntilde;a or Madhva, cf. Sarva-dar&#353;ana S. p. 52, l. 20, "What is the real truth? The real truth is plurality, unity, and both. Thus unity is admitted in saying that Brahman alone subsists in all forms as all is its body; both unity and plurality are admitted in saying that one only Brahman subsists under a plurality of forms, diverse as soul and non-soul; and plurality is admitted in saying that the essential natures of soul, non-soul, and the Lord are different and not to be confounded." This doctrine is opposed by the followers of Madhva, see <I>ibid</I>., P&ucirc;r.napraj&ntilde;a-dar&#353;. p. 61, l. 11.</P>

Certain flavours of the honey counteract one disorder and others another. The Su&#353;ruta thus describes honey (vol. i. p. 185): "When cooked it removes the three-fold disorders, but when raw or sour it causes them; when used in various applications it cures many disorders; and since it is composed of many different things it is an excellent medium for mixing. But as it consists of the juices of flowers which are mutually contrary in the action, potency, and qualities of their various ingredients, and it may happen that poisonous insects may be included, it is only good as a remedy for cold diseases."</P>

<P><A NAME="page_169_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_169_fr_1">1</A>. This is the <I>prastara</I> or bundle of sacred grass, which plays an important part in the sacrificial ritual, cf.

This description of the grass as the sacrificer is really only meant as metaphorical praise, since the actual attributes of the sacrificer are evidently absent from the grass. (Cf.
