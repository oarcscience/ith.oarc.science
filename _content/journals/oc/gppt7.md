WHEN a Tathâgato arises in the world, an Arahat, a Buddha supreme,
endowed with wisdom in conduct, auspicious, knowing the universe, a
matchless charioteer of men who are tamed, a Master of angels and
mortals, a Blessed Buddha, he preaches his religion, to wit, Personality
(*Sakkâyo*), the origin of Personality, and the cessation thereof, and
the path that unto that cessation goes. And, monks, those angels of long
life, self-radiant, happy beings, abiding in the lofty mansions long,
when they hear the preaching of the Tathâgato's religion, are everywhere
seized with fear, astonishment, and trembling, saying: "Impermanent,
alas! are we, O friend, 'tis said; and we thought we were permanent;
unstable, and we deemed we were stable; non-eternal, who thought
ourselves eternal. 'Tis said, O friend, that, we are impermanent,
unstable, non-eternal, hedged about with personality!"

   Such, O monks, is the spiritual power of the Tathâgato over the
angel-world; such his great authority and mystic might.<span

Canon.\]</span>

   Dr. Carus has pointed out to me the significant fact that the
preaching of the Gospel to the nations is a later addition to the New
Testament. This is borne out by the archaic oracle in Matthew:

>    "Go not into any way of the Gentiles, and enter not into any city
> of the Samaritans; but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of
> Israel. . . .Ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel, till
> the Son of Man be come." (The Missionary Charge in Matth. 5, 6 and
> 23.)

   It is Luke alone who invents the mission of the Seventy (i.e., to the
seventy nations of the world, according to Jewish geography). As we
pointed out in [April, 1900](gppt2.htm#pp_5), there is a parallel here
with the sixty-one Arahats sent forth by Gotamo. That Luke invented the
story of the Seventy is betrayed by himself, for, in [xxii.
35](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#22:35), he agrees with the Petrine and
Matthæan tradition, in ascribing certain words to the Charge to the
Twelve from which he has wrested them to make up his ideal Charge to the
Seventy:

>    "When I sent you forth without purse and wallet and shoes, lacked
> ye anything? And they said, Nothing."

   Luke puts the words, "no purse, no wallet, no shoes," into the Charge
to the Seventy ([x. 4](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#10:4)), while in the Charge
to the Twelve he reads: "nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have
two coats." But there is no mention of shoes. ([Luke ix.
3](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#9:3).)

   In the Gospel tradition generally the great Missionary Charge is the
one given after the resurrection:

>    "Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptising
> them into the names of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
> Ghost." ([Matth. xxviii. 19](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#28:19).)

   The Trinitarian formula betrays the lateness of the redaction, but
the passage is older than the redaction, for the substance of it is
found in the Fourth Gospel: "Peace be unto you: as the Father hath sent
me, even so send I you." ([John xx. 21](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#20:21).) I
have little doubt that the Matthæan charge read originally: "baptising
them into my name," simply; to which Rendel Harris assented when I once
pointed this out to him.

<span id="page_561">p. 561</span>

   As a Christian believer (though attached to no sect or Church
whatever) I personally maintain that the post-resurrection missionary
charge is no mere fiction introduced to imitate Buddhism (granting that
even the catholic Luke knew thereof), but a reality. It is my
conviction, after long research and thinking, that the Lord Jesus was
vividly present, in some guise--whether palpable or visionary matters
little--to his disciples after death, and especially to Peter. I believe
too that he impressed their minds with his wishes, which had expanded
since the days when he forbade ministrations to Samaritans and pagans.
Unfortunately the account of the great appearance to Peter has been
lost, if not suppressed by the Church. It probably contained the charge
to Peter (misplaced in [Matth. xvi](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#16:1).) and
some matter relating to the descent into Hades mentioned in Peter's
Epistle. But this leads us to the question of the lost ending of Mark,
and is food for another article. I will only quote the proof-texts for
an apparition to Peter:

>    [Mark xvi. 7](../../bib/kjv/mar.htm#16:7): "Go, tell his disciples
> and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him."

   (Cf. also [Mark xiv. 28](../../bib/kjv/mar.htm#14:28), fortified by
the parallel in Matthew, but weakened by its omission in the Vienna
Gospel-fragment from Egypt.)

>    [1 Cor. xv. 5](../../bib/kjv/co1.htm#15:5). "He appeared to
> Cephas."

>    [Luke xxiv. 34](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#24:34). "The Lord is risen
> indeed, and hath appeared to Simon."

   Eusebius, H. E. II. 1. Clement \[of Alexandria\] . . . . in the
seventh book of \[his Institutions\] writes also thus:

>    "The Lord transmitted the Gnosis unto James the Just, John and
> Peter after his resurrection."

   Shahahrastâni of Persia, A.D. 1150,

>    "After he was dead and crucified, he returned, and Simon Peter saw
> him and He spake with him, and transmitted to him the power. Then he
> left the world and ascended into heaven, and Simon Peter was his
> representative." (Haar-brücker, Vol.I., p. 261.)

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_559">p. 559</span>

<span id="page_559_note_1"></span>[1](#page_559_fr_1) It is this
paragraph which led us to adduce the parallel in Matthew xxviii. 18.

<span id="footnotes_page_560">p. 560</span>

<span id="page_560_note_1"></span>[1](#page_560_fr_1) I do not call the
Divyâvadâna uncanonical merely because it is not in the Pâli Canon, but
because it is post-Asokan. However, it doubtless contains a nucleus
which we may call semi-canonical, for the Avadânas were classed by
several sects in the Miscellaneous Pitaka, outside the great Collections
of Agamas.
