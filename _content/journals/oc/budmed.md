## BUDDHIST MEDITATIONS.<span id="page_551_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_551_note_*)

COMMUNICATED BY THE EDITOR.

   THE Rev. A. Lloyd, lecturer in the Imperial University of Tokyo,
President of the Asiatic Society of Japan, and formerly fellow at
Peterhouse, Cambridge, has published several interesting books in which
he contrasts Japanese Buddhism with Christianity. He has the religious
zeal of a missionary, and his Christian piety is very sympathetic
because it is unquestionably genuine. There is no attempt at
misrepresenting Buddhism. On the contrary he exhibits a great admiration
for the profundity of its doctrines, as well as the earnest spirit of
its morality, but he points out in notes superadded to his explanations
that Christianity is superior, and suggests that Christians ought to
understand the spirit of the Buddha even better than Buddhists. We
reproduce here a translation which Mr. Lloyd has made from a collection
of a Buddhist book entitled *Fukio Taikan*, which seems to be a "general
review of religious sermons." It contains in poetic form a great number
of maxims which are frequently used as texts for sermons in Buddhist
temples. We omit the collection of such sayings as are commonly known
through other Buddhist scriptures (collected by Mr. Lloyd on pages 67 to
82), and limit ourselves to the second instalment which contains verses
of a typical Japanese interpretation of Buddhism. The form of these
lines is what we might call blank verse. They are unrhymed and their
poetry consists simply in the rhythm. Concerning the translation Mr.
Lloyd says: "I have treated my Japanese originals with a very free hand,
preserving indeed as far as possible the central thought and touch; but
throwing literality to the winds, and in many places combining into one
English poem the central thoughts of several Japanese ones.... And yet I
believe that I have not often misinterpreted, however much I may have
mistranslated."

emperors or famous heroes of Japan.

|                                   | On the cold winter nights I lay me down,            |
|                                   | And feel the warm folds of my bed,—and then         |
|                                   | My heart portrays the sufferings of the poor.       |

|                                   | The winter, with its rigors, touches not            |
|                                   | Our bodies, clad in vestments warm and rich;        |
|                                   | But when we think upon the shivering poor           |
|                                   | That freeze in their thin rags, the cruel tooth     |
|                                   | Of pitiless winter bites our inmost heart.          |

|                                   | From the high roof of my Imperial home              |
|                                   | I look upon the city, and behold                    |
|                                   | The rising smoke from many a lowly hut,             |
|                                   | And know that all is well within the land.          |

|                                   | The thatch upon the cottage is so thin              |
|                                   | That the rain penetrates it, drop by drop,          |
|                                   | And as he works the farmer's hand is wet.           |

|                                   | The night is cold, the mournful soughing wind       |
|                                   | Howls through the chamber door, and then I know     |
|                                   | How cold must be the cottage of the poor.           |

|                                   | Of some dark well,—but let no foreign foot          |

|                                   | That babbles o'er the pebbles to the sea,—              |

|                                   | And therewith build a cottage, snug and warm;           |
|                                   | But the hut falls with time, and by and by              |
|                                   | There's naught, but just the waste hill-side again.     |

<span id="page_556_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_556_fr_*) The bracketed
passage is an editorial addition. Rev. A. Lloyd makes following comment
on the Buddhist doctrine concerning "self":

"This poem illustrates the Buddhist doctrine of the soul, as given in
the Introduction. The "I" or "Ego," i.e., the soul of man, is born with
man, and is at death dissolved. The "I" is nothing but a bundle of
faculties, seeing, hearing, intuition, etc., kept together by the
presence of "self." At birth these faculties come together, by means of
the union of the bodily organs, and form a connecting link between the
material body and "Self," which is Buddha (or God). At death, the "I" is
dissolved, and only "Self" remains, conditioned by the fruits of deeds
done in the body, but yearning to be absorbed in Budha from whom it has
emanated.

"Yet, in spite of this doctrine, Buddhists believe that Amida meets the
faithful soul and conducts it to the Western Paradise, with its identity
preserved through and beyond death. And every Japanese believes that the
faithful dead revisit the earth at the Bon Festival, and that the brave
dead still rejoice in the wars in which they lost their lives. A belief
in the immortality of the soul is innate in the human mind."

The Buddhist doctrine is simple enough and yet it is difficult to grasp
because it seems contradictory.

The Buddhist doctrine of the anatman teaches that there is no *atman*,
i.e. no self or ego, in the sense of a separate and immutable entity as
taught in the Upanishads. The ego (or self) is a fleeting phenomenon and
has no real existence, but the contents of the ego, man's ideas, his
reason and his aspirations are the reflection of the law and order that
governs the world, and so the reality reflected in the ego is immortal.
The substance of the soul consists of rays that come from the eternal
Buddha, also called Dharmakaya, the entirety of all laws, or Amitabha,
the source of wisdom.

Since Buddhism does not believe in the existence of an atman as a
distinct entity, it also rejects the Brahman doctrine of a
transmigration of the soul. Yet Buddhists believe in immortality, for
the same soul with its identical aspirations reappears in the coming
generation. Briefly stated the Buddhist reincarnation is by rebirth not
by transmigration. For further details see *The Dharma*, p. 74 ff.
