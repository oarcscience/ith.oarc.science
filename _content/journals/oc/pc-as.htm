<P ALIGN="center">BY THE EDITOR.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MYSTICISM is, as it were, a short cut of sentiment to reach a truth otherwise inaccessible under given conditions, and since writing an article on the subject for a recent number of <I>The Monist</I>, I have devoted more time to a renewed perusal of one of the most prominent and interesting mystics of Germany, Johannes Scheffler, or as he is better known by his adopted name, Angelus Silesius, who was born in 1624 at Breslau, and died in 1677. While mystics of the type of Jacob Boehme and Swedenborg present their views in long essays of a philosophical nature which read like the dreams (or if you prefer, the vagaries) of a prophet, Angelus Silesius condenses his views in short apothegms, written in a somewhat archaic style, mostly in simple verse, and often with crude rhymes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an explanation of my view of mysticism, I refer my readers to the above-mentioned editorial article published in <I>The Monist</I> of January, 1908, pages 75-110. I have there attempted to translate of the lines of Angelus Silesius (on pages 104-109). Since this mystical thinker is little known in the countries of English speech, and since only a few of his verses have been translated, we present here to our readers an additional selection which will serve as instances of the peculiar God-conception of the mystics, so much like Buddhistic Nirvana; also the mystic ethics of quietism, the mystic psychology and mystic religion which teach man to seek salvation through breaking down the limits of the ego. By overcoming egoity it is promised that man shall attain divinity. Peculiarly noteworthy is the mystic's sensual conception of piety, and the representation of the soul's relation to God as a kind of mystic marriage. All this is typical of a certain kind of mysticism which exercised such a powerful influence at the end of the Middle Ages, but has now entirely lost its influence on mankind.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johannes Scheffler was born of Protestant parents at Breslau, the capital of Silesia, in 1624, and was baptized in the same year on Christmas day. Having passed through the usual course of education at a gymnasium he went to the Universities of Strassburg, Leyden and Padua where he studied medicine and philosophy. At the last mentioned place he took his doctor's degree in 1647. For three years, 1649-1652, he served as Court Physician to Duke Sylvius Nimrod of Oels, who was a pious but decidedly onesided Protestant.</P>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheffler's mystic inclinations had long before alienated him from the dogmatic and anti-artistic spirit of the religion of his birth which during the middle of the seventeenth century was more severe and bigoted than ever before or afterwards. At the same time there was a religious revival in the Roman Catholic world which proved attractive to him, and so it was but natural that finally in 1653 he severed his old affiliations, and joined the Church

<!------------------------page 293------------------------>

<A NAME="page_293"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 293</FONT></A>

that by the mystical glamor of its historical traditions was most sympathetic to him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zeal with which Scheffler embraced Roman Catholicism made him unjust toward the Protestant persuasion and implicated him in very unpleasant controversies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having become <I>persona grata</I> in the aristocratic circles of Austria, Scheffler became Court Physician to the Emperor in 1654; ten years later, in 1664, he was appointed chief Master of Ceremonies at the court of the Prince Bishop of Breslau, with the title Counsellor.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His devotion led him in 1661 to enter the order of St. Francis, commonly called the Brotherhood of Minorites. Having fallen a prey to consumption, he died July 9, 1677, in the institution of the Knights of the Cross of St. Matthews in Breslau.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though by education a physician and a scientist, Johannes Scheffler was a mystic and a poet. His most famous book is entitled "The Cherubinean Wanderer," and it is from this that the present selection has been made. It was followed by another pious effusion entitled <I>Heilige Seelenlust oder geistliche Hirtenlust der in ihren Jesum verliebten Psyche</I>. He is also the author of several church songs which breathe fervor and piety.<A NAME="page_293_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_293_note_*">*</A> Like Newman's "Lead,

kindly Light!" these have become the common property of Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. Some of his songs been translated into English, notably, "Earth has nothing sweet and fair."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried in vain to find a likeness of Johannes Scheffler. The only portrait that we can discover is a caricature in an invective lampoon entitled <I>Wohlverdientes Kapitel</I>. ("Well deserved Chapter") published in 1664, in which our mystic is represented as a pedler of spectacles, rosaries, cards, dice, and other similar wares. No attempt has been made to disfigure the expression of his face, and we have reason to believe that it bears a certain likeness to the man. In his signature he calls himself "<I>Archiater et physicus Olsnensis</I>," which means that he was court physician and surgeon of the small duchy of Oels in Silesia.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now let Angelus Silesius speak for himself:</P>

<TR><TD>What has been said of God<BR>

My life, my light, my aim.</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>God is my final end;<BR>
Does he from me evolve,<BR>
Then he grows out of me,<BR>
While I in Him dissolve.</TR></TD>

Than me I love God more.<BR>
So He gives me as much<BR>
As I to Him restore.</TR></TD>

Forever one is He.<BR>
What we in Him e'er know,<BR>
Ourselves must grow and be.</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>God never did exist<BR>
Nor ever will, yet aye<BR>
He was ere worlds began, and<BR>
When they're gone he'll stay.</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>God Father is a point,<BR>
God Son the circuit line,<BR>
And God the Ghost does both<BR>
As area combine.</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>God is all virtue's end,<BR>
Its mainspring He's likewise.<BR>
He too is virtue's cause,<BR>
He eke is virtue's prize.</TR></TD>

The spring wells up in thee.<BR>
Don't stop its fountain head:<BR>
It flows eternally.</TR></TD>

As with Him e'er can be,<BR>
He is at any rate<BR>
A hero verily.</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>Abandon winneth God.<BR>
But to abandon God<BR>
Is an abandonment<BR>
Which must seem very odd.</TR></TD>
