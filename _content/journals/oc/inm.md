## INSCRIPTION OF THE NESTORIAN MONUMENT.

TRANSLATED BY A. WYLIE.

*Tablet Eulogizing the Propagation of the lllustrious Religion in  
China, With a Preface; Composed by King-Tsing,  
A Priest of the Syrian Church.*

   BEHOLD the unchangeably true and invisible, who existed through all
eternity without origin; the far-seeing perfect intelligence, wbose
mysterious existence is everlasting; operating on primordial substance
he created the universe, being more excellent than all holy
intelligences, inasmuch as he is the source of all that is honorable.
This is our eternal true lord God, triune and mysterious in substance.
He appointed the cross as the means for determining the four cardinal
points, he moved the original spirit, and produced the two principles of
nature; the sombre void was changed, and heaven and earth were opened
out; the sun and moon revolved, and day and night commenced; having
perfected all inferior objects, he then made the first man; upon him he
bestowed an excellent disposition, giving him in charge the government
of all created beings; man, acting out the original principles of his
nature, was pure and unostentatious; his unsullied and expansive mind
was free from the least inordinate desire; until Satan introduced the
seeds of falsehood, to deteriorate his purity of principle; the opening
thus commenced in his virtue gradually enlarged, and by this crevice in
his nature was obscured and rendered vicious; hence three hundred and
sixty-five sects followed each other in continuous track, inventing
every species of doctrinal complexity; while some pointed to material
objects as the source of their faith, others reduced all to vacancy,
even to the annihilation of the two primeval principles; some sought to
call down blessings by prayers and supplications, while others by an
assumption of excellence held themselves up as superior to their
fellows; their <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> intellects and thoughts
continually wavering, their minds and affections incessantly on the
move, they never obtained their vast desires, but being exhausted and
distressed they revolved in their own heated atmosphere; till by an
accumulation of obscurity they lost their path, and after long groping
in darkness they were unable to return. Thereupon, our Trinity being
divided in nature, the illustrious and honorable Messiah, veiling his
true dignity, appeared in the world as a man; angelic powers promulgated
the glad tidings, a virgin gave birth to the Holy One in Syria; a bright
star announced the felicitous event, and Persians<span
id="page_36_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_36_note_1) observing the splendor
came to present tribute; the ancient dispensation, as declared by the
twenty-four holy men,<span id="page_36_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_36_note_2) was then fulfilled, and
he laid down great principles for the government of families and
kingdoms; he established the new religion of the silent operation of the
pure spirit of the Triune; he rendered virtue subservient to direct
faith; he fixed the extent of the eight boundaries,<span
id="page_36_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_36_note_3) thus completing the truth
and freeing it from dross; he opened the gate of the three constant
principles,<span id="page_36_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_36_note_4) introducing life and
destroying death; he suspended the bright sun to invade the chambers of
darkness, and the falsehoods of the devil were thereupon defeated; he
set in motion the vessel of mercy by which to ascend to the bright
mansions, whereupon rational beings were then released, having thus
completed the manifestation of his power, in clear day he ascended to
his true station. Twenty-seven sacred books<span
id="page_36_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_36_note_5) have been left, which
disseminate intelligence by unfolding the original transforming
principles. By the rule for admission, it is the custom to apply the
water of baptism; to wash away all superficial show and to cleanse and
purify the neophytes. As a seal, they hold the cross, whose influence is
reflected in every direction, uniting all without distinction. As they
strike the wood, the fame of their benevolence is diffused abroad;
worshiping toward the east, they hasten on the way to life and glory;
they preserve the beard to symbolize their outward actions, they shave
the crown to <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> indicate the absence of
inward affections; they do not keep slaves, but put noble and mean all
on an equality; they do not amass wealth, but cast all their property
into the common stock; they fast, in order to perfect themselves by
self-inspection; they submit to restraints, in order to strengthen
themselves by silent watchfulness; seven times a day they have worship
and praise for the benefit of the living and the dead; once in seven
days they sacrifice, to cleanse the heart and return to purity.

   It is difficult to find a name to express the excellence of the true
and unchangeable doctrine; but as its meritorious operations are
manifestly displayed, by accommodation it is named the illustrious
Religion. Now without holy men, principles cannot become expanded;
without principles, holy men cannot become magnified; but with holy men
and right principles, united as the two parts of a signet, the world
becomes civilized and enlightened.

   In the time of the accomplished Emperor Taitsung, the illustrious and
magnificent founder of the dynasty, among the enlightened and holy men
who arrived was the Most-virtuous Olopun, from the country of Syria.
Observing the azure clouds, be bore the true sacred books; beholding the
direction of the winds, he braved difficulties and dangers. In the year
A.D. 635 be arrived at Chang-an; the Emperor sent his Prime Minister,
Duke Fang Hiuen-ling; who, carrying the official staff to the west
border, conducted his guest into the interior; the sacred books were
translated in the imperial library, the sovereign investigated the
subject in his private apartments; when becoming deeply impressed with
the rectitude and truth of the religion, be gave special orders for its
dissemination. In the seventh month of the year A.D. 638 the foliowing
imperial proclamation was issued:

   "Right principles have no invariable name, holy men have no
invariable station; instruction is established in accordance with the
locality, with the object of benefiting the people at large. The
'Greatly-virtuous Olopun, of the kingdom of Syria, has brought his
sacred books and images from that distant part, and has presented them
at our chief capital. Having examined the principles of this religion,
we find them to be purely excellent and natural; investigating its
originating source, we find it has taken its rise from the establishment
of important truths; its ritual is free from perplexing expressions, its
principles will survive when the framework is forgot; it is beneficial
to all creatures; it is advantageous to mankind. Let it be published
throughout the Empire, and let the proper authority build a Syrian
church in the capital in the I-ning May, which shall <span
id="page_38">p. 38</span> be governed by twenty-one priests. When the
virtue of the Chau dynasty declined, the rider on the azure ox ascended
to the west; the principles of the great Tang becoming resplendent, the
lllustrious breezes have come to fan the East."

   Orders were then issued to the authorities to have a true portrait of
the Emperor taken; when it was transferred to the wall of the church,
the dazzling splendor of the celestial visage irradiated the Illustrious
portals. The sacred traces emitted a felicitous influence, and shed a
perpetual splendor over the holy precincts. According to the Illustrated
Memoir of the Western Regions, and the historical books of the Han and
Wei dynasties, the kingdom of Syria reaches south to the Coral Sea; on
the north it joins the Gem Mountains; on the west it extends toward the
borders of the immortals and the flowery forests; on the east it lies
open to the violent winds and tideless waters. The country produces
fire-proof cloth, life-restoring incense, bright moon-pearls, and
night-lustre gems. Brigands and robbers are unknown, but the people
enjoy happiness and peace. None but Illustrious laws prevail; none but
the virtuous are raised to sovereign power. The land is broad and ample,
and its literary productions are perspicuous and clear.

   The Emperor Kautsung respectfully succeeded his ancestor, and was
still more beneficent toward the institution of truth. In every province
he caused Illustrious churches to be erected, and ratified the honor
conferred upon Olopun, making him the great conservator of doctrine for
the preservation of the State. While this doctrine pervaded every
channel, the State became enriched and tranquility abounded. Every city
was full of churches, and the royal family enjoyed lustre and happiness.
In the year A.D. 699 the Buddhists, gaining power, raised their voices
in the eastern metropolis;<span id="page_38_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_38_note_6) in the year A.D. 713,
some low fellows excited ridicule and spread slanders, in the western
capital. At that time there was the chief priest Lo-han, the
Greatly-virtuous Kie-leih, and others of noble estate frorn the golden
regions, lofty-minded priests, having abandoned all worldly interests;
who unitedly maintaied the grand principles and preserved them entire to
the end.

   The high-principled Emperor Hiuentsung caused the Prince of Ning and
others, five princes in all, personally to visit the felicitous edifice;
he established the place of worship; he restored the consecrated <span
id="page_39">p. 39</span> timbers which had been temporarily thrown
down; and reerected the sacred stones which for a time had been
desecrated.

   In 742 orders were given to the great general Kau Lih-sz', to send
the five sacred portraits and have them placed in the church, and a gift
of a hundred pieces of silk accompanied these pictures of intelligence.
Although the dragon's beard was then remote, their bows and swords were
still within reach; while the solar horns sent forth their rays, and
celestial visages seemed close at hand.<span
id="page_39_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_39_note_7)

   In 744 the priest Kih-ho, in the kingdom of Syria, looking toward the
star (of China), was attracted by its transforming influence, and
observing the suri (i.e., Emperor), came to pay court to the most
honorable. The Emperor commanded the priest Lo-han, the priest Pu-lun,
and others, seven in all, together with the Greatly-virtuous Kih-ho, to
perform a service of merit in the Hing-king palace. Thereupon the
Emperor composed mottoes for the sides of the church, and the tablets
were graced with the royal inscriptions; the accumulated gems emitted
their effulgence, while their sparkling brightness vied with the ruby
clouds; the transcripts of intelligence suspended in the void shot forth
their rays as reflected by the sun; the bountiful gifts exceeded the
height of the southern hills; the bedewing favors were deep as the
eastern sea. Nothing is beyond the range of the right principle, and
what is permissible may be identified; nothing is beyond the power of
the holy man, and that which is practicable may be related.

   The accomplished and enlightened Emperor Suhtsung rebuilt the
Illustrious churches in Ling-wu and four other places; great benefits
were conferred, and felicity began to increase; great munificence was
displayed, and the imperial State became established.

   The accomplished and military Emperor Taitsung magnified the sacred
succession, and honored the latent principle of nature; always, on the
incarnation-day, he bestowed celestial incense, and ordered the
performance of a service of merit; he distributed of the imperial
viands, in order to shed a glory on the Illustrious Congregation. Heaven
is munificent in the dissemination of blessings, whereby the benefits of
life are extended; the holy man embodies the original principle of
virtue, whence he is able to counteract noxious influences.

   Our sacred and sage-like, accomplished and military Emperor Kienchung
appointed the eight branches of government, according <span
id="page_40">p. 40</span> to which he advanced or degraded the
intelligent and dull; he opened up the nine categories, by means of
which he renovated the illustrious decrees; his transforming influence
pervaded the most abstruse principles, while openness of heart
distinguished his devotions. Thus, by correct and enlarged purity of
principle, and undeviating consistency in sympathy with others; by
extended commiseration rescuing multitudes from misery, while
disseminating blessings on all around, the cultivation of our doctrine
gained a grand basis, and by gradual advances its influence was
diffused. If the winds and rains are seasonable, the world will be at
rest; men will be guided by principle, inferior objects will be pure;
the living will be at ease, and the dead will rejoice; the thoughts will
produce their appropriate response, the affections will be free, and the
eyes will be sincere; such is the laudable condition which we of the
Illustrious Religion are laboring to attain.

   Our great benefactor, the Imperially-conferred-purple-gown
priest,<span id="page_40_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_40_note_8) I-sz', titular Great
Statesman of the Banqueting-house, Associated Secondary Military
Commissioner for the Northern Region, and Examination-palace Overseer,
was naturally mild and graciously disposed; his mind susceptible of
sound doctrine, he was diligent in the performance; from the distant
city of Râjagriha,<span id="page_40_fr_9"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">9</span></sup>](#page_40_note_9) he came to visit China;
his principles more lofty than those of the three dynasties, his
practice was perfect in every department; at first he applied himself to
dulies pertaining to the palace, eventually his name was inscribed on
the military roll. When the Duke Koh Tsz'-í, Secondary Minister of State
and Prince of Fan-yang, at first conducted the military in the northern
region, the Emperor Suhtsung made him (I-sz') his attendant on his
travels; although he was a private chamberlain, he assumed no
distinction on the march; he was as claws and teeth to the duke, and in
rousing the military he was as ears and eyes; he distributed the wealth
conferred upon him, not accumulating treasure for his private use; he
made offerings of the jewelry which had been given by imperial favor, he
spread out a golden <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> carpet for devotion;
now he repaired the old churches, anon he inreased the number of
religious establishments; he honored and decorated the various edifices,
till they resembled the plumage of the pheasant in its flight; moreover,
practising the discipline of the Illustrious Religion, he distributed
his riches in deeds of benevolence; every year he assembled those in the
sacred office from four churches, and respectfully engaged them for
fifty days in purification and preparation; the naked came and were
clothed; the sick were attended to and restored; the dead were buried in
repose; even among the most pure and self-denying of the Buddhists, such
excellence was never heard of; the white-clad members of the lllustrious
Congregation, now considering these men, have desired to engrave a broad
tablet, in order to set forth a eulogy of their magnanimous deeds.

 

ODE.

The true Lord is without origin,  
Profound, invisible, and unchangeable;  
With power and capacity to perfect and transform,  
He raised up the earth and established the heavens.  

Divided in nature, he entered the world,  
To save and to help without bounds;  
The sun arose, and darkness was dispelled,  
All bearing witness to his true original.  

The glorious and resplendent, accomplished Emperor,  
Whose principles embraced those of preceding monarchs.  
Taking advantage of the occasion, suppressed turbulence:  
Heaven was spread out and the earth was enlarged.  
When the pure, bright Illustrious Religion  

Was introduced to our Tang dynasty,  
The Scriptutes were translated, and churches built,  
And the vessel set in motion for the living and the dead:  
Every kind of blessing was then obtained,  
And all the kingdoms enjoyed a state of peace.  

When Kautsung succeeded to his ancestral estate.  
He rebuilt the edifices of purity;  
Palaces of concord, large and light,  
Covered the length and breadth of the land.  

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

The true doctrine was clearly announced,  
Overseers of the church were appointed in due form;  
The people enjoyed happiness and peace,  
While all creatures were exempt from calamity and distress.  

When Hiuentsung commenced his sacred career,  
He applied himself to the cultivation of truth and rectitude;  
His imperial tablets shot forth their effulgence,  
And the celestial writings mutually reflected their splendors.  

The imperial domain was rich and luxuriant,  
While the whole land rendered exalted homage;  
Every business was flourishing throughout,  
And the people all enjoyed prosperity.  

Then came Suhtsung, who commenced anew,  
And celestial dignity marked the imperial movements.  
Sacred as the moon's unsullied expanse,  
While felicity was wafted like nocturnal gales.  

Happiness reverted to the imperial household,  
The autumnal influences were long removed;  
Ebullitions were allayed, and risings suppressed,  
And thus our dynasty was firmly built up.  

Taitsung the filial and just  
Combined in virtue with heaven and earth;  
By his liberal bequests the living were satisfied,  
And property formed the channel of imparting succor.  

By fragrant mementoes he rewarded the meritorious,  
With benevolence he dispensed his donations;  
The solar concave appeared in dignity,  
And the lunar retreat was decorated to extreme.  

When Kienchung succeeded to the throne,  
He began the cultivation of intelligent virtue;  
His military vigilance extended to the four seas,  
And his accomplished purity influenced all lands.  

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

His light penetrated the secrecies of men,  
And to him the diversities of objects were seen as in a mirror;  
He shed a vivifying influence through the whole realm of nature,  
And all outer nations took him for example.  

The true doctrine how expansive!  
Its responses are minute;  
How difficult to name it!  
To elucidate the three in one.  

The sovereign has the power to act!  
While the ministers record;  
We raise this noble monument!  
To the praise of great felicity.  

   This was erected in the 2d year of Kienchung, of the Tang Dynasty
(A.D. 781), on the 7th day of the 1st month, being Sunday.

   Written by Lu Siu-yen, Secretary to Council, formerly Military
Superintendent for Taichau; while the Bishop Ning-shu had the charge of
the congregations of the Illustrious in the East.

   <span class="small">\[The two lines of Syriac are in the Estrangelo

<span id="page_36_note_1"></span>[1](#page_36_fr_1) *Po-sz'*,
"Persians." This name was well known to the Chinese at that time, being
the designation of an extensive sect then located in the Empire, and the
name of a nation with which they had held commercial and political
intercourse for several centuries. The statement here is in admirable
harmony with the general tradition of the early Church, that the Magi or
wise men mentioned in Matthew's Gospel were no other than philosophers
of the Parsee sect.

<span id="page_36_note_2"></span>[2](#page_36_fr_2) The "holy men"
denote the writers of the books of the Old Testament.

<span id="page_36_note_3"></span>[3](#page_36_fr_3) The "eight
boundaries" are inexplicable; some refer them to the beatitudes.

<span id="page_36_note_4"></span>[4](#page_36_fr_4) The "three constant
principles" may perhaps mean faith, hope, and charity.

<span id="footnotes_page_38">p. 38</span>

<span id="page_38_note_6"></span>[6](#page_38_fr_6) "Eastern metropolis"
is *Tung Chau*, literally "Eastern Chau." The Empire was at this time
under the government of the Empress Wu Tsih-tien, who had removed her
residence from Chang-an to Lohyang in Honan.

<span id="page_39_note_7"></span>[7](#page_39_fr_7) These personages are
the first five emperors of the Tang dynasty, Hiuen-tsung's predecessors.
Their portraits were so admirably painted that they seemed to be
present, their arms could almost be handled, and their foreheads. or
"horns of the sun," radiated their intelligence.

<span id="footnotes_page_40">p. 40</span>

<span id="page_40_note_8"></span>[8](#page_40_fr_8) It was no rare
occurrence for priests to occupy civil and military offices in the State
during the Tang and preceding dynasties. Of the three titles here given,
the first is merely an indication of rank, by which the bearer is
entitled to a certain emolument from the State; the second is his title
as an officer actively engaged in the imperial service; and the third is
an honorary title, which gives to the possessor a certain status in the
capital, without any duties or emolument connected therewith.

<span id="page_40_note_9"></span>[9](#page_40_fr_9) *Wang-shih*,
literally "Royal residence," which is also the translation of the
Sanskrit word Râjagriha, is the name of a city on the banks of the
Ganges, which occurs in several Buddhist works. As this was one of the
most important of the Buddhist cities in India, it is natural to suppose
that I-sz' was a Buddhist priest.
