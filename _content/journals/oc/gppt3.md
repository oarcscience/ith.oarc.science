## GOSPEL PARALLELS FROM PÂLI TEXTS.

<span class="small">Translated from the Originals by ALBERT J.
EDMUNDS.</span>

<span class="small">(Third Series).</span>

 

<span id="pp_1"></span>{1} PSYCHICAL POWERS.

   <span class="small">Numerical Collection, iii. 60 (not before
translated). Compare also [Middling Collection, Dialogue No.
6](../../bud/sbe11/sbe1106), translated in S. B. E. XI; [Long
Collection, Dialogue No. 11.](../../bud/dob/dob-02tx) translated in
Dialogues of the Buddha (1899), each by Rhys Davids, and the former also
into German by Neumann.</span>

> <span class="small">[Mark Appendix xvi. 17,
> 18](../../bib/kjv/mar.htm#16:17): And these signs shall follow them
> that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak
> with \[new\] tongues; they shall take up serpents, and if they drink
> any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands
> on the sick, and they shall recover.</span>

   O Brâhman, there are these three miracles.<span
id="page_358_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_358_note_2) What three?--The miracle
of psychical power, the miracle of mind-reading, and the miracle of
education. What, O Brâhman, is the miracle of psychical power? In this
case, O Brâhman, one enjoys in various ways a kind of psychical power:
from being one he becomes multiform, from being multiform he becomes
one; he appears and vanishes,<span id="page_358_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_358_note_3) he goes without
hindrance to the further side of a wall or battlement or mountain, as if
through air; he plunges into earth and emerges, as if in water; he walks
on the water without dividing it, <span id="page_359">p. 359</span> as
if on earth;<span id="page_359_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_359_note_1) like a bird on wing he
travels through the air in the posture of meditation; and yonder sun and
moon, so magical, so mighty, he feels and touches with his hand; while
up to the world of God he reaches even in the body. This, O Brâhman, is
called the miracle of psychical power.

   And what, Brâhman, is the miracle of mind-reading? In this case, O
Brâhman, one reads minds by visible indication, and says: "Your mind is
thus, your mind is so, your heart is so-and-so." Even if he read much,
it is always as he says, and not otherwise. Again, O Brâhman, one reads
minds not by visible indication, but by hearing the voice of men, demons
or angels, and then declaring the state of mind; and even if he read
much, he is always right. Nor alone by these means does he read, but he
hears the sound of thought-vibrations from thinking and reflecting, and
in this way comes to read the mind and heart. And, as before, he is
always right. Then again, besides visible indication, voice and
thought-vibration, one ascertains the trance-mind of a man absorbed in
rapture beyond thought and beyond reflexion, by heart-to-heart
perception, so that one can say: "From the determinate mental
conformation of this friend, from the nature of his heart, he will think
such and such a thought." And as before, he is always right. This, O
Brâhman, is called the miracle of mind-reading.

   What, now, Brâhman, is the miracle of education?

   In this case, O Brâhman, one educates on this wise: "Think thus
instead of so; consider thus instead of thus. Renounce this; train
yourself in that, and abide therein." This, O Brâhman, is called the
miracle of education. And these are the three miracles.<span
id="page_359_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_359_note_2) Which of the three;
think you, is the most excellent and most refined?

   Well, now, Gotamo, as to the miracle of psychical power, he who
performs and experiences this has the benefit all to himself. This kind
of miracle, Gotamo, appears to me a natural accompaniment of religion.
And I think the same of the second, the miracle of mind-reading. But
that last one, Gotamo, that miracle of education, appears to me the most
excellent and most refined. Wonderful, <span id="page_360">p. 360</span>
O Gotamo, marvellous, O Gotamo, is this good saying of yours; and we
hold that you are endowed with all three of these miracles. Gotamo can
indeed practise every one of the aforesaid psychical powers, from
becoming multiform to reaching in the body unto the world of God. Gotamo
can ascertain the trance-mind of a man absorbed in rapture beyond
thought and beyond reflexion, by heart-to-heart perception, and can say
from the determinate mental conformation and the nature of the heart
what the thought will be. And Gotamo can educate by telling what to
think and what to consider; what to renounce, wherein to train oneself,
and wherein to abide.

   It is true, O Brâhman, that I have attained to all that you have
said, and I will furthermore assert that I can do each of the three
miracles in question.<span id="page_360_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_360_note_1)

   But is there, Gotamo, a single other monk who is endowed with these
miracles besides yourself?

   Brâhman, not only one, nor a hundred, nor two, three, four, or five
hundred, but even more monks there are who are endowed with these
miracles.

   But, Gotamo, where do these monks now dwell?

   In this very Order, O Brâhman!

   Excellent, O Gotamo! this is excellent! As one raises what had been
thrown down, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him
who has gone astray, or holds out a lamp in the darkness that those who
have eyes may see the objects, just even so has the Doctrine been made
clear by Gotamo in manifold exposition. And I, even I, take refuge in
Gotamo, his Doctrine and his Order. May Gotamo receive, as a
lay-disciple, from this day forth as long as life endures, me who have
taken refuge \[in him\].

 

<span id="pp_2"></span>{2} FURTHER PSYCHICAL POWERS.

   <span class="small">Numerical Collection, Class XI. Quoted in *The
Questions of King Milindo* (S. B. E. XXXV., p. 279). See also Jâtaka
169.</span>

> <span class="small">[Luke x. 19](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#10:19): Behold,
> I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and
> over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt
> you.</span>

> <span class="small">Mark Appendix (as above).</span>

   Eleven advantages, O monks, may be expected from the cultivation of
Benevolence,--from practising it, developing, making it a vehicle and an
aim, pursuing it, accumulating, and striving to <span id="page_361">p.
361</span> the height of its heart-deliverance. What are these
eleven?--One keeps in peace, and wakes in peace; he dreams no evil
dream; he is dear unto mortals and immortals; the angels watch over him;
fire, poison, sword, can harm him not; quickly his heart is calmed; the
aspect of his countenance is serene; he meets death undismayed; and
should he fail of the Highest, he is sure to go to the world of God.

 

<span id="pp_3"></span>{3} DISPLAY OF PSYCHICAL POWER FORBIDDEN.

   <span class="small">Cullavaggo v. 8. (translated in S. B. E. XX., p.
81).</span>

> <span class="small">[Mark viii. 11](../../bib/kjv/mar.htm#*:11), 12:
> And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking
> of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. And he sighed deeply in his
> spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? Verily I say
> unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</span>

   Ye are not, O monks, to display psychical power or miracle of
superhuman kind before the laity. Whoever does so is guilty of a
misdemeanor.

 

<span id="pp_4"></span>{4} POWER OVER SERPENTS.

   <span class="small">Cullavaggo v. 6. (Translated in S. B. E., XX., p.
75). See also Jâtaka 203.</span>

> <span class="small">[Luke x. 19](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#10:19), as
> above. (Justin Martyr adds *centipedes*.)</span>

   Now at that season a certain monk died of the bite of a serpent. They
told the matter to the Blessed One. . . . And he said: "Now surely that
monk, O monks, did not diffuse his Benevolence toward the four royal
breeds of serpents! Had he done so, he would not die of the bite of
one."

   (The reason why I capitalise *Benevolence* is because it is a
technical term, and means literally and forcibly *willing what is good*.
By a systematic practice of this love-meditation, or projection of
affectionate thought-waves toward all creatures, Gotamo, as we have read
in a former translation, became the Deity of a by-gone cycle.)

 

<span id="pp_5"></span>{5} SAVED FROM HELL.

   <span class="small">Long Collection, [Dialogue No.
12](../../bud/dob/dob-12tx). (Translated in Rhys Davids's *Dialogues of
the Buddha*, 1899.)</span>

> <span class="small">[John iii. 16, 17](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#3:16):
> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
> whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.
> For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that
> the world should be saved through him.</span>

> <span class="small">[Jude 23](../../bib/kjv/jde.htm#1:23): And some
> save, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with
> fear; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</span>

   Lohicco the Brâhman spake thus unto the Blessed One: "O Gotamo, just
as if a man had caught another by the hair who was <span
id="page_362">p. 362</span> falling over the precipice of hell, lifted
him up, and set him safe upon firm land; just even so have I, who was
falling over the precipice of hell, been lifted up and set safe upon
firm land by Gotamo."

   (Fausböll and Rhys Davids translate *bho Gotama!* by "venerable
Gotama." I have translated *bho*, when standing alone, as "friend": one
might have said "gentleman," in the low complimentary sense denounced by
Tennyson. *Bho*, when coupled with a name, is a familiar address,
equivalent to our calling a man Smith or Jones, without the "Mister."
The Buddhists resented this arrogant familiarity on the part of the
Brâhmans toward the Master, and nicknamed the entire priestly caste "Bho
callers," in consequence. Gotamo was the Master's family or clan-name,
answering to our Smith, etc.; and rightly to appreciate the snobbery of
the Brâhmans, we must imagine them saying: "Shakespeare, I want to talk
to you.")

 

<span id="pp_6"></span>{6} CASTES LOST IN THE LORD.

   <span class="small">Udâna v. 5: Cullavaggo ix. 1. (Translated in S.
B. E., XX., p. 304.)</span>

> <span class="small">[Galatians iii. 28](../../bib/kjv/gal.htm#3:28):
> There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor
> free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one man in
> Christ Jesus.</span>

> <span class="small">[Mark iii. 34, 35](../../bib/kjv/mar.htm#3:34):
> And looking round on them which sat round about him, he saith, Behold,
> my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of God, the
> same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</span>

> <span class="small">[John xv. 14, 15](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#15:14): Ye
> are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you. No longer do
> I call you slaves; for the slave knoweth not what his lord doeth: but
> I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father
> I have made known unto you.</span>

   Just, O monks, as the great rivers,--to wit: the Ganges, the Jamna,
the Rapti, the Gogra, the Mâhi,--when they fall into the great ocean,
renounce their former name and kind and are counted as the mighty sea:
just even so, monks, do these four castes,--to wit: the Nobles, the
Brâhmans, the Tradesfolk, and the Slaves,--when they have gone forth
from domestic life into the homeless one, under the Doctrine and
Discipline made public by the Tathâgata, renounce their former name and
clan, to be numbered with the Sâkya philosophers.

 

<span id="pp_7"></span>{7} THE SECOND COMING.

   <span class="small">Long Collection, Dialogue No. 26.</span>

   <span class="small">(Translated from the King of Siam's edition,
because not yet printed in Roman letters.)</span>

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

> <span class="small">[John xiv. 26](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#14:26): But
> the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
> Name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
> remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</span>

> <span class="small">[Revelation xx. 6](../../bib/kjv/rev.htm#20:6):
> Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over
> these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God
> and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</span>

   Monks, in the days of the men of eighty thousand years there will
arise in the world a Buddha named Metteyyo (i.e., the Benevolent One;
Sanskrit, Maitreya), a Holy One,<span
id="page_363_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_363_note_1) a supremely Enlightened
One, endowed with wisdom in conduct; auspicious, knowing the universe;
an incomparable Charioteer of men who are tamed; a Master of angels and
Mortals, a Blessed Buddha; even as I have now arisen in the world, a
Buddha with these same qualities endowed. What he has realised by his
own supernal knowledge he will publish to this universe, with its
angels, its fiends, and its archangels, and to the race of philosophers
and brahmins, princes and peoples; even as I now, having all this
knowledge, do publish the same unto the same. He will preach his
religion, glorious in its origin, glorious at the climax, glorious at
the goal, in the spirit and the letter. He will proclaim a religious
life, wholly perfect, and thoroughly pure; even as I now preach my
religion and a like life do proclaim. He will keep up a society of monks
numbering many thousand, even as I now keep up a society of monks
numbering many hundred.

<span id="page_358_note_2"></span>[2](#page_358_fr_2). *Pâtihâriya* is
the regular word for a display of magical power or jugglery, and is best
rendered "miracle." The word *Iddhi*, translated "psychical power," is
more dignified. Burnouf renders it "puissance surnaturelle."

<span id="page_358_note_3"></span>[3](#page_358_fr_3). [Luke xxiv.
31](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#24:31), 36: And their eyes were opened, and
they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. . . . And as they
spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them.

[John xx. 19](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#20:19), 26: When therefore it was
evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were
shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and
stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. . . .

And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with
them, Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and
said, Peace be unto you.

<span id="footnotes_page_359">p. 359</span>

<span id="page_359_note_1"></span>[1](#page_359_fr_1). [Mark vi.
48](../../bib/kjv/mar.htm#6:48), and parallels (told of Christ): And
seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them,
about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the
sea.

[Matthew xiv. 29](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#14:29) (told of Peter): And he
said, come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the
waters, to come to Jesus.

<span id="page_359_note_2"></span>[2](#page_359_fr_2). In *Dîgha* No.
11, Gotamo says: "It is because I see the danger in miracles of
psychical power and of mind-reading, that I detest, abhor and despise
them." In the uncanonical Sanskrit *Divyâvadâna*, he says that he
commands his disciples not to work miracles, but to hide their good
deeds and show their sins.

the style of our Western rhetoric.
