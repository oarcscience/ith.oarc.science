# GOSPEL PARALLELS FROM PÂLI TEXTS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Index of articles](#index)   [Table of Sources](#sources)   [First
article](gppt1)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These files are transcriptions of a series of articles written by Albert
J. Edmunds in support of his thesis that the early Christian movement
grew at least partially out of the influence of Buddhist missionaries on
the religious thought of the Levant. Although he strenuously denies that
this is his object in the prefatory note, he went on to develop that
thesis at much greater length after these articles were published. (I
hope to be able to provide some of his later work in the future.)

Edmunds was a convinced Protestant, and although he was of the 'liberal'
stripe, his translations are highly suspect due to his overwhelming
desire to show parallels. He uses the word God to translate Brahmâ
throughout, and even uses 'Kingdom of God' to translate the phrase that
others render 'Brahmâ-world'. (See the [fourth section of the second
series](gppt2.htm#pp_4).) He also uses the word 'angels' where others
translate 'god' in a further effort to remake the polytheism of ancient
India. (See the [second section of the third series](gppt3.htm#pp_2).)
There are also clues to the influence of 'spiritualism' on Edmunds
interpretations; see his explanation of the phrase "diffuse his
Benevolence" by "projection of affectionate thought-waves toward all
creatures." (See the [fourth section of the third
series](gppt3.htm#pp_4).)

While none of these interpretations/translations may be outright
'wrong', they do, taken as a whole and with the weight of two thousand
years of Christian tradition, create the impression that Buddhism is
actually a sort of crypto-Christianity, an interpretation which goes
against the grain of nearly all Buddist scholarship, secular and
religious, eastern and western, modern and Victorian. Being what they
are, these articles are interesting as an example of how far people are
willing to go to see what they want to see, and of the tendency for a
liberal 'religious dialogue' to become the co-opting of one tradition by
another. All cross-cultural understanding, however, is founded on a
dialogue of 'parallels', and this is a genuine attempt. Although the
influence of this particular line of thinking appears to have waned, the
book of history is never closed, and stranger ideas than these have
resurfaced in our time.

In spite of his predispositions, Edmunds was a competent scholar of the
Pâli language (if not of philosophy), and his translations are viable if
one is aware of his slant. In some cases, his versions are the only ones
that are indisputably in the public domain at this time. Most of the
'parallels' in his series are short extracts, but there are a few of
substantial length. These are of course far more valuable (and less
suceptible to mistranslation), and have been marked with **bold type**
in the links below.
