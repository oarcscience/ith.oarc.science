<P>THIS was spoken by the Blessed One, spoken by the Arahat and heard by me.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O monks, be not afraid of good works: such is the name for happiness, for what is wished, desired, dear, and delightful, namely good works. And for a long time have I known, monks, the wished-for, desired, dear, delightful and severally enjoyed results of good works done for a long time. Having practised benevolence for seven years, I did not return to this world during the revolution and evolution of an &aelig;on. Yea, monks, for the revolution of an &aelig;on I was an Angel of Splendour, and during the evolution I rose again in the empty palace of the Brahm&acirc;s. Yea, then, O monks, I was a Brahm&acirc;, the great Brahm&acirc;, conquering, unconquered, all-seeing, controlling. And thirty-six times, O monks, was I Sakko, the lord of the angels; many hundreds of times I was a king, a righteous emperor, a king of righteousness,<A NAME="page_246_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_246_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> victorious in the four quarters, securely established in my country, and possessed of the seven treasures. Now what was the doctrine of that region and kingdom? This is what I thought of it, O monks: What deed of mine, is this the fruit of? Of what deed is this the result, whereby now I am thus magical and mighty? This is what I thought of it, O, monks: This is the fruit of three deeds of mine, the result of three deeds, whereby now I am thus magical and mighty, to wit: alms, control, and abstinence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One said unto the monks: "I am delivered, O monks, from all fetters, human and divine. Ye, O monks, are also delivered therefrom. Go forth, O monks, on your journey for the weal and the welfare of much people, out of compassion for the world, and for the wealth and the weal and the welfare of angels and mortals. Go no two of you the same way. Preach, monks, the Doctrine which is glorious in its origin, glorious at the climax, glorious at the end, in the spirit and the letter. Proclaim a religious life wholly perfect and thoroughly pure. There are beings whose mental eyes are darkened by hardly any dust, but unless they hear the Doctrine they will perish. They will understand it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it true, Devadatto, as they say, that thou goest about to stir up schism in the Order and schism in our society?"--"It is true, O Blessed One."--"Enough, Devadatto. Let not schism in the Order be pleasing unto thee: serious, O Devadatto, is a schism in the Order. Whosoever, Devadatto, divides the Order when it is at peace gives birth to <I>an &aelig;on-lasting fault</I>, and for an &aelig;on he is tormented in hell. But whosoever, Devadatto, makes peace in the Order when it has been divided gives birth to the highest merit (literally, Brahm&acirc;-merit), and for an &aelig;on he is happy in Paradise."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The words {Greek: <I>aiwnion amarthma</I>} in Mark iii. 29, are the exact verbal equivalent of the P&acirc;li <I>kappa</I>.t.t<I>hikam kibbisam</I>, or, as the Siam edition has it, <I>kappa</I>.t.t<I>hitikam</I>. Schism is the deadly sin of Buddhism, the other four of its deadly sins being rare deeds of violence--matricide, parricide, saint-murder and wounding a Buddha. The deadly sin of the New Testament is resistance to the Divine operation, while that of the Mazdeans is self-defilement. (S. B. E. IV., p. 101.) The Christian and Buddhist ones are of long retribution, but terminable, for everlasting hell was unknown to the Jews at the time of Christ, and therefore unknown to the Master's terms. Only the Mazdean uses the language of absolute despair; but if the

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now not long after Pukkuso the Mallian had gone, the venrable &Acirc;nando placed upon the person of the Blessed One that pair of gold-cloth robes, burnished and ready for wear. And when so placed upon the person of the Blessed One it appeared bereft of its brightness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the venerable &Acirc;nando said unto the Blessed One: "Wonerful, O Lord! Marvellous, O Lord! that the color of the Tath&acirc;gato's skin should be so pure and purified. For when I placed upon the person of the Blessed One this pair of gold-cloth robes, burnished and ready for wear, it appeared bereft of its brightness."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Acirc;nando, it is even so. There are two occasions, &Acirc;nando, when the color of a Tath&acirc;gato's skin becomes pure and exceeding purified. What are the two?--On the night, &Acirc;nando, wherein a Tath&acirc;gato is supernally enlightened with incomparable and perfect Enlightenent, and on the night when he enters Nirv&acirc;.na with that kind<A NAME="page_249_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_249_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> of Nirv&acirc;.na which leaves no substrata behind: on these two occasions the color of a Tathagato's skin becomes pure and exceeding purified. And now, &Acirc;nando, this day, in the third watch of the night, in the garden ground of Kusin&acirc;r&acirc;, in the s&acirc;l-grove of the Mallians, between the twin s&acirc;l-trees, will take place the Tath&acirc;gato's passage into Nirv&acirc;.na. Come, &Acirc;nando, let us go on unto the river Kakutth&acirc;." "Even so, Lord," said the venerable &Acirc;nando, in assent unto the Blessed One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus have I heard. At one season the Blessed One was staying at P&acirc;.tal&icirc;, at the Goat-herd Shrine, in the haunt of the Goblin Goat-herd. Now at that season the Blessed One was sitting throughout the thick darkness of the night in the open air, and one by one an angel would touch him. Then the Goblin Goat-herd, being seized with fear and bristling terror, approached the Blessed One and when near him uttered thrice his cry of "Blighted! Affrighted!" and said in his fright: "This demon is thine, O Prophet!"<A NAME="page_250_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_250_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

The P&acirc;li <I>Samano</I>, in contradistinction to <I>Br&acirc;hmano</I>, is precisely the Old Testament prophet as against the priest. Buddha, however, persistently idealised the word "Br&acirc;hman," as in our present stanzas, to mean an Arahat. But in the familiar phrase, <I>samana-br&acirc;hman&acirc;</I>, the word is used in its usual sense, and I should translate: "prophets and priests," or "philosophers and brahmins." The <I>samanas</I> were the freethinking ascetics of the caste of the nobles, like Gotamo himself, who did not believe in priestly orthodoxy. They united the qualities of the Hebrew prophet and the Greek philosopher, having the fervour of the one and the dialectic of the other.</P>
