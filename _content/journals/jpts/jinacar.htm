<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A Singhalese MS., denoted by C<SUP><SMALL>a</SMALL></SUP>, containing text and commentary. It commonly confuses cerebrals with dentals, and generally writes the nasal with &ordm; (anusw&#257;ra) before all consonants alike.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) An edition in Singhalese characters (C<SUP><SMALL>t</SMALL></SUP>), published in Colombo in 1886, which has enabled me to correct nearly all the mistakes of the MS.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="center">NOTE ON MEDHA&#330;KARA</H2>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least four Meda&#331;karas famous in the literary history of Ceylon. The first flourished about 1200 A.D., and was the author of the 'Viny&#257;rthasamuccaya' in Si&#331;halese. The second was the &#256;ra&ntilde;&ntilde;aka Medha&#331;kara, who presided over the Council held by Par&#257;krama B&#257;hu III. about 1250 A.D. The third was the scholar to whose care Par&#257;krama B&#257;hu the IVth entrusted his translation of the J&#257;taka book into Si&#331;halese 'that it might be preserved in the line of the succession of his pupils' ('Mah&#257;va&#331;sa,' chap. xl., ver. 86). The fourth was our author, Vanaratana Medha&#331;kara (who was also the author of the 'Payoyasiddhi,'  also in Pali), and who flourished under Bhuvaneka B&#257;hu the Ist (1277-1288 A.D.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sa&#331;ghar&#257;ja Medha&#331;kara, author of the 'Lokappad&#299;pakas&#257;ra (<I>Journal of the P.T.S.</I>, 1882, p. 126; 1896, p. 43), was different from all of the above, and wrote in Burma ('Gandha Va&#331;sa,' p. 67). He is called Nava Medha&#331;kara (<I>ibid</I>., p. 64).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medha&#331;kara is mentioned as the author of the 'Jina Carita' in the 'Saddhama-sa&#331;gaha,' ix., 22 (<I>Journal of the P.T.S.</I>, 1890, p. 63), and in the 'Gandha Va&#331;sa,' pp. 62, 72 (<I>Journal of the P.T.S.</I>, 1886).</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_14"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>14</FONT></A> piled up the treasures, and cried: 'See, my father and the rest of my kin have gone to the world of gods without taking one small coin with them!'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_15"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>15</FONT></A> The Mine of Mercy grew sad at this, and thought: 'Although I have received all this store of wealth, I too must go.'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_16"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>16</FONT></A> He sat down in solitude, in his own beautiful house, examining the blemishes in his body, and thus admonishing himself:</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_17"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>17</FONT></A> 'Painful is the breaking-up of the body, painful also is its beginning; I am subject to birth, to old age, to disease.'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_18"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>18</FONT></A> With these and like reflections, having seen in many ways the blemishes in his body, he sent the drum beating about the city and sent word to the King.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_19"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>19</FONT></A> At the sound of the drums the beggars flocked together, as bees to a sweet scent, and for seven days he gratified them with the flood of the filaments of alms.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_20"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>20</FONT></A> When he saw that although the precious gifts fell like a shower of snowflakes, the lotus-plantation of treasures was not exhausted,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_21"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>21</FONT></A> amidst the tears of his kinsfolk, as a royal elephant flees from a forest blazing with fire, the great hero departed from his delightful house,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_32"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>32</FONT></A> Entered there, the brave one beheld in it the requisites for the ascetic, produced by Him of the Thousand Eyes, fine leaf-huts;</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_33"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>33</FONT></A> he adopted the ascetic garb, and he abode there for the space of seven days, stedfast in the Five Transcendent Faculties and the Eight Precepts.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_34"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>34</FONT></A> In the joy of Attainment thus produced, the holy ascetic one day, passing through the air, saw some people</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_35"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>35</FONT></A> sweeping the road. Descending then from the air, he asked the people: 'Why do ye sweep the road?'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_36"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>36</FONT></A> 'O Sumedha, knowest thou not? The Tath&#257;gata D&#299;pa&#7749;kara has attained to Supreme Might, and has set rolling the Supreme Wheel of the Law;</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_37"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>37</FONT></A> 'he makes the Canon of the Law for the world, and has reached the fair city Beautiful, and here dwells in Sudassana.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_38"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>38</FONT></A> 'We have invited him with our alms, the ruler of the world, and his four hundred thousand Brethren pure.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_39"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>39</FONT></A> 'For his coming, O thou of supernatural might, we sweep the path.' Thus spoke these people, giving joy to his ear.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_40"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>40</FONT></A> On hearing the word Buddha, the mine of virtues, highly delighted in mind, could not keep in his usual state,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_41"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>41</FONT></A> and the hero, asking a portion of the road which the other had begun, was given a rough place and began to make it smooth.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_42"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>42</FONT></A> Before that spot had been made ready by him, the one Lord of the world, worshipt by men and immortals alike, benefactor of the world, the great sage, entered upon the road with the pious ones.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_43"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>43</FONT></A> Then as he saw there approaching the Tath&#257;gata, blazing with six-coloured rays, happy in heart, he thought:</P>

 myself before this hero, the great sage, with his company?</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_45"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>45</FONT></A> For a long time it will suffice for my blessing and happiness.' With this thought, the nascent Conqueror fell down,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_46"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>46</FONT></A> and raising his lovely lotus-eyes, he looked; and again, as he lay there, thus the courageous one thought:</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_47"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>47</FONT></A> 'Should I wish, I could destroy the endless turmoil of existence, and become a novice of the Order, and enter the noble city.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_48"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>48</FONT></A> 'What use in disguise? By the extinction of sin, I having become a Buddha like this Buddha, supreme in the world,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_49"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>49</FONT></A> will ferry the people in the ship of the Law across the ocean of existence, and bring them to the City of Nirv&#257;na, my own happiness being extinguished.'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_50"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>50</FONT></A> Thus thinking, prostrate there in the mud, he gleamed like a golden plantain stem,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_51"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>51</FONT></A> beholding the beautiful form of the Buddha, shining with the six-coloured rays, the hero, jubilant with the joys that arose in him, longed for Buddhahood.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_52"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>52</FONT></A> When he came to the place, and saw the sage prostrate in the dirt, he who had been the Bridge of the World, seeing the other made a bridge for him,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_53"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>53</FONT></A> the hero, the Tath&#257;gata D&#299;pa&#7749;kara, the one Bridge of the World, the World's one Eye, stood at his head, and spake:</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_54"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>54</FONT></A> 'In time to come, this man shall be a supreme Buddha, Gotama by name,' and revealed his disciples, his native city, and so forth.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_55"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>55</FONT></A> This said and done, with his Order the pious one did obeisance to him, moving about him rightwise, and offered to him eight handfuls of flowers.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_56"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>56</FONT></A> Having done this, the ruler of the world with his company went to the city named Rammaka, a place beautiful with monasteries and houses.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_57"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>57</FONT></A> The other, hearing the Conqueror's speech, arose from the dust, delighted, and reverenced by the hosts of the gods with offerings of flowers and other things,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_58"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>58</FONT></A> and crossing his legs, sat down on the couch of flowers, the most austere, the most wise, Sumedha, conqueror of sense.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_63"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>63</FONT></A> and passing through successive transmigrations, he endured great suffering, seeking Nirv&#257;na in tranquillity by fulfilling the Perfections of Giving;</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_64"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>64</FONT></A> this chief of givers was like a magic tree, or a magic wishing-jewel, giving to the world all their desires, food or what not.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_152"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>152</FONT></A> Then Kis&#257;gotam&#299;, in the upper story of the palace, saw the King shining like the sun, and thus she spake:</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_161"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>161</FONT></A> Channa lay with his head on the fair threshold, for he thought, 'I shall hear my master's call'; and as he lay there, that most righteous friend and counsellor, giver of joy, bringer of good,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_162"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>162</FONT></A> the prince called him and said, 'Make ready the thoroughbred horse Kantaka, and bring him hither.'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_163"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>163</FONT></A> Channa listened to the order given to him, and went quickly and caparisoned the thoroughbred, and brought him.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_164"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>164</FONT></A> The noble steed, thus made ready by him, knowing that his master was to leave the world, uttered a neigh:</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_165"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>165</FONT></A> that sound filled the whole city, but the gods one and all kept it from the hearing of any.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_166"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>166</FONT></A> Then the delight of the virtuous thought, 'First I will go and see my own precious son, then I will become a Buddha.'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_167"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>167</FONT></A> With this thought, he proceeded to his wife's apartments, and standing upon the threshold, thrust his head within.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_168"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>168</FONT></A> He beheld his own son, lying like his mother upon a bed strewn with flowers, with the bed of the King of heaven;</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_169"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>169</FONT></A> seeing which the supreme ruler thought to himself: 'If I take my son from the Queen's arms,</P>

 down from the palace he came, and went to Kanthaka.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_176"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>176</FONT></A> To him spoke thus he who delights to do good to all beings: 'Kanthaka, in this one night convey me over gods and men.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_177"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>177</FONT></A> 'I will become supreme Buddha, and escape from the world, from the ocean of existence, the terrors of decay, the multitude of monstrous growths.'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_178"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>178</FONT></A> With these words he mounted his thoroughbred steed, white as a conch shell, and caused Channa to grasp its strong tail.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_179"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>179</FONT></A> When he came to the great gate, he thought: 'If the gate will not open by any means,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_180"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>180</FONT></A> 'with Channa holding fast by his tail, I will press Kanthaka with my thighs, I will leap over the lofty shining wall, and begone.' So thought the mighty one.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_181"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>181</FONT></A> Thus the strong one, and Channa, and the noble steed, each in his own heart thought of the way to get over the wall.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_182"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>182</FONT></A> But the gods who inhabited the gate, perceiving his thought, and delighted at his happy going, then set the gate open.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_183"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>183</FONT></A> Then Death thought, 'I will make this Siddhattha no Siddhattha'; and approaching, poised in air, he thus addrest him:.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_184"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>184</FONT></A> 'Go not forth, O most wise! On the seventh day from now the divine treasure of the Wheel shall surely be made manifest.'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_185"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>185</FONT></A> But the glorious one, thus addrest by Death, replied: 'Who art thou?' and M&#257;ra declared himself.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_186"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>186</FONT></A> 'M&#257;ra, I know that the divine Wheel will be made manifest. Go thou, and stand not here, for I have no desire for this kingdom.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_188"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>188</FONT></A> When the Great Being had thus uttered his supreme word, M&#257;ra, unable to entrap him, forthwith vanisht away.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_189"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>189</FONT></A> After this speech of the Sinner, Gotama at dawn renounced the glory of universal dominion, like a drop of spittle, and there remained.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_194"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>194</FONT></A> thus he proceeded upon that lovely path of thirty leagues, amidst all this festivity, for the remainder of the night.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_195"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>195</FONT></A> Reaching the bank of the river Anoma, he dismounted from his horse, upon a pure cool expanse of ground,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_198"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>198</FONT></A> He of the thousand eyes received the hair-relic as it rose into the sky, in a fair golden casket, bowing his head in reverence,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_199"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>199</FONT></A> and in the Thirty-Three he set up a crest-gem shrine, delightful to the eye, made of sapphire, a league in height.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_230"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>230</FONT></A> Thus, amidst all these festivities, like a flood, the glorious sole ruler of the three worlds, grass in hand, approached the bo-tree.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_231"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>231</FONT></A> The chief of men made a circuit rightwise about the bo-tree, which was like a lofty hill of silver set on a black coral rock,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_232"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>232</FONT></A> and stood facing the east, the wise one, on the firm plot of earth where sin was to be destroyed, and scattered the handfuls of grass.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_233"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>233</FONT></A> Then this seat became fourteen cubits long. Then, seeing this wonder, the supremely wise one thought:</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_238"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>238</FONT></A> Suy&#257;ma, chief of gods, with a fair yak's-tail whisk three leagues long, stood there fanning him gently.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_239"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>239</FONT></A> The god named Pa&ntilde;casikha stood there playing upon a lute of vilva wood, capable of many melodies.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_242"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>242</FONT></A> Whilst Indra and the companies of gods thus kept festivity, M&#257;ra the Sinner thought thus to himself:</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_244"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>244</FONT></A> He then created a thousand great and horrible arms, and with them seized all manner of gleaming weapons; he mounted upon his magnificent and fierce elephant, a hundred and fifty leagues high, named Girimekhala.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_245"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>245</FONT></A> He then, attended by an army provided with all manner of weapons; having many mouths, with flame-coloured hair, and great round protruding red eyes, their mouths awful, snakes issuing from their breasts,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_246"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>246</FONT></A> thither he came, roaring with a fearful sound: 'Seize you Siddhattha, and bind him!' Such was their command. At the sight, the assembly of gods was scattered, like flecks of cotton blown by a violent wind.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_247"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>247</FONT></A> Then Death created a harsh sound like deep thunder, and a wind; but he could not so much as move a corner of the fair robe of that blessed one.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_248"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>248</FONT></A> Then he caused to descend a horrible and terrific rain, swift as that which falls at the destruction of an age; but could not make one drop come near to the incomparable one. Seeing that wonder, the foul-mouthed one,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_253"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>253</FONT></A> exceeding sharp, like a knife, which would cut through even the noble King Meru like a thick sprout. This he cast at the mine of virtue, but it could do him no harm; but in a moment, as it passed through the air, became a canopy over his head.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_254"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>254</FONT></A> Rocky peaks, blazing with fire, thrown by the host, passing through the air became, as it were, a mass of garlands.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_255"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>255</FONT></A> Seeing this also, the miserable creature approached the hero, and said: 'This invincible seat is mine;</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_257"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>257</FONT></A> witness, M&#257;ra, that the seat is thine by reason of good deeds done?' The Sinful One replied, 'All these are witnesses,' stretching out his hand towards the host.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_258"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>258</FONT></A> And the host, with horrid voice, exclaimed: 'I am witness! I am witness!' Having thus caused them to declare that they were witnesses, he went on:</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_259"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>259</FONT></A> 'Who is thy witness, Siddhattha?' Then the incomparable replied: 'My witnesses, M&#257;ra, are not sentient beings.'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_260"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>260</FONT></A> Thrusting out from his brilliant red robe his right hand, shining like golden lightning,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_261"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>261</FONT></A> he pointed to the earth and said: 'Why didst thou cry out at the place of perfection, and art now silent?' Then from the earth</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_262"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>262</FONT></A> came forth hundreds of sounds like the sound of thunder. Clasping his clever and strong elephant close with his knees,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_263"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>263</FONT></A> on seeing this, he thought, 'Now he will catch us! now he will catch us!' and like a serpent with broken fangs, crestfallen and subdued,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_264"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>264</FONT></A> away he fled, with his host, even to the Cakkav&#257;la Rock, leaving weapons, clothes, ornaments, and everything, all scattered about.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_265"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>265</FONT></A> Then the company of the gods, seeing M&#257;ra's host in fear and misery fleeing away, exclaimed: 'Behold the defeat of M&#257;ra! Victory to Prince Siddhattha!'</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_266"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>266</FONT></A> Rejoicing, they worshipt the hero with oblations of sweet perfumes and scents, and returning, sang together in hymns of praise, clad in festal array.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_267"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>267</FONT></A> Thus did the mighty hero, sitting upon the immovable seat, scatter the host of M&#257;ra while the sun was still high.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_268"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>268</FONT></A> In the first watch, the supreme one obtained knowledge of former existences, in the middle watch divine insight,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_269"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>269</FONT></A> and then in the last watch he went through the Chain of Causation, until he grasped that knowledge thoroughly.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_270"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>270</FONT></A> At dawn, all the hundred systems of worlds shouted together. Becoming Buddha all-wise, he of the lotus-eyes, all wise,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_274"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>274-5</FONT></A><A NAME="pp_275"></A> There arose a doubt in the minds of certain gods, who thought: 'The glorious Siddhattha must have some other duty to perform, that is why he does not leave this seat.' Perceiving their thought, and desiring to set their minds at rest,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_276"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>276</FONT></A> the Ruler uprose like a golden pheasant, gold-coloured, light-giving, and ascending into the air, he worked a wonder.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_277"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>277</FONT></A> When by this means he had fully reassured the minds of the gods, for seven days he stood with unwinking lotus-eyes venerating the bo-tree and the seat of victory.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_278"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>278</FONT></A> Then, walking up and down in the noble arcade, bright with gems, like a storehouse of precious things, the pure one investigated the pure doctrine.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_279"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>279</FONT></A> Then beneath the noble ajap&#257;la-tree he caused the pure lotus-faces of M&#257;ra's women to fade, and beneath the mucalinda-tree he caused the serpent-King's thoughts to expand like lotus-blossoms,</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_280"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>280</FONT></A> and beneath the r&#257;j&#257;yatana-tree, the wise one, so fair in hue, gave himself up to the uninterrupted enjoyment of Attainment for nine-and-forty days.</P>

<P><A NAME="pp_281"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>281</FONT></A> He then used the water of Anotatta, a tooth-cleaner of betel-vine, and the goodly myrobolan drug brought by the King of the gods.</P>
