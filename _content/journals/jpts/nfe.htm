<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE following is a translation of the Tibetan version of <I>N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna</I>'s letter to King <I>Udayana</I>,<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> first mentioned by Max M&uuml;ller in the Journal for 1883, p. 72 ff., where a translation of the first eight verses from the Chinese is given. As might have been concluded at once from the note, quoted there, of <I>I-tsi"n</I>, one of the translators of our letter into Chinese (see about him M.M.'s "Renaissance of Sanscrit Literature"), viz., that it was learnt by heart as an introduction to religious instruction, we find that its 123 verses contain, in fact, a short exposition of the principal doctrines. Most of the dogmatical terms used or mentioned here are to be found likewise in the <I>Dharmasa.mgraha</I> (published in Anecdota Ononiensia, Aryan Series V., Oxford, 1885), which also is brought into connection with <I>N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna</I>. Chiefly we may mention: Verse 4--the <I>Anusm.rtayas</I> = Dharmas. 54; v. 5--the ten <I>Virtues</I>, Dh. 67; v. 8--the six P&acirc;ramit&acirc;s, Dh. 17; v. 29--the eight <I>Lokadharma's</I>, Dh. 61; v. 40--the <I>Brahmavih&acirc;ra's</I>, Dh. 16; v. 41--the four <I>Dhy&acirc;na's</I>, Dh. 72; v. 45--the five <I>Indriya's</I> or <I>Bala's</I>, Dh. 47, 48; v. 49, 50--the five <I>Skandha's</I>, Dh. 22; v. 52, 53,</P>

105--the three <I>&Ccedil;iksha's</I>, Dh. 140; v. 63, 64--the eight <I>Aksha.na's</I>, Dh. 134; v. 77-88--the eight (hot) hells, Dh. 121; v. 89-103--the other <I>states of rebirth</I>, Dh. 57; v. 106--the <I>Bodhya.nga's</I>, Dh. 49; v.108--the Avy&acirc;k.rtavast&ucirc;ni, Dh. 137; v. 109-111--the <I>Prat&icirc;tyasamutp&acirc;da</I>, Dh. 42; v. 113--the <I>Eightfold Path</I>, Dh. 50; v. 114--the <I>Four Truths</I>, Dh. 21.<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> In the same volume of the Tanjur (ff. 321-364) we find a commentary on our letter, composed by one <I>Blo-gros-chen-po = Mah&acirc;mati</I>, from which I give only the more interesting parts. Besides this, I have pointed out some striking coincidences with other Buddhist and Sanscrit works, principally the <I>Dhammapada</I> and its Tibetan compeer, the <I>Ud&acirc;navarga</I>; the <I>Hdsa"n-blun</I>, "Der Weise und der Thor," ed. by I. J. Schmidt, where some tales of the <I>Divy&acirc;vad&acirc;na</I> appear in a shorter form; and that large storehouse of Indian wisdom, B&ouml;htlingk's "Indische Spr&uuml;che." Other quotations are rare. For the Tibetan translations of the theological terms I have usually substituted their Sanscrit originals as far as they were known to me, and as far as they were not to be found in the Dharmasa.mgraha in the same order. Perhaps it may not be superfluous to remark here that a <I>transliteration</I> of Sanscrit words (in Tibetan characters) only occurs in the following places: v. 20, <I>am-ra</I> (<I>sic</I>); v. 23, <I>kim-pa</I>; v. 43, <I>ga"ng&acirc;</I>; in the commentary on v. 80, <I>&ccedil;al-ma-li</I>, and the translator's name at the end.</P></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the author of our letter, <I>N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna</I> (<I>Klu-sgrub</I>), it is known that he was the renowned founder of the <I>Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na</I>, <I>i.e.</I>, the later philosophical development of Buddhism, especially the school of the <I>M&acirc;dhyamika's</I>. As the typical representative of the whole of later Buddhism, he soon became the subject of many legends, that are</P>

<SMALL><P>[1. From the circumstance that our author leaves unmentioned certain categories that one wight expect--as, for instance, his enumerating only six <I>P&acirc;ramit&acirc;'s</I>--I do not think that we can conclude his not knowing them, and, consequently, his priority to their introduction, for, as the Commentator more than once rewarks, he writes for the use of a laywan (<I>khyim-pa = g.rhastha</I>), on whom these higher duties were not binding.]</P></SMALL>

to be found for the most part in T&acirc;r&acirc;.natha's history, and Wassiljew's "Buddhismus." But "of the historical N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna we know very little" (Kern). Generally, as a contemporary of Kanishka, he is put in the first or the second century A.D.--on the authority of the R&acirc;jatara"ngi.ni, and of T&acirc;r&acirc;.natha. Anyhow, he cannot have lived much later, since the first Chinese translation of this letter is dated 431, and others of his works (at least of those that are ascribed to him) were translated as far back as 402 (s. Bunyiu Nanjio, Catalogue Col. 370 fi.). T&acirc;r&acirc;.natha, indeed, makes him live 521 or 579 years, and contemporary, not only with <I>K&acirc;lid&acirc;sa</I> and <I>Vararuci</I>, but even with the rise of <I>Isl&acirc;m</I>. For it seems quite certain that he understands this latter by the <I>Mleccha</I> faith mentioned by him on this occasion (German translation, p. 79 ff.), though Wassiljew (p. 50 note) seems inclined todoubt it.<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> <I>Mohammed</I> has become <I>M&acirc;mathar</I>, who before had been a Sautr&acirc;ntika of the name of <I>Kum&acirc;rasena</I>;<SUP><SMALL>[2]</SMALL></SUP> the cry <I>bismillah</I> ("in the name of God")--a demon <I>Bi&ccedil;limli</I> (as Schiefner has remarked), and the "Mleccha-Rshi's" are called <I>Paikhampa</I> (evidently the Persian <I>paighamber</I>, the usual translation of <I>ras&ucirc;l</I>, " prophet "). Isl&acirc;m, too, is aptly described as the religion of injury, persecution (<I>hthse-va</I>, Schiefner: Besintr&auml;chtigung)--the feature of the new doctrine that must strike most the charitable Buddhist.<SUP><SMALL>[3]</SMALL></SUP> With this account compare the note, p. 304 f., of Schiefner's translation, where, from some other Tibetan work, the name of the founder of Isl&acirc;m is given as <I>Madhumati</I>, who had been born in the land (!) of <I>Makha</I> ( = <I>Mekka</I>), in the town of <I>B&acirc;gad&acirc;di</I> ( = <I>Baghd&acirc;d</I>; this shows us the way on which the news reached the informants of T&acirc;r&acirc;.natha).</P>

<SMALL><P>[1. It is a mistake of the German translator of Wassiljew's book, when he makes him speak of a "Tibetan translation <I>of it</I>," <I>i.e</I>., of T&acirc;r&acirc;.natha's work, as if there had been an original in Sanscrit.</P>

<P>2. Is it the same as <I>Kum&acirc;ral&acirc;bha</I>, occurring shortly before? and perhaps a hit at the celebrated Kum&acirc;rila?</P>

in the Tibetan of the subscription (which evidently cannot be ascribed to the author), <I>Bde-spyod</I>. In T&acirc;r&acirc;.natha's history, where his name on the whole occurs eight times, he is generally (six times) called <I>Bde-byed</I> (viz., 57, 12. 58, 8. 59, 18. 60, 7. 67, 1), once (2, 10) <I>Bde-spyod</I>, and once (56, 17) transliterated <I>Utrayana</I>. Another king Udayana likewise is called <I>Bde-byed</I> (v. 14 of the letter, cf. Schiefner, <I>Mah&acirc;k&acirc;tj&acirc;jana</I>, etc., p. 35 ff.). <I>Bde-spyod</I> would be in Sanscrit = S<I>ukhac&acirc;rin</I> (cf. <I>Dharmac&acirc;rin</I> Lalitav., 249, 9 = <I>Chos-spyod</I>, Rgya 179, 22 and Schiefner's note, translation of T&acirc;r. p. 2); <I>Bde-byed</I> = Sukhakara, both of which might be taken as an explanation of the meaning of Udayana. At any rate we cannot, as Schiefner does (T&acirc;r. transl. p. 72, note 2), simply declare <I>Bde-byed</I> to be an error. It seems to me rather that the older translation of the name of Udayana, king of <I>Kau&ccedil;&acirc;mbi</I>, who was born at the same time with Buddha, and later on converted by him (the one mentioned in v. 14), was <I>Hchar-byed</I> ("He who makes rise"), since he was so-called "because he shone like the image of the rising sun" (Lebensb. 235 and Rockhill, Life, p. 16, f. Note; also, Kon-tsegs v. 25 in Feer, Ann. Mus. Guim. ii. 217, and Mdo. xvi. 15, ibid., p. 262). But king Udayana ( = Sadv&acirc;hana) of V&acirc;r&acirc;.nas&icirc;, friend of N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna, was, it seems, properly called in Tibetan, <I>Bde-spyod</I> (which, indeed, also might express the meaning of <I>Sadv&acirc;hana</I>), and the two names, or the two explanations of the one name, were afterwards mixed up, as well as the persons themselves (v., for instance, Kern, Germ. transl., ii. p. 200 note). The king of Kau&ccedil;&acirc;mbi is mentioned sometimes in "Der Weise und der Thor" (60, 13. 64, 6. 69, 2. 229,6), as <I>Utrayana</I> (<I>Uttrayana</I>). Ssanang Ssetzen, in his history of the Eastern Mongolians (14, 10. ed. Schmidt), correctly has <I>Udayana</I> (cf. Schmidt's Note, p. 313). But the confusion is not at an end here. Chandra D&acirc;s, in the Journal As. Soc. Beng. <SMALL>LI</SMALL>., p. 119--I do not know on what authority--retranslates the Tibetan name <I>De-chye</I> (i.e., <I>Bde-byed</I>, according to his modern pronunciation) of N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna's friend by <I>Camkara</I>. And, in fact, we find this translation of

&Ccedil;a.mkara, again in T&acirc;r. 3, 9 (as the name of a Brahmin), whereas shortly before (3, 6) it is, as another man's name, translated by <I>Dge-byed</I>. Likewise we have the compositions with &Ccedil;a.mkara = Bde-Byed: <I>&Ccedil;a.mkarapati = Bde-byed-bdag-po</I> (51, 13. 16) <I>&Ccedil;a.mkara-nanda = Bde-byed-dga-va</I> (144, 8). Finally we find one <I>Ud&acirc;yana = Hchar-po</I>, a Purohita of King &Ccedil;uddhodana (Latitav. ch. ix. beg.), who is mentioned also in the Lebensb. 235, though with short <I>a</I> (what was here in the Tibetan text?). Compare also Eitel, Handbook s.v. Sadvaha, Ud&acirc;yana and Vatsa.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter appears in Tibetan in verses of 4 &times; 9 syllables, so that we may conclude the Sanscrit original to have been in Indravajra (as, e.g., Lalit. 30 = Rgya 38, 20 ff.). Only the last two verses (the Epilogue) count 4 &times; 11 syllables. The Tibetan verses generally consist of four lines of an odd number of syllables from 7 onward. Four &times; 7 corresponds to the Sanscrit &Ccedil;loka, and is, of course, the most used (I found it, however, reproducing the Sanscrit &Acirc;ry&acirc; in Lalit. 221 = Rgya 164). Sometimes two longer lines correspond to one Sanscrit verse, as for the &Acirc;ry&acirc; in Lalit. 245, 17 ff., we find (Rgya 177, 13 ff.) 2 &times; 17 syll., changing afterwards to 4 &times; 9. Even single lines of 41 syll. are found (Rgya 186, 9 ff.) to correspond to one Sanscrit verse (Lalit. 260, 10 ff.), the Tibetans here, apparently, mistaking the whole of four verses for one verse of four lines. There is not, or has not been found out, any prosody, properly so called, in Tibetan (cf. Foucaux, grammar, 213 ff.); at most we might observe a tendency to put heavier syllables in the first part of a foot, thus giving the verse a trochaical movement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fin!tlly, I may remark that the two translators of this letter aIso took part in the translation and revision of the first four voll. of the <I>Hdul-va</I> (<I>Vinaya</I>), s. Feer, l. c. p. 182, and the Ratn&acirc;nanta S&ucirc;tra, ib. p. 233, in the ninth century, A.D.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_95"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>95</FONT></A>. For the Preta's, in summer the moon herself is hot, in winter the sun himself is cold; the trees (in their region) are fruitless, and the rivers dry up, as soon as they look upon them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Comm</I>. By their want of merit the boughs of the trees are burned as by fire, and lose fruits and leaves. The pleasant and cool rivers dry up (as if) burned by the poison of their eyes (<I>mig gdug-pai dug-gis bsregs-pa</I>). Some of them are filled (instead of food) with fire and live coal, some are thrust into rivers of matter, filled with different kinds of worms; some are filled with excrements and urine. (Cf.

torments as Pretas in one run (<I>i.e.</I>, without interruption), the Buddha has declared to be their avarice and mean niggardliness. (s. Feer, ll. p. 303 f.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_98"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>98</FONT></A>. In <I>Heaven</I> also, though the pleasure to be enjoyed is great, the pain of dying is greater: thus thinking, noble (souls) do not wish for the perishable (joys of) heaven. (Cf. <A HREF="#pp_69">v. 69 ff.</A>)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_99"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>99</FONT></A>. The colour of the body becoming ugly, want of pleasure in (their) couches, decaying of flower-wreaths, appearance of dirt on (their) cloths, dust, that had not been before, arising from (their) body,</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_100"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>100</FONT></A>. These are the five prognostics announcing death in heaven, that appear to the gods who dwell in the land of gods, similar to the signs that announce death to the men on earth. (Cf. Divy&acirc;v. ch. xiv. beg. Prof. Windisch points out to me the similar passage in Ittivuttakam, Sutt. 83.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_101"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>101</FONT></A>. Those (now) who die off from the worlds of gods, if they have not any rest of (fruit of) virtue left, thence must irrevocably take their dwelling, according to their merit, among the Brutes, the Pretas, or in Hell.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_102"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>102</FONT></A>. Among the <I>Asura's</I> also, who, from their (spiteful) nature, hate (envy?) the splendour of the gods, there is much mental pain; and, though they have an intellect, from the inherent darkness of their state (<I>gati</I>) they are not able to see the truth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Comm</I>. They have an intellect (sufficient) to know the difference between virtue and vice, but, unable to stick to virtue in this state, they fall back to vice. "Darkness:" because, in the state of Asura, you are obliged to think continuously on vice, but in the state as god, thoughts and (power of) execution incline to virtue, there is a great difference between the states of god and Asura or any other (lower).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_103"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>103</FONT></A>. Since the orb is thus (constituted), that the birth as god, man, infernal being, brute, or Preta is (likewise) bad, understand (then) than birth (itself) is a receptacle of much harm.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_104"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>104</FONT></A>. If a fire were to seize your head or your dress, you would extinguish and subdue it (by all means), even thus endeavour to annihilate desire, for there is no other higher necessity (duty) than this.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Comm</I>. <I>Nirv&acirc;.na</I> is twofold: with, and without, a rest of the Skandha's; the first "quiets" all pain, the second "subdues" the senses. (Cf. Childers 267 b. Oldenberg, Buddha, p. 432 (transl. p. 427) ff.; the three &Ccedil;iksh&acirc;s, s.v. <A HREF="#pp_53">53</A>, also Ud&acirc;nav. vi. 11.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_106"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>106</FONT></A>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_109"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>109</FONT></A>. The Muni has declared that from Ignorance always springs the Conformations (in the text: <I>las</I>, "work"), thence Consciousness, thence Name and Form, thence the Six Organs of sense, thence Contact,</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Comm</I>. First gives the list of the <I>Nid&acirc;na's</I>, as it is to be found in Dharm. 42, and also in P&acirc;li s. Dhammasa"nga.ni 1336 (including the appendix <I>&ccedil;oka<SUP><SMALL>0</SMALL></SUP></I>). Then follows a lengthy exposition of the single items, and the series as a whole (two leaves), wherefrom only the most important part is given here. "Ignorance" is the not-knowing the truth, and not acknowledging the highest aim (<I>param&acirc;rtha</I>). In an ignorant fool arise, in consequence of (his) not knowing virtue, vice; and in consequence of his not knowing the constant (<I>&acirc;nejja</I>, <I>&acirc;ne&ntilde;ja</I> s. Childers), the <I>Conformations</I>. These are divided into (conform.) of body, speech, mind; here (in our verse) they are meant by Action (<I>las</I> = <I>karman</I>), because this also is divided in the same three parts (cf. Child. 454 b. Oldenberg 247 (transl. 241) ff.). By forming (lit. conforming) thoughts on the roots of these actions, <I>Consciousness</I> arises. This is sixfold (<I>i.e.</I>, the conception of the six senses, <A HREF="#pp_24">v. 24</A>; s. Was. p. 237 N). . . . <I>Name and Form</I> is the condition of the (embryo)

conceived in the womb as <I>Kalalam</I>, etc. (s. Was. p. 236), which not yet has any sensation, etc., and (on the other side) the (child) come out, that has assumed a body (<I>rgyur byas-pa</I>). The embryo in its four states is "Name," because it leads to existence (<I>bhava</I>), and falls into the senses (? <I>yul-la hgro-va</I>): the emerged and embodied (human being) is "Form," because the (feeling) produced by cold, etc., arises (in it; ? <I>gra"n-va la sogs-pa hgyur-va bskyed-pai phyir</I>). (Cf. Child. 258 a; Oldenberg, p. 232 (transl. 227) ff.). . . . "Thirst" is the wish not to lose agreeable sensations, to get rid of unagreeable ones, and not to keep nor to lose those which are neither agreeable nor disagreeable (s. Dharm. 27); again it ("thirst") is, in the S&ucirc;tra, declared to be three-fold, according to its direction to the reign of pleasure, of form, or of the formless (s. Child. s.v. <I>ta.nh&acirc;</I>). The "Clinging" is the violent desire (<I>hdun-pai hdod-chags</I>) of lust (<I>k&acirc;ma</I>), etc. (s. Child. s.v. <I>up&acirc;d&acirc;na.m</I> and cf. <A HREF="#pp_51">v. 51</A>; Oldenberg, p. 239 N. 1). . . . When the seed of Conformations is well watered with (the water of) Thirst and Clinging, the fruit of Being is produced (cf. <A HREF="#pp_50">v. 50</A>). It is threefold like Thirst: (the Being) of pleasure, etc. (s. Child. s.v. <I>bhava</I>). But here chiefly the past existence is understood. When any one is born at the end of (this) existence, he is subject, one after the other, to (the states) "Name and Form" to "Sensation." . . . The whole series is divided into three parts: "Ignorance" and "Conformations" are (<I>i.e.</I>, refer to) the past birth; "Consciousness" to "Being," the present; "Birth" and "Age and Death," the future (one). . . .</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_112"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>112</FONT></A>. This concatenation of causes is made clear (to us) by the Jina's word, and deep (in meaning); who perfectly understands this, he perfectly understands the teaching of the Buddha.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_115"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>115</FONT></A>. Therefore always exert yourself in order to understand the four truths, for even laymen (<I>g.rhastha</I>) who live in kingly estate will, by understanding (these truths), ford over the sea of sin (<I>kle&ccedil;a</I>).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_116"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>116</FONT></A>. Those that fulfil the law do not drop from the sky, nor do they rise, like a ripe crop, from the bosom of the earth, but, when you have abandoned (the state of) layman, dependent on former sin,</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_117"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>117</FONT></A>. Then it is not necessary to tell you in many (words) that you need not fear, as there is a useful counsel of this meaning: Subdue your mind, for Bhagavat has declared that the mind is the root of (all our) conditions (<I>dharma</I>).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Comm</I>. says the meaning is that, if your mind is all pure, you will be quite happy, but if troubled, quite unhappy (Cf. Dhampd. 1; Ud&acirc;nav; xxxi.23 f.--M.M.'s translation is, as appears, justified by our comm.).</P>
