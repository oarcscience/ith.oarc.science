<TR><TD>Had need not been for worlds, for earth,<BR>
Nothing the Lord of worlds would have produced.<BR>
This earth chaotic stood in need of hills;<BR>
Had this not been, He had not raised majestic ones.<BR>
Had there no need been of the spheres also,<BR>
Seven whirling ones from nought He had not made.<BR>
The Sun, the Moon, and all these stars<BR>
Could not shine forth if not for need.<BR>
Thus need the cause of all existences became.<BR>
The power also of man in need consists,<BR>
Then, needy man, be quick, proclaim your need,<BR>
That bounty's ocean may with mercy boil!<BR>
All mendicants distressed in the world<BR>
Their needs to all men do proclaim&#8212;<BR>
Their blindness, poverty, disease, and pain&#8212;<BR>
Mankind's pity with their needs to move.<BR>
No one will say:&#8212;"Give bread to me, O men!<BR>
Property and barns and stores I do possess."<BR>
God has witheld eyesight from moles<BR>
Because no eyes they need for their support;<BR>
They live and move deprived of vision,<BR>
At ease, though blind, in soil all moist;<BR>
By stealth alone they leave their domicile<BR>
Until their Maker frees them from that stealth,<BR>
With wings endows them,<A NAME="page_185_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_185_note_*">*</A> makes them birds<BR>
Winging to heaven their angel-flights,<BR>
Alway to dwell in the rose-grove of thanks to God,<BR>
Like philomels to sing a hundred melodies:&#8212;<BR>
"O saviour from all wickedness,<BR>
Transforming hell to paradise,<BR>
A greasy ball with light thou hast endowed<BR>
And bones with hearing; O most bountiful!"<BR>
Does intuition with the human frame unite?<BR>
How do all things with names combine?<BR>
Words are but nests, the meanings are the birds,<BR>
Body the bed through which the spirit-river flows.<BR>
The surface of this mental watercourse<BR>
Is not without its chaff of good and bad repute:<BR>
It flows, but you would say it stagnates;<BR>
It moves but you would say it stays;<BR>
From place to place were there no motion<BR>
Whence these renewed supplies of floating chaff?<BR>
That chaff is but an image of the mind,<BR>
Assuming every moment a new shape;<BR>
Like chaff its likes and dislikes float away;<BR>
The husks upon the surface of this watercourse<BR>
Come from transmundane garden's fruits,&#8212;<BR>
The kernels of those husks in yonder garden seek.<BR>
The water from that garden to the river flows;<BR>
If you your life's departure cannot see,<BR>
Behold in the waters this floating of the plants.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>All pride and pain with lust begins,<BR>
But habit will establish lust.<BR>
When custom has your humours fixed<BR>
Him you hate who draweth you away;<BR>
If you an earth-eater have become,<BR>
Who pulls your earth away your foe will be;<BR>
When idol worshippers to statues get attached<BR>
Him they hate who idols doth forbid.<BR>
When Eblis wished a prince to be,<BR>
Adam he feigned to despise:<BR>
"Was this a better prince than me,<BR>
Worshipped to be by one like me?"<A NAME="page_186_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_186_note_*">*</A><BR>
Dominion poison is, except to Him<BR>
Who cures all evils from the first;<BR>
Fear not a mountain full of snakes,<BR>
The antidote it certainly contains.<BR>
Give way to pride's dominion,<BR>
Who breaks it will your hatred earn;<BR>
No matter who would thwart your wish,<BR>
He will encounter darts of wrath.<BR>
Who means to weed my humours out<BR>
Usurps dominion over me.<BR>
Had he no evil pride in him,<BR>
Could fire of strife inflame his mind?<BR>
Had evil nature not got root,<BR>
How could the flame of opposition blaze?<BR>
Does he his foe conciliate?<BR>
Will he enshrine him in his heart<BR>
Because his evil humour has no root?<BR>
The ant of lust, habit a serpent made;<BR>
O kill the snake of lust at first,<BR>
Or else a dragon will your snake become;<BR>
But all mistake their snakes for ants!<BR>
Do you from sages take advice.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Man feeds on blood as embryo,<BR>
Believers thus by dirt get pure!<BR>
Whilst in the womb, man feeds on blood,<BR>
His warp and woof of blood consists;<BR>
When weaned of blood he milk consumes;<BR>
He morsels eats when weaned of milk;<BR>
But weaned of morsels Lokm&acirc;n<A NAME="page_219_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_219_note_*">*</A> he becomes,<BR>
Investigates things hidden and revealed.<BR>
Were one to say to embryos in the womb:&#8212;<BR>
"Without, there is a well-arranged world,<BR>
An earth quite joyous, long and broad,<BR>
Of blessings full, and various food;<BR>
With mountains, lakes, and prairies green,<BR>
Parks, gardens, cultivated fields,<BR>
The firmament so high and bright,<BR>
The sun, the moon, with hundred winds,<BR>
Zephyrs from north and south and west,<BR>
With gardens, banquets, nuptials,&#8212;<BR>
Its wonders cannot be described.<BR>
How tried you are in this darkness!<BR>
Blood you consume in this closet,<BR>
In dirt and misery confined;"<BR>
It would deny its state and case,<BR>
Reject this message with full force<BR>
As false, deceit, impossible.<BR>
It has no sense, but understanding blind<BR>
Its mind cannot conceive the thing,&#8212;<BR>
The negative mind hearing scorns.<BR>
Just such the crowd is in this nether world<BR>
When Abd&acirc;ls<A NAME="page_219_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_219_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> moot the world beyond:&#8212;<BR>
"This world is but a narrow and dark well;<BR>
Without, the immaterial world exists."<BR>
Such words their ears will not accept,&#8212;<BR>
A hope like this is thickly veiled;<BR>
Present enjoyments plug the ear,<BR>
The eye is dimmed by interests;<BR>
Just as the embryo's greed for blood,<BR>
Which was its food in womb's dark cave,<BR>
Concealed from it the present world,<BR>
The body's blood to it endeared;<BR>
Thus, unaware of blessings all,<BR>
No other nourishment it had but blood.<BR>
Man's lust for joys of present life<BR>
Eternal joys has veiled from him.<BR>
Your greed for this deceitful life<BR>
From true life has removed you;<BR>
Be quite aware that lust is blinding you,<BR>
Concealing certainty from you.<BR>
Truth false appears to you from greed,<BR>
Which hundredfold is blinding you.<BR>
Oh, free yourself from greed, like all just men,<BR>
That you your foot on that threshold may place,<BR>
And saved be on entering the gate<BR>
From all terrestrial joys and griefs;<BR>
Your soul's eye bright and true will see,<BR>
Unsoiled by unbelief, the light of Faith.<BR>
