<P ALIGN="center">BY E. REHATSEK, M.C.E., Hon. Mem. B. Br. R. As. Soc.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince of &Ccedil;ufi poets, Mull&acirc;n&acirc; Jell&acirc;l-al-din Muhammad ul-Balkh&icirc;ur-R&ucirc;mi, was born at Balkh on the 6th of the month Rabi&#8217; I. <SMALL>A.H.</SMALL> 604 (1st October <SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> 1207). His principal work is the <I>Me&#7779;navi</I>, which consists of six <I>daftars</I> or volumes, and treats on an extraordinary variety of subjects, stories, fables, parables, legends, and &#7730;or&acirc;n-texts, all permeated by the spirit of the &Ccedil;ufi doctrines; and second to it is his Diw&acirc;n, a collection of lyrical poems,&#8212;both known from the banks of the Ganges to the shores of the Bosporus. This poet, the founder of the order of whirling dervishes, who have numerous convents and endowed establishments

in Turkey, spent the greater portion of his life in that country, and is therefore called <I>R&ucirc;mi</I>, the Turk; but, according to the <I>Nafh&acirc;t-ul-uns</I> of J&acirc;mi, his visions began at a very early age in his own country. When he was five years old he had manifestations from the invisible world, such as sights of angels, of genii, and of men within the domes of glory. It is stated in a record in the handwriting of Mull&acirc;n&acirc; Beh&acirc;-al-din Vulud, that when Jell&acirc;l-al-din Muhammad, on a certain Friday when six years of age, was playing with some other little boys on the flat house-tops of Balkh, one of the little fellows suggested that they should jump over from one house-top to another; Jell&acirc;l-al-din replied that as such movements are peculiar to dogs, cats, and other animals, it would be a pity that human beings should imitate them, but that, if they felt any power in their souls, they ought to fly <I>heavenwards</I> together with him. That moment he disappeared from the sight of his playmates, who became sorry and raised a shout of lamentation whereupon he returned after a short while, but with the hue of his countenance changed and his eyes altered, and said, "Whilst conversing with you, I saw a company of persons dressed in green raiment, who took me up and showed me the miracles of the upper world; but when your cries and wailings ascended they again deposited me here." It is said that at that age he partook of food only once in three or four days.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that when Jell&acirc;l-al-din emigrated from Balkh he met Sheikh Farid-al-din A&#8217;&#7789;&#7789;&acirc;r at Nishap&ucirc;r, who was at that time well stricken in years, and who presented him with his <I>Esr&acirc;r-n&acirc;mah</I>, or "book of mysteries," which he ever afterwards carried about his person; he also imitated his doctrines, as it is said&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On being told that a certain man had said he was at his service "with heart and life," he replied, "Hush! Among men this lie finds credit," and asked, "Whence have you obtained your heart and life, that you can place them at the service of men?" He was nevertheless in the habit of saying, "I am not that body which appears to the <I>A&#8217;&acirc;sheks</I> (lovers of God), but the pleasure and gladness produced in the hearts of <I>Mur&icirc;ds</I> (disciples) by my words. Allah! Allah! when you obtain that gladness, and taste that joy, consider it happiness, and give thanks; that is me!" His&acirc;m-al-din was merely his amanuensis, but from several flattering references to him in the <I>Me&#7779;navi</I> he might be wrongly considered to have occupied a far higher position. To him he said, "It is necessary to sit knee to knee with the Avli&acirc; (pl. of <I>Veli</I>, saint) of God, because such proximity bears momentous consequences."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hisim-al-d&icirc;n was no doubt a faithful amanuensis and disciple, but on some occasions a little admonition might have been judicious; on the death of his wife he could not be induced for a long time to attend to his duty, and the poet remonstrated:&#8212;</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>"One moment to be absent from him is not good,<BR>
For separation will increase mishaps.<BR>
No matter what your state; attend on him,<BR>
Because proximity will love augment."</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that although a bird flying up from the earth cannot reach heaven, it nevertheless gains the advantage of being further from the net; thus a man who becomes a dervish, though he cannot attain perfection, is distinguished above the common crowd of men, and is delivered from the troubles of the world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worldly fellow once excused himself to him for his remissness in visiting him, but Jell&acirc;l-al-din replied, "There is no need of any excuses, because I am as thankful for your not coming as others are for your coming."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing one of his companions in a state of melancholy, he said, "All sadness arises from too great attachment to this world; as soon as you are freed from it and consider yourself a stranger therein, you will perceive, from everything

<!------------------------page 295------------------------>

<A NAME="page_295"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 295</FONT></A>

you behold or taste, that it cannot abide with you, and that you must go to another place: therefore you will no longer feel any anxiety."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also in the habit of saying that he is a superior man who does not grieve on being affronted, and he a generous man who gives no pain to one deserving to be affronted. Mull&acirc;n&acirc; Sir&acirc;j-al-din &#7730;unavi was a great man of the period, but not on good terms with Jell&acirc;l-al-din, and when it was reported to him that the latter had on a certain occasion said, "I agree with all the seventy-three sects of the Muhammadan religion," he determined to get the Mull&acirc; insulted. Accordingly he sent one of his followers, who was a learned man, to ask the Mull&acirc; in a large company whether he had really uttered the above sentiment, and in case of receiving an affirmative reply, to affront him with bad language; but to all his taunts the Mull&acirc; only smiled and replied, "I agree also with all you have said," whereupon the man returned ashamed. Sheikh Rakn-al-din a&#8217;ll&acirc; al-doulah stated that he had been much pleased with this meek answer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He daily asked his servant, "Is there anything in the house to-day?" and on receiving a negative reply he became exhilarated and thankful, saying, "Praise be to God, this day our house is like that of the prophet!" If the servant said, "Whatever we require is at hand in the kitchen," he was displeased and said, "The smell of Pharaoh is rising from this house." He seldom or never used wax-lights in his house, and was contented with oil-lamps, saying, "Those are for kings, and these for devotees (<I>&ccedil;al&ucirc;k</I>)."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a certain occasion a company, in which also Sheikh &Ccedil;adr-al-din &#7730;unavi was present, requested the Mull&acirc; to officiate as Em&acirc;m (leader of the prayers), but he replied, "We are Abd&acirc;ls, we sit down or get up wherever we happen to be; those endowed with &Ccedil;ufism and dignity are worthy to be Em&acirc;ms," and pointing to Sheikh &Ccedil;adr-al-din as one of these, he coutinued, "Whoever prays after a pious Em&acirc;m is just as if he played after the prophet."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day the Mull&acirc; being present at a devotional exercise, it occurred to a dervish to ask him what <I>Fa&#7731;r</I><A NAME="page_295_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_295_note_*">*</A> is, whereupon the Mulla recited the following quatrain:&#8212;</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>"Fa&#7731;r is essence, all else accident;<BR>
Fa&#7731;r is health, all else disease.<BR>
This world is all deceit and fraud,<BR>
Fa&#7731;r is of the next a mystery."<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been mentioned above that the Mull&acirc; was a disciple of Farid-al-din A&#8217;&#7789;&#7789;&acirc;r; him he recollected even during his last illness, when he said to his companions, "Be not afflicted at my going, because the victorious light will fifty years hence radiate from the spirit of Sheikh Farid-al-din A&#8217;&#7789;&#7789;&acirc;r. Remember me in whatever state you are, that I may aid you, in whatever garment I am." He also said, "Do not associate with any persons except such as are of your own kind; because on this subject my lord Shams-al-din Tabr&icirc;zi (may God sanctify his secret!) has said to me that the sign of a disciple (<I>murid</I>) who has found acceptance is that he never associates with strangers, and that when he suddenly falls into their company he feels ill at ease, like a hypocrite in a mosque, or a little child in a school. On his death-bed he also said to his companions, "In this world I have but two connections&#8212;the one with my body, and the other with you; this latter connection will not be severed even after I shall, by the favour of God, become separated and isolated from this world." On the same occasion Sheikh &Ccedil;adr-al-din also paid him a visit and said, "May God restore you to health quickly!" But the Mull&acirc; replied, "Let my restoration to health consist in the removal of the only remaining garment which yet separates the lover from his beloved. Are you not willing that light should be joined to light?</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>"Denuded of body am I, and <I>He</I> of unreality.<BR>
I roam and verge to bounds of union."<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last injunction of the Mull&acirc; to his companions was, "I recommend you to fear God secretly and openly, to be frugal in your eating, to sleep little, and to speak little. To abandon everything sinful, to fast and to pray much. To renounce every kind of last for ever, and to bear insults from everybody. Do not keep up any intercourse with fools and vulgar persons, but cultivate this society of men who are pious and noble. The best men are those who are useful

<A NAME="page_296"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 296</FONT></A>

to the human race, and the best words are those which are the fewest and the most instructive."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On being asked to appoint a worthy successor, he uttered the name of Chelebi His&acirc;m-al-din; the question being thrice repeated, he gave the fourth time the same reply. Being questioned concerning his son Sul&#7789;&acirc;n Vulud, he replied, "He is a hero, there is no necessity for any injunction about him." Then Chelebi His&acirc;m-al-din asked the Mull&acirc; whom he wished to pray over his corpse at the burial, and he said, "Sheikh &Ccedil;adr-al-din." He expired at sunset on the 5th of the month Jom&acirc;di II. <SMALL>A.H.</SMALL> 672 (18th December <SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> 1273), at the age of 68 years according to the Muhammadan, or 66 according to the Christian reckoning, at &#7730;oniah, i.e. Iconium, in Asia Minor, where he had spent the greater portion of his life, and from its being in the Turkish dominions he obtained the surname of R&ucirc;mi.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above Sul&#7789;&acirc;n Vulud was also a poet, and died at &#7730;oniah, <SMALL>A.H.</SMALL> 712 (1312). He is called Beh&acirc;-al-din, of the same name with Jell&acirc;l-al-din's father, who, when our poet was yet a boy, being displeased w&icirc;th the government of Khowarizmsh&acirc;h, determined to emigrate for ever from the district of Balkh, under the pretence of going on a pilgrimage to Mekkah. Accordingly he departed with this son and went first to Nishapur, where they made the acquaintance of Sheikh Farid-al-din A&#8217;&#7789;&#7789;&acirc;r, who had gathered around him many disciples, and who discovered the precocious talents of the boy, presenting him with the <I>Esr&acirc;r-n&acirc;mah</I> and uttering the prediction:&#8212;</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>"How quick, he said, will this unruly lad<BR>
Throw burning fire on anxious souls!"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both father and son continued their travels in the company of a valuable guide and spiritual teacher, Sayyid Tarmad, whose sobriquet was Burh&acirc;n; with him they visited the holy shrines of Mekkah and Jerusalem. They had not completed one half of their intended tour, however, when he took leave and advised them to settle in Turkey. Accordingly Beh&acirc;-al-din took his son Jell&acirc;l-al-din to &#7730;oniah, where they established themselves and ceased their wanderings. At that time &#8217;All&acirc;-al-din, the Seljukide, governed the country; he was so pleased with the company of Beh&acirc;-al-din that he became his disciple; when his father died Jell&acirc;l-al-din took his place, but he soon got tired of worldly honours, and, abandoning his position, dedicated himself wholly to spiritual life:&#8212;</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>"But schools and honours pleased him not;<BR>
His nature's aspirations were more high,<BR>
His pomp and glory seemed but folly to himself,&#8212;<BR>
Attraction of the spirit-world held his heart."<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sought consolation in the society of kindred spirits, the chief of whom were Shams-al-din Tabr&icirc;zi&#8212;whose name appears at the end of almost every ode of his <I>Diw&acirc;n</I> in token of affection, because Jall&acirc;l-al-din himself acknowledged him as his spiritual guide&#8212;and &#7716;is&acirc;m-al-din.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shams-al-din Tabr&icirc;zi, whose full name is Mull&acirc;n&acirc; Shams-al-din &#8217;Ali Ben M&acirc;lak D&acirc;d Tabr&icirc;zi, appears to have been a restless character and an innovator. He travelled about much and made many enemies. When Shams-al-din arrived at &#7730;oniah for the first time, he paid a visit to Jall&acirc;l-al-din, who happened to be sitting near a tank with several books near him; he asked what they were, and on being told that they were called <I>Kyl wa K&acirc;l</I>, he said, "What have you to do with them?" and threw them all into the water. The Mull&acirc; exclaimed with a sigh, "O Dervish, what have you done? Some of these were my father's compositions, which cannot be replaced!" Hereupon Shams-al-din put his hand into the water and pulled out all the books, one after the other; and lo, not one of them was wet. Jell&acirc;l-al-din was much astonished, but Shams-al-din rejoined, "This is joy and ecstasy: what do you know of these spiritual matters?" And their intimacy began from that day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shams-al-din was constantly roaming about. He wore a robe of coarse black cloth, and took lodgings in the caravansera&icirc; at whatever place he happened to arrive. He came to &#7730;oniah <SMALL>A.H.</SMALL> 642 (<SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> 1244), but could not remain there on that occasion longer than one year, as an attempt was made on his life. At that time Jell&acirc;l-al-din Rumi saw his friend for the

<!------------------------page 297------------------------>

<A NAME="page_297"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 297</FONT></A>

last time, and was so grieved at the separation that he withdrew himself entirely from the world, became a dervish, and founded the order of dervishes called after his name, and at present still well known in the Turkish empire.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Shams-al-din arrived in his travels at &#7730;oniah, in <SMALL>A.H.</SMALL> 642, he took lodgings in the quarter of the confectioners. One day Jell&acirc;l-al-din, who was engaged in teaching various sciences, happened to pass, with a company of learned men from the college, through the quarter of the confectioners. On that occasion Mull&acirc;na Shams-al-din sallied out from his lodgings, and taking hold of the bridle of Jell&acirc;l-al-din's mule asked him whether B&acirc;izid (a celebrated saint) or Muhammad was the greater? Jell&acirc;l-al-din said, "It seemed that on account of that terrible question the seven heavens had fallen asunder and had been precipitated upon the earth; a large fire appeared to issue from my bowels and to envelop my brains, the smoke whereof ascended to the throne of God, and I replied, 'As Muhammad is the greatest of men, what can B&acirc;izid be?' He rejoined, 'What do Muhammad's words, "<I>We have not known thee as we ought</I>," imply? whilst B&acirc;izid says, "<I>O God, how high is my position! I am the king of kings!</I>"' I replied:&#8212;'B&acirc;izid's thirst was quenched by one drop, and he boasted of satisfaction, because the vessel of his intellect was filled thereby. That light was as much as the little window of his house could admit, whilst Muhammad was subject to a great dropsy and thirst,&#8212;he was daily praying for closer intimacy.'" At these words Mull&acirc;n&acirc; Shams-al-din gave a shout and fell down senseless. Jell&acirc;l-al-din alighted from his mule, and ordered his disciples to carry him to the college. He placed the head of Shams-al-din on his own knees, took him by the hand, and they departed together. During three months they lived in retirement, engaged in fasting and prayer; they did not come out once, and no one ventured to disturb their privacy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the <I>Nafh&acirc;t-ul-uns</I>, in which the flight of Shams-al-din from &#7730;oniah is represented in a somewhat supernatural way, the year in which it took place is given as <SMALL>A.H.</SMALL> 645, and not <SMALL>A.H.</SMALL> 643 as stated above. In the <I>Nafh&acirc;t-ul-uns</I> it is related that one night when Jell&acirc;l-al-din and Shams-al-din were sitting together in retirement, a man from without arrived and beckoned to the latter. The Sheikh got up immediately and said to Jell&acirc;l-al-din, "They are calling me in order to kill me." Jell&acirc;l-al-din waited long in vain for his return; seven men had lain in ambush expecting him with drawn swords, with which they attacked him, but he uttered such a shout that all of them fainted away and fell to the ground. One of these men was Beh&acirc;-al-din, or as in the lithographed copy, &#8217;All&acirc;-al-din Muhammad, the son of Jell&acirc;l-al-din. When these seven men recovered their senses, they perceived nothing but one drop of blood, and from that day to this nothing more transpired concerning that prince of the invisible world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real cause of the attempt to assassinate Shams-al-din, and of his flight in consequenoe thereof, must probably be sought in his open disbelief in Isl&acirc;m, which Jell&acirc;l-al-din was always cunning enough to disguise tolerably well in his own utterances and writings. He, moreover, so monopolized the society of Jell&acirc;l-al-din that the disciples of the latter, together with his son, were determined to murder Shams-al-din. It is plain enough, from the last page of the <I>Me&#7779;navi</I>, that the above conjecture is true, as will appear from the following:&#8212;</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>"Some time he with his friend retired sat,<BR>
All alien spirits quite shut out,<BR>
Enjoying the pure draught of union.<BR>
He was the confidant of his good friend;<BR>
His pupils did lament and grumble,<BR>
'Whence came this ragged mendicant?<BR>
Whence brought he all this fraud and roguery,<BR>
To isolate so quickly our great Chief?<BR>
O God! Now Isl&acirc;m is despised, destroyed,<BR>
The dome of Isl&acirc;m is now led astray!<BR>
This robber is none but a heretic,<BR>
By God! his blood is free and free!'"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>

<!------------------------page 298------------------------>

<A NAME="page_298"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 298</FONT></A>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be seen that in these verses the 'great Chief' and the 'dome of Isl&acirc;m' is Jell&acirc;l-al-din R&ucirc;mi, whilst the ragged mendicant and heretic robber is Shams-al-din.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jell&acirc;l-al-din R&ucirc;mi's successor Chelebi His&acirc;m-al-din, whose full name is Sheikh His&acirc;m-al-din Hasan Ben Muhammad Ben Alhasan Ben Akhi Turk. Becoming the successor of a <I>Pir</I> or <I>Sheikh</I>, <I>i.e.</I> spiritual guide, implies also the acceptance of all his duties and the allegiance of his pupils; and if the Pir was a man of great authority, learning, &amp;c. his successor is also expected to be one. It appears that His&acirc;m-al-din got tired of the many Ghaz&acirc;ls composed by his teacher Jell&acirc;l-al-din, and requested him to write a connected and large poem; hereupon the latter pulled out a piece of paper from his turban containing the first twenty-eight distichs of his <I>Me&#7779;n&acirc;vi</I>, beginning with the words&#8212;</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>"Hear how yon reed in sadly pleasing tales<BR>
Departed bliss and present woe bewails!"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>and ending with the words&#8212;</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>"Here pause my song; and thou vain world, farewell."<A NAME="page_298_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_298_note_*">*</A></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jell&acirc;l-al-din said, "Before you ever thought of it, the idea of composing a work of this kind had been instilled into my heart from on high." The last piece in the <I>Me&#7779;n&acirc;vi</I> itself contains an account of the manner in which this celebrated work was commenced, and brought to an end by His&acirc;m-al-din, who wrote down every word of it as it fell from the lips of his master. Sometimes Jell&acirc;l-al-din was so full of his subject that from the beginning of the night till the next morning dawned he dictated to His&acirc;m-al-din, who was in the habit of again reading in a loud voice to the Mull&acirc; all he had written. When the first volume was completed the wife of Chelebi His&acirc;m-al-din died, and the work was interrupted, as alluded to in the first distich of the second volume:&#8212;</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>"Delayed was this <I>Me&#7779;n&acirc;vi</I> for a time.<BR>
Respite was needed blood to milk to change."</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that no interruption of any length appears to have taken place, till the whole work was brought to a termination. That His&acirc;m-al-din must have been an enthusiastic admirer of this book appears from the following words he uttered:&#8212;"When the <I>Me&#7779;n&acirc;vi</I> is being read aloud, all who are present get drowned in its light, and I behold a company of spirits from the invisible world who cut off with their swords the roots and branches of the faith of all those who do not listen with complete sincerity, and gradually drag them into hell-fire." But Jell&acirc;l-al-din replied:&#8212;</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>"Of verses mine the foes you see<BR>
Headlong dragged to flames of fire.<BR>
His&acirc;m-al-din, saw you their state?<BR>
Their acts has God revealed to you?"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above words of His&acirc;m-al-din imply that as apparently many sentiments contrary to the strict laws of Isl&acirc;m are uttered,&#8212;unless listened to with great and sincere attention, the hearing of the <I>Me&#7779;n&acirc;vi</I> will lead to infidelity, and consequently to eternal perdition; whilst the answer of his master is conceived in that tolerant spirit which permeates the whole <I>Me&#7779;n&acirc;vi</I>, and which ventures to condemn no one rashly.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt the <I>Me&#7779;n&acirc;vi</I> contains also many strictly orthodox and even bigoted pieces; it must, however, be allowed that there are many which can never meet with the approval of strict Musalm&acirc;ns of any sect. Such a piece is "<A HREF="sfrv3.htm#pp_2">Moses and the Herdsman</A>" (<I>Ind. Ant.</I> vol.
