<TR><TD>When a small sage professed the belief<BR>
That heaven is an egg and earth its yolk,<BR>
An asker asked: "How does the earth abide<BR>
In this great ocean of the firmament,<BR>
A lamp suspended in the welkin vast?<BR>
Does it slide neither down nor up at all?"<BR>
The sage replied: "The attraction of the sky<BR>
From all directions keeps it in the air;<BR>
As dome of loadstone molten standing fair<BR>
Holds iron with itself suspended high."<BR>
The man rejoining said: "Can heaven pure<BR>
Attract this sinful melancholy earth?<BR>
It so repels it from all sides alike<BR>
To fix it amidst awful hurricanes!"<BR>
Thus the aversion of the blessed saints<BR>
In aberration fetters impious men<BR>
In the repulsion of this world and next<BR>
For either hopeful pledges they have none.<BR>
You spite the servants of the Lord Most High<BR>
Because they are aggrieved at your life.<BR>
They possess the electrum and reveal it.<BR>
Then they entice your straw, your nature vile;<BR>
But when their grand electrum they conceal<BR>
Your resignation quickly turns revolt!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>All things attract each other in the world,<BR>
The heat allures the heat, and cold the cold,<BR>
A foolish portion fascinates the fools,<BR>
The well-directed the remainder lure;<BR>
The igneous attract the hell-destined,<BR>
The luminous draw on the sons of light;<BR>
Also the pure attract the immaculate,<BR>
Whilst the melancholy are courting pain;<BR>
The Zangi from the Zangi friendship seeks,<BR>
A Roman with a Roman gently deals.<BR>
With clos&egrave;d eyes you are dismayed indeed<BR>
Because the light of day rejoiced the eye;<BR>
The eye's assimilation caused your grief,<BR>
It long&egrave;d quick to join the light of day.<BR>
If eye again be thus dismayed to you,<BR>
The heart's eye you have closed! Why not indulge<BR>
That heart-proclaiming bent of your two eyes<BR>
Which longs for infinite brilliancy?<BR>
When absence of those mundane fickle lights<BR>
Distress&egrave;d you, your eyes you opened!<BR>
Thus separation from eternal lights<BR>
Dismay will bring to you; then cherish them!<BR>
When He calls me I must investigate,<BR>
Am I to be attracted or repelled?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The wisdom of the Lord by fate destined<BR>
To mutual love this family&#8212;mankind,<BR>
All beings must, obeying that command,<BR>
Reciprocal, as loving couples, stand;<BR>
Each couple in this world a pair must want<BR>
Exact as amber with a blade of grass.<BR>
The firmament salutes the earth beneath,<BR>
"I unto thee as iron to the magnet am!"<BR>
The sky is man, and earth his fitting spouse.<BR>
Whate'er the sky throws off, the earth receives;<BR>
When she no heat possesses, he it sends,<BR>
When she no moisture has, dew he presents.<BR>
The spheric sign of earth will earth bestow,<BR>
The aqueous sign humidity will bring,<BR>
The sign of wind will fleeting clouds afford&#8212;<BR>
Absorbing noxious vapours of the land;<BR>
The element of fire will heat produce,<BR>
Which issues from the flaming disc&#8212;the sun.<BR>
The heaven still rotates for the earth&#8212;<BR>
Like the husband for his wife providing.<BR>
This earth a faithful housewife represents,<BR>
Who toileth for the offspring she begat;<BR>

This unison endues the world with life!</TD></TR>

Maladies seventy-two do bodies feel<BR>
From the attraction of the elements.<BR>
Diseases try to tear the body up,<BR>
That the elements four may separate.<BR>
Four they are, these birds with captive feet,<BR>
But death, disease, and dissolution fell<BR>
Untie the ligatures of the nimble feet;<BR>
And liberate each elemental bird.<BR>
Attraction of these roots and branches great<BR>
Subjects our body every moment to disease,<BR>
That these connections may be severed all,<BR>
And every bird to its original fly!<BR>
But the wisdom of the Lord forbids this haste,<BR>
And keeps them join'd in health till doom arrives.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Attraction drives each dancing atom far<BR>
With other atoms to its special sphere,<BR>
It draws the gard'ner to the rosy grove,<BR>
Conveys the coalman to the furnace hot,<BR>
If you the nadir to the zenith scan,<BR>
Exceptions to this law you cannot find;<BR>
In fire, in wind, in earth; in water, not<BR>
Beneath the earth up to the lofty sky,<BR>
The same attraction must govern them all,<BR>
Affection, kindness, sympathy together<BR>
Obey this great governing pow'r divine.<BR>
Besides this impulse nothing is all else:<BR>
From this attraction ev'ry motion seen<BR>
On earth or in the heavens is derived.<BR>
The puny straw obeys the same attraction,<BR>
And clings to the electrum willingly;<BR>
Implanted in each nature is its bent<BR>
Compelling ev'ry man to his pursuit.<BR>
Distracted Mejnun this impulse obeys,<BR>
It hands to La-i-ly his chain to draw,<BR>
Compels Ferh&acirc;d for Shyryn to lament,<BR>
Commanding him Mount Biset&uacute;n to dig;<BR>
From heat the lamp will be a burning flame<BR>
Which draws the moth its proper doom to seek;<BR>
The bulbul sighing for the rose obeys<BR>
This bent when stung by brambles in his foot.<BR>
When this attraction strength and power gets<BR>
To love it turns, the body permeates.<BR>
Abundance of this feeling so prevails<BR>
That universal love the world maintains;<BR>
At first you nothing see but La-i-ly<BR>
If love's origin you investigate;<BR>
Although a flame a hundred thousand is,<BR>
It is deriv&egrave;d from a single spark<BR>
From which the greatest conflagrations rise;<BR>
It is its prevalence that fans the flame.<BR>
O let this fiery ardour be in us,<BR>
Its many sparks illuminate our hearts!</TD></TR>
