<TR><TD>The light of God illumes the light of sense,<BR>
And then the soul aspires to meet its God;<BR>
A steed without a rider knows no way,<BR>
It wants a king to know the royal road.<BR>
Behold the sense which governed is by light,<BR>
A fine companion is this light to sense.<BR>
God's light adorns the sensual light,<BR>
This is the meaning of <I>Light on light</I>.<A NAME="page_64_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_64_note_*">*</A><BR>
Light physical drags down to earth beneath,<BR>
But light divine exalts to heavenly bliss.<BR>
All things of senses in a base world are,<BR>
God's light an ocean is, but sense a drop of dew.<BR>
Although this motor cannot be perceived,<BR>
Unless in virtuous effects and in speech.<BR>
The sensual light is ponderous, inert,<BR>
Concealed within the eye's recess.<BR>
As you the sensual eye-light cannot see,<BR>
How find you light which is not of the eye?<BR>
This world is swayed like chaff by the unseen wind,<BR>
Obeying helplessly the grace of God,<BR>
Which now conveys this chaff to sea and now to land;<BR>
Sometimes it moistened is and sometimes dry;<BR>
The hand unseen is; but see the writing pen!<BR>
The horse gallops, no rider does appear,<BR>
In mountains now it roams, and now in vales,<BR>
It now exalted is and now abased,<BR>
It now drives to the right and now to left,<BR>
Is now in rose-groves, now in thorny paths.<BR>
Behold, the arrow flies without a bow!<BR>
Life can be seen, but where is Life of life?<BR>
Break not the shaft, it is a royal one,<BR>
Although its nullity the mover knows;<BR>
God said: <I>thou hast not cast it, but I cast</I>.<A NAME="page_64_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_64_note_dagger">&#8224;</A><BR>
The acts of God precede all other acts,<BR>
You must your anger break and not the shaft,<BR>
Your wrathful eye turns milk to blood.<BR>
O kiss the arrow, bear it to the king,<BR>
That shaft defiled, and moist with blood of yours.<BR>
The seen is weak, and mean and base,<BR>
But quick and strong the invisible is.<BR>
We are the game, but who is master of the net?<BR>
We are the ball, but cannot see the bat.<BR>
Where is the artist who now tears, now sews?<BR>
The naphtha-thrower who now quenches and now burns,<BR>
Who now an infidel will make Siddiq,<A NAME="page_64_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_64_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A><BR>
And now a saintly hermit of Zandiq?<A NAME="page_64_fr_sect"></A><A HREF="#page_64_note_sect">&sect;</A><BR></TD></TR>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="pp_2"></A>MOSES AND THE HERDSMAN.</H3>

<P ALIGN="center"><I>Mesnavi of Jell&acirc;l-aldyn-R&ucirc;mi, 2nd Duftur.</I></P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>Once Moses saw a herdsman on the road,<BR>
Who thus exclaimed:&#8212;"O God! O Allah mine!<BR>
Where do you live? May I your servant be<BR>
To sew your overcoat, to comb your head?<BR>
O God, my life I sacrifice to you,<BR>
With all my children, all my kin and goods!<BR>
Where do you live, that I your head may comb,<BR>
Your quilt may make, and thickly sew your coat;<BR>
And if some malady you overtake,<BR>
I would your comfort be, as kinsfolk should,<BR>
To kiss your hands, to rub your little feet;<BR>
When sleep you want, to sweep your little place;<BR>
Your house if I could see, I always would<BR>
Bring oil and milk each eve and morn to you,<BR>


<!------------------------page 92------------------------>

<A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A>

Likewise some cheese with bread and greasy cakes<BR>
So nice with leaven or with curdled milk.<BR>
These make and bring I would each morn and eve;<BR>
I would supply and you might eat the food;<BR>
My goats would all I sacrifice to you;<BR>
My exclamations all are prayers to you."<BR>
Thus senseless that poor shepherd spoke;<BR>
But Moses said:&#8212;"O man, whom do you mean?"<BR>
He answered:&#8212;"Him who has created us,<BR>
Who has produced this earth and wheeling sky!"<BR>
Moses replied:&#8212;"Your head is going daft:"<BR>
Esl&aacute;m you left, an infidel you turned;<BR>
What idle and blasphemous words are these?<BR>
Your mouth with cotton ought to be gagged;<BR>
Your unbelief will fill the world with dust;<BR>
Your infidelity revives the Dibadin.<A NAME="page_92_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_92_note_*">*</A><BR>
In need of quilted coats and socks you stand.<BR>
How could such things befit the Sun?<BR>
If you these ravings do not cease,<BR>
The world will be consumed by flames;<BR>
If fire has not appeared, then whence this smoke,<BR>
This life so black and spirit so perverse?<BR>
If you believe that God a bounteous giver is,<BR>
How can you belch out such stolidity?<BR>
A stupid friend is like an enemy.<BR>
Such adoration God does not require.<BR>
To father's or to mother's brother do you speak?<BR>
Of body and necessities to God Most High?<BR>
Milk is the beverage of a growing youth,<BR>
And trowsers are required for the legs;<BR>
But if a human being you did mean,<BR>
Has not God said:&#8212;"I am he, and he I?<BR>
When I was sick ye visited me not:<A NAME="page_92_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_92_note_dagger">&#8224;</A><BR>
Not only he; but I was sick also."<BR>
To him who neither sees nor hears your words,<BR>
To man, I say, they likewise nonsense are.<BR>
To speak unkindly to a bosom-friend<BR>
Deadens the heart and friendship kills.<BR>
If Fatimah a man you choose to call,<BR>
Though males and females both one genus are,<BR>
He will, should he be able, drink your blood.<BR>
In spite of his mild temper and religion;<BR>
Fatimah is a praise in female names,<BR>
Applied to men it is like wounds of spears.<BR>
To men their hands and feet all comfort bring;<BR>
The purity of God they would defile,<BR>
<I>He unbegotten is, begetteth not</I>,<A NAME="page_92_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_92_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A><BR>
But giveth life to parents and to sons.<BR>
All bodies must be witnesses of Him;<BR>
For everything produced here beneath<BR>
Created is and must corruption bear,<BR>
But made it is, and must a maker want."<BR>
He said:&#8212;"O Moses, you have sewed up my mouth,<BR>
By this repentance you have burnt my soul."<BR>
He rent his clothes and heaved a fervent sigh,<BR>
Towards the desert looking, sped his way.<BR>
A revelation Moses heard from God:&#8212;<BR>
"My servant you have driven away from me;<BR>
You have arrived the union to prepare,<BR>
And not for separation's sake:<BR>
If help you can, abstain from severing,<BR>
<I>Divorce I hate more than all other things</I>.<A NAME="page_92_fr_sect"></A><A HREF="#page_92_note_sect">&sect;</A><BR>
On each man I his nature did bestow,<BR>
To everybody an expression I impart,<BR>
Which seems great praise to him, but blame to you;<BR>
He thinks it honey, you as poison deem;<BR>
It light to him must be, and fire to you;<BR>
But roses bright to him, and thorns to you,<BR>
What he deems good, as wicked you condemn;<BR>
What he applauds, you often disapprove;<BR>
We from pure and all impure things are free,<BR>
As well as from anxiety and speed.<BR>
I man have not produced for gain of mine,<BR>
But blessings to bestow on those who worship me.<BR>
To Hindus their expression serves for praise;<BR>
The Sindhis by their own expression laud;<BR>
Their adoration does not make me pure,<BR>
They also pure will be and shedding pearls.<BR>
Externals, words alone we disregard;<BR>
The soul within, its state, must give account;<BR>
At hearts we look, whether they humble are,<BR>
Though speech may perhaps too bold be;<BR>
For heart is essence, speech but accident:<BR>
Thus qualities are not essentials.<BR>
But why so many words and metaphors?<BR>
Flames, flames I want, comform yourself to them;<BR>
The fire of love you in your soul must raise,<BR>
Burn up your meditations, all your tropes.<BR>
O Moses, formalists quite different are<BR>
From those whose inmost souls do burn with fires!<BR>
Always to glow befits the lovers' hearts.<BR>
No taxes, tithes are asked from empty towns.<A NAME="page_92_fr_dvert"></A><A HREF="#page_92_note_dvert">&#8214;</A><BR>
If sin he speaks, do not him sinner call;<BR>
If martyred and full of blood then wash him not:<BR>
Blood martyrs better fits than water does;<BR>
This wrong outweighs a hundred-fold reward.<BR>
In the Kabah the Qeblah cannot be looked at.<A NAME="page_92_fr_para"></A><A HREF="#page_92_note_para">&para;</A><BR>
What matters it if divers do not jerk their feet?<BR>
You must not guidance seek from the inebriate,<BR>
Who rend their clothes; can they be asked to mend?<BR>
From all religions love's belief differs;<BR>
The lovers' sects and rites are God alone.<BR></TD></TR>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<TR><TD>United are the senses five,<BR>
They all from one original spring:<BR>
The food of one is strength for all,<BR>
Each to the others drink supplies.<BR>
Sight by the eyes increases love,<BR>
Love in the heart will truth augment,<BR>
Truth every sense will rouse from sleep,<BR>
Taste friendship with the senses makes.<BR>
When an internal sense the bonds have opened,<BR>
Each other sense transfigured is;<BR>
When one sense things unfelt perceives,<BR>
To senses what's unseen revealed will be.<BR>
If one ram leaps a little from the flock,<BR>
All others follow in its track.<BR>
Impel the sheep of your perceptions<BR>
To graze in "pastures <I>He</I> produced,"<A NAME="page_268_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_268_note_*">*</A><BR>
To feed on basil sweet and hyacinths,<BR>
Ways to find, to rose-groves of truths divine;<BR>
Each sense to the others a herald will be,<BR>
And all to the heavenly paradise will go.<BR>
Your senses to your senses secrets tell<BR>
Without a tongue, a tale, or trope,<BR>
Although their story is the midwife of comments,<BR>
The surmise, source to speculate upon;<BR>
But things self-evident and plain<BR>
Admit no explanation or comment.<BR>
When all perceptions your senses have enslaved<BR>
The spheres cannot escape your ken;<BR>
When in the realm of husks questions arise<BR>
Its very kernel is proved to be but husk;<BR>
Amidst disputes of scarcity in blades<BR>
Their seeds you are to strive to find!<BR>
When spheres but husks will be, the spirit's light the grain,&#8212;<BR>
The one is seen, the other hid; start not:&#8212;<BR>
The body can be seen, the soul is hid;<BR>
But intellect is more concealed than the soul,<BR>
Therefore the spirit seeks the sense, and soars beyond:<BR>
You motion see and life perceive,<BR>
But that intellect fills it you forget;<BR>
Yet inspiration transcends intellect,<BR>
It is a mystery divine and unrevealed.<BR></TD></TR>
