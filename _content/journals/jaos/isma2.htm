<HR WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="center">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE following is a translation of that portion of an Arabic manuscript sent to me by Dr. Henry W. De Forest, missionary in Syria, which was spoken of in the introduction to a translation of the larger part of the manuscript, published in the last volume of this Journal, as for the time set aside. It consists of two fragments of a <I>Ris&acirc;leh</I>, or Missive, by one Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid El-Ju&#8217;fy, designed for the instruction of certain persons supposed to have "deviated from the path of orthodoxy," and chiefly taken up with relating a conversation which the author professes to have had with the Im&acirc;m Mu&#7717;ammed Ibn &#8217;Aly El-B&acirc;&#7731;ir. Who this Kh&acirc;lid was, whether a contemporary of Mu&#7717;ammed El-B&acirc;&#7731;ir, or not, I have not been able to determine. But the probability is, that he represents one of the numerous Sh&icirc;&#8217;ite seets which, after the El-B&acirc;&#7731;ir's day, as Esh-Shahrast&acirc;ny informs us, availed themselves of his distinguished name to give currency to their own opinions. It is to be observed, however, that the doctrine of this Ris&acirc;leh accords very well with the sketch given by Esh-Shahrast&acirc;ny of El-B&acirc;&#7731;ir's views; so that we may have here, at least, an authentic tradition of what he taught. As respects the heterodoxy opposed in this Ris&acirc;leh, there is, in some of its statements, an evident antagonism to the doctrine of the Ism&acirc;&#8217;ilis: as, for example, is the fundamental representation of the Amr, or Word, which is here the Absolute Deity, while, in the Ism&acirc;&#8217;ilian system, it is the prime emanation from the Deity; and again, in the view given of the Meshiyeh, which, with the Ism&acirc;&#8217;ilis, is only another name for the T&acirc;ly, while here it is represented as a Divine Volition caused by the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly; and yet again, in the statement of the origin of the world, which, in the Ism&acirc;&#8217;ilian system, is viewed as an emanation from the Deity, in consequence of his creative mandate, but is here carefully distinguished

<A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A>

as not in any sense the work of the Deity. But the opposition of this Ris&acirc;leh seems to me to be, chiefly, to the doctrine of the Gh&acirc;lis, or Extravagants; with some allusions to that particular branch of this party denominated the Nu&#7779;airis. What was said respecting these sects in the article above referred to, will enable the reader to appreciate this suggestion. It should be remembered, also, that these and the Ism&acirc;&#8217;ilis belong to the same general family.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footnotes to the translation are intended to facilitate the understanding of the text, without entering into any discussion of the doctrines set forth in it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portion of our manuscript translated in the following pages, was obtained through the courtesy of the late Prussian Consul General for Syria, Mr. Von Wildenbruch.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . . except me and my brother,"&#8212;let peace be to them both! Afterwards he said, "And no one knows us<A NAME="page_169_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_169_note_*">*</A> with verity of knowledge, except the Prophets and the Legatees, and the Believers, 'whose hearts God opens'<A NAME="page_169_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_169_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> to the faith, or our eminent Na&#7731;&icirc;bs,<A NAME="page_169_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_169_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A> who are elected, and whom we elect. Hearest thou not God, where he says, 'And whomsoever we direct and choose, when the signs of the Merciful are read to them, they fall down worshipping and weeping'?<A NAME="page_169_fr_sect"></A><A HREF="#page_169_note_sect">&sect;</A> And he upbraids the other party, saying, 'And when it is said to them, "Worship ye the Merciful," they say, "And what is the Merciful? shall we worship that which thou commandest us?" and it increases their shyness,'<A NAME="page_169_fr_dvert"></A><A HREF="#page_169_note_dvert">&#8214;</A>&#8212;meaning, that they are shy of the disclosure to them of the knowledge of the verity of the science of the hidden sense, pertaining to the knowledge of the Prince of the believers &#8217;Aly Ibn Ab&ucirc; &#7788;&acirc;lib,&#8212;let peace from him be to us!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And know thou, O Kh&acirc;lid, that this name means, by a similitude, the Merciful, which is one of the names of the prince of the believers &#8217;Aly Ibn Ab&ucirc; &#7788;&acirc;lib,&#8212;let peace be him! and that the Compassionate is, by a similitude, a derived name among the names of the Envoy Mu&#7717;ammed,&#8212;let the divine benediction and peace be to him and to his family! Hearest thou not the &#7730;ur&acirc;n, where it says,

<!------------------------page 170------------------------>

<A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A>

'Verily an Envoy has come to you from among yourselves, to whom it is a grievous thing that ye are corrupted, who is eager for your being believers, mild, compassionate,' and so on, to the end of the s&ucirc;rah?<A NAME="page_170_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_170_note_*">*</A> So then the Merciful is a name of the Prince of the believers &#8217;Aly Ibn Ab&ucirc; &#7788;&acirc;lib,&#8212;let peace be to him! and the Compassionate is a name of Mu&#7717;ammed,&#8212;let the divine benediction and peace be to him!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And they are shy, only forasmuch as, after the N&acirc;&#7789;i&#7731; has called them to himself, they respond to him, but, after he has said to them, 'To-morrow, will he be gracious whose confederate I am,'&#8212;to wit, &#8217;Aly his confederate,&#8212;they shy of covenanting with him, and shy of the N&acirc;&#7789;i&#7731;; and that is from a shyness of following the N&acirc;&#7789;i&#7731;, which is from the contrariness which besets them. And know thou, that, as for those others, of whom he speaks, when the signs of the Merciful are read to them, they fall down worshipping and weeping.'"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And know thou, O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, that they are these twelve who are &#7716;ujjehs of the Im&acirc;ms,&#8212;let peace be to them! the Executors of the bidding of God, and the Attendants, who have sojourned only in eighteen men, whom I will by and by enumerate to thee, if God will, and who are those who were on the side of the Prince of the believers &#8217;Aly,&#8212;let peace from him be to us! Hearest thou not the saying of the Envoy Mu&#7717;ammed,&#8212;let the divine benediction and peace be to him! 'The Believer sees by the Light of God'&#8212;meaning only them, these who pertain to him, and who are his &#7716;ujjehs? And whoever adheres to them, they are the light of the lights of his wisdom, as seeing by the Light of God; for God is not beheld except by his Light, and how is it possible for man to see by his own light, or to be directed by the Candle?<A NAME="page_170_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_170_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> But that saying of his, 'sees by the Light of God,' means his Deity,<A NAME="page_170_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_170_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A> who bestows upon him his acceptance, and to whom he will return. And they must of necessity return to the earth with their Master, whenever the &#7730;&acirc;im,&#8212;let peace be to his memory! takes his stand."</P>

<A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in like manner El-B&acirc;&#7731;ir,&#8212;let peace be to him! said, "Whoever believes not in our rotation, and our returning, he is not ours, and we are not his,"&#8212;meaning,&#8212;let peace be to him! that the imamship is never cut off, and that it is transmitted from one group of seven to another group of seven, to the &#7730;&acirc;im,&#8212;let peace be to him! by a return of something hidden, not outward, of something subtle, not gross; "therefore the knowledge of that is highly necessary."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it is necessary for thee that thou shouldst acknowledge the T&acirc;ly in that which is made, and in that which appears, and its Measure<A NAME="page_171_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_171_note_*">*</A> which it takes to itself, namely, its Spiritual Measure, and its Corporeal Measure; and that there is no distinction between the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly; and that one of them excells not the other, either in respect to spiritual quality, or in respect to corporeal quality, or in respect to their science, in which they shroud themselves, or in respect to the showing of their miraculous signs. And so we say as follows. O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, thou shalt not be extravagant respecting the Prince of believers,&#8212;let peace from him be to us! devoid of science. O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, the Prince of the belivers,&#8212;let peace from him be to us! is as when sandal is measured with sandal, part answering, all but a trifle, to part. For he is the reinforcement of the N&acirc;&#7789;i&#7731;,<A NAME="page_171_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_171_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> by means of the S&acirc;bi&#7731;, as something spiritual, without any thing corporeal, and the reinforcement of the As&acirc;s of the higher world, in the image of El-Fat&#7717;,<A NAME="page_171_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_171_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A> by means of the T&acirc;ly. Hearest thou not the Prophet,&#8212;let peace be to him! who says, 'I and &#8217;Aly are like two <I>h&eacute;s</I>, and the putting together of the two fore-fingers'?&#8212;wherein he shows thee that there is no distinction between the two, and between the Im&acirc;m<A NAME="page_171_fr_sect"></A><A HREF="#page_171_note_sect">&sect;</A> and the Legatee,&#8212;let peace be to him! And if he [&#8217;Aly] shows miraculous signs, he says,&#8212;let peace be to him! 'But the Prophet,&#8212;let peace be to him and to his Family! has already brought to pass things miraeulous, beyond the scope of inquirers respecting them, such as his dividing the moon at Mekkeh, and his

<!------------------------page 172------------------------>

<A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A>

turning out the serpent from the precincts of the Ka&#8217;beh and his overpowering those who designed evil to Mekkeh, so that he sent upon them the torrent, and his bringing the Distinguisher.' And to each of them belongs a determined Measure, which he exceeds not, and it is not at all necessary that there should be distinction made between the two. Has not God said in the &#7730;ur&acirc;n, '"We distinguish not between his several Envoys, and we are resigned to him,"'&#8212;meaning by that his Envoys and his Legatees,&#8212;'and say, "We hear and we obey thy pardon, O our Lord! and to thee will be our coming,"'<A NAME="page_172_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_172_note_*">*</A>&#8212;the meaning of, 'O our Lord!' which points to the Amr of the Creator,&#8212;let it be magnified and glorified! being that there is no distinction between the two, because they are the Correspondents of the two Eternal Roots?<A NAME="page_172_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_172_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> And know thou, O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, that I shall by and by return to the Primary Attribute,<A NAME="page_172_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_172_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A> and explain it to thee with an explanation which thou wilt understand. As for the Prince of the believers,&#8212;let peace from him be to us! he is the Measure of the T&acirc;ly, which is that which causes bodies to be, and creates them, and does well the forming of them; while it is the S&acirc;bi&#7731;, of which the Correspondent is Mu&#7717;ammed,&#8212;let the divine benediction and peace be to him! which causes spirits to be. All of them together are by means of the two Roots. Hence, O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, spirits excell not bodies, nor do bodies excell spirits, because the two are of one rank; although bodles alone stay in the dust without ever parting from it, while spirits stay but for a moment of time in the dust, (which is the moment of time while body moves from place to to place, together with which they move from place to place,) until body is stationary, whereupon they, the spirits, mount to their world. And know thou, O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, that spirit is subject to punishment which body is not

<!------------------------page 173------------------------>

<A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A>

subject to; for, if it believes, then it goes to happiness, and if it is refractory, then, to the punishment of Es-Sa&#8217;&icirc;r, while body is not known, after that, as long as its way is in the dust."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And know thou, that it is that on account of which the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly are named.<A NAME="page_173_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_173_note_*">*</A> And the two match in respect to the state of being, because each of them is indispensable to its mate. For the Amr of the Creator,&#8212;let its memory be glorified! has made all things to be reciprocal and conjoined, so that there is a conjunction in a reciprocity, and a reciprocity in a conjunction; while the Amr of the Creator is separate, without any reciprocal, or any resemblant, or any associate, or any like, or any image; and number applies not to it;<A NAME="page_173_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_173_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> nor are conjectures applicable; and the intellect of man embraces it not,&#8212;let its name be blessed, clear of that which they say by a great superiority! And know thou, O Kh&acirc;lid, that any thing pertaining to the T&acirc;ly, is completed only through the S&acirc;bi&#7731;; for its [the T&acirc;ly's] reinforcements are from the S&acirc;bi&#7731;, because, otherwise, it [the thing] would be a mockery. And if spirits were not, bodies would not articulate speech; and if bodies were not, spirits would not stay; so that they are indispensable to one another. It is like water in the pitcher: if the pitcher were not, the water would not stay; and if it were not for the use of the water, it would not come to the pitcher; and its use consists in the union of the two things, one following the other. So then 'Glory be to him who created all the mates of that which the earth brings forth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not'!"<A NAME="page_173_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_173_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said I, "O my master,&#8212;my life for thee! and what are 'the mates'?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereupon he said, "Mu&#7717;ammed and &#8217;Aly,&#8212;let peace be to them both! are 'all the mates;' and 'of that which the earth brings forth' are our &#7716;ujjehs; and 'of themselves'

<!------------------------page 174------------------------>

<A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A>

are the Im&acirc;ms, one being of another, Light of Light, Im&acirc;m of Im&acirc;m, and thus ever, without intermission, without cessation, who are undiminished, up to the determined bound, and the known limit, which is our &#7730;&acirc;im, 'on the day when riches profit not, nor sons, only be who brings to God a resigned heart.'"<A NAME="page_174_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_174_note_*">*</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then the S&acirc;bi&#7731;, of which the Correspondent is Mu&#7717;ammed,&#8212;let the divine benediction and peace be to him! is the Creator as to spirits; and the T&acirc;ly, of which the Correspondent is the Prince of the believers,&#8212;let peace from him be to us!&#8212;is the Creator as to bodies. Hearest thou not that which says, 'As for us, we cause to live, and we cause to die, and to us will be the coming'<A NAME="page_174_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_174_note_dagger">&#8224;</A>&#8212;wherein shows thee the origin of life, and considers the origin of death, as something hidden, not outward? Therefore understand thou that. And as for the Amr of the Creator, not anything is above it, and no occasion has to do with it, and it pertains not to any occasion;<A NAME="page_174_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_174_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A> and there is no deity like it; and not any thing resembles it; and it is 'the Hearer, the Knowing One.'<A NAME="page_174_fr_sect"></A><A HREF="#page_174_note_sect">&sect;</A> That it is which committed all things to these two Higher Measures; and to them it will fall to reckon with creatures, on the day of reckoning. Hearest thou not that which says, 'Verily, to us will be their coming; and on us will devolve the reckoning with them'?<A NAME="page_174_fr_dvert"></A><A HREF="#page_174_note_dvert">&#8214;</A> So then let the Amr, namely, the Amr of the Creator,&#8212;let it be exalted! be glorified, clear of all things! forasmuch as it committed the same to the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly, and left to them Higher Similitudes and Earthly Resemblances,<A NAME="page_174_fr_para"></A><A HREF="#page_174_note_para">&para;</A> which renew themselves, without his giving to be seen in them, and are unchanged, without his causing to be known through them."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And know thou, O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, that the Prince of the believers, together with Mu&#7717;ammed,&#8212;let the divine benediction be to them both! must of necessity descend to

<!------------------------page 175------------------------>

<A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A>

the earth; and that, at the beginning of every new period, on the completion of the period of the seven Im&acirc;ms, simultaneously with the coming of every N&acirc;&#7789;i&#7731; and Legatee. For, as for Mu&#7717;ammed,&#8212;let the divine benediction and peace be to him! he reinforces the N&acirc;&#7789;i&#7731; in the first of the Transients; and so, when the law is finished for the latter, the Veil is withdrawn, as respects him, from the former.<A NAME="page_175_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_175_note_*">*</A> And so be it known, that his reinforcement is from both these Earthly Measures, having to him and to his As&acirc;s accompanying him the force of the two Higher Measures; for the Prince of the believers,&#8212;let peace from him be to us! reinforces his As&acirc;s, as something hidden, not outward,<A NAME="page_175_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_175_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> just as Mu&#7717;ammed,&#8212;let peace be to him and to his Family! reinforces him. And so, what with the two Higher Measures, which reinforce the two Lower Measures, come to be the Four Measures. And in like manner, the two Lower Measures reinforce bodies which they set apart, and elect, and in which they consequently cause to appear and to dwell spirits inspired by the Pen;<A NAME="page_175_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_175_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A> and by and by I will acquaint thee with them, and their names, in order that the verity of thy knowledge may be made perfect."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, know thou that the S&acirc;bi&#7731; delivered up its science and its reinforcement to the Meshiyeh, which was caused by the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly, upon their glorifying and hallowing.<A NAME="page_175_fr_sect"></A><A HREF="#page_175_note_sect">&sect;</A> For all of them together form the council of sciences, and accordingly the T&acirc;ly committed thereto the reinforcernent of its science; whereupon it glorified, and its glorifying was that it said, 'Be thou glorified, O Eternal of Eternals! verily, thou makest strong that which thou dost create.' And upon that, there came to it [the Meshiyeh] an Amr-reinforcernent, from the First Cause, which is the

<!------------------------page 176------------------------>

<A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A>

Amr of the Creator, the Veritable Deity,<A NAME="page_176_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_176_note_*">*</A>&#8212;let it be exalted! whereby it strengthened it. Afterwards, the Meshiyeh beheld the S&acirc;bi&#7731; with the eye of predestination, and beheld the T&acirc;ly with the eye of love; whereupon there came to be, for the two in the earth, a Correspondent,<A NAME="page_176_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_176_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> like to that which had come to be, for the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly. And so it reinforces the N&acirc;&#7789;i&#7731;, with its Amr-reinforcement, and its reinforcements which are from the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly. The Prophet,&#8212;let the divine benediction and peace be to him and to his Family! speaks of Fa&#7789;imeh, where he denominates her 'the mother of her father,' with the meaning that she reinforces her father, with her Amr-reinforcements, and the reinforcements of the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly; for all that a certain party has said that the F&acirc;&#7789;imeh-Station,<A NAME="page_176_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_176_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A>&#8212;let peace be to her! was the Station of a male person, that is, Gabriel,&#8212;let peace be to him! And this is an error, because God says respecting them, 'As for them, they have the angels with the naming of woman, while yet they have no knowledge concerning it. That which they follow is not any thing but supposition, and their own desire, for all there has come to them direction from their Lord.'<A NAME="page_176_fr_sect"></A><A HREF="#page_176_note_sect">&sect;</A> And it [the Meshiyeh] teaches those things which are unknown, except to the two Higher Measures, by an aiding on their part, derived from his Word,&#8212;let it be exalted! through the medium of the two As&acirc;ses.<A NAME="page_176_fr_dvert"></A><A HREF="#page_176_note_dvert">&#8214;</A> And as for this, again, it is a tradition handed down from the Prophet,&#8212;let the divine benediction and peace be to him! that he said, 'On the night when I was borne up to heaven, and entered the Garden, I ate a quince; and so, after I had descended to the earth, I went in to Khad&icirc;jeh, and she became with child

<!------------------------page 177------------------------>

<A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A>

of F&acirc;&#7789;imeh,'&#8212;let, peace be to her! and the meaning of the 'quince' is that the higher reinforcement manifests itself only by the Meshiyeh; and so the Meshiyeh willed to have in the earth a fixed Correspondent, and that consisting of the reinforcement of the S&acirc;bi&#7731;, together with the will of the Amr of the Creator,&#8212;let it be exalted! and efficiencies from the T&acirc;ly; whereupon F&acirc;&#7789;imeh,&#8212;let peace be to her! came to be, by the causation of the two Eternal Lights,<A NAME="page_177_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_177_note_*">*</A> and on account of their manifestation by the two Lower Measures.<A NAME="page_177_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_177_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> And to her pertain, in heaven, two Measures, and on the earth four. And by reason of that, the Prophet,&#8212;let the divine benediction and peace be to him! says, 'Verily, F&acirc;&#7789;imeh has two names in heaven, and on the earth four,'&#8212;in allusion to the Measures which pertain to her in heaven, and those which pertain to her on the earth."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid El-Ju&#8217;fy, Thereupon I said, "O my Master, I inquire of thee respecting her reality,&#8212;it is thine to tell,&#8212;and respecting the reality of those who constituted for thee this rank, and respecting the reality of the Im&acirc;ms without end whom people pride themselves in. Does not that which thou tellest me concerning the Envoy,&#8212;let the divine benediction and peace be to him and to his family! respect the verity of his Station? so then tell me, with regard to El-&#7716;asan and El-&#7716;usein, how was the beginning of the Amr to them."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El-B&acirc;&#7731;ir,&#8212;let his peace be to us! said, "As for the Envoy, his Station was the S&acirc;bi&#7731;,<A NAME="page_177_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_177_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A> and he was its Correspondent.

And in like manner, as for F&acirc;&#7789;imeh, all the misfortunes and things disagreeable which happened to her, rested upon the Image, that is, the Veil; and it must of necessity be, that every Na&#7789;i&#7731; and every As&acirc;s has a Veil which hides him. And in like manner, as for El-&#7716;asan and El-&#7716;usein,&#8212;let peace be to them both! they had two Correspondents; and so, whatever there was of misfortune, or trial, or affliction, it befell the Correspondent,&#8212;and may the enemies of the Im&acirc;ms,&#8212;let peace be to them! suffer the penalties, because they insist that that punishment befell them!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And know thou, O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, that El-&#7716;asan and El-&#7716;usein,&#8212;let peace be to them! were children of F&acirc;&#7789;imeh,&#8212;let peace be to her! by the Prince of the believers,&#8212;let peace be to him! although they were enveloped where the intestines are seated in man, and came out from that which is not the place of coming out for children, and our Master Ab&ucirc; &#8217;Abdallah El-&#7716;asan,&#8212;let peace be to him! came out from the right side, independently of any of the states of women, and without any occasion of disgust at F&acirc;&#7789;imeh,&#8212;let peace be to her! But the primary &#7716;asan and &#7716;usein,&#8212;let peace be to them! came to be, as children of the Meshiyeh, while these were earthly impersonations.

And the Amr is clear of all things since its Relatives, the Correspondents of the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly, who manifest its sovereignty, namely, Mu&#7717;ammed and &#8217;Aly,&#8212;let the divine benediction be to them! are 'honored servants,' created to be kings by that which is not resembled in the Similitudes and Stations which I have given to them. And every thing which thou seest is by the operation of the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly; and the creation of them is by the operation of the Amr."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon I said, "O my Master, did I not say to thee that thou shouldst disclose to me the verity of that which is of the Amr to them?"<A NAME="page_179_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_179_note_dagger">&#8224;</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El-B&acirc;&#7731;ir,&#8212;let peace be to him! said, "Know thou that the Amr of the Creator,&#8212;let it be magnified and glorified! willed that there should be a world, and heavens and an earth, and days and nights, and seas and mountains, and Jinns and angels, and trees and waters, and the like.

to all that which it willed, the Amr exposed it to all things, namely, all good, and evil, and trial, whatever; it said, 'Be thou patient,' and it was patient. Afterwards, it commanded it to obey, and so it obeyed with an obedience without any disobedience. Whereupon, it delivered up to it, and so that Light became an originating act, neither creating nor created, not a thing, which is the S&acirc;bi&#7731;. And there was made to subsist therein, and aided it with the Holy Spirit, an Ultimate Producer, possessed of power, and activity, and a spirit of its own, which is the T&acirc;ly; and as for this, thou findest it in the &#7730;ur&acirc;n, since it says, 'Remember my favor towards thee and towards her who bore thee, when I aided thee with the Holy Spirit, that thou mightest talk with man in the cradle,'<A NAME="page_180_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_180_note_*">*</A>&#8212;where 'the Holy Spirit' is Mu&#7717;ammed,&#8212;let the divine benediction be to him and to his Family! who is the Measure of the S&acirc;bi&#7731;, and its Correspondent in the corporeal world; and the 'talking' which it mentions is the talking of the Measure of the T&acirc;ly, which is the Prince of the believers,&#8212;let peace from him be to us! and its Correspondent in the corporeal world. And thus is the aiding transmitted from one to another, until it reaches the &#7730;&acirc;im, the seventh N&acirc;&#7789;i&#7731;,&#8212;let his peace be to us! and so all the aiding is concentrated in him; and the Lights branch out, Light after Light, to Im&acirc;m after Im&acirc;m, one inheriting from another the Light, the Light of God, which he made to enter into the two Eternal Roots.

all things to these two Primaries, that is the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly, in which the Creator,&#8212;let its memory be exalted! deposited, by its command, something of that which is spiritual and corporeal, and which it constituted the Correspondent of its corporeity, so that they were such as thou hast heard them to be, as created out of the very Light. And their Lights branched out into three lights; namely, El-Jedd, and El-Fat&#7717;, and El-Khiy&acirc;l; and their Likenesses in respect to that which is corporeal are Ez-Zuhra,<A NAME="page_185_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_185_note_*">*</A> El-&#7716;asan, and El-&#7716;usein.

And the Lights which branched out enter into the two words, the saying of the &#7730;ur&acirc;n, <I>Kun</I>, two letters, <I>fatekun</I>, five, which are expanded from the two letters; for Light had its origin in the Creator,&#8212;let it be magnified and glorified! because it came to be by a volition on the part of the Amr, and so they were created."<A NAME="page_185_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_185_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A></P>

The former gives transit, the latter weighs. So then, 'As for him whose balances are heavy, he will lead a pleasant life,'&#8212;meaning, on account of the knowledge of the T&acirc;ly,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Afterwards, the Amr of the Creator,&#8212;let its memory be glorified! said, 'I reinforce you two with my Lights; do ye, therefore, with them that which ye will;' and so it is said, 'who act by his Amr.' And it kept itself clear of reckoning with the nations, and of their defilements, saying, 'Obedience to me is difficult; I lay it upon you alone, because ye are of my very Light, the Most High. So then, be ye charged, ye, with obedience to me, which is due to me from you; and do ye charge, ye, the nations with obedience to you; and to trace to the Cause is the pith of knowledge of you, so that whoever knows you, will know me, and whoever obeys you, will obey me. This is my covenant; accept it, therefore, as conditioned; and whoever, then, yields to you, yields to me, and whoever disobeys you, disobeys me; my being pleased is your being pleased, and my being indignant is your being indignant.'"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then they two became created out of the Light of the Amr,&#8212;meaning the caused and the Cause;<A NAME="page_186_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_186_note_dagger">&#8224;</A>&#8212;and they produced the Lights, and so became Creators."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And there are set in the heavens seven Lights which are the Higher Letters,&#8212;let their peace be to us! and in the earths seven Lights,&#8212;let their peace be to us! the seven Im&acirc;ms being subordinate to the seven N&acirc;&#7789;i&#7731;s. And in respect to all of the seven Im&acirc;ms, who are the Pillars of the earth and its Corner-Stones, transmitted in the periods and the revolutions, there is no exception to their having Similitudes to themselves in the heavens, and Likenesses.

And in like manner, the twelve Stars are the Likenesses of their &#7716;ujjehs; and, accordingly, they must of necessity have, in the earths, &#7716;ujjehs, who accept the covenant with him who is above the inhabitants of the heavens, and the covenant with him who is in the heavens, which is the covenant accepted in favor of the Chief of the earth, in the earth."<A NAME="page_187_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_187_note_dagger">&#8224;</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "O Kh&acirc;lid, the 'Prepared One' is the Place of the Measure of the S&acirc;bi&#7731;, that is, the Station of the N&acirc;&#7789;i&#7731;; and the 'Observer' is the Measure of the T&acirc;ly, that is, the Station of the As&acirc;s.

it says, 'But after thou didst take me to thyself, thou wast, thou, the Observer of them,'<A NAME="page_188_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_188_note_*">*</A>&#8212;meaning, after the law was finished, I was discharged,&#8212;meaning, after I was refined as to my corporeal impersonation, to the degree of the spiritual world, thou wast, thou, the Im&acirc;m after me, and the Legatee? But know thou" . . . {here follow five lines of ellipsis} . . . "he is a polytheist; and whoever worships the Ma&#8217;na<A NAME="page_188_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_188_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> in its verity, has hit the mark. And know thou, O Kh&acirc;lid, that the meaning of that is, that whoever worships the Ism, is an unbeliever; and the Ism is that with which the S&acirc;bi&#7731; is named, so that one is certainly an unbeliever, inasmuch as he worships that on the ground of its being the Creator,&#8212;meaning the S&acirc;bi&#7731;. And whoever worships the Ism and the Ma&#8217;na,<A NAME="page_188_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_188_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A>&#8212;meaning the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly,&#8212;is a polytheist. But whoever knows that the Amr of the Creator,&#8212;let it be exalted! made these two Roots, he believes in its unity, and worships it. So then, glory be to that which hath indeed performed the work of creation, and hath done well its creating, which is the Creator,&#8212;let it be exalted! beside which there is no Lord!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And be it known, that, as for these two Roots, they are a Light from that Light, not a Light like to that Light; for each of these two Lights comes forth, and is manifested. Acknowledge thou that, then, O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid. And know thou, that, if men had acknowleged their Creator, and the Mediators of their Creator, they certainly would not have been wicked, and would have never come into the Fire of Jehennam."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Kh&acirc;lid, beware lest thou sayest concerning me that which I say not, and tellest from me that which I do not

tell. Dost thou do so, I shall call thee to account for it on the day of resurrection, and shall be quit of thee, and thou wilt be quit of me. We are 'servants in honor' to God, and purified by God, and made to be of the Light of God. We serve God with the reality of serving him; and if ye had served him with any thing of our service of him, or had been charged, in order to something of that, with the weight of an atom thereof, it certainly would have proved too much for you; and if there had been put upon the mountains, and the heavens and the earths, the weight of an atom of that to which we are obligated, of obedience and service, they certainly would not have borne it, and would have sunk and disappeared, on account of the burthen of that service. So then we are charged in your stead; and we serve him with the reality of serving him, and acknowledge him with the reality of knowledge of him, while there is not that obligatory upon you, thereof, which is obligatory upon us. But as for you, it is incumbent upon you, that ye should acknowledge us, and not deny us, and that ye should obey us, and not disobey us; and whoever acknowledges us with the reality of knowledge of us, and knowledge of our service, knows that from us things come forth, and to us they will return. We are the Subject Lords, and the Hidden Creatures. When thou wouldst us, O Kh&acirc;lid, seek us, with thine inmost soul, in the invisible realm, and thou wilt find us above that which is above; there is not above us any superior other than the Amr of the Creator,&#8212;let it be exalted! and the S&acirc;bi&#7731; and the T&acirc;ly,<A NAME="page_189_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_189_note_*">*</A>&#8212;a truth respecting which it is due to no one of those created out of clay, that a word should be uttered; and how shall that be apprehended by such as pass away, and are gone, and die? wherefore yield ye to our dictum, and acknowledge ye it. This, then, O K&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, is the end of seeking, therefore be thou a seeker; we, then, are the final end of the devotee, therefore be thou a devotee. And beware lest thou goest astray, or slidest; verily, Shei&#7789;&acirc;n is thine enemy, so be thou wary of him."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says he, [the author,] Thereupon I said, "O my Chief, thou hast said to me, that if any one reaches to the Measure of the Word, there is no measure beyond that, nor the like

of that; and that whoever acknowledges the Tree, attains with certainty, to whatever degree he wills. What, then, is this 'Word'? and what, this 'Tree'?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said our Master El-B&acirc;&#7731;ir,&#8212;let the benedictions of God be to him! "As for the 'Word,' it is Mu&#7717;ammed; and as for the 'Tree,' it is the Prince of the believers &#8217;Aly,&#8212;let peace from them both be to us! Hearest thou not God, who says in the &#7730;ur&acirc;n, 'And it is the parable of a good Word like a good Tree, of which the root is fast, and the top is in heaven'?<A NAME="page_190_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_190_note_*">*</A>&#8212;wherein the root of the Word and its top are made two limits, the root being the S&acirc;bi&#7731;, and the top, the T&acirc;ly, which is the Measure of Mu&#7717;ammed,&#8212;let the divine benediction be to him! And the 'Tree' is the Prince of the believers &#8217;Aly,&#8212;let his peace be to us and to all believers! inasmuch as they two are the two tops belonging to the two Roots, which constitute the As&acirc;s of the corporeal world. He,&#8212;let his name be magnified! adds, 'which bears its fruit every season, with the permission of its Lord,'&#8212;meaning the Im&acirc;ms whom he [the Prince of the believers] generates."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, he said to me, "O Kh&acirc;lid, dost thou keep in mind? dost thou hearken?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I replied, "Yes, O my Master,&#8212;my life for thee!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon he said, "O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, if thou wouldst acquire our sciences, acquire them from the Mines?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this I said, "And what are 'the Mines'?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied, "Those Im&acirc;ms,"&#8212;let their peace be to us! "whom God causes to inherit the prophetic gift."<A NAME="page_190_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_190_note_dagger">&#8224;</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said I, "What if I meet with no Im&acirc;m?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied, "Thou shalt take, on the authority of the reliable &#8217;Ulemas, that which they take on the authority of the Orthodox Im&acirc;ms,"&#8212;let their peace be to us and to all believers! "or else thou shalt draw from a known book, to which the &#7730;ur&acirc;n testifies, and which tradition authenticates, and the intellect approves, and from other books.<A NAME="page_190_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_190_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A> But beware thou, and again beware.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, this is my instruction to thee; so then receive thou it. And it is the mystery of the Almighty God, the 'flesh' and the 'blood' of which the Mes&icirc;&#7717;,&#8212;let peace be to him! said to his disciples, 'This is my flesh and my blood; so then, eat ye, and drink ye.'<A NAME="page_191_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_191_note_*">*</A> And I have indeed opened to thee the pasture, and have given thee to eat, and given thee to drink, and have drawn water for thee; so then, eat thou with good digestion, and drink thou to thine health; and behave thou uprightly towards thy brethren, the believers. And sufficient for thee is that which I say. And let peace be to those who follow direction! And this is enough for men, and it is that they may be warned by it, and may know that he is one God, and that the possessors of hearts may consider'."<A NAME="page_191_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_191_note_dagger">&#8224;</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says Kh&acirc;lid Ibn Zeid, There is, therefore, not, by God, not any deity except God. After this instruction, no vacillation is in my heart respecting God, nor does there lurk in my inmost soul any doubt. And I neither deny him, nor avow him, to any one except those in whom I confide as respects friendship to the Prince of the believers &#8217;Aly,&#8212;let peace from him be to us!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And already, indeed, have many people been directed by this Missive, of those who had deviated from the path of orthodoxy, while I have not ceased to rehearse the instruction of our Master El-B&acirc;&#7731;ir,&#8212;let his peace be to us! and to present it to the hearts of his friends. Now then, whoever comes forward, will be delivered; and whoever remains behind, will wander in the Fire, and be precipitated into El-H&acirc;wiyeh. And this is that which I hear and see. And God is sufficient for me! And well is he the Guardian!</P>

And as often as an Im&acirc;m disappears, an Im&acirc;m takes his stand; nor is one different from the other, except in respect to his manifestation in bodily form; so that the earth is not without him the twinkling of an eye, and it happens not to him to disappear except at the time of his manifestation, and the transmission from one form to another.
