<h5 align="center">THE UNDER-MEANING A REFLEXION OF A CERTAIN REASON </h5>

<p>XX. I. These are approximately the chief headings of their myth, after the most ill-omened have been removed,&#8212;such as, for instance, the one about the cutting up into pieces of Horus, and the beheading of Isis. </p>

<p>2. That, however, if people suppose and say these things about that Blessed and Incorruptible Nature according to which especially the Divine conceives itself, as though they were actually enacted and really took place, &#8220;thou shouldst spit out and cleanse mouth,&#8221; according to &AElig;schylus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_988"></A><A HREF="#fn_989"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> there is no need to tell thee;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_989"></A><A HREF="#fn_990"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> for of thyself thou showest displeasure at those who hold illegitimate and barbarous notions about the Gods. </p>

<p>4. And just as the Mathematici&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_990"></A><A HREF="#fn_991"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> say that &#8220;Iris&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_991"></A><A HREF="#fn_992"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is the sun&#146;s reflexion many-coloured by the return of its visual impression to the cloud, so the myth down here is a reflexion of a certain reason (<i>logos</i>) that bends its thinking back on other things; as both the sacred offerings suggest by the reflected element of mournfulness and sadness they contain, and also the dispositions of the temples which in one direction open out into side-walks and courts for moving about in, open to the sky and clear of objects, while in the other they have hidden and dark robing-rooms under ground, like places for putting coffins in and burying-spots. </p>
