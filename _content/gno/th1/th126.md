##### CONCERNING THE TOMBS OF OSIRIS

5\. And not least of all does the belief of the Osirians—since the body
\[of Osiris\] is said to be in many places—\[suggest this\].

6\. For they say that both Diochitē is called Polichnē, <span
id="fr_992"></span>[3](#fn_993) because it alone has the true one; and
\[also\] that it is at Abydos that the wealthy and powerful of the
Egyptians are mostly buried,—their ambition being to have a common place
of burial with the body of Osiris; and \[again\] that it is at Memphis
that the Apis is

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

reared as the image of the soul of Osiris, because it is *there* also
that his body lies.

7\. And as for the City, <span id="fr_993"></span>[1](#fn_994) some
interpret it as “Harbour of Good Things,” but others give it the special
meaning of “Tomb of Osiris”; it is, however, the little island one <span
id="fr_994"></span>[2](#fn_995) at Philæ \[they say\] which is in other
respects inaccessible and inapproachable by all, and that not even the
birds light on it or fish come near it, but at a certain season the
priests cross over \[to it\] and make offerings to the dead, and place
wreaths on the monument which is overshadowed by a . . . <span
id="fr_995"></span>[3](#fn_996) tree, which is greater in size than any
olive.

XXI\. 1. Eudoxus, however, \[says\] that, though many tombs are spoken
of in Egypt, the body lies at Būsiris, for that this had been the native
city of Osiris; nevertheless Taphosiris requires no further reason \[to
establish its claim\], for the name explains itself—namely, “Burying of
Osiris.”

“But I rede of cutting of wood, of rending of linen, and pouring of
pourings, because many of the mystery-\[meanings\] have been mixed up
with them.” <span id="fr_996"></span>[4](#fn_997)

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

2\. But the priests say that not only of these Gods, but also of all the
other gods also who are not ingenerable and indestructible, the bodies
lie buried with them when they <span id="fr_997"></span>[1](#fn_998)
have done their work, and have service rendered them, while their souls
shine in heaven as

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

stars; and that \[of the former\] the \[soul\] of Isis is called Dog by
the Greeks, but Sōthis by the Egyptians, while the \[soul\] of Horus
\[is called\] Ōriōn, <span id="fr_998"></span>[1](#fn_999) and Typhon’s
Bear. <span id="fr_999"></span>[2](#fn_1000)

3\. And \[they say\] that for the burials of the animals to whom honour
is paid, the rest \[of the Egyptians\] pay the \[dues which are\]
mutually determined; but that those alone who inhabit the Thebaid give
nothing, since they believe that no God is subject to death, and that he
whom they themselves call Knēph is ingenerable and immortal.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_993"></span>[292:3](th126.htm#fr_992) Either the reading is
at fault, or some word-play is intended. Dio-chitē is probably
Zeus-something; but I cannot resolve it. While Polichnē is a rare
diminutive of πόλις, and would thus mean “Little City.”

<span id="fn_994"></span>[293:1](th126.htm#fr_993) ? Memphis; or,
perhaps, as contrasted with the Little City above.

<span id="fn_995"></span>[293:2](th126.htm#fr_994) *Sc.* city;
νιστιτάνην is a hopeless reading, and as the editors can make nothing
out of it, I suggest νησίτιδα or νησιδάνην (πόλιν).

<span id="fn_996"></span>[293:3](th126.htm#fr_995) μηθίδης—apparently an
error; Bernardakis suggests μίνθης (Lat. *mentha*) “mint.” Can the right
reading be μηδικῆς (πόας)? The *herba medica,* was, however, the
sainfoin or lucerne, which, though reminding us of the melilote of xiv.,
is hardly capable of overshadowing a tomb even in the most intricate
symbolical sense.

<span id="fn_997"></span>[293:4](th126.htm#fr_996) Evidently a verbal
quotation from Eudoxus. The “cutting of wood” presumably refers to the
trunk with lopped branches, which, as we have already mentioned, occurs
so frequently on so-called “Gnostic” gems; the “rending of linen”
(λίνου) might also be made to refer to Linus, the Bard, and his being
torn to pieces like Osiris; *Linos* also means the “Song of Linus,” so
called, it is supposed by some, because in earliest times the strings of
the cithara were made of flax. For other names of singers used for lays
or modes of song, compare Manerōs and Pæan; though, of course, the
modern way is to regard the singer as the personification of the lay.
Thus in Emil Naumann’s *History of Music* (trans, by F. Praeger; London,
1882), p. 3, we read: “The Greek tribes of Peloponnesus and Hellas, as
well as the Egyptians, Phœnicians, the Greeks inhabiting the isles of
the Ægean Sea, and especially those of Cyprus, had a primitive ‘Lament’
which seems to have come originally from Phœnicia. It was a funeral
chant on the death of the youthful Adonis. . . . The Egyptians changed
its signification into a lament of Isis for Osiris. The Greeks called it
*Linos,* and the Egyptians *Maneros.*” The beginning of the “Manerōs,”
or the Lament of Isis for her Beloved, is given as follows by Naumann
(p. 40):

> “Return, oh, return!  
> God Panu, return!  
> Those that were enemies are no more here.  
> Oh lovely helper, return,  
> That thou may’st see me, thy sister,  
> Who loves thee.  
> And com’st thou not near me?  
> O beautiful youth, return, oh, return!  
> When I see thee not  
> My heart sorrows for thee,  
> My eyes ever seek thee,  
> I roam about for thee, to see thee in the form of the Nai,  
> To see thee, to see thee, thou beautiful lov’d one.  
> Let me the Radiant, see thee  
> God Panu, All-Glory, see thee again!  
> To thy belovèd come, blessed Onnòfris,  
> Come to thy sister, come to thy wife,  
> God Urtuhet, oh, come!  
> Come to thy consort!”

Unfortunately, Naumann does not give any references by which we can
control his statements.

<span id="fn_998"></span>[294:1](th126.htm#fr_997) The bodies;
presumably referring to the mummies of those men and women who were
believed to have reached the god-stage while living.

<span id="fn_999"></span>[295:1](th126.htm#fr_998) *Cf.* xxii. 3.

<span id="fn_1000"></span>[295:2](th126.htm#fr_999) Probably all
name-plays: κύων (dog), √κυ (conceive)—see lxi. 6; H-ōr-os, Ōr-iōn;
ἄρκ-τος (bear), √αρκ (suffice, endure, bear); Ursa Major is called the
Wain.
