<p>2. They say that when Rhea&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> secretly united with Kronos, Helios on sensing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> it imprecated her not to bring forth in month or year.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> </p>

<p>3. That Hermes being in love with the Goddess, came to conjunction [with her]; then playing draughts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> against Selene,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and winning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> the seventieth of each </p>

<p>of the lights, he con-duced from all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> five days and in-duced them into the three hundred and sixty [days]&#8212;which Egyptians call the &#8220;now in-duced,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and keep as birthdays of the Gods.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> </p>

<p>4. [And they say] that on the first Osiris was born, and that a voice fell out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> together with him on his being brought forth&#8212;to wit: &#8220;The Lord of all forth comes to light.&#8221; </p>

<p>5. But some say that a certain Pamyl&#275;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> being moistened&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> from the holy [place] of Zeus, heard a voice directing her to proclaim with outcry that &#8220;Great King Good-doing Osiris is born&#8221;; and that because of this she nursed Osiris, Kronos entrusting him to her, and they keep with mystic rites the Pamylia in his honour, similar to the Phallephoria.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> </p>

<p>6. And on the second [they say] Arou&#275;ris [was born]&#8212;whom they call Apollo, and some call Elder Horus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> </p>

<p>On the third that Typhon, neither in season nor in place, but breaking through with a blow, leapt forth through her side.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> </p>

<p>On the fourth that Isis was born in all moist [conditions]. </p>

<p>On the fifth Nephthys, whom they name End and Aphrodit&#275;, while some [call] her also Victory. </p>

<p>7. And [they say] that Osiris and Arou&#275;ris were from Helios, Isis from Hermes, and Typhon and Nephthys from Kronos, and therefore the kings considering the third&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the &#8220;induced&#8221; [days] nefast, used neither to consult nor serve themselves till night.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> </p>

<p>8. And [they say] that Nephthys was married to Typhon;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> but Isis and Osiris being in love with each other, united even before they were born, down in the Womb beneath the Darkness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_906"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> </p>

<p>9. Some, moreover, say that Arou&#275;ris thus came to birth, and that he is called Elder Horus by Egyptians, but Apollo by Greeks. </p>

<p>XIII. 1. And [they say] that when Osiris was king, he straightway set free the Egyptians from a life from which they could find no way out and like unto that of wild beasts,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_907"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> both setting fruits before them, and laying down laws, and teaching them to honour the Gods. </p>

<p>2. And that subsequently he went over the whole earth, clearing it,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="#fn_908"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> not in the least requiring arms, but drawing the multitude to himself by charming them with persuasion and reason (<i>logos</i>),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="#fn_909"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> with song and every art the Muses give;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_909"></A><A HREF="#fn_910"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> and that for this </p>

<p>cause he seems to the Greeks to be the same as Dionysus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_910"></A><A HREF="#fn_911"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> </p>

<p>3. And [they say] that while he was away, Typhon attempted no revolution, owing to Isis keeping very careful guard, and having the power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_911"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in her hands, holding it fast; but that when he [Osiris] came back, he made with art a wile for him, con-juring seventy-two men, and having as co-worker a queen coming out of &AElig;thiopia, whom they call As&#333;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_912"></A><A HREF="#fn_913"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> </p>

<p>4. But that after measuring out for himself in secret the body of Osiris,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_913"></A><A HREF="#fn_914"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and having devised, according to the size,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_914"></A><A HREF="#fn_915"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> a beautiful and extraordinarily ornamented chest,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_915"></A><A HREF="#fn_916"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> brought it into the banqueting hall.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_917"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> </p>

<p>5. And that when they were delighted at the sight and wondered, Typhon, in sport, promised to give the chest to him who could make himself exactly equal to it by laying himself down in it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_917"></A><A HREF="#fn_918"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> </p>

<p>6. And that when all were trying, one after another, since no one fitted, Osiris stepped in and laid himself down. </p>

<p>7. And they who were present running up, dashed on the lid, and, after some [of them] had closed it down with fastenings, and others had poured hot lead over it, they carried it out to the River,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_918"></A><A HREF="#fn_919"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and let it go into the Sea by way of the Tanitic&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_919"></A><A HREF="#fn_920"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> mouth, which [they say] Egyptians call even to this day by a hateful and abominable name. </p>

<p>8. These things they say were done on the seventeenth of the month Athur,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_920"></A><A HREF="#fn_921"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in which [month] the Sun passes through the Scorpion; it being the eight-and-twentieth year of Osiris&#146; reign. </p>

<p>9. Some, however, say that he had lived and not reigned so long.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_921"></A><A HREF="#fn_922"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> </p>

<p>XIV. 1. And as the Pans and Satyrs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_922"></A><A HREF="#fn_923"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> that inhabit round Chemmis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_923"></A><A HREF="#fn_924"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> were the first to sense the </p>

<p>passion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_924"></A><A HREF="#fn_925"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> [of Osiris], and give tongue concerning what was being done, [they say] that on this account sudden disturbances and emotions of crowds are even unto this day called &#8220;panics.&#8221; </p>

<p>2. But when Isis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_925"></A><A HREF="#fn_926"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> sensed it, she cut off one of her curls, and put on a mourning dress, whence the city to this day bears the name Kopt&#333;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_926"></A><A HREF="#fn_927"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> </p>

<p>But others think the name signifies privation,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_927"></A><A HREF="#fn_928"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> for they say that <i>koptein</i> is to de-prive. </p>

<p>3. And [they say] that she, wandering about in every direction, and finding no way out, never approached any one without accosting him; nay, she asked even little children whom she happened to meet, about the chest. </p>

<p>4. And they happened to have seen, and showed the mouth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_929"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> through which the friends of Typhon let the vessel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> go into the Sea. </p>

<p>5. Because of this [they say] Egyptians believe that little children have prophetic power, and they especially divine from the sounds of their voices, when playing in the holy places and shouting about anything. </p>

<p>6.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_931"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> And [they say] that when [Isis] was aware that </p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Osiris in ignorance had fallen in love and united himself with her sister&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_932"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as with herself, and seeing as proof the honey-clover&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="#fn_933"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> wreath which he had left behind with Nephthys, she sought for the babe&#8212;(for she [N.] exposed it immediately she bore it, through fear of Typhon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="#fn_934"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>). </p>

<p>7. And after it was found with toil and trouble&#8212;dogs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_934"></A><A HREF="#fn_935"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> guiding Isis to it it&#8212;was reared and became her guard and follower, being called Anubis, and is said to guard the Gods, as <i>their</i> dogs men. </p>

<p>XV. 1. It was from him she got intelligence about the chest:&#8212;that after it had been wave-tossed out by the Sea to the Byblos&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_935"></A><A HREF="#fn_936"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> country, the land-wash had gently brought it to rest in a certain heather-bush.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_936"></A><A HREF="#fn_937"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> </p>

<p>2. And the heather-bush, in a short time running up into a most beautiful and very large young tree, enfolded, and grew round it,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_937"></A><A HREF="#fn_938"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and hid it entirely within itself. </p>

<p>3. And the King,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_938"></A><A HREF="#fn_939"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> marvelling at the greatness of the </p>

<p>tree, after cutting off the branches, and rounding off the trunk that surrounded the coffin without its being seen,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_939"></A><A HREF="#fn_940"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> set it up as the prop of his roof. </p>

<p>4. And they say that on her hearing of these things by the daimonian spirit of a voice,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_940"></A><A HREF="#fn_941"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Isis came to Byblos, and, sitting down at a fountain-head, downcast and weeping, held converse with no one else, but she embraced and showed affection to the maids of the Queen, curling&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_941"></A><A HREF="#fn_942"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> their hair and exhaling from herself on their skin a marvellous fragrance. </p>

<p>5. And when the Queen saw her maids, longing for the ambrosia-smelling hair and skin of the stranger came upon her. </p>

<p>And so when she had been sent for and had become an inmate [of the palace, the Queen] made her nurse of her little one. </p>

<p>6. And the name of the King, they say, was Malkander,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_942"></A><A HREF="#fn_943"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> while her name according to some was Astarte, according to others Sa&#333;sis, and according to others Nemanous,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_943"></A><A HREF="#fn_944"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>&#8212;or whatever is the name for which the Greek equivalent would be Athena&iuml;s.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_944"></A><A HREF="#fn_945"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> </p>

<p>XVI. 1. And [they say] that instead of giving it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_945"></A><A HREF="#fn_946"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the breast, Isis reared the little one by putting her finger&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_946"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> into its mouth, and that at night she burnt round&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_947"></A><A HREF="#fn_948"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the mortal [elements] of its body, and, turning herself into a swallow, flew round the pillar and twittered a dirge; until the Queen, through spying [on her] and crying out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_948"></A><A HREF="#fn_949"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> when she saw the babe being burnt round, deprived it of its immortality.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_949"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> </p>

<p>2. That when the Goddess revealed herself, she claimed for herself the pillar of the roof; and, taking it down with the greatest care, she cut away the heather-tree from round it, then wrapping this&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_950"></A><A HREF="#fn_951"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> up in fine linen, and pouring the juices of sweet herbs over it,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_951"></A><A HREF="#fn_952"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> she placed it in the hands of the royal couple; and even unto this day the people of Byblos venerate the wood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_952"></A><A HREF="#fn_953"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> lying in the holy place of Isis. </p>

<p>3. As for the coffin, she flung herself round it, and kept moaning so long, that the younger of the little ones of the king died away;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_953"></A><A HREF="#fn_954"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and, taking the elder with herself, and placing the coffin on a boat, she sailed away. </p>

<p>4. And when the River Ph&aelig;drus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_954"></A><A HREF="#fn_955"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> raised too rough a wind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_955"></A><A HREF="#fn_956"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> just after dawn,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_956"></A><A HREF="#fn_957"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> waxing wrath, she dried up his stream. </p>

<p>XVII. 1. And [they say] that when first she found solitude and was by herself, she opened the chest, and laying her face on his face, she kissed [him] and shed tears. </p>

<p>2. And that when the little one came up in silence from behind and understood, on sensing it she turned herself about, and passionately gave him an awe-ful look. And the little one could not hold himself up against the awe of her, and died. </p>

<p>3. But some say [it was] not thus, but, as it has been said before,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_957"></A><A HREF="#fn_958"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> that he fell out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_958"></A><A HREF="#fn_959"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> into the river. </p>

<p>4. And he has honours owing to the Goddess, for the Maner&#333;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_959"></A><A HREF="#fn_960"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> whom Egyptians hymn at their symposia is he. </p>

<p>5. While others relate that the boy was called Pal&aelig;stinos&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_960"></A><A HREF="#fn_961"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> or Pelousios, and that the city&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_961"></A><A HREF="#fn_962"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> was named after him when it was founded by the Goddess; and that the Maner&#333;s who is hymned was the first to discover the art of the Muses.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_962"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>

<p>6. But some say that it is the name of no one, but a manner of speech for men drinking and feasting,&#8212;with the meaning &#8220;May such and such things be present in becoming measure!&#8221; For the Egyptians on every such occasion shout out this, it being indicated to them by &#8220;Maner&#333;s.&#8221; </p>

<p>7. Just as, doubtless, also their being shown the image of a dead man carried round in a small wooden coffin, is not a reminder of the Osirian passion, as some suppose; but it is in order to exhort them while filled with wine to make use of things present, in that all will very presently be such [as it], that they bring in an unpleasing after-revel. </p>

<p>XVIII. 1. And [they say] that when Isis had gone a journey to her son Horus, who was being reared at Boutos,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_963"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and had put away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_964"></A><A HREF="#fn_965"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the chest,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_965"></A><A HREF="#fn_966"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Typhon, taking his dogs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_966"></A><A HREF="#fn_967"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> out by night towards the moon, came upon it; and recognising the body, tore it into fourteen pieces, and scattered them abroad. </p>

<p>2. And Isis [they say] on learning this, searched for them in a papyrus skiff (<i>baris</i>) sailing away through the marshes;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_967"></A><A HREF="#fn_968"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> whence those who sail in papyrus hulls are not injured by the crocodiles, either because they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_968"></A><A HREF="#fn_969"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> fear or rather revere the Goddess.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_969"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> </p>

<p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_289"><font size="1" color="green">p. 289</font></A></p>

<p>3. And it is because of this [they say] that many tombs of Osiris are spoken of in Egypt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_970"></A><A HREF="#fn_971"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#8212;through her performing burial rites on meeting with each piece. </p>

<p>4. Some, however, say no; but that making herself images [of them] she distributed these to each city,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_971"></A><A HREF="#fn_972"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> as though she were giving it the [whole] body, in order that it might have honours from the multitude, and that even if Typhon should get the better of Horus, he might renounce his search for the true tomb when many were spoken of and pointed out. </p>

<p>5. Now, the only one of the parts of Osiris which Isis did not find was that which causes awe; for that it was cast straightway into the River, and the scaly-coat,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_972"></A><A HREF="#fn_973"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the devourer,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_973"></A><A HREF="#fn_974"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and the sharp-snout&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_975"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> ate it up&#8212;which [they say] among fishes are considered specially expiate;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_976"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and that Isis, making herself a counterfeit instead of it, consecrated the phallus; in honour of which the Egyptians keep festival even to this day.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_977"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> </p>

<p>the Invisible,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_977"></A><A HREF="#fn_978"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> worked through him and trained him for the fight. </p>

<p>2. He then put this test question to him: &#8220;What does he consider fairest?&#8221; And when he said: &#8220;Helping father and mother in ill plight,&#8221;&#8212;he asked a second: &#8220;What animal does he think most useful for those who go out to fight?&#8221; </p>

<p>3. And when Horus said &#8220;Horse,&#8221; he marvelled at him, and was quite puzzled why he did not say &#8220;Lion&#8221; rather than &#8220;Horse.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_978"></A><A HREF="#fn_979"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> </p>

<p>4. Accordingly Horus said: &#8220;&#145;Lion&#146; is a needful thing to one requiring help, but &#145;Horse&#146; [can] scatter in pieces the foe in flight and consume him utterly.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_979"></A><A HREF="#fn_980"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> </p>

<p>Thus hearing, Osiris rejoiced that Horus was fitly prepared. </p>

<p>5. And it is said that as many were changing over to the side of Horus, Th&#363;&#275;ris,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_980"></A><A HREF="#fn_981"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Typhon&#146;s concubine, came too; and that a certain serpent pursuing after her was cut in pieces by those round Horus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_981"></A><A HREF="#fn_982"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> And to-day on this account they cast down a small rope and cut it in pieces for all to see.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_982"></A><A HREF="#fn_983"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> </p>

<p>6. The fight lasted for many days, and Horus won. Nevertheless, when Isis received Typhon in bonds, she did not make away with him. Far from it; she unbound him and let him go. </p>

<p>7. Horus, however, did not bear this temperately; but, laying hands on his mother, he drew off the crown from her head. Whereupon Hermes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_983"></A><A HREF="#fn_984"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> crowned her with a head-dress of cow-horns. </p>

<p>8. And [they say] that also when Typhon got the chance of bringing a bastardy suit against Horus, and Hermes was counsel for the defence, Horus was judged legitimate by the Gods.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_984"></A><A HREF="#fn_985"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> </p>

<p>And that [afterwards] Typhon was fought under in two other fights. </p>

<p>9. And that Isis brought forth from her union with Osiris after his death&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_985"></A><A HREF="#fn_986"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Harpocrates&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_986"></A><A HREF="#fn_987"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>&#8212;who missed the month and was weak in his limbs from below upwards.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_987"></A><A HREF="#fn_988"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> </p>

<P><A NAME="fn_964"></A><A HREF="th124.htm#fr_963">288:1</A> Generally supposed to stand for the city But&#333;, but may be some word-play. Can it be connected with Bo&#333;tes, the Ploughman&#8212;the constellation Arcturus&#8212;the voyage being celestial; that is, a movement of the world-soul or change of state in the individual soul?

<P><A NAME="fn_970"></A><A HREF="th124.htm#fr_969">288:7</A> It is remarkable how that every now and then Plutarch inserts apparently the most na&iuml;ve superstitions without a word of explanation. They cannot be all simply irresponsible <i>on dits</i>. It is, perhaps, not without significance that the &#8220;chest&#8221; is first of all drifted to the Papyrus country, and that the <i>baris</i> of Isis should be made of papyrus. It seems almost as if it symbolised some &#8220;vehicle&#8221; that was safe from the &#8220;crocodile&#8221; of the deep. In other words, the skiffs are not paper boats and the crocodiles not alligators.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_977"></A><A HREF="th124.htm#fr_976">289:7</A> What these &#8220;fourteen parts&#8221; of Osiris may be is beyond the sphere of dogmatism. I would suggest that there may be along one line some connection with those seeds of life which have lately been called &#8220;permanent atoms&#8221;; and along another line, that of the birth of the Christ-consciousness, there may be a series of powers derived from past incarnations.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_980"></A><A HREF="th124.htm#fr_979">290:3</A> The white &#8220;Horse&#8221; was presumably opposed to the red &#8220;Ass&#8221; of Typhon, as the purified vehicle of the soul contrasted with the impure. &#8220;Lion&#8221; was one of the grades in the Mithriac Mysteries; it was a sun-animal.</P>
