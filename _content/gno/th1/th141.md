##### CONCERNING THE SACRED ROBES

LXXVII\. 1. Now as to robes: those of Isis \[are\] variegated in their
dyes, for her power \[is\] connected with matters producing all things
and receiving \[all\]—light darkness, day night, fire water, life death,
beginning end; while the \[robe\] of Osiris has neither shade nor
variegation, but one single \[property\]—the light-like, <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[4](#fn_1255) for the Source is pure and the First
and Intelligible unmixed.

2\. Wherefore when they have once and once only received this
\[robe\], <span id="fr_1255"></span>[5](#fn_1256) they treasure it away
and keep it from all eyes and hands; whereas they use those of Isis on
many occasions.

3\. For it is by use that the things which are sensible and ready to
hand, present many unfoldings and views of themselves as they change now
one way now another;

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

whereas the intelligence of the Intelligible and Pure and Single,
shining through the soul, like lightning-flash, once and once only
perchance allows \[us\] to contact and behold \[It\].

4\. For which cause both Plato <span id="fr_1256"></span>[1](#fn_1257)
and Aristotle call this part of philosophy “epoptic,” <span
id="fr_1257"></span>[2](#fn_1258) from the fact that they who transcend
by the reason (*logos*) these mixed and multiform things of opinion, are
raised unto that Primal \[One\], Simple and Matter-less, and \[so\]
contacting in its singleness the pure truth concerning It, they think
philosophy has as it were \[its\] perfect end.

LXXVIII\. 1. The fact, moreover, which the present priests cautiously
hint at by expiatory sacrifices and covering their faces—\[namely\] that
this God is ruler and king of the dead, being no other than him who is
called Hades and Pluto among Greeks—in that they do not know how it is
true, confuses the multitude, who suppose that the truly sacred and holy
Osiris lives on earth and under earth, where the bodies of those who
seem to have \[reached their\] end are hidden \[away\].

2\. But He Himself is far, far from the earth, unspotted and unstained,
and pure of every essence that is susceptible of death and of decay. Nor
can the souls of men here \[on the earth\], swathed as they are with
bodies and enwrapped in passions, commune with God, except so far as
they can reach some dim sort of a dream \[of Him\], with the perception
of a mind trained in philosophy.

3\. But when \[their souls\] freed \[from these bonds\] pass to the
Formless and Invisible and Passionless and Pure, this God becomes their
guide and king, as though they hung on Him, and gazed insatiate upon His
Beauty,

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

and longed after it—\[Beauty\] that no man can declare or speak about.

4\. It is with this the ancient tale (*logos*) makes Isis e’er in love,
and, by pursuit \[of it\], and consort \[with it\], makes \[her\]
full-fill all things down here with all things fair and good, whatever
things have part in genesis.

5\. Thus, then, these things contain the reason (*logos*) that’s more
suitable to God.
