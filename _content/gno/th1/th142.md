##### CONCERNING INCENSE

LXXIX\. 1. And must I also speak of the daily incense-offerings, as I
promised, <span id="fr_1258"></span>[1](#fn_1259) the reader should
first of all have in mind the fact, that not only have men \[in
general\] always paid most serious attention to things that conduce to
health, but that especially in sacred ceremonies and purifications and
prescribed modes of life “healthy” is not less important than “holy”;
for they did not think it right to render service to the Pure and
perfectly Harmless and Unpolluted with either bodies or with souls
festering and diseased.

2\. Since, then, the air—of which we make most use, and with which we
have most to do—does not always keep the same disposition and blend, but
at night is condensed, and weighs down the body, and brings the soul
into a desponding and anxious state, as though it had become mist-like
and heavy; \[therefore\] as soon as they get up they incense with pine
resin, sanifying and purifying the air by its <span
id="fr_1259"></span>[2](#fn_1260) disintegration, and fanning up again
the \[fire of the\] spirit connate with body <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[3](#fn_1261)

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

which had died down,—since its perfume possesses a vehement and
penetrating \[force\].

3\. And, again, at mid-day, perceiving that the sun draws from the earth
by force an exceedingly large and heavy exhalation, and commingles it
with the air, they incense with myrrh. <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1](#fn_1262) For its heat dissolves and disperses
the turbid and mud-like combination in the atmosphere.

4\. And, indeed, physicians seem to relieve sufferers from plague by
making a great blaze, as though it cleared the air. But it clears it
better if they burn fragrant woods, such as \[those\] of cypress,
juniper, and pine.

5\. At any rate, they say that at Athens, at the time of the Great
Plague, Akrōn the physician became famous through ordering them to keep
fires burning by the side of the sick, for he \[thus\] benefitted not a
few.

6\. And Aristotle says that the sweet-smelling odours, given off by
perfumes and flowers and meadows, conduce no less to health than to
enjoyment; because by their warmth and softness they diffuse themselves
gently through the brain, which is naturally cold and as though
congested.

7\. And if, moreover, they call myrrh *bal* among Egyptians—and in
translation this comes pretty near to meaning the dispersion of silly
talk—this also affords some evidence for the reason why \[they use it\].

LXXX\. 1. And \[finally\] *kuphi* <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[2](#fn_1263) is a mixture composed of sixteen
ingredients:—of honey, and wine, and raisins, and cyperus; <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[3](#fn_1264) of pine-resin, and myrrh,

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

and aspalathus, <span id="fr_1264"></span>[1](#fn_1265) and
seseli; <span id="fr_1265"></span>[2](#fn_1266) and further of
mastich, <span id="fr_1266"></span>[3](#fn_1267) and bitumen, <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[4](#fn_1268) and nightshade, <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[5](#fn_1269) and sorrel; and in addition to these
of both junipers <span id="fr_1269"></span>[6](#fn_1270) (of which they
call the one the larger and the other the smaller), and cardamum, and
sweet-flag. <span id="fr_1270"></span>[7](#fn_1271)

2\. And these are not compounded in a haphazard way, but with the sacred
writings being read aloud <span id="fr_1271"></span>[8](#fn_1272) to the
perfume-makers when they mix them.

3\. And as to their number,—even though it has all the appearance of
square from square, and \[that too\] the only one of equally equal
numbers that has the power of making the perimeter equal to the
area, <span id="fr_1272"></span>[9](#fn_1273) it must be said that its
serviceableness for this purpose at least is of the slightest.

4\. But the majority of the ingredients, as they possess aromatic
properties, liberate a sweet breath and healthy exhalation, by which
both the air is changed, and the body being gently and softly moved by
the vapour, falls asleep <span id="fr_1273"></span>[10](#fn_1274) and
loosens the distressing strain of the day’s anxieties, as though they
were knots, \[and yet\] without any intoxication.

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

5\. Moreover, they polish up the image-making and receptive organ of
dreams like a mirror, and make it clearer, no less than the playing on
the lyre which the Pythagoreans used to use before sleep, thus charming
away and sanifying the passionate and reason-less nature of the soul.

6\. For things smelt call back the failing sense, and often, on the
other hand, dull and quiet it by \[their\] soothing \[effect\], when
their exhalations are diffused through the body; just as some of the
physicians say that sleep is induced when the vaporisation of the food,
as it were creeping gently round the inward parts and groping about,
produces a kind of tickling.

7\. And they use *kuphi* both as draught and mixture; for when it is
drunk it is thought to purge the intestines, \[but when applied
externally <span id="fr_1274"></span>[1](#fn_1275)\] to be an emollient.

8\. And apart from these \[considerations\], resin is a work of the sun;
and myrrh \[comes from\] the exudation of the trees under the sun-heat;
while of the ingredients of *kuphi,* some flourish more at night, like
all things whose nature it is to be nourished by cool breezes and shade
and dew and damp.

9\. Seeing that the light of day is one and single, and Pindar tells us
that the sun is seen “through empty æther”; <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[2](#fn_1276) while air is a blend and mixture of
many lights and properties, as it were of seeds dropped from every star
into one \[field\].

10\. Naturally, then, they use the former as incenses by day, as being
single and having their birth from the sun; and the latter when night
sets in, as being mixed and manifold in its qualities.
