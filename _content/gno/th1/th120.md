##### THE ONION AND PIG TABOOS

VIII\. 1. For nothing reasonless, or \[purely\] fabulous, or from
\[mere\] superstition, as some suppose, has been incorporated into the
foundation of the sacred operations, but some things have moral and
needful causes, while others are not without a share in the
embellishment of science and physics,—as, for instance, in the case of
the onion.

2\. \[The story\] that Diktys, <span id="fr_838"></span>[1](#fn_839) the
nursling of Isis, <span id="fr_839"></span>[2](#fn_840) fell into the
river and was drowned, in trying to catch the onions with his
hands, <span id="fr_840"></span>[3](#fn_841) \[is\] utterly incredible.

3\. The priests, however, keep themselves pure of the onion, and treat
it hardly, being \[ever\] on the watch against it, because it is the
only thing whose nature is to be well nourished and to flourish when the
moon’s a-wane.

It’s food <span id="fr_841"></span>[4](#fn_842) for neither fast nor
feast,—neither for the former in that it makes those feeding <span
id="fr_842"></span>[5](#fn_843) on it thirst, while for the latter it
makes them weep.

4\. And in like manner also they consider the sow an unholy animal,
because it seems to be covered especially when the moon is on the wane,
while the bodies of those who drink its milk burst forth <span
id="fr_843"></span>[6](#fn_844) into leprosy <span
id="fr_844"></span>[7](#fn_845) and scabrous roughnesses.

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

5\. And the tale (*logos*) they tell after once only <span
id="fr_845"></span>[1](#fn_846) sacrificing and eating pig at the
full-moon—\[namely\] that Typhon when pursuing pig towards full-moon
found the wooden coffin in which the body of Osiris lay dead, and
scattered it in pieces <span id="fr_846"></span>[2](#fn_847)—they do not
all receive, thinking it is a trifling mis-hearing \[of the true tale\]
like many more. <span id="fr_847"></span>[3](#fn_848)

6\. But they say their ancients so protected themselves against softness
\[of living\] and extravagance and agreeable sensations, that they said
a slab was set up in the holy place at Thebes with deprecations
in-lettered on it against Meinis <span id="fr_848"></span>[4](#fn_849)
the King, who first changed the Egyptians from the way of life without
riches and without needs and plain.

7\. Moreover, Technactis, father of Bocchoris, <span
id="fr_849"></span>[5](#fn_850) is said, when marching on the
Arabs, <span id="fr_850"></span>[6](#fn_851) when his baggage was
delayed, <span id="fr_851"></span>[7](#fn_852) to have used with joy the
food nearest at hand, and afterwards to have fallen into deep sleep on a
bed of straw, <span id="fr_852"></span>[8](#fn_853) and so embraced
frugality; and in

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

consequence of this \[he is said\] to have execrated the Meinian, and,
with the approval of the priests, to have graven his execration on
stone.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_839"></span>[271:1](th120.htm#fr_838) Diktys = the Netter.
In other myth-cycles Diktys was son of Poseidon, and is often called
simply the Fisher.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[271:2](th120.htm#fr_839) *Cf.* xvi., xvii.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[271:3](th120.htm#fr_840) ἐπιδρασσόμενον. The
Fisher-soul, therefore, presumably fell out of the celestial boat or
*baris* of Isis, and the myth may not be quite so ἀπίθανον as Plutarch
would have us think. *Cf.* xvii. 3. Ordinary onions do *not* grow in
rivers.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[271:4](th120.htm#fr_841) Or “fit”—πρόσφορον.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[271:5](th120.htm#fr_842) τοὺς προσφερομένους—a
word-play on “food.”

<span id="fn_844"></span>[271:6](th120.htm#fr_843) ἐξανθεῖ—lit.,
“flower.”

<span id="fn_845"></span>[271:7](th120.htm#fr_844) λεπρὰν—that which
makes the skin scaly and rough (λεπρὸς, as opposed to λεῖος, smooth);
there being also, I believe, a mystical under-meaning in it all.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[272:1](th120.htm#fr_845) Apparently once a
year.

<span id="fn_847"></span>[272:2](th120.htm#fr_846) *Cf.* xviii. 1.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[272:3](th120.htm#fr_847) This makes us doubt
whether there may not be a number of similar “mis-hearings” in the myth
as handed on by Plutarch.

<span id="fn_849"></span>[272:4](th120.htm#fr_848) Probably this should
be Μνεῦις (Mnevis), the sacred black bull, venerated as the symbol of
the *ka* of Rā, and so it may contain some mystical allusion. *Cf.*
xxxiii. 5.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[272:5](th120.htm#fr_849) τέχνακτις is,
perhaps, a word-play on τέχ (√τεκ, τίκτω), “creative” or “generative,”
and ἀκτίς, “ray”; while βοκχόρις may also be a play—such as, if one is
allowed to speculate wildly, βοῦς, “kine,” and χορός, “dance,”
reflecting the celestial βουκόλος or Cowherd.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[272:6](th120.htm#fr_850) It is to be noticed
that there was an Arab nome in Egypt, and that Egypt was mapped out into
a mystic body; and further, that the different surrounding nations were
regarded as representative each of certain powers.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[272:7](th120.htm#fr_851) Or it may mean “when
his filth delayed him,” and so contain a mystical implication.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[272:8](th120.htm#fr_852) ἐπὶ στιβάδος. It may
also mean “on the way.”
