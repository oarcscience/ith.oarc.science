<h3 align="center" align="center">VII</h3>
<h4 align="center">THE MYTH OF MAN IN THE MYSTERIES </h4>
<h5 align="center">THE GNOSTIC TRADITION </h5>

<p>&#8220;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">But</span> All-Father Mind, being Life and Light, did bring forth Man (&#7948;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957;) co-equal to Himself.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_300"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> </p>

<p>So runs the opening paragraph of what we may call the soteriological part of the &#8220;P&#339;mandres&#8221; treatise of our Trismegistic literature. This Man or Anthr&#333;pos is the Spiritual Prototype of humanity and of every individual man, and is a technical term found in a number of the early Christianised Gnostic systems. </p>

<p>For instance, in a system some outlines of which are preserved in the polemical <i>Refutation</i> of Iren&aelig;us,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_301"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and which the Bishop of Lyons seems to associate with an Ophite tradition, while Theodoret&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> ascribes it to the Sethians, we are told that in the Unutterable Depth were two Great Lights,&#8212;the First Man, or Father, and His Son, the Second Man; and also the Holy Spirit, the First Woman, or Mother of all living. </p>

<p>In this tradition, moreover, the Son of the Mother&#8212;the chief Formative Power of the seven Demiurgic Potencies of the sensible cosmos&#8212;is called Ialdaba&#333;th (? the Child of the Egg), who boasts himself to be </p>

<p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></A></p>

<p>supreme. But his mother, Wisdom, reproves his pride, saying unto him: &#8220;Lie not, Ialdaba&#333;th, for above thee is the Father of All, First Man, and Man Son of Man.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_303"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> </p>

<h5 align="center">THE &#8220;PHILOSOPHUMENA&#8221; OF HIPPOLYTUS </h5><p>But the main source of our information on this Anthr&#333;pos tradition, in its Christianised Gnostic form, is to be found in Hippolytus&#146; <i>Philosophumena; or, Refutation of all Heresies.</i> </p>

<p>In 1842, Mino&iuml;des Mynas, a learned Greek, sent on a literary mission by the French Government, discovered in one of the monasteries on Mount Athos the only MS. (generally ascribed to the fourteenth century) which we possess of this extremely valuable work. It was originally in ten books, but, unfortunately, the first three and the beginning of the fourth are missing from our MS. The first book, however, was already known, though previously erroneously ascribed to Origen, and was accordingly prefixed to the text of the <i>editio princeps</i> of our work by Emmanuel Miller (Oxford, 1851). </p>

<p>The missing Books II. and III. dealt respectively with the doctrines and mysteries of the Egyptians and with those of the Chald&aelig;ans. Hippolytus (Pro&#339;m.) boasts that he has divulged all their mysteries, as well as the secrets of those Christian mystics whom he stigmatises as heretics, and to whom he devotes Books V.-IX. </p>

<p>It is a curious fact that it is precisely those Books wherein this divulging of the Mysteries was attempted, which should be missing; not only have they disappeared, but in the Epitome at the beginning of Book X. the summary of their contents is also omitted. This seems almost to point to a deliberate removal of just </p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></A></p>

<p>that information which would be of priceless value to us to-day, not only for the general history of the evolution of religious ideas, but also for filling in an important part of the background of the environment of infant Christianity. </p>

<p>Why, then, were these books cut out? Were the subsequent Christian Orthodox deterred by religious scruples, or were they afraid to circulate this information? Hippolytus himself seems to have had no such hesitation; he is ever delightedly boasting that he is giving away to the multitude the most sacred secrets of others; it seems to have been his special <i>m&eacute;tier</i> to cry aloud on the house-tops what had been whispered in their secret chambers. It was for him a delicious triumph over &#8220;error&#8221; to boast, &#8220;I have your secret documents, and I am going to publish them!&#8221; </p>

<p>Why, then, should those who came after him hesitate? Surely they were like-minded with Hippolytus, and would have been as delighted as himself in humbling the pride of the hated Mystery-institutions in the dust? Can it possibly be that they saw far more clearly than he did that quite other deductions might be drawn from his &#8220;startling revelations&#8221;? </p>

<h5 align="center">THE NAASSENES </h5><p>That far other deductions could be drawn from the Mystery-rites and Mystery-myths was at anyrate the view of a tradition of early Jewish and Christian mystics whom Hippolytus calls Naassenes. The claim of these Gnostics was practically that Christianity, or rather the Good News of the Christ, was precisely the consummation of the inner doctrine of the Mystery-institutions of all the nations; the end of them all was the revelation of the Mystery of Man. </p>

<p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></A></p>

<p>It is further to be noticed that these Naassenes, &#8220;who call themselves Gnostics&#8221; (v. 2), are the very first school of Christian &#8220;heresy&#8221; with which Hippolytus deals; he puts them in the forefront of his <i>Refutation,</i> as being, presumably, in his opinion, the oldest, or, at anyrate, as representing the most ancient form of Christian &#8220;heresy.&#8221; </p>

<p>Although the name Naassene (&#925;&#945;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#951;&#957;&#959;&#943;) is derived from the Hebrew <i>Na&#7717;ash</i> (Serpent), Hippolytus does not call them Ophites; indeed, he reserves the latter name to a body to which he also gives (viii. 20) the name Ca&iuml;nites and Nocha&iuml;t&aelig; (&#925;&#959;&#967;&#945;&#970;&#964;&#945;&#943;)&#8212;? Nacha&iuml;t&aelig;, again, from <i>Nachash</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#8212;and considers them of not sufficient importance for further mention. </p>

<p>These Naassenes possessed many secret books or <i>apocrypha</i>&#8212;that is, books kept back from general circulation&#8212;and also regarded as authoritative the following scriptures: <i>The Gospel of Perfection, The Gospel of Eve, The Questions of Mary,</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <i>Concerning the Offspring of Mary, The Gospel of Philip, The Gospel according to Thomas,</i> and <i>The Gospel according to the Egyptians.</i> All of which points somewhat to an Alexandrian or Egyptian circle. </p>

<h5 align="center">ANALYSIS OF HIPPOLYTUS&#146; ACCOUNT OF THE NAASSENE DOCUMENT </h5>

<p>One of their secret MSS. had fallen into the hands of Hippolytus. It is in the Bishop of Portus&#146; quotations </p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></A></p>

<p>from this document that Reitzenstein (pp. 81 ff.) seeks to discover what he calls the &#8220;Hellenistic Myth of the God Anthr&#333;pos.&#8221; His theory is that, by eliminating the Christian citations and thoughts of the Naassene writer, we are face to face with a purely Heathen document. </p>

<p>The reproduction of their views, as given by Hippolytus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> falls according to Reitzenstein into three divisions. </p>

<p>(i.) The first begins with the explanation of the name &#8220;Naassene&#8221; (S. 131, 1; C. 139, 1&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>), and, after giving a few brief headings, ends (S. 134, 8; C. 141, 2) with the statement that the writer of the MS. said they had their tradition from James, the Brother of the Lord, who had delivered it to Mariamn&#275;. </p>

<p>(iii.) The third begins (S. 170, 64; C. 178, 1) with another explanation of the name. In both of these parts are found remains of hymns from some liturgical collection. </p>

<p>(ii.) Between i. and ii. lies a longer exposition in which Hippolytus tries to show that the Naassene doctrines are taken from the Mysteries, culminating in the assertion that the Naassenes, as a matter of fact, were nothing else than sectaries of the Mysteries of the Mother of the Gods, in proof of which he quotes at length from a secret document of their school. </p>

<p>Our interest in these quotations, however, is very different from that of Hippolytus, for, as Reitzenstein has now shown, it is manifest on inspection that the Christian quotations and thoughts in this document </p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></A></p>

<p>violently disrupt its underlying continuity, and that they are for the most part easily removable without damage to the sense. </p>

<p>With regard to the Old Testament quotations it is not always so easy to disentangle them from the Hellenistic source, much less from the New Testament quotations; the phenomena, however, presented by them are of such a nature that, in my opinion, there is ample evidence before us that there was a Jewish working-over of the matter before it came into the hands of the Christian overwriter. Reitzenstein, however, does not venture so far. </p>

<p>Even, then, if we were content with Reitzenstein&#146;s analysis only, it is quite clear that the quotations from the Old Testament formed no part of the original; and that we have, therefore, before us what was once a purely Heathen text, with Gnostic Christian <i>scholia,</i> or rather overworked by a Christian Gnostic. The original Pagan text had, accordingly, been cut up by the Naassene overwriter before ever it came into the hands of Hippolytus. </p>

<p>Now, as the Christianised text must have been for some time in private circulation before it reached the library of the Bishop of Portus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#8212;even if we make no allowance for a Jewish Hellenistic stratum of overwriting, still seeing that Hippolytus&#146; own view was that, in the Naassene MS., he had before him a basic document of those whom he regarded as the earliest Christian &#8220;heretics&#8221;&#8212;it is quite evident that if we were to place the date of the original Hellenistic source in the first century, we should not be doing violence even to the ecclesiastical traditional absurdity that Gnosticism first sullied the orthodox purity of the Church only </p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="green">p. 145</font></A></p>

<p>in the reign of Trajan (96-117 A.D.). But we will return to the question of date later on. </p>

<p>As the whole matter is not only one of considerable interest for the student of our treatises, but also of the greatest importance for the student of the history of Gnosticism, I shall give a translation of Hippolytus&#146; introductory and concluding sections, as well as of the intermediate section which specially concerns us, so that the reader may have a view of the whole medley as it comes to us from the hands of the heresy-hunting bishop. </p>

<p>I shall, moreover, proceed a stage further in the analysis of the material of Hippolytus than Reitzenstein has done, and hope, when the evidence has been laid before the reader, to win his assent to what appears to me to be the natural sifting out of the various elements, with resultant phenomena which are of the greatest importance for the history of Gnosticism, and, therefore, of the evolution of Christian dogmatics, and which lead to conclusions that are far too serious to be treated in the short space of a single chapter of our present essay.</p>

<p>In the following analysis H. stands for Hippolytus; C. for the Christian Gnostic final overwriter, the &#8220;Naassene&#8221; whose MS. lay before H.; J. for the Naassene Jewish mystic who preceded C. and overworked the original; S. for the original Heathen Hellenistic Source. </p>

<p>As H. and C. are of secondary importance for our immediate enquiry, though of themselves of the greatest value and interest, I shall print them in smaller type. J. I shall print in the same type as S., as nearer in contact with S. than C., and as being sometimes more difficult to detach from S. than from C. </p>

<p>The reader, to have the text of Hippolytus before him, must neglect all the critical indications and read straight on. </p>

<p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></A></p>

<p>With these brief preliminary indications we will, then, present the reader with a translation of the first section, or introductory part,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_309"></A><A HREF="#fn_309"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of Hippolytus&#146; exposure or exposition of the Naassene doctrines, begging him to remember throughout that it is a portrait painted by the hand of one of their bitterest foes. </p>

<h5 align="center">HIPPOLYTUS&#146; INTRODUCTION </h5>

<p><SPAN STYLE="font-size: small">H. The priests and chiefs of [this] doctrine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_310"></A><A HREF="#fn_310"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> were first of all those who were called Naasseni&#8212;so named in Hebrew, [in which] &#8220;serpent&#8221; is called <i>naas</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_311"></A><A HREF="#fn_311"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> But subsequently they called themselves Gnostics, pretending that they alone knew the Depths. </span></p>

<p><SPAN STYLE="font-size: small">H. For these and suchlike reasons these [Naassenes] frequent what are called the Mysteries of the Great Mother, believing that they obtain the clearest view of the Universal Mystery from the things done in them. </span></p>

<p><SPAN STYLE="font-size: small">For they have nothing beyond the [mysteries] therein enacted except that they are not emasculated. Their sole &#8220;accomplishment,&#8221; [however,] is the business of the Eunuch, for they most severely and vigilantly enjoin to abstain, as though emasculated, from intercourse with women. And the rest of their business, as we have stated at length, they carry out just like the Eunuchs. </span></p>

<p>This <SPAN STYLE="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is [His organ of] Smell, for the current of it is very rapid; and it &#8220;flows the opposite way to the Assyrians,&#8221; because after the breath is breathed out, on breathing in again, the breath that is drawn in from without, from the air, comes in more rapidly, and with greater force.

<h5 align="center">CONCLUSION OF ANALYSIS 
</h5>
<p>All this may have seemed, quite naturally, contemptible foolishness to the theological prejudices of 
our worthy Church Father; but it is difficult for me, 
even in the twentieth century, not to recognise the 
beauty of this fine Mystic Hymn, and I hope it may be 
equally difficult for at least some of my readers. </p>

<p>But to return to the consideration of our much overwritten Source. </p>

<p>This Source is plainly a commentary, or elaborate 
paraphrase, of the Recitation Ode, &#8220;Whether, blest Child 
of Kronos,&#8221; which comes at the end (&sect; 30) and not, as 
we should expect, at the beginning, and has probably 
been displaced by Hippolytus. It is an exegetical </p>

<p>commentary written from the standpoint of the 
Anthr&#333;pos-theory of the Mysteries (? originally Chald&aelig;an), the Man-doctrine. </p>

<p>This commentary seems for the most part to run on 
so connectedly, that we can almost persuade ourselves 
that we have most of it before us, the <i>lacun&aelig;</i> being 
practically insignificant. Paragraphs 6 and 7 S., however, are plainly misplaced, and &sect;&sect; 17 and 18 S. also 
as evidently break the connection.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> </p>

<h5 align="center">THE HELLENIST COMMENTATOR </h5>

<p>The writer is transparently a man learned in the 
various Mystery-rites, and his information is of the 
greatest possible importance for a study of this exceedingly obscure subject from an historical standpoint. </p>

<p>With &sect; 8 S., and the Egyptian Mystery-doctrine, we 
come to what is of peculiar interest for our present 
Trismegistic studies. Osiris is the Heavenly Man, the 
Logos; not only so, but in straitest connection with 
this tradition we have an exposition of the Hermes-doctrine, set forth by a system of allegorical interpretations of the Bible of Hellas&#8212;the Poems of the 
Homeric cycle. Here we have the evident <i>syncrasia</i> 
Thoth = Osiris = Hermes, a Hermes of the &#8220;Greek 
Wisdom,&#8221; as the Recitation Ode phrases it, and a 
doctrine which H., basing himself on the commentator 
(&sect; 10), squarely asserts the Greeks got from Egypt. </p>

<p>Nor is it without importance for us that in closest 
connection with Hermes there follow the apparently 
misplaced sections 17 and 18, dealing with the 
&#8220;Heavenly Horn,&#8221; or drinking-horn, of the Greek 
Wisdom, and the &#8220;Cup&#8221; of Anacreon; with which we 
may compare the <i>Crater,</i> Mixing-bowl or Cup, in which, </p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="green">p. 194</font></A></p>

<p>according to Plato&#146;s <i>Tim&aelig;us,</i> the Creator mingled and 
mixed the elements and souls, and also the spiritual 
Cup of the Mind in our Trismegistic treatise, &#8220;The 
Crater or Monas,&#8221; <i>C. H.,</i> iv. (v.). </p>

<p>But above all things is it astonishing that we should 
find the commentator in S. quoting (&sect; 9) a <i>logos</i> from 
a document which, as we have shown in the note 
appended to the passage, is in every probability a 
Trismegistic treatise of the P&#339;mandres type. </p>

<h5 align="center">THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN OVERWRITERS </h5>

<p>This commentary S. was worked over by a Jewish 
Hellenistic mystic J., whose general ideas and method 
of exegesis are exactly paralleled by those of Philo. 
In my opinion, he was a contemporary of that period 
and a member of one of those communities whom Philo 
classes generally as Therapeut. He was, moreover, 
not a worshipper of the serpent, but a worshipper of 
that Glorious Reality symbolised as the Serpent 
of Wisdom, and this connects him with initiation 
into Egypto-Chald&aelig;an or Chald&aelig;o-Egyptian Mysteries. 
These he finds set forth allegorically in the prophetical 
scriptures of his race. His quotations from the LXX. 
show him to be, like Philo, an Alexandrian Hellenistic 
Jew; the LXX. was his Targum. </p>

<p>J. again was overwritten by C., a Christian Gnostic, 
no enemy of either J. or S., but one who claimed that 
he and his were the true realisers of all that had gone 
before; he is somewhat boastful, but yet recognises 
that the Christ-doctrine is not an innovation but a 
consummation. The phenomena presented by the New 
Testament quotations of C. are, in my opinion, of extraordinary interest, especially his quotations from or 
parallels with the Fourth Gospel. His quotations from </p>

<p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></A></p>

<p>
or parallels with the Synoptics are almost of the same 
nature as those of Justin; he is rather dealing with 
&#8220;Memoirs of the Apostles&#8221; than with verbatim quotations from our stereotyped Gospels. His parallels 
with the Fourth Gospel also seem to me to open up the 
question as to whether or no he is in touch with 
&#8220;Sources&#8221; of that &#8220;Johannine&#8221; document. </p>

<p>On top of all our strata and deposits, we have&#8212;to 
continue the metaphor of excavation, and if it be not 
thought somewhat uncharitable&#8212;the refutatory rubbish 
of Hippolytus, which need no longer detain us here. </p>

<p>I would, therefore, suggest that C. is to be placed 
somewhere about the middle of the second century A.D.; 
J. is contemporary with Philo&#8212;say the first quarter of 
the first century A.D.; the Pagan commentator of S. is 
prior to J.&#8212;say somewhere in the last half of the first 
century B.C.; while the Recitation Ode is still earlier, 
and can therefore be placed anywhere in the early 
Hellenistic period, the <i>termini</i> being thus 300-50 B.C.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> </p>

<p>And if the redactor or commentator in S. is to 
be placed somewhere in the last half of the first 
century B.C. (and this is, of course, taking only the 
<i>minimum</i> of liberty), then the P&#339;mandres type of 
our literature, which J. quotes as scripture, must, in its 
original Greek form, be placed back of that&#8212;say at 
least in the first half of the first century B.C., as a 
moderate estimate.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> If those dates are not proved, </p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></A></p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> I am at anyrate fairly confident they cannot be 
disproved. </p>

<h5 align="center">ZOSIMUS AND THE ANTHROPOS-DOCTRINE </h5>

<p>That, moreover, the Anthr&#333;pos-doctrine, to the spirit 
of which the whole commentary of our S. exegete is 
accommodated, was also fundamental with the adherents of the Trismegistic tradition, may be clearly 
seen from the interesting passage (which we give in the 
Fragments at the end of the third Volume) of Zosimus, 
a member of what Reitzenstein calls the P&#339;mandres 
Community, who flourished somewhere at the end of 
the third and beginning of the fourth century A.D.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> </p>

<p>The sources of Zosimus for the Anthr&#333;pos-doctrine, 
he tells us, are, in addition to the Books of Hermes, 
certain translations into Greek and Egyptian of books 
containing traditions (mystery-traditions, presumably) 
of the Chald&aelig;ans, Parthians, Medes, and Hebrews on 
the subject. This statement is of the very first importance for the history of Gnosticism as well as for 
appreciating certain elements in Trismegisticism. 
Though the indication of this literature is vague, it 
nevertheless mentions four factors as involved in the 
Hebrew tradition; the Gnostic Hebrews, as we should </p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></A></p>

<p>
expect, were handing on elements from Chald&aelig;an, 
Parthian, and Median traditions. Translations of these 
books were to be found scattered throughout Egypt, 
and especially in the great library at Alexandria. </p>

<p>There is, in my opinion, no necessity precisely, with 
Reitzenstein (p. 106, n. 6), to designate these books the 
&#8220;Ptolemaic Books,&#8221; and so to associate them with a 
notice found in the apocryphal &#8220;Eighth Book of 
Moses,&#8221; where, together with that of the <i>Archangelic 
Book of Moses,</i> there is mention of the Fifth Book of the 
&#8220;Ptolemaic Books,&#8221; described as a book of multifarious 
wisdom under the title &#8220;One and All,&#8221; and containing 
the account of the &#8220;Genesis of Fire and Darkness.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> </p>

<p>Another source of Zosimus was the <i>Pinax</i> of Bitos 
or Bitys, of whom we shall treat in considering the 
information of Jamblichus. </p>

<p>From all of these indications we are assured that 
there was already in the first centuries B.C. a well-developed Hellenistic doctrine of the descent of man 
from the Man Above, and of his return to that heavenly 
state by his mastery of the powers of the cosmos. </p>

<h5 align="center">PHILO OF ALEXANDRIA ON THE MAN-DOCTRINE </h5>

<p>This date is further confirmed by the testimony of 
Philo (<i>c.</i> 30 B.C.-45 A.D.). </p>

<p>For, quoting the verse: &#8220;We are all sons of One 
Man,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_600"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he addresses those who are &#8220;companions of 
wisdom and knowledge&#8221; as those who are &#8220;Sons of 
one and the same Father&#8212;no mortal father, but an 
immortal Sire, the Man of God, who being the Reason 
(<i>Logos</i>) of the Eternal, is of necessity himself eternal.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_601"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> </p>

<p>And again, a little further on: </p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></A></p>

<p>
&#8220;And if a man should not as yet have the good 
fortune to be worthy to be called Son of God, let him 
strive manfully to set himself in order&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_601"></A><A HREF="#fn_602"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> according to 
His First-born Reason (<i>Logos</i>), the Oldest Angel, who is 
as though it were the Angel-chief of many names; for 
he is called Dominion, and Name of God, and Reason, 
and Man-after-His-Likeness, and Seeing Israel. </p>

<p>&#8220;And for this reason I was induced a little before 
to praise the principles of those who say: &#145;We are 
all sons of One Man.&#146; For even if we have not yet 
become fit to be judged Sons of God, we may at any 
rate be Sons of His Eternal Likeness, His Most Holy 
Reason (<i>Logos</i>); for Reason, the Eldest of all Angels, 
is God&#146;s Likeness [or Image].&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_602"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> </p>
<p></p>

<p>Thus Philo gives us additional proof, if more were 
needed, for the full Anthr&#333;pos-doctrine was evidently 
fundamental in his circle&#8212;that is to say, in the 
thought-atmosphere of the Hellenistic theology, or the 
religio-philosophy, or theosophy, of his day, the beginning of the first century A.D. </p>

<p>This date alone is sufficient for our purpose; but it 
is not too bold a statement even to say that the 
Man-Mystery was a fundamental concept of the 
brilliant period of the Hellenistic syncretism which 
succeeded to the founding of Alexandria&#8212;the period 
of the expansion of Hellas beyond her national borders; 
in other words, her birth into the greater world. </p>

<p>It is enough to know that the Mystery was hidden 
and yet revealed in the shadow-garments of Chald&aelig;an, 
Babylonian, Magian, Ph&#339;nician, Hebrew, Egyptian, 
Phrygian, Thracian, and Greek mystery-traditions. It 
was, in brief, fundamental in all such wisdom-shows, 
and necessarily so, for it was the Christ-Mystery. </p>

L.,</i> 405 f .; for Martha, Our Lady, see <i>ibid.,</i> 375 ff.) In the Gnostic <i>Acts of Philip,</i> Mariamn&#275;, or Mariamm&#275; (both forms being found in the MSS., according to R. A. Lipsius, <i>Die apokr. Apostelgeschichten</i>&#8212;Brunswick, 1884&#8212;iii. 12), is the &#8220;virgin sister&#8221; of Philip, and plays an important <i>r&ocirc;le</i> as prophetess.

The tradition of the Gnosis from James, the Brother of the Lord, is asserted by Clement of Alexandria in Book VI. of his lost work, <i>The Institutions,</i> where he writes: &#8220;The Lord imparted the Gnosis to James the Just, to John and Peter, after His resurrection; these delivered it to the rest of the Apostles, and they to the Seventy&#8221; (Euseb., <i>Hist.

The union (or marriage) which joins it to generation, or to earth-life&#8212;the nature of things on earth; (ii.) The union which joins it with death&#8212;the nature of the things &#8220;beneath&#8221; the earth; (iii.) The union which joins it with formal beauty, or beauty in form (&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#942;)&#8212;the nature of super-terrene (or sublunary) things, here regarded as the Elysian state. <br><br>The love of the Mother of the Gods for the Soul represents the &#8220;fourth state&#8221; (the <i>tur&#299;ya</i> of Vedantic mystic psychology), or the absorption of the masculine power of the Soul by its own higher Feminine Nature. <i>Cf.</i> in Damascius&#146; &#8220;Life of Isidores&#8221; (Photius, <i>Bibl.,</i> ed. Bekker, 345 a. 5: &#8220;I fell asleep, and in a vision Attis seemed to appear to me, and, on behalf of the Mother of the Gods, to initiate me into the feast called Hilaria&#8212;a mystery which discloses the way of our salvation from Hades.&#8221; Hades, the realm of Sel&#275;n&#275;, is not Tartarus, the realm of Death.</P>

And Salome said to Him: Did I therefore well in bearing no children? The Lord answered and said: Eat every Herb, but eat not that which hath bitterness. When Salome asked when these things about which she questioned should be made known, the Lord said: When ye trample upon the Garment of Shame; when the Two become One, and Male with Female neither male nor female.&#8221; And with the last logos of the above compare the new-found fragment of a lost Gospel: &#8220;His disciples say unto Him: When wilt thou be manifest to us, and when shall we see Thee? He saith: When ye shall be stripped and not be ashamed.&#8221;&#8212;Grenfell and Hunt, <i>New Sayings of Jesus</i> (London, 1904), p. 40.

(Vienna, 1888)&#8212;where it is said that the Sun will then move towards the Pole, and the theurgist will see Seven Virgins (the Seven Fortunes of Heaven) approach, and Seven Youths, with heads of bulls (the Pole-lords of Heaven), who make the axis turn (661-670). Compare this with the &#8220;cylinder&#8221; idea in the fragment of <i>K. K.</i> Then there will appear the Great God &#8220;in a white robe and trowsers, with a crown of gold on his head, holding in his right hand the golden shoulder of a heifer, that is the Bear that sets in motion and keeps the heaven turning in due seasons.&#8221; This God will pronounce an oracle, and the theurgist will then receive the gift of divination. The special interest of this tradition is that it contains a Magian element (to wit, the &#8220;trowsers&#8221;), and this connects closely with Phrygia and the cult that was wedded most closely with the Mithriaca, namely, that of the Mother of the Gods.</P>

In the monuments representing the bull-slaying myth of the Mithriaca, the bull&#146;s tail is frequently terminated in &#8220;<i>une truffe d&#146;epis</i>&#8221;&#8212;the number varies, being either one, three, five, or seven. In the <i>Bundahish</i> all things are generated from the body, especially from the spinal marrow, of the slain bull. Sometimes the wheat-ears are represented as flowing like blood from the wound above the heart inflicted by the dagger of Mithras, the Bull-slayer (<i>op. cit.,</i> i. 186, 187). The constellation of the Wheat-ear in the Virgin, which was supposed to give good harvests, presumably refers to the same idea (<i>cf.</i> Eratosth., <i>Cataster.,</i> 9). See <i>op. cit.,</i> i. 202, 205, n. 2. The wheat-ear, therefore, symbolised in one aspect the &#8220;generative seed&#8221;&#8212;in animals and men-animals the spermatozoa, in man a mystery. Mithraicism had the closest connection with the Phrygian Mystery Cult; indeed, the Magna Mater Mysteries were used by it for the initiation of women, who were excluded from the Mithriaca proper.</P>

Both S. and C. translate it correctly as &#8220;<i>spina,</i>&#8221; meaning &#8220;backbone&#8221;; it has, however, been erroneously translated as &#8220;spur.&#8221; Plutarch, <i>De Is. et Os.,</i> lxii. 3, tells us that the load-stone was called by the Egyptians &#8220;bone of Horus&#8221;; and Horus is the &#8220;hawk&#8221; <i>par excellence,</i> the &#8220;golden hawk.&#8221; <i>Cf.</i> Budge, <i>Gods of the Egyptians,</i> ii. 246, who says that we are informed by Manetho (thus making Manetho the main source of Plutarch) that the &#8220;load-stone is by the Egyptians called the &#145;bone of Horus,&#146; as iron is the &#145;bone of Typho.&#146;&#8221; In the chapter of the Ritual dealing with the deification of the members, the backbone of the deceased is identified with the backbone of Set (xlii. 12). Elsewhere (cviii. 8) the deceased is said &#8220;to depart having the harpoon of iron in him.&#8221; This seems to suggest the black backbone of death and the golden backbone of life.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_583"></A><A HREF="th110.htm#fr_582">190:6</A> The text of this Hymn is in places very corrupt; I have followed Cruice&#146;s emendations mostly. Schneidewin, for some reason or other which he does not state, omits it bodily from his Latin translation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_584"></A><A HREF="th110.htm#fr_583">191:1</A> This attribution may be thought by some to be questionable; but as it is far more similar to the thought-sphere of J. than to that of C., I have so assigned it. It belonged to the same circles to which we must assign the sources of J.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_587"></A><A HREF="th110.htm#fr_586">191:4</A> The Codex has &#7956;&#955;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#957;, which, with Miller, we correct into &#7952;&#955;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#965;. Is this a parallel with the &#8220;lost sheep&#8221; idea? Can it possibly connect with the conception underlying the phrases on the golden tablets found in tombs of &#8220;Orphic&#8221; initiates, on the territory of ancient Sybaris: &#8220;A kid thou hast fallen into the milk&#8221; (&#8220;Timpone grande&#8221; Tablet <i>a,</i> Naples Museum, Kaibel, C.I.G.I.S., 642); and, &#8220;A kid I have fallen into milk&#8221; (&#8220;Campagno&#8221; Tablet <i>a, ibid.,</i> 641, and Append., p. 668)? But this connection is very hazy; it more probably suggests the <i>nebris</i> or &#8220;fawn-skin&#8221; of the Bacchic initiates (see my <i>Orpheus,</i> &#8220;The Fawn-skin,&#8221; pp. 243 ff., for an explanation). Cruice proposes to substitute &#8017;&#948;&#945;&#961;&#8056;&#957; (&#8220;watery&#8221;); but there seems no reason why we should entirely reject the reading of the Codex, especially as C.&#146;s suggestion breaks the rule of the &#8220;more difficult&#8221; reading being the preferable.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_590"></A><A HREF="th110.htm#fr_589">192:1</A> Cruice thinks this refers to the breath of God&#146;s anger; but surely it refers to the Holy Spirit of God?</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_596"></A><A HREF="th110.htm#fr_595">195:1</A> Wilamowitz&#146; hesitating attribution of it to the reign of Hadrian (117-138 A.D.) is, in my opinion, devoid of any objective support whatever. (See R., p. 102.) Reitzenstein himself (p. 165) would place it in the second century B.C.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_597"></A><A HREF="th110.htm#fr_596">195:2</A> Incidentally also it may be pointed out that this analysis gives the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> to Salmon&#146;s contention (&#8220;The Cross-references in the Philosophumena,&#8221; <i>Hermathena,</i> 1885, v. 389 if.) that the great systems of the Gnosis made known to us only by Hippolytus are all the work of a single forger who imposed upon the credulity of the heresy-hunting Bishop of Portus. This contention, though to our mind one of the most striking instances of &#8220;the good Homer nodding,&#8221; was nevertheless practically endorsed by St&auml;helin (<i>Die gnostische Quellen Hippolyts in seiner Hauptschrift gegen die Haeretiken,</i> 1890; in <i>Texte u. Untersuchungen,</i> VI.), who went over the whole ground opened up by Salmon with minute and scrupulous industry. The general weakness of this extraordinary hypothesis of forgery has, however, been well pointed out by De Faye in his <i>Introduction &agrave; l&#146;&Eacute;tude du Gnosticisme au II<sup>e</sup> et au III<sup>e</sup> Si&egrave;cle</i> (Paris, 1903), pp. 24 ff.; though De Faye also maintains a late date.</P>
