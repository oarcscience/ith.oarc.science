##### OF THE GREEK DISCIPLES OF EGYPTIANS AND OF PYTHAGORAS AND HIS SYMBOLS

X. 1. And the most wise of the Greeks also are witnesses—Solon, Thales,
Plato, Eudoxus, Pythagoras, and, as some say, Lycurgus as well—through
coming to Egypt and associating with her priests.

2\. And so they say that Eudoxus was hearer of Chonouphis <span
id="fr_859"></span>[3](#fn_860) of Memphis, and Solon of Sonchis of
Saïs, and Pythagoras of Œnuphis of Heliopolis.

3\. And the last especially, as it appears, being contemplated and
contemplating, <span id="fr_860"></span>[4](#fn_861) brought back to the

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

memory of his men their <span id="fr_861"></span>[1](#fn_862) symbolic
and mysterious \[art\], containing their dogmas in dark sayings.

4\. For most of the Pythagoric messages leave out nothing of what are
called the hieroglyphic letters; for instance: “Eat not on what bears
two”; <span id="fr_862"></span>[2](#fn_863) “Sit not down on
measure”; <span id="fr_863"></span>[3](#fn_864) “Plant not
phœnix”; <span id="fr_864"></span>[4](#fn_865) “Stir not fire with
knife <span id="fr_865"></span>[5](#fn_866) in house.”

5\. And, for myself at least, I think that his men’s calling the monad
Apollo, <span id="fr_866"></span>[6](#fn_867) and the dyad Artemis, and
the hebdomad Athena, and the first cube <span
id="fr_867"></span>[7](#fn_868) Poseidon, also resembles those whose
statues preside over the sacred places, and whose dramas are acted
\[there\], yea and \[the names\] painted <span
id="fr_868"></span>[8](#fn_869) \[there as well\].

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

6\. For they write the King and Lord, Osiris, <span
id="fr_869"></span>[1](#fn_870) with “eye” and “sceptre.” <span
id="fr_870"></span>[2](#fn_871) But some interpret the name also as
“many-eyed,” since in the Egyptian tongue *os* means “many,” and *iri*
“eye.”

7\. And they write Heaven, as unageing through eternity, <span
id="fr_871"></span>[3](#fn_872) with “heart,” \[that is\] spirit, <span
id="fr_872"></span>[4](#fn_873) \[rising\] from “altar” <span
id="fr_873"></span>[5](#fn_874) underneath.

8\. And at Thebes there used to be set up hand-less statues of judges,
while the \[statue\] of the chief judge had its eyes tight shut,—seeing
that Justice neither gives nor takes gift, and is not worked on.

9\. And for the warriors, “scarab” was their seal-emblem;—for the scarab
is not female, but all \[scarabs\] are male, <span
id="fr_874"></span>[6](#fn_875) and they engender their seed into matter
\[or material\] which they make into spheres, preparing a field not so
much of nourishment <span id="fr_875"></span>[7](#fn_876) as of genesis.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_860"></span>[274:3](th122.htm#fr_859) That is, presumably,
Knouph or Knef.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[274:4](th122.htm#fr_860) θαυμασθεὶς καὶ
θαυμάσας, passive and active of the verb of θαῦμα, generally translated
“wonder,” but meaning radically “look at with awe”; hence contemplate
religiously (the art of θεωρία), and hence the Platonic (? Pythagorean)
saying: “The beginning of philosophy is wonder.” Compare the variants of
the new-found Jesus logos (“Let not him who seeks,” etc.), which
preserve both θαμβηθεὶς and θαυμάσας.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[275:1](th122.htm#fr_861) That is, to the men
of Greece the art of the Egyptians.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[275:2](th122.htm#fr_862) ἐπὶ δίφρον (=
δι-φόρον)—variously translated “off a chair,” “in a chariot,” hence “on
a journey.” “That which bears two” is that which either carries two or
brings forth two; the logos is thus, perhaps, a warning against falling
into duality of any kind, and hence an injunction to contemplate unity.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[275:3](th122.htm#fr_863) The χοῖνιξ was a dry
measure, the standard of a man’s (slave’s) daily allowance of corn.
Hence, perhaps, in one sense the symbol may mean: “Be not content with
your ‘daily bread’ only”; yet any meaning connected with “that which
measures” would suit the interpretation, such as, “Best not on measure,
but move in the unimmeasurable.”

<span id="fn_865"></span>[275:4](th122.htm#fr_864) φοῖνιξ means a
“Phœnician” (as opposed to an Egyptian), a “date palm” (as opposed to a
“pine”), and a “phœnix”; in colour this was “purple red,” “purple,” or
“crimson.” The phœnix *proper* rose again from its ashes; *its* colour
was golden. φυτύειν means “plant,” but also “engender,” “beget.”

<span id="fn_866"></span>[275:5](th122.htm#fr_865) μάχαιρα was, in
Homeric times, the technical term for the sacred sacrificial knife—the
knife that kills and divides the victim’s body, while the fire
transmutes and consumes it. There may, perhaps, be some connection
between the symbol and the gnomic couplet of Hesiod quoted above (iv.
3); it is, however, generally said to mean, “Do not provoke an angry
man,” but this leaves out of consideration the concluding words “in
house.”

<span id="fn_867"></span>[275:6](th122.htm#fr_866) *Cf.* lxxv. 14.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[275:7](th122.htm#fr_867) Presumably the ogdoad
or eight.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[275:8](th122.htm#fr_868) Or “written” or
“engraved.”

<span id="fn_870"></span>[276:1](th122.htm#fr_869) Eg. Ȧsȧr.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[276:2](th122.htm#fr_870) Generally a “throne”
in the hieroglyphs. But for the numerous variants, see Budge, *Gods of
the Egyptians,* ii. 113. *Cf.* li. 1 below.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[276:3](th122.htm#fr_871) ἀϊδιότητα—lit.,
form-(or idea-) less-ness; transcending all forms.

<span id="fn_873"></span>[276:4](th122.htm#fr_872) θυμὸν, one of the
most primitive terms of Greek psychology—spirit or soul, or more
generally life-principle.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[276:5](th122.htm#fr_873) ἐσχάρα, an altar for
burnt offerings; here probably symbolising Earth as the syzygy of
Heaven.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[276:6](th122.htm#fr_874) It is to be
remembered that the “mark” of the warriors was their manliness (ix. 1).

<span id="fn_876"></span>[276:7](th122.htm#fr_875) Matter (ὕλη) being
the Nurse, “according to Plato.” The legend was that the scarab beetle
deposited its seed into dung which it first made into balls (lxxiv. 5).
