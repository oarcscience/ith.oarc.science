#### CONCERNING ISIS AND OSIRIS

##### ADDRESS TO KLEA CONCERNING GNOSIS AND THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH <span id="fr_780"></span>[1](#fn_781)

I. 1. <span id="fr_781"></span>[2](#fn_782) While all who have mind, O
Klea, should ask for all their blessings from the Gods—let *us,* by
pursuing after them, pray to obtain from them those \[blessings\] of
gnosis <span id="fr_782"></span>[3](#fn_783) concerning them, as far as
’tis within the reach of men; in that there’s nothing greater for a man
to get, nor more majestic for a God to give, than Truth.

2\. Of other things their God *gives* men what they require, whereas of
mind and wisdom He *gives a share* <span id="fr_783"></span>[4](#fn_784)
to them—since He \[Himself\] possesses these and uses \[them\].

For the Divine is neither blest through silver and through gold, nor
strong through thunderings and lightnings, but \[blest and strong\] by
gnosis and by wisdom.

3\. And thus most finely of all things which he hath said about the
Gods—sounding aloud:

> <span style="font-size: small">Yea have they both a common source and
> one \[fair\] native land;  
> But Zeus came into being first and he knew more—</span>

hath Homer made pronouncement of the primacy of Zeus as more majestic,
in that in gnosis and in wisdom it <span id="fr_784"></span>[5](#fn_785)
is older.

4\. Nay, I believe that the good fortune of æonian life—the which the
God hath gotten for his lot—is

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

that by reason of His gnosis the things in genesis should not entirely
die; for when the knowing of existing things and being wise is taken
from it, freedom from death is Time—not Life.
