<h5 align="center">THE SYMBOLISM OF THE SISTRUM</h5>

<p>LXIII. 1. The sistrum (&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;) also shows that existent things must be shaken up (&#963;&#949;&#943;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;) and never have cessation from impulse, but as it were be wakened up and agitated when they fall asleep and die away. </p>

<p>2. For they say they turn aside and beat off Typhon with sistra,&#8212;signifying that when corruption binds nature fast and brings her to a stand, [then] generation frees her and raises her from death by means of motion. </p>

<p>3. Now the sistrum has a curved top, and its arch contains the four [things] that are shaken. For the part of the cosmos which is subject to generation and corruption, is circumscribed by the sphere of the moon, and all [things] in it are moved and changed by the four elements&#8212;fire and earth and water and air. </p>

<p>4. And on the arch of the sistrum, at the top, they put the metal figure of a cat with a human face, and at the bottom, below the shaken things, the face sometimes of Isis and sometimes of Nephthys,&#8212;symbolising by the faces generation and consummation (for these are the changes and motions of the elements), and by the cat the moon, on account of the variable nature,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1197"></A><A HREF="#fn_1198"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> night habits, and fecundity of the beast. </p>

<p>5. For it is fabled to bring forth one, then two, and [then] three, and four, and five [at a birth], and then adds one by one until seven;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1198"></A><A HREF="#fn_1199"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> so that in all she brings forth eight-and-twenty, the number of lights of the moon. </p>

<p>6. This, however, is probably somewhat too mythical; anyway, the pupils of its eyes seem to become full and dilate at the full-moon, and to contract and shut out the light during the wanings of that luminary. </p>

<p>7. And by the human face of the cat is signified the intellectual and reasonable nature of the changes that take place in connection with the moon. </p>

King translates this &#8220;pied colour,&#8221; and deduces that &#8220;the original colour of the cat was tabby&#8221;; but, as the school-boy says, I don&#146;t see it.</P>
