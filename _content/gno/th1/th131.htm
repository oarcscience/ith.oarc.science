<h5 align="center">THE THEORY OF THE PHYSICISTS </h5>

<p>XXXII. 1.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1058"></A><A HREF="#fn_1059"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> The above [data] then afford [us] such and such suggestions. But from another start let us consider the simplest of those who seem to give a more philosophical explanation. </p>

<p>2. These are those who say that, just as the Greeks allegorise time as Kronos, and air as Hera, and the changes of air into fire as the generation of Heph&aelig;stus, so, with the Egyptians, Osiris uniting with Isis (earth) is Neilos, and Typhon is the sea, into which Neilos falling vanishes and is dispersed, except such part [of him] as the earth takes up and receives, and so becomes endowed with productiveness by him. </p>

<p>3. And there is a sacred dirge made on Kronos&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1059"></A><A HREF="#fn_1060"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>&#8212;and it laments &#8220;him who is born in the left-hand and died in the right-hand parts.&#8221; </p>


<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="green">p. 308</font></A></p>

<p>4. For Egyptians think that the eastern [parts] of cosmos are &#8220;face,&#8221; the northern &#8220;right hand,&#8221; and the southern &#8220;left hand.&#8221; </p>

<p>5. The Nile, accordingly, since it flows from the southern [parts] and is consumed by the sea in the northern, is naturally said to have its birth in the left hand and its death in the right hand. </p>

<p>6. Wherefore the priests both pronounce the sea expiate and call salt &#8220;Typhon&#146;s foam&#8221;; and one of the chief prohibitions they have is: &#8220;Not to set salt on table.&#8221; And they do not give greeting to sailors,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1060"></A><A HREF="#fn_1061"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> because they use the sea, and get their living from it. And for this cause chiefly they accuse fish of being a cause of offence, and write up: &#8220;Hate fish!&#8221; </p>

<p>7. At anyrate at Sa&iuml;s, in the entrance of the temple of Athena, there used to be chiselled up &#8220;babe,&#8221; &#8220;old man,&#8221; and after that &#8220;hawk,&#8221; then &#8220;fish,&#8221; and last of all &#8220;hippopotamus.&#8221; </p>

<p>8. This meant in symbols: &#8220;O ye who are being born and are dying, God hates shamelessness.&#8221; </p>

<p>9. For &#8220;babe&#8221; is the symbol of birth, and &#8220;old man&#8221; of death, and by &#8220;hawk&#8221; they mean God, and by &#8220;fish&#8221; hatred&#8212;as has been said on account of the sea&#8212;and by &#8220;hippopotamus&#8221; shamelessness, for it is fabled that after it has killed its sire it violates its dam. </p>

<p>10. Moreover, what is said by the Pythagorics, namely, that the sea is the tears of Kronos, would seem to riddle the fact of its not being pure and cognate with itself. </p>

<p>11. Let these things then be stated from outside sources as matters of common information. </p>

<p>XXXIII. 1. But the more wise of the priests call not only the Nile Osiris, and the sea Typhon; but [they </p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="green">p. 309</font></A></p>

<p>call] without exception every source and power that moistens, Osiris&#8212;considering [him] cause of generation and essence of seed, and Typhon everything dry and fiery, and of a drying nature generally and one hostile to moisture. </p>

<p>2. And for this cause also, as they think he [Typhon] was born with a reddish-yellow body, somewhat pale, they do not by any means readily meet or willingly associate with men that look like this. </p>

<p>3. On the other hand, again, they say in the language of myth that Osiris was born black, because all [Nile] water blackens both earth and garments and clouds when mixed [with them], and [because] moisture in the young makes their hair black, whereas greyness comes on those past their prime, as though it were a turning pale owing to its drying up. </p>

<p>4. The spring, too, is blooming and productive and balmy; but autumn, through lack of moisture, is inimical to plants and baneful to animals. </p>

<p>5. And the ox that is kept at Sun-city which they call Mnevis&#8212;sacred to Osiris, while some also consider it sire of Apis&#8212;is black [also] and has second honours after Apis. </p>

<p>6. Moreover, they call Egypt, since it is especially black-soiled, just like the black of the eye, Ch&#275;mia, and liken it to a heart; for it is warm and moist, and is mostly confined in, and adjacent to, the southern part of the civilised world, just like the heart [is] in man&#146;s left-hand side. </p>

<p>XXXIV. 1. Moreover, they say that sun and moon do not use chariots for vehicles, but sail round in boats&#8212;[thus] riddling their being nourished by and being born in the &#8220;Moist.&#8221; </p>

<p>2. And they think that Homer also, like Thales, set down Water as source and birth of all things, after </p>

<p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></A></p>

<p>learning [it] from Egyptians; for that Oceanus is Osiris, and T&#275;thys&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1061"></A><A HREF="#fn_1062"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Isis, as nursing all things and rearing them all up together. </p>

<p>3. For Greeks also call &#8220;emission of seed&#8221; &#7936;&#960;-&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957; and &#8220;intercourse&#8221; &#963;&#965;&#957;-&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957;, and &#8220;son&#8221; (&#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#957;) from &#8220;water&#8221; (&#8021;&#948;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;) and &#8220;moisten&#8221; (&#8023;&#963;&#945;&#953;);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1062"></A><A HREF="#fn_1063"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and [they call] Dionysus Hu&#275;s, as lord of the Moist Nature, in that he is no other than Osiris. </p>

<p>4. In fact, Hellanicus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1063"></A><A HREF="#fn_1064"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> seems to have heard Osiris called Hu-siris by the priests; for he persists in thus calling the god, presumably from his nature and power of invention.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1064"></A><A HREF="#fn_1065"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> </p>
