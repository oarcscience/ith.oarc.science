<h5 align="center">CONCERNING INCENSE</h5>

<p>LXXIX. 1. And must I also speak of the daily incense-offerings, as I promised,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1258"></A><A HREF="#fn_1259"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the reader should first of all have in mind the fact, that not only have men [in general] always paid most serious attention to things that conduce to health, but that especially in sacred ceremonies and purifications and prescribed modes of life &#8220;healthy&#8221; is not less important than &#8220;holy&#8221;; for they did not think it right to render service to the Pure and perfectly Harmless and Unpolluted with either bodies or with souls festering and diseased. </p>

<p>2. Since, then, the air&#8212;of which we make most use, and with which we have most to do&#8212;does not always keep the same disposition and blend, but at night is condensed, and weighs down the body, and brings the soul into a desponding and anxious state, as though it had become mist-like and heavy; [therefore] as soon as they get up they incense with pine resin, sanifying and purifying the air by its&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1259"></A><A HREF="#fn_1260"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> disintegration, and fanning up again the [fire of the] spirit connate with body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1260"></A><A HREF="#fn_1261"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> </p>

<p>

<p>which had died down,&#8212;since its perfume possesses a vehement and penetrating [force]. </p>

<p>3. And, again, at mid-day, perceiving that the sun draws from the earth by force an exceedingly large and heavy exhalation, and commingles it with the air, they incense with myrrh.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1261"></A><A HREF="#fn_1262"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> For its heat dissolves and disperses the turbid and mud-like combination in the atmosphere. </p>

<p>4. And, indeed, physicians seem to relieve sufferers from plague by making a great blaze, as though it cleared the air. But it clears it better if they burn fragrant woods, such as [those] of cypress, juniper, and pine. </p>

<p>5. At any rate, they say that at Athens, at the time of the Great Plague, Akr&#333;n the physician became famous through ordering them to keep fires burning by the side of the sick, for he [thus] benefitted not a few. </p>

<p>6. And Aristotle says that the sweet-smelling odours, given off by perfumes and flowers and meadows, conduce no less to health than to enjoyment; because by their warmth and softness they diffuse themselves gently through the brain, which is naturally cold and as though congested. </p>

<p>7. And if, moreover, they call myrrh <i>bal</i> among Egyptians&#8212;and in translation this comes pretty near to meaning the dispersion of silly talk&#8212;this also affords some evidence for the reason why [they use it]. </p>

<p>LXXX. 1. And [finally] <i>kuphi</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1262"></A><A HREF="#fn_1263"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is a mixture composed of sixteen ingredients:&#8212;of honey, and wine, and raisins, and cyperus;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1263"></A><A HREF="#fn_1264"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of pine-resin, and myrrh, </p>

<p>
</p>

<p>and aspalathus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1264"></A><A HREF="#fn_1265"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and seseli;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1265"></A><A HREF="#fn_1266"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and further of mastich,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1266"></A><A HREF="#fn_1267"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and bitumen,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1267"></A><A HREF="#fn_1268"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and nightshade,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1268"></A><A HREF="#fn_1269"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and sorrel; and in addition to these of both junipers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1269"></A><A HREF="#fn_1270"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> (of which they call the one the larger and the other the smaller), and cardamum, and sweet-flag.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1270"></A><A HREF="#fn_1271"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> </p>

<p>2. And these are not compounded in a haphazard way, but with the sacred writings being read aloud&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1271"></A><A HREF="#fn_1272"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> to the perfume-makers when they mix them. </p>

<p>3. And as to their number,&#8212;even though it has all the appearance of square from square, and [that too] the only one of equally equal numbers that has the power of making the perimeter equal to the area,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1272"></A><A HREF="#fn_1273"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> it must be said that its serviceableness for this purpose at least is of the slightest. </p>

<p>4. But the majority of the ingredients, as they possess aromatic properties, liberate a sweet breath and healthy exhalation, by which both the air is changed, and the body being gently and softly moved by the vapour, falls asleep&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1273"></A><A HREF="#fn_1274"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> and loosens the distressing strain of the day&#146;s anxieties, as though they were knots, [and yet] without any intoxication. </p>

<p>5. Moreover, they polish up the image-making and receptive organ of dreams like a mirror, and make it clearer, no less than the playing on the lyre which the Pythagoreans used to use before sleep, thus charming away and sanifying the passionate and reason-less nature of the soul. </p>

<p>6. For things smelt call back the failing sense, and often, on the other hand, dull and quiet it by [their] soothing [effect], when their exhalations are diffused through the body; just as some of the physicians say that sleep is induced when the vaporisation of the food, as it were creeping gently round the inward parts and groping about, produces a kind of tickling. </p>

<p>7. And they use <i>kuphi</i> both as draught and mixture; for when it is drunk it is thought to purge the intestines, [but when applied externally&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1274"></A><A HREF="#fn_1275"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>] to be an emollient. </p>

<p>8. And apart from these [considerations], resin is a work of the sun; and myrrh [comes from] the exudation of the trees under the sun-heat; while of the ingredients of <i>kuphi,</i> some flourish more at night, like all things whose nature it is to be nourished by cool breezes and shade and dew and damp. </p>

<p>9. Seeing that the light of day is one and single, and Pindar tells us that the sun is seen &#8220;through empty &aelig;ther&#8221;;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1275"></A><A HREF="#fn_1276"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> while air is a blend and mixture of many lights and properties, as it were of seeds dropped from every star into one [field]. </p>

<p>10. Naturally, then, they use the former as incenses by day, as being single and having their birth from the sun; and the latter when night sets in, as being mixed and manifold in its qualities. </p>
