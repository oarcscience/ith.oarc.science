##### CONCERNING THE THEORY OF EVEMERUS

XXII\. 1. Now, since many of such \[? tombs\] are spoken of and pointed
out, those who think these \[myths\] commemorate the awe-inspiring and
mighty works and passions of kings and tyrants who, through surpassing
virtue and power, put in a claim for the reputation of divinity, and
afterwards experienced reverses of fortune,—employ a very easy means of
escape from the \[true\] reason (*logos*), and not unworthily transfer
the ill-omened \[element in them\] from Gods to men, and they have the
following to help them from the narratives related.

2\. For instance, the Egyptians tell us that Hermes had a
short-armed <span id="fr_1000"></span>[3](#fn_1001) body, that Typhon
was red-skinned,

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Horus white, and
Osiris black, as though they were \[men\] born in the course of nature.

3\. Moreover, also, they call Osiris “General” and Kanōbus <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[1](#fn_1002) “Pilot,”—from whom, they say, the star
got its name.

And \[they say\] that the ship which Greeks call Argō is an image of the
bark of Osiris, constellated in his honour, and that it sails not far
from Ōriōn and Dog, the former of which Egyptians consider the sacred
\[boat\] of Horus and the latter of Isis. <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[2](#fn_1003)

XXIII\. 1. But I am afraid that this is “moving the immoveable,” and
“warring” not only “against many centuries,” according to
Simōnidēs, <span id="fr_1003"></span>[3](#fn_1004) but “against many
nations of men” and races held fast by religious feeling towards these
Gods—when people let nothing alone but transfer such mighty names from
heaven to earth, and \[so\] banish and dissolve the sense of worship and
faith that has been implanted in nearly all \[men\] from their first
coming into existence, opening up wide entrances for the godless
folk, <span id="fr_1004"></span>[4](#fn_1005) and reducing the divine
\[mysteries\] to the level of men’s doings, and giving a splendid
licence to the charlatanries of Evemerus <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[5](#fn_1006) the Messenian, who of himself
composing the counterpleas of a baseless science of myths unworthy of
any credit, flooded the civilised world with sheer atheism, listing off
level all those who are looked on as gods into names of generals and
admirals and kings, who (he is good enough to say)

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

existed in bygone days, and are recorded in letters of gold at
Panchōn, <span id="fr_1006"></span>[1](#fn_1007)—which \[records\]
neither any non-Greek nor any Greek has ever come across, but Evemerus
alone, when he went his voyage to the Panchoans and Triphyllians, who
never have been nor are anywhere on earth.

XXIV\. 1. And yet mighty deeds of Semiramis are sung of among Assyrians,
and mighty \[deeds\] of Sesōstris in Egypt. And Phrygians even unto this
day call splendid and marvellous doings “manic,” owing to the fact that
Manes, one of their bygone kings, proved himself a good and strong man
among them—the one whom some call Mazdes. <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[2](#fn_1008) Cyrus led Persians and Alexander
Macedonians, conquering to almost the ends of the earth; still they have
the name and memory of good kings \[only\].

2\. “And if some elated by vast boastfulness,” as Plato says, <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[3](#fn_1009) “concomitant with youth and ignorance,
through having their souls inflamed with pride,” have accepted titles
like gods and dedications of temples, their glory has flourished for a
short time \[only\], and afterwards they have incurred the penalty of
vanity and imposture coupled with impiety and indecency: <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[4](#fn_1010)

> <span style="font-size: small">Death coming swift on them, like smoke
> they rose and fell. <span id="fr_1010"></span>[5](#fn_1011)</span>

And now like runaway \[slaves\] that can be lawfully

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

taken, torn from the temples and altars, they have naught but their
tombs and graves.

3\. Wherefore Antigonus the Elder, when a certain Hermodotus, in his
poems, proclaimed him “Son of the Sun and God,” remarked: “My
night-stool boy has not so exalted an opinion of me.”

And with reason also did Lysippus, the sculptor, blame Apelles, the
painter, for putting a thunderbolt in Alexander’s hand when painting his
portrait; whereas he himself gave him a spear-head,—from which not even
time itself shall take away the glory, for it is true and really his.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[295:3](th127.htm#fr_1000) γαλι-άγκωνα—lit.,
weasel-armed. Now, as we are told further on (lxxiv. 3) that the weasel
(γαλῆ), or marten, was fabled to conceive through the ear and bring
forth through the mouth, this animal was evidently a symbol of
mind-conception. “Weasel-armed” may thus symbolise some faculty of the
interpretative mind (Hermes).

<span id="fn_1002"></span>[296:1](th127.htm#fr_1001) Canopus was fabled
to be the pilot of the bark of Osiris; in Greek mythology he was the
pilot of the General Menelaos on his return from Troy.

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[296:2](th127.htm#fr_1002) *Cf.* xxi. 2.

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[296:3](th127.htm#fr_1003) Bergk, iii. 522.

<span id="fn_1005"></span>[296:4](th127.htm#fr_1004) Or “atheists.” “An
evident allusion to the Christians,” says King (*in loc.*); but we think
Plutarch was more impersonal than his commentator.

<span id="fn_1006"></span>[296:5](th127.htm#fr_1005) E. flourished in
the last quarter of the 4th century B.C.

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[297:1](th127.htm#fr_1006) The capital,
presumably, of the mythical island of Panchæa, which was supposed to be
somewhere on the southern coast of Asia, and to which Evemerus pretended
he had sailed on a voyage down the Red Sea.

<span id="fn_1008"></span>[297:2](th127.htm#fr_1007) King notes: “The
common title of the Sassanean kings was ‘Masdesin’—‘servant of Ormazd.’”

<span id="fn_1009"></span>[297:3](th127.htm#fr_1008) *Legg.,* 716 A.

<span id="fn_1010"></span>[297:4](th127.htm#fr_1009) A bold thing to
write in an age of Emperor-divinising.

<span id="fn_1011"></span>[297:5](th127.htm#fr_1010) Apparently from an
otherwise unknown poet. See Bergk, iii. 637.
