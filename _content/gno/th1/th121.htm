<h5 align="center">THE KINGS, THE RIDDLES OF THE PRIESTS, AND THE MEANING OF AMOUN </h5>

<p>IX. 1. The kings were appointed from the priests or from the warriors,&#8212;the one caste possessing worth and honour through manliness, and the other through wisdom. </p>

<p>2. And he who was appointed from the warriors immediately became [one] of the priests and shared in their philosophy,&#8212;which for the most part was hidden in myths and words (<i>logoi</i>), containing dim reflections and transparencies of truth, as, doubtless, they themselves make indirectly plain by fitly setting sphinxes up before the temples, as though their reasoning about the Gods possessed a wisdom wrapped in riddle.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_853"></A><A HREF="#fn_854"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> </p>

<p>3. Indeed, the seat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_854"></A><A HREF="#fn_855"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of Athena (that is Isis, as they think) at Sa&iuml;s used to have the following inscription on it: </p>

<p>&#8220;I am all that has been and is and shall be, and no mortal has ever re-vealed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_855"></A><A HREF="#fn_856"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> my robe.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_856"></A><A HREF="#fn_857"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> </p>

<p>4. Moreover, while the majority think that the proper name of Zeus with the Egyptians is Amoun (which we by a slight change call Amm&#333;n), Maneth&#333;, the Sebennyte, considers it His hidden [one], and that His [power of] hiding is made plain by the very articulation of the sound. </p>

<p>5. Hecat&aelig;us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_857"></A><A HREF="#fn_858"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of Abd&#275;ra, however, says that the Egyptians use this word to one another also when they call one to them, for that its sound has got the power of &#8220;calling to.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_858"></A><A HREF="#fn_859"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> </p>

<p>6. Wherefore when they call to the First God&#8212;who they think is the same for every man&#8212;as unto the Unmanifest and Hidden, invoking Him to make Him manifest and plain to them, they say &#8220;Amoun!&#8221; </p>

<p>So great, then, was the care Egyptians took about the wisdom which concerned the mysteries of the Gods. </p>
