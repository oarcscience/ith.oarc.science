<h5 align="center">THE THEORY OF THE MATHEMATICI </h5>

<p>XLI. 1. Those, however, who combine with the above [considerations] of the Physicists some of the Mathematic [doctrines] derived from star-lore, think that the solar cosmos is called Typhon and the lunar Osiris.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1095"></A><A HREF="#fn_1096"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> </p>

<p>2. For [they think] that the Moon, in that its light is generative and moistening, is favourable both for breedings of animals and sproutings of plants; whereas the Sun, with untempered and harsh fire, burns and </p>


<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="green">p. 319</font></A></p>

<p>withers up [all] that are growing and blowing, and with fiery heat renders the major part of the earth entirely uninhabitable, and in many places utterly masters the Moon. </p>

<p>3. For which cause Egyptians always call Typhon S&#275;th,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1096"></A><A HREF="#fn_1097"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#8212;that is, &#8220;that which oppresses and constrains by force.&#8221; </p>

<p>4. And they have a myth that Heracles is settled in the Sun and accompanies him in his revolutions, while Hermes does the same with the Moon. </p>

<p>5. For the [revolutions] of the Moon resemble works of reason (<i>logos</i>) and super-abundant wisdom, while those of the Sun are like penetrating strokes [given] with force and power.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1097"></A><A HREF="#fn_1098"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> </p>

<p>6. Moreover, the Stoics say that the sun is kept burning and nourished from the sea,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1098"></A><A HREF="#fn_1099"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> whereas to the Moon the waters of springs and lakes send up a sweet and mild exhalation. </p>

<p>XLII. 1. The Egyptian myth runs that the death of Osiris took place on the seventeenth, when the full-moon is most conspicuously at the full. </p>

<p>2. Wherefore the Pythagoreans call this day also &#8220;Interception,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1099"></A><A HREF="#fn_1100"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and regard this number as expiable. </p>

<p>3. For the &#8220;sixteen&#8221; being square and the &#8220;eighteen&#8221; oblong&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1100"></A><A HREF="#fn_1101"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>&#8212;which alone of plane numbers happen to have their perimeters equal to the areas contained by them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1101"></A><A HREF="#fn_1102"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>&#8212;the mean, &#8220;seventeen,&#8221; coming between them, intercepts and divorces them from one another, and divides </p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="green">p. 320</font></A></p>

<p>the ratio of &#8220;nine&#8221; to &#8220;eight&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1102"></A><A HREF="#fn_1103"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> by being cut into unequal intervals. </p>

<p>4. And eight-and-twenty is the number of years which some say Osiris lived, and others that he reigned;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1103"></A><A HREF="#fn_1104"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> for this is the number of the lights of the Moon, and it rolls out its own circle in this number of days. </p>

<p>5. And at what they call the Burials of Osiris they cut the tree-trunk and make it into a crescent-shaped coffin, because the Moon, when it approaches the Sun, becomes crescent-shaped and hides itself away. </p>

<p>6. And the tearing of Osiris into fourteen pieces they refer enigmatically to the days in which the luminary wanes after full-moon up to new-moon. </p>

<p>7. And the day on which it first appears, escaping from his beams and passing by the Sun, they call &#8220;Imperfect Good.&#8221; </p>

<p>8. For Osiris is &#8220;Good-doer.&#8221; The name, indeed, means many things, but chiefly what they call &#8220;Might energising and good-doing.&#8221; And the other name of the God,&#8212;Omphis, Herm&aelig;us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1104"></A><A HREF="#fn_1105"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> says, means [also] when translated, &#8220;Benefactor.&#8221; </p>

<p>XLIII. 1. Moreover, they think that the risings of the Nile have a certain analogy with the lights of the Moon. </p>

<p>2. For the greatest [rising], about Elephantin&#275;, is eight-and-twenty cubits, the same number as are the lights and measures of its monthly periods; and the least, about Mendes and Xo&iuml;s, is of six cubits, [analogous] to the half -moon; while the mean, about Memphis, when it is the right quantity, [is] of fourteen cubits, [analogous] to the full-moon. </p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="green">p. 321</font></A></p>

<p>3. And [they consider] the Apis the animated image of Osiris, and that he is conceived whenever generative light from the Moon fastens on a cow in heat. </p>

<p>4. For which cause also many of the markings of the Apis&#8212;lights shading off into darks&#8212;resemble the configurations of the moon. </p>

<p>5. Moreover, on the new-moon of the month Phamen&#333;th&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1105"></A><A HREF="#fn_1106"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they keep festival, calling it &#8220;Entrance&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1106"></A><A HREF="#fn_1107"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of Osiris into the Moon, as it is the beginning of spring. </p>

<p>6. By thus placing the power of Osiris in the Moon, they mean that Isis consorts with him while being [at the same time] the cause of his birth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1107"></A><A HREF="#fn_1108"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> </p>

<p>7. For which cause also they call the Moon Mother of the cosmos, and think that she has a male-female nature,&#8212;for she is filled by the Sun and made pregnant, and again of herself sends forth and disseminates into the air generative principles. </p>

<p>8. For [they say] she does not always overmaster the destruction wrought by Typhon;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1108"></A><A HREF="#fn_1109"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> but, though frequently mastered, even when bound hand and foot she frees herself again by her generative power, and fights the way through to Horus. </p>

<p>9. And Horus is the cosmos surrounding the earth&#8212;not entirely exempt from destruction either, nor yet from generation. </p>

<p>XLIV. 1. Some, moreover, make out of the myth a riddle of the phenomena of eclipses also. </p>

<p>2. For the Moon is eclipsed at the full, when the Sun has the station opposite it, she entering the shadow of the earth,&#8212;just as they say Osiris [entered] the </p>

<p>

<p><a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="green">p. 322</font></A></p>

<p>coffin. And she again conceals the Sun and causes him to disappear, on the thirtieth [of the month], though she does not entirely destroy him, as neither did Isis Typhon. </p>

<p>3. And when Nephthys conceives Anubis, Isis adopts him. For Nephthys is that which is below the earth and non-manifest, while Isis [is] that which is above the earth and manifest. </p>

<p>4. And the circle just touching them and called &#8220;Horizon,&#8221; as being common to both of them, has been called Anubis, and is likened to a dog for its characteristic; for the dog has the use of its sight both by day and night alike. </p>

<p>5. And Anubis seems to possess this power among Egyptians&#8212;just as Hecate with Greeks&#8212;being at one and the same time chthonian and olympian.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1109"></A><A HREF="#fn_1110"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> </p>

<p>6. Some, however, think that Anubis is Kronos;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1110"></A><A HREF="#fn_1111"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> wherefore as he breeds all things out of himself and conceives (&#954;&#973;&#969;&#957;) [all] in himself, he got the name of Dog (&#954;&#965;&#974;&#957;). </p>

<p>7. There is, then, for the worshippers of Anubis some [mystery] or other that may not be spoken of.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1111"></A><A HREF="#fn_1112"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> </p>

<p>8. In olden times, indeed, the dog enjoyed the highest honours in Egypt; but seeing that when Cambyses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1112"></A><A HREF="#fn_1113"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> slew the Apis and cast it out, no [animal] approached or touched its carcase but only the dog, he [thus] lost the [distinction of] being first and most honoured of the rest of the animals. </p>

<p>9. There are some, however, who call the shadow of the earth into which they think the Moon falls and is eclipsed, Typhon. </p>
