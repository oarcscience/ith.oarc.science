##### THE UNDER-MEANING A REFLEXION OF A CERTAIN REASON

XX\. I. These are approximately the chief headings of their myth, after
the most ill-omened have been removed,—such as, for instance, the one
about the cutting up into pieces of Horus, and the beheading of Isis.

2\. That, however, if people suppose and say these things about that
Blessed and Incorruptible Nature according to which especially the
Divine conceives itself, as though they were actually enacted and really
took place, “thou shouldst spit out and cleanse mouth,” according to
Æschylus, <span id="fr_988"></span>[6](#fn_989) there is no need to tell
thee; <span id="fr_989"></span>[7](#fn_990) for of thyself thou showest
displeasure at those who hold illegitimate and barbarous notions about
the Gods.

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

3\. But that these things are not at all like lean tales and quite empty
figments, such as poets and prose-writers weave and expand as though
they were spiders spinning them out of themselves from a source that has
no basis in fact, but that they contain certain informations and
statements,—thou knowest of thyself.

4\. And just as the Mathematici <span id="fr_990"></span>[1](#fn_991)
say that “Iris” <span id="fr_991"></span>[2](#fn_992) is the sun’s
reflexion many-coloured by the return of its visual impression to the
cloud, so the myth down here is a reflexion of a certain reason
(*logos*) that bends its thinking back on other things; as both the
sacred offerings suggest by the reflected element of mournfulness and
sadness they contain, and also the dispositions of the temples which in
one direction open out into side-walks and courts for moving about in,
open to the sky and clear of objects, while in the other they have
hidden and dark robing-rooms under ground, like places for putting
coffins in and burying-spots.
