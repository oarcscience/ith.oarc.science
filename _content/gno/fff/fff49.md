*Fragments of a Faith Forgotten*, by G.R.S. Mead, \[1900\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### vii. A very doubtful Fragment from Eulogius of Alexandria writing at the end of the Sixth Century.

<span class="margnote">The Galileans.</span>If this fragment can be
accepted as genuine, we learn that the early Christians, whom Valentinus
calls "the Galileans of the time of Christ," believed in the doctrine of
two natures, whereas the Valentinians asserted that there was but one.
This is quite credible, following on the lines of argument of Isidorus
concerning the unit consciousness of the soul and its responsibility,
and the teaching of Valentinus that Jesus "worked out" his own divinity.
