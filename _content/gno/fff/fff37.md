### CERDO.

<span class="margnote">The Master of Marcion.</span>LET us now return to
the historical twilight of the second century, and turn our attention to
the great Basilidian and Valentinian developments. But before doing so,
it will be convenient to give a brief sketch of the great and
contemporaneous Marcionite movement, which at one time threatened to
absorb the whole of Christendom. The method of this school was the
direct prototype of the method of modern criticism. Its conclusions,
however, were far more sweeping; for it not only rejected the Old
Testament entirely, but also the whole of the documents of the "in order
that it might be fulfilled" school of Gospel-compilation.

The predecessor of Marcion is said to have been a certain Cerdo, of
Syrian extraction, who flourished at Rome about 135 <span
class="small">A.D.</span> But the fame of Marcion so eclipsed the name
of his preceptor, that Patristic writers frequently confuse not only
their teachings but even the men themselves. It is interesting to note
that, though Cerdo's relationship with the Church of Rome was unsettled,
no distinct sentence of

excommunication is recorded against him; it would, therefore, appear
that the idea of a rigid canon of orthodoxy was not yet developed even
in the exclusive mind of the Roman presbytery. It was no doubt the
success of Marcion that precipitated the formulation of the idea of the
canon in the mind of the Roman church, the pioneer of subsequent
orthodoxy.
