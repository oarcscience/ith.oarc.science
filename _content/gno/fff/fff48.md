#### vi. From the Letter on the Community of Friends.

<span class="margnote">Concerning the People of the Beloved.</span>"Many
of these things which are written in the public volumes, are found
written in the Church of God. For those teachings which are common, are
the words which proceed from the heart, the law written in the heart.
This is the People of the Beloved who are loved by and love Him."

Clement assumes that Valentinus means by "public volumes" the Jewish
writings and the books of the philosophers.

The "public volumes," however, for Valentinus included not only the
works of the philosophers and the scriptures of the Jews, but also the
scriptures of all other religions, and also the Christian documents in
general circulation. He merely asserts that the only "common" or general
truths are those pertaining to the Community of Friends, or Saints, who
form the Church of God, the People of the Beloved. These truths come
from the heart; he protests against the narrow view that can find truth
in only one set of

scriptures; and declares it is in all scriptures and philosophies, if
one looks to the spirit and not the letter.
