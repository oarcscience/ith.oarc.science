### iv. From a Homily.

"From the very beginning have ye been immortal and children of
life--such life as the æons enjoy;<span class="margnote">Ye are the Sons
of God.</span> yet would ye have death shared up among you, to spend and
lavish it, so that death might die in you and by your hands; for
inasmuch as ye dissolve the world and are not dissolved yourselves, ye
are lords of all creation and destruction."

Here we have the burden of the teaching in one of the treatises of the
Codex Brucianus--to crucify the world and not let the world crucify
us--and of the *Pistis Sophia* treatise, "Know ye not that ye are all
gods and lords?" The Self within the heart, the seed of the divine, the
pneumatic light-spark, the dweller in light, the inner man, was the
eternal pilgrim incarnated in matter; those who had this alive and
conscious within them were the spiritual or pneumatic. To such
Valentinus is speaking.
