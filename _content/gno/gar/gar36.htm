<p>The most remarkable specimen of the class known to me was obtained (Jan. 1876) from Sambon, a noted <i>antiquario</i> at Naples. It is a circular bronze disc, 2&frac34; inches (the ancient <i>palmus</i>) in diameter, with a small projection to top, perforated for suspension. The surface of the obverse bears a genuine patina, and the characters of the legend have the true antique formation; but, for reasons hereafter to be stated, the reverse strikes me as an addition of later times--not, indeed, a forgery to entrap the antiquarian, but something intended in all good faith to augment the virtues of the original talisman.</p>  
<p>The Abraxas-god, advancing to the right, with arms extended crucifix fashion, holding sword and shield, above his head and arms,</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The whole inclosed within a coiled serpent.</p>  
<p>Reverse: King with hand on breast, seated on throne, seen in front-face. Over his head,</p>

<IMG SRC="img/24900.jpg"></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> This Solomon is a truly medi&aelig;val piece of drawing; the lettering, too, evidently differs from that of the obverse; and as the surface of the plate is fresher on this side, it is probable that the whole has been added upon the empty back of the original plate.</p>  
<p>Some legends, following the rule of the famous <b>&#0913;&#0914;&#0923;&#0913;&#0920;&#0913;&#0925;&#0913;&#0923;&#0913;&#0914;&#0913;</b>, read indifferently from either end. A good example occurs on the reverse of a serapis, carried in the <i>baris</i> between Sol and Luna.</p>

<p>Horus seated in the <i>baris;</i> on prow and poop are perched the sacred birds; neatly engraved on dark-green jasper (Pliny's Molochites). On the reverse--</p>

<p>Amongst the various contents of a tomb at Saintes, discovered in 1885, was a <i>metal</i> ring set with a heliotrope engraved with the Agathod&aelig;mon, furnished with a human trunk, standing. On the reverse a novel formula--</p>

<IMG SRC="img/24903.jpg"></p>  
<p><i>Ruchael</i>, "Spirit of God," is known as the name of an angel; but the other words defy interpretation.</p>  
<p>The best executed of such talismans known to me, belongs to Mr. Webb Ware, of Cork. It is an elliptical sard, about 1&frac34; inches long and wide; engraved very neatly, with Serapis</p>  
<p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="green">p. 250</font></A></p>  
<p>seated on the Baris, busts of Osiris and Isis on prow and poop; above, <b>&#0913;&#0923;&#0916;&#0913;</b>; below, <b>&#0914;&#0913;&#0921;&#0925;</b>. On the reverse, finely cut--</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_25000"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/25000.jpg"></p>  
<p>There is no distinction between <b>&#0913;</b> and <b>&#0923;</b> in the original, but I have made it where clearly required. The <b>&#0913;&#0923;&#0916;&#0913;</b> is a novelty; but many words in the long formula are of common occurrence in other gems.</p>
