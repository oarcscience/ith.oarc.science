<p>THE inscriptions in Greek characters upon Gnostic talismans are frequently interspersed with mystic figures, formed out of straight lines set at right angles to each other, and intermingled with dots. These lines Bellermann plausibly enough supposes to represent the "sacred lots," of the same nature as the celebrated <i>sortes Antiates</i>, held in the hands of the much-consulted Fortuna of Antium. In their usual form these lots were only little sticks and balls, taken up by the handful from an urn, and thrown at random on the ground. The diviner examined the patterns thus produced by their casual collocation, and predicted the future from them according to the rules of his art. Bellermann goes on to suppose that the figures on our talismans represent certain configurations of the lots, regarded as peculiarly lucky to the consulter. This explanation is supported by the Geomancy of the modern Arabs,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> where lines drawn at haphazard on the sand by a stick held between the fingers are interpreted by persons professing that method of divination. Our own divination, by means of tea-grounds, is carried on upon the same principle, the fortuitous arrangement of the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></A></p>  
<p>particles producing to the experienced eye definite pictures and letters of the alphabet.</p>  
<p>These Sigl&aelig;, however, may possibly have had another origin. The regular badge of the <i>Magus</i>, as prescribed in the Vendidad, is a bundle of divining-rods--three, seven, or nine in number. Hence the rebuke of Hosea: "My people ask counsel of <i>sticks</i>, and their <i>staff</i> declareth it unto them." These same divining-rods placed upon the altar are commonly represented upon the Magian signets, bearing for official type the Mobed at his devotions; and may therefore be supposed to have passed down to the talisman-makers of later times.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>That others amongst these angular forms are numerals is certain from the nature of the case, and from Horapollo's express declaration that the Egyptians represented 10 by the figure <A NAME="img_30600"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/30600.jpg">, and 100 by the same four times repeated in the form of a square, thus <A NAME="img_30601"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/30601.jpg">. <i>Ten</i> being the "perfect number" of the Valentinian creed (whose fountain-head was Alexandria), its frequent appearance amongst the religious formul&aelig; of the sect is naturally to be looked for. The primitive Egyptian numerals were of the simplest kind, but their abbreviated combinations ultimately became distinct symbols for the different days of the month, and out of these the Arab astrologers concocted their own system. This circumstance affords reason for another solution--that some of these sigl&aelig; indicate the particular days connected with the astrological intention of the talisman.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>And besides all these, there is every probability that these sigl&aelig; include actual cuneiform letters, belonging to the Assyrian alphabet, but their forms somewhat corrupted by the semi-</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Greek wizard, who employed them in ignorance of their true nature. The Assyrian language being considered as late as the times of Iamblichus peculiarly grateful to the heavenly Powers, what more reasonable than that some at least of these invocations should continue to be couched in their original cyphers? Be it remembered, the cuneiform character was the national one of the whole Persian empire down to the Macedonian conquest, and must have been preserved in religious usages long after that event by the Magi. They, at least, were a very unlikely class to trouble themselves about the Greek alphabet or Greek literature, professing, like the Talmudists, a pious horror for both. This is well exemplified on the restoration of the native dynasty under the Sassanians; Greek, employed for four centuries by the Parthian line, is at once expelled from the coins by the Pehlevi character, true daughter of the primitive cuneiform. There is moreover one all-sufficient reason for seeking the origin of these inexplicable sigl&aelig; at Babylon: they constituted a religious stenography. The Babylonians "attached to each god a certain <i>numeral</i>, which may be used in the place of his proper <i>emblem</i>, and may even stand for his <i>name</i> in an inscription" (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Monarchies,' iii., 466). To give those of the principal deities:</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">First Triad: Ann = 60; Bel = 50; Hoa = 40.<br> Second Triad: Moon = 30; Sun = 20; Air = 10.<br> Beltis, or Mylitta = 15; Nergal, or Mars = 12; Niu, or Saturn = 10.</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Of the other planets the numerals have not been discovered; but their names are, Nebo, Mercury: Merodach, Jupiter; Ishtar, Venus.</p>  
<p>The great gods are Anu, <i>Pluto;</i> Bel, <i>Jupiter</i>; Hoa, <i>Neptune</i>. Their consorts are, respectively, Anat, Beltis, Davkana. The minor gods are, Sin, or Hurke, answering to the later Lunus Deus; San, the Sun; Vid, the &AElig;ther. Their respective consorts are, "The Great Lady "; Gula, or Anahit; Tula, or Shula. The Pythagoreans had a symbolism of the same nature, denoting Minerva by an <i>equilateral triangle</i>, Apollo by <i>unity</i>; Strife, by the numeral <i>two;</i> Justice, by <i>three</i>, and the Supreme Being by <i>four</i> (Plat. De Is. et Os. 75).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> I find a very strong confirmation</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="green">p. 308</font></A></p>  
<p>of my belief that the Gnostic <i>Powers</i> were similarly designated by their numerals, in Raspe's gem, No. 601, where <b>&#0067;&#0917;&#0925;&#0915;&#0917;&#0925;</b> is inscribed in the exergue under a serpent coiled into a cartouche containing several of the sigl&aelig; under consideration. Now this legend (to be explained farther on) is, when written in full, always followed by the names of the Archangels, whence it may justly be inferred the same names are still here, but represented in their mystic form.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"The Great Names" constitute the very essence of every Gnostic spell. To begin, therefore, with their consideration is obviously the most appropriate and propitious mode of approaching this part of our work--pandere res alta terra et caligine mersas. There are three titles perpetually occurring, and consequently to be supposed denoting beings of the highest importance in the Gnostic hierarchy of heaven. Their meaning was unknown until the fortunate discovery of the grand Valentinian gospels. The Pistis-Sophia informed us (&sect; 361) that they are the holy Names of the Three &#0932;&#0961;&#0953;&#0948;&#8059;&#0957;&#0945;&#0956;&#0949;&#0953;&#0962;, who are <b>&#0921;&#0936;&#0913;&#0925;&#0932;&#0913;&#0935;&#0913;&#0921;&#0925;&#0935;&#0917;&#0927;&#0978;&#0935;</b>, a Power emanating from whom resides in the planet Mars; <b>&#0914;&#0913;&#0921;&#0925;&#0935;&#0937;&#0937;&#0935;</b>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> in Mercury; and <b>&#0928;&#0921;&#0067;&#0932;&#0921;&#0067; &#0067;&#0927;&#0934;&#0921;&#0913;</b>, in Venus. Above this Triad is one still higher, the "Three Unseen Gods," <b>&#0913;&#0915;&#0929;&#0913;&#0924;&#0924;&#0913;&#0935;&#0913;&#0924;&#0913;&#0929;&#0917;&#0915;</b>, <b>&#0914;&#0913;&#0929;&#0914;&#0919;&#0923;&#0937;</b> (the Heavenly Mother of Jesus), and <b>&#0914;&#0916;&#0917;&#0923;&#0923;&#0919;</b> (&sect; 359).</p>

The same revelation furthermore imparts to the faithful the mystic names of the planets. "Hearken now, I will tell unto you the Incorruptible Names of the Planets, which be <b>&#0937;&#0929;&#0921;&#0924;&#0927;&#0978;&#0920;</b>, Saturn; <b>&#0924;&#0927;&#0978;&#0925;&#0921;&#0935;&#0927;&#0978;&#0913;&#0934;&#0937;&#0929;</b>, Mars; <b>&#0932;&#0913;&#0929;&#0928;&#0917;&#0932;&#0913;&#0925;&#0927;&#0978;&#0934;</b>, Mercury; <b>&#0935;&#0937;&#0931;&#0921;</b>, Venus; <b>&#0935;&#0937;&#0925;&#0914;&#0913;&#0923;</b>, Jupiter. These be the incorruptible names of the same" (&sect; 362). Of these, the names from each Triad are to be recognised upon talismans, <b>&#0914;&#0913;&#0921;&#0925;&#0935;&#0937;&#0937;&#0937;&#0935;</b> most commonly of all; but no example of these planetary appellations has hitherto come to my knowledge.</p>  
<p>The Naaseni (says Hippolytus) taught that the universe could not hold together unless the names of the Great Ones (&#0964;&#8048; &#0956;&#0949;&#0947;&#8051;&#0952;&#0951;) were uttered. These were <b>&#0922;&#0913;&#0978;&#0913;&#0922;&#0913;&#0978;</b>, <b>&#0931;&#0913;&#0978;&#0913;&#0913;&#0931;&#0913;&#0978;</b>, <b>&#0918;&#0917;&#0919;&#0931;&#0913;&#0929;</b>. "The first is the name of the Adamas who is above; the second, of him who is below; the third of the Jordan that floweth upwards." "Above are Mariamne the Sought-after, and Jothor the great and wise; and Sephora she that seeth; and Moses." According to the text-book of another sect, the Perat&aelig;, <b>&#0935;&#0937;&#0918;&#0918;&#0913;&#0929;</b> is the Power whom the ignorant and profane call Neptune: <b>&#0922;&#0913;&#0929;&#0934;&#0913;&#0922;&#0927;&#0931;&#0919;&#0924;&#0927;&#0935;&#0917;&#0929;</b> is the Steward of the East: <b>&#0917;&#0922;&#0922;&#0913;&#0914;&#0913;&#0922;&#0913;&#0929;&#0913;</b> of the West; called by the vulgar the Curetes. <b>&#0913;&#0929;&#0921;&#0914;&#0913;</b> is the Ruler of the Winds; <b>&#0931;&#0937;&#0922;&#0923;&#0913;&#0924;</b>, or Osiris, rules the twelve hours of the night; <b>&#0917;&#0925;&#0978;&#0937;</b>, or Isis, those of the day: her sign is the Dog-star. <b>&#0914;&#0919;&#0925;&#0913;</b> is Ceres, or the Left-hand Power of God, presiding over nutrition; <b>&#0924;&#0919;&#0925;</b> is the Right-hand Power that presides over the fruits of the earth. In the same doctrine, <i>chozzar</i>, called by the ignorant Neptune, "who converts into a sphere the dodecagonal pyramid, and paints with many colours the gate of that pyramid," has Five Ministers, <b>&#0913;&#0927;&#0978;</b>, <b>&#0913;&#0927;&#0913;&#0921;</b>, <b>&#0927;&#0978;&#0937;</b>, <b>&#0927;&#0978;&#0937;&#0913;&#0914;</b>; the name of the fifth being lost. Hence it is probable that the strings of vowels, so often found on these stones, may contain the names of elementary genii similarly expressed.</p>  
<p>Origen (viii. 58) quotes Celsus to the effect, that the Egyptians made six-and-thirty (or more) d&aelig;mons or &aelig;therial powers preside over the several parts of the body, giving some of their names, Chumis, Chuachumes, Knat, Sichat, Bou, Erou, Eribiou,</p>  
<p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Romanor, and Reianoor: "Whoever therefore prefers being in health to sickness, and happiness to trouble, ought to pay all possible honour to these Powers." Origen therefore accuses Celsus of attempting to divert men from the worship of the one God to that of six-and-thirty d&aelig;mons, only known to Egyptian magicians, because he cannot understand how "the Name of Jesus, pronounced by the truly faithful," can cure the sick and those possessed by devils; the evidence for which is far stronger than that of the effect of the names of Chnumis, Sichat, and the rest of the Egyptian catalogue. In another place (i. 22) he shows it was not Moses only that knew the name of Abraham and his friendship with God, for that others (pagans) use the words "the God of Abraham" when they are driving out devils. And again the Egyptians use in their rites, from which they promise wonderful effects, the names of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Israel. Also (iv. 33) Origen mentions the use of the form "The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob" in incantations, and that the same is often to be met with in books of Magic. He adds that the formula "The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, who didst overwhelm the Egyptians and the King of the Egyptians in the Red Sea," was in common use against demons and the Powers of Evil. All this goes to prove that the talismans inscribed with the name of Chnumis and the other thirty-five d&aelig;mons named (who now by this assistance may be hereafter recognised) were of a <i>medicinal</i> character, whereas those with "Abraham," equally common, were more properly of the nature of talismans.</p>  
<p>In the Book of Enoch the Archangel Uriel gives us the mystic names of the two great luminaries: "The names of the Sun are these, one Aryares, the other Tomas. The Moon hath <i>four</i> names: the first, Asonga; the second, Ebla; the third, Benase; and the fourth, Erai."</p>  
<p>The Pistis-Sophia (&sect; 125) furnishes the adept with the key to the most important of the numerical cyphers. "These be the Names that I will give unto thee, even from the Infinite One downwards. Write them with a sign (cypher?) that the sons of God may manifest (understand?) them out of this place. This is the Name of the Immortal One, <b>&#0913;&#0913;&#0913; &#0937;&#0937;&#0937;</b>. And this</p>  
<p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="green">p. 311</font></A></p>  
<p>is the name of the Voice through whose means the Perfect Man is moved, <b>&#8153;&#8153;&#8153;</b> These likewise are the <i>interpretations</i> of the names of the Mysteries. The first is <b>&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;</b>, the interpretation thereof <b>&#0934;&#0934;&#0934;</b>. The second which is <b>&#0924;&#0924;&#0924;</b>, or which is <b>&#0937;&#0937;&#0937;</b>; the interpretation whereof is <b>&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;</b>. The third is <b>&#0936;&#0936;&#0936;</b>, the interpretation whereof is <b>&#0927;&#0927;&#0927;</b>. The fourth is <b>&#0934;&#0934;&#0934;</b>, the interpretation whereof is <b>&#0925;&#0925;&#0925;</b>. The fifth is <b>&#0916;&#0916;&#0916;</b>, the interpretation whereof is <b>&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;</b>, the which is over the throne <b>&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;</b>. This is the interpretation of the second <b>&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;</b>, which is <b>&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;&#0913;</b>, and the same is the interpretation of the whole Name."</p>  
<p>To pass from the cyphers, where all is guess work, to the actual inscriptions, engraved legibly enough in the Greek character, but presenting us with what Jerome aptly terms mere "tormenta verborum." Many of the more common formula, Bellermann, by the aid of Hebrew, Coptic, and Syriac,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> has satisfactorily explained; of others his interpretations are manifestly absurd. <b>&#0913;&#0924;&#0913;&#0929;&#0915;&#0917;&#0913;</b> seems to be the Chaldee <i>Amarchel</i>, a president. <b>&#0913;&#0925;&#0927;&#0935; &#0935;&#0927;&#0923; &#0935;&#0925;&#0927;&#0978;&#0914;&#0921;&#0067;</b>, "I am All the Good Spirit, or the Universal genius of good." <b>&#0913;&#0921;&#0925; &#0920;&#0913;&#0929;&#0929;&#0913;&#0921;</b>, "The eye shall. behold." <b>&#0913;&#0916;&#0927;&#0925;&#0913;&#0921; &#0923;&#0913;&#0925;&#0932;&#0913;&#0923;&#0913;</b>, "Lord!

<p>the benediction pronounced by the Marcosians in administering the holy unction, "Peace be unto all upon whom this holy Name rests!"</p>  
<p>Some of these inscriptions display an evident affectation of obscurity by their transposition of parts of the same word front one line to another, the only key to which is the observing the different sizes of the characters employed, and taking those of the same size as belonging to the "disjecta membra" of the same word. A most instructive example of this artifice is supplied by the legend cut on the reverse of a magnificent Serapis head (Wood), which reads thus:</p>

<p>real meaning of the words. Bellermann, however, thinks he has found a more sensible derivation for the title in Arabic, signifying "Strength upon strength," that is, the "All-powerful"; or else in the Coptic <b>&#0922;&#0913;&#0914;</b>, "a lamp," and so implying "The burning and the shining Light."</p>  
<p><b>&#0924;&#0927;&#0978;&#0920;</b>, "Mother," Plutarch informs us (De Is. et Os.), was a title given to Isis. This word contains a plain allusion to the earth, "lutum Prometheum," whence Man was taken. <b>&#0924;&#0927;&#0978;&#0920;</b> and <b>&#0921;&#0917;&#0927;&#0978;&#0916;</b> are translated by Sanconiathon as "Hades" and "Only-begotten," the offspring of the Ph&#339;nician Cronos.</p>

<p>Three Greek characters often occur in juxtaposition--viz., the <b>&#0917;</b> set on its back, a vertical line crossed by two horizontal strokes, and <b>&#0918;</b>. They stand for the numerals 5, 3, and 7, the Triad, Pentad, Heptad--lucky and sacred numbers in the religious notions of the East. For the same reason the inscriptions on our gems will be found to be arranged for the most part in either three, five, or seven lines. This also accounts for the name Iao being often written with its elements repeated</p>

And, again, by introducing another vowel, <b>&#0919;</b>, the Holy Name is repeated under five different forms, <b>&#0919;&#0913;&#0921; . &#0913;&#0921;&#0919; . &#0919;&#0921;&#0937; . &#0913;&#0921;&#0937; . &#0921;&#0913;&#0937;</b>.</p>  
<p>The <i>Priest</i> officiating, commonly figured in these designs, wears upon his head the "calantica," a square of purple cloth whence spring two flamingo feathers; a badge which made &#0960;&#0964;&#0949;&#0961;&#8057;&#0966;&#0959;&#0961;&#0959;&#0962; a synonym for the Egyptian priesthood. The staff in his hand, emblem of his office, has the serpent coiled <i>five</i> times about it. This "sceptrum sacerdotale" furnishes the true explanation of the meaning of many ancient insignia, beginning with Moses&#8217; wand, then the club of &AElig;sculapius, and closing with its derivative the rod in the spiral of <b>SSS</b> that so constantly goes with the Agathod&aelig;mon serpent upon the Chnuphis gems.</p>  
<p>As for the <i>geometrical figures</i> so often introduced, they may be supposed to have had much the same import here as in the formul&aelig; of the Rosicrucians, who obtained these with other Gnostic paraphernalia probably by tradition from the Arabs; for their pretended founder, the Great Unknown <b>A. S.</b>, is declared to have acquired his small learning at the College of Damascus. In their system the Square stands for the Four Elements; the Triangle for the body, the spirit, and the life: and also for Sun, Moon, and Mercury. The last Triad Paracelsus interprets by <i>salt</i>, <i>sulphur</i>, <i>quicksilver</i>--the three radical forces of Nature according to his system. The <i>Rhombus</i> represents the Orphic Egg, out of which issued the whole Creation.</p>  
<p><i>Ph&#339;nician Numerals</i> may, from the very nature of the case, be looked for amongst the marks that cannot be referred to the Greek alphabet. The notation was simplicity itself: <i>one</i> to <i>nine</i> being expressed by vertical strokes, so many times repeated; <i>ten</i> by a horizontal one; <i>twenty</i> by two such parallel to each other, sometimes slightly curving together. In the</p>

<p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Palmyrene notation <i>five</i> has a special cypher, a sloping line upon which in the middle stands another at right angles.</p>  
<p>It was to be expected that Samaritan characters should make their appearance upon the productions of a religion of which the reputed founder was a Samaritan, whose professed followers also formed an important sect as late as the times of Hippolytus. Stiechel interprets the reverse legend on his above-quoted gem as having its commencing words written in this alphabet: thus</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_31600"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/31600.jpg" ALT="qui tenet. / signum sat. / ejus sanat. / exorcista corpus. / facultates. / et vitam. / fiat! fiat!"></p>  
<p>He also points out that the important word "Auth"=<i>sign</i> or token, is written in these legends in four different ways: <b>&#0920;&#0086;&#0927;</b>, <b>&#0917;&#0086;&#0927;</b>, <b>&#0917;&#0921;W</b>, <b>&#0086;&#0921;&#0917;</b>.</p>  
<p>It is possible that in certain legends the letters, taken in an order known to one having the key, would give a definite meaning; and this suspicion is supported by the reversing of some of the characters. Certain it is that the Donatists adopted such a device in order to disguise their proscribed war-cry from the victorious Catholics. A door-lintel at Tebessa exhibits the well-known formula thus--</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_31601"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/31601.jpg"></p>  
<p>to be read by the brethren "Deo laudes dicamus." A second lintel bears the same in monogram.</p>  
<p>The most famous spell of all, <b>ABRACADABRA</b>, is first mentioned by Serenus Sammonicus, the most learned Roman of his times, and physician to Caracalla, to whom he dedicated his poetical 'Guide to Health,' entitled 'De Medicina pr&aelig;cepta saluberrima.' This work, remarks Spartian, was the favourite study of the unfortunate C&aelig;sar, Geta, for attachment to whose cause this true son of Apollo was afterwards put to death by the imperial fratricide. Severus Alexander also, "who had known and loved Serenus," greatly admired his poetry, putting</p>  
<p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="green">p. 317</font></A></p>  
<p>him on a level with Horace, as Lampridius&#8217; expressions seem to intimate. This high authority orders the word to be written out in the form of an inverted cone, and declares it of virtue against all diseases.</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Thou shalt on paper write the spell divine,<br> Abracadabra called, in many a line;<br> Each under each in even order place,<br> But the last letter in each line efface.<br> As by degrees the elements grow few<br> Still take away, but fix the residue,<br> Till at the last one letter stands alone<br> And the whole dwindles to a tapering cone.<br> Tie this about the neck with flaxen string;<br> Mighty the good &#8217;twill to the patient bring.<br> Its wondrous potency shall guard his head--<br> And drive disease and death far from his bed."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>The belief in the virtue of this recipe flourished through the Middle Ages. It seems alluded to in the 'Dialogue on Masonry,' ascribed by Leland to Henry VI.; for amongst "the things that Masons conceal" is "the winnynge of the facultye of <i>Abrac</i>"<i>:</i> perhaps signifying the possession of this mystical arrangement of letters: unless, indeed, one chooses to suspect in this "facultye" a deeper sense, some traditionary knowledge of the ancient Abraxas religion. Again, De Foe mentions how people commonly wore the word written in the manner above prescribed, as a safeguard against infection during the Great Plague of London.</p>  
<p>As for the etymology of the word, the most satisfactory yet offered is the compound of the Hebrew <i>Ha-Brachah</i>, "blessing," and Dobara, "speak"; meaning the "Blessing of the Mystic Name"--that is, utter the Tetragrammaton, invoke the Holy Name of Jehovah, itself the mightiest of charms.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>It is very remarkable, considering its high repute, that no Gnostic stone bearing such an inscription should be known to exist. On the other hand that normal address to Iao, <b>&#0913;&#0914;&#0923;&#0913;&#0925;&#0920;&#0913;&#0913;&#0923;&#0914;&#0913;</b>, "Thou art our Father!" is so found on talismanic jaspers arranged in the exact pattern recommended by</p>

<p><a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="green">p. 318</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Serenus for the paper spell, and probably so done in compliance with his directions. One is strongly tempted to discover in this same <i>Ha-Brachah</i> the real origin of the equally famous title "Abraxas." The Greek letters, constantly in use for numerals, at once presented their numeric value in every word to the practised eye of the Kabalist.</p>  
<p>The celebrated letter of Christ to Abgarus was (according to Cedrenus) sealed with the initials of the seven Hebrew words, whose Greek interpretation was &#0920;&#0949;&#8056;&#0962; &#0920;&#0949;&#0959;&#0952;&#8050;&#0957; &#0952;&#0945;&#8166;&#0956;&#0945; &#0952;&#0949;&#8150;&#0959;&#0957;. At the mere sight of the seal the king was healed of his gout and of his blade leprosy, all but a slight trace upon the face remaining to be cleansed by the waters of baptism. Cedrenus' Greek reads like a popular formula, and may serve to explain the legend on the reverse of an Abraxas gem in my possession, <b>&#0921;&#0935;&#0920;&#0917;&#0920;&#0937;&#0919;&#0921;&#0913;&#0921;&#0913;&#0937;</b>, as to be read &#7992;&#0951;&#0963;&#0959;&#8166;&#0962; &#0935;&#0961;&#0953;&#0963;&#0964;&#8056;&#0963; &#0920;&#0949;&#8056;&#0962; &#7952;&#0954; &#0920;&#0949;&#0959;&#8166; &#0921;&#0945;&#8060;, "Jesus Christ, God of God, Jehovah." This inscription encloses the letters <b>&#0921;&#0919;</b> placed conspicuously in 'the centre, and which probably represent, as nearly as the two discordant alphabets allow, the Hebrew letters <i>Jod</i>, <i>He</i>, the Kabalistic name of the <i>Tikkan</i>, "Express Image," or First Emanation of the Godhead.</p>  
<p>The Crescent and Seven Stars, amongst which are scattered the mystical Seven Vowels, has for reverse this formula:--</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_31800"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/31800.jpg"></p>  
<p>Its first line, but written &#0913;&#0935;&#0920;&#0921;&#0937;&#0934;&#0921;, is cut in beautiful characters on the reverse of a caduceus within a wreath. Sinker reads it as &#8207;&#1506;&#1511;&#1512; &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#8206;, <i>Essence</i>, <i>Beauty:</i> probably the rest are names of virtues. It is inconceivable that the Sephiroth--mightiest spell of all--should be omitted in these gems. It is made up of the <i>Ten</i> attributes of Jehovah--viz., The Crown, Wisdom, Prudence, Security, Magnificence, Goodness, Glory, Victory, Fortitude, Kingdom. There is consequently a probability that these Names often lurk in the phonetic Hebrew, enveloping all in darkness. We have for guide the analogy of the present Arab talismans, consisting of the ninety-nine epithets of Allah written on a scroll.</p>
