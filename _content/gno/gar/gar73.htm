<p>1. Abraxas brandishing a whip, to scare away malignant influences, his shield emblazoned with some word of power. Reverse, the usual Greek transliteration of the Hebrew name of God.</p>  
<p>2. Abraxas, armed with a sword; the exceptionally neat execution of the intaglio bespeaks the first days of the religion.</p>  
<p>3. Abraxas, wielding a <i>mace</i>, a Persian weapon that betrays the Asiatic origin of this particular design; the <i>thunderbolt</i> in the field identifies this Power with the classic Jupiter. The reverse exhibits the Triple Hecate, Queen of Hell, brandishing various weapons for the same prophylactic purpose as the god himself. A unique combination of ideas, engraved upon a circular copper plaque, found in the south of France.</p>  
<p>4. The Agathod&aelig;mon Serpent, with radiated head, identified by the legend with the god Abraxas. One of the few types that can with confidence be attributed to the sect of Ophites.</p>  
<p>5. Abraxas, of very debased and late execution. The title "<i>Sabaoth</i>" on the reverse, properly signifying "of hosts," was mistaken by the ignorant Hellenists for the actual <i>name</i> of a Power, by translating "Lord of Hosts" as "the Lord Sabaoth." Under this title he figures largely in the sigillum of the "Pistis-Sophia."</p>
