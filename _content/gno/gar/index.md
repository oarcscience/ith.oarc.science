In the mid-19th century, eighty years before the chance discovery of a
treasure trove of Gnostic manuscripts in a dump in Egypt, C.W. King
collected what was known about the Gnostics in this book. At that time
there were only three sources of information on Gnosticism: polemics
against them by [early Christian writers](../../chr/ecf/index), the
*[Pistis Sophia](../../chr/ps/index)*, and a jumble of confusing images
and cryptic inscriptions on Roman-era gems and amulets.

In spite of all of the missing jigsaw pieces, King managed to assemble a
picture of the Gnostics which is still cited today as authoritative.
Rather than one monolithic group, the Gnostics had very diverse beliefs.
Some thought that Jesus was a man, while others thought that he was a
God, and some believed that he became a God only after he was baptized.
Some believed in a struggle between good and evil, others were
non-dualistic. Most had widely-varying intricate systems of
intermediaries between the ultimate deity and humanity. On the face of
it, this looks polytheistic, but instead was an attempt to solve the
problem of how a perfect God could create an imperfect world. Many of
these *Aeons* later became the demons and angels of Medieval and
Renaissance magic.

King seeks links to Gnostic symbols and beliefs far afield, from India,
to the Templars, Rosicrucians and Illuminati. He discusses Mithra and
Serapis worship, and gives many examples of Roman and Greek magical
spells and talismans. He discusses the fudged birthdate of Jesus,
Masons' marks, and Simon Magus. The book is a fascinating tour of hidden
knowledge.

Production Notes: This text uses Unicode extensively, so you should
consult the sacred-texts [Unicode help page](../../unicode) if the Greek
and Hebrew text in this text is not displayed correctly in your browser.
There are many quotations of Greek and Latin text from inscriptions. In
some cases I have silently replaced rare forms of some greek letters
(particularly uppercase omega) with the more common ones. In the final
part of the book, there were no sub-sections. To break up this long part
of the book into files, I have inserted logical sub-section headings. As
usual, these are in green type.
