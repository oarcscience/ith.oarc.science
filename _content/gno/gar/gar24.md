### II. THE PROBABLE ORIGIN OF SERAPIS.

The ancient speculations cited in the preceding chapter are all baseless
theories, due to the ingenious refinements of the Alexandrian literati,
and springing out of the system of allegorical interpretation in which
the New Platonists so much delighted. It is evident that upon his *first
introduction* into Egypt, Serapis was regarded by the Alexandrians as
identical with Aïdoneus, or Dis, the Lord of the Lower World. Now, all
his attributes suggest him to have been of *Indian* origin, and no other
than *Yama*, "Lord of Hell," attended by his dog "Çarbara," *the
spotted*, who has the epithet "Triçira," *three-headed*, and by his
serpent "Çesha," called "Regent of Hades;" in fact, some have discovered
in the name Serapis <span id="fr_79"></span>[\*](#fn_78) but the Grecian
form of Yama's epithet, "Sraddha-deva," *Lord of the obsequies*, that
is, of the funeral sacrifices offered to the *Pitris* or *Manes*. Yama
also is styled "Lord of souls," and "Judge of the dead;" another office
assimilating him to Serapis in the character under which the latter came
to be specially regarded--a point, moreover, which at a later date
afforded stronger reasons for identifying him with Christ. A plausible
etymology of the name Serapis may be found in another of Yama's
epithets, "Asrik-pa" the *Blood-drinker*. This explanation is confirmed
to some extent by the ancient tradition, of which Homer makes such fine
use when he describes Ulysses' mode of evoking the ghosts, and their
eagerness to lap up the life-blood of the victim (Od. xi. 35):--

"Seizing the victim sheep I pierced their throats;  
 Flowed the black blood, and filled the hollow trench;  
 Then from the abyss, eager their thirst to slake,  
 Came swarming up the spirits of the dead."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And connected with
the same notion was the practice of strewing *roses* over the graves of
departed friends--

"Purpureos spargam flores et fungar inani munere,"

for (as Servius explains it) the *red* colour of the flower

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

represented *blood*, and thereby served as a substitute for the living
victim. <span id="fr_80"></span>[\*](#fn_79)

This analogy between Yama and Serapis may be further extended by the
consideration of certain other points connected with the office of the
former deity. For example, unto the souls of the righteous he appears as
"Dharma-rāja," and has a servant "Karma-la" (the Hermes Psychopompos of
the Greeks), who brings them into his presence upon a self-moving car.
But unto the wicked he is "Yama," and has for *them* another minister,
"Kash-Mala," who drags them before him with halters round their necks,
over rough and stony places. Other titles of Yama are "Kritānta" and
"Mrityu." The connection of the latter with *Mors* is evident enough,
making it a fitting appellation for *Dis* (*Ditis*), in which again
unmistakably lies the root of our name *Death*, applied to the same
Principle of Destruction.

Yama as "Sraddha-deva," monarch of "Pātāla" (the infernal regions), has
for consort Bhavani, who hence takes the title of "Patala-devi," as upon
Earth she is "Bhu-devi," in heaven, "Swardevi." Her lord owns, besides
Çarbara, another dog named "Çyama," the *Black One* (now we see
wherefore the mediæval familiar spirits like Cornelius Agrippa's black
spaniel, and Faustus’ "pudel" chose that particular figure), whom he
employs as the minister of his vengeance. As Judge of Souls he displays
two faces, the one benign, the other terrific. Another of his titles is
"Kalantika," *Time as the Destroyer:* it can hardly be a mere accidental
coincidence that such was the exact name given to the head-dress worn by
the Egyptian priests when officiating--in later times a purple cloth
covering the head, and falling down upon the neck, surmounted by two
plumes.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

"Kali-Bhavani," the Destructive Female Principle is represented <span
id="fr_81"></span>[\*](#fn_80) in this character with a visage exactly
identical with the most ancient type of the Grecian Gorgon--such as we
still behold it guarding the Etruscan sepulchres, and lowering
horrifically upon the sacrilegious intruder; as in that notable example
in the tomb of the Volumni at Perugia, where it forms the centrepiece of
the ceiling of the grand hall. Formed of a Tiger's head in its first
conception by the excited fancy of Hindoo superstition, the Etruscan
demon still exhibits the same protruded tongue, huge tusks, glaring
eyes, wings in the hair, and serpents twining about the throat. Of such
aspect was doubtless that "Gorgon's Head, the work of the Cyclops,"
which was shown to Pausanias as the most notable object in the Argive
Acropolis--a proof that the earliest essays of Pelasgic art had been
made in realising this idea. Again, in that most ancient monument of
Grecian art, the Coffer of Cypselus (made before B.C. 600), the same
traveller states (v. 19.), "Behind Polynices stands a female figure,
having tusks as savage as those of a wild beast, and the nails of her
fingers like unto talons: the inscription above her, *they tell you*
means Κῆρ (Fate)." This name therefore must have been a *foreign* word,
translated to Pausanias by the Custodian of the Temple. Plutarch (Life
of Aratus) supplies another singular illustration of the Worship of
these terrific idols of the olden time in the most polished ages of
Greece. The Artemis of Pellene was of so dreadful an aspect that none
dared to look upon her: and when carried in procession, her sight
blasted the very tree and crops as she passed. When the Ætolians were
actually in possession of and plundering the town, her priestess, by
bringing this image out from the shrine, struck them with such terror
that they made a precipitate retreat. This Artemis consequently must
have been a veritable Hecate, a true Queen of Hell, an idol moreover of
*wood*, ξόανον (like her of Ephesus), otherwise the priestess had not
been able to wield it so effectually to scare away the marauders. Again,
the recorded dream of Cimon, which presaged his death, was that a black
bitch bayed

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

at him in a half-human voice, "Come to me; I and my whelps will receive
thee gladly." The Hellenic gods, now and then shew themselves under an
aspect strangely at variance with their usual benevolent and *jovial*
character. A true Siva was that "Dionysos Omestes" (The Cannibal), unto
whom Themistocles, forced by the Diviners, sacrificed the three sons of
Sandauce, own sister to Xerxes, when taken prisoners on the eve of the
Battle of Salamis. It must be remembered that tradition made Perseus
bring back the Gorgon's Head, trophy of his success, from Ethiopia, a
synonym at first for the remotest East--it being only in Roman times
that "Ethiopia" was restricted to a single province of Africa. The
*harpe* too, the weapon lent to the hero by Hermes, is from its form no
other than the ankuşa, elephant-hook, which is carried for attribute by
so many of the Hindoo Deities. <span id="fr_82"></span>[\*](#fn_81)
Sufficient explanation this why Persephone (*Destroying-slayer*) was
assigned by the earliest Greeks as Consort to Aidoneus; and also why
Ulysses, on his visit to her realms, should have been alarmed,

"Lest from deep Hell Persephone the dread  
 Should send the terror of the Gorgon's Head."

From the influence of this terror upon the otherwise undaunted wanderer,
these same two lines came to be considered as endued with a wonderfully
strong repellent power, for Marcellus Empiricus prescribes them to be
whispered into the ear of any one choking from a bone or other matter
sticking in his throat; or else to write them out on a paper to be tied
around his throat, "Which will be equally effectual."

Lucian remarks ('Philopatris,') that the reason why the ancient warriors
bore the Gorgon's Head upon their shields was because it served for an
amulet against dangers of every sort; on the same account, in all
likelihood, was it put for device on many archaic coinages; Populonia,
Paros, &c. For

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

what could be more effective for the purpose of scaring away all evil
spirits than the visible countenance of the Queen of Hell? Timomachus
the painter (contemporary with the first Cæsar) made his reputation by
such a subject, "præcipue tamen ars ei favisse in Gorgone visa est," are
the words of Pliny, which masterpiece is supposed the original of the
horrific fresco discovered at Pompeii, the finest example of the art
that has reached our times. Many centuries after the fall of Paganism
did this image retain its power; Münter figures ('Sinnbilder der
Christen') a Gorgon's Head surrounded by the phonetic legend,
**+ VΟΜΕΛΑΙΝΗΜΕΛΑΙΝΟΜΕΝΑΟCΟΦΙCΗΛΗΕCΕΚΕΟCΛΕΟΝΒΡVΧΗCΕΙΚΕΟCΑΡΝΟCΚVΜΗCΗ**,
intended for--Υἱὸς Θεοῦ · Μελαίνη μελαινομένη, ὡσ ὄφις εἴλει ἡσυχῇ, ὡς
λέων βρυχήσει, καὶ ὡς ἄρνος κοιμήσει. "Black, blackened one, as a
serpent thou coilest thyself quietly, thou shalt roar like a lion, thou
shalt go to sleep like a lamb!" The same inscription, but so barbarously
spelt as to be unintelligible, probably forms the legend upon the famous
Seal of St. Servatius, preserved in Maestricht Cathedral. The seal is a
large disc of green jasper, engraved on both sides, and is attached to a
small slab of porphyry, traditionally passing for the Saint's portable
altar. Servatius died A.D. 389, but the workmanship of his seal betokens
the tenth or eleventh century for its origin. An important evidence of
the veneration of the Christian Byzantines for their guardian demon is
afforded by the exhumation (Spring of 1869) in the Ahmedan,
Constantinople, of the Colossal Gorgonion, six feet high from chin to
brow, carved in almost full relief on each side of an immense marble
block, which once formed the keystone of the gateway to the Forum of
Constantine. Though the execution betrays the paralysis of the Decline,
yet the general effect still remains grandiose and awe-inspiring.

Having thus traced Bhavani in her progress from Archaic Greek to
Byzantine times, let us observe the part she plays in the superstitions
of Imperial Rome. The idea, full of novel horrors, was gladly seized by
the extravagant genius of Lucan <span id="fr_83"></span>[\*](#fn_82)

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

to animate the exorcisms of his Thessalian sorceress Erictho (Pharsalia,
vi. 695).

"And Chaos, ever seeking to enfold  
 Unnumbered worlds in thy confusion old:  
 And Earth's dull god, who pining still beneath  
 Life's lingering burthen, pinest for tardy death.  
   \*          \*          \*          \*          \*  
 Tisiphone, and Thou her sister fell,  
 Megaera, thus regardless of my spell,  
 Why haste ye not with sounding scourge to chase  
 The soul accursed through hell's void formless space?  
 Say, must I call you by the names your right,  
 And drag the hell-hounds forth to th’ upper light?  
 Midst death I'll dog your steps at every turn,  
 Chase from each tomb, and drive from every urn.  
 And *thou*, still wont with visage not thine own,  
 To join the gods round the celestial throne,  
 Though yet thy pallor doth the truth betray,  
 And hint the horrors of thy gloomy  
 Thee, Hecate, in thy *true* form I'll show,  
 Nor let thee change the face thou wearest below.  
 I'll tell what feasts thy lingering steps detain  
 In earth's deep centre, and thy will enchain;  
 Tell what the pleasures that thee so delight,  
 And what tie binds thee to the King of Night;  
 And by what union wert thou so defiled,  
 Thy very mother would not claim her child,  
 --I'll burst thy caves, the world's most evil Lord,  
 And pour the sun upon thy realms abhorred,  
 Striking thee lifeless by the sudden day,  
 If still reluctant my behests to obey.  
 Or must I call *Him* at whose whispered *Name*  
 Earth trembles awestruck through her inmost frame?  
 Who views the Gorgon's face without a veil,  
 And with her own scourge makes Erinnys quail;  
 To whom the abyss, unseen by you, is given,  
 To which your regions are the upper heaven,  
 Who dares the oath that binds all gods to break,  
 And marks the sanction of the Stygian lake?"

All these personifications are in a spirit quite foreign to that of
Grecian mythology, but [thoroughly](errata.htm#7) imbued with that of
India. Lucan's Chaos is the Hindoo Destroyer, the Negro giant,
"Maha-Pralaya," swallowing up the gods themselves in his wide-gaping
jaws. His "Rector terrae" pining for the promised annihilation that is
so long in coming, finds no parallel in classical

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

religions, <span id="fr_84"></span>[\*](#fn_83) and his character
remains to me utterly inexplicable. His Furies "hunting souls to make
them fly," instead of being like the old awful Eumenides, the impartial
avengers of guilt, are mere demons, or churchyard ghouls. But his Hecate
is manifestly Bhavani herself; her "facies Erebi" being the Gorgonian
aspect which the latter was when reigning in "Yama-putri," but which she
puts off when presiding on earth, or in heaven; whilst the "infernal
banquets" that so enchant her are the human sacrifices regularly offered
up by Bhavani's special votaries, the Thugs. In the first, or *infernal*
aspect, a true "facies Erebi," she is depicted wearing a necklace of
human skulls and grasping in each hand a naked victim ready to be
devoured. She probably still shows us in what shape the Artemis of
Pallene appeared to scare away the Ætolian plunderers. The title of her
lord "pessimus mundi arbiter" is far more applicable to the Destroyer
Siva than to the inoffensive Pluto of the Greeks. Unless indeed the
Neronean poet may have heard something of the Demiurgus Ildabaoth, "Son
of Darkness, or Erebus," existing under a different name in some ancient
theogony. The Gnostics did not invent--they merely borrowed and applied.

Bhavani, in her character of "Kali," is sculptured as a terminal figure,
the exact counterpart in outline of the Ephesian Diana. Even the stags,
those remarkable adjuncts to the *shoulders* of the latter, are seen in
a similar position [springing](errata.htm#8) from Kali's *hands*. The
multiplied breasts of the Ephesian statue were also given to the
Alexandrian Isis, who is allowed by Creuzer and the rest to be the
Hindoo goddess in her character of "Parvati." Now this remark applies
only to her statue in the Serapeum, not to those belonging to the
ancient Pharaonic religion; and Macrobius's expressions show that her
real character *there* was as much a matter of dispute as that of her
companion, Serapis. Again, Diana as *Hecate* or Proserpine, belongs to
the infernal world over which she rules with the same authority as
Bhavani over Yama-Putri. The Ephesian

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

image, made of cypress wood, had "fallen down from heaven," which only
means, had come from some very remote and unknown source.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_78"></span>[165:\*](gar24.htm#fr_79) It is not improbable
that the name under which the god was worshipped at *Sinope* had
something of this sound; and which suggested to Manetho the idea of
identifying him with his own Oser-Api.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[166:\*](gar24.htm#fr_80) One of the most
frequented places of pilgrimage at Benares is the "Gyan Bapi," "Well of
Knowledge," in the depths whereof Siva himself resides. It was dug by
the genius Rishi, with that god's own trident, to relieve the world
after a twelve years’ drought. The pilgrims throw into it offerings of
all kinds, flowers included. Another well in the same city, of supreme
efficacy for the washing away of all sin, is the *Manikarnika*, so
called from the earring of Mahadeva, which fell into it. Vishnu had dug
this well with his *changra*, quoit, and filled it with the luminous
sweat of his body.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[168:\*](gar24.htm#fr_82) The Gorgon of the gems
('Ant. Gems,' Pl. XX., 4), and of the coin of Neapolis is regularly to
be seen, to this day, sculptured in relief upon the pillar set up on
each side of the gates of Hindoo temples, as I am informed by our great
oriental archæologist, Col. Pearse. She goes by the name of "Keeper of
the Gate." Now we see why her head decorated the pediments of temples in
Greece and Rome, and formed the keystone of triumphal arches even in the
time of Constantine, as the lately-discovered entrance to his "Forum of
Taurus" convincingly attests.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[169:\*](gar24.htm#fr_83) Who had in all
probability learnt them at some of the Mysteries, all of Asiatic origin,
so popular in his times with all persons making pretensions to the title
of philosophers.

obscurely shadowed forth by Hesiod, from whom Milton drew his grand
picture of Chaos, on whom wait--

Of Demogorgon."
