### PLATE C.

1\. Terminal figure, perhaps allusive by its form to Justinus' Æon, "The
Cross." The interminable legend surrounding it yields no intelligible
words, but the title below the Herme, **ΝΙΧΑΡΟΠΛΗC** occurs also on a
talisman in the French Cabinet. The reverse gives the Seven Vowels (or
"Voices") that shroud the Ineffable Name, which has never been uttered
aloud since the day of the destruction of the Temple, but is
communicated only in half-whispers to every Rabbi upon his ordination.
It is a remarkable fact that a Talmudist, who remembered the Second
Temple, observes that this Holy Name was "*warbled* rather than
pronounced" in the course of the service; hence we may suspect the
*possibility* of imitating its sound by the permutation of vowels that
form so important an element in the construction of our talismans.

2\. Father Nile, reclining and holding forth a cornucopia, emblematic of
amity. <span id="fr_263"></span>[\*](#fn_261) As the "number of his
Greek name," 365, is equivalent to that of Abraxas, it is probable that,
according to Kabbalistic rules, he here represents that god. This
explanation is supported by the type of the reverse, Horus, seated on
the lotus, addressed by the Greek transliteration of the Hebrew
*Ablanathanalba*, "Thou art our Father!"

3\. Horus seated in the *baris*, or sacred boat; the prow and poop
whereof terminate in the hawk's head of Phre, and the ox-head of Apis.
He is here addressed by the Ineffable Name.

4\. The same deity, addressed as before by the salutation
*Ablanathanalba*, followed by an unintelligible word. The unskilful
gem-engraver, unable to form curves in the lettering, has given to his B
the form of K, and increased the difficulty of deciphering this legend.

5\. The same, but now seated upon the scarabæ, type of the Creator,

enclosed within the coiled serpent, emblem of Eternity. With these
purely Pharaonic sigils the reverse combines the name of the Jewish
angel Michael, and the Seven Vowels of the Ineffable Name; thus
presenting an instructive example of that reconciliation of, apparently,
the most antagonistic creeds which is the very foundation of Gnosticism.
