#### VIII.

### AUGUSTINE

<span class="small">i. *De Civitate Dei*, xxiii.; Hoffmann (E.), i. 392
(Vienna, 1899-1900). <span id="fr_595"></span>[1](#fn_595)</span>

##### THREE QUOTATIONS FROM THE OLD LATIN VERSION OF THE “PERFECT SERMON”

<span class="smallcaps">Augustine</span> is arguing against the views of
Appuleius (first half of the second century) on the cult of the
“daimones,” and in so doing introduces a long disquisition on the
doctrine of “Egyptian Hermes, whom they call Thrice-greatest,”
concerning image-worship, or the consecrated and “ensouled,” or
“animated,” statues of the gods.

In the course of his remarks the Bishop of Hippo quotes at length from a
current Latin version <span id="fr_596"></span>[2](#fn_596) of “The
Perfect Sermon” or “Asclepius” (though without himself giving any
title), which we see at once must have been the very same text that has
come down to us in its entirety. It is precisely the same text, word for
word, with ours; the variants being practically of the most minute
character.

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

First of all Augustine quotes from *P. S. A.*, xxiii. 3, xxiv. 2. This
“prophecy” of the downfall of the Egyptian religion Augustine naturally
takes as referring to the triumph of Christianity, and so he ridicules
Hermes “\[*qui*\] *tam impudenter dolebat, quam imprudentur sciebat*.”

<span class="small">ii. *Ibid.*, xxiv.; Hoffmann, i. 396.</span>

The Bishop of Hippo begins his next chapter with a quotation from *P. S.
A.*, xxxvii. 1, 2, on the same subject, and proceeds scornfully to
criticise the statements of the Trismegistic writer.

<span class="small">iii. *Ibid.*, xxvi.; Hoffmann, i. 402.</span>

After quoting the sentence, from *P. S. A.*, xxiv. 3, in which Hermes
says that the pure temples of Egypt will all be polluted with tombs and
corpses, Augustine proceeds to contend that the gods of Egypt are all
dead men, and in support of his contention he quotes *P. S. A.*, xxxvii.
3, 4.
