<p><h5 align="center">CYRIL&#146;S CORPUS OF XV. BOOKS</h5></p>
<p>(<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cyril</span>, after claiming that Pythagoras and Plato obtained their wisdom in Egypt from what, he professes, they had heard of Moses there, proceeds:)</p>
<p>And I think the Egyptian Hermes also should be considered worthy of mention and recollection&#8212;he who, they say, bears the title of Thrice-greatest because of the honour paid him by his contemporaries, and, as some think, in comparison with Hermes the fabled son of Zeus and Maia.</p>
<p>This Hermes of Egypt, then, although an initiator into mysteries,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and though he never ceased to cleave to the shrines of idols, is [nevertheless] found to have grasped the doctrines of Moses, if not with entire correctness, and beyond all cavil, yet still in part.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

<p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></A></p>
<p>For both [Hermes] himself has been benefitted [by Moses], and reminder of this [fact] has also been made in his own writings by [the editor] at Athens who put together the fifteen books entitled &#8220;Herma&iuml;ca.&#8221; [This editor] writes concerning him [Hermes] in the first book, putting the words into the mouth of one of the priests of the sacred rites:</p>
<p>&#8220;In order then that we may come to things of a like nature (?),&#8212;have you not heard that our Hermes divided the whole of Egypt into allotments and portions, measuring off the acres with the chain,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_600"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and cut canals for irrigation purposes, and made nomes,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_601"></A><A HREF="#fn_601"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and named the lands [comprised in them] after them, and established the interchange of contracts, and drew up a list of the risings of the stars, and [the proper times&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_602"></A><A HREF="#fn_602"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>] to cut plants; and beyond all this he discovered and bequeathed to posterity numbers, and calculations, and geometry, and astronomy, and astrology, and music, and the whole of grammar?&#8221;</p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>This Corpus of XV. Books is evidently the source of Cyril&#146;s information, and he takes the above quotation from the Introduction, which purported to be written by an Egyptian priest (as is also the case in the treatise <i>De Mysteriis</i>, traditionally ascribed to Jamblichus), but which Cyril says was written at Athens, by presumably some Greek editor.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p><h5 align="center">THE INCORPOREAL EYE </h5></p>
<p>Thrice-greatest Hermes says somewhat as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> 
<p>(Cyril then quotes, with four slight verbal variants, the first four paragraphs of the passage excerpted by Stob&aelig;us, Ex. ii., and then proceeds without a break:)</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XI.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>If, then, there be an incorporeal eye,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_604"></A><A HREF="#fn_604"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> let it go forth from body unto the Vision of the Beautiful; let it fly up and soar aloft, seeking to see not form, nor body, nor [even] types&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_605"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> [of things], but rather That which is the Maker of [all] these,&#8212;the Quiet and Serene, the Stable and the Changeless One, the Self, the All, the One, the Self of self, the Self in self, the Like to Self [alone], That which is neither like to other, nor [yet] unlike to self, and [yet] again Himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_606"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></blockquote></p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>Though Cyril runs this passage on to the four paragraphs which in the Stob&aelig;an Extract are continued by three other paragraphs, I am quite persuaded that the Archbishop of Alexandria took the above from the same &#8220;Sermon to Tat&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_607"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> as the Anthologist.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<p><h5 align="center">THE HEAVENLY WORD PROCEEDING FORTH</h5></p>
<p>And Thrice-greatest Hermes thus delivers himself concerning God:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XII.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>For that His Word (<i>Logos</i>) proceeding forth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_609"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#8212;all-perfect as he was, and fecund, and creative in fecund Nature, falling on fecund&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_610"></A><A HREF="#fn_610"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Water, made Water pregnant.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_611"></A><A HREF="#fn_611"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></blockquote></p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE PYRAMID </h5></p>
<p>And the same again [declares]:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XIII.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>The Pyramid, then, is below [both] Nature and the Intellectual World.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_612"></A><A HREF="#fn_612"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> For that it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> hath above it ruling it the Creator-Word&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> of the Lord of all,&#8212;who, being the First Power after</blockquote></p>

<p><h5 align="center">THE NATURE OF GOD&#146;S INTELLECTUAL WORD</h5></p>
<p>And again the same [Hermes], when one of the Temple-folk&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_617"></A><A HREF="#fn_617"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in Egypt questions him and says:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XIV.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>But why, O most mighty Good Daimon, was he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_618"></A><A HREF="#fn_618"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> called by this name&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_619"></A><A HREF="#fn_619"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> by the Lord of all?&#8212;replies:</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>Yea, have I told thee in what has gone before, but thou hast not perceived it.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>The nature of His Intellectual Word (<i>Logos</i>) is a productive and creative Nature. This is as though it were His Power-of-giving-birth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_620"></A><A HREF="#fn_620"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> or [His] Nature, or [His] Mode of being, or call it</blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote>what you will,&#8212;only remembering this: that He is Perfect in the Perfect, and from the Perfect makes, and creates, and makes to live, perfect good things.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>Since, then, He hath this nature, rightly is He thus named.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_621"></A><A HREF="#fn_621"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></blockquote></p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE WORD OF THE CREATOR</h5></p>
<p>And the same [Hermes], in the First Sermon of the &#8220;Expository [Sermons] to Tat,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_622"></A><A HREF="#fn_622"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> speaks thus about God:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XV.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>The Word (<i>Logos</i>) of the Creator, O [my] son, transcends all sight; He [is] self-moved; He cannot be increased, nor [yet] diminished; Alone is He, and like unto Himself [Alone], equal, identical, perfect in His stability, perfect in order; for that He is the One, after the God alone beyond all knowing.</blockquote></p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>The first two Fragments (xi. and xii.) seem to be taken from the same sermon, the contents of which resembled the first part of the &#8220;Shepherd of Men&#8221; treatise; it has all the appearance of a discourse addressed to Tat, and probably came in &#8220;The Expository Sermons.&#8221;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="green">p. 257</font></A></p>
<p>The third Fragment (xiii.) belongs to the more frankly Egyptian type, the Agathodaimon literature, in which Hermes, as the Good Spirit, figures as the teacher of the Mystery-god Osiris.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_623"></A><A HREF="#fn_623"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>The last Fragment (xv.) is so similar in its phrasing to Fragment xi., already given by Cyril (i. 31), that I am strongly inclined to think the Archbishop took both from the same source. If so, we can reconstruct part of &#8220;The First Sermon of the Expository [Sermons] to Tat,&#8221; the beginning of which (see Lact., <i>Ep</i>., 4) is also given by Stob&aelig;us, Ex. ii., with the heading from &#8220;The [Book] to Tat,&#8221; while he heads other extracts &#8220;From the [pl.] to Tat.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_624"></A><A HREF="#fn_624"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>
<p><small>v. <i>Ibid.</i>, ii. 35; Migne, col. 556 A. </small></p>
<p><h5 align="center">MIND OF MIND</h5></p>
<p>And Hermes also says in the Third Sermon of those to Asclepius:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XVI.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>It is not possible such mysteries [as these] should be declared to those who are without initiation in the sacred rites. But ye, lend [me] your ears, [ears] of your mind!</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>There was One Intellectual Light alone,&#8212;nay, Light transcending Intellectual Light. He is for ever Mind of mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_625"></A><A HREF="#fn_625"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> who makes [that] Light to shine.</blockquote></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="green">p. 258</font></A></p>
<p><blockquote>There was no other; [naught] save the Oneness of Himself [alone]. For ever in Himself [alone], for ever doth He compass all in His own Mind,&#8212;His Light and Spirit.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_626"></A><A HREF="#fn_626"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></blockquote></p>
<p><h5 align="center">HE IS ALL </h5></p>
<p>And after some other things he says:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XVII.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>Without Him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_627"></A><A HREF="#fn_627"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> [is] neither god, nor angel, nor daimon, nor any other being. For He is Lord of all, [their] Father, and [their] God, and Source, and Life, and Power, and Light, and Mind, and Spirit. For all things are in Him and for His sake.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_628"></A><A HREF="#fn_628"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></blockquote></p>
<p><h5 align="center">CONCERNING SPIRIT</h5></p>
<p>And again, in the same Third Sermon of those to Asclepius, in reply to one who questions [him] concerning the Divine Spirit, the same [Hermes] says as follows:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XVIII.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>Had there not been some Purpose&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_629"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of the Lord of all, so that I should disclose this word</blockquote></p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="green">p. 259</font></A></p>
<p><blockquote><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (<i>logos</i>), ye would not have been filled with so great love&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_630"></A><A HREF="#fn_630"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to question me about it. Now give ye ear unto the rest of the discourse (<i>logos</i>).</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>Of this same Spirit, of which I have already spoken many times, all things have need; for that it raises up all things, each in its own degree, and makes them live, and gives them nourishment, and [finally] removes them from its holy source,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_631"></A><A HREF="#fn_631"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> aiding the spirit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_632"></A><A HREF="#fn_632"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and for ever giving life to all, the [one] productive One.&#8221;</blockquote></p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE &#8220;TO ASCLEPIUS&#8221; OF CYRIL&#146;S CORPUS</h5></p>
<p>From the above statements of Cyril we learn that in addition to &#8220;The Expository Sermons to Tat,&#8221; he had also before him a collection of &#8220;Sermons to Asclepius&#8221;; of these there were at least three. Was &#8220;The Perfect Sermon&#8221; one of this collection? It may have been; for the style of it is cast in the same mould as that of these Fragments in Cyril.</p>
<p>Hermes, in the Third Sermon of Cyril&#146;s collection, is addressing several hearers, for he uses the plural; so also in <i>P. S. A.</i>, i. 2. Hermes addresses Asclepius, Tat, and Ammon.</p>
<p>In the Third Sermon, Hermes also says: &#8220;It is not possible such mysteries should be declared to those</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="green">p. 260</font></A></p>
<p>who are without initiation in the sacred rites&#8221;; in <i>P. S. A.</i>, i. 2, Hermes declares: &#8220;It is a mark of an impious mind to publish to the knowledge of the crowd&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_633"></A><A HREF="#fn_633"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a tractate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_634"></A><A HREF="#fn_634"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> brimming o&#146;er with the full grandeur of divinity.&#8221; The <i>numinis majestas</i> (grandeur of divinity) is precisely the same idea as the Spirit, the &#8220;Divine supremacy and power,&#8221; as Cyril says referring to Hermes.</p>
<p>Finally, in the Third Sermon, Hermes makes the striking remark that the Love (&#7956;&#961;&#969;&#962;) of the Gnosis which urges on the disciples, is inspired by the Providence or Foresight of God&#8212;that is, by His Spirit; <i>P. S. A.</i>, i. 28, ends with the words: &#8220;To them, sunk in fit silence reverently, their souls and minds pendent on Hermes&#146; lips, thus Love (&#7956;&#961;&#969;&#962;) Divine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_635"></A><A HREF="#fn_635"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> began to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>The setting of the mode of exposition is then identical in the two Sermons, and we may thus very well refer them to the same collection.</p>
<p><small>v. <i>Ibid.</i>, ii. 52; Migne, col. 580 B.</small></p>
<p><h5 align="center">FROM &#8220;THE MIND&#8221;</h5></p>
<p>To this I will add what Thrice-greatest Hermes wrote &#8220;To his own Mind,&#8221;&#8212;for thus the Book is called.</p>
<p>(Cyril then quotes, with very slight verbal variants, the last question and answer in <i>C. H</i>., xi. (xii.) 22.)</p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>In our Corpus the treatise is not written by Hermes to the Mind, but, on the contrary, it is cast in the mould of a revelation of &#8220;The Mind to Hermes,&#8221; and is so</p>

<p>entitled. Cyril thus seems to have been mistaken.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_636"></A><A HREF="#fn_636"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> It may, then, have been that in the copy which lay before the Church Father, the title read simply: &#8220;The Mind.&#8221;</p>

<p><h5 align="center">OSIRIS AND THRICE-GREATEST AGATHODAIMON</h5></p>
<p>But I will call to mind the words of Hermes the Thrice-greatest; in &#8220;The Asclepius&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_638"></A><A HREF="#fn_638"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> he says:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XIX.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>Osiris said: How, then, O thou Thrice-greatest, [thou] Good Spirit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_639"></A><A HREF="#fn_639"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> did Earth in its entirety appear?</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>The Great Good Spirit made reply:</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>By gradual drying up, as I have said; and when the many Waters got commandment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_640"></A><A HREF="#fn_640"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> to go into themselves again, the Earth in its entirety appeared, muddy and shaking.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>Then, when the Sun shone forth, and without ceasing burned and dried it up, the Earth stood compact in the Waters, with Water all around.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_641"></A><A HREF="#fn_641"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></blockquote></p>

<p><h5 align="center">&#8220;LET THERE BE EARTH&#8221;</h5></p>
<p>Further, in yet another place [he writes]:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XX.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>The Maker and the Lord of all thus spake: Let there be Earth, and let the Firmament appear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_642"></A><A HREF="#fn_642"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>And forthwith the beginning of the [whole] creation, Earth, was brought into existence.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_643"></A><A HREF="#fn_643"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></blockquote></p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE GENERATION OF THE SUN</h5></p>
<p>So much about the Earth; as to the Sun, he again says as follows:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XXI.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>Then said Osiris: O thou Thrice-greatest, [thou] Good Spirit, whence came this mighty one?</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>Would&#146;st thou, Osiris, that we tell to thee the generation of the Sun, whence he appeared?</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>He came from out the Foresight of the Lord of all; yea, the Sun&#146;s birth proceedeth from</blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote>the Lord of all, through His Creative Holy Word.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_644"></A><A HREF="#fn_644"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></blockquote></p>
<p><h5 align="center">&#8220;LET THE SUN BE!&#8221;</h5></p>
<p>In like manner also in the &#8220;First Expository Sermon to Tat,&#8221; he says:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XXII.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>Straightway the Lord of all spake unto His own Holy and Intelligible&#8212;to His Creative Word (<i>Logos</i>): Let the Sun be!</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>And straightway with His word (<i>logos</i>), the Fire that hath its nature tending upward,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_645"></A><A HREF="#fn_645"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>&#8212;I mean pure [Fire], that which gives greatest light, has the most energy, and fecundates the most,&#8212;Nature embraced&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_646"></A><A HREF="#fn_646"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with her own Spirit, and raised it up aloft out of the Water.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_647"></A><A HREF="#fn_647"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></blockquote></p>
<p>(After referring to Genesis i. 6: &#8220;And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters,&#8221;&#8212;Cyril proceeds:)</p>
<p><small>vii. <i>Ibid.</i>, ii. 57; Migne, col. 588 C. </small></p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE FIRMAMENT </h5></p>
<p>Moreover the Hermes who is with them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_648"></A><A HREF="#fn_648"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Thrice-</p>

<p><a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="green">p. 264</font></A></p>
<p>greatest mentions this [that is, the firmament] again. For he describes God as saying to His creations:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XXIII.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>I will encompass you with this Necessity, you who are disobedient to me,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_649"></A><A HREF="#fn_649"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> which hath been laid on you as a Command through My own Word (<i>Logos</i>); for him ye have as Law.</blockquote></p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>This quotation also is probably taken from the same source as the previous passage&#8212;that is, from the &#8220;First Expository Sermon to Tat.&#8221; The idea and setting, however, should also be compared with the parallel in the <i>K. K</i>. Excerpt (Stob., <i>Phys</i>., xli. 44; Gaisf., p. 408): &#8220;O Souls, Love and Necessity shall be your lords, they who are lords and marshals after me of all,&#8221;&#8212;where the &#8220;after me&#8221; (&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8125; &#7952;&#956;&#941;) might perhaps confirm the &#8220;up to me&#8221; in the preceding note as the more correct rendering.</p>

<p>The same treatise must have lain before Cyril as that contained in our Corpus in the form of a letter with the heading, &#8220;Unto Asclepius good health of soul!&#8221;&#8212;for the Archbishop says that Hermes &#8220;writes thus to Asclepius.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_651"></A><A HREF="#fn_651"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> 
<p>And their Thrice-greatest Hermes seems also to be of the same opinion; for he, too, writes as follows, in the [sermon] &#8220;To Asclepius,&#8221; concerning those unholy daimons against whom we ought to protect ourselves, and flee from them with all the speed we can:</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> 
<p>&#8220;The sole protection&#8212;and this we must have&#8212;is piety. For neither evil daimon, yea nor Fate, can ever overcome or dominate a man who pious is, and pure, and holy.
