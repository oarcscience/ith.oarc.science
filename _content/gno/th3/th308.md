#### EXCERPT VII.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### OF BODIES EVERLASTING \[AND BODIES PERISHABLE\]

<span class="small">(Title (first half) from Patrizzi (p. 45b), followed
by “To the Same Tat.”</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., xxxv. 8, under the curious
heading: “Of Hermes—From the \[Sermons\] to Ammon to Tat”; where “to
Tat” is evidently a marginal correction for an erroneous “to Ammon.” G.
pp. 292-294; M. i. 204, 205; W. i. 290-292.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. iii. of “Fragments from the
Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” pp. 238, 239.)</span>

1\. \[*Her*.\] The Lord and Demiurge of all eternal bodies, Tat, when He
had made them once for all, made them no more, nor doth He make them
\[now\].

Committing them unto themselves, and co-uniting them with one another,
He let them go, in want of naught, as everlasting things.

If they have want of any, it will be want of one another and not of any
increase to their number from without, in that they are immortal.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

For that it needs must be that bodies made by Him should have their
nature of this kind.

2\. Our Demiurge, <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86) however, who is
\[himself already\] in a body, <span id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_87) hath
made us,—he makes for ever, and will \[ever\] make, bodies corruptible
and under sway of death.

For ’twere not law that he should imitate the Maker of himself,—all the
more so as ’tis impossible.

For that the latter did create from the first essence which is bodiless;
the former made as from the bodying <span id="fr_88"></span>[3](#fn_88)
brought into existence \[by his Lord\].

3\. It follows, then, according to right reason, that while those
bodies, since they are brought into existence from incorporal essence,
are free from death, ours are corruptible and under sway of death,—in
that our matter is composed of bodies, <span
id="fr_89"></span>[4](#fn_89) as may be seen from their being weak and
needing much assistance.

For how would it be possible our bodies’ continuity should last, unless
it had some nutriment imported \[into it\] from similar elements, and
\[so\] renewed our bodies day by day?

For that we have a stream of earth, and water,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

fire, and air, flowing into us, which renovates our bodies, and keeps
our tent <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90) together.

We are too weak to bear the motions \[of our frames\], enduring them not
even for one single day.

For know, \[my\] son, that if our bodies did not rest at night, we
should not last a single day.

4\. Wherefore, our Maker, being good, and with foreknowledge of all
things, in order that the animal may last, hath given sleep, the
greatest \[calm <span id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_91)\] of the fatigue of
motion, and hath appointed equal time to each, or rather more, for rest.

Ponder well, son, the mightiest energy of sleep,—the opposite to the
soul’s \[energy\], but not inferior to it.

For that just as the soul is motion’s energy, so bodies also cannot live
without \[the help of\] sleep.

For ’tis the relaxation and the recreation of the jointed limbs; it also
operates within,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

converting into body the fresh supply of matter that flows in,
apportioning to each its proper \[kind\],—the water to the blood, the
earth to bones and marrow, the air to nerves and veins, the fire to
sight. <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92)

Wherefore the body, too, feels keen delight in sleep, for it is sleep
that brings this \[feeling of\] delight into activity.

#### COMMENT

Patrizzi’s title is by no means descriptive of the main contents of the
excerpt, which is evidently from the Sermons of Hermes to Tat, and from
the same collection of these from which Stobæus has taken the previous
two extracts,—that is, presumably, the Expository Sermons.

our bodies, which are not everlasting.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[31:2](th308.htm#fr_87) The Sun, perhaps; *cf.
C. H.*, xvi. 18; and Ex., iii. 6 and iv. 2; and Lact., *D. I*., iv. 6.

(*ap*. Clem. Alex., 703), and the Pythagoreans (Timæus Locr., 100 A,
101, C, E), and the Later Platonists, for the body as the tabernacle of
the soul. See especially the response of the Oracle at Delphi, when
consulted concerning the state of the soul of Plotinus after death, as
quoted by Porphyry in his *Life of Plotinus*: “But now since thou hast
struck thy tent, and left the tomb of thy angelic soul” (see my “Lives
of the Later Platonists” in *The Theosophical Review* (July, 1896),
xviii. 372. *Cf.* Ex. iii. 1 and 5; and *C. H*., xiii. (xiv.) 12 and 15.
