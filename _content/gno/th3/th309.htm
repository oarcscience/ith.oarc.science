<p><small>(Title from Patrizzi (p. 44); preceded by &#8220;Of Thrice-greatest Hermes.&#8221;</small></p>
<p><small>Text: Stob., <i>Phys.</i>, xxxv. 6, under the heading: &#8220;From the [Sermons] to Tat&#8221;; G. pp. 284-291; M. i. 198-203; W. i. 284-289.</small></p>
<p><small>M&eacute;nard, Livre IV., No. ii. of &#8220;Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,&#8221; pp. 231-237.)</small></p>
<p>1. <i>Tat</i>. Rightly hast thou explained these things, O father [mine]. Now give me further teaching as to those.</p>
<p>For thou hast said somewhere&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that science and that art do constitute the rational&#146;s energy.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>
<p>But now thou say&#146;st that the irrational lives,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> through deprivation of the rational, are and are called <i>ir</i>-rational.</p>
<p>According to this reasoning, [therefore], it follows of necessity that the irrational lives are</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></A></p>
<p>without any share in science or in art, through deprivation of the rational.</p>
<p>2. <i>Her</i>. [It follows] of necessity, [my] son.</p>
<p><i>Tat</i>. How, then, O father, do we see some of irrational [creatures] using [both] intelligence, and art?&#8212;the ants, for instance, storing their food for winter, and in like fashion, [too,] the creatures of the air building their nests, and the four-footed beasts [each] knowing their own holes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p><i>Her</i>. These things they do, O son, neither by science nor by art, but by [the force of] nature.</p>
<p>Science and art are teachable; but none of these irrationals is taught a thing.</p>
<p>Things done by nature are [so] done by reason of the general energy of things.</p>
<p>Things [done] by art and science are achieved by those who know, [and] not by all.</p>
<p>Things done by all are brought into activity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by nature.</p>
<p>3. For instance, all look up [to heaven]; but all [are] not musicians, or [are] all archers, or hunters, or the rest.</p>
<p>But some of them have learned one thing,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></A></p>
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> [others another thing], science and art being active&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> [in them].</p>
<p>In the same way, if some ants only did this thing, and others not, thou would&#146;st have rightly said they acted by [the light] of science, and stored their food by means of art.</p>
<p>But if they all without distinction are driven by their nature to [do] this, though [it may be] against their will,&#8212;&#146;tis plain they do not do it or by science or by art.</p>
<p>4. For Tat, these energies, though [in themselves] they are incorporal, are [found] in bodies, and act through bodies.</p>
<p>Wherefore, O Tat, in that they are incorporal, thou sayest that they are immortal; but, in so far as without bodies they cannot manifest activity,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I say that they are ever in a body.</p>
<p>Things once called into being for some purpose, or some cause, things that come under Providence and Fate, can never stay inactive of their proper energy.</p>
<p>For that which is, shall ever be; for that this [being] is [the very] body and the life of it.</p>
<p>5. It follows from this reason, [then,] that these are always bodies.</p>
<p>Wherefore I say that &#8220;bodying&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> itself is an eternal [exercise of] energy.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></A></p>
<p>If bodies are on earth, they&#146;re subject unto dissolution; yet must these [ever] be [on earth to serve] as places and as organs for the energies.</p>
<p>The energies, however, [are] immortal, and the immortal is eternally,&#8212;[that is, that] body-making, if it ever is,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is energy.</p>
<p>6. [The energies] accompany the soul, though not appearing all at once.</p>
<p>Some of them energize the man the moment that he&#146;s born, united with the soul round its irrational [parts]; whereas the purer ones, with change of age,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> co-operate with the soul&#146;s rational part.</p>
<p>But all these energies depend on bodies. From godly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> bodies they descend to mortal [frames], these body-making [energies]; each one of them is [ever] active, either around the body or the soul.</p>
<p>Yea, they are active with the soul itself without a body. They are for ever in activity.</p>
<p>The soul, however, is not for ever in a <i>mortal</i> body, for it can be without the <i>body</i>; whereas the energies can never be without the <i>bodies</i>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></A></p>
<p>This is a sacred saying (<i>logos</i>), son: Body apart from soul cannot persist; its being can.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>7. <i>Tat</i>. What dost thou mean, O father [mine]?</p>
<p><i>Her</i>. Thus understand it, Tat! When soul leaves body, body itself remains.</p>
<p>But [even] the body so abandoned,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> as long as it remains, is in activity, being broken up and made to disappear.</p>
<p>For body without [the exercise of] energy could not experience these things.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>
<p>This energy, accordingly, continues with the body when the soul has gone.</p>
<p>This, therefore, is the difference of an immortal body and a mortal one,&#8212;that the immortal doth consist of a one single matter, but this [body does] not.</p>
<p>The former&#146;s active, and the latter&#146;s passive.</p>
<p>For every thing that maketh active is the stronger; and [every thing] that is made active is the weaker.</p>
<p>The stronger, too, being in authority and free, doth lead; the [weaker] follows [as] a slave.</p>
<p>8. The energies, then, energize not only bodies that are ensouled, but also [bodies] unensouled,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></A></p>
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> &#8212;stocks, stones,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and all such things;&#8212;both making [them] to grow, and to bear fruits, and ripening [them], dissolving, melting, rotting and crumbling [them], and setting up [in them] all like activities which bodies without souls can undergo.</p>
<p>For energy&#146;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the name, O son, for just the thing that&#146;s going on,&#8212;that is becoming.</p>
<p>And many things needs must for ever be becoming; nay, rather, all things [must].</p>
<p>For never is Cosmos bereft of any of existent things, but being borne&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> for aye in its own self, it bears existent things,&#8212;[things] that shall never cease from being destroyed again.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>
<p>9. Know, then, that energy of every kind is ever free from death,&#8212;no matter what it is, or in what body.</p>
<p>And of the energies, some are of godly bodies, and some of those which are corruptible; some [are] general, and some special. Some [are] of genera, and some are of the parts of every genus.</p>
<p>The godly ones, [accordingly], are those that exercise their energies through everlasting bodies. And these are perfect [energies], in that [they energize] through perfect bodies.</p>
<p>But partial [energies are] those [that energize] through each one of the [single] living things.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></A></p>
<p>And special [energies are those that energize] through each one of existent things.</p>
<p>10. This argument, accordingly, O son, deduces that all things are full of energies.</p>
<p>For though it needs must be that energies should be in bodies,&#8212;and there be many bodies in the Cosmos,&#8212;I say that energies are many more than bodies.</p>
<p>For often in one body there is [found] one, and a second and a third [activity],&#8212;not counting in the general ones that come with it.</p>
<p>By general ones I mean the purely corporal ones, that exercise themselves through the sensations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the motions [of the body].</p>
<p>For that without these energies the body [of an animal] can not persist.</p>
<p>11. The souls of men, however, have a second class of energies,&#8212;the special ones [that exercise themselves] through arts, and sciences, and practices, and [purposed] doings.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>
<p>For that the feelings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> follow on the energies or rather are completions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of the energies.</p>
<p>Know, then, O son, the difference of energy and of sensation.</p>
<p>[Thus] energy is sent down from above; whereas sensation, being in the body and having its existence from it, receives the energy</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></A></p>
<p>and makes it manifest, as though it did embody it.</p>
<p>Wherefore I say sensations are both corporal and mortal, and last as long as doth the body [only].</p>
<p>Nay, rather, its sensations are born together with the body, and they die with it.</p>
<p>12. But the immortal bodies in themselves have no sensation,&#8212;[not even an] immortal [one], as though they were composed out of some essence of some kind.</p>
<p>For that sensation doth arise entirely from naught else than either from the bad or else the good that&#146;s added to the body, or that is, on the contrary, taken [from it] again.</p>
<p>But with eternal bodies there is no adding to nor taking from.</p>
<p>Wherefore, sensation doth not occur in them.</p>
<p>13. <i>Tat</i>. Is, then, sensation felt in every body?</p>
<p><i>Her</i>. In every body, son; and energies are active in all [bodies, too].</p>
<p><i>Tat</i>. Even in bodies without souls, O father [mine]?</p>
<p><i>Her</i>. Even in them, O son. There are, however, differences in the sensations.</p>
<p>The feelings of the rationals occur with reason; those of irrationals are simply corporal; as for the things that have no soul, they [also] have</p>
<p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></A></p>
<p>sensations, but passive ones,&#8212;experience of increase [only] and decrease.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>Moreover, passion and sensation depend from one [same] head,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and they are gathered up again into the same, and that, too, by the energies.</p>
<p>14. Of lives&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with souls there are two other energies which go with the sensations and the passions,&#8212;grief and joy.</p>
<p>And without these, an ensouled life, and most of all a rational one, could not experience sensation.</p>
<p>Wherefore, I say that there are forms of passions,&#8212;[and] forms that dominate the rational lives more [than the rest].</p>
<p>The energies, then, are the active forces [in sensations], while the sensations are the indications of the energies.</p>
<p>15. Further, as these&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> are corporal, they&#146;re set in motion by the irrational parts of [a man&#146;s] soul; wherefore, I say that both of them are mischievous.</p>
<p>For that both joy, though [for the moment] it provides sensation joined with pleasure, immediately becomes a cause of many ills&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> to</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></A></p>
<p>him who feeleth it; while grief [itself] provides [still] greater pains and suffering.</p>
<p>Wherefore, they both would seem [most] mischievous.</p>
<p>16. <i>Tat</i>. Can, then, sensation be the same in soul and body, father [mine]?</p>
<p><i>Her</i>. How dost thou mean,&#8212;sensation in the soul, [my] son?</p>
<p><i>Tat</i>. Surely it cannot be that soul&#146;s incorporal, and that sensation is a body, father,&#8212;sensation which is sometimes in a body and sometimes not, [just as the soul]?</p>
<p><i>Her</i>. If we should put it <i>in</i> a body, son, we should [then] represent it as like the soul or [like] the energies. For that we say these&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are incorporals in bodies.</p>
<p>But [as] sensation&#146;s neither energy nor soul, nor any other thing than body, according to what has been said above, it cannot, therefore, be incorporal.</p>
<p>And if it&#146;s not incorporal, it must be body.</p>
<p>For of existing things some must be bodies and the rest incorporal.</p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p><h4 align="center">COMMENT</h4></p>
<p>Again, as with the last excerpt, the earlier editions of Stob&aelig;us have Asclepius and Tat as the persons of</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></A></p>
<p>the dialogue instead of Hermes and Tat. Wachsmuth gives them correctly.</p>
<p>The second sentence is of great interest, for it refers us presumably to <i>C. H.</i>, x. (xi.), 22: &#8220;God&#146;s rays, to use a figure, are his energies; the Cosmos&#146;s are natures; the arts and sciences are man&#146;s.&#8221; Seeing, however, that &#8220;The Key&#8221; is an Epitome of the General Sermons to Tat, the statement may also have been made in one of these sermons.</p>
<p>In either case the existence of these General Sermons is presupposed, and, therefore, it may be that our excerpt is, again, one of the Expository Sermons to Tat.</p>
<p>The beginning of the Sermon has clearly been omitted by Stob&aelig;us, and apparently the end also.</p>
