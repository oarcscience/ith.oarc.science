<p><small>(Title from Patrizzi (p. 40); preceded by &#8220;Of Thrice-greatest Hermes,&#8221; and followed by &#8220;To the Same Ammon.&#8221;</small></p>
<p><small>Text: Stob., <i>Phys</i>., xxxv. 9, under heading: &#8220;Of Hermes from the [Sermons] to Ammon&#8221;; G. pp. 282, 283; M. i. 196, 197; W. 281, 282.</small></p>
<p><small>M&eacute;nard, Livre IV., No. iii. of &#8220;Fragments of the Books of Hermes to Ammon,&#8221; pp. 259, 260.)</small></p>
<p>1. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> Soul is further [in itself] incorporal essence, and even when in body it by no means doth depart from the essentiality peculiar to itself.</p>
<p>Its nature is, according to its essence to be for ever moving, according to its thought [to be] self-motive [purely], not moved in something, nor towards something, nor [yet] because of something.</p>
<p>For it is prior [to them] in power, and prior stands not in any need of consequents.</p>
<p>&#8220;In something,&#8221; furthermore,&#8212;means space, and time, and nature; &#8220;towards something,&#8221;&#8212;[this] means harmony, and form, and figure; &#8220;because of something,&#8221;&#8212;[this] means body, for &#146;tis because of body that there is time, and space, and nature.</p>
<p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></A></p>
<p>Now all these things are in connection with each other by means of a congenital relationship.</p>
<p>2. For instance, now, the body must have space, for it would be past all contriving that a body should exist without a space.</p>
<p>It changes, too, in nature, and &#146;tis impossible for change to be apart from time, and from the movement nature makes; nor is it further possible for there to be composing of a body apart from harmony.</p>
<p>It is because of body, then, that space exists; for that by its reception of the changes of the body, it does not let a thing that&#146;s changing pass away.</p>
<p>But, changing, it doth alternate from one thing to another, and is deprived of being in a permanent condition, but not of being body.</p>
<p>For body, <i>qu&acirc;</i> body, remains body; but any special moment of its state does not remain.</p>
<p>The body, then, keeps changing in its states.</p>
<p>3. And so, space is incorporal, and time, and natural motion; but each of these has naturally its own peculiar property.</p>
<p>The property of space is receptivity; of time [&#146;tis] interval and number; of nature [it is] motion; of harmony [&#146;tis] love; of body, change.</p>
<p>The special nature of the Soul, however, is essential thought.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
