### ZOSIMUS

##### ON THE ANTHRŌPOS-DOCTRINE

(<span class="smallcaps">Zosimus</span> flourished somewhere at the end
of the third and beginning of the fourth century A.D. He was a member of
what Reitzenstein (p. 9) calls the Poimandres-Gemeinde, and, in writing
to a certain Theosebeia, a fellow-believer in the Wisdom-tradition,
though not as yet initiated into its spiritual mysteries, he urges her
to hasten to Poimandres and baptize herself in the Cup. <span
id="fr_661"></span>[1](#fn_661) The following quotation is of first
importance for the understanding of the Anthrōpos-Doctrine or Myth of
Man in the Mysteries.

In one of the Books of his great work distinguished by the letter Omega,
and dedicated to Oceanus as the “Genesis and Seed of all the
Gods,”—speaking of the uninitiated, those still beneath the sway of the
Heimarmenē or Fate, who cannot understand his revelations,—he
writes <span id="fr_662"></span>[2](#fn_662):)

##### THE PROCESSIONS OF FATE.

1\. Such men \[our\] Hermes, in his “Concerning Nature,” hath called
mind-less,—naught but “processions” <span
id="fr_663"></span>[3](#fn_663) of

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fate,—in that they
have no notion <span id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_664) of aught of things
incorporal, or even of Fate herself who justly leads them, but they
blaspheme her corporal schoolings, and have no notion of aught else but
of her favours.

##### “THE INNER DOOR”

2\. But Hermes and Zoroaster have said the Race of Wisdom-lovers is
superior to Fate, by their neither rejoicing in her favours,—for they
have mastered pleasures,—not by their being struck down by her ills,—for
ever living at the “Inner Door,” <span id="fr_665"></span>[2](#fn_665)
and not receiving <span id="fr_666"></span>[3](#fn_666) from her her
fair gift, in that they look unto the termination of \[her\] ills. <span
id="fr_667"></span>[4](#fn_667)

3\. On which account, too, Hesiod doth introduce Prometheus counselling
Epimetheus, and doth tell him <span id="fr_668"></span>[5](#fn_668) not
to take the Gift <span id="fr_669"></span>[6](#fn_669) from Zeus who
rules Olympus, but send it back again,—\[thus\] teaching his own brother
through philosophy <span id="fr_670"></span>[7](#fn_670) to return the
Gifts of Zeus,—that is, of Fate.

4\. But Zoroaster, boasting in knowledge of all things Above, and in the
magic of embodied speech, <span id="fr_671"></span>[8](#fn_671)

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

professes that all ills of Fate,—both special \[ills\] and general
\[ones\],—are \[thus\] averted.

##### AGAINST MAGIC

5\. Hermes, however, in his “About the Inner Door,” doth deprecate
\[this\] magic even, declaring that:

The spiritual man, \[the man\] who knows himself, <span
id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_672) should not accomplish any thing by means
of magic, e’en though he think it a good thing, nor should he force
Necessity, but suffer \[her to take her course\], according to her
nature and decree <span id="fr_673"></span>[2](#fn_673); \[he should\]
progress by seeking only, through the knowledge of himself and God, to
gain the Trinity <span id="fr_674"></span>[3](#fn_674) that none can
name, and let Fate do whate’er she will to her own clay—that is, the
body.

#### FRAGMENT XXVI.

> 6\. And being so minded (he says), and so ordering his life, he shall
> behold the Son of God becoming all things for holy souls, that he may
> draw her <span id="fr_675"></span>[4](#fn_675) forth from out the
> region of the Fate into the Incorporeal \[Man\].

> 7\. For having power in all, He becometh all things, whatsoever He
> will, <span id="fr_676"></span>[5](#fn_676) and, in obedience to the
> Father\[’s nod\], through the whole Body doth He penetrate, and,
> pouring forth His Light into the mind of every \[soul\], He starts
> it <span id="fr_677"></span>[6](#fn_677)

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

> back unto the Blessed Region, <span id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_678)
> where it was before it had become corporal,—following after Him,
> yearning and led by Him unto the Light.

##### THOTH THE FIRST MAN

8\. And \[there\] shall it see the Picture <span
id="fr_679"></span>[2](#fn_679) that both Bitos hath described, and
thrice-great Plato, and ten-thousand-times-great Hermes, for Thōythos
translated <span id="fr_680"></span>[3](#fn_680) it into the first
sacred <span id="fr_681"></span>[4](#fn_681) tongue,—Thōth the First
Man, the Interpreter of all things which exist, and the Name-maker <span
id="fr_682"></span>[5](#fn_682) for all embodied things. <span
id="fr_683"></span>[6](#fn_683)

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

##### THE LIBRARIES OF THE PTOLEMIES

9\. The Chaldæans and Parthians and Medes and Hebrews call Him <span
id="fr_684"></span>[1](#fn_684) Adam, which is by interpretation virgin
Earth, and blood-red <span id="fr_685"></span>[2](#fn_685) Earth, and
fiery <span id="fr_686"></span>[3](#fn_686) Earth, and fleshly Earth.

10\. And these indications were found in the book-collections <span
id="fr_687"></span>[4](#fn_687) of the Ptolemies, which they stored away
in every temple, and especially in the Serapeum, when they invited
Asenas, the chief priest of Jerusalem, to send a “Hermes,” <span
id="fr_688"></span>[5](#fn_688) who translated the whole of the Hebrew
into Greek and Egyptian. <span id="fr_689"></span>[6](#fn_689)

11\. So the First Man is called by us Thōyth and by them Adam,—not
giving His \[true\] name in the Language of the Angels, but naming Him
symbolically according to His Body by the four elements \[or letters\]
out of His whole Sphere, <span id="fr_690"></span>[7](#fn_690) whereas
his Inner Man, the

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

spiritual, has \[also\] both an authentic name and one for common
use. <span id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_691)

##### NIKOTHEOS

12\. His authentic \[name\], however, I know not, owing to the so long
\[lapse of time <span id="fr_692"></span>[2](#fn_692)\]; for
Nikotheos <span id="fr_693"></span>[3](#fn_693) who-is-not-to-be-found
alone doth know these things.

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

But that for common use is Man (*Phōs*), <span
id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_694) from which it follows that men are
called *phōtas*.

##### FROM THE BOOK OF THE CHALDÆANS

13. <span id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_695) “When Light-Man (*Phōs*) was
in Paradise, exspiring <span id="fr_696"></span>[3](#fn_696) under the
\[presence of\] Fate, they <span id="fr_697"></span>[4](#fn_697)
persuaded Him to clothe himself in the Adam they had made, the \[Adam\]
of Fate, him of the four elements,—as though \[they said\] being free
from \[her <span id="fr_698"></span>[5](#fn_698)\] ills and free from
their <span id="fr_699"></span>[6](#fn_699) activities.

“And He, on account of this ‘freedom from ills’ did

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

not refuse; but they boasted as though He had been brought into
servitude \[to them\].” <span id="fr_700"></span>[1](#fn_700)

14\. For Hesiod said that the outer man was the “bond” <span
id="fr_701"></span>[2](#fn_701) by which Zeus bound Prometheus.

Subsequently, in addition to this bond, he sends him another,
Pandōra, <span id="fr_702"></span>[3](#fn_702) whom the Hebrews call
Eve.

For Prometheus and Epimetheus <span id="fr_703"></span>[4](#fn_703) are
one Man, according to the system of allegory,—that is, Soul and Body.

##### MAN THE MIND

And at one time He <span id="fr_704"></span>[5](#fn_704) bears the
likeness of soul, at another of mind, at another of flesh, owing to the
imperfect attention which Epimetheus paid to the counsel of Prometheus,
his own mind. <span id="fr_705"></span>[6](#fn_705)

15\. For our Mind <span id="fr_706"></span>[7](#fn_706) saith:

#### FRAGMENT XXVII.

> For that the Son of God having power in all things, becoming all
> things that he willeth, appeareth as he willeth to each. <span
> id="fr_707"></span>[8](#fn_707)

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

16\. Yea, unto the consummation of the cosmos will He come
secretly,—nay, openly associating with His own,—counselling them
secretly, yea through their minds, to settle their account with their
Adam, the blind accuser, <span id="fr_708"></span>[1](#fn_708) in
rivalry with the spiritual man of light. <span
id="fr_709"></span>[2](#fn_709)

##### THE COUNTERFEIT DAIMON

17\. And these things come to pass until the Counterfeit Daimon <span
id="fr_710"></span>[3](#fn_710) come, in rivalry with themselves, and
wishing to lead them into error, declaring that he is Son of God, being
formless in both soul and body.

But they, becoming wiser from contemplation of

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Him who is truly
Son of God, give unto him <span id="fr_711"></span>[1](#fn_711) his own
Adam for death, <span id="fr_712"></span>[2](#fn_712) rescuing their own
light spirits for \[return to\] their own regions where they were even
before the cosmos \[existed\]. <span
id="fr_713"></span>[3](#fn_713) . . .

18\. And \[it is\] the Hebrews alone and the Sacred Books of Hermes
\[which tell us\] these things about the man of light and his Guide the
Son of God, and about the earthy Adam and *his* Guide, the Counterfeit,
who doth blasphemously call himself Son of God, for leading men
astray. <span id="fr_714"></span>[4](#fn_714)

19\. But the Greeks call the earthy Adam Epimetheus, who is counselled
by his own mind, that is, his brother, not to receive the gifts of Zeus.
Nevertheless being both deceived <span id="fr_715"></span>[5](#fn_715)
and repenting, <span id="fr_716"></span>[6](#fn_716) and seeking the
Blessed Land. . . . <span id="fr_717"></span>[7](#fn_717)

But Prometheus, that is the mind, interprets all things and gives good
counsel in all things to them who have understanding and hearing. But
they who have only fleshly hearing are “processions of Fate.”

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

##### HIS ADVICE TO THEOSEBEIA

To the foregoing we may append a version of Zosimus’ advice <span
id="fr_718"></span>[1](#fn_718) to the lady Theosebeia, to which we have
already referred, as offering an instructive counterpart to *C. H.*,
xiii. (xiv.). After a sally against the “false prophets,” through whom
the daimones energize, not only requiring their offerings but also
ruining their souls, Zosimus continues:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

“But be not thou, O lady, \[thus\] distracted, as, too, I bade thee in
the actualizing \[rites\], and do not turn thyself about this way and
that in seeking after God; but in thy house be still, and God shall come
to thee, He who is everywhere and not in some wee spot as are daimonian
things.

“And having stilled thyself in body, still thou thyself in passions
too—desire, \[and\] pleasure, rage \[and\] grief, and the twelve
fates <span id="fr_719"></span>[2](#fn_719) of Death.

“And thus set straight and upright, call thou unto thyself Divinity; and
truly shall He come, He who is everywhere and \[yet\] nowhere.

“And \[then\], without invoking them, perform the sacred rites unto the
daimones,—not such as offer things to them and soothe and nourish them,
but such as turn them from thee and destroy their power, which
Mambres <span id="fr_720"></span>[3](#fn_720) taught to Solomon, King of
Jerusalem, and all that Solomon himself wrote down from his own wisdom.

“And if thou shalt effectively perform these rites,

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

thou shalt obtain the physical conditions of pure birth. And so continue
till thou perfect thy soul completely.

“And when thou knowest surely that thou art perfected in thyself, then
spurn . . . from thee <span id="fr_721"></span>[1](#fn_721) the natural
things of matter, and make for harbour in Pœmandres’ <span
id="fr_722"></span>[2](#fn_722) arms, and having dowsed thyself within
His Cup, <span id="fr_723"></span>[3](#fn_723) return again unto thy own
\[true\] race.” <span id="fr_724"></span>[4](#fn_724)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was how Zosimus understood the teaching of the Trismegistic
tradition, for he had experienced it.

by in the middle of the way without being able to do anything but take
the road from others, so do such men move in procession through the
world led by their bodies’ pleasures.”

<span id="fn_664"></span>[274:1](th342.htm#fr_664) Or “in that they

R. reads καταδέχεσθαι. I suggest καταδεχομένους.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[275:4](th342.htm#fr_675) *Sc.* the soul.

Zosimus is apparently condensing from the original.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[275:6](th342.htm#fr_677) *Sc.* the soul or

<span id="fn_678"></span>[276:1](th342.htm#fr_678) *Cf.* S., § 9 in the
Naassene Document.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[276:2](th342.htm#fr_679) πίνακα—or tablet.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[276:3](th342.htm#fr_680) Lit. translates.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[276:4](th342.htm#fr_681) Priestly or hieratic.
With this compare Syncellus’ (*Chron*., xl.) quotation, from Manetho’s
*Sothis*, which declares that the first monuments recording the
wisdom-mystery of most ancient Egypt “were engraved in the sacred
language by Thōth, the first Hermes; after the Flood they were
translated from the sacred language into the common tongue.” *Cf.* vol.
i., ch. v., on “Hermes according to Manetho.”

<span id="fn_682"></span>[276:5](th342.htm#fr_682)
ὀνοματοποιός,—referring specially to the making of names or words
corresponding to natural cries and sounds. Compare the Adam of Genesis.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[276:6](th342.htm#fr_683) *Cf.* Plato,
*Philebus*, 18 B: “Some god, or rather some godlike man, who in Egypt
their tradition says was Theuth, observing that sound was infinite,
first distinguished in this infinity a certain number of pure sounds
\[or vowels\], and then other letters \[or sound elements\] which have
sound, but are not pure sounds \[the semi-vowels\]; these two exist
\[each\] in a definite number; and lastly he distinguished a third class
of letters, which we now call mutes; and divided these, and likewise the
two other classes of vowels and semi-vowels, into their individual
elements, and told the number of them, and gave to each and all of them
the names of letters.” (*Cf*. Jowett’s Trans., 3rd ed., iv. 583, 584.)

According to the number-system of the Gnostic Marcus, there are: seven
vowels, eight semi-vowels, and nine mutes (*F. F. F.*, p. 368). It is
also of interest to notice that these elements of sound are applied to
what Marcus calls the “Configuration of *the* Element”—? Sound—(τὸ σχῆμα
τοῦ στοιχείου); they constitute the Glyph (or Character, or Impression,
or Expression) of the Figure (or Diagram) of the Man of Truth. In the
phrase “Glyph of the Figure” (ὁ χαρακτὴρ τοῦ γράμματος), the word γράμμα
means either (i) a letter of the alphabet, or (ii) a note of music, or
(iii) a mathematical figure or diagram (*ibid*., p. 367). Is there then
any connection between the Pinax of Bitos and the Diagram of the Ophites
referred to by Celsus?

<span id="fn_684"></span>[277:1](th342.htm#fr_684) *Sc.* the First Man.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[277:2](th342.htm#fr_685) Or of the nature of
blood.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[277:3](th342.htm#fr_686) Codd. πυρὰ—? πυρία.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[277:4](th342.htm#fr_687) Or libraries.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[277:5](th342.htm#fr_688) That is, a learned
priest or scribe.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[277:6](th342.htm#fr_689) Much translation of
this kind was done at that period. Compare the Arabic translation of a
“Book of Ostanes” (Berthelot, *La Chimie au Moyen Age*, iii. 121), in
which an old inscription on an Egyptian *stēlē* is quoted: “Have you not
heard the story that a certain philosopher \[*i.e*. Egyptian priest\]
wrote to the Magi in Persia, saying: ‘I have found a copy of a book of
the ancient sages; but as the book is written in Persian, I cannot read
it. Send me then one of your wise men who can read for me the book I
have found’?” R. 363.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[277:7](th342.htm#fr_690) Presumably referring
to the whole Body of the Heavenly Man, to whose Limbs all the letters
were assigned by Marcus.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[278:1](th342.htm#fr_691) προσηγορικόν,—this
signifies generally the *prœnomen* as opposed to the *nomen* proper.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[278:2](th342.htm#fr_692) διὰ τὸ τέως,—lit.
“because of the so long”; otherwise I cannot translate the phrase. This
would, then, presumably refer to the length of time since the physical
tradition of the ancient Thōyth initiates had disappeared; or the length
of time the soul of Zosimus had been revolving in Genesis.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[278:3](th342.htm#fr_693) Lit.
God-victor,—symbolizing the victory of the Inner God, or of a man who
had raised himself to the status of a god. For Nikotheos, see the
Gnostic “Untitled Apocalypse” of the Codex Brucianus (C. Schmidt, *Gnos.
Schrift. in kop. Sprach. aus d. C. B.*, p. 285), p. 12a: “Nikotheos hath
spoken of Him \[namely, the Alone-begotten,—see *ibid*., p. 601\], and
seen Him; for he is one \[*sc*. of those who have seen Him face to
face\]. He \[N.\] said: ‘The Father exists exalted above all the
perfect.’ He \[N.\] hath revealed the Invisible and the perfect
Triple-power.”

In the *Life of Plotinus*, by Porphyry (c. xiv.), among the list of
“Gnostics” against whose views on Matter the great coryphæus of Later
Platonism wrote one of the books of his *Enneads* (II. ix.), there is
mention of Nikotheos in close connection with Zoroaster and others (S.
603 ff.). If we now turn to Schmidt’s *Plotins Stellung zum Gnosticismus
und kirchlichen Christentum* (Leipzig, 1900), in which he has examined
at length the matter of the treatise of Plotinus and the passage of
Porphyry, we find him returning to the consideration of Nikotheos (pp.
58 ff.). Schmidt (p. 61) takes the “hidden Nikotheos” for a “heavenly
being,” indeed as identical with the Alone-begotten, and as, therefore,
the revealer of Himself. This Alone-begotten is the “Light-Darkness” of
p. 13a of the “Untitled Apocalypse” of *C. B*. In other words, Nikotheos
seems to be a synonym of the Triumphant Christos. See R. Liechtenhan,
*Die Offenbarung in Gnosticismus* (Gottingen, 1901), p. 31. So far for
the inner meaning; but is there possibly an outer one? As there was an
apocalypse, for the words of Nikotheos are quoted, there was a seer, a
prophet, a Christos, who had seen and handed on. It is somewhat
remarkable that one of the by-names given to Jesus (Jeschu) by
Rabbinical theological controversy was Balaam (Bileam), meaning
“Destroyer of the people.” Is there, then, any connection between
Niko-theos on the one hand and Niko-laos (the Greek equivalent of
Balaam) on the other? There are, at any rate, many other parallels in
the Talmud Jeschu-Stories of names of dishonour on the Rabbinical side
equating with names of exalted honour on the Gnostic and Christian side.
If so—dare we ask the question?—have we in the *logos* of Nikotheos a
fragment from an “Apocalypse of Jesus”?

Nay, may not Balaam-Niko-laos,—to take a lesson from the mystic
word-play of the time,—“allegorically” have symbolized on the one hand
the “victory of the many” (λαός), and on the other the “Victor of the
many,” for “people” in Philo signifies the “many” as opposed to the
“one’’ “race” (γένος) which sums up all His “limbs” in the Christ?

<span id="fn_694"></span>[279:1](th342.htm#fr_694) φὼς,—according to the
accenting of R., but φῶς would mean “Light.”

<span id="fn_695"></span>[279:2](th342.htm#fr_695) This is evidently a
quotation.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[279:3](th342.htm#fr_696) Reading διαπνεόμενος
with the Codd., and not διαπνεομένῳ with R. This means “exhaling his
light.” In the Egypto-Gnostic tradition underlying the *Pistis Sophia*,
it is the function of the Rulers of the Fate to “squeeze out” the light
from the souls and to devour it, or absorb it into themselves.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[279:4](th342.htm#fr_697) The Rulers of the
Fate.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[279:5](th342.htm#fr_698) *Sc.* Fate’s.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[279:6](th342.htm#fr_699) *Sc.* the Seven
Rulers or Energies of the Fate-sphere,—ἀνενέργητον.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[280:1](th342.htm#fr_700) This is evidently a
quotation from a Greek translation of one of the Books of the Chaldæans
(§§ 9, 10) in the Serapeum. It seems to me to be a “source” on which
both the Hebrew and non-Hebrew Hellenists commentated in Alexandria.
Thus both the commentator in S. and J. in the Naassene Document and the
Pœmandrists of the period would use it in common.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[280:2](th342.htm#fr_701) *Theog.*, 614.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[280:3](th342.htm#fr_702) *Cf*. §§ 3 and 19.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[280:4](th342.htm#fr_703) That is, Fore-thought
and After-thought.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[280:5](th342.htm#fr_704) *Sc.* Man.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[280:6](th342.htm#fr_705) I am almost persuaded
that § 14 is also a quotation or summary and not the simple exegesis of
Zosimus; the original being from the pen of some non-Hebrew Hellenistic
allegorizer.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[280:7](th342.htm#fr_706) That is, Pœmandrēs,
the Shepherd of men.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[280:8](th342.htm#fr_707) *Cf*. § 7 above;
evidently a quotation from the “Inner Door.” Compare also the *logos*
quoted by S. (§ 8) in the Naassene Document from some Hellenistic
scripture: “I become what I will, and am what I am.” Do Hermes and S.
then both depend on the same scripture, in the form of an apocalypse;
that is, does Hermes in his “expository sermon” depend on the direct
teaching of the Mind to himself, which would be instruction in the first
person?

<span id="fn_708"></span>[281:1](th342.htm#fr_708) τυφληγοροῦντος. The
lexicons do not contain the word. It is probably a play on
κατηγοροῦντος. *Cf.* note on “blind from birth” of C. in the Conclusion
of Hippolytus in “Myth of Man” (vol. i. p. 189).

<span id="fn_709"></span>[281:2](th342.htm#fr_709) That is, presumably,
though in one aspect only, the soul that sees in the Light as opposed to
the blind body. This passage reflects the same thought-atmosphere as
that which surrounds the saying underlying Matt. v. 25 (= Lk. xii.
57-59): “Agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way
with him, lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and
the judge to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Amen, I say unto
thee, thou shalt not come forth thence till thou hast paid the uttermost
farthing.” The third Evangelist, instead of the vague “agree,” preserves
the technical terms ἀπηλλάχθαι, used of the discharge of a debt (*cf*.
the technical καταλλαγὴν ἔχειν of our text), and πράκτωρ, an officer
charged with the collection of taxes and debts. This Saying was
interpreted by the Gnostics as having reference to the reincarnation of
the soul into another body in order to discharge its kārmic debts.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[281:3](th342.htm#fr_710) ὁ ἀντίμιμος δαίμων.
The term “counterfeit spirit” (ἀντίμιμον πνεῦμα) occurs frequently in
the *Pistis Sophia*.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[282:1](th342.htm#fr_711) The Counterfeit
Daimon.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[282:2](th342.htm#fr_712) Or execution.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[282:3](th342.htm#fr_713) The two last
paragraphs are apparently also quoted or summarized from a Hellenistic
commentary on a Book of the Hebrews, translated into Greek, and found in
the libraries of the Ptolemies. It is remarkable that the contents of
this book are precisely similar not only to the contents of the Books
from which J. quotes in the Naassene Document, but also to the ideas
about the Chaldæans which the commentator of S. sets forth.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[282:4](th342.htm#fr_714) If we can rely on
this statement of Zosimus, this proves that there was a developed
Anthrōpos-doctrine also in the Trismegistic Books, as apart from the
Chaldæan Books,—that is, that the Pœmandrists did not take it from the
Chaldæan Books, but had it from their own immediate line of tradition,
namely, the Egyptian.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[282:5](th342.htm#fr_715) *Cf.* 13 above.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[282:6](th342.htm#fr_716) Lit. changing his
mind.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[282:7](th342.htm#fr_717) A *lacuna* occurs in
the text. We could almost persuade ourselves that Zosimus had the text
of S. and even the source of J. before him. For “Blessed Land,” *cf*. §
7 above.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[283:1](th342.htm#fr_718) Berth., p. 244; for a
revised text see R. 214, n. 1.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[283:2](th342.htm#fr_719) The twelve tormenting
or avenging daimones of *C. H.*, xiii. (xiv.).

<span id="fn_720"></span>[283:3](th342.htm#fr_720) The famous Egyptian
Theurgist and Magician who is fabled to have contended with Moses; while
others say he was the instructor of Moses.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[284:1](th342.htm#fr_721) The soul having now
found itself wings and become the winged globe.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[284:2](th342.htm#fr_722) ἐπὶ τὸν Ποιμένανδρα
(*sic*).

<span id="fn_723"></span>[284:3](th342.htm#fr_723) *Cf.* *C. H.*, iv.
(v.) 4.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[284:4](th342.htm#fr_724) *Cf.* *C. H.*, i. 26,
29.
