#### EXCERPT VI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### OF TIME

<span class="small">(Title from Patrizzi (p. 38b); followed by: “To the
Same Tat.”</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., viii. 41, under heading: “Of
Hermes from the \[Sermons\] to Tat”; G. p. 93; M. i. 64.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. v. of “Fragments from the
Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” p. 241.)</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Now</span> to find out concerning the three
times; for they are neither by themselves, nor \[yet\] are they at-oned;
and \[yet\] again they are at-oned, and by themselves \[as well\].

For should’st thou think the present is without the past, it can’t be
present unless it has become already past. <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82)

For from the past the present comes, and from the present future goes.

But if we have to scrutinize more closely, thus let us argue:

2\. Past time doth pass into no longer being

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

this, <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83) and future \[time\] doth not
exist, in its not being present; nay, present even is not present, in
its continuing.

Time, then, which *stands* not \[steady\] (ἕστηκε), but which is on the
turn, without a central point at which to stop,—how can it be called
*in-stant* (ἐνεστώς), <span id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_84) seeing even
that it hath no power to *stand* (ἑστάναι)?

Again, past joining present, and present \[joining\] future, they
\[thus\] are one; for they are not without them <span
id="fr_85"></span>[3](#fn_85) in their sameness, and their oneness, and
their continuity.

Thus, \[then\], time’s both continuous and discontinuous, though one and
the same \[time\].

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_82"></span>[28:1](th307.htm#fr_82) That is, apparently, you
cannot *think* of the present until it is already past.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[29:1](th307.htm#fr_83) That is, apparently,
“present.”

<span id="fn_84"></span>[29:2](th307.htm#fr_84) The usual term in Greek
for “present,” but I have here translated it by “instant” in order to
keep the word-play, which would otherwise entirely vanish in
translation.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[29:3](th307.htm#fr_85) That is, apparently, any
one without the other two, or any two without the other one.
