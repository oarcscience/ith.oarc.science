#### EXCERPT XIX.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[OF SOUL, VI.\]

<span class="small">(Patrizzi (p. 41b) runs this on to the last without
a break.</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., xli. 6, under heading: “Of the
Same”—that is, “Of Hermes”; G. pp. 327, 328; M. i. 229, 230; W. i. 324,
325.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. viii. of “Fragments of the
Books of Hermes to Ammon,” pp. 269, 270.)</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Soul</span>, then, is an eternal
intellectual essence, having for purpose <span
id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_263) the reason of itself; and when it thinks
with <span id="fr_264"></span>[2](#fn_264) \[it,\] <span
id="fr_265"></span>[3](#fn_265) it doth attract \[unto itself\] the
Harmony’s intention. <span id="fr_266"></span>[4](#fn_266)

But when it leaves behind the body Nature makes, <span
id="fr_267"></span>[5](#fn_267) it bideth in and by itself,—the maker of
itself in the noëtic <span id="fr_268"></span>[6](#fn_268) world.

It ruleth its own reason, bearing in its own thought <span
id="fr_269"></span>[7](#fn_269) a motion (called by the name of life)

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

like unto \[that of\] that which cometh into life. <span
id="fr_270"></span>[1](#fn_270)

2\. For that the thing peculiar to the Soul \[is this\],—to furnish
other things with what is like its own peculiarity.

There are, accordingly, two lives, two motions:—one, that according to
the essence of the Soul; the other, that according to the nature of the
body.

The former \[is\] more general, \[the latter is more partial\]; the
\[life\] that is according unto essence has no authority but its own
self, the other \[is\] under necessity.

For every thing that’s moved, is under the necessity of that which
moveth \[it\].

The motion that doth move, however, is in close union with the love of
the noëtic essence.

For Soul must be incorporal,—essence that hath no share in any body
Nature makes.

For were it corporal, it would have neither reason nor
intelligence. <span id="fr_271"></span>[2](#fn_271)

For every body is without intelligence; but when it doth receive of
essence, it doth obtain the power of being a breathing animal.

3\. The spirit <span id="fr_272"></span>[3](#fn_272) \[hath the power to
contemplate\] the body; the reason of the essence hath the power to
contemplate the Beautiful.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

The sensible—the spirit—is that which can discern appearances. It is
distributed into the various sense-organs <span
id="fr_273"></span>[1](#fn_273); a part of it becometh spirit by means
of which we see, <span id="fr_274"></span>[2](#fn_274) \[a part\] by
means of which we hear, \[a part\] by means of which we smell, \[a
part\] by means of which we taste, \[a part\] by means of which we
touch.

This spirit, when it is led upwards by the understanding, discerns that
which is sensible <span id="fr_275"></span>[3](#fn_275); but if ’tis
not, it only maketh pictures for itself.

For it is of the body, and that, too, receptible of all \[impressions\].

4\. The reason of the essence, on the other hand, is that which is
possessed of judgment. <span id="fr_276"></span>[4](#fn_276)

The knowledge of things worthy \[to be known\] is co-existent with the
reason; \[that which is coexistent\] with the spirit \[is\] opinion.

The latter has its operation from the surrounding world; the former,
from itself.

#### COMMENT

As Exx. xvi.-xix. follow one another in Stobæus, it is highly probable
that they are all taken from the same group of sermons, and as their
contents are so similar to those of Exx. xiv. and xv., and these are
stated by

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Stobæus to be from
the “Sermons to Ammon,” we are fairly justified in grouping them all
together. How many Sermons to Ammon there may have been in the
collection used by Stobæus we have no means of knowing; they may also
perhaps have had no distinctive title; but as Stobæus usually leaves out
the titles in quoting, even when we know them from other sources, there
is no definite conclusion to be drawn from his silence.
