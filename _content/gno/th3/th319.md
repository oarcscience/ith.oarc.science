#### EXCERPT XVIII.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[OF SOUL, V.\]

<span class="small">(Patrizzi (p. 41) runs this on to the last without a
break.</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., xli. 5, under heading: “Of the
Same”—that is, “Of Hermes”; G. pp. 325-327; M. i. 229, 230; W. i.
322-324.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. vii. of “Fragments of the
Books of Hermes to Ammon,” pp. 267, 268.)</span>

1\. \[<span class="smallcaps">Now</span>\], every Soul is free from
death and in perpetual motion.

For in the General Sermons <span id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_256) we have
said some motions are by means of the activities, <span
id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_257) others are owing to the bodies.

We say, moreover, that the Soul’s produced out of a certain essence,—not
a matter,—incorporal itself, just as its essence is.

Now every thing that’s born, must of necessity be born from something.

All things, moreover, in which destruction followeth on birth, must of
necessity have two kinds of motion with them:—the \[motion\] of

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

the Soul, by which they’re moved; and body’s \[motion\], by which they
wax and wane.

Moreover, also, on the former’s dissolution, the latter <span
id="fr_258"></span>[1](#fn_258) is dissolved.

This I define, \[then,\] as the motion of bodies corruptible.

2\. The Soul, however, is in perpetual motion,—in that perpetually it
moves itself, and makes \[its\] motion active \[too\] in other things.

And so, according to this reason, every Soul is free from death, having
for motion the making active of itself.

The kinds of Souls are three:—divine, \[and\] human, \[and\] irrational.

Now the divine \[is that\] of its divine body, in which there is the
making active of itself. For it is moved in it, and moves itself.

For when it is set free from mortal lives, it separates itself from the
irrational portions of itself, departs unto the godlike body, and as
’tis in perpetual motion, is moved in its own self, with the same motion
as the universe.

3\. The human \[kind\] has also something of the godlike \[body\], but
it has joined to it as well the \[parts\] irrational,—the appetite and
heart. <span id="fr_259"></span>[2](#fn_259)

These latter also are immortal, in that they

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

happen also in themselves to be activities; but \[they are\] the
activities of mortal bodies.

Wherefore, they are removed far from the godlike portion of the Soul,
when it is in its godlike body; but when this <span
id="fr_260"></span>[1](#fn_260) enters in a mortal frame, they <span
id="fr_261"></span>[2](#fn_261) also cling to it, and by the presence
\[of these elements\] it keeps on being a human Soul.

But that of the irrationals consists of heart and appetite. And for this
cause these lives are also called irrational, through deprivation of the
reason of the Soul.

4\. You may consider, too, as a fourth \[kind\] that of the soulless,
which from without <span id="fr_262"></span>[3](#fn_262) the bodies
operates in them, and sets them moving.

But this should \[really\] be the moving of itself within its godlike
body, and the moving of these \[other\] things as it were by the way.

#### COMMENT

The mention of the General Sermons (§ 1) raises the question as to
whether or no our extract may not be from one of the Sermons to Tat, for
in all other cases these General Sermons are referred to in the
Tat-literature. The contents, however, are so similar to the extracts
from the Sermons to Ammon that we keep this excerpt with them.
