<p><small>(I have added the title, the excerpt not being found in Patrizzi.</small></p>
<p><small>Text: Stob., <i>Flor</i>., lxxx. [lxxviii.] 9, under the heading: &#8220;Of Hermes from the [Book] to Tat&#8221;; G. iii. 135; M. iii. 104, 105.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></small></p>
<p><small>M&eacute;nard, Livre IV., No. x. of &#8220;Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,&#8221; p. 256.)</small></p>
<p>[<i>Her</i>.] To understand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> God is difficult, to speak [of Him] impossible.</p>
<p>For that the Bodiless can never be expressed in body, the Perfect never can be comprehended by that which is imperfect, and that &#146;tis difficult for the Eternal to company with the ephemeral.</p>
<p>The one is for ever, the other doth pass; the one is in [the clarity of] Truth, the other in the shadow of appearance.</p>
<p>So far off from the stronger [is] the weaker,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></A></p>
<p>the lesser from the greater [is so far], as [is] the mortal [far] from the Divine.</p>
<p>It is the distance, then, between the two that dims the Vision of the Beautiful.</p>
<p>For &#146;tis with eyes that bodies can be seen, with tongue that things seen can be spoken of; but That which hath no body, that is unmanifest, and figureless, and is not made objective [to us] out of matter,&#8212;cannot be comprehended by our sense.</p>
<p>I have it in my mind, O Tat, I have it in my mind, that what cannot be spoken of, is God.</p>

<p><h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4></p>
<p>Justin Martyr quotes these opening words of our excerpt <i>verbatim</i>, assigning them to Hermes (<i>Cohort</i>., 38; Otto, ii. 122).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>The substance of the second sentence is given twice by Lactantius in Latin (<i>Div. Institt</i>., ii. 8; Ep. 4); in the second passage the Church Father also quotes verbatim the first sentence of our excerpt, and from his introductory words we learn that they were the <i>beginning</i> of a written sermon from Hermes to his son (Tat).</p>
<p>The first four sentences are also quoted in almost identical words (there being two variants of reading and two slight additions) by Cyril,&#8212;<i>Contra Julianum</i>, i. 31 (Migne, col. 549 B), who, moreover, gives some additional lines, beginning (Frag. xi.): &#8220;If, then, there be an incorporeal eye,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></A></p>
<p>If, furthermore, we are right in supposing that Frag. xv. (Cyril, <i>ibid</i>., i. 33) is from the same sermon, then this sermon is the &#8220;First Sermon of the Expository [Sermons] to Tat,&#8221; and the Stob&aelig;an heading, &#8220;From the [Book] to Tat,&#8221; will mean the collection of Expository Sermons (see Comment, on Frag. xv.).</p>
