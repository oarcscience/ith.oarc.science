### THE DEFINITIONS OF ASCLEPIUS UNTO KING AMMON

##### THE PERFECT SERMON OF ASCLEPIUS UNTO THE KING

<span class="small">(Text: R. 348-354; Pat. at end. <span
id="fr_558"></span>[1](#fn_557))</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Great</span> is the sermon (*logos*) which I
send to thee, O King—the summing up and digest, as it were, of all the
rest.

For it is not composed to suit the many’s prejudice, since it contains
much that refuteth them.

Nay, it will seem to thee as well to contradict sometimes my sermons
too.

Hermes, my master, in many a conversation, both when alone, and
sometimes, too, when Tat was there, has said, that unto those who come
across my books, their composition will seem most simple and \[most\]
clear; but, on the contrary, as ’tis unclear, and has the \[inner\]

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

meaning of its words concealed, it will be still unclearer, when,
afterwards, the Greeks will want to turn our tongue into their own,—for
this will be a very great distorting and obscuring of \[even\] what has
been \[already\] written.

2\. Turned into our own native tongue, <span
id="fr_559"></span>[1](#fn_558) the sermon (*logos*) keepeth clear the
meaning <span id="fr_560"></span>[2](#fn_559) of the words (*logoi*)
\[at any rate\].

For that its very quality of sound, the \[very\] power of the Egyptian
names, have in themselves the bringing into act of what is said.

As far as, then, thou canst, O King—(and thou canst \[do\] all
things)—keep \[this\] our sermon from translation; in order that such
mighty mysteries may not come to the Greeks, and the disdainful speech
of Greece, with \[all\] its looseness, and its surface beauty, <span
id="fr_561"></span>[3](#fn_560) so to speak, take all the strength out
of <span id="fr_562"></span>[4](#fn_561) the solemn and the strong—the
energetic <span id="fr_563"></span>[5](#fn_562) speech of Names.

The Greeks, O King, have novel words, energic of “argumentation”
\[only\]; and thus is the philosophizing of the Greeks—the noise of
words.

But we do not use words; but we use sounds full-filled with deeds.

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

3\. Thus, then, will I begin the sermon by invocation unto God, the
universals’ Lord and Maker, \[their\] Sire, and \[their\] Encompasser;
who though being All is One, <span id="fr_564"></span>[1](#fn_563) and
though being One is All; for that the Fullness of all things is One, and
\[is\] in One, this latter One not coming as a second \[One\], but both
being One.

And this is the idea <span id="fr_565"></span>[2](#fn_564) that I would
have thee keep, through the whole study of our sermon, Sire!

For should one try to separate what *seems* to be both All *and* One
*and* Same from One,—he will be found to take <span
id="fr_566"></span>[3](#fn_565) his epithet of “All” from \[the idea
of\] multitude, and not from \[that of) fullness <span
id="fr_567"></span>[4](#fn_566)—which is impossible; for if he part All
from the One, he will destroy the All. <span
id="fr_568"></span>[5](#fn_567)

For all things *must* be One—if they indeed *are* One. Yea, they are
One; and they shall never cease being One—in order that the Fullness may
not be destroyed.

\*          \*          \*          \*          \*

4\. See then in Earth a host of founts of Water and of Fire
forth-spirting in its midmost parts; in one and the same \[space all\]
the three

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

natures visible—of Fire, and Water, and of Earth, depending from one
Root. <span id="fr_569"></span>[1](#fn_568)

Whence, too, it <span id="fr_570"></span>[2](#fn_569) is believed to be
the Treasury <span id="fr_571"></span>[3](#fn_570) of every matter. It
sendeth forth of its <span id="fr_572"></span>[4](#fn_571) abundance,
and in the place \[of what it sendeth forth\] receiveth the subsistence
from above. <span id="fr_573"></span>[5](#fn_572)

For thus the Demiurge <span id="fr_574"></span>[6](#fn_573)—I mean the
Sun—eternally doth order Heaven and Earth, pouring down Essence, <span
id="fr_575"></span>[7](#fn_574) and taking Matter up, drawing both round
Himself and to Himself all things, and from Himself giving all things to
all.

For He it is whose goodly energies extend not only through the Heaven
and the Air, but also onto Earth, right down unto the lowest Depth and
the Abyss.

6\. And if there be an Essence which the mind alone can grasp, <span
id="fr_576"></span>[8](#fn_575) this is his Substance, <span
id="fr_577"></span>[9](#fn_576) the reservoir <span
id="fr_578"></span>[10](#fn_577) of which would be His Light.

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

But whence this \[Substance\] doth arise, or floweth forth, He, \[and
He\] only, knows.

\*          \*          \*          \*          \*

Or rather, in space and nature, He is near unto Himself . . . though as
He is not seen by us, . . . understand \[Him\] by conjecture. <span
id="fr_579"></span>[1](#fn_578)

7\. The spectacle of Him, however, is not left unto conjecture; nay
\[for\] His very rays, <span id="fr_580"></span>[2](#fn_579) in greatest
splendour, shine all round on all the Cosmos that doth lie above and lie
below.

For He is stablished in the midst, wreathed with the Cosmos, <span
id="fr_581"></span>[3](#fn_580) and just as a good charioteer, He safely
drives the cosmic team, <span id="fr_582"></span>[4](#fn_581) and holds
them in unto Himself, <span id="fr_583"></span>[5](#fn_582) lest they
should run away in dire disorder.

The reins are Life, and Soul, and Spirit, Deathlessness, and Genesis.

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

He lets it, then, drive \[round\] not far off from Himself—nay, if the
truth be said, together with Himself.

8\. And in this way He operates <span id="fr_584"></span>[1](#fn_583)
all things. To the immortals He distributeth perpetual permanence; and
with the upper hemisphere of His own Light—all that he sends above from
out His other side, <span id="fr_585"></span>[2](#fn_584) \[the side of
him\] which looks to Heaven—He nourisheth the deathless parts of Cosmos.

But with that side that sendeth down \[its Light\], and shineth round
all of the hemisphere <span id="fr_586"></span>[3](#fn_585) of Water,
and of Earth, and Air, He vivifieth, and by births and changes keepeth
in movement to and fro the animals <span id="fr_587"></span>[4](#fn_586)
in these \[the lower\] parts of Cosmos. . . .

9\. He changes them in spiral fashion, and doth transform them into one
another, genus to genus, species into species, their mutual changes into
one another being balanced—just as He does when He doth deal with the
Great Bodies.

For in the case of every body, \[its\] permanence \[consists in\]
transformation.

In case of an immortal one, there is no

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

dissolution; but when it is a mortal one, it is accompanied with
dissolution. <span id="fr_588"></span>[1](#fn_587)

And this is how the deathless body doth differ from the mortal, and how
the mortal one doth differ from the deathless.

10\. Moreover, as His Light’s continuous, so is His Power of giving Life
to lives continuous, and not to be brought to an end in space or in
abundance.

For there are many choirs of daimons round Him, like unto hosts of very
various kinds; who though they dwell with mortals, yet are not far from
the immortals; but having as their lot from here unto the spaces of the
Gods, <span id="fr_589"></span>[2](#fn_588) they watch o’er the affairs
of men, and work out things appointed by the Gods—by means of storms,
whirlwinds and hurricanes, by transmutations wrought by fire and
shakings of the earth, <span id="fr_590"></span>[3](#fn_589) with
famines also and with wars requiting \[man’s\] impiety,—for this is in
man’s case the greatest ill against the Gods.

11\. For that the duty of the Gods is to give benefits; the duty of
mankind is to give worship <span id="fr_591"></span>[4](#fn_590); the
duty of the daimons is to give requital.

For as to all the other things men do, through

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

error, or foolhardiness, or by necessity, which they call Fate, <span
id="fr_592"></span>[1](#fn_591) or ignorance—these are not held
requitable among the Gods; impiety alone is guilty at their bar.

12\. The Sun is the preserver <span id="fr_593"></span>[2](#fn_592) and
the nurse of every class. <span id="fr_594"></span>[3](#fn_593)

And just as the Intelligible World, <span
id="fr_595"></span>[4](#fn_594) holding the Sensible in its embrace,
fills it \[all\] full, distending it with forms of every kind and every
shape—so, too, the Sun distendeth all in Cosmos, affording births to
all, and strengtheneth them.

When they are weary or they fail, He takes them in His arms again.

13\. And under Him is ranged the choir of daimons—or, rather, choirs;
for these are multitudinous and very varied, ranked underneath the
groups of Stars, <span id="fr_596"></span>[5](#fn_595) in equal number
with each one of them.

So, marshalled in their ranks, they are the ministers of each one of the
Stars, being in their natures good, and bad, that is, in their
activities (for that a daimon’s essence is activity); while

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

some of them are \[of\] mixed \[natures\], good and bad.

14\. To all of these has been allotted the authority o’er things upon
the Earth; and it is they who bring about the multifold confusion of the
turmoils on the Earth—for states and nations generally, and for each
individual separately.

For they do shape our souls like to themselves, and set them moving with
them,—obsessing nerves, and marrow, veins and arteries, the brain
itself, down to the very heart. <span id="fr_597"></span>[1](#fn_596)

15\. For on each one of us being born and made alive, the daimons take
hold on us—those \[daimones\] who are in service at that moment \[of the
wheel\] of Genesis, who are ranged under each one of the Stars. <span
id="fr_598"></span>[2](#fn_597)

For that these change at every moment; they do not stay the same, but
circle back again.

These, then, descending through the body <span
id="fr_599"></span>[3](#fn_598) to the two parts <span
id="fr_600"></span>[4](#fn_599) of the soul, set it <span
id="fr_601"></span>[5](#fn_600) awhirling, each one towards its own
activity.

But the soul’s rational part is set above the lordship of the
daimons—designed to be receptacle of God.

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

16\. Who then doth have a Ray shining upon him through the Sun within
his rational part—and these in all are few on them the daimons do not
act; for no one of the daimons or of Gods has any power against one Ray
of God.

As for the rest, they are all led and driven, soul and body, by the
daimons—loving and hating the activities of these.

The reason (*logos*), \[then,\] is not the love that is deceived and
that deceives. <span id="fr_602"></span>[1](#fn_601)

The daimons, therefore, exercise the whole of this terrene
economy, <span id="fr_603"></span>[2](#fn_602) using our bodies as
\[their\] instruments.

And this economy Hermes has called Heimarmenē. <span
id="fr_604"></span>[3](#fn_603)

17\. The World Intelligible, <span id="fr_605"></span>[4](#fn_604) then,
depends from God; the Sensible from the Intelligible \[World\].

The Sun, through the Intelligible and the Sensible Cosmos, pours forth
abundantly the stream from God of Good,—that is, the demiurgic
operation.

And round the Sun are the Eight Spheres, dependent from Him—the
\[Sphere\] of the

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Non-wandering
Ones, the Six \[Spheres\] of the Wanderers, and one Circumterrene.

And from the Spheres depend the daimones; and from these, men.

And thus all things and all \[of them\] depend from God. <span
id="fr_606"></span>[1](#fn_605)

18\. Wherefore God is the Sire of all; the Sun’s \[their\] Demiurge; the
Cosmos is the instrument of demiurgic operation.

Intelligible Essence regulateth Heaven; and Heaven, the Gods; the
daimones, ranked underneath the Gods, regulate men.

This is the host <span id="fr_607"></span>[2](#fn_606) of Gods and
daimones. <span id="fr_608"></span>[3](#fn_607)

Through these God makes all things for His own self.

And all \[of them\] are parts of God; and if they all \[are\]
parts—then, God is all.

Thus, making all, He makes Himself; nor ever can He cease \[His
making\], for He Himself is ceaseless. <span
id="fr_609"></span>[4](#fn_608)

Just, then, as God doth have no end and no beginning, so doth His making
have no end and no beginning. <span id="fr_610"></span>[5](#fn_609)

S. A.*, but the pages are unnumbered.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[267:1](th231.htm#fr_559) This presumably means
from the hieroglyphic into the demotic—τῇ πατρῷᾳ διαλέκτῳ ἐρμηνευόμενος.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[267:2](th231.htm#fr_560) Lit. the mind.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[267:3](th231.htm#fr_561) Or, perhaps,
smartness.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[267:4](th231.htm#fr_562) Make jejune, so to
say—ἐξίτηλον ποιήσῃ.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[267:5](th231.htm#fr_563) That is, “words of
power,” words that *do* things.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[268:1](th231.htm#fr_564) *Cf.* R. 127, 3; and
*P. S. A.*, i. 1.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[268:2](th231.htm#fr_565) Lit. mind.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[268:3](th231.htm#fr_566) The construction is
very elliptical; ἐκδεξάμενος simply.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[268:4](th231.htm#fr_567) That is,
completeness, perfection,—πληρώματος.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[268:5](th231.htm#fr_568) *Cf.* Plato, *Soph.*,
259 D, E.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[269:1](th231.htm#fr_569) *Cf.* *P. S. A.*, iv.
1.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[269:2](th231.htm#fr_570) *Sc.* Earth.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[269:3](th231.htm#fr_571) A magazine, a
store-house,—ταμιεῖον. The term “treasure” (θησαυρός) is found in most
lavish use in the Greek-Coptic Gnostic works, and also in Christian
Gnostic literature and Jewish Apocalyptic.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[269:4](th231.htm#fr_572) *Sc.* matter’s.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[269:5](th231.htm#fr_573) τὴν ἄνωθεν
ὕπαρξιν,—*hyparxis*, substance or subsistence, a word of frequent use
and highly technical meaning with the last of the Neo-Platonists,
especially with Proclus. *Cf.* *C. H.*, x. (xi.) 2.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[269:6](th231.htm#fr_574) *Cf.* *P. S. A.*,
xxix. 4.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[269:7](th231.htm#fr_575) Lit. bringing or
drawing down; κατάγειν = *deducere, elicere*—used frequently of magic
arts.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[269:8](th231.htm#fr_576) νοητὴ οὐσία =
*intelligibilis essentia.*

<span id="fn_576"></span>[269:9](th231.htm#fr_577) ὄγκος = moles, mass,
bulk, volume; in later philosophy it means “atom,” and may mean so here,
of course in the philosophical and mystic and not in the physical sense.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[269:10](th231.htm#fr_578) ὑποδοχή =
receptaculum.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[270:1](th231.htm#fr_579) The text is very
corrupt. Patrizzi translates: “*Vel quia ipso loco, et natura prope se
ipsum existens, non a nobis conspicitur cogit nos per conjecturas
intelligere*”—which certainly does not represent the Greek. Ménard
conjectures brilliantly but in entire emancipation from the text: “*Pour
comprendre par induction ce qui se dérobe à notre vue, il faudrait être
près de lui et analogue à sa nature.*” Reitzenstein discovers two
lacunas in the text, but does not attempt to fill them. As the text
stands, then, all attempt at translation seems hopeless.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[270:2](th231.htm#fr_580) Lit. his very
sight,—αὐτὴ ἡ ὄψις, that is, his rays, ὄψις being used of the visual
rays which were supposed by the science of the time to proceed from the
eyes. *Cf.* Ex. vii. 4.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[270:3](th231.htm#fr_581) Wearing the Cosmos as
a wreath or crown; the visible sun being regarded as a “head.” See “The
Perfect Sermon.”

<span id="fn_581"></span>[270:4](th231.htm#fr_582) Lit. car or
chariot—ἅρμα.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[270:5](th231.htm#fr_583) Lit. binds it to
himself—ἀναδήσας εἰς ἑαυτόν.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[271:1](th231.htm#fr_584) δημιουργεῖ.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[271:2](th231.htm#fr_585) Lit. part.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[271:3](th231.htm#fr_586) κύτος = a, hollow,
vase, or vessel.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[271:4](th231.htm#fr_587) That is, those lives
subject to death, as opposed to the immortals.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[272:1](th231.htm#fr_588) Compare “Sermon to
Tat,” I. (Ménard). *Cf.* Stob., *Ecl*, i. 61; 274, 24 W.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[272:2](th231.htm#fr_589) Lit. “the land of
these”—that is, of the immortals.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[272:3](th231.htm#fr_590) *Cf.* Ex. ix. 5.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[272:4](th231.htm#fr_591) Or, to be pious.
*Cf.* *P. S. A.*, ix. 1.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[273:1](th231.htm#fr_592) εἱμαρμένην.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[273:2](th231.htm#fr_593) σωτήρ.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[273:3](th231.htm#fr_594) Or genus.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[273:4](th231.htm#fr_595) Or Cosmos.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[273:5](th231.htm#fr_596) ὑπὸ τὰς τῶν ἀστέρων
πλινθίδας. πλινθίς = πλινθίον, and is used of any rectangular figure,
and also of groups of stars as in Eratosth. *apud* Strab., II. i. 35; v.
36 (*Lex.* Sophocles); compare αἱ τῶν πλινθίων ὑπογραφαί, the fields, or
spaces, into which the Augurs divided the heavens, *templa*, or
*regiones coeli* (*Lex.* Liddell and Scott).

<span id="fn_596"></span>[274:1](th231.htm#fr_597) Lit. viscera.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[274:2](th231.htm#fr_598) *Cf.* *P. S. A.*,

parts, “passion” and “desire” (θυμὸς and ἐπιθυμία).

<span id="fn_600"></span>[274:5](th231.htm#fr_601) The soul.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[275:1](th231.htm#fr_602) This Erōs is the
lower love (*cf.* *C. H.*, i. 18: “love, the cause of death”), not the
Divine Love who inspires Hermes in “The Perfect Sermon” and who is
mentioned *C. H.*, xviii. 14.
