<p>3. [XI. M.] All things, then, being thus,</p>
<p><a name="page_368"><font size="1" color="green">p. 368</font></A></p>
<p>there&#146;s nothing stable, nothing fixed, nothing immoveable, of things that are being born, in Heaven or on the Earth.</p>
<p>Immoveable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_886"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> [is] God alone, and rightly [He] alone; for He Himself is in Himself, and by Himself, and round Himself, completely full and perfect.</p>
<p>He is His own immoveable stability. Nor by the pressure of some other one can He be moved, nor in the space [of anyone].</p>
<p>4. For in Him are all [spaces], and He Himself alone is in them all; unless someone should venture to assert that God&#146;s own motion&#146;s in Eternity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; nay, rather, it is just Immoveable Eternity itself, back into which the motion of all times is funded, and out of which the motion of all times takes its beginning.</p>
<p><h4 align="center">XXXI</h4></p>
<p>1. God, then, hath [ever] been unchanging,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and ever, in like fashion, with Himself hath the Eternity consisted,&#8212;having within itself Cosmos ingenerate, which we correctly call [God] Sensible.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>
<p>Of that [transcendent] Deity this Image&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> hath been made,&#8212;Cosmos the imitator of Eternity.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_369"><font size="1" color="green">p. 369</font></A></p>
<p>Time, further, hath the strength and nature of its own stability, in spite of its being in perpetual motion,&#8212;from its necessity of [ever] from itself reverting to itself.</p>
<p>2. And so, although Eternity is stable, motionless, and fixed, still, seeing that the movement of [this] Time (which is subject to motion) is ever being recalled into Eternity,&#8212;and for that reason Time&#146;s mobility is circular,&#8212;it comes to pass that the Eternity itself, although in its own self, is motionless, [yet] on account of Time, in which it is&#8212;(and it <i>is</i> in it),&#8212;it seems to be in movement as all motion.</p>
<p>So that it comes to pass, that both Eternity&#146;s stability becometh moved, and Time&#146;s mobility becometh stable.</p>
<p>So may we ever hold that God Himself is moved into Himself by [ever-] same transcendency of motion.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>For that stability is in His vastness motion motionless; for by His vastness is [His] law exempt from change.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>
<p>3. That, then, which so transcends, which is not subject unto sense, [which is] beyond all bounds, [and which] cannot be grasped,&#8212;That</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_370"><font size="1" color="green">p. 370</font></A></p>
<p>transcends all appraisement; That cannot be supported, nor borne up, nor can it be tracked out.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>For where, and when, and whence, and how, and what, He is,&#8212;is known to none.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> For He&#146;s borne up by [His] supreme stability, and His stability is in Himself [alone],&#8212;whether [this mystery] be God, or the Eternity, or both, or one in other, or both in either.</p>
<p>4. And for this cause, just as Eternity transcends the bounds of Time; so Time [itself], in that it cannot have bounds set to it by number, or by change, or by the period of the revolution of some second [kind of Time],&#8212;is of the nature of Eternity.</p>
<p>Both, then, seem boundless, both eternal. And so stability, though naturally fixed, yet seeing that it can sustain the things that are in motion,&#8212;because of all the good it does by reason of its firmness, deservedly doth hold the chiefest place.</p>
<p><h4 align="center">XXXII</h4></p>
<p>1. The principals of all that are, are, therefore, God and &AElig;on.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>
<p>The Cosmos, on the other hand, in that &#146;tis moveable, is not a principal.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_371"><font size="1" color="green">p. 371</font></A></p>
<p>For its mobility exceeds its own stability by treating the immoveable fixation as the law of everlasting movement.</p>
<p>The Whole Sense,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> then, of the Divinity, though like [to Him] in its own self immoveable, doth set itself in motion within its own stability.</p>
<p>&#146;Tis holy, incorruptible, and everlasting, and if there can be any better attribute to give to it, [&#146;tis its],&#8212;Eternity of God supreme, in Truth itself subsisting, the Fullness of all things, of Sense, and of the whole of Science, consisting, so to say, with God.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>
<p>2. The Cosmic Sense is the container&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of all sensibles, [all] species, and [all] sciences.</p>
<p>The human [higher sense consists] in the retentiveness of memory, in that it can recall all things that it hath done.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_372"><font size="1" color="green">p. 372</font></A></p>
<p>For only just as far as the man-animal has the divinity of Sense&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> descended; in that God hath not willed the highest Sense divine should be commingled with the rest of animals; lest it should blush for shame&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on being mingled with the other lives.</p>
<p>For whatsoever be the quality, or the extent, of the intelligence of a man&#146;s Sense, the whole of it consists in power of recollecting what is past.</p>
<p>It is through his retentiveness of memory, that man&#146;s been made the ruler of the earth.</p>
<p>3. Now the intelligence of Nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> can be won by quality of Cosmic Sense,&#8212;from all the things in Cosmos which sense can perceive.</p>
<p>Concerning [<i>this</i>] Eternity, which is the second [one],&#8212;the Sense of this we get from out the senses&#146; Cosmos, and we discern its quality [by the same means].</p>
<p>But the intelligence of Quality [itself], the &#8220;Whatness&#8221; of the Sense of God Supreme, is Truth alone,&#8212;of which [pure] Truth not even the most tenuous sketch, or [faintest] shade, in Cosmos is discerned.</p>
<p>For where is aught [of it] discerned by measurement of times,&#8212;wherein are seen untruths, and births [-and-deaths], and errors?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_373"><font size="1" color="green">p. 373</font></A></p>
<p>4. Thou seest, then, Asclepius, on what we are [already] founded, with what we occupy ourselves, and after what we dare to strive.</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p>But unto Thee, O God most high, I give my thanks, in that Thou hast enlightened me with Light to see Divinity!</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p>And ye, O Tat, Asclepius and Ammon, in silence hide the mysteries divine within the secret places of your hearts,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and breathe no word of their concealment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!</p>
<p>5. Now in our case the intellect doth differ from the sense in this,&#8212;that by the mind&#146;s extension intellect can reach to the intelligence and the discernment of the quality of Cosmic Sense.</p>
<p>The Intellect of Cosmos, on the other hand, extends to the Eternity and to the Gnosis of the Gods who are above itself.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>
<p>And thus it comes to pass for men, that we perceive the things in Heaven, as it were through a mist, as far as the condition of the human sense allows.</p>
<p>&#146;Tis true that the extension [of the mind] which we possess for the survey of such transcendent things, is very narrow [still]; but [it</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_374"><font size="1" color="green">p. 374</font></A></p>
<p>will be] most ample when it shall perceive with the felicity of [true] self-consciousness.</p>

This was explained by the Gnostic Ptolemy, somewhere about the middle of the second century, as &#8220;at-one-ment with God,&#8221; in his exegesis of the opening words, which he glosses as: &#8220;The at-one-ment with each other, together with their at-one-ment with the Father&#8221; (&#7969; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#942;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#7940;&#956;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945; &#7957;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;).
