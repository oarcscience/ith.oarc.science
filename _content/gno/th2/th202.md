### PŒMANDRES, THE SHEPHERD OF MEN

<span class="small">(Text: R. 328-338; P. 1-18; Pat. 5b-8.) <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">It</span> chanced once on a time my mind was
meditating on the things that are, <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) my
thought was raised to a great height, the senses of my body being held
back—just as men are who are weighed down with sleep after a fill of
food, or from fatigue of body.

Methought a Being more than vast, in size beyond all bounds, called out
my name and saith: What wouldst thou hear and see, and what hast thou in
mind to learn and know?

2\. And I do say: Who art thou?

He saith: I am Man-Shepherd, <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2) Mind of
all-

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

masterhood <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3); I know what thou desirest
and I’m with thee everywhere.

3\. \[And\] I reply: I long to learn the things that are, and comprehend
their nature, and know God. This is, I said, what I desire to hear.

He answered back to me: Hold in thy mind all thou wouldst know, and I
will teach thee.

4\. E’en with these words His aspect changed, <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4) and straightway, in the twinkling of an eye,
all things were opened to me, and I see a Vision limitless, all things
turned into Light,—sweet, joyous \[Light\]. And I became transported as
I gazed.

But in a little while Darkness came settling down on part \[of it\],
awesome and gloomy, coiling in sinuous folds, <span
id="fr_5"></span>[3](#fn_5) so that methought it like unto a
snake. <span id="fr_6"></span>[4](#fn_6)

And then the Darkness changed into some sort of a Moist Nature, tossed
about beyond all power of words, belching out smoke as from a

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

fire, and groaning forth a wailing sound that beggars all description.

\[And\] after that an outcry inarticulate came forth from it, as though
it were a Voice of Fire.

5\. \[Thereon\] out of the Light . . . <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7)
a Holy Word (*Logos*) <span id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8) descended on
that Nature. And upwards to the height from the Moist Nature leaped
forth pure Fire; light was it, swift and active too.

The Air, too, being light, followed after the Fire; from out the
Earth-and-Water rising up to Fire so that it seemed to hang therefrom.

But Earth-and-Water stayed so mingled each with other, that Earth from
Water no one could discern. <span id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9) Yet were
they moved to hear by reason of the Spirit-Word (*Logos*) pervading
them.

6\. Then saith to me Man-Shepherd: Didst understand this Vision what it
means?

Nay; that *shall* I know, I said.

That Light, He said, am I, thy God, Mind, prior to Moist Nature which
appeared from Darkness; the Light-Word (*Logos*) \[that appeared\] from
Mind is Son of God.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

What then?—say I.

Know that what sees in thee <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10) and
hears is the Lord’s Word (*Logos*); but Mind is Father-God. Not separate
are they the one from other; just in their union \[rather\] is it Life
consists.

Thanks be to Thee, I said.

So, understand the Light \[He answered\], and make friends with it.

7\. And speaking thus He gazed for long into my eyes, <span
id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11) so that I trembled at the look of Him.

But when He raised His head, I see in Mind the Light, \[but\] now in
Powers no man could number, and Cosmos <span
id="fr_12"></span>[3](#fn_12) grown beyond all bounds, and that the Fire
was compassed round about by a most mighty Power, and \[now\] subdued
had come unto a stand.

And when I saw these things I understood by reason of Man-Shepherd’s
Word (*Logos*).

8\. But as I was in great astonishment, He saith to me again: Thou didst
behold in Mind the Archetypal Form whose being is before beginning
without end. Thus spake to me Man-Shepherd.

And I say: Whence then have Nature’s elements their being?

To this He answer gives: From Will of God.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[Nature <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13)\] received the Word (*Logos*), and gazing
on the Cosmos Beautiful <span id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14) did copy it,
making herself into a cosmos, by means of her own elements and by the
births of souls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

9\. And God-the-Mind, being male and female both, as Light and Life
subsisting, brought forth another Mind to give things form, who, God as
he was of Fire and Spirit, <span id="fr_15"></span>[3](#fn_15) formed
Seven Rulers who enclose the cosmos that the sense perceives. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[4](#fn_16) Men call their ruling Fate. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[5](#fn_17)

10\. Straightway from out the downward elements God’s Reason
(*Logos*) <span id="fr_18"></span>[6](#fn_18) leaped up to Nature’s pure
formation, and was at-oned with the Formative Mind; for it was
co-essential with it. <span id="fr_19"></span>[7](#fn_19) And Nature’s
downward elements were thus left reason-less, so as to be pure matter.

11\. Then the Formative Mind (\[at-oned\] with Reason), he who surrounds
the spheres and spins them with his whirl, set turning his formations,
and let them turn from a beginning boundless unto an endless end. For
that the circulation

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

of these \[spheres\] begins where it doth end, as Mind doth will.

And from the downward elements Nature brought forth lives reason-less;
for He did not extend the Reason (*Logos*) \[to them\]. The Air brought
forth things winged; the Water things that swim, and Earth-and-Water one
from another parted, as Mind willed. And from her bosom Earth produced
what lives she had, four-footed things and reptiles, beasts wild and
tame.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

12\. But All-Father Mind, being Life and Light, did bring forth
Man <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20) co-equal to Himself, with whom
He fell in love, as being His own child; for he was beautiful beyond
compare, the Image of his Sire. In very truth, God fell in love with His
own Form <span id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21); and on him did bestow all
of His own formations.

13\. And when he gazed upon what the Enformer had created in the Father,
\[Man\] too wished to enform; and \[so\] assent was given him by the
Father. <span id="fr_22"></span>[3](#fn_22)

Changing his state to the formative sphere, <span
id="fr_23"></span>[4](#fn_23) in that he was to have his whole
authority, <span id="fr_24"></span>[5](#fn_24) he

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

gazed upon his Brother’s creatures. <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25)
They fell in love with him, and gave him each a share of his own
ordering. <span id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26)

And after that he had well-learned their essence and had become a sharer
in their nature, he had a mind to break right through the Boundary of
their spheres, and to subdue <span id="fr_27"></span>[3](#fn_27) the
might of that which pressed upon the Fire. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[4](#fn_28)

14\. So he who hath the whole authority o’er \[all\] the mortals in the
cosmos and o’er its lives irrational, bent his face downwards
through <span id="fr_29"></span>[5](#fn_29) the Harmony, <span
id="fr_30"></span>[6](#fn_30) breaking right through its strength, and
showed to downward Nature God’s fair Form.

And when she saw that Form of beauty which can never satiate, and him
who \[now\] possessed within himself each single energy of \[all seven\]
Rulers as well as God’s \[own\] Form, she smiled with love; for ’twas as
though she’d seen the image of Man’s fairest form upon her Water, his
shadow on her Earth.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

He in his turn beholding the form like to himself, existing in her, in
her Water, loved it and willed to live in it; and with the will came
act, <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31) and \[so\] he vivified the form
devoid of reason.

And Nature took the object of her love and wound herself completely
round him, and they were intermingled, for they were lovers.

15\. And this is why beyond all creatures on the earth man is twofold;
mortal because of body, but because of the essential Man immortal.

Though deathless and possessed of sway o’er all, yet doth he suffer as a
mortal doth, subject to Fate.

Thus though above the Harmony, within the Harmony he hath become a
slave. Though male-female, <span id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32) as from a
Father male-female, and though he’s sleepless from a sleepless \[Sire\],
yet is he overcome \[by sleep\].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

16\. Thereon \[I say: Teach on\], <span id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33) O
Mind of me, for I myself as well <span id="fr_34"></span>[4](#fn_34) am
amorous of the Word (*Logos*).

The Shepherd said: This is the mystery kept hid until this day.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

Nature embraced by Man brought forth a wonder, oh so wonderful. For as
he had the nature of the Concord <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35) of
the Seven, who, as I said to thee, \[were made\] of Fire and
Spirit <span id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_36)—Nature delayed not, but
immediately brought forth seven “men,” in correspondence with the
natures of the Seven, male-female and moving in the air. <span
id="fr_37"></span>[3](#fn_37)

Thereon \[I said\]: O Shepherd, . . . <span
id="fr_38"></span>[4](#fn_38); for now I’m filled with great desire and
long to hear; do not run off. <span id="fr_39"></span>[5](#fn_39)

The Shepherd said: Keep silence, for not as yet have I unrolled for thee
the first discourse (*logos*).

Lo! I am still, I said.

17\. In such wise then, as I have said, the generation of these seven
came to pass. Earth was as woman, her Water filled with longing;
ripeness she took from Fire, spirit from Æther. Nature thus brought
forth frames to suit the form of Man.

And Man from Life and Light changed into soul and mind,—from Life to
soul, from Light to mind.

And thus continued all the sense-world’s

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

parts <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40) until the period of their end
and new beginnings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

18\. Now listen to the rest of the discourse (*logos*) which thou dost
long to hear.

The period being ended, the bond that bound them all was loosened by
God’s Will. For all the animals being male-female, at the same time with
man were loosed apart; some became partly male, some in like fashion
\[partly\] female. And straightway God spake by His Holy Word (*Logos*):

“Increase ye in increasing, and multiply in multitude, ye creatures and
creations all; and man that hath Mind in him, let him learn to know that
he himself is deathless, and that the cause of death is love, <span
id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41) though Love is all.” <span
id="fr_42"></span>[3](#fn_42)

19\. When He said this, His Forethought <span
id="fr_43"></span>[4](#fn_43) did by means of Fate and Harmony effect
their couplings and their generations founded. And so all things were
multiplied according to their kind.

And he who thus hath learned to know himself, hath reached that Good
which doth transcend abundance; but he who through a love that leads
astray, expends his love upon his body,—

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

he stays in Darkness wandering, <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44) and
suffering through his senses things of Death.

20\. What is the so great fault, said I, the ignorant commit, that they
should be deprived of deathlessness?

Thou seem’st, he said, O thou, not to have given heed to what thou
heardest. Did not I bid thee *think?*

Yea do I think, and I remember, and therefore give Thee thanks.

If thou didst think \[thereon\], \[said He\], tell me: Why do they merit
death who are in Death?

It is because the gloomy Darkness is the root and base of the material
frame; from it <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45) came the Moist
Nature; from this <span id="fr_46"></span>[3](#fn_46) the body in the
sense-world was composed; and from this \[body\] Death doth the Water
drain.

21\. Right was thy thought, O thou! But how doth “he who knows himself,
go unto Him,” as God’s Word (*Logos*) hath declared?

And I reply: the Father of the universals doth consist of Light and
Life, and from Him Man was born.

Thou sayest well, \[thus\] speaking. Light and Life is Father-God, and
from Him Man was born.

If then thou learnest that thou *art* thyself of

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Life and Light,
and that thou \[only\] *happen’st* to be out of them, thou shalt return
again to Life. Thus did Man-Shepherd speak.

But tell me further, Mind of me, I cried, *how* shall *I* come to Life
again . . . . for God doth say: “The man who hath Mind in him, let him
learn to know that he himself \[is deathless\].”

22\. Have not all men then Mind?

Thou sayest well, O thou, thus speaking. I, Mind, myself am present with
holy men and good, the pure and merciful, men who live piously.

\[To such\] my presence doth become an aid, and straightway they gain
gnosis of all things, and win the Father’s love by their pure lives, and
give Him thanks, invoking on Him blessings, and chanting hymns, intent
on Him with ardent love.

And ere they give the body up unto its proper death, they turn them with
disgust from its sensations, from knowledge of what things they
operate. <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47) Nay, it is I, the Mind,
that will not let the operations which befall the body, work to their
\[natural\] end. For being door-keeper I’ll close up \[all\] the
entrances, and cut the mental actions off which base and evil energies
induce.

23\. But to the Mind-less ones, the wicked and depraved, the envious and
covetous, and those who murder do and love impiety, I am far off,

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

yielding my place to the Avenging Daimon, who sharpening the fire,
tormenteth him and addeth fire to fire upon him, and rusheth on him
through his senses, thus rendering him the readier for transgressions of
the law, so that he meets with greater torment; nor doth he ever cease
to have desire for appetites inordinate, insatiately striving in the
dark. <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48)

24\. Well hast thou taught me all, as I desired, O Mind. And now, pray,
tell me further of the nature of the Way Above as now it is \[for
me\]. <span id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49)

To this Man-Shepherd said: When thy material body is to be dissolved,
first thou surrenderest the body by itself unto the work of change, and
thus the form thou hadst doth vanish, and thou surrenderest thy way of
life, <span id="fr_50"></span>[3](#fn_50) void of its energy, unto the
Daimon. <span id="fr_51"></span>[4](#fn_51) The body’s senses next pass
back into their sources, becoming separate, and resurrect as energies;
and passion and desire <span id="fr_52"></span>[5](#fn_52) withdraw unto
that nature which is void of reason.

25\. And thus it is that man doth speed his way thereafter upwards
through the Harmony.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

To the first zone he gives the Energy of Growth and Waning; unto the
second \[zone\], Device of Evils \[now\] de-energized <span
id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53); unto the third, the Guile of the Desires
de-energized; unto the fourth, his Domineering Arrogance, \[also\]
de-energized; unto the fifth, unholy Daring and the Rashness of
Audacity, de-energized; unto the sixth, Striving for Wealth by evil
means, deprived of its aggrandisement; and to the seventh zone,
Ensnaring Falsehood, de-energized. <span id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54)

26\. And then, with all the energizings of the Harmony stript from him,
clothed in his proper Power, he cometh to that Nature which belongs unto
the Eighth, <span id="fr_55"></span>[3](#fn_55) and there with
those-that-are hymneth the Father.

They who are there welcome his coming there with joy; and he, made like
to them that sojourn there, doth further hear the Powers who are above
the Nature that belongs unto the Eighth, singing their songs of praise
to God in language of their own.

And then they, in a band, <span id="fr_56"></span>[4](#fn_56) go to the
Father home; of their own selves they make surrender of themselves to
Powers, and \[thus\] becoming Powers they are in God. This the good end
for

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

those who have gained Gnosis—to be made one with God.

Why shouldst thou then delay? Must it not be, since thou hast all
received, that thou shouldst to the worthy point the way, in order that
through thee the race of mortal kind may by \[thy\] God be saved?

27\. This when He’d said, Man-Shepherd mingled with the Powers. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But I, with thanks and blessings unto the Father of the universal
\[Powers\], was freed, full of the power He had poured into me, and full
of what He’d taught me of the nature of the All and of the loftiest
Vision.

And I began to preach to men the Beauty of Devotion and of Gnosis:

O ye people, earth-born folk, ye who have given yourselves to
drunkenness and sleep and ignorance of God, be sober now, cease from
your surfeit, cease to be glamoured by irrational sleep <span
id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58)!

28\. And when they heard, they came with one accord. Whereon I say:

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

Ye earth-born folk, why have ye given up yourselves to Death, while yet
ye have the power of sharing Deathlessness? Repent, O ye, who walk with
Error arm in arm and make of Ignorance the sharer of your board; get ye
from out the light of Darkness, and take your part in Deathlessness,
forsake Destruction!

29\. And some of them with jests upon their lips <span
id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59) departed \[from me\], abandoning
themselves unto the Way of Death; others entreated to be taught, casting
themselves before my feet.

But I made them arise, and I became a leader of the Race <span
id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60) towards home, teaching the words
(*logoi*), how and in what way they shall be saved. I sowed in them the
words (*logoi*) of wisdom <span id="fr_61"></span>[3](#fn_61); of
Deathless Water were they given to drink. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[4](#fn_62)

And when even was come and all sun’s beams began to set, I bade them all
give thanks to God. And when they had brought to an end the giving of
their thanks, each man returned to his own resting place.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

30\. But I recorded in my heart Man-Shepherd’s benefaction, and with my
every hope fulfilled more than rejoiced. For body’s sleep became

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

the soul’s awakening, <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63) and closing of
the eyes—true vision, pregnant with Good my silence, and the utterance
of my word (*logos*) begetting of good things.

All this befell me from my Mind, that is Man-Shepherd, Word (*Logos*) of
all masterhood, <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64) by whom being
God-inspired I came unto the Plain of Truth. <span
id="fr_65"></span>[3](#fn_65) Wherefore with all my soul and strength
thanksgiving <span id="fr_66"></span>[4](#fn_66) give I unto Father-God.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

31\. Holy art Thou, O God, the universals’ Father.

Holy art Thou, O God, whose Will perfects itself by means of its own
Powers.

Holy art Thou, O God, who willeth to be known and art known by Thine
own.

Holy art Thou, who didst by Word (*Logos*) make to consist the things
that are.

Holy art Thou, of whom All-nature hath been made an Image.

Holy art Thou, whose Form Nature hath never made.

Holy art Thou, more powerful than all power.

Holy art Thou, transcending all pre-eminence.

Holy Thou art, Thou better than all praise.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

Accept my reason’s <span id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67) offerings pure,
from soul and heart for aye stretched up to Thee, O Thou unutterable,
unspeakable, Whose Name naught but the Silence can express.

32\. Give ear to me who pray that I may ne’er of Gnosis fail, \[Gnosis\]
which is our common Being’s nature <span id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68);
and fill me with Thy Power, and with this Grace \[of Thine\], that I may
give the Light to those in ignorance of the Race, my Brethren, and Thy
Sons.

For this cause I believe, and I bear witness; I go to Life and Light.
Blessed art Thou, O Father. Thy Man <span id="fr_69"></span>[3](#fn_69)
would holy be as Thou art holy, e’en as Thou gavest him Thy full
authority <span id="fr_70"></span>[4](#fn_70) \[to be\].
