<p>1. [III. M.] It is for reasons such as these, Asclepius, man is a mighty wonder,&#8212;an animal meet for our worship and for our respect.</p>
<p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></A></p>
<p>For he doth pass into God&#146;s Nature,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_698"></A><A HREF="#fn_697"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as though himself were God. This genus [also] knows the genus of the daimons, as though man knew he had a [common] origin with them. He thinketh little of the part of human nature in him, from confidence in the divineness of [his] other part.</p>
<p>How much more happy is the blend of human nature [than of all the rest]! Joined to the Gods by his cognate divinity, a man looks down upon the part of him by means of which he&#146;s common with the Earth.</p>
<p>The rest of things to which he knows he&#146;s kin, by [reason of] the heavenly order [in him], he binds unto himself with bonds of love; and thus he turns his gaze to Heaven.</p>
<p>2. So, then, [man] hath his place in the more blessed station of the Midst; so that he loves [all] those below himself, and in his turn is loved by those above.</p>
<p>He tills the Earth. He mingles with the Elements by reason of the swiftness of his mind. He plunges into the Sea&#146;s depths by means of its&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_699"></A><A HREF="#fn_698"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> profundity. He puts his values on all things.</p>
<p>Heaven seems not too high for him; for it is</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="green">p. 317</font></A></p>
<p>measured by the wisdom of his mind as though it were quite near.</p>
<p>No darkness of the Air obstructs the penetration of his mind. No density of Earth impedes his work. No depth of Water blunts his sight.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_700"></A><A HREF="#fn_699"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>[Though still] the same [yet] is he all, and everywhere is he the same.</p>
<p>3. Of all these genera, those [species] which are animal have [many] roots, which stretch from the above below,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_701"></A><A HREF="#fn_700"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> whereas those which are stationary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_702"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>&#8212;these from [one] living root send forth a wood of branching greenery up from below into the upper parts.</p>
<p>Moreover, some of them are nourished with a two-fold form of food, while others with a single form.</p>
<p>Twain are the forms of food&#8212;for soul and body, of which [all] animals consist. Their soul is nourished by the ever-restless motion of the World&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_703"></A><A HREF="#fn_702"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; their bodies have their growth from</p>

<p>foods [drawn] from the water and the earth of the inferior world.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_704"></A><A HREF="#fn_703"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>Spirit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_705"></A><A HREF="#fn_704"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with which they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_706"></A><A HREF="#fn_705"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> all are filled, being interblended with the rest,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_707"></A><A HREF="#fn_706"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> doth make them live; sense being added, and also reason in the case of man&#8212;which hath been given to man alone as a fifth part out of the &aelig;ther.</p>
<p>Of all the living things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_708"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> [God] doth adorn, extend, exalt, the sense of man alone unto the understanding of the Reason of Divinity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_709"></A><A HREF="#fn_708"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>
<p>But since I am impressed to speak concerning Sense, I will a little further on set forth for you the sermon on this [point]; for that it is most holy, and [most] mighty, not less than in the Reason of Divinity itself.</p>
<p><h4 align="center">VII</h4></p>
<p>1. But now I&#146;ll finish for you what I have begun. For I was speaking at the start of union with the Gods, by which men only&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_710"></A><A HREF="#fn_709"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> consciously enjoy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_711"></A><A HREF="#fn_710"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> the Gods&#146; regard,&#8212;I mean whatever men have won such rapture that they have obtained a share of that Divine Sense of intelligence which</p>

<p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="green">p. 319</font></A></p>
<p>is the most&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_712"></A><A HREF="#fn_711"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Divine of Senses, found in God and in man&#146;s reason.</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p><i>Asc.</i> Are not the senses of all men, Thrice-greatest one, the same?</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p><i>Tris.</i> Nay, [my] Asclepius, all have not won true reason&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_713"></A><A HREF="#fn_712"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; but wildly rushing in pursuit of [reason&#146;s] counterfeit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_714"></A><A HREF="#fn_713"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> they never see the thing itself, and are deceived. And this breeds evil in their minds, and [thus] transforms the best of animals into the nature of a beast and manners of the brutes.</p>
<p>2. But as to Sense and all things similar, I will set forth the whole discourse when [I explain] concerning Spirit.</p>
<p>For man is the sole animal that is twofold. One part of him is simple: the [man] &#8220;essential,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_715"></A><A HREF="#fn_714"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> as say the Greeks, but which we call the &#8220;form of the Divine Similitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also is fourfold: that which the Greeks call &#8220;hylic,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_716"></A><A HREF="#fn_715"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> [but] which we call &#8220;cosmic&#8221;; of which is made the corporal part, in which is vestured what we just have said is the divine in man,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_717"></A><A HREF="#fn_716"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>&#8212;in which the godhead of the Mind alone,</p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="green">p. 320</font></A></p>
<p>together with its kin, that is the Pure Mind&#146;s senses, findeth home and rest, its self with its own self, as though shut in the body&#146;s walls.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_697"></A><A HREF="th239.htm#fr_698">316:1</A> This contradicts somewhat the more careful wording of <i>C. H.</i>, x. (xi.) 1, where the term Energy is preferred.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_700"></A><A HREF="th239.htm#fr_701">317:2</A> Compare with this the symbolism of the &#8220;fire-tree&#8221; and the &#8220;rootage&#8221; of the &aelig;ons, in the &#8220;Simonian&#8221; system of the Gn&#333;sis, taken by Hippolytus from the document entitled <i>The Great Announcement</i> (Hipp., <i>Philos.</i>, vi. 9 and 18). Also the common figure of the Ashvattha tree of Indo-Aryan mythology; for instance, in the <i>Ka&#7789;hopani&#7779;had</i>, II. vi. 1: &#8220;The old, old tree that sees no morrow&#146;s dawn, [stands] roots up, branches down&#8221; (see Mead and Cha&#7789;&#7789;op&#257;dhy&#257;ya&#146;s <i>Upani&#7779;hads</i>, i. 74&#8212;London; 1896). Ashvattha&#7717; = <i>a-shva&#7717;-tha</i>, that is, &#8220;which stands not till to-morrow.&#8221; The idea is that the world-tree (<i>sa&#7745;s&#257;rav&#7771;ik&#7779;ha</i>) never lasts till to-morrow, for all things are perpetually changing.</P>
