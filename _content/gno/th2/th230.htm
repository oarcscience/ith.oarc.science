<p><h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4></p>
<p><h5 align="center">ASCLEPIUS AND TAT</h5></p>
<p>Fabricius, in his <i>Bibliotheca Gr&aelig;ca</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> says that the title should be &#8220;On the Nature of the All,&#8221; and that he has recovered it from Cyril, <i>C. Jul.</i>, ii., but I cannot verify this statement.</p>
<p>The form of this treatise is different from any of the</p>
<p>

<p>preceding, being that of a letter. It evidently belongs to the Asclepius-Tat type of tradition, as in <i>C. H.</i>, x. (xi.): &#8220;My yesterday&#146;s discourse I did devote to thee, Asclepius, and so &#146;tis only right I should devote to-day&#146;s to Tat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The distinction drawn between Tat and Asclepius is of interest; Tat is the younger,&#8212;who has only &#8220;just come to Gnosis of the teaching on each single point.&#8221; Can this mean that he has only just been permitted to share in the &#8220;Expository Sermons&#8221; or &#8220;Detailed Discourses&#8221;? It is probable, for <i>C. H.</i>, x. (xi.) 1, continues: &#8220;And this the more because &#146;tis the abridgment (epitome) of the General Sermons which he has had addressed to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asclepius is older, and already &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;&#8212;well-versed in the study of Nature.</p>
<p>What may be the exact significance underlying these personifications it is very difficult to say; but the same facts, whatever they may have been, are clearly referred to in <i>K K.</i> (Stob., <i>Ecl.</i>, i. 49; p. 386, 24 W.); especially the later accession of &#8220;Asclepius&#8221; to the School, and the fact that &#8220;Tat,&#8221; because of his too great &#8220;youth,&#8221; could not have handed on to him the tradition of the complete or all-perfect contemplation (&#8001;&#955;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#8052;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#945;)&#8212;that is, of the <i>math&#275;sis</i> or <i>gn&#333;sis</i>, or, in other words, the &#8220;learning of the things that are, the contemplating of their nature and the knowing God&#8221; (<i>C. H.</i>, i. 3); or the &#8220;being taught the nature of the all and the Supreme Vision&#8221; (<i>ibid.</i>, 27).</p>
<p>This view of the tradition of the School seems to clash entirely with the other view set forth in <i>C. H.</i>, xiii. (xiv.), where Tat has handed on to him the &#8220;manner of Rebirth,&#8221; but a probable explanation has already been attempted in the &#8220;Prolegomena,&#8221; chap, xvi.: &#8220;The Disciples of Thrice-greatest Hermes.&#8221;</p>

<p><h5 align="center">COMPARE WITH &#8220;MIND UNTO HERMES&#8221;</h5></p>
<p>The treatise itself requires little commentary; the similarity of its doctrine, however, with that of the &#8220;Mind unto Hermes&#8221; is remarkable. For instance, compare the last sentence of &sect; 7 of our treatise with <i>C. H.</i>, xi. (xii.) 14: &#8220;For that indeed He hath no other one to share in what He works, for working by Himself, He ever is at work, Himself being what He doth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Compare also the first sentence of &sect; 8 with <i>C. H.</i>, xi. (xii.) 20: &#8220;Behold what power, what swiftness thou dost have! And canst thou do all of these things, and God not do them?&#8221;</p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE GOOD HUSBANDMAN</h5></p>
<p>With the Good Husbandman &#8220;image&#8221; (&sect; 10) compare:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come unto me, Good Husbandman, Good Daimon, Harpocrates, Chnouphis&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who rollest down the stream of Nilus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and minglest with the Sea&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as man with woman.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>
<p>And in the Alchemical literature:</p>
<p>&#8220;[Come then], and coming contemplate, enquire of Acharantus (?), the Husbandman, and learn of Him, what is it that is sown, and what that which is reaped; and thou shalt learn that he who soweth corn shall reap corn also, and he who soweth barley shall in like manner reap barley.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>
<p>So also Zosimus in the &#8220;Book Concerning the Logos&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;And that I tell thee truth, I call to witness Hermes, when he says: Go unto Achaab (?), the Husbandman, and thou shalt learn that he who soweth corn gives birth to corn.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_557"></A><A HREF="#fn_556"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>
