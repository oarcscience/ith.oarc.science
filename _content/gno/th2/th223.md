### MIND UNTO HERMES

<span class="small">(Text: P. 85-99; Pat. 20b-23.)</span>

1\. *Mind.* Master this sermon (*logos*), <span
id="fr_334"></span>[1](#fn_334) then, Thrice-greatest Hermes, and bear
in mind the spoken words; and as it hath come unto Me to speak, I will
no more delay.

*Hermes.* As many men say many things, and these diverse, about the All
and Good, I have not learned the truth. Make it, then, clear to me, O
Master mine! For I can trust the explanation of these things, which
comes from Thee alone.

2\. *Mind.* Hear \[then\], My son, how standeth God and All.

God; Æon <span id="fr_335"></span>[2](#fn_335); Cosmos; Time;
Becoming. <span id="fr_336"></span>[3](#fn_336)

God maketh Æon; Æon, Cosmos; Cosmos, Time; and Time, Becoming.

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

The Good,—the Beautiful, Wisdom, Blessedness,—is essence, as it
were, <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_337) of God; of Æon,
Sameness <span id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_338); of Cosmos, Order; of
Time, Change; and of Becoming, Life and Death.

The energies of God are Mind and Soul; of Æon, lastingness <span
id="fr_339"></span>[3](#fn_339) and deathlessness; of Cosmos,
restoration and the opposite thereof <span
id="fr_340"></span>[4](#fn_340); of Time, increase and decrease; and of
Becoming, quality.

Æon is, then, in God; Cosmos, in Æon; in Cosmos, Time; in Time,
Becoming.

Æon stands firm round God; Cosmos is moved in Æon; Time hath its
limits <span id="fr_341"></span>[5](#fn_341) in the Cosmos; Becoming
doth become in Time.

3\. The source, <span id="fr_342"></span>[6](#fn_342) therefore, of all
is God; their essence, Æon; their matter, Cosmos.

God’s power is Æon; Æon’s work is Cosmos—which never *hath* become, yet
ever *doth* become by Æon.

Therefore will Cosmos never be destroyed, for Æon’s indestructible; nor
doth a whit of things in Cosmos perish, for Cosmos is enwrapped by Æon
round on every side.

*Her.* But God’s Wisdom—what is that?

*Mind.* The Good and Beautiful, and Blessedness, and Virtue’s all, and
Æon.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

Æon, then, ordereth <span id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_343) \[Cosmos\],
imparting deathlessness and lastingness to matter.

4\. For its <span id="fr_344"></span>[2](#fn_344) becoming doth depend
on Æon, as Æon doth on God.

Now Genesis <span id="fr_345"></span>[3](#fn_345) and Time, in Heaven
and on the Earth, are of two natures.

In Heaven they are unchangeable and indestructible, but on the Earth
they’re subject unto change and to destruction.

Further, the Æon’s soul is God; the Cosmos’ soul is Æon; the Earth’s
soul, Heaven.

And God’s in Mind; and Mind, in Soul; and Soul, in Matter; and all of
them through Æon.

But all this Body, <span id="fr_346"></span>[4](#fn_346) in which are
all the bodies, is full of Soul; and Soul is full of Mind, and \[Mind\]
of God.

It <span id="fr_347"></span>[5](#fn_347) fills it <span
id="fr_348"></span>[6](#fn_348) from within, and from without encircles
it, making the All to live.

Without, this vast and perfect Life <span
id="fr_349"></span>[7](#fn_349) \[encircles\] Cosmos; within, it fills
\[it with\] all lives <span id="fr_350"></span>[8](#fn_350); above, in
Heaven, continuing in sameness; below, on Earth, changing becoming.

5\. And Æon doth preserve this \[Cosmos\], or by Necessity, or by
Foreknowledge, or by

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nature, or by
whatever else a man supposes or shall suppose. And all is this,—God
energizing.

The Energy of God is Power that naught can e’er surpass, a Power with
which no one can make comparison of any human thing at all, or any thing
divine.

Wherefore, O Hermes, never think that aught of things above or things
below is like to God, for thou wilt fall from truth. For naught is like
to That which hath no like, and is Alone and One.

And do not ever think that any other can possibly possess His power; for
what apart from Him is there of life, and deathlessness and change of
quality? For what else should He make <span
id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_351)?

God’s not inactive, <span id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_352) since all
things \[then\] would lack activity; for all are full of God.

But neither in the Cosmos anywhere, nor in aught else, is there
inaction. For that “inaction” is a name that cannot be applied to either
what doth make or what is made. <span id="fr_353"></span>[3](#fn_353)

6\. But all things must be made; both ever

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

made, and also in accordance with the influence of every space. <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_354)

For He who makes, is in them all; not stablished in some one of them,
nor making one thing only, but making all.

For being Power, He energiseth in the things He makes and is not
independent of them,—although the things He makes are subject to Him.

Now gaze through Me <span id="fr_355"></span>[2](#fn_355) upon the
Cosmos that’s now subject to thy sight; regard its Beauty carefully—Body
in pure perfection, though one than which there’s no more ancient one,
ever in prime of life, and ever-young, nay, rather, in even fuller and
yet fuller prime!

7\. Behold, again, the seven subject Worlds <span
id="fr_356"></span>[3](#fn_356); ordered <span
id="fr_357"></span>[4](#fn_357) by Æon’s order, <span
id="fr_358"></span>[5](#fn_358) and with their varied course
full-filling Æon!

\[See how\] all things \[are\] full of light, and nowhere \[is there\]
fire; for ’tis the love and blending of the contraries and the
dissimilars

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

that doth give birth to light down shining by the energy of God, <span
id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_359) the Father of all good, the Leader of
all order, and Ruler of the seven world-orderings!

\[Behold\] the Moon, forerunner of them all, the instrument of nature,
and the transmuter of its lower matter!

\[Look at\] the Earth set in the midst of All, foundation of the Cosmos
Beautiful, feeder and nurse of things on Earth!

And contemplate the multitude of deathless lives, how great it is, and
that of lives subject to death; and midway, between both, immortal
\[lives\] and mortal, \[see thou\] the circling Moon.

8\. And all are full of Soul, and all are moved by it, each in its
proper way; some round the Heaven, others around the Earth; \[see\] how
the right \[move\] not unto left, nor yet the left unto the right; nor
the above below, nor the below above.

And that all these are subject unto Genesis, <span
id="fr_360"></span>[2](#fn_360) My dearest Hermes, thou hast no longer
need to learn of Me. For that they bodies are, have souls, and they are
moved.

But ’tis impossible for them to come together into one without some one
to bring them \[all\]

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

together. It must, then, be that such a one as this must be some one
who’s wholly One.

9\. For as the many motions of them \[all\] are different, and as their
bodies are not like, yet has one speed been ordered for them all, it is
impossible that there should be two or more makers for them.

For that one single order is not kept among “the many”; but rivalry will
follow of the weaker with the stronger, and they will strive.

And if the maker of the lives that suffer change and death, should be
another, <span id="fr_361"></span>[1](#fn_361) he would desire to make
the deathless ones as well; just as the maker of the deathless ones,
\[to make the lives\] that suffer death.

But come! if there be two, <span id="fr_362"></span>[2](#fn_362)—if
Matter’s one, and Soul is one, in whose hands would there be the
distribution <span id="fr_363"></span>[3](#fn_363) for the making?
Again, if both of them have some of it, in whose hands may there be the
greater part?

10\. But thus conceive it, then; that every living body doth consist of
soul and matter, whether \[that body be\] of an immortal, or a mortal,
or an irrational \[life\].

For that all living bodies are ensouled; whereas, upon the other hand,
those that live not, are matter by itself.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

And, in like fashion, Soul when in its self is, after its own maker,
cause of life; but *the* cause of all life is He who makes the things
that cannot die.

*Her.* How, then, is it that, first, lives subject unto death are other
than the deathless ones? And, next, how is it that that Life which knows
no death, and maketh deathlessness, doth not make animals immortal?

11\. *Mind.* First, that there is some one who does these things, is
clear; and, next, that He is also One, is very manifest. For, also, Soul
is one, and Life is one, and Matter one.

*Her.* But who is He?

*Mind.* Who may it other be than the One God? Whom else should it beseem
to put Soul into lives but God alone? One, then, is God.

It would indeed be most ridiculous, if when thou dost confess the Cosmos
to be one, Sun one, Moon one, and Godhead <span
id="fr_364"></span>[1](#fn_364) one, thou shouldst wish God Himself to
be some one or other of a number!

12\. All things, therefore, He makes, in many \[ways\]. And what great
thing is it for God to make life, soul, and deathlessness, and change,
when thou \[thyself\] dost do <span id="fr_365"></span>[2](#fn_365) so
many things?

For thou dost see, and speak, and hear, and

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

smell, and taste, and touch, and walk, and think, and breathe. And it is
not one man who smells, a second one who speaks, a third who touches,
another one who smells, another one who walks, another one who thinks,
and \[yet\] another one who breathes. But *one* is he who doth all
these.

And yet no one of these could be apart from God. For just as, shouldst
thou cease from <span id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_366) these, thou
wouldst no longer be a living thing, so also, should God cease from them
(a thing not law to say), no longer is He God.

13\. For if it hath been shown that no thing can inactive <span
id="fr_367"></span>[2](#fn_367) be, how much less God? For if there’s
aught He doth not make (if it be law to say), He is imperfect. But if He
is not only not inactive, but perfect \[God\], then He doth make all
things.

Give thou thyself to Me, My Hermes, for a little while, <span
id="fr_368"></span>[3](#fn_368) and thou shalt understand more easily
how that God’s work is one, in order that all things may be—that are
being made, or once have been, or that are going to be made. And
*this* <span id="fr_369"></span>[4](#fn_369) is, My belovèd, Life; this
is the Beautiful; this is the Good; this, God.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

14\. And if them wouldst in practice <span
id="fr_370"></span>[1](#fn_370) understand \[this work\], behold what
taketh place with thee desiring to beget. Yet this is not like unto
that, for He doth not enjoy.

For that indeed He hath no other one to share in what He works, for
working by Himself, He ever is at work, Himself being what He
doth. <span id="fr_371"></span>[2](#fn_371) For did He separate Himself
from it, <span id="fr_372"></span>[3](#fn_372) all things would \[then\]
collapse, and all must die, Life ceasing.

But if all things are lives, and also Life is one; then, one is God.
And, furthermore, if all are lives, both those in Heaven and those on
Earth, and One Life in them all is made to be by God, and God is
it <span id="fr_373"></span>[4](#fn_373)—then, all are made by God.

Life is the making-one of Mind and Soul; accordingly Death is not the
destruction of those that are at-oned, <span
id="fr_374"></span>[5](#fn_374) but the dissolving of their union.

15\. Æon, moreover, is God’s image; Cosmos \[is\] Æon’s; the Sun, of
Cosmos; and Man, \[the image\] of the Sun.

The people call change death, because the body is dissolved, and life,
when it’s dissolved, withdraws to the unmanifest. But in this

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

sermon (*logos*), Hermes, my beloved, as thou dost hear, I say the
Cosmos also suffers change,—for that a part of it each day is made to be
in the unmanifest,—yet it is ne’er dissolved.

These are the passions of the Cosmos—revolvings and concealments;
revolving is conversion and concealment renovation.

16\. The Cosmos is all-formed,—not having forms external to itself, but
changing them itself within itself. Since, then, Cosmos is made to be
all-formed, what may its maker be? For that, on the one hand, He should
not be void of all form; and, on the other hand, if He’s all-formed, He
will be like the Cosmos. Whereas, again, has He a single form, He will
thereby be less than Cosmos.

What, then, say we He is?—that we may not bring round our sermon
(*logos*) into doubt; for naught that mind conceives of God is doubtful.

He, then, hath one *idea*, <span id="fr_375"></span>[1](#fn_375) which
is His own alone, which doth not fall beneath the sight, being bodiless,
and \[yet\] by means of bodies manifesteth all \[ideas\]. <span
id="fr_376"></span>[2](#fn_376) And marvel not that there’s a bodiless
idea.

17\. For it is like the form of reason (*logos*) <span
id="fr_377"></span>[3](#fn_377)

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

and mountain-tops in pictures. <span id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_378) For
they appear to stand out strongly from the rest, but really are quite
smooth and flat.

And now consider what is said more boldly, but more truly!

Just as man cannot live apart from Life, so neither can God live without
\[His\] doing good. <span id="fr_379"></span>[2](#fn_379) For this is as
it were the life and motion as it were of God—to move all things and
make them live.

18\. Now some of the things said <span id="fr_380"></span>[3](#fn_380)
should bear a sense peculiar to themselves. So understand, for instance,
what I’m going to say.

All are in God, \[but\] not as lying in a place. For place is both a
body and immovable, and things that lie do not have motion.

Now things lie one way in the bodiless, another way in being made
manifest.

Think, \[then,\] of Him who doth contain them all; and think, that than
the bodiless naught is more comprehensive, or swifter, or more potent,
but *it* is the most comprehensive, the swiftest, and most potent of
them all.

19\. And, thus, think from thyself, and bid

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

thy soul go unto any land; and there more quickly than thy bidding will
it be. And bid it journey oceanwards; and there, again, immediately
’twill be, not as if passing on from place to place, but as if being
there.

And bid it also mount to heaven; and it will need no wings, nor will
aught hinder it, nor fire of sun, nor æther, nor vortex-swirl, <span
id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_381) nor bodies of the other stars; but,
cutting through them all, it will soar up to the last Body \[of them
all\]. <span id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_382) And shouldst thou will to
break through this as well, and contemplate what is beyond—if there be
aught beyond the Cosmos <span id="fr_383"></span>[3](#fn_383); it is
permitted thee.

20\. Behold what power, what swiftness, thou dost have! And canst thou
do all of these things, and God not \[do them\]?

Then, in this way know <span id="fr_384"></span>[4](#fn_384) God; as
having all things in Himself as thoughts, the whole Cosmos itself.

If, then, thou dost not make thyself like unto God, thou canst not know
Him. For like is knowable to like \[alone\].

Make, \[then,\] thyself to grow to the same stature as the Greatness
which transcends all

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

measure; leap forth from every body; transcend all Time; become
Eternity <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_385); and \[thus\] shalt thou
know God.

Conceiving nothing is impossible unto thyself, think thyself deathless
and able to know all,—all arts, all sciences, the way of every
life. <span id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_386)

Become more lofty than all height, and lower than all depth. Collect
into thyself all senses of \[all\] creatures,—of fire, \[and\] water,
dry and moist. Think that thou art at the same time in every place,—in
earth, in sea, in sky; not yet begotten, in the womb, young, old,
\[and\] dead, in after-death conditions. <span
id="fr_387"></span>[3](#fn_387)

And if thou knowest all these things at once, <span
id="fr_388"></span>[4](#fn_388)—times, places, doings, qualities, and
quantities; thou canst know God. <span id="fr_389"></span>[5](#fn_389)

21\. But if thou lockest up thy soul within thy body, and dost debase
it, saying: I nothing know; I nothing can; I fear the sea; I cannot
scale the sky; I know not who I was, who I shall be;—what is there
\[then\] between \[thy\] God and thee?

For thou canst know naught of things beautiful and good so long as thou
dost love thy body and art bad.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

The greatest bad there is, is not to know God’s Good <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_390); but to be able to know \[Good\], and
will, and hope, is a Straight Way, the Good’s own \[Path\], both leading
there and easy. <span id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_391)

If thou but sett’st thy foot thereon, ’twill meet thee everywhere,
’twill everywhere be seen, both where and when thou dost expect it
not,—waking, sleeping, sailing, journeying, by night, by day, speaking,
\[and\] saying naught. For there is naught that is not image of the
Good.

22\. *Her.* Is God unseen?

*Mind.* Hush! Who is more manifest than He? For this one reason hath He
made all things, that through them all thou mayest see Him.

This is the Good of God, this \[is\] His Virtue,—that He may be made
manifest through all. <span id="fr_392"></span>[3](#fn_392)

For naught’s *unseen*, even of things that are without a body. Mind sees
itself <span id="fr_393"></span>[4](#fn_393) in thinking, God in
making. <span id="fr_394"></span>[5](#fn_394)

So far these things have been made manifest to thee, Thrice-greatest
one! Reflect on all the rest in the same way within thyself, and thou
shalt not be led astray.
