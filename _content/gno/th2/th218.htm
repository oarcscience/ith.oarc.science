<p><h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4></p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE COSMOS AS &#8220;SECOND GOD&#8221;</h5></p>
<p>The superscription enunciates the nature of the treatise. It is evidently taken from the Dialogues to Tat, and originally formed part of some General Dissertation or of a collection of Dissertations.</p>
<p>It formed part of an instruction in which the Cosmos</p>
<p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></A></p>
<p>was treated of as &#8220;Second God,&#8221; as we find it also in Philo&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; but just as Philo guards against any idea of duality, so does our treatise when it ends with the words (&sect; 5):</p>
<p>&#8220;The source and limit and the constitution of all things is God.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Great Body of the Cosmos, the Sphere or Perfect Form, the root of all forms, seems to be bounded by the idea of the &AElig;on or Eternity, or Deathlessness. It is, as it were, the Cave or Womb of all things in genesis, centred in the Pleroma of ideas, the Intelligible Cosmos, which is full-filled with the ideas of God (&sect; 3).</p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE LAW OF APOKATASTASIS</h5></p>
<p>The eternal order and life of Cosmos is preserved by the law of <i>apokatastasis</i> or restoration (&sect; 4), the law of ever-becoming, and cyclic renewal, the making-new-again (&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#941;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;) of <i>C. H.</i>, iii. (iv.) 1.</p>
<p>There is no question of loss of body,&#8212;this is an illusion; there is a privation of sense, a going into latency of some particular phase of consciousness.</p>
<p>There are then Great Lives&#8212;God, Cosmos, Man. Cosmos is made in the image of God, Man in the image of Cosmos. Therefore has Man sense and mind; by the former he is &#8220;in sympathy with&#8221; the Cosmos, as Body by the latter he is conscious of God as Mind,&#8212;that is the Bodiless. Or as we might phrase it, by sense Man knows the Sensible Cosmos, by mind the Intelligible Cosmos, the Good Mind; for God is Source and Limit and the Constitution of all things&#8212;the Cosmos, both Intelligible and Sensible, included.</p>
