<p>[IX. M.] And&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_831"></A><A HREF="#fn_830"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> since our sermon treats of the relationship and intercourse&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_832"></A><A HREF="#fn_831"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of men and Gods,&#8212;learn, Asclepius, the power and strength of man!</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p>[Our] Lord and Father, or what is Highest God,&#8212;as He&#146;s Creator of the Gods in Heaven, so man&#146;s the maker of the gods who, in the temples, suffer man&#146;s approach, and who not only have light poured on them, but who send forth [their] light [on all]; not only does a man go forward towards the God[s], but also he confirms the Gods [on earth].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_833"></A><A HREF="#fn_832"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p>Art thou surprised, Asclepius; nay is it not that even <i>thou</i> dost not believe?</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p>2. <i>Asc.</i> I am amazed, Thrice-greatest one; but willingly I give assent to [all] thy words. I judge that man most blest who hath attained so great felicity.</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p><i>Tris.</i> And rightly so; [for] he deserves our wonder, in that he is the greatest of them all.</p>
<p>As for the genus of the Gods in Heaven,&#8212;&#146;tis plain from the commixture&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_834"></A><A HREF="#fn_833"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of them all, that it has been made pregnant from the fairest part of nature,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_835"></A><A HREF="#fn_834"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and that the only signs [by which they are discerned] are, as it were, before all else their heads.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_836"></A><A HREF="#fn_835"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>
<p>3. Whereas the species of the gods which humankind constructs is fashioned out of either nature,&#8212;out of that nature which is more ancient and far more divine, and out of that which is in men; that is, out of the stuff of which they have been made and are configured, not only in their heads alone, but also in each limb and their whole frame.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_837"></A><A HREF="#fn_836"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> so mankind, in imaging Divinity, stays</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="green">p. 351</font></A></p>
<p>mindful of the nature and the source of its own self.</p>
<p>So that, just as [our] Sire and Lord did make the Gods &aelig;onian, that they might be like Him; so hath mankind configured its own gods according to the likeness of the look of its own self.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_838"></A><A HREF="#fn_837"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p><h4 align="center">XXIV</h4></p>
<p>1. <i>Asc.</i> Thou dost not mean their statues, dost thou, O Thrice-greatest one?</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p><i>Tris.</i> [I mean their] statues, O Asclepius,&#8212;dost thou not see how much <i>thou</i> even, doubtest?&#8212;statues, ensouled with sense, and filled with spirit, which work such mighty and such [strange] results,&#8212;statues which can foresee what is to come, and which perchance can prophesy, foretelling things by dreams and many other ways,&#8212;[statues] that take their strength away from men, or cure their sorrow, if they do so deserve.</p>
<p>Dost thou not know, Asclepius, that Egypt is the image of the Heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_839"></A><A HREF="#fn_838"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; or, what is truer still, the transference, or the descent, of all that are in governance or exercise in Heaven? And if more truly [still] it must be said,&#8212;this land of ours is Shrine of all the World.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="green">p. 352</font></A></p>
<p>2. Further, in that &#146;tis fitting that the prudent should know all before, it is not right ye should be ignorant of this.</p>
<p>The time will come when Egypt will appear to have in vain served the Divinity with pious mind and constant worship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_840"></A><A HREF="#fn_839"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and all its holy cult will fall to nothingness and be in vain.</p>
<p>For that Divinity is now about to hasten back from Earth to Heaven, and Egypt shall be left; and Earth, which was the seat of pious cults, shall be bereft and widowed of the presence of the Gods.</p>
<p>And foreigners shall fill this region and this land; and there shall be not only the neglect of pious cults, but&#8212;what is still more painful,&#8212;as though enacted by the laws, a penalty shall be decreed against the practice of [our] pious cults and worship of the Gods&#8212;[entire] proscription of them.</p>
<p>3. Then shall this holiest land, seat of [our] shrines and temples, be choked with tombs and corpses.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_841"></A><A HREF="#fn_840"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>
<p>O Egypt, Egypt, of thy pious cults tales only will remain, as far beyond belief for thy own sons [as for the rest of men]; words only will be left cut on thy stones, thy pious deeds recounting!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="green">p. 353</font></A></p>
<p>And Egypt will be made the home of Scyth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_842"></A><A HREF="#fn_841"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or Indian, or some one like to them,&#8212;that is a foreign neighbour.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_843"></A><A HREF="#fn_842"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>
<p>Ay, for the Godly company&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_844"></A><A HREF="#fn_843"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> shall mount again to Heaven, and their forsaken worshippers shall all die out; and Egypt, thus bereft of God and man, shall be abandoned.</p>
<p>4. And now I speak to thee, O River, holiest [Stream]! I tell thee what will be. With bloody torrents shalt thou overflow thy banks. Not only shall thy streams divine be stained with blood; but they shall all flow over [with the same].</p>
<p>The tale of tombs shall far exceed the [number of the] quick; and the surviving remnant shall be Egyptians in their tongue alone, but in their actions foreigners.</p>
<p><h4 align="center">XXV</h4></p>
<p>1. Why dost thou weep, Asclepius? Nay, more than this, by far more wretched,&#8212;Egypt herself shall be impelled and stained with greater ills.</p>
<p>For she, the Holy [Land], and once deservedly</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="green">p. 354</font></A></p>
<p>the most beloved by God, by reason of her pious service of the Gods on earth,&#8212;she, the sole colony&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_845"></A><A HREF="#fn_844"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of holiness, and teacher of religion [on the earth], shall be the type of all that is most barbarous.</p>
<p>And then, out of our loathing for mankind, the World will seem no more deserving of our wonder and our praise.</p>
<p>All this good thing,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_846"></A><A HREF="#fn_845"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>&#8212;than which there has been fairer naught that can be seen, nor is there anything, nor will there [ever] be,&#8212;will be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>2. And it will prove a burden unto men; and on account of this they will despise and cease to love this Cosmos as a whole,&#8212;the changeless work of God; the glorious construction of the Good, comprised of multifold variety of forms; the engine of God&#146;s Will, supporting His own work ungrudgingly; the multitudinous whole massed in a unity of all, that should be reverenced, praised and loved,&#8212;by them at least who have the eyes to see.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="green">p. 355</font></A></p>
<p>For Darkness will be set before the Light, and Death will be thought preferable to Life. No one will raise his eyes to Heaven; the pious man will be considered mad, the impious a sage; the frenzied held as strong, the worst as best.</p>
<p>3. For soul, and all concerning it,&#8212;whereby it doth presume that either it hath been born deathless, or that it will attain to deathlessness, according to the argument I have set forth for you,&#8212;[all this] will be considered not only food for sport,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_847"></A><A HREF="#fn_846"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> but even vanity.</p>
<p>Nay, [if ye will] believe me, the penalty of death shall be decreed to him who shall devote himself to the Religion of the Mind.</p>
<p>New statutes shall come into force, a novel law; naught [that is] sacred, nothing pious, naught that is worthy of the Heaven, or Gods in Heaven, shall [e&#146;er] be heard, or [even] mentally believed.</p>
<p>4. The sorrowful departure of the Gods from men takes place; bad angels&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_848"></A><A HREF="#fn_847"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> only stay, who mingled with humanity will lay their hands on them, and drive the wretched folk to every ill of recklessness,&#8212;to wars, and robberies, deceits,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_356"><font size="1" color="green">p. 356</font></A></p>
<p>and all those things that are opposed to the soul&#146;s nature.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_849"></A><A HREF="#fn_848"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>Then shall the Earth no longer hold together; the Sea no longer shall be sailed upon; nor shall the Heaven continue with the Courses of the Stars, nor the Star-course in Heaven.</p>
<p>The voice of every God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_850"></A><A HREF="#fn_849"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> shall cease in the [Great] Silence that no one can break; the fruits of Earth shall rot; nay, Earth no longer shall bring forth; and Air itself shall faint in that sad listlessness.</p>
<p><h4 align="center">XXVI</h4></p>
<p>1. This, when it comes, shall be the World&#146;s old age, impiety,&#8212;irregularity, and lack of rationality in all good things.</p>
<p>And when these things all come to pass, Asclepius,&#8212;then He, [our] Lord and Sire, God First in power, and Ruler of the One God [Visible],&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_851"></A><A HREF="#fn_850"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in check of crime, and calling error back from the corruption of all things unto good manners and to deeds spontaneous with His Will (that is to say God&#146;s Goodness),&#8212;ending all ill, by either washing it away with water-flood, or burning it away with fire, or by the means of pestilent diseases, spread</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="green">p. 357</font></A></p>
<p>throughout all hostile lands,&#8212;God will recall the Cosmos to its ancient form&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_852"></A><A HREF="#fn_851"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; so that the World itself shall seem meet to be worshipped and admired; and God, the Maker and Restorer of so vast a work, be sung by the humanity who shall be then, with ceaseless heraldings of praise and [hymns of] blessing.</p>
<p>2. For this [Re-] birth of Cosmos is the making new&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_853"></A><A HREF="#fn_852"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of all good things, and the most holy and most pious bringing-back again of Nature&#146;s self, by means of a set course of time,&#8212;of Nature, which was without beginning, and which is without an end. For that God&#146;s Will hath no beginning; and, in that &#146;tis the same and as it is, it is without an end.</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p><i>Asc.</i> Because God&#146;s Nature&#146;s the Determination&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_854"></A><A HREF="#fn_853"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of the Will. Determination is the Highest Good; is it not so, Thrice-greatest one?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_358"><font size="1" color="green">p. 358</font></A></p>
<p>3. <i>Tris.</i> Asclepius, Will is Determination&#146;s child; nay, willing in itself comes from the Will.</p>
<p>Not that He willeth aught desiring it; for that He is the Fullness of all things, and wills what things He has.</p>
<p>He thus wills all good things, and has all that He wills. Nay, rather, He doth think and will <i>all</i> good.</p>
<p>This, then, is God; the World of Good&#146;s His Image.</p>
<p><h4 align="center">XXVII</h4></p>
<p>1. <i>Asc.</i> [Is Cosmos] good, Thrice-greatest one?</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p><i>Tris.</i> [&#146;Tis] good,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_855"></A><A HREF="#fn_854"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as I will teach thee, O Asclepius.</p>
<p>For just as God is the Apportioner and Steward of good things to all the species, or [more correctly] genera, which are in Cosmos,&#8212;that is to say, of Sense,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_856"></A><A HREF="#fn_855"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and Soul, and Life,&#8212;so Cosmos is the giver and bestower of all things which seem unto [us] mortals good;&#8212;that is to say, the alternation of its parts, of seasonable fruits, birth, growth, maturity, and things like these.</p>
<p>And for this cause God doth transcend the height of highest Heaven, extending everywhere, and doth behold all things on every side.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_359"><font size="1" color="green">p. 359</font></A></p>
<p>2. Beyond the Heaven starless Space doth stretch, stranger to every thing possessed of body.</p>
<p>The Dispensator who&#146;s between the Heaven and Earth, is Ruler of the Space which we call Zeus [Above].</p>
<p>The Earth and Sea is ruled by Zeus Below&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_857"></A><A HREF="#fn_856"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; he is the Nourisher of mortal lives, and of fruit-bearing [trees].</p>
<p>It is by reason of the powers of all of these&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_858"></A><A HREF="#fn_857"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that fruits, and trees, and earth, grow green.</p>
<p>The powers and energies of [all] the other [Gods] will be distributed through all the things that are.</p>
<p>3. Yea, they who rule the earth shall be distributed [through all the lands], and [finally] be gathered in a state,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_859"></A><A HREF="#fn_858"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>&#8212;at top of Egypt&#146;s upper part,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_860"></A><A HREF="#fn_859"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>&#8212;which shall be founded towards the setting sun, and to which all the mortal race shall speed.</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p><i>Asc.</i> But now, just at this moment, where are they, Thrice-greatest one?</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p><i>Tris.</i> They&#146;re gathered in a very large </p>
