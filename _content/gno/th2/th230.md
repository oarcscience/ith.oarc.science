#### COMMENTARY

##### ASCLEPIUS AND TAT

Fabricius, in his *Bibliotheca Græca*, <span
id="fr_553"></span>[2](#fn_552) says that the title should be “On the
Nature of the All,” and that he has recovered it from Cyril, *C. Jul.*,
ii., but I cannot verify this statement.

The form of this treatise is different from any of the

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

preceding, being that of a letter. It evidently belongs to the
Asclepius-Tat type of tradition, as in *C. H.*, x. (xi.): “My
yesterday’s discourse I did devote to thee, Asclepius, and so ’tis only
right I should devote to-day’s to Tat.”

The distinction drawn between Tat and Asclepius is of interest; Tat is
the younger,—who has only “just come to Gnosis of the teaching on each
single point.” Can this mean that he has only just been permitted to
share in the “Expository Sermons” or “Detailed Discourses”? It is
probable, for *C. H.*, x. (xi.) 1, continues: “And this the more because
’tis the abridgment (epitome) of the General Sermons which he has had
addressed to him.”

Asclepius is older, and already ἐπιστήμων τῆς φύσεως—well-versed in the
study of Nature.

What may be the exact significance underlying these personifications it
is very difficult to say; but the same facts, whatever they may have
been, are clearly referred to in *K K.* (Stob., *Ecl.*, i. 49; p. 386,
24 W.); especially the later accession of “Asclepius” to the School, and
the fact that “Tat,” because of his too great “youth,” could not have
handed on to him the tradition of the complete or all-perfect
contemplation (ὁλοτελὴς θεωρία)—that is, of the *mathēsis* or *gnōsis*,
or, in other words, the “learning of the things that are, the
contemplating of their nature and the knowing God” (*C. H.*, i. 3); or
the “being taught the nature of the all and the Supreme Vision”
(*ibid.*, 27).

This view of the tradition of the School seems to clash entirely with
the other view set forth in *C. H.*, xiii. (xiv.), where Tat has handed
on to him the “manner of Rebirth,” but a probable explanation has
already been attempted in the “Prolegomena,” chap, xvi.: “The Disciples
of Thrice-greatest Hermes.”

##### COMPARE WITH “MIND UNTO HERMES”

The treatise itself requires little commentary; the similarity of its
doctrine, however, with that of the “Mind unto Hermes” is remarkable.
For instance, compare the last sentence of § 7 of our treatise with *C.
H.*, xi. (xii.) 14: “For that indeed He hath no other one to share in
what He works, for working by Himself, He ever is at work, Himself being
what He doth.”

Compare also the first sentence of § 8 with *C. H.*, xi. (xii.) 20:
“Behold what power, what swiftness thou dost have! And canst thou do all
of these things, and God not do them?”

##### THE GOOD HUSBANDMAN

With the Good Husbandman “image” (§ 10) compare:

“Come unto me, Good Husbandman, Good Daimon, Harpocrates,
Chnouphis . . . who rollest down the stream of Nilus, <span
id="fr_554"></span>[1](#fn_553) and minglest with the Sea . . . as man
with woman.” <span id="fr_555"></span>[2](#fn_554)

And in the Alchemical literature:

“\[Come then\], and coming contemplate, enquire of Acharantus (?), the
Husbandman, and learn of Him, what is it that is sown, and what that
which is reaped; and thou shalt learn that he who soweth corn shall reap
corn also, and he who soweth barley shall in like manner reap
barley.” <span id="fr_556"></span>[3](#fn_555)

So also Zosimus in the “Book Concerning the Logos”:

“And that I tell thee truth, I call to witness Hermes, when he says: Go
unto Achaab (?), the Husbandman, and thou shalt learn that he who soweth
corn gives birth to corn.” <span id="fr_557"></span>[4](#fn_556)
