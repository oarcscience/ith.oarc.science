<p><h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4></p>
<p><h5 align="center">A PREACHING</h5></p>
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">There</span> is little to be said about this powerful appeal to cease from the drunkenness of physical sensations and to awaken to the Light.</p>
<p>Reitzenstein (p. 194) calls it a &#8220;<i>Prophetenpredigt</i>&#8221; and says that nowhere in the MSS. is it ascribed to Hermes; by which he can only mean that it bears no other superscription than the descriptive sentence which heads it.</p>
<p>The style and spirit remind us not so much of <i>C. H.</i>, iii. (iv.), as Reitzenstein (p. 206, 1) suggests, as of the interpolated or superadded passages in the &#8220;P&#339;mandres&#8221; treatise (&sect; 27):</p>
<p>&#8220;O ye people, earthborn folk, ye who have given yourselves to drunkenness, and sleep, and ignorance, be sober now, cease from your surfeit, cease to be glamoured by irrational sleep!&#8221;</p>
<p>Did this sentence give rise to our little sermon; or is the sentence a summary of the preaching? Or do both sentence and sermon come from a common stock?</p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE PROBABLE COMPLETION OF AN OXYRHYNCHUS LOGION</h5></p>
<p>The last hypothesis seems to be the most satisfactory choice; and we may compare what would appear to be a familiar figure of speech among such communities with <i>logion</i> 3 of the First Oxyrhynchus Fragment:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jesus saith: I stood in the midst of the world (&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#965;), and in the flesh did I appear unto them; and I found all men drunken, and none found I athirst among them; and my soul grieveth over the souls of</p>
<p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></A></p>
<p>men, because they are blind in their heart and see not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can we fill up the missing word from our sermon?</p>
<p>&#8220;But sober all they gaze with their hearts&#146; eyes on Him who willeth to be seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The missing word seems, therefore, to be &#8220;God.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gospel that is preached is the Beauty of the Gnosis,&#8212;&#8220;the Beauty of the Truth and Good that dwells therein&#8221;; just as in <i>C. H.</i>, i. 27:</p>
<p>&#8220;And I began to preach to men the Beauty of Devotion and of the Gnosis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tempest-tossed on the Sea of Ignorance are to make for the Harbour of Salvation&#8212;evidently some great organization devoted to the holy life; therein they must seek for one who knows, who can take them by the hand and lead them unto the Gates of the Gnosis.</p>
<p>This suggests that the organization consisted of a general body, within which were grades of instruction; the many were striving for illumination, some few had reached it.</p>
