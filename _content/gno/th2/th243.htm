<p>2. [VII. M.] And now let us begin to treat of Spirit and such things.</p>
<p>There was first God and Matter,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_763"></A><A HREF="#fn_762"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> which we in Greek&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_764"></A><A HREF="#fn_763"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> believe [to be] the Cosmos; and Spirit was <i>with</i> Cosmos, or Spirit was <i>in</i> Cosmos, but not in like way as in God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_765"></A><A HREF="#fn_764"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; nor were there</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="green">p. 333</font></A></p>
<p>things [as yet] from which the Cosmos [comes to birth] in God.</p>
<p>They <i>were</i> not; just for the very reason that they were not, but were as yet in that [condition] whence they <i>have had</i> their birth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_766"></A><A HREF="#fn_765"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>For those things only are not called ingenerable which have not yet been born, but [also] those which lack the fertilizing power of generating, so that from them naught can be born.</p>
<p>And so whatever things there are that have in them the power of generating,&#8212;these two are generable, [that is to say,] from which birth can take place, though they be born from their own selves [alone]. For there&#146;s no question that from those born from themselves birth can with ease take place, since from <i>them</i> all are born.</p>
<p>3. God, then, the everlasting, God the eternal, nor can be born, nor could He have been born. That&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_767"></A><A HREF="#fn_766"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is, That was, That shall be ever. This, therefore, is God&#146;s Nature&#8212;all from itself [alone].</p>
<p>But Matter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_768"></A><A HREF="#fn_767"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (or the Nature of the Cosmos)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_769"></A><A HREF="#fn_768"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and Spirit, although they do not seem to be things born from any source,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_770"></A><A HREF="#fn_769"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> yet in themselves</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="green">p. 334</font></A></p>
<p>possess the power of generation and of generating,&#8212;the nature of fecundity.</p>
<p>For the beginning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_771"></A><A HREF="#fn_770"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> [truly] is in [just that] quality of nature which possesses in itself the power and matter both of conception and of birth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_772"></A><A HREF="#fn_771"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> This,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_773"></A><A HREF="#fn_772"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> then, without conception of another, is generable of its own self.</p>
<p><h4 align="center">XV</h4></p>
<p>1. But, on the other hand, [whereas] those things which only have the power of bringing forth by blending with another nature, are thus to be distinguished, this Space of Cosmos,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_774"></A><A HREF="#fn_773"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> with those that are in it, seems not to have been born, in that [the Cosmos] has in it undoubtedly all Nature&#146;s potency.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_775"></A><A HREF="#fn_774"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>
<p>By &#8220;Space&#8221; I mean that in which are all things. For all these things could not have been had Space not been, to hold them all. Since for all things that there have been, must be provided Space.</p>
<p>For neither could the qualities nor quantities, nor the positions, nor [yet] the operations, be distinguished of those things which are no <i>where.</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="green">p. 335</font></A></p>
<p>2. So then the Cosmos, also, though not born, still has in it the births&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_776"></A><A HREF="#fn_775"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of all; in that, indeed, it doth afford for all of them most fecund wombs for their conception.</p>
<p>It, therefore, is the sum of [all that] quality of Matter which hath creative potency, although it hath not been [itself] created.</p>
<p>And, seeing that [this] quality of Matter is in its nature [simple] productiveness; so the same [source] produces bad as well [as good].</p>
<p><h4 align="center">XVI</h4></p>
<p>1. I have not, therefore, O Asclepius and Ammon, said what many say, that God <i>could</i> not excise and banish evil from the Scheme&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_777"></A><A HREF="#fn_776"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of Things;&#8212;to whom no answer need at all be given. Yet for your sakes I will continue what I have begun, and give a reason.</p>
<p>They say that God ought to have freed the World from bad in every way; for so much is it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_778"></A><A HREF="#fn_777"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the World, that it doth seem to be as though it were one of its limbs.</p>
<p>This was foreseen by Highest God and [due] provision made, as much as ever could have been in reason made, then when He thought it proper to endow the minds of men with sense,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_779"></A><A HREF="#fn_778"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and science and intelligence.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="green">p. 336</font></A></p>
<p>2. For it is by these things alone whereby we stand above the rest of animals, that we are able to avoid the snares and crimes of ill.</p>
<p>For he who shall on sight have turned from them, before he hath become immeshed in them,&#8212;he is a man protected by divine intelligence and [godly] prudence.</p>
<p>For that the ground-work of [true] science doth consist of the top-stones of virtue.</p>
<p>3. It is by Spirit that all things are governed in the Cosmos, and made quick,&#8212;Spirit made subject to the Will of Highest God, as though it were an engine or machine.</p>
<p>So far, then, [only] let Him be by us conceived,&#8212;as Him who is conceivable by mind alone, who is called Highest God, the Ruler and Director of God Sensible,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_780"></A><A HREF="#fn_779"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#8212;of Him who in Himself includes all Space, all Substance, and all Matter, of things producing and begetting, and all whatever is, however great it be.</p>
<p><h4 align="center">XVII</h4></p>
<p>1. It is by Spirit that all species in the Cosmos are [or] moved or ruled,&#8212;each one according to its proper nature given it by God.</p>
<p>Matter,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_781"></A><A HREF="#fn_780"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> or Cosmos, on the other hand, is that which holds all things,&#8212;the field of motion,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_781"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="green">p. 337</font></A></p>
<p>the that which crowds together&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_783"></A><A HREF="#fn_782"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> all; of which God is the Ruler, distributing unto all cosmic things all that is requisite to each.</p>
<p>It is with Spirit that He fills all things, according to the quality of each one&#146;s nature.</p>
<p>2. [Now,] seeing that the hollow roundness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_783"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of the Cosmos is borne round into the fashion of a sphere; by reason of its [very] quality or form, it never can be altogether visible unto itself.</p>
<p>So that, however high a place in it thou shouldest choose for looking down below, thou could&#146;st not see from it what is at bottom, because in many places it confronts [the senses], and so is thought to have the quality [of being visible throughout].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_784"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>
<p>For it is solely owing to the forms of species, with images of which it seems insculpted, that it is thought [to be] as though &#146;twere visible [throughout]; but as a fact &#146;tis ever to itself invisible.</p>
<p>3. Wherefore, its bottom, or its [lowest] part, if [such a] place there be within a sphere, is called in Greek <i>a-eid&#275;s</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_786"></A><A HREF="#fn_785"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; since that <i>eidein</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_786"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> in</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="green">p. 338</font></A></p>
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Greek means &#8220;seeing,&#8221;&#8212;which &#8220;being-seen&#8221; the sphere&#146;s beginning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_788"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> lacks.</p>
<p>Hence, too, the species have the name <i>eideai</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_789"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> since they&#146;re of form we cannot see.</p>
<p>Therefore, in that they are deprived of &#8220;being-seen,&#8221; in Greek they are called <i>Hades</i>; in that they are at bottom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_790"></A><A HREF="#fn_789"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of the sphere, they&#146;re called in Latin <i>Inferi.</i></p>
<p>These, then, are principal and prior,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_791"></A><A HREF="#fn_790"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and, as it were, the sources and the heads of all the things which are in them,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_792"></A><A HREF="#fn_791"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> through them, or from them.</p>
<p><h4 align="center">XVIII</h4></p>
<p>1. <i>Asc.</i> All things, then, in themselves (as thou, Thrice-greatest one, dost say) are cosmic [principles] (as I should say) of all the species which are in them, [or] as it were, the sum and substance of each one of them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_793"></A><A HREF="#fn_792"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> <p><i>Tris.</i> So Cosmos, then, doth nourish bodies; the Spirit, souls; the [Higher] Sense (with which Celestial Gift mankind alone is blest)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_794"></A><A HREF="#fn_793"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> doth feed the mind.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="green">p. 339</font></A></p>
<p>And [these are] not all men, but [they are] few, whose minds are of such quality that they can be receptive of so great a blessing.</p>
<p>2. For as the World&#146;s illumined by the Sun, so is the mind of man illumined by that Light; nay, in [still] fuller measure.</p>
<p>For whatsoever thing the Sun doth shine upon, it is anon, by interjection of the Earth or Moon, or by the intervention of the night, robbed of its light.</p>
<p>But once the [Higher] Sense hath been commingled with the soul of man, there is at-onement from the happy union of the blending of their natures; so that minds of this kind are never more held fast in errors of the darkness.</p>
<p>Wherefore, with reason have they said the [Higher] Senses are the souls of Gods; to which I add: not of <i>all</i> Gods, but of the great ones [only]; nay, even of the principles of these.</p>
