#### XXXVII

1\. \[XIII. M.\] But <span id="fr_928"></span>[5](#fn_927) now let this
suffice about such things; and let us once again return

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

to man and reason,—gift divine, from which man has the name of rational
animal.

Less to be wondered at are the things said of man,—though they are
\[still\] to be admired. Nay, of all marvels that which wins our wonder
\[most\] is that man has been able to find out the nature of the Gods
and bring it into play.

2\. Since, then, our earliest progenitors were in great error, <span
id="fr_929"></span>[1](#fn_928)—seeing they had no rational faith about
the Gods, and that they paid no heed unto their cult and holy
worship,—they chanced upon an art whereby they made Gods \[for
themselves\]. <span id="fr_930"></span>[2](#fn_929)

To this invention they conjoined a power that suited it, \[derived\]
from cosmic nature; and blending these together, since souls they could
not make, \[they set about\] evoking daimons’ souls or those of angels;
\[and thus\] attached them to their sacred images and holy mysteries, so
that the statues should, by means of these, possess the powers of doing
good and the reverse.

3\. For thy forebear, Asclepius, the first discoverer of medicine, to
whom there is a temple

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

hallowed on Libya’s Mount, <span id="fr_931"></span>[1](#fn_930) hard by
the shore of crocodiles, <span id="fr_932"></span>[2](#fn_931) in which
his cosmic man <span id="fr_933"></span>[3](#fn_932) reposes, that is to
say his body; for that the rest \[of him\], or better still, the whole
(if that a man when wholly \[plunged\] in consciousness of life, <span
id="fr_934"></span>[4](#fn_933) be better), hath gone back home to
heaven,—still furnishing, \[but\] now by his divinity, the sick with all
the remedies which he was wont in days gone by to give by art of
medicine.

4\. Hermes, which is the name of my forebear, whose home is in a place
called after him, <span id="fr_935"></span>[5](#fn_934) doth aid and
guard all mortal \[men\] who come to him from every side. <span
id="fr_936"></span>[6](#fn_935)

As for Osiris’ \[spouse\]; how many are the blessings that we know Isis
bestows when she’s propitious; how many does she injure when she’s
wrath!

For that the terrene and the cosmic Gods are

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

easily enraged, in that they are created and composed of the two
natures.

5\. And for this cause it comes to pass that these are called the
“sacred animals” by the Egyptians, and that each several state <span
id="fr_937"></span>[1](#fn_936) gives service to the souls of those
whose souls have been made holy, <span id="fr_938"></span>[2](#fn_937)
while they were still alive; so that \[the several states\] are governed
by the laws \[of their peculiar sacred animals\], and called after their
names.

It is because of this, Asclepius, those \[animals\] which are considered
by some states deserving of their worship, in others are thought
otherwise; and on account of this the states of the Egyptians wage with
each other frequent war.

#### XXXVIII

1\. *Asc.* And of what nature, O Thrice-greatest one, may be the quality
of those who are considered terrene Gods?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* It doth consist, Asclepius, of plants, and stones, and spices,
which contain the nature of \[their own\] divinity.

And for this cause they are delighted with repeated sacrifice, with
hymns, and lauds, and

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

sweetest sounds, tuned to the key of Heaven’s harmonious song. <span
id="fr_939"></span>[1](#fn_938)

2\. So that what is of heavenly nature, <span
id="fr_940"></span>[2](#fn_939) being drawn down into the images by
means of heavenly use and practices, may be enabled to endure with joy
the nature of mankind, and sojourn with it for long periods of time.

Thus is it that man is the maker of the Gods.

3\. But do not, O Asclepius, I pray thee, think the doings of the
terrene Gods are the result of chance.

The heavenly Gods dwell in the heights of Heaven, each filling up and
watching o’er the rank he hath received; whereas these Gods of
ours, <span id="fr_941"></span>[3](#fn_940) each in its way,—by looking
after certain things, foretelling others by oracles and prophecy,
foreseeing others, and duly helping them along,—act as allies of men, as
though they were our relatives and friends.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_927"></span>[380:5](th249.htm#fr_928) The first six
paragraphs of this chapter are quoted in Latin, with two slight verbal
variants, by Augustine, *De Civitate Dei*, xxiv., xxvi.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[381:1](th249.htm#fr_929) Ménard thinks he can
distinguish the hand of a Christian scribe in this sentence, which he
translates with great freedom, “*qui s’égaraient dans l’incrédulité.*” A
more careful translation, however, does not seem to favour this
hypothesis. Hermes says simply that primitive mankind were ignorant of
the Gods, and so in error.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[381:2](th249.htm#fr_930) That is, images.
*Cf.* xxx. above; and *C. H.*, xvii.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[382:1](th249.htm#fr_931) *Cf.* xxvii. 3 above.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[382:2](th249.htm#fr_932) *In monte Libyæ circa
littus crocodilorum.* Does this refer to a Crocodilopolis (κροκοδείλων
πόλις, Ptol., iv. 5, § 65)? And if so, to which of these cities, for
there were several? The best known of these is Arsinoë in the Faiyyūm;
but there was also another down south, in the Thebaid, on the W. bank of
the Nile, lat. 25° 6*'*, of which remains are still visible at
Embeshanda, on the verge of the Libyan desert. See Smith’s *Dict. of Gk.
and Rom. Geography* (London, 1878), *sub voc.*

<span id="fn_932"></span>[382:3](th249.htm#fr_933) Presumably his mummy.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[382:4](th249.htm#fr_934) *In sensu vitæ.*

<span id="fn_934"></span>[382:5](th249.htm#fr_935) Hermopolis therefore
(compare Lact., *D. Institt.*, i. 6); that is to say, Hermopolis Magna
(Ἑρμοῦ πόλις μεγάλη), the modern Eshmūn, on the left bank of the Nile,
about lat. 27° 4*'.*

<span id="fn_935"></span>[382:6](th249.htm#fr_936) To get wisdom.
Augustine’s quotation ends here.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[383:1](th249.htm#fr_937) Or city. For the
animal cult of the Egyptians, see Plutarch, *De Is. et Os.*, lxxii. ff.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[383:2](th249.htm#fr_938) Or consecrated.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[384:1](th249.htm#fr_939) *Cf.* “God’s song” in
xiii. 2 above.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[384:2](th249.htm#fr_940) Namely, the nature of
the Gods.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[384:3](th249.htm#fr_941) The terrene Gods; the
daimones of *C. H.*, xvi. 14.
