#### VI

1\. \[III. M.\] It is for reasons such as these, Asclepius, man is a
mighty wonder,—an animal meet for our worship and for our respect.

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

For he doth pass into God’s Nature, <span
id="fr_698"></span>[1](#fn_697) as though himself were God. This genus
\[also\] knows the genus of the daimons, as though man knew he had a
\[common\] origin with them. He thinketh little of the part of human
nature in him, from confidence in the divineness of \[his\] other part.

How much more happy is the blend of human nature \[than of all the
rest\]! Joined to the Gods by his cognate divinity, a man looks down
upon the part of him by means of which he’s common with the Earth.

The rest of things to which he knows he’s kin, by \[reason of\] the
heavenly order \[in him\], he binds unto himself with bonds of love; and
thus he turns his gaze to Heaven.

2\. So, then, \[man\] hath his place in the more blessed station of the
Midst; so that he loves \[all\] those below himself, and in his turn is
loved by those above.

He tills the Earth. He mingles with the Elements by reason of the
swiftness of his mind. He plunges into the Sea’s depths by means of
its <span id="fr_699"></span>[2](#fn_698) profundity. He puts his values
on all things.

Heaven seems not too high for him; for it is

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

measured by the wisdom of his mind as though it were quite near.

No darkness of the Air obstructs the penetration of his mind. No density
of Earth impedes his work. No depth of Water blunts his sight. <span
id="fr_700"></span>[1](#fn_699)

\[Though still\] the same \[yet\] is he all, and everywhere is he the
same.

3\. Of all these genera, those \[species\] which are animal have
\[many\] roots, which stretch from the above below, <span
id="fr_701"></span>[2](#fn_700) whereas those which are stationary <span
id="fr_702"></span>[3](#fn_701)—these from \[one\] living root send
forth a wood of branching greenery up from below into the upper parts.

Moreover, some of them are nourished with a two-fold form of food, while
others with a single form.

Twain are the forms of food—for soul and body, of which \[all\] animals
consist. Their soul is nourished by the ever-restless motion of the
World <span id="fr_703"></span>[4](#fn_702); their bodies have their
growth from

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

foods \[drawn\] from the water and the earth of the inferior
world. <span id="fr_704"></span>[1](#fn_703)

Spirit, <span id="fr_705"></span>[2](#fn_704) with which they <span
id="fr_706"></span>[3](#fn_705) all are filled, being interblended with
the rest, <span id="fr_707"></span>[4](#fn_706) doth make them live;
sense being added, and also reason in the case of man—which hath been
given to man alone as a fifth part out of the æther.

Of all the living things <span id="fr_708"></span>[5](#fn_707) \[God\]
doth adorn, extend, exalt, the sense of man alone unto the understanding
of the Reason of Divinity. <span id="fr_709"></span>[6](#fn_708)

But since I am impressed to speak concerning Sense, I will a little
further on set forth for you the sermon on this \[point\]; for that it
is most holy, and \[most\] mighty, not less than in the Reason of
Divinity itself.

#### VII

1\. But now I’ll finish for you what I have begun. For I was speaking at
the start of union with the Gods, by which men only <span
id="fr_710"></span>[7](#fn_709) consciously enjoy <span
id="fr_711"></span>[8](#fn_710) the Gods’ regard,—I mean whatever men
have won such rapture that they have obtained a share of that Divine
Sense of intelligence which

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

is the most <span id="fr_712"></span>[1](#fn_711) Divine of Senses,
found in God and in man’s reason.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Asc.* Are not the senses of all men, Thrice-greatest one, the same?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* Nay, \[my\] Asclepius, all have not won true reason <span
id="fr_713"></span>[2](#fn_712); but wildly rushing in pursuit of
\[reason’s\] counterfeit, <span id="fr_714"></span>[3](#fn_713) they
never see the thing itself, and are deceived. And this breeds evil in
their minds, and \[thus\] transforms the best of animals into the nature
of a beast and manners of the brutes.

2\. But as to Sense and all things similar, I will set forth the whole
discourse when \[I explain\] concerning Spirit.

For man is the sole animal that is twofold. One part of him is simple:
the \[man\] “essential,” <span id="fr_715"></span>[4](#fn_714) as say
the Greeks, but which we call the “form of the Divine Similitude.”

He also is fourfold: that which the Greeks call “hylic,” <span
id="fr_716"></span>[5](#fn_715) \[but\] which we call “cosmic”; of which
is made the corporal part, in which is vestured what we just have said
is the divine in man, <span id="fr_717"></span>[6](#fn_716)—in which the
godhead of the Mind alone,

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

together with its kin, that is the Pure Mind’s senses, findeth home and
rest, its self with its own self, as though shut in the body’s walls.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_697"></span>[316:1](th239.htm#fr_698) This contradicts
somewhat the more careful wording of *C. H.*, x. (xi.) 1, where the term
Energy is preferred.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[316:2](th239.htm#fr_699) *Sc.* the mind’s.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[317:1](th239.htm#fr_700) *Cf.* *C. H.*, xi.
(xii.) 19.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[317:2](th239.htm#fr_701) Compare with this the
symbolism of the “fire-tree” and the “rootage” of the æons, in the
“Simonian” system of the Gnōsis, taken by Hippolytus from the document
entitled *The Great Announcement* (Hipp., *Philos.*, vi. 9 and 18). Also
the common figure of the Ashvattha tree of Indo-Aryan mythology; for
instance, in the *Kaṭhopaniṣhad*, II. vi. 1: “The old, old tree that
sees no morrow’s dawn, \[stands\] roots up, branches down” (see Mead and
Chaṭṭopādhyāya’s *Upaniṣhads*, i. 74—London; 1896). Ashvatthaḥ =
*a-shvaḥ-tha*, that is, “which stands not till to-morrow.” The idea is
that the world-tree (*saṁsāravṛikṣha*) never lasts till to-morrow, for
all things are perpetually changing.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[317:3](th239.htm#fr_702) Lit. non-animal.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[317:4](th239.htm#fr_703) Or Cosmos.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[318:1](th239.htm#fr_704) *Cf.* xi. 2.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[318:2](th239.htm#fr_705) *Cf.* *C. H.*, x.
(xi.) 13, and Commentary thereon.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[318:3](th239.htm#fr_706) That is, animal
bodies.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[318:4](th239.htm#fr_707) Presumably the rest
of the Earth elements.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[318:5](th239.htm#fr_708) Lit. animals.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[318:6](th239.htm#fr_709) Lit. the Divine
Reason, *Ratio*, or *Logos.*

<span id="fn_709"></span>[318:7](th239.htm#fr_710) *Sc.* of the animals.
*Cf.* xviii. 1 below.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[318:8](th239.htm#fr_711) *Per-fruuntur.*
*Cf.*, for the idea, xxii. 1 below.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[319:1](th239.htm#fr_712) Lit. more.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[319:2](th239.htm#fr_713) *Cf.* *C. H.*, x.
(xi.) 23, 24; iv. (v.) 3; and ix. 3 below.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[319:3](th239.htm#fr_714) Lit. image.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[319:4](th239.htm#fr_715) The Greek term
οὐσιώδης is here retained. *Cf.* viii. 2 below.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[319:5](th239.htm#fr_716) The Greek ὑλικὸν
being retained in the Latin.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[319:6](th239.htm#fr_717) *Cf.* *C. H.*, xvi.
15.
