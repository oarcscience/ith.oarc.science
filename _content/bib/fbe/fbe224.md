### ODE 30.

An invitation to the thirsty.

1 Fill ye waters for yourselves from the living fountain of the Lord,
for it is opened to you:  
2 And come all ye thirsty, and take the draught; and rest by the
fountain of the Lord.  
3 For fair it is and pure and gives rest to the soul. Much more pleasant
are its waters than honey;  
4 And the honeycomb of bees is not to be compared with it.  
5 For it flows forth from the lips of the Lord and from the heart of the
Lord is its name.  
6 And it came infinitely and invisibly: and until it was set in the
midst they did not know it:  
7 Blessed are they who have drunk therefrom and have found rest thereby.
Hallelujah.
