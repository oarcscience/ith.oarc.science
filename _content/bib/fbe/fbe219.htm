<p>1 I was rescued from my bonds and unto thee, my God, I fled:<br> 2 For thou art the right hand of my Salvation and my helper.<br> 3 Thou hast restrained those that rise up against me,<br> 4 And I shall see him no more: because thy face was with me, which saved me by thy grace.<br> 5 But I was despised and rejected in the eye of many: and I was in their eyes like lead,<br> 6 And strength was mine from thyself and help.<br> 7 Thou didst set me a lamp at my right hand and at my left: and in me there shall be nothing that is not bright:<br> 8 And I was clothed with the covering of thy Spirit, and thou didst remove from me my raiment of skin;<br> 9 For thy right hand lifted me up and removed sickness from me:<br> 10 And I became mighty in: the truth, and holy by thy righteousness; and all my adversaries were afraid of me;<br> 11 And I became admirable by the name of the Lord, and was justified by His gentleness, and His rest is for ever and ever. Hallelujah.</p>
