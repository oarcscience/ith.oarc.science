### LXVIII.

ENOCH was born on the sixth day of the month Tsivan, and lived three
hundred and sixty-five years.

2 He was taken up to heaven on the first day of the month Tsivan and
remained in heaven sixty days.

3 He wrote all these signs of all creation, which the Lord created, and
wrote three hundred and sixty-six books, and handed them over to his
sons and remained on earth thirty days, and was again taken up to heaven
on the sixth day of the month Tsivan, on the very day and hour when he
was born.

4 As every man's nature in this life is dark, so are also his
conception, birth, and departure from this life.

5 At what hour he was conceived, at that hour he was born, and at that
hour too he died.

6 Methosalam and his brethren, all the sons of Enoch, made haste, and
erected an altar at the place called Achuzan, whence and where Enoch had
been taken up to heaven.

7 And they took sacrificial oxen and summoned all people and sacrificed
the sacrifice before the Lord's face.

8 All people, the elders of the people and the whole assembly

came to the feast and brought gifts to the sons of Enoch.

9 And they made a great feast, rejoicing and making merry three days,
praising God, who had given them such a sign through Enoch, who had
found favour with him, and that they should hand it on to their sons
from generation to generation, from age to age.

10 Amen.
