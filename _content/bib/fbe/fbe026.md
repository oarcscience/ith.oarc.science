### CHAP. XXI.

Adam and Eve attempt suicide.

THEN Adam and Eve went in search of the garden.

2 And the heat beat like a flame on their faces; and they sweated from
the heat, and wept before the Lord.

3 But the place where they wept was nigh unto a high mountain, facing
the western gate of the garden.

4 Then Adam threw himself down from the top of that mountain; his face
was tom and his flesh was flayed; much blood flowed from him, and he was
nigh unto death.

5 Meanwhile Eve remained standing on the mountain weeping over him, thus
lying.

6 And she said, "I wish not to live after him; for all that he did to
himself was through me."

7 Then she threw herself after him; and was torn and scotched by stones;
and remained lying as dead.

8 But the merciful God, who looks upon His creatures, looked upon Adam
and Eve as they lay dead, and He sent His Word unto them, and raised
them.

9 And said to Adam, "O Adam, all this misery which thou hast wrought
upon thyself, will not avail against My rule, neither will it alter the
covenant of the 5500 years."
