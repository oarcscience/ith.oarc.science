### CHAP. LIII.

The prophecy of the Western Lands.

THEY were not very far from the cave, when Satan came towards them, and
hid himself between them and the cave, under the form of two ravenous
lions three days without food, that came towards Adam and Eve, as if to
break them in pieces and devour them.

2 Then Adam and Eve wept, and prayed God to deliver them from their
paws.

3 Then the Word of God came to them, and drove away the lions from them.

4 And God said unto Adam, "O Adam, what seekest thou on the western
border? And why hast thou left of thine own accord the eastern border,
in which was thy dwelling-place?

5 "Now, then, turn back to thy cave, and remain in it, that Satan do not
deceive thee, nor work his purpose upon thee.

6 "For in this western border, O Adam, there will go from thee a seed,
that shall replenish it; and that will defile themselves with their
sins, and with their yielding to the behests of Satan, and by following
his works.

7 "Therefore will I bring upon them the waters of a flood, and overwhelm
them all. But I will deliver what is left of the righteous among them;
and I will bring them to a distant land, and the land in which thou
dwellest now shall remain desolate and without one inhabitant in it."

8 After God had thus discoursed to them, they went back to the Cave of
Treasures. But their flesh was dried up, and their strength failed from
fasting and praying, and from the sorrow they felt at having trespassed
against God.
