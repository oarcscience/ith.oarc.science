### XLII.

Of how Enoch saw the key-holders and guards of the gates of hell
standing.

SAW the key-holders and guards of the gates of hell standing, like great
serpents, and their faces like extinguished lamps, and their eyes of
fire, their sharp teeth, and I saw all the Lord's works, how they are
right, while the works of man are some *good*, and others bad, and in
their works are known those who lie evilly.
