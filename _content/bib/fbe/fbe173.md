### LXVI.

Enoch instructs his sons and all the elders of the people, how they are
to walk with terror and trembling before the Lord, and serve him alone
and not bow down to idols, but to God, who created heaven and earth and.
every creature, and to his image.

AND now, my children, keep your souls from all injustice, such as the
Lord hates.

2 Walk before his face with terror and trembling and serve him alone.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

3 Bow down to the true God, not to dumb idols, but bow down to his
picture, and bring all just offerings before the Lord's face. The Lord
hates what is unjust.

4 For the Lord sees all things; when man takes thought in his heart,
then he counsels the intellects, and every thought is always before the
Lord, who made firm the earth and put all creatures on it.

5 If you look to heaven, the Lord is there; if you take thought of the
sea's deep and all the under-earth, the Lord is there.

6 For the Lord created all things. Bow not down to things made by man,
leaving the Lord of all creation, because no work can remain hidden
before the Lord's face.

7 Walk, my children, in longsuffering, in meekness, honesty, in
provocation, in grief, in faith and in truth, in *reliance on* promises,
in illness, in abuse, in wounds, in temptation, in nakedness, in
privation, loving one another, till you go out from this age of ills,
that you become inheritors of endless time.

8 Blessed are the just who shall escape the great judgement, for they
shall shine forth more than the sun sevenfold, for in this world the
seventh part is taken off from all, light, darkness, food, enjoyment,
sorrow, paradise, torture, fire, frost, and other things; he put all
down in writing, that you might read and understand.'
