<p>Enoch instructs his sons not to swear either by heaven or earth, and shows God's promise, even in the mother's womb</i>.</p> 
<p>I SWEAR to you, my children, but I swear not by any oath, neither by heaven nor by earth, nor by any other creature which God created.</p> 
<p>2 The Lord said: 'There is no oath in me, nor injustice, but truth.'</p> 
<p>3 If there is no truth in men, let them swear by the words 'yea, yea,' or else, 'nay, nay!</p> 
<p>4 And I swear to you, yea, yea, that there has been no man in his mother's womb, <i>but that</i> already before, even to each one there is a place prepared for the repose of the soul, and a measure</p>
