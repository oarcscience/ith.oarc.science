<p>A beautiful sketch of Paradise regained and the blessedness of those who have returned to the privileges of the fallen Adam</i>.</p> 
<p>1 My heart was cloven and its flower appeared; and grace sprang up in it: and it brought forth fruit to the Lord,<br> 2 For the Most High clave my heart by His Holy Spirit and searched my affection towards Him: and filled me with His love.<br> 3 And His opening of me became my salvation; and I ran in His way in His peace, even in the way of truth:<br> 4 From the beginning and even to the end I acquired His knowledge:<br> 5 And I was established upon the rock of truth, where He had set me up: <a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></A><br> 6 And speaking waters touched my lips from the fountain of the Lord plenteously:<br> 7 And I drank and was inebriated with the living water that doth not die;<br> 8 And my inebriation was not one without knowledge, but I forsook vanity and turned to the Most High my God,<br> 9 And I was enriched by His bounty, and I forsook the folly which is diffused over the earth; and I stripped it off and cast it from me:<br> 10 And the Lord renewed me in His raiment, and possessed me by His light, and from above He gave me rest in incorruption;<br> 11 And I became like the land which blossoms and rejoices in its fruits:<br> 12 And the Lord was like the sun shining on the face of the land;<br> 13 He lightened my eyes, and my face received the dew; and my nostrils enjoyed the pleasant odour of the Lord;<br> 14 And He carried me to His Paradise; where is the abundance of the pleasure of the Lord;<br> 15 And I worshipped the Lord on account of His glory; and I said, Blessed, O Lord, are they who are planted in thy land! and those who have a place in thy Paradise;<br> 16 And they grow by the fruits of the trees. And they have changed from darkness to light.<br> 17 Behold! all thy servants are fair, who do good works, and turn away from wickedness to the pleasantness that is thine:<br> 18 And they have turned back the bitterness of the trees from them, when they were planted in thy, land;<br> 19 And everything became like a relic of thyself, and memorial for ever of thy faithful works.<br> 20 For there is abundant room in thy Paradise, and nothing is useless therein;<br> 21 But everything is filled with fruit; glory be to thee, O God, the delight of Paradise for ever. Hallelujah.</p>
