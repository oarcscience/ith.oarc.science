### ODE 20.

A mixture of ethics and mysticism; of the golden rule and the tree of
life.

1 I am a priest of the Lord, and to Him I do priestly service: and to
Him I offer the sacrifice of His thought.  
2 For His thought is not like the thought of the world nor the thought
of the flesh, nor like them that serve carnally.  
3 The sacrifice of the Lord is righteousness, and purity of heart and
lips.  
4 Present your reins before Him blamelessly: and let not thy heart do
violence to heart, nor thy soul to soul.  
5 Thou shalt not acquire a stranger by the price of thy silver, neither
shalt thou seek to devour thy neighbour,  
6 Neither shalt thou deprive him of the covering of his nakedness.  
7 But put on the grace of the Lord without stint; and come into His
Paradise and make thee a garland from its tree,  
8 And put it on thy head and be glad; and recline on His rest, and glory
shall go before thee,  
9 And thou shalt receive of His kindness and of His grace; and thou
shalt be flourishing in truth in the praise of His holiness. Praise and
honour be to His name. Hallelujah.
