<p>The right hand of the Lord hath covered me;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of the Lord hath spared us.<br> The arm of the Lord hath saved us from the sword that passed through,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;From famine and the death of sinners.<br> Noisome beasts ran upon them:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With their teeth they tore their flesh,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And with their molars crushed their bones.<br> But from all these things the Lord delivered us. <a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></A><br> The righteous was troubled on account of his errors,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Lest he should be taken away along with the sinners;<br> For terrible is the overthrow of the sinner;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But not one of all these things toucheth the righteous.<br> For not alike are the chastening of the righteous for sins done in ignorance,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the overthrow of the sinners.<br> Secretly is the righteous chastened,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the sinner rejoice over the righteous.<br> For He correcteth the righteous as a beloved son.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And his chastisement is as that of a first-born.<br> For the Lord spareth His pious ones,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And blotteth out their errors by His chastening.<br> For the life of the righteous shall be for ever;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But sinners shall be taken away into destruction,,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And their memorial shall be found no more.<br> But upon the pious is the mercy of the Lord,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And upon them that fear Him His mercy.</p>
