<p align="CENTER">The angels took Enoch and placed him in the east at the sun's gates</i>.</p> 
<p>THOSE men bore me away to the east, and placed me at the sun's gates, where the sun goes forth according to the regulation of the seasons and the circuit of the months of the whole year, and the number of the hours day and night,</p> 
<p>2 And I saw six gates open, each gate having sixty-one stadia and a quarter of one stadium, and I measured <i>them</i> truly, and understood their size <i>to be</i> so much, through which the sun goes forth, and goes to the west, and is made even, and rises throughout all the months, and turns back again from the six gates according to the succession of the seasons; thus <i>the period</i> of the whole year is finished after the returns of the four seasons,</p>
