<p>Jared turns martinet. He is lured away to the land of Cain where he sees many voluptuous sights. Jared barely escapes with a clean heart</i>.</p> 
<p>THEN Jared kept his father's commandment, and arose like a lion over his people. He fed them in righteousness and innocence, and commanded them to do nothing without his counsel. For he was afraid concerning them, lest they should go to the children of Cain.</p> 
<p>2 Wherefore did he give them orders repeatedly; and continued to do so until the end of the four hundred and eighty-fifth year of his life.</p> 
<p>3 At the end of these said years, there came unto him this sign. As Jared was standing like a lion before the bodies of his fathers, praying and warning his people, Satan envied him, and wrought a beautiful apparition, because Jared would not let his children do aught without his counsel.</p> 
<p>4 Satan then appeared to him with thirty men of his hosts, in the form of handsome men; Satan himself being the elder and tallest among them, with a fine beard.</p> 
<p>5 They stood at the mouth of the cave, and called out Jared, from within it.</p> 
<p>6 He came out to them, and found them looking like fine men, full of light, and of great beauty. He wondered at their beauty and at their looks; and thought within himself whether they might not be of the children of Cain.</p> 
<p>7 He said also in his heart, "As the children of Cain cannot come up to the height of this mountain, and none of them is so handsome as these appear to be; and among these men there is not one of my kindred--they must be strangers."</p> 
<p>8 Then Jared and they exchanged a greeting and he said to the elder among them, "O my father, explain to me the wonder that is in thee, and tell me who these are, with thee; for they look to me like strange men."</p> 
<p>9 Then the elder began to weep, and the rest wept with him; and he said to Jared: "I am Adam whom God made first; and this is Abel my son, who was killed by his brother Cain, into whose heart Satan put to murder him.</p> 
<p>10 "Then this is my son Seth, whom I asked of the Lord, who gave him to me, to comfort me instead of Abel.</p> 
<p>11 "Then this one is my son Enos, son of Seth, and that other one is Cainan, son of Enos, and that other one is Mahalaleel, son of Cainan, thy father."</p> 
<p>12 But Jared remained wondering at their appearance, and at the speech of the elder to him.</p> 
<p>13 Then the elder said to him, "Marvel not, O my son; we live in the land north of the garden, which God created before the</p> 
<p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="green">p. 73</font></A></p> 
<p>world. He would not let us live there, but placed us inside the garden, below which ye are now dwelling.</p> 
<p>14 "But after that I transgressed, He made me come out of it, and I was left to dwell in this cave; great and sore troubles came upon me; and when my death drew near, I commanded my son Seth to tend his people well; and this my commandment is to be handed from one to another, unto the end of the generations to come.</p> 
<p>15 "But, O Jared, my son, we live in beautiful regions, while you live here in misery, as this thy father Mahalaleel informed me; telling me that a great flood will come and overwhelm the whole earth.</p> 
<p>16 "Therefore, O my son, fearing for your sakes, I rose and took my children with me, and came hither for us to visit thee and thy children; but I found thee standing in this cave weeping, and thy children scattered about this mountain, in the heat and in misery.</p> 
<p>17 "But, O my son, as we missed our way, and came as far as this, we found other men below this mountain; who inhabit a beautiful country, full of trees and of fruits, and of all manner of verdure; it is like a garden; so that when we found them we thought they were you; until thy father Mahalaleel told me they were no such thing.</p> 
<p>18 "Now, therefore, O my son, hearken to my counsel, and go down to them, thou and thy children. Ye will rest from all this suffering in which ye are. But if thou wilt not go down to them, then, arise, take thy children, and come with us to our garden; ye shall live in our beautiful land, and ye shall rest from all this trouble, which thou and thy children are now bearing."</p> 
<p>19 But Jared when he heard this discourse from the elder, wondered; and went hither and thither, but at that moment he found not one of his children.</p> 
<p>20 Then he answered and said to the elder, "Why have you hidden yourselves until this day?"</p> 
<p>21 And the elder replied, "If thy father had not told us, we should not have known it."</p> 
<p>22 Then Jared believed his words were true.</p> 
<p>23 So that elder said to Jared, "Wherefore didst thou turn about, so and so?" And he said, "I was seeking one of my children, to tell him about my going with you, and about their coming down to those about whom thou hast spoken to me."</p> 
<p>24 When the elder heard Jared's intention, he said to him, "Let alone that purpose at present, and come with us; thou shalt see our country; if the land in which we dwell pleases thee, we and thou shall return hither and take thy family with us. But if our country does not please thee, thou shalt come back to thine own place."</p> 
<p>25 And the elder urged Jared, to go before one of his children came to counsel him otherwise.</p> 
<p>26 Jared, then, came out of the cave and went with them, and among them. And they comforted him, until they came to the top of the mountain of the sons of Cain.</p> 
<p>27 Then said the elder to one of his companions, "We have forgotten something by the mouth of the cave, and that is the chosen garment we had brought to clothe Jared withal."</p> 
<p>28 He then said to one of them, "Go back, thou, some one; and we will wait for thee here, until thou come back. Then will we clothe Jared and he shall be like us, good, handsome, and fit to come with us into our country."</p> 
<p>29 Then that one went back.</p> 
<p>30 But when he was a short</p> 
<p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></A></p> 
<p>distance off, the elder called to him and said to him, "Tarry thou, until I come up and speak to thee."</p> 
<p>31 Then he stood still, and the elder went up to him and said to him, "One thing we forgot at the cave, it is this--to put out the lamp that burns inside it, above the bodies that are therein. Then come back to us, quick."</p> 
<p>32 That one went, and the elder came back to his fellows and to Jared. And they came down from the mountain, and Jared with them; and they stayed by a fountain of water, near the houses of the children of Cain, and waited for their companion until he brought the garment for Jared.</p> 
<p>33 He, then, who went, back to the cave, put out the lamp, and came to them and brought a phantom with him and showed it them. And when Jared saw it he wondered at the beauty and grace thereof, and rejoiced in his heart believing it was all true.</p> 
<p>34 But while they were staying there, three of them went into houses of the sons of Cain, and said to them, "Bring us to-day some food by the fountain of water, for us and our companions to eat."</p> 
<p>35 But when the sons of Cain saw them, they wondered at them and thought: "These are beautiful to look at, and such as we never saw before." So they rose and came with them to the fountain of water, to see their companions.</p> 
<p>36 They found them so very handsome, that they cried aloud about their places for others to gather together and come and look at these beautiful beings. Then they gathered around them both men and women.</p> 
<p>37 Then the elder said to them, "We are strangers in your land, bring us some good food and drink you and your women, to refresh ourselves with you."</p> 
<p>38 When those men heard these words of the elder, every one of Cain's sons brought his wife, and another brought his daughter, and so, many women came to them; every one addressing Jared either for himself or for his wife; all alike.</p> 
<p>39 But when Jared saw what they did, his very soul wrenched itself from them; neither would he taste of their food or of their drink.</p> 
<p>40 The elder saw hint as he wrenched himself from them, and said to him, "Be not sad; I am the great elder, as thou shalt see me do, do thyself in like manner."</p> 
<p>41 Then he spread his hands and took one of the women, and five of his companions did the same before Jared, that he should do as they did.</p> 
<p>42 But when Jared saw them working infamy he wept, and said in his mind,--My fathers never did the like.</p> 
<p>43 He then spread his hands and prayed with a fervent heart, and with much weeping, and entreated God to deliver him from their hands.</p> 
<p>44 No sooner did Jared begin to pray than the elder fled with his companions; for they could not abide in a place of prayer.</p> 
<p>45 Then Jared turned round but could not see them, but found himself standing in the midst of the children of Cain.</p> 
<p>46 He then wept and said, "O God, destroy me not with this race, concerning which my fathers have warned me; for now, O my Lord God, I was thinking that those who appeared unto me were my fathers; but I have found them out to be devils, who allured me by this beautiful apparition, until I believed them.</p> 
<p>47 "But now I ask Thee, O God, to deliver me from this race, among whom I am now</p> 
<p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></A></p> 
<p>staying, as Thou didst deliver me from those devils. Send Thy angel to draw me out of the midst of them; for I have not myself power to escape from among them."</p> 
<p>48 When Jared had ended his prayer, God sent His angel in the midst of them, who took Jared and set him upon the mountain, and showed him the way, gave him counsel, and then departed from him.</p>
