<p>The exile of the tribes of Israel. A reference to the covenant which God made with Adam</i>. (<i>See the First Book of Adam and Eve, Chap. III, Verse 7</i>).</p> 
<p>When Israel was led away captive into a strange land,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When they fell away from the Lord who redeemed them,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They were cast away from the inheritance, which the Lord had given them.<br> Among every nation were the dispersed of Israel according to the word of God,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That Thou mightest be justified, O God, in Thy righteousness by reason of our transgressions:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For Thou art a just judge over all the peoples of the earth.<br> For from Thy knowledge none that doeth unjustly is hidden,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the righteous deeds of Thy pious ones are before Thee, O Lord;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where, then, can a man hide himself from Thy knowledge, O God?<br> Our works are subject to our own choice and power<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To do right or wrong in the works of our hands;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And in Thy righteousness Thou visitest the sons of men.<br> He that doeth righteousness layeth up life for himself with the Lord;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And he that doeth wrongly forfeits his life to destruction; <a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></A><br> For the judgements of the Lord are given in righteousness to every man and his house.<br> Unto whom art Thou good, O God, except to them that call upon the Lord?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He cleanseth from sins a soul when it maketh confession, when it maketh acknowledgement;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For shame is upon us and u on our faces on account of all these things.<br> And to whom doth He forgive sins, except to them that have sinned?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou blessest the righteous, and dost not reprove them for the sins that they have committed;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And Thy goodness is upon them that sin, when they repent.<br> And, now, Thou art our God, and we the people whom Thou hast loved:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Behold and show pity, O God of Israel, for we are Thine;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And remove not Thy mercy from us, lest they assail us.<br> For Thou didst choose the seed of Abraham before all the nations,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And didst set Thy name upon us, O Lord,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And Thou wilt not reject us for ever.<br> Thou madest a covenant with our fathers concerning us;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And we hope in Thee, when our soul turneth unto Thee.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The mercy of the Lord be upon the house of Israel for ever and ever.</p>
