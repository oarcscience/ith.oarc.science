<p>KNOW ye therefore, my children, that in the last times your sons will forsake singleness, and will cleave unto insatiable desire.</p> 
<p>2 And leaving guilelessness, will draw near to malice; and forsaking the commandments of the Lord, they will cleave unto Beliar.</p> 
<p>3 And leaving husbandry, they will follow after their own wicked devices, and they shall be dispersed among the Gentiles, and shall serve their enemies.</p> 
<p>4 And do you therefore give these commands to your children, that, if they sin, they may the more quickly return to the Lord; For He is merciful, and will deliver them, even to bring them back into their land.</p> 
<p>5 Behold, therefore, as ye see, I am a hundred and twenty-six years old and am not conscious of committing any sin.</p> 
<p>6 Except my wife I have not known any woman. I never committed fornication by the uplifting of my eyes.</p> 
<p>7 I drank not wine, to be led astray thereby;</p> 
<p>8 I coveted not any desirable thing that was my neighbour's.</p> 
<p>9 Guile arose not in my heart;</p> 
<p>10 A lie passed not through my lips.</p> 
<p>11 If any man were in distress I joined my sighs with his,</p> 
<p>12 And I shared my bread with the poor.</p> 
<p>13 I wrought godliness, all my days I kept truth.</p> 
<p>14 I loved the Lord; likewise also every man with all my heart.</p> 
<p>15 So do you also these things, my children, and every spirit of Beliar shall flee from you, and no deed of wicked men shall rule over you;</p> 
<p>16 And every wild beast shall ye subdue, since you have with you the God of heaven and earth and walk with men in singleness of heart.</p> 
<p>17 And having said these things, he commanded his sons that they should carry him up to Hebron, and bury him there in the cave with his fathers.</p> 
<p>18 And he stretched out his feet and died, at a good old age; with every limb sound, and with strength unabated, he slept the eternal sleep.</p>
