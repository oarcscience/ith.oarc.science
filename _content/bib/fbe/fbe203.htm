<p>We shall never know surely whether the wars referred to here are spiritual or actual outward wars</i>.</p> 
<p>1 Open your ears and I will speak to you. Give me <a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></A> your souls that I may also give you my soul,<br> 2 The word of the Lord and His good pleasures, the holy thought which He has devised concerning his Messiah.<br> 3 For in the will of the Lord is your salvation, and His thought is everlasting life; and your end is immortality.<br> q Be enriched in God the Father, and receive the thought of the Most High.<br> 5 Be strong and be redeemed by His grace.<br> 6 For I announce to you peace, to you His saints;<br> 7 That none of those who hear may fall in war, and that those again who have known Him may not perish, and that those who receive may not be ashamed.<br> 8 An everlasting crown for ever is Truth. Blessed are they who set it on their heads:<br> 9 A stone of great price is it; and there have been wars on account of the crown.<br> 10 And righteousness hath taken it and hath given it to you.<br> 11 Put on the crown in the true covenant of the Lord.<br> 12 And all those who have conquered shall be written in His book.<br> 13 For their book is victory which is yours. And she (Victory) sees you before her and wills that you shall be saved. Hallelujah.</p>
