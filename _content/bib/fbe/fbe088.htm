<p align="CENTER">Adam sees the Devil in his true colors</i>.</p> 
<p>THEN God ordered Satan to show himself to Adam in plainly, in his own hideous form.</p> 
<p>2 But when Adam saw him, he feared, and trembled at the sight of him.</p> 
<p>3 And God said to Adam, "Look at this devil, and at his hideous look, and know that he it is who made thee fall from brightness into darkness, from peace and rest to toil and misery.</p>

<p>woman? Is there any one stronger than God? And can He be overpowered?</p> 
<p>5 "See, then, O Adam, and behold him bound in thy presence, in the air, unable to flee away! Therefore, I say unto thee, be not afraid of him; henceforth take care, and beware of him, in whatever he may do to thee."</p> 
<p>6 Then God drove Satan away from before Adam, whom He strengthened, and whose heart He comforted, saying to him, "Go down to the Cave of Treasures, and separate not thyself from Eve; I will quell in you all animal lust."</p> 
<p>7 From that hour it left Adam and Eve, and they enjoyed rest by the commandment of God. But God did not the like to any one of Adam's seed; but only to Adam and Eve.</p> 
<p>8 Then Adam worshipped before the Lord, for having delivered him, and for having layed his passions. And he came down from above the cave, and dwelt with Eve as aforetime.</p> 
<p>9 This ended the forty days of his separation from Eve.</p>
