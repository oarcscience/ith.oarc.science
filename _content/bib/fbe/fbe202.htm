<p>Note the sudden transition from the person of the Psalmist to the person of the Lord (v. 10). This is like the canonical Psalter in style</i>.</p> 
<p>1 Open ye, open ye your hearts to the exultation of the Lord:<br> 2 And let your love be multiplied from the heart and even to the lips,<br> 3 To bring forth fruit to the Lord [fruit], holy [fruit], and to talk with watchfulness in His light.<br> 4 Rise up, and stand erect, ye who sometime were brought low:<br> 5 Tell forth ye who were in silence, that your mouth hath been opened.<br> 6 Ye, therefore, that were despised, be henceforth lifted up, because your righteousness hath been exalted.<br> 7 For the right hand of the Lord is with you: and He is your helper:<br> 8 And peace was prepared for you, before ever your war was.<br> 9 Hear the word of truth, and receive the knowledge of the Most High.<br> 10 Your flesh has not known what I am saying to you neither have your hearts known what I am showing to you.<br> 11 Keep my secret, ye who are kept by it:<br> 12 Keep my faith, ye who are kept by it.<br> 13 And understand my knowledge, ye who know me in truth.<br> 14 Love me with affection, ye who love:<br> 15 For I do not turn away my face from them that are mine;<br> 16 For I know them, and before they came into being I took knowledge of them, and on their faces I set my seal:<br> 17 I fashioned their members: my own breasts I prepared for them, that they might drink my holy milk and live thereby.<br> 181 took pleasure in them and am not ashamed of them:<br> 19 For my workmanship are they and the strength of my thoughts:<br> 20 Who then shall rise up against my handiwork, or who is there that is not subject to them?<br> 21 I willed and fashioned mind and heart: and they are mine, and by my own right hand I set my elect ones:<br> 22 And my righteousness goeth before them and they shall not be deprived of my name, for it is with them.<br> 23 Ask, and abound and abide in the love of the Lord,<br> 24 And yet beloved ones in the Beloved: those who are kept, in Him that liveth:<br> 25 And they that are saved in Him that was saved;<br> 26 And ye shall be found incorrupt in all ages to the name of your Father. Hallelujah.</p>
