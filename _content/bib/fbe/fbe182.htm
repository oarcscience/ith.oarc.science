<p align="CENTER">A song of hope and fearlessness and peace</i>.</p> 
<p>Happy is the man whose heart is fixed to call upon the name of the Lord;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When he remembereth the name of the Lord, he will be saved.<br> His ways are made even by the Lord,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the works of his hands are preserved by the Lord his God.<br> At what he sees in his bad dreams, his soul shall not be troubled;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When he passes through rivers and the tossing of the seas, he shall not be dismayed.<br> He ariseth from his sleep, and blesseth the name of the Lord:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When his heart is at peace, he singeth to the name of his God,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And he entreateth the Lord for all his house.<br> And the Lord heareth the prayer of every one that feareth God,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And every request of the soul that hopes for Him doth the Lord accomplish.</p> 
<p>Blessed is the Lord, who showeth mercy to those who love Him in sincerity.</p>
