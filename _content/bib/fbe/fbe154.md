### XLVII.

Enoch instructs his sons from God's lips, and hands them the handwriting
of this book.

AND now, my children, lay thought on your hearts, mark well the words of
your father, which are all come to you from the Lord's lips.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

2 Take these books of your father's handwriting and read them.

3 For the books are many, and in them you will learn all the Lord's
works, all that has been from the beginning of creation, and will be
till the end of time.

4 And if you will observe my handwriting, you will not sin against the
Lord; because there is no other except the Lord, neither in heaven, nor
in earth, nor in the very lowest places, nor in the one foundation.

5 The Lord has placed the foundations in the unknown, and has spread
forth heavens visible and invisible; he fixed the earth on the waters,
and created countless creatures, and who has counted the water and the
foundation of the unfixed, or the dust of the earth, or the sand of the
sea, or the drops of the rain, or the morning dew, or the wind's
breathings? Who has filled earth and sea, and the indissoluble winter?

6 I cut the stars out of fire, and decorated heaven, and put it in their
midst.
