### CHAP. XXII.

Adam in a chivalrous mood.

THEN Adam said to God, "I wither in the heat; I am faint from walking,
and am loth of this world. And I know not when Thou wilt bring me out of
it, to rest."

2 Then the Lord God said unto him, "O Adam, it cannot be at present, not
until thou hast ended thy days. Then shall I bring thee out of this
wretched land."

3 And Adam said to God, "While I was in the garden I knew neither heat,
nor languor, neither moving about, nor trembling, nor fear; but now
since I came to this land, all this affliction has come upon me."

4 Then God said to Adam,

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "So long as thou
wast keeping My commandment, My light and My grace rested on thee. But
when thou didst transgress My commandment, sorrow and misery befell thee
in this land."

5 And Adam wept and said, "O Lord, do not cut me off for this, neither
smite me with heavy plagues, nor yet repay me according to my sin; For
we, of our own will, did transgress Thy commandment, and forsook Thy
law, and sought to become gods like unto Thee, when Satan the enemy
deceived us."

6 Then God said again unto Adam, "Because thou hast borne fear and
trembling in this land, languor and suffering treading and walking
about, going upon this mountain, and dying from it, I will take all this
upon Myself in order to save thee."
