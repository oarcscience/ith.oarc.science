<p>A glorious hymn. Further reference to the eternal covenant between God and Man</i>.</p> 
<p>Happy is the man whom the Lord remembereth with reproving,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And whom He restraineth from the way of evil with strokes<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That he may be cleansed from sin, that it may not be multiplied.<br> He that maketh ready his back for strokes shall be cleansed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For the Lord is good to them that endure chastening.<br> For He maketh straight the ways of the righteous,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And doth not pervert them by His chastening.<br> And the mercy of the Lord is upon them that love Him in truth,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lord remembereth His servants in mercy.<br> For the testimony is in the law of the eternal covenant,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The testimony of the Lord is on the ways of men in His visitation.<br> Just and kind is our Lord in His judgements for ever,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And Israel shall praise the name of the Lord in gladness.<br> And the pious shall give thanks in the assembly of the people;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And on the poor shall God have mercy in the gladness of Israel;<br> For good and merciful is God for ever,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the assemblies of Israel shall glorify the name of the Lord.</p> 
<p>The salvation of the Lord be upon the house of Israel unto everlasting gladness!</p>
