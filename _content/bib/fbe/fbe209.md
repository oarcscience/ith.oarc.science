### ODE 15.

One of the loveliest Odes in this unusual collection.

1 As the sun is the joy to them that seek for its daybreak, so is my joy
the Lord;  
2 Because He is my Sun and His rays have lifted me up; and His light
hath dispelled all darkness from my face.  
3 In Him I have acquired eyes and have seen His holy day:  
4 Ears have become mine and I have heard His truth.  
5 The thought of knowledge hath been mine, and I have been delighted
through Him.  
6 The way of error I have left, and have walked towards Him and have
received salvation from Him, without grudging. <span id="page_128">p.

7 And according to His bounty He hath given to me, and according to His
excellent beauty He hath made me.  
8 I have put on incorruption through His name: and have put oft
corruption by His grace.  
9 Death hath been destroyed before my face: and Sheol hath been
abolished by my word:  
10 And there hath gone up deathless life in the Lord's land,  
11 And it hath been made known to His faithful ones, and hath been given
without stint to all those that trust in Him. Hallelujah.
