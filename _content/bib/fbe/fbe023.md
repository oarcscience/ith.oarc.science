### CHAP. XVIII.

The mortal combat with the serpent.

WHEN the accursed serpent saw Adam and Eve, it swelled its head, stood
on its tail, and with eyes blood-red, did as if it would kill them.

2 It made straight for Eve, and ran after her; while Adam standing by,
wept because he had no stick in his hand wherewith to smite the serpent,
and knew not how to put it to death.

3 But with a heart burning for Eve, Adam approached the serpent, and
held it by the tail; when it turned towards him and said unto him:--

4 "O Adam, because of thee and of Eve, I am slippery, and go upon my
belly." Then by reason of its great strength, it threw down Adam and Eve
and pressed upon them, as if it would kill them.

5 But God sent an angel who threw the serpent away from them, and raised
them up.

6 Then the Word of God came to the serpent, and said unto it, "In the
first instance I made thee glib, and made thee to go upon thy belly; but
I did not deprive thee of speech.

7 "Now, however, be thou dumb; and speak no more, thou and thy race;
because in the first place, has the ruin of my creatures happened
through thee, and now thou wishest to kill them."

8 Then the serpent was struck dumb, and spake no more.

9 And a wind came to blow from heaven by command of God that carried
away the serpent from Adam and Eve, threw it on the sea shore, and it
landed in India.
