<p align="CENTER">Sinners "love the brief day spent in companionship with their sin." Profound wisdom, beautifully expressed</i>.</p> 
<p>Faithful is the Lord to them that love Him in truth,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To them that endure His chastening,<br> To them that walk in the righteousness of His commandments,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In the law which He commanded us that we might live.<br> The pious of the Lord shall live by it for ever;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Paradise of the Lord, the trees of life, are His pious ones.<br> Their planting is rooted for ever;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They shall not be plucked up all the days of heaven:<br> For the portion and the inheritance of God is Israel.<br> But not so are the sinners and transgressors,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who love the brief day spent in companionship with their sin;<br> Their delight is in fleeting corruption,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And they remember not God.<br> For the ways of men are known before Him at all times,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And He knoweth the secrets of the heart before they come to pass.<br> Therefore their inheritance is Sheol and darkness and destruction<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And they shall not be found in the day when the righteous obtain mercy;<br> But the pious of the Lord shall inherit life in gladness.</p>
