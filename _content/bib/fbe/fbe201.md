### ODE 7.

A wonderfully, simple and joyful psalm on the Incarnation.

1 As the impulse of anger against evil, so is the impulse of joy over
what is lovely, and brings in of its fruits without restraint:  
2 My joy is the Lord and my impulse is toward Him: this path of mine is
excellent:  
3 For I have a helper, the Lord.  
4 He hath caused me to know Himself, without grudging, by His
simplicity: His kindness has humbled His greatness.  
5 He became like me, in order that I might receive Him:  
6 He was reckoned like myself in order that I might put Him on;  
7 And I trembled not when I saw Him: because He was gracious to me:  
8 Like my nature He became that I might learn Him and like my form, that
I might not turn back from Him:  
9 The Father of knowledge is the word of knowledge:  
10 He who created wisdom is wiser than His works:  
11 And He who created me when yet I was not knew what I should do when I
came into being:  
12 Wherefore He pitied me in His abundant grace: and granted me to ask
from Him and to receive from His sacrifice:  
13 Because He it is that is incorrupt, the fulness of the ages and the
Father of them.  
14 He hath given Him to be seen of them that are His, in order that they
may recognize Him that made them: and that they might not suppose that
they came of themselves:  
15 For knowledge He hath appointed as its way, He hath widened it and
extended it; and brought to all perfection;  
16 And set over it the traces of His light, and I walked therein from
the beginning even to the end.  
17 For by Him it was wrought, and He was resting in the Son, and for its
salvation He will take hold of everything;  
18 And the Most High shall be known in His Saints, to announce to those
that have songs of the coming of the Lord;  
19 That they may go forth to meet Him, and may sing to Him with joy and
with the harp of many tones:  
20 The seers shall come before Him and they shall be seen before Him,  
21 And they shall praise the Lord for His love: because He is near and
beholdeth.  
22 And hatred shall be taken from the earth, and along with jealousy it
shall be drowned:  
23 For ignorance hath been destroyed, because the knowledge of the Lord
hath arrived.  
24 They who make songs shall sing the grace of the Lord Most High;  
25 And they shall bring their songs, and their heart shall be like the
day: and like the excellent beauty of the Lord their pleasant song:
<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>  
26 And there shall neither be anything that breathes without knowledge,
nor any that is dumb:  
27 For He hath given a mouth to His creation, to open the voice of the
mouth towards Him, to praise Him:  
28 Confess ye His power, and show forth His grace. Hallelujah.
