<p align="CENTER">Righteousness versus Sin</i>.</p> 
<p>Why sleepest thou, O my soul,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And blessest not the Lord?<br> Sing a new song,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Unto God who is worthy to be praised.<br> Sing and be wakeful against His awaking,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For good is a psalm sung to God from a glad heart.</p> 
<p>The righteous remember the Lord at all times,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With thanksgiving and declaration of the righteousness of the Lord's judgements.<br> The righteous despiseth not the chastening of the Lord;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His will is always before the Lord.<br> The righteous stumbleth and holdeth the Lord righteous:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He falleth and looketh out for what God will do to him;<br> He seeketh out whence his deliverance will come.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The steadfastness of the righteous is from God, their deliverer;<br> There lodgeth not in the house of the righteous sin upon sin.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The righteous continually searcheth his house,<br> To remove utterly all iniquity done by him in error.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He maketh atonement for sins of ignorance by fasting and afflicting his soul,<br> And the Lord counteth guiltless every pious man and his house. <a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The sinner stumbleth and curseth his life<br> The day when he was begotten, and his mother's travail.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He addeth sins to sins, while he liveth;<br> He falleth--verily grievous is his fall--and riseth no more.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The destruction of the sinner is for ever,<br> And he shall not be remembered, when the righteous is visited.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;This is the portion of sinners for ever.</p> 
<p>But they that fear the Lord shall rise to life eternal,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And their life shall be in the light of the Lord, and shall come to an end no more.</p>
