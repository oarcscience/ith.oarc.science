<p>The first words of this Ode have disappeared</i>.</p> 
<p>1 .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put on:<br> 2 And his members are with him. And on them do I stand, and He loves me:<br> 3 For I should not have known how to love the Lord, if He had not loved me.<br> 4 For who is able to distinguish love, except the one that is loved?<br> 5 I love the Beloved, and my soul loves Him:<br> 6 And where His rest is, there also am I;<br> 7 And I shall be no stranger, for with the Lord Most High and Merciful there is no grudging.<br> 8 I have been united to I-run, for the Lover has found the Beloved,<br> 9 And because I shall love Him that, is the Son, I shall become a son;<br> 10 For he that is joined to Him that is immortal, will also himself become immortal;<br> 11 And he who has pleasure in the Living One, will become living.<br> 12 This is the Spirit of the Lord, which doth not lie, which teacheth the sons of men to know His ways.<br> 13 Be wise and understanding and vigilant. Hallelujah.</p>
