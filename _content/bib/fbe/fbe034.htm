<p align="CENTER">God tells Adam of the Devil's purpose. (v. 4)</i>.</p> 
<p>BUT when the merciful God saw that Satan wished to kill Adam with his manifold devices, and saw that Adam was meek and without guile, God spake unto Satan in a loud voice, and cursed him.</p> 
<p>2 Then he and his hosts fled, and Adam and Eve remained standing on the top of the mountain, whence they saw below them the wide world, high above which they were. But they saw none of the host which anon were by them.</p> 
<p>3 They wept, both Adam and Eve, before God, and begged for forgiveness of Him.</p> 
<p>4 Then came the Word from God to Adam, and said unto him, "Know thou and understand concerning this Satan, that he seeks to deceive thee and thy seed after thee."</p> 
<p>5 And Adam wept before the Lord God, and begged and entreated Him to give him something from the garden, as a token to him, wherein to be comforted.</p> 
<p>6 And God looked upon Adam's thought, and sent the angel Michael as far as the sea that reaches unto India, to take</p>

<p>from thence golden rods and bring them to Adam.</p> 
<p>7 This did God in His wisdom, in order that these golden rods, being with Adam in the cave, should shine forth with light in the night around him, and put an end to his fear of the darkness.</p> 
<p>8 Then the angel Michael went down by God's order, took golden rods, as God had commanded him, and brought them to God.</p>
