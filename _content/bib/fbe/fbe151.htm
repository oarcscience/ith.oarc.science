<p align="CENTER">Enoch instructs his sons, that they revile not the face of man, small or great</i>.</p> 
<p>THE Lord with his hands having created man, in the likeness of his own face, the Lord made him small and great.</p> 
<p>2 Whoever reviles the ruler's face, and abhors the Lord's face, has despised the Lord's face, and tie who vents anger on any man without injury, the Lord's great anger will cut him down, he who spits on the face of man reproachfully, will be cut down at the Lord's great judgement.</p> 
<p>3 Blessed is the man who does not direct his heart with malice against any man, and helps the injured and condemned, and raises the broken down, and shall do charity to the needy, because on the day of the great judgement every weight, every measure and every makeweight <i>will be</i> as in the market, that is to say <i>they are</i> hung on scales and stand in the market, <i>and every one</i> shall learn his own measure, and according to his measure shall take his reward.</p>
