<p>Enoch instructs his sons to keep themselves from injustice and often to stretch forth hands to the poor, to give a share of their labours</i>.</p> 
<p>AND now, my children, keep your hearts from every injustice, which the Lord hates. Just as a man asks (<i>sc</i>. something) for his own soul from God, so let him do to every living soul, because I know all things, how in the great time (<i>sc</i>. to come) are many mansions prepared for men, good for the good, and bad for the bad, without number many.</p> 
<p>2 Blessed are those who enter the good houses, for in the bad (<i>sc</i>. houses) there is no peace .nor return (<i>sc</i>. from them).</p> 
<p>3 Hear, my children, small and great! When man puts a good thought in his heart, brings gifts from his labours before the Lord's face and his hands made them not, then the Lord will turn away his face from the labour of his hand, and he (sc. man) cannot find the labour of his hands.</p> 
<p>4 And if his hands made it, but his heart murmur, and his heart cease not making murmur incessantly, he has not any advantage.</p>
