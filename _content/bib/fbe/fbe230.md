### ODE 36.

Theologians have never agreed on an explanation of this perplexing Ode.

1 I rested in the Spirit of the Lord: and the Spirit raised me on
high:  
2 And made me stand on my feet in the height of the Lord, before His
perfection and His glory, while I was praising Him by the composition of
His songs.  
3 The Spirit brought me forth before the face of the Lord: and, although
a son of man, I was named the Illuminate, the Son of God:  
4 While I praised amongst the praising ones, and great was I amongst the
mighty ones.  
5 For according to the greatness of the Most High, so He made me: and
like His own newness He renewed me; and He anointed me from His own
perfection:  
6 And I became one of His Neighbours; and my mouth was opened, like a
cloud of dew,  
7 And my heart poured out as it were a gushing stream of
righteousness,  
8 And my access to Him was in peace; and I was established by the Spirit
of His government. Hallelujah.
