### II.

The Instruction. How Enoch instructed his sons.

LISTEN to me, my children, I know not whither I go, or what will befall
me; now therefore, my children, I tell you: turn not from God before the
face of the vain, who made not Heaven and earth, for these shall perish
and those who worship them, and may the Lord make confident your hearts
in the fear of him. And now, my children, let no one think to seek me,
until the Lord return me to you.
