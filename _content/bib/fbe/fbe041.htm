<p align="CENTER">Figs</i>.</p> 
<p>THEN God commanded the cherub, who kept the gate of the garden with a sword of fire in his hand, to take some of the fruit of the fig-tree, and to give it to Adam.</p> 
<p>2 The cherub obeyed the command of the Lord God, and went into the garden and brought two figs on two twigs, each fig hanging to its leaf; they were from two of the trees among which Adam and Eve hid themselves when God went to walk in the garden, and the Word of God came to Adam and Eve and said unto them, "Adam, Adam, where art thou?"</p> 
<p>3 And Adam answered, "O God, here am I. When I heard the sound of Thee and Thy voice, I hid myself, because I am naked."</p> 
<p>4 Then the cherub took two figs and brought them to Adam and Eve. But he threw them to them from afar; for they might not come near the cherub by reason of their flesh, that could not come near the fire.</p> 
<p>5 At first, angels trembled at the presence of Adam and were afraid of him. But now Adam trembled before the angels and was afraid of them.</p> 
<p>6 Then Adam drew near and took one fig, and Eve also came in turn and took the other.</p> 
<p>7 And as they took them up in their hands, they looked at them, and knew they were from the trees among which they had hidden them elves.</p>
