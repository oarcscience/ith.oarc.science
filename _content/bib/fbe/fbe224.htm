<p align="CENTER">An invitation to the thirsty</i>.</p> 
<p>1 Fill ye waters for yourselves from the living fountain of the Lord, for it is opened to you:<br> 2 And come all ye thirsty, and take the draught; and rest by the fountain of the Lord.<br> 3 For fair it is and pure and gives rest to the soul. Much more pleasant are its waters than honey;<br> 4 And the honeycomb of bees is not to be compared with it.<br> 5 For it flows forth from the lips of the Lord and from the heart of the Lord is its name.<br> 6 And it came infinitely and invisibly: and until it was set in the midst they did not know it:<br> 7 Blessed are they who have drunk therefrom and have found rest thereby. Hallelujah.</p>
