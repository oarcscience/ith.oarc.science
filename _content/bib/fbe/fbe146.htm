<p>Enoch's pitiful admonition to his sons with weeping and great lamentation, as he spoke to them</i>.</p> 
<p>Oh my children, my beloved ones, hear the admonition of your father, as much as is according to the Lord's will.</p> 
<p>2 I have been let come to you to-day, and announce to you, not from my lips, but from the Lord's lips, all that is and was and all that is now, and all that will be till judgement-day.</p> 
<p>3 For the Lord has let me come to you, you hear therefore the words of my lips, of a man made big for you, but I am one who has seen the Lord's face, like iron made to glow from fire it sends forth sparks and burns,</p> 
<p>4 You look now upon my eyes, <i>the eyes</i> of a man big with meaning for you, but I have seen the Lord's eyes, shining like the sun's rays and filling the eyes of man with awe.</p> 
<p>5 You see now, my children, the right hand of a man that helps you, but I have seen the Lord's right hand filling heaven as be helped me.</p> 
<p>6 You see the compass of my work like your own, but I have seen the Lord's limitless and perfect compass, which has no end.</p> 
<p>7 You hear the words of my lips, as I heard the words of the Lord, like great thunder incessantly with hurling of clouds.</p> 
<p>8 And now, my children, hear the discourses of the father of the earth, how fearful and awful it is to come before the face of the ruler of the earth, how much more terrible and awful it is to come before the face of the ruler of heaven, the controller of quick and dead, and of the heavenly troops. Who can endure that endless pain?</p>
