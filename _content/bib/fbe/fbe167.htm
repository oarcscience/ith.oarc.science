<p>He who does injury to soul of man, does injury to his own soul, and there is no cure for his flesh, nor pardon for all time. How it is not fitting to kill man neither by weapon nor by tongue</i>.</p> 
<p>HE who works the killing of a man's soul, kills his own soul, and kills his own body, and there is no cure for him for all time.</p> 
<p>2 He who puts a man in any snare, shall stick in it himself, and there is no cure for him for all time.</p> 
<p>3 He who puts a man in any vessel, his retribution will not be wanting at the great judgement for all time.</p>
