<p align="CENTER">With this psalm end the warlike Songs of Solomon</i>.</p> 
<p>Lord, Thy mercy is over the works of Thy hands for ever;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy goodness is over Israel with a rich gift.<br> Thine eyes look upon them, so that none of them suffers want;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thine ears listen to the hopeful prayer of the poor.<br> Thy judgements are executed upon the whole earth in mercy;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And Thy love is toward the seed of Abraham, the children of Israel.<br> Thy chastisement is upon us as upon a first-born, only-begotten son,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To turn back the obedient soul from folly that is wrought in ignorance.<br> May God cleanse Israel against the day of mercy and blessing,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Against the day of choice when<br> Blessed shall they be that shall be in those days,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He bringeth back His anointed. <a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></A><br> In that they shall see the goodness of the Lord which He shall perform for the generation that is to come,<br> Under the rod of chastening of the Lord's anointed in the fear of his God,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of wisdom and righteousness and strength;<br> That he may direct every man in the works of righteousness by the fear of God,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That he may establish them all before the Lord,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A good generation living in the fear of God in the days of mercy. Selah.</p> 
<p>Great is our God and glorious, dwelling in the highest.<br> It is He who hath established in their courses the lights of heaven for determining seasons from year to year,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And they have not turned aside from the way which He appointed them.<br> In the fear of God they pursue their path every day,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the day God created them and for evermore.<br> And they have erred not since the day He created them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the generations of old they have not withdrawn from their path,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Unless God commanded them so to do by the command of His servants.</p>
