<p>God summons from the very lowest a second time that Archas, heavy and very red should come forth</i>.</p> 
<p>AND I summoned the very lowest a second time, and said: 'Let Archas come forth hard,' and he came forth hard from the invisible.</p> 
<p>2 And Archas came forth, hard, heavy, and very red.</p> 
<p>3 And I said: 'Be opened, Archas, and let there be born from thee,' and he came undone, an age came forth, very great and very dark, bearing the creation of all lower things, and I saw that <i>it was</i> good and said to him:</p> 
<p>4 'Go thou down below, and make thyself firm, and be for a foundation for the lower things,' and it happened and he went down and fixed himself, and became the foundation for the lower things, and below the darkness there is nothing else.</p>
