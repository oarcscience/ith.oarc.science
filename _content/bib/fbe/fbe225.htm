<p>A song that Marcus Aurelius might have known when he said</i> "<i>Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break</i>."</p> 
<p>1 The abysses were dissolved before the Lord: and darkness was destroyed by His appearance:<br> 2 Error went astray and perished at His hand: and folly found no path to walk in, and was submerged by the truth of the Lord.<br> 3 He opened His mouth and spake grace and joy: and He spake a new song of praise to His name:<br> 4 And He lifted up His voice to the Most High, and offered to Him the sons that were with Him.<br> 5 And His face was justified, for thus His holy Father had given to Him.<br> 6 Come forth, ye that have been afflicted and receive joy, and possess your souls by His grace; and take to you immortal life.<br> 7 And they made me a debtor when I rose up, me who had been a debtor: and they divided my spoil, though nothing was due to them.<br> 8 But I endured and held my peace and was silent, as if not, moved by them.<br> 9 But I stood unshaken like a firm rock which is beaten by the waves and endures.<br> 10 And I bore their bitterness for humility's sake:<br> 11 In order, that I might redeem my people, and inherit it and that I might not make void my promises to the fathers, to whom I promised the salvation of their seed. Hallelujah.</p>
