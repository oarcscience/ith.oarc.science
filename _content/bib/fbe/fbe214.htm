<p>A mixture of ethics and mysticism; of the golden rule and the tree of life</i>.</p> 
<p>1 I am a priest of the Lord, and to Him I do priestly service: and to Him I offer the sacrifice of His thought.<br> 2 For His thought is not like the thought of the world nor the thought of the flesh, nor like them that serve carnally.<br> 3 The sacrifice of the Lord is righteousness, and purity of heart and lips.<br> 4 Present your reins before Him blamelessly: and let not thy heart do violence to heart, nor thy soul to soul.<br> 5 Thou shalt not acquire a stranger by the price of thy silver, neither shalt thou seek to devour thy neighbour,<br> 6 Neither shalt thou deprive him of the covering of his nakedness.<br> 7 But put on the grace of the Lord without stint; and come into His Paradise and make thee a garland from its tree,<br> 8 And put it on thy head and be glad; and recline on His rest, and glory shall go before thee,<br> 9 And thou shalt receive of His kindness and of His grace; and thou shalt be flourishing in truth in the praise of His holiness. Praise and honour be to His name. Hallelujah.</p>
