<p>A remarkable explanation of the "coats of skin" in the third chapter of Genesi</i>s.</p> 
<p>1 My arms I lifted up to the Most High, even to the <a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 131</font></A> grace of the Lord: because He had cast off my bonds from me: and my Helper had lifted me up to His grace and to His salvation:<br> 2 And I put off darkness and clothed myself with light,<br> 3 And my soul acquired a body free from sorrow or affliction or pains.<br> 4 And increasingly helpful to me was the thought of the Lord, and His fellowship in incorruption:<br> 5 And I was lifted up in His light; and I served before Him,<br> 6 And I became near to Him, praising and confessing Him;<br> 7 My heart ran over and was found in my mouth: and it arose upon my lips; and the exultation of the Lord increased on my face, and His praise likewise. Hallelujah.</p>
