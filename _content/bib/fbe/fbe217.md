### ODE 23.

The reference to the sealed document sent by God is one of the great
mysteries of the collection.

1 Joy is of the saints! and who shall put it on, but they alone?  
2 Grace is of the elect! and who shall receive it except those who trust
in it from the beginning?  
3 Love is of the elect? And who shall put it on except those who have
possessed it from the beginning?  
4 Walk ye in the knowledge of the Most High without grudging: to His
exultation and to the perfection of His knowledge.  
5 And His thought was like a letter; His will descended from on high,
and it was sent like an arrow which is violently shot from the bow:

6 And many hands rushed to the letter to seize it and to take and read
it:  
7 And it escaped their fingers and they were affrighted at it and at the
seal that was upon it.  
8 Because it was not permitted to them to loose its seal: for the power
that was over the seal was greater than they.  
9 But those who saw it went after the letter that they might know where
it would alight, and who should read it and who should hear it.  
10 But a wheel received it and came over it:  
11 And there was with it a sign of the Kingdom and of the Government:  
12 And everything which tried to move the wheel it mowed and cut down:  
13 And it gathered the multitude of adversaries, and bridged the rivers
and crossed over and rooted up many forests and made a broad path.  
14 The head went down to the feet, for down to the feet ran the wheel,
and that which was a sign upon it.  
15 The letter was one of command, for there were included in it all
districts;  
16 And there was seen at its head, the head which was revealed even the
Son of Truth from the Most High Father,  
17 And He inherited and took possession of everything. And the thought
of many was brought to nought.  
18 And all the apostates hasted and fled away. And those who persecuted
and were enraged became extinct.  
19 And the letter was a great volume, which was wholly written by the.
finger of God:  
20 And the name of the Father was on it, and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit, to rule for ever and ever. Hallelujah.
