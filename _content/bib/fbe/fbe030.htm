<p align="CENTER">God represented as merciful and loving. The establishing of worship</i>.</p> 
<p>BUT God knew that Adam had in his thoughts, that he should often kill himself and make an offering to Him of his blood.</p> 
<p>2 Therefore did He say unto him, "O Adam, do not again kill thyself as thou didst, by throwing thyself down from that mountain."</p> 
<p>3 But Adam said unto God, "It was in my mind to put an end to myself at once, for having transgressed Thy commandments, and for my having come out of the beautiful garden; and for the bright light of which Thou hast deprived me; and for the praises which poured forth from my mouth without ceasing, and for the light that covered me.</p> 
<p>4 "Yet of Thy goodness, O God, do not away with me altogether; but be favourable to me every time I die, and bring me to life.</p> 
<p>5 "And thereby it will be made known that Thou art a merciful God, who willest not that one should perish; who lovest not that one should fall; and who dost not condemn any one cruelly, badly, and by whole destruction."</p> 
<p>6 Then Adam remained silent.</p> 
<p>7 And the Word of God came unto him, and blessed him, and comforted him, and covenanted with him, that He would save him at the end of the days determined upon him.</p> 
<p>8 This, then, was the first offering Adam made unto God; and so it became his custom to do.</p>
