### CHAP. XIV.

Time, like an ever-rolling stream, bears away another generation of men.

WHEN Enos was nine hundred years old, all the children of Seth, and of
Cainan, and his first-born, with their wives and children, gathered
around him, asking for a blessing from him.

2 He then prayed over them and blessed them, and adjured them by the
blood of Abel the just saying to them, "Let not one of your children go
down from this Holy Mountain, and let them make no fellowship with the
children of Cain the murderer."

3 Then Enos called his son Cainan and said to him, "See, O my son, and
set thy heart on thy people, and establish them in righteousness, and in
innocence; and stand ministering before the body of our father Adam, all
the days of thy life."

4 After this Enos entered into rest, aged nine hundred and eighty-five
years; and Cainan wound him up, and laid him in the Cave of Treasures on
the left of his father Adam; and made offerings for him, after the
custom of his fathers.
