<p>Theologians have never agreed on an explanation of this perplexing Ode</i>.</p> 
<p>1 I rested in the Spirit of the Lord: and the Spirit raised me on high:<br> 2 And made me stand on my feet in the height of the Lord, before His perfection and His glory, while I was praising Him by the composition of His songs.<br> 3 The Spirit brought me forth before the face of the Lord: and, although a son of man, I was named the Illuminate, the Son of God:<br> 4 While I praised amongst the praising ones, and great was I amongst the mighty ones.<br> 5 For according to the greatness of the Most High, so He made me: and like His own newness He renewed me; and He anointed me from His own perfection:<br> 6 And I became one of His Neighbours; and my mouth was opened, like a cloud of dew,<br> 7 And my heart poured out as it were a gushing stream of righteousness,<br> 8 And my access to Him was in peace; and I was established by the Spirit of His government. Hallelujah.</p>
