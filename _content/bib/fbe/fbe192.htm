<p align="CENTER">The psalmist again expresses profound truth</i>--"<i>For if Thou givest not strength, who can endure chastisement</i>?"</p> 
<p>When my soul slumbered being afar from the Lord, I had all but slipped down to the pit,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When I was far from God, my soul had been well-nigh poured out unto death,<br> I had been nigh unto the gates of Sheol with the sinner,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When my soul departed from the Lord God of Israel--<br> Had not the Lord helped me with His everlasting mercy.</p> 
<p>He pricked me, as a horse is pricked, that I might serve Him,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;My saviour and helper at all times saved me.<br> I will give thanks unto Thee, O God, for Thou hast helped me to my salvation;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And hast not counted me with sinners to my destruction.<br> Remove not Thy mercy from me, O God,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor Thy memorial from my heart until I die.<br> Rule me, O God, keeping me back from wicked sin,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And from every wicked woman that causeth the simple to stumble.<br> And let not the beauty of a lawless woman beguile me,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any one that is subject to unprofitable sin.</p> 
<p>Establish the works of my hands before Thee,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And preserve my goings in the remembrance of Thee.<br> Protect my tongue and my lips with words of truth;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Anger and unreasoning wrath put far from me.<br> Murmuring, and impatience in affliction, remove far from me<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When, if I sin, Thou chastenest me that I may return unto Thee.<br> But with goodwill and cheerfulness support my soul;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When Thou strengthenest my soul, what is given to me will be sufficient for me.<br> For if <i>Thou</i> givest not strength,<br> Who can endure chastisement with poverty? <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></A><br> When a man is rebuked by means of his corruption,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy testing of him is in his flesh and in the affliction of poverty.<br> If the righteous endureth in all these trials, he shall receive mercy from the Lord.</p>
