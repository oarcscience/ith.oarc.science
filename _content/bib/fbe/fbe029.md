### CHAP. XXIV.

A vivid prophecy of the life and death of Christ.

TEN the merciful God, good 'and lover of men, looked upon Adam and Eve,
and upon their blood, which they had held up as an offering unto Him;
without an order from Him for so doing. But He wondered at them; and
accepted their offerings.

2 And God sent from His presence a bright fire, that consumed their
offering.

3 He smelt the sweet savour of their offering, and showed them mercy.

4 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him, "O Adam, as thou
hast shed thy blood, so will I shed My own blood when I become flesh of
thy seed; and as thou didst die, O Adam, so also will I die. And as thou
didst build an altar, so also will I make for thee an altar on the
earth; and as thou didst offer thy blood upon it, so also will I offer
My blood upon an altar on the earth.

5 "And as thou didst sue for forgiveness through that blood, so also
will I make My blood forgiveness of sins, and blot out transgressions in
it.

6 "And now, behold, I have accepted thy offering, O Adam, but the days
of the covenant, wherein I have bound thee, are not fulfilled. When they
are fulfilled, then will I bring thee back into the garden.

7 "Now, therefore, strengthen thy heart; and when sorrow comes upon
thee, make Me an offering, and I will be favourable to thee."
