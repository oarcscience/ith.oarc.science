*The Forgotten Books of Eden*, by Rutherford H. Platt, Jr., \[1926\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XXXV.

God leaves one righteous man of Enoch's tribe with his whole house, who
did God's pleasure according to his will.

BEHOLD from their seed shall arise another generation, much afterwards,
but of them many will be very insatiate.

2 He who raises that generation, *shall* reveal to them the books of thy
handwriting, of thy fathers, *to them* to whom he must point out the
guardianship of the world, to the faithful men and workers of my
pleasure, who do not acknowledge my name in vain.

3 And they shall tell another generation, and those *others* having read
shall be glorified thereafter, more than the first.
