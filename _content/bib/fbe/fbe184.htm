<p align="CENTER">Some remarkable similes of war creeping on Jerusalem. A survey of the sins that brought all this trouble</i>.</p> 
<p>Distress and the sound of war hath my ear heard,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a trumpet announcing slaughter and calamity,<br> The sound of much people as of an exceeding high wind,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As a tempest with mighty fire sweeping through the Negeb.<br> And I said in my heart, Surely God judgeth us;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A sound I hear moving towards Jerusalem, the holy city<br> My loins were broken at what I heard, my knees tottered;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;My heart was afraid, my bones were dismayed like flax.<br> I said: They establish their ways in righteousness.</p> 
<p>I thought upon the judgments of God since the creation of heaven and earth;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I held God righteous in His judgements which have been from of old.<br> God bare their sins in the full light of day;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;All the earth came to know the righteous judgements of God.<br> In secret places underground their iniquities were committed to provoke Him to anger;<br> They wrought confusion, son with mother and father with daughter;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They committed adultery, every man with his neighhour's wife.<br> They concluded covenants with one another with an oath touching these things;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They plundered the sanctuary of God, as though there was no avenger.<br> They trode the altar of the Lord, coming straight from all manner of uncleanness;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And with menstrual blood they defiled the sacrifices, as though these were common flesh.<br> They left no sin undone, wherein they surpassed not the heathen.</p> 
<p>Therefore God mingled for them a spirit of wandering;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And gave them to drink a cup of undiluted wine, that they might become drunken.<br> He brought him that is from the end of the earth, that smiteth mightily;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He decreed war against Jerusalem, and against her land.<br> The princes of the land went to meet him with joy: they said unto him:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed be thy way! Come ye, enter ye in with peace.<br> They made the rough ways even, before his entering in;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They opened the gates to Jerusalem, they crowned its walls.</p> 
<p>As a father entereth the house of his sons, so he entered Jerusalem in peace;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He established his feet there in great safety.<br> He captured her fortresses and the wall of Jerusalem;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For God Himself led him in safety, while they wandered.<br> He destroyed their princes and every one wise in counsel;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He poured out the blood of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, like the water of uncleanness. <a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></A><br> He led away their sons and daughters, whom they had begotten in defilement.</p> 
<p>They did according to their uncleanness, even as their fathers had done:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They defiled Jerusalem and the things that had been hallowed to the name of God.<br> But God hath shown Himself righteous in His judgements upon the nations of the earth;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the pious servants of God are like innocent lambs in their midst.<br> Worthy to be praised is the Lord that judgeth the whole earth in His righteousness.</p> 
<p>Behold, now, O God, Thou hast shown us Thy judgement in Thy righteousness;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Our eyes have seen Thy judgements, O God.<br> We have justified Thy name that is honoured for ever;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For Thou are the God of righteousness, judging Israel with chastening.</p> 
<p>Turn, O God, Thy mercy upon us, and have pity upon us;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Gather together the dispersed of Israel, with mercy and goodness;<br> For Thy faithfulness is with us,<br> And though we have stiffened our neck, yet Thou art our chastener;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Overlook us not, O our God, lest the nations swallow us up, as though there were none to deliver.</p> 
<p>But Thou art our God from the beginning,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And upon Thee is our hope set, O Lord;<br> And we will not depart from Thee,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For good are Thy judgements upon us.<br> Ours and our children's be Thy good pleasure for ever;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;O Lord, our Saviour, we shall never more be moved.<br> The Lord is worthy to be praised for His judgements with the mouth of His pious ones;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And blessed be Israel of the Lord for ever.</p>
