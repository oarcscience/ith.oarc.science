### XVIII.

Of the taking of Enoch on to the fifth heaven.

THE men took me on to the fifth heaven and placed me, and there I saw
many and countless soldiers, called Grigori, of human appearance, and
their size was greater than that of great giants and their faces
withered, and the silence of their mouths perpetual, and there was no
service on the fifth heaven, and I said to the men who were with me:

2 Wherefore are these very withered and their faces melancholy, and
their mouths silent, and *wherefore* is there no service on this heaven?

3 And they said to me: These are the Grigori, who with their prince
Satanail rejected the Lord of light, and after them are those who are
held in great darkness on the second heaven, and three of them went down
on to earth from the Lord's throne, to the place Ermon, and broke
through their vows on the shoulder of the hill Ermon <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2) and saw the daughters of men how good they
are, and took to themselves wives, and befouled the earth with their
deeds, who in all times of their age made lawlessness and mixing, and
giants are born and marvellous big men and great enmity.

4 And therefore God judged them with great judgement, and they weep for
their brethren and they will be punished on the Lord's great day.

5 And I said to the Grigori: 'I saw your brethren and their works, and
their great torments, and I prayed for them, but the Lord has condemned
them *to be* under earth till heaven and earth shall end for ever.'

6 And I said: 'Wherefore do you wait, brethren, and do not serve before
the Lord's face, and have not put your services before the Lord's face,
lest you anger your Lord utterly?'

7 And they listened to my admonition, and spoke to the four ranks in
heaven, and lo! as I stood with those two men four trumpets trumpeted
together with great voice, and the Grigori broke into song with one
voice, and their voice went up before the Lord pitifully and
affectingly.
