<p>Enoch instructs his sons and all the elders of the people, how they are to walk with terror and trembling before the Lord, and serve him alone and not bow down to idols, but to God, who created heaven and earth and. every creature, and to his image</i>.</p> 
<p>AND now, my children, keep your souls from all injustice, such as the Lord hates.</p> 
<p>2 Walk before his face with terror and trembling and serve him alone.</p> 
<p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></A></p> 
<p>3 Bow down to the true God, not to dumb idols, but bow down to his picture, and bring all just offerings before the Lord's face. The Lord hates what is unjust.</p> 
<p>4 For the Lord sees all things; when man takes thought in his heart, then he counsels the intellects, and every thought is always before the Lord, who made firm the earth and put all creatures on it.</p> 
<p>5 If you look to heaven, the Lord is there; if you take thought of the sea's deep and all the under-earth, the Lord is there.</p> 
<p>6 For the Lord created all things. Bow not down to things made by man, leaving the Lord of all creation, because no work can remain hidden before the Lord's face.</p> 
<p>7 Walk, my children, in longsuffering, in meekness, honesty, in provocation, in grief, in faith and in truth, in <i>reliance on</i> promises, in illness, in abuse, in wounds, in temptation, in nakedness, in privation, loving one another, till you go out from this age of ills, that you become inheritors of endless time.</p> 
<p>8 Blessed are the just who shall escape the great judgement, for they shall shine forth more than the sun sevenfold, for in this world the seventh part is taken off from all, light, darkness, food, enjoyment, sorrow, paradise, torture, fire, frost, and other things; he put all down in writing, that you might read and understand.'</p>
