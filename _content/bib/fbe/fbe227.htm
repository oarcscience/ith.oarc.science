<p align="CENTER">A virgin stands and proclaims (v. 5)</i>.</p> 
<p>1 Again Grace ran and forsook corruption, and came down in Him to bring it to nought;<br> 2 And He destroyed perdition from before Him, and devastated all its order;<br> 3 And He stood on a lofty summit and uttered His voice from one end of the earth to the other:<br> 4 And drew to Him all those who obeyed Him; and there did not appear as it were an evil person.<br> 5 But there stood a perfect virgin who was proclaiming and calling and saying,<br> 6 O ye sons of men, return ye, and ye daughters of men, come ye:<br> 7 And forsake the ways of that corruption and draw near unto me, and I will enter into you, and will bring you forth from perdition,<br> 8 And make you wise in the ways of truth: that you be not destroyed nor perish:<br> 9 Hear ye me and be redeemed. For the grace of God I am telling among you: and by my means you shall be redeemed and become blessed.<br> 10 I am your judge; and they who have put me on shall not be injured: but they shall possess the new world that is incorrupt:<br> 11 My chosen ones walk in me, and my ways I will make known to them that seek me, and I will make them trust in my name. Hallelujah.</p>
