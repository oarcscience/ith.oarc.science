### ODE 24.

The mention of the Dove refers to a lost Gospel to which there are rare
references in ancient writings.

1 The Dove fluttered over the Messiah, because He was her head; and she
sang over Him and her voice was heard:  
2 And the inhabitants were afraid and the sojourners were moved:  
3 The birds dropped their wings and all creeping things died in their
holes: and the abysses were opened which had been hidden; and they cried
to the Lord like women in travail:  
4 And no food was given to them, because it did not belong to them;  
5 And they sealed up the abysses with the seal of the Lord. And they
perished, in the thought, those that had existed from ancient times;  
6 For they were corrupt from the beginning; and the end of their
corruption was life:  
7 And every one of them that was imperfect perished: for it was not
possible to give them a word that they might remain:  
8 And the Lord destroyed the imaginations of all them that had not the
truth with them.  
9 For they who in their hearts were lifted up were deficient in wisdom,
and so they were rejected, because the truth was not with them. <span

10 For the Lord disclosed His way, and spread abroad His grace: and
those who understood it, know His holiness. Hallelujah.
