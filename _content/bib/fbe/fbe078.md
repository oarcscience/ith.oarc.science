### CHAP. LXXIII.

The betrothal of Adam and Eve.

THEN God looked upon the words of Adam that they were true, and that he
could long await His order, respecting the counsel of Satan.

2 And God approved Adam in what he had thought concerning this, and in
the prayer he had offered in His presence; and the Word of God came unto
Adam and said to him, "O Adam, if only thou hadst had this caution at
first, ere thou earnest out of the garden into this land!"

3 After that, God sent His angel who had brought gold, and the angel who
had brought incense, and the angel who had brought myrrh to Adam, that
they should inform him respecting his wedding Eve.

4 Then those angels said to

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Adam, "Take the
gold and give it to Eve as a wedding gift, and betroth her; then give
her some incense and myrrh as a present; and be ye, thou and she, one
flesh."

5 Adam hearkened to the angels, and took the gold and put it into Eve's
bosom in her garment; and bethrothed her with his hand.

6 Then the angels commanded Adam and Eve, to arise and pray forty days
and forty nights; and after that, that Adam should come in to his wife;
for then this would be an act pure and undefiled; and he should have
children who would multiply, and replenish the face of the earth.

7 Then both Adam and Eve received the words of the angels; and the
angels departed from them.

8 Then Adam and Eve began to fast and to pray, until the end of the
forty days; and then they came together, as the angels had told them.
And from the time Adam left the garden until he wedded Eve, were two
hundred and twenty-three days, that is seven months and thirteen days.

9 Thus was Satan's war with Adam defeated.
