<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, [a] called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and  Sosthenes the brother,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to [those]  sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in  every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both  theirs and ours:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord  Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of  God given to you in Christ Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word  [of doctrine], and all knowledge,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;(according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed  in you,)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of  our Lord Jesus Christ;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;who shall also confirm you to [the] end, unimpeachable in  the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;God [is] faithful, by whom ye have been called into [the]  fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus  Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not  among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the  same mind and in the same opinion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, by  those of [the house of] Chloe, that there are strifes among  you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;But I speak of this, that each of you says, *I* am of Paul,  and *I* of Apollos, and *I* of Cephas, and *I* of Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Is the Christ divided? has Paul been crucified for you? or  have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;I thank God that I have baptised none of you, unless  Crispus and Gaius,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas; for the rest I  know not if I have baptised any other.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad  tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the Christ  may not be made vain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;For the word of the cross is to them that perish  foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,  and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Where [is the] wise? where scribe? where disputer of this  world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has  not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the  preaching to save those that believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;but *we* preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offence, and  to nations foolishness;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;but to those that [are] called, both Jews and Greeks,  Christ God's power and God's wisdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the  weakness of God is stronger than men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;For consider your calling, brethren, that [there are] not  many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many  high-born.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he  may put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things  of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;and the ignoble things of the world, and the despised, has  God chosen, [and] things that are not, that he may annul the  things that are;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;so that no flesh should boast before God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;But of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus, who has been made to  us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and  redemption;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him  boast in [the] Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And *I*, when I came to you, brethren, came not in  excellency of word, or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony  of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;For I did not judge [it well] to know anything among you  save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And *I* was with you in weakness and in fear and in much  trembling;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;and my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of  wisdom, but in demonstration of [the] Spirit and of power;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;that your faith might not stand in men's wisdom, but in  God's power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;But we speak wisdom among the perfect; but wisdom not of  this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to  nought.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;But we speak God's wisdom in [a] mystery, that hidden  [wisdom] which God had predetermined before the ages for our  glory:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;which none of the princes of this age knew, (for had they  known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;but according as it is written, Things which eye has not  seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's  heart, which God has prepared for them that love him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;but God has revealed to us by [his] Spirit; for the Spirit  searches all things, even the depths of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;For who of men hath known the things of a man except the  spirit of the man which is in him? thus also the things of God  knows no one except the Spirit of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;But *we* have received, not the spirit of the world, but  the Spirit which [is] of God, that we may know the things which  have been freely given to us of God:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom,  but in those taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual  [things] by spiritual [means].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;But [the] natural man does not receive the things of the  Spirit of God, for they are folly to him; and he cannot know  [them] because they are spiritually discerned;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;but the spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is  discerned of no one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;For who has known the mind of [the] Lord, who shall  instruct him? But *we* have the mind of Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And *I*, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to  spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not  yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;for ye are yet carnal. For whereas [there are] among you  emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to  man?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;For when one says, *I* am of Paul, and another, *I* of  Apollos, are ye not men?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering servants,  through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to  each.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;*I* have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the  increase.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer;  but God the giver of the increase.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall  receive his own reward according to his own labour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;For we are God's fellow-workmen; ye are God's husbandry,  God's building.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;According to the grace of God which has been given to me,  as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another  builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;For other foundation can no man lay besides that which [is]  laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;Now if any one build upon [this] foundation, gold, silver,  precious stones, wood, grass, straw,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall  declare [it], because it is revealed in fire; and the fire  shall try the work of each what it is.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;If the work of any one which he has built upon [the  foundation] shall abide, he shall receive a reward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer  loss, but *he* shall be saved, but so as through [the] fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and [that]  the Spirit of God dwells in you?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God  destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are *ye*.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;Let no one deceive himself: if any one thinks himself to be  wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he  may be wise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for  it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;And again, [The] Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that  they are vain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;So that let no one boast in men; for all things are yours.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or  life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are  yours;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;and *ye* [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and  stewards of [the] mysteries of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found  faithful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined  of you or of man's day. Nor do I even examine myself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not  justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;So that do not judge anything before [the] time, until the  Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden  things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of  hearts; and then shall each have [his] praise from God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Now these things, brethren, I have transferred, in their  application, to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may  learn in us the [lesson of] not [letting your thoughts go]  above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for  [such a] one against another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;For who makes thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou  hast not received? but if also thou hast received, why boastest  thou as not receiving?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Already ye are filled; already ye have been enriched; ye  have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that *we*  also might reign with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last,  as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the  world, both to angels and men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;*We* [are] fools for Christ's sake, but *ye* prudent in  Christ: *we* weak, but *ye* strong: *ye* glorious, but *we* in  dishonour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are in  nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;and labour, working with our own hands. Railed at, we  bless; persecuted, we suffer [it];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;insulted, we entreat: we are become as [the] offscouring of  the world, [the] refuse of all, until now.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Not [as] chiding do I write these things to you, but as my  beloved children I admonish [you].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ,  yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you  through the glad tidings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;I entreat you therefore, be my imitators.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my  beloved and faithful child in [the] Lord, who shall put you in  mind of my ways [as] they [are] in Christ, according as I teach  everywhere in every assembly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;But some have been puffed up, as if I were not coming to  you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;but I will come quickly to you, if the Lord will; and I  will know, not the word of those that are puffed up, but the  power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love,  and [in] a spirit of meekness?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;It is universally reported [that there is] fornication among  you, and such fornication as [is] not even among the nations,  so that one should have his father's wife.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;And *ye* are puffed up, and ye have not rather mourned, in  order that he that has done this deed might be taken away out  of the midst of you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;For *I*, [as] absent in body but present in spirit, have  already judged as present,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;[to deliver,] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye and  my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord  Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;to deliver him, [I say,] [being] such, to Satan for  destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the  day of the Lord Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;Your boasting [is] not good. Do ye not know that a little  leaven leavens the whole lump?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,  according as ye are unleavened. For also our passover, Christ,  has been sacrificed;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor  with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened  [bread] of sincerity and truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;I have written to you in the epistle not to mix with  fornicators;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with  the avaricious and rapacious, or idolaters, since [then] ye  should go out of the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;But now I have written to you, if any one called brother be  fornicator, or avaricious, or idolater, or abusive, or a  drunkard, or rapacious, not to mix with [him]; with such a one  not even to eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;For what have *I* [to do] with judging those outside also?  *ye*, do not ye judge them that are within?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;But those without God judges. Remove the wicked person from  amongst yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Dare any one of you, having a matter against another,  prosecute his suit before the unjust, and not before the  saints?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Do ye not then know that the saints shall judge the world?  and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy of [the]  smallest judgments?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;Do ye not know that we shall judge angels? and not then  matters of this life?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;If then ye have judgments as to things of this life, set  those [to judge] who are little esteemed in the assembly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;I speak to you [to put you] to shame. Thus there is not a  wise person among you, not even one, who shall be able to  decide between his brethren!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;But brother prosecutes his suit with brother, and that  before unbelievers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Already indeed then it is altogether a fault in you that ye  have suits between yourselves. Why do ye not rather suffer  wrong? why are ye not rather defrauded?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;But *ye* do wrong, and defraud, and this [your] brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;Do ye not know that unrighteous [persons] shall not inherit  [the] kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor  idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who make women of  themselves, nor who abuse themselves with men,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor abusive  persons, nor [the] rapacious, shall inherit [the] kingdom of  God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And these things were some of you; but ye have been washed,  but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the  name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;All things are lawful to me, but all things do not profit;  all things are lawful to me, but *I* will not be brought under  the power of any.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God will  bring to nothing both it and them: but the body [is] not for  fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;And God has both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up  from among [the dead] by his power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ?  Shall I then, taking the members of the Christ, make [them]  members of a harlot? Far be the thought.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;Do ye not know that he [that is] joined to the harlot is  one body? for the two, he says, shall be one flesh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;But he that [is] joined to the Lord is one Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may practise is  without the body, but he that commits fornication sins against  his own body.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;Do ye not know that your body is [the] temple of the Holy  Spirit which [is] in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not  your own?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God  in your body.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;But concerning the things of which ye have written [to me]:  [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;but on account of fornications, let each have his own wife,  and each [woman] have her own husband.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Let the husband render her due to the wife, and in like  manner the wife to the husband.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;The wife has not authority over her own body, but the  husband: in like manner also the husband has not authority over  his own body, but the wife.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Defraud not one another, unless, it may be, by consent for a  time, that ye may devote yourselves to prayer, and again be  together, that Satan tempt you not because of your  incontinency.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;But this I say, as consenting [to], not as commanding [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;Now I wish all men to be even as myself: but every one has  his own gift of God: one man thus, and another thus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for  them that they remain even as I.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;But if they have not control over themselves, let them  marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;But to the married I enjoin, not *I*, but the Lord, Let not  wife be separated from husband;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;(but if also she shall have been separated, let her remain  unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband;) and let not  husband leave wife.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;But as to the rest, *I* say, not the Lord, If any brother  have an unbelieving wife, and *she* consent to dwell with him,  let him not leave her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents  to dwell with her, let her not leave [her] husband.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and  the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother; since  [otherwise] indeed your children are unclean, but now they are  holy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;But if the unbeliever go away, let them go away; a brother  or a sister is not bound in such [cases], but God has called us  in peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;For what knowest thou, O wife, if thou shalt save thy  husband? or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt save  thy wife?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;However, as the Lord has divided to each, as God has called  each, so let him walk; and thus I ordain in all the assemblies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;Has any one been called circumcised? let him not become  uncircumcised: has any one been called in uncircumcision? let  him not be circumcised.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but  keeping God's commandments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;Let each abide in that calling in which he has been called.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;Hast thou been called [being] a bondman, let it not concern  thee; but and if thou canst become free, use [it] rather.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;For the bondman that is called in [the] Lord is the Lord's  freedman; in like manner [also] the freeman being called is  Christ's bondman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;Ye have been bought with a price; do not be the bondmen of  men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;Let each, wherein he is called, brethren, therein abide  with God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;But concerning virgins, I have no commandment of [the]  Lord; but I give my opinion, as having received mercy of [the]  Lord to be faithful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;I think then that this is good, on account of the present  necessity, that [it is] good for a man to remain so as he is.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed; art thou  free from a wife? do not seek a wife.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;But if thou shouldest also marry, thou hast not sinned; and  if the virgin marry, they have not sinned: but such shall have  tribulation in the flesh; but I spare you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:29">7:29</A>&nbsp;But this I say, brethren, the time is straitened. For the  rest, that they who have wives, be as not having [any]:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:30">7:30</A>&nbsp;and they that weep, as not weeping; and they that rejoice,  as not rejoicing; and they that buy, as not possessing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:31">7:31</A>&nbsp;and they that use the world, as not disposing of it as  their own; for the fashion of this world passes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:32">7:32</A>&nbsp;But I wish you to be without care. The unmarried cares for  the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:33">7:33</A>&nbsp;but he that has married cares for the things of the world,  how he shall please his wife.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:34">7:34</A>&nbsp;There is a difference between the wife and the virgin. The  unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be  holy both in body and spirit; but she that has married cares  for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:35">7:35</A>&nbsp;But I say this for your own profit; not that I may set a  snare before you, but for what [is] seemly, and waiting on the  Lord without distraction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:36">7:36</A>&nbsp;But if any one think that he behaves unseemly to his  virginity, if he be beyond the flower of his age, and so it  must be, let him do what he will, he does not sin: let them  marry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:37">7:37</A>&nbsp;But he who stands firm in his heart, having no need, but  has authority over his own will, and has judged this in his  heart to keep his own virginity, he does well.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:38">7:38</A>&nbsp;So that he that marries himself does well; and he that does  not marry does better.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:39">7:39</A>&nbsp;A wife is bound for whatever time her husband lives; but if  the husband be fallen asleep, she is free to be married to whom  she will, only in [the] Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:40">7:40</A>&nbsp;But she is happier if she so remain, according to my  judgment; but I think that *I* also have God's Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;But concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know, (for we  all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;If any one think he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as  he ought to know [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;But if any one love God, *he* is known of him):</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;-- concerning then the eating of things sacrificed to idols,  we know that an idol [is] nothing in [the] world, and that  there [is] no other God save one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;For and if indeed there are [those] called gods, whether in  heaven or on earth, (as there are gods many, and lords many,)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;yet to us [there is] one God, the Father, of whom all  things, and *we* for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom  [are] all things, and *we* by him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;But knowledge [is] not in all: but some, with conscience of  the idol, until now eat as of a thing sacrificed to idols; and  their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;But meat does not commend us to God; neither if we should  not eat do we come short; nor if we should eat have we an  advantage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;But see lest anywise this your right [to eat] itself be a  stumbling-block to the weak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;For if any one see thee, who hast knowledge, sitting at  table in an idol-house, shall not his conscience, he being  weak, be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to the idol?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;and the weak [one], the brother for whose sake Christ died,  will perish through thy knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;Now, thus sinning against the brethren, and wounding their  weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;Wherefore if meat be a fall-trap to my brother, I will eat  no flesh for ever, that I may not be a fall-trap to my brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus  our Lord? are not *ye* my work in [the] Lord?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;If I am not an apostle to others, yet at any rate I am to  you: for the seal of mine apostleship are *ye* in [the] Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;My defence to those who examine me is this:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;Have we not a right to eat and to drink?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;have we not a right to take round a sister [as] wife, as  also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and  Cephas?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;Or *I* alone and Barnabas, have we not a right not to work?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Who ever carries on war at his own charges? who plants a  vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? or who herds a flock  and does not eat of the milk of the flock?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;Do I speak these things as a man, or does not the law also  say these things?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;For in the law of Moses it is written, Thou shalt not muzzle  the ox that is treading out corn. Is God occupied about the  oxen,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;or does he say [it] altogether for our sakes? For for our  sakes it has been written, that the plougher should plough in  hope, and he that treads out corn, in hope of partaking of  [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;If we have sown to you spiritual things, [is it a] great  [thing] if *we* shall reap your carnal things?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;If others partake of this right over you, should not rather  *we*? But we have not used this right, but we bear all things,  that we may put no hindrance in the way of the glad tidings of  the Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;Do ye not know that they who labour [at] sacred things eat  of the [offerings offered in the] temple; they that attend at  the altar partake with the altar?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;So also the Lord has ordained to those that announce the  glad tidings to live of the glad tidings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;But *I* have used none of these things. Now I have not  written these things that it should be thus in my case; for [it  were] good for me rather to die than that any one should make  vain my boast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;For if I announce the glad tidings, I have nothing to boast  of; for a necessity is laid upon me; for it is woe to me if I  should not announce the glad tidings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if not  of my own will, I am entrusted with an administration.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;What is the reward then that I have? That in announcing the  glad tidings I make the glad tidings costless [to others], so  as not to have made use, as belonging to me, of my right in  [announcing] the glad tidings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;For being free from all, I have made myself bondman to all,  that I might gain the most [possible].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;And I became to the Jews as a Jew, in order that I might  gain the Jews: to those under law, as under law, not being  myself under law, in order that I might gain those under law:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;to those without law, as without law, (not as without law  to God, but as legitimately subject to Christ,) in order that I  might gain [those] without law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;I became to the weak, [as] weak, in order that I might gain  the weak. To all I have become all things, in order that at all  events I might save some.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;And I do all things for the sake of the glad tidings, that  I may be fellow-partaker with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;Know ye not that they who run in [the] race-course run all,  but one receives the prize? Thus run in order that ye may  obtain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;But every one that contends [for a prize] is temperate in  all things: *they* then indeed that they may receive a  corruptible crown, but *we* an incorruptible.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;*I* therefore thus run, as not uncertainly; so I combat, as  not beating the air.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;But I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest [after]  having preached to others I should be myself rejected.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that all our  fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;and all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the  sea;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;and all ate the same spiritual food,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank of a  spiritual rock which followed [them]: (now the rock was the  Christ;)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;yet God was not pleased with the most of them, for they  were strewed in the desert.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;But these things happened [as] types of us, that we should  not be lusters after evil things, as they also lusted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as it is written,  The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them  committed fornication, and fell in one day three and twenty  thousand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;Neither let us tempt the Christ, as some of them tempted,  and perished by serpents.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished  by the destroyer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;Now all these things happened to them [as] types, and have  been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages  are come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;So that let him that thinks that he stands take heed lest  he fall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;No temptation has taken you but such as is according to  man's nature; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to  be tempted above what ye are able [to bear], but will with the  temptation make the issue also, so that [ye] should be able to  bear [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;I speak as to intelligent [persons]: do *ye* judge what I  say.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not [the]  communion of the blood of the Christ? The bread which we break,  is it not [the] communion of the body of the Christ?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;Because we, [being] many, are one loaf, one body; for we  all partake of that one loaf.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;See Israel according to flesh: are not they who eat the  sacrifices in communion with the altar?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;What then do I say? that what is sacrificed to an idol is  anything, or that an idol is anything?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;But that what [the nations] sacrifice they sacrifice to  demons, and not to God. Now I do not wish you to be in  communion with demons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;Ye cannot drink [the] Lord's cup, and [the] cup of demons:  ye cannot partake of [the] Lord's table, and of [the] table of  demons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than  he?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;All things are lawful, but all are not profitable; all  things are lawful, but all do not edify.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;Let no one seek his own [advantage], but that of the  other.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;Everything sold in the shambles eat, making no inquiry for  conscience sake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:26">10:26</A>&nbsp;For the earth [is] the Lord's and its fulness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:27">10:27</A>&nbsp;But if any one of the unbelievers invite you, and ye are  minded to go, all that is set before you eat, making no inquiry  for conscience sake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:28">10:28</A>&nbsp;But if any one say to you, This is offered to holy  purposes, do not eat, for his sake that pointed it out, and  conscience sake;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:29">10:29</A>&nbsp;but conscience, I mean, not thine own, but that of the  other: for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:30">10:30</A>&nbsp;If *I* partake with thanksgiving, why am I spoken evil of  for what *I* give thanks for?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:31">10:31</A>&nbsp;Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatever ye do, do  all things to God's glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:32">10:32</A>&nbsp;Give no occasion to stumbling, whether to Jews, or Greeks,  or the assembly of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:33">10:33</A>&nbsp;Even as *I* also please all in all things; not seeking my  own profit, but that of the many, that they may be saved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;Be my imitators, even as *I* also [am] of Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;Now I praise you, that in all things ye are mindful of me;  and that as I have directed you, ye keep the directions.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every  man, but woman's head [is] the man, and the Christ's head God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;Every man praying or prophesying, having [anything] on his  head, puts his head to shame.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;But every woman praying or prophesying with her head  uncovered puts her own head to shame; for it is one and the  same as a shaved [woman].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;For if a woman be not covered, let her hair also be cut  off. But if [it be] shameful to a woman to have her hair cut  off or to be shaved, let her be covered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;For man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being  God's image and glory; but woman is man's glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;For man is not of woman, but woman of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but  woman for the sake of the man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head,  on account of the angels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;However, neither [is] woman without man, nor man without  woman, in [the] Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;For as the woman [is] of the man, so also [is] the man by  the woman, but all things of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman should pray  to God uncovered?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;Does not even nature itself teach you, that man, if he  have long hair, it is a dishonour to him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;But woman, if she have long hair, [it is] glory to her;  for the long hair is given [to her] in lieu of a veil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;But if any one think to be contentious, *we* have no such  custom, nor the assemblies of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;But [in] prescribing [to you on] this [which I now enter  on], I do not praise, [namely,] that ye come together, not for  the better, but for the worse.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;For first, when ye come together in assembly, I hear there  exist divisions among you, and I partly give credit [to it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;For there must also be sects among you, that the approved  may become manifest among you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not  to eat [the] Lord's supper.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;For each one in eating takes his *own* supper before  [others], and one is hungry and another drinks to excess.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye  despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them who have  not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this  [point] I do not praise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also  delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he  was delivered up, took bread,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;and having given thanks broke [it], and said, This is my  body, which [is] for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying,  This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as  ye shall drink [it], in remembrance of me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:26">11:26</A>&nbsp;For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the  cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:27">11:27</A>&nbsp;So that whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup of  the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of the body  and of the blood of the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:28">11:28</A>&nbsp;But let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread,  and drink of the cup.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:29">11:29</A>&nbsp;For [the] eater and drinker eats and drinks judgment to  himself, not distinguishing the body.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:30">11:30</A>&nbsp;On this account many among you [are] weak and infirm, and  a good many are fallen asleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:31">11:31</A>&nbsp;But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:32">11:32</A>&nbsp;But being judged, we are disciplined of [the] Lord, that  we may not be condemned with the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:33">11:33</A>&nbsp;So that, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait  for one another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:34">11:34</A>&nbsp;If any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not  come together for judgment. But the other things, whenever I  come, I will set in order.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;But concerning spiritual [manifestations], brethren, I do  not wish you to be ignorant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;Ye know that when ye were [of the] nations [ye were] led  away to dumb idols, in whatever way ye might be led.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in [the  power of the] Spirit of God, says, Curse [on] Jesus; and no one  can say, Lord Jesus, unless in [the power of the] Holy Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God  who operates all things in all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for  profit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;For to one, by the Spirit, is given [the] word of wisdom;  and to another [the] word of knowledge, according to the same  Spirit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;and to a different one faith, in [the power of] the same  Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in [the power of] the  same Spirit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;and to another operations of miracles; and to another  prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to a  different one kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation  of tongues.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit,  dividing to each in particular according as he pleases.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;For even as the body is one and has many members, but all  the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also [is]  the Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;For also in [the power of] one Spirit *we* have all been  baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen  or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;For also the body is not one member but many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;If the foot say, Because I am not a hand I am not of the  body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;And if the ear say, Because I am not an eye I am not of  the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if all  hearing, where the smelling?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;But now God has set the members, each one of them in the  body, according as it has pleased [him].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;But if all were one member, where the body?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;But now the members [are] many, and the body one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;The eye cannot say to the hand, I have not need of thee;  or again, the head to the feet, I have not need of you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be  weaker are necessary;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;and those [parts] of the body which we esteem to be the  more void of honour, these we clothe with more abundant honour;  and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:24">12:24</A>&nbsp;but our comely [parts] have not need. But God has tempered  the body together, having given more abundant honour to [the  part] that lacked;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:25">12:25</A>&nbsp;that there might be no division in the body, but that the  members might have the same concern one for another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:26">12:26</A>&nbsp;And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with  [it]; and if one member be glorified, all the members rejoice  with [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:27">12:27</A>&nbsp;Now *ye* are Christ's body, and members in particular.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:28">12:28</A>&nbsp;And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles;  secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers;  then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:29">12:29</A>&nbsp;[Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all  teachers? [are] all [in possession of] miraculous powers?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:30">12:30</A>&nbsp;have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do  all interpret?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:31">12:31</A>&nbsp;But desire earnestly the greater gifts, and yet shew I  unto you a way of more surpassing excellence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have  not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all  knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains,  but have not love, I am nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;And if I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I  deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not love, I  profit nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;Love has long patience, is kind; love is not emulous [of  others]; love is not insolent and rash, is not puffed up,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;does not behave in an unseemly manner, does not seek what  is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute evil,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,  endures all things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;Love never fails; but whether prophecies, they shall be  done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall  be done away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;For we know in part, and we prophesy in part:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;but when that which is perfect has come, that which is in  part shall be done away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child,  I reasoned as a child; when I became a man, I had done with  what belonged to the child.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;For we see now through a dim window obscurely, but then  face to face; now I know partially, but then I shall know  according as I also have been known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;And now abide faith, hope, love; these three things; and  the greater of these [is] love.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;Follow after love, and be emulous of spiritual  [manifestations], but rather that ye may prophesy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;For he that speaks with a tongue does not speak to men but  to God: for no one hears; but in spirit he speaks mysteries.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;But he that prophesies speaks to men [in] edification, and  encouragement, and consolation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;He that speaks with a tongue edifies himself; but he that  prophesies edifies [the] assembly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;Now I desire that ye should all speak with tongues, but  rather that ye should prophesy. But greater is he that  prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, unless he  interpret, that the assembly may receive edification.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues,  what shall I profit you, unless I shall speak to you either in  revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;Even lifeless things giving a sound, whether pipe or harp,  if they give not distinction to the sounds, how shall it be  known what is piped or harped?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;For also, if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall  prepare himself for war?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;Thus also *ye* with the tongue, unless ye give a distinct  speech, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be  speaking to the air.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the  world, and none of undistinguishable sound.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;If therefore I do not know the power of the sound, I shall  be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks a  barbarian for me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;Thus *ye* also, since ye are desirous of spirits, seek  that ye may abound for the edification of the assembly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;Wherefore let him that speaks with a tongue pray that he  may interpret.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;For if I pray with a tongue, my spirit prays, but my  understanding is unfruitful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will  pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit,  but I will sing also with the understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;Since otherwise, if thou blessest with [the] spirit, how  shall he who fills the place of the simple [Christian] say  Amen, at thy giving of thanks, since he does not know what thou  sayest?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;For *thou* indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not  edified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:18">14:18</A>&nbsp;I thank God I speak in a tongue more than all of you:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:19">14:19</A>&nbsp;but in [the] assembly I desire to speak five words with my  understanding, that I may instruct others also, [rather] than  ten thousand words in a tongue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;Brethren, be not children in [your] minds, but in malice  be babes; but in [your] minds be grown [men].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:21">14:21</A>&nbsp;It is written in the law, By people of other tongues, and  by strange lips, will I speak to this people; and neither thus  will they hear me, saith the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:22">14:22</A>&nbsp;So that tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe,  but to unbelievers; but prophecy, not to unbelievers, but to  those who believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:23">14:23</A>&nbsp;If therefore the whole assembly come together in one  place, and all speak with tongues, and simple [persons] enter  in, or unbelievers, will not they say ye are mad?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:24">14:24</A>&nbsp;But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or simple  [person] come in, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:25">14:25</A>&nbsp;the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling  upon [his] face, he will do homage to God, reporting that God  is indeed amongst you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:26">14:26</A>&nbsp;What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each  [of you] has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a  revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to  edification.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:27">14:27</A>&nbsp;If any one speak with a tongue, [let it be] two, or at the  most three, and separately, and let one interpret;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:28">14:28</A>&nbsp;but if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in [the]  assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:29">14:29</A>&nbsp;And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others  judge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:30">14:30</A>&nbsp;But if there be a revelation to another sitting [there],  let the first be silent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:31">14:31</A>&nbsp;For ye can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and  all be encouraged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:32">14:32</A>&nbsp;And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:33">14:33</A>&nbsp;For God is not [a God] of disorder but of peace, as in all  the assemblies of the saints.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:34">14:34</A>&nbsp;Let [your] women be silent in the assemblies, for it is  not permitted to them to speak; but to be in subjection, as the  law also says.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:35">14:35</A>&nbsp;But if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own  husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in  assembly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:36">14:36</A>&nbsp;Did the word of God go out from you, or did it come to you  only?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:37">14:37</A>&nbsp;If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual,  let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is  [the] Lord's commandment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:38">14:38</A>&nbsp;But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:39">14:39</A>&nbsp;So that, brethren, desire to prophesy, and do not forbid  the speaking with tongues.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:40">14:40</A>&nbsp;But let all things be done comelily and with order.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;But I make known to you, brethren, the glad tidings which I  announced to you, which also ye received, in which also ye  stand,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;by which also ye are saved, (if ye hold fast the word which  I announced to you as the glad tidings,) unless indeed ye have  believed in vain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;For I delivered to you, in the first place, what also I had  received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the  scriptures;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third  day, according to the scriptures;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of  whom the most remain until now, but some also have fallen  asleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;and last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to *me*  also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;For *I* am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be  called apostle, because I have persecuted the assembly of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;But by God's grace I am what I am; and his grace, which  [was] towards me, has not been vain; but I have laboured more  abundantly than they all, but not *I*, but the grace of God  which [was] with me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;Whether, therefore, I or they, thus we preach, and thus ye  have believed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;Now if Christ is preached that he is raised from among  [the] dead, how say some among you that there is not a  resurrection of [those that are] dead?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;But if there is not a resurrection of [those that are]  dead, neither is Christ raised:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;but if Christ is not raised, then, indeed, vain also [is]  our preaching, and vain also your faith.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;And we are found also false witnesses of God; for we have  witnessed concerning God that he raised the Christ, whom he has  not raised if indeed [those that are] dead are not raised.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:16">15:16</A>&nbsp;For if [those that are] dead are not raised, neither is  Christ raised;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;but if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are  yet in your sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:18">15:18</A>&nbsp;Then indeed also those who have fallen asleep in Christ  have perished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are [the]  most miserable of all men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;(But now Christ is raised from among [the] dead,  first-fruits of those fallen asleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:21">15:21</A>&nbsp;For since by man [came] death, by man also resurrection of  [those that are] dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;For as in the Adam all die, thus also in the Christ all  shall be made alive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;But each in his own rank: [the] first-fruits, Christ; then  those that are the Christ's at his coming.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;Then the end, when he gives up the kingdom to him [who is]  God and Father; when he shall have annulled all rule and all  authority and power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;For he must reign until he put all enemies under his feet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;[The] last enemy [that] is annulled [is] death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;For he has put all things in subjection under his feet.  But when he says that all things are put in subjection, [it is]  evident that [it is] except him who put all things in  subjection to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:28">15:28</A>&nbsp;But when all things shall have been brought into  subjection to him, then the Son also himself shall be placed in  subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that  God may be all in all.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:29">15:29</A>&nbsp;Since what shall the baptised for the dead do if [those  that are] dead rise not at all? why also are they baptised for  them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:30">15:30</A>&nbsp;Why do *we* also endanger ourselves every hour?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:31">15:31</A>&nbsp;Daily I die, by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus  our Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:32">15:32</A>&nbsp;If, [to speak] after the manner of man, I have fought with  beasts in Ephesus, what is the profit to me if [those that are]  dead do not rise? let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:33">15:33</A>&nbsp;Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:34">15:34</A>&nbsp;Awake up righteously, and sin not; for some are ignorant  of God: I speak to you as a matter of shame.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:35">15:35</A>&nbsp;But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with  what body do they come?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:36">15:36</A>&nbsp;Fool; what *thou* sowest is not quickened unless it die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:37">15:37</A>&nbsp;And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall  be, but a bare grain: it may be of wheat, or some one of the  rest:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:38">15:38</A>&nbsp;and God gives to it a body as he has pleased, and to each  of the seeds its own body.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:39">15:39</A>&nbsp;Every flesh [is] not the same flesh, but one [is] of men,  and another flesh of beasts, and another [flesh] of birds, and  another of fishes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:40">15:40</A>&nbsp;And [there are] heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but  different is the glory of the heavenly, different that of the  earthly:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:41">15:41</A>&nbsp;one [the] sun's glory, and another [the] moon's glory, and  another [the] stars' glory; for star differs from star in  glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:42">15:42</A>&nbsp;Thus also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in  corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:43">15:43</A>&nbsp;It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown  in weakness, it is raised in power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:44">15:44</A>&nbsp;It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body:  if there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [one].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:45">15:45</A>&nbsp;Thus also it is written, The first man Adam became a  living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:46">15:46</A>&nbsp;But that which is spiritual [was] not first, but that  which is natural, then that which is spiritual:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:47">15:47</A>&nbsp;the first man out of [the] earth, made of dust; the second  man, out of heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:48">15:48</A>&nbsp;Such as he made of dust, such also those made of dust; and  such as the heavenly [one], such also the heavenly [ones].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:49">15:49</A>&nbsp;And as we have borne the image of the [one] made of dust,  we shall bear also the image of the heavenly [one].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:50">15:50</A>&nbsp;But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot  inherit God's kingdom, nor does corruption inherit  incorruptibility.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:51">15:51</A>&nbsp;Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all fall  asleep, but we shall all be changed,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:52">15:52</A>&nbsp;in an instant, in [the] twinkling of an eye, at the last  trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be  raised incorruptible, and *we* shall be changed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:53">15:53</A>&nbsp;For this corruptible must needs put on incorruptibility,  and this mortal put on immortality.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:54">15:54</A>&nbsp;But when this corruptible shall have put on  incorruptibility, and this mortal shall have put on  immortality, then shall come to pass the word written: Death  has been swallowed up in victory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:55">15:55</A>&nbsp;Where, O death, [is] thy sting? where, O death, thy  victory?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:56">15:56</A>&nbsp;Now the sting of death [is] sin, and the power of sin the  law;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:57">15:57</A>&nbsp;but thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord  Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:58">15:58</A>&nbsp;So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable,  abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your  toil is not in vain in [the] Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed  the assemblies of Galatia, so do *ye* do also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;On [the] first of [the] week let each of you put by at  home, laying up [in] whatever [degree] he may have prospered,  that there may be no collections when I come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;And when I am arrived, whomsoever ye shall approve, these I  will send with letters to carry your bounty to Jerusalem:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;and if it be suitable that *I* also should go, they shall  go with me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;But I will come to you when I shall have gone through  Macedonia; for I do go through Macedonia.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;But perhaps I will stay with you, or even winter with you,  that *ye* may set me forward wheresoever I may go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;For I will not see you now in passing, for I hope to remain  a certain time with you, if the Lord permit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;But I remain in Ephesus until Pentecost.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;For a great door is opened to me and an effectual [one],  and [the] adversaries many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without  fear; for he works the work of the Lord, even as I.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;Let not therefore any one despise him; but set him forward  in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the  brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;Now concerning the brother Apollos, I begged him much that  he would go to you with the brethren; but it was not at all  [his] will to go now; but he will come when he shall have good  opportunity.</p>
