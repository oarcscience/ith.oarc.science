### Darby Bible: 3 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love
in truth.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Beloved, I desire that in all things thou
shouldest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospers.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> For I rejoiced exceedingly when \[the\]
brethren came and bore testimony to thy \[holding fast the\] truth, even
as \*thou\* walkest in truth.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I have no greater joy than these things
that I hear of my children walking in the truth.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Beloved, thou doest faithfully \[in\]
whatever thou mayest have wrought towards the brethren and that
strangers,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> (who have witnessed of thy love before
\[the\] assembly,) in setting forward whom on their journey worthily of
God, thou wilt do well;

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> for for the name have they gone forth,
taking nothing of those of the nations.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> \*We\* therefore ought to receive such,
that we may be fellow-workers with the truth.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> I wrote something to the assembly; but
Diotrephes, who loves to have the first place among them, receives us
not.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For this reason, if I come, I will bring
to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with wicked
words; and not content with these, neither does he himself receive the
brethren; and those who would he prevents, and casts \[them\] out of the
assembly.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but
what is good. He that does good is of God. He that does evil has not
seen God.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Demetrius has witness borne to him by
all, and by the truth itself; and \*we\* also bear witness, and thou
knowest that our witness is true.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> I had many things to write to thee, but I
will not with ink and pen write to thee;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> but I hope soon to see thee, and we will
speak mouth to mouth.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Peace \[be\] to thee. The friends greet
thee. Greet the friends by name.
