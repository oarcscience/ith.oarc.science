</p> <h3 align="center" align="center">Darby Bible: Song of Solomon</h3> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The song of songs, which is Solomon's.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For thy love  is better than wine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Thine ointments savour sweetly; Thy name is an ointment  poured forth: Therefore do the virgins love thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Draw me, we will run after thee! -- The king hath brought me  into his chambers -- We will be glad and rejoice in thee, We  will remember thy love more than wine. They love thee  uprightly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;I am black, but comely, daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents  of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;Look not upon me, because I am black; Because the sun hath  looked upon me. My mother's children were angry with me: They  made me keeper of the vineyards; Mine own vineyard have I not  kept.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;Tell me, thou whom my soul loveth, Where thou feedest [thy  flock], Where thou makest it to rest at noon; For why should I  be as one veiled Beside the flocks of thy companions?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;If thou know not, thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth  by the footsteps of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the  shepherds' booths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;I compare thee, my love, To a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Thy cheeks are comely with bead-rows, Thy neck with  ornamental chains.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;We will make thee bead-rows of gold With studs of silver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;While the king is at his table, My spikenard sendeth forth  its fragrance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;A bundle of myrrh is my beloved unto me; He shall pass the  night between my breasts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;My beloved is unto me a cluster of henna-flowers In the  vineyards of Engedi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou art fair, my love; Behold, thou art fair:  thine eyes are doves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant; Also our  bed is green.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;The beams of our houses are cedars, Our rafters are  cypresses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;I am a narcissus of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;As the lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, So is my  beloved among the sons: In his shadow have I rapture and sit  down; And his fruit is sweet to my taste.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;He hath brought me to the house of wine, And his banner over  me is love.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Sustain ye me with raisin-cakes, Refresh me with apples; For  I am sick of love.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;His left hand is under my head, And his right hand doth  embrace me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles, or by  the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake [my]  love, till he please.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;The voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh Leaping upon the  mountains, Skipping upon the hills.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. Behold, he  standeth behind our wall, He looketh in through the windows,  Glancing through the lattice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;My beloved spake and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my  fair one, and come away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over, it is  gone:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;The flowers appear on the earth; The time of singing is  come, And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;The fig-tree melloweth her winter figs, And the vines in  bloom give forth [their] fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair  one, and come away!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;My dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the  precipice, Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice;  For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Take us the foxes, The little foxes, that spoil the  vineyards; For our vineyards are in bloom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;My beloved is mine, and I am his; He feedeth [his flock]  among the lilies,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;Until the day dawn, and the shadows flee away. Turn, my  beloved: be thou like a gazelle or a young hart, Upon the  mountains of Bether.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;On my bed, in the nights, I sought him whom my soul loveth:  I sought him, but I found him not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;I will rise now, and go about the city; In the streets and  in the broadways Will I seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought  him, but I found him not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;The watchmen that go about the city found me: -- Have ye  seen him whom my soul loveth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;-- Scarcely had I passed from them, When I found him whom my  soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, Until I had  brought him into my mother's house, And into the chamber of her  that conceived me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles, or by  the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake [my]  love, till he please.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;Who is this, [she] that cometh up from the wilderness Like  pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With  all powders of the merchant? ...</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Behold his couch, Solomon's own: Threescore mighty men are  about it, Of the mighty of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;They all hold the sword, Experts in war; Each hath his sword  upon his thigh Because of alarm in the nights.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;King Solomon made himself a palanquin Of the wood of  Lebanon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Its pillars he made of silver, Its support of gold, Its  seat of purple; The midst thereof was paved [with] love By the  daughters of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Go forth, daughters of Zion, And behold king Solomon With  the crown wherewith his mother crowned him In the day of his  espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine  eyes are doves behind thy veil; Thy hair is as a flock of  goats, On the slopes of mount Gilead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Thy teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep, Which go up from  the washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is barren  among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy speech is  comely; As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind thy  veil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Thy neck is like the tower of David, Built for an armoury: A  thousand bucklers hang thereon, All shields of mighty men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle,  Which feed among the lilies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Until the day dawn, and the shadows flee away, I will get me  to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;[Come] with me, from Lebanon, [my] spouse, With me from  Lebanon, -- Come, look from the top of Amanah, From the top of  Senir and Hermon, From the lions' dens, From the mountains of  the leopards.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, [my] spouse; Thou  hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain  of thy neck.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] spouse! How much  better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine  ointments than all spices!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;Thy lips, [my] spouse, drop [as] the honeycomb; Honey and  milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is  like the smell of Lebanon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;A garden enclosed is my sister, [my] spouse; A spring shut  up, a fountain sealed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Thy shoots are a paradise of pomegranates, with precious  fruits; Henna with spikenard plants;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Spikenard and saffron; Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees  of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;A fountain in the gardens, A well of living waters, Which  stream from Lebanon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;Awake, north wind, and come, [thou] south; Blow upon my  garden, [that] the spices thereof may flow forth. Let my  beloved come into his garden, And eat its precious fruits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;I am come into my garden, my sister, [my] spouse; I have  gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with  my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends;  drink, yea, drink abundantly, beloved ones!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;I slept, but my heart was awake. The voice of my beloved! he  knocketh: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, mine  undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the  drops of the night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;-- I have put off my tunic, how should I put it on? I have  washed my feet, how should I pollute them? --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;My beloved put in his hand by the hole [of the door]; And my  bowels yearned for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with  myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of  the lock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn  himself; he was gone: My soul went forth when he spoke. I  sought him, but I found him not; I called him, but he gave me  no answer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;The watchmen that went about the city found me; They smote  me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my veil  from me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved,  ... What will ye tell him? -- That I am sick of love.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, Thou  fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than [another]  beloved, That thou dost so charge us?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten  thousand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;His head is [as] the finest gold; His locks are flowing,  black as the raven;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;His eyes are like doves by the water-brooks, Washed with  milk, fitly set;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;His cheeks are as a bed of spices, raised beds of sweet  plants; His lips lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;His hands gold rings, set with the chrysolite; His belly is  bright ivory, overlaid [with] sapphires;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;His legs, pillars of marble, set upon bases of fine gold:  His bearing as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;His mouth is most sweet: Yea, he is altogether lovely. This  is my beloved, yea, this is my friend, O daughters of  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Whither is thy beloved gone, Thou fairest among women?  Whither is thy beloved turned aside? And we will seek him with  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of  spices, To feed in the gardens and to gather lilies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: He feedeth [his  flock] among the lilies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem,  Terrible as troops with banners:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Turn away thine eyes from me, For they overcome me. Thy hair  is as a flock of goats On the slopes of Gilead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep Which go up from the  washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is barren among  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind thy veil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And  virgins without number:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;My dove, mine undefiled, is but one; She is the only one of  her mother, She is the choice one of her that bore her. The  daughters saw her, and they called her blessed; The queens and  the concubines, and they praised her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn, Fair as the  moon, clear as the sun, Terrible as troops with banners?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the verdure of  the valley, To see whether the vine budded, Whether the  pomegranates blossomed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;Before I was aware, My soul set me upon the chariots of my  willing people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Return, return, O Shulamite; Return, return, that we may  look upon thee. -- What would ye look upon in the Shulamite? --  As it were the dance of two camps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;How beautiful are thy footsteps in sandals, O prince's  daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like jewels, The work  of the hands of an artist.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;Thy navel is a round goblet, [which] wanteth not mixed wine;  Thy belly a heap of wheat, set about with lilies;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine eyes, [like] the  pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose like the  tower of Lebanon, Which looketh toward Damascus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the locks of thy head  like purple; The king is fettered by [thy] ringlets!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;How fair and how pleasant art thou, [my] love, in delights!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to  grape clusters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;I said, I will go up to the palm-tree, I will take hold of  the boughs thereof; And thy breasts shall indeed be like  clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy nose like  apples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, ... That goeth  down smoothly for my beloved, And stealeth over the lips of  them that are asleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;I am my beloved's, And his desire is toward me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;-- Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields; Let  us lodge in the villages.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;We will go up early to the vineyards, We will see if the  vine hath budded, [If] the blossom is opening, And the  pomegranates are in bloom: There will I give thee my loves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;The mandrakes yield fragrance; And at our gates are all  choice fruits, new and old: I have laid them up for thee, my  beloved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;Oh that thou wert as my brother, That sucked the breasts of  my mother! Should I find thee without, I would kiss thee; And  they would not despise me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;I would lead thee, bring thee into my mother's house; Thou  wouldest instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced  wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;His left hand would be under my head, And his right hand  embrace me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, ... Why should ye stir  up, why awake [my] love, till he please?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, Leaning upon  her beloved? I awoke thee under the apple-tree: There thy  mother brought thee forth; There she brought thee forth [that]  bore thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;Set me as a seal upon thy heart, As a seal upon thine arm:  For love is strong as death; Jealousy is cruel as Sheol: The  flashes thereof are flashes of fire, Flames of Jah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;Many waters cannot quench love, Neither do the floods drown  it: Even if a man gave all the substance of his house for love,  It would utterly be contemned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;We have a little sister, And she hath no breasts: What shall  we do for our sister In the day when she shall be spoken for?  --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;If she be a wall, We will build upon her a turret of silver;  And if she be a door, We will enclose her with boards of cedar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;I am a wall, and my breasts like towers; Then was I in his  eyes as one that findeth peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon: He let out the  vineyard unto keepers; Every one for the fruit thereof was to  bring a thousand silver-pieces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: The thousand  [silver-pieces] be to thee, Solomon; And to the keepers of its  fruit, two hundred.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;Thou that dwellest in the gardens, The companions hearken  to thy voice: Let me hear [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;Haste, my beloved, And be thou like a gazelle or a young  hart Upon the mountains of spices.</p>
