<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a relation  concerning the matters fully believed among us,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;as those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses of and  attendants on the Word have delivered them to us,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;it has seemed good to *me* also, accurately acquainted from  the origin with all things, to write to thee with method, most  excellent Theophilus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;that thou mightest know the certainty of those things in  which thou hast been instructed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a  certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and  his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And they were both just before God, walking in all the  commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and  they were both advanced in years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he fulfilled his priestly service  before God in the order of his course,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the  priesthood, to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn  incense.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;And all the multitude of the people were praying without at  the hour of incense.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him, standing on the  right of the altar of incense.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And Zacharias was troubled, seeing [him], and fear fell  upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias, because thy  supplication has been heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear  thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And he shall be to thee joy and rejoicing, and many shall  rejoice at his birth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;For he shall be great before [the] Lord, and he shall drink  no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with [the]  Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to [the] Lord  their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;And *he* shall go before him in [the] spirit and power of  Elias, to turn hearts of fathers to children, and disobedient  ones to [the] thoughts of just [men], to make ready for [the]  Lord a prepared people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this, for  *I* am an old man, and my wife advanced in years?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And the angel answering, said to him, *I* am Gabriel, who  stand before God, and I have been sent to speak to thee, and to  bring these glad tidings to thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;and behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak,  till the day in which these things shall take place, because  thou hast not believed my words, the which shall be fulfilled  in their time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;And the people were awaiting Zacharias, and they wondered  at his delaying in the temple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;But when he came out he could not speak to them, and they  recognised that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was  making signs to them, and continued dumb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the days of his service were  completed, he departed to his house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;Now after these days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid  herself five months, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;Thus has [the] Lord done to me in [these] days in which he  looked upon [me] to take away my reproach among men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;But in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent of God  to a city of Galilee, of which [the] name [was] Nazareth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name [was] Joseph, of  the house of David; and the virgin's name [was] Mary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;And the angel came in to her, and said, Hail, [thou]  favoured one! the Lord [is] with thee: [blessed art *thou*  amongst women].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;But she, [seeing] [the angel], was troubled at his word,  and reasoned in her mind what this salutation might be.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast  found favour with God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;and behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son,  and thou shalt call his name Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;*He* shall be great, and shall be called Son of [the]  Highest; and [the] Lord God shall give him the throne of David  his father;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for the ages,  and of his kingdom there shall not be an end.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:34">1:34</A>&nbsp;But Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I know  not a man?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:35">1:35</A>&nbsp;And the angel answering said to her, [The] Holy Spirit  shall come upon thee, and power of [the] Highest overshadow  thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall  be called Son of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:36">1:36</A>&nbsp;And behold, Elizabeth, thy kinswoman, she also has  conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to  her that was called barren:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:37">1:37</A>&nbsp;for nothing shall be impossible with God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:38">1:38</A>&nbsp;And Mary said, Behold the bondmaid of [the] Lord; be it to  me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:39">1:39</A>&nbsp;And Mary, rising up in those days, went into the hill  country with haste, to a city of Judah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:40">1:40</A>&nbsp;and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted  Elizabeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:41">1:41</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as Elizabeth heard the salutation of  Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled  with [the] Holy Spirit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:42">1:42</A>&nbsp;and cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed [art]  *thou* amongst women, and blessed the fruit of thy womb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:43">1:43</A>&nbsp;And whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord  should come to me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:44">1:44</A>&nbsp;For behold, as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my  ears, the babe leaped with joy in my womb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:45">1:45</A>&nbsp;And blessed [is] she that has believed, for there shall be  a fulfilment of the things spoken to her from [the] Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:46">1:46</A>&nbsp;And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:47">1:47</A>&nbsp;and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:48">1:48</A>&nbsp;For he has looked upon the low estate of his bondmaid; for  behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:49">1:49</A>&nbsp;For the Mighty One has done to me great things, and holy  [is] his name;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:50">1:50</A>&nbsp;and his mercy [is] to generations and generations to them  that fear him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:51">1:51</A>&nbsp;He has wrought strength with his arm; he has scattered  haughty [ones] in the thought of their heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:52">1:52</A>&nbsp;He has put down rulers from thrones, and exalted the lowly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:53">1:53</A>&nbsp;He has filled the hungry with good things, and sent away  the rich empty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:54">1:54</A>&nbsp;He has helped Israel his servant, in order to remember  mercy,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:55">1:55</A>&nbsp;(as he spoke to our fathers,) to Abraham and to his seed  for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:56">1:56</A>&nbsp;And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to  her house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:57">1:57</A>&nbsp;But the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth that she should  bring forth, and she gave birth to a son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:58">1:58</A>&nbsp;And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard that [the] Lord had  magnified his mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:59">1:59</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the eighth day they came to  circumcise the child, and they called it after the name of his  father, Zacharias.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:60">1:60</A>&nbsp;And his mother answering said, No; but he shall be called  John.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:61">1:61</A>&nbsp;And they said to her, There is no one among thy kinsfolk  who is called by this name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:62">1:62</A>&nbsp;And they made signs to his father as to what he might wish  it to be called.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:63">1:63</A>&nbsp;And having asked for a writing-table, he wrote saying, John  is his name. And they all wondered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:64">1:64</A>&nbsp;And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and  he spake, blessing God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:65">1:65</A>&nbsp;And fear came upon all who dwelt round about them; and in  the whole hill-country of Judaea all these things were the  subject of conversation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:66">1:66</A>&nbsp;And all who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying,  What then will this child be? And [the] Lord's hand was with  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:67">1:67</A>&nbsp;And Zacharias his father was filled with [the] Holy Spirit,  and prophesied, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:68">1:68</A>&nbsp;Blessed be [the] Lord the God of Israel, because he has  visited and wrought redemption for his people,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:69">1:69</A>&nbsp;and raised up a horn of deliverance for us in the house of  David his servant;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:70">1:70</A>&nbsp;as he spoke by [the] mouth of his holy prophets, who have  been since the world began;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:71">1:71</A>&nbsp;deliverance from our enemies and out of the hand of all who  hate us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:72">1:72</A>&nbsp;to fulfil mercy with our fathers and remember his holy  covenant,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:73">1:73</A>&nbsp;[the] oath which he swore to Abraham our father,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:74">1:74</A>&nbsp;to give us, that, saved out of the hand of our enemies, we  should serve him without fear</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:75">1:75</A>&nbsp;in piety and righteousness before him all our days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:76">1:76</A>&nbsp;And *thou*, child, shalt be called [the] prophet of [the]  Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of [the] Lord to  make ready his ways;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:77">1:77</A>&nbsp;to give knowledge of deliverance to his people by [the]  remission of their sins</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:78">1:78</A>&nbsp;on account of [the] bowels of mercy of our God; wherein  [the] dayspring from on high has visited us,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:79">1:79</A>&nbsp;to shine upon them who were sitting in darkness and in  [the] shadow of death, to guide our feet into [the] way of  peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:80">1:80</A>&nbsp;-- And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit; and  he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;But it came to pass in those days that a decree went out  from Caesar Augustus, that a census should be made of all the  habitable world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;The census itself first took place when Cyrenius had the  government of Syria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And all went to be inscribed in the census roll, each to his  own city:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;and Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city  Nazareth to Judaea, to David's city, the which is called  Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;to be inscribed in the census roll with Mary who was  betrothed to him [as his] wife, she being great with child.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, while they were there, the days of her  giving birth [to her child] were fulfilled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;and she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him up  in swaddling-clothes and laid him in the manger, because there  was no room for them in the inn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And there were shepherds in that country abiding without,  and keeping watch by night over their flock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And lo, an angel of [the] Lord was there by them, and [the]  glory of [the] Lord shone around them, and they feared [with]  great fear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And the angel said to them, Fear not, for behold, I  announce to you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to  all the people;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;for to-day a Saviour has been born to you in David's city,  who is Christ [the] Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And this is the sign to you: ye shall find a babe wrapped  in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the  heavenly host, praising God and saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good  pleasure in men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as the angels departed from them into  heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, Let us make our  way then now as far as Bethlehem, and let us see this thing  that is come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph,  and the babe lying in the manger;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;and having seen [it] they made known about the country the  thing which had been said to them concerning this child.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And all who heard [it] wondered at the things said to them  by the shepherds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;But Mary kept all these things [in her mind], pondering  [them] in her heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for  all things which they had heard and seen, as it had been said  to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him,  his name was called Jesus, which was the name given by the  angel before he had been conceived in the womb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;And when the days were fulfilled for their purifying  according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem to  present [him] to the Lord</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;(as it is written in the law of [the] Lord: Every male that  opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the  law of [the] Lord: A pair of turtle doves, or two young  pigeons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was  Simeon; and this man was just and pious, awaiting the  consolation of Israel, and [the] Holy Spirit was upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit,  that he should not see death before he should see [the] Lord's  Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:27">2:27</A>&nbsp;And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and as the  parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him  according to the custom of the law,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:28">2:28</A>&nbsp;*he* received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:29">2:29</A>&nbsp;Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy  word, in peace;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:30">2:30</A>&nbsp;for mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:31">2:31</A>&nbsp;which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:32">2:32</A>&nbsp;a light for revelation of [the] Gentiles and [the] glory of  thy people Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:33">2:33</A>&nbsp;And his father and mother wondered at the things which were  said concerning him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:34">2:34</A>&nbsp;And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Lo,  this [child] is set for the fall and rising up of many in  Israel, and for a sign spoken against;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:35">2:35</A>&nbsp;(and even a sword shall go through thine own soul;) so that  [the] thoughts may be revealed from many hearts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:36">2:36</A>&nbsp;And there was a prophetess, Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of  [the] tribe of Asher, who was far advanced in years, having  lived with [her] husband seven years from her virginity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:37">2:37</A>&nbsp;and herself a widow up to eighty-four years; who did not  depart from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and  prayers;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:38">2:38</A>&nbsp;and she coming up the same hour gave praise to the Lord,  and spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:39">2:39</A>&nbsp;And when they had completed all things according to the law  of [the] Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own city  Nazareth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:40">2:40</A>&nbsp;And the child grew and waxed strong [in spirit], filled  with wisdom, and God's grace was upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:41">2:41</A>&nbsp;And his parents went yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of  the passover.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:42">2:42</A>&nbsp;And when he was twelve years old, and they went up [to  Jerusalem] according to the custom of the feast</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:43">2:43</A>&nbsp;and had completed the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus  remained behind in Jerusalem, and his parents knew not [of it];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:44">2:44</A>&nbsp;but, supposing him to be in the company that journeyed  together, they went a day's journey, and sought him among their  relations and acquaintances:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:45">2:45</A>&nbsp;and not having found him they returned to Jerusalem seeking  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:46">2:46</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the  temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and hearing them  and asking them questions.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:47">2:47</A>&nbsp;And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding  and answers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:48">2:48</A>&nbsp;And when they saw him they were amazed: and his mother said  to him, Child, why hast thou dealt thus with us? behold, thy  father and I have sought thee distressed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:49">2:49</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Why [is it] that ye have sought me?  did ye not know that I ought to be [occupied] in my Father's  business?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:50">2:50</A>&nbsp;And they understood not the thing that he said to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:51">2:51</A>&nbsp;And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he was  in subjection to them. And his mother kept all these things in  her heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:52">2:52</A>&nbsp;And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour  with God and men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Now in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius  Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod  tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother tetrarch of Ituraea  and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of  Abilene,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, [the] word of  God came upon John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And he came into all the district round the Jordan,  preaching [the] baptism of repentance for [the] remission of  sins,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;as it is written in [the] book of [the] words of Esaias the  prophet: Voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the  way of [the] Lord, make straight his paths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Every gorge shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill  shall be brought low, and the crooked [places] shall become a  straight [path], and the rough places smooth ways,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;He said therefore to the crowds which went out to be  baptised by him, Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to  flee from the coming wrath?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Produce therefore fruits worthy of repentance; and begin not  to say in yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father, for I  say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up  children to Abraham.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;And already also the axe is applied to the root of the  trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut  down and cast into [the] fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And the crowds asked him saying, What should we do then?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;And he answering says to them, He that has two body-coats,  let him give to him that has none; and he that has food, let  him do likewise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And tax-gatherers came also to be baptised, and they said  to him, Teacher, what should we do?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Take no more [money] than what is  appointed to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And persons engaged in military service also asked him  saying, And we, what should we do? And he said to them, Oppress  no one, nor accuse falsely, and be satisfied with your pay.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;But as the people were in expectation, and all were  reasoning in their hearts concerning John whether *he* might be  the Christ,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;John answered all, saying, *I* indeed baptise you with  water, but the mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose  sandals I am not fit to unloose; *he* shall baptise you with  [the] Holy Spirit and fire;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;whose winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly  purge his threshing-floor, and will gather the wheat into his  garner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;Exhorting then many other things also he announced [his]  glad tidings to the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him as to  Herodias, the wife of his brother, and as to all the wicked  things which Herod had done,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;added this also to all [the rest], that he shut up John in  prison.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, all the people having been baptised,  and Jesus having been baptised and praying, that the heaven was  opened,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove  upon him; and a voice came out of heaven, *Thou* art my beloved  Son, in thee I have found my delight.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;forty days, tempted of the devil; and in those days he did  not eat anything, and when they were finished he hungered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And the devil said to him, If thou be Son of God, speak to  this stone, that it become bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answered unto him saying, It is written, Man shall  not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And [the devil], leading him up into a high mountain, shewed  him all the kingdoms of the habitable world in a moment of  time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And the devil said to him, I will give thee all this power,  and their glory; for it is given up to me, and to whomsoever I  will I give it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;If therefore *thou* wilt do homage before me, all [of it]  shall be thine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering him said, It is written, Thou shalt do  homage to [the] Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the edge of the  temple, and said to him, If thou be Son of God, cast thyself  down hence;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;for it is written, He shall give charge to his angels  concerning thee to keep thee;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to him, It is said, Thou shalt not  tempt [the] Lord thy God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;And the devil, having completed every temptation, departed  from him for a time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee;  and a rumour went out into the whole surrounding country about  him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;and *he* taught in their synagogues, being glorified of  all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up; and he  entered, according to his custom, into the synagogue on the  sabbath day, and stood up to read.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;And [the] book of the prophet Esaias was given to him; and  having unrolled the book he found the place where it was  written,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;[The] Spirit of [the] Lord is upon me, because he has  anointed me to preach glad tidings to [the] poor; he has sent  me to preach to captives deliverance, and to [the] blind sight,  to send forth [the] crushed delivered,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;to preach [the] acceptable year of [the] Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;And having rolled up the book, when he had delivered it up  to the attendant, he sat down; and the eyes of all in the  synagogue were fixed upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;And he began to say to them, To-day this scripture is  fulfilled in your ears.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;And all bore witness to him, and wondered at the words of  grace which were coming out of his mouth. And they said, Is not  this the son of Joseph?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Ye will surely say to me this parable,  Physician, heal thyself; whatsoever we have heard has taken  place in Capernaum do here also in thine own country.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;And he said, Verily I say to you, that no prophet is  acceptable in his [own] country.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;But of a truth I say to you, There were many widows in  Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up for  three years and six months, so that a great famine came upon  all the land,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;and to none of them was Elias sent but to Sarepta of  Sidonia, to a woman [that was] a widow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha  the prophet, and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the  Syrian.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:28">4:28</A>&nbsp;And they were all filled with rage in the synagogue,  hearing these things;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:29">4:29</A>&nbsp;and rising up they cast him forth out of the city, and led  him up to the brow of the mountain upon which their city was  built, so that they might throw him down the precipice;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:30">4:30</A>&nbsp;but *he*, passing through the midst of them, went his way,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:31">4:31</A>&nbsp;and descended to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught  them on the sabbaths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:32">4:32</A>&nbsp;And they were astonished at his doctrine, for his word was  with authority.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:33">4:33</A>&nbsp;And there was in the synagogue a man having a spirit of an  unclean demon, and he cried with a loud voice,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:34">4:34</A>&nbsp;saying, Eh! what have we to do with thee, Jesus, Nazarene?  hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the  Holy [One] of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:35">4:35</A>&nbsp;And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out  from him. And the demon, having thrown him down into the midst,  came out from him without doing him any injury.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:36">4:36</A>&nbsp;And astonishment came upon all, and they spoke to one  another, saying, What word [is] this? for with authority and  power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:37">4:37</A>&nbsp;And a rumour went out into every place of the country round  concerning him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:38">4:38</A>&nbsp;And rising up out of the synagogue, he entered into the  house of Simon. But Simon's mother-in-law was suffering under a  bad fever; and they asked him for her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:39">4:39</A>&nbsp;And standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left  her; and forthwith standing up she served them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:40">4:40</A>&nbsp;And when the sun went down, all, as many as had persons  sick with divers diseases, brought them to him, and having laid  his hands on every one of them, he healed them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:41">4:41</A>&nbsp;and demons also went out from many, crying out and saying,  *Thou* art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them  not to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:42">4:42</A>&nbsp;And when it was day he went out, and went into a desert  place, and the crowds sought after him, and came up to him, and  [would have] kept him back that he should not go from them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:43">4:43</A>&nbsp;But he said to them, I must needs announce the glad tidings  of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for for this I  have been sent forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:44">4:44</A>&nbsp;And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as the crowd pressed on him to hear the  word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;and he saw two ships standing by the lake, but the  fishermen, having come down from them, were washing their nets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And getting into one of the ships, which was Simon's, he  asked him to draw out a little from the land; and he sat down  and taught the crowds out of the ship.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;But when he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, Draw out into  the deep [water] and let down your nets for a haul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And Simon answering said to him, Master, having laboured  through the whole night we have taken nothing, but at thy word  I will let down the net.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of  fishes. And their net broke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;And they beckoned to their partners who were in the other  ship to come and help them, and they came, and filled both the  ships, so that they were sinking.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;But Simon Peter, seeing it, fell at Jesus' knees, saying,  Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;For astonishment had laid hold on him, and on all those who  were with him, at the haul of fishes which they had taken;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;and in like manner also on James and John, sons of Zebedee,  who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear  not; henceforth thou shalt be catching men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And having run the ships on shore, leaving all they  followed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as he was in one of the cities, that  behold, there was a man full of leprosy, and seeing Jesus,  falling upon his face, he besought him saying, Lord, if thou  wilt, thou art able to cleanse me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;And stretching forth his hand he touched him, saying, I  will; be thou cleansed: and immediately the leprosy departed  from him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And he enjoined him to tell no one; but go, shew thyself to  the priest, and offer for thy cleansing as Moses ordained, for  a testimony to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;But the report concerning him was spread abroad still more,  and great crowds came together to hear, and to be healed from  their infirmities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;And *he* withdrew himself, and was about in the desert  [places] and praying.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on one of the days, that *he* was  teaching, and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law  sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and  Judaea and [out of] Jerusalem; and [the] Lord's power was  [there] to heal them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;And lo, men bringing upon a couch a man who was paralysed;  and they sought to bring him in, and put [him] before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;And not finding what way to bring him in, on account of the  crowd, going up on the housetop they let him down through the  tiles, with his little couch, into the midst before Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason [in their  minds], saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who is able  to forgive sins but God alone?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;But Jesus, knowing their reasonings, answering said to  them, Why reason ye in your hearts?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to  say, Rise up and walk?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth  to forgive sins, he said to the paralysed man, I say to thee,  Arise, and take up thy little couch and go to thine house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;And immediately standing up before them, having taken up  that whereon he was laid, he departed to his house, glorifying  God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;And astonishment seized all, and they glorified God, and  were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things  to-day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;And after these things he went forth and saw a  tax-gatherer, Levi by name, sitting at the receipt of taxes,  and said to him, Follow me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;And having left all, rising up, he followed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;And Levi made a great entertainment for him in his house,  and there was a great crowd of tax-gatherers and others who  were at table with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured at his  disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with tax-gatherers  and sinners?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:31">5:31</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, They that are in sound  health have not need of a physician, but those that are ill.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:32">5:32</A>&nbsp;I am not come to call righteous [persons], but sinful  [ones] to repentance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:33">5:33</A>&nbsp;And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast  often and make supplications, in like manner those also of the  Pharisees, but thine eat and drink?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:34">5:34</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Can ye make the sons of the  bridechamber fast when the bridegroom is with them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:35">5:35</A>&nbsp;But days will come when also the bridegroom will have been  taken away from them; then shall they fast in those days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:36">5:36</A>&nbsp;And he spoke also a parable to them: No one puts a piece of  a new garment upon an old garment, otherwise he will both rend  the new, and the piece which is from the new will not suit with  the old.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:37">5:37</A>&nbsp;And no one puts new wine into old skins, otherwise the new  wine will burst the skins, and it will be poured out, and the  skins will be destroyed;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:38">5:38</A>&nbsp;but new wine is to be put into new skins, and both are  preserved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:39">5:39</A>&nbsp;And no one having drunk old wine [straightway] wishes for  new, for he says, The old is better.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on [the] second-first sabbath, that he  went through cornfields, and his disciples were plucking the  ears and eating [them], rubbing [them] in their hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what is  not lawful to do on the sabbath?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, Have ye not read so much  as this, what David did when he hungered, he and those who were  with him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;how he entered into the house of God and took the shewbread  and ate, and gave to those also who were with him, which it is  not lawful that [any] eat, unless the priests alone?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath  also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on another sabbath also that he entered  into the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there, and  his right hand was withered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching if he would  heal on the sabbath, that they might find something of which to  accuse him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;But *he* knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had  the withered hand, Get up, and stand in the midst. And having  risen up he stood [there].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said to them, I will ask you if it is lawful  on the sabbath to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to  destroy [it]?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And having looked around on them all, he said to him,  Stretch out thy hand. And he did [so] and his hand was restored  as the other.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;But *they* were filled with madness, and they spoke  together among themselves what they should do to Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in those days that he went out into the  mountain to pray, and he spent the night in prayer to God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;And when it was day he called his disciples, and having  chosen out twelve from them, whom also he named apostles:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;Simon, to whom also he gave the name of Peter, and Andrew  his brother, [and] James and John, [and] Philip and  Bartholomew,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;[and] Matthew and Thomas, James the [son] of Alphaeus and  Simon who was called Zealot,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;[and] Judas [brother] of James, and Judas Iscariote, who  was also [his] betrayer;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;and having descended with them, he stood on a level place,  and a crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of the  people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre  and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their  diseases;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;and those that were beset by unclean spirits were healed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power went out  from him and healed all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;And *he*, lifting up his eyes upon his disciples, said,  Blessed [are] ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;Blessed ye that hunger now, for ye shall be filled. Blessed  ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and when they shall  separate you [from them], and shall reproach [you], and cast  out your name as wicked, for the Son of man's sake:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your  reward is great in the heaven, for after this manner did their  fathers act toward the prophets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;But woe to you rich, for ye have received your consolation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;Woe to you that are filled, for ye shall hunger. Woe to you  who laugh now, for ye shall mourn and weep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;Woe, when all men speak well of you, for after this manner  did their fathers to the false prophets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;But to you that hear I say, Love your enemies; do good to  those that hate you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;bless those that curse you; pray for those who use you  despitefully.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;To him that smites thee on the cheek, offer also the other;  and from him that would take away thy garment, forbid not thy  body-coat also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:30">6:30</A>&nbsp;To every one that asks of thee, give; and from him that  takes away what is thine, ask it not back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:31">6:31</A>&nbsp;And as ye wish that men should do to you, do *ye* also to  them in like manner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:32">6:32</A>&nbsp;And if ye love those that love you, what thank is it to  you? for even sinners love those that love them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:33">6:33</A>&nbsp;And if ye do good to those that do good to you, what thank  is it to you? for even sinners do the same.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:34">6:34</A>&nbsp;And if ye lend to those from whom ye hope to receive, what  thank is it to you? [for] even sinners lend to sinners that  they may receive the like.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:35">6:35</A>&nbsp;But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for  nothing in return, and your reward shall be great, and ye shall  be sons of [the] Highest; for *he* is good to the unthankful  and wicked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:36">6:36</A>&nbsp;Be ye therefore merciful, even as your Father also is  merciful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:37">6:37</A>&nbsp;And judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and  ye shall not be condemned. Remit, and it shall be remitted to  you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:38">6:38</A>&nbsp;Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed  down, and shaken together, and running over, shall be given  into your bosom: for with the same measure with which ye mete  it shall be measured to you again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:39">6:39</A>&nbsp;And he spoke also a parable to them: Can a blind [man] lead  a blind [man]? shall not both fall into [the] ditch?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:40">6:40</A>&nbsp;The disciple is not above his teacher, but every one that  is perfected shall be as his teacher.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:41">6:41</A>&nbsp;But why lookest thou on the mote which is in the eye of thy  brother, but perceivest not the beam which is in thine own eye?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:42">6:42</A>&nbsp;or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, allow [me],  I will cast out the mote that is in thine eye, thyself not  seeing the beam that is in thine eye? Hypocrite, cast out first  the beam out of thine eye, and then thou shalt see clear to  cast out the mote which is in the eye of thy brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:43">6:43</A>&nbsp;For there is no good tree which produces corrupt fruit, nor  a corrupt tree which produces good fruit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:44">6:44</A>&nbsp;for every tree is known by its own fruit, for figs are not  gathered from thorns, nor grapes vintaged from a bramble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:45">6:45</A>&nbsp;The good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings  forth good; and the wicked [man] out of the wicked, brings  forth what is wicked: for out of the abundance of the heart his  mouth speaks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:46">6:46</A>&nbsp;And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things that  I say?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:47">6:47</A>&nbsp;Every one that comes to me, and hears my words and does  them, I will shew you to whom he is like.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:48">6:48</A>&nbsp;He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep,  and laid a foundation on the rock; but a great rain coming, the  stream broke upon that house, and could not shake it, for it  had been founded on the rock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:49">6:49</A>&nbsp;And he that has heard and not done, is like a man who has  built a house on the ground without [a] foundation, on which  the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the breach of  that house was great.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And when he had completed all his words in the hearing of  the people, he entered into Capernaum.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;And a certain centurion's bondman who was dear to him was  ill and about to die;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;and having heard of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the  Jews, begging him that he might come and save his bondman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;But they, being come to Jesus, besought him diligently,  saying, He is worthy to whom thou shouldest grant this,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;for he loves our nation, and himself has built the synagogue  for us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;And Jesus went with them. But already, when he was not far  from the house, the centurion sent to him friends, saying to  him, Lord, do not trouble thyself, for I am not worthy that  thou shouldest enter under my roof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;Wherefore neither did I count myself worthy to come to thee.  But say by a word and my servant shall be healed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;For *I* also am a man placed under authority, having under  myself soldiers, and I say to this [one], Go, and he goes; and  to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bondman, Do this, and  he does [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;And Jesus hearing this wondered at him, and turning to the  crowd following him said, I say to you, Not even in Israel have  I found so great faith.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And they who had been sent returning to the house found the  bondman, who was ill, in good health.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass afterwards he went into a city called  Nain, and many of his disciples and a great crowd went with  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;And as he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, a dead  man was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she a  widow, and a very considerable crowd of the city [was] with  her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;And the Lord, seeing her, was moved with compassion for  her, and said to her, Weep not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;and coming up he touched the bier, and the bearers stopped.  And he said, Youth, I say to thee, Wake up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;And the dead sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to  his mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;And fear seized on all, and they glorified God, saying, A  great prophet has been raised up amongst us; and God has  visited his people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;And this report went out in all Judaea concerning him, and  in all the surrounding country.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;And the disciples of John brought him word concerning all  these things:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;and John, having called two of his disciples, sent to  Jesus, saying, Art *thou* he that is coming, or are we to wait  for another?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;But the men having come to him said, John the baptist has  sent us to thee, saying, Art *thou* he that is coming, or are  we to wait for another?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;In that hour he healed many of diseases and plagues and  evil spirits, and to many blind he granted sight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, Go, bring back word to  John of what ye have seen and heard: that blind see, lame walk,  lepers are cleansed, deaf hear, dead are raised, poor are  evangelized;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;and blessed is whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;And the messengers of John having departed, he began to  speak to the crowds concerning John: What went ye out into the  wilderness to behold? a reed shaken by the wind?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in delicate  garments? Behold, those who are in splendid clothing and live  luxuriously are in the courts of kings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say to you,  and [what is] more excellent than a prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;This is he concerning whom it is written, Behold, *I* send  my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before  thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;for I say unto you, Among them that are born of women a  greater [prophet] is no one than John [the baptist]; but he who  is a little one in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:29">7:29</A>&nbsp;(And all the people who heard [it], and the tax-gatherers,  justified God, having been baptised with the baptism of John;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:30">7:30</A>&nbsp;but the Pharisees and the lawyers rendered null as to  themselves the counsel of God, not having been baptised by  him.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:31">7:31</A>&nbsp;To whom therefore shall I liken the men of this generation,  and to whom are they like?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:32">7:32</A>&nbsp;They are like children sitting in the market-place, and  calling one to another and saying, We have piped to you, and ye  have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:33">7:33</A>&nbsp;For John the baptist has come neither eating bread nor  drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:34">7:34</A>&nbsp;The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and ye say,  Behold an eater and wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and  sinners;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:35">7:35</A>&nbsp;and wisdom has been justified of all her children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:36">7:36</A>&nbsp;But one of the Pharisees begged him that he would eat with  him. And entering into the house of the Pharisee he took his  place at table;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:37">7:37</A>&nbsp;and behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, and knew  that he was sitting at meat in the house of the Pharisee,  having taken an alabaster box of myrrh,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:38">7:38</A>&nbsp;and standing at his feet behind [him] weeping, began to  wash his feet with tears; and she wiped them with the hairs of  her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the  myrrh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:39">7:39</A>&nbsp;And the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spoke with  himself saying, This [person] if he were a prophet would have  known who and what the woman is who touches him, for she is a  sinner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:40">7:40</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to  say to thee. And he says, Teacher, say [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:41">7:41</A>&nbsp;There were two debtors of a certain creditor: one owed five  hundred denarii and the other fifty;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:42">7:42</A>&nbsp;but as they had nothing to pay, he forgave both of them  [their debt]: [say,] which of them therefore will love him  most?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:43">7:43</A>&nbsp;And Simon answering said, I suppose he to whom he forgave  the most. And he said to him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:44">7:44</A>&nbsp;And turning to the woman he said to Simon, Seest thou this  woman? I entered into thy house; thou gavest me not water on my  feet, but *she* has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them  with her hair.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:45">7:45</A>&nbsp;Thou gavest me not a kiss, but *she* from the time I came  in has not ceased kissing my feet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:46">7:46</A>&nbsp;My head with oil thou didst not anoint, but *she* has  anointed my feet with myrrh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:47">7:47</A>&nbsp;For which cause I say to thee, Her many sins are forgiven;  for she loved much; but he to whom little is forgiven loves  little.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:48">7:48</A>&nbsp;And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:49">7:49</A>&nbsp;And they that were with [them] at table began to say within  themselves, Who is this who forgives also sins?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:50">7:50</A>&nbsp;And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee; go in  peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass afterwards that *he* went through [the  country] city by city, and village by village, preaching and  announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the  twelve [were] with him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;and certain women who had been healed of wicked spirits and  infirmities, Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven  demons had gone out,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;and Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and  many others, who ministered to him of their substance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;And a great crowd coming together, and those who were coming  to him out of each city, he spoke by parable:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some  fell along the way, and it was trodden under foot, and the  birds of the heaven devoured it up;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;and other fell upon the rock, and having sprung up, it was  dried up because it had not moisture;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;and other fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns  having sprung up with [it] choked it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;and other fell into the good ground, and having sprung up  bore fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things he cried, He  that has ears to hear, let him hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;And his disciples asked him [saying], What may this parable  be?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of  the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, in order that  seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;But the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;But those by the wayside are those who hear; then comes the  devil and takes away the word from their heart that they may  not believe and be saved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;But those upon the rock, those who when they hear receive  the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a  time, and in time of trial fall away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;But that that fell where the thorns were, these are they  who having heard go away and are choked under cares and riches  and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;But that in the good ground, these are they who in an  honest and good heart, having heard the word keep it, and bring  forth fruit with patience.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;And no one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or  puts it under a couch, but sets it on a lamp-stand, that they  who enter in may see the light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;For there is nothing hid which shall not become manifest,  nor secret which shall not be known and come to light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;Take heed therefore how ye hear; for whosoever has, to him  shall be given, and whosoever has not, even what he seems to  have shall be taken from him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;And his mother and his brethren came to him, and could not  get to him because of the crowd.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;And it was told him [saying], Thy mother and thy brethren  stand without, wishing to see thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;But he answering said to them, My mother and my brethren  are those who hear the word of God and do [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on one of the days, that *he* entered  into a ship, himself and his disciples; and he said to them,  Let us pass over to the other side of the lake; and they set  off from shore.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:23">8:23</A>&nbsp;And as they sailed, he fell asleep; and a sudden squall of  wind came down on the lake, and they were filled [with water],  and were in danger;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;and coming to [him] they woke him up, saying, Master,  master, we perish. But he, rising up, rebuked the wind and the  raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Where is your faith? And, being  afraid, they were astonished, saying to one another, Who then  is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and  they obey him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;And they arrived in the country of the Gadarenes, which is  over against Galilee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;And as he got out [of the ship] on the land, a certain man  out of the city met him, who had demons a long time, and put on  no clothes, and did not abide in a house, but in the tombs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;But seeing Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him,  and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus  Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee torment me not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;For he had commanded the unclean spirit to go out from the  man. For very often it had seized him; and he had been bound,  kept with chains and fetters; and breaking the bonds he was  driven by the demon into the deserts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;And Jesus asked him saying, What is thy name? And he said,  Legion: for many demons had entered into him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;And they besought him that he would not command them to go  away into the bottomless pit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the  mountain, and they besought him that he would suffer them to  enter into those; and he suffered them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:33">8:33</A>&nbsp;And the demons, going out from the man, entered into the  swine, and the herd rushed down the precipice into the lake,  and were choked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:34">8:34</A>&nbsp;But they that fed [them], seeing what had happened, fled,  and told [it] to the city and to the country.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:35">8:35</A>&nbsp;And they went out to see what had happened, and came to  Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out,  sitting, clothed and sensible, at the feet of Jesus. And they  were afraid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:36">8:36</A>&nbsp;And they also who had seen it told them how the possessed  man had been healed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:37">8:37</A>&nbsp;And all the multitude of the surrounding country of the  Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were  possessed with great fear; and *he*, entering into the ship,  returned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:38">8:38</A>&nbsp;But the man out of whom the demons had gone besought him  that he might be with him. But he sent him away, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:39">8:39</A>&nbsp;Return to thine house and relate how great things God has  done for thee. And he went away through the whole city,  publishing how great things Jesus had done for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:40">8:40</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass when Jesus returned, the crowd received  him gladly, for they were all expecting him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:41">8:41</A>&nbsp;And behold, a man came, whose name was Jairus, and he was  [a] ruler of the synagogue, and falling at the feet of Jesus  besought him to come to his house,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:42">8:42</A>&nbsp;because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old,  and she was dying. And as he went the crowds thronged him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:43">8:43</A>&nbsp;And a woman who had a flux of blood since twelve years,  who, having spent all her living on physicians, could not be  cured by any one,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:44">8:44</A>&nbsp;coming up behind, touched the hem of his garment, and  immediately her flux of blood stopped.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:45">8:45</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, Who has touched me? But all denying, Peter  and those with him said, Master, the crowds close thee in and  press upon thee, and sayest thou, Who has touched me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:46">8:46</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, Some one has touched me, for *I* have known  that power has gone out from me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:47">8:47</A>&nbsp;And the woman, seeing that she was not hid, came trembling,  and falling down before him declared before all the people for  what cause she had touched him, and how she was immediately  healed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:48">8:48</A>&nbsp;And he said to her, [Be of good courage,] daughter; thy  faith has healed thee; go in peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:49">8:49</A>&nbsp;While he was yet speaking, comes some one from the ruler of  the synagogue, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; do not  trouble the teacher.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:50">8:50</A>&nbsp;But Jesus, hearing it, answered him saying, Fear not: only  believe, and she shall be made well.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:51">8:51</A>&nbsp;And when he came to the house he suffered no one to go in  but Peter and John and James and the father of the child and  the mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:52">8:52</A>&nbsp;And all were weeping and lamenting her. But he said, Do not  weep, for she has not died, but sleeps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:53">8:53</A>&nbsp;And they derided him, knowing that she had died.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:54">8:54</A>&nbsp;But *he*, having turned them all out and taking hold of her  hand, cried saying, Child, arise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:55">8:55</A>&nbsp;And her spirit returned, and immediately she rose up; and  he commanded [something] to eat to be given to her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:56">8:56</A>&nbsp;And her parents were amazed; but he enjoined them to tell  no one what had happened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And having called together the twelve, he gave them power  and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;and sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the  sick.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Take nothing for the way, neither  staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; nor to have two  body-coats apiece.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide and thence  go forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And as many as may not receive you, going forth from that  city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a witness  against them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;And going forth they passed through the villages, announcing  the glad tidings and healing everywhere.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things which were  done [by him], and was in perplexity, because it was said by  some that John was risen from among [the] dead,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;and by some that Elias had appeared, and by others that one  of the old prophets had risen again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And Herod said, John *I* have beheaded, but who is this of  whom I hear such things? and he sought to see him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And the apostles having returned related to him whatever  they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart into [a  desert place of] a city called Bethsaida.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;But the crowds knowing [it] followed him; and he received  them and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and cured those  that had need of healing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;But the day began to decline, and the twelve came and said  to him, Send away the crowd that they may go into the villages  around, and [into] the fields, and lodge and find victuals, for  here we are in a desert place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Give *ye them to eat. And they said,  We have not more than five loaves and two fishes, unless *we*  should go and buy food for all this people;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;for they were about five thousand men. And he said to his  disciples, Make them sit down in companies by fifties.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;And they did so, and made them all sit down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up  to heaven he blessed them, and broke and gave to the disciples  to set before the crowd.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;And they all ate and were filled; and there was taken up of  what had remained over and above to them in fragments twelve  hand-baskets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as he was praying alone, his disciples  were with him, and he asked them saying, Who do the crowds say  that I am?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;But they answering said, John the baptist; but others,  Elias; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen  again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, But *ye*, who do ye say that I am? And  Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;But, earnestly charging them, he enjoined [them] to say  this to no man,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be  rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be  killed, and the third day be raised up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;And he said to [them] all, If any one will come after me,  let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;for whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it,  but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, *he* shall save  it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;For what shall a man profit if he shall have gained the  whole world, and have destroyed, or come under the penalty of  the loss of himself?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;For whosoever shall have been ashamed of me and of my  words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he shall come  in his glory, and [in that] of the Father, and of the holy  angels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you of a truth, There are some of those  standing here who shall not taste death until they shall have  seen the kingdom of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after these words, about eight days,  that taking Peter and John and James he went up into a mountain  to pray.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became  different and his raiment white [and] effulgent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:30">9:30</A>&nbsp;And lo, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elias,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:31">9:31</A>&nbsp;who, appearing in glory, spoke of his departure which he  was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:32">9:32</A>&nbsp;But Peter and those with him were oppressed with sleep: but  having fully awoke up they saw his glory, and the two men who  stood with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:33">9:33</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as they departed from him, Peter said  to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make  three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for  Elias: not knowing what he said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:34">9:34</A>&nbsp;But as he was saying these things, there came a cloud and  overshadowed them, and they feared as they entered into the  cloud:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:35">9:35</A>&nbsp;and there was a voice out of the cloud saying, *This* is my  beloved Son: hear him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:36">9:36</A>&nbsp;And as the voice was [heard] Jesus was found alone: and  *they* kept silence, and told no one in those days any of the  things they had seen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:37">9:37</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the following day, when they came  down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:38">9:38</A>&nbsp;And lo, a man from the crowd cried out saying, Teacher, I  beseech thee look upon my son, for he is mine only child:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:39">9:39</A>&nbsp;and behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out,  and it tears him with foaming, and with difficulty departs from  him after crushing him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:40">9:40</A>&nbsp;And I besought thy disciples that they might cast him out,  and they could not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:41">9:41</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverted  generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring  hither thy son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:42">9:42</A>&nbsp;But as he was yet coming, the demon tore him and dragged  him all together. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and  healed the child and gave him back to his father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:43">9:43</A>&nbsp;And all were astonished at the glorious greatness of God.  And as all wondered at all the things which [Jesus] did, he  said to his disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:44">9:44</A>&nbsp;Do *ye* let these words sink into your ears. For the Son of  man is about to be delivered into men's hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:45">9:45</A>&nbsp;But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from  them that they should not perceive it. And they feared to ask  him concerning this saying.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:46">9:46</A>&nbsp;And a reasoning came in amongst them, who should be [the]  greatest of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:47">9:47</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, seeing the reasoning of their heart, having  taken a little child set it by him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:48">9:48</A>&nbsp;and said to them, Whosoever shall receive this little child  in my name receives me, and whosoever shall receive me receives  him that sent me. For he who is the least among you all, *he*  is great.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:49">9:49</A>&nbsp;And John answering said, Master, we saw some one casting  out demons in thy name, and we forbad him, because he follows  not with us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:50">9:50</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, Forbid [him] not, for he that is not  against you is for you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:51">9:51</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass when the days of his receiving up were  fulfilled, that *he* stedfastly set his face to go to  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:52">9:52</A>&nbsp;And he sent messengers before his face. And having gone  they entered into a village of the Samaritans that they might  make ready for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:53">9:53</A>&nbsp;And they did not receive him, because his face was [turned  as] going to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:54">9:54</A>&nbsp;And his disciples James and John seeing [it] said, Lord,  wilt thou that we speak [that] fire come down from heaven and  consume them, as also Elias did?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:55">9:55</A>&nbsp;But turning he rebuked them [and said, Ye know not of what  spirit ye are].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:56">9:56</A>&nbsp;And they went to another village.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:57">9:57</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as they went in the way, one said to  him, I will follow thee wheresoever thou goest, Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:58">9:58</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes and the birds  of the heaven roosting-places, but the Son of man has not where  he may lay his head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:59">9:59</A>&nbsp;And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow  me to go first and bury my father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:60">9:60</A>&nbsp;But Jesus said to him, Suffer the dead to bury their own  dead, but do *thou* go and announce the kingdom of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:61">9:61</A>&nbsp;And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord, but first  allow me to bid adieu to those at my house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:62">9:62</A>&nbsp;But Jesus said to him, No one having laid his hand on [the]  plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others  also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city  and place where he himself was about to come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, The harvest indeed [is] great, but the  workmen few; supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest that  he may send out workmen into his harvest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;Go: behold *I* send you forth as lambs in the midst of  wolves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;Carry neither purse nor scrip nor sandals, and salute no  one on the way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace to  this house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon  it; but if not it shall turn to you again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;And in the same house abide, eating and drinking such  things as they have; for the workman is worthy of his hire.  Remove not from house to house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;And into whatsoever city ye may enter and they receive you,  eat what is set before you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;and heal the sick in it, and say to them, The kingdom of  God is come nigh to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;But into whatsoever city ye may have entered and they do  not receive you, go out into its streets and say,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;Even the dust of your city, which cleaves to us on the  feet, do we shake off against you; but know this, that the  kingdom of God is come nigh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in  that day than for that city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the  works of power which have taken place in you had taken place in  Tyre and Sidon, they had long ago repented, sitting in  sackcloth and ashes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the  judgment than for you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;And *thou*, Capernaum, who hast been raised up to heaven,  shalt be brought down even to hades.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;He that hears you hears me; and he that rejects you  rejects me; and he that rejects me rejects him that sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the  demons are subject to us through thy name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, I beheld Satan as lightning falling  out of heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;Behold, I give you the power of treading upon serpents and  scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing  shall in anywise injure you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;Yet in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to  you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;In the same hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, I  praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that  thou hast hid these things from wise and prudent, and hast  revealed them to babes: yea, Father, for thus has it been  well-pleasing in thy sight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no  one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is  but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal  [him].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;And having turned to the disciples privately he said,  Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;For I say to you that many prophets and kings have desired  to see the things which ye behold, and did not see [them]; and  to hear the things which ye hear, and did not hear [them].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;And behold, a certain lawyer stood up tempting him, and  saying, Teacher, having done what, shall I inherit life  eternal?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:26">10:26</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, What is written in the law? how  readest thou?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:27">10:27</A>&nbsp;But he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God  with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy  strength, and with all thine understanding; and thy neighbour  as thyself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:28">10:28</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, Thou hast answered right: this do and  thou shalt live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:29">10:29</A>&nbsp;But he, desirous of justifying himself, said to Jesus, And  who is my neighbour?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:30">10:30</A>&nbsp;And Jesus replying said, A certain man descended from  Jerusalem to Jericho and fell into [the hands of] robbers, who  also, having stripped him and inflicted wounds, went away  leaving him in a half-dead state.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:31">10:31</A>&nbsp;And a certain priest happened to go down that way, and  seeing him, passed on on the opposite side;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:32">10:32</A>&nbsp;and in like manner also a Levite, being at the spot, came  and looked [at him] and passed on on the opposite side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:33">10:33</A>&nbsp;But a certain Samaritan journeying came to him, and seeing  [him], was moved with compassion,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:34">10:34</A>&nbsp;and came up [to him] and bound up his wounds, pouring in  oil and wine; and having put him on his own beast, took him to  [the] inn and took care of him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:35">10:35</A>&nbsp;And on the morrow [as he left], taking out two denarii he  gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take care of him,  and whatsoever thou shalt expend more, *I* will render to thee  on my coming back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:36">10:36</A>&nbsp;Which [now] of these three seems to thee to have been  neighbour of him who fell into [the hands of] the robbers?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:37">10:37</A>&nbsp;And he said, He that shewed him mercy. And Jesus said to  him, Go, and do *thou* likewise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:38">10:38</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as they went that *he* entered into a  certain village; and a certain woman, Martha by name, received  him into her house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:39">10:39</A>&nbsp;And she had a sister called Mary, who also, having sat  down at the feet of Jesus was listening to his word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:40">10:40</A>&nbsp;Now Martha was distracted with much serving, and coming up  she said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister has left me  to serve alone? Speak to her therefore that she may help me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:41">10:41</A>&nbsp;But Jesus answering said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art  careful and troubled about many things;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:42">10:42</A>&nbsp;but there is need of one, and Mary has chosen the good  part, the which shall not be taken from her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as he was in a certain place praying,  when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach  us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Father, thy name be  hallowed; thy kingdom come;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;give us our needed bread for each day;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;and remit us our sins, for we also remit to every one  indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Who among you shall have a friend, and  shall go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, let me have  three loaves,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;since a friend of mine on a journey is come to me, and I  have nothing to set before him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;and he within answering should say, Do not disturb me; the  door is already shut, and my children are with me in bed; I  cannot rise up to give [it] thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;-- I say to you, Although he will not get up and give  [them] to him because he is his friend, because of his  shamelessness, at any rate, he will rise and give him as many  as he wants.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;And *I* say to you, Ask, and it shall be given to you;  seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds;  and to him that knocks it will be opened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;But of whom of you that is a father shall a son ask bread,  and [the father] shall give him a stone? or also a fish, and  instead of a fish shall give him a serpent?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;or if also he shall ask an egg, shall give him a scorpion?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;If therefore *ye*, being evil, know how to give good gifts  to your children, how much rather shall the Father who is of  heaven give [the] Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb; and it  came to pass, the demon being gone out, the dumb [man] spoke.  And the crowds wondered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;But some from among them said, By Beelzebub the prince of  the demons casts he out demons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;And others tempting [him] sought from him a sign out of  heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;But *he*, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every  kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation: and a  house set against a house falls;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;and if also Satan is divided against himself, how shall  his kingdom subsist? because ye say that I cast out demons by  Beelzebub.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;But if *I* by Beelzebub cast out demons, your sons -- by  whom do they cast [them] out? For this reason *they* shall be  your judges.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;But if by the finger of God I cast out demons, then the  kingdom of God is come upon you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;When the strong [man] armed keeps his own house, his goods  are in peace;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;but when the stronger than he coming upon [him] overcomes  him, he takes away his panoply in which he trusted, and he will  divide the spoil [he has taken] from him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers  not with me scatters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;When the unclean spirit has gone out of the man, he goes  through dry places seeking rest; and not finding [any] he says,  I will return to my house whence I came out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;And having come, he finds it swept and adorned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:26">11:26</A>&nbsp;Then he goes and takes seven other spirits worse than  himself, and entering in, they dwell there; and the last  condition of that man becomes worse than the first.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:27">11:27</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as he spake these things, a certain  woman, lifting up her voice out of the crowd, said to him,  Blessed is the womb that has borne thee, and the paps which  thou hast sucked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:28">11:28</A>&nbsp;But *he* said, Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the  word of God and keep [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:29">11:29</A>&nbsp;But as the crowds thronged together, he began to say, This  generation is a wicked generation: it seeks a sign, and a sign  shall not be given to it but the sign of Jonas.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:30">11:30</A>&nbsp;For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, thus shall also  the Son of man be to this generation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:31">11:31</A>&nbsp;A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with  the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she  came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;  and behold, more than Solomon is here.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:32">11:32</A>&nbsp;Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this  generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the  preaching of Jonas; and behold, more than Jonas is here.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:33">11:33</A>&nbsp;But no one having lit a lamp sets it in secret, nor under  the corn-measure, but on the lamp-stand, that they who enter in  may see the light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:34">11:34</A>&nbsp;The lamp of the body is thine eye: when thine eye is  simple, thy whole body also is light; but when it is wicked,  thy body also is dark.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:35">11:35</A>&nbsp;See therefore that the light which is in thee be not  darkness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:36">11:36</A>&nbsp;If therefore thy whole body [is] light, not having any  part dark, it shall be all light as when the lamp lights thee  with its brightness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:37">11:37</A>&nbsp;But as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him that he  would dine with him; and entering in he placed himself at  table.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:38">11:38</A>&nbsp;But the Pharisee seeing [it] wondered that he had not  first washed before dinner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:39">11:39</A>&nbsp;But the Lord said to him, Now do ye Pharisees cleanse the  outside of the cup and of the dish, but your inward [parts] are  full of plunder and wickedness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:40">11:40</A>&nbsp;Fools, has not he who has made the outside made the inside  also?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:41">11:41</A>&nbsp;But rather give alms of what ye have, and behold, all  things are clean to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:42">11:42</A>&nbsp;But woe unto you, Pharisees, for ye pay tithes of mint and  rue and every herb, and pass by the judgment and the love of  God: these ye ought to have done, and not have left those  aside.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:43">11:43</A>&nbsp;Woe unto you, Pharisees, for ye love the first seat in the  synagogues and salutations in the market-places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:44">11:44</A>&nbsp;Woe unto you, for ye are as the sepulchres which appear  not, and the men walking over them do not know [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:45">11:45</A>&nbsp;And one of the doctors of the law answering says to him,  Teacher, in saying these things thou insultest us also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:46">11:46</A>&nbsp;And he said, To you also woe, doctors of the law, for ye  lay upon men burdens heavy to bear, and yourselves do not touch  the burdens with one of your fingers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:47">11:47</A>&nbsp;Woe unto you, for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets,  but your fathers killed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:48">11:48</A>&nbsp;Ye bear witness then, and consent to the works of your  fathers; for *they* killed them, and *ye* build [their  sepulchres].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:49">11:49</A>&nbsp;For this reason also the wisdom of God has said, I will  send to them prophets and apostles, and of these shall they  kill and drive out by persecution,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:50">11:50</A>&nbsp;that the blood of all the prophets which has been poured  out from the foundation of the world may be required of this  generation,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:51">11:51</A>&nbsp;from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias, who  perished between the altar and the house; yea, I say to you, it  shall be required of this generation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:52">11:52</A>&nbsp;Woe unto you, the doctors of the law, for ye have taken  away the key of knowledge; yourselves have not entered in, and  those who were entering in ye have hindered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:53">11:53</A>&nbsp;And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the  Pharisees began to press him urgently, and to make him speak of  many things;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:54">11:54</A>&nbsp;watching him, [and seeking] to catch something out of his  mouth, [that they might accuse him].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;In those [times], the myriads of the crowd being gathered  together, so that they trod one on another, he began to say to  his disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees,  which is hypocrisy;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;but there is nothing covered up which shall not be  revealed, nor secret that shall not be known;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;therefore whatever ye have said in the darkness shall be  heard in the light, and what ye have spoken in the ear in  chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;But I say to you, my friends, Fear not those who kill the  body and after this have no more that they can do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;But I will shew you whom ye shall fear: Fear him who after  he has killed has authority to cast into hell; yea, I say to  you, Fear *him*.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? and one of them  is not forgotten before God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not  therefore, ye are better than many sparrows.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;But I say to you, Whosoever shall confess me before men,  the Son of man will confess him also before the angels of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;but he that shall have denied me before men shall be denied  before the angels of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;and whoever shall say a word against the Son of man it  shall be forgiven him; but to him that speaks injuriously  against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;But when they bring you before the synagogues and rulers  and the authorities, be not careful how or what ye shall  answer, or what ye shall say;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself  what should be said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;And a person said to him out of the crowd, Teacher, speak  to my brother to divide the inheritance with me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;But he said to him, Man, who established me [as] a judge  or a divider over you?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Take heed and keep yourselves from  all covetousness, for [it is] not because a man is in abundance  [that] his life is in his possessions.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The land of a  certain rich man brought forth abundantly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;And he reasoned within himself saying, What shall I do?  for I have not [a place] where I shall lay up my fruits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;And he said, This will I do: I will take away my granaries  and build greater, and there I will lay up all my produce and  my good things;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;and I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much good  things laid by for many years; repose thyself, eat, drink, be  merry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;But God said to him, Fool, this night thy soul shall be  required of thee; and whose shall be what thou hast prepared?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;Thus is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not  rich toward God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;And he said to his disciples, For this cause I say unto  you, Be not careful for life, what ye shall eat, nor for the  body, what ye shall put on.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;The life is more than food, and the body than raiment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:24">12:24</A>&nbsp;Consider the ravens, that they sow not nor reap; which  have neither storehouse nor granary; and God feeds them. How  much better are *ye* than the birds?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:25">12:25</A>&nbsp;But which of you by being careful can add to his stature  one cubit?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:26">12:26</A>&nbsp;If therefore ye cannot [do] even what is least, why are ye  careful about the rest?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:27">12:27</A>&nbsp;Consider the lilies how they grow: they neither toil nor  spin; but I say unto you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was  clothed as one of these.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:28">12:28</A>&nbsp;But if God thus clothe the grass, which to-day is in the  field and to-morrow is cast into [the] oven, how much rather  you, O ye of little faith?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:29">12:29</A>&nbsp;And *ye*, seek not what ye shall eat or what ye shall  drink, and be not in anxiety;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:30">12:30</A>&nbsp;for all these things do the nations of the world seek  after, and your Father knows that ye have need of these things;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:31">12:31</A>&nbsp;but seek his kingdom, and [all] these things shall be  added to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:32">12:32</A>&nbsp;Fear not, little flock, for it has been the good pleasure  of your Father to give you the kingdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:33">12:33</A>&nbsp;Sell what ye possess and give alms; make to yourselves  purses which do not grow old, a treasure which does not fail in  the heavens, where thief does not draw near nor moth destroy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:34">12:34</A>&nbsp;For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:35">12:35</A>&nbsp;Let your loins be girded about, and lamps burning;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:36">12:36</A>&nbsp;and *ye* like men who wait their own lord whenever he may  leave the wedding, that when he comes and knocks, they may open  to him immediately.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:37">12:37</A>&nbsp;Blessed are those bondmen whom the lord [on] coming shall  find watching; verily I say unto you, that he will gird himself  and make them recline at table, and coming up will serve them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:38">12:38</A>&nbsp;And if he come in the second watch, and come in the third  watch, and find [them] thus, blessed are those [bondmen].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:39">12:39</A>&nbsp;But this know, that if the master of the house had known  in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and  not have suffered his house to be dug through.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:40">12:40</A>&nbsp;And ye therefore, be *ye* ready, for in the hour in which  ye do not think [it], the Son of man comes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:41">12:41</A>&nbsp;And Peter said to him, Lord, sayest thou this parable to  us, or also to all?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:42">12:42</A>&nbsp;And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and prudent  steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give the  measure of corn in season?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:43">12:43</A>&nbsp;Blessed is that bondman whom his lord [on] coming shall  find doing thus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:44">12:44</A>&nbsp;verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all that  he has.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:45">12:45</A>&nbsp;But if that bondman should say in his heart, My lord  delays to come, and begin to beat the menservants and the  maidservants, and to eat and to drink and to be drunken,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:46">12:46</A>&nbsp;the lord of that bondman shall come in a day when he does  not expect it, and in an hour he knows not of, and shall cut  him in two and appoint his portion with the unbelievers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:47">12:47</A>&nbsp;But that bondman who knew his own lord's will, and had not  prepared [himself] nor done his will, shall be beaten with many  [stripes];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:48">12:48</A>&nbsp;but he who knew [it] not, and did things worthy of  stripes, shall be beaten with few. And to every one to whom  much has been given, much shall be required from him; and to  whom [men] have committed much, they will ask from him the  more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:49">12:49</A>&nbsp;I have come to cast a fire on the earth; and what will I  if already it has been kindled?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:50">12:50</A>&nbsp;But I have a baptism to be baptised with, and how am I  straitened until it shall have been accomplished!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:51">12:51</A>&nbsp;Think ye that I have come to give peace in the earth? Nay,  I say to you, but rather division:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:52">12:52</A>&nbsp;for from henceforth there shall be five in one house  divided; three shall be divided against two, and two against  three:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:53">12:53</A>&nbsp;father against son, and son against father; mother against  daughter, and daughter against mother; a mother-in-law against  her daughter-in-law, and a daughter-in-law against her  mother-in-law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:54">12:54</A>&nbsp;And he said also to the crowds, When ye see a cloud rising  out of the west, straightway ye say, A shower is coming; and so  it happens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:55">12:55</A>&nbsp;And when [ye see] the south wind blow, ye say, There will  be heat; and it happens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:56">12:56</A>&nbsp;Hypocrites, ye know how to judge of the appearance of the  earth and of the heaven; how [is it then that] ye do not  discern this time?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:57">12:57</A>&nbsp;And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:58">12:58</A>&nbsp;For as thou goest with thine adverse party before a  magistrate, strive in the way to be reconciled with him, lest  he drag thee away to the judge, and the judge shall deliver  thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:59">12:59</A>&nbsp;I say unto thee, Thou shalt in no wise come out thence  until thou hast paid the very last mite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;Now at the same time there were present some who told him  of the Galileans whose blood Pilate mingled with [that of]  their sacrifices.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to them, Think ye that these  Galileans were sinners beyond all the Galileans because they  suffered such things?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;No, I say to you, but if ye repent not, ye shall all perish  in the same manner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and  killed them, think ye that *they* were debtors beyond all the  men who dwell in Jerusalem?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;No, I say to you, but if ye repent not, ye shall all perish  in like manner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;And he spoke this parable: A certain [man] had a fig-tree  planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit upon it and  did not find [any].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;And he said to the vinedresser, Behold, [these] three years  I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree and find none: cut it  down; why does it also render the ground useless?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;But he answering says to him, Sir, let it alone for this  year also, until I shall dig about it and put dung,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;and if it shall bear fruit -- but if not, after that thou  shalt cut it down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the  sabbath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;And lo, [there was] a woman having a spirit of infirmity  eighteen years, and she was bent together and wholly unable to  lift her head up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, seeing her, called to [her], and said to her,  Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;And he laid his hands upon her; and immediately she was  made straight, and glorified God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus  healed on the sabbath, answering said to the crowd, There are  six days in which [people] ought to work; in these therefore  come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;The Lord therefore answered him and said, Hypocrites! does  not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from  the manger and leading [it] away, water [it]?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;And this [woman], who is a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan  has bound, lo, [these] eighteen years, ought she not to be  loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;And as he said these things, all who were opposed to him  were ashamed; and all the crowd rejoiced at all the glorious  things which were being done by him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;And he said, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to  what shall I liken it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:19">13:19</A>&nbsp;It is like a grain of mustard [seed] which a man took and  cast into his garden; and it grew and became a great tree, and  the birds of heaven lodged in its branches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:20">13:20</A>&nbsp;And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of  God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three  measures of meal until the whole was leavened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;And he went through one city and village after another,  teaching, and journeying to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;And one said to him, Sir, [are] such as are to be saved  few in number? But he said unto them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:24">13:24</A>&nbsp;Strive with earnestness to enter in through the narrow  door, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in and will  not be able.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:25">13:25</A>&nbsp;From the time that the master of the house shall have  risen up and shall have shut the door, and ye shall begin to  stand without and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to  us; and he answering shall say to you, I know you not whence ye  are:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:26">13:26</A>&nbsp;then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten in thy presence  and drunk, and thou hast taught in our streets;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:27">13:27</A>&nbsp;and he shall say, I tell you, I do not know you whence ye  are; depart from me, all [ye] workers of iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:28">13:28</A>&nbsp;There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when  ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets  in the kingdom of God, but yourselves cast out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:29">13:29</A>&nbsp;And they shall come from east and west, and from north and  south, and shall lie down at table in the kingdom of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:30">13:30</A>&nbsp;And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there  are first who shall be last.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:31">13:31</A>&nbsp;The same hour certain Pharisees came up, saying to him,  Get out, and go hence, for Herod is desirous to kill thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:32">13:32</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out  demons and accomplish cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third  [day] I am perfected;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:33">13:33</A>&nbsp;but I must needs walk to-day and to-morrow and the [day]  following, for it must not be that a prophet perish out of  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:34">13:34</A>&nbsp;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the [city] that kills the prophets  and stones those that are sent unto her, how often would I have  gathered thy children together, as a hen her brood under her  wings, and ye would not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:35">13:35</A>&nbsp;Behold, your house is left unto you; and I say unto you,  that ye shall not see me until it come that ye say, Blessed  [is] he that comes in the name of [the] Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of  the rulers, [who was] of the Pharisees, to eat bread on [the]  sabbath, that *they* were watching him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;And behold, there was a certain dropsical [man] before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering spoke unto the doctors of the law and  Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;But they were silent. And taking him he healed him and let  him go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;And answering he said to them, Of which of you shall an ass  or ox fall into a well, that he does not straightway pull him  up on the sabbath day?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;And they were not able to answer him to these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;And he spoke a parable to those that were invited,  remarking how they chose out the first places, saying to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;When thou art invited by any one to a wedding, do not lay  thyself down in the first place at table, lest perhaps a more  honourable than thou be invited by him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;and he who invited thee and him come and say to thee, Give  place to this [man], and then thou begin with shame to take the  last place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;But when thou hast been invited, go and put thyself down  in the last place, that when he who has invited thee comes, he  may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have  honour before all that are lying at table with thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;for every one that exalts himself shall be abased, and he  that abases himself shall be exalted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;And he said also to him that had invited him, When thou  makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy  brethren, nor thy kinsfolk, nor rich neighbours, lest it may be  they also should invite thee in return, and a recompense be  made thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;But when thou makest a feast, call poor, crippled, lame,  blind:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;and thou shalt be blessed; for they have not [the means]  to recompense thee; for it shall be recompensed thee in the  resurrection of the just.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;And one of those that were lying at table with [them],  hearing these things, said to him, Blessed [is] he who shall  eat bread in the kingdom of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper and  invited many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;And he sent his bondman at the hour of supper to say to  those who were invited, Come, for already all things are ready.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:18">14:18</A>&nbsp;And all began, without exception, to excuse themselves.  The first said to him, I have bought land, and I must go out  and see it; I pray thee hold me for excused.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:19">14:19</A>&nbsp;And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I  go to prove them; I pray thee hold me for excused.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;And another said, I have married a wife, and on this  account I cannot come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:21">14:21</A>&nbsp;And the bondman came up and brought back word of these  things to his lord. Then the master of the house, in anger,  said to his bondman, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes  of the city, and bring here the poor and crippled and lame and  blind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:22">14:22</A>&nbsp;And the bondman said, Sir, it is done as thou hast  commanded, and there is still room.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:23">14:23</A>&nbsp;And the lord said to the bondman, Go out into the ways and  fences and compel to come in, that my house may be filled;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:24">14:24</A>&nbsp;for I say to you, that not one of those men who were  invited shall taste of my supper.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:25">14:25</A>&nbsp;And great crowds went with him; and, turning round, he  said to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:26">14:26</A>&nbsp;If any man come to me, and shall not hate his own father  and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters,  yea, and his own life too, he cannot be my disciple;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:27">14:27</A>&nbsp;and whoever does not carry his cross and come after me  cannot be my disciple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:28">14:28</A>&nbsp;For which of you, desirous of building a tower, does not  first sit down and count the cost, if he have what [is needed]  to complete it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:29">14:29</A>&nbsp;in order that, having laid the foundation of it, and not  being able to finish it, all who see it do not begin to mock at  him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:30">14:30</A>&nbsp;saying, This man began to build and was not able to  finish?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:31">14:31</A>&nbsp;Or what king, going on his way to engage in war with  another king, does not, sitting down first, take counsel  whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him coming against  him with twenty thousand?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:32">14:32</A>&nbsp;and if not, while he is yet far off, having sent an  embassy, he asks for terms of peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:33">14:33</A>&nbsp;Thus then every one of you who forsakes not all that is  his own cannot be my disciple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:34">14:34</A>&nbsp;Salt [then] [is] good, but if the salt also has become  savourless, wherewith shall it be seasoned?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:35">14:35</A>&nbsp;It is proper neither for land nor for dung; it is cast  out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;And all the tax-gatherers and the sinners were coming near  to him to hear him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This  [man] receives sinners and eats with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;And he spoke to them this parable, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;What man of you having a hundred sheep, and having lost one  of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness  and go after that which is lost, until he find it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;and having found it, he lays it upon his own shoulders,  rejoicing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;and being come to the house, calls together the friends and  the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have  found my lost sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;I say unto you, that thus there shall be joy in heaven for  one repenting sinner, [more] than for ninety and nine righteous  who have no need of repentance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;Or, what woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one  drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek  carefully till she find it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;and having found it she calls together the friends and  neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the  drachma which I had lost.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;Thus, I say unto you, there is joy before the angels of  God for one repenting sinner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;And he said, A certain man had two sons;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give  to me the share of the property that falls [to me]. And he  divided to them what he was possessed of.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;And after not many days the younger son gathering all  together went away into a country a long way off, and there  dissipated his property, living in debauchery.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;But when he had spent all there arose a violent famine  throughout that country, and he began to be in want.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of  that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:16">15:16</A>&nbsp;And he longed to fill his belly with the husks which the  swine were eating; and no one gave to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;And coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of  my father's have abundance of bread, and *I* perish here by  famine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:18">15:18</A>&nbsp;I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him,  Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;I am no longer worthy to be called thy son: make me as one  of thy hired servants.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;And he rose up and went to his own father. But while he  was yet a long way off, his father saw him, and was moved with  compassion, and ran, and fell upon his neck, and covered him  with kisses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:21">15:21</A>&nbsp;And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against  heaven and before thee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy  son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;But the father said to his bondmen, Bring out the best  robe and clothe him in [it], and put a ring on his hand and  sandals on his feet;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;and bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and  make merry:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;for this my son was dead and has come to life, was lost  and has been found. And they began to make merry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;And his elder son was in the field; and as, coming [up],  he drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;And having called one of the servants, he inquired what  these things might be.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, Thy brother is come, and thy father  has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and  well.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:28">15:28</A>&nbsp;But he became angry and would not go in. And his father  went out and besought him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:29">15:29</A>&nbsp;But he answering said to his father, Behold, so many years  I serve thee, and never have I transgressed a commandment of  thine; and to me hast thou never given a kid that I might make  merry with my friends:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:30">15:30</A>&nbsp;but when this thy son, who has devoured thy substance with  harlots, is come, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:31">15:31</A>&nbsp;But he said to him, Child, *thou* art ever with me, and  all that is mine is thine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:32">15:32</A>&nbsp;But it was right to make merry and rejoice, because this  thy brother was dead and has come to life again, and was lost  and has been found.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;And he said also to [his] disciples, There was a certain  rich man who had a steward, and *he* was accused to him as  wasting his goods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;And having called him, he said to him, What [is] this that  I hear of thee? give the reckoning of thy stewardship, for thou  canst be no longer steward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;And the steward said within himself, What shall I do; for  my lord is taking the stewardship from me? I am not able to  dig; I am ashamed to beg.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;I know what I will do, that when I shall have been removed  from the stewardship I may be received into their houses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;And having called to [him] each one of the debtors of his  own lord, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;And he said, A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him,  Take thy writing and sit down quickly and write fifty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;Then he said to another, And thou, how much dost thou owe?  And he said, A hundred cors of wheat. And he says to him, Take  thy writing and write eighty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;And the lord praised the unrighteous steward because he had  done prudently. For the sons of this world are, for their own  generation, more prudent than the sons of light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;And *I* say to you, Make to yourselves friends with the  mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails ye may be  received into the eternal tabernacles.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;He that is faithful in the least is faithful also in much;  and he that is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in  much.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous  mammon, who shall entrust to you the true?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;and if ye have not been faithful in that which is  another's, who shall give to you your own?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate  the one and will love the other, or he will cleave to the one  and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these  things, and mocked him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, *Ye* are they who justify themselves  before men, but God knows your hearts; for what amongst men is  highly thought of is an abomination before God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;The law and the prophets [were] until John: from that time  the glad tidings of the kingdom of God are announced, and every  one forces his way into it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;But it is easier that the heaven and the earth should pass  away than that one tittle of the law should fail.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;Every one who puts away his wife and marries another  commits adultery; and every one that marries one put away from  a husband commits adultery.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;Now there was a rich man and he was clothed in purple and  fine linen, making good cheer in splendour every day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;And [there was] a poor man, by name Lazarus, [who] was  laid at his gateway full of sores,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:21">16:21</A>&nbsp;and desiring to be filled with the crumbs which fell from  the table of the rich man; but the dogs also coming licked his  sores.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:22">16:22</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass that the poor man died, and that he  was carried away by the angels into the bosom of Abraham. And  the rich man also died and was buried.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:23">16:23</A>&nbsp;And in hades lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he  sees Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:24">16:24</A>&nbsp;And he crying out said, Father Abraham, have compassion on  me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in  water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering in this flame.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:25">16:25</A>&nbsp;But Abraham said, Child, recollect that *thou* hast fully  received thy good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazarus  evil things. But now he is comforted here, and *thou* art in  suffering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:26">16:26</A>&nbsp;And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm is  fixed, so that those who desire to pass hence to you cannot,  nor do they who [desire to cross] from there pass over unto us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:27">16:27</A>&nbsp;And he said, I beseech thee then, father, that thou  wouldest send him to the house of my father,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:28">16:28</A>&nbsp;for I have five brothers, so that he may earnestly testify  to them, that they also may not come to this place of torment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:29">16:29</A>&nbsp;But Abraham says to him, They have Moses and the prophets:  let them hear them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:30">16:30</A>&nbsp;But he said, Nay, father Abraham, but if one from the dead  should go to them, they will repent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:31">16:31</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the  prophets, not even if one rise from among [the] dead will they  be persuaded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;And he said to his disciples, It cannot be but that  offences come, but woe [to him] by whom they come!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;It would be [more] profitable for him if a millstone were  hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea, than that he  should be a snare to one of these little ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother should sin, rebuke  him; and if he should repent, forgive him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;And if he should sin against thee seven times in the day,  and seven times should return to thee, saying, I repent, thou  shalt forgive him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;And the apostles said to the Lord, Give more faith to us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;But the Lord said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard  [seed], ye had said to this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up,  and be thou planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;But which of you [is there] who, having a bondman ploughing  or shepherding, when he comes in out of the field, will say,  Come and lie down immediately to table?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;But will he not say to him, Prepare what I shall sup on,  and gird thyself and serve me that I may eat and drink; and  after that *thou* shalt eat and drink?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;Is he thankful to the bondman because he has done what was  ordered? I judge not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;Thus *ye* also, when ye shall have done all things that  have been ordered you, say, We are unprofitable bondmen; we  have done what it was our duty to do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as he was going up to Jerusalem, that  he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;And as he entered into a certain village ten leprous men  met him, who stood afar off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;And they lifted up [their] voice saying, Jesus, Master,  have compassion on us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;And seeing [them] he said to them, Go, shew yourselves to  the priests. And it came to pass as they were going they were  cleansed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:15">17:15</A>&nbsp;And one of them, seeing that he was cured, turned back,  glorifying God with a loud voice,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:16">17:16</A>&nbsp;and fell on [his] face at his feet giving him thanks: and  *he* was a Samaritan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:17">17:17</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but  the nine, where [are they]?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:18">17:18</A>&nbsp;There have not been found to return and give glory to God  save this stranger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:19">17:19</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, Rise up and go thy way: thy faith has  made thee well.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:20">17:20</A>&nbsp;And having been asked by the Pharisees, When is the  kingdom of God coming? he answered them and said, The kingdom  of God does not come with observation;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:21">17:21</A>&nbsp;nor shall they say, Lo here, or, Lo there; for behold, the  kingdom of God is in the midst of you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:22">17:22</A>&nbsp;And he said to the disciples, Days are coming, when ye  shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and  shall not see [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:23">17:23</A>&nbsp;And they will say to you, Lo here, or Lo there; go not,  nor follow [them].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:24">17:24</A>&nbsp;For as the lightning shines which lightens from [one end]  under heaven to [the other end] under heaven, thus shall the  Son of man be in his day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:25">17:25</A>&nbsp;But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of  this generation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:26">17:26</A>&nbsp;And as it took place in the days of Noe, thus also shall  it be in the days of the Son of man:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:27">17:27</A>&nbsp;they ate, they drank, they married, they were given in  marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the  flood came and destroyed all [of them];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:28">17:28</A>&nbsp;and in like manner as took place in the days of Lot: they  ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they  builded;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:29">17:29</A>&nbsp;but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained  fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed all [of them]:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:30">17:30</A>&nbsp;after this [manner] shall it be in the day that the Son of  man is revealed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:31">17:31</A>&nbsp;In that day, he who shall be on the housetop, and his  stuff in the house, let him not go down to take it away; and he  that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:32">17:32</A>&nbsp;Remember the wife of Lot.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:33">17:33</A>&nbsp;Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it, and  whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:34">17:34</A>&nbsp;I say to you, In that night there shall be two [men] upon  one bed; one shall be seized and the other shall be let go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:35">17:35</A>&nbsp;Two [women] shall be grinding together; the one shall be  seized and the other shall be let go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:36">17:36</A>&nbsp;[Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be seized  and the other let go.]</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:37">17:37</A>&nbsp;And answering they say to him, Where, Lord? And he said to  them, Where the body [is], there the eagles will be gathered  together.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;And he spoke also a parable to them to the purport that  they should always pray and not faint,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;saying, There was a judge in a city, not fearing God and  not respecting man:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;and there was a widow in that city, and she came to him,  saying, Avenge me of mine adverse party.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;And he would not for a time; but afterwards he said within  himself, If even I fear not God and respect not man,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;at any rate because this widow annoys me I will avenge her,  that she may not by perpetually coming completely harass me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;And shall not God at all avenge his elect, who cry to him  day and night, and he bears long as to them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;I say unto you that he will avenge them speedily. But when  the Son of man comes, shall he indeed find faith on the earth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;And he spoke also to some, who trusted in themselves that  they were righteous and made nothing of all the rest [of men],  this parable:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a  Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;The Pharisee, standing, prayed thus to himself: God, I  thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust,  adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;I fast twice in the week, I tithe everything I gain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;And the tax-gatherer, standing afar off, would not lift up  even his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, O  God, have compassion on me, the sinner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;I say unto you, This [man] went down to his house  justified rather than that [other]. For every one who exalts  himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be  exalted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;And they brought to him also infants that he might touch  them, but the disciples when they saw [it] rebuked them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;But Jesus calling them to [him] said, Suffer little  children to come to me, and do not forbid them, for of such is  the kingdom of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the  kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter  therein.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:18">18:18</A>&nbsp;And a certain ruler asked him saying, Good teacher, having  done what, shall I inherit eternal life?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:19">18:19</A>&nbsp;But Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? There is  none good but one, God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:20">18:20</A>&nbsp;Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do  not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy  father and thy mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:21">18:21</A>&nbsp;And he said, All these things have I kept from my youth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:22">18:22</A>&nbsp;And when Jesus had heard this, he said to him, One thing  is lacking to thee yet: Sell all that thou hast and distribute  to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens, and  come, follow me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:23">18:23</A>&nbsp;But when he heard this he became very sorrowful, for he  was very rich.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:24">18:24</A>&nbsp;But when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, he said,  How difficultly shall those who have riches enter into the  kingdom of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:25">18:25</A>&nbsp;for it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle's  eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:26">18:26</A>&nbsp;And those who heard it said, And who can be saved?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:27">18:27</A>&nbsp;But he said, The things that are impossible with men are  possible with God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:28">18:28</A>&nbsp;And Peter said, Behold, *we* have left all things and have  followed thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:29">18:29</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Verily I say to you, There is no one  who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or  children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:30">18:30</A>&nbsp;who shall not receive manifold more at this time, and in  the coming age life eternal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:31">18:31</A>&nbsp;And he took the twelve to [him] and said to them, Behold,  we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written of the  Son of man by the prophets shall be accomplished;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:32">18:32</A>&nbsp;for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be  mocked, and insulted, and spit upon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:33">18:33</A>&nbsp;And when they have scourged [him] they will kill him; and  on the third day he will rise again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:34">18:34</A>&nbsp;And they understood nothing of these things. And this word  was hidden from them, and they did not know what was said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:35">18:35</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass when he came into the neighbourhood of  Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:36">18:36</A>&nbsp;And when he heard the crowd passing, he inquired what this  might be.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:37">18:37</A>&nbsp;And they told him that Jesus the Nazaraean was passing by.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:38">18:38</A>&nbsp;And he called out saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy  on me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:39">18:39</A>&nbsp;And those [who were] going before rebuked him that he  might be silent; but *he* cried out so much the more, Son of  David, have mercy on me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:40">18:40</A>&nbsp;And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be led to him.  And when he drew nigh he asked him [saying],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:41">18:41</A>&nbsp;What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord,  that I may see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:42">18:42</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, See: thy faith has healed thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:43">18:43</A>&nbsp;And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God.  And all the people when they saw [it] gave praise to God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;And he entered and passed through Jericho.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;And behold, [there was] a man by name called Zacchaeus, and  he was chief tax-gatherer, and he was rich.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;And he sought to see Jesus who he was: and he could not for  the crowd, because he was little in stature.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;And running on before, he got up into a sycamore that he  might see him, for he was going to pass that [way].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;And when he came up to the place, Jesus looked up and saw  him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for  to-day I must remain in thy house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;And he made haste and came down, and received him with joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;And all murmured when they saw [it], saying, He has turned  in to lodge with a sinful man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the  half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken  anything from any man by false accusation, I return [him]  fourfold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, To-day salvation is come to this  house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which  is lost.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;But as they were listening to these things, he added and  spake a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem and they  thought that the kingdom of God was about to be immediately  manifested.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;He said therefore, A certain high-born man went to a  distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and return.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;And having called his own ten bondmen, he gave to them ten  minas, and said to them, Trade while I am coming.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him,  saying, We will not that this [man] should reign over us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on his arrival back again, having  received the kingdom, that he desired these bondmen to whom he  gave the money to be called to him, in order that he might know  what every one had gained by trading.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;And the first came up, saying, [My] Lord, thy mina has  produced ten minas.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, Well [done], thou good bondman;  because thou hast been faithful in that which is least, be thou  in authority over ten cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;And the second came, saying, [My] Lord, thy mina has made  five minas.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;And he said also to this one, And *thou*, be over five  cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:20">19:20</A>&nbsp;And another came, saying, [My] Lord, lo, [there is] thy  mina, which I have kept laid up in a towel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:21">19:21</A>&nbsp;For I feared thee because thou art a harsh man: thou  takest up what thou hast not laid down, and thou reapest what  thou hast not sowed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:22">19:22</A>&nbsp;He says to him, Out of thy mouth will I judge thee, wicked  bondman: thou knewest that *I* am a harsh man, taking up what I  have not laid down and reaping what I have not sowed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:23">19:23</A>&nbsp;And why didst thou not give my money to [the] bank; and  *I* should have received it, at my coming, with interest?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:24">19:24</A>&nbsp;And he said to those that stood by, Take from him the mina  and give [it] to him who has the ten minas.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:25">19:25</A>&nbsp;And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:26">19:26</A>&nbsp;For I say unto you, that to every one that has shall be  given; but from him that has not, that even which he has shall  be taken from him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:27">19:27</A>&nbsp;Moreover those mine enemies, who would not [have] me to  reign over them, bring them here and slay [them] before me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:28">19:28</A>&nbsp;And having said these things, he went on before, going up  to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:29">19:29</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as he drew near to Bethphage and  Bethany at the mountain called [the mount] of Olives, he sent  two of his disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:30">19:30</A>&nbsp;saying, Go into the village over against [you], in which  ye will find, on entering it, a colt tied up, on which no  [child] of man ever sat at any time: loose it and lead it  [here].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:31">19:31</A>&nbsp;And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose [it]? thus shall  ye say to him, Because the Lord has need of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:32">19:32</A>&nbsp;And they that were sent, having gone their way, found as  he had said to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:33">19:33</A>&nbsp;And as they were loosing the colt, its masters said to  them, Why loose ye the colt?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:34">19:34</A>&nbsp;And they said, Because the Lord has need of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:35">19:35</A>&nbsp;And they led it to Jesus; and having cast their own  garments on the colt, they put Jesus on [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:36">19:36</A>&nbsp;And as he went, they strewed their clothes in the way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:37">19:37</A>&nbsp;And as he drew near, already at the descent of the mount  of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began, rejoicing,  to praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power  which they had seen,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:38">19:38</A>&nbsp;saying, Blessed the King that comes in the name of [the]  Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:39">19:39</A>&nbsp;And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him,  Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:40">19:40</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to them, I say unto you, If these  shall be silent, the stones will cry out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:41">19:41</A>&nbsp;And as he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:42">19:42</A>&nbsp;saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, even at least in  this thy day, the things that are for thy peace: but now they  are hid from thine eyes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:43">19:43</A>&nbsp;for days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall  make a palisaded mound about thee, and shall close thee around,  and keep thee in on every side,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:44">19:44</A>&nbsp;and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children  in thee; and shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone:  because thou knewest not the season of thy visitation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:45">19:45</A>&nbsp;And entering into the temple, he began to cast out those  that sold and bought in it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:46">19:46</A>&nbsp;saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of  prayer, but *ye* have made it a den of robbers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:47">19:47</A>&nbsp;And he was teaching day by day in the temple: and the  chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people  sought to destroy him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:48">19:48</A>&nbsp;and did not find what they could do, for all the people  hung on him to hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on one of the days, as he was teaching  the people in the temple, and announcing the glad tidings, the  chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;and spoke to him saying, Tell us by what authority thou  doest these things, or who is it who has given thee this  authority?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to them, *I* also will ask you [one]  thing, and tell me:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;The baptism of John, was it of heaven or of men?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we should  say, Of heaven, he will say, Why have ye not believed him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;but if we should say, Of men, the whole people will stone  us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;And they answered, they did not know whence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, Neither do *I* tell you by what  authority I do these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;And he began to speak to the people this parable: A man  planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen, and left the  country for a long time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;And in the season he sent to the husbandmen a bondman,  that they might give to him of the fruit of the vineyard; but  the husbandmen, having beaten him, sent [him] away empty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;And again he sent another bondman; but they, having beaten  him also, and cast insult upon him, sent [him] away empty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;And again he sent a third; and they, having wounded him  also, cast [him] out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will  send my beloved son: perhaps when they see him they will  respect [him].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among  themselves, saying, This is the heir; [come,] let us kill him,  that the inheritance may become ours.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;And having cast him forth out of the vineyard, they killed  [him]. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to  them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will give  the vineyard to others. And when they heard it they said, May  it never be!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:17">20:17</A>&nbsp;But he looking at them said, What then is this that is  written, The stone which they that builded rejected, this has  become the corner-stone?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:18">20:18</A>&nbsp;Every one falling on this stone shall be broken, but on  whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:19">20:19</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests and the scribes sought the same hour  to lay hands on him, and they feared the people; for they knew  that he had spoken this parable of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:20">20:20</A>&nbsp;And having watched [him], they sent out suborned persons,  pretending to be just men, that they might take hold of him in  [his] language, so that they might deliver him up to the power  and authority of the governor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:21">20:21</A>&nbsp;And they asked him saying, Teacher, we know that thou  sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest no [man's] person,  but teachest with truth the way of God:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:22">20:22</A>&nbsp;Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:23">20:23</A>&nbsp;But perceiving their deceit he said to them, Why do ye  tempt me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:24">20:24</A>&nbsp;Shew me a denarius. Whose image and superscription has it?  And answering they said, Caesar's.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:25">20:25</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Pay therefore what is Caesar's to  Caesar, and what is God's to God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:26">20:26</A>&nbsp;And they were not able to take hold of him in [his]  expressions before the people, and, wondering at his answer,  they were silent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:27">20:27</A>&nbsp;And some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any  resurrection, coming up [to him],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:28">20:28</A>&nbsp;demanded of him saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any  one's brother, who has a wife, die, and he die childless, his  brother shall take the wife and raise up seed to his brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:29">20:29</A>&nbsp;There were then seven brethren: and the first, having  taken a wife, died childless;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:30">20:30</A>&nbsp;and the second [took the woman, and *he* died childless];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:31">20:31</A>&nbsp;and the third took her: and in like manner also the seven  left no children and died;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:32">20:32</A>&nbsp;and last of all the woman also died.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:33">20:33</A>&nbsp;In the resurrection therefore of which of them does she  become wife, for the seven had her as wife?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:34">20:34</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and  are given in marriage,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:35">20:35</A>&nbsp;but they who are counted worthy to have part in that  world, and the resurrection from among [the] dead, neither  marry nor are given in marriage;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:36">20:36</A>&nbsp;for neither can they die any more, for they are equal to  angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:37">20:37</A>&nbsp;But that the dead rise, even Moses shewed in [the section  of] the bush, when he called [the] Lord the God of Abraham and  the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:38">20:38</A>&nbsp;but he is not God of [the] dead but of [the] living; for  all live for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:39">20:39</A>&nbsp;And some of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast  well spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:40">20:40</A>&nbsp;For they did not dare any more to ask him anything.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:41">20:41</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, How do they say that the Christ is  David's son,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:42">20:42</A>&nbsp;and David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord  said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:43">20:43</A>&nbsp;until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:44">20:44</A>&nbsp;David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:45">20:45</A>&nbsp;And, as all the people were listening, he said to his  disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:46">20:46</A>&nbsp;Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long  robes, and who love salutations in the market-places, and first  seats in the synagogues, and first places at suppers;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:47">20:47</A>&nbsp;who devour the houses of widows, and as a pretext make  long prayers. These shall receive a severer judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;And he looked up and saw the rich casting their gifts into  the treasury;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;but he saw also a certain poor widow casting therein two  mites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;And he said, Verily I say unto you, that this poor widow  has cast in more than all;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;for all these out of their abundance have cast into the  gifts [of God]; but she out of her need has cast in all the  living which she had.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;And as some spoke of the temple, that it was adorned with  goodly stones and consecrated offerings, he said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;[As to] these things which ye are beholding, days are  coming in which there shall not be left stone upon stone which  shall not be thrown down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;And they asked him saying, Teacher, when then shall these  things be; and what [is] the sign when these things are going  to take place?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And he said, See that ye be not led astray, for many shall  come in my name, saying, *I* am [he], and the time is drawn  nigh: go ye not [therefore] after them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults, be not  terrified, for these things must first take place, but the end  is not immediately.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;Then he said to them, Nation shall rise up against nation,  and kingdom against kingdom;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;there shall be both great earthquakes in different places,  and famines and pestilences; and there shall be fearful sights  and great signs from heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;But before all these things they shall lay their hands  upon you and persecute you, delivering [you] up to synagogues  and prisons, bringing [you] before kings and governors on  account of my name;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;but it shall turn out to you for a testimony.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;Settle therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand  [your] defence,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;for *I* will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your  opposers shall not be able to reply to or resist.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;But ye will be delivered up even by parents and brethren  and relations and friends, and they shall put to death [some]  from among you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;and ye will be hated of all for my name's sake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;And a hair of your head shall in no wise perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;By your patient endurance gain your souls.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;But when ye see Jerusalem encompassed with armies, then  know that its desolation is drawn nigh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;Then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains,  and those who are in the midst of it depart out, and those who  are in the country not enter into it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;for these are days of avenging, that all the things that  are written may be accomplished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;But woe to them that are with child and to them who give  suck in those days, for there shall be great distress upon the  land and wrath upon this people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and be led  captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden  down of [the] nations until [the] times of [the] nations be  fulfilled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars, and  upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity [at] the roar  of the sea and rolling waves,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:26">21:26</A>&nbsp;men ready to die through fear and expectation of what is  coming on the habitable earth, for the powers of the heavens  shall be shaken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:27">21:27</A>&nbsp;And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud  with power and great glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:28">21:28</A>&nbsp;But when these things begin to come to pass, look up and  lift up your heads, because your redemption draws nigh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:29">21:29</A>&nbsp;And he spoke a parable to them: Behold the fig-tree and  all the trees;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:30">21:30</A>&nbsp;when they already sprout, ye know of your own selves, [on]  looking [at them], that already the summer is near.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:31">21:31</A>&nbsp;So also *ye*, when ye see these things take place, know  that the kingdom of God is near.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:32">21:32</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall in no  wise pass away until all come to pass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:33">21:33</A>&nbsp;The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words  shall in no wise pass away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:34">21:34</A>&nbsp;But take heed to yourselves lest possibly your hearts be  laden with surfeiting and drinking and cares of life, and that  day come upon you suddenly unawares;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:35">21:35</A>&nbsp;for as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell upon  the face of the whole earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:36">21:36</A>&nbsp;Watch therefore, praying at every season, that ye may be  accounted worthy to escape all these things which are about to  come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:37">21:37</A>&nbsp;And by day he was teaching in the temple, and by night,  going out, he remained abroad on the mountain called [the  mount] of Olives;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:38">21:38</A>&nbsp;and all the people came early in the morning to him in the  temple to hear him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;Now the feast of unleavened bread, which [is] called the  passover, drew nigh,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might  kill him; for they feared the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariote,  being of the number of the twelve.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;And he went away and spoke with the chief priests and  captains as to how he should deliver him up to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;And they were rejoiced, and agreed to give him money.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;And he came to an agreement to do it, and sought an  opportunity to deliver him up to them away from the crowd.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;And the day of unleavened bread came, in which the passover  was to be killed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the  passover for us, that we may eat [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;But they said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare [it]?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Behold, as ye enter into the city a  man will meet you, carrying an earthen pitcher of water; follow  him into the house where he goes in;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher  says to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where I may eat the  passover with my disciples?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;And *he* will shew you a large upper room furnished: there  make ready.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;And having gone they found it as he had said to them; and  they prepared the passover.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;And when the hour was come, he placed himself at table,  and the [twelve] apostles with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat  this passover with you before I suffer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;For I say unto you, that I will not eat any more at all of  it until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;And having received a cup, when he had given thanks he  said, Take this and divide it among yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;For I say unto you, that I will not drink at all of the  fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;And having taken a loaf, when he had given thanks, he  broke [it], and gave [it] to them, saying, This is my body  which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying,  This cup [is] the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out  for you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:21">22:21</A>&nbsp;Moreover, behold, the hand of him that delivers me up [is]  with me on the table;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:22">22:22</A>&nbsp;and the Son of man indeed goes as it is determined, but  woe unto that man by whom he is delivered up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:23">22:23</A>&nbsp;And *they* began to question together among themselves who  then it could be of them who was about to do this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:24">22:24</A>&nbsp;And there was also a strife among them which of them  should be held to be [the] greatest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:25">22:25</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule over  them, and they that exercise authority over them are called  benefactors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:26">22:26</A>&nbsp;But *ye* [shall] not [be] thus; but let the greater among  you be as the younger, and the leader as he that serves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:27">22:27</A>&nbsp;For which [is] greater, he that is at table or he that  serves? [Is] not he that is at table? But *I* am in the midst  of you as the one that serves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:28">22:28</A>&nbsp;But *ye* are they who have persevered with me in my  temptations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:29">22:29</A>&nbsp;And *I* appoint unto you, as my Father has appointed unto  me, a kingdom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:30">22:30</A>&nbsp;that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and  sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:31">22:31</A>&nbsp;And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has  demanded to have you, to sift [you] as wheat;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:32">22:32</A>&nbsp;but *I* have besought for thee that thy faith fail not;  and *thou*, when once thou hast been restored, confirm thy  brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:33">22:33</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both  to prison and to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:34">22:34</A>&nbsp;And he said, I tell thee, Peter, [the] cock shall not crow  to-day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:35">22:35</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, When I sent you without purse and  scrip and sandals, did ye lack anything? And they said,  Nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:36">22:36</A>&nbsp;He said therefore to them, But now he that has a purse let  him take [it], in like manner also a scrip, and he that has  none let him sell his garment and buy a sword;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:37">22:37</A>&nbsp;for I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be  accomplished in me, And he was reckoned with [the] lawless: for  also the things concerning me have an end.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:38">22:38</A>&nbsp;And they said, Lord, behold here are two swords. And he  said to them, It is enough.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:39">22:39</A>&nbsp;And going forth he went according to his custom to the  mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:40">22:40</A>&nbsp;And when he was at the place he said to them, Pray that ye  enter not into temptation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:41">22:41</A>&nbsp;And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and  having knelt down he prayed,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:42">22:42</A>&nbsp;saying, Father, if thou wilt remove this cup from me: --  but then, not my will, but thine be done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:43">22:43</A>&nbsp;And an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:44">22:44</A>&nbsp;And being in conflict he prayed more intently. And his  sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the  earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:45">22:45</A>&nbsp;And rising up from his prayer, coming to the disciples, he  found them sleeping from grief.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:46">22:46</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Why sleep ye? rise up and pray that  ye enter not into temptation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:47">22:47</A>&nbsp;As he was yet speaking, behold, a crowd, and he that was  called Judas, one of the twelve, went on before them, and drew  near to Jesus to kiss him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:48">22:48</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son  of man with a kiss?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:49">22:49</A>&nbsp;And they who were around him, seeing what was going to  follow, said [to him], Lord, shall we smite with [the] sword?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:50">22:50</A>&nbsp;And a certain one from among them smote the bondman of the  high priest and took off his right ear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:51">22:51</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said, Suffer thus far; and having  touched his ear, he healed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:52">22:52</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the  temple and elders, who were come against him, Have ye come out  as against a robber with swords and sticks?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:53">22:53</A>&nbsp;When I was day by day with you in the temple ye did not  stretch out your hands against me; but this is your hour and  the power of darkness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:54">22:54</A>&nbsp;And having laid hold on him, they led him [away], and they  led [him] into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed  afar off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:55">22:55</A>&nbsp;And they having lit a fire in the midst of the court and  sat down together, Peter sat among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:56">22:56</A>&nbsp;And a certain maid, having seen him sitting by the light,  and having fixed her eyes upon him, said, And this [man] was  with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:57">22:57</A>&nbsp;But he denied [him], saying, Woman, I do not know him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:58">22:58</A>&nbsp;And after a short time another seeing him said, And *thou*  art of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:59">22:59</A>&nbsp;And after the lapse of about one hour another stoutly  maintained it, saying, In truth this [man] also was with him,  for also he is a Galilaean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:60">22:60</A>&nbsp;And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And  immediately, while he was yet speaking, [the] cock crew.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:61">22:61</A>&nbsp;And the Lord, turning round, looked at Peter; and Peter  remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before  [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:62">22:62</A>&nbsp;And Peter, going forth without, wept bitterly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:63">22:63</A>&nbsp;And the men who held him mocked him, beating [him];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:64">22:64</A>&nbsp;and covering him up, asked him saying, Prophesy, who is it  that struck thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:65">22:65</A>&nbsp;And they said many other injurious things to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:66">22:66</A>&nbsp;And when it was day, the elderhood of the people, both  [the] chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and  led him into their council, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:67">22:67</A>&nbsp;If *thou* art the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If  I tell you, ye will not at all believe;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:68">22:68</A>&nbsp;and if I should ask [you], ye would not answer me at all,  nor let me go;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:69">22:69</A>&nbsp;but henceforth shall the Son of man be sitting on the  right hand of the power of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:70">22:70</A>&nbsp;And they all said, *Thou* then art the Son of God? And he  said to them, *Ye* say that I am.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:71">22:71</A>&nbsp;And they said, What need have we any more of witness, for  we have heard ourselves out of his mouth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;And the whole multitude of them, rising up, led him to  Pilate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;And they began to accuse him, saying, We have found this  [man] perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to  Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;And Pilate demanded of him saying, Art *thou* the king of  the Jews? And he answering him said, Thou sayest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find  no guilt in this man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;But they insisted, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching  throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee even on to here.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;But Pilate, having heard Galilee [named], demanded if the  man were a Galilaean;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;and having learned that he was of Herod's jurisdiction,  remitted him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in  those days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;And when Herod saw Jesus he greatly rejoiced, for he had  been a long while desirous of seeing him, because of hearing  many things concerning him, and he hoped to see some sign done  by him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;and he questioned him in many words, but *he* answered him  nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests and the scribes stood and accused  him violently.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;And Herod with his troops having set him at nought and  mocked him, having put a splendid robe upon him, sent him back  to Pilate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;And Pilate and Herod became friends with one another the  same day, for they had been at enmity before between  themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;And Pilate, having called together the chief priests and  the rulers and the people,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;said to them, Ye have brought to me this man as turning  away the people [to rebellion], and behold, I, having examined  him before you, have found nothing criminal in this man as to  the things of which ye accuse him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;nor Herod either, for I remitted you to him, and behold,  nothing worthy of death is done by him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;Having chastised him therefore, I will release him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;( Now he was obliged to release one for them at the  feast.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;But they cried out in a mass saying, Away with this [man]  and release Barabbas to us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:19">23:19</A>&nbsp;who was one who, for a certain tumult which had taken  place in the city, and [for] murder, had been cast into prison.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:20">23:20</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore, desirous to release Jesus, again  addressed [them].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:21">23:21</A>&nbsp;But they cried out in reply saying, Crucify, crucify him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:22">23:22</A>&nbsp;And he said the third time to them, What evil then has  this [man] done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will  chastise him therefore and release him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:23">23:23</A>&nbsp;But they were urgent with loud voices, begging that he  might be crucified. And their voices [and those of the chief  priests] prevailed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:24">23:24</A>&nbsp;And Pilate adjudged that what they begged should take  place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;And he released him who, for tumult and murder, had been  cast into prison, whom they begged for, and Jesus he delivered  up to their will.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:26">23:26</A>&nbsp;And as they led him away, they laid hold on a certain  Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, and put the cross  upon him to bear it behind Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:27">23:27</A>&nbsp;And a great multitude of the people, and of women who  wailed and lamented him, followed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:28">23:28</A>&nbsp;And Jesus turning round to them said, Daughters of  Jerusalem, do not weep over me, but weep over yourselves and  over your children;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:29">23:29</A>&nbsp;for behold, days are coming in which they will say,  Blessed [are] the barren, and wombs that have not borne, and  breasts that have not given suck.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:30">23:30</A>&nbsp;Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon  us; and to the hills, Cover us:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:31">23:31</A>&nbsp;for if these things are done in the green tree, what shall  take place in the dry?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:32">23:32</A>&nbsp;Now two others also, malefactors, were led with him to be  put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:33">23:33</A>&nbsp;And when they came to the place which is called Skull,  there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right  hand, the other on the left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:34">23:34</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not  what they do. And, parting out his garments, they cast lots.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:35">23:35</A>&nbsp;And the people stood beholding, and the rulers also [with  them] sneered, saying, He has saved others; let him save  himself if this is the Christ, the chosen one of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:36">23:36</A>&nbsp;And the soldiers also made game of him, coming up offering  him vinegar,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:37">23:37</A>&nbsp;and saying, If *thou* be the king of the Jews, save  thyself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:38">23:38</A>&nbsp;And there was also an inscription [written] over him in  Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew letters: This is the King of the  Jews.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:39">23:39</A>&nbsp;Now one of the malefactors who had been hanged spoke  insultingly to him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save  thyself and us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:40">23:40</A>&nbsp;But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost *thou*  too not fear God, thou that art under the same judgment?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:41">23:41</A>&nbsp;and *we* indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense  of what we have done; but this [man] has done nothing amiss.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:42">23:42</A>&nbsp;And he said to Jesus, Remember me, [Lord,] when thou  comest in thy kingdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:43">23:43</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, To-day shalt  thou be with me in paradise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:44">23:44</A>&nbsp;And it was about [the] sixth hour, and there came darkness  over the whole land until [the] ninth hour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:45">23:45</A>&nbsp;And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple rent  in the midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:46">23:46</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, having cried with a loud voice, said, Father,  into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, he  expired.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:47">23:47</A>&nbsp;Now the centurion, seeing what took place, glorified God,  saying, In very deed this man was just.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:48">23:48</A>&nbsp;And all the crowds who had come together to that sight,  having seen the things that took place, returned, beating  [their] breasts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:49">23:49</A>&nbsp;And all those who knew him stood afar off, the women also  who had followed him from Galilee, beholding these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:50">23:50</A>&nbsp;And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a  good man and a just</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:51">23:51</A>&nbsp;(this [man] had not assented to their counsel and deed),  of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who also waited, [himself  also,] for the kingdom of God</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:52">23:52</A>&nbsp;-- he having gone to Pilate begged the body of Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:53">23:53</A>&nbsp;and having taken it down, wrapped it in fine linen and  placed him in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no one had ever  been laid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:54">23:54</A>&nbsp;And it was preparation day, and [the] sabbath twilight was  coming on.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:55">23:55</A>&nbsp;And women, who had come along with him out of Galilee,  having followed, saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:56">23:56</A>&nbsp;And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and  ointments, and remained quiet on the sabbath, according to the  commandment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:1">24:1</A>&nbsp;But on the morrow of the sabbath, very early indeed in the  morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the aromatic spices  which they had prepared.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:2">24:2</A>&nbsp;And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:3">24:3</A>&nbsp;And when they had entered they found not the body of the  Lord Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:4">24:4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it,  that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:5">24:5</A>&nbsp;And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to  the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living one among  the dead?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:6">24:6</A>&nbsp;He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you,  being yet in Galilee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:7">24:7</A>&nbsp;saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands  of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:8">24:8</A>&nbsp;And they remembered his words;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:9">24:9</A>&nbsp;and, returning from the sepulchre, related all these things  to the eleven and to all the rest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:10">24:10</A>&nbsp;Now it was Mary of Magdala, and Johanna, and Mary the  [mother] of James, and the others with them, who told these  things to the apostles.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:11">24:11</A>&nbsp;And their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale,  and they disbelieved them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:12">24:12</A>&nbsp;But Peter, rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping  down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone, and went away  home, wondering at what had happened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:13">24:13</A>&nbsp;And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a  village distant sixty stadia from Jerusalem, called Emmaus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:14">24:14</A>&nbsp;and they conversed with one another about all these things  which had taken place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:15">24:15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as they conversed and reasoned, that  Jesus himself drawing nigh, went with them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:16">24:16</A>&nbsp;but their eyes were holden so as not to know him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:17">24:17</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, What discourses are these which pass  between you as ye walk, and are downcast?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:18">24:18</A>&nbsp;And one [of them], named Cleopas, answering said to him,  Thou sojournest alone in Jerusalem, and dost not know what has  taken place in it in these days?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:19">24:19</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, What things? And they said to him,  The things concerning Jesus the Nazaraean, who was a prophet  mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:20">24:20</A>&nbsp;and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up  to [the] judgment of death and crucified him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:21">24:21</A>&nbsp;But *we* had hoped that *he* was [the one] who is about to  redeem Israel. But then, besides all these things, it is now,  to-day, the third day since these things took place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:22">24:22</A>&nbsp;And withal, certain women from amongst us astonished us,  having been very early at the sepulchre,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:23">24:23</A>&nbsp;and, not having found his body, came, saying that they  also had seen a vision of angels, who say that he is living.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:24">24:24</A>&nbsp;And some of those with us went to the sepulchre, and found  it so, as the women also had said, but him they saw not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:25">24:25</A>&nbsp;And *he* said to them, O senseless and slow of heart to  believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:26">24:26</A>&nbsp;Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to  enter into his glory?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:27">24:27</A>&nbsp;And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he  interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning  himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:28">24:28</A>&nbsp;And they drew near to the village where they were going,  and *he* made as though he would go farther.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:29">24:29</A>&nbsp;And they constrained him, saying, Stay with us, for it is  toward evening and the day is declining. And he entered in to  stay with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:30">24:30</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as he was at table with them, having  taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken it, gave it to  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:31">24:31</A>&nbsp;And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And  he disappeared from them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:32">24:32</A>&nbsp;And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in  us as he spoke to us on the way, [and] as he opened the  scriptures to us?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:33">24:33</A>&nbsp;And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem.  And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered  together,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:34">24:34</A>&nbsp;saying, The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to  Simon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:35">24:35</A>&nbsp;And they related what [had happened] on the way, and how  he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:36">24:36</A>&nbsp;And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in  their midst, and says to them, Peace [be] unto you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:37">24:37</A>&nbsp;But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed  they beheld a spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:38">24:38</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why are  thoughts rising in your hearts?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:39">24:39</A>&nbsp;behold my hands and my feet, that it is *I* myself. Handle  me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me  having.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:40">24:40</A>&nbsp;And having said this he shewed them his hands and his  feet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:41">24:41</A>&nbsp;But while they yet did not believe for joy, and were  wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything here to eat?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:42">24:42</A>&nbsp;And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a  honeycomb;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:43">24:43</A>&nbsp;and he took it and ate before them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:44">24:44</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, These [are] the words which I spoke  to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written  concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must  be fulfilled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:45">24:45</A>&nbsp;Then he opened their understanding to understand the  scriptures,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:46">24:46</A>&nbsp;and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved  the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third  day;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:47">24:47</A>&nbsp;and that repentance and remission of sins should be  preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:48">24:48</A>&nbsp;And *ye* are witnesses of these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:49">24:49</A>&nbsp;And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but  do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on  high.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:50">24:50</A>&nbsp;And he led them out as far as Bethany, and having lifted  up his hands, he blessed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:51">24:51</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as he was blessing them, he was  separated from them and was carried up into heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:52">24:52</A>&nbsp;And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem  with great joy,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:53">24:53</A>&nbsp;and were continually in the temple praising and blessing  God.</p>
