<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The word of Jehovah that came to Micah the Morasthite in the  days of Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he  saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Hear, ye peoples, all of you; hearken, O earth, and all that  is therein: and let the Lord Jehovah be witness against you,  the Lord from his holy temple!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;For behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place, and will  come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys  shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters poured down a  steep place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins  of the house of Israel. Whence is the transgression of Jacob?  is it not [from] Samaria? And whence are the high places of  Judah? are they not [from] Jerusalem?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I make Samaria as a heap of the field, as  plantings of a vineyard; and I will pour down the stones  thereof into the valley, and I will lay bare the foundations  thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all  her harlot-gifts shall be burned with fire, and all her idols  will I make a desolation; for of the hire of a harlot hath she  gathered [them], and to a harlot's hire shall they return.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;For this will I lament, and I will howl; I will go stripped  and naked: I will make a wailing like the jackals, and mourning  like the ostriches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even unto  Judah, it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all; at Beth-le-aphrah  roll thyself in the dust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;Pass away, inhabitress of Shaphir, in nakedness [and]  shame. The inhabitress of Zaanan is not come forth for the  lamentation of Beth-ezel: he will take from you its shelter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;For the inhabitress of Maroth waited anxiously for good;  but evil hath come down from Jehovah unto the gate of  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitress of  Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion;  for in thee were found the transgressions of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore shalt thou give parting-gifts to Moresheth-Gath:  the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;I will yet bring unto thee an heir, O inhabitress of  Mareshah; the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;Make thee bald, and poll thee for the children of thy  delights; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle, for they are gone  into captivity from thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their  beds! When the morning is light they practise it, because it is  in the power of their hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and  houses, and take them away; and they oppress a man and his  house, even a man and his heritage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do  I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks;  neither shall ye walk haughtily: for it is an evil time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;In that day shall they take up a proverb concerning you, and  lament with a doleful lamentation, [and] say, We are utterly  spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he  removed it from me! He hath distributed our fields to the  rebellious.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the measuring  line upon a lot, in the congregation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Prophesy ye not, they prophesy. If they do not prophesy to  these, the ignominy will not depart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;O thou [that art] named the house of Jacob, Is Jehovah  impatient? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him  that walketh uprightly?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip off  the mantle with the garment from them that pass by securely,  that are averse from war.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;The women of my people do ye cast out from their pleasant  houses; from their young children do ye take away my  magnificence for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Arise ye, and depart; for this is not the resting-place,  because of defilement that bringeth destruction, even a  grievous destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie, [saying,] I  will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink, he shall  be the prophet of this people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;I will surely assemble, O Jacob, the whole of thee; I will  surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together  as sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture:  they shall make great noise by reason of [the multitude of]  men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;One that breaketh through is gone up before them: they have  broken forth, and have passed on to the gate, and are gone out  by it; and their king passeth on before them, and Jehovah at  the head of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and princes  of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know judgment?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;Ye who hate the good, and love evil; who pluck off their  skin from them, and their flesh from off their bones;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;and who eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from  off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces as for  the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;Then shall they cry unto Jehovah, but he will not answer  them; and he will hide his face from them at that time,  according as they have wrought evil in their doings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that cause my  people to err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace! but  whoso putteth not into their mouths they prepare war against  him:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;therefore ye shall have night without a vision; and it shall  be dark unto you, without divination; and the sun shall go down  upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded;  and they shall all cover their lips, for there will be no  answer of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;But truly I am filled with power by the Spirit of Jehovah,  and with judgment and with might, to declare unto Jacob his  transgression, and to Israel his sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and  princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and  pervert all equity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;that build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with  unrighteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof  teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet  do they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst  of us? no evil shall come upon us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed [as] a  field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of  the house as the high places of a forest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;But it shall come to pass in the end of days [that] the  mountain of Jehovah's house shall be established on the top of  the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and the  peoples shall flow unto it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;And many nations shall go and say, Come, and let us go up to  the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob;  and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his  paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and Jehovah's  word from Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And he shall judge among many peoples, and reprove strong  nations, even afar off; and they shall forge their swords into  ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-knives: nation  shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they  learn war any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And they shall sit every one under his vine, and under his  fig-tree; and there shall be none to make [them] afraid: for  the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;For all the peoples will walk every one in the name of his  god; but we will walk in the name of Jehovah, our God for ever  and ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble her that  halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that  I have afflicted;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;and I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was  cast far off a strong nation; and Jehovah shall reign over them  in mount Zion, from henceforth even for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And thou, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of  Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the first dominion shall  come, -- the kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee?  is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have seized thee as a  woman in travail?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion,  like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the  city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even  to Babylon: there shalt thou be delivered; there Jehovah will  redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say,  Let her be profaned, and let our eye look upon Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, neither  understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them together  as the sheaves into the threshing-floor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, for I will make thy  horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat  in pieces many peoples; and I will devote their gain to  Jehovah, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops; he hath  laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel  with a rod upon the cheek.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;(And thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, little to be among the  thousands of Judah, out of thee shall he come forth unto me  [who is] to be Ruler in Israel: whose goings forth are from of  old, from the days of eternity.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore will he give them up, until the time when she  which travaileth shall have brought forth: and the residue of  his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;And he shall stand and feed [his flock] in the strength of  Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God. And  they shall abide; for now shall he be great even unto the ends  of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And this [man] shall be Peace. When the Assyrian shall come  into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then  shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight princes  of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And they shall waste the land of Asshur with the sword, and  the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof; and he shall  deliver [us] from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land,  and when he treadeth within our borders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many  peoples as dew from Jehovah, as showers upon the grass, that  tarrieth not for man, neither waiteth for the sons of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the  midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the  forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he  go through, treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and there is  none to deliver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all  thine enemies shall be cut off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, that  I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will  destroy thy chariots.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and overthrow  all thy strongholds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And I will cut off sorceries out of thy hand; and thou  shalt have no soothsayers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy statues out  of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more bow down to the  work of thy hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And I will pluck up thine Asherahs out of the midst of  thee, and I will destroy thy cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;And I will execute vengeance in anger and in fury upon the  nations, such as they have not heard of.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise, contend before the  mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Hear, ye mountains, Jehovah's controversy, and ye,  unchanging foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a  controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I  wearied thee? testify against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed  thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses,  Aaron, and Miriam.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted,  and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from Shittim unto  Gilgal, that ye may know the righteousness of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, bow myself before the  high God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with  calves of a year old?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Will Jehovah take pleasure in thousands of rams, in ten  thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my  transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;He hath shewn thee, O man, what is good: and what doth  Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love  goodness, and to walk humbly with thy God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;Jehovah's voice crieth unto the city, and wisdom looketh on  thy name. Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the  wicked, and the scant measure [which is] abominable?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;Shall I be pure with the unjust balances, and with the bag  of deceitful weights?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;For her rich men are full of violence, and her inhabitants  speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore also will I make [thee] sick in smiting thee; I  will make [thee] desolate because of thy sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt eat, and not be satisfied, and thine emptiness  [shall remain] in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take away,  and not save; and what thou savest will I give up to the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread  the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and new  wine, but shalt not drink wine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the  house of Ahab; and ye walk in their counsels: that I should  make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing;  and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the  summer-fruits, as the grape-gleanings of the vintage. There is  no cluster to eat; there is no early fruit [which] my soul  desired.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;The godly [man] hath perished out of the land, and there is  none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood, they  hunt every man his brother with a net.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Both hands are for evil, to do it well. The prince asketh,  and the judge [is there] for a reward; and the great [man]  uttereth his soul's greed: and [together] they combine it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;The best of them is as a briar; the most upright, [worse]  than a thorn-fence. The day of thy watchmen, thy visitation is  come; now shall be their perplexity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Believe ye not in a companion, put not confidence in a  familiar friend: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that  lieth in thy bosom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up  against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her  mother-in-law: a man's enemies are the men of his own  household.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the  God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: though I fall, I shall  arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah shall be a light unto  me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;I will bear the indignation of Jehovah -- for I have sinned  against him -- until he plead my cause, and execute judgment  for me: he will bring me forth to the light; I shall behold his  righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And mine enemy shall see [it], and shame shall cover her  which said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall  behold her; now shall she be trodden down, as the mire of the  streets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;In the day when thy walls shall be built, on that day shall  the established limit recede.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;In that day they shall come to thee from Assyria and the  cities of Egypt, and from Egypt to the river, and from sea to  sea, and from mountain to mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;But the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell  therein, for the fruit of their doings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine  inheritance, dwelling alone in the forest, in the midst of  Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of  old.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;-- As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of  Egypt, will I shew them marvellous things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;-- The nations shall see, and be ashamed for all their  might: they shall lay [their] hand upon [their] mouth, their  ears shall be deaf.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;They shall lick dust like the serpent; like crawling things  of the earth, they shall come trembling forth from their close  places. They shall turn with fear to Jehovah our God, and shall  be afraid because of thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;Who is a &#249;God like unto thee, that forgiveth iniquity, and  passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He  retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in  loving-kindness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;He will yet again have compassion on us, he will tread  under foot our iniquities: and thou wilt cast all their sins  into the depths of the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;Thou wilt perform truth to Jacob, loving-kindness to  Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers, from the days  of old.</p>
