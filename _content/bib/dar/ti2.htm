<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, according to  promise of life, the [life] which [is] in Christ Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;to Timotheus, [my] beloved child: grace, mercy, peace, from  God [the] Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;I am thankful to God, whom I serve from [my] forefathers  with pure conscience, how unceasingly I have the remembrance of  thee in my supplications night and day,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;earnestly desiring to see thee, remembering thy tears, that  I may be filled with joy;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;calling to mind the unfeigned faith which [has been] in  thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy  mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;For which cause I put thee in mind to rekindle the gift of  God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of  power, and of love, and of wise discretion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor  of me his prisoner; but suffer evil along with the glad  tidings, according to the power of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;who has saved us, and has called us with a holy calling, not  according to our works, but according to [his] own purpose and  grace, which [was] given to us in Christ Jesus before [the]  ages of time,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;but has been made manifest now by the appearing of our  Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled death, and brought to  light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;to which *I* have been appointed a herald and apostle and  teacher of [the] nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not  ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that  he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Have an outline of sound words, which [words] thou hast  heard of me, in faith and love which [are] in Christ Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good  deposit entrusted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;Thou knowest this, that all who [are] in Asia, of whom is  Phygellus and Hermogenes, have turned away from me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he  has often refreshed me, and has not been ashamed of my chain;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;but being in Rome sought me out very diligently, and found  [me] --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;the Lord grant to him to find mercy from [the] Lord in that  day -- and how much service he rendered in Ephesus *thou*  knowest best.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which [is]  in Christ Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many  witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be  competent to instruct others also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus  Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;No one going as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs  of life, that he may please him who has enlisted him as a  soldier.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And if also any one contend [in the games], he is not  crowned unless he contend lawfully.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;The husbandman must labour before partaking of the fruits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee  understanding in all things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Remember Jesus Christ raised from among [the] dead, of [the]  seed of David, according to my glad tidings,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;in which I suffer even unto bonds as an evil-doer: but the  word of God is not bound.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the  elect, that *they* also may obtain the salvation which [is] in  Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;The word [is] faithful; for if we have died together with  [him], we shall also live together;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;if we endure, we shall also reign together; if we deny,  *he* also will deny us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;if we are unfaithful, *he* abides faithful, for he cannot  deny himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Of these things put in remembrance, testifying earnestly  before the Lord not to have disputes of words, profitable for  nothing, to the subversion of the hearers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God, a  workman that has not to be ashamed, cutting in a straight line  the word of truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;But profane, vain babblings shun, for they will advance to  greater impiety,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;and their word will spread as a gangrene; of whom is  Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;[men] who as to the truth have gone astray, saying that the  resurrection has taken place already; and overthrow the faith  of some.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;Yet the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal,  [The] Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who  names the name of [the] Lord withdraw from iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;But in a great house there are not only gold and silver  vessels, but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour, and  some to dishonour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;If therefore one shall have purified himself from these,  [in separating himself from them], he shall be a vessel to  honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for  every good work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith,  love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure  heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;But foolish and senseless questionings avoid, knowing that  they beget contentions.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;And a bondman of [the] Lord ought not to contend, but be  gentle towards all; apt to teach; forbearing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;in meekness setting right those who oppose, if God perhaps  may sometime give them repentance to acknowledgment of [the]  truth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;and that they may awake up out of the snare of the devil,  [who are] taken by him, for *his* will.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;But this know, that in [the] last days difficult times shall  be there;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,  arrogant, evil speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful,  profane,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of  unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is good,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure  rather than lovers of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;having a form of piety but denying the power of it: and from  these turn away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;For of these are they who are getting into houses, and  leading captive silly women, laden with sins, led by various  lusts,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;always learning, and never able to come to [the] knowledge  of [the] truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood  Moses, thus these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in  mind, found worthless as regards the faith.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;But they shall not advance farther; for their folly shall be  completely manifest to all, as that of those also became.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;But *thou* hast been thoroughly acquainted with my  teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love,  endurance,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;persecutions, sufferings: what [sufferings] happened to me  in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured;  and the Lord delivered me out of all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus  will be persecuted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;But wicked men and juggling impostors shall advance in  evil, leading and being led astray.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;But *thou*, abide in those things which thou hast learned,  and [of which] thou hast been fully persuaded, knowing of whom  thou hast learned [them];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters,  which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith  which [is] in Christ Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Every scripture [is] divinely inspired, and profitable for  teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in  righteousness;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every  good work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;I testify before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge  living and dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;proclaim the word; be urgent in season [and] out of season,  convict, rebuke, encourage, with all longsuffering and  doctrine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;For the time shall be when they will not bear sound  teaching; but according to their own lusts will heap up to  themselves teachers, having an itching ear;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;and they will turn away their ear from the truth, and will  have turned aside to fables.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;But *thou*, be sober in all things, bear evils, do [the]  work of an evangelist, fill up the full measure of thy  ministry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;For *I* am already being poured out, and the time of my  release is come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;I have combated the good combat, I have finished the race, I  have kept the faith.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me,  which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me in that  day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his  appearing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Use diligence to come to me quickly;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;for Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age,  and is gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to  Dalmatia.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;Luke alone is with me. Take Mark, and bring [him] with  thyself, for he is serviceable to me for ministry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;The cloak which I left behind [me] in Troas at Carpus's,  bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the  parchments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Alexander the smith did many evil things against me. The  Lord will render to him according to his works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;Against whom be *thou* also on thy guard, for he has  greatly withstood our words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;At my first defence no man stood with me, but all deserted  me. May it not be imputed to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;But the Lord stood with [me], and gave me power, that  through me the proclamation might be fully made, and all [those  of] the nations should hear; and I was delivered out of the  lion's mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;The Lord shall deliver me from every wicked work, and shall  preserve [me] for his heavenly kingdom; to whom [be] glory for  the ages of ages. Amen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;Erastus remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I left behind in  Miletus sick.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Use diligence to come before winter. Eubulus salutes thee,  and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and the brethren all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;The Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Grace [be]  with you.</p>
