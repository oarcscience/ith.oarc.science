### Darby Bible: 2 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The elder to \[the\] elect lady and her
children, whom \*I\* love in truth, and not \*I\* only but also all who
have known the truth,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> for the truth's sake which abides in us and
shall be with us to eternity.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from
God \[the\] Father, and from \[the\] Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the
Father, in truth and love.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy
children walking in truth, as we have received commandment from the
Father.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as
writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from
\[the\] beginning, that we should love one another.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And this is love, that we should walk
according to his commandments. This is the commandment, according as ye
have heard from the beginning, that ye might walk in it.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For many deceivers have gone out into the
world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh -- this is
the deceiver and the antichrist.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> See to yourselves, that we may not lose
what we have wrought, but may receive full wages.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Whosoever goes forward and abides not in
the doctrine of the Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine,
\*he\* has both the Father and the Son.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> If any one come to you and bring not this
doctrine, do not receive him into \[the\] house, and greet him not;

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> for he who greets him partakes in his
wicked works.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Having many things to write to you, I
would not with paper and ink; but hope to come to you, and to speak
mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> The children of thine elect sister greet
thee.
