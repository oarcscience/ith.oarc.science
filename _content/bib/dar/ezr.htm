<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word  of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished,  Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he  made a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also in  writing, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the  earth has Jehovah the God of the heavens given to me, and he  has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in  Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be  with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah,  and build the house of Jehovah the God of Israel -- he is God  -- which is at Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And whosoever remains in any place where he sojourns, let  the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and  with goods, and with beasts, besides the voluntary offering for  the house of God which is at Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And the chief fathers of Judah and Benjamin rose up, and the  priests, and the Levites, even all those whose spirit God had  stirred, to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is at  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And all they that were about them strengthened their hands  with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, and with  beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was  willingly offered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And king Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the house of  Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of  Jerusalem and had put in the house of his god.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of  Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar  the prince of Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a  thousand chargers of silver, nine-and-twenty knives,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_2:69">2:69</A>&nbsp;They gave after their ability to the treasure of the work  sixty-one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of  silver, and one hundred priests' coats.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:70">2:70</A>&nbsp;And the priests, and the Levites, and [some] of the people,  and the singers, and the doorkeepers, and the Nethinim dwelt in  their cities, and all Israel in their cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And when the seventh month came, and the children of Israel  were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren  the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his  brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer up  burnt-offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the  man of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And they set the altar on its base; for fear was upon them  because of the people of the countries; and they offered up  burnt-offerings on it to Jehovah, the morning and evening  burnt-offerings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And they held the feast of tabernacles as it is written, and  [offered] daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the  ordinance, as the duty of every day required;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;and afterwards the continual burnt-offering, and those of  the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were  consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a  voluntary offering to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer  up burnt-offerings to Jehovah. But the foundation of the temple  of Jehovah was not [yet] laid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;And they gave money to the masons and to the carpenters; and  meat and drink and oil to the Zidonians and to the Tyrians, to  bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according  to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And in the second year of their coming to the house of God  at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of  Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of  their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that  had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and they appointed  the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to superintend  the work of the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;And Jeshua stood up, his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and  his sons, the sons of Judah, as one [man], to superintend the  workmen in the house of God; [also] the sons of Henadad, their  sons and their brethren, the Levites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of  Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel, with trumpets,  and the Levites the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise  Jehovah according to the directions of David king of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;And they sang alternately together in praising and giving  thanks to Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness  [endureth] for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted  with a great shout to the praise of Jehovah, because the  foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;But many of the priests and Levites and chief fathers, the  ancient men that had seen the first house, wept with a loud  voice, [when] the foundation of this house was laid in their  sight; and many shouted aloud for joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;And the people could not discern the noise of the shout of  joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people  shouted with a great shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the  children of the captivity were building the temple to Jehovah  the God of Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;and they came to Zerubbabel and to the chief fathers, and  said to them, We would build with you; for we seek your God, as  ye; and we have sacrificed to him since the days of Esar-haddon  king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the chief fathers  of Israel said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build  a house to our God, but we alone will build to Jehovah the God  of Israel, as king Cyrus, the king of Persia, has commanded us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And the people of the land weakened the hands of the people  of Judah, and troubled them in building;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;and they hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their  purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the  reign of Darius king of Persia.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his  reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of  Judah and Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel,  and the rest of his companions, wrote to Artaxerxes king of  Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Aramaic,  and interpreted in Aramaic.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter  against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king after this sort:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest  of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the  Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians,  the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;and the rest of the peoples whom the great and noble  Osnappar brought over and settled in the cities of Samaria, and  the rest [of the country] on this side the river, and so forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;This is the copy of the letter that they sent to him: To  Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men on this side the  river, and so forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from thee  unto us have come to Jerusalem; they are building the  rebellious and the bad city, and they complete the walls and  join up the foundations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Be it known therefore unto the king, that, if this city be  built and the walls be completed, they will not pay tribute,  tax, and toll, and in the end it will bring damage to the  kings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Now, since we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not  right for us to see the king's injury, therefore have we sent  and informed the king;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;that search may be made in the book of the annals of thy  fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the annals and know  that this city is a rebellious city, which has done damage to  kings and provinces, and that they have raised sedition within  the same of old time, for which cause this city was destroyed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;We inform the king that if this city be built and its walls  be completed, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this  side the river.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;The king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and  Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions that  dwell in Samaria, and the other places beyond the river: Peace,  and so forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;The letter that ye sent to us has been read before me  distinctly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;And I gave orders, and search has been made, and it has  been found that this city of old time has made insurrection  against the kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been  raised therein.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;And there have been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have  ruled over all beyond the river; and tribute, tax, and toll  were paid to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Now give order to make these men to cease, and that this  city be not built, until the order shall be given from me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;and take heed that ye fail not to do this: why should harm  grow to the damage of the kings?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;As soon as the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read  before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions,  they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them  cease by force and power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at  Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of  Darius king of Persia.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son  of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and  Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel [did they prophesy]  to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the  son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at  Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, who helped  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;At that time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the  river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus  to them: Who gave you orders to build this house and to  complete this wall?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;And they said to them after this manner: What are the names  of the men that build this building?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews,  and they did not make them cease till the matter came to  Darius; and then they returned answer by letter concerning it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side  the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the  Apharsachites, who were on this side the river, sent to Darius  the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;They sent a report to him in which was written thus: To  Darius the king, all peace!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Be it known to the king that we went into the province of  Judah, to the house of the great God, which is being built with  great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work is  being carried on with diligence, and prospers in their hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Then asked we those elders: thus we said to them, Who gave  you orders to build this house and to complete this wall?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;We asked their names also, to inform thee, that we might  write the names of the men that were the chief of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the  servants of the God of the heavens and the earth, and build the  house that was built these many years ago; and a great king of  Israel built and completed it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;But after that our fathers had provoked the God of the  heavens to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar  king of Babylon, the Chaldean, and he destroyed this house, and  carried the people away unto Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, king Cyrus  gave orders to build this house of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of  God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was at  Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did  king Cyrus take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were  delivered to one Sheshbazzar by name, whom he had appointed  governor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into  the temple that is at Jerusalem, and let the house of God be  built in its place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Then came the same Sheshbazzar, [and] laid the foundation  of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and since that time  even until now has it been in building, and it is not  completed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And now, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in  the king's treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether  it be so, that orders were given by king Cyrus to build this  house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure  to us concerning this matter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Then king Darius gave orders, and search was made in the  house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in  Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;And there was found at Achmetha in the fortress that is in  the province of Media a roll, and therein was a record thus  written:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;In the first year of king Cyrus, king Cyrus made a decree  [concerning] the house of God at Jerusalem: Let the house be  built for a place where they offer sacrifices, and let its  foundations be solidly laid; its height sixty cubits, its  breadth sixty cubits,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;[with] three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber;  and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of  God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that is at  Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought again  to the temple that is at Jerusalem, in their place; and thou  shalt put [them] in the house of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai,  and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the  river, be ye far from thence:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of  the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in  its place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Moreover, I give orders what ye shall do to these elders of  the Jews, for the building of this house of God: that of the  king's goods, of the tribute beyond the river, expenses be  diligently given to these men, that they be not hindered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And that which they have need of, both young bullocks and  rams and lambs, for the burnt-offerings to the God of the  heavens, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the  appointment of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be  given them day by day without fail;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;that they may present sweet odours to the God of the  heavens, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;Also I have given order that whosoever shall alter this  rescript, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being  set up, let him be hanged thereon, and let his house be made a  dunghill for this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And the God that has caused his name to dwell there  overthrow every king and people that shall put forth their hand  to alter [or] to destroy this house of God which is at  Jerusalem. I Darius have given [this] order; let it be done  diligently.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river,  Shethar-boznai, and their companions, because of that which  king Darius had sent, did so diligently.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;And the elders of the Jews built; and they prospered  through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the  son of Iddo. And they built and completed [it] according to the  commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the  commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of  Persia.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;And this house was finished on the third day of the month  Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of king Darius.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites,  and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the  dedication of this house of God with joy;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;and they presented at the dedication of this house of God a  hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for  a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to  the number of the tribes of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;And they set the priests in their classes, and the Levites  in their divisions, for the service of God, which is at  Jerusalem: as it is written in the book of Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;And the children of the captivity held the passover upon  the fourteenth of the first month.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves as  one [man]: they were all pure; and they killed the passover for  all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the  priests, and for themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel that were come back out of  captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them  from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah  the God of Israel, did eat;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;and they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with  joy; for Jehovah had made them joyful, and turned the heart of  the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the  work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes, king of  Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of  Hilkijah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,  the son of Aaron the chief priest,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;-- this Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe  in the law of Moses, which Jehovah the God of Israel had given.  And the king granted him all his request, according to the hand  of Jehovah his God upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;(And there went up [some] of the children of Israel, and of  the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the  doorkeepers, and the Nethinim, to Jerusalem, in the seventh  year of Artaxerxes the king.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in  the seventh year of the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;For upon the first of the first month the project of going  up from Babylon was determined on, and on the first of the  fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of  his God upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;For Ezra had directed his heart to seek the law of Jehovah  and to do it, and to teach in Israel the statutes and the  ordinances.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;And this is the copy of the letter that king Artaxerxes  gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of  the commandments of Jehovah, and of his statutes to Israel:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, an  accomplished scribe of the law of the God of the heavens, and  so forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;I have given orders that all they of the people of Israel,  and of their priests and the Levites, in my realm, who are  disposed to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Because thou art sent by the king, and by his seven  counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem,  according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his  counsellors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose  habitation is at Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the  province of Babylon, besides the voluntary offering of the  people, and of the priests, who offer willingly for the house  of their God which is at Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou shalt buy diligently with this money  bullocks, rams, lambs, with their oblations and their  drink-offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of  your God which is at Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;And whatever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to  do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do according  to the will of your God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;And the vessels that have been given thee for the service  of the house of thy God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;And whatever more shall be needful for the house of thy God  which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the  king's treasure house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;And I, I Artaxerxes the king, do give orders to all the  treasurers that are beyond the river, that whatever Ezra the  priest and scribe of the law of the God of the heavens shall  require of you, it be done diligently,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures  of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred  baths of oil, and salt without prescribing [how much].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;Whatever is commanded by the God of the heavens, let it be  carefully done for the house of the God of the heavens; for why  should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his  sons?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;Also we inform you, as regards all the priests and Levites,  singers, doorkeepers, Nethinim, and ministers of this house of  God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, tax, and toll  upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, which is in  thy hand, set magistrates and judges who may judge all the  people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of  thy God; and teach ye him that knows [them] not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;And whosoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of  the king, let judgment be executed diligently upon him, whether  unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or  to imprisonment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;Blessed be Jehovah the God of our fathers, who has put  [such a thing] as this in the king's heart, to beautify the  house of Jehovah which is at Jerusalem;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;and has extended mercy to me before the king and his  counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I  was strengthened, as the hand of Jehovah my God was upon me;  and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with  me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;And these are the chief fathers, and their genealogy, who  went up with me from Babylon in the reign of Artaxerxes the  king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;Of the children of Phinehas, Gershom; of the children of  Ithamar, Daniel; of the children of David, Hattush;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;of the children of Shecaniah, of the children of Parosh,  Zechariah, and with him were registered by genealogy of the  males a hundred and fifty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;Of the children of Pahath-Moab, Elihoenai the son of  Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Of the children of Shechaniah, the son of Jahaziel, and with  him three hundred males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and  with him fifty males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Elam, Isaiah the son of Athaliah, and  with him seventy males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of  Michael, and with him eighty males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;Of the children of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with  him two hundred and eighteen males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah, and  with him a hundred and sixty males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai,  and with him twenty-eight males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan,  and with him a hundred and ten males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Adonikam, the last ones, whose names  are these: Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty  males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with  them seventy males.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And I gathered them together at the river that runs to  Ahava; and there we encamped three days; and I surveyed the  people and the priests, and found none of the sons of Levi  there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;And I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for  Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and  for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men, and for Joiarib  and for Elnathan, men of understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And I gave them a commission to Iddo the chief, at the  place Casiphia, and I put words in their mouths to say to Iddo  [and] his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that  they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a  man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi,  the son of Israel, namely, Sherebiah, with his sons and his  brethren, eighteen;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;and Hashabiah, and with him Isaiah of the sons of Merari,  his brethren and their sons, twenty;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had  appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and  twenty Nethinim: all of them were expressed by name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;And I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we  might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right  way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers  and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way; for we  had spoken to the king saying, The hand of our God is upon all  them for good that seek him; but his power and his anger is  against all them that forsake him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:23">8:23</A>&nbsp;And we fasted, and besought our God for this; and he was  entreated of us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;And I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests,  Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;and I weighed to them the silver and the gold and the  vessels, the heave-offering for the house of our God, which the  king and his counsellors and his princes, and all Israel  present, had offered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;And I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents  of silver; and silver vessels a hundred talents, [and] of gold  a hundred talents;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;and twenty basons of gold, of a thousand darics; and two  vessels of shining copper, precious as gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;And I said to them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah; the vessels  also are holy; and the silver and the gold is a voluntary  offering to Jehovah the God of your fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;Watch and keep [them] until ye weigh them before the chiefs  of the priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of the fathers  of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;And the priests and the Levites received by weight the  silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem  unto the house of our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;And we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the  first month, to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was  upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of  such as lay in wait by the way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:33">8:33</A>&nbsp;And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the  vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of  Meremoth the son of Urijah the priest; and with him was Eleazar  the son of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad the son of  Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:34">8:34</A>&nbsp;the whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was  written down at that time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:35">8:35</A>&nbsp;The children of those that had been carried away, who had  come out of the captivity, presented burnt-offerings to the God  of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety-six rams,  seventy-seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all  for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:36">8:36</A>&nbsp;And they delivered the king's edicts to the king's satraps,  and to the governors on this side the river. And they furthered  the people and the house of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;Now when these things were completed, the princes came to  me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the  Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the  lands, according to their abominations, [even] of the  Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the  Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and  for their sons, and have mingled the holy seed with the peoples  of the lands; and the hand of the princes and rulers has been  chief in this unfaithfulness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;And when I heard this thing, I rent my mantle and my  garment, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard,  and sat down overwhelmed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the  words of the God of Israel, because of the unfaithfulness of  those that had been carried away; and I sat overwhelmed until  the evening oblation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation;  and with my mantle and my garment rent, I fell on my knees, and  spread out my hands to Jehovah my God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;and said: O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my  face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over  [our] head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Since the days of our fathers, we have been in great  trespass to this day; and for our iniquities we, our kings, our  priests, have been given into the hand of the kings of the  lands, to the sword, and to captivity, and to spoil, and to  confusion of face, as it is this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;And now for a little space there hath been favour from  Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give  us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes,  and give us a little reviving in our bondage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our  bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us before the kings of  Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God  and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah  and in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And now, what shall we say, our God, after this? for we  have forsaken thy commandments,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets,  saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess [it], is an  unclean land through the filthiness of the peoples of the  lands, through their abominations with which they have filled  it from one end to another through their uncleanness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons,  neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace  or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat  the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your  children for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and  for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished  us less than our iniquities [deserve], and hast given us such  deliverance as this,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;should we again break thy commandments, and join in  affinity with the peoples of these abominations? wouldest thou  not be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there  should be no remnant nor any to escape?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we are a  remnant that is escaped, as [it is] this day. Behold, we are  before thee in our trespasses; for there is no standing before  thee because of this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;And while Ezra prayed, and made confession, weeping and  falling down before the house of God, there were gathered to  him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women  and children; for the people wept very much.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam,  answered and said to Ezra, We have acted unfaithfully toward  our God, and have taken foreign wives of the peoples of the  land; yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;And now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all  the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the  counsel of [my] lord, and of those that tremble at the  commandments of our God; and let it be done according to the  law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;Arise, for this matter is incumbent on thee, and we will be  with thee: be of good courage, and do [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the priests, of the  Levites, and of all Israel, to swear that they would do  according to this word. And they swore.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;And Ezra arose from before the house of God, and went into  the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came  thither, he ate no bread and drank no water; for he mourned  because of the unfaithfulness of them that had been carried  away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;And they made proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to all  the children of the captivity, that they should gather  themselves together unto Jerusalem;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;and that whosoever would not come within three days,  according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his  substance should be confiscated, and himself separated from the  congregation of those that had been carried away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;Then were all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered  together at Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth  month, on the twentieth of the month; and all the people sat in  the open space of the house of God, trembling because of the  matter, and because of the pouring rain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, Ye have  acted unfaithfully, and have taken foreign wives, to increase  the trespass of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;And now make confession to Jehovah the God of your  fathers, and do his pleasure, and separate yourselves from the  peoples of the land, and from the foreign wives.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;And the whole congregation answered and said with a loud  voice, Yes, it is for us to do according to thy words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;But the people are many, and it is a time of pouring rain,  and it is not possible to stand without: neither is this a work  for one day or two; for we are many that have transgressed in  this thing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;Let now our princes, while this matter is going on, stand  for all the congregation, and let all those that have taken  foreign wives in our cities come at the appointed times, and  with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof,  until the fierce anger of our God be turned from us.</p>
