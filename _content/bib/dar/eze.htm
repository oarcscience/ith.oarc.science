<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth  [month], on the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives  by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions  of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;On the fifth of the month, (it was the fifth year of king  Jehoiachin's captivity,)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest,  the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river  Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the  north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a  brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the  look of glowing brass, out of the midst of the fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Also out of the midst thereof, the likeness of four living  creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness  of a man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four  wings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their  feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled as  the look of burnished brass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their  four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when  they went; they went every one straight forward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man; and  they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they  four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also  the face of an eagle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And their faces and their wings were parted above; two  [wings] of every one were joined one to another, and two  covered their bodies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And they went every one straight forward: whither the  Spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their  appearance was like burning coals of fire, as the appearance of  torches: it went up and down among the living creatures; and  the fire was bright; and out of the fire went forth lightning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance  of a flash of lightning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And I looked at the living creatures, and behold, one wheel  upon the earth beside the living creatures, toward their four  faces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;The appearance of the wheels and their work was as the look  of a chrysolite; and they four had one likeness; and their  appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle  of a wheel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;When they went, they went upon their four sides; they  turned not when they went.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they  four had their rims full of eyes round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside  them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the  earth, the wheels were lifted up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Whithersoever the Spirit was to go, they went, thither  would [their] spirit go; and the wheels were lifted up along  with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the  wheels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;When those went, they went; and when those stood, they  stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels  were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living  creature was in the wheels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;And there was the likeness of an expanse over the heads of  the living creature, as the look of the terrible crystal,  stretched forth over their heads above.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;And under the expanse were their wings straight, the one  toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side,  and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like  the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, a  tumultuous noise, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they  let down their wings;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;and there was a voice from above the expanse that was over  their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;And above the expanse that was over their heads was the  likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone;  and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the  appearance of a man above upon it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;And I saw as the look of glowing brass, as the appearance  of fire, within it round about; from the appearance of his  loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and  downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had  brightness round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the  day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round  about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of  Jehovah. And when I saw, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice  of one that spoke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I  will speak with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me, and  set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spoke unto me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children  of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled  against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me  unto this very day;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;and these children are impudent and hard-hearted: I am  sending thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus  saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And they, whether they will hear or whether they will  forbear -- for they are a rebellious house -- yet shall they  know that there hath been a prophet among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, and be not  afraid of their words; for briars and thorns are with thee, and  thou dwellest among scorpions: be not afraid of their words,  and be not dismayed at their faces; for they are a rebellious  house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will  hear or whether they will forbear; for they are rebellious.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou  rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat  that I give thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and behold, a hand was put forth toward me;  and behold, a roll of a book therein.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And he spread it out before me; and it was written within  and without; and there were written in it lamentations, and  mourning, and woe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; eat  this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and  fill thy bowels with this roll which I give thee. And I ate,  and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house  of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;For thou art not sent to a people of strange language, and  of difficult speech, [but] to the house of Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;not to many peoples of strange language and of difficult  speech, whose words thou canst not understand: had I sent thee  to them, would they not hearken unto thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee, for none  of them will hearken unto me. For all the house of Israel are  hard of forehead and stiff of heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and  thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead.  Fear them not, neither be dismayed at them, for they are a  rebellious house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, all my words which I shall  speak unto thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine  ears;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;and go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the  children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them,  Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, -- whether they will hear or  whether they will forbear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the  sound of a great rushing, [saying,] Blessed be the glory of  Jehovah from his place!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;-- and the sound of the wings of the living creatures that  touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them,  and the sound of a great rushing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went  in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of  Jehovah was strong upon me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt  by the river Chebar, and I sat where they sat; and I sat there  astonied among them seven days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word  of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;Son of man, I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house  of Israel, and thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and give  them warning from me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt certainly die; and  thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked  from his wicked way, that he may live: the same wicked [man]  shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy  hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;But if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his  wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his  iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;And when a righteous [man] doth turn from his  righteousness, and do what is wrong, and I lay a  stumbling-block before him, he shall die; because thou hast not  given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous  acts which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood  will I require at thy hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;And if thou warn the righteous [man], that the righteous  sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall certainly live, for he  hath taken warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto  me, Arise, go forth into the valley, and there I will talk with  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;And I arose, and went forth into the valley, and behold,  the glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory which I saw by  the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;And the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet;  and he spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within  thy house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon  thee, and shall bind thee therewith, and thou shalt not go out  among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth,  that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover;  for they are a rebellious house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;And when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou  shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that  heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear:  for they are a rebellious house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, take thee a brick, and lay it before  thee, and portray upon it a city, -- Jerusalem:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and  cast a mound against it, and set camps against it, and place  battering-rams against it round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And take thou unto thee an iron plate, and put it [for] a  wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face  against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege  against it: this shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And thou, lie upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of  the house of Israel upon it: the number of the days that thou  liest upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And I have appointed thee the years of their iniquity,  according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety  days; and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And when thou hast accomplished them, thou shalt lie again  on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the  house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a  year.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem,  and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy  against it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn  thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast ended the  days of thy siege.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;And thou, take unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and  lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and  make thee bread thereof, [according to] the number of the days  that thou liest upon thy side: three hundred and ninety days  shalt thou eat thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight,  twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a  hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt eat it [as] barley-cake, and thou shalt bake  it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said, So shall the children of Israel eat their  bread unclean among the nations whither I will drive them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul hath not  been defiled, and from my youth up even until now have I not  eaten of that which dieth of itself, or of that which is torn;  neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow's dung for  man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I break the staff  of bread in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight, and  with anxiety; and they shall drink water by measure, and with  astonishment:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;because bread and water shall fail them, and they shall be  astonied one with another, and waste away in their iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife; a barber's  razor shalt thou take; and cause it to pass upon thy head and  upon thy beard: and thou shalt take balances to weigh, and  divide the [hair].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the  city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt  take a third part, [and] smite about it with a knife; and a  third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out  a sword after them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them  in thy skirts;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;and thou shalt take of these again, and cast them into the  midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire: from it shall a  fire come forth against all the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem: I have set  her in the midst of the nations, and the countries are round  about her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And she hath rebelled against my judgments in wickedness  more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the  countries that are round about her: for mine ordinances have  they refused; and my statutes, they have not walked in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have been  turbulent more than the nations that are round about you, [and]  have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept mine  ordinances, nor [even] have done according to the ordinances of  the nations that are round about you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am  against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee  in the sight of the nations;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;and I will do in thee that which I have not done, and  whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine  abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of  thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute  judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter  to all the winds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily  because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable  things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also  withdraw mine eye, and it shall not spare, nor will I have any  pity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;A third part of thee shall die by the pestilence, and shall  be consumed by the famine in the midst of thee; and a third  part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will  scatter a third part to all the winds, and I will draw out a  sword after them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;And mine anger shall be accomplished, and I will satisfy my  fury upon them, and I will comfort myself; and they shall know  that I Jehovah have spoken in my jealousy, when I have  accomplished my fury upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And I will make thee a waste and a reproach among the  nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that  pass by.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;And it shall be a reproach, and a taunt, an instruction,  and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee,  when I shall execute judgments upon thee in anger, and in fury,  and in furious rebukes: I, Jehovah, have spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;When I send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are  for [their] destruction, which I send to destroy you, then will  I increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of  bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, which  shall bereave thee of children; and pestilence and blood shall  pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee: I,  Jehovah, have spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and  prophesy against them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;and say, Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord  Jehovah: thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to  the hills, to the water-courses and to the valleys: Behold, I,  [even] I, do bring a sword upon you, and will destroy your high  places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;And your altars shall be desolate, and your sun-images shall  be broken; and I will cast down your slain [men] before your  idols;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;and I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel  before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about  your altars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste,  and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be  laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and  cease, and your sun-images may be cut down, and your works may  be abolished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall  know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some  escaped from the sword among the nations, when ye shall be  scattered through the countries.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And they that escape of you shall remember me among the  nations whither they have been carried captives, when I shall  have broken their whorish heart, which hath departed from me,  and their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols; and they  shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have  committed, in all their abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And they shall know that I [am] Jehovah: I have not said in  vain that I would do this evil unto them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp  with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the abominations of the  iniquities of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the  sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that  is near shall fall by the sword; and he that is left, and is  besieged, shall die by the famine: and I will accomplish my  fury upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;And ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when their slain  shall be among their idols, round about their altars, upon  every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under  every green tree, and under every thick terebinth, the places  where they offered sweet savour to all their idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;And I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land  desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness of Diblath, in  all their dwellings; and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the  land of Israel: An end, the end is come upon the four corners  of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Now is the end upon thee; and I will send mine anger upon  thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will bring  upon thee all thine abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity;  but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations  shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I [am]  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil! behold,  it is come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;The end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee:  behold, it cometh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;The doom is come unto thee, inhabitant of the land; the time  is come, the day is near, -- tumult, and not the joyous cry  from the mountains.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Now will I soon pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish  mine anger against thee; and I will judge thee according to thy  ways, and will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;They have blown the trumpet and made all ready, but none  goeth to the battle; for my fierce anger is upon all the  multitude thereof.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth [month],  on the fifth of the month, that [as] I sat in my house, and the  elders of Judah sat before me, the hand of the Lord Jehovah  fell there upon me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of  fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and  from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as  the look of glowing brass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And he stretched forth the form of a hand, and took me by a  lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth  and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to  Jerusalem, to the entry of the inner gate that looketh toward  the north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which  provoketh to jealousy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there,  according to the appearance that I saw in the valley.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, lift up now thine eyes  toward the north. And I lifted up mine eyes toward the north,  and behold, northward of the gate of the altar, this image of  jealousy in the entry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?  the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, to  cause [me] to go far off from my sanctuary? And yet again thou  shalt see great abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;And he brought me to the entry of the court, and I looked,  and behold, a hole in the wall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, dig now through the wall;  and I digged through the wall, and behold, a door.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked  abominations that they do here.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And I went in and looked, and behold, every form of  creeping thing and abominable beast, and all the idols of the  house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of  the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah  the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and  a thick cloud of incense went up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Hast thou seen, son of man, what the  elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every one in his  chambers of imagery? for they say, Jehovah seeth us not;  Jehovah hath forsaken the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Yet again thou shalt see great  abominations which they do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And he brought me to the entry of the gate of Jehovah's  house that was toward the north; and behold, there sat women  weeping for Tammuz.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Seest thou, son of man? Thou shalt yet  again see greater abominations than these.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovah's house,  and behold, at the entry of the temple of Jehovah, between the  porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their  backs toward the temple of Jehovah and their faces toward the  east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Seest thou, son of man? Is it a light  thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which  they commit here, that they yet fill the land with violence,  and keep provoking me afresh to anger? And behold, they put the  branch to their nose.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;And I also will deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,  neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with  a loud voice, I will not hear them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Draw  near, ye that have charge of the city, and every man [with] his  destroying weapon in his hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate,  which is turned toward the north, and every man [with] his  slaughter weapon in his hand; and in the midst of them, one man  clothed with linen, with a writer's ink-horn by his side; and  they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the  cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and he  called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer's  ink-horn by his side;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,  through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the  foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the  abominations that are done in the midst thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And to the others he said in my hearing, Go after him  through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither  have pity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;Slay utterly the old man, the young man, and the maiden, and  little children, and women; but come not near any man upon whom  is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the  elders who were before the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts  with the slain: go forth. And they went forth, and smote in the  city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was  left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah, Lord  Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the remnant of Israel in thy  pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and  Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and  the city full of perverseness; for they say, Jehovah hath  forsaken the earth, and Jehovah seeth not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will  I have pity: I will recompense their way upon their head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;And behold, the man clothed with linen, who had the  ink-horn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done  as thou hast commanded me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and behold, in the expanse that was over the  head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a  sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;And he spoke unto the man clothed with linen, and said,  Come in between the wheels, under the cherub, and fill the  hollow of thy hands with coals of fire from between the  cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my  sight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;And the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when  the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, [and  came] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled  with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of  Jehovah's glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard to the  outer court, as the voice of the Almighty &#249;God when he  speaketh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass when he had commanded the man clothed  with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from  between the cherubim, then he went in, and stood beside the  wheel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the  cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took  and put it into the hands of him [that was] clothed with linen;  who took [it], and went out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand  under their wings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim,  one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another  cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was as the look of a  chrysolite stone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness,  as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;When they went, they went upon their four sides; they  turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head  looked they followed it: they turned not as they went.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands,  and their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes round about,  in them four [and] their wheels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, Galgal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;And every one had four faces: the first face was the face  of a cherub, and the second face the face of a man, and the  third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;And the cherubim mounted up. This was the living creature  that I saw by the river Chebar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them;  and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from  the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up,  these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living  creature was in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;And the glory of Jehovah departed from over the threshold  of the house, and stood over the cherubim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up  from the earth in my sight, when they went out; and the wheels  were beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate  of Jehovah's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over  them above.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;This is the living creature that I saw under the God of  Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;Each one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the  likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the  faces which I had seen by the river Chebar -- their appearance  and themselves: they went every one straight before them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east  gate of Jehovah's house, which looketh eastward; and behold, at  the door of the gate were five and twenty men; and I saw in the  midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son  of Benaiah, princes of the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that  devise iniquity, and give wicked counsel in this city:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;who say, It is not the time to build houses: this is the  cauldron, and we are the flesh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;And the Spirit of Jehovah fell on me, and said unto me,  Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of  Israel; and the things that come into your mind, I know them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have  filled the streets thereof with the slain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye  have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and it is the  cauldron; but you will I bring forth out of the midst of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;Ye have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword upon  you, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and give you  into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among  you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the  borders of Israel; and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;This shall not be your cauldron, neither shall ye be the  flesh in the midst of it: I will judge you in the borders of  Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah, in whose statutes  ye have not walked, neither have done mine ordinances, but have  done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about  you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the  son of Benaiah died. And I fell down on my face, and cried with  a loud voice, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full  end of the remnant of Israel?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;Son of man, [it is] thy brethren, thy brethren, the men of  thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, the whole of it, unto  whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem say, Get you far from  Jehovah: unto us is this land given for a possession.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Although I  have removed them far off among the nations, and although I  have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them  as a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even  gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the  countries where ye are scattered, and I will give you the land  of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;And they shall come thither, and they shall take away from  thence all its detestable things and all its abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new  spirit within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of  their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine  ordinances, and do them; and they shall be my people, and I  will be their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;But as for them whose heart walketh well-pleased with  their detestable things and their abominations, I will  recompense their way upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels  were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over  them above.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the  city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of  the city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision  by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity;  and the vision that I had seen went up from me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;And I spoke unto them of the captivity all the things that  Jehovah had shewn me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious  house, which have eyes to see, and see not, which have ears to  hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, prepare thee a captive's baggage, and  go captive by day in their sight; and thou shalt go captive  from thy place to another place in their sight. It may be they  will consider, though they are a rebellious house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;And bring forth thy baggage by day in their sight, as a  captive's baggage, and thou thyself, go forth at even in their  sight as they that go forth into captivity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out  thereby.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;In their sight shalt thou bear [it] upon [thy] shoulder,  and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, and  thou shalt not see the ground: for I have appointed thee for a  sign unto the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my baggage  by day, as a captive's baggage, and in the even I digged  through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark,  [and] bore it upon [my] shoulder, in their sight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;And in the morning the word of Jehovah came unto me,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious  house, said unto thee, What doest thou?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden  [concerneth] the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of  Israel that are among them.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;And the prince that is among them shall bear upon [his]  shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth; they shall dig  through the wall to carry out thereby; he shall cover his face,  that he see not the land with [his] eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken  in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the  Chaldeans; but he shall not see it, and there shall he die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about  him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the  sword after them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;And they shall know that I [am] Jehovah when I shall  scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the  countries.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from  the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all  their abominations among the nations whither they shall come;  and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord  Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, in the land of  Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink  their water with astonishment, because her land shall be left  desolate of all that is in it, for the violence of all them  that dwell therein.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and  the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I [am]  Jehovah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will  make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a  proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and  the accomplishment of every vision.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:24">12:24</A>&nbsp;For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering  divination in the midst of the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:25">12:25</A>&nbsp;For I [am] Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I  shall speak shall be performed, it shall be no more deferred.  For in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word and  will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:26">12:26</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:27">12:27</A>&nbsp;Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The  vision that he seeth is for many days, and he prophesieth of  times that are far off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:28">12:28</A>&nbsp;Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah:  There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word  that I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that  prophesy, and say unto them that prophesy out of their own  heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe unto the foolish prophets,  that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in desert  places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;Ye have not gone up into the breaches, nor made up the  fence for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the  day of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;They have seen vanity and lying divination, that say,  Jehovah saith! and Jehovah hath not sent them; and they make  [them] to hope that the word will be fulfilled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;Have ye not seen a vain vision, and spoken a lying  divination, when ye say, Jehovah saith; and I have not spoken?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye speak  vanity, and have seen lies, therefore behold, I am against you,  saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;And my hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity  and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my  people, neither shall they be written in the register of the  house of Israel, and they shall not enter into the land of  Israel: and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;Because, yea because they have seduced my people, saying,  Peace! and there is no peace; and one buildeth up a wall, and  lo, they daub it with untempered [mortar] --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;say unto them which daub it with untempered [mortar] that  it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing rain, and ye, O  great hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall burst  forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;And lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto  you, Where is the daubing with which ye have daubed [it]?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will cause to  burst forth a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an  overflowing rain in mine anger, and hail-stones in fury for  utter destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;And I will break down the wall that ye have daubed with  untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that  the foundation thereof shall be discovered; and it shall fall,  and ye shall be destroyed in the midst thereof; and ye shall  know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;And I will accomplish my fury upon the wall, and upon them  that daub it with untempered [mortar], and will say unto you,  The wall is no [more], neither they that daubed it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem,  and who see a vision of peace for her, and there is no peace,  saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters  of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and  prophesy against them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe unto the women  that sew pillows for all wrists, and that make veils for the  head [of persons] of every stature to catch souls! Will ye  catch the souls of my people, and will ye save your own souls  alive?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:19">13:19</A>&nbsp;And will ye profane me among my people for handfuls of  barley and for morsels of bread, to slay the souls that should  not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by  your lying to my people that listen to lying?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:20">13:20</A>&nbsp;Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am  against your pillows, that the souls which ye catch by their  means may fly away; and I will tear them from your arms, and  will let the souls go, the souls that ye catch, that they may  fly away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;And I will tear your veils and deliver my people out of  your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted;  and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;Because with falsehood ye have grieved the heart of the  righteous, whom I have not made sad; and have strengthened the  hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked  way, to save his life:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;therefore ye shall no more see vanity, nor divine  divinations; and I will deliver my people out of your hand: and  ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;And there came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and  sat before me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their  heart, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before  their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;Therefore speak to them, and say unto them, Thus saith the  Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up  his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his  iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet, I Jehovah  will answer him according to this, according to the multitude  of his idols:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;that I may take the house of Israel by their own heart,  because they are all estranged from me through their idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord  Jehovah: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and  turn away your faces from all your abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers  that sojourn in Israel, who separateth himself from me, and  setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the  stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to  the prophet to inquire of me by him, I Jehovah will answer him  by myself;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;and I will set my face against that man, and will make him  desolate, [so that he shall be] for a sign and for proverbs,  and I will cut him off from the midst of my people: and ye  shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;And if the prophet be enticed and shall speak a word, I  Jehovah have enticed that prophet; and I will stretch out my  hand against him, and will destroy him from the midst of my  people Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the  prophet shall be even as the iniquity of the inquirer;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me,  neither make themselves any more unclean with all their  transgressions; and they shall be my people, and I will be  their God, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by working  unfaithfulness, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break  the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and  cut off man and beast from it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, should be  in it, they should deliver [but] their own souls by their  righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;-- though these three men should be in it, [as] I live,  saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor  daughters: they only should be delivered, and the land should  be a desolation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;Or [if] I bring the sword upon that land, and say, Sword,  go through the land, so that I cut off man and beast from it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:18">14:18</A>&nbsp;and these three men should be in it, [as] I live, saith  the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor  daughters, but they only themselves should be delivered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:19">14:19</A>&nbsp;Or [if] I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out  my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;and Noah, Daniel, and Job should be in it, [as] I live,  saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor  daughter: they should [but] deliver their own souls by their  righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:21">14:21</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send  my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the  famine, and the evil beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from  it man and beast!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:22">14:22</A>&nbsp;But behold, there shall be left in it those that escape,  who shall be brought out of [it], sons and daughters. Behold,  they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and  their doings; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil  that I have brought upon Jerusalem, as to all that I have  brought upon it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:23">14:23</A>&nbsp;And they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and  their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without  cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto Jerusalem: Thy  birth and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite: thy  father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy  navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water for  cleansing; thou wast not rubbed with salt at all, nor swaddled  at all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;No eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have  compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field,  from abhorrence of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;And I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood,  and I said unto thee, in thy blood, Live! yea, I said unto  thee, in thy blood, Live!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;I caused thee to multiply, as the bud of the field; and  thou didst increase and grow great, and thou camest to fulness  of beauty; [thy] breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew: but  thou wast naked and bare.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;And I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, and behold, thy  time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and  covered thy nakedness; and I swore unto thee, and entered into  a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou becamest  mine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;And I washed thee with water, and thoroughly washed away  thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;and I clothed thee with embroidered work, and shod thee  with badgers' skin, and I bound thee about with byssus, and  covered thee with silk.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon  thy hands, and a chain on thy neck;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;and I put a ring on thy nose, and earrings in thine ears,  and a beautiful crown upon thy head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver, and thy  raiment was byssus, and silk, and embroidered work. Thou didst  eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou becamest  exceedingly beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;And thy fame went forth among the nations for thy beauty;  for it was perfect through my magnificence, which I had put  upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;But thou didst confide in thy beauty, and playedst the  harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on  every one that passed by: his it was.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;And of thy garments thou didst take, and madest for  thyself high places decked with divers colours, and didst play  the harlot thereupon: [the like] hath not come to pass, and  shall be no more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;And thou didst take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my  silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of  males, and didst commit fornication with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;And thou tookest thine embroidered garments, and coveredst  them; and thou didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;And my bread which I had given thee, the fine flour and  the oil and the honey wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set  it before them for a sweet savour: thus it was, saith the Lord  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;And thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou  hadst borne unto me, and these didst thou sacrifice unto them,  to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:21">16:21</A>&nbsp;that thou didst slay my children and give them up in  passing them over to them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:22">16:22</A>&nbsp;And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast  not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and  bare, when thou wast weltering in thy blood.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:24">16:24</A>&nbsp;that thou didst also build unto thee a place of  debauchery, and didst make thee a high place in every street:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:25">16:25</A>&nbsp;thou didst build thy high place at every head of the way,  and madest thy beauty to be abhorred, and thou didst open thy  feet to every one that passed by, and multiply thy whoredom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:26">16:26</A>&nbsp;And thou didst commit fornication with the Egyptians thy  neighbours, great of flesh; and didst multiply thy whoredom to  provoke me to anger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:27">16:27</A>&nbsp;And behold, I stretched out my hand over thee, and  diminished thine appointed portion; and I gave thee over unto  the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the  Philistines, who were confounded at thy lewd way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:28">16:28</A>&nbsp;And thou didst commit fornication with the Assyrians,  because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou didst commit  fornication with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:29">16:29</A>&nbsp;And thou didst multiply thy whoredom with the land of  merchants, Chaldea, and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:30">16:30</A>&nbsp;How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing thou  doest all these [things], the work of a whorish woman, under no  restraint;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:31">16:31</A>&nbsp;in that thou buildest thy place of debauchery at the head  of every way, and makest thy high place in every street! And  thou hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest reward,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:32">16:32</A>&nbsp;O adulterous wife, that taketh strangers instead of her  husband.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:33">16:33</A>&nbsp;They give rewards to all harlots; but thou gavest thy  rewards to all thy lovers, and rewardedst them, that they might  come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:34">16:34</A>&nbsp;And in thee is the contrary from [other] women, in thy  whoredoms, in that none followeth thee to commit fornication;  and whereas thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto  thee, so art thou contrary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:35">16:35</A>&nbsp;Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:36">16:36</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy money hath been  poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy  fornications with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thine  abominations, and because of the blood of thy children which  thou didst give unto them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:37">16:37</A>&nbsp;therefore, behold, I will gather all thy lovers with whom  thou hast taken pleasure, and all that thou hast loved, with  all that thou hast hated, -- I will even gather them round  about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them,  that they may see all thy nakedness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:38">16:38</A>&nbsp;And I will judge thee with the judgments of women that  commit adultery and shed blood; and I will give thee up to the  blood of fury and jealousy;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:39">16:39</A>&nbsp;and I will give thee into their hand, and they shall throw  down thy place of debauchery, and shall break down thy high  places; and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall  take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:40">16:40</A>&nbsp;And they shall bring up an assemblage against thee, and  they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with  their swords.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:41">16:41</A>&nbsp;And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute  judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will  cause thee to cease from being a harlot, and thou also shalt  give no more any reward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:42">16:42</A>&nbsp;And I will appease my fury against thee, and my jealousy  shall depart from thee; and I will be quiet, and will be no  more angry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:43">16:43</A>&nbsp;Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth,  but hast raged against me in all these [things], behold,  therefore, I also will recompense thy way upon [thy] head,  saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou shalt not commit this lewdness  besides all thine abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:44">16:44</A>&nbsp;Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall speak in a  proverb against thee, saying, As the mother, [so is] her  daughter!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:45">16:45</A>&nbsp;Thou art the daughter of thy mother that loathed her  husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy  sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your  mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:46">16:46</A>&nbsp;And thine elder sister is Samaria that dwelleth at thy  left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that  dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:53">16:53</A>&nbsp;And I will bring again their captivity, the captivity of  Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her  daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of  them;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto  the house of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with  great wings, long-pinioned, full of feathers, which was of  divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch  of the cedar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;He cropped off the top of its young shoots, and carried it  into a merchants' land; he set it in a city of traders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;And he took of the seed of the land, and planted it in a  fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, he set it as a  willow tree.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, so  that its branches should turn toward him, and the roots thereof  be under him; and it became a vine, and brought forth branches,  and shot forth sprigs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;And there was another great eagle with great wings and many  feathers; and behold, from the beds of her plantation, this  vine did bend her roots unto him, and shot forth her branches  toward him, that he might water it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;It was planted in a good field by many waters, that it  might bring forth branches and bear fruit, that it might be a  noble vine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;Say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? Shall  he not pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may  wither? All its fresh sprouting leaves shall wither, even  without a great arm and many people to pluck it up by its  roots.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;And behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not  utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it? It shall wither  in the beds where it grew.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these  things are? Say, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem,  and took its king and its princes, and led them with him to  Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;And he took of the king's seed, and made a covenant with  him, and brought him under an oath, and he took away the mighty  of the land;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;that the kingdom might be abased, that it might not lift  itself up, that it might keep his covenant in order to stand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:15">17:15</A>&nbsp;But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors  into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people.  Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall  he break the covenant, and yet escape?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:16">17:16</A>&nbsp;[As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily in the place  of the king that made him king, whose oath he despised, and  whose covenant he broke, even with him, in the midst of  Babylon, shall he die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:17">17:17</A>&nbsp;Neither shall Pharaoh with a mighty army and a great  assemblage do anything for him in the war, when they cast up  mounds and build forts to cut off many persons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:18">17:18</A>&nbsp;He despised the oath, and broke the covenant; and behold,  he had given his hand, yet hath he done all these things: he  shall not escape.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:19">17:19</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: [As] I live,  verily, mine oath which he hath despised, and my covenant which  he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:20">17:20</A>&nbsp;And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken  in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter  into judgment with him there for his unfaithfulness in which he  hath been unfaithful against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:21">17:21</A>&nbsp;And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the  sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every  wind; and ye shall know that I Jehovah have spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:22">17:22</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also take of the  highest branch of the lofty cedar, and will set it; I will crop  off from the top of its young shoots a tender one, and I will  plant it upon a high and eminent mountain:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:23">17:23</A>&nbsp;upon the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it;  and it shall bring forth branches, and bear fruit, and become a  noble cedar; and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing;  in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:24">17:24</A>&nbsp;And all the trees of the field shall know that I Jehovah  have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree,  have dried up the green tree, and made the dry tree to  flourish: I Jehovah have spoken, and will do [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;What mean ye, ye who use this proverb of the land of  Israel, saying, [The] fathers eat sour grapes, and the  children's teeth are set on edge?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;[As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, ye shall not have any  more to use this proverb in Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;Behold, all the souls are mine; as the soul of the father,  so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it  shall die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;And if a man be righteous, and do judgment and justice:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;-- he hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his  eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled  his neighbour's wife, nor come near to a woman in her  separation,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;and hath not oppressed any; he hath restored to the debtor  his pledge, hath not exercised robbery, hath given his bread to  the hungry, and covered the naked with a garment;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;he hath not given forth upon usury, nor taken increase; he  hath withdrawn his hand from unrighteousness, hath executed  true judgment between man and man,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;hath walked in my statutes, and kept mine ordinances, to  deal faithfully: he is righteous, he shall certainly live,  saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;And if he have begotten a son that is violent, a shedder  of blood, and that doeth only one of any of these [things],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;and that doeth not any of those [duties], but also hath  eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;hath oppressed the poor and needy, exercised robbery, hath  not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the  idols, committed abomination,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;given forth upon usury, and taken increase; shall he then  live? He shall not live: he hath done all these abominations;  he shall certainly die; his blood shall be upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;But lo, if he have begotten a son that seeth all his  father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth  not such like:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;-- he hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his  eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; he hath not defiled  his neighbour's wife,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;and hath not oppressed any, nor withholden the pledge,  neither hath exercised robbery; he hath given his bread to the  hungry, and covered the naked with a garment;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;he hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, hath not  received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, [and]  walked in my statutes: he shall not die for the iniquity of his  father, he shall certainly live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:18">18:18</A>&nbsp;As for his father, because he practised oppression,  exercised robbery upon his brother, and did what was not good  among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:19">18:19</A>&nbsp;And ye say, Why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the  father? But the son hath done judgment and justice, hath kept  all my statutes, and hath done them; he shall certainly live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:20">18:20</A>&nbsp;The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not  bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear  the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous  shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be  upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:21">18:21</A>&nbsp;And the wicked, if he turn from all his sins which he hath  committed, and keep all my statutes, and do judgment and  justice, he shall certainly live, he shall not die.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:24">18:24</A>&nbsp;And when the righteous turneth from his righteousness and  practiseth what is wrong, [and] doeth according to all the  abominations that the wicked doeth, shall he live?

<p><A NAME="an_18:25">18:25</A>&nbsp;And ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear then,  house of Israel. Is not my way equal? are not your ways  unequal?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:26">18:26</A>&nbsp;When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,  and practiseth what is wrong, and dieth for it; in his wrong  that he hath done shall he die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:27">18:27</A>&nbsp;And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness which he  hath committed, and doeth judgment and justice, he shall keep  his soul alive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:28">18:28</A>&nbsp;Because he considereth, and turneth from all his  transgressions which he hath committed, he shall certainly  live, he shall not die.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:31">18:31</A>&nbsp;Cast away from you all your transgressions wherewith ye  have transgressed, and make you a new heart and a new spirit:  why then will ye die, house of Israel?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:32">18:32</A>&nbsp;For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth,  saith the Lord Jehovah; therefore turn ye and live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;And thou, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of  Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among  lions, she nourished her whelps in the midst of the young  lions.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;And she brought up one of her whelps; it became a young  lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;And the nations heard of him; he was taken in their pit,  and they brought him with nose-rings into the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;And when she saw that she had waited [and] her hope was  lost, she took another of her whelps, [and] made him a young  lion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young  lion, and learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;And he knew their [desolate] palaces, and he laid waste  their cities, so that the land was desolate, and all it  contained, by the noise of his roaring.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;Then the nations set against him on every side from the  provinces, and spread their net over him; he was taken in their  pit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;And they put him in a cage with nose-rings, and brought him  to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that  his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;Thy mother was as a vine, in thy rest, planted by the  waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many  waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;And it had strong rods for sceptres of them that bear  rule, and its stature was exalted between the thick boughs; and  it was conspicuous by its height with the multitude of its  branches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the  ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit; its strong rods  were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and  thirsty ground:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;and a fire is gone out of a rod of its branches, [which]  hath devoured its fruit; so that it hath no strong rod to be a  sceptre for ruling. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a  lamentation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth  [month], the tenth of the month, [that] certain of the elders  of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and they sat before me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto  them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Are ye come to inquire of  me? [As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired  of by you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou judge them, wilt thou judge, son of man? Cause  them to know the abominations of their fathers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day  when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand unto the seed of the  house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of  Egypt, when I lifted up my hand unto them, saying, I [am]  Jehovah your God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;in that day I lifted up my hand unto them, to bring them  out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for  them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the ornament of all  lands;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;and I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the  abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the  idols of Egypt: I [am] Jehovah your God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto  me: none of them cast away the abominations of his eyes,  neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I thought to  pour out my fury upon them, so as to accomplish mine anger  against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be  profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they were, in  whose sight I had made myself known unto them in bringing them  forth out of the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;And I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,  and brought them into the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;And I gave them my statutes, and made known unto them mine  ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;And I also gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me  and them, that they might know that I [am] Jehovah that hallow  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the  wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected  mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them; and  my sabbaths they greatly profaned: and I said I would pour out  my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be  profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had  brought them out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;And I also lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness,  that I would not bring them into the land that I had given  [them], flowing with milk and honey, which is the ornament of  all lands;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;because they rejected mine ordinances and walked not in my  statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after  their idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:17">20:17</A>&nbsp;But mine eye spared them so as not to destroy them,  neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:18">20:18</A>&nbsp;And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk not  in the statutes of your fathers, neither keep their ordinances,  nor defile yourselves with their idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:19">20:19</A>&nbsp;I [am] Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep  mine ordinances, and do them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:20">20:20</A>&nbsp;and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between  me and you, that ye may know that I [am] Jehovah your God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:21">20:21</A>&nbsp;And the children rebelled against me: they walked not in  my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if  a man do, he shall live by them; they profaned my sabbaths: and  I said I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish mine  anger against them in the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:22">20:22</A>&nbsp;But I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name's sake,  that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in  whose sight I had brought them out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:23">20:23</A>&nbsp;I lifted up my hand also unto them in the wilderness, that  I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them  through the countries;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:24">20:24</A>&nbsp;because they performed not mine ordinances, and rejected  my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were  after their fathers' idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:25">20:25</A>&nbsp;And I also gave them statutes that were not good, and  ordinances whereby they should not live;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:26">20:26</A>&nbsp;and I defiled them by their own gifts, in that they  devoted all that opened the womb, that I might make them  desolate, to the end that they might know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:27">20:27</A>&nbsp;Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and  say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover  have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have wrought  unfaithfulness against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:28">20:28</A>&nbsp;When I had brought them into the land which I had lifted  up my hand to give unto them, then they saw every high hill and  all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices,  and there they presented the provocation of their offering; and  there they placed their sweet savour, and there poured out  their drink-offerings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:29">20:29</A>&nbsp;And I said unto them, What is the high place whither ye  go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:30">20:30</A>&nbsp;Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the  Lord Jehovah: Do ye defile yourselves after the manner of your  fathers? and do ye commit fornication after their abominations?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:31">20:31</A>&nbsp;And when ye offer your gifts, making your sons to pass  through the fire, ye defile yourselves with all your idols,  even unto this day; and shall I be inquired of by you, O house  of Israel?

<p><A NAME="an_20:32">20:32</A>&nbsp;And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all,  that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the  countries, in serving wood and stone.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_20:35">20:35</A>&nbsp;and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples,  and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:36">20:36</A>&nbsp;Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the  wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment  with you, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:37">20:37</A>&nbsp;And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will  bring you into the bond of the covenant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:38">20:38</A>&nbsp;And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them  that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the  country where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the  land of Israel: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:39">20:39</A>&nbsp;As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord  Jehovah: Go ye, serve every one his idols henceforth also, if  none of you will hearken unto me; but profane my holy name no  more with your gifts and with your idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:40">20:40</A>&nbsp;For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of  Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of  Israel serve me, the whole of it, in the land; there will I  accept them, and there will I require your heave-offerings and  the first-fruits of your offerings, with all your holy things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:41">20:41</A>&nbsp;As a sweet savour will I accept you, when I bring you out  from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein  ye have been scattered; and I will be hallowed in you in the  sight of the nations.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_20:45">20:45</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold,  I am against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of its  sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the  wicked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;Seeing that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the  wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath  against all flesh, from the south to the north;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;and all flesh shall know that I Jehovah have drawn forth my  sword out of its sheath: it shall not return any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;Sigh then, thou son of man; with breaking of the loins, and  with bitterness sigh before their eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore dost  thou sigh? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it  cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be  feeble, and every spirit shall languish, and all knees shall  melt into water: behold, it cometh; it is here, saith the Lord  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, A  sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;It is sharpened for sore slaughter, it is furbished that  it may glitter. Shall we then make mirth, [saying,] The sceptre  of my son contemneth all wood?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;And he hath given it to be furbished that it may be  handled. The sword, -- it is sharpened, and it is furbished to  give it into the hand of the slayer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;Cry and howl, son of man; for it shall be against my  people, it shall be against all the princes of Israel: they are  given up to the sword along with my people: smite therefore  upon the thigh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;For the trial [is made]; and what if even the contemning  sceptre shall be no [more]? saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands  together; for [the strokes of] the sword shall be doubled the  third time: it is the sword of the slain, the sword that hath  slain the great one, which encompasseth them privily.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;In order that the heart may melt, and the stumbling-blocks  be multiplied, I have set the threatening sword against all  their gates: ah! it is made glittering, it is whetted for the  slaughter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;Gather up [strength], go to the right hand, turn thee, go  to the left, whithersoever thy face is appointed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;And I myself will smite my hands together, and I will  satisfy my fury: I Jehovah have spoken [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, set thee two ways, by which the  sword of the king of Babylon may come -- out of one land shall  they both come -- and make thee a signpost, make it at the head  of the way to the city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;Appoint a way for the coming of the sword to Rabbah of the  children of Ammon, and to Judah at the fenced [city] of  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;For the king of Babylon standeth at the parting of the  way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shaketh  [his] arrows, he inquireth of the teraphim, he looketh in the  liver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;In his right hand is the lot of Jerusalem to appoint  battering-rams, to open the mouth for bloodshed, to lift up the  voice with shouting, to appoint battering-rams against the  gates, to cast mounds, to build siege-towers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;And this shall be a false divination in their sight, for  them that have sworn oaths; but he will call to remembrance the  iniquity, that they may be taken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye make  your iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are  discovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear;  because ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the  hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;And thou, profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day is  come, at the time of the iniquity of the end,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:26">21:26</A>&nbsp;-- thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Remove the mitre and take  off the crown; what is shall be no [more]. Exalt that which is  low, and abase that which is high.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:27">21:27</A>&nbsp;I will overturn, overturn, overturn it! This also shall be  no [more], until he come whose right it is; and I will give it  [to him].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:28">21:28</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus speaketh the  Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning  their reproach; and thou shalt say, A sword, a sword is drawn;  for the slaughter is it furbished, that it may consume, that it  may glitter:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:29">21:29</A>&nbsp;whilst they see vanity for thee, whilst they divine a lie  unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are  slain, whose day is come at the time of the iniquity of the  end.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:30">21:30</A>&nbsp;Restore [it] to its sheath. I will judge thee in the place  where thou wast created, in the land of thy birth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:31">21:31</A>&nbsp;And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will  blow upon thee the fire of my wrath, and give thee into the  hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:32">21:32</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in  the midst of the land; thou shalt not be remembered: for I  Jehovah have spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the  bloody city? Yea, cause her to know all her abominations,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A city that sheddeth  blood in her midst, that her time may come, and maketh idols  against herself to defile herself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;Thou art become guilty by thy blood which thou hast shed,  and hast defiled thyself with thine idols which thou hast made;  and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come unto  thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the  nations, and a mocking unto all countries.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;Those that are near, and those that are far from thee,  shall mock thee, who art infamous [and] full of tumult.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;Behold, the princes of Israel have been in thee to shed  blood, each according to his power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;In thee have they made light of father and mother; in the  midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger;  in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my  sabbaths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;In thee there have been slanderous men to shed blood; and  in thee have they eaten upon the mountains; in the midst of  thee they have committed lewdness;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;in thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness; in  thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her separation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's  wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and  another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast  taken usury and increase, and thou hast overreached thy  neighbours by oppression, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;And behold, I have smitten mine hand at thine overreaching  which thou hast done, and at thy bloodshed which hath been in  the midst of thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;Shall thy heart endure, shall thy hands be strong, in the  days that I shall deal with thee? I Jehovah have spoken, and  will do [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse  thee through the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out  of thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt be polluted through thyself in the sight of  the nations, and thou shalt know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross to me:  they are all copper, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst  of the furnace: they are become the dross of silver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are all  become dross, therefore behold, I will gather you into the  midst of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;[As] they gather silver, and copper, and iron, and lead,  and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon  it, to melt it, so will I gather you in mine anger and in my  fury, and I will lay you on and melt you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:21">22:21</A>&nbsp;Yea, I will collect you, and blow upon you the fire of my  wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:22">22:22</A>&nbsp;As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall  ye be melted in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I  Jehovah have poured out my fury upon you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:23">22:23</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:24">22:24</A>&nbsp;Son of man, say unto her, Thou art a land that is not  cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:25">22:25</A>&nbsp;There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of her  like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they devour souls; they  take away treasure and precious things; they increase her  widows in the midst of her;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:26">22:26</A>&nbsp;her priests do violence to my law, and profane my holy  things: they put no difference between the holy and profane,  neither do they make known [the difference] between the unclean  and the clean, and they hide their eyes from my sabbaths, and I  am profaned among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:27">22:27</A>&nbsp;Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves ravening  the prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, to get dishonest  gain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:28">22:28</A>&nbsp;And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered  [mortar], seeing vanity and divining lies unto them, saying,  Thus saith the Lord Jehovah! and Jehovah hath not spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:29">22:29</A>&nbsp;The people of the land use oppression and practise  robbery; and they vex the poor and needy, and oppress the  stranger wrongfully.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:30">22:30</A>&nbsp;And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the  fence, and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I  should not destroy it; but I found none.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:31">22:31</A>&nbsp;And I will pour out mine indignation upon them; I will  consume them in the fire of my wrath: their own way will I  recompense upon their head, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;And they committed whoredom in Egypt; they committed  whoredom in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and  there were handled the teats of their virginity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;And their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her  sister; and they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters.  As for their names: Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she  lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians [her] neighbours,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them  attractive young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, all of them the  choice of the children of Asshur; and with all after whom she  lusted, with all their idols she defiled herself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;Neither left she her whoredoms [brought] from Egypt; for in  her youth they had lain with her, and had handled the breasts  of her virginity, and poured their fornication upon her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the  hand of the children of Asshur, after whom she lusted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;These discovered her nakedness, they took her sons and her  daughters, and slew her with the sword; and she became a name  among women; and they executed judgment upon her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;And her sister Oholibah saw [this], and was more corrupt  in her passion than she, and in her fornications more than the  whoredoms of her sister.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;She lusted after the children of Asshur [her] neighbours,  governors and rulers, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding  upon horses, all of them attractive young men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;And I saw that she was defiled: both took one way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;And she increased her fornications; for she saw men  portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed  with vermilion,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing turbans  on their heads, all of them captains in appearance, [after] the  likeness of the children of Babylon, of Chaldea, the land of  their nativity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she lusted  after them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;And the children of Babylon came to her into the bed of  love, and they defiled her with their fornication; she too  defiled herself with them, and her soul was alienated from  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;And she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her  nakedness; and my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul  was alienated from her sister.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:19">23:19</A>&nbsp;Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, calling to remembrance  the days of her youth, wherein she played the harlot in the  land of Egypt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:20">23:20</A>&nbsp;and she lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is [as]  the flesh of asses, and whose issue is [as] the issue of  horses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:21">23:21</A>&nbsp;And thou didst look back to the lewdness of thy youth, in  the handling of thy teats by the Egyptians, for the breasts of  thy youth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:22">23:22</A>&nbsp;Therefore, Oholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold,  I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is  alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:23">23:23</A>&nbsp;The children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and  Shoa and Koa, all the children of Asshur with them; all of them  attractive young men, governors and rulers, great lords and  renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:24">23:24</A>&nbsp;And they shall come against thee [with] armour, chariots  and wheels, and with an assemblage of peoples; they shall set  themselves against thee [with] target, and shield, and helmet  round about; and I will put judgment before them, and they  shall judge thee according to their judgments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall  deal furiously with thee: they shall cut off thy nose and thine  ears, and thy remnant shall fall by the sword; they shall take  thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured  by the fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:26">23:26</A>&nbsp;They shall also strip the of thy garments, and take away  thy fair jewels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:27">23:27</A>&nbsp;And I will make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy  whoredom [brought] from the land of Egypt; and thou shalt not  lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:28">23:28</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give thee  over into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of  them from whom thy soul is alienated.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:29">23:29</A>&nbsp;And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take  away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare; so  that the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both  thy lewdness and thy fornications.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:30">23:30</A>&nbsp;These things shall be done unto thee, because thou hast  gone a whoring after the nations, because thou hast defiled  thyself with their idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:31">23:31</A>&nbsp;Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; and I have  given her cup into thy hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:32">23:32</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy  sister's cup deep and large; thou shalt be for a laughing-stock  and a derision, [for] it containeth much.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:33">23:33</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the  cup of astonishment and desolation, the cup of thy sister  Samaria;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:34">23:34</A>&nbsp;thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt  gnaw the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I  have spoken [it], saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:35">23:35</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast  forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou  also thy lewdness and thy fornications.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:36">23:36</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, wilt thou judge  Oholah and Oholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:37">23:37</A>&nbsp;For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their  hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery, and  have also passed over unto them their children, whom they bore  unto me, to be devoured.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:38">23:38</A>&nbsp;Moreover this have they done unto me: in the same day have  they defiled my sanctuary and profaned my sabbaths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:39">23:39</A>&nbsp;For when they had slaughtered their children unto their  idols, they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it;  and behold, thus have they done in the midst of my house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:40">23:40</A>&nbsp;And furthermore, they sent for men to come from far, unto  whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came: for whom thou  didst wash thyself, paintedst thine eyes, and deckedst thyself  with ornaments;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:41">23:41</A>&nbsp;and satest upon a stately bed, with a table prepared  before it, whereupon thou hadst set mine incense and mine oil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:42">23:42</A>&nbsp;And the voice of a multitude living carelessly was with  her; and with people of the common sort were brought Sabeans  from the wilderness, and they put bracelets upon their hands,  and a beautiful crown upon their heads.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:43">23:43</A>&nbsp;And I said of her that was old in adulteries, Will she now  commit her fornications, even she.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:44">23:44</A>&nbsp;And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a whorish  woman: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah the lewd  women.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:45">23:45</A>&nbsp;And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment  of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed  blood; for they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:46">23:46</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up an  assemblage against them, and will give them to be driven hither  and thither and spoiled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:47">23:47</A>&nbsp;And the assemblage shall stone them with stones, and  despatch them with their swords; they shall kill their sons and  their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:48">23:48</A>&nbsp;And I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, and  all women shall receive instruction and shall not do according  to your lewdness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:49">23:49</A>&nbsp;And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye  shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I  [am] the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:1">24:1</A>&nbsp;And in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth of  the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:2">24:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, write thee the name of the day, of this  selfsame day: on this selfsame day the king of Babylon draws  near to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:3">24:3</A>&nbsp;And propose a parable unto the rebellious house, and say  unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Set on the pot, set  [it] on, and also pour water into it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:4">24:4</A>&nbsp;Gather the pieces thereof into it, every good piece, the  thigh and the shoulder; fill [it] with the choice bones:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:5">24:5</A>&nbsp;take the choice of the flock; and also [put] a pile of wood  under it, for the bones; make it boil well, and let the bones  of it seethe therein.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:6">24:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody  city, to the pot whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not  gone out of it! Bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall  upon it:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:7">24:7</A>&nbsp;for her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the  bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with  dust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:8">24:8</A>&nbsp;That it might cause fury to come up to execute vengeance, I  have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be  covered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:9">24:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody  city! I also will make the pile great.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:10">24:10</A>&nbsp;Heap on the wood, kindle the fire, boil thoroughly the  flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:11">24:11</A>&nbsp;Then set it empty upon its coals, that it may be hot, and  the brass of it may burn, and that its filthiness may be molten  in it, [and] that its rust may be consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:12">24:12</A>&nbsp;She hath exhausted [her] labours, yet her great rust goeth  not forth out of her: let her rust be in the fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:13">24:13</A>&nbsp;In thy filthiness is lewdness, for I have purged thee, and  thou art not pure. Thou shalt no more be purged from thy  filthiness, till I have satisfied my fury upon thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:14">24:14</A>&nbsp;I Jehovah have spoken [it]: it shall come to pass, and I  will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, nor will  I repent. According to thy ways, and according to thy doings,  shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:15">24:15</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:16">24:16</A>&nbsp;Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of  thine eyes with a stroke; yet thou shalt not mourn nor weep,  neither shall thy tears run down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:17">24:17</A>&nbsp;Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy  turban upon thee, and put thy sandals upon thy feet, and cover  not the beard, and eat not the bread of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:18">24:18</A>&nbsp;-- And I spoke unto the people in the morning; and at even  my wife died. And I did in the morning as I was commanded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:19">24:19</A>&nbsp;And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what  these things are to us, which thou doest?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:20">24:20</A>&nbsp;And I said to them, The word of Jehovah came unto me,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:21">24:21</A>&nbsp;Say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah:  Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your  strength, the desire of your eyes, and your soul's longing; and  your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall  fall by the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:22">24:22</A>&nbsp;And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover the  beard, neither eat the bread of men;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:23">24:23</A>&nbsp;and your turbans shall be upon your heads, and your  sandals upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye  shall waste away in your iniquities and moan one toward  another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:24">24:24</A>&nbsp;Thus Ezekiel shall be unto you a sign; according to all  that he hath done shall ye do: when it cometh, then ye shall  know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:25">24:25</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I  take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the  desire of their eyes, and that whereunto they lift up their  soul, their sons and their daughters,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:26">24:26</A>&nbsp;that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to  cause [thine] ears to hear [it]?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:27">24:27</A>&nbsp;In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is  escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb. So shalt  thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I [am]  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:1">25:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:2">25:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, set thy face against the children of Ammon, and  prophesy against them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:3">25:3</A>&nbsp;and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the  Lord Jehovah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou saidst,  Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against  the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the  house of Judah, when they went into captivity:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:4">25:4</A>&nbsp;therefore behold, I will give thee to the children of the  east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in  thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy  fruits, and they shall drink thy milk.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:5">25:5</A>&nbsp;And I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels, and the  children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall  know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:6">25:6</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped  the hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the  despite of thy soul against the land of Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:7">25:7</A>&nbsp;therefore behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and  will give thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee  off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of  the countries: I will destroy thee, and thou shalt know that I  [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:8">25:8</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because Moab and Seir do say,  Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:9">25:9</A>&nbsp;therefore behold, I will open the side of Moab from the  cities, from his cities even to the last of them, the glory of  the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kirjathaim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:10">25:10</A>&nbsp;unto the children of the east, with [the land of] the  children of Ammon; and I will give it them for a possession,  that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the  nations:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:11">25:11</A>&nbsp;and I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they shall  know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:12">25:12</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because Edom hath dealt  against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath made  himself very guilty, and revenged himself upon them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:13">25:13</A>&nbsp;therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also stretch  out my hand upon Edom; and will cut off man and beast from it;  and I will make it desolate from Teman; and unto Dedan shall  they fall by the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:14">25:14</A>&nbsp;And I will execute my vengeance upon Edom, by the hand of  my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine  anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my  vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:15">25:15</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have  dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of  soul, to destroy, from old hatred;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:16">25:16</A>&nbsp;therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I stretch  out my hands upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the  Kerethites, and cause the remnant of the sea-coast to perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:17">25:17</A>&nbsp;And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious  rebukes; and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when I shall  lay my vengeance upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:1">26:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first of  the month, [that] the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:2">26:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, because Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha,  she is broken, the gate of the peoples! she is turned unto me:  I shall be replenished [now] she is laid waste;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:3">26:3</A>&nbsp;therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against  thee, Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against  thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:4">26:4</A>&nbsp;And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down  her towers. And I will scrape her dust from her, and make her a  bare rock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:5">26:5</A>&nbsp;She shall be [a place] for the spreading of nets in the  midst of the sea; for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord  Jehovah; and she shall become a spoil for the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:6">26:6</A>&nbsp;And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain by  the sword; and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:7">26:7</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring from  the north, against Tyre, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, the  king of kings, with horses, and with chariots, and with  horsemen, and an assemblage, and much people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:8">26:8</A>&nbsp;He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field,  and he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound  against thee, and lift up the target against thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:9">26:9</A>&nbsp;and he shall set his engines of attack against thy walls,  and with his spikes he shall break down thy towers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:10">26:10</A>&nbsp;By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall  cover thee; thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen,  and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter  through thy gates, as a city is entered into, wherein is made a  breach.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:11">26:11</A>&nbsp;With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy  streets; he shall slay thy people by the sword, and the pillars  of thy strength shall go down to the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:12">26:12</A>&nbsp;And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey  of thy wares; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy  thy pleasant houses; and they shall lay thy stones and thy  timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:13">26:13</A>&nbsp;And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the  sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:14">26:14</A>&nbsp;And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shalt be [a place]  for the spreading of nets; thou shalt be built no more: for I  Jehovah have spoken [it], saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:15">26:15</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Shall not the isles  shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when  the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:16">26:16</A>&nbsp;And all the princes of the sea shall come down from their  thrones, and lay aside their robes, and put off their broidered  garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling, they  shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble [every] moment,  and be astonied because of thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:17">26:17</A>&nbsp;And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to  thee, How hast thou perished, that wast inhabited from the  seas, O renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, -- she and  her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all them that  dwell therein!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:18">26:18</A>&nbsp;Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; and  the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy  departure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:19">26:19</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a  desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I  bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters cover thee:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:20">26:20</A>&nbsp;then will I bring thee down, with them that go down to the  pit, to the people of old time, and will cause thee to dwell in  the lower parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with  them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I  will set glory in the land of the living.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:21">26:21</A>&nbsp;And I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no  [more]; and thou shalt be sought for, and shalt never be found  again, for ever, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:1">27:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_27:3">27:3</A>&nbsp;and say unto Tyre: O thou that art situate at the entries  of the sea, and traffickest with the peoples in many isles,  thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou, Tyre, hast said, I am  perfect in beauty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:4">27:4</A>&nbsp;Thy borders are in the heart of the seas, thy builders have  perfected thy beauty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:5">27:5</A>&nbsp;They made all thy double boards of cypress-trees of Senir;  they took cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:6">27:6</A>&nbsp;Of the oaks of Bashan did they make thine oars; they made  thy benches of ivory, inlaid in box-wood, out of the isles of  Chittim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:7">27:7</A>&nbsp;Byssus with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, to  serve thee for a banner; blue and purple from the isles of  Elishah was thine awning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:8">27:8</A>&nbsp;The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy  wise men, O Tyre, who were in thee, were thy pilots.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:9">27:9</A>&nbsp;The elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee  repairing thy leaks; all the ships of the sea with their  mariners were in thee, to barter with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:10">27:10</A>&nbsp;Persia and Lud and Phut were in thine army, thy men of  war: they hanged shield and helmet in thee; they gave splendour  to thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:11">27:11</A>&nbsp;The children of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls  round about, and the Gammadim were on thy towers: they hanged  their shields upon thy walls round about; they made thy beauty  perfect.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:12">27:12</A>&nbsp;Tarshish dealt with thee by reason of the abundance of all  substance; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they furnished thy  markets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:13">27:13</A>&nbsp;Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers: they  bartered with thee the persons of men, and vessels of bronze.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_27:17">27:17</A>&nbsp;Judah and the land of Israel were thy traffickers: they  bartered with thee wheat of Minnith, and sweet cakes, and  honey, and oil, and balm.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:18">27:18</A>&nbsp;Damascus dealt with thee because of the multitude of thy  handiworks, by reason of the abundance of all substance, with  wine of Helbon, and white wool.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:19">27:19</A>&nbsp;Vedan and Javan of Uzal traded in thy markets: wrought  iron, cassia, and calamus were in thy traffic.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_27:21">27:21</A>&nbsp;Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were the merchants of  thy hand: in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these did they  trade with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:22">27:22</A>&nbsp;The merchants of Sheba and Raamah were thy traffickers:  they furnished thy markets with all the choice spices, and with  all precious stones and gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:23">27:23</A>&nbsp;Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba,  Asshur, and Chilmad traded with thee:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_27:25">27:25</A>&nbsp;The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy traffic;  and thou wast replenished, and highly honoured, in the heart of  the seas.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_27:35">27:35</A>&nbsp;All the inhabitants of the isles are amazed at thee, and  their kings are horribly afraid, [their] countenance is  troubled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:36">27:36</A>&nbsp;The merchants among the peoples hiss at thee; thou art  become a terror, and thou shalt never be any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:1">28:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p>

The workmanship of thy  tambours and of thy pipes was in thee: in the day that thou  wast created were they prepared.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:14">28:14</A>&nbsp;Thou wast the anointed covering cherub, and I had set thee  [so]: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou didst walk  up and down in the midst of stones of fire.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:17">28:17</A>&nbsp;Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast  corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I have cast  thee to the ground, I have laid thee before kings, that they  may behold thee.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:26">28:26</A>&nbsp;They shall dwell in it in safety, and shall build houses  and plant vineyards; and they shall dwell in safety, when I  have executed judgments upon all those that despised them round  about them: and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah their God.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_29:19">29:19</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give  the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he  shall carry away her multitude, and seize her spoil, and take  her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:20">29:20</A>&nbsp;I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour  wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me,  saith the Lord Jehovah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:25">30:25</A>&nbsp;And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and  the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I  [am] Jehovah, when I have put my sword into the hand of the  king of Babylon, and he shall have stretched it out upon the  land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:26">30:26</A>&nbsp;And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and  disperse them through the countries: and they shall know that I  [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third  [month], on the first of the month, [that] the word of Jehovah  came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his  multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches  and a shadowing shroud, and of a high stature: and his top was  amidst the thick boughs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high; its  streams ran round about his plantation, and it sent out its  rivulets unto all the trees of the field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the  field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became  long, because of great waters, when he shot forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;All the fowl of the heavens made their nests in his boughs,  and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring  forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all the great  nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his  branches: because his root was by great waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him; the  cypresses were not like his boughs, and the plane-trees were  not as his branches: no tree in the garden of God was like unto  him in his beauty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;I had made him fair by the multitude of his branches; and  all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:10">31:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast  lifted up thyself in stature, ... and he hath set his top  amidst the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his  height,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:11">31:11</A>&nbsp;I have given him into the hand of the mighty one of the  nations; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out  for his wickedness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:12">31:12</A>&nbsp;And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him  off and have left him; upon the mountains and in all the  valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken in  all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the  earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:13">31:13</A>&nbsp;Upon his fallen [trunk] do all the fowl of the heavens  dwell, and all the beasts of the field are upon his branches:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:14">31:14</A>&nbsp;to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt  themselves in their stature, nor set their top amidst the thick  boughs, and that none of them that drink water stand up in his  height by himself; for they are all given over unto death in  the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of  men, with them that go down to the pit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:15">31:15</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down  to Sheol, I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and  I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were  stayed; and I made Lebanon black for him, and all the trees of  the field fainted for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:16">31:16</A>&nbsp;I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when  I cast him down to Sheol, with them that go down into the pit;  and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all  that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the  earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:17">31:17</A>&nbsp;They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that  were slain with the sword, and [that were] his arm, that dwelt  under his shadow in the midst of the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:18">31:18</A>&nbsp;To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among  the trees of Eden? Yet shalt thou be brought down with the  trees of Eden, unto the lower parts of the earth; thou shalt  lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain  by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the  Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth  month, on the first of the month, that the word of Jehovah came  unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of  Egypt, and say unto him, Thou wast like a young lion among the  nations, and thou wast as a monster in the seas; and thou didst  break forth in thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy  feet, and fouledst their rivers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also spread out my net  over thee with an assemblage of many peoples; and they shall  bring thee up in my net.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;And I will leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth  upon the open field, and will cause all the fowl of the heavens  to settle upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole  earth with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the  valleys with the heap of thy [members];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;and I will water with thy blood the land wherein thou  swimmest, even to the mountains; and the water-courses shall be  full of thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:7">32:7</A>&nbsp;And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heavens,  and make the stars thereof black; I will cover the sun with a  cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:8">32:8</A>&nbsp;All the bright lights of the heavens will I make black over  thee, and bring darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;And I will vex the heart of many peoples, when I bring [the  news of] thy destruction among the nations, into the countries  that thou hast not known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:10">32:10</A>&nbsp;And I will make many peoples amazed at thee, and their  kings shall be horribly afraid at thee, when I brandish my  sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, each  one for his life, in the day of thy fall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:11">32:11</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of  Babylon shall come upon thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:12">32:12</A>&nbsp;By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to  fall: the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall  spoil the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall  be destroyed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:13">32:13</A>&nbsp;And I will destroy all the beasts thereof, from beside the  great waters; and the foot of man shall not trouble them any  more, nor shall the cloven hoofs of beasts trouble them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:14">32:14</A>&nbsp;Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their  rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:15">32:15</A>&nbsp;When I shall make the land of Egypt a desolation, and the  country shall be left desolate of all that was in it, when I  have smitten all them that dwell therein, then shall they know  that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:16">32:16</A>&nbsp;It is a lamentation, and [thus] they shall lament her: the  daughters of the nations shall say it in lamenting; they shall  say it in lamenting over Egypt and over all her multitude,  saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:17">32:17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth  of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:18">32:18</A>&nbsp;Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them  down, her and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the  lower parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_32:25">32:25</A>&nbsp;They have set him a bed in the midst of the slain, with  all his multitude: their graves are round about him, all of  them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though their terror was  caused in the land of the living; and they have borne their  confusion with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the  midst of them that are slain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:26">32:26</A>&nbsp;There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude, their  graves round about them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by  the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the  living.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:4">33:4</A>&nbsp;then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh  not warning, if the sword come and take him away, his blood  shall be upon his own head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:5">33:5</A>&nbsp;He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning;  his blood is upon him: whereas had he taken warning, he would  have delivered his soul.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:7">33:7</A>&nbsp;So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the  house of Israel; and thou shalt hear the word from my mouth,  and warn them from me.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:9">33:9</A>&nbsp;But if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and  he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but  thou hast delivered thy soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:10">33:10</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel, Thus  ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us,  and we waste away in them, how then should we live?</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:26">33:26</A>&nbsp;Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye  defile every one his neighbour's wife; and shall ye possess the  land?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:27">33:27</A>&nbsp;Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: [As]  I live, verily they that are in the waste places shall fall by  the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the  beasts to be devoured, and they that are in the strongholds and  in the caves shall die of the pestilence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:28">33:28</A>&nbsp;And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment,  and the pride of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of  Israel shall be desolated, so that none shall pass through.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:29">33:29</A>&nbsp;And they shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when I have made  the land a desolation and an astonishment because of all their  abominations which they have committed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:30">33:30</A>&nbsp;And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people  keep talking of thee by the walls and in the doors of the  houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother,  saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh  forth from Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:31">33:31</A>&nbsp;And they come unto thee as a people cometh, and they sit  before thee [as] my people, and they hear thy words, but they  do them not; for with their mouth they shew much love, [but]  their heart goeth after their dishonest gain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:32">33:32</A>&nbsp;And behold, thou art unto them as a lovely song, a  pleasant voice, and one that playeth well on an instrument; and  they hear thy words, but they do them not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:33">33:33</A>&nbsp;And when this cometh to pass (behold, it will come), then  shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:1">34:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:2">34:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel,  prophesy; and say unto them, unto the shepherds, Thus saith the  Lord Jehovah: Woe to the shepherds of Israel that feed  themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:3">34:3</A>&nbsp;Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool; ye kill  them that are fattened: [but] ye feed not the flock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:4">34:4</A>&nbsp;The weak have ye not strengthened, nor have ye healed the  sick, and ye have not bound up [what was] broken, neither have  ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye  sought for that which was lost; but with harshness and with  rigour have ye ruled over them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:5">34:5</A>&nbsp;And they were scattered because there was no shepherd; and  they became meat to all the beasts of the field, and were  scattered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:6">34:6</A>&nbsp;My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every  high hill, and my sheep have been scattered upon all the face  of the earth, and there was none that searched, or that sought  for them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:7">34:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:8">34:8</A>&nbsp;[As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily because my  sheep have been a prey, and my sheep have been meat to every  beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, and my  shepherds searched not for my flock, but the shepherds fed  themselves, and fed not my flock,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:9">34:9</A>&nbsp;-- therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:10">34:10</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the  shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause  them to cease from feeding the flock: that the shepherds may  feed themselves no more; and I will deliver my sheep from their  mouth, that they may not be food for them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, [even] I, will  both search for my sheep, and tend them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A>&nbsp;As a shepherd tendeth his flock in the day that he is  among his scattered sheep, so will I tend my sheep, and will  deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered  in the cloudy and dark day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:13">34:13</A>&nbsp;And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather  them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land;  and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the  water-courses, and in all the habitable places of the country.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:14">34:14</A>&nbsp;I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high  mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie  down in a good fold, and in a fat pasture they shall feed upon  the mountains of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:15">34:15</A>&nbsp;I will myself feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie  down, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:16">34:16</A>&nbsp;I will seek the lost, and bring again that which was  driven away, and will bind up the broken, and will strengthen  that which was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong:  I will feed them with judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:17">34:17</A>&nbsp;And as for you, my flock, thus saith the Lord Jehovah:  Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between the rams and  the he-goats.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:18">34:18</A>&nbsp;Is it too small a thing unto you to have eaten up the good  pastures, but ye must tread down with your feet the rest of  your pastures; and to have drunk of the settled waters, but ye  must foul the rest with your feet?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:19">34:19</A>&nbsp;And my sheep have to eat that which ye have trodden with  your feet, and to drink that which ye have fouled with your  feet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:20">34:20</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto them: Behold,  [it is] I, and I will judge between the fat sheep and the lean  sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:21">34:21</A>&nbsp;Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push  all the weak ones with your horns, till ye have scattered them  abroad,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:22">34:22</A>&nbsp;-- I will save my flock, that they may no more be a prey;  and I will judge between sheep and sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:23">34:23</A>&nbsp;And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall  feed them, even my servant David: he shall feed them, and he  shall be their shepherd.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:24">34:24</A>&nbsp;And I Jehovah will be their God, and my servant David a  prince in their midst: I Jehovah have spoken [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:25">34:25</A>&nbsp;And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will  cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall  dwell in safety in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:26">34:26</A>&nbsp;And I will make them and the places round about my hill a  blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its  season: there shall be showers of blessing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:27">34:27</A>&nbsp;And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the  earth shall yield its increase; and they shall be in safety in  their land, and shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when I have  broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them out of the  hand of those that kept them in servitude.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:28">34:28</A>&nbsp;And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither  shall the beast of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell  in safety, and none shall make them afraid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:29">34:29</A>&nbsp;And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they  shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear  the ignominy of the nations any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:30">34:30</A>&nbsp;And they shall know that I Jehovah their God [am] with  them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith  the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:31">34:31</A>&nbsp;And ye, my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men: I [am]  your God, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:1">35:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:2">35:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy  against it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:3">35:3</A>&nbsp;and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am  against thee, mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand upon  thee, and I will make thee a desolation and an astonishment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:4">35:4</A>&nbsp;I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be a  desolation: and thou shalt know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:5">35:5</A>&nbsp;Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast given  over the children of Israel to the power of the sword, in the  time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:6">35:6</A>&nbsp;therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will  certainly appoint thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee;  since thou hast not hated blood, blood shall pursue thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:7">35:7</A>&nbsp;And I will make mount Seir a desolation and an  astonishment, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him  that returneth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:8">35:8</A>&nbsp;and I will fill his mountains with his slain. In thy hills,  and in thy valleys, and in all thy water-courses shall they  fall that are slain with the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:9">35:9</A>&nbsp;I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities  shall not be inhabited: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:10">35:10</A>&nbsp;Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two  countries shall be mine, and we will possess it, whereas  Jehovah was there:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:11">35:11</A>&nbsp;therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will  even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy,  as thou hast done out of thy hatred against them; and I will  make myself known among them, when I shall judge thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:12">35:12</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt know that I Jehovah have heard all thy  reproaches, which thou hast uttered against the mountains of  Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to  devour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:13">35:13</A>&nbsp;And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your  mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard  [them].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:14">35:14</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth  rejoiceth, I will make thee a desolation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:15">35:15</A>&nbsp;As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of  Israel, because it was desolated, so will I do unto thee: thou  shalt be a desolation, O mount Seir, and all Edom, the whole of  it: and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:1">36:1</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of  Israel, and say, Mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:2">36:2</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy hath said  against you, Aha! and, The ancient high places are become ours  in possession;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:3">36:3</A>&nbsp;therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah:  Because, yea, because they have made [you] desolate, and have  swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession  unto the remnant of the nations, and ye are taken up in the  lips of talkers, and in the defaming of the people:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:4">36:4</A>&nbsp;therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the  Lord Jehovah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and  to the hills, to the water-courses and to the valleys, to the  desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are  become a prey and a derision to the remnant of the nations that  are round about,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:5">36:5</A>&nbsp;-- therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the  fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the remnant of the  nations, and against the whole of Edom, which have appointed my  land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all  [their] heart, with despite of soul, to plunder it by pillage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:6">36:6</A>&nbsp;Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say  to the mountains and to the hills, to the water-courses and to  the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken  in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the  ignominy of the nations;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:7">36:7</A>&nbsp;therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have lifted up my  hand, [saying,] Verily the nations that are about you, they  shall bear their shame.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:8">36:8</A>&nbsp;And ye mountains of Israel shall shoot forth your branches,  and yield your fruit to my people Israel: for they are at hand  to come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:9">36:9</A>&nbsp;For behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye  shall be tilled and sown.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:10">36:10</A>&nbsp;And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel,  the whole of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the  waste places shall be builded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:11">36:11</A>&nbsp;And I will multiply upon you man and beast, and they shall  increase and bring forth fruit; and I will cause you to be  inhabited as [in] your former times, yea, I will make it better  than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:12">36:12</A>&nbsp;And I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people  Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their  inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of  children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:13">36:13</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say unto you,  Thou devourest men, and hast bereaved thy nation,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:14">36:14</A>&nbsp;therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave  thy nation any more, saith the Lord Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:15">36:15</A>&nbsp;neither will I cause thee to hear the ignominy of the  nations any more, and thou shalt not bear the reproach of the  peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to fall  any more, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:16">36:16</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:17">36:17</A>&nbsp;Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own  land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their  way was before me as the uncleanness of a woman in her  separation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:18">36:18</A>&nbsp;And I poured out my fury upon them for the blood that they  had shed upon the land, and because they had defiled it with  their idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:19">36:19</A>&nbsp;And I scattered them among the nations, and they were  dispersed through the countries: according to their way and  according to their doings I judged them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:20">36:20</A>&nbsp;And when they came to the nations whither they went, they  profaned my holy name, when it was said of them, These are the  people of Jehovah, and they are gone forth out of his land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:21">36:21</A>&nbsp;But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel  had profaned among the nations whither they went.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:22">36:22</A>&nbsp;Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the  Lord Jehovah: I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel,  but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations  whither ye went.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:23">36:23</A>&nbsp;And I will hallow my great name, which was profaned among  the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and  the nations shall know that I [am] Jehovah, saith the Lord  Jehovah, when I shall be hallowed in you before their eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:24">36:24</A>&nbsp;And I will take you from among the nations, and gather you  out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own  land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:25">36:25</A>&nbsp;And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be  clean: from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols will  I cleanse you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:26">36:26</A>&nbsp;And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new  spirit within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of  your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:27">36:27</A>&nbsp;And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk  in my statutes and keep mine ordinances, and ye shall do them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:28">36:28</A>&nbsp;And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your  fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:29">36:29</A>&nbsp;And I will save you from all your uncleannesses; and I  will call for the corn and will multiply it, and lay no famine  upon you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:30">36:30</A>&nbsp;And I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the  increase of the field, so that ye may receive no more the  reproach of famine among the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:31">36:31</A>&nbsp;And ye shall remember your evil ways, and your doings  which were not good, and shall loathe yourselves for your  iniquities and for your abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:32">36:32</A>&nbsp;Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord Jehovah, be  it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O  house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:33">36:33</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I shall  cleanse you from all your iniquities I will also cause the  cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:34">36:34</A>&nbsp;And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it was a  desolation in the sight of all that passed by.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:35">36:35</A>&nbsp;And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become  like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined  cities [are] fortified [and] inhabited.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:36">36:36</A>&nbsp;And the nations that shall be left round about you shall  know that I Jehovah build the ruined places [and] plant that  which was desolate: I Jehovah have spoken, and I will do [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:37">36:37</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will yet for this be  inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it unto them; I will  increase them with men like a flock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:38">36:38</A>&nbsp;As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her set  feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men:  and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:1">37:1</A>&nbsp;The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and Jehovah carried me out  in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of a valley; and it  was full of bones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:2">37:2</A>&nbsp;And he caused me to pass by them round about; and behold,  there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were  very dry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:3">37:3</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, Shall these bones live?  And I said, Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:4">37:4</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say  unto them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:5">37:5</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I  will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:6">37:6</A>&nbsp;And I will put sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh  upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and  ye shall live: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:7">37:7</A>&nbsp;And I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied,  there was a noise, and behold a rustling, and the bones came  together, bone to its bone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:8">37:8</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and behold, sinews and flesh came up upon  them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath  in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:9">37:9</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son  of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come  from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain,  that they may live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:10">37:10</A>&nbsp;And I prophesied as he had commanded me, and the breath  came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet,  an exceeding great army.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:11">37:11</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole  house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our  hope is lost: we are cut off!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:12">37:12</A>&nbsp;Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord  Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come  up out of your graves, O my people, and bring you into the land  of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:13">37:13</A>&nbsp;And ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when I have opened  your graves, and have caused you to come up out of your graves,  O my people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:14">37:14</A>&nbsp;And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I  will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I  Jehovah have spoken, and have done [it], saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:15">37:15</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_37:17">37:17</A>&nbsp;And join them one to another into one stick; and they  shall become one in thy hand.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_37:20">37:20</A>&nbsp;And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand  before their eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:21">37:21</A>&nbsp;And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I  will take the children of Israel from among the nations,  whither they are gone, and will gather them from every side,  and bring them into their own land:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_37:23">37:23</A>&nbsp;And they shall not defile themselves any more with their  idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their  transgressions; and I will save them out of all their  dwelling-places wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse  them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:24">37:24</A>&nbsp;And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all  shall have one shepherd: and they shall walk in mine  ordinances, and keep my statutes, and do them.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_37:26">37:26</A>&nbsp;And I will make a covenant of peace with them: it shall be  an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and  multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them  for ever.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_38:1">38:1</A>&nbsp;And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:2">38:2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog,  the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against  him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:3">38:3</A>&nbsp;and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against  thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:4">38:4</A>&nbsp;And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and  I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and  horsemen, all of them thoroughly equipped, a great assemblage  with targets and shields, all of them handling swords:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:5">38:5</A>&nbsp;Persia, Cush, and Phut with them, all of them with shield  and helmet;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:6">38:6</A>&nbsp;Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah from the  uttermost north, and all his bands; -- many peoples with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:7">38:7</A>&nbsp;Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself thou, and all  thine assemblage that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a  guard unto them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:8">38:8</A>&nbsp;After many days shalt thou be visited; at the end of years  thou shalt come into the land brought back from the sword [and]  gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel  which have been a perpetual waste: but it is brought forth out  from the peoples, and they shall all of them be dwelling in  safety.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:9">38:9</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt ascend, thou shalt come like a storm, thou  shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy  bands, and many peoples with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:10">38:10</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall even come to pass in  that day that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shalt  think an evil thought;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:11">38:11</A>&nbsp;and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled  villages; I will come to them that are in quiet, that dwell in  safety, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither  bars nor gates,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:12">38:12</A>&nbsp;to seize a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thy hand  against the waste places that are [now] inhabited, and against  a people gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle  and goods, that dwell in the middle of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:13">38:13</A>&nbsp;Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all  the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to  seize a spoil? hast thou gathered thine assemblage to take a  prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take cattle and goods,  to seize a great spoil?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:14">38:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say unto Gog, Thus  saith the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel  dwelleth in safety, shalt thou not know [it]?</p>

<p><A NAME="an_38:16">38:16</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt come up against my people Israel as a cloud  to cover the land -- it shall be at the end of days -- and I  will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me,  when I shall be hallowed in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:17">38:17</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Art thou not he of whom I  have spoken in old time through my servants the prophets of  Israel, who prophesied in those days, for [many] years, that I  would bring thee against them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:18">38:18</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, in the day when Gog  shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah,  [that] my fury shall come up in my face;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:19">38:19</A>&nbsp;for in my jealousy, in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,  Verily in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land  of Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:20">38:20</A>&nbsp;so that the fish of the sea, and the fowl of the heavens,  and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things which  creep upon the earth, and all mankind that are upon the face of  the earth shall shake at my presence; and the mountains shall  be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall  shall fall to the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:21">38:21</A>&nbsp;And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my  mountains, saith the Lord Jehovah: every man's sword shall be  against his brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:22">38:22</A>&nbsp;And I will enter into judgment with him with pestilence  and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands,  and upon the many peoples that are with him, overflowing rain  and great hailstones, fire and brimstone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:23">38:23</A>&nbsp;And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will  be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that  I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:1">39:1</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus  saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog,  prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:2">39:2</A>&nbsp;and I will turn thee back, and lead thee, and will cause  thee to come up from the uttermost north, and will bring thee  upon the mountains of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:3">39:3</A>&nbsp;And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will  cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:4">39:4</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all  thy bands, and the peoples that are with thee: I have given  thee to be meat for the birds of prey of every wing, and to the  beasts of the field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:5">39:5</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt fall on the open field; for I have spoken [it],  saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:6">39:6</A>&nbsp;And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell  at ease in the isles: and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:7">39:7</A>&nbsp;And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my  people Israel; and I will not suffer my holy name to be  profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I [am]  Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:8">39:8</A>&nbsp;Behold, it cometh, and shall be done, saith the Lord  Jehovah. This is the day whereof I have spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:9">39:9</A>&nbsp;And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth,  and shall kindle fire, and burn weapons, and shields, and  targets, bows, and arrows, and hand-staves, and spears: and  they shall make fires with them seven years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:10">39:10</A>&nbsp;And no wood shall be taken out of the field, neither cut  down out of the forests; for they shall make fire with the  weapons; and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and  plunder those that plundered them, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:11">39:11</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will give  unto Gog a place there for burial in Israel, the valley of the  passers-by to the east of the sea; and it shall stop [the way]  of the passers-by; and there shall they bury Gog and all the  multitude; and they shall call it, Valley of Hamon-Gog.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:12">39:12</A>&nbsp;And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying  them, that they may cleanse the land;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:13">39:13</A>&nbsp;and all the people of the land shall bury [them]; and it  shall be to them for renown in the day that I shall be  glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:14">39:14</A>&nbsp;And they shall sever out men of continual employment to go  through the land, who, with the passers-by, shall bury those  that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: at the  end of seven months shall they make a search.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:15">39:15</A>&nbsp;And the passers-by shall pass through the land, and when  [any] seeth a man's bone, he shall set up a sign by it, till  the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-Gog.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:16">39:16</A>&nbsp;And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall  they cleanse the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:17">39:17</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Speak  unto the birds of every wing, and to every beast of the field,  Gather yourselves together and come, assemble yourselves on  every side to my sacrifice which I sacrifice for you, a great  sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh,  and drink blood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:18">39:18</A>&nbsp;Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood  of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats,  [and] of bullocks, all of them fatted beasts of Bashan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:19">39:19</A>&nbsp;And ye shall eat fat till ye are full, and drink blood  till ye are drunken, of my sacrifice which I sacrifice for you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:20">39:20</A>&nbsp;And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and  charioteers, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith  the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:21">39:21</A>&nbsp;And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the  nations shall see my judgment which I have executed, and my  hand which I have laid upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:22">39:22</A>&nbsp;And the house of Israel shall know that I [am] Jehovah  their God from that day and forward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:23">39:23</A>&nbsp;And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went  into captivity for their iniquity, because they were unfaithful  against me; and I hid my face from them, and gave them into the  hand of their enemies, so that they fell all of them by the  sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:24">39:24</A>&nbsp;According to their uncleanness and according to their  transgressions I did unto them, and I hid my face from them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:25">39:25</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Now will I bring  again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole  house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:26">39:26</A>&nbsp;and they shall bear their confusion, and all their  unfaithfulness in which they have acted unfaithfully against  me, when they shall dwell safely in their land, and none shall  make them afraid;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:27">39:27</A>&nbsp;when I have brought them again from the peoples, and  gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am hallowed in  them in the sight of many nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:28">39:28</A>&nbsp;And they shall know that I [am] Jehovah their God, in that  I caused them to be led into captivity among the nations, and  have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of  them any more there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:29">39:29</A>&nbsp;And I will not hide my face any more from them, for I  shall have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith  the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:1">40:1</A>&nbsp;In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning  of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year  after that the city was smitten, on that same day the hand of  Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:2">40:2</A>&nbsp;In the visions of God brought he me into the land of  Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain; and upon it was  as the building of a city, on the south.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:3">40:3</A>&nbsp;And he brought me thither, and behold, there was a man  whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a  flax-cord in his hand, and a measuring-reed; and he stood in  the gate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:4">40:4</A>&nbsp;And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine  eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that  I shall shew thee; for in order that it might be shewn unto  thee art thou brought hither.

<p><A NAME="an_40:5">40:5</A>&nbsp;And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house  round about, and in the man's hand a measuring-reed of six  cubits, [each] of one cubit and a hand breadth. And he measured  the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one  reed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:6">40:6</A>&nbsp;And he came to the gate which looked toward the east, and  went up its steps; and he measured the threshold of the gate,  one reed broad; and the other threshold one reed broad.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:7">40:7</A>&nbsp;And [each] chamber was one reed long and one reed broad;  and between the chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of  the gate, beside the porch of the gate within, was one reed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:8">40:8</A>&nbsp;And he measured the porch of the gate within, one reed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:9">40:9</A>&nbsp;And he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and  the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was  inward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:10">40:10</A>&nbsp;And the chambers of the gate which was toward the east  were three on this side and three on that side: they three were  of one measure; and the posts on this side and on that side had  one measure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:11">40:11</A>&nbsp;And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten  cubits; [and] the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:12">40:12</A>&nbsp;And there was a border before the chambers of one cubit,  and a border of one cubit on the other side; and the chambers  were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:13">40:13</A>&nbsp;And he measured the gate from the roof of [one] chamber to  the roof [of the other], a breadth of five and twenty cubits,  entry opposite entry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:14">40:14</A>&nbsp;And he made posts, sixty cubits, and by the post was the  court of the gate round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:15">40:15</A>&nbsp;And from the front of the gate of the entrance unto the  front of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:16">40:16</A>&nbsp;And there were closed windows to the chambers, and to  their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the  projections; and the windows round about were inward; and upon  [each] post were palm-trees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:17">40:17</A>&nbsp;And he brought me into the outer court, and behold, there  were cells, and a pavement made for the court round about:  thirty cells were upon the pavement.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:18">40:18</A>&nbsp;And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answering  to the length of the gates, [namely] the lower pavement.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:19">40:19</A>&nbsp;And he measured the breadth from the front of the lower  gate unto the front of the inner court outside, a hundred  cubits eastward and northward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:20">40:20</A>&nbsp;And the gate of the outer court, that looked toward the  north, he measured its length and its breadth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:21">40:21</A>&nbsp;And its chambers were three on this side and three on that  side; and its posts and its projections were according to the  measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and  breadth five and twenty cubits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:22">40:22</A>&nbsp;And its windows, and its projections, and its palm-trees  were according to the measure of the gate that looked toward  the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the  projections thereof were before them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:23">40:23</A>&nbsp;And the gate of the inner court was opposite to the gate  toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from  gate to gate a hundred cubits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:24">40:24</A>&nbsp;And he brought me toward the south: and behold, there was  a gate toward the south; and he measured its posts and its  projections according to these measures.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:25">40:25</A>&nbsp;And there were windows to it and to its projections round  about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the  breadth five and twenty cubits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:26">40:26</A>&nbsp;And there were seven steps to go up to it; and its  projections were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on  this side and one on that side, upon its posts.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_40:38">40:38</A>&nbsp;And there was a cell and its entry by the posts of the  gates; there they rinsed the burnt-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:39">40:39</A>&nbsp;And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side,  and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering  and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:40">40:40</A>&nbsp;And at the side without, at the ascent to the entry of the  north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was  at the porch of the gate, were two tables:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:41">40:41</A>&nbsp;four tables on this side, and four tables on that side, by  the side of the gate, -- eight tables, whereon they slew [the  sacrifice],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:42">40:42</A>&nbsp;-- and at the ascent, four tables of hewn stone, of a  cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one  cubit high; whereon also they laid the instruments with which  they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:43">40:43</A>&nbsp;And the double hooks of a hand breadth were fastened round  about within; and upon the tables [they put] the flesh of the  offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:44">40:44</A>&nbsp;And outside the inner gate were two cells in the inner  court, one at the side of the north gate, and its front towards  the south; the other was at the side of the south gate, the  front towards the north.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:45">40:45</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, This cell whose front is towards the  south is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the  house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:46">40:46</A>&nbsp;And the cell whose front is toward the north is for the  priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar. These are the  sons of Zadok, those who, from among the sons of Levi, approach  unto Jehovah to minister unto him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:47">40:47</A>&nbsp;And he measured the court, the length a hundred cubits,  and the breadth a hundred cubits, four square: and the altar  was before the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:48">40:48</A>&nbsp;And he brought me to the porch of the house; and he  measured the post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and  five cubits on that side; and the breadth of the gate, three  cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:49">40:49</A>&nbsp;The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth  eleven cubits, even by the steps whereby they went up to it;  and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and one  on that side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:1">41:1</A>&nbsp;And he brought me to the temple; and he measured the posts,  six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the  other side, the breadth of the tent.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_41:4">41:4</A>&nbsp;And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth,  twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is  the most holy [place].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:5">41:5</A>&nbsp;And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the  breadth of the side-chambers, four cubits, round about the  house on every side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:6">41:6</A>&nbsp;And the side-chambers were three, chamber over chamber, and  thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which the house  had for the side-chambers round about, that they might have  hold; but they had not hold in the wall of the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:7">41:7</A>&nbsp;And for the side-chambers there was an enlarging, and it  went round about [the house] increasing upward; for the  surrounding of the house increased upward round about the  house; therefore the house had width upward, and so ascended  [from] the lower [story] to the upper, by the middle one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:8">41:8</A>&nbsp;And I saw that the house had an elevation round about: the  foundations of the side-chambers, a full reed, six cubits to  the joint.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:9">41:9</A>&nbsp;The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers  without, was five cubits, as also what was left free along the  building of the side-chambers that pertained to the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:10">41:10</A>&nbsp;And between the cells [and the house] was a width of  twenty cubits round about the house on every side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:11">41:11</A>&nbsp;And the entry of the side-chambers was toward what was  left free, one entry toward the north, and one entry toward the  south; and the width of the space left free was five cubits  round about.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_41:16">41:16</A>&nbsp;The thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries  round about the three of them (opposite the thresholds it was  wainscoted with wood round about, and from the ground up to the  windows, and the windows were covered),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:17">41:17</A>&nbsp;[and] above, over the entry, even unto the inner house,  and without, and by all the wall round about, within and  without, [all was] by measure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:18">41:18</A>&nbsp;And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees, and a  palm-tree was between cherub and cherub; and the cherub had two  faces:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:19">41:19</A>&nbsp;the face of a man was toward the palm-tree on the one  side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the  other side: [so] was it made upon all the house round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:20">41:20</A>&nbsp;From the ground unto above the entry were the cherubim and  the palm-trees made, and [on] the wall of the temple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:21">41:21</A>&nbsp;As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and the  front of the sanctuary had the same appearance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:22">41:22</A>&nbsp;The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length  two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls were  of wood. And he said unto me, This is the table which is before  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:23">41:23</A>&nbsp;And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:24">41:24</A>&nbsp;And the doors had two leaves, two turning-leaves: two for  the one door, and two leaves for the other.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:25">41:25</A>&nbsp;And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,  cherubim and palm-trees, as there were made upon the walls; and  there was a wooden portal in front of the porch without,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:26">41:26</A>&nbsp;and closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on  the other side, on the sides of the porch and the side chambers  of the house and the portals.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:1">42:1</A>&nbsp;And he brought me forth into the outer court, the way  toward the north; and he brought me to the cells that were over  against the separate place and which were over against the  building, toward the north,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:2">42:2</A>&nbsp;before the length of the hundred cubits: the entry was on  the north, and the breadth was fifty cubits,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:3">42:3</A>&nbsp;over against the twenty [cubits] that pertained to the  inner court, and over against the pavement that pertained to  the outer court; there was gallery against gallery in the third  [story];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:4">42:4</A>&nbsp;and before the cells was a walk of ten cubits in breadth,  [and] a way of a hundred cubits inward; and their entries were  toward the north.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:5">42:5</A>&nbsp;And the upper cells, because the galleries encroached on  them, were shorter than the lower, and than the middle-most of  the building.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:6">42:6</A>&nbsp;For they were in three [stories], but had not pillars as  the pillars of the courts; therefore [the third story] was  straitened more than the lowest and the middle-most from the  ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:7">42:7</A>&nbsp;And the wall that was without, answering to the cells,  toward the outer court in the front of the cells, its length  was fifty cubits:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:8">42:8</A>&nbsp;for the length of the cells that were against the outer  court was fifty cubits; but behold, before the temple it was a  hundred cubits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:9">42:9</A>&nbsp;And under these cells was the entry from the east, as one  goeth into them from the outer court.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:10">42:10</A>&nbsp;In the breadth of the wall of the court toward the south,  before the separate place, and before the building, were cells;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:11">42:11</A>&nbsp;and a passage before them, like the appearance of the  cells that were toward the north, according to their length,  according to their breadth and all their goings out, and  according to their fashions, and according to their doors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:12">42:12</A>&nbsp;And according to the doors of the cells that were toward  the south there was a door at the head of the way, the way  directly before the corresponding wall toward the east as one  entereth into them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:13">42:13</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, The north cells [and] the south  cells, which are before the separate place, they are holy  cells, where the priests that come near unto Jehovah shall eat  the most holy things; there shall they lay the most holy  things, both the oblation and the sin-offering and the  trespass-offering: for the place is holy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:14">42:14</A>&nbsp;When the priests enter in, they shall not go forth from  the sanctuary into the outer court, but there they shall lay  their garments wherein they minister, for they are holy; and  they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that  which is for the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:15">42:15</A>&nbsp;And when he had made an end of measuring the inner house,  he brought me forth toward the gate whose front was toward the  east, and measured [the enclosure] round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:16">42:16</A>&nbsp;He measured the east side with the measuring-reed, five  hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:17">42:17</A>&nbsp;He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the  measuring-reed round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:18">42:18</A>&nbsp;He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the  measuring-reed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:19">42:19</A>&nbsp;He turned about to the west side, [and] measured five  hundred reeds with the measuring-reed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:20">42:20</A>&nbsp;He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall round  about, five hundred long, and five hundred broad, to make a  separation between that which was holy and that which was  common.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:1">43:1</A>&nbsp;And he brought me unto the gate, the gate which looked  toward the east.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:2">43:2</A>&nbsp;And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the  way of the east; and his voice was like the voice of many  waters; and the earth was lit up with his glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:3">43:3</A>&nbsp;And the appearance of the vision that I saw was according  to the vision that I had seen when I came to destroy the city;  and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river  Chebar: and I fell upon my face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:4">43:4</A>&nbsp;And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of  the gate whose front was toward the east.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:5">43:5</A>&nbsp;And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner  court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:6">43:6</A>&nbsp;And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a  man was standing by me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:7">43:7</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, [this is] the place of my  throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will  dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever; and the  house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, they nor  their kings, with their fornication, and with the carcases of  their kings [in] their high places,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:8">43:8</A>&nbsp;in that they set their threshold by my threshold, and their  post by my post, and [there was only] a wall between me and  them, and they defiled my holy name with their abominations  which they committed; and I consumed them in mine anger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:9">43:9</A>&nbsp;Now let them put away their fornication, and the carcases  of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of  them for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:10">43:10</A>&nbsp;Thou, son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel,  that they may be confounded at their iniquities; and let them  measure the pattern.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:11">43:11</A>&nbsp;And if they be confounded at all that they have done, make  known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its  goings out, and its comings in, and all its forms, and all its  statutes, yea, all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof;  and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form  thereof, and all the statutes thereof, and do them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:12">43:12</A>&nbsp;This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain  all its border round about is most holy. Behold, this is the  law of the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:13">43:13</A>&nbsp;And these are the measures of the altar in cubits: the  cubit is a cubit and a hand breadth. The bottom was a cubit [in  height] and the breadth a cubit, and its border on the edge  thereof round about, one span: and this was the base of the  altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:14">43:14</A>&nbsp;And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower settle  was two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the small  settle to the great settle, four cubits, and the breadth a  cubit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:15">43:15</A>&nbsp;And the upper altar was four cubits; and from the hearth  of &#249;God and upward were four horns.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:16">43:16</A>&nbsp;And the hearth of &#249;God was twelve [cubits] long, by twelve  broad, square in the four sides thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:17">43:17</A>&nbsp;And the settle was fourteen [cubits] long by fourteen  broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it, half  a cubit; and the bottom thereof a cubit round about: and its  steps looked toward the east.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:18">43:18</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord  Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when  they shall make it, to offer up burnt-offerings thereon, and to  sprinkle blood thereon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:19">43:19</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of  the seed of Zadok, who come near unto me, to minister unto me,  saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:20">43:20</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt take of its blood, and put it on the four  horns thereof, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon  the border round about: so shalt thou purge and make atonement  for it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:21">43:21</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt take the bullock of the sin-offering, and  it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside  the sanctuary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:22">43:22</A>&nbsp;And on the second day thou shalt present a he-goat without  blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall purge the altar, as  they purged it with the bullock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:23">43:23</A>&nbsp;When thou hast ended purging it, thou shalt present a  young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock  without blemish;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:24">43:24</A>&nbsp;and thou shalt present them before Jehovah; and the  priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up  for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:25">43:25</A>&nbsp;Seven days shalt thou offer daily a goat for a  sin-offering; they shall also offer a young bullock, and a ram  out of the flock without blemish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:26">43:26</A>&nbsp;Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and  purify it, and consecrate it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:27">43:27</A>&nbsp;And when these days are ended, it shall be that upon the  eighth day and onwards the priests shall offer your  burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I  will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:1">44:1</A>&nbsp;And he brought me back toward the outer gate of the  sanctuary which looked toward the east; and it was shut.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:2">44:2</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto me, This gate shall be shut; it shall  not be opened, and no one shall enter in by it: for Jehovah,  the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; and it shall be shut.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:3">44:3</A>&nbsp;As for the prince, he, the prince, shall sit in it to eat  bread before Jehovah: he shall enter by the way of the porch of  the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:4">44:4</A>&nbsp;And he brought me the way of the north gate before the  house; and I beheld, and lo, the glory of Jehovah filled the  house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:5">44:5</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, apply thy heart, and  behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say  unto thee concerning all the statutes of the house of Jehovah,  and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the  house, with every going forth of the sanctuary;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:6">44:6</A>&nbsp;and say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, Thus  saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you of all your  abominations, O house of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:7">44:7</A>&nbsp;in that ye have brought strangers, uncircumcised in heart  and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane  it, [even] my house, when ye offered my bread, the fat and the  blood; and they have broken my covenant besides all your  abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:8">44:8</A>&nbsp;And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things, but have  set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:9">44:9</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: No stranger, uncircumcised in  heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my  sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of  Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:10">44:10</A>&nbsp;But the Levites who went away far from me, when Israel  went astray, going astray from me after their idols, they shall  even bear their iniquity;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:11">44:11</A>&nbsp;but they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having  oversight at the gates of the house, and doing the service of  the house: they shall slaughter the burnt-offering and the  sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to  minister unto them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:12">44:12</A>&nbsp;Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and  were unto the house of Israel a stumbling-block of iniquity;  therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord  Jehovah, that they shall bear their iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:13">44:13</A>&nbsp;And they shall not draw near unto me, to do the office of  a priest unto me, nor to draw near to any of my holy things,  [even] to the most holy; but they shall bear their confusion,  and their abominations which they have committed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:14">44:14</A>&nbsp;And I will make them keepers of the charge of the house,  for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done  therein.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:15">44:15</A>&nbsp;But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept  the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went  astray from me, they shall approach unto me to minister unto  me, and they shall stand before me to present unto me the fat  and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:16">44:16</A>&nbsp;They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall  approach unto my table, to minister unto me, and they shall  keep my charge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:17">44:17</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass when they enter in at the gates  of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments;  and no wool shall come upon them, when they minister in the  gates of the inner court, and towards the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:18">44:18</A>&nbsp;They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall  have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird on  anything that causeth sweat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:19">44:19</A>&nbsp;And when they go forth into the outer court, into the  outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments  wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy cells; and  they shall put on other garments, that they may not hallow the  people with their garments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:20">44:20</A>&nbsp;Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their  locks to grow long: they shall duly poll their heads.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:21">44:21</A>&nbsp;Neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter into  the inner court.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:22">44:22</A>&nbsp;And they shall not take for their wives a widow, nor her  that is put away; but they shall take maidens of the seed of  the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:23">44:23</A>&nbsp;And they shall teach my people [the difference] between  holy and profane, and cause them to discern between unclean and  clean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:24">44:24</A>&nbsp;And in controversy they shall stand to judge: they shall  judge it according to my judgments; and they shall keep my laws  and my statutes in all my solemnities; and they shall hallow my  sabbaths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:25">44:25</A>&nbsp;And they shall come at no dead person to become unclean;  but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for  brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may  become unclean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:26">44:26</A>&nbsp;And after he is cleansed, they shall count unto him seven  days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:27">44:27</A>&nbsp;And on the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the  inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall present his  sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:28">44:28</A>&nbsp;And it shall be unto them for an inheritance; I am their  inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I  am their possession.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:29">44:29</A>&nbsp;They shall eat the oblation and the sin-offering and the  trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be  theirs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:30">44:30</A>&nbsp;And the first of all the first-fruits of every [kind], and  every heave-offering of every [kind], of all your  heave-offerings, shall be for the priests; ye shall also give  unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the  blessing to rest on thy house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:31">44:31</A>&nbsp;The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of  itself, or of that which is torn, whether of fowl or of beast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:1">45:1</A>&nbsp;And when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,  ye shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah, a holy portion of  the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty  thousand [cubits], and the breadth ten thousand. This shall be  holy in all the borders thereof round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:2">45:2</A>&nbsp;Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred  [reeds] by five hundred, square round about; and fifty cubits  round about for the suburbs thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:3">45:3</A>&nbsp;And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five  and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand; and in it  shall be the sanctuary, the holy of holies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:4">45:4</A>&nbsp;This is the holy [portion] of the land; it shall be for the  priests who do the service of the sanctuary, who draw near to  serve Jehovah, and it shall be a place for their houses, and a  holy place for the sanctuary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:5">45:5</A>&nbsp;And [a space of] five and twenty thousand in length, and  ten thousand in breadth, shall the Levites, who do the service  of the house, have for themselves, for a possession, for their  habitations.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:7">45:7</A>&nbsp;And the prince shall have [his portion] on the one side and  on the other side of the holy heave-offering and of the  possession of the city, over against the holy heave-offering,  and over against the possession of the city, from the west side  westward, and from the east side eastward; and in length  answering to one of the portions [of the tribes] from the west  border unto the east border.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:8">45:8</A>&nbsp;As land shall it be his for a possession in Israel; and my  princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give  the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:9">45:9</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, princes of  Israel! Put away violence and spoil, and execute judgment and  justice; take off your exactions from my people, saith the Lord  Jehovah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:12">45:12</A>&nbsp;And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels,  five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:13">45:13</A>&nbsp;This is the heave-offering which ye shall offer: the sixth  part of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the  sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of barley;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_46:4">46:4</A>&nbsp;And the burnt-offering that the prince shall present unto  Jehovah on the sabbath-day shall be six lambs without blemish,  and a ram without blemish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:5">46:5</A>&nbsp;And the oblation shall be an ephah for a ram, and the  oblation for the lambs as he shall be able to give; and oil, a  hin for an ephah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:6">46:6</A>&nbsp;And on the day of the new moon, a young bullock without  blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without  blemish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:7">46:7</A>&nbsp;And he shall offer an oblation, an ephah for the bullock,  and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according to what  his hand may attain unto; and oil, a hin for an ephah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:8">46:8</A>&nbsp;And when the prince cometh in, he shall come in by the way  of the porch of the gate, and he shall go out by the way  thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:9">46:9</A>&nbsp;And when the people of the land come in before Jehovah in  the set feasts, he that cometh in by the way of the north gate  to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he  that cometh in by the way of the south gate shall go out by the  way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the  gate by which he came in, but shall go out straight before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:10">46:10</A>&nbsp;And the prince shall come in in the midst of them, when  they come in; and when they go out, they shall go out  [together].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:11">46:11</A>&nbsp;And on the feast-days, and in the solemnities, the  oblation shall be an ephah for a bullock and an ephah for a  ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give; and oil, a hin  for an ephah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:12">46:12</A>&nbsp;And when the prince shall offer a voluntary burnt-offering  or voluntary peace-offerings unto Jehovah, the gate that  looketh toward the east shall be opened for him and he shall  offer his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings as he did on  the sabbath-day, and he shall go out again, and the gate shall  be shut after he hath gone out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:13">46:13</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt daily offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah,  of a yearling-lamb without blemish: thou shalt prepare it  morning by morning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:14">46:14</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt prepare an oblation with it every morning,  the sixth part of an ephah, and of oil the third part of a hin,  to moisten the fine flour: an oblation unto Jehovah continually  by a perpetual ordinance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:15">46:15</A>&nbsp;They shall offer the lamb, and the oblation, and the oil,  every morning for a continual burnt-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:16">46:16</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift  unto any of his sons, it shall be that one's inheritance, for  his sons: it shall be their possession by inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:17">46:17</A>&nbsp;But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his  servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty; and it  shall return to the prince: to his sons alone shall his  inheritance remain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:18">46:18</A>&nbsp;And the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance,  to thrust them by oppression out of their possession: he shall  give his sons an inheritance out of his own possession: that my  people be not scattered every one from his possession.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:19">46:19</A>&nbsp;Then he brought me through the passage which was at the  side of the gate, into the holy cells which were for the  priests, which looked toward the north; and behold, a place was  there at the end westward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:20">46:20</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests  shall boil the trespass-offering, and the sin-offering, [and]  where they shall bake the oblation, that they bring them not  out into the outer court, so as to hallow the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:21">46:21</A>&nbsp;And he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused  me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in  every corner of the court there was a court.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:22">46:22</A>&nbsp;In the four corners of the court there were enclosed  courts, forty [cubits] long and thirty broad: these four corner  courts were of one measure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:23">46:23</A>&nbsp;And there was a row [of building] round about in them,  round about those four, and it was made with boiling places  under the rows round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:24">46:24</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, These are the boiling-houses, where  those who do the service of the house shall boil the sacrifice  of the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:1">47:1</A>&nbsp;And he brought me back to the door of the house; and  behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house  eastward: for the front of the house was eastward. And the  waters came down from under, from the right side of the house,  south of the altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:2">47:2</A>&nbsp;And he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and  led me round outside unto the outer gate towards [the gate]  that looketh eastward; and behold, waters ran out on the right  side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:3">47:3</A>&nbsp;When the man went forth eastward, a line was in his hand;  and he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass  through the waters: the waters were to the ankles.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:4">47:4</A>&nbsp;And he measured a thousand [cubits], and caused me to pass  through the waters: the waters were to the knees. And he  measured a thousand and caused me to pass through: the waters  were to the loins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:5">47:5</A>&nbsp;And he measured a thousand: it was a river that I could not  pass through, for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a  river that could not be passed through.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:6">47:6</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen [this]? And  he led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:7">47:7</A>&nbsp;When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very  many trees on the one side and on the other.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:8">47:8</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, These waters issue out toward the east  district, and go down into the plain, and go into the sea; when  they are brought forth into the sea, the waters [thereof] shall  be healed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:9">47:9</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass that every living thing which  moveth, whithersoever the double river shall come, shall live.  And there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these  waters shall come thither, and [the waters of the sea] shall be  healed; and everything shall live whither the river cometh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:10">47:10</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand upon  it; from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be [a place] to  spread forth nets: their fish shall be according to their  kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:11">47:11</A>&nbsp;But its marshes and its pools shall not be healed; they  shall be given up to salt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:12">47:12</A>&nbsp;And by the river, upon its bank, on the one side and on  the other, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not  fade, nor their fruit fail: it shall bring forth new fruit  every month, for its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and the  fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for  medicine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:13">47:13</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This shall be the border  whereby ye shall allot the land as inheritance according to the  twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph [shall have two] portions.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:14">47:14</A>&nbsp;And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, [the  land] concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your  fathers; and this land shall fall to you for inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:15">47:15</A>&nbsp;And this shall be the border of the land: toward the north  side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to  Zedad,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:16">47:16</A>&nbsp;Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of  Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by  the border of Hauran.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:17">47:17</A>&nbsp;And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the  border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of  Hamath: this is the north side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:18">47:18</A>&nbsp;-- And on the east side ye shall measure between Hauran  and Damascus, and Gilead and the land of Israel [by] the  Jordan, from the border unto the east sea: this is the east  side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:19">47:19</A>&nbsp;-- And the south side southward, from Tamar to the waters  of Meribah-Kadesh, by the torrent, unto the great sea: this is  the south side southward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:20">47:20</A>&nbsp;-- And the west side shall be the great sea from the  border, as far as over against the entering into Hamath: this  is the west side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:21">47:21</A>&nbsp;And ye shall divide this land unto you according to the  tribes of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:22">47:22</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass that ye shall divide it by lot  for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn  among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall  be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel: with  you shall they draw by lot inheritance among the tribes of  Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:23">47:23</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass that in the tribe in which the  stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give [him] his inheritance,  saith the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:1">48:1</A>&nbsp;And these are the names of the tribes: From the north end  along the way of Hethlon, as one entereth into Hamath,  Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus northward unto near Hamath  -- the east and west side [belonging] to him -- shall Dan have  one [portion].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:2">48:2</A>&nbsp;And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west  side, Asher one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:3">48:3</A>&nbsp;And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto  the west side, Naphtali one.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_48:8">48:8</A>&nbsp;And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the  west side, shall be the heave-offering that ye shall offer,  five and twenty thousand [cubits] in breadth, and in length as  one of the parts from the east side unto the west side: and the  sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:9">48:9</A>&nbsp;The heave-offering that ye shall offer unto Jehovah shall  be five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in  breadth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:10">48:10</A>&nbsp;And for them, for the priests, shall be the holy  heave-offering, toward the north five and twenty thousand, and  toward the west the breadth ten thousand, and toward the east  the breadth ten thousand, and toward the south the length five  and twenty thousand: and the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in  the midst of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:11">48:11</A>&nbsp;[It shall be] for the priests that are hallowed of the  sons of Zadok, who kept my charge and went not astray when the  children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:12">48:12</A>&nbsp;And this offering heaved from the heave-offering of the  land shall be unto them a thing most holy, by the border of the  Levites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:13">48:13</A>&nbsp;And answering to the border of the priests, the Levites  shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand  in breadth: the whole length shall be five and twenty thousand,  and the breadth ten thousand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:14">48:14</A>&nbsp;And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor  alienate the first-fruits of the land: for it is holy unto  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:15">48:15</A>&nbsp;And the five thousand that are left in the breadth over  against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a common [place]  for the city, for dwellings and for suburbs: and the city shall  be in the midst of it.</p>
