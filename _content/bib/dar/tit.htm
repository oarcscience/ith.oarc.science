<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, bondman of God, and apostle of Jesus Christ according  to [the] faith of God's elect, and knowledge of [the] truth  which [is] according to piety;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;in [the] hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie,  promised before the ages of time,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;but has manifested in its own due season his word, in [the]  proclamation with which *I* have been entrusted, according to  [the] commandment of our Saviour God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;to Titus, my own child according to [the] faith common [to  us]: Grace and peace from God [the] Father, and Christ Jesus  our Saviour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest go  on to set right what remained [unordered], and establish elders  in each city, as *I* had ordered thee:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;if any one be free from all charge [against him], husband of  one wife, having believing children not accused of excess or  unruly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;For the overseer must be free from all charge [against him]  as God's steward; not headstrong, not passionate, not  disorderly through wine, not a striker, not seeking gain by  base means;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;but hospitable, a lover of goodness, discreet, just, pious,  temperate,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;clinging to the faithful word according to the doctrine  taught, that he may be able both to encourage with sound  teaching and refute gainsayers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;For there are many and disorderly vain speakers and  deceivers of people's minds, specially those of [the]  circumcision,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;who must have their mouths stopped, who subvert whole  houses, teaching things which ought not [to be taught] for the  sake of base gain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;One of themselves, a prophet of their own, has said,  Cretans are always liars, evil wild beasts, lazy gluttons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;This testimony is true; for which cause rebuke them  severely, that they may be sound in the faith,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;not turning [their] minds to Jewish fables and commandments  of men turning away from the truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;All things [are] pure to the pure; but to the defiled and  unbelieving nothing [is] pure; but both their mind and their  conscience are defiled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;They profess to know God, but in works deny [him], being  abominable, and disobedient, and found worthless as to every  good work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;But do *thou* speak the things that become sound teaching;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;that the elder men be sober, grave, discreet, sound in  faith, in love, in patience;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;that the elder women in like manner be in deportment as  becoming those who have to say to sacred things, not  slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is  right;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;that they may admonish the young women to be attached to  [their] husbands, to be attached to [their] children,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;discreet, chaste, diligent in home work, good, subject to  their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken  of.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;The younger men in like manner exhort to be discreet:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;in all things affording thyself as a pattern of good works;  in teaching uncorruptedness, gravity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;a sound word, not to be condemned; that he who is opposed  may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;bondmen to be subject to their own masters, to make  themselves acceptable in everything; not gainsaying;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;not robbing [their masters], but shewing all good fidelity,  that they may adorn the teaching which [is] of our Saviour God  in all things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;For the grace of God which carries with it salvation for  all men has appeared,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;teaching us that, having denied impiety and worldly lusts,  we should live soberly, and justly, and piously in the present  course of things,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our  great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all  lawlessness, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous  for good works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all  authority. Let no one despise thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Put them in mind to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to  be obedient to rule, to be ready to do every good work,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, [to be]  mild, shewing all meekness towards all men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;For we were once ourselves also without intelligence,  disobedient, wandering in error, serving various lusts and  pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one  another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God  appeared,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;not on the principle of works which [have been done] in  righteousness which *we* had done, but according to his own  mercy he saved us through [the] washing of regeneration and  renewal of [the] Holy Spirit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our  Saviour;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;that, having been justified by *his* grace, we should become  heirs according to [the] hope of eternal life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;The word [is] faithful, and I desire that thou insist  strenuously on these things, that they who have believed God  may take care to pay diligent attention to good works. These  things are good and profitable to men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;But foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes, and  contentions about the law, shun; for they are unprofitable and  vain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;An heretical man after a first and second admonition have  done with,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being  self-condemned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, use  diligence to come to me to Nicopolis; for I have decided to  winter there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Zenas the lawyer and Apollos set forward diligently on  their way, that nothing may be lacking to them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;and let ours also learn to apply themselves to good works  for necessary wants, that they may not be unfruitful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;All with me salute thee. Salute those who love us in [the]  faith. Grace [be] with you all.</p>
