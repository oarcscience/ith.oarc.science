<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah called to Moses and spoke to him out of the tent  of meeting, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them, When  any man of you presenteth an offering to Jehovah, ye shall  present your offering of the cattle, of the herd and of the  flock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall  present it a male without blemish: at the entrance of the tent  of meeting shall he present it, for his acceptance before  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And he shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt-offering;  and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And he shall slaughter the bullock before Jehovah; and  Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood and sprinkle  the blood round about on the altar that is at the entrance of  the tent of meeting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it up into its  pieces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the  altar, and lay wood in order on the fire;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the  head, and the fat, in order on the wood that is on the fire  which is on the altar;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;but its inwards and its legs shall he wash in water; and the  priest shall burn all on the altar, a burnt-offering, an  offering by fire to Jehovah of a sweet odour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;And if his offering be of the flock, of the sheep or of the  goats, for a burnt-offering, he shall present it a male without  blemish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar  northward before Jehovah; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall  sprinkle its blood on the altar round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And he shall cut it into its pieces, and its head, and its  fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is  on the fire which is on the altar;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and  the priest shall present [it] all, and burn [it] on the altar:  it is a burnt-offering, an offering by fire to Jehovah of a  sweet odour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And if his offering to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of  fowls, then he shall present his offering of turtle-doves, or  of young pigeons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall bring it near to the altar and pinch  off its head and burn it on the altar; and its blood shall be  pressed out at the side of the altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And he shall remove its crop with its feathers, and cast it  beside the altar on the east, into the place of the ashes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;and he shall split it open at its wings, [but] shall not  divide [it] asunder; and the priest shall burn it on the altar  on the wood that is on the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an  offering by fire to Jehovah of a sweet odour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And when any one will present an oblation to Jehovah, his  offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it,  and put frankincense thereon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests; and he  shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of  the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the  priest shall burn the memorial thereof on the altar, an  offering by fire to Jehovah of a sweet odour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And the remainder of the oblation shall be Aaron's and his  sons': [it is] most holy of Jehovah's offerings by fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And if thou present an offering of an oblation baken in the  oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with  oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And if thine offering be an oblation [baken] on the pan, it  shall be fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is an  oblation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;And if thine offering be an oblation [prepared] in the  cauldron, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt bring the oblation that is made of these  things to Jehovah; and it shall be presented to the priest, and  he shall bring it to the altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall take from the oblation a memorial  thereof, and shall burn it on the altar, an offering by fire to  Jehovah of a sweet odour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And the remainder of the oblation [shall be] Aaron's and  his sons': [it is] most holy of Jehovah's offerings by fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;No oblation which ye shall present to Jehovah shall be made  with leaven; for no leaven and no honey shall ye burn [in] any  fire-offering to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;As to the offering of the first-fruits, ye shall present  them to Jehovah; but they shall not be offered upon the altar  for a sweet odour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And every offering of thine oblation shalt thou season with  salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy  God to be lacking from thine oblation: with all thine offerings  thou shalt offer salt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And if thou present an oblation of thy first-fruits to  Jehovah, thou shalt present as the oblation of thy first-fruits  green ears of corn roasted in fire, corn beaten out of full  ears.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt put oil on it, and lay frankincense thereon:  it is an oblation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall burn the memorial thereof, [part] of  the beaten corn thereof, and [part] of the oil thereof, with  all the frankincense thereof: [it is] an offering by fire to  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace-offering, -- if  he present [it] of the herd, whether a male or female, he shall  present it without blemish before Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and  slaughter it at the entrance of the tent of meeting; and  Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood on the  altar round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offering an  offering by fire to Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards,  and all the fat that is on the inwards,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is  by the flanks, and the net above the liver which he shall take  away as far as the kidneys;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;and Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the  burnt-offering which [lieth] on the wood that is upon the fire:  [it is] an offering by fire to Jehovah of a sweet odour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offering to  Jehovah be of small cattle, male or female, he shall present it  without blemish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;If he present a sheep for his offering, then shall he  present it before Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;and shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and  slaughter it before the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons shall  sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offering an  offering by fire to Jehovah; the fat thereof, the whole fat  tail, which he shall take off close by the backbone, and the  fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is on the  inwards,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is  by the flanks, and the net above the liver which he shall take  away as far as the kidneys;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;and the priest shall burn it on the altar: [it is] the food  of the offering by fire to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And if his offering be a goat, then he shall present it  before Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;And he shall lay his hand on the head of it, and slaughter  it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall  sprinkle the blood thereof on the altar round about.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;[It is] an everlasting statute for your generations  throughout all your dwellings: no fat and no blood shall ye  eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall  sin through inadvertence against any of the commandments of  Jehovah [in things] that ought not to be done, and do any of  them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;if the priest that is anointed sin according to the trespass  of the people; then for his sin which he hath sinned shall he  present a young bullock without blemish to Jehovah for a  sin-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring the bullock to the entrance of the tent  of meeting before Jehovah; and shall lay his hand on the  bullock's head, and slaughter the bullock before Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's  blood, and bring it into the tent of meeting;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and  sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah before the  veil of the sanctuary;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;or if he touch the uncleanness of man, any uncleanness of  him by which he is defiled, and it be hid from him, when he  knoweth [it], then he is guilty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;Or if any one swear, talking rashly with the lips, to do  evil or to do good, in everything that a man shall say rashly  with an oath, and it be hid from him, when he knoweth [it],  then is he guilty in one of these.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these,  that he shall confess wherein he hath sinned;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;and he shall bring his trespass-offering to Jehovah for his  sin which he hath sinned, a female from the small cattle, a  sheep or doe goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall  make atonement for him [to cleanse him] from his sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;And if his hand be not able to bring what is so much as a  sheep, then he shall bring for his trespass which he hath  sinned two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, to Jehovah; one  for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall present  that which is for the sin-offering first, and pinch off his  head at the neck, but shall not divide it;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;And he shall make restitution for the wrong that he hath  done in the holy things, and shall add the fifth part thereto,  and shall give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make  atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and it  shall be forgiven him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And if any one sin and do against any of all the  commandments of Jehovah what should not be done, and hath not  known [it], yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the  burnt-offering; this, the burnt-offering, shall be on the  hearth on the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of  the altar shall be kept burning on it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall put on his linen raiment, and his  linen breeches shall he put on his flesh, and take up the ashes  to which the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the  altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And he shall put off his garments, and put on other  garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a  clean place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning on it: it  shall not be put out; and the priest shall burn wood on it  every morning, and lay the burnt-offering in order upon it; and  he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;A continual fire shall be kept burning on the altar: it  shall never go out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;And this is the law of the oblation: [one of] the sons of  Aaron shall present it before Jehovah, before the altar.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:16">26:16</A>&nbsp;I also will do this unto you -- I will even appoint over  you terror, consumption, and fever, which shall cause the eyes  to fail, and the soul to waste away; and ye shall sow your seed  in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:17">26:17</A>&nbsp;And I will set my face against you, that ye may be routed  before your enemies; they that hate you shall have dominion  over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:24">26:24</A>&nbsp;then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will smite  you, even I, sevenfold for your sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:25">26:25</A>&nbsp;And I will bring a sword upon you that avengeth with the  vengeance of the covenant, and ye shall be gathered together  into your cities, and I will send the pestilence among you; and  ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:26">26:26</A>&nbsp;When I break the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake  your bread in one oven, and shall deliver you the bread again  by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:28">26:28</A>&nbsp;then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I,  even I, will chastise you seven-fold for your sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:29">26:29</A>&nbsp;And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of  your daughters shall ye eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:30">26:30</A>&nbsp;And I will lay waste your high places, and cut down your  sun-pillars, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your  idols; and my soul shall abhor you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:31">26:31</A>&nbsp;And I will lay waste your cities and desolate your  sanctuaries; and I will not smell your sweet odours.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:32">26:32</A>&nbsp;And I will bring the land into desolation; that your  enemies who dwell there in may be astonished at it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:33">26:33</A>&nbsp;And I will scatter you among the nations, and will draw  out the sword after you; and your land shall be desolation, and  your cities waste.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:34">26:34</A>&nbsp;Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the  desolation, when ye are in your enemies' land; then shall the  land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:35">26:35</A>&nbsp;All the days of the desolation it shall rest, [the days  in] which it did not rest on your sabbaths, when ye dwelt  therein.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:36">26:36</A>&nbsp;And as to those that remain of you -- I will send  faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, that  the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall  flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none  pursueth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:37">26:37</A>&nbsp;and they shall stumble one over another, as it were before  a sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to  stand before your enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:38">26:38</A>&nbsp;And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of  your enemies shall eat you up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:39">26:39</A>&nbsp;And they that remain of you shall waste away through their  iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also through the  iniquities of their fathers shall they waste away with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:40">26:40</A>&nbsp;And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of  their fathers, through their unfaithfulness wherein they were  unfaithful to me, and also that they have walked contrary unto  me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:41">26:41</A>&nbsp;so that I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them  into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised  heart be humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their  iniquity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:42">26:42</A>&nbsp;I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my  covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I  remember; and I will remember the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:43">26:43</A>&nbsp;For the land shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its  sabbaths, when it is in desolation without them; and they shall  accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because  they despised my judgments, and their soul abhorred my  statutes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:44">26:44</A>&nbsp;And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their  enemies, I will not despise them, and will not abhor them, to  make an end of them utterly, to break my covenant with them,  for I am Jehovah their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:45">26:45</A>&nbsp;But I will remember toward them the covenant with their  ancestors whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before  the eyes of the nations, that I might be their God: I am  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:46">26:46</A>&nbsp;These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which  Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount  Sinai, by the hand of Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:1">27:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:2">27:2</A>&nbsp;Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them, When  any one devoteth [anything] by a vow, the persons shall be for  Jehovah according to thy valuation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:3">27:3</A>&nbsp;And thy valuation shall be of the male from twenty years  old even unto sixty years old: thy valuation shall be fifty  shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:4">27:4</A>&nbsp;and if it be of a female, thy valuation shall be thirty  shekels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:5">27:5</A>&nbsp;And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years  old, thy valuation of the male shall be twenty shekels, and for  the female ten shekels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:6">27:6</A>&nbsp;And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, thy  valuation of the male shall be five shekels of silver; and for  the female thy valuation shall be three shekels of silver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:7">27:7</A>&nbsp;And if it be from sixty years old and above, if it be a  male, thy valuation shall be fifteen shekels; and for the  female ten shekels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:8">27:8</A>&nbsp;And if he be poorer than thy valuation, he shall present  himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him:  according to his means that vowed shall the priest value him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:9">27:9</A>&nbsp;And if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto  Jehovah, all that they give of such unto Jehovah shall be holy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:10">27:10</A>&nbsp;They shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a bad,  or a bad for a good; and if he at all change beast for beast,  then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:11">27:11</A>&nbsp;And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not bring  an offering unto Jehovah, then he shall present the beast  before the priest;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:12">27:12</A>&nbsp;and the priest shall value it, [judging] between good and  bad: according to the valuation of the priest, so shall it be.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:13">27:13</A>&nbsp;And if they will in any wise redeem it, then they shall  add a fifth [part] thereof unto thy valuation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:14">27:14</A>&nbsp;And when any one halloweth his house, that it may be holy  to Jehovah, the priest shall value it, [judging] between good  and bad: as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:15">27:15</A>&nbsp;And if he that halloweth it will redeem his house, he  shall add the fifth of the money of thy valuation unto it, and  it shall be his.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:16">27:16</A>&nbsp;And if a man hallow to Jehovah [part] of a field of his  possession, thy valuation shall be according to what may be  sown in it: the homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of  silver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:17">27:17</A>&nbsp;If he hallow his field from the year of jubilee, according  to thy valuation shall it stand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:18">27:18</A>&nbsp;but if he hallow his field after the jubilee, then the  priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years  that remain, until the year of the jubilee; and there shall be  a reduction from thy valuation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:19">27:19</A>&nbsp;And if he that hallowed the field will in any wise redeem  it, he shall add the fifth of the money of thy valuation unto  it, and it shall be assured to him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:20">27:20</A>&nbsp;but if he do not redeem the field, or if he sell the field  to another man, it cannot be redeemed any more;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:21">27:21</A>&nbsp;and the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be  holy to Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof  shall be the priest's.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:22">27:22</A>&nbsp;And if he hallow to Jehovah a field that he hath bought,  which is not of the fields of his possession,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:23">27:23</A>&nbsp;the priest shall reckon unto him the amount of thy  valuation, unto the year of the jubilee; and he shall give thy  valuation on that day, [as] holy to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:24">27:24</A>&nbsp;In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him  of whom it was bought -- to him to whom the land belonged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:25">27:25</A>&nbsp;And all thy valuation shall be according to the shekel of  the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:26">27:26</A>&nbsp;Only the firstling which is offered as firstling to  Jehovah among the cattle, that shall no man hallow, whether it  be ox or sheep; it is Jehovah's.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:27">27:27</A>&nbsp;But if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it  according to thy valuation, and shall add a fifth of it  thereto; and if it be not redeemed, it shall be sold according  to thy valuation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:28">27:28</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man hath devoted  to Jehovah of all that he hath, of man or beast, or of the  field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every  devoted thing is most holy to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:29">27:29</A>&nbsp;Nothing devoted, which shall be devoted from among men,  shall be ransomed: it shall certainly be put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:30">27:30</A>&nbsp;And as to every tithe of the land, of the seed of the  land, and of the fruit of the tree, it is Jehovah's: it is holy  to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:31">27:31</A>&nbsp;And if any one will at all redeem of his tithes, he shall  add thereto the fifth thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:32">27:32</A>&nbsp;And as to every tithe of the herd, or of the flock, of  whatever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:33">27:33</A>&nbsp;He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither  shall he change it; and if he change it at all, then both it  and the exchange thereof shall be holy; it shall not be  redeemed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:34">27:34</A>&nbsp;These are the commandments which Jehovah commanded Moses  for the children of Israel upon mount Sinai.</p>
