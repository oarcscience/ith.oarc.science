<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to  David, to the cave of Adullam, when the army of the Philistines  was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;And David was then in the stronghold; and the Philistines'  garrison was then at Bethlehem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to  drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the  gate!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines,  and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the  gate, and took it, and brought it to David; David however would  not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;And he said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this  thing! should I drink the blood of these men [who went] at the  risk of their lives? for at the risk of their lives they  brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did  the three mighty men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was the chief of  three; and he brandished his spear against three hundred and  slew them; and he had a name among the three.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;Of the three he was more honourable than the two, and he  was their captain; but he did not attain to the [first] three.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man,  great in exploits, of Kabzeel: he it was that smote two lions  of Moab; and he went down and smote a lion in the midst of a  pit on a snowy day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;He also smote the Egyptian, a man of stature, five cubits  high: and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's  beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the  spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own  spear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he had a  name among the three mighty men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;Behold, he was honoured above the thirty, but he did not  attain to the [first] three. And David set him in his council.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;These are they that went over Jordan in the first month,  when it overflows all its banks, and they put to flight all  [them] of the valleys, toward the east and toward the west.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to  the stronghold to David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to  them, If ye come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be  knit unto you; but if to betray me to mine enemies, seeing  there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers see [it]  and rebuke [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;And the Spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the  captains, [and he said,] Thine [are we], David, And with thee,  thou son of Jesse: Peace, peace be to thee! And peace be to thy  helpers! For thy God helps thee. And David received them, and  made them chiefs of bands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came  with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped  them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon deliberation  sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul at the  peril of our heads.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;As he went away to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh:  Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and  Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of  Manasseh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;And they helped David in his expeditions; for they were  all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;For day by day there came [men] to David to help him,  until it was a great camp, like the camp of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;And this is the number of the men equipped for military  service, who came to David to Hebron, to transfer the kingdom  of Saul to him, according to the word of Jehovah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:31">12:31</A>&nbsp;And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who  were expressed by name, to come and make David king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:32">12:32</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Issachar, who had understanding of  the times, to know what Israel ought to do, the heads of them  were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their bidding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:33">12:33</A>&nbsp;Of Zebulun, such as went forth in the host, armed for war  with all weapons of war, fifty thousand, keeping rank without  double heart.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:35">12:35</A>&nbsp;And of the Danites armed for war twenty-eight thousand six  hundred.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:36">12:36</A>&nbsp;And of Asher such as went forth in the host, to set  themselves in battle array, forty thousand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:37">12:37</A>&nbsp;And from the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites,  and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all  manner of weapons of war for battle, a hundred and twenty  thousand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:38">12:38</A>&nbsp;All of them men of war, keeping rank in battle array, came  with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all  Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to  make David king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:39">12:39</A>&nbsp;And there they were with David three days, eating and  drinking; for their brethren had prepared for them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:40">12:40</A>&nbsp;and those too that were near them, as far as Issachar and  Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on asses, and on camels, and  on mules, and on oxen; provisions of meal, fig-cakes and  raisin-cakes, and wine and oil, and oxen and sheep, abundantly;  for there was joy in Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;And David consulted with the captains of thousands and  hundreds, with every prince.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;And David said to all the congregation of Israel, If it  seem good to you, and it be of Jehovah our God, let us send  abroad to our brethren everywhere, that are left in all the  lands of Israel, and with them to the priests and Levites in  their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves to  us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;and let us bring again the ark of our God to us; for we  inquired not of it in the days of Saul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;And all the congregation said that they should do so; for  the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;And David assembled all Israel from the Shihor of Egypt  unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from  Kirjath-jearim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, to  Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from  thence the ark of God, of Jehovah, who sitteth between the  cherubim, whose name is placed [there].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;And they carried the ark of God on a new cart out of the  house of Abinadab; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;And David and all Israel played before God with all their  might, and with singing, and with harps, and with lutes, and  with tambours, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza  put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen had stumbled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he  smote him, because he had put forth his hand to the ark; and  there he died before God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;And David was indignant; for Jehovah had made a breach  upon Uzza; and he called that place Perez-Uzza to this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I  bring the ark of God to me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;And David brought not the ark home unto himself into the  city of David, but he carried it aside into the house of  Obed-Edom the Gittite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom  in his house three months. And Jehovah blessed the house of  Obed-Edom, and all that he had.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber  of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king  over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted, because of his  people Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begot  more sons and daughters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;And these are the names of the children which he had in  Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over  all Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and  David heard [of it], and went out against them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the  valley of Rephaim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;And David inquired of God saying, Shall I go up against  the Philistines, and wilt thou give them into my hand? And  Jehovah said to him, Go up; and I will give them into thy hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;And they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them  there; and David said, God has broken in upon mine enemies by  my hand, as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore they called  the name of that place Baal-perazim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;And they left their gods there; and David commanded, and  they were burned with fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;And the Philistines yet again spread themselves in the  valley.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;And David inquired again of God; and God said to him, Go  not up after them; turn round them and come upon them opposite  the mulberry-trees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching  in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out  to battle; for God will have gone forth before thee to smite  the army of the Philistines.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;And David did as God commanded him; and they smote the  army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah  brought the fear of him upon all the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;And he made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a  place for the ark of God, and spread a tent for it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the  Levites, for them has Jehovah chosen to carry the ark of God,  and to serve him for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;And David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up  the ark of Jehovah to its place that he had prepared for it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;And David gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brethren a  hundred and twenty;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brethren  two hundred and twenty;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brethren a  hundred and thirty;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brethren  eighty;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his  brethren a hundred and twelve.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and  for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and  Eliel, and Amminadab;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;and he said to them, Ye are the chief fathers of the  Levites; hallow yourselves, ye and your brethren, that ye may  bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to [the place  that] I have prepared for it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;For because ye did [it] not at the first, Jehovah our God  made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due  order.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;So the priests and the Levites hallowed themselves to  bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon  their shoulders with the staves upon them, as Moses had  commanded according to the word of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:16">15:16</A>&nbsp;And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint  their brethren, the singers, with instruments of music, lutes,  and harps, and cymbals, that they should sound aloud, lifting  up the voice with joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;And the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of  his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of  Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites for the music, gave  instruction in music, for he was skilful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai,  and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew with  the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-Edom and Jehijah  were doorkeepers for the ark.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;And David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over  thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah  out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore  the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven  bullocks and seven rams.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;And David was clothed with a robe of byssus, and all the  Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah chief  of the music of the singers; and David had upon him a linen  ephod.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:28">15:28</A>&nbsp;And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the trumpet, and with  clarions, and with cymbals, playing aloud with lutes and harps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:29">15:29</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah  came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul  looked through a window, and saw king David dancing and  playing; and she despised him in her heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst  of the tent that David had spread for it; and they presented  burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;And when David had ended offering up the burnt-offerings  and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to  every one a loaf of bread and a measure [of wine] and a  raisin-cake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;And he appointed certain of the Levites to do the service  before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate, and to thank and  praise Jehovah the God of Israel:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and  Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah  and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of lutes and with  harps; and Asaph sounding with cymbals;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets  continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;Then on that day David delivered first [this psalm] to give  thanks to Jehovah through Asaph and his brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;Give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known  his acts among the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him; Meditate upon all his  wondrous works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;Glory in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that  seek Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;Seek Jehovah and his strength, Seek his face continually;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;Remember his wondrous works which he hath done; His  miracles, and the judgments of his mouth:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;Ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye sons of Jacob, his  chosen ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;He, Jehovah, is our God; His judgments are in all the  earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;Be ye ever mindful of his covenant, The word which he  commanded to a thousand generations, --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;Which he made with Abraham, And of his oath unto Isaac;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;And he confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute, Unto Israel  for an everlasting covenant,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot  of your inheritance;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;When ye were a few men in number, Of small account, and  strangers in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;And they went from nation to nation, And from one kingdom  to another people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:21">16:21</A>&nbsp;He suffered no man to oppress them, And reproved kings for  their sakes,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:22">16:22</A>&nbsp;[Saying,] Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets  no harm.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:23">16:23</A>&nbsp;Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Publish his salvation  from day to day.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:25">16:25</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah is great, and exceedingly to be praised; And  he is terrible above all gods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:26">16:26</A>&nbsp;For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Jehovah  made the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:27">16:27</A>&nbsp;Majesty and splendour are before him; Strength and  gladness in his place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:28">16:28</A>&nbsp;Give unto Jehovah, ye families of peoples, Give unto  Jehovah glory and strength!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:29">16:29</A>&nbsp;Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name! Bring an  oblation, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy  splendour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:30">16:30</A>&nbsp;Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is  established, it shall not be moved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:31">16:31</A>&nbsp;Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; And  let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth!</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:33">16:33</A>&nbsp;Then shall the trees of the forest sing out at the  presence of Jehovah, For he cometh to judge the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:34">16:34</A>&nbsp;Give thanks unto Jehovah, for he is good; For his  loving-kindness [endureth] for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:35">16:35</A>&nbsp;And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us,  and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy  name, To triumph in thy praise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:36">16:36</A>&nbsp;Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, from eternity and to  eternity! And all the people said, Amen! and praised Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:37">16:37</A>&nbsp;And he left there, before the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to do the service before the  ark continually, as every day's duty required;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:38">16:38</A>&nbsp;and Obed-Edom, and their brethren, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom  also, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah as doorkeepers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:39">16:39</A>&nbsp;And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before  the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:40">16:40</A>&nbsp;to offer up burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the altar of  burnt-offering continually, morning and evening, and according  to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he  commanded Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:41">16:41</A>&nbsp;and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were  chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to Jehovah,  because his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:42">16:42</A>&nbsp;and with them, [with] Heman and Jeduthun, trumpets and  cymbals for those that should sound aloud; and the musical  instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were at the gate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:43">16:43</A>&nbsp;And all the people departed every one to his house; and  David returned to bless his household.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as David dwelt in his house, that David  said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of  cedars, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah under curtains.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in thy heart; for  God is with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass that night that the word of God came to  Nathan saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;Go and say to David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou  shalt not build me a house to dwell in;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I  brought up Israel to this day; but I have been from tent to  tent, and from [one] tabernacle [to another].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;In all my going about with all Israel, did I speak a word  to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my  people, saying, Why build ye me not a house of cedars?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;And now, thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus  saith Jehovah of hosts: I took thee from the pasture-grounds,  from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and  have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made  thee a name, like unto the name of the great men that are on  the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will  plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be  disturbed no more; neither shall the sons of wickedness waste  them any more, as formerly,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;and since the days that I commanded judges to be over my  people Israel. And I will subdue all thine enemies; and I tell  thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled  that thou must go [to be] with thy fathers, that I will set up  thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will  establish his kingdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;It is he who shall build me a house, and I will establish  his throne for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;I will be his father, and he shall be my son; and I will  not take away my mercy from him, as I took it from him that was  before thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;and I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for  ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:15">17:15</A>&nbsp;According to all these words, and according to all this  vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:16">17:16</A>&nbsp;And king David went in and sat before Jehovah, and said,  Who am I, Jehovah Elohim, and what is my house, that thou hast  brought me hitherto?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:17">17:17</A>&nbsp;And this hath been a small thing in thy sight, O God; and  thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to  come, and hast regarded me according to the rank of a man of  high degree, Jehovah Elohim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:18">17:18</A>&nbsp;What can David [say] more to thee for the glory of thy  servant? thou indeed knowest thy servant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:19">17:19</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine  own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, to make known all  these great things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:20">17:20</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God  beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:21">17:21</A>&nbsp;And who is like thy people Israel, the one nation in the  earth that God went to redeem to be a people to himself, to  make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out  nations from before thy people, which thou hast redeemed out of  Egypt?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:22">17:22</A>&nbsp;And thy people Israel hast thou made thine own people for  ever; and thou, Jehovah, art become their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:23">17:23</A>&nbsp;And now, Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken  concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established  for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:24">17:24</A>&nbsp;Let it even be established, and let thy name be magnified  for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, is God  to Israel; and let the house of David thy servant be  established before thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:25">17:25</A>&nbsp;For thou, my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou  wilt build him a house; therefore hath thy servant found [in  his heart] to pray before thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:26">17:26</A>&nbsp;And now, Jehovah, thou art that God, and hast promised  this goodness unto thy servant;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:27">17:27</A>&nbsp;and now, let it please thee to bless the house of thy  servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou,  Jehovah, hast blessed [it], and it shall be blessed for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;And after this it came to pass that David smote the  Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out  of the hand of the Philistines.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;And he smote the Moabites; and the Moabites became David's  servants, [and] brought gifts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah, at Hamath, as he  went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven  thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David  houghed all the chariot [horses], but reserved of them [for] a  hundred chariots.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;And the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of  Zobah, and David smote of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;And David put [garrisons] in Syria of Damascus; and the  Syrians became servants to David, [and] brought gifts. And  Jehovah preserved David whithersoever he went.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;And David took the shields of gold that were on the  servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;And from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David  took very much brass, of which Solomon made the brazen sea, and  the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;And Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the  forces of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;and he sent Hadoram his son to king David to inquire of  his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought  against Hadarezer and smitten him; for Hadarezer was  continually at war with Tou; [he sent] also all manner of  vessels of gold and silver and bronze.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;Them also king David dedicated to Jehovah, with the silver  and the gold that he had brought from all the nations: from the  Edomites, and from the Moabites, and from the children of  Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from the Amalekites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;And Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in  the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;And he put garrisons in Edom; and all they of Edom became  servants to David. And Jehovah preserved David whithersoever he  went.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;And David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment  and justice to all his people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and  Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was chronicler;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of  Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites  and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were the first at the  king's hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after this that Nahash king of the  children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;And David said, I will shew kindness to Hanun the son of  Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David  sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And  David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to  Hanun, to comfort him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Is  it, in thine eyes, to honour thy father that David has sent  comforters to thee? Is it not to search and overthrow, and to  spy out the land that his servants are come to thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;And Hanun took David's servants, and had them shaved, and  their raiment cut off in the midst, as far as the hip, and sent  them away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;And [certain] went and told David concerning the men; and  he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the  king said, Abide at Jericho until your beards be grown, and  then return.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;And the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves  odious to David; and Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a  thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen  out of Mesopotamia, and from the Syrians of Maacah, and from  Zobah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;And they hired thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king  of Maacah and his people; and they came and encamped before  Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered together from their  cities, and came to battle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;And David heard [of it], and he sent Joab, and all the  host, the mighty men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in  array at the entrance of the city; and the kings that had come  were by themselves on the field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him  before and behind; and he chose out of all the choice men of  Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;and the rest of the people he gave into the hand of  Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against  the children of Ammon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then  thou shalt help me; and if the children of Ammon be too strong  for thee, then I will help thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;Be strong, and let us shew ourselves valiant for our  people, and for the cities of our God; and Jehovah will do what  is good in his sight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;And Joab and the people that were with him drew near in  front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled,  they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into  the city. And Joab came to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;And when the Syrians saw that they were routed before  Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that  were beyond the river; and Shophach the captain of the host of  Hadarezer [went] before them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and  passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set [the  battle] in array against them. And David put the battle in  array against the Syrians, and they fought with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;And the Syrians fled from before Israel; and David slew of  the Syrians seven thousand [in] chariots, and forty thousand  footmen, and slew Shophach the captain of the host.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;And the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were routed  before Israel, and they made peace with David, and became his  servants. And the Syrians would no more help the children of  Ammon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the time of the return of the year,  at the time when kings go forth, that Joab led forth the power  of the army, and laid waste the land of the children of Ammon,  and came and besieged Rabbah. But David abode at Jerusalem. And  Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;And David took the crown of their king from off his head,  and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious  stones in it; and it was [set] upon David's head: and he  brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them  with the saw, and with harrows of iron, and with saws. And so  David did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David  and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at  Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbechai the Hushathite smote  Sippai, one of the children of Rapha; and they were subdued.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;And there was again a battle with the Philistines; and  Elhanan the son of Jair smote Lahmi the brother of Goliath the  Gittite; now the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;And there was again a battle, at Gath; and there was a man  [there] of great stature, whose fingers [and toes] were four  and twenty, six [on each hand], and six [on each foot]; and he  also was born to Rapha.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;And he defied Israel; but Jonathan the son of Shimea  David's brother smote him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;These were born to Rapha in Gath; and they fell by the hand  of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to  number Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people,  Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the  number of them to me, that I may know it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;And Joab said, Jehovah add to his people, how many soever  they be, a hundredfold: are they not all, my lord O king, my  lord's servants? why does my lord require this thing? why  should he become a trespass to Israel?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;But the king's word prevailed against Joab; and Joab  departed, and went through all Israel, and came [again] to  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David.  And all they of Israel were eleven hundred thousand men that  drew sword; and of Judah, four hundred and seventy thousand men  that drew sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;But Levi and Benjamin he did not count among them; for the  king's word was abominable to Joab.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;And God was displeased on account of this thing, and he  smote Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I  have done this thing; and now, I beseech thee, put away the  iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;Go and speak to David saying, Thus saith Jehovah: I offer  thee three [things]; choose one of them, that I may do it unto  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;And Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith  Jehovah:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;Choose thee, either three years of famine, or three months  to be destroyed before thine adversaries while that the sword  of thine enemies overtaketh thee, or three days the sword of  Jehovah and the pestilence in the land, and the angel of  Jehovah destroying through all the borders of Israel. And now  consider what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me  fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Jehovah, for his mercies  are very great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell  of Israel seventy thousand men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; and as  he was destroying, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the  evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough;  withdraw now thine hand. And the angel of Jehovah stood by the  threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah  stand between the earth and the heavens, and his sword drawn in  his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. And David and the  elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;And David said to God, Is it not I that commanded the  people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned and done evil;  but these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray  thee, Jehovah my God, be on me and on my father's house; but  not on thy people, that they should be smitten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;And the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David,  that David should go up and rear an altar to Jehovah in the  threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he had  spoken in the name of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;And Ornan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons  with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;And David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David,  and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David  with [his] face to the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;And David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of the  threshing-floor, that I may build an altar in it to Jehovah:  grant it to me for the full money, that the plague may be  stayed from the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;And Ornan said to David, Take it to thee, and let my lord  the king do that which is good in his sight: see, I give the  oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-sledges for  wood, and the wheat for the oblation; I give it all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will in any case  buy [them] for the full money; for I will not take that which  is thine for Jehovah, to offer up a burnt-offering without  cost.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;And David gave to Ornan for the place in shekels of gold  the weight of six hundred [shekels].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:26">21:26</A>&nbsp;And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered up  burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah;  and he answered him from the heavens by fire upon the altar of  burnt-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:27">21:27</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spoke to the angel; and he put up his sword  again into its sheath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:28">21:28</A>&nbsp;At that time when David saw that Jehovah had answered him  in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he  sacrificed there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:29">21:29</A>&nbsp;And the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses had made in the  wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time  in the high place at Gibeon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:30">21:30</A>&nbsp;But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he  was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;And David said, This is the house of Jehovah Elohim, and  this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;And David commanded to collect the strangers that were in  the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to  build the house of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the  doors of the gates, and for the joists, and brass in abundance  without weight;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;and cedar-trees innumerable; for the Zidonians and they of  Tyre brought cedar-wood in abundance to David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;For David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the  house that is to be built for Jehovah must be exceeding great  in fame and in beauty in all lands: I will therefore make  preparation for it. And David prepared abundantly before his  death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;And he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build  a house for Jehovah the God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;And David said to Solomon, As for me, my son, I was minded  to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;But the word of Jehovah came to me saying, Thou hast shed  blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not  build a house unto my name, for thou hast shed much blood upon  the earth in my sight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of  rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round  about; for his name shall be Solomon, and in his days I will  give peace and quietness unto Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;He shall build a house unto my name; and he shall be my  son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne  of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee, that thou mayest  prosper, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he has said  of thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;Only, Jehovah give thee wisdom and understanding, and  place thee over Israel, and to keep the law of Jehovah thy God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to perform  the statutes and ordinances which Jehovah commanded Moses for  Israel: be strong and courageous; fear not, neither be  dismayed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;And behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house  of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand  thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without  weight, for it is in abundance; and timber and stone have I  prepared; and thou shalt add to it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;And there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and  workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skilful men for  every kind of work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron,  there is no number. Arise and be doing and Jehovah be with  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;And David commanded all the princes of Israel to help  Solomon his son, [saying,]</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;Is not Jehovah your God with you? and has he [not] given  you rest on every side? for he has given the inhabitants of the  land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and  before his people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;Now set your heart and your soul to seek Jehovah your God;  and arise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah Elohim, to bring  the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the vessels of the  sanctuary of God into the house that is to be built unto the  name of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;And David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his  son king over Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with  the priests and the Levites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and  upward; and their number, by their polls, man by man, was  thirty-eight thousand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;Of these, twenty-four thousand were to preside over the  work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers  and judges;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand  praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, [said  David,] to praise [therewith].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;And David divided them into courses according to the sons  of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;Of the Gershonites: Laadan and Shimei.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;And Jahath was the head, and Ziza the second; and Jeush  and Beriah had not many sons: as father's house, therefore,  they were reckoned as one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;The sons of Kohath: Amram, Jizhar, Hebron, and Uzziel,  four.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was  separated, that he should be hallowed as most holy, he and his  sons for ever, to offer before Jehovah, to do service to him,  and to bless in his name for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;-- And as to Moses the man of God, his sons were named of  the tribe of Levi.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:24">23:24</A>&nbsp;These were the sons of Levi according to their fathers'  houses, the chief fathers, as they were reckoned, by number of  names by their polls, who did the work of the service of the  house of Jehovah, from twenty years old and upward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;For David said, Jehovah the God of Israel has given rest  to his people, and he will dwell in Jerusalem for ever;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_29:15">29:15</A>&nbsp;For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all  our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there  is no hope [of life].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:16">29:16</A>&nbsp;Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to  build thee a house to thy holy name, is of thy hand, and is all  thine own.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:17">29:17</A>&nbsp;And I know, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast  pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart have I  willingly offered all these things; and now have I seen with  joy thy people, which are present here, offer willingly to  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:18">29:18</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our  fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts  of the heart of thy people, and direct their hearts to thee!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:19">29:19</A>&nbsp;And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy  commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all,  and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:20">29:20</A>&nbsp;And David said to all the congregation, Bless now Jehovah  your God. And all the congregation blessed Jehovah the God of  their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and did homage to  Jehovah and the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:21">29:21</A>&nbsp;And they sacrificed sacrifices to Jehovah, and offered up  burnt-offerings to Jehovah, on the morrow after that day: a  thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with  their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all  Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:22">29:22</A>&nbsp;And they ate and drank before Jehovah on that day with  great joy. And they made Solomon the son of David king the  second time, and anointed him to Jehovah to be prince, and  Zadok to be priest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:23">29:23</A>&nbsp;And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead  of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:24">29:24</A>&nbsp;And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons  likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the  king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:25">29:25</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of  all Israel, and bestowed upon him royal majesty such as had not  been on any king before him in Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:26">29:26</A>&nbsp;Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:27">29:27</A>&nbsp;And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years:  he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three  years in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:28">29:28</A>&nbsp;And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and  honour; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:29">29:29</A>&nbsp;And the acts of David the king, first and last, behold,  they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the  book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:30">29:30</A>&nbsp;with all his reign and his might, and the times that  passed over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of  the countries.</p>
