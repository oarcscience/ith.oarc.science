<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and  this man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and  abstained from evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And his substance was seven thousand sheep, and three  thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five  hundred she-asses, and very many servants; and this man was  greater than all the children of the east.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And his sons went and made a feast in the house of each one  on his day; and they sent and invited their three sisters to  eat and to drink with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And it was so, when the days of the feasting were gone  about, that Job sent and hallowed them; and he rose up early in  the morning, and offered up burnt-offerings [according to] the  number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my children  have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job  continually.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And there was a day when the sons of God came to present  themselves before Jehovah; and Satan came also among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan  answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth,  and from walking up and down in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant  Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an  upright man, one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Doth Job fear God for  nought?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house,  and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the  work of his hands, and his substance is spread abroad in the  land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath, [and  see] if he will not curse thee to thy face!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in  thy hand; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan  went forth from the presence of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were  eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the  firstborn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were  ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;and [they of] Sheba fell [upon them] and took them, and the  servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I  only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The  fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the  servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped, alone, to  tell thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The  Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels and took  them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the  sword; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, Thy  sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the  house of their brother, the firstborn;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;and behold, there came a great wind from over the  wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it  fell upon the young men, and they died; and I only am escaped,  alone, to tell thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;And Job rose up, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head,  and fell down on the ground, and worshipped;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;and he said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and  naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath  taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;In all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed anything unseemly  to God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And there was a day when the sons of God came to present  themselves before Jehovah, and Satan also came among them to  present himself before Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Satan, From whence comest thou? And  Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the  earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant  Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an  upright man, one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil? and  still he remaineth firm in his integrity, though thou movedst  me against him, to swallow him up without cause.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin, yea, all  that a man hath will he give for his life;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;but put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his  flesh, [and see] if he will not curse thee to thy face!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only  spare his life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;And Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah; and he  smote Job with a grievous botch from the sole of his foot unto  his crown.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And he took a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat  among the ashes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And his wife said to him, Dost thou still remain firm in  thine integrity? curse God and die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;But he said to her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish  women speaketh. We have also received good from God, and should  we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And three friends of Job heard of all this evil that was  come upon him. And they came each one from his place: Eliphaz  the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the  Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to  condole with him and to comfort him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him  not, they lifted up their voice and wept. And they rent every  one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward the  heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And they sat down with him on the ground seven days and  seven nights; and none spoke a word to him; for they saw that  [his] anguish was very great.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And Job answered and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night that  said, There is a man child conceived.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;That day -- let it be darkness, let not +God care for it  from above, neither let light shine upon it:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it; let clouds  dwell upon it; let darkeners of the day terrify it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;That night -- let gloom seize upon it; let it not rejoice  among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of  the months.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful sound come  therein;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse  Leviathan;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it wait for  light, and have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the  dawn:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me,  and hid not trouble from mine eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Wherefore did I not die from the womb, -- come forth from  the belly and expire?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;Why did the knees meet me? and wherefore the breasts, that  I should suck?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should  have slept: then had I been at rest,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;With kings and counsellors of the earth, who build desolate  places for themselves,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with  silver;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants  that have not seen the light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the  wearied are at rest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;The prisoners together are at ease; they hear not the voice  of the taskmaster.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;The small and great are there, and the bondman freed from  his master.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;Wherefore is light given to him that is in trouble, and  life to those bitter of soul,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;Who long for death, and it [cometh] not, and dig for it  more than for hidden treasures;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;Who rejoice even exultingly and are glad when they find the  grave? --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;To the man whose way is hidden, and whom +God hath hedged  in?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;For my sighing cometh before my bread, and my groanings are  poured out like the waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;For I feared a fear, and it hath come upon me, and that  which I dreaded hath come to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;I was not in safety, neither had I quietness, neither was I  at rest, and trouble came.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;If a word were essayed to thee, wouldest thou be grieved?  But who can refrain from speaking?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast  strengthened the weak hands;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Thy words have upholden him that was stumbling, and thou  hast braced up the bending knees:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;But now it is come upon thee, and thou grievest; it toucheth  thee, and thou art troubled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Hath not thy piety been thy confidence, and the perfection  of thy ways thy hope?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;Remember, I pray thee, who that was innocent has perished?  and where were the upright cut off?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Even as I have seen, they that plough iniquity and sow  mischief, reap the same.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;By the breath of +God they perish, and by the blast of his  nostrils are they consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;The roar of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and  the teeth of the young lions, are broken;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of  the lioness are scattered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Now to me a word was secretly brought, and mine ear  received a whisper thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;In thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep  falleth on men: --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Fear came on me, and trembling, and made all my bones to  shake;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;And a spirit passed before my face -- the hair of my flesh  stood up --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;It stood still; I could not discern the appearance thereof:  a form was before mine eyes; I heard a slight murmur and a  voice:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;Shall [mortal] man be more just than +God? Shall a man be  purer than his Maker?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;Lo, he trusteth not his servants, and his angels he  chargeth with folly:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose  foundation is in the dust, who are crushed as the moth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;From morning to evening are they smitten: without any  heeding it, they perish for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Is not their tent-cord torn away in them? they die, and  without wisdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Call, I pray thee! Is there any that answereth thee? and to  which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;For vexation killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the  simple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;I myself saw the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed  his habitation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in  the gate, and there is no deliverer:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh even out of  the thorns; and the snare gapeth for his substance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;For evil cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth  trouble spring out of the ground;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;For man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upwards.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;But as for me I will seek unto &#249;God, and unto God commit my  cause;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Who doeth great things and unsearchable, marvellous things  without number;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Who giveth rain on the face of the earth, and sendeth  waters on the face of the fields;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Setting up on high those that are low; and mourners are  exalted to prosperity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, and their hands  carry not out the enterprise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel  of the wily is carried headlong:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;They meet with darkness in a the daytime, and grope at  midday as in the night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;And he saveth the needy from the sword, from their mouth,  and from the hand of the mighty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;So the poor hath what he hopeth for, and unrighteousness  stoppeth her mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Behold, happy is the man whom +God correcteth; therefore  despise not the chastening of the Almighty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; he woundeth, and his  hands make whole.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;He will deliver thee in six troubles, and in seven there  shall no evil touch thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;In famine he will redeem thee from death, and in war from  the power of the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt be hidden from the scourge of the tongue; and  thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh, and of the  beasts of the earth thou shalt not be afraid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field,  and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; and thou  wilt survey thy fold, and miss nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt know that thy seed is numerous, and thine  offspring as the herb of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt come to the grave in a ripe age, as a shock of  corn is brought in in its season.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;Behold this, we have searched it out, so it is; hear it,  and know thou it for thyself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;And Job answered and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and all my  calamity laid in the balances!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas;  therefore my words are vehement.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, their poison  drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of +God are arrayed against  me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Doth the wild ass bray by the grass? loweth an ox over his  fodder?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Shall that which is insipid be eaten without salt? Is there  any taste in the white of an egg?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;What my soul refuseth to touch, that is as my loathsome  food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Oh that I might have my request, and that +God would grant  my desire!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And that it would please +God to crush me, that he would let  loose his hand and cut me off!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Then should I yet have comfort; and in the pain which  spareth not I would rejoice that I have not denied the words of  the Holy One.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine  end, that I should have patience?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;Is my strength the strength of stones? is my flesh of  brass?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Is it not that there is no help in me, and soundness is  driven away from me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;For him that is fainting kindness [is meet] from his  friend; or he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a stream, as the  channel of streams which pass away,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;Which are turbid by reason of the ice, in which the snow  hideth itself:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;At the time they diminish, they are dried up; when heat  affecteth them, they vanish from their place:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;They wind about in the paths of their course, they go off  into the waste and perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba counted  on them:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;They are ashamed at their hope; they come thither, and are  confounded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;So now ye are nothing; ye see a terrible object and are  afraid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;Did I say, Bring unto me, and make me a present from your  substance?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;Or, rescue me from the hand of the oppressor, and redeem me  from the hand of the violent?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;Teach me, and I will hold my tongue; and cause me to  understand wherein I have erred.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;How forcible are right words! but what doth your upbraiding  reprove?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;Do ye imagine to reprove words? The speeches of one that is  desperate are indeed for the wind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and dig [a pit] for your  friend.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;Now therefore if ye will, look upon me; and it shall be to  your face if I lie.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;Return, I pray you, let there be no wrong; yea, return  again, my righteousness shall be in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:30">6:30</A>&nbsp;Is there wrong in my tongue? cannot my taste discern  mischievous things?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;Hath not man a life of labour upon earth? and are not his  days like the days of a hireling?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;As a bondman earnestly desireth the shadow, and a hireling  expecteth his wages,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome  nights are appointed to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;If I lie down, I say, When shall I rise up, and the darkness  be gone? and I am full of tossings until the dawn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is  broken, and suppurates.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent  without hope.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;Remember thou that my life is wind; mine eye shall no more  see good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;The eye of him that hath seen me shall behold me no [more]:  thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;The cloud consumeth and vanisheth away; so he that goeth  down to Sheol shall not come up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his  place know him again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore I will not restrain my mouth: I will speak in the  anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my  soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that thou settest a watch  over me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my  complaint;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through  visions;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;So that my soul chooseth strangling, death, rather than my  bones.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities without  end?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;For thou hast taken a pledge of thy brother for nought, and  stripped off the clothing of the naked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;Thou hast not given water to the fainting to drink, and  thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;But the powerful man, he had the land; and the man of high  rank dwelt in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;Widows hast thou sent empty away, and the arms of the  fatherless have been broken.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;I would order the cause before him, and fill my mouth with  arguments;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;I would know the words he would answer me, and understand  what he would say unto me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;Would he plead against me with [his] great power? Nay; but  he would give heed unto me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;There would an upright man reason with him; and I should be  delivered for ever from my judge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;Lo, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I  do not perceive him;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;My foot hath held to his steps; his way have I kept, and  not turned aside.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips;  I have laid up the words of his mouth more than the purpose of  my own heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;But he is in one [mind], and who can turn him? And what  his soul desireth, that will he do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;For he will perform [what] is appointed for me; and many  such things are with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;Therefore am I troubled at his presence; I consider, and I  am afraid of him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;For &#249;God hath made my heart soft, and the Almighty  troubleth me;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_29:6">29:6</A>&nbsp;When my steps were bathed in milk, and the rock poured out  beside me rivers of oil! ...</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:7">29:7</A>&nbsp;When I went out to the gate by the city, when I prepared my  seat on the broadway,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:8">29:8</A>&nbsp;The young men saw me, and hid themselves; and the aged  arose [and] stood up;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:9">29:9</A>&nbsp;Princes refrained from talking, and laid the hand on their  mouth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:10">29:10</A>&nbsp;The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue  cleaved to their palate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:11">29:11</A>&nbsp;When the ear heard [me], then it blessed me, and when the  eye saw [me], it gave witness to me;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_29:13">29:13</A>&nbsp;The blessing of him that was perishing came upon me, and I  caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:14">29:14</A>&nbsp;I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was  as a mantle and a turban.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:15">29:15</A>&nbsp;I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:16">29:16</A>&nbsp;I was a father to the needy, and the cause which I knew  not I searched out;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:17">29:17</A>&nbsp;And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the  spoil out of his teeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:18">29:18</A>&nbsp;And I said, I shall die in my nest, and multiply my days  as the sand;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_29:21">29:21</A>&nbsp;Unto me they listened, and waited, and kept silence for my  counsel:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:22">29:22</A>&nbsp;After my words they spoke not again, and my speech dropped  upon them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:23">29:23</A>&nbsp;And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened  their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:24">29:24</A>&nbsp;[If] I laughed on them, they believed [it] not; and they  troubled not the serenity of my countenance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:25">29:25</A>&nbsp;I chose their way, and sat as chief, and dwelt as a king  in the army, as one that comforteth mourners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:1">30:1</A>&nbsp;But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,  whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my  flock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:2">30:2</A>&nbsp;Yea, whereto [should] the strength of their hands [profit]  me, [men] in whom vigour hath perished?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:3">30:3</A>&nbsp;Withered up through want and hunger, they flee into waste  places long since desolate and desert:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:4">30:4</A>&nbsp;They gather the salt-wort among the bushes, and the roots  of the broom for their food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:5">30:5</A>&nbsp;They are driven forth from among [men] -- they cry after  them as after a thief --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:6">30:6</A>&nbsp;To dwell in gloomy gorges, in caves of the earth and the  rocks:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:7">30:7</A>&nbsp;They bray among the bushes; under the brambles they are  gathered together:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:8">30:8</A>&nbsp;Sons of fools, and sons of nameless sires, they are driven  out of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:9">30:9</A>&nbsp;And now I am their song, yea, I am their byword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:10">30:10</A>&nbsp;They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, yea, they spare  not to spit in my face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:11">30:11</A>&nbsp;For he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me; so they cast  off the bridle before me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:12">30:12</A>&nbsp;At [my] right hand rise the young brood; they push away my  feet, and raise up against me their pernicious ways;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:13">30:13</A>&nbsp;They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, without  any to help them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:14">30:14</A>&nbsp;They come in as through a wide breach: amid the confusion  they roll themselves onward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:15">30:15</A>&nbsp;Terrors are turned against me; they pursue mine honour as  the wind; and my welfare is passed away like a cloud.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:16">30:16</A>&nbsp;And now my soul is poured out in me; days of affliction  have taken hold upon me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:17">30:17</A>&nbsp;The night pierceth through my bones [and detacheth them]  from me, and my gnawing pains take no rest:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:18">30:18</A>&nbsp;By their great force they have become my raiment; they  bind me about as the collar of my coat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:19">30:19</A>&nbsp;He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust  and ashes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:20">30:20</A>&nbsp;I cry unto thee, and thou answerest me not; I stand up,  and thou lookest at me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:21">30:21</A>&nbsp;Thou art changed to a cruel one to me; with the strength  of thy hand thou pursuest me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:22">30:22</A>&nbsp;Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to be  borne away, and dissolvest my substance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:23">30:23</A>&nbsp;For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and into the  house of assemblage for all living.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:24">30:24</A>&nbsp;Indeed, no prayer [availeth] when he stretcheth out [his]  hand: though they cry when he destroyeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:25">30:25</A>&nbsp;Did not I weep for him whose days were hard? was not my  soul grieved for the needy?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:26">30:26</A>&nbsp;For I expected good, and there came evil; and I waited for  light, but there came darkness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:27">30:27</A>&nbsp;My bowels well up, and rest not; days of affliction have  confronted me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:28">30:28</A>&nbsp;I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up, I  cry in the congregation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:29">30:29</A>&nbsp;I am become a brother to jackals, and a companion of  ostriches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:30">30:30</A>&nbsp;My skin is become black [and falleth] off me, and my bones  are parched with heat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:31">30:31</A>&nbsp;My harp also is [turned] to mourning, and my pipe into the  voice of weepers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;I made a covenant with mine eyes; and how should I fix my  regard upon a maid?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;For what would have been [my] portion of +God from above,  and what the heritage of the Almighty from on high?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;Is not calamity for the unrighteous? and misfortune for the  workers of iniquity?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;Doth not he see my ways, and number all my steps?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot hath hasted to  deceit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;(Let me be weighed in an even balance, and +God will take  knowledge of my blamelessness;)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;If my step have turned out of the way, and my heart  followed mine eyes, and if any blot cleaveth to my hands;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;Let me sow, and another eat; and let mine offspring be  rooted out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;If my heart have been enticed unto a woman, so that I laid  wait at my neighbour's door,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:10">31:10</A>&nbsp;Let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down  upon her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:11">31:11</A>&nbsp;For this is an infamy; yea, it is an iniquity [to be  judged by] the judges:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:12">31:12</A>&nbsp;For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would  root out all mine increase.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:13">31:13</A>&nbsp;If I have despised the cause of my bondman or of my  bondmaid, when they contended with me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:14">31:14</A>&nbsp;What then should I do when &#249;God riseth up? and if he  visited, what should I answer him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:15">31:15</A>&nbsp;Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not  One fashion us in the womb?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:16">31:16</A>&nbsp;If I have withheld the poor from [their] desire, or caused  the eyes of the widow to fail;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:17">31:17</A>&nbsp;Or have eaten my morsel alone, so that the fatherless ate  not thereof,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:18">31:18</A>&nbsp;(For from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,  and I have guided the [widow] from my mother's womb;)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:19">31:19</A>&nbsp;If I have seen any perishing for want of clothing, or any  needy without covering;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:20">31:20</A>&nbsp;If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not  warmed with the fleece of my lambs;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:21">31:21</A>&nbsp;If I have lifted up my hand against an orphan, because I  saw my help in the gate:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:22">31:22</A>&nbsp;[Then] let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, and  mine arm be broken from the bone!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:23">31:23</A>&nbsp;For calamity from &#249;God was a terror to me, and by reason  of his excellency I was powerless.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:24">31:24</A>&nbsp;If I have made gold my hope, or said to the fine gold, My  confidence!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:25">31:25</A>&nbsp;If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my  hand had gotten much;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:26">31:26</A>&nbsp;If I beheld the sun when it shone, or the moon walking in  brightness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:27">31:27</A>&nbsp;And my heart have been secretly enticed, so that my mouth  kissed my hand:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:28">31:28</A>&nbsp;This also would be an iniquity for the judge, for I should  have denied the &#249;God who is above.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:29">31:29</A>&nbsp;If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, and  exulted when evil befell him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:30">31:30</A>&nbsp;(Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by asking his  life with a curse;)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:31">31:31</A>&nbsp;If the men of my tent said not, Who shall find one that  hath not been satisfied with his meat? --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:32">31:32</A>&nbsp;The stranger did not lodge without; I opened my doors to  the pathway.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:33">31:33</A>&nbsp;If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine  iniquity in my bosom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:34">31:34</A>&nbsp;Because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of  families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and went not out  of the door, ...</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:35">31:35</A>&nbsp;Oh that I had one to hear me! Behold my signature: let the  Almighty answer me! And let mine opponent write an accusation!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:36">31:36</A>&nbsp;Would I not take it upon my shoulder? I would bind it on  to me [as] a crown;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:37">31:37</A>&nbsp;I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a  prince would I come near to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:38">31:38</A>&nbsp;If my land cry out against me, and its furrows weep  together;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:39">31:39</A>&nbsp;If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have  tormented to death the souls of its owners:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:40">31:40</A>&nbsp;Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and tares instead of  barley. The words of Job are ended.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;And these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was  righteous in his own eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A>&nbsp;Then was kindled the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel,  the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his anger  kindled, because he justified himself rather than God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A>&nbsp;and against his three friends was his anger kindled,  because they found no answer, and [yet] condemned Job.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;But Elihu had waited till Job had finished speaking,  because they were older than he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the  three men, and his anger was kindled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,  I am young, and ye are aged; wherefore I was timid, and feared  to shew you what I know.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:7">32:7</A>&nbsp;I said, Let days speak, and multitude of years teach  wisdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:8">32:8</A>&nbsp;But there is a spirit which is in man; and the breath of  the Almighty giveth them understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;It is not the great that are wise; neither do the aged  understand judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:10">32:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore I say, Hearken to me; I also will shew what I  know.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:11">32:11</A>&nbsp;Lo, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your  reasonings, until ye searched out what to say.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:12">32:12</A>&nbsp;Yea, I gave you mine attention, and behold, there was none  of you that confuted Job, that answered his words;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:13">32:13</A>&nbsp;That ye may not say, We have found out wisdom; &#249;God will  make him yield, not man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:14">32:14</A>&nbsp;Now he hath not directed [his] words against me; and I  will not answer him with your speeches. ...</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:15">32:15</A>&nbsp;They were amazed, they answered no more; words failed  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:16">32:16</A>&nbsp;And I waited, for they spoke not, but stood still, and  answered no more; --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:17">32:17</A>&nbsp;I will answer, I also in my turn, I also will shew what I  know:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:18">32:18</A>&nbsp;For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth  me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:19">32:19</A>&nbsp;Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new  flasks, it is ready to burst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:20">32:20</A>&nbsp;I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips  and answer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:21">32:21</A>&nbsp;Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person; neither  will I give flattery to man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:22">32:22</A>&nbsp;For I know not how to flatter; my Maker would soon take me  away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:1">33:1</A>&nbsp;Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear mine utterances, and  hearken to all my words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:2">33:2</A>&nbsp;Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue speaketh in  my palate,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:3">33:3</A>&nbsp;My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart, and my  lips shall utter knowledge purely.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:4">33:4</A>&nbsp;The Spirit of &#249;God hath made me, and the breath of the  Almighty hath given me life.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:8">33:8</A>&nbsp;Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the  voice of [thy] words: --</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:12">33:12</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will answer thee in this, thou art not right;  for +God is greater than man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:13">33:13</A>&nbsp;Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not  account of any of his matters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:14">33:14</A>&nbsp;For &#249;God speaketh once, and twice, -- [and man] perceiveth  it not --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:15">33:15</A>&nbsp;In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep  falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:17">33:17</A>&nbsp;That he may withdraw man [from his] work, and hide pride  from man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:18">33:18</A>&nbsp;He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from  passing away by the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:19">33:19</A>&nbsp;He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and with  constant strife in his bones;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:20">33:20</A>&nbsp;And his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:21">33:21</A>&nbsp;His flesh is consumed away from view, and his bones that  were not seen stick out;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:22">33:22</A>&nbsp;And his soul draweth near to the pit, and his life to the  destroyers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:23">33:23</A>&nbsp;If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one  among a thousand, to shew unto man his duty;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:27">33:27</A>&nbsp;He will sing before men, and say, I have sinned, and  perverted what was right, and it hath not been requited to me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:28">33:28</A>&nbsp;He hath delivered my soul from going into the pit, and my  life shall see the light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:29">33:29</A>&nbsp;Lo, all these [things] worketh &#249;God twice, thrice, with  man,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:30">33:30</A>&nbsp;To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be  enlightened with the light of the living.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:31">33:31</A>&nbsp;Mark well, Job, hearken unto me; be silent, and I will  speak.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:1">34:1</A>&nbsp;Moreover Elihu answered and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:2">34:2</A>&nbsp;Hear my words, ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that  have knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:3">34:3</A>&nbsp;For the ear trieth words, as the palate tasteth food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:4">34:4</A>&nbsp;Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us know  among ourselves what is good!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:5">34:5</A>&nbsp;For Job hath said, I am righteous, and &#249;God hath taken away  my judgment:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:6">34:6</A>&nbsp;Should I lie against my right? My wound is incurable  without transgression.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:7">34:7</A>&nbsp;What man is like Job? he drinketh up scorning like water,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:8">34:8</A>&nbsp;And goeth in company with workers of iniquity, and walketh  with wicked men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:9">34:9</A>&nbsp;For he hath said, It profiteth not a man if he delight  himself in God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:10">34:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be  wickedness from &#249;God, and wrong from the Almighty!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A>&nbsp;For a man's work will he render to him, and cause every  one to find according to [his] way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A>&nbsp;Yea, surely, &#249;God acteth not wickedly, and the Almighty  perverteth not judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:13">34:13</A>&nbsp;Who hath entrusted to him the earth? and who hath disposed  the whole world?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:14">34:14</A>&nbsp;If he only thought of himself, [and] gathered unto him his  spirit and his breath,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:15">34:15</A>&nbsp;All flesh would expire together, and man would return to  the dust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:16">34:16</A>&nbsp;If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: give ear to  the voice of my words!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:17">34:17</A>&nbsp;Should he that hateth right indeed govern? and wilt thou  condemn the All-just?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:18">34:18</A>&nbsp;Shall one say to a king, Belial? to nobles, Wicked?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:19">34:19</A>&nbsp;[How then to him] that accepteth not the persons of  princes, nor regardeth the rich man more than the poor? for  they are all the work of his hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:20">34:20</A>&nbsp;In a moment they die, even at midnight the people are  convulsed and pass away; and the strong are taken away without  hand.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:22">34:22</A>&nbsp;There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the  workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:23">34:23</A>&nbsp;For he doth not long consider a man, to bring him before  &#249;God in judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:24">34:24</A>&nbsp;He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquiry, and  setteth others in their stead;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:25">34:25</A>&nbsp;Since he knoweth their actions; and he overthroweth [them]  in the night, and they are crushed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:26">34:26</A>&nbsp;He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of  others,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:27">34:27</A>&nbsp;Because they have turned back from him, and would consider  none of his ways;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:28">34:28</A>&nbsp;So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him,  and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:29">34:29</A>&nbsp;When he giveth quietness, who then will disturb? and when  he hideth [his] face, who shall behold him? and this towards a  nation, or towards a man alike;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:30">34:30</A>&nbsp;That the ungodly man reign not, that the people be not  ensnared.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:31">34:31</A>&nbsp;For hath he said unto &#249;God, I bear [chastisement], I will  not offend;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:32">34:32</A>&nbsp;What I see not, teach thou me; if I have done wrong, I  will do so no more?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:33">34:33</A>&nbsp;Shall he recompense according to thy mind? for thou hast  refused [his judgment]; for thou so choosest, and not I; speak  then what thou knowest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:34">34:34</A>&nbsp;Men of understanding will say to me, and a wise man who  heareth me:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:35">34:35</A>&nbsp;Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were not  with intelligence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:36">34:36</A>&nbsp;Would that Job may be tried unto the end, because of [his]  answers after the manner of evil men!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:37">34:37</A>&nbsp;For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his  hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against &#249;God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:1">35:1</A>&nbsp;Moreover Elihu answered and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:2">35:2</A>&nbsp;Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My  righteousness is more than &#249;God's?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:3">35:3</A>&nbsp;For thou hast asked of what profit it is unto thee: what do  I gain more than if I had sinned?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:4">35:4</A>&nbsp;I will reply to thee in words, and to thy companions with  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:5">35:5</A>&nbsp;Look unto the heavens and see; and survey the skies: they  are higher than thou.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:6">35:6</A>&nbsp;If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? If thy  transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:7">35:7</A>&nbsp;If thou be righteous, what givest thou to him? or what doth  he receive of thy hand?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:8">35:8</A>&nbsp;Thy wickedness [may affect] a man as thou [art], and thy  righteousness a son of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:9">35:9</A>&nbsp;By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry; they  cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:10">35:10</A>&nbsp;But none saith, Where is +God my Maker, who giveth songs  in the night,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:11">35:11</A>&nbsp;Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and  maketh us wiser than the fowl of the heavens?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:12">35:12</A>&nbsp;There they cry, and he answereth not, because of the pride  of evil men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:13">35:13</A>&nbsp;Surely &#249;God will not hear vanity, neither will the  Almighty regard it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:14">35:14</A>&nbsp;Although thou sayest thou dost not see him, judgment is  before him, therefore wait for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:15">35:15</A>&nbsp;But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, doth  not [Job] know [his] great arrogancy?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:16">35:16</A>&nbsp;For Job hath opened his mouth in vanity, and made words  abundant without knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:1">36:1</A>&nbsp;And Elihu proceeded and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:2">36:2</A>&nbsp;Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet  words for +God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:3">36:3</A>&nbsp;I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe  righteousness to my Creator.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:4">36:4</A>&nbsp;For truly my words shall be no falsehood: one perfect in  knowledge is with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:5">36:5</A>&nbsp;Lo, &#249;God is mighty, but despiseth not [any]; mighty in  strength of understanding:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:6">36:6</A>&nbsp;He saveth not the wicked alive; but he doeth justice to the  afflicted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:7">36:7</A>&nbsp;He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous, but with  kings on the throne doth he even set them for ever; and they  are exalted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:8">36:8</A>&nbsp;And if, bound in fetters, they be held in cords of  affliction,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:9">36:9</A>&nbsp;Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions,  because they have increased.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:10">36:10</A>&nbsp;And he openeth their ear to discipline, and commandeth  that they return from iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:11">36:11</A>&nbsp;If they hearken and serve [him], they shall accomplish  their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:12">36:12</A>&nbsp;But if they hearken not, they shall pass away by the  sword, and expire without knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:13">36:13</A>&nbsp;But the godless in heart heap up anger; they cry not when  he bindeth them:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:14">36:14</A>&nbsp;Their soul dieth in youth, and their life is among the  unclean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:15">36:15</A>&nbsp;But he delivereth the afflicted in his affliction, and  openeth their ear in [their] oppression.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:16">36:16</A>&nbsp;Even so would he have allured thee out of the jaws of  distress into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and  the supply of thy table [would be] full of fatness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:17">36:17</A>&nbsp;But thou art full of the judgments of the wicked: judgment  and justice take hold [on thee].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:18">36:18</A>&nbsp;Because there is wrath, [beware] lest it take thee away  through chastisement: then a great ransom could not avail thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:19">36:19</A>&nbsp;Will he esteem thy riches? Not gold, nor all the resources  of strength!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:20">36:20</A>&nbsp;Desire not the night, when peoples are cut off from their  place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:21">36:21</A>&nbsp;Take heed, turn not to iniquity; for this hast thou chosen  rather than affliction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:22">36:22</A>&nbsp;Lo, &#249;God is exalted in his power: who teacheth as he?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:23">36:23</A>&nbsp;Who hath appointed him his way? or who hath said, Thou  hast wrought unrighteousness?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:24">36:24</A>&nbsp;Remember that thou magnify his work, which men celebrate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:25">36:25</A>&nbsp;All men look at it; man beholdeth [it] afar off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:26">36:26</A>&nbsp;Lo, &#249;God is great, and we comprehend [him] not, neither  can the number of his years be searched out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:27">36:27</A>&nbsp;For he draweth up the drops of water: they distil in rain  from the vapour which he formeth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:28">36:28</A>&nbsp;Which the skies pour down [and] drop upon man abundantly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:29">36:29</A>&nbsp;But can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, [or]  the crashing of his pavilion?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:30">36:30</A>&nbsp;Lo, he spreadeth his light around him, and covereth the  bottom of the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:31">36:31</A>&nbsp;For with them he judgeth the peoples; he giveth food in  abundance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:32">36:32</A>&nbsp;[His] hands he covereth with lightning, and commandeth it  where it is to strike.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:33">36:33</A>&nbsp;His thundering declareth concerning him; the cattle even,  concerning its coming.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:1">37:1</A>&nbsp;Aye, my heart trembleth at this also, and leapeth up out of  its place:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:2">37:2</A>&nbsp;Hear attentively the roar of his voice, and the murmur  going forth from his mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:3">37:3</A>&nbsp;He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, and his  lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:4">37:4</A>&nbsp;After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of  his excellency, and holdeth not back the flashes when his voice  is heard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:5">37:5</A>&nbsp;&#249;God thundereth marvellously with his voice, doing great  things which we do not comprehend.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:6">37:6</A>&nbsp;For he saith to the snow, Fall on the earth! and to the  pouring rain, even the pouring rains of his might.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:7">37:7</A>&nbsp;He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know  his work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:8">37:8</A>&nbsp;And the wild beast goeth into its lair, and they remain in  their dens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:9">37:9</A>&nbsp;From the chamber [of the south] cometh the whirlwind; and  cold from the winds of the north.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:10">37:10</A>&nbsp;By the breath of &#249;God ice is given; and the breadth of the  waters is straitened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:11">37:11</A>&nbsp;Also with plentiful moisture he loadeth the thick clouds,  his light dispels the cloud;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:12">37:12</A>&nbsp;And they are turned every way by his guidance, that they  may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the  circuit of the earth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:13">37:13</A>&nbsp;Whether he cause it to come as a rod, or for his land, or  in mercy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:14">37:14</A>&nbsp;Hearken unto this, Job; stand still and discern the  wondrous works of &#249;God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:15">37:15</A>&nbsp;Dost thou know how +God hath disposed them, and how he  causeth the lightning of his cloud to flash?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:16">37:16</A>&nbsp;Dost thou know about the balancings of the clouds, the  wondrous works of him that is perfect in knowledge?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:17">37:17</A>&nbsp;How thy garments become warm when he quieteth the earth by  the south wind?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:18">37:18</A>&nbsp;Hast thou with him spread out the sky, firm, like a molten  mirror?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:19">37:19</A>&nbsp;Teach us what we shall say unto him! We cannot order [our  words] by reason of darkness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:20">37:20</A>&nbsp;Shall it be told him if I would speak? if a man [so] say,  surely he shall be swallowed up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:21">37:21</A>&nbsp;And now [men] see not the light as it gleameth, it is  [hidden] in the skies. But the wind passeth by and cleareth  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:22">37:22</A>&nbsp;From the north cometh gold; with +God is terrible majesty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:23">37:23</A>&nbsp;The Almighty, we cannot find him out: excellent in power,  and in judgment, and in abundance of justice, he doth not  afflict.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:24">37:24</A>&nbsp;Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are  wise of heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:1">38:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:2">38:2</A>&nbsp;Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without  knowledge?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:3">38:3</A>&nbsp;Gird up now thy loins like a man; and I will demand of  thee, and inform thou me.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_38:6">38:6</A>&nbsp;Whereupon were the foundations thereof sunken? or who laid  its corner-stone,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_39:5">39:5</A>&nbsp;Who hath sent out the wild ass free? and who hath loosed  the bands of the onager,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:6">39:6</A>&nbsp;Whose house I made the wilderness, and the salt plain his  dwellings?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:7">39:7</A>&nbsp;He laugheth at the tumult of the city, and heareth not the  shouts of the driver;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:8">39:8</A>&nbsp;The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth  after every green thing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:9">39:9</A>&nbsp;Will the buffalo be willing to serve thee, or will he lodge  by thy crib?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:10">39:10</A>&nbsp;Canst thou bind the buffalo with his cord in the furrow?  or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:11">39:11</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou put confidence in him, because his strength is  great? and wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:12">39:12</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou trust him to bring home thy seed, and gather it  into thy threshing-floor?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:13">39:13</A>&nbsp;The wing of the ostrich beats joyously -- But is it the  stork's pinion and plumage?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:14">39:14</A>&nbsp;For she leaveth her eggs to the earth, and warmeth them in  the dust,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:15">39:15</A>&nbsp;And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the  beast of the field may trample them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:16">39:16</A>&nbsp;She is hardened against her young ones, as though they  were not hers; her labour is in vain, without her concern.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:17">39:17</A>&nbsp;For +God hath deprived her of wisdom, and hath not  furnished her with understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:18">39:18</A>&nbsp;What time she lasheth herself on high, she scorneth the  horse and his rider.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:19">39:19</A>&nbsp;Hast thou given strength to the horse? hast thou clothed  his neck with the quivering mane?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:20">39:20</A>&nbsp;Dost thou make him to leap as a locust? His majestic  snorting is terrible.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:21">39:21</A>&nbsp;He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in [his] strength;  he goeth forth to meet the armed host.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:22">39:22</A>&nbsp;He laugheth at fear, and is not affrighted; neither  turneth he back from before the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:23">39:23</A>&nbsp;The quiver rattleth upon him, the glittering spear and the  javelin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:24">39:24</A>&nbsp;He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage, and  cannot contain himself at the sound of the trumpet:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:25">39:25</A>&nbsp;At the noise of the trumpets he saith, Aha! and he  smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and  the shouting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:26">39:26</A>&nbsp;Doth the hawk fly by thine intelligence, [and] stretch his  wings toward the south?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:27">39:27</A>&nbsp;Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make his nest  on high?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:28">39:28</A>&nbsp;He inhabiteth the rock and maketh his dwelling on the  point of the cliff, and the fastness:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:29">39:29</A>&nbsp;From thence he spieth out the prey, his eyes look into the  distance;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:30">39:30</A>&nbsp;And his young ones suck up blood; and where the slain are,  there is he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:1">40:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah answered Job and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:2">40:2</A>&nbsp;Shall he that will contend with the Almighty instruct  [him]? he that reproveth +God, let him answer it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:3">40:3</A>&nbsp;And Job answered Jehovah and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:4">40:4</A>&nbsp;Behold, I am nought: what shall I answer thee? I will lay  my hand upon my mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:5">40:5</A>&nbsp;Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I  will proceed no further.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:6">40:6</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:7">40:7</A>&nbsp;Gird up now thy loins like a man: I will demand of thee,  and inform thou me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:8">40:8</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou also annul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me that  thou mayest be righteous?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:9">40:9</A>&nbsp;Hast thou an arm like &#249;God? or canst thou thunder with a  voice like him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:10">40:10</A>&nbsp;Deck thyself now with glory and excellency, and clothe  thyself with majesty and splendour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:11">40:11</A>&nbsp;Cast abroad the ragings of thine anger, and look on every  one that is proud, and abase him:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:12">40:12</A>&nbsp;Look on every one that is proud, bring him low, and tread  down the wicked in their place:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:13">40:13</A>&nbsp;Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in  secret.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:14">40:14</A>&nbsp;Then will I also praise thee, because thy right hand  saveth thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:15">40:15</A>&nbsp;See now the behemoth, which I made with thee: he eateth  grass as an ox.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:16">40:16</A>&nbsp;Behold now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is  in the muscles of his belly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:17">40:17</A>&nbsp;He bendeth his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs  are woven together.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:18">40:18</A>&nbsp;His bones are tubes of bronze, his members are like bars  of iron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:19">40:19</A>&nbsp;He is the chief of &#249;God's ways: he that made him gave him  his sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:20">40:20</A>&nbsp;For the mountains bring him forth food, where all the  beasts of the field play.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:21">40:21</A>&nbsp;He lieth under lotus-bushes, in the covert of the reed and  fen:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:22">40:22</A>&nbsp;Lotus-bushes cover him with their shade; the willows of  the brook surround him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:23">40:23</A>&nbsp;Lo, the river overfloweth -- he startleth not: he is  confident though a Jordan break forth against his mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:24">40:24</A>&nbsp;Shall he be taken in front? will they pierce through [his]  nose in the trap?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:1">41:1</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou draw out the leviathan with the hook, and press  down his tongue with a cord?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:2">41:2</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou put a rush-rope into his nose, and pierce his jaw  with a spike?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:3">41:3</A>&nbsp;Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak  softly unto thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:4">41:4</A>&nbsp;Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him as a  bondman for ever?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:5">41:5</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou play with him as with a bird, and wilt thou bind  him for thy maidens?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:6">41:6</A>&nbsp;Shall partners make traffic of him, will they divide him  among merchants?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:7">41:7</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou fill his skin with darts, and his head with  fish-spears?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:8">41:8</A>&nbsp;Lay thy hand upon him; remember the battle, -- do no more!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:9">41:9</A>&nbsp;Lo, hope as to him is belied: is not one cast down even at  the sight of him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:10">41:10</A>&nbsp;None is so bold as to stir him up; and who is he that will  stand before me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:11">41:11</A>&nbsp;Who hath first given to me, that I should repay [him]?  [Whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:12">41:12</A>&nbsp;I will not be silent as to his parts, the story of his  power, and the beauty of his structure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:13">41:13</A>&nbsp;Who can uncover the surface of his garment? who can come  within his double jaws?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:14">41:14</A>&nbsp;Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth  is terror.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:15">41:15</A>&nbsp;The rows of his shields are a pride, shut up together [as  with] a close seal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:16">41:16</A>&nbsp;One is so near to another that no air can come between  them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:17">41:17</A>&nbsp;They are joined each to its fellow; they stick together,  and cannot be sundered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:18">41:18</A>&nbsp;His sneezings flash light, and his eyes are like the  eyelids of the morning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:19">41:19</A>&nbsp;Out of his mouth go forth flames; sparks of fire leap out:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:20">41:20</A>&nbsp;Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a boiling pot  and cauldron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:21">41:21</A>&nbsp;His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his  mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:22">41:22</A>&nbsp;In his neck lodgeth strength, and terror danceth before  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:23">41:23</A>&nbsp;The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are  fused upon him, they cannot be moved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:24">41:24</A>&nbsp;His heart is firm as a stone, yea, firm as the nether  [millstone].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:25">41:25</A>&nbsp;When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: they  are beside themselves with consternation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:26">41:26</A>&nbsp;If any reach him with a sword, it cannot hold; neither  spear, nor dart, nor harpoon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:27">41:27</A>&nbsp;He esteemeth iron as straw, bronze as rotten wood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:28">41:28</A>&nbsp;The arrow will not make him flee; slingstones are turned  with him into stubble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:29">41:29</A>&nbsp;Clubs are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking  of a javelin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:30">41:30</A>&nbsp;His under parts are sharp potsherds: he spreadeth a  threshing-sledge upon the mire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:31">41:31</A>&nbsp;He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; he maketh the sea  like a pot of ointment;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:32">41:32</A>&nbsp;He maketh the path to shine after him: one would think the  deep to be hoary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:33">41:33</A>&nbsp;Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without  fear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:34">41:34</A>&nbsp;He beholdeth all high things; he is king over all the  proud beasts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:1">42:1</A>&nbsp;And Job answered Jehovah and said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:2">42:2</A>&nbsp;I know that thou canst do everything, and that thou canst  be hindered in no thought of thine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:3">42:3</A>&nbsp;Who is he that obscureth counsel without knowledge?  therefore have I uttered what I did not understand; things too  wonderful for me, which I knew not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:4">42:4</A>&nbsp;Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of  thee, and inform me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:5">42:5</A>&nbsp;I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine  eye seeth thee:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:6">42:6</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I abhor [myself], and repent in dust and ashes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:7">42:7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after Jehovah had spoken these words to  Job, that Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, Mine anger is  kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have  not spoken rightly of me, like my servant Job.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:8">42:8</A>&nbsp;And now, take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams,  and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a  burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for him  will I accept: lest I deal with you [after your] folly, for ye  have not spoken of me rightly, like my servant Job.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:9">42:9</A>&nbsp;Then Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and  Zophar the Naamathite, went and did according as Jehovah had  said unto them; and Jehovah accepted Job.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:10">42:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he had  prayed for his friends; and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as  he had before.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:11">42:11</A>&nbsp;And all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they  that had been of his acquaintance before, came to him, and they  ate bread with him in his house, and they condoled with him,  and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had  brought upon him; and every one gave him a piece of money, and  every one a golden ring.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:12">42:12</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his  beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand  camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:13">42:13</A>&nbsp;And he had seven sons and three daughters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:14">42:14</A>&nbsp;And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name  of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third,  Keren-happuch.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:15">42:15</A>&nbsp;And in all the land were no women found [so] fair as the  daughters of Job; and their father gave them inheritance among  their brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:16">42:16</A>&nbsp;And Job lived after this a hundred and forty years, and  saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:17">42:17</A>&nbsp;And Job died, old and full of days.</p>
