<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;In [the] beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;*He* was in the beginning with God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;All things received being through him, and without him not  one [thing] received being which has received being.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And the light appears in darkness, and the darkness  apprehended it not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;There was a man sent from God, his name John.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the  light, that all might believe through him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;*He* was not the light, but that he might witness concerning  the light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;The true light was that which, coming into the world,  lightens every man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;He was in the world, and the world had [its] being through  him, and the world knew him not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;He came to his own, and his own received him not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;but as many as received him, to them gave he [the] right to  be children of God, to those that believe on his name;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor  of man's will, but of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have  contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a  father), full of grace and truth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;(John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This  was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred  before me, for he was before me;)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon  grace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists  through Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who  is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared [him].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent from  Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him, Thou,  who art thou?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;And he acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am  not the Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says,  I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give  an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;He said, I [am] [the] voice of one crying in the  wilderness, Make straight the path of [the] Lord, as said  Esaias the prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;And they were sent from among the Pharisees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou  then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the  midst of you stands, whom ye do not know,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not  worthy to unloose.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan,  where John was baptising.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold  the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a  place before me, because he *was* before me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to  Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit  descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with  water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit  descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with [the]  Holy Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:34">1:34</A>&nbsp;And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of  God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:35">1:35</A>&nbsp;Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his  disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:36">1:36</A>&nbsp;And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the  Lamb of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:37">1:37</A>&nbsp;And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed  Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:38">1:38</A>&nbsp;But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to  them, What seek ye? And *they* said to him, Rabbi (which, being  interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:39">1:39</A>&nbsp;He says to them, Come and see. They went therefore, and saw  where he abode; and they abode with him that day. It was about  the tenth hour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:40">1:40</A>&nbsp;Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who  heard [this] from John and followed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:41">1:41</A>&nbsp;He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We  have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ).</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:42">1:42</A>&nbsp;And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking at him said, Thou  art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which  interpreted is stone).</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:43">1:43</A>&nbsp;On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee, and Jesus  finds Philip, and says to him, Follow me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:44">1:44</A>&nbsp;And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and  Peter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:45">1:45</A>&nbsp;Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him  of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the  son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:46">1:46</A>&nbsp;And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of  Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:47">1:47</A>&nbsp;Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold  [one] truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:48">1:48</A>&nbsp;Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus  answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when  thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:49">1:49</A>&nbsp;Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son  of God, thou art the King of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:50">1:50</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I  saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see  greater things than these.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:51">1:51</A>&nbsp;And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you,  Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of  God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of  Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the  marriage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And wine being deficient, the mother of Jesus says to him,  They have no wine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to her, What have I to do with thee, woman? mine  hour has not yet come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;His mother says to the servants, Whatever he may say to you,  do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Now there were standing there six stone water-vessels,  according to the purification of the Jews, holding two or three  measures each.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to them, Fill the water-vessels with water. And  they filled them up to the brim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry [it] to the  feast-master. And they carried [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;But when the feast-master had tasted the water which had  been made wine (and knew not whence it was, but the servants  knew who drew the water), the feast-master calls the  bridegroom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine, and  when [men] have well drunk, then the inferior; thou hast kept  the good wine till now.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and  manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and  his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many  days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And he found in the temple the sellers of oxen and sheep  and doves, and the money-changers sitting;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;and, having made a scourge of cords, he cast [them] all out  of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out  the change of the money-changers, and overturned the tables,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;and said to the sellers of doves, Take these things hence;  make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;[And] his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal  of thy house devours me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign  shewest thou to us, that thou doest these things?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and  in three days I will raise it up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this  temple building, and thou wilt raise it up in three days?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;But *he* spoke of the temple of his body.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;When therefore he was raised from among [the] dead, his  disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the  scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;And when he was in Jerusalem, at the passover, at the  feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he  wrought.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he  knew all [men],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;and that he had not need that any should testify of man,  for himself knew what was in man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;But there was a man from among the Pharisees, his name  Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;he came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know  that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can do these  signs that thou doest unless God be with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto  thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of  God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born being old? can  he enter a second time into the womb of his mother and be born?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any  one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the  kingdom of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is  born of the Spirit is spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Do not wonder that I said to thee, It is needful that *ye*  should be born anew.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice,  but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is  every one that is born of the Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, Thou art the teacher of  Israel and knowest not these things!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we  know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen, and ye  receive not our witness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe  not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down  out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus  must the Son of man be lifted up,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;that every one who believes on him may [not perish, but]  have life eternal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten  Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have  life eternal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;For God has not sent his Son into the world that he may  judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;He that believes on him is not judged: but he that believes  not has been already judged, because he has not believed on the  name of the only-begotten Son of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;And this is the judgment, that light is come into the  world, and men have loved darkness rather than light; for their  works were evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not  come to the light that his works may not be shewn as they are;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;but he that practises the truth comes to the light, that  his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the  land of Judaea; and there he abode with them and baptised.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;And John also was baptising in Aenon, near Salim, because  there was a great deal of water there; and they came to [him]  and were baptised:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;for John was not yet cast into prison.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;There was therefore a reasoning of the disciples of John  with a Jew about purification.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was  with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou barest witness,  behold, he baptises, and all come to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it  be given him out of heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the  Christ, but, that I am sent before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;He that has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of  the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices in heart  because of the voice of the bridegroom: this my joy then is  fulfilled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;He must increase, but I must decrease.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;He who comes from above is above all. He who has his origin  in the earth is of the earth, and speaks [as] of the earth. He  who comes out of heaven is above all,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;[and] what he has seen and has heard, this he testifies;  and no one receives his testimony.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:33">3:33</A>&nbsp;He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that  God is true;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:34">3:34</A>&nbsp;for he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God  gives not the Spirit by measure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:35">3:35</A>&nbsp;The Father loves the Son, and has given all things [to be]  in his hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:36">3:36</A>&nbsp;He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that  is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of  God abides upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard  that Jesus makes and baptises more disciples than John</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;(however, Jesus himself did not baptise, but his disciples),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;he left Judaea and went away again unto Galilee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And he must needs pass through Samaria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;He comes therefore to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near  to the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Now a fountain of Jacob's was there; Jesus therefore, being  wearied with the way he had come, sat just as he was at the  fountain. It was about the sixth hour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;A woman comes out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus says to  her, Give me to drink</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;(for his disciples had gone away into the city that they  might buy provisions).</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How dost thou,  being a Jew, ask to drink of me who am a Samaritan woman? for  Jews have no intercourse with Samaritans.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of  God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou  wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living  water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;The woman says to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,  and the well is deep: whence then hast thou the living water?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the  well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to her, Every one who drinks of  this water shall thirst again;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him  shall never thirst for ever, but the water which I shall give  him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into  eternal life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;The woman says to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may  not thirst nor come here to draw.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;The woman answered and said, I have not a husband. Jesus  says to her, Thou hast well said, I have not a husband;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom now thou hast  is not thy husband: this thou hast spoken truly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;The woman says to him, Sir, I see that thou art a prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in  Jerusalem is the place where one must worship.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, [the] hour is coming  when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship  the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for  salvation is of the Jews.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;But [the] hour is coming and now is, when the true  worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for  also the Father seeks such as his worshippers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;God [is] a spirit; and they who worship him must worship  [him] in spirit and truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;The woman says to him, I know that Messias is coming, who  is called Christ; when *he* comes he will tell us all things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am [he].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;And upon this came his disciples, and wondered that he  spoke with a woman; yet no one said, What seekest thou? or, Why  speakest thou with her?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:28">4:28</A>&nbsp;The woman then left her waterpot and went away into the  city, and says to the men,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:29">4:29</A>&nbsp;Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is  not he the Christ?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:30">4:30</A>&nbsp;They went out of the city and came to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:31">4:31</A>&nbsp;But meanwhile the disciples asked him saying, Rabbi, eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:32">4:32</A>&nbsp;But he said to them, I have food to eat which ye do not  know.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:33">4:33</A>&nbsp;The disciples therefore said to one another, Has any one  brought him [anything] to eat?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:34">4:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to them, My food is that I should do the will of  him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:35">4:35</A>&nbsp;Do not ye say, that there are yet four months and the  harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and  behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:36">4:36</A>&nbsp;He that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto life  eternal, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice  together.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:37">4:37</A>&nbsp;For in this is [verified] the true saying, It is one who  sows and another who reaps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:38">4:38</A>&nbsp;I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured;  others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:39">4:39</A>&nbsp;But many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him  because of the word of the woman who bore witness, He told me  all things that I had ever done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:40">4:40</A>&nbsp;When therefore the Samaritans came to him they asked him to  abide with them, and he abode there two days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:41">4:41</A>&nbsp;And more a great deal believed on account of his word;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:42">4:42</A>&nbsp;and they said to the woman, [It is] no longer on account of  thy saying that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves,  and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:43">4:43</A>&nbsp;But after the two days he went forth thence and went away  into Galilee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:44">4:44</A>&nbsp;for Jesus himself bore witness that a prophet has no honour  in his own country.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:45">4:45</A>&nbsp;When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans received  him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the  feast, for they also went to the feast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:46">4:46</A>&nbsp;He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made  the water wine. And there was a certain courtier in Capernaum  whose son was sick.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:47">4:47</A>&nbsp;He, having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into  Galilee, went to him and asked [him] that he would come down  and heal his son, for he was about to die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:48">4:48</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said to him, Unless ye see signs and  wonders ye will not believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:49">4:49</A>&nbsp;The courtier says to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:50">4:50</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed  the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:51">4:51</A>&nbsp;But already, as he was going down, his servants met him and  brought [him] word saying, Thy child lives.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:52">4:52</A>&nbsp;He inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got  better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the  fever left him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:53">4:53</A>&nbsp;The father therefore knew that [it was] in that hour in  which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives; and he believed,  himself and his whole house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:54">4:54</A>&nbsp;This second sign again did Jesus, being come out of Judaea  into Galilee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;After these things was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went  up to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Now there is in Jerusalem, at the sheepgate, a pool, which  is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;In these lay a multitude of sick, blind, lame, withered,  [awaiting the moving of the water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;For an angel descended at a certain season in the pool and  troubled the water. Whoever therefore first went in after the  troubling of the water became well, whatever disease he  laboured under.]</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;But there was a certain man there who had been suffering  under his infirmity thirty and eight years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;Jesus seeing this [man] lying [there], and knowing that he  was [in that state] now a great length of time, says to him,  Wouldest thou become well?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;The infirm [man] answered him, Sir, I have not a man, in  order, when the water has been troubled, to cast me into the  pool; but while I am coming another descends before me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch and walk.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;And immediately the man became well, and took up his couch  and walked: and on that day was sabbath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore said to the healed [man], It is sabbath,  it is not permitted thee to take up thy couch.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;He answered them, He that made me well, *he* said to me,  Take up thy couch and walk.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;They asked him [therefore], Who is the man who said to  thee, Take up thy couch and walk?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;But he that had been healed knew not who it was, for Jesus  had slidden away, there being a crowd in the place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said  to him, Behold, thou art become well: sin no more, that  something worse do not happen to thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who  had made him well.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus [and sought to kill  him], because he had done these things on sabbath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto and I  work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him,  because he had not only violated the sabbath, but also said  that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Verily, verily,  I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever  he sees the Father doing: for whatever things *he* does, these  things also the Son does in like manner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which  he himself does; and he will shew him greater works than these,  that ye may wonder.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens [them],  thus the Son also quickens whom he will:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;for neither does the Father judge any one, but has given  all judgment to the Son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the  Father. He who honours not the Son, honours not the Father who  has sent him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he that hears my word,  and believes him that has sent me, has life eternal, and does  not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, that an hour is coming, and  now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God,  and they that have heard shall live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given  to the Son also to have life in himself,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;and has given him authority to execute judgment [also],  because he is Son of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;Wonder not at this, for an hour is coming in which all who  are in the tombs shall hear his voice,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;and shall go forth; those that have practised good, to  resurrection of life, and those that have done evil, to  resurrection of judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;I cannot do anything of myself; as I hear, I judge, and my  judgment is righteous, because I do not seek my will, but the  will of him that has sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:31">5:31</A>&nbsp;If I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is not  true.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:32">5:32</A>&nbsp;It is another who bears witness concerning me, and I know  that the witness which he bears concerning me is true.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:33">5:33</A>&nbsp;Ye have sent unto John, and he has borne witness to the  truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:34">5:34</A>&nbsp;But I do not receive witness from man, but I say this that  *ye* might be saved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:35">5:35</A>&nbsp;*He* was the burning and shining lamp, and ye were willing  for a season to rejoice in his light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:36">5:36</A>&nbsp;But I have the witness [that is] greater than [that] of  John; for the works which the Father has given me that I should  complete them, the works themselves which I do, bear witness  concerning me that the Father has sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:37">5:37</A>&nbsp;And the Father who has sent me himself has borne witness  concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor  have seen his shape,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:38">5:38</A>&nbsp;and ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom *he* hath  sent, him ye do not believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:39">5:39</A>&nbsp;Ye search the scriptures, for ye think that in them ye have  life eternal, and they it is which bear witness concerning me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:40">5:40</A>&nbsp;and ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:41">5:41</A>&nbsp;I do not receive glory from men,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:42">5:42</A>&nbsp;but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:43">5:43</A>&nbsp;I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; if  another come in his own name, him ye will receive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:44">5:44</A>&nbsp;How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and  seek not the glory which [comes] from God alone?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:45">5:45</A>&nbsp;Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is  [one] who accuses you, Moses, on whom ye trust;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:46">5:46</A>&nbsp;for if ye had believed Moses, ye would have believed me,  for he wrote of me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:47">5:47</A>&nbsp;But if ye do not believe his writings, how shall ye believe  my words?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of  Galilee, [or] of Tiberias,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;and a great crowd followed him, because they saw the signs  which he wrought upon the sick.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there sat with his  disciples:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;but the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Jesus then, lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great  crowd is coming to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy  loaves that these may eat?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;But this he said trying him, for he knew what he was going  to do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Philip answered him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not  sufficient for them, that each may have some little [portion].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to  him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and  two small fishes; but this, what is it for so many?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;[And] Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much  grass in the place: the men therefore sat down, in number about  five thousand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks,  distributed [them] to those that were set down; and in like  manner of the small fishes as much as they would.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And when they had been filled, he says to his disciples,  Gather together the fragments which are over and above, that  nothing may be lost.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;They gathered [them] therefore together, and filled twelve  hand-baskets full of fragments of the five barley loaves, which  were over and above to those that had eaten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;The men therefore, having seen the sign which Jesus had  done, said, This is truly the prophet which is coming into the  world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore knowing that they were going to come and  seize him, that they might make [him] king, departed again to  the mountain himself alone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;But when evening was come, his disciples went down to the  sea,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;and having gone on board ship, they went over the sea to  Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not  come to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;and the sea was agitated by a strong wind blowing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;Having rowed then about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they  see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the ship; and they  were frightened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;But he says to them, It is I: be not afraid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;They were willing therefore to receive him into the ship;  and immediately the ship was at the land to which they went.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;On the morrow the crowd which stood on the other side of  the sea, having seen that there was no other little ship there  except that into which his disciples had got, and that Jesus  had not gone with his disciples into the ship, but [that] his  disciples had gone away alone;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;(but other little ships out of Tiberias came near to the  place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks;)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;when therefore the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor  his disciples, *they* got into the ships, and came to  Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;And having found him the other side of the sea, they said  to him, Rabbi, when art thou arrived here?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you,  Ye seek me not because ye have seen signs, but because ye have  eaten of the loaves and been filled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;Work not [for] the food which perishes, but [for] the food  which abides unto life eternal, which the Son of man shall give  to you; for him has the Father sealed, [even] God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;They said therefore to him, What should we do that we may  work the works of God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God,  that ye believe on him whom *he* has sent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:30">6:30</A>&nbsp;They said therefore to him, What sign then doest thou that  we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:31">6:31</A>&nbsp;Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is  written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:32">6:32</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you,  [It is] not Moses that has given you the bread out of heaven;  but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:33">6:33</A>&nbsp;For the bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven and  gives life to the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:34">6:34</A>&nbsp;They said therefore to him, Lord, ever give to us this  bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:35">6:35</A>&nbsp;[And] Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that  comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me  shall never thirst at any time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:36">6:36</A>&nbsp;But I have said to you, that ye have also seen me and do  not believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:37">6:37</A>&nbsp;All that the Father gives me shall come to me, and him that  comes to me I will not at all cast out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:38">6:38</A>&nbsp;For I am come down from heaven, not that I should do *my*  will, but the will of him that has sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:39">6:39</A>&nbsp;And this is the will of him that has sent me, that of all  that he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it  up in the last day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:40">6:40</A>&nbsp;For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees  the Son, and believes on him, should have life eternal; and I  will raise him up at the last day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:41">6:41</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore murmured about him, because he said, I  am the bread which has come down out of heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:42">6:42</A>&nbsp;And they said, Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose  father and mother we have known? how then does *he* say, I am  come down out of heaven?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:43">6:43</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among  yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:44">6:44</A>&nbsp;No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me  draw him, and I will raise him up in the last day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:45">6:45</A>&nbsp;It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught  of God. Every one that has heard from the Father [himself], and  has learned [of him], comes to me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:46">6:46</A>&nbsp;not that any one has seen the Father, except he who is of  God, he has seen the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:47">6:47</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believes [on me] has  life eternal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:48">6:48</A>&nbsp;I am the bread of life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:49">6:49</A>&nbsp;Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and died.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:50">6:50</A>&nbsp;This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that one  may eat of it and not die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:51">6:51</A>&nbsp;I am the living bread which has come down out of heaven: if  any one shall have eaten of this bread he shall live for ever;  but the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh, which I  will give for the life of the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:52">6:52</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, How  can he give us this flesh to eat?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:53">6:53</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto  you, Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man,  and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:54">6:54</A>&nbsp;He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal,  and I will raise him up at the last day:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:55">6:55</A>&nbsp;for my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:56">6:56</A>&nbsp;He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and  I in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:57">6:57</A>&nbsp;As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of  the Father, *he* also who eats me shall live also on account of  me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:58">6:58</A>&nbsp;This is the bread which has come down out of heaven. Not as  the fathers ate and died: he that eats this bread shall live  for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:59">6:59</A>&nbsp;These things he said in [the] synagogue, teaching in  Capernaum.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:60">6:60</A>&nbsp;Many therefore of his disciples having heard [it] said,  This word is hard; who can hear it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:61">6:61</A>&nbsp;But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmur  concerning this, said to them, Does this offend you?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:62">6:62</A>&nbsp;If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was  before?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:63">6:63</A>&nbsp;It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing:  the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:64">6:64</A>&nbsp;But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus  knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and  who would deliver him up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:65">6:65</A>&nbsp;And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no one can  come to me unless it be given to him from the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:66">6:66</A>&nbsp;From that [time] many of his disciples went away back and  walked no more with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:67">6:67</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Will ye also go away?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:68">6:68</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou  hast words of life eternal;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:69">6:69</A>&nbsp;and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one  of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:70">6:70</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you the twelve? and  of you one is a devil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:71">6:71</A>&nbsp;Now he spoke of Judas [the son] of Simon, Iscariote, for he  [it was who] should deliver him up, being one of the twelve.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would  not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;Now the tabernacles, the feast of the Jews, was near.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;His brethren therefore said to him, Remove hence and go into  Judaea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou  doest;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be  [known] in public. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself  to the world:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;for neither did his brethren believe on him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet come, but  your time is always ready.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;The world cannot hate you, but me it hates, because I bear  witness concerning it that its works are evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Ye, go ye up to this feast. I go not up to this feast, for  *my* time is not yet fulfilled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;Having said these things to them he abode in Galilee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;But when his brethren had gone up, then he himself also  went up to the feast, not openly, but as in secret.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where  is he?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;And there was much murmuring concerning him among the  crowds. Some said, He is [a] good [man]; others said, No; but  he deceives the crowd.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;However, no one spoke openly concerning him on account of  [their] fear of the Jews.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up  into the temple and taught.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore wondered, saying, How knows this [man]  letters, having never learned?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore answered them and said, My doctrine is not  mine, but [that] of him that has sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;If any one desire to practise his will, he shall know  concerning the doctrine, whether it is of God, or [that] I  speak from myself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;He that speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but he  that seeks the glory of him that has sent him, he is true, and  unrighteousness is not in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;Has not Moses given you the law, and no one of you  practises the law? Why do ye seek to kill me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;The crowd answered [and said], Thou hast a demon: who seeks  to kill thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and  ye all wonder.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;Therefore Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is of  Moses, but of the fathers), and ye circumcise a man on sabbath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;If a man receives circumcision on sabbath, that the law of  Moses may not be violated, are ye angry with me because I have  made a man entirely sound on sabbath?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;Judge not according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;Some therefore of those of Jerusalem said, Is not this he  whom they seek to kill?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;and behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him.  Have the rulers then indeed recognised that this is the Christ?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;But [as to] this [man] we know whence he is. Now [as to]  the Christ, when he comes, no one knows whence he is.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and  saying, Ye both know me and ye know whence I am; and I am not  come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye do not  know.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:29">7:29</A>&nbsp;I know him, because I am from him, and *he* has sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:30">7:30</A>&nbsp;They sought therefore to take him; and no one laid his hand  upon him, because his hour had not yet come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:31">7:31</A>&nbsp;But many of the crowd believed on him, and said, Will the  Christ, when he comes, do more signs than those which this  [man] has done?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:32">7:32</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things  concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent  officers that they might take him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:33">7:33</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while I am with you, and  I go to him that has sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:34">7:34</A>&nbsp;Ye shall seek me and shall not find [me], and where I am ye  cannot come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:35">7:35</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore said to one another, Where is he about  to go that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to the  dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:36">7:36</A>&nbsp;What word is this which he said, Ye shall seek me and shall  not find [me]; and where I am ye cannot come?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:37">7:37</A>&nbsp;In the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and  cried saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:38">7:38</A>&nbsp;He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of  his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:39">7:39</A>&nbsp;But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that  believed on him were about to receive; for [the] Spirit was not  yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:40">7:40</A>&nbsp;[Some] out of the crowd therefore, having heard this word,  said, This is truly the prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:41">7:41</A>&nbsp;Others said, This is the Christ. Others said, Does then the  Christ come out of Galilee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:42">7:42</A>&nbsp;Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes of the  seed of David, and from the village of Bethlehem, where David  was?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:43">7:43</A>&nbsp;There was a division therefore in the crowd on account of  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:44">7:44</A>&nbsp;But some of them desired to take him, but no one laid hands  upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:45">7:45</A>&nbsp;The officers therefore came to the chief priests and  Pharisees, and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:46">7:46</A>&nbsp;The officers answered, Never man spoke thus, as this man  [speaks].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:47">7:47</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also  deceived?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:48">7:48</A>&nbsp;Has any one of the rulers believed on him, or of the  Pharisees?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:49">7:49</A>&nbsp;But this crowd, which does not know the law, are accursed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:50">7:50</A>&nbsp;Nicodemus says to them (being one of themselves),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:51">7:51</A>&nbsp;Does our law judge a man before it have first heard from  himself, and know what he does?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:52">7:52</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, Art thou also of Galilee?  Search and look, that no prophet arises out of Galilee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:53">7:53</A>&nbsp;And every one went to his home.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;But Jesus went to the mount of Olives.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and  all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And the scribes and the Pharisees bring [to him] a woman  taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;they say to him, Teacher, this woman has been taken in the  very act, committing adultery.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Now in the law Moses has commanded us to stone such; thou  therefore, what sayest thou?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;But this they said proving him, that they might have  [something] to accuse him [of]. But Jesus, having stooped down,  wrote with his finger on the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and  said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast  the stone at her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;And again stooping down he wrote on the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;But they, having heard [that], went out one by one beginning  from the elder ones until the last; and Jesus was left alone  and the woman standing there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, lifting himself up and seeing no one but the  woman, said to her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Has  no one condemned thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;And she said, No one, sir. And Jesus said to her, Neither  do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light  of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness,  but shall have the light of life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou bearest witness  concerning thyself; thy witness is not true.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness  concerning myself, my witness is true, because I know whence I  came and whither I go: but ye know not whence I come and  whither I go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;Ye judge according to the flesh, I judge no one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;And if also I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not  alone, but I and the Father who has sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And in your law too it is written that the testimony of two  men is true:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;I am [one] who bear witness concerning myself, and the  Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;They said to him therefore, Where is thy Father? Jesus  answered, Ye know neither me nor my Father. If ye had known me,  ye would have known also my Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;These words spoke he in the treasury, teaching in the  temple; and no one took him, for his hour was not yet come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;He said therefore again to them, I go away, and ye shall  seek me, and shall die in your sin; where I go ye cannot come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he  says, Where I go ye cannot come?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:23">8:23</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above.  Ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins;  for unless ye shall believe that I am [he], ye shall die in  your sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;They said therefore to him, Who art thou? [And] Jesus said  to them, Altogether that which I also say to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but  he that has sent me is true, and I, what I have heard from him,  these things I say to the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;They knew not that he spoke to them of the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said to them, When ye shall have lifted up  the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am [he], and [that] I  do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak  these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;And he that has sent me is with me; he has not left me  alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;As he spoke these things many believed on him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him, If ye  abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you  free.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:33">8:33</A>&nbsp;They answered him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never  been under bondage to any one; how sayest thou, Ye shall become  free?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:34">8:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every  one that practises sin is the bondman of sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:35">8:35</A>&nbsp;Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever: the son  abides for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:36">8:36</A>&nbsp;If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really  free.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:37">8:37</A>&nbsp;I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me,  because my word has no entrance in you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:38">8:38</A>&nbsp;I speak what I have seen with my Father, and ye then do  what ye have seen with your father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:39">8:39</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus  says to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the  works of Abraham;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:40">8:40</A>&nbsp;but now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth  to you, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:41">8:41</A>&nbsp;Ye do the works of your father. They said [therefore] to  him, We are not born of fornication; we have one father, God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:42">8:42</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, If God were your father ye would have  loved me, for I came forth from God and am come [from him]; for  neither am I come of myself, but *he* has sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:43">8:43</A>&nbsp;Why do ye not know my speech? Because ye cannot hear my  word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:44">8:44</A>&nbsp;Ye are of the devil, as [your] father, and ye desire to do  the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning,  and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in  him. When he speaks falsehood, he speaks of what is his own;  for he is a liar and its father:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:45">8:45</A>&nbsp;and because I speak the truth, ye do not believe me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:46">8:46</A>&nbsp;Which of you convinces me of sin? If I speak truth, why do  ye not believe me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:47">8:47</A>&nbsp;He that is of God hears the words of God: therefore ye hear  [them] not, because ye are not of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:48">8:48</A>&nbsp;The Jews answered and said to him, Say we not well that  thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:49">8:49</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father,  and ye dishonour me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:50">8:50</A>&nbsp;But I do not seek my own glory: there is he that seeks and  judges.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:51">8:51</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, If any one shall keep my  word, he shall never see death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:52">8:52</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore said to him, Now we know that thou hast  a demon. Abraham has died, and the prophets, and thou sayest,  If any one keep my word, he shall never taste death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:53">8:53</A>&nbsp;Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who has died? and  the prophets have died: whom makest thou thyself?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:54">8:54</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing:  it is my Father who glorifies me, [of] whom ye say, He is our  God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:55">8:55</A>&nbsp;And ye know him not; but I know him; and if I said, I know  him not, I should be like you, a liar. But I know him, and I  keep his word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:56">8:56</A>&nbsp;Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day,  and he saw and rejoiced.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:57">8:57</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore said to him, Thou hast not yet fifty  years, and hast thou seen Abraham?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:58">8:58</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before  Abraham was, I am.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:59">8:59</A>&nbsp;They took up therefore stones that they might cast [them]  at him; but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple,  [going through the midst of them, and thus passed on.]</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And as he passed on, he saw a man blind from birth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this  [man] or his parents, that he should be born blind?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, Neither has this [man] sinned nor his  parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is  day. [The] night is coming, when no one can work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;As long as I am in the world, I am [the] light of the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud  of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which is  interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed, and came  seeing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;The neighbours therefore, and those who used to see him  before, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that was  sitting and begging?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;Some said, It is he; others said, No, but he is like him:  *he* said, It is I.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;They said therefore to him, How have thine eyes been  opened?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;He answered [and said], A man called Jesus made mud and  anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash: and  having gone and washed, I saw.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;They said therefore to him, Where is he? He says, I do not  know.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;They bring him who was before blind to the Pharisees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;Now it was sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his  eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees therefore also again asked him how he  received his sight. And he said to them, He put mud upon mine  eyes, and I washed, and I see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;Some of the Pharisees therefore said, This man is not of  God, for he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a  sinful man perform such signs? And there was a division among  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;They say therefore again to the blind [man], What dost thou  say of him, that he has opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a  prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he  was blind and had received sight, until they had called the  parents of him that had received sight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;And they asked them saying, This is your son, of whom ye  say that he was born blind: how then does he now see?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;His parents answered [them] and said, We know that this is  our son, and that he was born blind;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;but how he now sees we do not know, or who has opened his  eyes we do not know. *He* is of age: ask *him*; *he* will speak  concerning himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;His parents said these things because they feared the Jews,  for the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed him  [to be the] Christ, he should be excommunicated from the  synagogue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;On this account his parents said, He is of age: ask *him*.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;They called therefore a second time the man who had been  blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this  man is sinful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One  thing I know, that, being blind [before], now I see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;And they said to him again, What did he do to thee? how  opened he thine eyes?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;He answered them, I told you already and ye did not hear:  why do ye desire to hear again? do ye also wish to become his  disciples?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we  are disciples of Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;We know that God spoke to Moses; but [as to] this [man], we  know not whence he is.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:30">9:30</A>&nbsp;The man answered and said to them, Now in this is a  wonderful thing, that *ye* do not know whence he is, and he has  opened mine eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:31">9:31</A>&nbsp;[But] we know that God does not hear sinners; but if any  one be God-fearing and do his will, him he hears.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:32">9:32</A>&nbsp;Since time was, it has not been heard that any one opened  the eyes of one born blind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:33">9:33</A>&nbsp;If this [man] were not of God he would be able to do  nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:34">9:34</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, Thou hast been wholly born  in sins, and thou teachest us? And they cast him out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:35">9:35</A>&nbsp;Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found  him, he said to him, Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:36">9:36</A>&nbsp;He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may  believe on him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:37">9:37</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that  speaks with thee is he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:38">9:38</A>&nbsp;And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:39">9:39</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world,  that they which see not may see, and they which see may become  blind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:40">9:40</A>&nbsp;And [some] of the Pharisees who were with him heard these  things, and they said to him, Are we blind also?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:41">9:41</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, If ye were blind ye would not have sin;  but now ye say, We see, your sin remains.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, He that enters not in by the  door to the fold of the sheep, but mounts up elsewhere, *he* is  a thief and a robber;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;but he that enters in by the door is [the] shepherd of the  sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice; and  he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and  the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from  him, because they know not the voice of strangers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;This allegory spoke Jesus to them, but they did not know  what it was [of] which he spoke to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said again to them, Verily, verily, I say  to you, I am the door of the sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers; but the  sheep did not hear them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be  saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;The thief comes not but that he may steal, and kill, and  destroy: I am come that they might have life, and might have  [it] abundantly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his  life for the sheep:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;but he who serves for wages, and who is not the shepherd,  whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves  the sheep and flees; and the wolf seizes them and scatters the  sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;Now he who serves for wages flees because he serves for  wages, and is not himself concerned about the sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine,  and am known of those that are mine,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay  down my life for the sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;And I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those  also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there  shall be one flock, one shepherd.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my  life that I may take it again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I  have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it  again. I have received this commandment of my Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;There was a division again among the Jews on account of  these words;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;but many of them said, He has a demon and raves; why do ye  hear him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;Others said, These sayings are not [those] of one that is  possessed by a demon. Can a demon open blind people's eyes?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;Now the feast of the dedication was celebrating at  Jerusalem, and it was winter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;And Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore surrounded him, and said to him, Until  when dost thou hold our soul in suspense? If thou art the  Christ, say [so] to us openly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye do not believe.  The works which I do in my Father's name, these bear witness  concerning me:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:26">10:26</A>&nbsp;but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, as I  told you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:27">10:27</A>&nbsp;My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow  me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:28">10:28</A>&nbsp;and I give them life eternal; and they shall never perish,  and no one shall seize them out of my hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:29">10:29</A>&nbsp;My Father who has given [them] to me is greater than all,  and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:30">10:30</A>&nbsp;I and the Father are one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:31">10:31</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:32">10:32</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewn you of  my Father; for which work of them do ye stone me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:33">10:33</A>&nbsp;The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not,  but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, makest  thyself God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:34">10:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I  said, Ye are gods?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:35">10:35</A>&nbsp;If he called *them* gods to whom the word of God came (and  the scripture cannot be broken),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:36">10:36</A>&nbsp;do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent  into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am Son of  God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:37">10:37</A>&nbsp;If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:38">10:38</A>&nbsp;but if I do, even if ye believe not me, believe the works,  that ye may know [and believe] that the Father is in me and I  in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:39">10:39</A>&nbsp;They sought therefore again to take him; and he went away  from out of their hand</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:40">10:40</A>&nbsp;and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where  John was baptising at the first: and he abode there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:41">10:41</A>&nbsp;And many came to him, and said, John did no sign; but all  things which John said of this [man] were true.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:42">10:42</A>&nbsp;And many believed on him there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;Now there was a certain [man] sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of  the village of Mary and Martha her sister.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;It was [the] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and  wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he  whom thou lovest is sick.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;But when Jesus heard [it], he said, This sickness is not  unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may  be glorified by it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;When therefore he heard, He is sick, he remained two days  then in the place where he was.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;Then after this he says to his disciples, Let us go into  Judaea again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;The disciples say to him, Rabbi, [even but] now the Jews  sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If  any one walk in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees  the light of this world;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;but if any one walk in the night, he stumbles, because the  light is not in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;These things said he; and after this he says to them,  Lazarus, our friend, is fallen asleep, but I go that I may  awake him out of sleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he be fallen  asleep, he will get well.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;But Jesus spoke of his death, but *they* thought that he  spoke of the rest of sleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore then said to them plainly, Lazarus has  died.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;And I rejoice on your account that I was not there, in  order that ye may believe. But let us go to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;Thomas therefore, called Didymus, said to his fellow  disciples, Let *us* also go, that we may die with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore [on] arriving found him to have been four  days already in the tomb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia off,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, that they  might console them concerning their brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;Martha then, when she heard Jesus is coming, went to meet  him; but Mary sat in the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;Martha therefore said to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been  here, my brother had not died;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;but even now I know, that whatsoever thou shalt ask of  God, God will give thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to her, Thy brother shall rise again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;Martha says to him, I know that he will rise again in the  resurrection in the last day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life: he  that believes on me, though he have died, shall live;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:26">11:26</A>&nbsp;and every one who lives and believes on me shall never  die. Believest thou this?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:27">11:27</A>&nbsp;She says to him, Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the  Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:28">11:28</A>&nbsp;And having said this, she went away and called her sister  Mary secretly, saying, The teacher is come and calls thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:29">11:29</A>&nbsp;She, when she heard [that], rises up quickly and comes to  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:30">11:30</A>&nbsp;Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in  the place where Martha came to meet him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:31">11:31</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and  consoling her, seeing Mary that she rose up quickly and went  out, followed her, saying, She goes to the tomb, that she may  weep there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:32">11:32</A>&nbsp;Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him,  fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here,  my brother had not died.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:33">11:33</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who  came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit, and was  troubled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:34">11:34</A>&nbsp;and said, Where have ye put him? They say to him, Lord,  come and see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:35">11:35</A>&nbsp;Jesus wept.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:36">11:36</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:37">11:37</A>&nbsp;And some of them said, Could not this [man], who has  opened the eyes of the blind [man], have caused that this [man]  also should not have died?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:38">11:38</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore, again deeply moved in himself, comes to  the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:39">11:39</A>&nbsp;Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the  dead, says to him, Lord, he stinks already, for he is four days  [there].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:40">11:40</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to her, Did I not say to thee, that if thou  shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:41">11:41</A>&nbsp;They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifted up  his eyes on high and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast  heard me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:42">11:42</A>&nbsp;but I knew that thou always hearest me; but on account of  the crowd who stand around I have said [it], that they may  believe that thou hast sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:43">11:43</A>&nbsp;And having said this, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus,  come forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:44">11:44</A>&nbsp;And the dead came forth, bound feet and hands with  graveclothes, and his face was bound round with a handkerchief.  Jesus says to them, Loose him and let him go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:45">11:45</A>&nbsp;Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what  he had done, believed on him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:46">11:46</A>&nbsp;but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what  Jesus had done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:47">11:47</A>&nbsp;The chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees gathered a  council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:48">11:48</A>&nbsp;If we let him thus alone, all will believe on him, and the  Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:49">11:49</A>&nbsp;But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest  that year, said to them, Ye know nothing</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:50">11:50</A>&nbsp;nor consider that it is profitable for you that one man  die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:51">11:51</A>&nbsp;But this he did not say of himself; but, being high priest  that year, prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the  nation;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:52">11:52</A>&nbsp;and not for the nation only, but that he should also  gather together into one the children of God who were scattered  abroad.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:53">11:53</A>&nbsp;From that day therefore they took counsel that they might  kill him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:54">11:54</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews,  but went away thence into the country near the desert, to a  city called Ephraim, and there he sojourned with the disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:55">11:55</A>&nbsp;But the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to  Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they  might purify themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:56">11:56</A>&nbsp;They sought therefore Jesus, and said among themselves,  standing in the temple, What do ye think? that he will not come  to the feast?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:57">11:57</A>&nbsp;Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given  commandment that if any one knew where he was, he should make  it known, that they might take him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to  Bethany, where was the dead [man] Lazarus, whom Jesus raised  from among [the] dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served,  but Lazarus was one of those at table with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure  nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his  feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of  the ointment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;One of his disciples therefore, Judas [son] of Simon,  Iscariote, who was about to deliver him up, says,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii  and given to the poor?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;But he said this, not that he cared for the poor, but  because he was a thief and had the bag, and carried what was  put into [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to have kept this for the  day of my preparation for burial;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;for ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not  always.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;A great crowd therefore of the Jews knew that he was there;  and they came, not because of Jesus only, but also that they  might see Lazarus whom he raised from among [the] dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;But the chief priests took counsel that they might kill  Lazarus also,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;because many of the Jews went away on his account and  believed on Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;On the morrow a great crowd who came to the feast, having  heard that Jesus is coming into Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;took branches of palms and went out to meet him, and  cried, Hosanna, blessed [is] he that comes in the name of [the]  Lord, the King of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it; as it is  written,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh,  sitting on an ass's colt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;[Now] his disciples knew not these things at the first;  but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these  things were written of him, and that they had done these things  to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;The crowd therefore that was with him bore witness because  he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from  among [the] dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;Therefore also the crowd met him because they had heard  that he had done this sign.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees therefore said to one another, Ye see that  ye profit nothing: behold, the world is gone after him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;And there were certain Greeks among those who came up that  they might worship in the feast;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of  Galilee, and they asked him saying, Sir, we desire to see  Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;Philip comes and tells Andrew, [and again] Andrew comes  and Philip, and they tell Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;But Jesus answered them saying, The hour is come that the  Son of man should be glorified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:24">12:24</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except the grain of wheat  falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it  bears much fruit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:25">12:25</A>&nbsp;He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates  his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:26">12:26</A>&nbsp;If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am,  there also shall be *my* servant. [And] if any one serve me,  him shall the Father honour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:27">12:27</A>&nbsp;Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father,  save me from this hour. But on account of this have I come to  this hour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:28">12:28</A>&nbsp;Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out  of heaven, I both have glorified and will glorify [it] again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:29">12:29</A>&nbsp;The crowd therefore, which stood [there] and heard [it],  said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:30">12:30</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said, Not on my account has this voice  come, but on yours.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:31">12:31</A>&nbsp;Now is [the] judgment of this world; now shall the prince  of this world be cast out:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:32">12:32</A>&nbsp;and I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all  to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:33">12:33</A>&nbsp;But this he said signifying by what death he was about to  die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:34">12:34</A>&nbsp;The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that  the Christ abides for ever; and how sayest thou that the Son of  man must be lifted up? Who *is* this, the Son of man?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:35">12:35</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the  light amongst you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness  may not overtake you. And he who walks in the darkness does not  know where he goes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:36">12:36</A>&nbsp;While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may  become sons of light. Jesus said these things, and going away  hid himself from them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:37">12:37</A>&nbsp;But though he had done so many signs before them, they  believed not on him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:38">12:38</A>&nbsp;that the word of the prophet Esaias which he said might be  fulfilled, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has  the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:39">12:39</A>&nbsp;On this account they could not believe, because Esaias  said again,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:40">12:40</A>&nbsp;He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that  they may not see with their eyes, and understand with their  heart and be converted, and I should heal them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:41">12:41</A>&nbsp;These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and  spoke of him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:42">12:42</A>&nbsp;Although indeed from among the rulers also many believed  on him, but on account of the Pharisees did not confess [him],  that they might not be put out of the synagogue:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:43">12:43</A>&nbsp;for they loved glory from men rather than glory from God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:44">12:44</A>&nbsp;But Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes  not on me, but on him that sent me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:45">12:45</A>&nbsp;and he that beholds me, beholds him that sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:46">12:46</A>&nbsp;I am come into the world [as] light, that every one that  believes on me may not abide in darkness;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:47">12:47</A>&nbsp;and if any one hear my words and do not keep [them], I  judge him not, for I am not come that I might judge the world,  but that I might save the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:48">12:48</A>&nbsp;He that rejects me and does not receive my words, has him  who judges him: the word which I have spoken, that shall judge  him in the last day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:49">12:49</A>&nbsp;For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father who sent  me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what  I should speak;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:50">12:50</A>&nbsp;and I know that his commandment is life eternal. What  therefore I speak, as the Father has said to me, so I speak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus, knowing that  his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to  the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved  them to the end.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;And during supper, the devil having already put it into the  heart of Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote, that he should  deliver him up,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;[Jesus,] knowing that the Father had given him all things  into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to  God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;rises from supper and lays aside his garments, and having  taken a linen towel he girded himself:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;then he pours water into the washhand basin, and began to  wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the linen  towel with which he was girded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;He comes therefore to Simon Peter; and *he* says to him,  Lord, dost thou wash *my* feet?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou dost not  know now, but thou shalt know hereafter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;Peter says to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus  answered him, Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also  my hands and my head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to him, He that is washed all over needs not to  wash save his feet, but is wholly clean; and ye are clean, but  not all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;For he knew him that delivered him up: on account of this  he said, Ye are not all clean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;When therefore he had washed their feet, and taken his  garments, having sat down again, he said to them, Do ye know  what I have done to you?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord, and ye say well, for  I am [so].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your  feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;for I have given you an example that, as I have done to  you, ye should do also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, The bondman is not greater  than his lord, nor the sent greater than he who has sent him.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;I speak not of you all. I know those whom I have chosen;  but that the scripture might be fulfilled, He that eats bread  with me has lifted up his heel against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:19">13:19</A>&nbsp;I tell you [it] now before it happens, that when it  happens, ye may believe that I am [he].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:20">13:20</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, He who receives whomsoever I  shall send receives me; and he that receives me receives him  who has sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;Having said these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit,  and testified and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, that one  of you shall deliver me up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;The disciples therefore looked one on another, doubting of  whom he spoke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;Now there was at table one of his disciples in the bosom  of Jesus, whom Jesus loved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:24">13:24</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter makes a sign therefore to him to ask who it  might be of whom he spoke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:25">13:25</A>&nbsp;But he, leaning on the breast of Jesus, says to him, Lord,  who is it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:26">13:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus answers, He it is to whom I, after I have dipped the  morsel, give it. And having dipped the morsel, he gives it to  Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:27">13:27</A>&nbsp;And, after the morsel, then entered Satan into him. Jesus  therefore says to him, What thou doest, do quickly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:28">13:28</A>&nbsp;But none of those at table knew why he said this to him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:29">13:29</A>&nbsp;for some supposed, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus  was saying to him, Buy the things of which we have need for the  feast; or that he should give something to the poor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:30">13:30</A>&nbsp;Having therefore received the morsel, he went out  immediately; and it was night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:31">13:31</A>&nbsp;When therefore he was gone out Jesus says, Now is the Son  of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:32">13:32</A>&nbsp;If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in  himself, and shall glorify him immediately.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:33">13:33</A>&nbsp;Children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek  me; and, as I said to the Jews, Where I go ye cannot come, I  say to you also now.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:34">13:34</A>&nbsp;A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another;  as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:35">13:35</A>&nbsp;By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if  ye have love amongst yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:36">13:36</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where goest thou? Jesus  answered him, Where I go thou canst not follow me now, but thou  shalt follow me after.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:37">13:37</A>&nbsp;Peter says to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I  will lay down my life for thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:38">13:38</A>&nbsp;Jesus answers, Thou wilt lay down thy life for me! Verily,  verily, I say to thee, The cock shall not crow till thou hast  denied me thrice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe on God, believe  also on me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;In my Father's house there are many abodes; were it not so,  I had told you: for I go to prepare you a place;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou goest, and  how can we know the way?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the  life. No one comes to the Father unless by me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father, and  henceforth ye know him and have seen him.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to him, Am I so long a time with you, and thou  hast not known me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen the  Father; and how sayest thou, Shew us the Father?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;Believest thou not that I [am] in the Father, and that the  Father is in me? The words which I speak to you I do not speak  from myself; but the Father who abides in me, he does the  works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;Believe *me* that I [am] in the Father and the Father in  me; but if not, believe me for the works' sake themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believes on me, the  works which I do shall he do also, and he shall do greater than  these, because I go to the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, this will I do,  that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;In that day ye shall know that I [am] in my Father, and ye  in me, and I in you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:21">14:21</A>&nbsp;He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that  loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and  I will love him and will manifest myself to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:22">14:22</A>&nbsp;Judas, not the Iscariote, says to him, Lord, how is it  that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:23">14:23</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, If any one love me, he  will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will  come to him and make our abode with him.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:26">14:26</A>&nbsp;but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will  send in my name, *he* shall teach you all things, and will  bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to  you.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:30">14:30</A>&nbsp;I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the  world comes, and in me he has nothing;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;[As to] every branch in me not bearing fruit, he takes it  away; and [as to] every one bearing fruit, he purges it that it  may bring forth more fruit.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit  of itself unless it abide in the vine, thus neither [can] ye  unless ye abide in me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;I am the vine, ye [are] the branches. He that abides in me  and I in him, *he* bears much fruit; for without me ye can do  nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;Unless any one abide in me he is cast out as the branch,  and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the  fire, and they are burned.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;No one has greater love than this, that one should lay  down his life for his friends.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;I call you no longer bondmen, for the bondman does not  know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends,  for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made  known to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:16">15:16</A>&nbsp;Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and have set  you that ye should go and [that] ye should bear fruit, and  [that] your fruit should abide, that whatsoever ye shall ask  the Father in my name he may give you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;These things I command you, that ye love one another.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but  because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of  the world, on account of this the world hates you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;Remember the word which I said unto you, The bondman is  not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they  will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will  keep also yours.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:21">15:21</A>&nbsp;But they will do all these things to you on account of my  name, because they have not known him that sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had  sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;He that hates me hates also my Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;If I had not done among them the works which no other one  has done, they had not had sin; but now they have both seen and  hated both me and my Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;But that the word written in their law might be fulfilled,  They hated me without a cause.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you  from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with  the Father, *he* shall bear witness concerning me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;and ye too bear witness, because ye are with me from [the]  beginning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;These things I have spoken unto you that ye may not be  offended.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;They shall put you out of the synagogues; but the hour is  coming that every one who kills you will think to render  service to God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;and these things they will do because they have not known  the Father nor me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;But I have spoken these things to you, that when their hour  shall have come, ye may remember them, that I have said [them]  unto you. But I did not say these things unto you from [the]  beginning, because I was with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;But now I go to him that has sent me, and none of you  demands of me, Where goest thou?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has  filled your heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;But I say the truth to you, It is profitable for you that I  go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come  to you; but if I go I will send him to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;And having come, he will bring demonstration to the world,  of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;of righteousness, because I go away to [my] Father, and ye  behold me no longer;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear  them now.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide  you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself;  but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will  announce to you what is coming.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and  shall announce [it] to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;All things that the Father has are mine; on account of  this I have said that he receives of mine and shall announce  [it] to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a little  while and ye shall see me, [because I go away to the Father].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;[Some] of his disciples therefore said to one another,  What is this he says to us, A little while and ye do not behold  me; and again a little while and ye shall see me, and, Because  I go away to the Father?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;They said therefore, What is this which he says [of] the  little while? We do not know [of] what he speaks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;Jesus knew therefore that they desired to demand of him,  and said to them, Do ye inquire of this among yourselves that I  said, A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a  little while and ye shall see me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, that ye shall weep and  lament, ye, but the world shall rejoice; and ye will be  grieved, but your grief shall be turned to joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:21">16:21</A>&nbsp;A woman, when she gives birth to a child, has grief  because her hour has come; but when the child is born, she no  longer remembers the trouble, on account of the joy that a man  has been born into the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:22">16:22</A>&nbsp;And ye now therefore have grief; but I will see you again,  and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from  you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:23">16:23</A>&nbsp;And in that day ye shall demand nothing of me: verily,  verily, I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my  name, he will give you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:24">16:24</A>&nbsp;Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye  shall receive, that your joy may be full.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:25">16:25</A>&nbsp;These things I have spoken to you in allegories; the hour  is coming that I will no longer speak to you in allegories, but  will declare to you openly concerning the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:26">16:26</A>&nbsp;In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not to you  that I will demand of the Father for you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:27">16:27</A>&nbsp;for the Father himself has affection for you, because ye  have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out  from God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:28">16:28</A>&nbsp;I came out from the Father and have come into the world;  again, I leave the world and go to the Father.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:30">16:30</A>&nbsp;Now we know that thou knowest all things, and hast not  need that any one should demand of thee. By this we believe  that thou art come from God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:31">16:31</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:32">16:32</A>&nbsp;Behold, [the] hour is coming, and has come, that ye shall  be scattered, each to his own, and shall leave me alone; and  [yet] I am not alone, for the Father is with me.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;Jesus, having said these things, went out with his  disciples beyond the torrent Cedron, where was a garden, into  which he entered, he and his disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;And Judas also, who delivered him up, knew the place,  because Jesus was often there, in company with his disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;Judas therefore, having got the band, and officers of the  chief priests and Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and  torches and weapons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were coming upon  him, went forth and said to them, Whom seek ye?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;They answered him, Jesus the Nazaraean. Jesus says to them,  I am [he]. And Judas also, who delivered him up, stood with  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;When therefore he said to them, I am [he], they went away  backward and fell to the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;He demanded of them therefore again, Whom seek ye? And they  said, Jesus the Nazaraean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, I told you that I am [he]: if therefore ye  seek me, let these go away;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, [As to]  those whom thou hast given me, I have not lost one of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and smote  the bondman of the high priest and cut off his right ear; and  the bondman's name was Malchus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put the sword into the  sheath; the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not  drink it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;The band therefore, and the chiliarch, and the officers of  the Jews, took Jesus and bound him:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;and they led him away to Annas first; for he was  father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;But it was Caiaphas who counselled the Jews that it was  better that one man should perish for the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;Now Simon Peter followed Jesus, and the other disciple.  But that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in  with Jesus into the palace of the high priest;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;but Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple  therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke  to the porteress and brought in Peter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;The maid therefore, who was porteress, says to Peter, Art  thou also of the disciples of this man? He says, I am not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:18">18:18</A>&nbsp;But the bondmen and officers, having made a fire of coals  (for it was cold), stood and warmed themselves; and Peter was  standing with them and warming himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:19">18:19</A>&nbsp;The high priest therefore demanded of Jesus concerning his  disciples and concerning his doctrine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:20">18:20</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I taught  always in [the] synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews  come together, and in secret I have spoken nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:21">18:21</A>&nbsp;Why demandest thou of me? Demand of those who have heard,  what I have spoken to them; behold, they know what I have said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:22">18:22</A>&nbsp;But as he said these things, one of the officers who stood  by gave a blow on the face to Jesus, saying, Answerest thou the  high priest thus?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:23">18:23</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of  the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:24">18:24</A>&nbsp;Annas [then] had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high  priest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:25">18:25</A>&nbsp;But Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They  said therefore to him, Art thou also of his disciples? He  denied, and said, I am not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:26">18:26</A>&nbsp;One of the bondmen of the high priest, who was kinsman of  him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did not I see thee in the  garden with him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:27">18:27</A>&nbsp;Peter denied therefore again, and immediately [the] cock  crew.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:28">18:28</A>&nbsp;They lead therefore Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium;  and it was early morn. And *they* entered not into the  praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but eat the  passover.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:29">18:29</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore went out to them and said, What  accusation do ye bring against this man?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:30">18:30</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, If this [man] were not an  evildoer, we should not have delivered him up to thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:31">18:31</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore said to them, Take him, ye, and judge him  according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is  not permitted to us to put any one to death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:32">18:32</A>&nbsp;that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke,  signifying what death he should die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:33">18:33</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium and  called Jesus, and said to him, Thou art the king of the Jews?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:34">18:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered [him], Dost thou say this of thyself, or  have others said it to thee concerning me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:35">18:35</A>&nbsp;Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy nation and the chief  priests have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou done?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:36">18:36</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world; if my  kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought that I might  not be delivered up to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from  hence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:37">18:37</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore said to him, Thou art then a king? Jesus  answered, Thou sayest [it], that I am a king. I have been born  for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might  bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears  my voice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:38">18:38</A>&nbsp;Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this he  went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find no fault  whatever in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:39">18:39</A>&nbsp;But ye have a custom that I release [some] one to you at  the passover; will ye therefore that I release unto you the  king of the Jews?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:40">18:40</A>&nbsp;They cried therefore again all, saying, Not this [man],  but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged [him].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns put it on  his head, and put a purple robe on him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;and came to him and said, Hail, king of the Jews! and gave  him blows on the face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;And Pilate went out again and says to them, Lo, I bring him  out to you, that ye may know that I find in him no fault  whatever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;(Jesus therefore went forth without, wearing the crown of  thorn, and the purple robe.) And he says to them, Behold the  man!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him  they cried out saying, Crucify, crucify [him]. Pilate says to  them, Take him ye and crucify [him], for I find no fault in  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to  [our] law he ought to die, because he made himself Son of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was the rather  afraid,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;and went into the praetorium again and says to Jesus,  Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore says to him, Speakest thou not to *me*?  Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and  have authority to crucify thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, Thou hadst no authority whatever against  me if it were not given to thee from above. On this account he  that has delivered me up to thee has [the] greater sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;From this time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews  cried out saying, If thou releasest this [man], thou art not a  friend to Caesar. Every one making himself a king speaks  against Caesar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore, having heard these words, led Jesus out  and sat down upon [the] judgment-seat, at a place called  Pavement, but in Hebrew Gabbatha;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;(now it was [the] preparation of the passover; it was  about the sixth hour;) and he says to the Jews, Behold your  king!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;But they cried out, Take [him] away, take [him] away,  crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king?  The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;Then therefore he delivered him up to them, that he might  be crucified; and they took Jesus and led him away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;And he went out, bearing his cross, to the place called  [place] of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;where they crucified him, and with him two others, [one]  on this side, and [one] on that, and Jesus in the middle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross. But  there was written: Jesus the Nazaraean, the King of the Jews.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:20">19:20</A>&nbsp;This title therefore many of the Jews read, for the place  of the city where Jesus was crucified was near; and it was  written in Hebrew, Greek, Latin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:21">19:21</A>&nbsp;The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do  not write, The king of the Jews, but that *he* said, I am king  of the Jews.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:22">19:22</A>&nbsp;Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:23">19:23</A>&nbsp;The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus,  took his clothes, and made four parts, to each soldier a part,  and the body-coat; but the body-coat was seamless, woven  through the whole from the top.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:24">19:24</A>&nbsp;They said therefore to one another, Let us not rend it,  but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the  scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted my  garments among themselves, and on my vesture they cast lots.  The soldiers therefore did these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:25">19:25</A>&nbsp;And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister  of his mother, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:26">19:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple  standing by, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold  thy son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:27">19:27</A>&nbsp;Then he says unto the disciple, Behold thy mother. And  from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:28">19:28</A>&nbsp;After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now  finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I  thirst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:29">19:29</A>&nbsp;There was a vessel therefore there full of vinegar, and  having filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting hyssop round  it, they put it up to his mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:30">19:30</A>&nbsp;When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It  is finished; and having bowed his head, he delivered up his  spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:31">19:31</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain on  the cross on the sabbath, for it was [the] preparation, (for  the day of that sabbath was a great [day],) demanded of Pilate  that their legs might be broken and they taken away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:32">19:32</A>&nbsp;The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the  first and of the other that had been crucified with him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:33">19:33</A>&nbsp;but coming to Jesus, when they saw that he was already  dead they did not break his legs,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:34">19:34</A>&nbsp;but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and  immediately there came out blood and water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:35">19:35</A>&nbsp;And he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true,  and he knows that he says true that ye also may believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:36">19:36</A>&nbsp;For these things took place that the scripture might be  fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:37">19:37</A>&nbsp;And again another scripture says, They shall look on him  whom they pierced.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:38">19:38</A>&nbsp;And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a  disciple of Jesus, but secretly through fear of the Jews,  demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus: and  Pilate allowed it. He came therefore and took away the body of  Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:39">19:39</A>&nbsp;And Nicodemus also, who at first came to Jesus by night,  came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred  pounds [weight].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:40">19:40</A>&nbsp;They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it up in  linen with the spices, as it is the custom with the Jews to  prepare for burial.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:41">19:41</A>&nbsp;But there was in the place where he had been crucified a  garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever  been laid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:42">19:42</A>&nbsp;There therefore, on account of the preparation of the  Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;And on the first [day] of the week Mary of Magdala comes in  early morn to the tomb, while it was still dark, and sees the  stone taken away from the tomb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter, and to the  other disciple, to whom Jesus was attached, and says to them,  They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not  where they have laid him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and  came to the tomb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;And the two ran together, and the other disciple ran  forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying; he did  not however go in.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter therefore comes, following him, and entered  into the tomb, and sees the linen cloths lying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;and the handkerchief which was upon his head, not lying  with the linen cloths, but folded up in a distinct place by  itself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came  first to the tomb, and he saw and believed;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;for they had not yet known the scripture, that he must rise  from among [the] dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;The disciples therefore went away again to their own home.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;But Mary stood at the tomb weeping without. As therefore  she wept, she stooped down into the tomb,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;and beholds two angels sitting in white [garments], one at  the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;And they say to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She says  to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not  where they have laid him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;Having said these things she turned backward and beholds  Jesus standing [there], and knew not that it was Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? Whom seekest  thou? She, supposing that it was the gardener, says to him,  Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid  him, and I will take him away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to her, Mary. She, turning round, says to him  in Hebrew, Rabboni, which means Teacher.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:17">20:17</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to her, Touch me not, for I have not yet  ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I  ascend to my Father and your Father, and [to] my God and your  God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:18">20:18</A>&nbsp;Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that  she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had said these things to  her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:19">20:19</A>&nbsp;When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the  first [day] of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples  were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the  midst, and says to them, Peace [be] to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:20">20:20</A>&nbsp;And having said this, he shewed to them his hands and his  side. The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:21">20:21</A>&nbsp;[Jesus] said therefore again to them, Peace [be] to you:  as the Father sent me forth, I also send you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:22">20:22</A>&nbsp;And having said this, he breathed into [them], and says to  them, Receive [the] Holy Spirit:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:23">20:23</A>&nbsp;whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them;  whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:24">20:24</A>&nbsp;But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not  with them when Jesus came.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:25">20:25</A>&nbsp;The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen  the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the  mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the  nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:26">20:26</A>&nbsp;And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and  Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood  in the midst and said, Peace [be] to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:27">20:27</A>&nbsp;Then he says to Thomas, Bring thy finger here and see my  hands; and bring thy hand and put it into my side; and be not  unbelieving, but believing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:28">20:28</A>&nbsp;Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:29">20:29</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to him, Because thou hast seen me thou hast  believed: blessed they who have not seen and have believed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:30">20:30</A>&nbsp;Many other signs therefore also Jesus did before his  disciples, which are not written in this book;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:31">20:31</A>&nbsp;but these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is  the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have  life in his name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the  disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he manifested [himself]  thus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus,  and Nathanael who was of Cana of Galilee, and the [sons] of  Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter says to them, I go to fish. They say to him, We  also come with thee. They went forth, and went on board, and  that night took nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;And early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore;  the disciples however did not know that it was Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore says to them, Children, have ye anything to  eat? They answered him, No.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Cast the net at the right side of the  ship and ye will find. They cast therefore, and they could no  longer draw it, from the multitude of fishes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It  is the Lord. Simon Peter therefore, having heard that it was  the Lord, girded his overcoat [on him] (for he was naked), and  cast himself into the sea;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;and the other disciples came in the small boat, for they  were not far from the land, but somewhere about two hundred  cubits, dragging the net of fishes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;When therefore they went out on the land, they see a fire  of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to them, Bring of the fishes which ye have now  taken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter went up and drew the net to the land full of  great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were  so many, the net was not rent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to them, Come [and] dine. But none of the  disciples dared inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it  was the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and  the fish in like manner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;This is already the third time that Jesus had been  manifested to the disciples, being risen from among [the] dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;When therefore they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter,  Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He says  to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He  says to him, Feed my lambs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;He says to him again a second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas,  lovest thou me? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I  am attached to thee. He says to him, Shepherd my sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;He says to him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, art  thou attached to me? Peter was grieved because he said to him  the third time, Art thou attached to me? and said to him, Lord,  thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to  thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou  girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when  thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and  another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not  desire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;But he said this signifying by what death he should  glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, Follow me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;Peter, turning round, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved  following, who also leaned at supper on his breast, and said,  Lord, who is it that delivers thee up?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what [of] this  [man]?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come,  what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;This word therefore went out among the brethren, That  disciple does not die. And Jesus did not say to him, He does  not die; but, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is  that] to thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these  things, and who has written these things; and we know that his  witness is true.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the  which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even  the world itself would contain the books written.</p>
