<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of  the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of  your fathers?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Tell your children of it, and [let] your children [tell]  their children, and their children another generation:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;that which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten;  and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten;  and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar  eaten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of  wine, because of the new wine: for it is cut off from your  mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;For a nation is come up upon my land, strong and without  number: his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the  cheek teeth of a lioness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;He hath made my vine a desolation, and barked my fig-tree;  he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away: its branches are  made white.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of  her youth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;The oblation and the drink-offering are cut off from the  house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah's ministers, mourn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the corn is  wasted, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;Be ashamed, ye husbandmen; howl, ye vinedressers, for the  wheat and for the barley: because the harvest of the field hath  perished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;The vine is dried up, and the fig-tree languisheth; the  pomegranate-tree, the palm also and the apple-tree; all the  trees of the field are withered, yea, joy is withered away from  the children of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests; howl, ministers of  the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my  God: for the oblation and the drink-offering are withholden  from the house of your God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Hallow a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly, gather the  elders, [and] all the inhabitants of the land to the house of  Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as  destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness  from the house of our God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;The seeds are rotten under their clods, the granaries are  laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is  withered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;How do the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are  bewildered, for they have no pasture; the flocks of sheep also  are in suffering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;To thee, Jehovah, do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the  pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned up all  the trees of the field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;The beasts of the field also cry unto thee; for the  water-courses are dried, and the fire hath devoured the  pastures of the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Blow the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy  mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the  day of Jehovah cometh, for it is at hand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and gross  darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; -- a great  people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither  shall be any more after them, to the years of generations and  generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;A fire devoureth before them, and behind them a flame  burneth; the land is as a garden of Eden before them, and  behind them a desolate wilderness: yea, and nothing escapeth  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and  as horsemen, so they run.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Like the noise of chariots, on the tops of the mountains,  they leap; like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the  stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Before them the peoples are in anguish: all faces turn pale.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of  war; and they march every one on his ways, and break not their  ranks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Neither doth one press upon another; they march every one in  his path; and fall amid weapons, but are not wounded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;They spread themselves over the city; they run upon the  wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in by the  windows like a thief.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun  and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their  shining.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his  camp is very great; for strong is he that executeth his word:  for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can  bear it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn to me with all your  heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto  Jehovah your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to  anger, and of great loving-kindness, and repenteth him of the  evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Who knoweth? He might return and repent, and leave a  blessing behind him, an oblation and a drink-offering for  Jehovah your God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Blow the trumpet in Zion, hallow a fast, proclaim a solemn  assembly;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;gather the people, hallow the congregation, assemble the  elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts;  let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride  from her closet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the  porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare, O Jehovah, thy  people, and give not thine inheritance to reproach, that they  should be a byword of the nations. Wherefore should they say  among the peoples, Where is their God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;Then Jehovah will be jealous for his land, and will have  pity on his people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I  send you corn, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied  therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the  nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And I will remove far off from you him [that cometh] from  the north, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate,  his face toward the eastern sea, and his rear toward the hinder  sea; and his stench shall come up, and his ill odour shall come  up, for he hath exalted himself to do great things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;-- Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for Jehovah doeth  great things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of  the wilderness do spring; for the tree beareth its fruit; the  fig-tree and the vine yield full increase.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;And ye, children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in Jehovah  your God; for he giveth you the early rain in due measure, and  he causeth to come down for you the rain, the early rain, and  the latter rain at the beginning [of the season].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;And the floors shall be full of corn, and the vats shall  overflow with new wine and oil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath  eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the  palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise  the name of Jehovah your God, who hath dealt wondrously with  you: and my people shall never be ashamed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:27">2:27</A>&nbsp;And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and  that I, Jehovah, [am] your God, and there is none else: and my  people shall never be ashamed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:28">2:28</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass afterwards [that] I will pour out  my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters  shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men  shall see visions.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:29">2:29</A>&nbsp;Yea, even upon the bondmen and upon the handmaids in those  days will I pour out my Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:30">2:30</A>&nbsp;And I will shew wonders in the heavens and on the earth,  blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:31">2:31</A>&nbsp;The sun shall be changed to darkness, and the moon to  blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:32">2:32</A>&nbsp;And it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the name of  Jehovah shall be saved: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem  shall be deliverance, as Jehovah hath said, and for the residue  whom Jehovah shall call.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;For behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall  turn again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;I will also gather all the nations, and will bring them down  into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and I will enter into judgment  with them there on account of my people and mine inheritance,  Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they  have parted my land;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;and they have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy  for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, and have drunk [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;Yea also, what have ye to do with me, O Tyre and Zidon, and  all the districts of Philistia? Will ye render me a recompence?  But if ye recompense me, swiftly [and] speedily will I bring  your recompence upon your own head;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have  carried into your temples my beautiful pleasant things,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;and the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have  ye sold unto the children of the Greeks, that ye might remove  them far from their border.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will raise them up out of the place whither ye  have sold them, and will bring your recompence upon your own  head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand  of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the  Sabeans, to a nation far off: for Jehovah hath spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Proclaim this among the nations: prepare war, arouse the  mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your pruning-knives  into spears; let the weak say, I am strong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Haste ye and come, all ye nations round about, and gather  yourselves together. Thither cause thy mighty ones to come  down, O Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;Let the nations rouse themselves, and come up to the valley  of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations  round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you  down, for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their  wickedness is great.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the  day of Jehovah is at hand in the valley of decision.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall  withdraw their shining.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from  Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: and  Jehovah will be a shelter for his people, and the refuge of the  children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;And ye shall know that I, Jehovah, [am] your God, dwelling  in Zion, my holy mountain; and Jerusalem shall be holy, and no  strangers shall pass through her any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains  shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk,  and all the water-courses of Judah shall flow with waters; and  a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and  shall water the valley of Shittim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate  wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, in  that they have shed innocent blood in their land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;But Judah shall abide for ever, and Jerusalem from  generation to generation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;And I will purge them from the blood from which I had not  purged them: for Jehovah dwelleth in Zion.</p>
