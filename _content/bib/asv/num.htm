<p><A NAME="an_10:34">10:34</A>&nbsp;And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:35">10:35</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:36">10:36</A>&nbsp;And when it rested, he said, Return, O Jehovah, unto the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;And the people were as murmurers, [speaking] evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto Jehovah, and the fire abated.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto Jehovah, Wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is Jehovah's hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:26">11:26</A>&nbsp;But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:27">11:27</A>&nbsp;And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:28">11:28</A>&nbsp;And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:29">11:29</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah's people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:30">11:30</A>&nbsp;And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:31">11:31</A>&nbsp;And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:32">11:32</A>&nbsp;And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:33">11:33</A>&nbsp;While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:34">11:34</A>&nbsp;And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:35">11:35</A>&nbsp;From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;And they said, Hath Jehovah indeed spoken only with Moses? hath he not spoken also with us? And Jehovah heard it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men that were upon the face of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they three came out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;And he said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of Jehovah shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them; and he departed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;And the cloud removed from over the Tent; and, behold, Miriam was leprous, as [white as] snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;And Aaron said unto Moses, Oh, my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;And Miriam was shut up without the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Jehovah: all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:19">13:19</A>&nbsp;and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:20">13:20</A>&nbsp;and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; [they brought] also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:24">13:24</A>&nbsp;That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:25">13:25</A>&nbsp;And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:26">13:26</A>&nbsp;And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:27">13:27</A>&nbsp;And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:28">13:28</A>&nbsp;Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, [and] very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:29">13:29</A>&nbsp;Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:30">13:30</A>&nbsp;And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:31">13:31</A>&nbsp;But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:32">13:32</A>&nbsp;And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:33">13:33</A>&nbsp;And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;And wherefore doth Jehovah bring us unto this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;If Jehovah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou Jehovah art in the midst of this people; for thou Jehovah art seen face to face, and thy cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:18">14:18</A>&nbsp;Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:19">14:19</A>&nbsp;Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness, and according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:21">14:21</A>&nbsp;but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:22">14:22</A>&nbsp;because all those men that have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:23">14:23</A>&nbsp;surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:24">14:24</A>&nbsp;but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:25">14:25</A>&nbsp;Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:26">14:26</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:27">14:27</A>&nbsp;How long [shall I bear] with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:28">14:28</A>&nbsp;Say unto them, As I live, saith Jehovah, surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:29">14:29</A>&nbsp;your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:30">14:30</A>&nbsp;surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:31">14:31</A>&nbsp;But your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:32">14:32</A>&nbsp;But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:33">14:33</A>&nbsp;And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:34">14:34</A>&nbsp;After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:35">14:35</A>&nbsp;I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:36">14:36</A>&nbsp;And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:37">14:37</A>&nbsp;even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:38">14:38</A>&nbsp;But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:39">14:39</A>&nbsp;And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:40">14:40</A>&nbsp;And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have sinned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:41">14:41</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:42">14:42</A>&nbsp;Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:43">14:43</A>&nbsp;For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:44">14:44</A>&nbsp;But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:45">14:45</A>&nbsp;Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;and will make an offering by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill-offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor unto Jehovah, of the herd, or of the flock;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;then shall he that offereth his oblation offer unto Jehovah a meal-offering of a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;and for the drink-offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace-offerings unto Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;then shall he offer with the bullock a meal-offering of three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;and thou shalt offer for the drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;All that are home-born shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; as ye do, so he shall do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth [with you], a statute for ever throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering unto Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for a heave-offering: as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:21">15:21</A>&nbsp;Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto Jehovah a heave-offering throughout your generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;even all that Jehovah hath commanded you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah, with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin-offering before Jehovah, for their error:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat a year old for a sin-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:28">15:28</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:29">15:29</A>&nbsp;Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is home-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:30">15:30</A>&nbsp;But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemeth Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:31">15:31</A>&nbsp;Because he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:32">15:32</A>&nbsp;And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:33">15:33</A>&nbsp;And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:34">15:34</A>&nbsp;And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:35">15:35</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:36">15:36</A>&nbsp;And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:37">15:37</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:38">15:38</A>&nbsp;Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:39">15:39</A>&nbsp;and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and that ye follow not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to play the harlot;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:40">15:40</A>&nbsp;that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:41">15:41</A>&nbsp;I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took [men]:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of Jehovah?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, In the morning Jehovah will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;This do: take you censers, Korah, and all his company;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;and put fire in them, and put incense upon them before Jehovah to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah doth choose, he [shall be] holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto Korah, Hear now, ye sons of Levi:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;[seemeth it but] a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;and that he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and seek ye the priesthood also?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against Jehovah: and Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;And Moses was very wroth, and said unto Jehovah, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;and take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the congregation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:21">16:21</A>&nbsp;Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:22">16:22</A>&nbsp;And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:23">16:23</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:24">16:24</A>&nbsp;Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:25">16:25</A>&nbsp;And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:26">16:26</A>&nbsp;And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:27">16:27</A>&nbsp;So they gat them up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:28">16:28</A>&nbsp;And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah hath sent me to do all these works; for [I have] not [done them] of mine own mind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:29">16:29</A>&nbsp;If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then Jehovah hath not sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:30">16:30</A>&nbsp;But if Jehovah make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then ye shall understand that these men have despised Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:31">16:31</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:32">16:32</A>&nbsp;and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:33">16:33</A>&nbsp;So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:34">16:34</A>&nbsp;And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:35">16:35</A>&nbsp;And fire came forth from Jehovah, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:36">16:36</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:37">16:37</A>&nbsp;Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:38">16:38</A>&nbsp;even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Jehovah; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:39">16:39</A>&nbsp;And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:40">16:40</A>&nbsp;to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, that is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before Jehovah; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as Jehovah spake unto him by Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:41">16:41</A>&nbsp;But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:42">16:42</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:43">16:43</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:44">16:44</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:45">16:45</A>&nbsp;Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:46">16:46</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto Aaron, Take they censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah; the plague is begun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:47">16:47</A>&nbsp;And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:48">16:48</A>&nbsp;And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:49">16:49</A>&nbsp;Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:50">16:50</A>&nbsp;And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;And Moses spake unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;And Moses laid up the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bare ripe almonds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that thou mayest make an end of their murmurings against me, that they die not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;Thus did Moses: as Jehovah commanded him, so did he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah, dieth: shall we perish all of us?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers' house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;This shall be thine of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:18">18:18</A>&nbsp;And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:19">18:19</A>&nbsp;All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:20">18:20</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, [and] upon which never came yoke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;Whosoever toucheth a dead person, the body of a man that hath died, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;And the people strove with Moses, and spake, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;And why have ye brought the assembly of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;And Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, as he commanded him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with Jehovah, and he was sanctified in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;and when we cried unto Jehovah, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:17">20:17</A>&nbsp;Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:18">20:18</A>&nbsp;And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:19">20:19</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof: let me only, without [doing] anything [else], pass through on my feet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:20">20:20</A>&nbsp;And he said, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:21">20:21</A>&nbsp;Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:22">20:22</A>&nbsp;And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:23">20:23</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:24">20:24</A>&nbsp;Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:25">20:25</A>&nbsp;Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:26">20:26</A>&nbsp;and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered [unto his people], and shall die there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:27">20:27</A>&nbsp;And Moses did as Jehovah commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:28">20:28</A>&nbsp;And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:29">20:29</A>&nbsp;And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;And Israel vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee; pray unto Jehovah, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;From thence they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;From thence they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah, And the valleys of the Arnon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;And the slope of the valleys That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar, And leaneth upon the border of Moab.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;And from thence [they journeyed] to Beer: that is the well whereof Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;Then sang Israel this song: Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;The well, which the princes digged, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the sceptre, [and] with their staves. And from the wilderness [they journeyed] to Mattanah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed thy border.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:26">21:26</A>&nbsp;For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:27">21:27</A>&nbsp;Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come ye to Heshbon; Let the city of Sihon be built and established:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:28">21:28</A>&nbsp;For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It hath devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:29">21:29</A>&nbsp;Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: He hath given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, Unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:30">21:30</A>&nbsp;We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, And we have laid waste even unto Nophah, Which [reacheth] unto Medeba.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:31">21:31</A>&nbsp;Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:32">21:32</A>&nbsp;And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:33">21:33</A>&nbsp;And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:34">21:34</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:35">21:35</A>&nbsp;So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Jehovah shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, [saying],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land; for Jehovah refuseth to give me leave to go with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what Jehovah will speak unto me more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:21">22:21</A>&nbsp;And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:22">22:22</A>&nbsp;And God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Jehovah placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:23">22:23</A>&nbsp;And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:24">22:24</A>&nbsp;Then the angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:25">22:25</A>&nbsp;And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:26">22:26</A>&nbsp;And the angel of Jehovah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:27">22:27</A>&nbsp;And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:28">22:28</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:29">22:29</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me, I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:30">22:30</A>&nbsp;And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:31">22:31</A>&nbsp;Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:32">22:32</A>&nbsp;And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:33">22:33</A>&nbsp;and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:34">22:34</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto the angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:35">22:35</A>&nbsp;And the angel of Jehovah said unto Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:36">22:36</A>&nbsp;And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:37">22:37</A>&nbsp;And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:38">22:38</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:39">22:39</A>&nbsp;And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:40">22:40</A>&nbsp;And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:41">22:41</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: peradventure Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah putteth in my mouth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet [Jehovah] yonder.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;And he came to him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:19">23:19</A>&nbsp;God is not a man, that he should lie, Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and will he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:20">23:20</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have received [commandment] to bless: And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:21">23:21</A>&nbsp;He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: Jehovah his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:22">23:22</A>&nbsp;God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:23">23:23</A>&nbsp;Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shalt it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:24">23:24</A>&nbsp;Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:26">23:26</A>&nbsp;But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:27">23:27</A>&nbsp;And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:28">23:28</A>&nbsp;And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:29">23:29</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:30">23:30</A>&nbsp;And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:1">24:1</A>&nbsp;And when Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:2">24:2</A>&nbsp;And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:3">24:3</A>&nbsp;And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:4">24:4</A>&nbsp;He saith, who heareth the words of God, Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:5">24:5</A>&nbsp;How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, Thy tabernacles, O Israel!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:6">24:6</A>&nbsp;As valleys are they spread forth, As gardens by the river-side, As lign-aloes which Jehovah hath planted, As cedar-trees beside the waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:7">24:7</A>&nbsp;Water shall flow from his buckets, And his seed shall be in many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:8">24:8</A>&nbsp;God bringeth him forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox: He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, And shall break their bones in pieces, And smite [them] through with his arrows.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:9">24:9</A>&nbsp;He couched, he lay down as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Blessed be every one that blesseth thee, And cursed be every one that curseth thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:10">24:10</A>&nbsp;And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:11">24:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honor; but, lo, Jehovah hath kept thee back from honor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:12">24:12</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers that thou sentest unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:13">24:13</A>&nbsp;If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what Jehovah speaketh, that will I speak?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:14">24:14</A>&nbsp;And now, behold, I go unto my people: come, [and] I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:15">24:15</A>&nbsp;And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:16">24:16</A>&nbsp;He saith, who heareth the words of God, And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:17">24:17</A>&nbsp;I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh: There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, And shall smite through the corners of Moab, And break down all the sons of tumult.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:18">24:18</A>&nbsp;And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, [who were] his enemies; While Israel doeth valiantly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:19">24:19</A>&nbsp;And out of Jacob shall one have dominion, And shall destroy the remnant from the city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:20">24:20</A>&nbsp;And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; But his latter end shall come to destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:21">24:21</A>&nbsp;And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, And thy nest is set in the rock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:22">24:22</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:23">24:23</A>&nbsp;And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:24">24:24</A>&nbsp;But ships [shall come] from the coast of Kittim, And they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber; And he also shall come to destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:25">24:25</A>&nbsp;And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:1">25:1</A>&nbsp;And Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:2">25:2</A>&nbsp;for they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:3">25:3</A>&nbsp;And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:4">25:4</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up unto Jehovah before the sun, that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:5">25:5</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto Baal-peor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:6">25:6</A>&nbsp;And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:7">25:7</A>&nbsp;And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:8">25:8</A>&nbsp;and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:9">25:9</A>&nbsp;And those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:10">25:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:11">25:11</A>&nbsp;Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:12">25:12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:13">25:13</A>&nbsp;and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:14">25:14</A>&nbsp;Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:15">25:15</A>&nbsp;And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:16">25:16</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:17">25:17</A>&nbsp;Vex the Midianites, and smite them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:18">25:18</A>&nbsp;for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:1">26:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after the plague, that Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:2">26:2</A>&nbsp;Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:3">26:3</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:62">26:62</A>&nbsp;And they that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, every male from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_27:12">27:12</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, and behold the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_31:18">31:18</A>&nbsp;But all the women-children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:19">31:19</A>&nbsp;And encamp ye without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:20">31:20</A>&nbsp;And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' [hair], and all things made of wood, ye shall purify yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:21">31:21</A>&nbsp;And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:22">31:22</A>&nbsp;howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:23">31:23</A>&nbsp;everything that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:24">31:24</A>&nbsp;And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterward ye shall come into the camp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:25">31:25</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:26">31:26</A>&nbsp;Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the congregation;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:27">31:27</A>&nbsp;and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:28">31:28</A>&nbsp;And levy a tribute unto Jehovah of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, [both] of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the flocks:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:29">31:29</A>&nbsp;take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for Jehovah's heave-offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:30">31:30</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, [even] of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:31">31:31</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:32">31:32</A>&nbsp;Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:33">31:33</A>&nbsp;and threescore and twelve thousand oxen,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:34">31:34</A>&nbsp;and threescore and one thousand asses,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:35">31:35</A>&nbsp;and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:36">31:36</A>&nbsp;And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:37">31:37</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:38">31:38</A>&nbsp;And the oxen were thirty and six thousand; of which Jehovah's tribute was threescore and twelve.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:39">31:39</A>&nbsp;And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which Jehovah's tribute was threescore and one.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_31:43">31:43</A>&nbsp;(now the congregation's half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:44">31:44</A>&nbsp;and thirty and six thousand oxen,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:45">31:45</A>&nbsp;and thirty thousand and five hundred asses,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_31:47">31:47</A>&nbsp;even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:48">31:48</A>&nbsp;And the officers that were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:49">31:49</A>&nbsp;and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:50">31:50</A>&nbsp;And we have brought Jehovah's oblation, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:51">31:51</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:52">31:52</A>&nbsp;And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to Jehovah, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:53">31:53</A>&nbsp;([For] the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:54">31:54</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A>&nbsp;the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A>&nbsp;Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;the land which Jehovah smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle; and thy servants have cattle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;And they said, If we have found favor in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession; bring us not over the Jordan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:7">32:7</A>&nbsp;And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah hath given them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:8">32:8</A>&nbsp;Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Jehovah had given them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:10">32:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah's anger was kindled in that day, and he sware, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:11">32:11</A>&nbsp;Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:12">32:12</A>&nbsp;save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:13">32:13</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of Jehovah, was consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:14">32:14</A>&nbsp;And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Jehovah toward Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:15">32:15</A>&nbsp;For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye will destroy all this people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:16">32:16</A>&nbsp;And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:17">32:17</A>&nbsp;but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:18">32:18</A>&nbsp;We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:19">32:19</A>&nbsp;For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:20">32:20</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves to go before Jehovah to the war,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:21">32:21</A>&nbsp;and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:22">32:22</A>&nbsp;and the land is subdued before Jehovah; then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards Jehovah, and towards Israel; and this land shall be unto you for a possession before Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:23">32:23</A>&nbsp;But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against Jehovah; and be sure your sin will find you out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:24">32:24</A>&nbsp;Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:25">32:25</A>&nbsp;And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:26">32:26</A>&nbsp;Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:27">32:27</A>&nbsp;but thy servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, as my lord saith.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:28">32:28</A>&nbsp;So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:29">32:29</A>&nbsp;And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before Jehovah, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:30">32:30</A>&nbsp;but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:31">32:31</A>&nbsp;And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:32">32:32</A>&nbsp;We will pass over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance [shall remain] with us beyond the Jordan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:33">32:33</A>&nbsp;And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities thereof with [their] borders, even the cities of the land round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:34">32:34</A>&nbsp;And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:35">32:35</A>&nbsp;and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:36">32:36</A>&nbsp;and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:37">32:37</A>&nbsp;And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:38">32:38</A>&nbsp;and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and they gave other names unto the cities which they builded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:39">32:39</A>&nbsp;And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were therein.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:40">32:40</A>&nbsp;And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:41">32:41</A>&nbsp;And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns thereof, and called them Havvoth-jair.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:42">32:42</A>&nbsp;And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:1">33:1</A>&nbsp;These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:2">33:2</A>&nbsp;And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Jehovah: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:3">33:3</A>&nbsp;And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:4">33:4</A>&nbsp;while the Egyptians were burying all their first-born, whom Jehovah had smitten among them: upon their gods also Jehovah executed judgments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:5">33:5</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A>&nbsp;and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A>&nbsp;and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:13">34:13</A>&nbsp;And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which Jehovah hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:14">34:14</A>&nbsp;for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:15">34:15</A>&nbsp;the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:16">34:16</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:17">34:17</A>&nbsp;These are the names of the men that shall divide the land unto you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:18">34:18</A>&nbsp;And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:19">34:19</A>&nbsp;And these are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:20">34:20</A>&nbsp;And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:21">34:21</A>&nbsp;Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:29">34:29</A>&nbsp;These are they whom Jehovah commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:1">35:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:2">35:2</A>&nbsp;Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:3">35:3</A>&nbsp;And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:4">35:4</A>&nbsp;And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:5">35:5</A>&nbsp;And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:6">35:6</A>&nbsp;And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee unto: and besides them ye shall give forty and two cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:7">35:7</A>&nbsp;All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities; them [shall ye give] with their suburbs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:8">35:8</A>&nbsp;And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the Levites.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:9">35:9</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:10">35:10</A>&nbsp;Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:11">35:11</A>&nbsp;then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:12">35:12</A>&nbsp;And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:13">35:13</A>&nbsp;And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:14">35:14</A>&nbsp;Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:15">35:15</A>&nbsp;For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:16">35:16</A>&nbsp;But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:17">35:17</A>&nbsp;And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:18">35:18</A>&nbsp;Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:19">35:19</A>&nbsp;The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:20">35:20</A>&nbsp;And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:21">35:21</A>&nbsp;or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meeteth him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:22">35:22</A>&nbsp;But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:23">35:23</A>&nbsp;or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:24">35:24</A>&nbsp;then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:25">35:25</A>&nbsp;and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:26">35:26</A>&nbsp;But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:27">35:27</A>&nbsp;and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:28">35:28</A>&nbsp;because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:29">35:29</A>&nbsp;And these things shall be for a statute [and] ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:30">35:30</A>&nbsp;Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:31">35:31</A>&nbsp;Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:32">35:32</A>&nbsp;And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:33">35:33</A>&nbsp;So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:34">35:34</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Jehovah, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:1">36:1</A>&nbsp;And the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the children of Israel:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:2">36:2</A>&nbsp;and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:3">36:3</A>&nbsp;And if they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:4">36:4</A>&nbsp;And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:5">36:5</A>&nbsp;And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:6">36:6</A>&nbsp;This is the thing which Jehovah doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:7">36:7</A>&nbsp;So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:8">36:8</A>&nbsp;And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:9">36:9</A>&nbsp;So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave every one to his own inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:10">36:10</A>&nbsp;Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:11">36:11</A>&nbsp;for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:12">36:12</A>&nbsp;They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:13">36:13</A>&nbsp;These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded by Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. </p>
