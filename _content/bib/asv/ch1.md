Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah-

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> these mentioned by name were princes in
their families: and their fathers' houses increased greatly.

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> And they went to the entrance of Gedor,
even unto the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> And they found fat pasture and good, and
the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for they that dwelt there
aforetime were of Ham.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> And these written by name came in the
days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the Meunim
that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and
dwelt in their stead; because there was pasture there for their flocks.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> And some of them, even of the sons of
Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains
Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> And they smote the remnant of the
Amalekites that escaped, and have dwelt there unto this day.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And the sons of Reuben the first-born of
Israel (for he was the first-born; but, forasmuch as he defiled his
father's couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son
of Israel; and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and
of him came the prince; but the birthright was Joseph's:)

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> the sons of Reuben the first-born of
Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> The sons of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his

son,

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Beerah his son, whom Tilgath-pilneser king
of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And his brethren by their families, when
the genealogy of their generations was reckoned: the chief, Jeiel, and
Zechariah,

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema,
the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baal-meon:

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> and eastward he dwelt even unto the
entrance of the wilderness from the river Euphrates, because their
cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And in the days of Saul, they made war
with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand; and they dwelt in their tents
throughout all the \[land\] east of Gilead.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And the sons of Gad dwelt over against
them, in the land of Bashan unto Salecah:

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Joel the chief, and Shapham the second,
and Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And their brethren of their fathers'
houses: Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jacan, and
Zia, and Eber, seven.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> These were the sons of Abihail, the son
of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the
son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni,
chief of their fathers' houses.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and
in its towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, as far as their borders.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> All these were reckoned by genealogies in
the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of
Israel.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and
the half-tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and
sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were forty and four
thousand seven hundred and threescore, that were able to go forth to
war.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> And they made war with the Hagrites, with
Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> And they were helped against them, and
the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with
them; for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them,
because they put their trust in him.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> And they took away their cattle; of their
camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and
of asses two thousand, and of men a hundred thousand.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> For there fell many slain, because the
war was of God. And they dwelt in their stead until the captivity.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And the children of the half-tribe of
Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto Baal-hermon
and Senir and mount Hermon.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> And these were the heads of their
fathers' houses: even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and
Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men,
heads of their fathers' houses.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> And they trespassed against the God of
their fathers, and played the harlot after the gods of the peoples of
the land, whom God destroyed before them.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> And the God of Israel stirred up the
spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king
of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the
Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah,
and Habor, and Hara, and to the river of Gozan, unto this day.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And Benjamin begat Bela his first-born,
Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third,

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And Bela had sons: Addar, and Gera, and
Abihud,

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> and Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah,

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> and Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> And these are the sons of Ehud: these are
the heads of fathers' \[houses\] of the inhabitants of Geba, and they
carried them captive to Manahath:

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> and Naaman, and Ahijah, and Gera, he
carried them captive: and he begat Uzza and Ahihud.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> And Shaharaim begat children in the field
of Moab, after he had sent them away; Hushim and Baara were his wives.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and
Zibia, and Mesha, and Malcam,

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> and Jeuz, and Shachia, and Mirmah. These
were his sons, heads of fathers' \[houses\].

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And of Hushim he begat Abitub and Elpaal.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And the sons of Elpaal: Eber, and Misham,
and Shemed, who built Ono and Lod, with the towns thereof;

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> and Beriah, and Shema, who were heads of
fathers' \[houses\] of the inhabitants of Aijalon, who put to flight the
inhabitants of Gath;

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> and Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth,

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> and Zebadiah, and Arad, and Eder,

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> and Michael, and Ishpah, and Joha, the
sons of Beriah,

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> and Zebadiah, and Meshullam, and Hizki,
and Heber,

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> and Ishmerai, and Izliah, and Jobab, the
sons of Elpaal,

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> and Jakim, and Zichri, and Zabdi,

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> and Elienai, and Zillethai, and Eliel,

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> and Adaiah, and Beraiah, and Shimrath,
the sons of Shimei,

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> and Ishpan, and Eber, and Eliel,

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> and Abdon, and Zichri, and Hanan,

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> and Hananiah, and Elam, and Anthothijah,

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> and Iphdeiah, and Penuel, the sons of
Shashak,

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> and Shamsherai, and Shehariah, and
Athaliah,

<span id="an_8:27">8:27</span> and Jaareshiah, and Elijah, and Zichri,
the sons of Jeroham.

<span id="an_8:28">8:28</span> These were heads of fathers' \[houses\]
throughout their generations, chief men: these dwelt in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And in Gibeon there dwelt the father of
Gibeon, \[Jeiel\], whose wife's name was Maacah;

<span id="an_8:30">8:30</span> and his first-born son Abdon, and Zur,
and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab,

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zecher.

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And Mikloth begat Shimeah. And they also
dwelt with their brethren in Jerusalem, over against their brethren.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul;
and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal;
and Merib-baal begat Micah.

<span id="an_8:35">8:35</span> And the sons of Micah: Pithon, and
Melech, and Tarea, and Ahaz.

<span id="an_8:36">8:36</span> And Ahaz begat Jehoaddah; and Jehoaddah
begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza.

<span id="an_8:37">8:37</span> And Moza begat Binea; Raphah was his son,
Eleasah his son, Azel his son.

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> And Azel had six sons, whose names are
these: Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and
Hanan. All these were the sons of Azel.

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> And the sons of Eshek his brother: Ulam
his first-born, Jeush the second, and Eliphelet the third.

<span id="an_8:40">8:40</span> And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of
valor, archers, and had many sons, and sons' sons, a hundred and fifty.
All these were of the sons of Benjamin.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies;
and, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel: and
Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their transgression.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in
their possessions in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites,
and the Nethinim.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of
Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim
and Manasseh:

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri,
the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of
Judah.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And of the Shilonites: Asaiah the
first-born, and his sons.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel, and their
brethren, six hundred and ninety.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> And of the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son
of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah,

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> and Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah
the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah,
the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> and their brethren, according to their
generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men were heads of
fathers' \[houses\] by their fathers' houses.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And of the priests: Jedaiah, and
Jehoiarib, Jachin,

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> and Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son
of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub,
the ruler of the house of God;

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of
Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasai the son of Adiel, the son of
Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of
Immer;

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> and their brethren, heads of their
fathers' houses, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able
men for the work of the service of the house of God.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of
Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of
Merari;

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> and Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and
Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph,

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son
of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of
Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And the porters: Shallum, and Akkub, and
Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren (Shallum was the chief),

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> who hitherto \[waited\] in the king's
gate eastward: they were the porters for the camp of the children of
Levi.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of
Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of his father's house, the
Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds
of the tent: and their fathers had been over the camp of Jehovah,
keepers of the entry.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler
over them in time past, \[and\] Jehovah was with him.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was
porter of the door of the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> All these that were chosen to be porters
in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by
genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain
in their office of trust.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> So they and their children had the
oversight of the gates of the house of Jehovah, even the house of the
tent, by wards.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> On the four sides were the porters,
toward the east, west, north, and south.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And their brethren, in their villages,
were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them:

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> for the four chief porters, who were
Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the chambers and over
the treasuries in the house of God.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And they lodged round about the house of
God, because the charge \[thereof\] was upon them; and to them pertained
the opening thereof morning by morning.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And certain of them had charge of the
vessels of service; for by count were these brought in and by count were
these taken out.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> Some of them also were appointed over the
furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over the fine
flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And some of the sons of the priests
prepared the confection of the spices.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who
was the first-born of Shallum the Korahite, had the office of trust over
the things that were baked in pans.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> And some of their brethren, of the sons
of the Kohathites, were over the showbread, to prepare it every sabbath.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> And these are the singers, heads of
fathers' \[houses\] of the Levites, \[who dwelt\] in the chambers \[and
were\] free \[from other service\]; for they were employed in their work
day and night.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> These were heads of fathers' \[houses\]
of the Levites, throughout their generations, chief men: these dwelt at
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> And in Gibeon there dwelt the father of
Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife's name was Maacah:

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> and his first-born son Abdon, and Zur,
and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and
Mikloth.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also
dwelt with their brethren in Jerusalem, over against their brethren.

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul;
and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal;
and Merib-baal begat Micah.

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> And the sons of Micah: Pithon, and
Melech, and Tahrea, \[and Ahaz\].

<span id="an_9:42">9:42</span> And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat
Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;

<span id="an_9:43">9:43</span> and Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his
son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.

<span id="an_9:44">9:44</span> And Azel had six sons, whose names are
these: Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and
Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now the Philistines fought against
Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell
down slain in mount Gilboa.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And the Philistines followed hard after
Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and
Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And the battle went sore against Saul,
and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the
archers.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer,
Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these
uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he
was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul
was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> So Saul died, and his three sons; and all
his house died together.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And when all the men of Israel that were
in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt
in them.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, when
the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his
sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And they stripped him, and took his head,
and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to
carry the tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And they put his armor in the house of
their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all
that the Philistines had done to Saul,

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> all the valiant men arose, and took
away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to
Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven
days.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> So Saul died for his trespass which he
committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah, which he kept
not; and also for that he asked counsel of one that had a familiar
spirit, to inquire \[thereby\],

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> and inquired not of Jehovah: therefore
he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Then all Israel gathered themselves to
David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> In times past, even when Saul was king,
it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah thy
God said unto thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou
shalt be prince over my people Israel.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> So all the elders of Israel came to the
king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before
Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word
of Jehovah by Samuel.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And David and all Israel went to
Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the
land, were there.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to
David, Thou shalt not come in hither. Nevertheless David took the
stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And David said, Whosoever smiteth the
Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah
went up first, and was made chief.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And David dwelt in the stronghold;
therefore they called it the city of David.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And he built the city round about, from
Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And David waxed greater and greater; for
Jehovah of hosts was with him.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> Now these are the chief of the mighty
men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his
kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the
word of Jehovah concerning Israel.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And this is the number of the mighty
men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the
thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at
one time.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And after him was Eleazar the son of
Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> He was with David at Pasdammim, and
there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot
of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the
Philistines.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> And they stood in the midst of the
plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah saved them
by a great victory.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And three of the thirty chief men went
down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the
Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And David was then in the stronghold,
and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And David longed, and said, Oh that one
would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the
gate!

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And the three brake through the host of
the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was
by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not
drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah,

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> and said, My God forbid it me, that I
should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their
lives in jeopardy? for with \[the jeopardy of\] their lives they brought
it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty
men.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he
was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred
and slew them, and had a name among the three.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> Of the three, he was more honorable
than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the
\[first\] three.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of
a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two
\[sons of\] Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the
midst of a pit in time of snow.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great
stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a
weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the
spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> These things did Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> Behold, he was more honorable than the
thirty, but he attained not to the \[first\] three: and David set him
over his guard.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> Also the mighty men of the armies:
Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the
Pelonite,

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite,
Eliphal the son of Ur,

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the
Pelonite,

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of
Ezbai,

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the
son of Hagri,

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the
Berothite, the armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of
Ahlai,

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a
chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,

<span id="an_11:43">11:43</span> Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat
the Mithnite,

<span id="an_11:44">11:44</span> Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel
the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,

<span id="an_11:45">11:45</span> Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his
brother, the Tizite,

<span id="an_11:46">11:46</span> Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and
Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

<span id="an_11:47">11:47</span> Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the
Mezobaite.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Now these are they that came to David to
Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish;
and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in war.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> They were armed with bows, and could use
both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting
arrows from the bow: they were of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the
sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of
Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man
among the thirty, and over the thirty, and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and
Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite,

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and

Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites,

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of
Jeroham of Gedor.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> And of the Gadites there separated
themselves unto David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of
valor, men trained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose
faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes
upon the mountains;

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab
the third,

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the
fifth,

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the
eleventh.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> These of the sons of Gad were captains
of the host: he that was least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest
to a thousand.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> These are they that went over the
Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and
they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and
toward the west.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And there came of the children of
Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold unto David.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> And David went out to meet them, and
answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me,
my heart shall be knit unto you; but if \[ye be come\] to betray me to
mine adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our
fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who
was chief of the thirty, \[and he said\], Thine are we, David, and on
thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to
thy helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and
made them captains of the band.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> Of Manasseh also there fell away some
to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but
they helped them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement
sent him away, saying, He will fall away to his master Saul to the
jeopardy of our heads.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him
of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad,
and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> And they helped David against the band
of rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in
the host.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> For from day to day men came to David
to help him, until there was a great host, like the host of God.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> And these are the numbers of the heads
of them that were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn
the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Jehovah.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> The children of Judah that bare shield
and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Of the children of Simeon, mighty men
of valor for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> Of the children of Levi four thousand
and six hundred.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> And Jehoiada was the leader of \[the
house of\] Aaron; and with him were three thousand and seven hundred,

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor,
and of his father's house twenty and two captains.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> And of the children of Benjamin, the
brethren of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them
had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> And of the children of Ephraim twenty
thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their
fathers' houses.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> And of the half-tribe of Manasseh
eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David
king.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> And of the children of Issachar, men
that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do,
the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their
commandment.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out
in the host, that could set the battle in array, with all manner of
instruments of war, fifty thousand, and that could order \[the battle
array, and were\] not of double heart.

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> And of Naphtali a thousand captains,
and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> And of the Danites that could set the
battle in array, twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> And of Asher, such as were able to go
out in the host, that could set the battle in array, forty thousand.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> And on the other side of the Jordan, of
the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with
all manner of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty
thousand.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> All these being men of war, that could
order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make
David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one
heart to make David king.

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> And they were there with David three
days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had made preparation for
them.

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> Moreover they that were nigh unto them,
\[even\] as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on
asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, victuals of meal, cakes
of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep
in abundance: for there was joy in Israel.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> And David consulted with the captains of
thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And David said unto all the assembly of
Israel, If it seem good unto you, and if it be of Jehovah our God, let
us send abroad every where unto our brethren that are left in all the
land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities
that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us;

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> and let us bring again the ark of our God
to us: for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And all the assembly said that they would
do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> So David assembled all Israel together,
from the Shihor \[the brook\] of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath,
to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> And David went up, and all Israel, to
Baalah, \[that is\], to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to
bring up from thence the ark of God Jehovah that sitteth \[above\] the
cherubim, that is called by the Name.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> And they carried the ark of God upon a
new cart, \[and brought it\] out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and
Ahio drove the cart.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> And David and all Israel played before
God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with
psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> And when they came unto the
threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for
the oxen stumbled.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled
against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put forth his hand to the
ark; and there he died before God.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And David was displeased, because
Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzza; and he called that place Perez-uzza,
unto this day.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And David was afraid of God that day,
saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> So David removed not the ark unto him
into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom
the Gittite.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> And the ark of God remained with the
family of Obed-edom in his house three months: and Jehovah blessed the
house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to
David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a
house.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And David perceived that Jehovah had
established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high,
for his people Israel's sake.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And David took more wives at Jerusalem;
and David begat more sons and daughters.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> And these are the names of the children
whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> and Elishama, and Beeliada, and
Eliphelet.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And when the Philistines heard that David
was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek
David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Now the Philistines had come and made a
raid in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> And David inquired of God, saying,
Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into
my hand? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into
thy hand.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> So they came up to Baal-perazim, and
David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by
my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of
that place Baal-perazim.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> And they left their gods there; and
David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And the Philistines yet again made a
raid in the valley.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And David inquired again of God; and
God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them,
and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And it shall be, when thou hearest the
sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou
shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the
host of the Philistines.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> And David did as God commanded him: and
they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And the fame of David went out into all
lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And \[David\] made him houses in the city
of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it
a tent.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Then David said, None ought to carry the
ark of God but the Levites: for them hath Jehovah chosen to carry the
ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And David assembled all Israel at
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah unto its place, which he had
prepared for it.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> And David gathered together the sons of
Aaron, and the Levites:

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief,
and his brethren a hundred and twenty;

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief,
and his brethren two hundred and twenty;

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief,
and his brethren a hundred and thirty;

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the
chief, and his brethren two hundred;

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief,
and his brethren fourscore;

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the
chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And David called for Zadok and Abiathar
the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah,
and Eliel, and Amminadab,

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> and said unto them, Ye are the heads of
the fathers' \[houses\] of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and
your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of
Israel, unto \[the place\] that I have prepared for it.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> For because ye \[bare it\] not at the
first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not
according to the ordinance.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> So the priests and the Levites
sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And the children of the Levites bare
the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses
commanded according to the word of Jehovah.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And David spake to the chief of the
Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of
music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up
the voice with joy.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> So the Levites appointed Heman the son
of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the
sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> and with them their brethren of the
second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel,
and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and
Ethan, \[were appointed\] with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> and Zechariah, and Aziel, and
Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah,
with psalteries set to Alamoth;

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and
Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the
Sheminith, to lead.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites,
was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> And Berechiah and Elkanah were
doorkeepers for the ark.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and
Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the
priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and
Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> So David, and the elders of Israel, and
the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of
Jehovah out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> And it came to pass, when God helped
the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they
sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> And David was clothed with a robe of
fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and
Chenaniah the master of the song \[with\] the singers: and David had
upon him an ephod of linen.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> Thus all Israel brought up the ark of
the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and
with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and
harps.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> And it came to pass, as the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter
of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and
playing; and she despised him in her heart.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> And they brought in the ark of God, and
set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they
offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> And when David had made an end of
offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the
people in the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both
man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion \[of flesh\],
and a cake of raisins.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And he appointed certain of the Levites
to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and
praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Asaph the chief, and second to him
Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and
Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with
harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with
trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> Then on that day did David first ordain
to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his
name; Make known his doings among the peoples.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Sing unto him, sing praises unto him;
Talk ye of all his marvellous works.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Glory ye in his holy name; Let the
heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek
his face evermore.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Remember his marvellous works that he
hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> O ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye
children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He is Jehovah our God; His judgments
are in all the earth.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> Remember his covenant for ever, The
word which he commanded to a thousand generations,

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> \[The covenant\] which he made with
Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a
statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land
of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> When ye were but a few men in number,
Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And they went about from nation to
nation, And from one kingdom to another people.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> He suffered no man to do them wrong;
Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> \[Saying\], Touch not mine anointed
ones, And do my prophets no harm.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Show
forth his salvation from day to day.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Declare his glory among the nations,
His marvellous works among all the peoples.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be
praised: He also is to be feared above all gods.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> For all the gods of the peoples are
idols: But Jehovah made the heavens.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> Honor and majesty are before him:
Strength and gladness are in his place.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of
the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength;

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto
his name: Bring an offering, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in
holy array.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> Tremble before him, all the earth: The
world also is established that it cannot be moved.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> Let the heavens be glad, and let the
earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth.

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness
thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein;

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> Then shall the trees of the wood sing
for joy before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth.

<span id="an_16:34">16:34</span> O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is
good; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_16:35">16:35</span> And say ye, Save us, O God of our
salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To
give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.

<span id="an_16:36">16:36</span> Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,
From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and
praised Jehovah.

<span id="an_16:37">16:37</span> So he left there, before the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark
continually, as every day's work required;

<span id="an_16:38">16:38</span> and Obed-edom with their brethren,
threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be
doorkeepers;

<span id="an_16:39">16:39</span> and Zadok the priest, and his brethren
the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was
at Gibeon,

<span id="an_16:40">16:40</span> to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah
upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even
according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he
commanded unto Israel;

<span id="an_16:41">16:41</span> and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and
the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to
Jehovah, because his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_16:42">16:42</span> and with them Heman and Jeduthun
\[with\] trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and
\[with\] instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to
be at the gate.

<span id="an_16:43">16:43</span> And all the people departed every man
to his house: and David returned to bless his house.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And it came to pass, when David dwelt in
his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house
of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah \[dwelleth\] under
curtains.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> And Nathan said unto David, Do all that
is in thy heart; for God is with thee.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And it came to pass the same night, that
the word of God came to Nathan, saying,

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith
Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> for I have not dwelt in a house since the
day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to
tent, and from \[one\] tabernacle \[to another\].

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> In all places wherein I have walked with
all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I
commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me
a house of cedar?

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my
servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the
sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over
my people Israel:

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> and I have been with thee whithersoever
thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and
I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are
in the earth.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And I will appoint a place for my people
Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and
be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them
any more, as at the first,

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> and \[as\] from the day that I
commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all
thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a
house.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And it shall come to pass, when thy
days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will
set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will
establish his kingdom.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> He shall build me a house, and I will
establish his throne for ever.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> I will be his father, and he shall be
my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took
it from him that was before thee;

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> but I will settle him in my house and
in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> According to all these words, and
according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> Then David the king went in, and sat
before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my
house, that thou hast brought me thus far?

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And this was a small thing in thine
eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great
while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of
high degree, O Jehovah God.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> What can David \[say\] yet more unto
thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest
thy servant.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> O Jehovah, for thy servant's sake, and
according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to
make known all \[these\] great things.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> O Jehovah, there is none like thee,
neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have
heard with our ears.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> And what one nation in the earth is
like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a
people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out
nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt?

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> For thy people Israel didst thou make
thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> And now, O Jehovah, let the word that
thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be
established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> And let thy name be established and
magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even
a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established
before thee.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> For thou, O my God, hast revealed to
thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant
found \[in his heart\] to pray before thee.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and
hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> and now it hath pleased thee to bless
the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for
thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And after this it came to pass, that
David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its
towns out of the hand of the Philistines.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And he smote Moab; and the Moabites
became servants to David, and brought tribute.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah
unto Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river
Euphrates.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> And David took from him a thousand
chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and
David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred
chariots.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And when the Syrians of Damascus came to
succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and
twenty thousand men.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> Then David put \[garrisons\] in Syria of
Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute.
And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And David took the shields of gold that
were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of
Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen
sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> And when Tou king of Hamath heard that
David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah,

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> he sent Hadoram his son to king David,
to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer
and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou;) and \[he had with
him\] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> These also did king David dedicate unto
Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the
nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and
from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah
smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And he put garrisons in Edom; and all
the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David
whithersoever he went.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> And David reigned over all Israel; and
he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over
the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and
Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was
over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were
chief about the king.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And it came to pass after this, that
Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in
his stead.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And David said, I will show kindness unto
Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So
David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's
servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to
comfort him.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> But the princes of the children of Ammon
said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that
he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee
to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> So Hanun took David's servants, and
shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their
buttocks, and sent them away.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> Then there went certain persons, and told
David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men
were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your
beards be grown, and then return.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that
they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of
Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and
horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> So they hired them thirty and two
thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and
encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves
together from their cities, and came to battle.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> And when David heard of it, he sent Joab,
and all the host of the mighty men.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And the children of Ammon came out, and
put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings that were
come were by themselves in the field.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> Now when Joab saw that the battle was
set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of
Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> And the rest of the people he committed
into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array
against the children of Ammon.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> And he said, If the Syrians be too
strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be
too strong for thee, then I will help thee.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Be of good courage, and let us play the
man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that
which seemeth him good.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> So Joab and the people that were with
him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before
him.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that
the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother,
and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> And when the Syrians saw that they were
put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the
Syrians that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the
host of Hadarezer at their head.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And it was told David; and he gathered
all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and
set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle
in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> And the Syrians fled before Israel; and
David slew of the Syrians \[the men of\] seven thousand chariots, and
forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> And when the servants of Hadarezer saw
that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with
David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of
Ammon any more.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And it came to pass, at the time of the
return of the year, at the time when kings go out \[to battle\], that
Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of
Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And
Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And David took the crown of their king
from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there
were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he
brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And he brought forth the people that were
therein, and cut \[them\] with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with
axes. And thus did David unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.
And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And it came to pass after this, that
there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the
Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And there was again war with the
Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of
Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And there was again war at Gath, where
was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty,
six \[on each hand\], and six \[on each foot\]; and he also was born
unto the giant.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the
son of Shimea David's brother slew him.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> These were born unto the giant in Gath;
and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And Satan stood up against Israel, and
moved David to number Israel.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And David said to Joab and to the princes
of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring
me word, that I may know the sum of them.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a
hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not
all my lord's servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he
be a cause of guilt unto Israel?

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> Nevertheless the king's word prevailed
against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel,
and came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering
of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand
thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four
hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> But Levi and Benjamin counted he not
among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> And God was displeased with this thing;
therefore he smote Israel.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And David said unto God, I have sinned
greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beseech
thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> And Jehovah spake unto Gad, David's seer,
saying,

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus
saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that
I may do it unto thee.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> So Gad came to David, and said unto
him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt:

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> either three years of famine; or three
months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies
overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even
pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout
all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall
return to him that sent me.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And David said unto Gad, I am in a
great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very
great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon
Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to
destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he
repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is
enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the
threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> And David lifted up his eyes, and saw
the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn
sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the
elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> And David said unto God, Is it not I
that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned
and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy
hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my
father's house; but not against thy people, that they should be plagued.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad
to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah
in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> And David went up at the saying of Gad,
which he spake in the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> And Ornan turned back, and saw the
angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan
was threshing wheat.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And as David came to Ornan, Ornan
looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed
himself to David with his face to the ground.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> Then David said to Ornan, Give me the
place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto
Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may
be stayed from the people.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And Ornan said unto David, Take it to
thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I
give \[thee\] the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing
instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it
all.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but
I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which
is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> So David gave to Ornan for the place
six hundred shekels of gold by weight.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> And David built there an altar unto
Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called
upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of
burnt-offering.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he
put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> At that time, when David saw that
Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite,
then he sacrificed there.

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which
Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at
that time in the high place at Gibeon.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> But David could not go before it to
inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Then David said, This is the house of
Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> And David commanded to gather together
the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew
wrought stones to build the house of God.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And David prepared iron in abundance for
the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass
in abundance without weight;

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> and cedar-trees without number: for the
Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> And David said, Solomon my son is young
and tender, and the house that is to be builded for Jehovah must be
exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I
will therefore make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly
before his death.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> Then he called for Solomon his son, and
charged him to build a house for Jehovah, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> And David said to Solomon his son, As for
me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> But the word of Jehovah came to me,
saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou
shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood
upon the earth in my sight.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who
shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies
round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and
quietness unto Israel in his days:

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> he shall build a house for my name; and
he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the
throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee; and
prosper thou, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken
concerning thee.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> Only Jehovah give thee discretion and
understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel; that so thou
mayest keep the law of Jehovah thy God.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> Then shalt thou prosper, if thou
observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Jehovah charged
Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; fear not,
neither be dismayed.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> Now, behold, in my affliction I have
prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold,
and a thousand thousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without
weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared;
and thou mayest add thereto.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> Moreover there are workmen with thee in
abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are
skilful in every manner of work:

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> of the gold, the silver, and the brass,
and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and Jehovah be
with thee.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> David also commanded all the princes of
Israel to help Solomon his son, \[saying\],

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> Is not Jehovah your God with you? and
hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath delivered the
inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before
Jehovah, and before his people.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> Now set your heart and your soul to
seek after Jehovah your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary
of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the
holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> Now David was old and full of days; and
he made Solomon his son king over Israel.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And he gathered together all the princes
of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> And the Levites were numbered from thirty
years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was
thirty and eight thousand.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Of these, twenty and four thousand were
to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were
officers and judges;

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> and four thousand were doorkeepers; and
four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, \[said
David\], to praise therewith.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> And David divided them into courses
according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and
Zetham, and Joel, three.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and
Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers'
\[houses\] of Ladan.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina,
and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the
second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a
fathers' house in one reckoning.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar,
Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and
Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he
and his sons, for ever, to burn incense before Jehovah, to minister unto
him, and to bless in his name, for ever.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> But as for Moses the man of God, his
sons were named among the tribe of Levi.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah
the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were
very many.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief,
Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief,
and Isshiah the second.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but
daughters only: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them \[to
wife\].

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and
Jeremoth, three.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> These were the sons of Levi after their
fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers' \[houses\] of those of
them that were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did
the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from twenty years old
and upward.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> For David said, Jehovah, the God of
Israel, hath given rest unto his people; and he dwelleth in Jerusalem
for ever:

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> and also the Levites shall no more have
need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service
thereof.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> For by the last words of David the sons
of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> For their office was to wait on the
sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts,
and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the
work of the service of the house of God;

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> for the showbread also, and for the
fine flour for a meal-offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that
which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all
manner of measure and size;

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> and to stand every morning to thank and
praise Jehovah, and likewise at even;

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> and to offer all burnt-offerings unto
Jehovah, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in
number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before
Jehovah;

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> and that they should keep the charge of
the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of
the sons of Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> And the courses of the sons of Aaron
\[were these\]. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> But Nadab and Abihu died before their
father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the
priest's office.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And David with Zadok of the sons of
Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to
their ordering in their service.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And there were more chief men found of
the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and \[thus\] were they
divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers'
houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers' houses,
eight.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> Thus were they divided by lot, one sort
with another; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of
God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the
scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king,
and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of
Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers' \[houses\] of the priests and of
the Levites; one fathers' house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken
for Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Now the first lot came forth to
Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to
Mijamin,

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to
Abijah,

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to
Shecaniah,

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth
to Jakim,

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> the thirteenth to Huppah, the
fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth
to Immer,

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> the seventeenth to Hezir, the
eighteenth to Happizzez,

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the
twentieth to Jehezkel,

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> the one and twentieth to Jachin, the
two and twentieth to Gamul,

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> the three and twentieth to Delaiah, the
four and twentieth to Maaziah.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> This was the ordering of them in their
service, to come into the house of Jehovah according to the ordinance
\[given\] unto them by Aaron their father, as Jehovah, the God of
Israel, had commanded him.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of
the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah,
Isshiah the chief.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the
sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> And the sons \[of Hebron\]: Jeriah
\[the chief\], Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the
fourth.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons
of Micah, Shamir.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the
sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi;
the sons of Jaaziah: Beno.

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno,
and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.

<span id="an_24:28">24:28</span> Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.

<span id="an_24:29">24:29</span> Of Kish; the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.

<span id="an_24:30">24:30</span> And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder,
and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers'
houses.

<span id="an_24:31">24:31</span> These likewise cast lots even as their
brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok,
and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers' \[houses\] of the priests
and of the Levites; the fathers' \[houses\] of the chief even as those
of his younger brother.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> Moreover David and the captains of the
host set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of
Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries,
and with cymbals: and the number of them that did the work according to
their service was:

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph,
and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of
Asaph, who prophesied after the order of the king.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Of Jeduthun; the sons of Jeduthun:
Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under
the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in
giving thanks and praising Jehovah.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Of Heman; the sons of Heman: Bukkiah,
Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah,
Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> All these were the sons of Heman the
king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to
Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> All these were under the hands of their
father for song in the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, psalteries, and
harps, for the service of the house of God; Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman
being under the order of the king.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> And the number of them, with their
brethren that were instructed in singing unto Jehovah, even all that
were skilful, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> And they cast lots for their offices, all
alike, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to
Joseph: the second to Gedaliah; he and his brethren and sons were
twelve:

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> the third to Zaccur, his sons and his
brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> the fourth to Izri, his sons and his
brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and
his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> the sixth to Bukkiah, his sons and his
brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> the seventh to Jesharelah, his sons and
his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> the eighth to Jeshaiah, his sons and
his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> the ninth to Mattaniah, his sons and
his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> the tenth to Shimei, his sons and his
brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> the eleventh to Azarel, his sons and
his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> the twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons and
his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> for the thirteenth, Shubael, his sons
and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> for the fourteenth, Mattithiah, his
sons and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> for the fifteenth to Jeremoth, his sons
and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:23">25:23</span> for the sixteenth to Hananiah, his sons
and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:24">25:24</span> for the seventeenth to Joshbekashah,
his sons and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:25">25:25</span> for the eighteenth to Hanani, his sons
and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:26">25:26</span> for the nineteenth to Mallothi, his
sons and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:27">25:27</span> for the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons
and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:28">25:28</span> for the one and twentieth to Hothir,
his sons and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:29">25:29</span> for the two and twentieth to Giddalti,
his sons and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:30">25:30</span> for the three and twentieth to
Mahazioth, his sons and his brethren, twelve:

<span id="an_25:31">25:31</span> for the four and twentieth to
Romamtiezer, his sons and his brethren, twelve.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> For the courses of the doorkeepers: of
the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> And Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the
first-born, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth,
Eliehoenai the seventh.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> And Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the
first-born, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth,
and Nethanel the fifth,

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh,
Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons
born, that ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty
men of valor.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, and Rephael,
and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren were valiant men, Elihu, and
Semachiah.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> All these were of the sons of Obed-edom:
they and their sons and their brethren, able men in strength for the
service; threescore and two of Obed-edom.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren,
valiant men, eighteen.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> Also Hosah, of the children of Merari,
had sons: Shimri the chief, (for though he was not the first-born, yet
his father made him chief),

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third,
Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> Of these were the courses of the
doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brethren,
to minister in the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> And they cast lots, as well the small
as the great, according to their fathers' houses, for every gate.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah.
Then for Zechariah his son, a discreet counsellor, they cast lots; and
his lot came out northward.

<span id="an_26:15">26:15</span> To Obed-edom southward; and to his sons
the store-house.

<span id="an_26:16">26:16</span> To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the
gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goeth up, watch against watch.

<span id="an_26:17">26:17</span> Eastward were six Levites, northward
four a day, southward four a day, and for the store-house two and two.

<span id="an_26:18">26:18</span> For Parbar westward, four at the
causeway, and two at Parbar.

<span id="an_26:19">26:19</span> These were the courses of the
doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.

<span id="an_26:20">26:20</span> And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the
treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated
things.

<span id="an_26:21">26:21</span> The sons of Ladan, the sons of the
Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers' \[houses\]
belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli.

<span id="an_26:22">26:22</span> The sons of Jehieli: Zetham, and Joel
his brother, over the treasures of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_26:23">26:23</span> Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of
the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites:

<span id="an_26:24">26:24</span> and Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son
of Moses, was ruler over the treasures.

<span id="an_26:25">26:25</span> And his brethren: of Eliezer \[came\]
Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri
his son, and Shelomoth his son.

<span id="an_26:26">26:26</span> This Shelomoth and his brethren were
over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king,
and the heads of the fathers' \[houses\], the captains over thousands
and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated.

<span id="an_26:27">26:27</span> Out of the spoil won in battles did
they dedicate to repair the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_26:28">26:28</span> And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul
the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah,
had dedicated, whosoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand
of Shelomoth, and of his brethren.

<span id="an_26:29">26:29</span> Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his
sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.

<span id="an_26:30">26:30</span> Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his
brethren, men of valor, a thousand and seven hundred, had the oversight
of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Jehovah,
and for the service of the king.

<span id="an_26:31">26:31</span> Of the Hebronites was Jerijah the
chief, even of the Hebronites, according to their generations by
fathers' \[houses\]. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they
were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at
Jazer of Gilead.

<span id="an_26:32">26:32</span> And his brethren, men of valor, were
two thousand and seven hundred, heads of fathers' \[houses\], whom king
David made overseers over the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God, and
for the affairs of the king.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Now the children of Israel after their
number, \[to wit\], the heads of fathers' \[houses\] and the captains of
thousands and of hundreds, and their officers that served the king, in
any matter of the courses which came in and went out month by month
throughout all the months of the year-of every course were twenty and
four thousand.

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> Over the first course for the first month
was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four
thousand.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> \[He was\] of the children of Perez, the
chief of all the captains of the host for the first month.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> And over the course of the second month
was Dodai the Ahohite, and his course; and Mikloth the ruler: and in his
course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> The third captain of the host for the
third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, chief: and in
his course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> This is that Benaiah, who was the mighty
man of the thirty, and over the thirty: and \[of\] his course was
Ammizabad his son.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> The fourth \[captain\] for the fourth
month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him:
and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> The fifth captain for this fifth month
was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four
thousand.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> The sixth \[captain\] for the sixth month
was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and
four thousand.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> The seventh \[captain\] for the seventh
month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his
course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> The eighth \[captain\] for the eighth
month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zerahites: and in his course
were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> The ninth \[captain\] for the ninth
month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course
were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> The tenth \[captain\] for the tenth
month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zerahites: and in his course
were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> The eleventh \[captain\] for the
eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim:
and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> The twelfth \[captain\] for the twelfth
month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were
twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> Furthermore over the tribes of Israel:
of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri the ruler: of the
Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah:

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel:
of Aaron, Zadok:

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of
David: of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael:

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of
Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jeremoth the son of Azriel:

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the
son of Azaziah: of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> of the half -\[tribe\] of Manasseh in
Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of
Abner:

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham.
These were the captains of the tribes of Israel.

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> But David took not the number of them
from twenty years old and under, because Jehovah had said he would
increase Israel like to the stars of heaven.

<span id="an_27:24">27:24</span> Joab the son of Zeruiah began to
number, but finished not; and there came wrath for this upon Israel;
neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king
David.

<span id="an_27:25">27:25</span> And over the king's treasures was
Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the treasures in the fields, in the
cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jonathan the son of
Uzziah:

<span id="an_27:26">27:26</span> And over them that did the work of the
field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

<span id="an_27:27">27:27</span> and over the vineyards was Shimei the
Ramathite: and over the increase of the vineyards for the wine-cellars
was Zabdi the Shiphmite:

<span id="an_27:28">27:28</span> and over the olive-trees and the
sycomore-trees that were in the lowland was Baal-hanan the Gederite: and
over the cellars of oil was Joash:

<span id="an_27:29">27:29</span> and over the herds that fed in Sharon
was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys
was Shaphat the son of Adlai:

<span id="an_27:30">27:30</span> and over the camels was Obil the
Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: and over
the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite.

<span id="an_27:31">27:31</span> All these were the rulers of the
substance which was king David's.

<span id="an_27:32">27:32</span> Also Jonathan, David's uncle, was a
counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of
Hachmoni was with the king's sons:

<span id="an_27:33">27:33</span> And Ahithophel was the king's
counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend:

<span id="an_27:34">27:34</span> and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the
son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the king's host was
Joab.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> And David assembled all the princes of
Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies
that served the king by course, and the captains of thousands, and the
captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and
possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the
mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, unto Jerusalem.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Then David the king stood up upon his
feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: as for me, it was
in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of
Jehovah, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for the
building.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> But God said unto me, Thou shalt not
build a house for my name, because thou art a man of war, and hast shed
blood.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> Howbeit Jehovah, the God of Israel, chose
me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever:
for he hath chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the
house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in
me to make me king over all Israel;

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> And of all my sons (for Jehovah hath
given me many sons), he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the
throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he
shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son,
and I will be his father.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> And I will establish his kingdom for
ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at
this day.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> Now therefore, in the sight of all
Israel, the assembly of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, observe
and seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that ye may
possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
after you for ever.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the
God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing
mind; for Jehovah searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the
imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of
thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> Take heed now; for Jehovah hath chosen
thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> Then David gave to Solomon his son the
pattern of the porch \[of the temple\], and of the houses thereof, and
of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper rooms thereof, and of the
inner chambers thereof, and of the place of the mercy-seat;

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> and the pattern of all that he had by
the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Jehovah, and for all the
chambers round about, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for
the treasuries of the dedicated things;

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> also for the courses of the priests and
the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of
Jehovah, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Jehovah;

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> of gold by weight for the \[vessels
of\] gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; \[of silver\] for
all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of
service;

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> by weight also for the candlesticks of
gold, and for the lamps thereof, of gold, by weight for every
candlestick and for the lamps thereof; and for the candlesticks of
silver, \[silver\] by weight for \[every\] candlestick and for the lamps
thereof, according to the use of every candlestick;

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> and the gold by weight for the tables
of showbread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> and the flesh-hooks, and the basins,
and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every
bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> and for the altar of incense refined
gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, \[even\] the
cherubim, that spread out \[their wings\], and covered the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> All this, \[said David\], have I been
made to understand in writing from the hand of Jehovah, even all the
works of this pattern.

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> And David said to Solomon his son, Be
strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed; for
Jehovah God, even my God, is with thee; he will not fail thee, nor
forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah
be finished.

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> And, behold, there are the courses of
the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God:
and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man
that hath skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and all
the people will be wholly at thy commandment.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> And David the king said unto all the
assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and
tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for
Jehovah God.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> Now I have prepared with all my might for
the house of my God the gold for the \[things of\] gold, and the silver
for the \[things of\] silver, and the brass for the \[things of\] brass,
the iron for the \[things of\] iron, and wood for the \[things of\]
wood; onyx stones, and \[stones\] to be set, stones for inlaid work, and
of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones
in abundance.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> Moreover also, because I have set my
affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine
own of gold and silver, I give it unto the house of my God, over and
above all that I have prepared for the holy house,

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> even three thousand talents of gold, of
the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver,
wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses;

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> of gold for the \[things of\] gold, and
of silver for the \[things of\] silver, and for all manner of work \[to
be made\] by the hands of artificers. Who then offereth willingly to
consecrate himself this day unto Jehovah?

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> Then the princes of the fathers'
\[houses\], and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of
thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered
willingly;

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> and they gave for the service of the
house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and
of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents,
and of iron a hundred thousand talents.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> And they with whom \[precious\] stones
were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, under the
hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> Then the people rejoiced, for that they
offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly
to Jehovah: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> Wherefore David blessed Jehovah before
all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Jehovah, the God of
Israel our father, for ever and ever.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> Thine, O Jehovah, is the greatness, and
the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that
is in the heavens and in the earth \[is thine\]; thine is the kingdom, O
Jehovah, and thou art exalted as head above all.

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> Both riches and honor come of thee, and
thou rulest over all; and in thy hand is power and might; and in thy
hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> Now therefore, our God, we thank thee,
and praise thy glorious name.

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> But who am I, and what is my people,
that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all
things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> For we are strangers before thee, and
sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a
shadow, and there is no abiding.

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> O Jehovah our God, all this store that
we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh of thy
hand, and is all thine own.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> I know also, my God, that thou triest
the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the
uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and
now have I seen with joy thy people, that are present here, offer
willingly unto thee.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of
Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination
of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto
thee;

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> and give unto Solomon my son a perfect
heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and
to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made
provision.

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> And David said to all the assembly, Now
bless Jehovah your God. And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of
their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped Jehovah, and
the king.

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> And they sacrificed sacrifices unto
Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the morrow after
that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand
lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all
Israel,

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> and did eat and drink before Jehovah on
that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David
king the second time, and anointed him unto Jehovah to be prince, and
Zadok to be priest.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> Then Solomon sat on the throne of
Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all
Israel obeyed him.

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> And all the princes, and the mighty
men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto
Solomon the king.

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> And Jehovah magnified Solomon
exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal
majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.

<span id="an_29:26">29:26</span> Now David the son of Jesse reigned over
all Israel.

<span id="an_29:27">29:27</span> And the time that he reigned over
Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and
three \[years\] reigned he in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_29:28">29:28</span> And he died in a good old age, full of
days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_29:29">29:29</span> Now the acts of David the king, first
and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer,
and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the
seer,

<span id="an_29:30">29:30</span> with all his reign and his might, and
the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms
of the countries.
