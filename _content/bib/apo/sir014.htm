<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Blessed is he whose conscience hath not condemned him, and who is not fallen from his hope in the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Riches are not comely for a niggard: and what should an envious man do with money? </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;He that gathereth by defrauding his own soul gathereth for others, that shall spend his goods riotously. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? he shall not take pleasure in his goods. </P>

<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The envious man hath a wicked eye; he turneth away his face, and despiseth men. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;A covetous man's eye is not satisfied with his portion; and the iniquity of the wicked drieth up his soul. </P>

<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part of a good desire overpass thee. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Shalt thou not leave thy travails unto another? and thy labours to be divided by lot? </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Give, and take, and sanctify thy soul; for there is no seeking of dainties in the grave. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;All flesh waxeth old as a garment: for the covenant from the beginning is, Thou shalt die the death. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;As of the green leaves on a thick tree, some fall, and some grow; so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Every work rotteth and consumeth away, and the worker thereof shall go withal. </P>

<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;He that prieth in at her windows shall also hearken at her doors. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;He that doth lodge near her house shall also fasten a pin in her walls. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;He shall pitch his tent nigh unto her, and shall lodge in a lodging where good things are. </P>
