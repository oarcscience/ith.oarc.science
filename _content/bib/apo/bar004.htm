<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Baruch Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endureth for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that thou mayest be illuminated. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Give not thine honour to another, nor the things that are profitable unto thee to a strange nation. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Ye were sold to the nations, not for [your] destruction: but because ye moved God to wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils, and not to God. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Ye have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up; and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God hath brought upon me great mourning; </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon them. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departed from the law of God. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting hath brought upon them. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For he hath brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;These have carried away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But what can I help you? </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Be of good cheer, O my children, cry unto the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come unto me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come unto you from the Everlasting our Saviour. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness for ever. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Like as now the neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for thine enemy hath persecuted thee; but shortly thou shalt see his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto God: for ye shall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more. </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For he that hath brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your salvation. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave thee that name will comfort thee. </P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thy fall. </P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Miserable are the cities which thy children served: miserable is she that received thy sons. </P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;For as she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation. </P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into mourning. </P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time. </P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east, and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from God. </P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away, they come gathered together from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God. </P>
