<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, and bring him to the wedding. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he will be very sorry. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And early in the morning they went forth both together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife. </P>
