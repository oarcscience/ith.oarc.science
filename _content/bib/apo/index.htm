<P>
The Apocrypha refer to texts which are left out of officially sanctioned
versions ('canon') of the Bible.
The term means 'things hidden away,' which implies secret
or esoteric literature.
However, none of these texts were ever considered secret.</P>

<P>
In some Protestant Bibles, they are placed between the New and Old Testament.
In the Roman Catholic Bibles the books
are interspersed with the rest of the text.
In this case they are also called 'Deuterocanonical',
which means 'secondary canon.'
The books on this page are all Deuterocanonical.</P>

<P>
Jerome rejected the Deuterocanonical books when he
was translating the Bible into Latin
circa 450 CE, (see the <A HREF="../vul/index">Vulgate</A>).
This was because no Hebrew version of these texts could be found,
even though they were present in the Greek Old Testament (the Septuagint).
However, they eventually were accepted by the Church, and most of them
remained part of the Bible.
Protestants rejected these books during the Reformation as lacking
divine authority.
They either excised them completely or placed them in a third section
of the Bible.
The Roman Catholic Council of Trent, on the other hand, declared in 1546
that the Deuterocanonical books were indeed divine.</P>

<P>
Of these books, Tobias, Judith, the Wisdom of Solomon, Baruch, and Maccabees,
remain in the Catholic Bible.
First Esdras, Second Esdras, Epistle of Jeremiah,
Susanna, Bel and the Dragon,
Prayer of Manasseh, Prayer of Azariah,
and Laodiceans are not
today considered part of the Catholic apocrypha.
</P>

<P>
With one exception, all of these books are considered 'Old Testament'.
The apocryphal New Testament 'Letter of Paul to the Laodiceans',
was once incorporated in many versions of the Bible.  However Laodiceans
is now considered just a pastiche of other Epistles, and is omitted
from contemporary Bibles.</P>

<P>
There are many other apocryphal books, which do not fall into
the 'Deuterocanonical' category, such as the many additional New
Testament Gospels, and the apocalyptic book of Enoch.
Some of these can be found in the
<A HREF="../../chr/apo/index">Apocrypha section</A>.</P>
