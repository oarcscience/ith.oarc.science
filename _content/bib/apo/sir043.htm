<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 43</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The pride of the height, the clear firmament, the beauty of heaven, with his glorious shew; </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The sun when it appeareth, declaring at his rising a marvellous instrument, the work of the most High: </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;At noon it parcheth the country, and who can abide the burning heat thereof? </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the sun burneth the mountains three times more; breathing out fiery vapours, and sending forth bright beams, it dimmeth the eyes. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Great is the Lord that made it; and at his commandment runneth hastily. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He made the moon also to serve in her season for a declaration of times, and a sign of the world. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;From the moon is the sign of feasts, a light that decreaseth in her perfection. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully in her changing, being an instrument of the armies above, shining in the firmament of heaven; </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in their order, and never faint in their watches. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it; very beautiful it is in the brightness thereof. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;It compasseth the heaven about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the most High have bended it. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall aplace, and sendeth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Through this the treasures are opened: and clouds fly forth as fowls. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;By his great power he maketh the clouds firm, and the hailstones are broken small. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;At his sight the mountains are shaken, and at his will the south wind bloweth. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The noise of the thunder maketh the earth to tremble: so doth the northern storm and the whirlwind: as birds flying he scattereth the snow, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting of grasshoppers: </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The eye marvelleth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the raining of it. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The hoarfrost also as salt he poureth on the earth, and being congealed, it lieth on the top of sharp stakes. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;When the cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealed into ice, it abideth upon every gathering together of water, and clotheth the water as with a breastplate. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;It devoureth the mountains, and burneth the wilderness, and consumeth the grass as fire. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;A present remedy of all is a mist coming speedily, a dew coming after heat refresheth. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;By his counsel he appeaseth the deep, and planteth islands therein. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;They that sail on the sea tell of the danger thereof; and when we hear it with our ears, we marvel thereat. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For therein be strange and wondrous works, variety of all kinds of beasts and whales created. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;By him the end of them hath prosperous success, and by his word all things consist. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;We may speak much, and yet come short: wherefore in sum, he is all. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;How shall we be able to magnify him? for he is great above all his works. </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;The Lord is terrible and very great, and marvellous is his power. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;When ye glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as ye can; for even yet will he far exceed: and when ye exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for ye can never go far enough. </P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Who hath seen him, that he might tell us? and who can magnify him as he is? </P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;There are yet hid greater things than these be, for we have seen but a few of his works. </P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;For the Lord hath made all things; and to the godly hath he given wisdom. </P>
