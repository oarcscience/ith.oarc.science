<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 17</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed: therefore unnurtured souls have erred. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay [there] exiled from the eternal providence. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with [strange] apparitions. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises [as of waters] falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents, </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell, </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars, </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water running violently, </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; these things made them to swoon for fear. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour: </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness. </P>
