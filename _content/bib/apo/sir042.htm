<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 42</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Of these things be not thou ashamed, and accept no person to sin thereby: </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Of the law of the most High, and his covenant; and of judgment to justify the ungodly; </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Of reckoning with thy partners and travellers; or of the gift of the heritage of friends; </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Of exactness of balance and weights; or of getting much or little; </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And of merchants' indifferent selling; of much correction of children; and to make the side of an evil servant to bleed. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Sure keeping is good, where an evil wife is; and shut up, where many hands are. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Deliver all things in number and weight; and put all in writing that thou givest out, or receivest in. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and the extreme aged that contendeth with those that are young: thus shalt thou be truly learned, and approved of all men living. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The father waketh for the daughter, when no man knoweth; and the care for her taketh away sleep: when she is young, lest she pass away the flower of her age; and being married, lest she should be hated: </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;In her virginity, lest she should be defiled and gotten with child in her father's house; and having an husband, lest she should misbehave herself; and when she is married, lest she should be barren. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter, lest she make thee a laughingstock to thine enemies, and a byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, and make thee ashamed before the multitude. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Behold not every body's beauty, and sit not in the midst of women. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For from garments cometh a moth, and from women wickedness. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Better is the churlishness of a man than a courteous woman, a woman, I say, which bringeth shame and reproach. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;I will now remember the works of the Lord, and declare the things that I have seen: In the words of the Lord are his works. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The sun that giveth light looketh upon all things, and the work thereof is full of the glory of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The Lord hath not given power to the saints to declare all his marvellous works, which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, that whatsoever is might be established for his glory. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He seeketh out the deep, and the heart, and considereth their crafty devices: for the Lord knoweth all that may be known, and he beholdeth the signs of the world. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He declareth the things that are past, and for to come, and revealeth the steps of hidden things. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;No thought escapeth him, neither any word is hidden from him. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;He hath garnished the excellent works of his wisdom, and he is from everlasting to everlasting: unto him may nothing be added, neither can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any counsellor. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Oh how desirable are all his works! and that a man may see even to a spark. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;All these things live and remain for ever for all uses, and they are all obedient. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;All things are double one against another: and he hath made nothing imperfect. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;One thing establisheth the good or another: and who shall be filled with beholding his glory? </P>
