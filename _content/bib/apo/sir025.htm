<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 25</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful both before God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of neighbours, a man and a wife that agree together. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Three sorts of men my soul hateth, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, and an old adulterer that doateth. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thou find any thing in thine age? </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and for ancient men to know counsel! </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding and counsel to men of honour. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;There be nine things which I have judged in mine heart to be happy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that hath joy of his children; and he that liveth to see the fall of his enemy: </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself: </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh in the ears of them that will hear: </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;O how great is he that findeth wisdom! yet is there none above him that feareth the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But the love of the Lord passeth all things for illumination: he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened? </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faith is the beginning of cleaving unto him. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;[Give me] any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman: </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate me: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, and darkeneth her countenance like sackcloth. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; and when he heareth it shall sigh bitterly. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall upon her. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a quiet man. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not for pleasure. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Give the water no passage; neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go. </P>
