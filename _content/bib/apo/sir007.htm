<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Do no evil, so shall no harm come unto thee. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Depart from the unjust, and iniquity shall turn away from thee. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;My son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness, and thou shalt not reap them sevenfold. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Seek not of the Lord preeminence, neither of the king the seat of honour. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;justify not thyself before the Lord; and boast not of thy wisdom before the king. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Seek not to be judge, being not able to take away iniquity; lest at any time thou fear the person of the mighty, an stumblingblock in the way of thy uprightness. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Offend not against the multitude of a city, and then thou shalt not cast thyself down among the people. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Bind not one sin upon another; for in one thou shalt not be unpunished. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Say not, God will look upon the multitude of my oblations, and when I offer to the most high God, he will accept it. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Be not fainthearted when thou makest thy prayer, and neglect not to give alms. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: for there is one which humbleth and exalteth. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Devise not a lie against thy brother; neither do the like to thy friend. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Use not to make any manner of lie: for the custom thereof is not good. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Use not many words in a multitude of elders, and make not much babbling when thou prayest. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Hate not laborious work, neither husbandry, which the most High hath ordained. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Number not thyself among the multitude of sinners, but remember that wrath will not tarry long. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Humble thyself greatly: for the vengeance of the ungodly is fire and worms. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Change not a friend for any good by no means; neither a faithful brother for the gold of Ophir. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Forego not a wise and good woman: for her grace is above gold. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Whereas thy servant worketh truly, entreat him not evil. nor the hireling that bestoweth himself wholly for thee. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Let thy soul love a good servant, and defraud him not of liberty. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: and if they be for thy profit, keep them with thee. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow down their neck from their youth. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Hast thou daughters? have a care of their body, and shew not thyself cheerful toward them. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Marry thy daughter, and so shalt thou have performed a weighty matter: but give her to a man of understanding. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Hast thou a wife after thy mind? forsake her not: but give not thyself over to a light woman. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not the sorrows of thy mother. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Remember that thou wast begotten of them; and how canst thou recompense them the things that they have done for thee? </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Fear the Lord with all thy soul, and reverence his priests. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Love him that made thee with all thy strength, and forsake not his ministers. </P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Fear the Lord, and honor the priest; and give him his portion, as it is commanded thee; the firstfruits, and the trespass offering, and the gift of the shoulders, and the sacrifice of sanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy things. </P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And stretch thine hand unto the poor, that thy blessing may be perfected. </P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;A gift hath grace in the sight of every man living; and for the dead detain it not. </P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Fail not to be with them that weep, and mourn with them that mourn. </P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Be not slow to visit the sick: for that shall make thee to be beloved. </P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thou shalt never do amiss. </P>
