<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 33</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;There shall no evil happen unto him that feareth the Lord; but in temptation even again he will deliver him. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;A wise man hateth not the law; but he that is an hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;A man of understanding trusteth in the law; and the law is faithful unto him, as an oracle. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Prepare what to say, and so thou shalt be heard: and bind up instruction, and then make answer. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The heart of the foolish is like a cartwheel; and his thoughts are like a rolling axletree. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;A stallion horse is as a mocking friend, he neigheth under every one that sitteth upon him. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Why doth one day excel another, when as all the light of every day in the year is of the sun? </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished: and he altered seasons and feasts. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Some of them hath he made high days, and hallowed them, and some of them hath he made ordinary days. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And all men are from the ground, and Adam was created of earth: </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;In much knowledge the Lord hath divided them, and made their ways diverse. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Some of them hath he blessed and exalted and some of them he sanctified, and set near himself: but some of them hath he cursed and brought low, and turned out of their places. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;As the clay is in the potter's hand, to fashion it at his pleasure: so man is in the hand of him that made him, to render to them as liketh him best. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Good is set against evil, and life against death: so is the godly against the sinner, and the sinner against the godly. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So look upon all the works of the most High; and there are two and two, one against another. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I awaked up last of all, as one that gathereth after the grapegatherers: by the blessing of the Lord I profited, and tred my winepress like a gatherer of grapes. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Consider that I laboured not for myself only, but for all them that seek learning. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Hear me, O ye great men of the people, and hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the congregation. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Give not thy son and wife, thy brother and friend, power over thee while thou livest, and give not thy goods to another: lest it repent thee, and thou intreat for the same again. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;As long as thou livest and hast breath in thee, give not thyself over to any. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For better it is that thy children should seek to thee, than that thou shouldest stand to their courtesy. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;In all thy works keep to thyself the preeminence; leave not a stain in thine honour. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;At the time when thou shalt end thy days, and finish thy life, distribute thine inheritance. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Fodder, a wand, and burdens, are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work, for a servant. . </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest: but if thou let him go idle, he shall seek liberty. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;A yoke and a collar do bow the neck: so are tortures and torments for an evil servant. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Send him to labour, that he be not idle; for idleness teacheth much evil. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Set him to work, as is fit for him: if he be not obedient, put on more heavy fetters. </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But be not excessive toward any; and without discretion do nothing. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;If thou have a servant, let him be unto thee as thyself, because thou hast bought him with a price. </P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;If thou have a servant, entreat him as a brother: for thou hast need of him, as of thine own soul: if thou entreat him evil, and he run from thee, which way wilt thou go to seek him? </P>
