<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word, </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast made, </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgment with an upright heart: </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from among thy children: </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person, and of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgment and laws. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters: </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandments. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may know what is pleasing unto thee. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father's seat. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is? </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out? </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above? </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and were saved through wisdom. </P>
