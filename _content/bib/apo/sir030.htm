<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 30</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;He that loveth his son causeth him oft to feel the rod, that he may have joy of him in the end. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;He that chastiseth his son shall have joy in him, and shall rejoice of him among his acquaintance. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;He that teacheth his son grieveth the enemy: and before his friends he shall rejoice of him. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Though his father die, yet he is as though he were not dead: for he hath left one behind him that is like himself. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;While he lived, he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died, he was not sorrowful. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He left behind him an avenger against his enemies, and one that shall requite kindness to his friends. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;He that maketh too much of his son shall bind up his wounds; and his bowels will be troubled at every cry. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;An horse not broken becometh headstrong: and a child left to himself will be wilful. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Cocker thy child, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he will bring thee to heaviness. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow with him, and lest thou gnash thy teeth in the end. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Give him no liberty in his youth, and wink not at his follies. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat him on the sides while he is a child, lest he wax stubborn, and be disobedient unto thee, and so bring sorrow to thine heart. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Chastise thy son, and hold him to labour, lest his lewd behaviour be an offence unto thee. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Better is the poor, being sound and strong of constitution, than a rich man that is afflicted in his body. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Health and good estate of body are above all gold, and a strong body above infinite wealth. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;There is no riches above a sound body, and no joy above the joy of the heart. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Death is better than a bitter life or continual sickness. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Delicates poured upon a mouth shut up are as messes of meat set upon a grave. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;What good doeth the offering unto an idol? for neither can it eat nor smell: so is he that is persecuted of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He seeth with his eyes and groaneth, as an eunuch that embraceth a virgin and sigheth. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Give not over thy mind to heaviness, and afflict not thyself in thine own counsel. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;The gladness of the heart is the life of man, and the joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Love thine own soul, and comfort thy heart, remove sorrow far from thee: for sorrow hath killed many, and there is no profit therein. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Envy and wrath shorten the life, and carefulness bringeth age before the time. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat and diet. </P>
