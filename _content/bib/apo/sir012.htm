<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;When thou wilt do good know to whom thou doest it; so shalt thou be thanked for thy benefits. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Do good to the godly man, and thou shalt find a recompence; and if not from him, yet from the most High. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;There can no good come to him that is always occupied in evil, nor to him that giveth no alms. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Give to the godly man, and help not a sinner. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Do well unto him that is lowly, but give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not unto him, lest he overmaster thee thereby: for [else] thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done unto him. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For the most High hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance unto the ungodly, and keepeth them against the mighty day of their punishment. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Give unto the good, and help not the sinner. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;A friend cannot be known in prosperity: and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;In the prosperity of a man enemies will be grieved: but in his adversity even a friend will depart. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Never trust thine enemy: for like as iron rusteth, so is his wickedness. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him, and thou shalt be unto him as if thou hadst wiped a lookingglass, and thou shalt know that his rust hath not been altogether wiped away. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Set him not by thee, lest, when he hath overthrown thee, he stand up in thy place; neither let him sit at thy right hand, lest he seek to take thy seat, and thou at the last remember my words, and be pricked therewith. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come nigh wild beasts? </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;So one that goeth to a sinner, and is defiled with him in his sins, who will pity? </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For a while he will abide with thee, but if thou begin to fall, he will not tarry. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he imagineth how to throw thee into a pit: he will weep with his eyes, but if he find opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;If adversity come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first; and though he pretend to help thee, yet shall he undermine thee. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his countenance. </P>
