<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Instead of a friend become not an enemy; for [thereby] thou shalt inherit an ill name, shame, and reproach: even so shall a sinner that hath a double tongue. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; that thy soul be not torn in pieces as a bull [straying alone.] </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leave thyself as a dry tree. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorn of his enemies. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first and be not hasty to credit him. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strife will discover thy reproach. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and will hide himself from thy face. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;A faithfull friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found such an one hath found a treasure. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright: for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thou find wisdom till thine old age. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, and wait for her good fruits: for thou shalt not toil much in labouring about her, but thou shalt eat of her fruits right soon. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is without understanding will not remain with her. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he will cast her from him ere it be long. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not my counsel, </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chain. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bonds. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Come unto her with thy whole heart, and keep her ways with all thy power. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: and when thou hast got hold of her, let her not go. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For at the last thou shalt find her rest, and that shall be turned to thy joy. </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and her chains a robe of glory. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are purple lace. </P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put her about thee as a crown of joy. </P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent. </P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: and if thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise, </P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto him that is wise. </P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not the parables of understanding escape thee. </P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And if thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimes unto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door. </P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditate continually in his commandments: he shall establish thine heart, and give thee wisdom at thine owns desire. </P>
