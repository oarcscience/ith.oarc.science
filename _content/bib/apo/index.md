# The Apocrypha

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Jump to Contents](#index)

The Apocrypha refer to texts which are left out of officially sanctioned
versions ('canon') of the Bible. The term means 'things hidden away,'
which implies secret or esoteric literature. However, none of these
texts were ever considered secret.

In some Protestant Bibles, they are placed between the New and Old
Testament. In the Roman Catholic Bibles the books are interspersed with
the rest of the text. In this case they are also called
'Deuterocanonical', which means 'secondary canon.' The books on this
page are all Deuterocanonical.

Jerome rejected the Deuterocanonical books when he was translating the
Bible into Latin circa 450 CE, (see the [Vulgate](../vul/index)). This
was because no Hebrew version of these texts could be found, even though
they were present in the Greek Old Testament (the Septuagint). However,
they eventually were accepted by the Church, and most of them remained
part of the Bible. Protestants rejected these books during the
Reformation as lacking divine authority. They either excised them
completely or placed them in a third section of the Bible. The Roman
Catholic Council of Trent, on the other hand, declared in 1546 that the
Deuterocanonical books were indeed divine.

Of these books, Tobias, Judith, the Wisdom of Solomon, Baruch, and
Maccabees, remain in the Catholic Bible. First Esdras, Second Esdras,
Epistle of Jeremiah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh,
Prayer of Azariah, and Laodiceans are not today considered part of the
Catholic apocrypha.

With one exception, all of these books are considered 'Old Testament'.
The apocryphal New Testament 'Letter of Paul to the Laodiceans', was
once incorporated in many versions of the Bible. However Laodiceans is
now considered just a pastiche of other Epistles, and is omitted from
contemporary Bibles.

There are many other apocryphal books, which do not fall into the
'Deuterocanonical' category, such as the many additional New Testament
Gospels, and the apocalyptic book of Enoch. Some of these can be found
in the [Apocrypha section](../../chr/apo/index).
