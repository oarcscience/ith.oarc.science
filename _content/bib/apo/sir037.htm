<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 37</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Every friend saith, I am his friend also: but there is a friend, which is only a friend in name. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Is it not a grief unto death, when a companion and friend is turned to an enemy? </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;O wicked imagination, whence camest thou in to cover the earth with deceit? </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;There is a companion, which rejoiceth in the prosperity of a friend, but in the time of trouble will be against him. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;There is a companion, which helpeth his friend for the belly, and taketh up the buckler against the enemy. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Every counsellor extolleth counsel; but there is some that counselleth for himself. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Beware of a counsellor, and know before what need he hath; for he will counsel for himself; lest he cast the lot upon thee, </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And say unto thee, Thy way is good: and afterward he stand on the other side, to see what shall befall thee. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Consult not with one that suspecteth thee: and hide thy counsel from such as envy thee. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous; neither with a coward in matters of war; nor with a merchant concerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an envious man of thankfulness; nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; nor with the slothful for any work; nor with an hireling for a year of finishing work; nor with an idle servant of much business: hearken not unto these in any matter of counsel. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But be continually with a godly man, whom thou knowest to keep the commandments of the Lord, whose, mind is according to thy mind, and will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And let the counsel of thine own heart stand: for there is no man more faithful unto thee than it. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For a man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen, that sit above in an high tower. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And above all this pray to the most High, that he will direct thy way in truth. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Let reason go before every enterprize, and counsel before every action. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The countenance is a sign of changing of the heart. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Four manner of things appear: good and evil, life and death: but the tongue ruleth over them continually. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;There is one that is wise and teacheth many, and yet is unprofitable to himself. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;There is one that sheweth wisdom in words, and is hated: he shall be destitute of all food. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For grace is not given, him from the Lord, because he is deprived of all wisdom. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Another is wise to himself; and the fruits of understanding are commendable in his mouth. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;A wise man instructeth his people; and the fruits of his understanding fail not. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;A wise man shall be filled with blessing; and all they that see him shall count him happy. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;The days of the life of man may be numbered: but the days of Israel are innumerable. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;A wise man shall inherit glory among his people, and his name shall be perpetual. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;My son, prove thy soul in thy life, and see what is evil for it, and give not that unto it. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For all things are not profitable for all men, neither hath every soul pleasure in every thing. </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Be not unsatiable in any dainty thing, nor too greedy upon meats: </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For excess of meats bringeth sickness, and surfeiting will turn into choler. </P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;By surfeiting have many perished; but he that taketh heed prolongeth his life. </P>
