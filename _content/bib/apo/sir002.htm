<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for temptation. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low estate. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright, and trust in him. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside, lest ye fall. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall not fail. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joy and mercy. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his fear, and was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon him? </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goeth two ways! </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Woe unto him that is fainthearted! for he believeth not; therefore shall he not be defended. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Woe unto you that have lost patience! and what will ye do when the Lord shall visit you? </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;They that fear the Lord will not disobey his Word; and they that love him will keep his ways. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;They that fear the Lord will seek that which is well, pleasing unto him; and they that love him shall be filled with the law. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in his sight, </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Saying, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his mercy. </P>
