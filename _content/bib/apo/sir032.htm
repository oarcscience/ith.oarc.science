<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 32</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;If thou be made the master [of a feast,] lift not thyself up, but be among them as one of the rest; take diligent care for them, and so sit down. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, that thou mayest be merry with them, and receive a crown for thy well ordering of the feast. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Speak, thou that art the elder, for it becometh thee, but with sound judgment; and hinder not musick. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Pour not out words where there is a musician, and shew not forth wisdom out of time. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;A concert of musick in a banquet of wine is as a signet of carbuncle set in gold. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;As a signet of an emerald set in a work of gold, so is the melody of musick with pleasant wine. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Speak, young man, if there be need of thee: and yet scarcely when thou art twice asked. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Let thy speech be short, comprehending much in few words; be as one that knoweth and yet holdeth his tongue. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;If thou be among great men, make not thyself equal with them; and when ancient men are in place, use not many words. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Before the thunder goeth lightning; and before a shamefaced man shall go favour. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Rise up betimes, and be not the last; but get thee home without delay. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;There take thy pastime, and do what thou wilt: but sin not by proud speech. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And for these things bless him that made thee, and hath replenished thee with his good things. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Whoso feareth the Lord will receive his discipline; and they that seek him early shall find favour. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He that seeketh the law shall be filled therewith: but the hypocrite will be offended thereat. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;They that fear the Lord shall find judgment, and shall kindle justice as a light. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;A sinful man will not be reproved, but findeth an excuse according to his will. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;A man of counsel will be considerate; but a strange and proud man is not daunted with fear, even when of himself he hath done without counsel. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Do nothing without advice; and when thou hast once done, repent not. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Go not in a way wherein thou mayest fall, and stumble not among the stones. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Be not confident in a plain way. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And beware of thine own children. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;In every good work trust thy own soul; for this is the keeping of the commandments. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;He that believeth in the Lord taketh heed to the commandment; and he that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse. </P>
