<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 31</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the care thereof driveth away sleep. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Watching care will not let a man slumber, as a sore disease breaketh sleep, </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together; and when he resteth, he is filled with his delicates. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The poor laboureth in his poor estate; and when he leaveth off, he is still needy. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He that loveth gold shall not be justified, and he that followeth corruption shall have enough thereof. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Gold hath been the ruin of many, and their destruction was present. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it, and every fool shall be taken therewith. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hath not gone after gold. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderful things hath he done among his people. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Who hath been tried thereby, and found perfect? then let him glory. Who might offend, and hath not offended? or done evil, and hath not done it? </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;His goods shall be established, and the congregation shall declare his alms. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;If thou sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, and say not, There is much meat on it. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing: and what is created more wicked than an eye? therefore it weepeth upon every occasion. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it looketh, and thrust it not with him into the dish. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Judge not thy neighbour by thyself: and be discreet in every point. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Eat as it becometh a man, those things which are set before thee; and devour note, lest thou be hated. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Leave off first for manners' sake; and be not unsatiable, lest thou offend. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;When thou sittest among many, reach not thine hand out first of all. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;A very little is sufficient for a man well nurtured, and he fetcheth not his wind short upon his bed. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Sound sleep cometh of moderate eating: he riseth early, and his wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and choler, and pangs of the belly, are with an unsatiable man. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And if thou hast been forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit, and thou shalt have rest. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;My son, hear me, and despise me not, and at the last thou shalt find as I told thee: in all thy works be quick, so shall there no sickness come unto thee. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Whoso is liberal of his meat, men shall speak well of him; and the report of his good housekeeping will be believed. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But against him that is a niggard of his meat the whole city shall murmur; and the testimonies of his niggardness shall not be doubted of. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Shew not thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyed many. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: so doth wine the hearts of the proud by drunkeness. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately: what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made to make men glad. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of the heart, and cheerfulness of the mind: </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But wine drunken with excess maketh bitterness of the mind, with brawling and quarrelling. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till he offend: it diminisheth strength, and maketh wounds. </P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and despise him not in his mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press not upon him with urging him [to drink.] </P>
