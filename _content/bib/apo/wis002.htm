<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart: </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air, </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man cometh again. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us: </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered: </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;He was made to reprove our thoughts. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;As for the mysteries of God, they kn ew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward for blameless souls. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it. </P>
