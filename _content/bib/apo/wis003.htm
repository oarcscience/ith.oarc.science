<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery, </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, and their hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their works unprofitable: </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked: </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for unto him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rooted out. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honour. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfort in the day of trial. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation. </P>
