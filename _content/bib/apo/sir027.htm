<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 27</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Many have sinned for a small matter; and he that seeketh for abundance will turn his eyes away. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;As a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones; so doth sin stick close between buying and selling. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord, his house shall soon be overthrown. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;As when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; so the filth of man in his talk. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The furnace proveth the potter's vessels; so the trial of man is in his reasoning. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed; so is the utterance of a conceit in the heart of man. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Praise no man before thou hearest him speak; for this is the trial of men. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, and put her on, as a glorious long robe. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The birds will resort unto their like; so will truth return unto them that practise in her. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;As the lion lieth in wait for the prey; so sin for them that work iniquity. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The discourse of a godly man is always with wisdom; but a fool changeth as the moon. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;If thou be among the indiscreet, observe the time; but be continually among men of understanding. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The discourse of fools is irksome, and their sport is the wantonness of sin. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair stand upright; and their brawls make one stop his ears. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The strife of the proud is bloodshedding, and their revilings are grievous to the ear. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou betrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbor. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as a roe escaped out of the snare. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling there may be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he that knoweth him will depart from him. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lord will hate him. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Whoso casteth a stone on high casteth it on his own head; and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he shall not know whence it cometh. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Mockery and reproach are from the proud; but vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them. </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Malice and wrath, even these are abominations; and the sinful man shall have them both. </P>
