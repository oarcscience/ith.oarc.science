<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Wisdom lifteth up the head of him that is of low degree, and maketh him to sit among great men. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Commend not a man for his beauty; neither abhor a man for his outward appearance. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The bee is little among such as fly; but her fruit is the chief of sweet things. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Boast not of thy clothing and raiment, and exalt not thyself in the day of honour: for the works of the Lord are wonderful, and his works among men are hidden. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Many kings have sat down upon the ground; and one that was never thought of hath worn the crown. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced; and the honourable delivered into other men's hands. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Blame not before thou hast examined the truth: understand first, and then rebuke. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Answer not before thou hast heard the cause: neither interrupt men in the midst of their talk. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Strive not in a matter that concerneth thee not; and sit not in judgment with sinners. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;My son, meddle not with many matters: for if thou meddle much, thou shalt not be innocent; and if thou follow after, thou shalt not obtain, neither shalt thou escape by fleeing. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;There is one that laboureth, and taketh pains, and maketh haste, and is so much the more behind. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Again, there is another that is slow, and hath need of help, wanting ability, and full of poverty; yet the eye of the Lord looked upon him for good, and set him up from his low estate, </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And lifted up his head from misery; so that many that saw from him is peace over all the </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Prosperity and adversity, life and death, poverty and riches, come of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the law, are of the Lord: love, and the way of good works, are from him. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Error and darkness had their beginning together with sinners: and evil shall wax old with them that glory therein. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The gift of the Lord remaineth with the ungodly, and his favour bringeth prosperity for ever. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and pinching, and this his the portion of his reward: </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Whereas he saith, I have found rest, and now will eat continually of my goods; and yet he knoweth not what time shall come upon him, and that he must leave those things to others, and die. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Be stedfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and wax old in thy work. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Marvel not at the works of sinners; but trust in the Lord, and abide in thy labour: for it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord on the sudden to make a poor man rich. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of the godly, and suddenly he maketh his blessing flourish. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Say not, What profit is there of my service? and what good things shall I have hereafter? </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Again, say not, I have enough, and possess many things, and what evil shall I have hereafter? </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;In the day of prosperity there is a forgetfulness of affliction: and in the day of affliction there is no more remembrance of prosperity. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For it is an easy thing unto the Lord in the day of death to reward a man according to his ways. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;The affliction of an hour maketh a man forget pleasure: and in his end his deeds shall be discovered. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Judge none blessed before his death: for a man shall be known in his children. </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Bring not every man into thine house: for the deceitful man hath many trains. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Like as a partridge taken [and kept] in a cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as a spy, watcheth he for thy fall: </P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For he lieth in wait, and turneth good into evil, and in things worthy praise will lay blame upon thee. </P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled: and a sinful man layeth wait for blood. </P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Take heed of a mischievous man, for he worketh wickedness; lest he bring upon thee a perpetual blot. </P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will disturb thee, and turn thee out of thine own. </P>
