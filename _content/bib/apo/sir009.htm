<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, and teach her not an evil lesson against thyself. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Give not thy soul unto a woman to set her foot upon thy substance. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Meet not with an harlot, lest thou fall into her snares. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lest thou be taken with her attempts. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Gaze not on a maid, that thou fall not by those things that are precious in her. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Give not thy soul unto harlots, that thou lose not thine inheritance. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Look not round about thee in the streets of the city, neither wander thou in the solitary place thereof. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Turn away thine eye from a beautiful woman, and look not upon another's beauty; for many have been deceived by the beauty of a woman; for herewith love is kindled as a fire. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Sit not at all with another man's wife, nor sit down with her in thine arms, and spend not thy money with her at the wine; lest thine heart incline unto her, and so through thy desire thou fall into destruction. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Forsake not an old friend; for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old, thou shalt drink it with pleasure. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Envy not the glory of a sinner: for thou knowest not what shall be his end. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Delight not in the thing that the ungodly have pleasure in; but remember they shall not go unpunished unto their grave. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill; so shalt thou not doubt the fear of death: and if thou come unto him, make no fault, lest he take away thy life presently: remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that thou walkest upon the battlements of the city. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;As near as thou canst, guess at thy neighbour, and consult with the wise. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Let thy talk be with the wise, and all thy communication in the law of the most High. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And let just men eat and drink with thee; and let thy glorying be in the fear of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For the hand of the artificer the work shall be commended: and the wise ruler of the people for his speech. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;A man of an ill tongue is dangerous in his city; and he that is rash in his talk shall be hated. </P>
