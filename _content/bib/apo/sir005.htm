<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Set thy heart upon thy goods; and say not, I have enough for my life. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, to walk in the ways of thy heart: </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And say not, Who shall controul me for my works? for the Lord will surely revenge thy pride. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Say not, I have sinned, and what harm hath happened unto me? for the Lord is longsuffering, he will in no wise let thee go. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Concerning propitiation, be not without fear to add sin unto sin: </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And say not His mercy is great; he will be pacified for the multitude of my sins: for mercy and wrath come from him, and his indignation resteth upon sinners. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day: for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy security thou shalt be destroyed, and perish in the day of vengeance. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Set not thine heart upon goods unjustly gotten, for they shall not profit thee in the day of calamity. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so doth the sinner that hath a double tongue. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Be stedfast in thy understanding; and let thy word be the same. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and with patience give answer. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbour; if not, lay thy hand upon thy mouth. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Honour and shame is in talk: and the tongue of man is his fall. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Be not called a whisperer, and lie not in wait with thy tongue: for a foul shame is upon the thief, and an evil condemnation upon the double tongue. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Be not ignorant of any thing in a great matter or a small. </P>
