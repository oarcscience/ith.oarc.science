<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 21</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more, but ask pardon for thy former sins. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest too near it, it will bite thee: the teeth thereof are as the teeth of a lion, slaying the souls of men. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;All iniquity is as a two edged sword, the wounds whereof cannot be healed. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;To terrify and do wrong will waste riches: thus the house of proud men shall be made desolate. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;A prayer out of a poor man's mouth reacheth to the ears of God, and his judgment cometh speedily. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He that hateth to be reproved is in the way of sinners: but he that feareth the Lord will repent from his heart. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;An eloquent man is known far and near; but a man of understanding knoweth when he slippeth. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He that buildeth his house with other men's money is like one that gathereth himself stones for the tomb of his burial. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The congregation of the wicked is like tow wrapped together: and the end of them is a flame of fire to destroy them. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He that keepeth the law of the Lord getteth the understanding thereof: and the perfection of the fear of the Lord is wisdom. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;He that is not wise will not be taught: but there is a wisdom which multiplieth bitterness. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood: and his counsel is like a pure fountain of life. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he liveth. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;If a skilful man hear a wise word, he will commend it, and add unto it: but as soon as one of no understanding heareth it, it displeaseth him, and he casteth it behind his back. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but grace shall be found in the lips of the wise. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;They enquire at the mouth of the wise man in the congregation, and they shall ponder his words in their heart. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;As is a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: and the knowledge of the unwise is as talk without sense. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Doctrine unto fools is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;A fool lifteth up his voice with laughter; but a wise man doth scarce smile a little. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Learning is unto a wise man as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;A foolish man's foot is soon in his [neighbour's] house: but a man of experience is ashamed of him. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;A fool will peep in at the door into the house: but he that is well nurtured will stand without. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;It is the rudeness of a man to hearken at the door: but a wise man will be grieved with the disgrace. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;The lips of talkers will be telling such things as pertain not unto them: but the words of such as have understanding are weighed in the balance. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The heart of fools is in their mouth: but the mouth of the wise is in their heart. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;When the ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth his own soul. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;A whisperer defileth his own soul, and is hated wheresoever he dwelleth. </P>
