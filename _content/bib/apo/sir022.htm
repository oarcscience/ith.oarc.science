<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 22</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;A slothful man is compared to a filthy stone, and every one will hiss him out to his disgrace. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill: every man that takes it up will shake his hand. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;An evilnurtured man is the dishonour of his father that begat him: and a [foolish] daughter is born to his loss. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband: but she that liveth dishonestly is her father's heaviness. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;She that is bold dishonoureth both her father and her husband, but they both shall despise her. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;A tale out of season [is as] musick in mourning: but stripes and correction of wisdom are never out of time. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Whoso teacheth a fool is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He that telleth a tale to a fool speaketh to one in a slumber: when he hath told his tale, he will say, What is the matter? </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;If children live honestly, and have wherewithal, they shall cover the baseness of their parents. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But children, being haughty, through disdain and want of nurture do stain the nobility of their kindred. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Weep for the dead, for he hath lost the light: and weep for the fool, for he wanteth understanding: make little weeping for the dead, for he is at rest: but the life of the fool is worse than death. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Seven days do men mourn for him that is dead; but for a fool and an ungodly man all the days of his life. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Talk not much with a fool, and go not to him that hath no understanding: beware of him, lest thou have trouble, and thou shalt never be defiled with his fooleries: depart from him, and thou shalt find rest, and never be disquieted with madness. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;What is heavier than lead? and what is the name thereof, but a fool? </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear, than a man without understanding. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;As timber girt and bound together in a building cannot be loosed with shaking: so the heart that is stablished by advised counsel shall fear at no time. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;A heart settled upon a thought of understanding is as a fair plaistering on the wall of a gallery. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Pales set on an high place will never stand against the wind: so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool cannot stand against any fear. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He that pricketh the eye will make tears to fall: and he that pricketh the heart maketh it to shew her knowledge. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Whoso casteth a stone at the birds frayeth them away: and he that upbraideth his friend breaketh friendship. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despair not: for there may be a returning [to favour.] </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, fear not; for there may be a reconciliation: except for upbraiding, or pride, or disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for for these things every friend will depart. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Be faithful to thy neighbour in his poverty, that thou mayest rejoice in his prosperity: abide stedfast unto him in the time of his trouble, that thou mayest be heir with him in his heritage: for a mean estate is not always to be contemned: nor the rich that is foolish to be had in admiration. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;As the vapour and smoke of a furnace goeth before the fire; so reviling before blood. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;I will not be ashamed to defend a friend; neither will I hide myself from him. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And if any evil happen unto me by him, every one that heareth it will beware of him. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not suddenly by them, and that my tongue destroy me not? </P>
