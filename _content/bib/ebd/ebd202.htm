<P><A NAME="000"><B>Jehovah-jireh</B></A>     Jehovah will see; i.e., will provide, the name given by Abraham to the scene of his offering up the ram which was caught in the thicket on Mount Moriah. The expression used in <A HREF="../kjv/gen022.htm#014">Gen 22:14</A>, &quot;in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen,&quot; has been regarded as equivalent to the saying, &quot;Man's extremity is God's opportunity.&quot;

</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Jehovah-shalom</B></A>     Jehovah send peace, the name which Gideon gave to the altar he erected on the spot at Ophrah where the angel appeared to him (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg006.htm#024">Jdg 6:24</A>).

The son of Shomer, one of the two conspirators who put king Jehoash to death in Millo in Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2012.htm#021">Kg2 12:21</A>). (3.) <A HREF="../kjv/ch2017.htm#018">Ch2 17:18</A>.

<P><A NAME="006"><B>Jehozadak</B></A>     Jehovah-justified, the son of the high priest Seraiah at the time of the Babylonian exile (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1006.htm#014">Ch1 6:14</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch1006.htm#015">Ch1 6:15</A>). He was carried into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar, and probably died in Babylon. He was the father of Jeshua, or Joshua, who returned with Zerubbabel. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Jehu</B></A>     Jehovah is he.     (1.) The son of Obed, and father of Azariah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1002.htm#038">Ch1 2:38</A>). (2.) One of the Benjamite slingers that joined David at Ziklag (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1012.htm#003">Ch1 12:3</A>). (3.) The son of Hanani, a prophet of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1016.htm#001">Kg1 16:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg1016.htm#007">Kg1 16:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2019.htm#002">Ch2 19:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2020.htm#034">Ch2 20:34</A>), who pronounced the sentence of God against Baasha, the king of Israel. (4.) King of Israel, the son of Jehoshaphat (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2009.htm#002">Kg2 9:2</A>), and grandson of Nimshi. The story of his exaltation to the throne is deeply interesting. During the progress of a war against the Syrians, who were becoming more and more troublesome to Israel, in a battle at Ramoth-gilead Jehoram, the king of Israel, had been wounded; and leaving his army there, had returned to Jezreel, whither his ally, Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also gone on a visit of sympathy with him (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2008.htm#028">Kg2 8:28</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg2008.htm#029">Kg2 8:29</A>). The commanders, being left in charge of the conduct of the war, met in council; and while engaged in their deliberations, a messenger from Elisha appeared in the camp, and taking Jehu from the council, led him into a secret chamber, and there anointed him king over Israel, and immediately retired and disappeared (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2009.htm#005">Kg2 9:5</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg2009.htm#006">Kg2 9:6</A>). On being interrogated by his companions as to the object of this mysterious visitor, he informed them of what had been done, when immediately, with the utmost enthusiasm, they blew their trumpets and proclaimed him king (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2009.htm#011">Kg2 9:11</A>). He then with a chosen band set forth with all speed to Jezreel, where, with his own hand, he slew Jehoram, shooting him through the heart with an arrow (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2009.htm#024">Kg2 9:24</A>). The king of Judah, when trying to escape, was fatally wounded by one of Jehu's soldiers at Beth-gan. On entering the city, Jehu commanded the eunuchs of the royal palace to cast down Jezebel into the street, where her mangled body was trodden under foot by the horses. Jehu was now master of Jezreel, whence he communicated with the persons in authority in Samaria the capital, commanding them to appear before him on the morrow with the heads of all the royal princes of Samaria. Accordingly on the morrow seventy heads were piled up in two heaps at his gate. At &quot;the shearing-house&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2010.htm#012">Kg2 10:12</A>) other forty-two connected with the house of Ahab were put to death (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2010.htm#014">Kg2 10:14</A>). As Jehu rode on toward Samaria, he met Jehonadab (q.v.), whom he took into his chariot, and they entered the capital together. By a cunning stratagem he cut off all the worshippers of Baal found in Samaria (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2010.htm#019">Kg2 10:19</A>), and destroyed the temple of the idol (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2010.htm#027">Kg2 10:27</A>). Notwithstanding all this apparent zeal for the worship of Jehovah, Jehu yet tolerated the worship of the golden calves at Dan and Bethel. For this the divine displeasure rested upon him, and his kingdom suffered disaster in war with the Syrians (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2010.htm#029">Kg2 10:29</A>). He died after a reign of twenty-eight years (884-856 B.C.), and was buried in Samaria (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2010.htm#034">Kg2 10:34</A>). &quot;He was one of those decisive, terrible, and ambitious, yet prudent, calculating, and passionless men whom God from time to time raises up to change the fate of empires and execute his judgments on the earth.&quot; He was the first Jewish king who came in contact with the Assyrian power in the time of Shalmaneser II. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Jehucal</B></A>     Able, the son of Shelemiah. He is also called Jucal (<A HREF="../kjv/jer038.htm#001">Jer 38:1</A>). He was one of the two persons whom Zedekiah sent to request the prophet Jeremiah to pray for the kingdom (<A HREF="../kjv/jer037.htm#003">Jer 37:3</A>) during the time of its final siege by Nebuchadnezzar. He was accompanied by Zephaniah (q.v.). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Jehudi</B></A>     A Jew, son of Nethaniah. He was sent by the princes to invite Baruch to read Jeremiah's roll to them (<A HREF="../kjv/jer036.htm#014">Jer 36:14</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jer036.htm#021">Jer 36:21</A>).
