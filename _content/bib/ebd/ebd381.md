<span id="000">**Wheat**</span> One of the earliest cultivated grains.
It bore the Hebrew name hittah, and was extensively cultivated in
Palestine. There are various species of wheat. That which Pharaoh saw in
his dream was the Triticum compositum, which bears several ears upon one
stalk ([Gen 41:5](../kjv/gen041.htm#005)). The "fat of the kidneys of
wheat" ([Deu 32:14](../kjv/deu032.htm#014)), and the "finest of the
wheat" ([Psa 81:16](../kjv/psa081.htm#016); [Psa
147:14](../kjv/psa147.htm#014)), denote the best of the kind. It was
exported from Palestine in great quantities ([Kg1
5:11](../kjv/kg1005.htm#011); [Eze 27:17](../kjv/eze027.htm#017); [Act
12:20](../kjv/act012.htm#020)). Parched grains of wheat were used for
food in Palestine ([Rut 2:14](../kjv/rut002.htm#014); [Sa1
17:17](../kjv/sa1017.htm#017); [Sa2 17:28](../kjv/sa2017.htm#028)). The
disciples, under the sanction of the Mosaic law ([Deu
23:25](../kjv/deu023.htm#025)), plucked ears of corn, and rubbing them
in their hands, ate the grain unroasted ([Mat
12:1](../kjv/mat012.htm#001); [Mar 2:23](../kjv/mar002.htm#023); [Luk
6:1](../kjv/luk006.htm#001)). Before any of the wheat-harvest, however,
could be eaten, the first-fruits had to be presented before the Lord
([Lev 23:14](../kjv/lev023.htm#014)).

<span id="001">**Wheel**</span> (Heb. galgal ; rendered "wheel" in [Psa
83:13](../kjv/psa083.htm#013), and "a rolling thing" in [Isa
17:13](../kjv/isa017.htm#013); R.V. in both, "whirling dust"). This word
has been supposed to mean the wild artichoke, which assumes the form of
a globe, and in autumn breaks away from its roots, and is rolled about
by the wind in some places in great numbers.

<span id="002">**White**</span> A symbol of purity ([Ch2
5:12](../kjv/ch2005.htm#012); [Psa 51:7](../kjv/psa051.htm#007); [Isa
1:18](../kjv/isa001.htm#018); [Rev 3:18](../kjv/rev003.htm#018); [Rev
7:14](../kjv/rev007.htm#014)). Our Lord, at his transfiguration,
appeared in raiment "white as the light" ([Mat
17:2](../kjv/mat017.htm#002), etc.).

<span id="003">**Widows**</span> To be treated with kindness ([Exo
22:22](../kjv/exo022.htm#022); [Deu 14:29](../kjv/deu014.htm#029); [Deu
16:11](../kjv/deu016.htm#011), [Deu 16:14](../kjv/deu016.htm#014); [Deu
24:17](../kjv/deu024.htm#017), [Deu 24:19](../kjv/deu024.htm#019); [Deu
26:12](../kjv/deu026.htm#012); [Deu 27:19](../kjv/deu027.htm#019),
etc.). In the New Testament the same tender regard for them is
inculcated ([Act 6:1](../kjv/act006.htm#001); [Ti1
5:3](../kjv/ti1005.htm#003)) and exhibited.

<span id="004">**Wife**</span> The ordinance of marriage was sanctioned
in Paradise ([Gen 2:24](../kjv/gen002.htm#024); [Mat
19:4](../kjv/mat019.htm#004)). Monogamy was the original law under which
man lived, but polygamy early commenced ([Gen
4:19](../kjv/gen004.htm#019)), and continued to prevail all down through
Jewish history. The law of Moses regulated but did not prohibit
polygamy. A man might have a plurality of wives, but a wife could have
only one husband. A wife's legal rights ([Exo
21:10](../kjv/exo021.htm#010)) and her duties (Prov. 31:10-31; [Ti1
5:14](../kjv/ti1005.htm#014)) are specified. She could be divorced in
special cases ([Deu 22:13](../kjv/deu022.htm#013)), but could not
divorce her husband. Divorce was restricted by our Lord to the single
case of adultery ([Mat 19:3](../kjv/mat019.htm#003)). The duties of
husbands and wives in their relations to each other are distinctly set
forth in the New Testament ([Co1 7:2](../kjv/co1007.htm#002); [Eph
5:22](../kjv/eph005.htm#022); [Col 3:18](../kjv/col003.htm#018), [Col
3:19](../kjv/col003.htm#019); [Pe1 3:1](../kjv/pe1003.htm#001)).

<span id="005">**Wilderness**</span> (1.) Heb. midhbar , denoting not a
barren desert but a district or region suitable for pasturing sheep and
cattle ([Psa 65:12](../kjv/psa065.htm#012); [Isa
42:11](../kjv/isa042.htm#011); [Jer 23:10](../kjv/jer023.htm#010); [Joe
1:19](../kjv/joe001.htm#019); [Joe 2:22](../kjv/joe002.htm#022)); an
uncultivated place. This word is used of the wilderness of Beersheba
([Gen 21:14](../kjv/gen021.htm#014)), on the southern border of
Palestine; the wilderness of the Red Sea ([Exo
13:18](../kjv/exo013.htm#018)); of Shur ([Exo
15:22](../kjv/exo015.htm#022)), a portion of the Sinaitic peninsula; of
Sin ([Exo 17:1](../kjv/exo017.htm#001)), Sinai ([Lev
7:38](../kjv/lev007.htm#038)), Moab ([Deu 2:8](../kjv/deu002.htm#008)),
Judah ([Jdg 1:16](../kjv/jdg001.htm#016)), Ziph, Maon, En-gedi ([Sa1
23:14](../kjv/sa1023.htm#014), [Sa1 23:24](../kjv/sa1023.htm#024); [Sa1
24:1](../kjv/sa1024.htm#001)), Jeruel and Tekoa ([Ch2
20:16](../kjv/ch2020.htm#016), [Ch2 20:20](../kjv/ch2020.htm#020)),
Kadesh ([Psa 29:8](../kjv/psa029.htm#008)). "The wilderness of the sea"
([Isa 21:1](../kjv/isa021.htm#001)). Principal Douglas, referring to
this expression, says: "A mysterious name, which must be meant to
describe Babylon (see especially [Isa 21:9](../kjv/isa021.htm#009)),
perhaps because it became the place of discipline to God's people, as
the wilderness of the Red Sea had been (compare [Eze
20:35](../kjv/eze020.htm#035)). Otherwise it is in contrast with the
symbolic title in [Isa 22:1](../kjv/isa022.htm#001). Jerusalem is the
"valley of vision," rich in spiritual husbandry; whereas Babylon, the
rival centre of influence, is spiritually barren and as restless as the
sea (compare [Isa 57:20](../kjv/isa057.htm#020))." A Short Analysis of
the O.T. (2.) Jeshimon , a desert waste ([Deu
32:10](../kjv/deu032.htm#010); [Psa 68:7](../kjv/psa068.htm#007)). (3.)
'Arabah , the name given to the valley from the Dead Sea to the eastern
branch of the Red Sea. In [Deu 1:1](../kjv/deu001.htm#001); [Deu
2:8](../kjv/deu002.htm#008), it is rendered "plain" (R.V., "Arabah").
(4.) Tziyyah , a "dry place" ([Psa 78:17](../kjv/psa078.htm#017); [Psa
105:41](../kjv/psa105.htm#041)). (5.) Tohu , a "desolate" place, a place
"waste" or "unoccupied" ([Deu 32:10](../kjv/deu032.htm#010); [Job
12:24](../kjv/job012.htm#024); compare [Gen 1:2](../kjv/gen001.htm#002),
"without form"). The wilderness region in the Sinaitic peninsula through
which for forty years the Hebrews wandered is generally styled "the
wilderness of the wanderings." This entire region is in the form of a
triangle, having its base toward the north and its apex toward the
south. Its extent from north to south is about 250 miles, and at its
widest point it is about 150 miles broad. Throughout this vast region of
some 1,500 square miles there is not a single river. The northern part
of this triangular peninsula is properly the "wilderness of the
wanderings" ( et-Tih ). The western portion of it is called the
"wilderness of Shur" ([Exo 15:22](../kjv/exo015.htm#022)), and the
eastern the "wilderness of Paran." The "wilderness of Judaea" ([Mat
3:1](../kjv/mat003.htm#001)) is a wild, barren region, lying between the
Dead Sea and the Hebron Mountains. It is the "Jeshimon" mentioned in
[Sa1 23:19](../kjv/sa1023.htm#019).

<span id="006">**Willows**</span> (1.) Heb. 'arabim ([Lev
23:40](../kjv/lev023.htm#040); [Job 40:22](../kjv/job040.htm#022); [Isa
15:7](../kjv/isa015.htm#007); [Isa 44:3](../kjv/isa044.htm#003), [Isa
44:4](../kjv/isa044.htm#004); [Psa 137:1](../kjv/psa137.htm#001), [Psa
137:2](../kjv/psa137.htm#002)). This was supposed to be the weeping
willow, called by Linnaeus Salix Babylonica, from the reference in [Psa
137:1](../kjv/psa137.htm#001). This tree is frequently found "on the
coast, overhanging wells and pools. There is a conspicuous tree of this
species over a pond in the plain of Acre, and others on the Phoenician
plain." There are several species of the salix in Palestine, but it is
not indigenous to Babylonia, nor was it cultivated there. Some are of
opinion that the tree intended is the tamarisk or poplar. (2.) Heb.
tzaphtzaphah ([Eze 17:5](../kjv/eze017.htm#005)), called by the Arabs
the safsaf , the general name for the willow. This may be the Salix
Aegyptica of naturalists. Tristram thinks that by the "willow by the
water-courses," the Nerium oleander, the rose-bay oleander, is meant. He
says, "It fringes the Upper Jordan, dipping its wavy crown of red into
the spray in the rapids under Hermon, and is nurtured by the oozy
marshes in the Lower Jordan nearly as far as to Jericho.... On the
Arnon, on the Jabbok, and the Yarmuk it forms a continuous fringe. In
many of the streams of Moab it forms a complete screen, which the sun's
rays can never penetrate to evaporate the precious moisture. The wild
boar lies safely ensconced under its impervious cover."

<span id="007">**Wimple**</span> [Isa 3:22](../kjv/isa003.htm#022),
(R.V., "shawls"), a wrap or veil. The same Hebrew word is rendered
"vail" (R.V., "mantle") in [Rut 3:15](../kjv/rut003.htm#015).

<span id="008">**Window**</span> Properly only an opening in a house for
the admission of light and air, covered with lattice-work, which might
be opened or closed ([Kg2 1:2](../kjv/kg2001.htm#002); [Act
20:9](../kjv/act020.htm#009)). The spies in Jericho and Paul at Damascus
were let down from the windows of houses abutting on the town wall ([Jos
2:15](../kjv/jos002.htm#015); [Co2 11:33](../kjv/co2011.htm#033)). The
clouds are metaphorically called the "windows of heaven" ([Gen
7:11](../kjv/gen007.htm#011); [Mal 3:10](../kjv/mal003.htm#010)). The
word thus rendered in [Isa 54:12](../kjv/isa054.htm#012) ought rather to
be rendered "battlements" (LXX., "bulwarks;" R.V., "pinnacles"), or as
Gesenius renders it, "notched battlements, i.e., suns or rays of the
sun" = having a radiated appearance like the sun.

<span id="009">**Winds**</span> Blowing from the four quarters of heaven
([Jer 49:36](../kjv/jer049.htm#036); [Eze 37:9](../kjv/eze037.htm#009);
[Dan 8:8](../kjv/dan008.htm#008); [Zac 2:6](../kjv/zac002.htm#006)). The
east wind was parching ([Eze 17:10](../kjv/eze017.htm#010); [Eze
19:12](../kjv/eze019.htm#012)), and is sometimes mentioned as simply
denoting a strong wind ([Job 27:21](../kjv/job027.htm#021); [Isa
27:8](../kjv/isa027.htm#008)). This wind prevails in Palestine from
February to June, as the west wind ([Luk 12:54](../kjv/luk012.htm#054))
does from November to February. The south was a hot wind ([Job
37:17](../kjv/job037.htm#017); [Luk 12:55](../kjv/luk012.htm#055)). It
swept over the Arabian peninsula. The rush of invaders is figuratively
spoken of as a whirlwind ([Isa 21:1](../kjv/isa021.htm#001)); a
commotion among the nations of the world as a striving of the four winds
([Dan 7:2](../kjv/dan007.htm#002)). The winds are subject to the divine
power ([Psa 18:10](../kjv/psa018.htm#010); [Psa
135:7](../kjv/psa135.htm#007)).
