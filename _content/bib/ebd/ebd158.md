<span id="000">**Hadlai**</span> Resting, an Ephraimite; the father of
Amasa, mentioned in [Ch2 28:12](../kjv/ch2028.htm#012).

<span id="001">**Hadoram**</span> Is exalted. (1.) The son of Tou, king
of Hamath, sent by his father to congratulate David on his victory over
Hadarezer, king of Syria ([Ch1 18:10](../kjv/ch1018.htm#010); called
Joram [Sa2 8:10](../kjv/sa2008.htm#010)). (2.) The fifth son of Joktan,
the founder of an Arab tribe ([Gen 10:27](../kjv/gen010.htm#027); [Ch1
1:21](../kjv/ch1001.htm#021)). (3.) One who was "over the tribute;"
i.e., "over the levy." He was stoned by the Israelites after they had
revolted from Rehoboam ([Ch2 10:18](../kjv/ch2010.htm#018)). Called also
Adoram ([Sa2 20:24](../kjv/sa2020.htm#024)) and Adoniram ([Kg1
4:6](../kjv/kg1004.htm#006)).

<span id="002">**Hadrach**</span> The name of a country ([Zac
9:1](../kjv/zac009.htm#001)) which cannot be identified. Rawlinson would
identify it with Edessa. He mentions that in the Assyrian inscriptions
it is recorded that "Shalmanezer III. made two expeditions, the first
against Damascus 773 B.C., and the second against Hadrach 772 B.C.; and
again that Asshurdanin-il II. made expeditions against Hadrach in 765
B.C. and 755 B.C.."

<span id="003">**Haemorrhoids**</span> Or Emerods, bleeding piles known
to the ancient Romans as mariscce, but more probably malignant boils of
an infectious and fatal character. With this loathsome and infectious
disease the men of Ashdod were smitten by the hand of the Lord. This
calamity they attributed to the presence of the ark in their midst, and
therefore they removed it to Gath ([Sa1 5:6](../kjv/sa1005.htm#006)).
But the same consequences followed from its presence in Gath, and
therefore they had it removed to Ekron, 11 miles distant. The Ekronites
were afflicted with the same dreadful malady, but more severely; and a
panic seizing the people, they demanded that the ark should be sent back
to the land of Israel ([Sa1 5:9](../kjv/sa1005.htm#009); [Sa1
6:1](../kjv/sa1006.htm#001)).

<span id="004">**Haft**</span> A handle as of a dagger ([Jdg
3:22](../kjv/jdg003.htm#022)).

<span id="005">**Hagar**</span> Flight, or, according to others,
stranger, an Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid ([Gen
16:1](../kjv/gen016.htm#001); [Gen 21:9](../kjv/gen021.htm#009), [Gen
21:10](../kjv/gen021.htm#010)), whom she gave to Abraham (q.v.) as a
secondary wife ([Gen 16:2](../kjv/gen016.htm#002)). When she was about
to become a mother she fled from the cruelty of her mistress, intending
apparently to return to her relatives in Egypt, through the desert of
Shur, which lay between. Wearied and worn she had reached the place she
distinguished by the name of Beer-lahai-roi ("the well of the visible
God"), where the angel of the Lord appeared to her. In obedience to the
heavenly visitor she returned to the tent of Abraham, where her son
Ishmael was born, and where she remained (Gen. 16) till after the birth
of Isaac, the space of fourteen years. Sarah after this began to vent
her dissatisfaction both on Hagar and her child. Ishmael's conduct was
insulting to Sarah, and she insisted that he and his mother should be
dismissed. This was accordingly done, although with reluctance on the
part of Abraham ([Gen 21:14](../kjv/gen021.htm#014)). They wandered out
into the wilderness, where Ishmael, exhausted with his journey and faint
from thirst, seemed about to die. Hagar "lifted up her voice and wept,"
and the angel of the Lord, as before, appeared unto her, and she was
comforted and delivered out of her distresses ([Gen
21:18](../kjv/gen021.htm#018), [Gen 21:19](../kjv/gen021.htm#019)).
Ishmael afterwards established himself in the wilderness of Paran, where
he married an Egyptian ([Gen 21:20](../kjv/gen021.htm#020), [Gen
21:21](../kjv/gen021.htm#021)). "Hagar" allegorically represents the
Jewish church ([Gal 4:24](../kjv/gal004.htm#024)), in bondage to the
ceremonial law; while "Sarah" represents the Christian church, which is
free.

<span id="006">**Hagarene**</span> Or Hagarite, (1.) One of David's
mighty men ([Ch1 11:38](../kjv/ch1011.htm#038)), the son of a foreigner.
(2.) Used of Jaziz ([Ch1 27:31](../kjv/ch1027.htm#031)), who was over
David's flocks. "A Hagarite had charge of David's flocks, and an
Ishmaelite of his herds, because the animals were pastured in districts
where these nomadic people were accustomed to feed their cattle." (3.)
In the reign of Saul a great war was waged between the trans-Jordanic
tribes and the Hagarites (1 Chr. 5), who were overcome in battle. A
great booty was captured by the two tribes and a half, and they took
possession of the land of the Hagarites. Subsequently the "Hagarenes,"
still residing in the land on the east of Jordan, entered into a
conspiracy against Israel (compare [Psa 83:6](../kjv/psa083.htm#006)).
They are distinguished from the Ishmaelites.

<span id="007">**Hagagi**</span> Festive, one of the twelve so-called
minor prophets. He was the first of the three (Zechariah, his
contemporary, and Malachi, who was about one hundred years later, being
the other two) whose ministry belonged to the period of Jewish history
which began after the return from captivity in Babylon. Scarcely
anything is known of his personal history. He may have been one of the
captives taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. He began his ministry about
sixteen years after the Return. The work of rebuilding the temple had
been put a stop to through the intrigues of the Samaritans. After having
been suspended for fifteen years, the work was resumed through the
efforts of Haggai and Zechariah ([Ezr 6:14](../kjv/ezr006.htm#014)), who
by their exhortations roused the people from their lethargy, and induced
them to take advantage of the favourable opportunity that had arisen in
a change in the policy of the Persian government. (See DARIUS \[2\].)
Haggai's prophecies have thus been characterized: "There is a ponderous
and simple dignity in the emphatic reiteration addressed alike to every
class of the community, prince, priest, and people, 'Be strong, be
strong, be strong' ([Hag 2:4](../kjv/hag002.htm#004)). 'Cleave, stick
fast, to the work you have to do;' or again, 'Consider your ways,
consider, consider, consider' ([Hag 1:5](../kjv/hag001.htm#005), [Hag
1:7](../kjv/hag001.htm#007); [Hag 2:15](../kjv/hag002.htm#015), [Hag
2:18](../kjv/hag002.htm#018)). It is the Hebrew phrase for the
endeavour, characteristic of the gifted seers of all times, to compel
their hearers to turn the inside of their hearts outwards to their own
view, to take the mask from off their consciences, to 'see life
steadily, and to see it wholly.'" Stanley's Jewish Church. (See SIGNET.)

<span id="008">**Haggai, Book of**</span> Consists of two brief,
comprehensive chapters. The object of the prophet was generally to urge
the people to proceed with the rebuilding of the temple. Chapter first
comprehends the first address ([Hag 1:2](../kjv/hag001.htm#002)) and its
effects ([Hag 1:12](../kjv/hag001.htm#012)). Chapter second contains,
(1.) The second prophecy ([Hag 2:1](../kjv/hag002.htm#001)), which was
delivered a month after the first. (2.) The third prophecy ([Hag
2:10](../kjv/hag002.htm#010)), delivered two months and three days after
the second; and (3.) The fourth prophecy ([Hag
2:20](../kjv/hag002.htm#020)), delivered on the same day as the third.
These discourses are referred to in [Ezr 5:1](../kjv/ezr005.htm#001);
[Ezr 6:14](../kjv/ezr006.htm#014); [Heb 12:26](../kjv/heb012.htm#026).
(Compare [Hag 2:7](../kjv/hag002.htm#007), [Hag
2:8](../kjv/hag002.htm#008), [Hag 2:22](../kjv/hag002.htm#022).)

<span id="009">**Haggith**</span> Festive; the dancer, a wife of David
and the mother of Adonijah ([Sa2 3:4](../kjv/sa2003.htm#004); [Kg1
1:5](../kjv/kg1001.htm#005), [Kg1 1:11](../kjv/kg1001.htm#011); [Kg1
2:13](../kjv/kg1002.htm#013); [Ch1 3:2](../kjv/ch1003.htm#002)), who,
like Absalom, was famed for his beauty.
