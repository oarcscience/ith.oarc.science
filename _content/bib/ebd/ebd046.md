<span id="000">**Bartimaeus**</span> Son of Timaeus, one of the two
blind beggars of Jericho ([Mar 10:46](../kjv/mar010.htm#046); [Mat
20:30](../kjv/mat020.htm#030)). His blindness was miraculously cured on
the ground of his faith.

<span id="001">**Baruch**</span> Blessed. (1.) The secretary of the
prophet Jeremiah ([Jer 32:12](../kjv/jer032.htm#012); [Jer
36:4](../kjv/jer036.htm#004)). He was of the tribe of Judah ([Jer
51:59](../kjv/jer051.htm#059)). To him Jeremiah dictated his prophecies
regarding the invasion of the Babylonians and the Captivity. These he
read to the people from a window in the temple in the fourth year of the
reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah (Jer. 36). He afterwards read them
before the counsellors of the king at a private interview; and then to
the king himself, who, after hearing a part of the roll, cut it with a
penknife, and threw it into the fire of his winter parlour, where he was
sitting. During the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, he was the
keeper of the deed of purchase Jeremiah had made of the territory of
Hanameel ([Jer 32:12](../kjv/jer032.htm#012)). Being accused by his
enemies of favouring the Chaldeans, he was cast, with Jeremiah, into
prison, where he remained till the capture of Jerusalem (586 B.C.). He
probably died in Babylon. (2.) [Neh 3:20](../kjv/neh003.htm#020); [Neh
10:6](../kjv/neh010.htm#006); [Neh 11:5](../kjv/neh011.htm#005).

<span id="002">**Barzillai**</span> Of iron. (1.) A Meholathite, the
father of Adriel ([Sa2 21:8](../kjv/sa2021.htm#008)). (2.) A Gileadite
of Rogelim who was distinguished for his loyalty to David. He liberally
provided for the king's followers ([Sa2 17:27](../kjv/sa2017.htm#027)).
David on his death-bed, remembering his kindness, commended Barzillai's
children to the care of Solomon ([Kg1 2:7](../kjv/kg1002.htm#007)). (3.)
A priest who married a daughter of the preceding ([Ezr
2:61](../kjv/ezr002.htm#061)).

<span id="003">**Bashan**</span> Light soil, first mentioned in [Gen
14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005), where it is said that Chedorlaomer and his
confederates "smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth," where Og the king of
Bashan had his residence. At the time of Israel's entrance into the
Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly routed ([Num
21:33](../kjv/num021.htm#033); [Deu 3:1](../kjv/deu003.htm#001)). This
country extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and
from the Jordan on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half
of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh ([Jos
13:29](../kjv/jos013.htm#029)). Golan, one of its cities, became a "city
of refuge" ([Jos 21:27](../kjv/jos021.htm#027)). Argob, in Bashan, was
one of Solomon's commissariat districts ([Kg1
4:13](../kjv/kg1004.htm#013)). The cities of Bashan were taken by Hazael
([Kg2 10:33](../kjv/kg2010.htm#033)), but were soon after reconquered by
Jehoash ([Kg2 13:25](../kjv/kg2013.htm#025)), who overcame the Syrians
in three battles, according to the word of Elisha ([Kg2
13:19](../kjv/kg2013.htm#019)). From this time Bashan almost disappears
from history, although we read of the wild cattle of its rich pastures
([Eze 39:18](../kjv/eze039.htm#018); [Psa
22:12](../kjv/psa022.htm#012)), the oaks of its forests ([Isa
2:13](../kjv/isa002.htm#013); [Eze 27:6](../kjv/eze027.htm#006); [Zac
11:2](../kjv/zac011.htm#002)), and the beauty of its extensive plains
([Amo 4:1](../kjv/amo004.htm#001); [Jer 50:19](../kjv/jer050.htm#019)).
Soon after the conquest, the name "Gilead" was given to the whole
country beyond Jordan. After the Exile, Bashan was divided into four
districts, (1.) Gaulonitis, or Jaulan, the most western; (2.) Auranitis,
the Hauran ([Eze 47:16](../kjv/eze047.htm#016)); (3.) Argob or
Trachonitis, now the Lejah; and (4.) Batanaea, now Ard-el-Bathanyeh, on
the east of the Lejah, with many deserted towns almost as perfect as
when they were inhabited. (See HAURAN.)

<span id="004">**Bashan, Hill of**</span> ([Psa
68:15](../kjv/psa068.htm#015)), probably another name for Hermon, which
lies to the north of Bashan.

<span id="005">**Bashan-havoth-jair**</span> The Bashan of the villages
of Jair, the general name given to Argob by Jair, the son of Manasseh
([Deu 3:14](../kjv/deu003.htm#014)), containing sixty cities with walls
and brazen gates ([Jos 13:30](../kjv/jos013.htm#030); [Kg1
4:13](../kjv/kg1004.htm#013)). (See ARGOB.)

<span id="006">**Bashemath**</span> Sweet-smelling. (1.) The daughter of
Ishmael, the last of Esau's three wives ([Gen
36:3](../kjv/gen036.htm#003), [Gen 36:4](../kjv/gen036.htm#004), [Gen
36:13](../kjv/gen036.htm#013)), from whose son Reuel four tribes of the
Edomites sprung. She is also called Mahalath ([Gen
28:9](../kjv/gen028.htm#009)). It is noticeable that Esau's three wives
receive different names in the genealogical table of the Edomites (Gen.
36) from those given to them in the history ([Gen
26:34](../kjv/gen026.htm#034); [Gen 28:9](../kjv/gen028.htm#009)). (2.)
A daughter of Solomon, and wife of Ahimaaz, one of his officers ([Kg1
4:15](../kjv/kg1004.htm#015)).

<span id="007">**Basilisk**</span> (in R.V., [Isa
11:8](../kjv/isa011.htm#008); [Isa 14:29](../kjv/isa014.htm#029); [Isa
59:5](../kjv/isa059.htm#005); [Jer 8:17](../kjv/jer008.htm#017)), the
"king serpent," as the name imports; a fabulous serpent said to be three
spans long, with a spot on its head like a crown. Probably the yellow
snake is intended. (See COCKATRICE.)

<span id="008">**Basin**</span> Or Bason (1.) A trough or laver (Heb.
aggan' ) for washing ([Exo 24:6](../kjv/exo024.htm#006)); rendered also
"goblet" ([Sol 7:2](../kjv/sol007.htm#002)) and "cups" ([Isa
22:24](../kjv/isa022.htm#024)). (2.) A covered dish or urn (Heb. kefor )
among the vessels of the temple ([Ch1 28:17](../kjv/ch1028.htm#017);
[Ezr 1:10](../kjv/ezr001.htm#010); [Ezr 8:27](../kjv/ezr008.htm#027)).
(3.) A vase (Heb. mizrak ) from which to sprinkle anything. A metallic
vessel; sometimes rendered "bowl" ([Amo 6:6](../kjv/amo006.htm#006);
[Zac 9:15](../kjv/zac009.htm#015)). The vessels of the tabernacle were
of brass ([Exo 27:3](../kjv/exo027.htm#003)), while those of the temple
were of gold ([Ch2 4:8](../kjv/ch2004.htm#008)). (4.) A utensil (Heb.
saph ) for holding the blood of the victims ([Exo
12:22](../kjv/exo012.htm#022)); also a basin for domestic purposes ([Sa2
17:28](../kjv/sa2017.htm#028)). The various vessels spoken of by the
names "basin, bowl, charger, cup, and dish," cannot now be accurately
distinguished. The basin in which our Lord washed the disciples' feet
([Joh 13:5](../kjv/joh013.htm#005)) must have been larger and deeper
than the hand-basin.

<span id="009">**Basket**</span> There are five different Hebrew words
so rendered in the Authorized Version: (1.) A basket (Heb. sal , a twig
or osier) for holding bread ([Gen 40:16](../kjv/gen040.htm#016); [Exo
29:3](../kjv/exo029.htm#003), [Exo 29:23](../kjv/exo029.htm#023); [Lev
8:2](../kjv/lev008.htm#002), [Lev 8:26](../kjv/lev008.htm#026), [Lev
8:31](../kjv/lev008.htm#031); [Num 6:15](../kjv/num006.htm#015), [Num
6:17](../kjv/num006.htm#017), [Num 6:19](../kjv/num006.htm#019)).
Sometimes baskets were made of twigs peeled; their manufacture was a
recognized trade among the Hebrews. (2.) That used (Heb. salsilloth' )
in gathering grapes ([Jer 6:9](../kjv/jer006.htm#009)). (3.) That in
which the first fruits of the harvest were presented, Heb. tene , ([Deu
26:2](../kjv/deu026.htm#002), [Deu 26:4](../kjv/deu026.htm#004)). It was
also used for household purposes. In form it tapered downwards like that
called corbis by the Romans. (4.) A basket (Heb. kelub ) having a lid,
resembling a bird-cage. It was made of leaves or rushes. The name is
also applied to fruit-baskets ([Amo 8:1](../kjv/amo008.htm#001), [Amo
8:2](../kjv/amo008.htm#002)). (5.) A basket (Heb. dud ) for carrying
figs ([Jer 24:2](../kjv/jer024.htm#002)), also clay to the brick-yard
(R.V., [Psa 81:6](../kjv/psa081.htm#006)), and bulky articles ([Kg2
10:7](../kjv/kg2010.htm#007)). This word is also rendered in the
Authorized Version "kettle" ([Sa1 2:14](../kjv/sa1002.htm#014)),
"caldron" ([Ch2 35:13](../kjv/ch2035.htm#013)), "seething-pot" ([Job
41:20](../kjv/job041.htm#020)). In the New Testament mention is made of
the basket (Gr. kophinos , small "wicker-basket") for the "fragments" in
the miracle recorded [Mar 6:43](../kjv/mar006.htm#043), and in that
recorded [Mat 15:37](../kjv/mat015.htm#037) (Gr. spuris , large
"rope-basket"); also of the basket in which Paul escaped ([Act
9:25](../kjv/act009.htm#025), Gr. spuris ; [Co2
11:33](../kjv/co2011.htm#033), Gr. sargane , "basket of plaited cords").
