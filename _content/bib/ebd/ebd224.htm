<P><A NAME="000"><B>Laodicea, Epistle from</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/col004.htm#016">Col 4:16</A>), was probably the Epistle to the Ephesians, as designed for general circulation. It would reach the Colossians by way of Laodicea. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Lapidoth</B></A>     Torches. Deborah is called &quot;the wife of Lapidoth&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg004.htm#004">Jdg 4:4</A>). Some have rendered the expression &quot;a woman of a fiery spirit,&quot; under the supposition that Lapidoth is not a proper name, a woman of a torch-like spirit. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Lapping</B></A>     Of water like a dog, i.e., by putting the hand filled with water to the mouth. The dog drinks by shaping the end of his long thin tongue into the form of a spoon, thus rapidly lifting up water, which he throws into his mouth. The three hundred men that went with Gideon thus employed their hands and lapped the water out of their hands (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg007.htm#007">Jdg 7:7</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Lapwing</B></A>     The name of an unclean bird, mentioned only in <A HREF="../kjv/lev011.htm#019">Lev 11:19</A> and <A HREF="../kjv/deu014.htm#018">Deu 14:18</A>. The Hebrew name of this bird, dukiphath, has been generally regarded as denoting the hoope (Upupa epops), an onomatopoetic word derived from the cry of the bird, which resembles the word &quot;hoop;&quot; a bird not uncommon in Palestine. Others identify it with the English peewit. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Lasaea</B></A>     A city in the island of Crete (<A HREF="../kjv/act027.htm#008">Act 27:8</A>). Its ruins are still found near Cape Leonda, about 5 miles east of &quot;Fair Havens.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Lasha</B></A>     Fissure, a place apparently east of the Dead Sea (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#019">Gen 10:19</A>). It was afterwards known as Callirhoe, a place famous for its hot springs. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Latchet</B></A>     A thong (<A HREF="../kjv/act022.htm#025">Act 22:25</A>), cord, or strap fastening the sandal on the foot (<A HREF="../kjv/isa005.htm#027">Isa 5:27</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar001.htm#007">Mar 1:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk003.htm#016">Luk 3:16</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Latin</B></A>     The vernacular language of the ancient Romans (<A HREF="../kjv/joh019.htm#020">Joh 19:20</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Lattice</B></A>      (1.) Heb.  'eshnabh , a latticed opening through which the cool breeze passes (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg005.htm#028">Jdg 5:28</A>). The flat roofs of the houses were sometimes enclosed with a parapet of lattice-work on wooden frames, to screen the women of the house from the gaze of the neighbourhood. (2.) Heb.  harakim , the network or lattice of a window (<A HREF="../kjv/sol002.htm#009">Sol 2:9</A>). (3.) Heb.  sebakhah , the latticed balustrade before a window or balcony (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2001.htm#002">Kg2 1:2</A>). The lattice window is frequently used in Eastern countries. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Laver</B></A>     (Heb.  kiyor ), a &quot;basin&quot; for boiling in, a &quot;pan&quot; for cooking (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#014">Sa1 2:14</A>), a &quot;fire-pan&quot; or hearth (<A HREF="../kjv/zac012.htm#006">Zac 12:6</A>), the sacred wash-bowl of the tabernacle and temple (<A HREF="../kjv/exo030.htm#018">Exo 30:18</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo030.htm#028">Exo 30:28</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo031.htm#009">Exo 31:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo035.htm#016">Exo 35:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo038.htm#008">Exo 38:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo039.htm#039">Exo 39:39</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo040.htm#007">Exo 40:7</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo040.htm#011">Exo 40:11</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo040.htm#030">Exo 40:30</A>, etc.), a basin for the water used by the priests in their ablutions. That which was originally used in the tabernacle was of brass (rather copper; Heb.  nihsheth ), made from the metal mirrors the women brought out of Egypt (<A HREF="../kjv/exo038.htm#008">Exo 38:8</A>). It contained water wherewith the priests washed their hands and feet when they entered the tabernacle (<A HREF="../kjv/exo040.htm#032">Exo 40:32</A>). It stood in the court between the altar and the door of the tabernacle (<A HREF="../kjv/exo030.htm#019">Exo 30:19</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo030.htm#021">Exo 30:21</A>). In the temple there were ten lavers used for the sacrifices, and the molten sea for the ablutions of the priests (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2004.htm#006">Ch2 4:6</A>). The position and uses of these are described 1 Kings 7:23-39; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2004.htm#006">Ch2 4:6</A>. The &quot;molten sea&quot; was made of copper, taken from Tibhath and Chun, cities of Hadarezer, king of Zobah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1018.htm#008">Ch1 18:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg1007.htm#023">Kg1 7:23</A>). No lavers are mentioned in the second temple.
