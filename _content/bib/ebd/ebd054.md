<span id="000">**Besor**</span> Cold, a ravine or brook in the extreme
south-west of Judah, where 200 of David's men stayed behind because they
were faint, while the other 400 pursued the Amalekites ([Sa1
30:9](../kjv/sa1030.htm#009), [Sa1 30:10](../kjv/sa1030.htm#010), [Sa1
30:21](../kjv/sa1030.htm#021)). Probably the Wady Sheriah, south of
Gaza.

<span id="001">**Bestead**</span> The rendering in [Isa
8:21](../kjv/isa008.htm#021), where alone it occurs, of a Hebrew word
meaning to oppress, or be in circumstances of hardship.

<span id="002">**Betah**</span> Confidence, a city belonging to
Hadadezer, king of Zobah, which yielded much spoil of brass to David
([Sa2 8:8](../kjv/sa2008.htm#008)). In [Ch1 18:8](../kjv/ch1018.htm#008)
it is called Tibhath.

<span id="003">**Beth**</span> Occurs frequently as the appellation for
a house, or dwelling-place, in such compounds as the words immediately
following: Bethabara - house of the ford Beth-anath - house of response
Beth-anoth - house of answers Bethany - house of dates Beth-arabah -
house of the desert Beth-aram - house of the height Beth-arbel - house

<span id="004">**Bethabara**</span> House of the ford, a place on the
east bank of the Jordan, where John was baptizing ([Joh
1:28](../kjv/joh001.htm#028)). It may be identical with Bethbarah, the
ancient ford of Jordan of which the men of Ephraim took possession ([Jdg
7:24](../kjv/jdg007.htm#024)). The Revised Version reads "Bethany beyond
Jordan." It was the great ford, and still bears the name of "the ford,"
Makhadhet 'Abarah , "the ford of crossing over," about 25 miles from
Nazareth. (See BETH-BARAH.)

<span id="005">**Beth-anath**</span> House of response, one of the
fenced cities of Naphtali ([Jos 19:38](../kjv/jos019.htm#038)). It is
perhaps identical with the modern village 'Ainata , 6 miles west of
Kedesh.

<span id="006">**Beth-anoth**</span> House of answers, a city in the
mountainous district of Judah ([Jos 15:59](../kjv/jos015.htm#059)). It
has been identified with the modern Beit-'Anun , about 3 miles northeast
of Hebron.

<span id="007">**Bethany**</span> House of dates. (1.) The Revised
Version in [Joh 1:28](../kjv/joh001.htm#028) has this word instead of
Bethabara, on the authority of the oldest manuscripts. It appears to
have been the name of a place on the east of Jordan. (2.) A village on
the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives ([Mar
11:1](../kjv/mar011.htm#001)), about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, on the
road to Jericho. It derived its name from the number of palm-trees which
grew there. It was the residence of Lazarus and his sisters. It is
frequently mentioned in connection with memorable incidents in the life
of our Lord ([Mat 21:17](../kjv/mat021.htm#017); [Mat
26:6](../kjv/mat026.htm#006); [Mar 11:11](../kjv/mar011.htm#011), [Mar
11:12](../kjv/mar011.htm#012); [Mar 14:3](../kjv/mar014.htm#003); [Luk
24:50](../kjv/luk024.htm#050); [Joh 11:1](../kjv/joh011.htm#001); [Joh
12:1](../kjv/joh012.htm#001)). It is now known by the name of
el-Azariyeh, i.e., "place of Lazarus," or simply Lazariyeh. Seen from a
distance, the village has been described as "remarkably beautiful, the
perfection of retirement and repose, of seclusion and lovely peace." Now
a mean village, containing about twenty families.

<span id="008">**Beth-arabah**</span> House of the desert, one of the
six cities of Judah, situated in the sunk valley of the Jordan and Dead
Sea ([Jos 18:22](../kjv/jos018.htm#022)). In [Jos
15:61](../kjv/jos015.htm#061) it is said to have been "in the
wilderness." It was afterwards included in the towns of Benjamin. It is
called Arabah ([Jos 18:18](../kjv/jos018.htm#018)).

<span id="009">**Beth-aram**</span> House of the height; i.e.,
"mountain-house", one of the towns of Gad, 3 miles east of Jordan,
opposite Jericho ([Jos 13:27](../kjv/jos013.htm#027)). Probably the same
as Beth-haran in [Num 32:36](../kjv/num032.htm#036). It was called by
king Herod, Julias, or Livias, after Livia, the wife of Augustus. It is
now called Beit-haran.
