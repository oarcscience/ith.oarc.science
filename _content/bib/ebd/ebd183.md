<span id="000">**Horseman**</span> Heb. ba'al parash , "master of a
horse." The "horsemen" mentioned [Exo 14:9](../kjv/exo014.htm#009) were
"mounted men", i.e., men who rode in chariots. The army of Pharaoh
consisted of a chariot and infantry force. We find that at a later
period, however, the Egyptians had cavalry ([Ch2
12:3](../kjv/ch2012.htm#003)). (See HORSE.)

<span id="001">**Hosanna**</span> Save now! or Save, we beseech, ([Mat
21:9](../kjv/mat021.htm#009)). This was a customary form of acclamation
at the feast of Tabernacles. (Compare [Psa
118:25](../kjv/psa118.htm#025).)

<span id="002">**Hose**</span> ([Dan 3:21](../kjv/dan003.htm#021)), a
tunic or undergarment.

<span id="003">**Hosea**</span> Salvation, the son of Beeri, and author
of the book of prophecies bearing his name. He belonged to the kingdom
of Israel. "His Israelitish origin is attested by the peculiar, rough,
Aramaizing diction, pointing to the northern part of Palestine; by the
intimate acquaintance he evinces with the localities of Ephraim ([Hos
5:1](../kjv/hos005.htm#001); [Hos 6:8](../kjv/hos006.htm#008), [Hos
6:9](../kjv/hos006.htm#009); [Hos 12:12](../kjv/hos012.htm#012); [Hos
14:6](../kjv/hos014.htm#006), etc.); by passages like [Hos
1:2](../kjv/hos001.htm#002), where the kingdom is styled the land, and
[Hos 7:5](../kjv/hos007.htm#005), where the Israelitish king is
designated as our king." The period of his ministry (extending to some
sixty years) is indicated in the superscription ([Hos
1:1](../kjv/hos001.htm#001), [Hos 1:2](../kjv/hos001.htm#002)). He is
the only prophet of Israel who has left any written prophecy.

<span id="004">**Hosea, Prophecies of**</span> This book stands first in
order among the "Minor Prophets." "The probable cause of the location of
Hosea may be the thoroughly national character of his oracles, their
length, their earnest tone, and vivid representations." This was the
longest of the prophetic books written before the Captivity. Hosea
prophesied in a dark and melancholy period of Israel's history, the
period of Israel's decline and fall. Their sins had brought upon them
great national disasters. "Their homicides and fornication, their
perjury and theft, their idolatry and impiety, are censured and
satirized with a faithful severity." He was a contemporary of Isaiah.
The book may be divided into two parts, the first containing Hos. 1 - 3,
and symbolically representing the idolatry of Israel under imagery
borrowed from the matrimonial relation. The figures of marriage and
adultery are common in the Old Testament writings to represent the
spiritual relations between Jehovah and the people of Israel. Here we
see the apostasy of Israel and their punishment, with their future
repentance, forgiveness, and restoration. The second part, containing
Hos. 4 - 14, is a summary of Hosea's discourses, filled with
denunciations, threatenings, exhortations, promises, and revelations of
mercy. Quotations from Hosea are found in [Mat
2:15](../kjv/mat002.htm#015); [Mat 9:15](../kjv/mat009.htm#015); [Mat
12:7](../kjv/mat012.htm#007); [Rom 9:25](../kjv/rom009.htm#025), [Rom
9:26](../kjv/rom009.htm#026). There are, in addition, various allusions
to it in other places ([Luk 23:30](../kjv/luk023.htm#030); [Rev
6:16](../kjv/rev006.htm#016), compare [Hos 10:8](../kjv/hos010.htm#008);
[Rom 9:25](../kjv/rom009.htm#025), [Rom 9:26](../kjv/rom009.htm#026);
[Pe1 2:10](../kjv/pe1002.htm#010), compare [Hos
1:10](../kjv/hos001.htm#010), etc.). As regards the style of this
writer, it has been said that "each verse forms a whole for itself, like
one heavy toll in a funeral knell." "Inversions ([Hos
7:8](../kjv/hos007.htm#008); [Hos 9:11](../kjv/hos009.htm#011), [Hos
9:13](../kjv/hos009.htm#013); [Hos 12:8](../kjv/hos012.htm#008)),
anacolutha ([Hos 9:6](../kjv/hos009.htm#006); [Hos
12:8](../kjv/hos012.htm#008), etc.), ellipses ([Hos
9:4](../kjv/hos009.htm#004); [Hos 13:9](../kjv/hos013.htm#009), etc.),
paranomasias, and plays upon words, are very characteristic of Hosea
([Hos 8:7](../kjv/hos008.htm#007); [Hos 9:15](../kjv/hos009.htm#015);
[Hos 10:5](../kjv/hos010.htm#005); [Hos 11:5](../kjv/hos011.htm#005);
[Hos 12:11](../kjv/hos012.htm#011))."

<span id="005">**Hosah**</span> Refuge. (1.) A place on the border of
the tribe of Asher ([Jos 19:29](../kjv/jos019.htm#029)), a little to the
south of Zidon. (2.) A Levite of the family of Merari ([Ch1
16:38](../kjv/ch1016.htm#038)).

<span id="006">**Hoshea**</span> Salvation. (1.) The original name of
the son of Nun, afterwards called Joshua ([Num
13:8](../kjv/num013.htm#008), [Num 13:16](../kjv/num013.htm#016); [Deu
32:44](../kjv/deu032.htm#044)). (2.) [Ch1 27:20](../kjv/ch1027.htm#020).
The ruler of Ephraim in David's time. (3.) The last king of Israel. He
conspired against and slew his predecessor, Pekah ([Isa
7:16](../kjv/isa007.htm#016)), but did not ascend the throne till after
an interregnum of warfare of eight years ([Kg2
17:1](../kjv/kg2017.htm#001), [Kg2 17:2](../kjv/kg2017.htm#002)). Soon
after this he submitted to Shalmaneser, the Assyrian king, who a second
time invaded the land to punish Hoshea, because of his withholding
tribute which he had promised to pay. A second revolt brought back the
Assyrian king Sargon, who besieged Samaria, and carried the ten tribes
away beyond the Euphrates, 720 B.C. ([Kg2 17:5](../kjv/kg2017.htm#005),
[Kg2 17:6](../kjv/kg2017.htm#006); [Kg2 18:9](../kjv/kg2018.htm#009)).
No more is heard of Hoshea. He disappeared like "foam upon the water"
([Hos 10:7](../kjv/hos010.htm#007); [Hos 13:11](../kjv/hos013.htm#011)).

<span id="007">**Host**</span> An entertainer ([Rom
16:23](../kjv/rom016.htm#023)); a tavern-keeper, the keeper of a
caravansary ([Luk 10:35](../kjv/luk010.htm#035)). In warfare, a troop or
military force. This consisted at first only of infantry. Solomon
afterwards added cavalry ([Kg1 4:26](../kjv/kg1004.htm#026); [Kg1
10:26](../kjv/kg1010.htm#026)). Every male Israelite from twenty to
fifty years of age was bound by the law to bear arms when necessary
([Num 1:3](../kjv/num001.htm#003); [Num 26:2](../kjv/num026.htm#002);
[Ch2 25:5](../kjv/ch2025.htm#005)). Saul was the first to form a
standing army ([Sa1 13:2](../kjv/sa1013.htm#002); [Sa1
24:2](../kjv/sa1024.htm#002)). This example was followed by David ([Ch1
27:1](../kjv/ch1027.htm#001)), and Solomon ([Kg1
4:26](../kjv/kg1004.htm#026)), and by the kings of Israel and Judah
([Ch2 17:14](../kjv/ch2017.htm#014); [Ch2 26:11](../kjv/ch2026.htm#011);
[Kg2 11:4](../kjv/kg2011.htm#004), etc.).

<span id="008">**Host of Heaven**</span> The sun, moon, and stars are so
designated ([Gen 2:1](../kjv/gen002.htm#001)). When the Jews fell into
idolatry they worshipped these ([Deu 4:19](../kjv/deu004.htm#019); [Kg2
17:16](../kjv/kg2017.htm#016); [Kg2 21:3](../kjv/kg2021.htm#003),

<span id="009">**Hostage**</span> A person delivered into the hands of
another as a security for the performance of some promise, etc. ([Kg2
14:14](../kjv/kg2014.htm#014); [Ch2 25:24](../kjv/ch2025.htm#024)).
