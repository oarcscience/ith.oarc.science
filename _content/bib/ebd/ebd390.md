<span id="000">**Zelah**</span> Slope; side, a town in Benjamin, where
Saul and his son Jonathan were buried ([Sa2
21:14](../kjv/sa2021.htm#014)). It was probably Saul's birthplace.

<span id="001">**Zelek**</span> Cleft, an Ammonite; one of David's
valiant men ([Sa2 23:37](../kjv/sa2023.htm#037)).

<span id="002">**Zelophehad**</span> First-born, of the tribe of
Manasseh, and of the family of Gilead; died in the wilderness. Having
left no sons, his daughters, concerned lest their father's name should
be "done away from among his family," made an appeal to Moses, who, by
divine direction, appointed it as "a statute of judgment" in Israel that
daughters should inherit their father's portion when no sons were left
([Num 27:1](../kjv/num027.htm#001)). But that the possession of
Zelophehad might not pass away in the year of jubilee from the tribe to
which he belonged, it was ordained by Moses that his daughters should
not marry any one out of their father's tribe; and this afterwards
became a general law ([Num 36:1](../kjv/num036.htm#001)).

<span id="003">**Zelotes**</span> ([Luk 6:15](../kjv/luk006.htm#015)).
See SIMON; ZEALOTS.

<span id="004">**Zemaraim**</span> (1.) A town of Benjamin ([Jos
18:22](../kjv/jos018.htm#022)); now the ruin, rather two ruins,
es-Sumrah, 4 miles north of Jericho. (2.) A mount in the highlands of
Ephraim, to the north of Jerusalem (2 Chr. 13:4-20). Here the armies of
Abijah and Jeroboam engaged in a bloody battle, which issued in the
total defeat of the king of Israel, who never "recovered strength
again," and soon after died.

<span id="005">**Zemarite**</span> The designation of one of the
Phoenician tribes ([Gen 10:18](../kjv/gen010.htm#018)) who inhabited the
town of Sumra, at the western base of the Lebanon range. In the Amarna
tablets (1400 B.C.) Zemar, or Zumur, was one of the most important of
the Phoenician cities, but it afterwards almost disappears from history.

<span id="006">**Zemira**</span> Vine-dresser, a Benjamite; one of the
sons of Becher ([Ch1 7:8](../kjv/ch1007.htm#008)).

<span id="007">**Zenas**</span> A disciple called "the lawyer," whom
Paul wished Titus to bring with him ([Tit 3:13](../kjv/tit003.htm#013)).
Nothing more is known of him.

<span id="008">**Zephaniah**</span> Jehovah has concealed, or Jehovah of
darkness. (1.) The son of Cushi, and great-grandson of Hezekiah, and the
ninth in the order of the minor prophets. He prophesied in the days of
Josiah, king of Judah (641-610 B.C.), and was contemporary with
Jeremiah, with whom he had much in common. The book of his prophecies
consists of: (a) An introduction ([Zep 1:1](../kjv/zep001.htm#001)),
announcing the judgment of the world, and the judgment upon Israel,
because of their transgressions. (b) The description of the judgment
([Zep 1:7](../kjv/zep001.htm#007)). (c) An exhortation to seek God while
there is still time ([Zep 2:1](../kjv/zep002.htm#001)). (d) The
announcement of judgment on the heathen ([Zep
2:4](../kjv/zep002.htm#004)). (e) The hopeless misery of Jerusalem ([Zep
3:1](../kjv/zep003.htm#001)). (f) The promise of salvation ([Zep
3:8](../kjv/zep003.htm#008)). (2.) The son of Maaseiah, the "second
priest" in the reign of Zedekiah, often mentioned in Jeremiah as having
been sent from the king to inquire ([Jer 21:1](../kjv/jer021.htm#001))
regarding the coming woes which he had denounced, and to entreat the
prophet's intercession that the judgment threatened might be averted
([Jer 29:25](../kjv/jer029.htm#025), [Jer 29:26](../kjv/jer029.htm#026),
[Jer 29:29](../kjv/jer029.htm#029); [Jer 37:3](../kjv/jer037.htm#003);
[Jer 52:24](../kjv/jer052.htm#024)). He, along with some other captive
Jews, was put to death by the king of Babylon "at Riblah in the land of
Hamath" ([Kg2 25:21](../kjv/kg2025.htm#021)). (3.) A Kohathite ancestor
of the prophet Samuel ([Ch1 6:36](../kjv/ch1006.htm#036)). (4.) The
father of Josiah, the priest who dwelt in Jerusalem when Darius issued
the decree that the temple should be rebuilt ([Zac
6:10](../kjv/zac006.htm#010)).

<span id="009">**Zephath**</span> Beacon; watch-tower, a Canaanite town;
called also Hormah (q.v.), [Jdg 1:17](../kjv/jdg001.htm#017). It has
been identified with the pass of es-Sufah , but with greater probability
with S'beita .
