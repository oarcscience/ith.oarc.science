<span id="000">**Grace**</span> (1.) Of form or person ([Pro
1:9](../kjv/pro001.htm#009); [Pro 3:22](../kjv/pro003.htm#022); [Psa
45:2](../kjv/psa045.htm#002)). (2.) Favour, kindness, friendship ([Gen
6:8](../kjv/gen006.htm#008); [Gen 18:3](../kjv/gen018.htm#003); [Gen
19:19](../kjv/gen019.htm#019); [Ti2 1:9](../kjv/ti2001.htm#009)). (3.)
God's forgiving mercy ([Rom 11:6](../kjv/rom011.htm#006); [Eph
2:5](../kjv/eph002.htm#005)). (4.) The gospel as distinguished from the
law ([Joh 1:17](../kjv/joh001.htm#017); [Rom
6:14](../kjv/rom006.htm#014); [Pe1 5:12](../kjv/pe1005.htm#012)). (5.)
Gifts freely bestowed by God; as miracles, prophecy, tongues ([Rom
15:15](../kjv/rom015.htm#015); [Co1 15:10](../kjv/co1015.htm#010); [Eph
3:8](../kjv/eph003.htm#008)). (6.) Christian virtues ([Co2
8:7](../kjv/co2008.htm#007); [Pe2 3:18](../kjv/pe2003.htm#018)). (7.)
The glory hereafter to be revealed ([Pe1 1:13](../kjv/pe1001.htm#013)).

<span id="001">**Grace, Means of**</span> An expression not used in
Scripture, but employed (1.) to denote those institutions ordained by
God to be the ordinary channels of grace to the souls of men. These are
the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer. (2.) But in popular language the
expression is used in a wider sense to denote those exercises in which
we engage for the purpose of obtaining spiritual blessing; as hearing
the gospel, reading the Word, meditation, self-examination, Christian
conversation, etc.

<span id="002">**Graft**</span> The process of inoculating fruit-trees
([Rom 11:17](../kjv/rom011.htm#017)). It is peculiarly appropriate to
olive-trees. The union thus of branches to a stem is used to illustrate
the union of true believers to the true Church.

<span id="003">**Grain**</span> Used, in [Amo
9:9](../kjv/amo009.htm#009), of a small stone or kernel; in [Mat
13:31](../kjv/mat013.htm#031), of an individual seed of mustard; in [Joh
12:24](../kjv/joh012.htm#024), [Co1 15:37](../kjv/co1015.htm#037), of
wheat. The Hebrews sowed only wheat, barley, and spelt; rye and oats are
not mentioned in Scripture.

<span id="004">**Grape**</span> The fruit of the vine, which was
extensively cultivated in Palestine. Grapes are spoken of as "tender"
([Sol 2:13](../kjv/sol002.htm#013), [Sol 2:15](../kjv/sol002.htm#015)),
"unripe" ([Job 15:33](../kjv/job015.htm#033)), "sour" ([Isa
18:5](../kjv/isa018.htm#005)), "wild" ([Isa 5:2](../kjv/isa005.htm#002),
[Isa 5:4](../kjv/isa005.htm#004)). (See [Rev
14:18](../kjv/rev014.htm#018); [Mic 7:1](../kjv/mic007.htm#001); [Jer
6:9](../kjv/jer006.htm#009); [Eze 18:2](../kjv/eze018.htm#002), for
figurative use of the word.) (See VINE.)

<span id="005">**Grass**</span> (1.) Heb. hatsir , ripe grass fit for
mowing ([Kg1 18:5](../kjv/kg1018.htm#005); [Job
40:15](../kjv/job040.htm#015); [Psa 104:14](../kjv/psa104.htm#014)). As
the herbage rapidly fades under the scorching sun, it is used as an
image of the brevity of human life ([Isa 40:6](../kjv/isa040.htm#006),
[Isa 40:7](../kjv/isa040.htm#007); [Psa 90:5](../kjv/psa090.htm#005)).
In [Num 11:5](../kjv/num011.htm#005) this word is rendered "leeks." (2.)
Heb. deshe' , green grass ([Gen 1:11](../kjv/gen001.htm#011), [Gen
1:12](../kjv/gen001.htm#012); [Isa 66:14](../kjv/isa066.htm#014); [Deu
32:2](../kjv/deu032.htm#002)). "The sickly and forced blades of grass
which spring up on the flat plastered roofs of houses in the East are
used as an emblem of speedy destruction, because they are small and
weak, and because, under the scorching rays of the sun, they soon wither
away" ([Kg2 19:26](../kjv/kg2019.htm#026); [Psa
129:6](../kjv/psa129.htm#006); [Isa 37:27](../kjv/isa037.htm#027)). The
dry stalks of grass were often used as fuel for the oven ([Mat
6:30](../kjv/mat006.htm#030); [Mat 13:30](../kjv/mat013.htm#030); [Luk
12:28](../kjv/luk012.htm#028)).

<span id="006">**Grasshopper**</span> Belongs to the class of
neuropterous insects called Gryllidae. This insect is not unknown in
Palestine. In [Jdg 6:5](../kjv/jdg006.htm#005); [Jdg
7:12](../kjv/jdg007.htm#012); [Job 39:30](../kjv/job039.htm#030); [Jer
46:23](../kjv/jer046.htm#023), where the Authorized Version has
"grasshopper," the Revised Version more correctly renders the Hebrew
word ( 'arbeh ) by "locust." This is the case also in [Amo
7:1](../kjv/amo007.htm#001); [Nah 3:17](../kjv/nah003.htm#017), where
the Hebrew word gob is used; and in [Lev 11:22](../kjv/lev011.htm#022);
[Num 13:33](../kjv/num013.htm#033); [Ecc 12:5](../kjv/ecc012.htm#005);
[Isa 40:22](../kjv/isa040.htm#022), where hagab is used. In all these
instances the proper rendering is probably "locust" (q.v.).

<span id="007">**Grate**</span> A network of brass for the bottom of the
great altar of sacrifice ([Exo 27:4](../kjv/exo027.htm#004); [Exo
35:16](../kjv/exo035.htm#016); [Exo 38:4](../kjv/exo038.htm#004), [Exo
38:5](../kjv/exo038.htm#005), [Exo 38:30](../kjv/exo038.htm#030)).

<span id="008">**Grave**</span> Among the ancient Hebrews graves were
outside of cities in the open field ([Luk 7:12](../kjv/luk007.htm#012);
[Joh 11:30](../kjv/joh011.htm#030)). Kings ([Kg1
2:10](../kjv/kg1002.htm#010)) and prophets ([Sa1
25:1](../kjv/sa1025.htm#001)) were generally buried within cities.
Graves were generally grottoes or caves, natural or hewn out in rocks
([Isa 22:16](../kjv/isa022.htm#016); [Mat
27:60](../kjv/mat027.htm#060)). There were family cemeteries ([Gen
47:29](../kjv/gen047.htm#029); [Gen 50:5](../kjv/gen050.htm#005); [Sa2
19:37](../kjv/sa2019.htm#037)). Public burial-places were assigned to
the poor ([Jer 26:23](../kjv/jer026.htm#023); [Kg2
23:6](../kjv/kg2023.htm#006)). Graves were usually closed with stones,
which were whitewashed, to warn strangers against contact with them
([Mat 23:27](../kjv/mat023.htm#027)), which caused ceremonial pollution
([Num 19:16](../kjv/num019.htm#016)). There were no graves in Jerusalem
except those of the kings, and according to tradition that of the
prophetess Huldah.

<span id="009">**Graven Image**</span> [Deu
27:15](../kjv/deu027.htm#015); [Psa 97:7](../kjv/psa097.htm#007) (Heb.
pesel ), refers to the household gods of idolaters. "Every nation and
city had its own gods. Yet every family had its separate household or
tutelary god."
