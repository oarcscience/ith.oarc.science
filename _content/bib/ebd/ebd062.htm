<P><A NAME="000"><B>Bolster</B></A>     The Hebrew word kebir, rendered &quot;pillow&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/sa1019.htm#013">Sa1 19:13</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1019.htm#016">Sa1 19:16</A>, but in Revised Version marg. &quot;quilt&quot; or &quot;network,&quot; probably means some counterpane or veil intended to protect the head of the sleeper. A different Hebrew word ( meraashoth' ) is used for &quot;bolster&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1026.htm#007">Sa1 26:7</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1026.htm#011">Sa1 26:11</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1026.htm#016">Sa1 26:16</A>). It is rightly rendered in Revised Version &quot;at his head.&quot; In <A HREF="../kjv/gen028.htm#011">Gen 28:11</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen028.htm#018">Gen 28:18</A> the Authorized Version renders it &quot;for his pillows,&quot; and the Revised Version &quot;under his head.&quot; In <A HREF="../kjv/eze013.htm#018">Eze 13:18</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/eze013.htm#020">Eze 13:20</A> another Hebrew word (kesathoth) is used, properly denoting &quot;cushions&quot; or &quot;pillows,&quot; as so rendered both in the Authorized and the Revised Version. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Bond</B></A>     An obligation of any kind (<A HREF="../kjv/num030.htm#002">Num 30:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num030.htm#004">Num 30:4</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num030.htm#012">Num 30:12</A>). The word means also oppression or affliction (<A HREF="../kjv/psa116.htm#016">Psa 116:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/phi001.htm#007">Phi 1:7</A>). Christian love is the &quot;bond of perfectness&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/col003.htm#014">Col 3:14</A>), and the influences of the Spirit are the &quot;bond of peace&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/eph004.htm#003">Eph 4:3</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Bondage</B></A>     Of Israel in Egypt (<A HREF="../kjv/exo002.htm#023">Exo 2:23</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo002.htm#025">Exo 2:25</A>; 5), which is called the &quot;house of bondage&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/exo013.htm#003">Exo 13:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo020.htm#002">Exo 20:2</A>). This word is used also with reference to the captivity in Babylon (<A HREF="../kjv/isa014.htm#003">Isa 14:3</A>), and the oppression of the Persian king (<A HREF="../kjv/ezr009.htm#008">Ezr 9:8</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ezr009.htm#009">Ezr 9:9</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Bonnet</B></A>     (Heb.  peer ), <A HREF="../kjv/exo039.htm#028">Exo 39:28</A> (R.V., &quot;head-tires&quot;); <A HREF="../kjv/eze044.htm#018">Eze 44:18</A> (R.V., &quot;tires&quot;), denotes properly a turban worn by priests, and in <A HREF="../kjv/isa003.htm#020">Isa 3:20</A> (R.V., &quot;head-tires&quot;) a head-dress or tiara worn by females. The Hebrew word so rendered literally means an ornament, as in <A HREF="../kjv/isa061.htm#010">Isa 61:10</A> (R.V., &quot;garland&quot;), and in <A HREF="../kjv/eze024.htm#017">Eze 24:17</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/eze024.htm#023">Eze 24:23</A> &quot;tire&quot; (R.V., &quot;head-tire&quot;). It consisted of a piece of cloth twisted about the head. In <A HREF="../kjv/exo028.htm#040">Exo 28:40</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo029.htm#009">Exo 29:9</A> it is the translation of a different Hebrew word ( migba'ah ), which denotes the turban (R.V., &quot;head-tire&quot;) of the common priest as distinguished from the mitre of the high priest. (See MITRE.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Book</B></A>     This word has a comprehensive meaning in Scripture. In the Old Testament it is the rendering of the Hebrew word sepher, which properly means a &quot;writing,&quot; and then a &quot;volume&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/exo017.htm#014">Exo 17:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu028.htm#058">Deu 28:58</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu029.htm#020">Deu 29:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/job019.htm#023">Job 19:23</A>) or &quot;roll of a book&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jer036.htm#002">Jer 36:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jer036.htm#004">Jer 36:4</A>). Books were originally written on skins, on linen or cotton cloth, and on Egyptian papyrus, whence our word &quot;paper.&quot; The leaves of the book were generally written in columns, designated by a Hebrew word properly meaning &quot;doors&quot; and &quot;valves&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jer036.htm#023">Jer 36:23</A>, R.V., marg. &quot;columns&quot;). Among the Hebrews books were generally rolled up like our maps, or if very long they were rolled from both ends, forming two rolls (<A HREF="../kjv/luk004.htm#017">Luk 4:17</A>). Thus they were arranged when the writing was on flexible materials; but if the writing was on tablets of wood or brass or lead, then the several tablets were bound together by rings through which a rod was passed. A sealed book is one whose contents are secret (<A HREF="../kjv/isa029.htm#011">Isa 29:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rev005.htm#001">Rev 5:1</A>). To &quot;eat&quot; a book (<A HREF="../kjv/jer015.htm#016">Jer 15:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/eze002.htm#008">Eze 2:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/eze003.htm#001">Eze 3:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rev010.htm#009">Rev 10:9</A>) is to study its contents carefully. The book of judgment (<A HREF="../kjv/dan007.htm#010">Dan 7:10</A>) refers to the method of human courts of justice as illustrating the proceedings which will take place at the day of God's final judgment. The book of the wars of the Lord (<A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#014">Num 21:14</A>), the book of Jasher (<A HREF="../kjv/jos010.htm#013">Jos 10:13</A>), and the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah and Israel (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2025.htm#026">Ch2 25:26</A>), were probably ancient documents known to the Hebrews, but not forming a part of the canon. The book of life (<A HREF="../kjv/psa069.htm#028">Psa 69:28</A>) suggests the idea that as the redeemed form a community or citizenship (<A HREF="../kjv/phi003.htm#020">Phi 3:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/phi004.htm#003">Phi 4:3</A>), a catalogue of the citizens' names is preserved (<A HREF="../kjv/luk010.htm#020">Luk 10:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rev020.htm#015">Rev 20:15</A>). Their names are registered in heaven (<A HREF="../kjv/luk010.htm#020">Luk 10:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rev003.htm#005">Rev 3:5</A>). The book of the covenant (<A HREF="../kjv/exo024.htm#007">Exo 24:7</A>), containing Ex. 20:22-23:33, is the first book actually mentioned as a part of the written word. It contains a series of laws, civil, social, and religious, given to Moses at Sinai immediately after the delivery of the decalogue. These were written in this &quot;book.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Booth</B></A>     A hut made of the branches of a tree. In such tabernacles Jacob sojourned for a season at a place named from this circumstance Succoth (<A HREF="../kjv/gen033.htm#017">Gen 33:17</A>). Booths were erected also at the feast of Tabernacles (q.v.), <A HREF="../kjv/lev023.htm#042">Lev 23:42</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/lev023.htm#043">Lev 23:43</A>, which commemorated the abode of the Israelites in the wilderness. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Booty</B></A>     Captives or cattle or objects of value taken in war. In Canaan all that breathed were to be destroyed (<A HREF="../kjv/deu020.htm#016">Deu 20:16</A>). The &quot;pictures and images&quot; of the Canaanites were to be destroyed also (<A HREF="../kjv/num033.htm#052">Num 33:52</A>). The law of booty as to its division is laid down in Num. 31:26-47. David afterwards introduced a regulation that the baggage-guard should share the booty equally with the soldiers engaged in battle. He also devoted of the spoils of war for the temple (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1030.htm#024">Sa1 30:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa2008.htm#011">Sa2 8:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1026.htm#027">Ch1 26:27</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Borrow</B></A>     The Israelites &quot;borrowed&quot; from the Egyptians (<A HREF="../kjv/exo012.htm#035">Exo 12:35</A>, R.V., &quot;asked&quot;) in accordance with a divine command (<A HREF="../kjv/exo003.htm#022">Exo 3:22</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo011.htm#002">Exo 11:2</A>). But the word ( sha'al ) so rendered here means simply and always to &quot;request&quot; or &quot;demand.&quot; The Hebrew had another word which is properly translated &quot;borrow&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/deu028.htm#012">Deu 28:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa037.htm#021">Psa 37:21</A>. It was well known that the parting was final. The Egyptians were so anxious to get the Israelites away out of their land that &quot;they let them have what they asked&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/exo012.htm#036">Exo 12:36</A>, R.V.), or literally &quot;made them to ask,&quot; urged them to take whatever they desired and depart. (See LOAN.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Bosom</B></A>     In the East objects are carried in the bosom which Europeans carry in the pocket. To have in one's bosom indicates kindness, secrecy, or intimacy (<A HREF="../kjv/gen016.htm#005">Gen 16:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa2012.htm#008">Sa2 12:8</A>). Christ is said to have been in &quot;the bosom of the Father,&quot; i.e., he had the most perfect knowledge of the Father, had the closest intimacy with him (<A HREF="../kjv/joh001.htm#018">Joh 1:18</A>). John (<A HREF="../kjv/joh013.htm#023">Joh 13:23</A>) was &quot;leaning on Jesus' bosom&quot; at the last supper. Our Lord carries his lambs in his bosom, i.e., has a tender, watchful care over them (<A HREF="../kjv/isa040.htm#011">Isa 40:11</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Bosses</B></A>     The projecting parts of a shield (<A HREF="../kjv/job015.htm#026">Job 15:26</A>). The Hebrew word thus rendered means anything convex or arched, and hence the back, as of animals.
