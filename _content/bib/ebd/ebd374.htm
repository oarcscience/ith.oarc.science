<P><A NAME="000"><B>Tyrannus</B></A>     Prince, a Greek rhetorician, in whose &quot;school&quot; at Ephesus Paul disputed daily for the space of two years with those who came to him (<A HREF="../kjv/act019.htm#009">Act 19:9</A>). Some have supposed that he was a Jew, and that his &quot;school&quot; was a private synagogue.

<P><A NAME="001"><B>Tyre</B></A>     A rock, now es-Sur; an ancient Phoenician city, about 23 miles, in a direct line, north of Acre, and 20 south of Sidon. Sidon was the oldest Phoenician city, but Tyre had a longer and more illustrious history. The commerce of the whole world was gathered into the warehouses of Tyre. &quot;Tyrian merchants were the first who ventured to navigate the Mediterranean waters; and they founded their colonies on the coasts and neighbouring islands of the Aegean Sea, in Greece, on the northern coast of Africa, at Carthage and other places, in Sicily and Corsica, in Spain at Tartessus, and even beyond the pillars of Hercules at Gadeira (Cadiz)&quot; (Driver's Isaiah). In the time of David a friendly alliance was entered into between the Hebrews and the Tyrians, who were long ruled over by their native kings (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2005.htm#011">Sa2 5:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg1005.htm#001">Kg1 5:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2002.htm#003">Ch2 2:3</A>). Tyre consisted of two distinct parts, a rocky fortress on the mainland, called &quot;Old Tyre,&quot; and the city, built on a small, rocky island about half-a-mile distant from the shore. It was a place of great strength. It was besieged by Shalmaneser, who was assisted by the Phoenicians of the mainland, for five years, and by Nebuchadnezzar (B.C.586-573) for thirteen years, apparently without success. It afterwards fell under the power of Alexander the Great, after a siege of seven months, but continued to maintain much of its commercial importance till the Christian era. It is referred to in <A HREF="../kjv/mat011.htm#021">Mat 11:21</A> and <A HREF="../kjv/act012.htm#020">Act 12:20</A>. In A.D. 1291 it was taken by the Saracens, and has remained a desolate ruin ever since. &quot;The purple dye of Tyre had a worldwide celebrity on account of the durability of its beautiful tints, and its manufacture proved a source of abundant wealth to the inhabitants of that city.&quot; Both Tyre and Sidon &quot;were crowded with glass-shops, dyeing and weaving establishments; and among their cunning workmen not the least important class were those who were celebrated for the engraving of precious stones.&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2002.htm#007">Ch2 2:7</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch2002.htm#014">Ch2 2:14</A>). The wickedness and idolatry of this city are frequently denounced by the prophets, and its final destruction predicted (<A HREF="../kjv/isa023.htm#001">Isa 23:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer025.htm#022">Jer 25:22</A>; Ezek. 26; 28:1-19; <A HREF="../kjv/amo001.htm#009">Amo 1:9</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/amo001.htm#010">Amo 1:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/zac009.htm#002">Zac 9:2</A>). Here a church was founded soon after the death of Stephen, and Paul, on his return from his third missionary journey spent a week in intercourse with the disciples there (<A HREF="../kjv/act021.htm#004">Act 21:4</A>). Here the scene at Miletus was repeated on his leaving them. They all, with their wives and children, accompanied him to the sea-shore. The sea-voyage of the apostle terminated at Ptolemais, about 38 miles from Tyre. Thence he proceeded to Caesarea (<A HREF="../kjv/act021.htm#005">Act 21:5</A>). &quot;It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C.1500, and claiming, according to Herodotus, to have been founded about 2700 B.C.. It had two ports still existing, and was of commercial importance in all ages, with colonies at Carthage (about 850 B.C.) and all over the Mediterranean. It was often attacked by Egypt and Assyria, and taken by Alexander the Great after a terrible siege in 332 B.C.. It is now a town of 3,000 inhabitants, with ancient tombs and a ruined cathedral. A short Phoenician text of the fourth century B.C. is the only monument yet recovered.&quot;

<P><A NAME="002"><B>Tyropoeon Valley</B></A>     (i.e., &quot;Valley of the Cheesemongers&quot;), the name given by Josephus the historian to the valley or rugged ravine which in ancient times separated Mount Moriah from Mount Zion. This valley, now filled up with a vast accumulation of rubbish, and almost a plain, was spanned by bridges, the most noted of which was Zion Bridge, which was probably the ordinary means of communication between the royal palace on Zion and the temple. A fragment of the arch (q.v.) of this bridge (called &quot;Robinson's Arch&quot;), where it projects from the sanctuary wall, was discovered by Robinson in 1839. This arch was destroyed by the Romans when Jerusalem was taken. The western wall of the temple area rose up from the bottom of this valley to the height of 84 feet, where it was on a level with the area, and above this, and as a continuance of it, the wall of Solomon's cloister rose to the height of about 50 feet, &quot;so that this section of the wall would originally present to view a stupendous mass of masonry scarcely to be surpassed by any mural masonry in the world.&quot;

<P><A NAME="003"><B>Ucal</B></A>     The name of a person to whom Agur's words are addressed (<A HREF="../kjv/pro030.htm#001">Pro 30:1</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Ulai</B></A>     The Eulaus of the Greeks; a river of Susiana. It was probably the eastern branch of the Choasper (Kerkhan), which divided into two branches some 20 miles above the city of Susa. Hence Daniel (<A HREF="../kjv/dan008.htm#002">Dan 8:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/dan008.htm#016">Dan 8:16</A>) speaks of standing &quot;between the banks of Ulai&quot;, i.e., between the two streams of the divided river. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Ummah</B></A>     Vicinity, a town of Asher (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#030">Jos 19:30</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Unction</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/jo1002.htm#020">Jo1 2:20</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jo1002.htm#027">Jo1 2:27</A>; R.V., &quot;anointing&quot;). Kings, prophets, and priests were anointed, in token of receiving divine grace. All believers are, in a secondary sense, what Christ was in a primary sense, &quot;the Lord's anointed.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Unicorn</B></A>     Described as an animal of great ferocity and strength (<A HREF="../kjv/num023.htm#022">Num 23:22</A>, R.V., &quot;wild ox,&quot; marg., &quot;ox-antelope;&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/num024.htm#008">Num 24:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa034.htm#007">Isa 34:7</A>, R.V., &quot;wild oxen&quot;), and untamable (<A HREF="../kjv/job039.htm#009">Job 39:9</A>). It was in reality a two-horned animal; but the exact reference of the word so rendered (reem) is doubtful. Some have supposed it to be the buffalo; others, the white antelope, called by the Arabs rim. Most probably, however, the word denotes the Bos primigenius (&quot;primitive ox&quot;), which is now extinct all over the world. This was the auerochs of the Germans, and the urus described by Caesar (Gal. Bel., vi. 28) as inhabiting the Hercynian forest. The word thus rendered has been found in an Assyrian inscription written over the wild ox or bison, which some also suppose to be the animal intended (compare <A HREF="../kjv/deu033.htm#017">Deu 33:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa022.htm#021">Psa 22:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa029.htm#006">Psa 29:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa092.htm#010">Psa 92:10</A>).

<P><A NAME="008"><B>Unni</B></A>     Afflicted.     (1.) A Levite whom David appointed to take part in bringing the ark up to Jerusalem from the house of Obed-edom by playing the psaltery on that occasion (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1015.htm#018">Ch1 15:18</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch1015.htm#020">Ch1 15:20</A>). (2.) A Levite who returned with Zerubbabel from the Captivity (<A HREF="../kjv/neh012.htm#009">Neh 12:9</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Upharsin</B></A>     And they divide, one of the words written by the mysterious hand on the wall of Belshazzar's palace (<A HREF="../kjv/dan005.htm#025">Dan 5:25</A>). It is a pure Chaldean word. &quot;Peres&quot; is only a simple form of the same word.
