<span id="000">**Ladder**</span> Occurs only once, in the account of
Jacob's vision ([Gen 28:12](../kjv/gen028.htm#012)).

<span id="001">**Laish**</span> A lion. (1.) A city of the Sidonians, in
the extreme north of Palestine ([Jdg 18:7](../kjv/jdg018.htm#007), [Jdg
18:14](../kjv/jdg018.htm#014)); called also Leshem ([Jos
19:47](../kjv/jos019.htm#047)) and Dan ([Jdg
18:7](../kjv/jdg018.htm#007), [Jdg 18:29](../kjv/jdg018.htm#029); [Jer
8:16](../kjv/jer008.htm#016)). It lay near the sources of the Jordan,
about 4 miles from Paneas. The restless and warlike tribe of Dan (q.v.),
looking out for larger possessions, invaded this country and took Laish
with its territory. It is identified with the ruin Tell-el-Kady, "the
mound of the judge," to the north of the Waters of Merom ([Jos
11:5](../kjv/jos011.htm#005)). (2.) A place mentioned in [Isa
10:30](../kjv/isa010.htm#030). It has been supposed to be the modern
el-Isawiyeh, about a mile north-east of Jerusalem. (3.) The father of
Phalti ([Sa1 25:44](../kjv/sa1025.htm#044)).

<span id="002">**Lama**</span> ([Mat 27:46](../kjv/mat027.htm#046)), a
Hebrew word meaning why, quoted from [Psa 22:1](../kjv/psa022.htm#001).

<span id="003">**Lamb**</span> (1.) Heb. kebes , a male lamb from the
first to the third year. Offered daily at the morning and the evening
sacrifice ([Exo 29:38](../kjv/exo029.htm#038)), on the Sabbath day ([Num
28:9](../kjv/num028.htm#009)), at the feast of the New Moon ([Num
28:11](../kjv/num028.htm#011)), of Trumpets ([Num
29:2](../kjv/num029.htm#002)), of Tabernacles (Num. 29:13-40), of
Pentecost ([Lev 23:18](../kjv/lev023.htm#018)), and of the Passover
([Exo 12:5](../kjv/exo012.htm#005)), and on many other occasions ([Ch1
29:21](../kjv/ch1029.htm#021); [Ch2 29:21](../kjv/ch2029.htm#021); [Lev
9:3](../kjv/lev009.htm#003); 14:10-25). (2.) Heb. taleh , a young
sucking lamb ([Sa1 7:9](../kjv/sa1007.htm#009); [Isa
65:25](../kjv/isa065.htm#025)). In the symbolical language of Scripture
the lamb is the type of meekness and innocence ([Isa
11:6](../kjv/isa011.htm#006); [Isa 65:25](../kjv/isa065.htm#025); [Luk
10:3](../kjv/luk010.htm#003); [Joh 21:15](../kjv/joh021.htm#015)). The
lamb was a symbol of Christ ([Gen 4:4](../kjv/gen004.htm#004); [Exo
12:3](../kjv/exo012.htm#003); [Exo 29:38](../kjv/exo029.htm#038); [Isa
16:1](../kjv/isa016.htm#001); [Isa 53:7](../kjv/isa053.htm#007); [Joh
1:36](../kjv/joh001.htm#036); [Rev 13:8](../kjv/rev013.htm#008)). Christ
is called the Lamb of God ([Joh 1:29](../kjv/joh001.htm#029), [Joh
1:36](../kjv/joh001.htm#036)), as the great sacrifice of which the
former sacrifices were only types ([Num 6:12](../kjv/num006.htm#012);
[Lev 14:12](../kjv/lev014.htm#012); [Isa 53:7](../kjv/isa053.htm#007);
[Co1 5:7](../kjv/co1005.htm#007)).

<span id="004">**Lamech**</span> The strikerdown; the wild man. (1.) The
fifth in descent from Cain. He was the first to violate the primeval
ordinance of marriage ([Gen 4:18](../kjv/gen004.htm#018)). His address
to his two wives, Adah and Zillah ([Gen 4:23](../kjv/gen004.htm#023),
[Gen 4:24](../kjv/gen004.htm#024)), is the only extant example of
antediluvian poetry. It has been called "Lamech's sword-song." He was
"rude and ruffianly," fearing neither God nor man. With him the curtain
falls on the race of Cain. We know nothing of his descendants. (2.) The
seventh in descent from Seth, being the only son of Methuselah. Noah was
the oldest of his several sons ([Gen 5:25](../kjv/gen005.htm#025); [Luk
3:36](../kjv/luk003.htm#036)).

<span id="005">**Lamentation**</span> (Heb. qinah ), an elegy or dirge.
The first example of this form of poetry is the lament of David over
Saul and Jonathan ([Sa2 1:17](../kjv/sa2001.htm#017)). It was a frequent
accompaniment of mourning ([Amo 8:10](../kjv/amo008.htm#010)). In [Sa2
3:33](../kjv/sa2003.htm#033), [Sa2 3:34](../kjv/sa2003.htm#034) is
recorded David's lament over Abner. Prophecy sometimes took the form of
a lament when it predicted calamity ([Eze 27:2](../kjv/eze027.htm#002),
[Eze 27:32](../kjv/eze027.htm#032); [Eze 28:12](../kjv/eze028.htm#012);
[Eze 32:2](../kjv/eze032.htm#002), [Eze 32:16](../kjv/eze032.htm#016)).

<span id="006">**Lamentations, Book of**</span> Called in the Hebrew
canon 'Ekhah , meaning "How," being the formula for the commencement of
a song of wailing. It is the first word of the book (see [Sa2
1:19](../kjv/sa2001.htm#019)). The LXX. adopted the name rendered
"Lamentations" (Gr. threnoi = Heb. qinoth ) now in common use, to denote
the character of the book, in which the prophet mourns over the
desolations brought on the city and the holy land by Chaldeans. In the
Hebrew Bible it is placed among the Khethubim. (See BIBLE.) As to its
authorship, there is no room for hesitancy in following the LXX. and the
Targum in ascribing it to Jeremiah. The spirit, tone, language, and
subject-matter are in accord with the testimony of tradition in
assigning it to him. According to tradition, he retired after the
destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to a cavern outside the
Damascus gate, where he wrote this book. That cavern is still pointed
out. "In the face of a rocky hill, on the western side of the city, the
local belief has placed 'the grotto of Jeremiah.' There, in that fixed
attitude of grief which Michael Angelo has immortalized, the prophet may
well be supposed to have mourned the fall of his country" (Stanley,
Jewish Church). The book consists of five separate poems. In Lam. 1 the
prophet dwells on the manifold miseries oppressed by which the city sits
as a solitary widow weeping sorely. In Lam. 2 these miseries are
described in connection with the national sins that had caused them.
Lam. 3 speaks of hope for the people of God. The chastisement would only
be for their good; a better day would dawn for them. Lam. 4 laments the
ruin and desolation that had come upon the city and temple, but traces
it only to the people's sins. Lam. 5 is a prayer that Zion's reproach
may be taken away in the repentance and recovery of the people. The
first four poems (chapters) are acrostics, like some of the Psalms (Ps.
25, 34, 37, 119), i.e., each verse begins with a letter of the Hebrew
alphabet taken in order. The first, second, and fourth have each
twenty-two verses, the number of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet. The
third has sixty-six verses, in which each three successive verses begin
with the same letter. The fifth is not acrostic. Speaking of the
"Wailing-place (q.v.) of the Jews" at Jerusalem, a portion of the old
wall of the temple of Solomon, Schaff says: "There the Jews assemble
every Friday afternoon to bewail the downfall of the holy city, kissing
the stone wall and watering it with their tears. They repeat from their
well-worn Hebrew Bibles and prayer-books the Lamentations of Jeremiah
and suitable Psalms."

<span id="007">**Lamp**</span> (1.) That part of the candle-sticks of
the tabernacle and the temple which bore the light ([Exo
25:37](../kjv/exo025.htm#037); [Kg1 7:49](../kjv/kg1007.htm#049); [Ch2
4:20](../kjv/ch2004.htm#020); [Ch2 13:11](../kjv/ch2013.htm#011); [Zac
4:2](../kjv/zac004.htm#002)). Their form is not described. Olive oil was
generally burned in them ([Exo 27:20](../kjv/exo027.htm#020)). (2.) A
torch carried by the soldiers of Gideon ([Jdg
7:16](../kjv/jdg007.htm#016), [Jdg 7:20](../kjv/jdg007.htm#020)). (R.V.,
"torches.") (3.) Domestic lamps (A.V., "candles") were in common use
among the Hebrews ([Mat 5:15](../kjv/mat005.htm#015); [Mar
4:21](../kjv/mar004.htm#021), etc.). (4.) Lamps or torches were used in
connection with marriage ceremonies ([Mat 25:1](../kjv/mat025.htm#001)).
This word is also frequently metaphorically used to denote life,
welfare, guidance, etc. ([Sa2 21:17](../kjv/sa2021.htm#017); [Psa
119:105](../kjv/psa119.htm#105); [Pro 6:23](../kjv/pro006.htm#023); [Pro
13:9](../kjv/pro013.htm#009)).

<span id="008">**Landmark**</span> A boundary line indicated by a stone,
stake, etc. ([Deu 19:14](../kjv/deu019.htm#014); [Deu
27:17](../kjv/deu027.htm#017); [Pro 22:28](../kjv/pro022.htm#028); [Pro
23:10](../kjv/pro023.htm#010); [Job 24:2](../kjv/job024.htm#002)).
Landmarks could not be removed without incurring the severe displeasure
of God.

<span id="009">**Laodicea**</span> The city of this name mentioned in
Scripture lay on the confines of Phrygia and Lydia, about 40 miles east
of Ephesus ([Rev 3:14](../kjv/rev003.htm#014)), on the banks of the
Lycus. It was originally called Diospolis and then Rhoas, but afterwards
Laodicea, from Laodice, the wife of Antiochus II., king of Syria, who
rebuilt it. It was one of the most important and flourishing cities of
Asia Minor. At a very early period it became one of the chief seats of
Christianity ([Col 2:1](../kjv/col002.htm#001); [Col
4:15](../kjv/col004.htm#015); [Rev 1:11](../kjv/rev001.htm#011), etc.).
It is now a deserted place, called by the Turks Eski-hissar or "old
castle."
