<span id="000">**Kartah**</span> City, a town in the tribe of Zebulun
assigned to the Levites of the family of Merari ([Jos
21:34](../kjv/jos021.htm#034)). It is identical with Kattath ([Jos
19:15](../kjv/jos019.htm#015)), and perhaps also with Kitron ([Jdg
1:30](../kjv/jdg001.htm#030)).

<span id="001">**Kartan**</span> Double city, a town of Naphali,
assigned to the Gershonite Levites, and one of the cities of refuge
([Jos 21:32](../kjv/jos021.htm#032)). It was probably near the
north-western shore of the Sea of Tiberias, identical with the ruined
village el-Katanah.

<span id="002">**Kattath**</span> ([Jos 19:15](../kjv/jos019.htm#015)),
a town of Asher, has been identified with Kana el Jelil. (See CANA.)

<span id="003">**Kedar**</span> Dark-skinned, the second son of Ishmael
([Gen 25:13](../kjv/gen025.htm#013)). It is the name for the nomadic
tribes of Arabs, the Bedouins generally ([Isa
21:16](../kjv/isa021.htm#016); [Isa 42:11](../kjv/isa042.htm#011); [Isa
60:7](../kjv/isa060.htm#007); [Jer 2:10](../kjv/jer002.htm#010); [Eze
27:21](../kjv/eze027.htm#021)), who dwelt in the north-west of Arabia.
They lived in black hair-tents ([Sol 1:5](../kjv/sol001.htm#005)). To
"dwell in the tents of Kedar" was to be cut off from the worship of the
true God ([Psa 120:5](../kjv/psa120.htm#005)). The Kedarites suffered at
the hands of Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer 49:28](../kjv/jer049.htm#028), [Jer
49:29](../kjv/jer049.htm#029)).

<span id="004">**Kedemah**</span> Eastward, the last-named of the sons
of Ishmael ([Gen 25:15](../kjv/gen025.htm#015)).

<span id="005">**Kedemoth**</span> Beginnings; easternmost, a city of
Reuben, assigned to the Levites of the family of Merari ([Jos
13:18](../kjv/jos013.htm#018)). It lay not far north-east of Dibon-gad,
east of the Dead Sea.

<span id="006">**Kedesh**</span> Sanctuary. (1.) A place in the extreme
south of Judah ([Jos 15:23](../kjv/jos015.htm#023)). Probably the same
as Kadesh-barnea (q.v.). (2.) A city of Issachar ([Ch1
6:72](../kjv/ch1006.htm#072)). Possibly Tell Abu Kadeis, near Lejjun.
(3.) A "fenced city" of Naphtali, one of the cities of refuge ([Jos
19:37](../kjv/jos019.htm#037); [Jdg 4:6](../kjv/jdg004.htm#006)). It was
assigned to the Gershonite Levites ([Jos 21:32](../kjv/jos021.htm#032)).
It was originally a Canaanite royal city ([Jos
12:22](../kjv/jos012.htm#022)), and was the residence of Barak ([Jdg
4:6](../kjv/jdg004.htm#006)); and here he and Deborah assembled the
tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali before the commencement of the conflict
with Sisera in the plain of Esdraelon, "for Jehovah among the mighty"
([Jdg 4:9](../kjv/jdg004.htm#009), [Jdg 4:10](../kjv/jdg004.htm#010)).
In the reign of Pekah it was taken by Tiglath-Pileser ([Kg2
15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029)). It was situated near the "plain" (rather
"the oak") of Zaanaim, and has been identified with the modern Kedes, on
the hills fully four miles north-west of Lake El Huleh. It has been
supposed by some that the Kedesh of the narrative, where Barak assembled
his troops, was not the place in Upper Galilee so named, which was 30
miles distant from the plain of Esdraelon, but Kedish, on the shore of
the Sea of Galilee, 12 miles from Tabor.

<span id="007">**Kedron**</span> The valley, now quite narrow, between
the Mount of Olives and Mount Moriah. The upper part of it is called the
Valley of Jehoshaphat. The LXX., in [Kg1 15:13](../kjv/kg1015.htm#013),
translate "of the cedar." The word means "black," and may refer to the
colour of the water or the gloom of the ravine, or the black green of
the cedars which grew there. [Joh 18:1](../kjv/joh018.htm#001),
"Cedron," only here in New Testament. (See KIDRON.)

<span id="008">**Kehelathah**</span> Assembly, one of the stations of
the Israelites in the desert ([Num 33:22](../kjv/num033.htm#022), [Num
33:23](../kjv/num033.htm#023)).

<span id="009">**Keilah**</span> Citadel, a city in the lowlands of
Judah ([Jos 15:44](../kjv/jos015.htm#044)). David rescued it from the
attack of the Philistines ([Sa1 23:1](../kjv/sa1023.htm#001)); but the
inhabitants proving unfaithful to him, in that they sought to deliver
him up to Saul ([Sa1 23:13](../kjv/sa1023.htm#013)), he and his men
"departed from Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go." They fled
to the hill Hareth, about 3 miles to the east, and thence through Hebron
to Ziph (q.v.). "And David was in the wilderness of Ziph, in a wood"
([Sa1 23:15](../kjv/sa1023.htm#015)). Here Jonathan sought him out, "and
strengthened his hand in God." This was the last interview between David
and Jonathan ([Sa1 23:16](../kjv/sa1023.htm#016)). It is the modern
Khurbet Kila. Others identify it with Khuweilfeh, between Beit Jibrin
(Eleutheropolis) and Beersheba, mentioned in the Amarna tablets.
