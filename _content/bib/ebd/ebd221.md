<span id="000">**Kiss**</span> Of affection ([Gen
27:26](../kjv/gen027.htm#026), [Gen 27:27](../kjv/gen027.htm#027); [Gen
29:13](../kjv/gen029.htm#013); [Luk 7:38](../kjv/luk007.htm#038), [Luk
7:45](../kjv/luk007.htm#045)); reconciliation ([Gen
33:4](../kjv/gen033.htm#004); [Sa2 14:33](../kjv/sa2014.htm#033));
leave-taking ([Gen 31:28](../kjv/gen031.htm#028), [Gen
31:55](../kjv/gen031.htm#055); [Rut 1:14](../kjv/rut001.htm#014); [Sa2
19:39](../kjv/sa2019.htm#039)); homage ([Psa
2:12](../kjv/psa002.htm#012); [Sa1 10:1](../kjv/sa1010.htm#001)); spoken
of as between parents and children ([Gen 27:26](../kjv/gen027.htm#026);
[Gen 31:28](../kjv/gen031.htm#028), [Gen 31:55](../kjv/gen031.htm#055);
[Gen 48:10](../kjv/gen048.htm#010); [Gen 50:1](../kjv/gen050.htm#001);
[Exo 18:7](../kjv/exo018.htm#007); [Rut 1:9](../kjv/rut001.htm#009),
[Rut 1:14](../kjv/rut001.htm#014)); between male relatives ([Gen
29:13](../kjv/gen029.htm#013); [Gen 33:4](../kjv/gen033.htm#004); [Gen
45:15](../kjv/gen045.htm#015)). It accompanied social worship as a
symbol of brotherly love ([Rom 16:16](../kjv/rom016.htm#016); [Co1
16:20](../kjv/co1016.htm#020); [Co2 13:12](../kjv/co2013.htm#012); [Th1
5:26](../kjv/th1005.htm#026); [Pe1 5:14](../kjv/pe1005.htm#014)). The
worship of idols was by kissing the image or the hand toward the image
([Kg1 19:18](../kjv/kg1019.htm#018); [Hos 13:2](../kjv/hos013.htm#002)).

<span id="001">**Kite**</span> An unclean and keen-sighted bird of prey
([Lev 11:14](../kjv/lev011.htm#014); [Deu
14:13](../kjv/deu014.htm#013)). The Hebrew word used, 'ayet , is
rendered "vulture" in [Job 28:7](../kjv/job028.htm#007) in Authorized
Version, "falcon" in Revised Version. It is probably the red kite
(Milvus regalis), a bird of piercing sight and of soaring habits found
all over Palestine.

<span id="002">**Kithlish**</span> A man's wall, a town in the plain of
Judah ([Jos 15:40](../kjv/jos015.htm#040)). It has been identified with
Jelameh.

<span id="003">**Kitron**</span> Knotty, a city of Zebulun ([Jdg
1:30](../kjv/jdg001.htm#030)), called also Kattath ([Jos
19:15](../kjv/jos019.htm#015)); supposed to be "Cana of Galilee."

<span id="004">**Kittim**</span> ([Gen 10:4](../kjv/gen010.htm#004)).
(See CHITTIM.)

<span id="005">**Knead**</span> To prepare dough in the process of
baking ([Gen 18:6](../kjv/gen018.htm#006); [Sa1
28:24](../kjv/sa1028.htm#024); [Hos 7:4](../kjv/hos007.htm#004)).

<span id="006">**Kneading-trough**</span> The vessel in which the dough,
after being mixed and leavened, was left to swell or ferment ([Exo
8:3](../kjv/exo008.htm#003); [Exo 12:34](../kjv/exo012.htm#034); [Deu
28:5](../kjv/deu028.htm#005), [Deu 28:7](../kjv/deu028.htm#007)). The
dough in the vessels at the time of the Exodus was still unleavened,
because the people were compelled to withdraw in haste.

<span id="007">**Knife**</span> (1.) Heb. hereb , "the waster," a sharp
instrument for circumcision ([Jos 5:2](../kjv/jos005.htm#002), [Jos
5:3](../kjv/jos005.htm#003), lit. "knives of flint;" compare [Exo
4:25](../kjv/exo004.htm#025)); a razor ([Eze
5:1](../kjv/eze005.htm#001)); a graving tool ([Exo
20:25](../kjv/exo020.htm#025)); an axe ([Eze
26:9](../kjv/eze026.htm#009)). (2.) Heb. maakeleth , a large knife for
slaughtering and cutting up food ([Gen 22:6](../kjv/gen022.htm#006),
[Gen 22:10](../kjv/gen022.htm#010); [Pro 30:14](../kjv/pro030.htm#014)).
(3.) Heb. sakkin , a knife for any purpose, a table knife ([Pro
23:2](../kjv/pro023.htm#002)). (4.) Heb. mahalaph , a butcher's knife
for slaughtering the victims offered in sacrifice ([Ezr
1:9](../kjv/ezr001.htm#009)). (5.) Smaller knives (Heb. ta'ar , [Jer
36:26](../kjv/jer036.htm#026)) were used for sharpening pens. The
pruning-knives mentioned in [Isa 18:5](../kjv/isa018.htm#005) (Heb.
mizmaroth ) were probably curved knives.

<span id="008">**Knock**</span> "Though Orientals are very jealous of
their privacy, they never knock when about to enter your room, but walk
in without warning or ceremony. It is nearly impossible to teach an Arab
servant to knock at your door. They give warning at the outer gate
either by calling or knocking. To stand and call is a very common and
respectful mode. Thus Moses commanded the holder of a pledge to stand
without and call to the owner to come forth ([Deu
24:10](../kjv/deu024.htm#010)). This was to avoid the violent intrusion
of cruel creditors. Peter stood knocking at the outer door ([Act
12:13](../kjv/act012.htm#013), [Act 12:16](../kjv/act012.htm#016)), and
the three men sent to Joppa by Cornelius made inquiry and 'stood before
the gate' ([Act 10:17](../kjv/act010.htm#017), [Act
10:18](../kjv/act010.htm#018)). The idea is that the guard over your
privacy is to be placed at the entrance." Knocking is used as a sign of
importunity ([Mat 7:7](../kjv/mat007.htm#007), [Mat
7:8](../kjv/mat007.htm#008); [Luk 13:25](../kjv/luk013.htm#025)), and of
the coming of Christ ([Luk 12:36](../kjv/luk012.htm#036); [Rev
3:20](../kjv/rev003.htm#020)).

<span id="009">**Knop**</span> Some architectural ornament. (1.) Heb.
kaphtor ([Exo 25:31](../kjv/exo025.htm#031)), occurring in the
description of the candlestick. It was an ornamental swell beneath the
cups of the candlestick, probably an imitation of the fruit of the
almond. (2.) Heb. peka'im , found only in [Kg1
6:18](../kjv/kg1006.htm#018) and [Kg1 7:24](../kjv/kg1007.htm#024), an
ornament resembling a small gourd or an egg, on the cedar wainscot in
the temple and on the castings on the brim of the brazen sea.
