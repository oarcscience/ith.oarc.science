<span id="000">**Rephaim**</span> Lofty menl; giants, ([Gen
14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005); [Sa2 21:16](../kjv/sa2021.htm#016), [Sa2
21:18](../kjv/sa2021.htm#018), marg. A.V., Rapha, marg. R.V., Raphah;
[Deu 3:13](../kjv/deu003.htm#013), R.V.; A.V., "giants"). The aborigines
of Palestine, afterwards conquered and dispossessed by the Canaanite
tribes, are classed under this general title. They were known to the
Moabites as Emim, i.e., "fearful", ([Deu 2:11](../kjv/deu002.htm#011)),
and to the Ammonites as Zamzummim. Some of them found refuge among the
Philistines, and were still existing in the days of David. We know
nothing of their origin. They were not necessarily connected with the
"giants" (R.V., "Nephilim") of [Gen 6:4](../kjv/gen006.htm#004). (See
GIANTS.)

<span id="001">**Rephaim, Valley of**</span> ([Jos
15:8](../kjv/jos015.htm#008); [Jos 18:16](../kjv/jos018.htm#016), R.V.).
When David became king over all Israel, the Philistines, judging that he
would now become their uncompromising enemy, made a sudden attack upon
Hebron, compelling David to retire from it. He sought refuge in "the
hold" at Adullam ([Sa2 5:17](../kjv/sa2005.htm#017)), and the
Philistines took up their position in the valley of Rephaim, on the west
and south-west of Jerusalem. Thus all communication between Bethlehem
and Jerusalem was intercepted. While David and his army were encamped
here, there occurred that incident narrated in [Sa2
23:15](../kjv/sa2023.htm#015). Having obtained divine direction, David
led his army against the Philistines, and gained a complete victory over
them. The scene of this victory was afterwards called Baalperazim
(q.v.). A second time, however, the Philistines rallied their forces in
this valley ([Sa2 5:22](../kjv/sa2005.htm#022)). Again warned by a
divine oracle, David led his army to Gibeon, and attacked the
Philistines from the south, inflicting on them another severe defeat,
and chasing them with great slaughter to Gezer (q.v.). There David kept
in check these enemies of Israel. This valley is now called el-Bukei'a .

<span id="002">**Rephidim**</span> Supports, one of the stations of the
Israelites, situated in the Wady Feiran, near its junction with the Wady
esh-Sheikh. Here no water could be found for the people to drink, and in
their impatience they were ready to stone Moses, as if he were the cause
of their distress. At the command of God Moses smote "the rock in
Horeb," and a copious stream flowed forth, enough for all the people.
After this the Amalekites attacked the Israelites while they were here
encamped, but they were utterly defeated ([Exo
17:1](../kjv/exo017.htm#001), [Exo 17:8](../kjv/exo017.htm#008)). They
were the "first of the nations" to make war against Israel ([Num
24:20](../kjv/num024.htm#020)). Leaving Rephidim, the Israelites
advanced into the wilderness of Sinai ([Exo
19:1](../kjv/exo019.htm#001), [Exo 19:2](../kjv/exo019.htm#002); [Num
33:14](../kjv/num033.htm#014), [Num 33:15](../kjv/num033.htm#015)),
marching probably through the two passes of the Wady Solaf and the Wady
esh-Sheikh, which converge at the entrance to the plain er-Rahah, the
"desert of Sinai," which is two miles long and about half a mile broad.
(See SINAI; MERIBAH.)

<span id="003">**Reprobate**</span> That which is rejected on account of
its own worthlessness ([Jer 6:30](../kjv/jer006.htm#030); [Heb
6:8](../kjv/heb006.htm#008); Gr. adokimos , "rejected"). This word is
also used with reference to persons cast away or rejected because they
have failed to make use of opportunities offered them ([Co1
9:27](../kjv/co1009.htm#027); [Co2 13:5](../kjv/co2013.htm#005)).

<span id="004">**Rereward**</span> ([Jos 6:9](../kjv/jos006.htm#009)),
the troops in the rear of an army on the march, the rear-guard. This
word is a corruption of the French arriere-garde. During the wilderness
march the tribe of Dan formed the rear-guard ([Num
10:25](../kjv/num010.htm#025); compare [Sa1
29:2](../kjv/sa1029.htm#002); [Isa 52:12](../kjv/isa052.htm#012); [Isa
58:8](../kjv/isa058.htm#008)).

<span id="005">**Resen**</span> Head of the stream; bridle, one of
Nimrod's cities ([Gen 10:12](../kjv/gen010.htm#012)), "between Nineveh
and Calah." It has been supposed that the four cities named in this
verse were afterwards combined into one under the name of Nineveh
(q.v.). Resen was on the east side of the Tigris. It is probably
identified with the mound of ruins called Karamless.

<span id="006">**Rest**</span> (1.) Gr. katapausis , equivalent to the
Hebrew word noah ([Heb 4:1](../kjv/heb004.htm#001)). (2.) Gr. anapausis
, "rest from weariness" ([Mat 11:28](../kjv/mat011.htm#028)). (3.) Gr.
anesis , "relaxation" ([Th2 1:7](../kjv/th2001.htm#007)). (4.) Gr.
sabbatismos , a Sabbath rest, a rest from all work ([Heb
4:9](../kjv/heb004.htm#009); R.V., "sabbath"), a rest like that of God
when he had finished the work of creation.

<span id="007">**Resurrection of Christ**</span> One of the cardinal
facts and doctrines of the gospel. If Christ be not risen, our faith is
vain ([Co1 15:14](../kjv/co1015.htm#014)). The whole of the New
Testament revelation rests on this as an historical fact. On the day of
Pentecost Peter argued the necessity of Christ's resurrection from the
prediction in [Psa 16:1](../kjv/psa016.htm#001) ([Act
2:24](../kjv/act002.htm#024)). In his own discourses, also, our Lord
clearly intimates his resurrection ([Mat 20:19](../kjv/mat020.htm#019);
[Mar 9:9](../kjv/mar009.htm#009); [Mar 14:28](../kjv/mar014.htm#028);
[Luk 18:33](../kjv/luk018.htm#033); [Joh 2:19](../kjv/joh002.htm#019)).
The evangelists give circumstantial accounts of the facts connected with
that event, and the apostles, also, in their public teaching largely
insist upon it. Ten different appearances of our risen Lord are recorded
in the New Testament. They may be arranged as follows: (1.) To Mary
Magdalene at the sepulchre alone. This is recorded at length only by
John ([Joh 20:11](../kjv/joh020.htm#011)), and alluded to by Mark ([Mar
16:9](../kjv/mar016.htm#009)). (2.) To certain women, "the other Mary,"
Salome, Joanna, and others, as they returned from the sepulchre. Matthew
([Mat 28:1](../kjv/mat028.htm#001)) alone gives an account of this.
(Compare [Mar 16:1](../kjv/mar016.htm#001), and [Luk
24:1](../kjv/luk024.htm#001).) (3.) To Simon Peter alone on the day of
the resurrection. (See [Luk 24:34](../kjv/luk024.htm#034); [Co1
15:5](../kjv/co1015.htm#005).) (4.) To the two disciples on the way to
Emmaus on the day of the resurrection, recorded fully only by Luke (Luke
24:13-35. Compare [Mar 16:12](../kjv/mar016.htm#012), [Mar
16:13](../kjv/mar016.htm#013)). (5.) To the ten disciples (Thomas being
absent) and others "with them," at Jerusalem on the evening of the
resurrection day. One of the evangelists gives an account of this
appearance, John ([Joh 20:19](../kjv/joh020.htm#019)). (6.) To the
disciples again (Thomas being present) at Jerusalem ([Mar
16:14](../kjv/mar016.htm#014); [Luk 24:33](../kjv/luk024.htm#033); [Joh
20:26](../kjv/joh020.htm#026). See also [Co1
15:5](../kjv/co1015.htm#005)). (7.) To the disciples when fishing at the
Sea of Galilee. Of this appearance also John (John 21:1-23) alone gives
an account. (8.) To the eleven, and above 500 brethren at once, at an
appointed place in Galilee ([Co1 15:6](../kjv/co1015.htm#006); compare
[Mat 28:16](../kjv/mat028.htm#016)). (9.) To James, but under what
circumstances we are not informed ([Co1 15:7](../kjv/co1015.htm#007)).
(10.) To the apostles immediately before the ascension. They accompanied
him from Jerusalem to Mount Olivet, and there they saw him ascend "till
a cloud received him out of their sight" ([Mar
16:19](../kjv/mar016.htm#019); [Luk 24:50](../kjv/luk024.htm#050); [Act
1:4](../kjv/act001.htm#004)). It is worthy of note that it is distinctly
related that on most of these occasions our Lord afforded his disciples
the amplest opportunity of testing the fact of his resurrection. He
conversed with them face to face. They touched him ([Mat
28:9](../kjv/mat028.htm#009); [Luk 24:39](../kjv/luk024.htm#039); [Joh
20:27](../kjv/joh020.htm#027)), and he ate bread with them ([Luk
24:42](../kjv/luk024.htm#042), [Luk 24:43](../kjv/luk024.htm#043); [Joh
21:12](../kjv/joh021.htm#012), [Joh 21:13](../kjv/joh021.htm#013)).
(11.) In addition to the above, mention might be made of Christ's
manifestation of himself to Paul at Damascus, who speaks of it as an
appearance of the risen Saviour ([Act 9:3](../kjv/act009.htm#003), [Act
9:17](../kjv/act009.htm#017); [Co1 15:8](../kjv/co1015.htm#008); [Co1
9:1](../kjv/co1009.htm#001)). It is implied in the words of Luke ([Act
1:3](../kjv/act001.htm#003)) that there may have been other appearances
of which we have no record. The resurrection is spoken of as the act
(1.) of God the Father ([Psa 16:10](../kjv/psa016.htm#010); [Act
2:24](../kjv/act002.htm#024); [Act 3:15](../kjv/act003.htm#015); [Rom
8:11](../kjv/rom008.htm#011); [Eph 1:20](../kjv/eph001.htm#020); [Col
2:12](../kjv/col002.htm#012); [Heb 13:20](../kjv/heb013.htm#020)); (2.)
of Christ himself ([Joh 2:19](../kjv/joh002.htm#019); [Joh
10:18](../kjv/joh010.htm#018)); and (3.) of the Holy Spirit ([Pe1
3:18](../kjv/pe1003.htm#018)). The resurrection is a public testimony of
Christ's release from his undertaking as surety, and an evidence of the
Father's acceptance of his work of redemption. It is a victory over
death and the grave for all his followers. The importance of Christ's
resurrection will be seen when we consider that if he rose the gospel is
true, and if he rose not it is false. His resurrection from the dead
makes it manifest that his sacrifice was accepted. Our justification was
secured by his obedience to the death, and therefore he was raised from
the dead ([Rom 4:25](../kjv/rom004.htm#025)). His resurrection is a
proof that he made a full atonement for our sins, that his sacrifice was
accepted as a satisfaction to divine justice, and his blood a ransom for
sinners. It is also a pledge and an earnest of the resurrection of all
believers ([Rom 8:11](../kjv/rom008.htm#011); [Co1
6:14](../kjv/co1006.htm#014); [Co1 15:47](../kjv/co1015.htm#047); [Phi
3:21](../kjv/phi003.htm#021); [Jo1 3:2](../kjv/jo1003.htm#002)). As he
lives, they shall live also. It proved him to be the Son of God,
inasmuch as it authenticated all his claims ([Joh
2:19](../kjv/joh002.htm#019); [Joh 10:17](../kjv/joh010.htm#017)). "If
Christ did not rise, the whole scheme of redemption is a failure, and
all the predictions and anticipations of its glorious results for time
and for eternity, for men and for angels of every rank and order, are
proved to be chimeras. 'But now is Christ risen from the dead, and
become the first-fruits of them that slept.' Therefore the Bible is true
from Genesis to Revelation. The kingdom of darkness has been overthrown,
Satan has fallen as lightning from heaven, and the triumph of truth over
error, of good over evil, of happiness over misery is for ever secured."
Hodge. With reference to the report which the Roman soldiers were bribed
([Mat 28:12](../kjv/mat028.htm#012)) to circulate concerning Christ's
resurrection, "his disciples came by night and stole him away while we
slept," Matthew Henry in his "Commentary," under [Joh
20:1](../kjv/joh020.htm#001), fittingly remarks, "The grave-clothes in
which Christ had been buried were found in very good order, which serves
for an evidence that his body was not 'stolen away while men slept.'
Robbers of tombs have been known to take away 'the clothes' and leave
the body; but none ever took away 'the body' and left the clothes,
especially when they were 'fine linen' and new ([Mar
15:46](../kjv/mar015.htm#046)). Any one would rather choose to carry a
dead body in its clothes than naked. Or if they that were supposed to
have stolen it would have left the grave-clothes behind, yet it cannot
be supposed they would find leisure to 'fold up the linen.'"

<span id="008">**Resurrection of the Dead**</span> Will be simultaneous
both of the just and the unjust ([Dan 12:2](../kjv/dan012.htm#002); [Joh
5:28](../kjv/joh005.htm#028), [Joh 5:29](../kjv/joh005.htm#029); [Rom
2:6](../kjv/rom002.htm#006); [Th2 1:6](../kjv/th2001.htm#006)). The
qualities of the resurrection body will be different from those of the
body laid in the grave ([Co1 15:53](../kjv/co1015.htm#053), [Co1
15:54](../kjv/co1015.htm#054); [Phi 3:21](../kjv/phi003.htm#021)); but
its identity will nevertheless be preserved. It will still be the same
body ([Co1 15:42](../kjv/co1015.htm#042)) which rises again. As to the
nature of the resurrection body, (1.) it will be spiritual ([Co1
15:44](../kjv/co1015.htm#044)), i.e., a body adapted to the use of the
soul in its glorified state, and to all the conditions of the heavenly
state; (2.) glorious, incorruptible, and powerful ([Co1
15:54](../kjv/co1015.htm#054)); (3.) like unto the glorified body of
Christ ([Phi 3:21](../kjv/phi003.htm#021)); and (4.) immortal ([Rev
21:4](../kjv/rev021.htm#004)). Christ's resurrection secures and
illustrates that of his people. (1.) Because his resurrection seals and
consummates his redemptive power; and the redemption of our persons
involves the redemption of our bodies ([Rom
8:23](../kjv/rom008.htm#023)). (2.) Because of our federal and vital
union with Christ ([Co1 15:21](../kjv/co1015.htm#021), [Co1
15:22](../kjv/co1015.htm#022); [Th1 4:14](../kjv/th1004.htm#014)). (3.)
Because of his Spirit which dwells in us making our bodies his members
([Co1 6:15](../kjv/co1006.htm#015); [Rom 8:11](../kjv/rom008.htm#011)).
(4.) Because Christ by covenant is Lord both of the living and the dead
([Rom 14:9](../kjv/rom014.htm#009)). This same federal and vital union
of the Christian with Christ likewise causes the resurrection of the
believer to be similar to as well as consequent upon that of Christ
([Co1 15:49](../kjv/co1015.htm#049); [Phi 3:21](../kjv/phi003.htm#021);
[Jo1 3:2](../kjv/jo1003.htm#002)). Hodge's Outlines of Theology.

<span id="009">**Reuben**</span> Behold a son!, the eldest son of Jacob
and Leah ([Gen 29:32](../kjv/gen029.htm#032)). His sinful conduct,
referred to in [Gen 35:22](../kjv/gen035.htm#022), brought down upon him
his dying father's malediction ([Gen 48:4](../kjv/gen048.htm#004)). He
showed kindness to Joseph, and was the means of saving his life when his
other brothers would have put him to death ([Gen
37:21](../kjv/gen037.htm#021), [Gen 37:22](../kjv/gen037.htm#022)). It
was he also who pledged his life and the life of his sons when Jacob was
unwilling to let Benjamin go down into Egypt. After Jacob and his family
went down into Egypt ([Gen 46:8](../kjv/gen046.htm#008)) no further
mention is made of Reuben beyond what is recorded in [Gen
49:3](../kjv/gen049.htm#003), [Gen 49:4](../kjv/gen049.htm#004).
