<span id="000">**Pallu**</span> Separated, the second son of Reuben
([Ch1 5:3](../kjv/ch1005.htm#003)); called Phallu, [Gen
46:9](../kjv/gen046.htm#009). He was the father of the Phalluites ([Exo
6:14](../kjv/exo006.htm#014); [Num 26:5](../kjv/num026.htm#005), [Num
26:8](../kjv/num026.htm#008)).

<span id="001">**Palm Tree**</span> (Heb. tamar ), the date-palm
characteristic of Palestine. It is described as "flourishing" ([Psa
92:12](../kjv/psa092.htm#012)), tall ([Sol 7:7](../kjv/sol007.htm#007)),
"upright" ([Jer 10:5](../kjv/jer010.htm#005)). Its branches are a symbol
of victory ([Rev 7:9](../kjv/rev007.htm#009)). "Rising with slender stem
40 or 50, at times even 80, feet aloft, its only branches, the feathery,
snow-like, pale-green fronds from 6 to 12 feet long, bending from its
top, the palm attracts the eye wherever it is seen." The whole land of
Palestine was called by the Greeks and Romans Phoenicia, i.e., "the land
of palms." Tadmor in the desert was called by the Greeks and Romans
Palmyra, i.e., "the city of palms." The finest specimens of this tree
grew at Jericho ([Deu 34:3](../kjv/deu034.htm#003)) and Engedi and along
the banks of the Jordan. Branches of the palm tree were carried at the
feast of Tabernacles ([Lev 23:40](../kjv/lev023.htm#040)). At our Lord's
triumphal entrance into Jerusalem the crowds took palm branches, and
went forth to meet him, crying, "Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel
that cometh in the name of the Lord" ([Mat 21:8](../kjv/mat021.htm#008);
[Joh 12:13](../kjv/joh012.htm#013)). (See DATE.)

<span id="002">**Palm Trees, The City of**</span> The name given to
Jericho (q.v.), [Deu 34:3](../kjv/deu034.htm#003); [Jdg
1:16](../kjv/jdg001.htm#016); [Jdg 3:13](../kjv/jdg003.htm#013).

<span id="003">**Palmer-worm**</span> (Heb. gazam ). The English word
may denote either a caterpillar (as rendered by the LXX.), which wanders
like a palmer or pilgrim, or which travels like pilgrims in bands ([Joe
1:4](../kjv/joe001.htm#004); [Joe 2:25](../kjv/joe002.htm#025)), the
wingless locusts, or the migratory locust in its larva state.

<span id="004">**Palsy**</span> A shorter form of "paralysis." Many
persons thus afflicted were cured by our Lord ([Mat
4:24](../kjv/mat004.htm#024); [Mat 8:5](../kjv/mat008.htm#005); [Mat
9:2](../kjv/mat009.htm#002); [Mar 2:3](../kjv/mar002.htm#003); [Luk
7:2](../kjv/luk007.htm#002); [Joh 5:5](../kjv/joh005.htm#005)) and the
apostles ([Act 8:7](../kjv/act008.htm#007); [Act
9:33](../kjv/act009.htm#033), [Act 9:34](../kjv/act009.htm#034)).

<span id="005">**Palti**</span> Deliverance from the Lord, one of the
spies representing the tribe of Benjamin ([Num
13:9](../kjv/num013.htm#009)).

<span id="006">**Paltiel**</span> Deliverance of God, the prince of
Issachar who assisted "to divide the land by inheritance" ([Num
34:26](../kjv/num034.htm#026)).

<span id="007">**Paltite**</span> The designation of one of David's
heroes ([Sa2 23:26](../kjv/sa2023.htm#026)); called also the Pelonite
([Ch1 11:27](../kjv/ch1011.htm#027)).

<span id="008">**Pamphylia**</span> Paul and his company, loosing from
Paphos, sailed north-west and came to Perga, the capital of Pamphylia
([Act 13:13](../kjv/act013.htm#013), [Act
13:14](../kjv/act013.htm#014)), a province about the middle of the
southern sea-board of Asia Minor. It lay between Lycia on the west and
Cilicia on the east. There were strangers from Pamphylia at Jerusalem on
the day of Pentecost ([Act 2:10](../kjv/act002.htm#010)).

<span id="009">**Pan**</span> A vessel of metal or earthenware used in
culinary operations; a cooking-pan or frying-pan frequently referred to
in the Old Testament ([Lev 2:5](../kjv/lev002.htm#005); [Lev
6:21](../kjv/lev006.htm#021); [Num 11:8](../kjv/num011.htm#008); [Sa1
2:14](../kjv/sa1002.htm#014), etc.). The "ash-pans" mentioned in [Exo
27:3](../kjv/exo027.htm#003) were made of copper, and were used in
connection with the altar of burnt-offering. The "iron pan" mentioned in
[Eze 4:3](../kjv/eze004.htm#003) (marg., "flat plate " or "slice") was
probably a mere plate of iron used for baking. The "fire-pans" of [Exo
27:3](../kjv/exo027.htm#003) were fire-shovels used for taking up coals.
The same Hebrew word is rendered "snuff-dishes" ([Exo
25:38](../kjv/exo025.htm#038); [Exo 37:23](../kjv/exo037.htm#023)) and
"censers" ([Lev 10:1](../kjv/lev010.htm#001); [Lev
16:12](../kjv/lev016.htm#012); [Num 4:14](../kjv/num004.htm#014), etc.).
These were probably simply metal vessels employed for carrying burning
embers from the brazen altar to the altar of incense. The "frying-pan"
mentioned in [Lev 2:7](../kjv/lev002.htm#007); [Lev
7:9](../kjv/lev007.htm#009) was a pot for boiling.
