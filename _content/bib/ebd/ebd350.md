<span id="000">**Spirit, Holy**</span> See HOLY GHOST.

<span id="001">**Sponge**</span> Occurs only in the narrative of the
crucifixion ([Mat 27:48](../kjv/mat027.htm#048); [Mar
15:36](../kjv/mar015.htm#036); [Joh 19:29](../kjv/joh019.htm#029)). It
is ranked as a zoophyte. It is found attached to rocks at the bottom of
the sea.

<span id="002">**Spouse**</span> ([Sol 4:8](../kjv/sol004.htm#008); [Hos
4:13](../kjv/hos004.htm#013), [Hos 4:14](../kjv/hos004.htm#014)) may
denote either husband or wife, but in the Scriptures it denotes only the
latter.

<span id="003">**Spring**</span> (Heb. 'ain , "the bright open source,
the eye of the landscape"). To be carefully distinguished from "well"
(q.v.). "Springs" mentioned in [Jos 10:40](../kjv/jos010.htm#040) (Heb.
'ashdoth ) should rather be "declivities" or "slopes" (R.V.), i.e., the
undulating ground lying between the lowlands (the shephelah ) and the
central range of hills.

<span id="004">**Stachys**</span> Spike; an ear of corn, a convert at
Rome whom Paul salutes ([Rom 16:9](../kjv/rom016.htm#009)).

<span id="005">**Stacte**</span> (Heb. nataph ), one of the components
of the perfume which was offered on the golden altar ([Exo
30:34](../kjv/exo030.htm#034); R.V. marg., " opobalsamum "). The Hebrew
word is from a root meaning "to distil," and it has been by some
interpreted as distilled myrrh. Others regard it as the gum of the
storax tree, or rather shrub, the Styrax officinale. "The Syrians value
this gum highly, and use it medicinally as an emulsion in pectoral
complaints, and also in perfumery."

<span id="006">**Star, Morning**</span> A name figuratively given to
Christ ([Rev 22:16](../kjv/rev022.htm#016); compare [Pe2
1:19](../kjv/pe2001.htm#019)). When Christ promises that he will give
the "morning star" to his faithful ones, he "promises that he will give
to them himself, that he will give to them himself, that he will impart
to them his own glory and a share in his own royal dominion; for the
star is evermore the symbol of royalty ([Mat
2:2](../kjv/mat002.htm#002)), being therefore linked with the sceptre
([Num 24:17](../kjv/num024.htm#017)). All the glory of the world shall
end in being the glory of the Church." Trench's Comm.

<span id="007">**Stargazers**</span> ([Isa
47:13](../kjv/isa047.htm#013)), those who pretend to tell what will
occur by looking upon the stars. The Chaldean astrologers "divined by
the rising and setting, the motions, aspects, colour, degree of light,
etc., of the stars."

<span id="008">**Stars**</span> The eleven stars ([Gen
37:9](../kjv/gen037.htm#009)); the seven ([Amo
5:8](../kjv/amo005.htm#008)); wandering ([Jde
1:13](../kjv/jde001.htm#013)); seen in the east at the birth of Christ,
probably some luminous meteors miraculously formed for this specific
purpose ([Mat 2:2](../kjv/mat002.htm#002)); stars worshipped ([Deu
4:19](../kjv/deu004.htm#019); [Kg2 17:16](../kjv/kg2017.htm#016); [Kg2
21:3](../kjv/kg2021.htm#003); [Jer 19:13](../kjv/jer019.htm#013));
spoken of symbolically ([Num 24:17](../kjv/num024.htm#017); [Rev
1:16](../kjv/rev001.htm#016), [Rev 1:20](../kjv/rev001.htm#020); [Rev
12:1](../kjv/rev012.htm#001)). (See ASTROLOGERS.)

<span id="009">**Stater**</span> Greek word rendered "piece of money"
([Mat 17:27](../kjv/mat017.htm#027), A.V.; and "shekel" in R.V.). It was
equal to two didrachmas ("tribute money," [Mat
17:24](../kjv/mat017.htm#024)), or four drachmas , and to about 2s. 6d.
of our money. (See SHEKEL.)
