<P><A NAME="000"><B>Kirjath</B></A>     City, a city belonging to Benjamin (<A HREF="../kjv/jos018.htm#028">Jos 18:28</A>), the modern Kuriet el- 'Enab , i.e., &quot;city of grapes&quot;, about 7 1/2 miles west-north-west of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Kirjathaim</B></A>     Two cities; a double city.     (1.) A city of refuge in Naphtali (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1006.htm#076">Ch1 6:76</A>). (2.) A town on the east of Jordan (<A HREF="../kjv/gen014.htm#005">Gen 14:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu002.htm#009">Deu 2:9</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/deu002.htm#010">Deu 2:10</A>). It was assigned to the tribe of Reuben (<A HREF="../kjv/num032.htm#037">Num 32:37</A>). In the time of Ezekiel (<A HREF="../kjv/eze025.htm#009">Eze 25:9</A>) it was one of the four cities which formed the &quot;glory of Moab&quot; (Compare <A HREF="../kjv/jer048.htm#001">Jer 48:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jer048.htm#023">Jer 48:23</A>). It has been identified with el-Kureiyat, 11 miles south-west of Medeba, on the south slope of jebel Attarus, the ancient Ataroth. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Kirjath-arba</B></A>     City of Arba, the original name of Hebron (q.v.), so called from the name of its founder, one of the Anakim (<A HREF="../kjv/gen023.htm#002">Gen 23:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen035.htm#027">Gen 35:27</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#013">Jos 15:13</A>). It was given to Caleb by Joshua as his portion. The Jews interpret the name as meaning &quot;the city of the four&quot;, i.e., of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Adam, who were all, as they allege, buried there. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Kirjath-huzoth</B></A>     City of streets, <A HREF="../kjv/num022.htm#039">Num 22:39</A>, a Moabite city, which some identify with Kirjathaim. Balak here received and entertained Balaam, whom he had invited from Pethor, among the &quot;mountains of the east,&quot; beyond the Euphrates, to lay his ban upon the Israelites, whose progress he had no hope otherwise of arresting. It was probably from the summit of Attarus, the high place near the city, that the soothsayer first saw the encampments of Israel. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Kirjath-jearim</B></A>     City of Jaars; i.e., of woods or forests, a Gibeonite town (<A HREF="../kjv/jos009.htm#017">Jos 9:17</A>) on the border of Benjamin, to which tribe it was assigned (<A HREF="../kjv/jos018.htm#015">Jos 18:15</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jos018.htm#028">Jos 18:28</A>). The ark was brought to this place (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1007.htm#001">Sa1 7:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1007.htm#002">Sa1 7:2</A>) from Beth-shemesh and put in charge of Abinadab, a Levite. Here it remained till it was removed by David to Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2006.htm#002">Sa2 6:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa2006.htm#003">Sa2 6:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa2006.htm#012">Sa2 6:12</A>; 1 Chr. 15:1-29; compare Ps. 132). It was also called Baalah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#009">Jos 15:9</A>) and Kirjath-baal (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#060">Jos 15:60</A>). It has been usually identified with  Kuriet el-'Enab  (i.e., &quot;city of grapes&quot;), among the hills, about 8 miles north-east of  'Ain Shems  (i.e., Beth-shemesh). The opinion, however, that it is to be identified with  'Erma , 4 miles east of  'Ain Shems , on the edge of the valley of Sorek, seems to be better supported. (See KIRJATH.) The words of <A HREF="../kjv/psa132.htm#006">Psa 132:6</A>, &quot;We found it in the fields of the wood,&quot; refer to the sojourn of the ark at Kirjath-jearim. &quot;Wood&quot; is here the rendering of the Hebrew word jaar, which is the singular of jearim. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Kirjath-sannah</B></A>     City of the sannah; i.e., of the palm(?), <A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#049">Jos 15:49</A>; the same as Kirjath-sepher (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#016">Jos 15:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jdg001.htm#011">Jdg 1:11</A>) and Debir (q.v.), a Canaanitish royal city included in Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos010.htm#038">Jos 10:38</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#049">Jos 15:49</A>), and probably the chief seat of learning among the Hittites. It was about 12 miles to the south-west of Hebron. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Kirjath-sepher</B></A>     City of books, <A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#015">Jos 15:15</A>; same as Kirjath-sannah (q.v.), now represented by the valley of ed-Dhaberiyeh, south-west of Hebron. The name of this town is an evidence that the Canaanites were acquainted with writing and books. &quot;The town probably contained a noted school, or was the site of an oracle and the residence of some learned priest.&quot; The &quot;books&quot; were probably engraved stones or bricks. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Kish</B></A>     A bow.     (1.) A Levite of the family of Merari (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1023.htm#021">Ch1 23:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1024.htm#029">Ch1 24:29</A>). (2.) A Benjamite of Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1008.htm#030">Ch1 8:30</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1009.htm#036">Ch1 9:36</A>). (3.) A Levite in the time of Hezekiah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2029.htm#012">Ch2 29:12</A>). (4.) The great-grandfather of Mordecai (<A HREF="../kjv/est002.htm#005">Est 2:5</A>). (5.) A Benjamite, the son of Abiel, and father of king Saul (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1009.htm#001">Sa1 9:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1009.htm#003">Sa1 9:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1010.htm#011">Sa1 10:11</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1010.htm#021">Sa1 10:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1014.htm#051">Sa1 14:51</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa2021.htm#014">Sa2 21:14</A>). All that is recorded of him is that he sent his son Saul in search of his asses that had strayed, and that he was buried in Zelah. Called Cis, <A HREF="../kjv/act013.htm#021">Act 13:21</A> (R.V., Kish). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Kishion</B></A>     Hardness, a city of Issachar assigned to the Gershonite Levites (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#020">Jos 19:20</A>), the same as Kishon (<A HREF="../kjv/jos021.htm#028">Jos 21:28</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Kishon</B></A>     Winding, a winter torrent of Central Palestine, which rises about the roots of Tabor and Gilboa, and passing in a northerly direction through the plains of Esdraelon and Acre, falls into the Mediterranean at the north-eastern corner of the bay of Acre, at the foot of Carmel. It is the drain by which the waters of the plain of Esdraelon and of the mountains that surround it find their way to the sea. It bears the modern name of Nahr el-Mokattah, i.e., &quot;the river of slaughter&quot; (Compare <A HREF="../kjv/kg1018.htm#040">Kg1 18:40</A>). In the triumphal song of Deborah (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg005.htm#021">Jdg 5:21</A>) it is spoken of as &quot;that ancient river,&quot; either     (1.) because it had flowed on for ages, or (2.) according to the Targum, because it was &quot;the torrent in which were shown signs and wonders to Israel of old;&quot; or (3.) probably the reference is to the exploits in that region among the ancient Canaanites, for the adjoining plain of Esdraelon was the great battle-field of Palestine.    This was the scene of the defeat of Sisera (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg004.htm#007">Jdg 4:7</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jdg004.htm#013">Jdg 4:13</A>), and of the destruction of the prophets of Baal by Elijah (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1018.htm#040">Kg1 18:40</A>). &quot;When the Kishon was at its height, it would be, partly on account of its quicksand, as impassable as the ocean itself to a retreating army.&quot; (See DEBORAH.)
