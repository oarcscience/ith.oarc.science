<span id="000">**Hallelujah**</span> Praise ye Jehovah, frequently
rendered "Praise ye the Lord," stands at the beginning of ten of the
psalms (Ps. 106, 111-113, 135, 146 - 150), hence called "hallelujah
psalms." From its frequent occurrence it grew into a formula of praise.
The Greek form of the word ( alleluia ) is found in [Rev
19:1](../kjv/rev019.htm#001), [Rev 19:3](../kjv/rev019.htm#003), [Rev
19:4](../kjv/rev019.htm#004), [Rev 19:6](../kjv/rev019.htm#006).

<span id="001">**Hallow**</span> To render sacred, to consecrate ([Exo
28:38](../kjv/exo028.htm#038); [Exo 29:1](../kjv/exo029.htm#001)). This
word is from the Saxon, and properly means "to make holy." The name of
God is "hallowed", i.e., is reverenced as holy ([Mat
6:9](../kjv/mat006.htm#009)).

<span id="002">**Halt**</span> Lame on the feet ([Gen
32:31](../kjv/gen032.htm#031); [Psa 38:17](../kjv/psa038.htm#017)). To
"halt between two opinions" ([Kg1 18:21](../kjv/kg1018.htm#021)) is
supposed by some to be an expression used in "allusion to birds, which
hop from spray to spray, forwards and backwards." The LXX. render the
expression "How long go ye lame on both knees?" The Hebrew verb rendered
"halt" is used of the irregular dance ("leaped upon") around the altar
([Kg1 18:26](../kjv/kg1018.htm#026)). It indicates a lame, uncertain
gait, going now in one direction, now in another, in the frenzy of wild
leaping.

<span id="003">**Ham**</span> Warm, hot, and hence the south; also an
Egyptian word meaning "black", the youngest son of Noah ([Gen
5:32](../kjv/gen005.htm#032); compare [Gen 9:22](../kjv/gen009.htm#022),
[Gen 9:24](../kjv/gen009.htm#024)). The curse pronounced by Noah against
Ham, properly against Canaan his fourth son, was accomplished when the
Jews subsequently exterminated the Canaanites. One of the most important
facts recorded in Gen. 10 is the foundation of the earliest monarchy in
Babylonia by Nimrod the grandson of Ham ([Gen
10:6](../kjv/gen010.htm#006), [Gen 10:8](../kjv/gen010.htm#008), [Gen
10:10](../kjv/gen010.htm#010)). The primitive Babylonian empire was thus
Hamitic, and of a cognate race with the primitive inhabitants of Arabia
and of Ethiopia. (See ACCAD.) The race of Ham were the most energetic of
all the descendants of Noah in the early times of the post-diluvian
world. See table: Ham Families scattered to the extreme south Cush
Mizraim Phut Canaan The Ethiopians and their colonies The Egyptians and
their colonies The Libyans and Mauritanians The Canaanites, Phoenicians,
and their colonies

<span id="004">**Haman**</span> Of Persian origin), magnificent, the
name of the vizier (i.e., the prime minister) of the Persian king
Ahasuerus ([Est 3:1](../kjv/est003.htm#001), etc.). He is called an
"Agagite," which seems to denote that he was descended from the royal
family of the Amalekites, the bitterest enemies of the Jews, as Agag was
one of the titles of the Amalekite kings. He or his parents were brought
to Persia as captives taken in war. He was hanged on the gallows which
he had erected for Mordecai the Jew ([Est 7:10](../kjv/est007.htm#010)).
(See ESTHER.)

<span id="005">**Hamath**</span> Fortress, the capital of one of the
kingdoms of Upper Syria of the same name, on the Orontes, in the valley
of Lebanon, at the northern boundary of Palestine ([Num
13:21](../kjv/num013.htm#021); [Num 34:8](../kjv/num034.htm#008)), at
the foot of Hermon ([Jos 13:5](../kjv/jos013.htm#005)) towards Damascus
([Zac 9:2](../kjv/zac009.htm#002); [Jer 49:23](../kjv/jer049.htm#023)).
It is called "Hamath the great" in [Amo 6:2](../kjv/amo006.htm#002), and
"Hamath-zobah" in [Ch2 8:3](../kjv/ch2008.htm#003). Hamath, now Hamah,
had an Aramaean population, but Hittite monuments discovered there show
that it must have been at one time occupied by the Hittites. It was
among the conquests of the Pharaoh Thothmes III. Its king, Tou or Toi,
made alliance with David ([Sa2 8:10](../kjv/sa2008.htm#010)), and in 740
B.C. Azariah formed a league with it against Assyria. It was, however,
conquered by the Assyrians, and its nineteen districts placed under
Assyrian governors. In 720 B.C. it revolted under a certain Yahu-bihdi,
whose name, compounded with that of the God of Israel (Yahu), perhaps
shows that he was of Jewish origin. But the revolt was suppressed, and
the people of Hamath were transported to Samaria ([Kg2
17:24](../kjv/kg2017.htm#024), [Kg2 17:30](../kjv/kg2017.htm#030)),
where they continued to worship their god Ashima. Hamah is beautifully
situated on the Orontes, 32 miles north of Emesa, and 36 south of the
ruins of Assamea. The kingdom of Hamath comprehended the great plain
lying on both banks of the Orontes from the fountain near Riblah to
Assamea on the north, and from Lebanon on the west to the desert on the
east. The "entrance of Hamath" ([Num 34:8](../kjv/num034.htm#008)),
which was the north boundary of Palestine, led from the west between the
north end of Lebanon and the Nusairiyeh mountains.

<span id="006">**Hamath-zobah**</span> Fortress of Zobah, ([Ch2
8:3](../kjv/ch2008.htm#003)) is supposed by some to be a different place
from the foregoing; but this is quite uncertain.

<span id="007">**Hammath**</span> Warm springs, one of the "fenced
cities" of Naphtali ([Jos 19:35](../kjv/jos019.htm#035)). It is
identified with the warm baths (the heat of the water ranging from 136
degrees to 144 degrees) still found on the shore a little to the south
of Tiberias under the name of Hummam Tabariyeh ("Bath of Tiberias").

<span id="008">**Hammedatha**</span> Father of Haman, designated usually
"the Agagite" ([Est 3:1](../kjv/est003.htm#001), [Est
3:10](../kjv/est003.htm#010); [Est 8:5](../kjv/est008.htm#005)).

<span id="009">**Hammelech**</span> The king's, the father of Jerahmeel,
mentioned in [Jer 36:26](../kjv/jer036.htm#026). Some take this word as
a common noun, "the king", and understand that Jerahmeel was Jehoiakim's
son. Probably, however, it is to be taken as a proper name.
