<span id="000">**Israel**</span> The name conferred on Jacob after the
great prayer-struggle at Peniel ([Gen 32:28](../kjv/gen032.htm#028)),
because "as a prince he had power with God and prevailed." (See JACOB.)
This is the common name given to Jacob's descendants. The whole people
of the twelve tribes are called "Israelites," the "children of Israel"
([Jos 3:17](../kjv/jos003.htm#017); [Jos 7:25](../kjv/jos007.htm#025);
[Jdg 8:27](../kjv/jdg008.htm#027); [Jer 3:21](../kjv/jer003.htm#021)),
and the "house of Israel" ([Exo 16:31](../kjv/exo016.htm#031); [Exo
40:38](../kjv/exo040.htm#038)). This name Israel is sometimes used
emphatically for the true Israel ([Psa 73:1](../kjv/psa073.htm#001);
[Isa 45:17](../kjv/isa045.htm#017); [Isa 49:3](../kjv/isa049.htm#003);
[Joh 1:47](../kjv/joh001.htm#047); [Rom 9:6](../kjv/rom009.htm#006);
[Rom 11:26](../kjv/rom011.htm#026)). After the death of Saul the ten
tribes arrogated to themselves this name, as if they were the whole
nation ([Sa2 2:9](../kjv/sa2002.htm#009), [Sa2
2:10](../kjv/sa2002.htm#010), [Sa2 2:17](../kjv/sa2002.htm#017), [Sa2
2:28](../kjv/sa2002.htm#028); [Sa2 3:10](../kjv/sa2003.htm#010), [Sa2
3:17](../kjv/sa2003.htm#017); [Sa2 19:40](../kjv/sa2019.htm#040)), and
the kings of the ten tribes were called "kings of Israel," while the
kings of the two tribes were called "kings of Judah." After the Exile
the name Israel was assumed as designating the entire nation.

<span id="001">**Israel, Kingdom of**</span> (975-722 B.C.). Soon after
the death of Solomon, Ahijah's prophecy ([Kg1
11:31](../kjv/kg1011.htm#031)) was fulfilled, and the kingdom was rent
in twain. See map, Kingdoms of Israel and Judah Rehoboam, the son and
successor of Solomon, was scarcely seated on his throne when the old
jealousies between Judah and the other tribes broke out anew, and
Jeroboam was sent for from Egypt by the malcontents ([Kg1
12:2](../kjv/kg1012.htm#002), [Kg1 12:3](../kjv/kg1012.htm#003)).
Rehoboam insolently refused to lighten the burdensome taxation and
services which his father had imposed on his subjects ([Kg1
12:4](../kjv/kg1012.htm#004)), and the rebellion became complete.
Ephraim and all Israel raised the old cry, "Every man to his tents, O
Israel" ([Sa2 20:1](../kjv/sa2020.htm#001)). Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem
(1 Kings 12:1-18; 2 Chr. 10), and Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all
Israel at Shechem, Judah and Benjamin remaining faithful to Solomon's
son. War, with varying success, was carried on between the two kingdoms
for about sixty years, till Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with
the house of Ahab. See table of Kingdoms: Kingdoms of Israel and Judah

Extent of the kingdom. In the time of Solomon the area of Palestine
excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore of the Mediterranean
did not much exceed 13000 square miles. The kingdom of Israel
comprehended about 9375 square miles. Shechem was the first capital of
this kingdom ([Kg1 12:25](../kjv/kg1012.htm#025)) afterwards Tirza ([Kg1
14:17](../kjv/kg1014.htm#017)). Samaria was subsequently chosen as the
capital ([Kg1 16:24](../kjv/kg1016.htm#024)) and continued to be so till
the destruction of the kingdom by the Assyrians ([Kg2
17:5](../kjv/kg2017.htm#005)). During the siege of Samaria (which lasted
for three years) by the Assyrians Shalmaneser died and was succeeded by
Sargon who himself thus records the capture of that city: "Samaria I
looked at I captured; 27280 men who dwelt in it I carried away" ([Kg2
17:6](../kjv/kg2017.htm#006)) into Assyria. Thus after a duration of two
hundred and fifty-three years the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an
end. They were scattered throughout the East. (See CAPTIVITY.) "Judah
held its ground against Assyria for yet one hundred and twenty-three
years and became the rallying-point of the dispersed of every tribe and
eventually gave its name to the whole race. Those of the people who in
the last struggle escaped into the territories of Judah or other
neighbouring countries naturally looked to Judah as the head and home of
their race. And when Judah itself was carried off to Babylon many of the
exiled Israelites joined them from Assyria and swelled that immense
population which made Babylonia a second Palestine." After the
deportation of the ten tribes the deserted land was colonized by various
eastern tribes whom the king of Assyria sent thither ([Ezr
4:2](../kjv/ezr004.htm#002) [Ezr 4:10](../kjv/ezr004.htm#010); [Kg2
17:24](../kjv/kg2017.htm#024)). (See KINGS.) In contrast with the
kingdom of Judah is that of Israel. (1.) "There was no fixed capital and
no religious centre. (2.) The army was often insubordinate. (3.) The
succession was constantly interrupted so that out of nineteen kings
there were no less than nine dynasties each ushered in by a revolution.
(4.) The authorized priests left the kingdom in a body and the
priesthood established by Jeroboam had no divine sanction and no
promise; it was corrupt at its very source." (Maclean's O. T. Hist.)

<span id="002">**Issachar**</span> Hired ([Gen
30:18](../kjv/gen030.htm#018)). "God hath given me," said Leah, "my hire
(Heb. sekhari )... and she called his name Issachar." He was Jacob's
ninth son, and was born in Padan-aram (compare [Gen
28:2](../kjv/gen028.htm#002)). He had four sons at the going down into
Egypt ([Gen 46:13](../kjv/gen046.htm#013); [Num
26:23](../kjv/num026.htm#023), [Num 26:25](../kjv/num026.htm#025)).
Issachar, Tribe of, during the journey through the wilderness, along
with Judah and Zebulun ([Num 2:5](../kjv/num002.htm#005)), marched on
the east of the tabernacle. This tribe contained 54,400 fighting men
when the census was taken at Sinai. After the entrance into the Promised
Land, this tribe was one of the six which stood on Gerizim during the
ceremony of the blessing and cursing ([Deu
27:12](../kjv/deu027.htm#012)). The allotment of Issachar is described
in [Jos 19:17](../kjv/jos019.htm#017). It included the plain of
Esdraelon (= Jezreel), which was and still is the richest portion of
Palestine ([Deu 33:18](../kjv/deu033.htm#018), [Deu
33:19](../kjv/deu033.htm#019); [Ch1 12:40](../kjv/ch1012.htm#040)). The
prophetic blessing pronounced by Jacob on Issachar corresponds with that
of Moses ([Gen 49:14](../kjv/gen049.htm#014), [Gen
49:15](../kjv/gen049.htm#015); compare [Deu
33:18](../kjv/deu033.htm#018), [Deu 33:19](../kjv/deu033.htm#019)).

<span id="003">**Italian band**</span> The name of the Roman cohort to
which Cornelius belonged ([Act 10:1](../kjv/act010.htm#001)), so called
probably because it consisted of men recruited in Italy.

<span id="004">**Italy**</span> [Act 18:2](../kjv/act018.htm#002); [Act
27:1](../kjv/act027.htm#001), [Act 27:6](../kjv/act027.htm#006); [Heb
13:24](../kjv/heb013.htm#024)), like most geographical names, was
differently used at different periods of history. As the power of Rome
advanced, nations were successively conquered and added to it till it
came to designate the whole country to the south of the Alps. There was
constant intercourse between Palestine and Italy in the time of the
Romans.

<span id="005">**Ithamar**</span> Palm isle, the fourth and youngest son
of Aaron ([Ch1 6:3](../kjv/ch1006.htm#003)). He was consecrated to the
priesthood along with his brothers ([Exo 6:23](../kjv/exo006.htm#023));
and after the death of Nadab and Abihu, he and Eleazar alone discharged
the functions of that office ([Lev 10:6](../kjv/lev010.htm#006), [Lev
10:12](../kjv/lev010.htm#012); [Num 3:4](../kjv/num003.htm#004)). He and
his family occupied the position of common priest till the high
priesthood passed into his family in the person of Eli ([Kg1
2:27](../kjv/kg1002.htm#027)), the reasons for which are not recorded.
(See ZADOK.)

<span id="006">**Ithrite**</span> Two of David's warriors so designated
([Sa2 23:38](../kjv/sa2023.htm#038); [Ch1
11:40](../kjv/ch1011.htm#040)).

<span id="007">**Ittai**</span> Near; timely; or, with the Lord. (1.) A
Benjamite, one of David's thirty heroes ([Sa2
23:29](../kjv/sa2023.htm#029)). (2.) A native of Gath, a Philistine, who
had apparently the command of the six hundred heroes who formed David's
band during his wanderings ([Sa2 15:19](../kjv/sa2015.htm#019); compare
[Sa1 23:13](../kjv/sa1023.htm#013); [Sa1 27:2](../kjv/sa1027.htm#002);
[Sa1 30:9](../kjv/sa1030.htm#009), [Sa1 30:10](../kjv/sa1030.htm#010)).
He is afterwards with David at Mahanaim, holding in the army equal rank
with Joab and Abishai ([Sa2 18:2](../kjv/sa2018.htm#002), [Sa2
18:5](../kjv/sa2018.htm#005), [Sa2 18:12](../kjv/sa2018.htm#012)). He
then passes from view.

<span id="008">**Ituraea**</span> A district in the north-east of
Palestine, forming, along with the adjacent territory of Trachonitis,
the tetrarchy of Philip ([Luk 3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001)). The present
Jedur comprehends the chief part of Ituraea. It is bounded on the east
by Trachonitis, on the south by Gaulanitis, on the west by Hermon, and
on the north by the plain of Damascus.

<span id="009">**Ivah**</span> Overturning, a city of the Assyrians,
whence colonists were brought to Samaria ([Kg2
18:34](../kjv/kg2018.htm#034); [Kg2 19:13](../kjv/kg2019.htm#013)). It
lay on the Euphrates, between Sepharvaim and Henah, and is supposed by
some to have been the Ahava of Ezra ([Ezr 8:15](../kjv/ezr008.htm#015)).
