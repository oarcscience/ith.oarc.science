<P><A NAME="000"><B>Besor</B></A>     Cold, a ravine or brook in the extreme south-west of Judah, where 200 of David's men stayed behind because they were faint, while the other 400 pursued the Amalekites (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1030.htm#009">Sa1 30:9</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1030.htm#010">Sa1 30:10</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1030.htm#021">Sa1 30:21</A>). Probably the Wady Sheriah, south of Gaza.

<P><A NAME="004"><B>Bethabara</B></A>     House of the ford, a place on the east bank of the Jordan, where John was baptizing (<A HREF="../kjv/joh001.htm#028">Joh 1:28</A>). It may be identical with Bethbarah, the ancient ford of Jordan of which the men of Ephraim took possession (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg007.htm#024">Jdg 7:24</A>). The Revised Version reads &quot;Bethany beyond Jordan.&quot; It was the great ford, and still bears the name of &quot;the ford,&quot; Makhadhet  'Abarah , &quot;the ford of crossing over,&quot; about 25 miles from Nazareth. (See BETH-BARAH.)

<P><A NAME="005"><B>Beth-anath</B></A>     House of response, one of the fenced cities of Naphtali (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#038">Jos 19:38</A>). It is perhaps identical with the modern village  'Ainata , 6 miles west of Kedesh.

</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Bethany</B></A>     House of dates.     (1.) The Revised Version in <A HREF="../kjv/joh001.htm#028">Joh 1:28</A> has this word instead of Bethabara, on the authority of the oldest manuscripts. It appears to have been the name of a place on the east of Jordan. (2.) A village on the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives (<A HREF="../kjv/mar011.htm#001">Mar 11:1</A>), about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, on the road to Jericho. It derived its name from the number of palm-trees which grew there. It was the residence of Lazarus and his sisters. It is frequently mentioned in connection with memorable incidents in the life of our Lord (<A HREF="../kjv/mat021.htm#017">Mat 21:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat026.htm#006">Mat 26:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar011.htm#011">Mar 11:11</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mar011.htm#012">Mar 11:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar014.htm#003">Mar 14:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk024.htm#050">Luk 24:50</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joh011.htm#001">Joh 11:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joh012.htm#001">Joh 12:1</A>). It is now known by the name of el-Azariyeh, i.e., &quot;place of Lazarus,&quot; or simply Lazariyeh. Seen from a distance, the village has been described as &quot;remarkably beautiful, the perfection of retirement and repose, of seclusion and lovely peace.&quot; Now a mean village, containing about twenty families. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Beth-arabah</B></A>     House of the desert, one of the six cities of Judah, situated in the sunk valley of the Jordan and Dead Sea (<A HREF="../kjv/jos018.htm#022">Jos 18:22</A>). In <A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#061">Jos 15:61</A> it is said to have been &quot;in the wilderness.&quot; It was afterwards included in the towns of Benjamin. It is called Arabah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos018.htm#018">Jos 18:18</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Beth-aram</B></A>     House of the height; i.e., &quot;mountain-house&quot;, one of the towns of Gad, 3 miles east of Jordan, opposite Jericho (<A HREF="../kjv/jos013.htm#027">Jos 13:27</A>). Probably the same as Beth-haran in <A HREF="../kjv/num032.htm#036">Num 32:36</A>. It was called by king Herod, Julias, or Livias, after Livia, the wife of Augustus. It is now called Beit-haran.
