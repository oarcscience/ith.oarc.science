<span id="000">**Shimshai**</span> The shining one, or sunny, the
secretary of Rehum the chancellor, who took part in opposing the
rebuilding of the temple after the Captivity ([Ezr
4:8](../kjv/ezr004.htm#008), [Ezr 4:9](../kjv/ezr004.htm#009), [Ezr
4:17](../kjv/ezr004.htm#017)).

<span id="001">**Shinab**</span> Cooling, the king of Adamah, in the
valley of Siddim, who with his confederates was conquered by
Chedorlaomer ([Gen 14:2](../kjv/gen014.htm#002)).

<span id="002">**Shinar, The Land of**</span> LXX. and Vulgate "Senaar;"
in the inscriptions, "Shumir;" probably identical with Babylonia or
Southern Mesopotamia, extending almost to the Persian Gulf. Here the
tower of Babel was built ([Gen 11:1](../kjv/gen011.htm#001)), and the
city of Babylon. The name occurs later in Jewish history ([Isa
11:11](../kjv/isa011.htm#011); [Zac 5:11](../kjv/zac005.htm#011)).
Shinar was apparently first peopled by Turanian tribes, who tilled the
land and made bricks and built cities. Then tribes of Semites invaded
the land and settled in it, and became its rulers. This was followed in
course of time by an Elamite invasion; from which the land was finally
delivered by Khammurabi, the son of Amarpel ("Amraphel, king of Shinar,"
[Gen 14:1](../kjv/gen014.htm#001)), who became the founder of the new
empire of Chaldea. (See AMRAPHEL.)

<span id="003">**Ships**</span> Early used in foreign commerce by the
Phoenicians ([Gen 49:13](../kjv/gen049.htm#013)). Moses ([Deu
28:68](../kjv/deu028.htm#068)) and Job ([Job
9:26](../kjv/job009.htm#026)) make reference to them, and Balaam speaks
of the "ships of Chittim" ([Num 24:24](../kjv/num024.htm#024)). Solomon
constructed a navy at Ezion-geber by the assistance of Hiram's sailors
([Kg1 9:26](../kjv/kg1009.htm#026); [Ch2 8:18](../kjv/ch2008.htm#018)).
Afterwards, Jehoshaphat sought to provide himself with a navy at the
same port, but his ships appear to have been wrecked before they set
sail ([Kg1 22:48](../kjv/kg1022.htm#048), [Kg1
22:49](../kjv/kg1022.htm#049); [Ch2 20:35](../kjv/ch2020.htm#035)). In
our Lord's time fishermen's boats on the Sea of Galilee were called
"ships." Much may be learned regarding the construction of ancient
merchant ships and navigation from the record in Acts 27, 28.

<span id="004">**Shiphmite**</span> Probably the designation of Zabdi,
who has charge of David's vineyards ([Ch1
27:27](../kjv/ch1027.htm#027)).

<span id="005">**Shiphrah**</span> Beauty, one of the Egyptian midwives
([Exo 1:15](../kjv/exo001.htm#015)).

<span id="006">**Shiphtan**</span> Judicial, an Ephraimite prince at the
time of the division of Canaan ([Num 34:24](../kjv/num034.htm#024)).

<span id="007">**Shishak I**</span> Sheshonk I., king of Egypt. His
reign was one of great national success, and a record of his wars and
conquests adorns the portico of what are called the "Bubastite kings" at
Karnak, the ancient Thebes. Among these conquests is a record of that of
Judea. In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign Shishak came up against the
kingdom of Judah with a powerful army. He took the fenced cities and
came to Jerusalem. He pillaged the treasures of the temple and of the
royal palace, and carried away the shields of gold which Solomon had
made ([Kg1 11:40](../kjv/kg1011.htm#040); [Kg1
14:25](../kjv/kg1014.htm#025); [Ch2 12:2](../kjv/ch2012.htm#002)). (See
REHOBOAM.) This expedition of the Egyptian king was undertaken at the
instigation of Jeroboam for the purpose of humbling Judah. Hostilities
between the two kingdoms still continued; but during Rehoboam's reign
there was not again the intervention of a third party.

<span id="008">**Shittah-tree**</span> ([Isa
41:19](../kjv/isa041.htm#019); R.V., "acacia tree"). Shittah wood was
employed in making the various parts of the tabernacle in the
wilderness, and must therefore have been indigenous in the desert in
which the Israelites wandered. It was the acacia or mimosa (Acacia
Nilotica and A. seyal). "The wild acacia (Mimosa Nilotica), under the
name of sunt, everywhere represents the seneh, or senna, of the burning
bush. A slightly different form of the tree, equally common under the
name of seyal, is the ancient 'shittah,' or, as more usually expressed
in the plural form, the 'shittim,' of which the tabernacle was made."
Stanley's Sinai, etc. ([Exo 25:10](../kjv/exo025.htm#010), [Exo
25:13](../kjv/exo025.htm#013), [Exo 25:23](../kjv/exo025.htm#023), [Exo
25:28](../kjv/exo025.htm#028)).

<span id="009">**Shittim**</span> Acacias, also called "Abel-shittim"
([Num 33:49](../kjv/num033.htm#049)), a plain or valley in the land of
Moab where the Israelites were encamped after their two victories over
Sihon and Og, at the close of their desert wanderings, and from which
Joshua sent forth two spies (q.v.) "secretly" to "view" the land and
Jericho ([Jos 2:1](../kjv/jos002.htm#001)).
