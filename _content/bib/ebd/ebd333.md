------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Shebuel**</span> Captive of God. (1.) One of the
descendants of Gershom, who had charge of the temple treasures in the
time of David ([Ch1 23:16](../kjv/ch1023.htm#016); [Ch1
26:24](../kjv/ch1026.htm#024)). (2.) One of the sons of Heman; one of
those whose duty it was to "lift up the horn" in the temple service
([Ch1 25:4](../kjv/ch1025.htm#004), [Ch1 25:5](../kjv/ch1025.htm#005));
called also Shubael ([Ch1 25:20](../kjv/ch1025.htm#020)).

<span id="001">**Shecaniah**</span> One intimate with Jehovah. (1.) A
priest to whom the tenth lot came forth when David divided the priests
([Ch1 24:11](../kjv/ch1024.htm#011)). (2.) One of the priests who were
set "to give to their brethren by courses" of the daily portion ([Ch2
31:15](../kjv/ch2031.htm#015)).

<span id="002">**Shechaniah**</span> Id. (1.) A priest whose sons are
mentioned in [Ch1 3:21](../kjv/ch1003.htm#021), [Ch1
3:22](../kjv/ch1003.htm#022). (2.) [Ezr 8:5](../kjv/ezr008.htm#005).
(3.) [Ezr 10:2](../kjv/ezr010.htm#002). (4.) The father of Shemaiah, who
repaired the wall of Jerusalem ([Neh 3:29](../kjv/neh003.htm#029)). (5.)
The father-in-law of Tobiah ([Neh 6:18](../kjv/neh006.htm#018)). (6.) A
priest who returned from the Captivity with Zerubbabel ([Neh
12:3](../kjv/neh012.htm#003); marg., or Shebaniah).

<span id="003">**Shechem**</span> Shoulder. (1.) The son of Hamor the
Hivite ([Gen 33:19](../kjv/gen033.htm#019); 34). (2.) A descendant of
Manasseh ([Num 26:31](../kjv/num026.htm#031); [Jos
17:2](../kjv/jos017.htm#002)). (3.) A city in Samaria ([Gen
33:18](../kjv/gen033.htm#018)), called also Sichem ([Gen
12:6](../kjv/gen012.htm#006)), Sychem ([Act
7:16](../kjv/act007.htm#016)). It stood in the narrow sheltered valley
between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south, these mountains at
their base being only some 500 yards apart. Here Abraham pitched his
tent and built his first altar in the Promised Land, and received the
first divine promise ([Gen 12:6](../kjv/gen012.htm#006), [Gen
12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007)). Here also Jacob "bought a parcel of a
field at the hands of the children of Hamor" after his return from
Mesopotamia, and settled with his household, which he purged from
idolatry by burying the teraphim of his followers under an oak tree,
which was afterwards called "the oak of the sorcerer" ([Gen
33:19](../kjv/gen033.htm#019); [Gen 35:4](../kjv/gen035.htm#004); [Jdg
9:37](../kjv/jdg009.htm#037)). (See MEONENIM.) Here too, after a while,
he dug a well, which bears his name to this day ([Joh
4:5](../kjv/joh004.htm#005), [Joh 4:39](../kjv/joh004.htm#039)). To
Shechem Joshua gathered all Israel "before God," and delivered to them
his second parting address ([Jos 24:1](../kjv/jos024.htm#001)). He "made
a covenant with the people that day" at the very place where, on first
entering the land, they had responded to the law from Ebal and Gerizim
([Jos 24:25](../kjv/jos024.htm#025)), the terms of which were recorded
"in the book of the law of God", i.e., in the roll of the law of Moses;
and in memory of this solemn transaction a great stone was set up "under
an oak" (compare [Gen 28:18](../kjv/gen028.htm#018); [Gen
31:44](../kjv/gen031.htm#044); [Exo 24:4](../kjv/exo024.htm#004); [Jos
4:3](../kjv/jos004.htm#003), [Jos 4:8](../kjv/jos004.htm#008), [Jos
4:9](../kjv/jos004.htm#009)), possibly the old "oak of Moreh," as a
silent witness of the transaction to all coming time. Shechem became one
of the cities of refuge, the central city of refuge for Western
Palestine ([Jos 20:7](../kjv/jos020.htm#007)), and here the bones of
Joseph were buried ([Jos 24:32](../kjv/jos024.htm#032)). Rehoboam was
appointed king in Shechem ([Kg1 12:1](../kjv/kg1012.htm#001), [Kg1
12:19](../kjv/kg1012.htm#019)), but Jeroboam afterwards took up his
residence here. This city is mentioned in connection with our Lord's
conversation with the woman of Samaria ([Joh
4:5](../kjv/joh004.htm#005)); and thus, remaining as it does to the
present day, it is one of the oldest cities of the world. It is the
modern Nablus, a contraction for Neapolis, the name given to it by
Vespasian. It lies about a mile and a half up the valley on its southern
slope, and on the north of Gerizim, which rises about 1,100 feet above
it, and is about 34 miles north of Jerusalem. It contains about 10,000
inhabitants, of whom about 160 are Samaritans and 100 Jews, the rest
being Christians and Mohammedans. The site of Shechem is said to be of
unrivaled beauty. Stanley says it is "the most beautiful, perhaps the
only very beautiful, spot in Central Palestine." Gaza, near Shechem,
only mentioned [Ch1 7:28](../kjv/ch1007.htm#028), has entirely
disappeared. It was destroyed at the time of the Conquest, and its place
was taken by Shechem. (See SYCHAR.)

<span id="004">**Shechinah**</span> A Chaldee word meaning
resting-place, not found in Scripture, but used by the later Jews to
designate the visible symbol of God's presence in the tabernacle, and
afterwards in Solomon's temple. When the Lord led Israel out of Egypt,
he went before them "in a pillar of a cloud." This was the symbol of his
presence with his people. For references made to it during the
wilderness wanderings, see [Exo 14:20](../kjv/exo014.htm#020); [Exo
40:34](../kjv/exo040.htm#034); [Lev 9:23](../kjv/lev009.htm#023), [Lev
9:24](../kjv/lev009.htm#024); [Num 14:10](../kjv/num014.htm#010); [Num
16:19](../kjv/num016.htm#019), [Num 16:42](../kjv/num016.htm#042). It is
probable that after the entrance into Canaan this glory-cloud settled in
the tabernacle upon the ark of the covenant in the most holy place. We
have, however, no special reference to it till the consecration of the
temple by Solomon, when it filled the whole house with its glory, so
that the priests could not stand to minister ([Kg1
8:10](../kjv/kg1008.htm#010); [Ch2 5:13](../kjv/ch2005.htm#013), [Ch2
5:14](../kjv/ch2005.htm#014); [Ch2 7:1](../kjv/ch2007.htm#001)).
Probably it remained in the first temple in the holy of holies as the
symbol of Jehovah's presence so long as that temple stood. It afterwards
disappeared. (See CLOUD.)

<span id="005">**Sheep**</span> Are of different varieties. Probably the
flocks of Abraham and Isaac were of the wild species found still in the
mountain regions of Persia and Kurdistan. After the Exodus, and as a
result of intercourse with surrounding nations, other species were no
doubt introduced into the herds of the people of Israel. They are
frequently mentioned in Scripture. The care of a shepherd over his flock
is referred to as illustrating God's care over his people ([Psa
23:1](../kjv/psa023.htm#001), [Psa 23:2](../kjv/psa023.htm#002); [Psa
74:1](../kjv/psa074.htm#001); [Psa 77:20](../kjv/psa077.htm#020); [Isa
40:11](../kjv/isa040.htm#011); [Isa 53:6](../kjv/isa053.htm#006); [Joh
10:1](../kjv/joh010.htm#001), [Joh 10:7](../kjv/joh010.htm#007)). "The
sheep of Palestine are longer in the head than ours, and have tails from
5 inches broad at the narrowest part to 15 inches at the widest, the
weight being in proportion, and ranging generally from 10 to 14 lb., but
sometimes extending to 30 lb. The tails are indeed huge masses of fat"
(Geikie's Holy Land, etc.). The tail was no doubt the "rump" so
frequently referred to in the Levitical sacrifices ([Exo
29:22](../kjv/exo029.htm#022); [Lev 3:9](../kjv/lev003.htm#009); [Lev
7:3](../kjv/lev007.htm#003); [Lev 9:19](../kjv/lev009.htm#019)).
Sheep-shearing was generally an occasion of great festivity ([Gen
31:19](../kjv/gen031.htm#019); [Gen 38:12](../kjv/gen038.htm#012), [Gen
38:13](../kjv/gen038.htm#013); [Sa1 25:4](../kjv/sa1025.htm#004), [Sa1
25:36](../kjv/sa1025.htm#036); [Sa2 13:23](../kjv/sa2013.htm#023)).

<span id="006">**Sheep-fold**</span> A strong fenced enclosure for the
protection of the sheep gathered within it ([Num
32:24](../kjv/num032.htm#024); [Ch1 17:7](../kjv/ch1017.htm#007); [Psa
50:9](../kjv/psa050.htm#009); [Psa 78:70](../kjv/psa078.htm#070)). In
[Joh 10:16](../kjv/joh010.htm#016) the Authorized Version renders by
"fold" two distinct Greek words, aule and poimne , the latter of which
properly means a "flock," and is so rendered in the Revised Version.
(See also [Mat 26:31](../kjv/mat026.htm#031); [Luk
2:8](../kjv/luk002.htm#008); [Co1 9:7](../kjv/co1009.htm#007).) (See
FOLD.)

<span id="007">**Sheep-gate**</span> One of the gates of Jerusalem
mentioned by Nehemiah ([Neh 3:1](../kjv/neh003.htm#001), [Neh
3:32](../kjv/neh003.htm#032); [Neh 12:39](../kjv/neh012.htm#039)). It
was in the eastern wall of the city.

<span id="008">**Sheep-market**</span> Occurs only in [Joh
5:2](../kjv/joh005.htm#002) (marg., also R.V., "sheep-gate"). The word
so rendered is an adjective, and it is uncertain whether the noun to be
supplied should be "gate" or, following the Vulgate Version, "pool."

<span id="009">**Shekel**</span> Weight, the common standard both of
weight and value among the Hebrews. It is estimated at 220 English
grains, or a little more than half an ounce avoirdupois. The "shekel of
the sanctuary" ([Exo 30:13](../kjv/exo030.htm#013); [Num
3:47](../kjv/num003.htm#047)) was equal to twenty gerahs ([Eze
45:12](../kjv/eze045.htm#012)). There were shekels of gold ([Ch1
21:25](../kjv/ch1021.htm#025)), of silver ([Sa1
9:8](../kjv/sa1009.htm#008)), of brass ([Sa1
17:5](../kjv/sa1017.htm#005)), and of iron ([Sa1
17:7](../kjv/sa1017.htm#007)). When it became a coined piece of money,
the shekel of gold was equivalent to about 2 pound of our money. Six
gold shekels, according to the later Jewish system, were equal in value
to fifty silver ones. The temple contribution, with which the public
sacrifices were bought ([Exo 30:13](../kjv/exo030.htm#013); [Ch2
24:6](../kjv/ch2024.htm#006)), consisted of one common shekel, or a
sanctuary half-shekel, equal to two Attic drachmas. The coin, a stater
(q.v.), which Peter found in the fish's mouth paid this contribution for
both him and Christ ([Mat 17:24](../kjv/mat017.htm#024), [Mat
17:27](../kjv/mat017.htm#027)). A zuza, or quarter of a shekel, was
given by Saul to Samuel ([Sa1 9:8](../kjv/sa1009.htm#008)).
