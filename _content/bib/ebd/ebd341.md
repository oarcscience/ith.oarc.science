<span id="000">**Shomer**</span> Watchman. (1.) The mother of Jehozabad,
who murdered Joash ([Kg2 12:21](../kjv/kg2012.htm#021)); called also
Shimrith, a Moabitess ([Ch2 24:26](../kjv/ch2024.htm#026)). (2.) A man
of Asher ([Ch1 7:32](../kjv/ch1007.htm#032)); called also Shamer ([Ch1
7:34](../kjv/ch1007.htm#034)).

<span id="001">**Shophan**</span> Hidden, or hollow, a town east of
Jordan ([Num 32:35](../kjv/num032.htm#035)), built by the children of
Gad. This word should probably be joined with the word preceding it in
this passage, Atroth-Shophan, as in the Revised Version.

<span id="002">**Shoshannim**</span> Lilies, the name of some musical
instrument, probably like a lily in shape (Ps. 45; 69, title). Some
think that an instrument of six strings is meant.

<span id="003">**Shoshannim-Eduth**</span> In title of Ps. 80 (R.V.
marg., "lilies, a testimony"), probably the name of the melody to which
the psalm was to be sung.

<span id="004">**Shrines, Silver**</span> Little models and medallions
of the temple and image of Diana of Ephesus ([Act
19:24](../kjv/act019.htm#024)). The manufacture of these was a very
large and profitable business.

<span id="005">**Shua**</span> Wealth. (1.) A Canaanite whose daughter
was married to Judah ([Ch1 2:3](../kjv/ch1002.htm#003)). (2.) A daughter
of Heber the Asherite ([Ch1 7:32](../kjv/ch1007.htm#032)).

<span id="006">**Shuah**</span> Prostration; a pit. (1.) One of
Abraham's sons by Keturah ([Gen 25:2](../kjv/gen025.htm#002); [Ch1
1:32](../kjv/ch1001.htm#032)). (2.) [Ch1 4:11](../kjv/ch1004.htm#011).

<span id="007">**Shual, The Land of**</span> Land of the fox, a district
in the tribe of Benjamin ([Sa1 13:17](../kjv/sa1013.htm#017)); possibly
the same as Shalim ([Sa1 9:4](../kjv/sa1009.htm#004)), in the
neighbourhood of Shaalabbin ([Jos 19:42](../kjv/jos019.htm#042)).

<span id="008">**Shuhite**</span> A designation of Bildad ([Job
2:11](../kjv/job002.htm#011)), probably because he was a descendant of
Shuah.

<span id="009">**Shulamite**</span> The same, as some think, with
"Shunammite," from "Shunem:" otherwise, the import of the word is
uncertain ([Sol 6:13](../kjv/sol006.htm#013); R.V., "Shulammite").
