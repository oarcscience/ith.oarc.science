<span id="000">**Bracelet**</span> (1.) Anklets ([Num
31:50](../kjv/num031.htm#050); [Sa2 1:10](../kjv/sa2001.htm#010)), and
with reference to men. (2.) The rendering of a Hebrew word meaning
fasteners, found in [Gen 24:22](../kjv/gen024.htm#022), [Gen
24:30](../kjv/gen024.htm#030), [Gen 24:47](../kjv/gen024.htm#047). (3.)
In [Isa 3:19](../kjv/isa003.htm#019), the rendering of a Hebrew word
meaning chains, i.e., twisted or chain-like bracelets. (4.) In [Exo
35:22](../kjv/exo035.htm#022) it designates properly a clasp for
fastening the dress of females. Some interpret it as a nose-ring. (5.)
In [Gen 38:18](../kjv/gen038.htm#018), [Gen
38:25](../kjv/gen038.htm#025), the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning
"thread," and may denote the ornamental cord with which the signet was
suspended from the neck of the wearer. Bracelets were worn by men as
well as by women ([Sol 5:14](../kjv/sol005.htm#014), R.V.). They were of
many various forms. The weight of those presented by Eliezer to Rebekah
was ten shekels ([Gen 24:22](../kjv/gen024.htm#022)).

<span id="001">**Bramble**</span> (1.) Hebrew atad, [Jdg
9:14](../kjv/jdg009.htm#014); rendered "thorn," [Psa
58:9](../kjv/psa058.htm#009). The LXX. and Vulgate render by rhamnus, a
thorny shrub common in Palestine, resembling the hawthorn. (2.) Hebrew
hoah, [Isa 34:13](../kjv/isa034.htm#013) (R.V. "thistles"); "thickets"
in [Sa1 13:6](../kjv/sa1013.htm#006); "thistles" in [Kg2
14:9](../kjv/kg2014.htm#009), [Ch2 25:18](../kjv/ch2025.htm#018), [Job
31:40](../kjv/job031.htm#040); "thorns" in [Ch2
33:11](../kjv/ch2033.htm#011), [Sol 2:2](../kjv/sol002.htm#002), [Hos
9:6](../kjv/hos009.htm#006). The word may be regarded as denoting the
common thistle, of which there are many species which encumber the
cornfields of Oalestine. (See THORNS.)

<span id="002">**Branch**</span> A symbol of kings descended from royal
ancestors ([Eze 17:3](../kjv/eze017.htm#003), [Eze
17:10](../kjv/eze017.htm#010); [Dan 11:7](../kjv/dan011.htm#007)); of
prosperity ([Job 8:16](../kjv/job008.htm#016)); of the Messiah, a branch
out of the root of the stem of Jesse ([Isa
11:1](../kjv/isa011.htm#001)), the "beautiful branch" ([Isa
4:2](../kjv/isa004.htm#002)), a "righteous branch" ([Jer
23:5](../kjv/jer023.htm#005)), "the Branch" ([Zac
3:8](../kjv/zac003.htm#008); [Zac 6:12](../kjv/zac006.htm#012)).
Disciples are branches of the true vine ([Joh
15:5](../kjv/joh015.htm#005), [Joh 15:6](../kjv/joh015.htm#006)). "The
branch of the terrible ones" ([Isa 25:5](../kjv/isa025.htm#005)) is
rightly translated in the Revised Version "the song of the terrible
ones," i.e., the song of victory shall be brought low by the destruction
of Babylon and the return of the Jews from captivity. The "abominable
branch" is a tree on which a malefactor has been hanged ([Isa
14:19](../kjv/isa014.htm#019)). The "highest branch" in [Eze
17:3](../kjv/eze017.htm#003) represents Jehoiakim the king.

<span id="003">**Brass**</span> Which is an alloy of copper and zinc,
was not known till the thirteenth century. What is designated by this
word in Scripture is properly copper ([Deu 8:9](../kjv/deu008.htm#009)).
It was used for fetters ([Jdg 16:21](../kjv/jdg016.htm#021); [Kg2
25:7](../kjv/kg2025.htm#007)), for pieces of armour ([Sa1
17:5](../kjv/sa1017.htm#005), [Sa1 17:6](../kjv/sa1017.htm#006)), for
musical instruments ([Ch1 15:19](../kjv/ch1015.htm#019); [Co1
13:1](../kjv/co1013.htm#001)), and for money ([Mat
10:9](../kjv/mat010.htm#009)). It is a symbol of insensibility and
obstinacy in sin ([Isa 48:4](../kjv/isa048.htm#004); [Jer
6:28](../kjv/jer006.htm#028); [Eze 22:18](../kjv/eze022.htm#018)), and
of strength ([Psa 107:16](../kjv/psa107.htm#016); [Mic
4:13](../kjv/mic004.htm#013)). The Macedonian empire is described as a
kingdom of brass ([Dan 2:39](../kjv/dan002.htm#039)). The "mountains of
brass" Zechariah ([Zac 6:1](../kjv/zac006.htm#001)) speaks of have been
supposed to represent the immutable decrees of God. The serpent of brass
was made by Moses at the command of God ([Num
21:4](../kjv/num021.htm#004)), and elevated on a pole, so that it might
be seen by all the people when wounded by the bite of the serpents that
were sent to them as a punishment for their murmurings against God and
against Moses. It was afterwards carried by the Jews into Canaan, and
preserved by them till the time of Hezekiah, who caused it to be at
length destroyed because it began to be viewed by the people with
superstitious reverence ([Kg2 18:4](../kjv/kg2018.htm#004)). (See
NEHUSHTAN.) The brazen serpent is alluded to by our Lord in [Joh
3:14](../kjv/joh003.htm#014), [Joh 3:15](../kjv/joh003.htm#015). (See
SERPENT.)

<span id="004">**Bravery**</span> ([Isa 3:18](../kjv/isa003.htm#018)),
an old English word meaning comeliness or beauty.

<span id="005">**Breach**</span> An opening in a wall ([Kg1
11:27](../kjv/kg1011.htm#027); [Kg2 12:5](../kjv/kg2012.htm#005)); the
fracture of a limb ([Lev 24:20](../kjv/lev024.htm#020)), and hence the
expression, "Heal, etc." ([Psa 60:2](../kjv/psa060.htm#002)). [Jdg
5:17](../kjv/jdg005.htm#017), a bay or harbour; R.V., "by his creeks."

<span id="006">**Bread**</span> Among the Jews was generally made of
wheat ([Exo 29:2](../kjv/exo029.htm#002); [Jdg
6:19](../kjv/jdg006.htm#019)), though also sometimes of other grains
([Gen 14:18](../kjv/gen014.htm#018); [Jdg 7:13](../kjv/jdg007.htm#013)).
Parched grain was sometimes used for food without any other preparation
([Rut 2:14](../kjv/rut002.htm#014)). Bread was prepared by kneading in
wooden bowls or "kneading troughs" ([Gen 18:6](../kjv/gen018.htm#006);
[Exo 12:34](../kjv/exo012.htm#034); [Jer 7:18](../kjv/jer007.htm#018)).
The dough was mixed with leaven and made into thin cakes, round or oval,
and then baked. The bread eaten at the Passover was always unleavened
([Exo 12:15](../kjv/exo012.htm#015); [Deu 16:3](../kjv/deu016.htm#003)).
In the towns there were public ovens, which were much made use of for
baking bread; there were also bakers by trade ([Hos
7:4](../kjv/hos007.htm#004); [Jer 37:21](../kjv/jer037.htm#021)). Their
ovens were not unlike those of modern times. But sometimes the bread was
baked by being placed on the ground that had been heated by a fire, and
by covering it with the embers ([Kg1 19:6](../kjv/kg1019.htm#006)). This
was probably the mode in which Sarah prepared bread on the occasion
referred to in [Gen 18:6](../kjv/gen018.htm#006). In Lev. 2 there is an
account of the different kinds of bread and cakes used by the Jews. (See
BAKE.) The shew-bread (q.v.) consisted of twelve loaves of unleavened
bread prepared and presented hot on the golden table every Sabbath. They
were square or oblong, and represented the twelve tribes of Israel. The
old loaves were removed every Sabbath, and were to be eaten only by the
priests in the court of the sanctuary ([Exo
25:30](../kjv/exo025.htm#030); [Lev 24:8](../kjv/lev024.htm#008); [Sa1
21:1](../kjv/sa1021.htm#001); [Mat 12:4](../kjv/mat012.htm#004)). The
word bread is used figuratively in such expressions as "bread of
sorrows" ([Psa 127:2](../kjv/psa127.htm#002)), "bread of tears" ([Psa
80:5](../kjv/psa080.htm#005)), i.e., sorrow and tears are like one's
daily bread, they form so great a part in life. The bread of
"wickedness" ([Pro 4:17](../kjv/pro004.htm#017)) and "of deceit" ([Pro
20:17](../kjv/pro020.htm#017)) denote in like manner that wickedness and
deceit are a part of the daily life.

<span id="007">**Breastplate**</span> (1.) That piece of ancient armour
that protected the breast. This word is used figuratively in [Eph
6:14](../kjv/eph006.htm#014) and [Isa 59:17](../kjv/isa059.htm#017).
(See ARMOUR.) (2.) An ornament covering the breast of the high priest,
first mentioned in [Exo 25:7](../kjv/exo025.htm#007). It was made of
embroidered cloth, set with four rows of precious stones, three in each
row. On each stone was engraved the name of one of the twelve tribes
([Exo 28:15](../kjv/exo028.htm#015); [Exo 39:8](../kjv/exo039.htm#008)).
It was in size about ten inches square. The two upper corners were
fastened to the ephod by blue ribbons. It was not to be "loosed from the
ephod" ([Exo 28:28](../kjv/exo028.htm#028)). The lower corners were
fastened to the girdle of the priest. As it reminded the priest of his
representative character, it was called the memorial ([Exo
28:29](../kjv/exo028.htm#029)). It was also called the breastplate of
judgment ([Exo 28:15](../kjv/exo028.htm#015)). (See PRIEST.)

<span id="008">**Breeches**</span> ([Exo 28:42](../kjv/exo028.htm#042)),
rather linen drawers, reaching from the waist to a little above the
knee, worn by the priests ([Eze 44:17](../kjv/eze044.htm#017), [Eze
44:18](../kjv/eze044.htm#018)).

<span id="009">**Bribe**</span> None to be taken; "for the gift maketh
open eyes blind, and perverteth the cause of the righteous" ([Exo
23:8](../kjv/exo023.htm#008), literally rendered).
