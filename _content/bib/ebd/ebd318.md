<span id="000">**Sackbut**</span> (Chald. sabkha; Gr. sambuke ), a
Syrian stringed instrument resembling a harp ([Dan
3:5](../kjv/dan003.htm#005), [Dan 3:7](../kjv/dan003.htm#007), [Dan
3:10](../kjv/dan003.htm#010), [Dan 3:15](../kjv/dan003.htm#015)); not
the modern sackbut, which is a wind instrument.

<span id="001">**Sackcloth**</span> Cloth made of black goats' hair,
coarse, rough, and thick, used for sacks, and also worn by mourners
([Gen 37:34](../kjv/gen037.htm#034); [Gen 42:25](../kjv/gen042.htm#025);
[Sa2 3:31](../kjv/sa2003.htm#031); [Est 4:1](../kjv/est004.htm#001),
[Est 4:2](../kjv/est004.htm#002); [Psa 30:11](../kjv/psa030.htm#011),
etc.), and as a sign of repentance ([Mat 11:21](../kjv/mat011.htm#021)).
It was put upon animals by the people of Nineveh ([Jon
3:8](../kjv/jon003.htm#008)).

<span id="002">**Sacrifice**</span> The offering up of sacrifices is to
be regarded as a divine institution. It did not originate with man. God
himself appointed it as the mode in which acceptable worship was to be
offered to him by guilty man. The language and the idea of sacrifice
pervade the whole Bible. Sacrifices were offered in the ante-diluvian
age. The Lord clothed Adam and Eve with the skins of animals, which in
all probability had been offered in sacrifice ([Gen
3:21](../kjv/gen003.htm#021)). Abel offered a sacrifice "of the
firstlings of his flock" ([Gen 4:4](../kjv/gen004.htm#004); [Heb
11:4](../kjv/heb011.htm#004)). A distinction also was made between clean
and unclean animals, which there is every reason to believe had
reference to the offering up of sacrifices ([Gen
7:2](../kjv/gen007.htm#002), [Gen 7:8](../kjv/gen007.htm#008)), because
animals were not given to man as food till after the Flood. The same
practice is continued down through the patriarchal age ([Gen
8:20](../kjv/gen008.htm#020); [Gen 12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007); [Gen
13:4](../kjv/gen013.htm#004), [Gen 13:18](../kjv/gen013.htm#018); [Gen
15:9](../kjv/gen015.htm#009); 22:1-18, etc.). In the Mosaic period of
Old Testament history definite laws were prescribed by God regarding the
different kinds of sacrifices that were to be offered and the manner in
which the offering was to be made. The offering of stated sacrifices
became indeed a prominent and distinctive feature of the whole period
(Ex. 12:3-27; [Lev 23:5](../kjv/lev023.htm#005); [Num
9:2](../kjv/num009.htm#002)). (See ALTAR.) We learn from the Epistle to
the Hebrews that sacrifices had in themselves no value or efficacy. They
were only the "shadow of good things to come," and pointed the
worshippers forward to the coming of the great High Priest, who, in the
fullness of the time, "was offered once for all to bear the sin of
many." Sacrifices belonged to a temporary economy, to a system of types
and emblems which served their purposes and have now passed away. The
"one sacrifice for sins" hath "perfected for ever them that are
sanctified." Sacrifices were of two kinds:, (1.) Unbloody, such as (a.)
first-fruits and tithes; (b.) meat and drink-offerings; and (c.)
incense. (2.) Bloody, such as (a.) burnt-offerings; (b.)
peace-offerings; and (c.) sin and trespass offerings. (See OFFERINGS.)

<span id="003">**Sadducees**</span> The origin of this Jewish sect
cannot definitely be traced. It was probably the outcome of the
influence of Grecian customs and philosophy during the period of Greek
domination. The first time they are met with is in connection with John
the Baptist's ministry. They came out to him when on the banks of the
Jordan, and he said to them, "O generation of vipers, who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come?" ([Mat 3:7](../kjv/mat003.htm#007).)
The next time they are spoken of they are represented as coming to our
Lord tempting him. He calls them "hypocrites" and "a wicked and
adulterous generation" ([Mat 16:1](../kjv/mat016.htm#001); [Mat
22:23](../kjv/mat022.htm#023)). The only reference to them in the
Gospels of Mark ([Mar 12:18](../kjv/mar012.htm#018)) and Luke ([Luk
20:27](../kjv/luk020.htm#027)) is their attempting to ridicule the
doctrine of the resurrection, which they denied, as they also denied the
existence of angels. They are never mentioned in John's Gospel. There
were many Sadducees among the "elders" of the Sanhedrin. They seem,
indeed, to have been as numerous as the Pharisees ([Act
23:6](../kjv/act023.htm#006)). They showed their hatred of Jesus in
taking part in his condemnation ([Mat 16:21](../kjv/mat016.htm#021);
[Mat 26:1](../kjv/mat026.htm#001), [Mat 26:59](../kjv/mat026.htm#059);
[Mar 8:31](../kjv/mar008.htm#031); [Mar 15:1](../kjv/mar015.htm#001);
[Luk 9:22](../kjv/luk009.htm#022); [Luk 22:66](../kjv/luk022.htm#066)).
They endeavoured to prohibit the apostles from preaching the
resurrection of Christ ([Act 2:24](../kjv/act002.htm#024), [Act
2:31](../kjv/act002.htm#031), [Act 2:32](../kjv/act002.htm#032); [Act
4:1](../kjv/act004.htm#001), [Act 4:2](../kjv/act004.htm#002); [Act
5:17](../kjv/act005.htm#017), [Act 5:24](../kjv/act005.htm#024)). They
were the deists or skeptics of that age. They do not appear as a
separate sect after the destruction of Jerusalem.

<span id="004">**Sadoc**</span> Just, mentioned in the genealogy of our
Lord ([Mat 1:14](../kjv/mat001.htm#014)).

<span id="005">**Saffron**</span> Heb. karkom , Arab. zafran (i.e.,
"yellow"), mentioned only in [Sol 4:13](../kjv/sol004.htm#013), [Sol
4:14](../kjv/sol004.htm#014); the Crocus sativus. Many species of the
crocus are found in Palestine. The pistils and stigmata, from the centre
of its flowers, are pressed into "saffron cakes," common in the East.
"We found," says Tristram, "saffron a very useful condiment in traveling
cookery, a very small pinch of it giving not only a rich yellow colour
but an agreeable flavour to a dish of rice or to an insipid stew."

<span id="006">**Saint**</span> One separated from the world and
consecrated to God; one holy by profession and by covenant; a believer
in Christ ([Psa 16:3](../kjv/psa016.htm#003); [Rom
1:7](../kjv/rom001.htm#007); [Rom 8:27](../kjv/rom008.htm#027); [Phi
1:1](../kjv/phi001.htm#001); [Heb 6:10](../kjv/heb006.htm#010)). The
"saints" spoken of in [Jde 1:14](../kjv/jde001.htm#014) are probably not
the disciples of Christ, but the "innumerable company of angels" ([Heb
12:22](../kjv/heb012.htm#022); [Psa 68:17](../kjv/psa068.htm#017)), with
reference to [Deu 33:2](../kjv/deu033.htm#002). This word is also used
of the holy dead ([Mat 27:52](../kjv/mat027.htm#052); [Rev
18:24](../kjv/rev018.htm#024)). It was not used as a distinctive title
of the apostles and evangelists and of a "spiritual nobility" till the
fourth century. In that sense it is not a scriptural title.

<span id="007">**Sala**</span> A shoot, a descendant of Arphaxed ([Luk
3:35](../kjv/luk003.htm#035), [Luk 3:36](../kjv/luk003.htm#036)); called
also Shelah ([Ch1 1:18](../kjv/ch1001.htm#018), [Ch1
1:24](../kjv/ch1001.htm#024)).

<span id="008">**Salamis**</span> A city on the south-east coast of
Cyprus ([Act 13:5](../kjv/act013.htm#005)), where Saul and Barnabas, on
their first missionary journey, preached the word in one of the Jewish
synagogues, of which there seem to have been several in that place. It
is now called Famagusta.

<span id="009">**Salathiel**</span> Whom I asked of God, the son of
Jeconiah ([Mat 1:12](../kjv/mat001.htm#012); [Ch1
3:17](../kjv/ch1003.htm#017)); also called the son of Neri ([Luk
3:27](../kjv/luk003.htm#027)). The probable explanation of the apparent
discrepancy is that he was the son of Neri, the descendant of Nathan,
and thus heir to the throne of David on the death of Jeconiah (compare
[Jer 22:30](../kjv/jer022.htm#030)).
