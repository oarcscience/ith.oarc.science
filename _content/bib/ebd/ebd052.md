<span id="000">**Belly**</span> The seat of the carnal affections ([Tit
1:12](../kjv/tit001.htm#012); [Phi 3:19](../kjv/phi003.htm#019); [Rom
16:18](../kjv/rom016.htm#018)). The word is used symbolically for the
heart ([Pro 18:8](../kjv/pro018.htm#008); [Pro
20:27](../kjv/pro020.htm#027); [Pro 22:18](../kjv/pro022.htm#018),
marg.). The "belly of hell" signifies the grave or underworld ([Jon
2:2](../kjv/jon002.htm#002)).

<span id="001">**Belshazzar**</span> Bel protect the king!, the last of
the kings of Babylon ([Dan 5:1](../kjv/dan005.htm#001)). He was the son
of Nabonidus by Nitocris, who was the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar and the
widow of Nergal-sharezer. When still young he made a great feast to a
thousand of his lords, and when heated with wine sent for the sacred
vessels his "father" ([Dan 5:2](../kjv/dan005.htm#002)), or grandfather,
Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple in Jerusalem, and he and
his princes drank out of them. In the midst of their mad revelry a hand
was seen by the king tracing on the wall the announcement of God's
judgment, which that night fell upon him. At the instance of the queen
(i.e., his mother) Daniel was brought in, and he interpreted the
writing. That night the kingdom of the Chaldeans came to an end, and the
king was slain ([Dan 5:30](../kjv/dan005.htm#030)). (See
NERGAL-SHAREZER.) The absence of the name of Belshazzar on the monuments
was long regarded as an argument against the genuineness of the Book of
Daniel. In 1854 Sir Henry Rawlinson found an inscription of Nabonidus
which referred to his eldest son. Quite recently, however, the side of a
ravine undermined by heavy rains fell at Hillah, a suburb of Babylon. A
number of huge, coarse earthenware vases were laid bare. These were
filled with tablets, the receipts and contracts of a firm of Babylonian
bankers, which showed that Belshazzar had a household, with secretaries
and stewards. One was dated in the third year of the king
Marduk-sar-uzur. As Marduk-sar-uzar was another name for Baal, this
Marduk-sar-uzur was found to be the Belshazzar of Scripture. In one of
these contract tablets, dated in the July after the defeat of the army
of Nabonidus, we find him paying tithes for his sister to the temple of
the sun-god at Sippara.

<span id="002">**Belteshazzar**</span> Beltis protect the king!, the
Chaldee name given to Daniel by Nebuchadnezzar ([Dan
1:7](../kjv/dan001.htm#007)).

<span id="003">**Benaiah**</span> Built up by Jehovah. (1.) The son of
Jehoiada, chief priest ([Ch1 27:5](../kjv/ch1027.htm#005)). He was set
by David over his body-guard of Cherethites and Pelethites ([Sa2
8:18](../kjv/sa2008.htm#018); [Kg1 1:32](../kjv/kg1001.htm#032); [Ch1
18:17](../kjv/ch1018.htm#017)). His exploits are enumerated in [Sa2
23:20](../kjv/sa2023.htm#020), [Sa2 23:21](../kjv/sa2023.htm#021), [Sa2
23:22](../kjv/sa2023.htm#022); [Ch1 11:22](../kjv/ch1011.htm#022). He
remained faithful to Solomon ([Kg1 1:8](../kjv/kg1001.htm#008), [Kg1
1:10](../kjv/kg1001.htm#010), [Kg1 1:26](../kjv/kg1001.htm#026)), by
whom he was raised to the rank of commander-in-chief ([Kg1
2:25](../kjv/kg1002.htm#025), [Kg1 2:29](../kjv/kg1002.htm#029), [Kg1
2:30](../kjv/kg1002.htm#030), [Kg1 2:34](../kjv/kg1002.htm#034), [Kg1
2:35](../kjv/kg1002.htm#035); [Kg1 4:4](../kjv/kg1004.htm#004)). (2.)
[Sa2 23:30](../kjv/sa2023.htm#030); [Ch1 11:31](../kjv/ch1011.htm#031).
(3.) A musical Levite ([Ch1 15:18](../kjv/ch1015.htm#018), [Ch1
15:20](../kjv/ch1015.htm#020)). (4.) A priest ([Ch1
15:24](../kjv/ch1015.htm#024); [Ch1 16:6](../kjv/ch1016.htm#006)). (5.)
The son of Jeiel ([Ch2 20:14](../kjv/ch2020.htm#014)).

<span id="004">**Ben-ammi**</span> Son of my kindred; i.e., "born of
incest", the son of Lot by his youngest daughter ([Gen
19:38](../kjv/gen019.htm#038)).

<span id="005">**Bench**</span> Deck of a Tyrian ship, described by
Ezekiel ([Eze 27:6](../kjv/eze027.htm#006)) as overlaid with box-wood.

<span id="006">**Bene-jaakan**</span> Children of Jaakan ([Num
33:31](../kjv/num033.htm#031), [Num 33:32](../kjv/num033.htm#032)), the
same as Beeroth.

<span id="007">**Ben-hadad**</span> The standing title of the Syrian
kings, meaning "the son of Hadad." (See HADADEZER.) (1.) The king of
Syria whom Asa, king of Judah, employed to invade Israel ([Kg1
15:18](../kjv/kg1015.htm#018)). (2.) Son of the preceding, also king of
Syria. He was long engaged in war against Israel. He was murdered
probably by Hazael, by whom he was succeeded ([Kg2
8:7](../kjv/kg2008.htm#007)), after a reign of some thirty years. (3.)
King of Damascus, and successor of his father Hazael on the throne of
Syria ([Kg2 13:3](../kjv/kg2013.htm#003), [Kg2
13:4](../kjv/kg2013.htm#004)). His misfortunes in war are noticed by
Amos ([Amo 1:4](../kjv/amo001.htm#004)).

<span id="008">**Benjamin**</span> son of my right hand. (1.) The
younger son of Jacob by Rachel ([Gen 35:18](../kjv/gen035.htm#018)). His
birth took place at Ephrath, on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem,
at a short distance from the latter place. His mother died in giving him
birth, and with her last breath named him Ben-oni, son of my pain, a
name which was changed by his father into Benjamin. His posterity are
called Benjamites ([Gen 49:27](../kjv/gen049.htm#027); [Deu
33:12](../kjv/deu033.htm#012); [Jos 18:21](../kjv/jos018.htm#021)). (2.)
The tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus was the smallest but one ([Num
1:36](../kjv/num001.htm#036), [Num 1:37](../kjv/num001.htm#037); [Psa
68:27](../kjv/psa068.htm#027)). During the march its place was along
with Manasseh and Ephraim on the west of the tabernacle. At the entrance
into Canaan it counted 45,600 warriors. It has been inferred by some
from the words of Jacob ([Gen 49:27](../kjv/gen049.htm#027)) that the
figure of a wolf was on the tribal standard. This tribe is mentioned in
[Rom 11:1](../kjv/rom011.htm#001); [Phi 3:5](../kjv/phi003.htm#005).
(3.) The inheritance of this tribe lay immediately to the south of that
of Ephraim, and was about 26 miles in length and 12 in breadth. Its
eastern boundary was the Jordan. Dan intervened between it and the
Philistines. Its chief towns are named in [Jos
18:21](../kjv/jos018.htm#021). (4.) The history of the tribe contains a
sad record of a desolating civil war in which they were engaged with the
other eleven tribes. By it they were almost exterminated ([Jdg
20:20](../kjv/jdg020.htm#020), [Jdg 20:21](../kjv/jdg020.htm#021); [Jdg
21:10](../kjv/jdg021.htm#010)). (See GIBEAH.) The first king of the Jews
was Saul, a Benjamite. A close alliance was formed between this tribe
and that of Judah in the time of David ([Sa2
19:16](../kjv/sa2019.htm#016), [Sa2 19:17](../kjv/sa2019.htm#017)),
which continued after his death ([Kg1 11:13](../kjv/kg1011.htm#013);
[Kg1 12:20](../kjv/kg1012.htm#020)). After the Exile these two tribes
formed the great body of the Jewish nation ([Ezr
1:5](../kjv/ezr001.htm#005); [Ezr 10:9](../kjv/ezr010.htm#009)). The
tribe of Benjamin was famous for its archers ([Sa1
20:20](../kjv/sa1020.htm#020), [Sa1 20:36](../kjv/sa1020.htm#036); [Sa2
1:22](../kjv/sa2001.htm#022); [Ch1 8:40](../kjv/ch1008.htm#040); [Ch1
12:2](../kjv/ch1012.htm#002)) and slingers ([Jdg
20:6](../kjv/jdg020.htm#006)). (5.) The gate of Benjamin, on the north
side of Jerusalem ([Jer 37:13](../kjv/jer037.htm#013); [Jer
38:7](../kjv/jer038.htm#007); [Zac 14:10](../kjv/zac014.htm#010)), was
so called because it led in the direction of the territory of the tribe
of Benjamin. It is called by Jeremiah ([Jer
20:2](../kjv/jer020.htm#002)) "the high gate of Benjamin;" also "the
gate of the children of the people" ([Jer
17:19](../kjv/jer017.htm#019)). (Compare [Kg2
14:13](../kjv/kg2014.htm#013).)

<span id="009">**Beor**</span> A torch. (1.) The father of Bela, one of
the kings of Edom ([Gen 36:32](../kjv/gen036.htm#032)). (2.) The father
of Balaam ([Num 22:5](../kjv/num022.htm#005); [Num
24:3](../kjv/num024.htm#003), [Num 24:15](../kjv/num024.htm#015); [Num
31:8](../kjv/num031.htm#008)). In [Pe2 2:15](../kjv/pe2002.htm#015) he
is called Bosor.
