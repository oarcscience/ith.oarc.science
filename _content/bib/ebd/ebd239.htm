<P><A NAME="000"><B>Malcam</B></A>     <A HREF="../kjv/sa2012.htm#030">Sa2 12:30</A>, Heb., R.V., &quot;their king;&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/jer049.htm#001">Jer 49:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jer049.htm#003">Jer 49:3</A>, R.V.; <A HREF="../kjv/zep001.htm#005">Zep 1:5</A>), the national idol of the Ammonites. When Rabbah was taken by David, the crown of this idol was among the spoils. The weight is said to have been &quot;a talent of gold&quot; (above 100 lb.). The expression probably denotes its value rather than its weight. It was adorned with precious stones. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Malchiah</B></A>     Jehovah's king.     (1.) The head of the fifth division of the priests in the time of David (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1024.htm#009">Ch1 24:9</A>). (2.) A priest, the father of Pashur (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1009.htm#012">Ch1 9:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer038.htm#001">Jer 38:1</A>). (3.) One of the priests appointed as musicians to celebrate the completion of the walls of Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/neh012.htm#042">Neh 12:42</A>). (4.) A priest who stood by Ezra when he &quot;read in the book of the law of God&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/neh008.htm#004">Neh 8:4</A>). (5.) <A HREF="../kjv/neh003.htm#011">Neh 3:11</A>. (6.) <A HREF="../kjv/neh003.htm#031">Neh 3:31</A>. (7.) <A HREF="../kjv/neh003.htm#014">Neh 3:14</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Malchi-shua</B></A>     King of help, one of the four sons of Saul (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1008.htm#033">Ch1 8:33</A>). He perished along with his father in the battle of Gilboa (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1031.htm#002">Sa1 31:2</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Malchus</B></A>     Reigning, the personal servant or slave of the high priest Caiaphas. He is mentioned only by John. Peter cut off his right ear in the garden of Gethsemane (<A HREF="../kjv/joh018.htm#010">Joh 18:10</A>). But our Lord cured it with a touch (<A HREF="../kjv/mat026.htm#051">Mat 26:51</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar014.htm#047">Mar 14:47</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk022.htm#051">Luk 22:51</A>). This was the last miracle of bodily cure wrought by our Lord. It is not mentioned by John. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Mallothi</B></A>     My fulness, a Kohathite Levite, one of the sons of Heman the Levite (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1025.htm#004">Ch1 25:4</A>), and chief of the nineteenth division of the temple musicians (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1025.htm#026">Ch1 25:26</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Mallows</B></A>     Occurs only in <A HREF="../kjv/job030.htm#004">Job 30:4</A> (R.V., &quot;saltwort&quot;). The word so rendered (malluah, from melah, &quot;salt&quot;) most probably denotes the Atriplex halimus of Linnaeus, a species of sea purslane found on the shores of the Dead Sea, as also of the Mediterranean, and in salt marshes. It is a tall shrubby orach, growing to the height sometimes of 10 feet. Its buds and leaves, with those of other saline plants, are eaten by the poor in Palestine. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Malluch</B></A>     Reigned over, or reigning.     (1.) A Levite of the family of Merari (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1006.htm#044">Ch1 6:44</A>). (2.) A priest who returned from Babylon (<A HREF="../kjv/neh012.htm#002">Neh 12:2</A>). (3.) <A HREF="../kjv/ezr010.htm#029">Ezr 10:29</A>. (4.) <A HREF="../kjv/ezr010.htm#032">Ezr 10:32</A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Mammon</B></A>     A Chaldee or Syriac word meaning &quot;wealth&quot; or &quot;riches&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/luk016.htm#009">Luk 16:9</A>); also, by personification, the god of riches (<A HREF="../kjv/mat006.htm#024">Mat 6:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk016.htm#009">Luk 16:9</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Mamre</B></A>     Manliness.     (1.) An Amoritish chief in alliance with Abraham (<A HREF="../kjv/gen014.htm#013">Gen 14:13</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen014.htm#024">Gen 14:24</A>). (2.) The name of the place in the neighbourhood of Hebron (q.v.) where Abraham dwelt (<A HREF="../kjv/gen023.htm#017">Gen 23:17</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen023.htm#019">Gen 23:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen035.htm#027">Gen 35:27</A>); called also in Authorized Version (<A HREF="../kjv/gen013.htm#018">Gen 13:18</A>) the &quot;plain of Mamre,&quot; but in Revised Version more correctly &quot;the oaks [marg., 'terebinths'] of Mamre.&quot; The name probably denotes the &quot;oak grove&quot; or the &quot;wood of Mamre,&quot; thus designated after Abraham's ally. This &quot;grove&quot; must have been within sight of or &quot;facing&quot; Machpelah (q.v.). The site of Mamre has been identified with Ballatet Selta, i.e., &quot;the oak of rest&quot;, where there is a tree called &quot;Abraham's oak, about a mile and a half west of Hebron. Others identify it with er-Rameh, 2 miles north of Hebron. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Man</B></A>      (1.) Heb.  'Adam , used as the proper name of the first man. The name is derived from a word meaning &quot;to be red,&quot; and thus the first man was called Adam because he was formed from the red earth. It is also the generic name of the human race (<A HREF="../kjv/gen001.htm#026">Gen 1:26</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen001.htm#027">Gen 1:27</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen005.htm#002">Gen 5:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen008.htm#021">Gen 8:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu008.htm#003">Deu 8:3</A>). Its equivalents are the Latin  homo  and the Greek  anthropos  (<A HREF="../kjv/mat005.htm#013">Mat 5:13</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mat005.htm#016">Mat 5:16</A>). It denotes also man in opposition to woman (<A HREF="../kjv/gen003.htm#012">Gen 3:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat019.htm#010">Mat 19:10</A>). (2.) Heb.  'ish , like the Latin vir and Greek  aner , denotes properly a man in opposition to a woman (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1017.htm#033">Sa1 17:33</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat014.htm#021">Mat 14:21</A>); a husband (<A HREF="../kjv/gen003.htm#016">Gen 3:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/hos002.htm#016">Hos 2:16</A>); man with reference to excellent mental qualities. (3.) Heb.  'enosh , man as mortal, transient, perishable (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2014.htm#011">Ch2 14:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa008.htm#001">Isa 8:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/job015.htm#014">Job 15:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa008.htm#004">Psa 8:4</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa009.htm#019">Psa 9:19</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/psa009.htm#020">Psa 9:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa103.htm#015">Psa 103:15</A>). It is applied to women (<A HREF="../kjv/jos008.htm#025">Jos 8:25</A>). (4.) Heb.  geber , man with reference to his strength, as distinguished from women (<A HREF="../kjv/deu022.htm#005">Deu 22:5</A>) and from children (<A HREF="../kjv/exo012.htm#037">Exo 12:37</A>); a husband (<A HREF="../kjv/pro006.htm#034">Pro 6:34</A>). (5.) Heb.  methim , men as mortal (<A HREF="../kjv/isa041.htm#014">Isa 41:14</A>), and as opposed to women and children (<A HREF="../kjv/deu003.htm#006">Deu 3:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/job011.htm#003">Job 11:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa003.htm#025">Isa 3:25</A>). Man was created by the immediate hand of God, and is generically different from all other creatures (<A HREF="../kjv/gen001.htm#026">Gen 1:26</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen001.htm#027">Gen 1:27</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen002.htm#007">Gen 2:7</A>). His complex nature is composed of two elements, two distinct substances, viz., body and soul (<A HREF="../kjv/gen002.htm#007">Gen 2:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ecc012.htm#007">Ecc 12:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/co2005.htm#001">Co2 5:1</A>). The words translated &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;soul,&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/th1005.htm#023">Th1 5:23</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/heb004.htm#012">Heb 4:12</A>, are habitually used interchangeably (<A HREF="../kjv/mat010.htm#028">Mat 10:28</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat016.htm#026">Mat 16:26</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pe1001.htm#022">Pe1 1:22</A>). The &quot;spirit&quot; (Gr.  pneuma ) is the soul as rational; the &quot;soul&quot; (Gr.  psuche ) is the same, considered as the animating and vital principle of the body. Man was created in the likeness of God as to the perfection of his nature, in knowledge (<A HREF="../kjv/col003.htm#010">Col 3:10</A>), righteousness, and holiness (<A HREF="../kjv/eph004.htm#024">Eph 4:24</A>), and as having dominion over all the inferior creatures (<A HREF="../kjv/gen001.htm#028">Gen 1:28</A>). He had in his original state God's law written on his heart, and had power to obey it, and yet was capable of disobeying, being left to the freedom of his own will. He was created with holy dispositions, prompting him to holy actions; but he was fallible, and did fall from his integrity (<A HREF="../kjv/gen003.htm#001">Gen 3:1</A>). (See FALL.)
