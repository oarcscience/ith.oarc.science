<P><A NAME="000"><B>Kelita</B></A>     Dwarf, a Levite who assisted Ezra in expounding the law to the people (<A HREF="../kjv/neh008.htm#007">Neh 8:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh010.htm#010">Neh 10:10</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Kemuel</B></A>     Helper of God, or assembly of God.     (1.) The third son of Nahor (<A HREF="../kjv/gen022.htm#021">Gen 22:21</A>). (2.) Son of Shiphtan, appointed on behalf of the tribe of Ephraim to partition the land of Canaan (<A HREF="../kjv/num034.htm#024">Num 34:24</A>). (3.) A Levite (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1027.htm#017">Ch1 27:17</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Kenath</B></A>     Possession, a city of Gilead. It was captured by Nobah, who called it by his own name (<A HREF="../kjv/num032.htm#042">Num 32:42</A>). It has been identified with Kunawat, on the slopes of Jebel Hauran (Mount Bashan), 60 miles east from the south end of the Sea of Galilee. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Kenaz</B></A>     Hunter.     (1.) One of the sons of Eliphaz, the son of Esau. He became the chief of an Edomitish tribe (<A HREF="../kjv/gen036.htm#011">Gen 36:11</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen036.htm#015">Gen 36:15</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen036.htm#042">Gen 36:42</A>). (2.) Caleb's younger brother, and father of Othniel (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#017">Jos 15:17</A>), whose family was of importance in Israel down to the time of David (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1027.htm#015">Ch1 27:15</A>). Some think that Othniel (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg001.htm#013">Jdg 1:13</A>), and not Kenaz, was Caleb's brother. (3.) Caleb's grandson (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1004.htm#015">Ch1 4:15</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Kenites</B></A>     Smiths, the name of a tribe inhabiting the desert lying between southern Palestine and the mountains of Sinai. Jethro was of this tribe (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg001.htm#016">Jdg 1:16</A>). He is called a &quot;Midianite&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/num010.htm#029">Num 10:29</A>), and hence it is concluded that the Midianites and the Kenites were the same tribe. They were wandering smiths, &quot;the gypsies and traveling tinkers of the old Oriental world. They formed an important guild in an age when the art of metallurgy was confined to a few&quot; (Sayce's Races, etc.). They showed kindness to Israel in their journey through the wilderness. They accompanied them in their march as far as Jericho (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg001.htm#016">Jdg 1:16</A>), and then returned to their old haunts among the Amalekites, in the desert to the south of Judah. They sustained afterwards friendly relations with the Israelites when settled in Canaan (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg004.htm#011">Jdg 4:11</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jdg004.htm#017">Jdg 4:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1027.htm#010">Sa1 27:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1030.htm#029">Sa1 30:29</A>). The Rechabites belonged to this tribe (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1002.htm#055">Ch1 2:55</A>) and in the days of Jeremiah (<A HREF="../kjv/jer035.htm#007">Jer 35:7</A>) are referred to as following their nomad habits. Saul bade them depart from the Amalekites (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1015.htm#006">Sa1 15:6</A>) when, in obedience to the divine commission, he was about to &quot;smite Amalek.&quot; And his reason is, &quot;for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.&quot; Thus &quot;God is not unrighteous to forget the kindness shown to his people; but they shall be remembered another day, at the farthest in the great day, and recompensed in the resurrection of the just&quot; (M. Henry's Commentary). They are mentioned for the last time in Scripture in <A HREF="../kjv/sa1027.htm#010">Sa1 27:10</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/sa1030.htm#020">Sa1 30:20</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Kenizzite</B></A>      (1.) The name of a tribe referred to in the covenant God made with Abraham (<A HREF="../kjv/gen015.htm#019">Gen 15:19</A>). They are not mentioned among the original inhabitants of Canaan (<A HREF="../kjv/exo003.htm#008">Exo 3:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos003.htm#010">Jos 3:10</A>), and probably they inhabited some part of Arabia, in the confines of Syria. (2.) A designation given to Caleb (R.V., <A HREF="../kjv/num032.htm#012">Num 32:12</A>; A.V., Kenezite). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Kerchief</B></A>     Mentioned only <A HREF="../kjv/eze013.htm#018">Eze 13:18</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/eze013.htm#021">Eze 13:21</A>, as an article of apparel or ornament applied to the head of the idolatrous women of Israel. The precise meaning of the word is uncertain. It appears to have been a long loose shawl, such as Oriental women wrap themselves in (<A HREF="../kjv/rut003.htm#015">Rut 3:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa003.htm#022">Isa 3:22</A>). Some think that it was a long veil or head-dress, denoting by its form the position of those who wore it. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Keren-happuch</B></A>     Horn of the face-paint = cosmetic-box, the name of Job's third daughter (<A HREF="../kjv/job042.htm#014">Job 42:14</A>), born after prosperity had returned to him. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Kerioth</B></A>     Cities.     (1.) A town in the south of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#025">Jos 15:25</A>). Judas the traitor was probably a native of this place, and hence his name Iscariot. It has been identified with the ruins of el-Kureitein, about 10 miles south of Hebron. (See HAZOR [4]). (2.) A city of Moab (<A HREF="../kjv/jer048.htm#024">Jer 48:24</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jer048.htm#041">Jer 48:41</A>), called Kirioth (<A HREF="../kjv/amo002.htm#002">Amo 2:2</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Kesitah</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/gen033.htm#019">Gen 33:19</A>, R.V., marg., a Hebrew word, rendered, A.V., pl. &quot;pieces of money,&quot; marg., &quot;lambs;&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/jos024.htm#032">Jos 24:32</A>, &quot;pieces of silver;&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/job042.htm#011">Job 42:11</A>, &quot;piece of money&quot;). The kesitah was probably a piece of money of a particular weight, cast in the form of a lamb. The monuments of Egypt show that such weights were used. (See PIECES.)
