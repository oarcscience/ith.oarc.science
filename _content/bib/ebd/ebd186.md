------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Ibzan**</span> Illustrious, the tenth judge of Israel
([Jdg 12:8](../kjv/jdg012.htm#008)). He ruled seven years.

<span id="001">**Ice**</span> Frequently mentioned ([Job
6:16](../kjv/job006.htm#016); [Job 38:29](../kjv/job038.htm#029); [Psa
147:17](../kjv/psa147.htm#017), etc.). (See CRYSTAL.)

<span id="002">**Ichabod**</span> When the tidings of the disastrous
defeat of the Israelites in the battle against the Philistines near to
Mizpeh were carried to Shiloh, the wife of Phinehas "was near to be
delivered. And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken,
and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself
and travailed" ([Sa1 4:19](../kjv/sa1004.htm#019)). In her great
distress she regarded not "the women that stood by her," but named the
child that was born "Ichabod" i.e., no glory, saying, "The glory is
departed from Israel;" and with that word on her lips she expired.

<span id="003">**Iconium**</span> The capital of ancient Lycaonia. It
was first visited by Paul and Barnabas from Antioch-in-Pisidia during
the apostle's first missionary journey ([Act
13:50](../kjv/act013.htm#050), [Act 13:51](../kjv/act013.htm#051)). Here
they were persecuted by the Jews, and being driven from the city, they
fled to Lystra. They afterwards returned to Iconium, and encouraged the
church which had been founded there ([Act 14:21](../kjv/act014.htm#021),
[Act 14:22](../kjv/act014.htm#022)). It was probably again visited by
Paul during his third missionary journey along with Silas ([Act
18:23](../kjv/act018.htm#023)). It is the modern Konieh, at the foot of
Mount Taurus, about 120 miles inland from the Mediterranean.

<span id="004">**Idalah**</span> Snares(?), a city near the west border
of Zebulun ([Jos 19:15](../kjv/jos019.htm#015)). It has been identified
with the modern Jeida, in the valley of Kishon.

<span id="005">**Iddo**</span> (1.) Timely ([Ch1
6:21](../kjv/ch1006.htm#021)). A Gershonite Levite. (2.) Lovely. The son
of Zechariah ([Ch1 27:21](../kjv/ch1027.htm#021)), the ruler of Manasseh
in David's time. (3.) Timely. The father of Ahinadab, who was one of
Solomon's purveyors ([Kg1 4:14](../kjv/kg1004.htm#014)). (4.) Lovely. A
prophet of Judah who wrote the history of Rehoboam and Abijah ([Ch2
12:15](../kjv/ch2012.htm#015)). He has been identified with Oded ([Ch2
15:1](../kjv/ch2015.htm#001)). (5.) Lovely. The father of Berachiah, and
grandfather of the prophet Zechariah ([Zac 1:1](../kjv/zac001.htm#001),
[Zac 1:7](../kjv/zac001.htm#007)). He returned from Babylon ([Neh
12:4](../kjv/neh012.htm#004)).

<span id="006">**Idol**</span> (1.) Heb. aven , "nothingness;" "vanity"
([Isa 66:3](../kjv/isa066.htm#003); [Isa 41:29](../kjv/isa041.htm#029);
[Deu 32:21](../kjv/deu032.htm#021); [Kg1 16:13](../kjv/kg1016.htm#013);
[Psa 31:6](../kjv/psa031.htm#006); [Jer 8:19](../kjv/jer008.htm#019),
etc.). (2.) 'Elil , "a thing of naught" ([Psa
97:7](../kjv/psa097.htm#007); [Isa 19:3](../kjv/isa019.htm#003)); a word
of contempt, used of the gods of Noph ([Eze
30:13](../kjv/eze030.htm#013)). (3.) 'Emah , "terror," in allusion to
the hideous form of idols ([Jer 50:38](../kjv/jer050.htm#038)). (4.)
Miphletzeth , "a fright;" "horror" ([Kg1 15:13](../kjv/kg1015.htm#013);

thing" ([Jer 11:13](../kjv/jer011.htm#013); [Hos
9:10](../kjv/hos009.htm#010)); as characterizing the obscenity of the
worship of Baal. (6.) Gillulim , also a word of contempt, "dung;"
"refuse" ([Eze 16:36](../kjv/eze016.htm#036); [Eze
20:8](../kjv/eze020.htm#008); [Deu 29:17](../kjv/deu029.htm#017),
marg.). (7.) Shikkuts , "filth;" "impurity" ([Eze
37:23](../kjv/eze037.htm#023); [Nah 3:6](../kjv/nah003.htm#006)). (8.)
Semel , "likeness;" "a carved image" ([Deu
4:16](../kjv/deu004.htm#016)). (9.) Tselem , "a shadow" ([Dan
3:1](../kjv/dan003.htm#001); [Sa1 6:5](../kjv/sa1006.htm#005)), as
distinguished from the "likeness," or the exact counterpart. (10.)
Temunah , "similitude" ([Deu 4:12](../kjv/deu004.htm#012)). Here Moses
forbids the several forms of Gentile idolatry. (11.) 'Atsab , "a
figure;" from the root "to fashion," "to labour;" denoting that idols
are the result of man's labour ([Isa 48:5](../kjv/isa048.htm#005); [Psa
139:24](../kjv/psa139.htm#024), "wicked way;" literally, as some
translate, "way of an idol"). (12.) Tsir , "a form;" "shape" ([Isa
45:16](../kjv/isa045.htm#016)). (13.) Matztzebah , a "statue" set up
([Jer 43:13](../kjv/jer043.htm#013)); a memorial stone like that erected
by Jacob ([Gen 28:18](../kjv/gen028.htm#018); [Gen
31:45](../kjv/gen031.htm#045); [Gen 35:14](../kjv/gen035.htm#014), [Gen
35:20](../kjv/gen035.htm#020)), by Joshua ([Jos
4:9](../kjv/jos004.htm#009)), and by Samuel ([Sa1
7:12](../kjv/sa1007.htm#012)). It is the name given to the statues of
Baal ([Kg2 3:2](../kjv/kg2003.htm#002); [Kg2
10:27](../kjv/kg2010.htm#027)). (14.) Hammanim , "sun-images." Hamman is
a synonym of Baal, the sun-god of the Phoenicians ([Ch2
34:4](../kjv/ch2034.htm#004), [Ch2 34:7](../kjv/ch2034.htm#007); [Ch2
14:3](../kjv/ch2014.htm#003), [Ch2 14:5](../kjv/ch2014.htm#005); [Isa

26:1](../kjv/lev026.htm#001); [Num 33:52](../kjv/num033.htm#052)). In
[Lev 26:1](../kjv/lev026.htm#001), the words "image of stone" (A.V.)
denote "a stone or cippus with the image of an idol, as Baal, Astarte,
etc." In [Eze 8:12](../kjv/eze008.htm#012), "chambers of imagery"
(maskith), are "chambers of which the walls are painted with the figures
of idols;" compare [Eze 8:10](../kjv/eze008.htm#010), [Eze
8:11](../kjv/eze008.htm#011). (16.) Pesel , "a graven" or "carved image"
([Isa 44:10](../kjv/isa044.htm#010)). It denotes also a figure cast in
metal ([Deu 7:25](../kjv/deu007.htm#025); [Deu
27:15](../kjv/deu027.htm#015); [Isa 40:19](../kjv/isa040.htm#019); [Isa
44:10](../kjv/isa044.htm#010)). (17.) Massekah , "a molten image" ([Deu
9:12](../kjv/deu009.htm#012); [Jdg 17:3](../kjv/jdg017.htm#003), [Jdg
17:4](../kjv/jdg017.htm#004)). (18.) Teraphim , pl., "images," family
gods (penates) worshipped by Abram's kindred ([Jos
24:14](../kjv/jos024.htm#014)). Put by Michal in David's bed ([Jdg
17:5](../kjv/jdg017.htm#005); [Jdg 18:14](../kjv/jdg018.htm#014), [Jdg
18:17](../kjv/jdg018.htm#017), [Jdg 18:18](../kjv/jdg018.htm#018), [Jdg
18:20](../kjv/jdg018.htm#020); [Sa1 19:13](../kjv/sa1019.htm#013)).
"Nothing can be more instructive and significant than this multiplicity
and variety of words designating the instruments and inventions of
idolatry."

<span id="007">**Idolatry**</span> Image-worship or divine honour paid
to any created object. Paul describes the origin of idolatry in [Rom
1:21](../kjv/rom001.htm#021) : men forsook God, and sank into ignorance
and moral corruption ([Rom 1:28](../kjv/rom001.htm#028)). The forms of
idolatry are, (1.) Fetishism, or the worship of trees, rivers, hills,
stones, etc. (2.) Nature worship, the worship of the sun, moon, and
stars, as the supposed powers of nature. (3.) Hero worship, the worship
of deceased ancestors, or of heroes. In Scripture, idolatry is regarded
as of heathen origin, and as being imported among the Hebrews through
contact with heathen nations. The first allusion to idolatry is in the
account of Rachel stealing her father's teraphim ([Gen
31:19](../kjv/gen031.htm#019)), which were the relics of the worship of
other gods by Laban's progenitors "on the other side of the river in old
time" ([Jos 24:2](../kjv/jos024.htm#002)). During their long residence
in Egypt the Hebrews fell into idolatry, and it was long before they
were delivered from it ([Jos 24:14](../kjv/jos024.htm#014); [Eze
20:7](../kjv/eze020.htm#007)). Many a token of God's displeasure fell
upon them because of this sin. The idolatry learned in Egypt was
probably rooted out from among the people during the forty years'
wanderings; but when the Jews entered Palestine, they came into contact
with the monuments and associations of the idolatry of the old
Canaanitish races, and showed a constant tendency to depart from the
living God and follow the idolatrous practices of those heathen nations.
It was their great national sin, which was only effectually rebuked by
the Babylonian exile. That exile finally purified the Jews of all
idolatrous tendencies. The first and second commandments are directed
against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally
amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to
destruction ([Exo 22:20](../kjv/exo022.htm#020)). His nearest relatives
were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment
([Deu 13:2](../kjv/deu013.htm#002)), but their hands were to strike the
first blow when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was
stoned ([Deu 17:2](../kjv/deu017.htm#002)). To attempt to seduce others
to false worship was a crime of equal enormity ([Deu
13:6](../kjv/deu013.htm#006)). An idolatrous nation shared the same
fate. No facts are more strongly declared in the Old Testament than that
the extermination of the Canaanites was the punishment of their idolatry
([Exo 34:15](../kjv/exo034.htm#015), [Exo 34:16](../kjv/exo034.htm#016);
Deut. 7; [Deu 12:29](../kjv/deu012.htm#029); [Deu
20:17](../kjv/deu020.htm#017)), and that the calamities of the
Israelites were due to the same cause ([Jer
2:17](../kjv/jer002.htm#017)). "A city guilty of idolatry was looked
upon as a cancer in the state; it was considered to be in rebellion, and
treated according to the laws of war. Its inhabitants and all their
cattle were put to death." Jehovah was the theocratic King of Israel,
the civil Head of the commonwealth, and therefore to an Israelite
idolatry was a state offense ([Sa1 15:23](../kjv/sa1015.htm#023)), high
treason. On taking possession of the land, the Jews were commanded to
destroy all traces of every kind of the existing idolatry of the
Canaanites ([Exo 23:24](../kjv/exo023.htm#024), [Exo
23:32](../kjv/exo023.htm#032); [Exo 34:13](../kjv/exo034.htm#013); [Deu
7:5](../kjv/deu007.htm#005), [Deu 7:25](../kjv/deu007.htm#025); [Deu
12:1](../kjv/deu012.htm#001)). In the New Testament the term idolatry is
used to designate covetousness ([Mat 6:24](../kjv/mat006.htm#024); [Luk
16:13](../kjv/luk016.htm#013); [Col 3:5](../kjv/col003.htm#005); [Eph
5:5](../kjv/eph005.htm#005)).

<span id="008">**Idumaea**</span> The Greek form of Edom ([Isa
34:5](../kjv/isa034.htm#005), [Isa 34:6](../kjv/isa034.htm#006); [Eze
35:15](../kjv/eze035.htm#015); [Eze 36:5](../kjv/eze036.htm#005), but in
R.V. "Edom"). (See EDOM).

<span id="009">**Igal**</span> Avengers. (1.) [Num
13:7](../kjv/num013.htm#007), one of the spies of the tribe of Issachar.
(2.) Son of Nathan of Zobah, and one of David's warriors ([Sa2
23:36](../kjv/sa2023.htm#036)). (3.) [Ch1 3:22](../kjv/ch1003.htm#022).
