<span id="000">**Blood**</span> (1.) As food, prohibited in [Gen
9:4](../kjv/gen009.htm#004), where the use of animal food is first
allowed. Compare [Deu 12:23](../kjv/deu012.htm#023); [Lev
3:17](../kjv/lev003.htm#017); [Lev 7:26](../kjv/lev007.htm#026); [Lev
17:10](../kjv/lev017.htm#010). The injunction to abstain from blood is
renewed in the decree of the council of Jerusalem ([Act
15:29](../kjv/act015.htm#029)). It has been held by some, and we think
correctly, that this law of prohibition was only ceremonial and
temporary; while others regard it as still binding on all. Blood was
eaten by the Israelites after the battle of Gilboa ([Sa1
14:32](../kjv/sa1014.htm#032)). (2.) The blood of sacrifices was caught
by the priest in a basin, and then sprinkled seven times on the altar;
that of the passover on the door posts and lintels of the houses (Ex.
12; [Lev 4:5](../kjv/lev004.htm#005); [Lev
16:14](../kjv/lev016.htm#014)). At the giving of the law ([Exo
24:8](../kjv/exo024.htm#008)) the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled
on the people as well as on the altar, and thus the people were
consecrated to God, or entered into covenant with him, hence the blood
of the covenant ([Mat 26:28](../kjv/mat026.htm#028); [Heb
9:19](../kjv/heb009.htm#019), [Heb 9:20](../kjv/heb009.htm#020); [Heb
10:29](../kjv/heb010.htm#029); [Heb 13:20](../kjv/heb013.htm#020)). (3.)
Human blood. The murderer was to be punished ([Gen
9:5](../kjv/gen009.htm#005)). The blood of the murdered "crieth for
vengeance" ([Gen 4:10](../kjv/gen004.htm#010)). The "avenger of blood"
was the nearest relative of the murdered, and he was required to avenge
his death ([Num 35:24](../kjv/num035.htm#024), [Num
35:27](../kjv/num035.htm#027)). No satisfaction could be made for the
guilt of murder ([Num 35:31](../kjv/num035.htm#031)). (4.) Blood used
metaphorically to denote race ([Act 17:26](../kjv/act017.htm#026)), and
as a symbol of slaughter ([Isa 34:3](../kjv/isa034.htm#003)). To "wash
the feet in blood" means to gain a great victory ([Psa
58:10](../kjv/psa058.htm#010)). Wine, from its red colour, is called
"the blood of the grape" ([Gen 49:11](../kjv/gen049.htm#011)). Blood and
water issued from our Saviour's side when it was pierced by the Roman
soldier ([Joh 19:34](../kjv/joh019.htm#034)). This has led pathologists
to the conclusion that the proper cause of Christ's death was rupture of
the heart. (Compare [Psa 69:20](../kjv/psa069.htm#020).)

<span id="001">**Bloody Sweat**</span> The sign and token of our Lord's
great agony ([Luk 22:44](../kjv/luk022.htm#044)).

<span id="002">**Blot**</span> A stain or reproach ([Job
31:7](../kjv/job031.htm#007); [Pro 9:7](../kjv/pro009.htm#007)). To blot
out sin is to forgive it ([Psa 51:1](../kjv/psa051.htm#001), [Psa
51:9](../kjv/psa051.htm#009); [Isa 44:22](../kjv/isa044.htm#022); [Act
3:19](../kjv/act003.htm#019)). Christ's blotting out the handwriting of
ordinances was his fulfilling the law in our behalf ([Col
2:14](../kjv/col002.htm#014)).

<span id="003">**Blue**</span> Generally associated with purple ([Exo
25:4](../kjv/exo025.htm#004); [Exo 26:1](../kjv/exo026.htm#001), [Exo
26:31](../kjv/exo026.htm#031), [Exo 26:36](../kjv/exo026.htm#036),
etc.). It is supposed to have been obtained from a shellfish of the
Mediterranean, the Helix ianthina of Linnaeus. The robe of the high
priest's ephod was to be all of this colour ([Exo
28:31](../kjv/exo028.htm#031)), also the loops of the curtains ([Exo
26:4](../kjv/exo026.htm#004)) and the ribbon of the breastplate ([Exo
28:28](../kjv/exo028.htm#028)). Blue cloths were also made for various
sacred purposes ([Num 4:6](../kjv/num004.htm#006), [Num
4:7](../kjv/num004.htm#007), [Num 4:9](../kjv/num004.htm#009), [Num
4:11](../kjv/num004.htm#011), [Num 4:12](../kjv/num004.htm#012)). (See
COLOURS.)

<span id="004">**Boanerges**</span> Sons of thunder, a surname given by
our Lord to James and John ([Mar 3:17](../kjv/mar003.htm#017)) on
account of their fervid and impetuous temper ([Luk
9:54](../kjv/luk009.htm#054)).

<span id="005">**Boar**</span> Occurs only in [Psa
80:13](../kjv/psa080.htm#013). The same Hebrew word is elsewhere
rendered "swine" ([Lev 11:7](../kjv/lev011.htm#007); [Deu
14:8](../kjv/deu014.htm#008); [Pro 11:22](../kjv/pro011.htm#022); [Isa
65:4](../kjv/isa065.htm#004); [Isa 66:3](../kjv/isa066.htm#003), [Isa
66:17](../kjv/isa066.htm#017)). The Hebrews abhorred swine's flesh, and
accordingly none of these animals were reared, except in the district
beyond the Sea of Galilee. In the psalm quoted above the powers that
destroyed the Jewish nation are compared to wild boars and wild beasts
of the field.

<span id="006">**Boaz**</span> Alacrity. (1.) The husband of Ruth, a
wealthy Bethlehemite. By the "levirate law" the duty devolved on him of
marrying Ruth the Moabitess ([Rut 4:1](../kjv/rut004.htm#001)). He was a
kinsman of Mahlon, her first husband. (2.) The name given (for what
reason is unknown) to one of the two (the other was called Jachin)
brazen pillars which Solomon erected in the court of the temple ([Kg1
7:21](../kjv/kg1007.htm#021); [Ch2 3:17](../kjv/ch2003.htm#017)). These
pillars were broken up and carried to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar.

<span id="007">**Bochim**</span> Weepers, a place where the angel of the
Lord reproved the Israelites for entering into a league with the people
of the land. This caused them bitterly to weep, and hence the name of
the place ([Jdg 2:1](../kjv/jdg002.htm#001), [Jdg
2:5](../kjv/jdg002.htm#005)). It lay probably at the head of one of the
valleys between Gilgal and Shiloh.

<span id="008">**Boil**</span> (rendered "botch" in [Deu
28:27](../kjv/deu028.htm#027), [Deu 28:35](../kjv/deu028.htm#035)), an
aggravated ulcer, as in the case of Hezekiah ([Kg2
20:7](../kjv/kg2020.htm#007); [Isa 38:21](../kjv/isa038.htm#021)) or of
the Egyptians ([Exo 9:9](../kjv/exo009.htm#009), [Exo
9:10](../kjv/exo009.htm#010), [Exo 9:11](../kjv/exo009.htm#011); [Deu
28:27](../kjv/deu028.htm#027), [Deu 28:35](../kjv/deu028.htm#035)). It
designates the disease of Job ([Job 2:7](../kjv/job002.htm#007)), which
was probably the black leprosy.

<span id="009">**Bolled**</span> ([Exo 9:31](../kjv/exo009.htm#031)),
meaning "swollen or podded for seed," was adopted in the Authorized
Version from the version of Coverdale (1535). The Revised Version has in
the margin "was in bloom," which is the more probable rendering of the
Hebrew word. It is the fact that in Egypt when barley is in ear (about
February) flax is blossoming.
