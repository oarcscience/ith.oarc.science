<span id="000">**Eleazar**</span> God has helped. (1.) The third son of
Aaron ([Exo 6:23](../kjv/exo006.htm#023)). His wife, a daughter of
Putiel, bore him Phinehas ([Exo 6:25](../kjv/exo006.htm#025)). After the
death of Nadab and Abihu ([Lev 10:12](../kjv/lev010.htm#012); [Num
3:4](../kjv/num003.htm#004)) he was appointed to the charge of the
sanctuary ([Num 3:32](../kjv/num003.htm#032)). On Mount Hor he was
clothed with the sacred vestments, which Moses took from off his brother
Aaron and put upon him as successor to his father in the high priest's
office, which he held for more than twenty years ([Num
20:25](../kjv/num020.htm#025)). He took part with Moses in numbering the
people ([Num 26:3](../kjv/num026.htm#003), [Num
26:4](../kjv/num026.htm#004)), and assisted at the inauguration of
Joshua. He assisted in the distribution of the land after the conquest
([Jos 14:1](../kjv/jos014.htm#001)). The high-priesthood remained in his
family till the time of Eli, into whose family it passed, till it was
restored to the family of Eleazar in the person of Zadok ([Sa1
2:35](../kjv/sa1002.htm#035); compare [Kg1
2:27](../kjv/kg1002.htm#027)). "And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and
they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son" ([Jos
24:33](../kjv/jos024.htm#033)). The word here rendered "hill" is Gibeah,
the name of several towns in Palestine which were generally on or near a
hill. The words may be more suitably rendered, "They buried him in
Gibeah of Phinehas", i.e., in the city of Phinehas, which has been
identified, in accordance with Jewish and Samaritan traditions, with
Kefr Ghuweirah = 'Awertah , about 7 miles north of Shiloh, and a few
miles south-east of Nablus. "His tomb is still shown there, overshadowed
by venerable terebinths." Others, however, have identified it with the
village of Gaba or Gebena of Eusebius, the modern Khurbet Jibia, 5 miles
north of Guphna towards Nablus. (2.) An inhabitant of Kirjath-jearim who
was "sanctified" to take charge of the ark, although not allowed to
touch it, while it remained in the house of his father Abinadab ([Sa1
7:1](../kjv/sa1007.htm#001), [Sa1 7:2](../kjv/sa1007.htm#002); compare
[Num 3:31](../kjv/num003.htm#031); [Num 4:15](../kjv/num004.htm#015)).
(3.) The son of Dodo the Ahohite, of the tribe of Benjamin, one of the
three most eminent of David's thirty-seven heroes ([Ch1
11:12](../kjv/ch1011.htm#012)) who broke through the Philistine host and
brought him water from the well of Bethlehem ([Sa2
23:9](../kjv/sa2023.htm#009), [Sa2 23:16](../kjv/sa2023.htm#016)). (4.)
A son of Phinehas associated with the priests in taking charge of the
sacred vessels brought back to Jerusalem after the Exile ([Ezr
8:33](../kjv/ezr008.htm#033)). (5.) A Levite of the family of Merari
([Ch1 23:21](../kjv/ch1023.htm#021), [Ch1
23:22](../kjv/ch1023.htm#022)).

<span id="001">**Election of Grace**</span> The Scripture speaks (1.) of
the election of individuals to office or to honour and privilege, e.g.,
Abraham, Jacob, Saul, David, Solomon, were all chosen by God for the
positions they held; so also were the apostles. (2.) There is also an
election of nations to special privileges, e.g., the Hebrews ([Deu
7:6](../kjv/deu007.htm#006); [Rom 9:4](../kjv/rom009.htm#004)). (3.) But
in addition there is an election of individuals to eternal life ([Th2
2:13](../kjv/th2002.htm#013); [Eph 1:4](../kjv/eph001.htm#004); [Pe1
1:2](../kjv/pe1001.htm#002); [Joh 13:18](../kjv/joh013.htm#018)). The
ground of this election to salvation is the good pleasure of God ([Eph
1:5](../kjv/eph001.htm#005), [Eph 1:11](../kjv/eph001.htm#011); [Mat
11:25](../kjv/mat011.htm#025), [Mat 11:26](../kjv/mat011.htm#026); [Joh
15:16](../kjv/joh015.htm#016), [Joh 15:19](../kjv/joh015.htm#019)). God
claims the right so to do ([Rom 9:16](../kjv/rom009.htm#016), [Rom
9:21](../kjv/rom009.htm#021)). It is not conditioned on faith or
repentance, but is of sovereign grace ([Rom
11:4](../kjv/rom011.htm#004); [Eph 1:3](../kjv/eph001.htm#003)). All
that pertain to salvation, the means ([Eph 2:8](../kjv/eph002.htm#008);
[Th2 2:13](../kjv/th2002.htm#013)) as well as the end, are of God ([Act
5:31](../kjv/act005.htm#031); [Ti2 2:25](../kjv/ti2002.htm#025); [Co1
1:30](../kjv/co1001.htm#030); [Eph 2:5](../kjv/eph002.htm#005), [Eph
2:10](../kjv/eph002.htm#010)). Faith and repentance and all other graces
are the exercises of a regenerated soul; and regeneration is God's work,
a "new creature." Men are elected "to salvation," "to the adoption of
sons," "to be holy and without blame before him in love" ([Th2
2:13](../kjv/th2002.htm#013); [Gal 4:4](../kjv/gal004.htm#004), [Gal
4:5](../kjv/gal004.htm#005); [Eph 1:4](../kjv/eph001.htm#004)). The
ultimate end of election is the praise of God's grace ([Eph
1:6](../kjv/eph001.htm#006), [Eph 1:12](../kjv/eph001.htm#012)). (See
PREDESTINATION.)

<span id="002">**Elect lady**</span> To whom the Second Epistle of John
is addressed ([Jo2 1:1](../kjv/jo2001.htm#001)). Some think that the
word rendered "lady" is a proper name, and thus that the expression
should be "elect Kyria."

<span id="003">**El-elohe-Isreal**</span> Mighty one; God of Israel, the
name which Jacob gave to the alter which he erected on the piece of land
where he pitched his tent before Shechem, and which he afterwards
purchased from the sons of Hamor ([Gen 33:20](../kjv/gen033.htm#020)).

<span id="004">**Elements**</span> In its primary sense, as denoting the
first principles or constituents of things, it is used in [Pe2
3:10](../kjv/pe2003.htm#010) : "The elements shall be dissolved." In a
secondary sense it denotes the first principles of any art or science.
In this sense it is used in [Gal 4:3](../kjv/gal004.htm#003), [Gal
4:9](../kjv/gal004.htm#009); [Col 2:8](../kjv/col002.htm#008), [Col
2:20](../kjv/col002.htm#020), where the expressions, "elements of the
world," "week and beggarly elements," denote that state of religious
knowledge existing among the Jews before the coming of Christ, the
rudiments of religious teaching. They are "of the world," because they
are made up of types which appeal to the senses. They are "weak,"
because insufficient; and "beggarly," or "poor," because they are dry
and barren, not being accompanied by an outpouring of spiritual gifts
and graces, as the gospel is.

<span id="005">**Elephant**</span> Not found in Scripture except
indirectly in the original Greek word ( elephantinos ) translated "of
ivory" in [Rev 18:12](../kjv/rev018.htm#012), and in the Hebrew word (
shenhabim , meaning "elephant's tooth") rendered "ivory" in [Kg1
10:22](../kjv/kg1010.htm#022) and [Ch2 9:21](../kjv/ch2009.htm#021).

<span id="006">**Elhanan**</span> Whom God has graciously bestowed. (1.)
A warrior of the time of David famed for his exploits. In the Authorized
Version ([Sa2 21:19](../kjv/sa2021.htm#019)) it is recorded that
"Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of
Goliath." The Revised Version here rightly omits the words "the brother
of." They were introduced in the Authorized Version to bring this
passage into agreement with [Ch1 20:5](../kjv/ch1020.htm#005), where it
is said that he "slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath." Goliath the Gittite
was killed by David (1 Sam. 17). The exploit of Elhanan took place late
in David's reign. (2.) The son of Dodo, and one of David's warriors
([Sa2 23:24](../kjv/sa2023.htm#024)).

<span id="007">**Eli**</span> (1.) Ascent - the high priest when the ark
was at Shiloh ([Sa1 1:3](../kjv/sa1001.htm#003), [Sa1
1:9](../kjv/sa1001.htm#009)). He was the first of the line of Ithamar,
Aaron's fourth son ([Ch1 24:3](../kjv/ch1024.htm#003); compare [Sa2
8:17](../kjv/sa2008.htm#017)), who held that office. The office remained
in his family till the time of Abiathar ([Kg1
2:26](../kjv/kg1002.htm#026), [Kg1 2:27](../kjv/kg1002.htm#027)), whom
Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his
stead ([Kg1 2:35](../kjv/kg1002.htm#035)). He acted also as a civil
judge in Israel after the death of Samson ([Sa1
4:18](../kjv/sa1004.htm#018)), and judged Israel for forty years. His
sons Hophni and Phinehas grossly misconducted themselves, to the great
disgust of the people ([Sa1 2:27](../kjv/sa1002.htm#027)). They were
licentious reprobates. He failed to reprove them so sternly as he ought
to have done, and so brought upon his house the judgment of God ([Sa1
2:22](../kjv/sa1002.htm#022); [Sa1 3:18](../kjv/sa1003.htm#018)). The
Israelites proclaimed war against the Philistines, whose army was
encamped at Aphek. The battle, fought a short way beyond Mizpeh, ended
in the total defeat of Israel. Four thousand of them fell in "battle
array". They now sought safety in having the "ark of the covenant of the
Lord" among them. They fetched it from Shiloh, and Hophni and Phinehas
accompanied it. This was the first time since the settlement of Israel
in Canaan that the ark had been removed from the sanctuary. The
Philistines put themselves again in array against Israel, and in the
battle which ensued "Israel was smitten, and there was a very great
slaughter." The tidings of this great disaster were speedily conveyed to
Shiloh, about 20 miles distant, by a messenger, a Benjamite from the
army. There Eli sat outside the gate of the sanctuary by the wayside,
anxiously waiting for tidings from the battle-field. The full extent of
the national calamity was speedily made known to him: "Israel is fled
before the Philistines, there has also been a great slaughter among the
people, thy two sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead, and the ark of God is
taken" ([Sa1 4:12](../kjv/sa1004.htm#012)). When the old man, whose eyes
were "stiffened" (i.e., fixed, as of a blind eye unaffected by the
light) with age, heard this sad story of woe, he fell backward from off
his seat and died, being ninety and eight years old. (See ITHAMAR.) (2.)
Heb. eli , "my God", ([Mat 27:46](../kjv/mat027.htm#046)), an
exclamation used by Christ on the cross. Mark ([Mar
15:34](../kjv/mar015.htm#034)), as usual, gives the original Aramaic
form of the word, Eloi.

<span id="008">**Eliab**</span> To whom God is father. (1.) A Reubenite,
son of Pallu ([Num 16:1](../kjv/num016.htm#001), [Num
16:12](../kjv/num016.htm#012); [Num 26:8](../kjv/num026.htm#008), [Num
26:9](../kjv/num026.htm#009); [Deu 11:6](../kjv/deu011.htm#006)). (2.) A
son of Helon, and chief of the tribe of Zebulun at the time of the
census in the wilderness ([Num 1:9](../kjv/num001.htm#009); [Num
2:7](../kjv/num002.htm#007)). (3.) The son of Jesse, and brother of
David ([Sa1 16:6](../kjv/sa1016.htm#006)). It was he who spoke
contemptuously to David when he proposed to fight Goliath ([Sa1
17:28](../kjv/sa1017.htm#028)). (4.) One of the Gadite heroes who joined
David in his stronghold in the wilderness ([Ch1
12:9](../kjv/ch1012.htm#009)).

<span id="009">**Eliada**</span> Whom God cares for. (1.) One of David's
sons born after his establishment in Jerusalem ([Sa2
5:16](../kjv/sa2005.htm#016)). (2.) A mighty man of war, a Benjamite
([Ch2 17:17](../kjv/ch2017.htm#017)). (3.) An Aramite of Zobah, captain
of a marauding band that troubled Solomon ([Kg1
11:23](../kjv/kg1011.htm#023)).
