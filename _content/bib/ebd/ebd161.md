<span id="000">**Hammer**</span> (1.) Heb. pattish , used by
gold-beaters ([Isa 41:7](../kjv/isa041.htm#007)) and by quarrymen ([Jer
23:29](../kjv/jer023.htm#029)). Metaphorically of Babylon ([Jer
50:23](../kjv/jer050.htm#023)) or Nebuchadnezzar. (2.) Heb. makabah , a
stone-cutter's mallet ([Kg1 6:7](../kjv/kg1006.htm#007)), or of any
workman ([Jdg 4:21](../kjv/jdg004.htm#021); [Isa
44:12](../kjv/isa044.htm#012)). (3.) Heb. halmuth , a poetical word for
a workman's hammer, found only in [Jdg 5:26](../kjv/jdg005.htm#026),
where it denotes the mallet with which the pins of the tent of the nomad
are driven into the ground. (4.) Heb. mappets , rendered "battle-ax" in
[Jer 51:20](../kjv/jer051.htm#020). This was properly a "mace," which is
thus described by Rawlinson: "The Assyrian mace was a short, thin
weapon, and must either have been made of a very tough wood or (and this
is more probable) of metal. It had an ornamented head, which was
sometimes very beautifully modeled, and generally a strap or string at
the lower end by which it could be grasped with greater firmness."

<span id="001">**Hammoleketh**</span> The queen, the daughter of Machir
and sister of Gilead ([Ch1 7:17](../kjv/ch1007.htm#017), [Ch1
7:18](../kjv/ch1007.htm#018)). Abiezer was one of her three children.

<span id="002">**Hammon**</span> Warm springs. (1.) A town in the tribe
of Asher, near Zidon ([Jos 19:28](../kjv/jos019.htm#028)), identified
with 'Ain Hamul . (2.) A Levitical city of Naphtali ([Ch1
6:76](../kjv/ch1006.htm#076)).

<span id="003">**Hammoth-dor**</span> Warm springs, a Levitical city of
Naphtali ([Jos 21:32](../kjv/jos021.htm#032)); probably Hammath in [Jos
19:35](../kjv/jos019.htm#035).

<span id="004">**Hamor**</span> See BAAL-HAMON.

<span id="005">**Hamonah**</span> Multitude, a name figuratively
assigned to the place in which the slaughter and burial of the forces of
Gog were to take place ([Eze 39:16](../kjv/eze039.htm#016)).

<span id="006">**Hamon-gog**</span> Multitude of Gog, the name of the
valley in which the slaughtered forces of Gog are to be buried ([Eze
39:11](../kjv/eze039.htm#011), [Eze 39:15](../kjv/eze039.htm#015)), "the
valley of the passengers on the east of the sea."

<span id="007">**Hamon**</span> He-ass, a Hivite from whom Jacob
purchased the plot of ground in which Joseph was afterwards buried ([Gen
33:19](../kjv/gen033.htm#019)). He is called "Emmor" in [Act
7:16](../kjv/act007.htm#016). His son Shechem founded the city of that
name which Simeon and Levi destroyed because of his crime in the matter
of Dinah, Jacob's daughter ([Gen 34:20](../kjv/gen034.htm#020)). Hamor
and Shechem were also slain ([Gen 34:26](../kjv/gen034.htm#026)).

<span id="008">**Hamul**</span> Spared, one of the sons of Pharez, son
of Judah ([Ch1 2:5](../kjv/ch1002.htm#005)). His descendants are called
Hamulites ([Num 26:21](../kjv/num026.htm#021)).

<span id="009">**Hamutal**</span> Kinsman of the dew, the daughter of
Jeremiah of Libnah, wife of king Josiah, and mother of king Jehoahaz
([Kg2 23:31](../kjv/kg2023.htm#031)), also of king Zedekiah ([Kg2
24:18](../kjv/kg2024.htm#018)).
