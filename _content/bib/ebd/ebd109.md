<span id="000">**Dulcimer**</span> (Heb. sumphoniah ), a musical
instrument mentioned in [Dan 3:5](../kjv/dan003.htm#005), [Dan
3:15](../kjv/dan003.htm#015), along with other instruments there named,
as sounded before the golden image. It was not a Jewish instrument. In
the margin of the Revised Version it is styled the "bag-pipe." Luther
translated it "lute," and Grotius the "crooked trumpet." It is probable
that it was introduced into Babylon by some Greek or Western-Asiatic
musician. Some Rabbinical commentators render it by "organ," the
well-known instrument composed of a series of pipes, others by "lyre."
The most probable interpretation is that it was a bag-pipe similar to
the zampagna of Southern Europe.

<span id="001">**Dumah**</span> Silence, (compare [Psa
94:17](../kjv/psa094.htm#017)), the fourth son of Ishmael; also the
tribe descended from him; and hence also the region in Arabia which they
inhabited ([Gen 25:14](../kjv/gen025.htm#014); [Ch1
1:30](../kjv/ch1001.htm#030)). There was also a town of this name in
Judah ([Jos 15:52](../kjv/jos015.htm#052)), which has been identified
with ed-Domeh, about 10 miles southwest of Hebron. The place mentioned
in the "burden" of the prophet Isaiah ([Isa
21:11](../kjv/isa021.htm#011)) is Edom or Idumea.

<span id="002">**Dumb**</span> From natural infirmity ([Exo
4:11](../kjv/exo004.htm#011)); not knowing what to say ([Pro
31:8](../kjv/pro031.htm#008)); unwillingness to speak ([Psa
39:9](../kjv/psa039.htm#009); [Lev 10:3](../kjv/lev010.htm#003)). Christ
repeatedly restored the dumb ([Mat 9:32](../kjv/mat009.htm#032), [Mat
9:33](../kjv/mat009.htm#033); [Luk 11:14](../kjv/luk011.htm#014); [Mat
12:22](../kjv/mat012.htm#022)) to the use of speech.

<span id="003">**Dung**</span> (1.) Used as manure ([Luk
13:8](../kjv/luk013.htm#008)); collected outside the city walls ([Neh
2:13](../kjv/neh002.htm#013)). Of sacrifices, burned outside the camp
([Exo 29:14](../kjv/exo029.htm#014); [Lev 4:11](../kjv/lev004.htm#011);
[Lev 8:17](../kjv/lev008.htm#017); [Num 19:5](../kjv/num019.htm#005)).
To be "cast out as dung," a figurative expression ([Kg1
14:10](../kjv/kg1014.htm#010); [Kg2 9:37](../kjv/kg2009.htm#037); [Jer
8:2](../kjv/jer008.htm#002); [Psa 18:42](../kjv/psa018.htm#042)),
meaning to be rejected as unprofitable. (2.) Used as fuel, a substitute
for firewood, which was with difficulty procured in Syria, Arabia, and
Egypt ([Eze 4:12](../kjv/eze004.htm#012)), where cows' and camels' dung
is used to the present day for this purpose.

<span id="004">**Dung-gate**</span> ([Neh 2:13](../kjv/neh002.htm#013)),
a gate of ancient Jerusalem, on the south-west quarter. "The gate
outside of which lay the piles of sweepings and off-scourings of the
streets," in the valley of Tophet.

<span id="005">**Dung-hill**</span> To sit on a, was a sign of the
deepest dejection ([Sa1 2:8](../kjv/sa1002.htm#008); [Psa
113:7](../kjv/psa113.htm#007); [Lam 4:5](../kjv/lam004.htm#005)).

<span id="006">**Dungeon**</span> Different from the ordinary prison in
being more severe as a place of punishment. Like the Roman inner prison
([Act 16:24](../kjv/act016.htm#024)), it consisted of a deep cell or
cistern ([Jer 38:6](../kjv/jer038.htm#006)). To be shut up in, a
punishment common in Egypt ([Gen 39:20](../kjv/gen039.htm#020); [Gen
40:3](../kjv/gen040.htm#003); [Gen 41:10](../kjv/gen041.htm#010); [Gen
42:19](../kjv/gen042.htm#019)). It is not mentioned, however, in the law
of Moses as a mode of punishment. Under the later kings imprisonment was
frequently used as a punishment ([Ch2 16:10](../kjv/ch2016.htm#010);
[Jer 20:2](../kjv/jer020.htm#002); [Jer 32:2](../kjv/jer032.htm#002);
[Jer 33:1](../kjv/jer033.htm#001); [Jer 37:15](../kjv/jer037.htm#015)),
and it was customary after the Exile ([Mat 11:2](../kjv/mat011.htm#002);
[Luk 3:20](../kjv/luk003.htm#020); [Act 5:18](../kjv/act005.htm#018),
[Act 5:21](../kjv/act005.htm#021); [Mat 18:30](../kjv/mat018.htm#030)).

<span id="007">**Dura**</span> The circle, the plain near Babylon in
which Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden image, mentioned in [Dan
3:1](../kjv/dan003.htm#001). The place still retains its ancient name.
On one of its many mounds the pedestal of what must have been a colossal
statue has been found. It has been supposed to be that of the golden
image.

<span id="008">**Dust**</span> Storms of sand and dust sometimes
overtake Eastern travelers. They are very dreadful, many perishing under
them. Jehovah threatens to bring on the land of Israel, as a punishment
for forsaking him, a rain of "powder and dust" ([Deu
28:24](../kjv/deu028.htm#024)). To cast dust on the head was a sign of
mourning ([Jos 7:6](../kjv/jos007.htm#006)); and to sit in dust, of
extreme affliction ([Isa 47:1](../kjv/isa047.htm#001)). "Dust" is used
to denote the grave ([Job 7:21](../kjv/job007.htm#021)). "To shake off
the dust from one's feet" against another is to renounce all future
intercourse with him ([Mat 10:14](../kjv/mat010.htm#014); [Act
13:51](../kjv/act013.htm#051)). To "lick the dust" is a sign of abject
submission ([Psa 72:9](../kjv/psa072.htm#009)); and to throw dust at one
is a sign of abhorrence ([Sa2 16:13](../kjv/sa2016.htm#013); compare
[Act 22:23](../kjv/act022.htm#023)).

<span id="009">**Dwarf**</span> A lean or emaciated person ([Lev
21:20](../kjv/lev021.htm#020)).
