<span id="000">**Asa**</span> Physician, son of Abijah and grandson of
Rehoboam, was the third king of Judah. He was zealous in maintaining the
true worship of God, and in rooting all idolatry, with its accompanying
immoralities, out of the land (1 Kings 15; 8-14). The Lord gave him and
his land rest and prosperity. It is recorded of him, however, that in
his old age, when afflicted, he "sought not to the Lord, but to the
physicians" (compare [Jer 17:5](../kjv/jer017.htm#005)). He died in the
forty-first year of his reign, greatly honored by his people ([Ch2
16:1](../kjv/ch2016.htm#001)), and was succeeded by his son Jehoshaphat.

<span id="001">**Asahel**</span> Made by God, the youngest son of
Zeruiah, David's sister. He was celebrated for his swiftness of foot.
When fighting against Ish-bosheth at Gibeon, in the army of his brother
Joab, he was put to death by Abner, whom he pursued from the field of
battle ([Sa2 2:18](../kjv/sa2002.htm#018), [Sa2
2:19](../kjv/sa2002.htm#019)). He is mentioned among David's thirty
mighty men ([Sa2 23:24](../kjv/sa2023.htm#024); [Ch1
11:26](../kjv/ch1011.htm#026)). Others of the same name are mentioned
([Ch2 17:8](../kjv/ch2017.htm#008); [Ch2 31:13](../kjv/ch2031.htm#013);
[Ezr 10:15](../kjv/ezr010.htm#015)).

<span id="002">**Asaph**</span> Convener, or collector. (1.) A Levite;
one of the leaders of David's choir ([Ch1 6:39](../kjv/ch1006.htm#039)).
Psalm 50 and Psalms 73-83 inclusive are attributed to him. He is
mentioned along with David as skilled in music, and a "seer" ([Ch2
29:30](../kjv/ch2029.htm#030)). The "sons of Asaph," mentioned in [Ch1
25:1](../kjv/ch1025.htm#001), [Ch2 20:14](../kjv/ch2020.htm#014), and
[Ezr 2:41](../kjv/ezr002.htm#041), were his descendants, or more
probably a class of poets or singers who recognized him as their master.
(2.) The "recorder" in the time of Hezekiah ([Kg2
18:18](../kjv/kg2018.htm#018), [Kg2 18:37](../kjv/kg2018.htm#037)). (3.)
The "keeper of the king's forest," to whom Nehemiah requested from
Artaxerxes a "letter" that he might give him timber for the temple at
Jerusalem ([Neh 2:8](../kjv/neh002.htm#008)).

<span id="003">**Ascension**</span> See CHRIST.

<span id="004">**Asenath**</span> An Egyptian name, meaning "gift of the
sun-god", daughter of Potipherah, priest of On or Heliopolis, wife of
Joseph ([Gen 41:45](../kjv/gen041.htm#045)). She was the mother of
Manasseh and Ephraim ([Gen 41:50](../kjv/gen041.htm#050); [Gen
46:20](../kjv/gen046.htm#020)).

<span id="005">**Ash**</span> (Heb. o'ren , "tremulous"), mentioned only
[Isa 44:14](../kjv/isa044.htm#014) (R.V., "fir tree"). It is rendered
"pine tree" both in the LXX. and Vulgate versions. There is a tree
called by the Arabs aran, found still in the valleys of Arabia Petraea,
whose leaf resembles that of the mountain ash. This may be the tree
meant. Our ash tree is not known in Syria.

<span id="006">**Ashdod**</span> Stronghold, a Philistine city ([Jos
15:47](../kjv/jos015.htm#047)), about midway between Gaza and Joppa, and
3 miles from the Mediterranean. It was one of the chief seats of the
worship of Dagon ([Sa1 5:5](../kjv/sa1005.htm#005)). It belonged to the
tribe of Judah ([Jos 15:47](../kjv/jos015.htm#047)), but it never came
into their actual possession. It was an important city, as it stood on
the highroad from Egypt to Palestine, and hence was strongly fortified
([Ch2 26:6](../kjv/ch2026.htm#006); [Isa 20:1](../kjv/isa020.htm#001)).
Uzziah took it, but fifty years after his death it was taken by the
Assyrians (758 B.C.). According to Sargon's record, it was captured by
him in 711 B.C.. The only reference to it in the New Testament, where it
is called Azotus, is in the account of Philip's return from Gaza ([Act
8:40](../kjv/act008.htm#040)). It is now called Eshdud.

<span id="007">**Ashdoth-pisgah**</span> ([Deu
3:17](../kjv/deu003.htm#017); [Jos 12:3](../kjv/jos012.htm#003); [Jos
13:20](../kjv/jos013.htm#020)) in Authorized Version, but in Revised
Version translated "slopes of Pisgah." In [Deu
4:49](../kjv/deu004.htm#049) it is translated in the Authorized Version
"springs of Pisgah." The name Ashdoth is translated "springs" in the
Authorized Version, but "slopes" in the Revised Version, of [Jos
10:40](../kjv/jos010.htm#040); [Jos 12:8](../kjv/jos012.htm#008). It has
been identified with the springs under Mount Nebo, now called 'Ayun Musa
.

<span id="008">**Asher**</span> Happy, Jacob's eighth son; his mother
was Zilpah, Leah's handmaid ([Gen 30:13](../kjv/gen030.htm#013)). Of the
tribe founded by him nothing is recorded beyond its holding a place in
the list of the tribes ([Gen 35:26](../kjv/gen035.htm#026); [Gen
46:17](../kjv/gen046.htm#017); [Exo 1:4](../kjv/exo001.htm#004), etc.)
It increased in numbers twenty-nine percent. during the thirty-eight
years' wanderings. The place of this tribe during the march through the
desert was between Dan and Naphtali ([Num 2:27](../kjv/num002.htm#027)).
See map, Showing the Territory of Asher The boundaries of the
inheritance given to it, which contained some of the richest soil in
Palestine, and the names of its towns, are recorded in [Jos
19:24](../kjv/jos019.htm#024); [Jdg 1:31](../kjv/jdg001.htm#031), [Jdg
1:32](../kjv/jdg001.htm#032). Asher and Simeon were the only tribes west
of the Jordan which furnished no hero or judge for the nation. Anna the
prophetess was of this tribe ([Luk 2:36](../kjv/luk002.htm#036)).

<span id="009">**Asherah**</span> Plural Asherim in Revised Version,
instead of "grove" and "groves" of the Authorized Version. This was the
name of a sensual Canaanitish goddess Astarte, the feminine of the
Assyrian Ishtar. Its symbol was the stem of a tree deprived of its
boughs, and rudely shaped into an image, and planted in the ground. Such
religious symbols ("groves") are frequently alluded to in Scripture
([Exo 34:13](../kjv/exo034.htm#013); [Jdg 6:25](../kjv/jdg006.htm#025);
[Kg2 23:6](../kjv/kg2023.htm#006); [Kg1 16:33](../kjv/kg1016.htm#033),
etc.). These images were also sometimes made of silver or of carved
stone ([Kg2 21:7](../kjv/kg2021.htm#007); "the graven image of Asherah,"
R.V.). (See GROVE \[1\].).
