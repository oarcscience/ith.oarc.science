<P><A NAME="000"><B>Offense</B></A>      (1.) An injury or wrong done to one (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1025.htm#031">Sa1 25:31</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rom005.htm#015">Rom 5:15</A>). (2.) A stumbling-block or cause of temptation (<A HREF="../kjv/isa008.htm#014">Isa 8:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat016.htm#023">Mat 16:23</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat018.htm#007">Mat 18:7</A>). Greek  skandalon , properly that at which one stumbles or takes offense. The &quot;offense of the cross&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/gal005.htm#011">Gal 5:11</A>) is the offense the Jews took at the teaching that salvation was by the crucified One, and by him alone. Salvation by the cross was a stumbling-block to their national pride. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Offering</B></A>     An oblation, dedicated to God. Thus Cain consecrated to God of the firstfruits of the earth, and Abel of the firstlings of the flock (<A HREF="../kjv/gen004.htm#003">Gen 4:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen004.htm#004">Gen 4:4</A>). Under the Levitical system different kinds of offerings are specified, and laws laid down as to their presentation. These are described under their distinctive names. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Og</B></A>     Gigantic, the king of Bashan, who was defeated by Moses in a pitched battle at Edrei, and was slain along with his sons (<A HREF="../kjv/deu001.htm#004">Deu 1:4</A>), and whose kingdom was given to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh (<A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#032">Num 21:32</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu003.htm#001">Deu 3:1</A>). His bedstead (or rather sarcophagus) was of iron (or ironstone), 9 cubits in length and 4 cubits in breadth. His overthrow was afterwards celebrated in song (<A HREF="../kjv/psa135.htm#011">Psa 135:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa136.htm#020">Psa 136:20</A>). (See SIHON.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Ohad</B></A>     United, or power, the third son of Simeon (<A HREF="../kjv/gen046.htm#010">Gen 46:10</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Ohel</B></A>     A house; tent, the fourth son of Zerubbabel (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1003.htm#020">Ch1 3:20</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Oil</B></A>     Only olive oil seems to have been used among the Hebrews. It was used for many purposes: for anointing the body or the hair (<A HREF="../kjv/exo029.htm#007">Exo 29:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa2014.htm#002">Sa2 14:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa023.htm#005">Psa 23:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa092.htm#010">Psa 92:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa104.htm#015">Psa 104:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk007.htm#046">Luk 7:46</A>); in some of the offerings (<A HREF="../kjv/exo029.htm#040">Exo 29:40</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lev007.htm#012">Lev 7:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num006.htm#015">Num 6:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num015.htm#004">Num 15:4</A>), but was excluded from the sin-offering (<A HREF="../kjv/lev005.htm#011">Lev 5:11</A>) and the jealousy-offering (<A HREF="../kjv/num005.htm#015">Num 5:15</A>); for burning in lamps (<A HREF="../kjv/exo025.htm#006">Exo 25:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo027.htm#020">Exo 27:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat025.htm#003">Mat 25:3</A>); for medicinal purposes (<A HREF="../kjv/isa001.htm#006">Isa 1:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk010.htm#034">Luk 10:34</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jam005.htm#014">Jam 5:14</A>); and for anointing the dead (<A HREF="../kjv/mat026.htm#012">Mat 26:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk023.htm#056">Luk 23:56</A>). It was one of the most valuable products of the country (<A HREF="../kjv/deu032.htm#013">Deu 32:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/eze016.htm#013">Eze 16:13</A>), and formed an article of extensive commerce with Tyre (<A HREF="../kjv/eze027.htm#017">Eze 27:17</A>). The use of it was a sign of gladness (<A HREF="../kjv/psa092.htm#010">Psa 92:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa061.htm#003">Isa 61:3</A>), and its omission a token of sorrow (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2014.htm#002">Sa2 14:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat006.htm#017">Mat 6:17</A>). It was very abundant in Galilee. (See OLIVE.)

<P><A NAME="006"><B>Oil-tree</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/isa041.htm#019">Isa 41:19</A>; R.V. marg., &quot;oleaster&quot;), Heb.  'etz shemen , rendered &quot;olive tree&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/kg1006.htm#023">Kg1 6:23</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg1006.htm#031">Kg1 6:31</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg1006.htm#032">Kg1 6:32</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg1006.htm#033">Kg1 6:33</A> (R.V., &quot;olive wood&quot;) and &quot;pine branches&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/neh008.htm#015">Neh 8:15</A> (R.V., &quot;branches of wild olive&quot;), was some tree distinct from the olive. It was probably the oleaster (Eleagnus angustifolius), which grows abundantly in almost all parts of Palestine, especially about Hebron and Samaria. &quot;It has a fine hard wood,&quot; says Tristram, &quot;and yields an inferior oil, but it has no relationship to the olive, which, however, it resembles in general appearance.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Ointment</B></A>     Various fragrant preparations, also compounds for medical purposes, are so called (<A HREF="../kjv/exo030.htm#025">Exo 30:25</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa133.htm#002">Psa 133:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa001.htm#006">Isa 1:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/amo006.htm#006">Amo 6:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joh012.htm#003">Joh 12:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rev018.htm#013">Rev 18:13</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Old Gate</B></A>     One of the gates in the north wall of Jerusalem, so called because built by the Jebusites (<A HREF="../kjv/neh003.htm#006">Neh 3:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh012.htm#039">Neh 12:39</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Olive</B></A>     The fruit of the olive-tree. This tree yielded oil which was highly valued. The best oil was from olives that were plucked before being fully ripe, and then beaten or squeezed (<A HREF="../kjv/deu024.htm#020">Deu 24:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa017.htm#006">Isa 17:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa024.htm#013">Isa 24:13</A>). It was called &quot;beaten,&quot; or &quot;fresh oil&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/exo027.htm#020">Exo 27:20</A>). There were also oil-presses, in which the oil was trodden out by the feet (<A HREF="../kjv/mic006.htm#015">Mic 6:15</A>). James (<A HREF="../kjv/jam003.htm#012">Jam 3:12</A>) calls the fruit &quot;olive berries.&quot; The phrase &quot;vineyards and olives&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg015.htm#005">Jdg 15:5</A>, A.V.) should be simply &quot;olive-yard,&quot; or &quot;olive-garden,&quot; as in the Revised Version. (See OIL.)
