<span id="000">**Jotham**</span> Jehovah is perfect. (1.) The youngest
of Gideon's seventy sons. He escaped when the rest were put to death by
the order of Abimelech ([Jdg 9:5](../kjv/jdg009.htm#005)). When "the
citizens of Shechem and the whole house of Millo" were gathered together
"by the plain of the pillar" (i.e., the stone set up by Joshua, [Jos
24:26](../kjv/jos024.htm#026); compare [Gen
35:4](../kjv/gen035.htm#004)) "that was in Shechem, to make Abimelech
king," from one of the heights of Mount Gerizim he protested against
their doing so in the earliest parable, that of the bramble-king. His
words then spoken were prophetic. There came a recoil in the feelings of
the people toward Abimelech, and then a terrible revenge, in which many
were slain and the city of Shechem was destroyed by Abimelech ([Jdg
9:45](../kjv/jdg009.htm#045)). Having delivered his warning, Jotham fled
to Beer from the vengeance of Abimelech ([Jdg
9:7](../kjv/jdg009.htm#007)). (2.) The son and successor of Uzziah on
the throne of Judah. As during his last years Uzziah was excluded from
public life on account of his leprosy, his son, then twenty-five years
of age, administered for seven years the affairs of the kingdom in his
father's stead ([Ch2 26:21](../kjv/ch2026.htm#021), [Ch2
26:23](../kjv/ch2026.htm#023); [Ch2 27:1](../kjv/ch2027.htm#001)). After
his father's death he became sole monarch, and reigned for sixteen years
(759-743 B.C.). He ruled in the fear of God, and his reign was
prosperous. He was contemporary with the prophets Isaiah, Hosea, and
Micah, by whose ministrations he profited. He was buried in the
sepulchre of the kings, greatly lamented by the people ([Kg2
15:38](../kjv/kg2015.htm#038); [Ch2 27:7](../kjv/ch2027.htm#007)).

<span id="001">**Journey**</span> (1.) A day's journey in the East is
from 16 to 20 miles ([Num 11:31](../kjv/num011.htm#031)). (2.) A
Sabbath-day's journey is 2,000 paces or yards from the city walls ([Act
1:12](../kjv/act001.htm#012)). According to Jewish tradition, it was the
distance one might travel without violating the law of [Exo
16:29](../kjv/exo016.htm#029). (See SABBATH.)

<span id="002">**Jozabad**</span> Whom Jehovah bestows. (1.) One of the
Benjamite archers who joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1
12:4](../kjv/ch1012.htm#004)). (2.) A chief of the tribe of Manasseh
([Ch1 12:20](../kjv/ch1012.htm#020)).

<span id="003">**Jozachar**</span> Jehovah-remembered, one of the two
servants who assassinated Jehoash, the king of Judah, in Millo ([Kg2
12:21](../kjv/kg2012.htm#021)). He is called also Zabad ([Ch2
24:26](../kjv/ch2024.htm#026)).

<span id="004">**Jubal**</span> Jubilee, music, Lamech's second son by
Adah, of the line of Cain. He was the inventor of "the harp" (Heb.
kinnor , properly "lyre") and "the organ" (Heb. 'ugab , properly
"mouth-organ" or Pan's pipe), [Gen 4:21](../kjv/gen004.htm#021).

<span id="005">**Jubilee**</span> A joyful shout or clangour of
trumpets, the name of the great semi-centennial festival of the Hebrews.
It lasted for a year. During this year the land was to be fallow, and
the Israelites were only permitted to gather the spontaneous produce of
the fields ([Lev 25:11](../kjv/lev025.htm#011), [Lev
25:12](../kjv/lev025.htm#012)). All landed property during that year
reverted to its original owner (Lev. 25:13-34; [Lev
27:16](../kjv/lev027.htm#016)), and all who were slaves were set free
(Lev. 25:39-54), and all debts were remitted. The return of the jubilee
year was proclaimed by a blast of trumpets which sounded throughout the
land. There is no record in Scripture of the actual observance of this
festival, but there are numerous allusions ([Isa
5:7](../kjv/isa005.htm#007), [Isa 5:8](../kjv/isa005.htm#008), [Isa
5:9](../kjv/isa005.htm#009), [Isa 5:10](../kjv/isa005.htm#010); [Isa
61:1](../kjv/isa061.htm#001), [Isa 61:2](../kjv/isa061.htm#002); [Eze
7:12](../kjv/eze007.htm#012), [Eze 7:13](../kjv/eze007.htm#013); Neh.
5:1-19; [Ch2 36:21](../kjv/ch2036.htm#021)) which place it beyond a
doubt that it was observed. The advantages of this institution were
manifold: (1.) It would prevent the accumulation of land on the part of
a few to the detriment of the community at large. (2.) It would render
it impossible for any one to be born to absolute poverty, since every
one had his hereditary land. (3.) It would preclude those inequalities
which are produced by extremes of riches and poverty, and which make one
man domineer over another. (4.) It would utterly do away with slavery.
(5.) It would afford a fresh opportunity to those who were reduced by
adverse circumstances to begin again their career of industry in the
patrimony which they had temporarily forfeited. (6.) It would
periodically rectify the disorders which crept into the state in the
course of time, preclude the division of the people into nobles and
plebeians, and preserve the theocracy inviolate.

<span id="006">**Juda**</span> (1.) The patriarch Judah, son of Jacob
([Luk 3:33](../kjv/luk003.htm#033); [Heb 7:14](../kjv/heb007.htm#014)).
In [Luk 1:39](../kjv/luk001.htm#039); [Heb 7:14](../kjv/heb007.htm#014);
[Rev 5:5](../kjv/rev005.htm#005); [Rev 7:5](../kjv/rev007.htm#005), the
word refers to the tribe of Judah. (2.) The father of Simeon in Christ's
maternal ancestry ([Luk 3:30](../kjv/luk003.htm#030)). (3.) Son of
Joanna, and father of Joseph in Christ's maternal ancestry ([Luk
3:26](../kjv/luk003.htm#026)), probably identical with Abiud ([Mat
1:13](../kjv/mat001.htm#013)), and with Obadiah ([Ch1
3:21](../kjv/ch1003.htm#021)). (4.) One of the Lord's "brethren" ([Mar
6:3](../kjv/mar006.htm#003)).

<span id="007">**Judah**</span> Praise, the fourth son of Jacob by Leah.
The name originated in Leah's words of praise to the Lord on account of
his birth: "Now will I praise \[Heb. odeh \] Jehovah, and she called his
name Yehudah" ([Gen 29:35](../kjv/gen029.htm#035)). It was Judah that
interposed in behalf of Joseph, so that his life was spared ([Gen
37:26](../kjv/gen037.htm#026), [Gen 37:27](../kjv/gen037.htm#027)). He
took a lead in the affairs of the family, and "prevailed above his
brethren" ([Gen 43:3](../kjv/gen043.htm#003); [Gen
44:14](../kjv/gen044.htm#014), 16-34; [Gen
46:28](../kjv/gen046.htm#028); [Ch1 5:2](../kjv/ch1005.htm#002)). Soon
after the sale of Joseph to the Ishmaelites, Judah went to reside at
Adullam, where he married a woman of Canaan. (See ONAN and TAMAR.) After
the death of his wife Shuah, he returned to his father's house, and
there exercised much influence over the patriarch, taking a principal
part in the events which led to the whole family at length going down
into Egypt. We hear nothing more of him till he received his father's
blessing ([Gen 49:8](../kjv/gen049.htm#008)).

<span id="008">**Judah, Tribe of**</span> Judah and his three surviving
sons went down with Jacob into Egypt ([Gen
46:12](../kjv/gen046.htm#012); [Exo 1:2](../kjv/exo001.htm#002)). At the
time of the Exodus, when we meet with the family of Judah again, they
have increased to the number of 74,000 males ([Num
1:26](../kjv/num001.htm#026), [Num 1:27](../kjv/num001.htm#027)). Its
number increased in the wilderness ([Num 26:22](../kjv/num026.htm#022)).
Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, represented the tribe as one of the spies
([Num 13:6](../kjv/num013.htm#006); [Num 34:19](../kjv/num034.htm#019)).
This tribe marched at the van on the east of the tabernacle ([Num
2:3](../kjv/num002.htm#003); [Num 10:14](../kjv/num010.htm#014)), its
standard, as is supposed, being a lion's whelp. Under Caleb, during the
wars of conquest, they conquered that portion of the country which was
afterwards assigned to them as their inheritance. This was the only case
in which any tribe had its inheritance thus determined ([Jos
14:6](../kjv/jos014.htm#006); [Jos 15:13](../kjv/jos015.htm#013)). The
inheritance of the tribe of Judah was at first fully one-third of the
whole country west of Jordan, in all about 2,300 square miles (Josh.
15). But there was a second distribution, when Simeon received an
allotment, about 1,000 square miles, out of the portion of Judah ([Jos
19:9](../kjv/jos019.htm#009)). That which remained to Judah was still
very large in proportion to the inheritance of the other tribes. The
boundaries of the territory are described in Josh. 15:20-63. This
territory given to Judah was divided into four sections. (1.) The south
(Heb. negeb ), the undulating pasture-ground between the hills and the
desert to the south ([Jos 15:21](../kjv/jos015.htm#021).) This extent of
pasture-land became famous as the favourite camping-ground of the old
patriarchs. (2.) The "valley" ([Jos 15:33](../kjv/jos015.htm#033)) or
lowland (Heb. shephelah ), a broad strip lying between the central
highlands and the Mediterranean. This tract was the garden as well as
the granary of the tribe. (3.) The "hill-country," or the mountains of
Judah, an elevated plateau stretching from below Hebron northward to
Jerusalem. "The towns and villages were generally perched on the tops of
hills or on rocky slopes. The resources of the soil were great. The
country was rich in corn, wine, oil, and fruit; and the daring shepherds
were able to lead their flocks far out over the neighbouring plains and
through the mountains." The number of towns in this district was
thirty-eight ([Jos 15:48](../kjv/jos015.htm#048)). (4.) The
"wilderness," the sunken district next the Dead Sea ([Jos
15:61](../kjv/jos015.htm#061)), "averaging 10 miles in breadth, a wild,
barren, uninhabitable region, fit only to afford scanty pasturage for
sheep and goats, and a secure home for leopards, bears, wild goats, and
outlaws" ([Sa1 17:34](../kjv/sa1017.htm#034); [Sa1
22:1](../kjv/sa1022.htm#001); [Mar 1:13](../kjv/mar001.htm#013)). It was
divided into the "wilderness of En-gedi" ([Sa1
24:1](../kjv/sa1024.htm#001)), the "wilderness of Judah" ([Jdg
1:16](../kjv/jdg001.htm#016); [Mat 3:1](../kjv/mat003.htm#001)), between
the Hebron mountain range and the Dead Sea, the "wilderness of Maon"
([Sa1 23:24](../kjv/sa1023.htm#024)). It contained only six cities. Nine
of the cities of Judah were assigned to the priests ([Jos
21:9](../kjv/jos021.htm#009)).

<span id="009">**Judah Upon Jordan**</span> The Authorized Version,
following the Vulgate, has this rendering in [Jos
19:34](../kjv/jos019.htm#034). It has been suggested that, following the
Masoretic punctuation, the expression should read thus, "and Judah; the
Jordan was toward the sun-rising." The sixty cities (Havothjair, [Num
32:41](../kjv/num032.htm#041)) on the east of Jordan were reckoned as
belonging to Judah, because Jair, their founder, was a Manassite only on
his mother's side, but on his father's side of the tribe of Judah ([Ch1
2:5](../kjv/ch1002.htm#005), [Ch1 2:21](../kjv/ch1002.htm#021)).
