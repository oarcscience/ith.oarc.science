<P><A NAME="000"><B>Mahlah</B></A>     Disease, one of the five daughters of Zelophehad (<A HREF="../kjv/num027.htm#001">Num 27:1</A>) who had their father's inheritance, the law of inheritance having been altered in their favour. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Mahlon</B></A>     Sickly, the elder of Elimelech the Bethlehemite's two sons by Naomi. He married Ruth and died childless (<A HREF="../kjv/rut001.htm#002">Rut 1:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/rut001.htm#005">Rut 1:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rut004.htm#009">Rut 4:9</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/rut004.htm#010">Rut 4:10</A>), in the land of Moab. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Mahol</B></A>     Dance, the father of four sons (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1004.htm#031">Kg1 4:31</A>) who were inferior in wisdom only to Solomon. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Mail, Coat of</B></A>     &quot;A corselet of scales,&quot; a cuirass formed of pieces of metal overlapping each other, like fish-scales (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1017.htm#005">Sa1 17:5</A>); also (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1017.htm#038">Sa1 17:38</A>) a corselet or garment thus encased. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Main-sail</B></A>     (Gr.  artemon ), answering to the modern &quot;mizzen-sail,&quot; as some suppose. Others understand the &quot;jib,&quot; near the prow, or the &quot;fore-sail,&quot; as likely to be most useful in bringing a ship's head to the wind in the circumstances described (<A HREF="../kjv/act027.htm#040">Act 27:40</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Makheloth</B></A>     Assemblies, a station of the Israelites in the desert (<A HREF="../kjv/num033.htm#025">Num 33:25</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num033.htm#026">Num 33:26</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Makkedah</B></A>     Herdsman's place, one of the royal cities of the Canaanites (<A HREF="../kjv/jos012.htm#016">Jos 12:16</A>), near which was a cave where the five kings who had confederated against Israel sought refuge (Josh. 10:10-29). They were put to death by Joshua, who afterwards suspended their bodies upon five trees. It has been identified with the modern village called Sumeil, standing on a low hill about 7 miles to the north-west of Eleutheropolis (Beit Jibrin), where are ancient remains and a great cave. The Palestine Exploration surveyors have, however, identified it with el-Mughar, or &quot;the caves,&quot; 3 miles from Jabneh and 2 1/2 southwest of Ekron, because, they say, &quot;at this site only of all possible sites for Makkedah in the Palestine plain do caves still exist.&quot; (See ADONI-ZEDEC.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Maktesh</B></A>     Mortar, a place in or near Jerusalem inhabited by silver merchants (<A HREF="../kjv/zep001.htm#011">Zep 1:11</A>). It has been conjectured that it was the &quot;Phoenician quarter&quot; of the city, where the traders of that nation resided, after the Oriental custom. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Malachi</B></A>     Messenger or angel, the last of the minor prophets, and the writer of the last book of the Old Testament canon (<A HREF="../kjv/mal004.htm#004">Mal 4:4</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mal004.htm#005">Mal 4:5</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mal004.htm#006">Mal 4:6</A>). Nothing is known of him beyond what is contained in his book of prophecies. Some have supposed that the name is simply a title descriptive of his character as a messenger of Jehovah, and not a proper name. There is reason, however, to conclude that Malachi was the ordinary name of the prophet. He was contemporary with Nehemiah (compare <A HREF="../kjv/mal002.htm#008">Mal 2:8</A> with <A HREF="../kjv/neh013.htm#015">Neh 13:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mal002.htm#010">Mal 2:10</A> with <A HREF="../kjv/neh013.htm#023">Neh 13:23</A>). No allusion is made to him by Ezra, and he does not mention the restoration of the temple, and hence it is inferred that he prophesied after Haggai and Zechariah, and when the temple services were still in existence (<A HREF="../kjv/mal001.htm#010">Mal 1:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mal003.htm#010">Mal 3:10</A>). It is probable that he delivered his prophecies about 420 B.C., after the second return of Nehemiah from Persia (<A HREF="../kjv/neh013.htm#006">Neh 13:6</A>), or possibly before his return. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Malachi, Prophecies of</B></A>     The contents of the book are comprised in four chapters. In the Hebrew text the third and fourth chapters (of the A.V.) form but one. The whole consists of three sections, preceded by an introduction (<A HREF="../kjv/mal001.htm#001">Mal 1:1</A>), in which the prophet reminds Israel of Jehovah's love to them. The first section (Mal. 1:6 - 2:9) contains a stern rebuke addressed to the priests who had despised the name of Jehovah, and been leaders in a departure from his worship and from the covenant, and for their partiality in administering the law. In the second (<A HREF="../kjv/mal002.htm#009">Mal 2:9</A>) the people are rebuked for their intermarriages with idolatrous heathen. In the third (Mal. 2:17-4:6) he addresses the people as a whole, and warns them of the coming of the God of judgment, preceded by the advent of the Messiah. This book is frequently referred to in the New Testament (<A HREF="../kjv/mat011.htm#010">Mat 11:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat017.htm#012">Mat 17:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar001.htm#002">Mar 1:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar009.htm#011">Mar 9:11</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mar009.htm#012">Mar 9:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk001.htm#017">Luk 1:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rom009.htm#013">Rom 9:13</A>).
