<P><A NAME="000"><B>Ambush</B></A>     Joshua at the capture of Ai lay in ambush, and so deceived the inhabitants that he gained an easy victory (Josh. 8:4-26). Shechem was taken in this manner (Judg. 9:30-45. Compare <A HREF="../kjv/jer051.htm#012">Jer 51:12</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Amen</B></A>     This Hebrew word means firm, and hence also faithful (<A HREF="../kjv/rev003.htm#014">Rev 3:14</A>). In <A HREF="../kjv/isa065.htm#016">Isa 65:16</A>, the Authorized Version has &quot;the God of truth,&quot; which in Hebrew is &quot;the God of Amen.&quot; It is frequently used by our Saviour to give emphasis to his words, where it is translated &quot;verily.&quot; Sometimes, only, however, in John's Gospel, it is repeated, &quot;Verily, verily.&quot; It is used as an epithet of the Lord Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../kjv/rev003.htm#014">Rev 3:14</A>). It is found singly and sometimes doubly at the end of prayers (<A HREF="../kjv/psa041.htm#013">Psa 41:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa072.htm#019">Psa 72:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa089.htm#052">Psa 89:52</A>), to confirm the words and invoke the fulfillment of them. It is used in token of being bound by an oath (<A HREF="../kjv/num005.htm#022">Num 5:22</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu027.htm#015">Deu 27:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh005.htm#013">Neh 5:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh008.htm#006">Neh 8:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1016.htm#036">Ch1 16:36</A>). In the primitive churches it was common for the general audience to say &quot;Amen&quot; at the close of the prayer (<A HREF="../kjv/co1014.htm#016">Co1 14:16</A>). The promises of God are Amen; i.e., they are all true and sure (<A HREF="../kjv/co2001.htm#020">Co2 1:20</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Amethyst</B></A>     One of the precious stones in the breastplate of the high priest (<A HREF="../kjv/exo028.htm#019">Exo 28:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo039.htm#012">Exo 39:12</A>), and in the foundation of the New Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/rev021.htm#020">Rev 21:20</A>). The ancients thought that this stone had the power of dispelling drunkenness in all who wore or touched it, and hence its Greek name formed from a, &quot; privative ,&quot; and  methuo , &quot;to get drunk.&quot; Its Jewish name,  ahlamah' , was derived by the rabbins from the Hebrew word  halam , &quot;to dream,&quot; from its supposed power of causing the wearer to dream. It is a pale-blue crystallized quartz, varying to a dark purple blue. It is found in Persia and India, also in different parts of Europe.
