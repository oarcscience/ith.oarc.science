<span id="000">**Hanes**</span> A place in Egypt mentioned only in [Isa
30:4](../kjv/isa030.htm#004) in connection with a reproof given to the
Jews for trusting in Egypt. It was considered the same as Tahpanhes, a
fortified town on the eastern frontier, but has been also identified as
Ahnas-el-Medeeneh, 70 miles from Cairo.

<span id="001">**Hanging**</span> (1.) As a punishment - a mark of
infamy inflicted on the dead bodies of criminals ([Deu
21:23](../kjv/deu021.htm#023)) rather than our modern mode of
punishment. Criminals were first strangled and then hanged ([Num
25:4](../kjv/num025.htm#004); [Deu 21:22](../kjv/deu021.htm#022)). (See
[Sa2 21:6](../kjv/sa2021.htm#006) for the practice of the Gibeonites.)
(2.) As a curtain - (a.) Heb. masak , (1.) before the entrance to the
court of the tabernacle ([Exo 35:17](../kjv/exo035.htm#017)); (2.)
before the door of the tabernacle ([Exo 26:36](../kjv/exo026.htm#036),
[Exo 26:37](../kjv/exo026.htm#037)); (3.) before the entrance to the
most holy place, called "the veil of the covering" ([Exo
35:12](../kjv/exo035.htm#012); [Exo 39:34](../kjv/exo039.htm#034)), as
the word properly means. (3.) Heb. kelaim , tapestry covering the walls
of the tabernacle ([Exo 27:9](../kjv/exo027.htm#009); [Exo
35:17](../kjv/exo035.htm#017); [Num 3:26](../kjv/num003.htm#026)) to the
half of the height of the wall ([Exo 27:18](../kjv/exo027.htm#018);
compare [Exo 26:16](../kjv/exo026.htm#016)). These hangings were
fastened to pillars. (4.) Heb. bottim ([Kg2
23:7](../kjv/kg2023.htm#007)), "hangings for the grove" (R.V., "for the
Asherah"); marg., instead of "hangings," has "tents" or "houses." Such
curtained structures for idolatrous worship are also alluded to in [Eze
16:16](../kjv/eze016.htm#016).

<span id="002">**Hannah**</span> Favour, grace, one of the wives of
Elkanah the Levite, and the mother of Samuel (1 Sam. 1; 2). Her home was
at Ramathaim-zophim, whence she was wont every year to go to Shiloh,
where the tabernacle had been pitched by Joshua, to attend the offering
of sacrifices there according to the law ([Exo
23:15](../kjv/exo023.htm#015); [Exo 34:18](../kjv/exo034.htm#018); [Deu
16:16](../kjv/deu016.htm#016)), probably at the feast of the Passover
(compare [Exo 13:10](../kjv/exo013.htm#010)). On occasion of one of
these "yearly" visits, being grieved by reason of Peninnah's conduct
toward her, she went forth alone, and kneeling before the Lord at the
sanctuary she prayed inaudibly. Eli the high priest, who sat at the
entrance to the holy place, observed her, and misunderstanding her
character he harshly condemned her conduct ([Sa1
1:14](../kjv/sa1001.htm#014)). After hearing her explanation he
retracted his injurious charge and said to her, "Go in peace: and the
God of Israel grant thee thy petition." Perhaps the story of the wife of
Manoah was not unknown to her. Thereafter Elkanah and his family retired
to their quiet home, and there, before another Passover, Hannah gave
birth to a son, whom, in grateful memory of the Lord's goodness, she
called Samuel, i.e., "heard of God." After the child was weaned
(probably in his third year) she brought him to Shiloh into the house of
the Lord, and said to Eli the aged priest, "Oh my lord, I am the woman
that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed;
and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore I
also have granted him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he is granted to
the Lord" ([Sa1 1:27](../kjv/sa1001.htm#027), [Sa1
1:28](../kjv/sa1001.htm#028), R.V.). Her gladness of heart then found
vent in that remarkable prophetic song ([Sa1
2:1](../kjv/sa1002.htm#001); compare [Luk 1:46](../kjv/luk001.htm#046))
which contains the first designation of the Messiah under that name
([Sa1 2:10](../kjv/sa1002.htm#010), "Anointed" = "Messiah"). And so
Samuel and his parents parted. He was left at Shiloh to minister "before
the Lord." And each year, when they came up to Shiloh, Hannah brought to
her absent child "a little coat" (Heb. meil , a term used to denote the
"robe" of the ephod worn by the high priest, [Exo
28:31](../kjv/exo028.htm#031)), a priestly robe, a long upper tunic
([Ch1 15:27](../kjv/ch1015.htm#027)), in which to minister in the
tabernacle ([Sa1 2:19](../kjv/sa1002.htm#019); [Sa1
15:27](../kjv/sa1015.htm#027); [Job 2:12](../kjv/job002.htm#012)). "And
the child Samuel grew before the Lord." After Samuel, Hannah had three
sons and two daughters.

<span id="003">**Hanniel**</span> Grace of God. (1.) A chief of the
tribe of Manasseh ([Num 34:23](../kjv/num034.htm#023)). (2.) A chief of
the tribe of Asher ([Ch1 7:39](../kjv/ch1007.htm#039)).

<span id="004">**Hanun**</span> Graciously given. (1.) The son and
successor of Nahash, king of Moab. David's messengers, sent on an
embassy of condolence to him to Rabbah Ammon, his capital, were so
grossly insulted that he proclaimed war against Hanun. David's army,
under the command of Joab, forthwith crossed the Jordan, and gained a
complete victory over the Moabites and their allies ([Sa2
10:1](../kjv/sa2010.htm#001)) at Medeba (q.v.). (2.) [Neh
3:13](../kjv/neh003.htm#013). (3.) [Neh 3:30](../kjv/neh003.htm#030).

<span id="005">**Hara**</span> Mountainous land, a province of Assyria
([Ch1 5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026)), between the Tigris and the
Euphrates, along the banks of the Khabur, to which some of the Israelite
captives were carried. It has not been identified. Some think the word a
variation of Haran.

<span id="006">**Haradah**</span> Fright; fear, the twenty-fifth station
of the Israelites in their wanderings ([Num
33:24](../kjv/num033.htm#024)).

<span id="007">**Haran**</span> (1.) Heb. haran ; i.e., "mountaineer."
The eldest son of Terah, brother of Abraham and Nahor, and father of
Lot, Milcah, and Iscah. He died before his father ([Gen
11:27](../kjv/gen011.htm#027)), in Ur of the Chaldees. (2.) Heb. haran ,
i.e., "parched;" or probably from the Accadian charana, meaning "a
road." A celebrated city of Western Asia, now Harran, where Abram
remained, after he left Ur of the Chaldees, till his father Terah died
([Gen 11:31](../kjv/gen011.htm#031), [Gen
11:32](../kjv/gen011.htm#032)), when he continued his journey into the
land of Canaan. It is called "Charran" in the LXX. and in [Act
7:2](../kjv/act007.htm#002). It is called the "city of Nahor" ([Gen
24:10](../kjv/gen024.htm#010)), and Jacob resided here with Laban ([Gen
30:43](../kjv/gen030.htm#043)). It stood on the river Belik, an affluent
of the Euphrates, about 70 miles above where it joins that river in
Upper Mesopotamia or Padan-aram, and about 600 miles northwest of Ur in
a direct line. It was on the caravan route between the east and west. It
is afterwards mentioned among the towns taken by the king of Assyria
([Kg2 19:12](../kjv/kg2019.htm#012); [Isa
37:12](../kjv/isa037.htm#012)). It was known to the Greeks and Romans
under the name Carrhae. (3.) The son of Caleb of Judah ([Ch1
2:46](../kjv/ch1002.htm#046)) by his concubine Ephah.

<span id="008">**Harbona**</span> (a Persian word meaning "ass-driver"),
one of the seven eunuchs or chamberlains of king Ahasuerus ([Est
1:10](../kjv/est001.htm#010); [Est 7:9](../kjv/est007.htm#009)).

<span id="009">**Hare**</span> (Heb. 'arnebeth ) was prohibited as food
according to the Mosaic law ([Lev 11:6](../kjv/lev011.htm#006); [Deu
14:7](../kjv/deu014.htm#007)), "because he cheweth the cud, but divideth
not the hoof." The habit of this animal is to grind its teeth and move
its jaw as if it actually chewed the cud. But, like the coney (q.v.), it
is not a ruminant with four stomachs, but a rodent like the squirrel,
rat, etc. Moses speaks of it according to appearance. It is interdicted
because, though apparently chewing the cud, it did not divide the hoof.
There are two species in Syria, (1.) the Lepus Syriacus or Syrian hare,
which is like the English hare; and (2.) the Lepus Sinaiticus, or hare
of the desert. No rabbits are found in Syria.
