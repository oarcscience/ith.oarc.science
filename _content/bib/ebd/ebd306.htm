</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Ramah</B></A>      (1.) A city first mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/jos018.htm#025">Jos 18:25</A>, near Gibeah of Benjamin. It was fortified by Baasha, king of Israel (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1015.htm#017">Kg1 15:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2016.htm#001">Ch2 16:1</A>). Asa, king of Judah, employed Benhadad the Syrian king to drive Baasha from this city (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1015.htm#018">Kg1 15:18</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg1015.htm#020">Kg1 15:20</A>). Isaiah (<A HREF="../kjv/isa010.htm#029">Isa 10:29</A>) refers to it, and also Jeremiah, who was once a prisoner there among the other captives of Jerusalem when it was taken by Nebuchadnezzar (<A HREF="../kjv/jer039.htm#008">Jer 39:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer040.htm#001">Jer 40:1</A>). Rachel, whose tomb lies close to Bethlehem, is represented as weeping in Ramah (<A HREF="../kjv/jer031.htm#015">Jer 31:15</A>) for her slaughtered children. This prophecy is illustrated and fulfilled in the re-awakening of Rachel's grief at the slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem (<A HREF="../kjv/mat002.htm#018">Mat 2:18</A>). It is identified with the modern village of er-Ram, between Gibeon and Beeroth, about 5 miles due north of Jerusalem. (See SAMUEL.) (2.) A town identified with Rameh, on the border of Asher, about 13 miles south-east of Tyre, &quot;on a solitary hill in the midst of a basin of green fields&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#029">Jos 19:29</A>). (3.) One of the &quot;fenced cities&quot; of Naphtali (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#036">Jos 19:36</A>), on a mountain slope, about seven and a half miles west-south-west of Safed, and 15 miles west of the north end of the Sea of Galilee, the present large and well-built village of Rameh. (4.) The same as Ramathaim-zophim (q.v.), a town of Mount Ephraim (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1001.htm#001">Sa1 1:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1001.htm#019">Sa1 1:19</A>). (5.) The same as Ramoth-gilead (q.v.), <A HREF="../kjv/kg2008.htm#029">Kg2 8:29</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2022.htm#006">Ch2 22:6</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Ramathaim-zophim</B></A>     The two heights of the Zophites or of the watchers (only in <A HREF="../kjv/sa1001.htm#001">Sa1 1:1</A>), &quot;in the land of Zuph&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1009.htm#005">Sa1 9:5</A>). Ramathaim is another name for Ramah (4). One of the Levitical families descended from Kohath, that of Zuph or Zophai (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1006.htm#026">Ch1 6:26</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch1006.htm#035">Ch1 6:35</A>), had a district assigned to them in Ephraim, which from this circumstance was called &quot;the land of Zuph,&quot; and hence the name of the town, &quot;Zophim.&quot; It was the birth-place of Samuel and the seat of his authority (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#011">Sa1 2:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1007.htm#017">Sa1 7:17</A>). It is frequently mentioned in the history of that prophet and of David (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1015.htm#034">Sa1 15:34</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1016.htm#013">Sa1 16:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1019.htm#018">Sa1 19:18</A>). Here Samuel died and was buried (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1025.htm#001">Sa1 25:1</A>). This town has been identified with the modern Neby Samwil (&quot;the prophet Samuel&quot;), about 4 or 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem. But there is no certainty as to its precise locality. Some have supposed that it may be identical with Arimathea of the New Testament. (See MIZPAH). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Ramath-lehi</B></A>     Elevation of Lehi, or the jawbone height; i.e., the Ramah of Lehi (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg015.htm#015">Jdg 15:15</A>). The phrase &quot;in the jaw,&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/jdg015.htm#019">Jdg 15:19</A>, Authorized Version, is in the margin, also in the Revised Version, &quot;in Lehi.&quot; Here Samson slew a thousand Philistines with a jawbone. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Ramath-mizpeh</B></A>     The height of Mizpeh or of the watch-tower (<A HREF="../kjv/jos013.htm#026">Jos 13:26</A>), a place mentioned as one of the limits of Gad. There were two Mizpehs on the east of the Jordan. This was the Mizpeh where Jacob and Laban made a covenant, &quot;Mizpeh of Gilead,&quot; called also Galeed and Jegar-sahadutha. It has been identified with the modern es-Salt, where the roads from Jericho and from Shechem to Damascus unite, about 25 miles east of the Jordan and 13 south of the Jabbok. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Ramath of the South</B></A>     (Heb.  Ramathnegeb ). The Heb.  negeb  is the general designation for south or south-west of Judah. This was one of the towns of Simeon (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#008">Jos 19:8</A>). It is the same as &quot;south Ramoth&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1030.htm#027">Sa1 30:27</A>; R.V., &quot;Ramoth of the south&quot;). Its site is doubtful. Some have thought it another name for Baalath-beer.
