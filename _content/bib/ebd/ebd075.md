------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Cellar**</span> A subterranean vault ([Ch1
27:28](../kjv/ch1027.htm#028)), a storehouse. The word is also used to
denote the treasury of the temple ([Kg1 7:51](../kjv/kg1007.htm#051))
and of the king ([Kg1 14:26](../kjv/kg1014.htm#026)). The Hebrew word is
rendered "garner" in [Joe 1:17](../kjv/joe001.htm#017), and "armoury" in
[Jer 50:25](../kjv/jer050.htm#025).

<span id="001">**Cenchrea**</span> Millet, the eastern harbour of
Corinth, from which it was distant about 9 miles east, and the outlet
for its trade with the Asiatic shores of the Mediterranean. When Paul
returned from his second missionary journey to Syria, he sailed from
this port ([Act 18:18](../kjv/act018.htm#018)). In [Rom
16:1](../kjv/rom016.htm#001) he speaks as if there were at the time of
his writing that epistle an organized church there. The western harbour
of Corinth was Lechaeum, about a mile and a half from the city. It was
the channel of its trade with Italy and the west.

<span id="002">**Censer**</span> The vessel in which incense was
presented on "the golden altar" before the Lord in the temple ([Exo
30:1](../kjv/exo030.htm#001)). The priest filled the censer with live
coal from the sacred fire on the altar of burnt-offering, and having
carried it into the sanctuary, there threw upon the burning coals the
sweet incense ([Lev 16:12](../kjv/lev016.htm#012), [Lev
16:13](../kjv/lev016.htm#013)), which sent up a cloud of smoke, filling
the apartment with fragrance. The censers in daily use were of brass
([Num 16:39](../kjv/num016.htm#039)), and were designated by a different
Hebrew name, miktereth ([Ch2 26:19](../kjv/ch2026.htm#019); [Eze
8:11](../kjv/eze008.htm#011)): while those used on the day of Atonement
were of gold, and were denoted by a word (mahtah) meaning "something to
take fire with;" LXX. pureion = a fire-pan. Solomon prepared for the
temple censers of pure gold ([Kg1 7:50](../kjv/kg1007.htm#050); [Ch2
4:22](../kjv/ch2004.htm#022)). The angel in the Apocalypse is
represented with a golden censer ([Rev 8:3](../kjv/rev008.htm#003), [Rev
8:5](../kjv/rev008.htm#005)). Paul speaks of the golden censer as
belonging to the tabernacle ([Heb 9:4](../kjv/heb009.htm#004)). The
Greek word thumiaterion , here rendered "censer," may more appropriately
denote, as in the margin of Revised Version, "the altar of incense."
Paul does not here say that the thumiaterion was in the holiest, for it
was in the holy place, but that the holiest had it, i.e., that it
belonged to the holiest ([Kg1 6:22](../kjv/kg1006.htm#022)). It was
intimately connected with the high priest's service in the holiest. The
manner in which the censer is to be used is described in [Num
4:14](../kjv/num004.htm#014); [Lev 16:12](../kjv/lev016.htm#012).

<span id="003">**Census**</span> There are five instances of a census of
the Jewish people having been taken. (1.) In the fourth month after the
Exodus, when the people were encamped at Sinai. The number of men from
twenty years old and upward was then 603,550 ([Exo
38:26](../kjv/exo038.htm#026)). (2.) Another census was made just before
the entrance into Canaan, when the number was found to be 601,730,
showing thus a small decrease ([Num 26:51](../kjv/num026.htm#051)). (3.)
The next census was in the time of David, when the number, exclusive of
the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, was found to be 1,300,000 ([Sa2
24:9](../kjv/sa2024.htm#009); [Ch1 21:5](../kjv/ch1021.htm#005)). (4.)
Solomon made a census of the foreigners in the land, and found 153,600
ablebodied workmen ([Ch2 2:17](../kjv/ch2002.htm#017), [Ch2
2:18](../kjv/ch2002.htm#018)). (5.) After the return from Exile the
whole congregation of Israel was numbered,and found to amount to 42,360
([Ezr 2:64](../kjv/ezr002.htm#064)). A census was made by the Roman
government in the time of our Lord ([Luk 2:1](../kjv/luk002.htm#001)).
(See TAXING.)

<span id="004">**Centurion**</span> A Roman officer in command of a
hundred men ([Mar 15:39](../kjv/mar015.htm#039), [Mar
15:44](../kjv/mar015.htm#044), [Mar 15:45](../kjv/mar015.htm#045)).
Cornelius, the first Gentile convert, was a centurion ([Act
10:1](../kjv/act010.htm#001), [Act 10:22](../kjv/act010.htm#022)). Other
centurions are mentioned in [Mat 8:5](../kjv/mat008.htm#005), [Mat
8:8](../kjv/mat008.htm#008), [Mat 8:13](../kjv/mat008.htm#013); [Luk
7:2](../kjv/luk007.htm#002), [Luk 7:6](../kjv/luk007.htm#006); [Act
21:32](../kjv/act021.htm#032); [Act 22:25](../kjv/act022.htm#025), [Act
22:26](../kjv/act022.htm#026); [Act 23:17](../kjv/act023.htm#017), [Act
23:23](../kjv/act023.htm#023); [Act 24:23](../kjv/act024.htm#023); [Act
27:1](../kjv/act027.htm#001), [Act 27:6](../kjv/act027.htm#006), [Act
27:11](../kjv/act027.htm#011), [Act 27:31](../kjv/act027.htm#031), [Act
27:43](../kjv/act027.htm#043); [Act 28:16](../kjv/act028.htm#016). A
centurion watched the crucifixion of our Lord ([Mat
27:54](../kjv/mat027.htm#054); [Luk 23:47](../kjv/luk023.htm#047)), and
when he saw the wonders attending it, exclaimed, "Truly this man was the
Son of God." "The centurions mentioned in the New Testament are
uniformly spoken of in terms of praise, whether in the Gospels or in the
Acts. It is interesting to compare this with the statement of Polybius
(vi. 24), that the centurions were chosen by merit, and so were men
remarkable not so much for their daring courage as for their
deliberation, constancy, and strength of mind.", Dr. Maclear's N. T.
Hist.

<span id="005">**Cephas**</span> A Syriac surname given by Christ to
Simon ([Joh 1:42](../kjv/joh001.htm#042)), meaning "rock." The Greeks
translated it by Petros, and the Latins by Petrus.

<span id="006">**Cesarea**</span> See CAESAREA.

<span id="007">**Chaff**</span> The refuse of winnowed corn. It was
usually burned ([Exo 15:7](../kjv/exo015.htm#007); [Isa
5:24](../kjv/isa005.htm#024); [Mat 3:12](../kjv/mat003.htm#012)). This
word sometimes, however, means dried grass or hay ([Isa
5:24](../kjv/isa005.htm#024); [Isa 33:11](../kjv/isa033.htm#011)). Chaff
is used as a figure of abortive wickedness ([Psa
1:4](../kjv/psa001.htm#004); [Mat 3:12](../kjv/mat003.htm#012)). False
doctrines are also called chaff ([Jer 23:28](../kjv/jer023.htm#028)), or
more correctly rendered "chopped straw." The destruction of the wicked,
and their powerlessness, are likened to the carrying away of chaff by
the wind ([Isa 17:13](../kjv/isa017.htm#013); [Hos
13:3](../kjv/hos013.htm#003); [Zep 2:2](../kjv/zep002.htm#002)).

<span id="008">**Chain**</span> (1.) A part of the insignia of office. A
chain of gold was placed about Joseph's neck ([Gen
41:42](../kjv/gen041.htm#042)); and one was promised to Daniel ([Dan
5:7](../kjv/dan005.htm#007)). It is used as a symbol of sovereignty
([Eze 16:11](../kjv/eze016.htm#011)). The breast-plate of the
high-priest was fastened to the ephod by golden chains ([Exo
39:17](../kjv/exo039.htm#017), [Exo 39:21](../kjv/exo039.htm#021)). (2.)
It was used as an ornament ([Pro 1:9](../kjv/pro001.htm#009); [Sol
1:10](../kjv/sol001.htm#010)). The Midianites adorned the necks of their
camels with chains ([Jdg 8:21](../kjv/jdg008.htm#021), [Jdg
8:26](../kjv/jdg008.htm#026)). (3.) Chains were also used as fetters
wherewith prisoners were bound ([Jdg 16:21](../kjv/jdg016.htm#021); [Sa2
3:34](../kjv/sa2003.htm#034); [Kg2 25:7](../kjv/kg2025.htm#007); [Jer
39:7](../kjv/jer039.htm#007)). Paul was in this manner bound to a Roman
soldier (Acts 28; 20; [Eph 6:20](../kjv/eph006.htm#020); [Ti2
1:16](../kjv/ti2001.htm#016)). Sometimes, for the sake of greater
security, the prisoner was attached by two chains to two soldiers, as in
the case of Peter ([Act 12:6](../kjv/act012.htm#006)).

<span id="009">**Chalcedony**</span> Mentioned only in [Rev
21:19](../kjv/rev021.htm#019), as one of the precious stones in the
foundation of the New Jerusalem. The name of this stone is derived from
Chalcedon, where it is said to have been first discovered. In modern
mineralogy this is the name of an agate-like quartz of a bluish colour.
Pliny so names the Indian ruby. The mineral intended in Revelation is
probably the Hebrew nophekh, translated "emerald" ([Exo
28:18](../kjv/exo028.htm#018); [Exo 39:11](../kjv/exo039.htm#011); [Eze
27:16](../kjv/eze027.htm#016); [Eze 28:13](../kjv/eze028.htm#013)). It
is rendered "anthrax" in the LXX., and "carbunculus" in the Vulgate.
(See CARBUNCLE.)
