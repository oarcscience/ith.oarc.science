Metaphorically of Babylon (<A HREF="../kjv/jer050.htm#023">Jer 50:23</A>) or Nebuchadnezzar. (2.) Heb.  makabah , a stone-cutter's mallet (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1006.htm#007">Kg1 6:7</A>), or of any workman (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg004.htm#021">Jdg 4:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa044.htm#012">Isa 44:12</A>).

(4.) Heb.  mappets , rendered &quot;battle-ax&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/jer051.htm#020">Jer 51:20</A>. This was properly a &quot;mace,&quot; which is thus described by Rawlinson: &quot;The Assyrian mace was a short, thin weapon, and must either have been made of a very tough wood or (and this is more probable) of metal. It had an ornamented head, which was sometimes very beautifully modeled, and generally a strap or string at the lower end by which it could be grasped with greater firmness.&quot;
