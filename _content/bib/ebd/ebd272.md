------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Neziah**</span> Victory; pure, [Ezr
2:54](../kjv/ezr002.htm#054); [Neh 7:56](../kjv/neh007.htm#056).

<span id="001">**Nezib**</span> A town in the "plain" of Judah. It has
been identified with Beit Nuzib, about 14 miles south-west of Jerusalem,
in the Wady Sur ([Jos 15:43](../kjv/jos015.htm#043)).

<span id="002">**Nibhaz**</span> Barker, the name of an idol, supposed
to be an evil demon of the Zabians. It was set up in Samaria by the
Avites ([Kg2 17:31](../kjv/kg2017.htm#031)), probably in the form of a
dog.

<span id="003">**Nibshan**</span> Fertile; light soil, a city somewhere
"in the wilderness" of Judah ([Jos 15:62](../kjv/jos015.htm#062)),
probably near Engedi.

<span id="004">**Nicanor**</span> Conqueror, one of the seven deacons
appointed in the apostolic Church ([Act 6:1](../kjv/act006.htm#001)).
Nothing further is known of him.

<span id="005">**Nicodemus**</span> The people is victor, a Pharisee and
a member of the Sanhedrin. He is first noticed as visiting Jesus by
night (John 3:1-21) for the purpose of learning more of his doctrines,
which our Lord then unfolded to him, giving prominence to the necessity
of being "born again." He is next met with in the Sanhedrin ([Joh
7:50](../kjv/joh007.htm#050)), where he protested against the course
they were taking in plotting against Christ. Once more he is mentioned
as taking part in the preparation for the anointing and burial of the
body of Christ ([Joh 19:39](../kjv/joh019.htm#039)). We hear nothing
more of him. There can be little doubt that he became a true disciple.

<span id="006">**Nicolaitanes**</span> The church at Ephesus ([Rev
2:6](../kjv/rev002.htm#006)) is commended for hating the "deeds" of the
Nicolaitanes, and the church of Pergamos is blamed for having them who
hold their "doctrines" ([Rev 2:15](../kjv/rev002.htm#015)). They were
seemingly a class of professing Christians, who sought to introduce into
the church a false freedom or licentiousness, thus abusing Paul's
doctrine of grace (Compare [Pe2 2:15](../kjv/pe2002.htm#015), [Pe2
2:16](../kjv/pe2002.htm#016), [Pe2 2:19](../kjv/pe2002.htm#019)), and
were probably identical with those who held the doctrine of Baalam
(q.v.), [Rev 2:14](../kjv/rev002.htm#014).

<span id="007">**Nicolas**</span> The victory of the people, a proselyte
of Antioch, one of the seven deacons ([Act 6:5](../kjv/act006.htm#005)).

<span id="008">**Nicopolis**</span> City of victory, where Paul intended
to winter ([Tit 3:12](../kjv/tit003.htm#012)). There were several cities
of this name. The one here referred to was most probably that in Epirus,
which was built by Augustus Caesar to commemorate his victory at the
battle of Actium (B.C. 31). It is the modern Paleoprevesa, i.e., "Old
Prevesa." The subscription to the epistle to Titus calls it "Nicopolis
of Macedonia", i.e., of Thrace. This is, however, probably incorrect.

<span id="009">**Niger**</span> Black, a surname of Simeon ([Act
13:1](../kjv/act013.htm#001)). He was probably so called from his dark
complexion.
