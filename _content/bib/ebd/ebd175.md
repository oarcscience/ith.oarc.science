<span id="000">**Herdsman**</span> In Egypt herdsmen were probably of
the lowest caste. Some of Joseph's brethren were made rulers over
Pharaoh's cattle ([Gen 47:6](../kjv/gen047.htm#006), [Gen
47:17](../kjv/gen047.htm#017)). The Israelites were known in Egypt as
"keepers of cattle;" and when they left it they took their flocks and
herds with them ([Exo 12:38](../kjv/exo012.htm#038)). Both David and
Saul came from "following the herd" to occupy the throne (1 Sam. 9; [Sa1
11:5](../kjv/sa1011.htm#005); [Psa 78:70](../kjv/psa078.htm#070)).
David's herd-masters were among his chief officers of state. The
daughters also of wealthy chiefs were wont to tend the flocks of the
family ([Gen 29:9](../kjv/gen029.htm#009); [Exo
2:16](../kjv/exo002.htm#016)). The "chief of the herdsmen" was in the
time of the monarchy an officer of high rank ([Sa1
21:7](../kjv/sa1021.htm#007); compare [Ch1
27:29](../kjv/ch1027.htm#029)). The herdsmen lived in tents ([Isa
38:12](../kjv/isa038.htm#012); [Jer 6:3](../kjv/jer006.htm#003)); and
there were folds for the cattle ([Num 32:16](../kjv/num032.htm#016)),
and watch-towers for the herdsmen, that he might therefrom observe any
coming danger ([Mic 4:8](../kjv/mic004.htm#008); [Nah
3:8](../kjv/nah003.htm#008)).

<span id="001">**Heres**</span> Sun. (1.) "Mount Heres" ([Jdg
1:35](../kjv/jdg001.htm#035)), Heb. Har-heres , i.e., "sun-mountain;"
probably identical with Irshemesh in [Jos 19:41](../kjv/jos019.htm#041).
(2.) [Isa 19:18](../kjv/isa019.htm#018), marg. (See On.)

<span id="002">**Heresy**</span> From a Greek word signifying (1.) a
choice, (2.) the opinion chosen, and (3.) the sect holding the opinion.
In the Acts of the Apostles ([Act 5:17](../kjv/act005.htm#017); [Act
15:5](../kjv/act015.htm#005); [Act 24:5](../kjv/act024.htm#005), [Act
24:14](../kjv/act024.htm#014); [Act 26:5](../kjv/act026.htm#005)) it
denotes a sect, without reference to its character. Elsewhere, however,
in the New Testament it has a different meaning attached to it. Paul
ranks "heresies" with crimes and seditions ([Gal
5:20](../kjv/gal005.htm#020)). This word also denotes divisions or
schisms in the church ([Co1 11:19](../kjv/co1011.htm#019)). In [Tit
3:10](../kjv/tit003.htm#010) a "heretical person" is one who follows his
own self-willed "questions," and who is to be avoided. Heresies thus
came to signify self-chosen doctrines not emanating from God ([Pe2
2:1](../kjv/pe2002.htm#001)).

<span id="003">**Hermas**</span> Mercury, a Roman Christian to whom Paul
sends greetings ([Rom 16:14](../kjv/rom016.htm#014)). Some suppose him
to have been the author of the celebrated religious romance called The
Shepherd, but it is very probable that that work is the production of a
later generation.

<span id="004">**Hermes**</span> Mercury, a Roman Christian ([Rom
16:14](../kjv/rom016.htm#014)).

<span id="005">**Hermogenes**</span> Mercury-born, at one time Paul's
fellow-labourer in Asia Minor, who, however, afterwards abandoned him,
along with one Phygellus, probably on account of the perils by which
they were beset ([Ti2 1:15](../kjv/ti2001.htm#015)).

<span id="006">**Hermon**</span> A peak, the eastern prolongation of the
Anti-Lebanon range, reaching to the height of about 9,200 feet above the
Mediterranean. It marks the north boundary of Palestine ([Deu
3:8](../kjv/deu003.htm#008), [Deu 4:48](../kjv/deu004.htm#048); [Jos
11:3](../kjv/jos011.htm#003), [Jos 11:17](../kjv/jos011.htm#017); [Jos
13:11](../kjv/jos013.htm#011); [Jos 12:1](../kjv/jos012.htm#001)), and
is seen from a great distance. It is about 40 miles north of the Sea of
Galilee. It is called "the Hermonites" ([Psa
42:6](../kjv/psa042.htm#006)) because it has more than one summit. The
Sidonians called it Sirion, and the Amorites Shenir ([Deu
3:9](../kjv/deu003.htm#009); [Sol 4:8](../kjv/sol004.htm#008)). It is
also called Baal-hermon ([Jdg 3:3](../kjv/jdg003.htm#003); [Ch1
5:23](../kjv/ch1005.htm#023)) and Sion ([Deu
4:48](../kjv/deu004.htm#048)). There is every probability that one of
its three summits was the scene of the transfiguration (q.v.). The "dew
of Hermon" is referred to ([Psa 89:12](../kjv/psa089.htm#012)). Its
modern name is Jebel-esh-Sheikh, "the chief mountain." It is one of the
most conspicuous mountains in Palestine or Syria. "In whatever part of
Palestine the Israelite turned his eye northward, Hermon was there,
terminating the view. From the plain along the coast, from the Jordan
valley, from the heights of Moab and Gilead, from the plateau of Bashan,
the pale, blue, snow-capped cone forms the one feature in the northern
horizon." Our Lord and his disciples climbed this "high mountain apart"
one day, and remained on its summit all night, "weary after their long
and toilsome ascent." During the night "he was transfigured before them;
and his face did shine as the sun." The next day they descended to
Caesarea Philippi.

<span id="007">**Hermonites, The**</span> ([Psa
42:6](../kjv/psa042.htm#006), [Psa 42:7](../kjv/psa042.htm#007)) = "the
Hermons", i.e., the three peaks or summits of Hermon, which are about a
quarter of a mile apart.

<span id="008">**Herod the Great**</span> (Matt. 2:1-22; [Luk
1:5](../kjv/luk001.htm#005); [Act 23:35](../kjv/act023.htm#035)), the
son of Antipater, an Idumaean, and Cypros, an Arabian of noble descent.
In the year B.C. 47 Julius Caesar made Antipater, a "wily Idumaean,"
Procurator of Judea, who divided his territories between his four sons,
Galilee falling to the lot of Herod, who was afterwards appointed
tetrarch of Judea by Mark Antony (B.C. 40), and also king of Judea by
the Roman senate. He was of a stern and cruel disposition. "He was
brutish and a stranger to all humanity." Alarmed by the tidings of one
"born King of the Jews," he sent forth and "slew all the children that
were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and
under" ([Mat 2:16](../kjv/mat002.htm#016)). He was fond of splendour,
and lavished great sums in rebuilding and adorning the cities of his
empire. He rebuilt the city of Caesarea (q.v.) on the coast, and also
the city of Samaria (q.v.), which he called Sebaste, in honour of
Augustus. He restored the ruined temple of Jerusalem, a work which was
begun B.C. 20, but was not finished till after Herod's death, probably
not till about A.D. 50 ([Joh 2:20](../kjv/joh002.htm#020)). After a
troubled reign of thirty-seven years, he died at Jericho amid great
agonies both of body and mind, B.C. 4, i.e., according to the common
chronology, in the year in which Jesus was born. After his death his
kingdom was divided among three of his sons. Of these, Philip had the
land east of Jordan, between Caesarea Philippi and Bethabara, Antipas
had Galilee and Peraea, while Archelaus had Judea and Samaria. See table
