<P><A NAME="006"><B>Jehoahaz</B></A>     Jehovah his sustainer, or he whom Jehovah holdeth.     (1.) The youngest son of Jehoram, king of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2021.htm#017">Ch2 21:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2022.htm#001">Ch2 22:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch2022.htm#006">Ch2 22:6</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch2022.htm#008">Ch2 22:8</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch2022.htm#009">Ch2 22:9</A>); usually Ahaziah (q.v.). (2.) The son and successor of Jehu, king of Israel (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2010.htm#035">Kg2 10:35</A>). He reigned seventeen years, and followed the evil ways of the house of Jeroboam. The Syrians, under Hazael and Benhadad, prevailed over him, but were at length driven out of the land by his son Jehoash (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2013.htm#001">Kg2 13:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg2013.htm#025">Kg2 13:25</A>).

</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Jehoash</B></A>     Jehovah-given.     (1.) The son of King Ahaziah. While yet an infant, he was saved from the general massacre of the family by his aunt Jehosheba, and was apparently the only surviving descendant of Solomon (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2021.htm#004">Ch2 21:4</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch2021.htm#017">Ch2 21:17</A>). His uncle, the high priest Jehoiada, brought him forth to public notice when he was eight years of age, and crowned and anointed him king of Judah with the usual ceremonies. Athaliah was taken by surprise when she heard the shout of the people, &quot;Long live the king;&quot; and when she appeared in the temple, Jehoiada commanded her to be led forth to death (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2011.htm#013">Kg2 11:13</A>). While the high priest lived, Jehoash favoured the worship of God and observed the law; but on his death he fell away into evil courses, and the land was defiled with idolatry. Zechariah, the son and successor of the high priest, was put to death. These evil deeds brought down on the land the judgment of God, and it was oppressed by the Syrian invaders. He is one of the three kings omitted by Matthew (<A HREF="../kjv/mat001.htm#008">Mat 1:8</A>) in the genealogy of Christ, the other two being Ahaziah and Amaziah. He was buried in the city of David (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2012.htm#021">Kg2 12:21</A>). (See JOASH [4].) (2.) The son and successor of Jehoahaz, king of Israel (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2014.htm#001">Kg2 14:1</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/kg2012.htm#001">Kg2 12:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2013.htm#010">Kg2 13:10</A>). When he ascended the throne the kingdom was suffering from the invasion of the Syrians. Hazael &quot;was cutting Israel short.&quot; He tolerated the worship of the golden calves, yet seems to have manifested a character of sincere devotion to the God of his fathers. He held the prophet Elisha in honour, and wept by his bedside when he was dying, addressing him in the words Elisha himself had used when Elijah was carried up into heaven: &quot;O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof.&quot; He was afterwards involved in war with Amaziah, the king of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2025.htm#023">Ch2 25:23</A>), whom he utterly defeated at Beth-shemesh, on the borders of Dan and Philistia, and advancing on Jerusalem, broke down a portion of the wall, and carried away the treasures of the temple and the palace. He soon after died (825 B.C.), and was buried in Samaria (2 Kings 14:1-17, <A HREF="../kjv/kg2014.htm#019">Kg2 14:19</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg2014.htm#020">Kg2 14:20</A>). He was succeeded by his son. (See JOASH [5.].)

<P><A NAME="008"><B>Jehohanan</B></A>     Jehovah-granted, Jeroboam II.     (1.) A Korhite, the head of one of the divisions of the temple porters (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1026.htm#003">Ch1 26:3</A>). (2.) One of Jehoshaphat's &quot;captains&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2017.htm#015">Ch2 17:15</A>). (3.) The father of Azariah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2028.htm#012">Ch2 28:12</A>). (4.) The son of Tobiah, an enemy of the Jews (<A HREF="../kjv/neh006.htm#018">Neh 6:18</A>). (5.) <A HREF="../kjv/neh012.htm#042">Neh 12:42</A>. (6.) <A HREF="../kjv/neh012.htm#013">Neh 12:13</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Jehoiada</B></A>     Jehovah-known.     (1.) The father of Benaiah, who was one of David's chief warriors (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2008.htm#018">Sa2 8:18</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa2020.htm#023">Sa2 20:23</A>). (2.) The high priest at the time of Athaliah's usurpation of the throne of Judah. He married Jehosheba, or Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2022.htm#011">Ch2 22:11</A>), and took an active part along with his wife in the preservation and training of Jehoash when Athaliah slew all the royal family of Judah.    The plans he adopted in replacing Jehoash on the throne of his ancestors are described in <A HREF="../kjv/kg2011.htm#002">Kg2 11:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2012.htm#002">Kg2 12:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2022.htm#011">Ch2 22:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2023.htm#002">Ch2 23:2</A>. He was among the foremost of the benefactors of the kingdom, and at his death was buried in the city of David among the kings of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2024.htm#015">Ch2 24:15</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch2024.htm#016">Ch2 24:16</A>). He is said to have been one hundred and thirty years old.
