------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Aijeleth Shahar**</span> Hind of the dawn, a name found
in the title of Ps. 22. It is probably the name of some song or tune to
the measure of which the psalm was to be chanted. Some, however,
understand by the name some instrument of music, or an allegorical
allusion to the subject of the psalm.

<span id="001">**Air**</span> The atmosphere, as opposed to the higher
regions of the sky ([Th1 4:17](../kjv/th1004.htm#017); [Rev
9:2](../kjv/rev009.htm#002); [Rev 16:17](../kjv/rev016.htm#017)). This
word occurs once as the rendering of the Hebrew ruah ([Job
41:16](../kjv/job041.htm#016)); elsewhere it is the rendering of
shamaiyim, usually translated "heavens." The expression "to speak into
the air" ([Co1 14:9](../kjv/co1014.htm#009)) is a proverb denoting to
speak in vain, as to "beat the air" ([Co1 9:26](../kjv/co1009.htm#026))
denotes to labour in vain.

<span id="002">**Ajalon**</span> And Aijalon, place of deer. (1.)A town
and valley originally assigned to the tribe of Dan, from which, however,
they could not drive the Amorites ([Jdg 1:35](../kjv/jdg001.htm#035)).
It was one of the Levitical cities given to the Kohathites ([Ch1
6:69](../kjv/ch1006.htm#069)). It was not far from Beth-shemesh ([Ch2
28:18](../kjv/ch2028.htm#018)). It was the boundary between the kingdoms
of Judah and Israel, and is frequently mentioned in Jewish history ([Ch2
11:10](../kjv/ch2011.htm#010); [Sa1 14:31](../kjv/sa1014.htm#031); [Ch1
8:13](../kjv/ch1008.htm#013)). With reference to the valley named after
the town, Joshua uttered the celebrated command, "Sun, stand thou still
on Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon" ([Jos
10:12](../kjv/jos010.htm#012)). It has been identified as the modern
Yalo, at the foot of the Beth-horon pass (q.v.). In the Tell Amarna
letters Adoni-zedek (q.v.) speaks of the destruction of the "city of
Ajalon" by the invaders, and describes himself as "afflicted, greatly
afflicted" by the calamities that had come on the land, urging the king
of Egypt to hasten to his help. (2.)A city in the tribe of Zebulun ([Jdg
12:12](../kjv/jdg012.htm#012)), the modern Jalun, three miles north of
Cabul.

<span id="003">**Akkub**</span> (Another form of Jacob) (1.) The head of
one of the families of Nethinim ([Ezr 2:45](../kjv/ezr002.htm#045)).
(2.)A Levite who kept the gate of the temple after the return from
Babylon ([Ch1 9:17](../kjv/ch1009.htm#017); [Ezr
2:42](../kjv/ezr002.htm#042); [Neh 7:45](../kjv/neh007.htm#045)). (3.)A
descendant of David ([Ch1 3:24](../kjv/ch1003.htm#024)).

<span id="004">**Akrabbim**</span> Scorpions, probably the general name
given to the ridge containing the pass between the south of the Dead Sea
and Zin, es-Sufah, by which there is an ascent to the level of the land
of Palestine. Scorpions are said to abound in this whole district, and
hence the name ([Num 34:4](../kjv/num034.htm#004)). It is called
"Maaleh-acrabbim" in [Jos 15:3](../kjv/jos015.htm#003), and "the ascent
of Akrabbim" in [Num 34:4](../kjv/num034.htm#004).

<span id="005">**Alabaster**</span> Occurs only in the New Testament in
connection with the box of "ointment of spikenard very precious," with
the contents of which a woman anointed the head of Jesus as he sat at
supper in the house of Simon the leper ([Mat
26:7](../kjv/mat026.htm#007); [Mar 14:3](../kjv/mar014.htm#003); [Luk
7:37](../kjv/luk007.htm#037)). These boxes were made from a stone found
near Alabastron in Egypt, and from this circumstance the Greeks gave
them the name of the city where they were made. The name was then given
to the stone of which they were made; and finally to all perfume
vessels, of whatever material they were formed. The woman "broke" the
vessel; i.e., she broke off, as was usually done, the long and narrow
neck so as to reach the contents. This stone resembles marble, but is
softer in its texture, and hence very easily wrought into boxes. Mark
says ([Mar 14:5](../kjv/mar014.htm#005)) that this box of ointment was
worth more than 300 pence, i.e., denarii, each of the value of
seven-pence half-penny of our money, and therefore worth about 10
pounds. But if we take the denarius as the day's wage of a laborer ([Mat
20:2](../kjv/mat020.htm#002)), say two shillings of our money, then the
whole would be worth about 30 pounds, so costly was Mary's offering.

<span id="006">**Alamoth**</span> Virgins, a musical term ([Ch1
15:20](../kjv/ch1015.htm#020)), denoting that the psalm which bears this
inscription ([Psa 46:1](../kjv/psa046.htm#001)) was to be sung by
soprano or female voices.

<span id="007">**Alarm**</span> A particular quivering sound of the
silver trumpets to give warning to the Hebrews on their journey through
the wilderness ([Num 10:5](../kjv/num010.htm#005), [Num
10:6](../kjv/num010.htm#006)), a call to arms, or a war-note ([Jer
4:19](../kjv/jer004.htm#019); [Jer 49:2](../kjv/jer049.htm#002); [Zep
1:16](../kjv/zep001.htm#016)).

<span id="008">**Alemeth**</span> Covering. (1.) One of the nine sons of
Becher, the son of Benjamin ([Ch1 7:8](../kjv/ch1007.htm#008)). (2.)One
of the sons of Jehoadah, or Jarah, son of Ahaz ([Ch1
8:36](../kjv/ch1008.htm#036)). (3.)A sacerdotal city of Benjamin ([Ch1
6:60](../kjv/ch1006.htm#060)), called also Almon ([Jos
21:18](../kjv/jos021.htm#018)), now Almit, a mile north-east of the
ancient Anathoth.

<span id="009">**Alexander**</span> Man-defender. (1.) A relative of
Annas the high priest, present when Peter and John were examined before
the Sanhedrim ([Act 4:6](../kjv/act004.htm#006)). (2.) A man whose
father, Simon the Cyrenian, bore the cross of Christ ([Mar
15:21](../kjv/mar015.htm#021)). (3.) A Jew of Ephesus who took a
prominent part in the uproar raised there by the preaching of Paul ([Act
19:33](../kjv/act019.htm#033)). The Jews put him forward to plead their
cause before the mob. It was probably intended that he should show that
he and the other Jews had no sympathy with Paul any more than the
Ephesians had. It is possible that this man was the same as the
following. (4.) A coppersmith who, with Hymenaeus and others,
promulgated certain heresies regarding the resurrection ([Ti1
1:19](../kjv/ti1001.htm#019); [Ti2 4:14](../kjv/ti2004.htm#014)), and
made shipwreck of faith and of a good conscience. Paul excommunicated
him ([Ti1 1:20](../kjv/ti1001.htm#020); compare [Co1
5:5](../kjv/co1005.htm#005)).
