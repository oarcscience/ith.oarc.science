<P><A NAME="005"><B>Seirath</B></A>     Woody district; shaggy, a place among the mountains of Ephraim, bordering on Benjamin, to which Ehud fled after he had assassinated Eglon at Jericho (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg003.htm#026">Jdg 3:26</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jdg003.htm#027">Jdg 3:27</A>).

<P><A NAME="006"><B>Sela</B></A>     =Selah, rock, the capital of Edom, situated in the great valley extending from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2014.htm#007">Kg2 14:7</A>). It was near Mount Hor, close by the desert of Zin. It is called &quot;the rock&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg001.htm#036">Jdg 1:36</A>). When Amaziah took it he called it Joktheel (q.v.)

It appears in later history and in the Vulgate Version under the name of Petra. &quot;The caravans from all ages, from the interior of Arabia and from the Gulf of Persia, from Hadramaut on the ocean, and even from Sabea or Yemen, appear to have pointed to Petra as a common centre; and from Petra the tide seems again to have branched out in every direction, to Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, through Arsinoe, Gaza, Tyre, Jerusalem, and Damascus, and by other routes, terminating at the Mediterranean.&quot; (See EDOM [2].)

Its meaning is doubtful. Some interpret it as meaning &quot;silence&quot; or &quot;pause;&quot; others, &quot;end,&quot; &quot;a louder strain,&quot; &quot;piano,&quot; etc. The LXX. render the word by daplasma i.e., &quot;a division.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Seleucia</B></A>     The sea-port of Antioch, near the mouth of the Orontes.

This city was built by Seleucus Nicator, the &quot;king of Syria.&quot; It is said of him that &quot;few princes have ever lived with so great a passion for the building of cities. He is reputed to have built in all nine Seleucias, sixteen Antiochs, and six Laodiceas.&quot; Seleucia became a city of great importance, and was made a &quot;free city&quot; by Pompey. It is now a small village, called el-Kalusi.
