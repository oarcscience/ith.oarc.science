<span id="000">**Field**</span> (Heb. sadeh ), a cultivated field, but
unenclosed. It is applied to any cultivated ground or pasture ([Gen
29:2](../kjv/gen029.htm#002); [Gen 31:4](../kjv/gen031.htm#004); [Gen
34:7](../kjv/gen034.htm#007)), or tillage ([Gen
37:7](../kjv/gen037.htm#007); [Gen 47:24](../kjv/gen047.htm#024)). It is
also applied to woodland ([Psa 132:6](../kjv/psa132.htm#006)) or
mountain top ([Jdg 9:32](../kjv/jdg009.htm#032), [Jdg
9:36](../kjv/jdg009.htm#036); [Sa2 1:21](../kjv/sa2001.htm#021)). It
denotes sometimes a cultivated region as opposed to the wilderness ([Gen
33:19](../kjv/gen033.htm#019); [Gen 36:35](../kjv/gen036.htm#035)).
Unwalled villages or scattered houses are spoken of as "in the fields"
([Deu 28:3](../kjv/deu028.htm#003), [Deu 28:16](../kjv/deu028.htm#016);
[Lev 25:31](../kjv/lev025.htm#031); [Mar 6:36](../kjv/mar006.htm#036),
[Mar 6:56](../kjv/mar006.htm#056)). The "open field" is a place remote
from a house ([Gen 4:8](../kjv/gen004.htm#008); [Lev
14:7](../kjv/lev014.htm#007), [Lev 14:53](../kjv/lev014.htm#053); [Lev
17:5](../kjv/lev017.htm#005)). Cultivated land of any extent was called
a field ([Gen 23:13](../kjv/gen023.htm#013), [Gen
23:17](../kjv/gen023.htm#017); [Gen 41:8](../kjv/gen041.htm#008); [Lev
27:16](../kjv/lev027.htm#016); [Rut 4:5](../kjv/rut004.htm#005); [Neh
12:29](../kjv/neh012.htm#029)).

<span id="001">**Fig**</span> First mentioned in [Gen
3:7](../kjv/gen003.htm#007). The fig-tree is mentioned ([Deu
8:8](../kjv/deu008.htm#008)) as one of the valuable products of
Palestine. It was a sign of peace and prosperity ([Kg1
4:25](../kjv/kg1004.htm#025); [Mic 4:4](../kjv/mic004.htm#004); [Zac
3:10](../kjv/zac003.htm#010)). Figs were used medicinally ([Kg2
20:7](../kjv/kg2020.htm#007)), and pressed together and formed into
"cakes" as articles of diet ([Sa1 30:12](../kjv/sa1030.htm#012); [Jer
24:2](../kjv/jer024.htm#002)). Our Lord's cursing the fig-tree near
Bethany ([Mar 11:13](../kjv/mar011.htm#013)) has occasioned much
perplexity from the circumstance, as mentioned by the evangelist, that
"the time of figs was not yet." The explanation of the words, however,
lies in the simple fact that the fruit of the fig-tree appears before
the leaves, and hence that if the tree produced leaves it ought also to
have had fruit. It ought to have had fruit if it had been true to its
"pretensions," in showing its leaves at this particular season. "This
tree, so to speak, vaunted itself to be in advance of all the other
trees, challenged the passer-by that he should come and refresh himself
with its fruit. Yet when the Lord accepted its challenge and drew near,
it proved to be but as the others, without fruit as they; for indeed, as
the evangelist observes, the time of figs had not yet arrived. Its
fault, if one may use the word, lay in its pretensions, in its making a
show to run before the rest when it did not so indeed" (Trench,
Miracles). The fig-tree of Palestine (Ficus carica) produces two and
sometimes three crops of figs in a year, (1.) the bikkurah, or
"early-ripe fig" ([Mic 7:1](../kjv/mic007.htm#001); [Isa
28:4](../kjv/isa028.htm#004); [Hos 9:10](../kjv/hos009.htm#010), R.V.),
which is ripe about the end of June, dropping off as soon as it is ripe
([Nah 3:12](../kjv/nah003.htm#012)); (2.) the kermus, or "summer fig,"
then begins to be formed, and is ripe about August; and (3.) the pag
(plural "green figs," [Sol 2:13](../kjv/sol002.htm#013); Gr. olynthos ,
[Rev 6:13](../kjv/rev006.htm#013), "the untimely fig"), or "winter fig,"
which ripens in sheltered spots in spring.

<span id="002">**Fillets**</span> Heb. hashukum , plur., joinings ([Exo
27:17](../kjv/exo027.htm#017); [Exo 38:17](../kjv/exo038.htm#017), [Exo
38:28](../kjv/exo038.htm#028)), the rods by which the tops of the
columns around the tabernacle court were joined together, and from which
the curtains were suspended ([Exo 27:10](../kjv/exo027.htm#010), [Exo
27:11](../kjv/exo027.htm#011); [Exo 36:38](../kjv/exo036.htm#038)). In
[Jer 52:21](../kjv/jer052.htm#021) the rendering of a different word,
hut, meaning a "thread," and designating a measuring-line of 12 cubits
in length for the circumference of the copper pillars of Solomon's
temple.

<span id="003">**Finer**</span> A worker in silver and gold ([Pro
25:4](../kjv/pro025.htm#004)). In [Jdg 17:4](../kjv/jdg017.htm#004) the
word (tsoreph) is rendered "founder," and in [Isa
41:7](../kjv/isa041.htm#007) "goldsmith."

<span id="004">**Fining Pot**</span> A crucible, melting-pot ([Pro
17:3](../kjv/pro017.htm#003); [Pro 27:21](../kjv/pro027.htm#021)).

<span id="005">**Fir**</span> The uniform rendering in the Authorized
Version (marg. R.V., "cypress") of berosh ([Sa2
6:5](../kjv/sa2006.htm#005); [Kg1 5:8](../kjv/kg1005.htm#008), [Kg1
5:10](../kjv/kg1005.htm#010); [Kg1 6:15](../kjv/kg1006.htm#015), [Kg1
6:34](../kjv/kg1006.htm#034); [Kg1 9:11](../kjv/kg1009.htm#011), etc.),
a lofty tree ([Isa 55:13](../kjv/isa055.htm#013)) growing on Lebanon
([Isa 37:24](../kjv/isa037.htm#024)). Its wood was used in making
musical instruments and doors of houses, and for ceilings ([Ch2
3:5](../kjv/ch2003.htm#005)), the decks of ships ([Eze
27:5](../kjv/eze027.htm#005)), floorings and spear-shafts ([Nah
2:3](../kjv/nah002.htm#003), R.V.). The true fir (abies) is not found in
Palestine, but the pine tree, of which there are four species, is
common. The precise kind of tree meant by the "green fir tree" ([Hos
14:8](../kjv/hos014.htm#008)) is uncertain. Some regard it as the
sherbin tree, a cypress resembling the cedar; others, the Aleppo or
maritime pine (Pinus halepensis), which resembles the Scotch fir; while
others think that the "stone-pine" (Pinus pinea) is probably meant. (See
PINE.)

<span id="006">**Fire**</span> (1.) For sacred purposes. The sacrifices
were consumed by fire ([Gen 8:20](../kjv/gen008.htm#020)). The
ever-burning fire on the altar was first kindled from heaven ([Lev
6:9](../kjv/lev006.htm#009), [Lev 6:13](../kjv/lev006.htm#013); [Lev
9:24](../kjv/lev009.htm#024)), and afterwards rekindled at the
dedication of Solomon's temple ([Ch2 7:1](../kjv/ch2007.htm#001), [Ch2
7:3](../kjv/ch2007.htm#003)). The expressions "fire from heaven" and
"fire of the Lord" generally denote lightning, but sometimes also the
fire of the altar was so called ([Exo 29:18](../kjv/exo029.htm#018);
[Lev 1:9](../kjv/lev001.htm#009); [Lev 2:3](../kjv/lev002.htm#003); [Lev
3:5](../kjv/lev003.htm#005), [Lev 3:9](../kjv/lev003.htm#009)). Fire for
a sacred purpose obtained otherwise than from the altar was called
"strange fire" ([Lev 10:1](../kjv/lev010.htm#001), [Lev
10:2](../kjv/lev010.htm#002); [Num 3:4](../kjv/num003.htm#004)). The
victims slain for sin offerings were afterwards consumed by fire outside
the camp ([Lev 4:12](../kjv/lev004.htm#012), [Lev
4:21](../kjv/lev004.htm#021); [Lev 6:30](../kjv/lev006.htm#030); [Lev
16:27](../kjv/lev016.htm#027); [Heb 13:11](../kjv/heb013.htm#011)). (2.)
For domestic purposes, such as baking, cooking, warmth, etc. ([Jer
36:22](../kjv/jer036.htm#022); [Mar 14:54](../kjv/mar014.htm#054); [Joh
18:18](../kjv/joh018.htm#018)). But on Sabbath no fire for any domestic
purpose was to be kindled ([Exo 35:3](../kjv/exo035.htm#003); [Num
15:32](../kjv/num015.htm#032)). (3.) Punishment of death by fire was
inflicted on such as were guilty of certain forms of unchastity and
incest ([Lev 20:14](../kjv/lev020.htm#014); [Lev
21:9](../kjv/lev021.htm#009)). The burning of captives in war was not
unknown among the Jews ([Sa2 12:31](../kjv/sa2012.htm#031); [Jer
29:22](../kjv/jer029.htm#022)). The bodies of infamous persons who were
executed were also sometimes burned ([Jos 7:25](../kjv/jos007.htm#025);
[Kg2 23:16](../kjv/kg2023.htm#016)). (4.) In war, fire was used in the
destruction of cities, as Jericho ([Jos 6:24](../kjv/jos006.htm#024)),
Ai ([Jos 8:19](../kjv/jos008.htm#019)), Hazor ([Jos
11:11](../kjv/jos011.htm#011)), Laish ([Jdg
18:27](../kjv/jdg018.htm#027)), etc. The war-chariots of the Canaanites
were burnt ([Jos 11:6](../kjv/jos011.htm#006), [Jos
11:9](../kjv/jos011.htm#009), [Jos 11:13](../kjv/jos011.htm#013)). The
Israelites burned the images ([Kg2 10:26](../kjv/kg2010.htm#026); R.V.,
"pillars") of the house of Baal. These objects of worship seem to have
been of the nature of obelisks, and were sometimes evidently made of
wood. Torches were sometimes carried by the soldiers in battle ([Jdg
7:16](../kjv/jdg007.htm#016)). (5.) Figuratively, fire is a symbol of
Jehovah's presence and the instrument of his power ([Exo
14:19](../kjv/exo014.htm#019); [Num 11:1](../kjv/num011.htm#001), [Num
11:3](../kjv/num011.htm#003); [Jdg 13:20](../kjv/jdg013.htm#020); [Kg1
18:38](../kjv/kg1018.htm#038); [Kg2 1:10](../kjv/kg2001.htm#010), [Kg2
1:12](../kjv/kg2001.htm#012); [Kg2 2:11](../kjv/kg2002.htm#011); [Isa
6:4](../kjv/isa006.htm#004); [Eze 1:4](../kjv/eze001.htm#004); [Rev
1:14](../kjv/rev001.htm#014), etc.). God's word is also likened unto
fire ([Jer 23:29](../kjv/jer023.htm#029)). It is referred to as an
emblem of severe trials or misfortunes ([Zac
12:6](../kjv/zac012.htm#006); [Luk 12:49](../kjv/luk012.htm#049); [Co1
3:13](../kjv/co1003.htm#013), [Co1 3:15](../kjv/co1003.htm#015); [Pe1
1:7](../kjv/pe1001.htm#007)), and of eternal punishment ([Mat
5:22](../kjv/mat005.htm#022); [Mar 9:44](../kjv/mar009.htm#044); [Rev
14:10](../kjv/rev014.htm#010); [Rev 21:8](../kjv/rev021.htm#008)). The
influence of the Holy Ghost is likened unto fire ([Mat
3:11](../kjv/mat003.htm#011)). His descent was denoted by the appearance
of tongues as of fire ([Act 2:3](../kjv/act002.htm#003)).

<span id="007">**Firebrand**</span> [Isa 7:4](../kjv/isa007.htm#004),
[Amo 4:11](../kjv/amo004.htm#011), [Zac 3:2](../kjv/zac003.htm#002),
denotes the burnt end of a stick (Heb. 'ud ); in [Jdg
15:4](../kjv/jdg015.htm#004), a lamp or torch, a flambeau (Heb. lappid);
in [Pro 26:18](../kjv/pro026.htm#018) (compare [Eph
6:16](../kjv/eph006.htm#016)), burning darts or arrows (Heb. zikkim).

<span id="008">**Firepan**</span> [Exo 27:3](../kjv/exo027.htm#003);
[Exo 38:3](../kjv/exo038.htm#003)), one of the vessels of the temple
service (rendered "snuff-dish" [Exo 25:38](../kjv/exo025.htm#038); [Exo
37:23](../kjv/exo037.htm#023); and "censer" [Lev
10:1](../kjv/lev010.htm#001); [Lev 16:12](../kjv/lev016.htm#012)). It
was probably a metallic cinder-basin used for the purpose of carrying
live coal for burning incense, and of carrying away the snuff in
trimming the lamps.

<span id="009">**Firkin**</span> Used only in [Joh
2:6](../kjv/joh002.htm#006); the Attic amphora, equivalent to the Hebrew
bath (q.v.), a measure for liquids containing about 8 7/8 gallons.
