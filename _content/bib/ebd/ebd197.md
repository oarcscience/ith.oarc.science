<span id="000">**Janoah**</span> Or Janohah, rest. (1.) A town on the
north-eastern border of Ephraim, in the Jordan valley ([Jos
16:6](../kjv/jos016.htm#006), [Jos 16:7](../kjv/jos016.htm#007)).
Identified with the modern Yanun, 8 miles south-east of Nablus. (2.) A
town of Northern Palestine, within the boundaries of Naphtali. It was
taken by the king of Assyria ([Kg2 15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029)).

<span id="001">**Janum**</span> Slumber, a town in the mountains of
Judah ([Jos 15:53](../kjv/jos015.htm#053)).

<span id="002">**Japheth**</span> Wide spreading: "God shall enlarge
Japheth" (Heb. Yaphat Elohim le-Yephet , [Gen
9:27](../kjv/gen009.htm#027). Some, however, derive the name from
yaphah, "to be beautiful;" hence white), one of the sons of Noah,
mentioned last in order ([Gen 5:32](../kjv/gen005.htm#032); [Gen
6:10](../kjv/gen006.htm#010); [Gen 7:13](../kjv/gen007.htm#013)),
perhaps first by birth ([Gen 10:21](../kjv/gen010.htm#021); compare [Gen
9:24](../kjv/gen009.htm#024)). He and his wife were two of the eight
saved in the ark ([Pe1 3:20](../kjv/pe1003.htm#020)). He was the
progenitor of many tribes inhabiting the east of Europe and the north of
Asia ([Gen 10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002)). An act of filial piety ([Gen
9:20](../kjv/gen009.htm#020)) was the occasion of Noah's prophecy of the
extension of his posterity. See table of descendants: Descendants of
Japheth ([Gen 10:1](../kjv/gen010.htm#001)) Gomer Magog Madai Javan

Togarmah After the Flood the earth was re-peopled by the descendants of
Noah, "the sons of Japheth" ([Gen 10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002)), "the
sons of Ham" ([Gen 10:6](../kjv/gen010.htm#006)), and "the sons of Shem"
([Gen 10:22](../kjv/gen010.htm#022)). It is important to notice that
modern ethnological science, reasoning from a careful analysis of facts,
has arrived at the conclusion that there is a three-fold division of the
human family, corresponding in a remarkable way with the great
ethnological chapter of the book of Genesis (Gen. 10). The three great
races thus distinguished are called the Semitic, Aryan, and Turanian
(Allophylian). "Setting aside the cases where the ethnic names employed
are of doubtful application, it cannot reasonably be questioned that the
author \[of Gen. 10\] has in his account of the sons of Japheth classed
together the Cymry or Celts (Gomer), the Medes (Madai), and the Ionians
or Greeks (Javan), thereby anticipating what has become known in modern
times as the 'Indo-European Theory,' or the essential unity of the Aryan
(Asiatic) race with the principal races of Europe, indicated by the
Celts and the Ionians. Nor can it be doubted that he has thrown together
under the one head of 'children of Shem' the Assyrians (Asshur), the
Syrians (Aram), the Hebrews (Eber), and the Joktanian Arabs (Joktan),
four of the principal races which modern ethnology recognizes under the
heading of 'Semitic.' Again, under the heading of 'sons of Ham,' the
author has arranged 'Cush', i.e., the Ethiopians; 'Mizraim,' the people
of Egypt; 'Sheba and Dedan,' or certain of the Southern Arabs; and
'Nimrod,' or the ancient people of Babylon, four races between which the
latest linguistic researches have established a close affinity"
(Rawlinson's Hist. Illustrations).

<span id="003">**Japhia**</span> Splendid. (1.) The king of Lachish, who
joined in the confederacy against Joshua ([Jos
10:3](../kjv/jos010.htm#003)), and was defeated and slain. In one of the
Amarna tablets he speaks of himself as king of Gezer. Called also Horam
([Jos 10:33](../kjv/jos010.htm#033)). (2.) One of the sons of David
([Sa2 5:15](../kjv/sa2005.htm#015)), born in Jerusalem. (3.) A town in
the southern boundary of Zebulum ([Jos 19:12](../kjv/jos019.htm#012));
now Yafa, 2 miles south-west of Nazareth.

<span id="004">**Japho**</span> Beauty, a sea-port in Dan ([Jos
19:46](../kjv/jos019.htm#046)); called Joppa (q.v.) in [Ch2
2:16](../kjv/ch2002.htm#016); [Ezr 3:7](../kjv/ezr003.htm#007); [Jon
1:3](../kjv/jon001.htm#003); and in New Testament.

<span id="005">**Jared**</span> Descent. (1.) The fourth antediluvian
patriarch in descent from Seth ([Gen 5:15](../kjv/gen005.htm#015); [Luk
3:37](../kjv/luk003.htm#037)), the father of Enoch; called Jered in [Ch1
1:2](../kjv/ch1001.htm#002). (2.) A son of Ezra probably ([Ch1
4:18](../kjv/ch1004.htm#018)).

<span id="006">**Jarib**</span> An adversary. (1.) A son of Simeon ([Ch1
4:24](../kjv/ch1004.htm#024)). (2.) One of the chiefs sent by Ezra to
bring up the priests to Jerusalem ([Ezr 8:16](../kjv/ezr008.htm#016)).
(3.) [Ezr 10:18](../kjv/ezr010.htm#018).

<span id="007">**Jarmuth**</span> Height. (1.) A town in the plain of
Judah ([Jos 15:35](../kjv/jos015.htm#035)), originally the residence of
one of the Canaanitish kings ([Jos 10:3](../kjv/jos010.htm#003), [Jos
10:5](../kjv/jos010.htm#005), [Jos 10:23](../kjv/jos010.htm#023)). It
has been identified with the modern Yarmuk, a village about 7 miles
north-east of Beit-Jibrin. (2.) A Levitical city of the tribe of
Issachar ([Jos 21:29](../kjv/jos021.htm#029)), supposed by some to be
the Ramah of Samuel ([Sa1 19:22](../kjv/sa1019.htm#022)).

<span id="008">**Jashen**</span> Sleeping, called also Hashem ([Ch1
11:34](../kjv/ch1011.htm#034)); a person, several of whose sons were in
David's body-guard ([Sa2 23:32](../kjv/sa2023.htm#032)).

<span id="009">**Jasher**</span> Upright. "The Book of Jasher," rendered
in the LXX. "the Book of the Upright One," by the Vulgate "the Book of
Just Ones," was probably a kind of national sacred song-book, a
collection of songs in praise of the heroes of Israel, a "book of golden
deeds," a national anthology. We have only two specimens from the book,
(1.) the words of Joshua which he spake to the Lord at the crisis of the
battle of Beth-horon ([Jos 10:12](../kjv/jos010.htm#012), [Jos
10:13](../kjv/jos010.htm#013)); and (2.) "the Song of the Bow," that
beautiful and touching mournful elegy which David composed on the
occasion of the death of Saul and Jonathan ([Sa2
1:18](../kjv/sa2001.htm#018)).
