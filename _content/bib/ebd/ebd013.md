<span id="000">**Ah!**</span> An exclamation of sorrow or regret ([Psa
35:25](../kjv/psa035.htm#025); [Isa 1:4](../kjv/isa001.htm#004), [Isa
1:24](../kjv/isa001.htm#024); [Jer 1:6](../kjv/jer001.htm#006); [Jer
22:18](../kjv/jer022.htm#018); [Mar 15:29](../kjv/mar015.htm#029)).

<span id="001">**Aha**</span> An exclamation of ridicule ([Psa
35:21](../kjv/psa035.htm#021); [Psa 40:15](../kjv/psa040.htm#015); [Psa
70:3](../kjv/psa070.htm#003)). In [Isa 44:16](../kjv/isa044.htm#016) it
signifies joyful surprise, as also in [Job
39:25](../kjv/job039.htm#025), R.V.

<span id="002">**Ahab**</span> Father's brother. (1.) The son of Omri,
whom he succeeded as the seventh king of Israel. His history is recorded
in 1 Kings 16-22. His wife was Jezebel (q.v.), who exercised a very evil
influence over him. To the calf-worship introduced by Jeroboam he added
the worship of Baal. He was severely admonished by Elijah (q.v.) for his
wickedness. His anger was on this account kindled against the prophet,
and he sought to kill him. He undertook three campaigns against
Ben-hadad II., king of Damascus. In the first two, which were defensive,
he gained a complete victory over Ben-hadad, who fell into his hands,
and was afterwards released on the condition of his restoring all the
cities of Israel he then held, and granting certain other concessions to
Ahab. After three years of peace, for some cause Ahab renewed war ([Kg1
22:3](../kjv/kg1022.htm#003)) with Ben-hadad by assaulting the city of
Ramoth-gilead, although the prophet Micaiah warned him that he would not
succeed, and that the 400 false prophets who encouraged him were only
leading him to his ruin. Micaiah was imprisoned for thus venturing to
dissuade Ahab from his purpose. Ahab went into the battle disguised,
that he might if possible escape the notice of his enemies; but an arrow
from a bow "drawn at a venture" pierced him, and though stayed up in his
chariot for a time he died towards evening, and Elijah's prophecy ([Kg1
21:19](../kjv/kg1021.htm#019)) was fulfilled. He reigned twenty-three
years. Because of his idolatry, lust, and covetousness, Ahab is referred
to as pre-eminently the type of a wicked king ([Kg2
8:18](../kjv/kg2008.htm#018); [Ch2 22:3](../kjv/ch2022.htm#003); [Mic
6:16](../kjv/mic006.htm#016)). (2.) A false prophet referred to by
Jeremiah ([Jer 29:21](../kjv/jer029.htm#021)), of whom nothing further
is known.

<span id="003">**Ahasuerus**</span> There are three kings designated by
this name in Scripture. (1.) The father of Darius the Mede, mentioned in
[Dan 9:1](../kjv/dan009.htm#001). This was probably the Cyaxares I.
known by this name in profane history, the king of Media and the
conqueror of Nineveh. (2.) The king mentioned in [Ezr
4:6](../kjv/ezr004.htm#006), probably the Cambyses of profane history,
the son and successor of Cyrus (529 B.C.). (3.) The son of Darius
Hystaspes, the king named in the Book of Esther. He ruled over the
kingdoms of Persia, Media, and Babylonia, "from India to Ethiopia." This
was in all probability the Xerxes of profane history, who succeeded his
father Darius (485 B.C.). In the LXX. version of the Book of Esther the
name Artaxerxes occurs for Ahasuerus. He reigned for twenty-one years
(486-465 B.C.). He invaded Greece with an army, it is said, of more than
2,000,000 soldiers, only 5,000 of whom returned with him. Leonidas, with
his famous 300, arrested his progress at the Pass of Thermopylae, and
then he was defeated disastrously by Themistocles at Salamis. It was
after his return from this invasion that Esther was chosen as his queen.

<span id="004">**Ahava**</span> Water, the river ([Ezr
8:21](../kjv/ezr008.htm#021)) by the banks of which the Jewish exiles
assembled under Ezra when about to return to Jerusalem from Babylon. In
all probability this was one of the streams of Mesopotamia which flowed
into the Euphrates somewhere in the north-west of Babylonia. It has,
however, been supposed to be the name of a place ([Ezr
8:15](../kjv/ezr008.htm#015)) now called Hit, on the Euphrates, east of
Damascus.

<span id="005">**Ahaz**</span> Possessor. (1.) A grandson of Jonathan
([Ch1 8:35](../kjv/ch1008.htm#035); [Ch1 9:42](../kjv/ch1009.htm#042)).
(2.) The son and successor of Jotham, king of Judah (2 Kings 16; Isa.
7-9; 2 Chr. 28). He gave himself up to a life of wickedness and
idolatry. Notwithstanding the remonstrances and warnings of Isaiah,
Hosea, and Micah, he appealed for help against Rezin, king of Damascus,
and Pekah, king of Israel, who threatened Jerusalem, to Tiglath-pileser,
the king of Assyria, to the great injury of his kingdom and his own
humiliating subjection to the Assyrians ([Kg2
16:7](../kjv/kg2016.htm#007), [Kg2 16:9](../kjv/kg2016.htm#009); [Kg2
15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029)). He also introduced among his people many
heathen and idolatrous customs ([Isa 8:19](../kjv/isa008.htm#019); [Isa
38:8](../kjv/isa038.htm#008); [Kg2 23:12](../kjv/kg2023.htm#012)). He
died at the age of thirty-five years, after reigning sixteen years
(740-724 B.C.), and was succeeded by his son Hezekiah. Because of his
wickedness he was "not brought into the sepulchre of the kings."

<span id="006">**Ahaziah**</span> Held by Jehovah. (1.) The son and
successor of Ahab. He followed the counsels of his mother Jezebel, and
imitated in wickedness the ways of his father. In his reign the Moabites
revolted from under his authority ([Kg2 3:5](../kjv/kg2003.htm#005)). He
united with Jehoshaphat in an attempt to revive maritime trade by the
Red Sea, which proved a failure ([Ch2 20:35](../kjv/ch2020.htm#035)).
His messengers, sent to consult the god of Ekron regarding his recovery
from the effects of a fall from the roof-gallery of his palace, were met
on the way by Elijah, who sent them back to tell the king that he would
never rise from his bed (1 Kings 22:51 - 2 Kings 1:18). (2.) The son of
Joram, or Jehoram, and sixth king of Judah. Called Jehoahaz ([Ch2
21:17](../kjv/ch2021.htm#017); [Ch2 25:23](../kjv/ch2025.htm#023)), and
Azariah ([Ch2 22:6](../kjv/ch2022.htm#006)). Guided by his idolatrous
mother Athaliah, his reign was disastrous ([Kg2
8:24](../kjv/kg2008.htm#024); [Kg2 9:29](../kjv/kg2009.htm#029)). He
joined his uncle Jehoram, king of Israel, in an expedition against
Hazael, king of Damascus; but was wounded at the pass of Gur when
attempting to escape, and had strength only to reach Megiddo, where he
died ([Kg2 9:22](../kjv/kg2009.htm#022)). He reigned only one year.

<span id="007">**Ahiam**</span> Mother's brother, one of David's thirty
heroes ([Sa2 23:33](../kjv/sa2023.htm#033); [Ch1
11:35](../kjv/ch1011.htm#035)).

<span id="008">**Ahiezer**</span> Brother of help; i.e., "helpful." (1.)
The chief of the tribe of Dan at the time of the Exodus ([Num
1:12](../kjv/num001.htm#012); [Num 2:25](../kjv/num002.htm#025); [Num
10:25](../kjv/num010.htm#025)). (2.) The chief of the Benjamite slingers
that repaired to David at Ziklag ([Ch1 12:3](../kjv/ch1012.htm#003)).

<span id="009">**Ahihud**</span> Brother (i.e., "friend") of union. (1.)
A son of Bela, the son of Benjamin ([Ch1 8:7](../kjv/ch1008.htm#007)).
(2.) Name different in Hebrew, meaning brother of Judah. Chief of the
tribe of Asher; one of those appointed by Moses to superintend the
division of Canaan among the tribe ([Num 34:27](../kjv/num034.htm#027)).
