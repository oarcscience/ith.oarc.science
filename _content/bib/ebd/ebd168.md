<span id="000">**Havoth-jair**</span> Hamlets of the enlightener a
district in the east of Jordan. (1.) Jair, the son of Manasseh, took
some villages of Gilead and called them by this name ([Num
32:41](../kjv/num032.htm#041)). (2.) Again, it is said that Jair "took
all the tract of Argob," and called it Bashanhavoth-jair ([Deu
3:14](../kjv/deu003.htm#014)). (See also [Jos
13:30](../kjv/jos013.htm#030); [Kg1 4:13](../kjv/kg1004.htm#013); [Ch1
2:22](../kjv/ch1002.htm#022), [Ch1 2:23](../kjv/ch1002.htm#023).)

<span id="001">**Hawk**</span> (Heb. netz , a word expressive of strong
and rapid flight, and hence appropriate to the hawk). It is an unclean
bird ([Lev 11:16](../kjv/lev011.htm#016); [Deu
14:15](../kjv/deu014.htm#015)). It is common in Syria and surrounding
countries. The Hebrew word includes various species of Falconidoe, with
special reference perhaps to the kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), the hobby
(Hypotriorchis subbuteo), and the lesser kestrel (Tin, Cenchris). The
kestrel remains all the year in Palestine, but some ten or twelve other
species are all migrants from the south. Of those summer visitors to
Palestine special mention may be made of the Falco sacer and the Falco
lanarius. (See NIGHT-HAWK.)

<span id="002">**Hay**</span> Properly so called, was not in use among
the Hebrews; straw was used instead. They cut the grass green as it was
needed. The word rendered "hay" in [Pro 27:25](../kjv/pro027.htm#025)
means the first shoots of the grass. In [Isa
15:6](../kjv/isa015.htm#006) the Revised Version has correctly "grass,"
where the Authorized Version has "hay."

<span id="003">**Hazael**</span> Whom God beholds, an officer of
Ben-hadad II., king of Syria, who ultimately came to the throne,
according to the word of the Lord to Elijah ([Kg1
19:15](../kjv/kg1019.htm#015)), after he had put the king to death ([Kg2
8:15](../kjv/kg2008.htm#015)), after he had put the king to death ([Kg2
8:15](../kjv/kg2008.htm#015)). His interview with Elisha is mentioned in
2 Kings 8. The Assyrians soon after his accession to the throne came
against him and defeated him with very great loss; and three years
afterwards again invaded Syria, but on this occasion Hazael submitted to
them. He then turned his arms against Israel, and ravaged "all the land
of Gilead," etc. ([Kg2 10:33](../kjv/kg2010.htm#033)), which he held in
a degree of subjection to him ([Kg2 13:3](../kjv/kg2013.htm#003), [Kg2
13:22](../kjv/kg2013.htm#022)). He aimed at the subjugation also of the
kingdom of Judah, when Joash obtained peace by giving him "all the gold
that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the
king's house" ([Kg2 12:18](../kjv/kg2012.htm#018); [Ch2
24:24](../kjv/ch2024.htm#024)). He reigned about forty-six years
(B.C.886-840), and was succeeded on the throne by his son Ben-hadad
([Kg2 13:22](../kjv/kg2013.htm#022)), who on several occasions was
defeated by Jehoash, the king of Israel, and compelled to restore all
the land of Israel his father had taken.

<span id="004">**Hazar-addar**</span> Village of Addar, a place in the
southern boundary of Palestine ([Num 34:4](../kjv/num034.htm#004)), in
the desert to the west of Kadesh-barnea. It is called Adar in [Jos
15:3](../kjv/jos015.htm#003).

<span id="005">**Hazar-enan**</span> Village of fountains, a place on
the north-east frontier of Palestine ([Num 34:9](../kjv/num034.htm#009),
[Num 34:10](../kjv/num034.htm#010)). Some have identified it with Ayan
ed-Dara in the heart of the central chain of Anti-Libanus. More
probably, however, it has been identified with Kuryetein, about 60 miles
east-north-east of Damascus. (Compare [Eze
47:17](../kjv/eze047.htm#017); [Eze 48:1](../kjv/eze048.htm#001).)

<span id="006">**Hazar-gaddah**</span> Village of fortune, a city on the
south border of Judah ([Jos 15:27](../kjv/jos015.htm#027)), midway
between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea.

<span id="007">**Hazar-hatticon**</span> Village of the midway a place
near Hamath in the confines of Hauran ([Eze
47:16](../kjv/eze047.htm#016)), probably on the north brow of Hermon.

<span id="008">**Hazar-maveth**</span> Court of death, the third son of
Joktan, and a region in Arabia-Felix settled by him ([Gen
10:26](../kjv/gen010.htm#026); [Ch1 1:20](../kjv/ch1001.htm#020)). It is
probably the modern province of Hadramaut, situated on the Indian Ocean
east of the modern Yemen.

<span id="009">**Hazar-shual**</span> Village or enclosure of the
jackal, a city on the south border of Judah ([Jos
15:28](../kjv/jos015.htm#028); [Neh 11:27](../kjv/neh011.htm#027)). It
has been identified with the ruins of Saweh, half-way between Beersheba
and Moladah.
