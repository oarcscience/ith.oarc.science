<span id="000">**Wine**</span> The common Hebrew word for wine is yayin,
from a root meaning "to boil up," "to be in a ferment." Others derive it
from a root meaning "to tread out," and hence the juice of the grape
trodden out. The Greek word for wine is oinos , and the Latin vinun .
But besides this common Hebrew word, there are several others which are
thus rendered. (1.) Ashishah ([Sa2 6:19](../kjv/sa2006.htm#019); [Ch1
16:3](../kjv/ch1016.htm#003); [Sol 2:5](../kjv/sol002.htm#005); [Hos
3:1](../kjv/hos003.htm#001)), which, however, rather denotes a solid
cake of pressed grapes, or, as in the Revised Version, a cake of
raisins. (2.) 'Asis , "sweet wine," or "new wine," the product of the
same year ([Sol 8:2](../kjv/sol008.htm#002); [Isa
49:26](../kjv/isa049.htm#026); [Joe 1:5](../kjv/joe001.htm#005); [Joe
3:18](../kjv/joe003.htm#018); [Amo 9:13](../kjv/amo009.htm#013)), from a
root meaning "to tread," hence juice trodden out or pressed out, thus
referring to the method by which the juice is obtained. The power of
intoxication is ascribed to it. (3.) Hometz . See VINEGAR. (4.) Hemer ,
[Deu 32:14](../kjv/deu032.htm#014) (rendered "blood of the grape") [Isa
27:2](../kjv/isa027.htm#002) ("red wine"), [Ezr
6:9](../kjv/ezr006.htm#009); [Ezr 7:22](../kjv/ezr007.htm#022); [Dan
5:1](../kjv/dan005.htm#001), [Dan 5:2](../kjv/dan005.htm#002), [Dan
5:4](../kjv/dan005.htm#004). This word conveys the idea of "foaming," as
in the process of fermentation, or when poured out. It is derived from
the root hamar, meaning "to boil up," and also "to be red," from the
idea of boiling or becoming inflamed. (5.) 'Enabh , a grape ([Deu
32:14](../kjv/deu032.htm#014)). The last clause of this verse should be
rendered as in the Revised Version, "and of the blood of the grape \[
'enabh \] thou drankest wine \[ hemcr \]." In [Hos
3:1](../kjv/hos003.htm#001) the phrase in Authorized Version, "flagons
of wine," is in the Revised Version correctly "cakes of raisins."
(Compare [Gen 49:11](../kjv/gen049.htm#011); [Num
6:3](../kjv/num006.htm#003); [Deu 23:24](../kjv/deu023.htm#024), etc.,
where this Hebrew word is rendered in the plural "grapes.") (6.) Mesekh
, properly a mixture of wine and water with spices that increase its
stimulating properties ([Isa 5:22](../kjv/isa005.htm#022)). [Psa
75:8](../kjv/psa075.htm#008), "The wine \[ yayin \] is red; it is full
of mixture \[ mesekh \];" [Pro 23:30](../kjv/pro023.htm#030), "mixed
wine;" [Isa 65:11](../kjv/isa065.htm#011), "drink offering" (R.V.,
"mingled wine"). (7.) Tirosh , properly "must," translated "wine" ([Deu
28:51](../kjv/deu028.htm#051)); "new wine" ([Pro
3:10](../kjv/pro003.htm#010)); "sweet wine" ([Mic
6:15](../kjv/mic006.htm#015); R.V., "vintage"). This Hebrew word has
been traced to a root meaning "to take possession of" and hence it is
supposed that tirosh is so designated because in intoxicating it takes
possession of the brain. Among the blessings promised to Esau ([Gen
27:28](../kjv/gen027.htm#028)) mention is made of "plenty of corn and
tirosh." Palestine is called "a land of corn and tirosh" ([Deu
33:28](../kjv/deu033.htm#028); compare [Isa
36:17](../kjv/isa036.htm#017)). See also [Deu
28:51](../kjv/deu028.htm#051); [Ch2 32:28](../kjv/ch2032.htm#028); [Joe
2:19](../kjv/joe002.htm#019); [Hos 4:11](../kjv/hos004.htm#011), ("wine
\[ yayin \] and new wine \[ tirosh \] take away the heart"). (8.) Sobhe
(root meaning "to drink to excess," "to suck up," "absorb"), found only
in [Isa 1:22](../kjv/isa001.htm#022), [Hos 4:18](../kjv/hos004.htm#018)
("their drink;" Gesen. and marg. of R.V., "their carouse"), and [Nah
1:10](../kjv/nah001.htm#010) ("drunken as drunkards;" lit., "soaked
according to their drink;" R.V., "drenched, as it were, in their drink",
i.e., according to their sobhe ). (9.) Shekar , "strong drink," any
intoxicating liquor; from a root meaning "to drink deeply," "to be
drunken", a generic term applied to all fermented liquors, however
obtained. [Num 28:7](../kjv/num028.htm#007), "strong wine" (R.V.,
"strong drink"). It is sometimes distinguished from wine, c.g., [Lev
10:9](../kjv/lev010.htm#009), "Do not drink wine \[ yayin \] nor strong
drink \[ shekar \];" [Num 6:3](../kjv/num006.htm#003); [Jdg
13:4](../kjv/jdg013.htm#004), [Jdg 13:7](../kjv/jdg013.htm#007); [Isa
28:7](../kjv/isa028.htm#007) (in all these places rendered "strong
drink"). Translated "strong drink" also in [Isa
5:11](../kjv/isa005.htm#011); [Isa 24:9](../kjv/isa024.htm#009); [Isa
29:9](../kjv/isa029.htm#009); [Isa 56:12](../kjv/isa056.htm#012); [Pro
20:1](../kjv/pro020.htm#001); [Pro 31:6](../kjv/pro031.htm#006); [Mic
2:11](../kjv/mic002.htm#011). (10.) Yekebh ([Deu
16:13](../kjv/deu016.htm#013), but in R.V. correctly "wine-press"), a
vat into which the new wine flowed from the press. [Joe
2:24](../kjv/joe002.htm#024), "their vats;" [Joe
3:13](../kjv/joe003.htm#013), "the fats;" [Pro
3:10](../kjv/pro003.htm#010), "Thy presses shall burst out with new wine
\[ tirosh \];" [Hag 2:16](../kjv/hag002.htm#016); [Jer
48:33](../kjv/jer048.htm#033), "wine-presses;" [Kg2
6:27](../kjv/kg2006.htm#027); [Job 24:11](../kjv/job024.htm#011). (11.)
Shemarim (only in plural), "less" or "dregs" of wine. In [Isa
25:6](../kjv/isa025.htm#006) it is rendered "wines on the lees", i.e.,
wine that has been kept on the lees, and therefore old wine. (12.) Mesek
, "a mixture," mixed or spiced wine, not diluted with water, but mixed
with drugs and spices to increase its strength, or, as some think,
mingled with the lees by being shaken ([Psa
75:8](../kjv/psa075.htm#008); [Pro 23:30](../kjv/pro023.htm#030)). In
[Act 2:13](../kjv/act002.htm#013) the word gleukos , rendered "new
wine," denotes properly "sweet wine." It must have been intoxicating. In
addition to wine the Hebrews also made use of what they called debash ,
which was obtained by boiling down must to one-half or one-third of its
original bulk. In [Gen 43:11](../kjv/gen043.htm#011) this word is
rendered "honey." It was a kind of syrup, and is called by the Arabs at
the present day dibs . This word occurs in the phrase "a land flowing
with milk and honey" (debash), [Exo 3:8](../kjv/exo003.htm#008), [Exo
3:17](../kjv/exo003.htm#017); [Exo 13:5](../kjv/exo013.htm#005); [Exo
33:3](../kjv/exo033.htm#003); [Lev 20:24](../kjv/lev020.htm#024); [Num
13:27](../kjv/num013.htm#027). (See HONEY.) Our Lord miraculously
supplied wine at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee ([Joh
2:1](../kjv/joh002.htm#001)). The Rechabites were forbidden the use of
wine (Jer. 35). The Nazarites also were to abstain from its use during
the period of their vow ([Num 6:1](../kjv/num006.htm#001)); and those
who were dedicated as Nazarites from their birth were perpetually to
abstain from it ([Jdg 13:4](../kjv/jdg013.htm#004), [Jdg
13:5](../kjv/jdg013.htm#005); [Luk 1:15](../kjv/luk001.htm#015); [Luk
7:33](../kjv/luk007.htm#033)). The priests, too, were forbidden the use
of wine and strong drink when engaged in their sacred functions ([Lev
10:1](../kjv/lev010.htm#001), [Lev 10:9](../kjv/lev010.htm#009)). "Wine
is little used now in the East, from the fact that Mohammedans are not
allowed to taste it, and very few of other creeds touch it. When it is
drunk, water is generally mixed with it, and this was the custom in the
days of Christ also. The people indeed are everywhere very sober in hot
climates; a drunken person, in fact, is never seen" (Geikie's Life of
Christ). The sin of drunkenness, however, must have been not uncommon in
the olden times, for it is mentioned either metaphorically or literally
more than seventy times in the Bible. A drink-offering of wine was
presented with the daily sacrifice ([Exo 29:40](../kjv/exo029.htm#040),
[Exo 29:41](../kjv/exo029.htm#041)), and also with the offering of the
first-fruits ([Lev 23:13](../kjv/lev023.htm#013)), and with various
other sacrifices ([Num 15:5](../kjv/num015.htm#005), [Num
15:7](../kjv/num015.htm#007), [Num 15:10](../kjv/num015.htm#010)). Wine
was used at the celebration of the Passover. And when the Lord's Supper
was instituted, the wine and the unleavened bread then on the paschal
table were by our Lord set apart as memorials of his body and blood.
Several emphatic warnings are given in the New Testament against excess
in the use of wine ([Luk 21:34](../kjv/luk021.htm#034); [Rom
13:13](../kjv/rom013.htm#013); [Eph 5:18](../kjv/eph005.htm#018); [Ti1
3:8](../kjv/ti1003.htm#008); [Tit 1:7](../kjv/tit001.htm#007)).

<span id="001">**Winefat**</span> ([Mar 12:1](../kjv/mar012.htm#001)).
The original word (hypolenion) so rendered occurs only here in the New
Testament. It properly denotes the trough or lake (lacus), as it was
called by the Romans, into which the juice of the grapes ran from the
trough above it. It is here used, however, of the whole apparatus. In
the parallel passage in [Mat 21:33](../kjv/mat021.htm#033) the Greek
word lenos is used. This properly denotes the upper one of the two vats.
(See WINE-PRESS.)

<span id="002">**Wine-press**</span> Consisted of two vats or
receptacles, (1.) a trough (Heb. gath , Gr. lenos ) into which the
grapes were thrown and where they were trodden upon and bruised ([Isa
16:10](../kjv/isa016.htm#010); [Lam 1:15](../kjv/lam001.htm#015); [Joe
3:13](../kjv/joe003.htm#013)); and (2.) a trough or vat (Heb. yekebh ,
Gr. hypolenion ) into which the juice ran from the trough above, the
gath ([Neh 13:15](../kjv/neh013.htm#015); [Job
24:11](../kjv/job024.htm#011); [Isa 63:2](../kjv/isa063.htm#002), [Isa
63:3](../kjv/isa063.htm#003); [Hag 2:16](../kjv/hag002.htm#016); [Joe
2:24](../kjv/joe002.htm#024)). Wine-presses are found in almost every
part of Palestine. They are "the only sure relics we have of the old
days of Israel before the Captivity. Between Hebron and Beersheba they
are found on all the hill slopes; they abound in southern Judea; they
are no less common in the many valleys of Carmel; and they are numerous
in Galilee." The "treading of the wine-press" is emblematic of divine
judgment ([Isa 63:2](../kjv/isa063.htm#002); [Lam
1:15](../kjv/lam001.htm#015); [Rev 14:19](../kjv/rev014.htm#019), [Rev
14:20](../kjv/rev014.htm#020)).

<span id="003">**Winnow**</span> Corn was winnowed, (1.) By being thrown
up by a shovel against the wind. As a rule this was done in the evening
or during the night, when the west wind from the sea was blowing, which
was a moderate breeze and fitted for the purpose. The north wind was too
strong, and the east wind came in gusts. (2.) By the use of a fan or
van, by which the chaff was blown away ([Rut
3:2](../kjv/rut003.htm#002); [Isa 30:24](../kjv/isa030.htm#024); [Jer
4:11](../kjv/jer004.htm#011), [Jer 4:12](../kjv/jer004.htm#012); [Mat
3:12](../kjv/mat003.htm#012)).

<span id="004">**Wise**</span> Or wisdom, a moral rather than an
intellectual quality. To be "foolish" is to be godless ([Psa
14:1](../kjv/psa014.htm#001); compare [Jdg
19:23](../kjv/jdg019.htm#023); [Sa2 13:13](../kjv/sa2013.htm#013)). True
wisdom is a gift from God to those who ask it (Job 28:12-28; [Pro
3:13](../kjv/pro003.htm#013); [Rom 1:22](../kjv/rom001.htm#022); [Rom
16:27](../kjv/rom016.htm#027); [Co1 1:17](../kjv/co1001.htm#017); [Co1
2:6](../kjv/co1002.htm#006); [Jam 1:5](../kjv/jam001.htm#005)). "Wisdom"
in [Pro 1:20](../kjv/pro001.htm#020); [Pro 8:1](../kjv/pro008.htm#001);
[Pro 9:1](../kjv/pro009.htm#001) may be regarded not as a mere
personification of the attribute of wisdom, but as a divine person,
"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God" ([Co1
1:24](../kjv/co1001.htm#024)). In [Mat 11:19](../kjv/mat011.htm#019) it
is the personified principle of wisdom that is meant.

<span id="005">**Wise Men**</span> Mentioned in [Dan
2:12](../kjv/dan002.htm#012) included three classes, (1.) astrologers,
(2.) Chaldeans, and (3.) soothsayers. The word in the original (hakamim)
probably means "medicine men. In Chaldea medicine was only a branch of
magic. The "wise men" of [Mat 2:7](../kjv/mat002.htm#007), who came from
the East to Jerusalem, were magi from Persia or Arabia.

<span id="006">**Witch**</span> Occurs only in [Exo
22:18](../kjv/exo022.htm#018), as the rendering of mekhashshepheh, the
feminine form of the word, meaning "enchantress" (R.V., "sorceress"),
and in [Deu 18:10](../kjv/deu018.htm#010), as the rendering of
mekhashshepheth, the masculine form of the word, meaning "enchanter."

<span id="007">**Witchcraft**</span> ([Sa1
15:23](../kjv/sa1015.htm#023); [Kg2 9:22](../kjv/kg2009.htm#022); [Ch2
33:6](../kjv/ch2033.htm#006); [Mic 5:12](../kjv/mic005.htm#012); [Nah
3:4](../kjv/nah003.htm#004); [Gal 5:20](../kjv/gal005.htm#020)). In the
popular sense of the word no mention is made either of witches or of
witchcraft in Scripture. The "witch of En-dor" (1 Sam. 28) was a
necromancer, i.e., one who feigned to hold converse with the dead. The
damsel with "a spirit of divination" ([Act
16:16](../kjv/act016.htm#016)) was possessed by an evil spirit, or, as
the words are literally rendered, "having a spirit, a pithon." The
reference is to the heathen god Apollo, who was regarded as the god of
prophecy.

<span id="008">**Witness**</span> More than one witness was required in
criminal cases ([Deu 17:6](../kjv/deu017.htm#006); [Deu
19:15](../kjv/deu019.htm#015)). They were the first to execute the
sentence on the condemned ([Deu 13:9](../kjv/deu013.htm#009); [Deu
17:7](../kjv/deu017.htm#007); [Kg1 21:13](../kjv/kg1021.htm#013); [Mat
27:1](../kjv/mat027.htm#001); [Act 7:57](../kjv/act007.htm#057), [Act
7:58](../kjv/act007.htm#058)). False witnesses were liable to punishment
([Deu 19:16](../kjv/deu019.htm#016)). It was also an offense to refuse
to bear witness ([Lev 5:1](../kjv/lev005.htm#001)).

<span id="009">**Witness of the Spirit**</span> ([Rom
8:16](../kjv/rom008.htm#016)), the consciousness of the gracious
operation of the Spirit on the mind, "a certitude of the Spirit's
presence and work continually asserted within us", manifested "in his
comforting us, his stirring us up to prayer, his reproof of our sins,
his drawing us to works of love, to bear testimony before the world,"
etc.
