<P><A NAME="002"><B>Zelophehad</B></A>     First-born, of the tribe of Manasseh, and of the family of Gilead; died in the wilderness. Having left no sons, his daughters, concerned lest their father's name should be &quot;done away from among his family,&quot; made an appeal to Moses, who, by divine direction, appointed it as &quot;a statute of judgment&quot; in Israel that daughters should inherit their father's portion when no sons were left (<A HREF="../kjv/num027.htm#001">Num 27:1</A>). But that the possession of Zelophehad might not pass away in the year of jubilee from the tribe to which he belonged, it was ordained by Moses that his daughters should not marry any one out of their father's tribe; and this afterwards became a general law (<A HREF="../kjv/num036.htm#001">Num 36:1</A>).

(d) The announcement of judgment on the heathen (<A HREF="../kjv/zep002.htm#004">Zep 2:4</A>). (e) The hopeless misery of Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/zep003.htm#001">Zep 3:1</A>). (f) The promise of salvation (<A HREF="../kjv/zep003.htm#008">Zep 3:8</A>).     (2.)

He, along with some other captive Jews, was put to death by the king of Babylon &quot;at Riblah in the land of Hamath&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2025.htm#021">Kg2 25:21</A>). (3.)
