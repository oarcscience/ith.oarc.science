<span id="000">**Locust**</span> There are ten Hebrew words used in
Scripture to signify locust. In the New Testament locusts are mentioned
as forming part of the food of John the Baptist ([Mat
3:4](../kjv/mat003.htm#004); [Mar 1:6](../kjv/mar001.htm#006)). By the
Mosaic law they were reckoned "clean," so that he could lawfully eat
them. The name also occurs in [Rev 9:3](../kjv/rev009.htm#003), [Rev
9:7](../kjv/rev009.htm#007), in allusion to this Oriental devastating
insect. Locusts belong to the class of Orthoptera, i.e.,
straight-winged. They are of many species. The ordinary Syrian locust
resembles the grasshopper, but is larger and more destructive. "The legs
and thighs of these insects are so powerful that they can leap to a
height of two hundred times the length of their bodies. When so raised
they spread their wings and fly so close together as to appear like one
compact moving mass." Locusts are prepared as food in various ways.
Sometimes they are pounded, and then mixed with flour and water, and
baked into cakes; "sometimes boiled, roasted, or stewed in butter, and
then eaten." They were eaten in a preserved state by the ancient
Assyrians. The devastations they make in Eastern lands are often very
appalling. The invasions of locusts are the heaviest calamities that can
befall a country. "Their numbers exceed computation: the hebrews called
them 'the countless,' and the Arabs knew them as 'the darkeners of the
sun.' Unable to guide their own flight, though capable of crossing large
spaces, they are at the mercy of the wind, which bears them as blind
instruments of Providence to the doomed region given over to them for
the time. Innumerable as the drops of water or the sands of the
seashore, their flight obscures the sun and casts a thick shadow on the
earth ([Exo 10:15](../kjv/exo010.htm#015); [Jdg
6:5](../kjv/jdg006.htm#005); [Jdg 7:12](../kjv/jdg007.htm#012); [Jer
46:23](../kjv/jer046.htm#023); [Joe 2:10](../kjv/joe002.htm#010)). It
seems indeed as if a great aerial mountain, many miles in breadth, were
advancing with a slow, unresting progress. Woe to the countries beneath
them if the wind fall and let them alight! They descend unnumbered as
flakes of snow and hide the ground. It may be 'like the garden of Eden
before them, but behind them is a desolate wilderness. At their approach
the people are in anguish; all faces lose their colour' ([Joe
2:6](../kjv/joe002.htm#006)). No walls can stop them; no ditches arrest
them; fires kindled in their path are forthwith extinguished by the
myriads of their dead, and the countless armies march on ([Joe
2:8](../kjv/joe002.htm#008), [Joe 2:9](../kjv/joe002.htm#009)). If a
door or a window be open, they enter and destroy everything of wood in
the house. Every terrace, court, and inner chamber is filled with them
in a moment. Such an awful visitation swept over Egypt (Ex. 10:1-19),
consuming before it every green thing, and stripping the trees, till the
land was bared of all signs of vegetation. A strong north-west wind from
the Mediterranean swept the locusts into the Red Sea." - Geikie's Hours,
etc., ii., 149.

<span id="001">**Lo-debar**</span> No pasture, ([Sa2
17:27](../kjv/sa2017.htm#027)), a town in Gilead not far from Mahanaim,
north of the Jabbok ([Sa2 9:4](../kjv/sa2009.htm#004), [Sa2
9:5](../kjv/sa2009.htm#005)). It is probably identical with Debir ([Jos
13:26](../kjv/jos013.htm#026)).

<span id="002">**Lodge**</span> A shed for a watchman in a garden ([Isa
1:8](../kjv/isa001.htm#008)). The Hebrew name melunah is rendered
"cottage" (q.v.) in [Isa 24:20](../kjv/isa024.htm#020). It also denotes
a hammock or hanging-bed.

<span id="003">**Log**</span> The smallest measure for liquids used by
the Hebrews ([Lev 14:10](../kjv/lev014.htm#010), [Lev
14:12](../kjv/lev014.htm#012), [Lev 14:15](../kjv/lev014.htm#015), [Lev
14:21](../kjv/lev014.htm#021), [Lev 14:24](../kjv/lev014.htm#024)),
called in the Vulgate sextarius. It is the Hebrew unit of measure of
capacity, and is equal to the contents of six ordinary hen's eggs = the
twelfth part of a him, or nearly a pint.

<span id="004">**Lois**</span> The maternal grandmother of Timothy. She
is commended by Paul for her faith ([Ti2 1:5](../kjv/ti2001.htm#005)).

<span id="005">**Loop**</span> A knotted "eye" of cord, corresponding to
the "taches" or knobs in the edges of the curtains of the tabernacle,
for joining them into a continuous circuit, fifty to a curtain ([Exo
26:4](../kjv/exo026.htm#004), [Exo 26:5](../kjv/exo026.htm#005), [Exo
26:10](../kjv/exo026.htm#010), [Exo 26:11](../kjv/exo026.htm#011)).

<span id="006">**Lord**</span> There are various Hebrew and Greek words
so rendered. (1.) Heb. Jehovah , has been rendered in the English Bible
Lord, printed in small capitals. This is the proper name of the God of
the Hebrews. The form "Jehovah" is retained only in [Exo
6:3](../kjv/exo006.htm#003); [Psa 83:18](../kjv/psa083.htm#018); [Isa
12:2](../kjv/isa012.htm#002); [Isa 26:4](../kjv/isa026.htm#004), both in
the Authorized and the Revised Version. (2.) Heb. 'adon , means one
possessed of absolute control. It denotes a master, as of slaves ([Gen
24:14](../kjv/gen024.htm#014), [Gen 24:27](../kjv/gen024.htm#027)), or a
ruler of his subjects ([Gen 45:8](../kjv/gen045.htm#008)), or a husband,
as lord of his wife ([Gen 18:12](../kjv/gen018.htm#012)).The old plural
form of this Hebrew word is 'adonai . From a superstitious reverence for
the name "Jehovah," the Jews, in reading their Scriptures, whenever that
name occurred, always pronounced it 'Adonai . (3.) Greek kurios , a
supreme master, etc. In the LXX. this is invariably used for "Jehovah"
and " 'Adonai ." (4.) Heb. ba'al , a master, as having domination. This
word is applied to human relations, as that of husband, to persons
skilled in some art or profession, and to heathen deities. "The men of
Shechem," literally "the baals of Shechem" ([Jdg
9:2](../kjv/jdg009.htm#002), [Jdg 9:3](../kjv/jdg009.htm#003)). These
were the Israelite inhabitants who had reduced the Canaanites to a
condition of vassalage ([Jos 16:10](../kjv/jos016.htm#010); [Jos
17:13](../kjv/jos017.htm#013)). (5.) Heb. seren , applied exclusively to
the "lords of the Philistines" ([Jdg 3:3](../kjv/jdg003.htm#003)). The
LXX. render it by satrapies. At this period the Philistines were not, as
at a later period ([Sa1 21:10](../kjv/sa1021.htm#010)), under a kingly
government. (See [Jos 13:3](../kjv/jos013.htm#003); [Sa1
6:18](../kjv/sa1006.htm#018).) There were five such lordships, viz.,
Gath, Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron.

<span id="007">**Lord's Day**</span> Only once, in [Rev
1:10](../kjv/rev001.htm#010), was in the early Christian ages used to
denote the first day of the week, which commemorated the Lord's
resurrection. There is every reason to conclude that John thus used the
name. (See SABBATH.)

<span id="008">**Lord's Prayer**</span> The name given to the only form
of prayer Christ taught his disciples ([Mat
6:9](../kjv/mat006.htm#009)). The closing doxology of the prayer is
omitted by Luke ([Luk 11:2](../kjv/luk011.htm#002)), also in the R.V. of
[Mat 6:13](../kjv/mat006.htm#013). This prayer contains no allusion to
the atonement of Christ, nor to the offices of the Holy Spirit. "All
Christian prayer is based on the Lord's Prayer, but its spirit is also
guided by that of His prayer in Gethsemane and of the prayer recorded
John 17. The Lord's Prayer is the comprehensive type of the simplest and
most universal prayer."

<span id="009">**Lord's Supper**</span> ([Co1
11:20](../kjv/co1011.htm#020)), called also "the Lord's table" ([Co1
10:21](../kjv/co1010.htm#021)), "communion," "cup of blessing" ([Co1
10:16](../kjv/co1010.htm#016)), and "breaking of bread" ([Act
2:42](../kjv/act002.htm#042)). In the early Church it was called also
"Eucharist," or giving of thanks (Compare [Mat
26:27](../kjv/mat026.htm#027)), and generally by the Latin Church
"mass," a name derived from the formula of dismission, Ite, missa est,
i.e., "Go, it is discharged." The account of the institution of this
ordinance is given in [Mat 26:26](../kjv/mat026.htm#026), [Mar
14:22](../kjv/mar014.htm#022), [Luk 22:19](../kjv/luk022.htm#019), [Luk
22:20](../kjv/luk022.htm#020), and [Co1 11:24](../kjv/co1011.htm#024).
It is not mentioned by John. It was designed, (1.) To commemorate the
death of Christ: "This do in remembrance of me." (2.) To signify, seal,
and apply to believers all the benefits of the new covenant. In this
ordinance Christ ratifies his promises to his people, and they on their
part solemnly consecrate themselves to him and to his entire service.
(3.) To be a badge of the Christian profession. (4.) To indicate and to
promote the communion of believers with Christ. (5.) To represent the
mutual communion of believers with each other. The elements used to
represent Christ's body and blood are bread and wine. The kind of bread,
whether leavened or unleavened, is not specified. Christ used unleavened
bread simply because it was at that moment on the paschal table. Wine,
and no other liquid, is to be used ([Mat 26:26](../kjv/mat026.htm#026)).
Believers "feed" on Christ's body and blood, (1.) not with the mouth in
any manner, but (2.) by the soul alone, and (3.) by faith, which is the
mouth or hand of the soul. This they do (4.) by the power of the Holy
Ghost. This "feeding" on Christ, however, takes place not in the Lord's
Supper alone, but whenever faith in him is exercised. This is a
permanent ordinance in the Church of Christ, and is to be observed "till
he come" again.
