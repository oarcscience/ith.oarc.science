<P><A NAME="000"><B>Hanes</B></A>     A place in Egypt mentioned only in <A HREF="../kjv/isa030.htm#004">Isa 30:4</A> in connection with a reproof given to the Jews for trusting in Egypt. It was considered the same as Tahpanhes, a fortified town on the eastern frontier, but has been also identified as Ahnas-el-Medeeneh, 70 miles from Cairo.

<P><A NAME="001"><B>Hanging</B></A>     (1.) As a punishment - a mark of infamy inflicted on the dead bodies of criminals (<A HREF="../kjv/deu021.htm#023">Deu 21:23</A>) rather than our modern mode of punishment. Criminals were first strangled and then hanged (<A HREF="../kjv/num025.htm#004">Num 25:4</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu021.htm#022">Deu 21:22</A>). (See <A HREF="../kjv/sa2021.htm#006">Sa2 21:6</A> for the practice of the Gibeonites.) (2.) As a curtain -        (a.) Heb.  masak ,        (1.) before the entrance to the court of the tabernacle (<A HREF="../kjv/exo035.htm#017">Exo 35:17</A>); (2.) before the door of the tabernacle (<A HREF="../kjv/exo026.htm#036">Exo 26:36</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo026.htm#037">Exo 26:37</A>); (3.) before the entrance to the most holy place, called &quot;the veil of the covering&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/exo035.htm#012">Exo 35:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo039.htm#034">Exo 39:34</A>), as the word properly means.     (3.) Heb.  kelaim , tapestry covering the walls of the tabernacle (<A HREF="../kjv/exo027.htm#009">Exo 27:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo035.htm#017">Exo 35:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num003.htm#026">Num 3:26</A>) to the half of the height of the wall (<A HREF="../kjv/exo027.htm#018">Exo 27:18</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/exo026.htm#016">Exo 26:16</A>). These hangings were fastened to pillars. (4.) Heb.  bottim  (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2023.htm#007">Kg2 23:7</A>), &quot;hangings for the grove&quot; (R.V., &quot;for the Asherah&quot;); marg., instead of &quot;hangings,&quot; has &quot;tents&quot; or &quot;houses.&quot; Such curtained structures for idolatrous worship are also alluded to in <A HREF="../kjv/eze016.htm#016">Eze 16:16</A>.

<P><A NAME="002"><B>Hannah</B></A>     Favour, grace, one of the wives of Elkanah the Levite, and the mother of Samuel (1 Sam. 1; 2). Her home was at Ramathaim-zophim, whence she was wont every year to go to Shiloh, where the tabernacle had been pitched by Joshua, to attend the offering of sacrifices there according to the law (<A HREF="../kjv/exo023.htm#015">Exo 23:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo034.htm#018">Exo 34:18</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu016.htm#016">Deu 16:16</A>), probably at the feast of the Passover (compare <A HREF="../kjv/exo013.htm#010">Exo 13:10</A>). On occasion of one of these &quot;yearly&quot; visits, being grieved by reason of Peninnah's conduct toward her, she went forth alone, and kneeling before the Lord at the sanctuary she prayed inaudibly. Eli the high priest, who sat at the entrance to the holy place, observed her, and misunderstanding her character he harshly condemned her conduct (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1001.htm#014">Sa1 1:14</A>). After hearing her explanation he retracted his injurious charge and said to her, &quot;Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition.&quot; Perhaps the story of the wife of Manoah was not unknown to her. Thereafter Elkanah and his family retired to their quiet home, and there, before another Passover, Hannah gave birth to a son, whom, in grateful memory of the Lord's goodness, she called Samuel, i.e., &quot;heard of God.&quot; After the child was weaned (probably in his third year) she brought him to Shiloh into the house of the Lord, and said to Eli the aged priest, &quot;Oh my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore I also have granted him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he is granted to the Lord&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1001.htm#027">Sa1 1:27</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1001.htm#028">Sa1 1:28</A>, R.V.). Her gladness of heart then found vent in that remarkable prophetic song (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#001">Sa1 2:1</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/luk001.htm#046">Luk 1:46</A>) which contains the first designation of the Messiah under that name (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#010">Sa1 2:10</A>, &quot;Anointed&quot; = &quot;Messiah&quot;). And so Samuel and his parents parted. He was left at Shiloh to minister &quot;before the Lord.&quot; And each year, when they came up to Shiloh, Hannah brought to her absent child &quot;a little coat&quot; (Heb.  meil , a term used to denote the &quot;robe&quot; of the ephod worn by the high priest, <A HREF="../kjv/exo028.htm#031">Exo 28:31</A>), a priestly robe, a long upper tunic (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1015.htm#027">Ch1 15:27</A>), in which to minister in the tabernacle (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#019">Sa1 2:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1015.htm#027">Sa1 15:27</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/job002.htm#012">Job 2:12</A>). &quot;And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.&quot; After Samuel, Hannah had three sons and two daughters.

<P><A NAME="003"><B>Hanniel</B></A>     Grace of God.     (1.) A chief of the tribe of Manasseh (<A HREF="../kjv/num034.htm#023">Num 34:23</A>). (2.) A chief of the tribe of Asher (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1007.htm#039">Ch1 7:39</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Hanun</B></A>     Graciously given.     (1.) The son and successor of Nahash, king of Moab. David's messengers, sent on an embassy of condolence to him to Rabbah Ammon, his capital, were so grossly insulted that he proclaimed war against Hanun. David's army, under the command of Joab, forthwith crossed the Jordan, and gained a complete victory over the Moabites and their allies (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2010.htm#001">Sa2 10:1</A>) at Medeba (q.v.). (2.) <A HREF="../kjv/neh003.htm#013">Neh 3:13</A>. (3.) <A HREF="../kjv/neh003.htm#030">Neh 3:30</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Hara</B></A>     Mountainous land, a province of Assyria (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1005.htm#026">Ch1 5:26</A>), between the Tigris and the Euphrates, along the banks of the Khabur, to which some of the Israelite captives were carried. It has not been identified. Some think the word a variation of Haran. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Haradah</B></A>     Fright; fear, the twenty-fifth station of the Israelites in their wanderings (<A HREF="../kjv/num033.htm#024">Num 33:24</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Haran</B></A>      (1.) Heb.  haran ; i.e., &quot;mountaineer.&quot; The eldest son of Terah, brother of Abraham and Nahor, and father of Lot, Milcah, and Iscah. He died before his father (<A HREF="../kjv/gen011.htm#027">Gen 11:27</A>), in Ur of the Chaldees. (2.) Heb.  haran , i.e., &quot;parched;&quot; or probably from the Accadian charana, meaning &quot;a road.&quot; A celebrated city of Western Asia, now Harran, where Abram remained, after he left Ur of the Chaldees, till his father Terah died (<A HREF="../kjv/gen011.htm#031">Gen 11:31</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen011.htm#032">Gen 11:32</A>), when he continued his journey into the land of Canaan. It is called &quot;Charran&quot; in the LXX. and in <A HREF="../kjv/act007.htm#002">Act 7:2</A>. It is called the &quot;city of Nahor&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/gen024.htm#010">Gen 24:10</A>), and Jacob resided here with Laban (<A HREF="../kjv/gen030.htm#043">Gen 30:43</A>). It stood on the river Belik, an affluent of the Euphrates, about 70 miles above where it joins that river in Upper Mesopotamia or Padan-aram, and about 600 miles northwest of Ur in a direct line. It was on the caravan route between the east and west. It is afterwards mentioned among the towns taken by the king of Assyria (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2019.htm#012">Kg2 19:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa037.htm#012">Isa 37:12</A>). It was known to the Greeks and Romans under the name Carrhae. (3.) The son of Caleb of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1002.htm#046">Ch1 2:46</A>) by his concubine Ephah. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Harbona</B></A>     (a Persian word meaning &quot;ass-driver&quot;), one of the seven eunuchs or chamberlains of king Ahasuerus (<A HREF="../kjv/est001.htm#010">Est 1:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/est007.htm#009">Est 7:9</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Hare</B></A>     (Heb.  'arnebeth ) was prohibited as food according to the Mosaic law (<A HREF="../kjv/lev011.htm#006">Lev 11:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu014.htm#007">Deu 14:7</A>), &quot;because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof.&quot; The habit of this animal is to grind its teeth and move its jaw as if it actually chewed the cud. But, like the coney (q.v.), it is not a ruminant with four stomachs, but a rodent like the squirrel, rat, etc. Moses speaks of it according to appearance. It is interdicted because, though apparently chewing the cud, it did not divide the hoof. There are two species in Syria,     (1.) the Lepus Syriacus or Syrian hare, which is like the English hare; and (2.) the Lepus Sinaiticus, or hare of the desert. No rabbits are found in Syria.
