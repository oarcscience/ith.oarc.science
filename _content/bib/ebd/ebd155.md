<span id="000">**Graving**</span> (1.) Heb. hatsabh . [Job
19:24](../kjv/job019.htm#024), rendered "graven," but generally means
hewn stone or wood, in quarry or forest. (2.) Heb. harush . [Jer
17:1](../kjv/jer017.htm#001), rendered "graven," and indicates generally
artistic work in metal, wood, and stone, effected by fine instruments.
(3.) Heb. haqaq . [Eze 4:1](../kjv/eze004.htm#001), engraving a plan or
map, rendered "pourtray;" [Job 19:23](../kjv/job019.htm#023), "written."
(4.) Heb. pasal points rather to the sculptor's or the carver's art
([Isa 30:22](../kjv/isa030.htm#022); [Isa 40:19](../kjv/isa040.htm#019);
[Isa 41:7](../kjv/isa041.htm#007); [Isa 44:12](../kjv/isa044.htm#012)).
(5.) Pathah refers to intaglio work, the cutting and engraving of
precious stones ([Exo 28:9](../kjv/exo028.htm#009), [Exo
28:21](../kjv/exo028.htm#021); [Zac 3:9](../kjv/zac003.htm#009); [Sol
1:10](../kjv/sol001.htm#010), [Sol 1:11](../kjv/sol001.htm#011)). (6.)
Heret . In [Exo 32:4](../kjv/exo032.htm#004) rendered "graving tool;"
and in [Isa 8:1](../kjv/isa008.htm#001), "a pen."

<span id="001">**Greaves**</span> Only in [Sa1
17:6](../kjv/sa1017.htm#006), a piece of defensive armour (q.v.)
reaching from the foot to the knee; from French greve, "the shin." They
were the Roman cothurni.

<span id="002">**Grecians**</span> Hellenists, Greek-Jews; Jews born in
a foreign country, and thus did not speak Hebrew ([Act
6:1](../kjv/act006.htm#001); [Act 9:29](../kjv/act009.htm#029)), nor
join in the Hebrew services of the Jews in Palestine, but had synagogues
of their own in Jerusalem. [Joe 3:6](../kjv/joe003.htm#006) = Greeks.

<span id="003">**Greece**</span> Originally consisted of the four
provinces of Macedonia, Epirus, Achaia, and Peleponnesus. In [Act
20:2](../kjv/act020.htm#002) it designates only the Roman province of
Macedonia. Greece was conquered by the Romans 146 B.C.. After passing
through various changes it was erected into an independent monarchy in
1831. Moses makes mention of Greece under the name of Javan ([Gen
10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002)); and this name does not again occur in the
Old Testament till the time of Joel ([Joe 3:6](../kjv/joe003.htm#006)).
Then the Greeks and Hebrews first came into contact in the Tyrian
slave-market. Prophetic notice is taken of Greece in [Dan
8:21](../kjv/dan008.htm#021). The cities of Greece were the special
scenes of the labours of the apostle Paul.

<span id="004">**Greek**</span> Found only in the New Testament, where a
distinction is observed between "Greek" and "Grecian" (q.v.). The former
is (1.) a Greek by race ([Act 16:1](../kjv/act016.htm#001); [Act
18:17](../kjv/act018.htm#017); [Rom 1:14](../kjv/rom001.htm#014)), or
(2.) a Gentile as opposed to a Jew ([Rom 2:9](../kjv/rom002.htm#009),
[Rom 2:10](../kjv/rom002.htm#010)). The latter, meaning properly "one
who speaks Greek," is a foreign Jew opposed to a home Jew who dwelt in
Palestine. The word "Grecians" in [Act 11:20](../kjv/act011.htm#020)
should be "Greeks," denoting the heathen Greeks of that city, as
rendered in the Revised Version according to the reading of the best
manuscripts ("Hellenes").

<span id="005">**Greyhound**</span> ([Pro
30:31](../kjv/pro030.htm#031)), the rendering of the Hebrew zarzir
mothnayim, meaning literally "girded as to the lions." Some (Gesen.;
R.V. marg.) render it "war-horse." The LXX. and Vulgate versions render
it "cock." It has been by some interpreters rendered also "stag" and
"warrior," as being girded about or panoplied, and "wrestler." The
greyhound, however, was evidently known in ancient times, as appears
from Egyptian monuments.

<span id="006">**Grind**</span> ([Exo 32:20](../kjv/exo032.htm#020);
[Deu 9:21](../kjv/deu009.htm#021); [Jdg 16:21](../kjv/jdg016.htm#021)),
to crush small (Heb. tahan ); to oppress the poor ([Isa
3:5](../kjv/isa003.htm#005)). The handmill was early used by the Hebrews
([Num 11:8](../kjv/num011.htm#008)). It consisted of two stones, the
upper ([Deu 24:6](../kjv/deu024.htm#006); [Sa2
11:21](../kjv/sa2011.htm#021)) being movable and slightly concave, the
lower being stationary. The grinders mentioned [Ecc
12:3](../kjv/ecc012.htm#003) are the teeth. (See MILL.)

<span id="007">**Grizzled**</span> Party-coloured, as goats ([Gen
31:10](../kjv/gen031.htm#010), [Gen 31:12](../kjv/gen031.htm#012)),
horses ([Zac 6:3](../kjv/zac006.htm#003), [Zac
6:6](../kjv/zac006.htm#006)).

<span id="008">**Grove**</span> (1.) Heb. 'asherah , properly a wooden
image, or a pillar representing Ashtoreth, a sensual Canaanitish
goddess, probably usually set up in a grove ([Kg2
21:7](../kjv/kg2021.htm#007); [Kg2 23:4](../kjv/kg2023.htm#004)). In the
Revised Version the word "Asherah" (q.v.) is introduced as a proper
noun, the name of the wooden symbol of a goddess, with the plurals
Asherim ([Exo 34:13](../kjv/exo034.htm#013)) and Asheroth ([Jdg
3:13](../kjv/jdg003.htm#013)). The LXX. have rendered asherah in [Ch2
15:16](../kjv/ch2015.htm#016) by "Astarte." The Vulgate has done this
also in [Jdg 3:7](../kjv/jdg003.htm#007). (2.) Heb. 'eshel ([Gen
21:33](../kjv/gen021.htm#033)). In [Sa1 22:6](../kjv/sa1022.htm#006) and
[Sa1 31:13](../kjv/sa1031.htm#013) the Authorized Version renders this
word by "tree." In all these passages the Revised Version renders by
"tamarisk tree." It has been identified with the Tamariscus orientalis,
five species of which are found in Palestine. (3.) The Heb. word 'elon ,
uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by "plain," properly
signifies a grove or plantation. In the Revised Version it is rendered,
pl., "oaks" ([Gen 13:18](../kjv/gen013.htm#018); [Gen
14:13](../kjv/gen014.htm#013); [Gen 18:1](../kjv/gen018.htm#001); [Gen
12:6](../kjv/gen012.htm#006); [Deu 11:30](../kjv/deu011.htm#030); [Jos
19:33](../kjv/jos019.htm#033)). In the earliest times groves are
mentioned in connection with religious worship. The heathen consecrated
groves to particular gods, and for this reason they were forbidden to
the Jews ([Jer 17:3](../kjv/jer017.htm#003); [Eze
20:28](../kjv/eze020.htm#028)).

<span id="009">**Guard**</span> (1.) Heb. tabbah (properly a "cook," and
in a secondary sense "executioner," because this office fell to the lot
of the cook in Eastern countries), the bodyguard of the kings of Egypt
([Gen 37:36](../kjv/gen037.htm#036)) and Babylon ([Kg2
25:8](../kjv/kg2025.htm#008); [Jer 40:1](../kjv/jer040.htm#001); [Dan
2:14](../kjv/dan002.htm#014)). (2.) Heb. rats , properly a "courier,"
one whose office was to run before the king's chariot ([Sa2
15:1](../kjv/sa2015.htm#001); [Kg1 1:5](../kjv/kg1001.htm#005)). The
couriers were also military guards ([Sa1 22:17](../kjv/sa1022.htm#017);
[Kg2 10:25](../kjv/kg2010.htm#025)). They were probably the same who
under David were called Pelethites ([Kg1 14:27](../kjv/kg1014.htm#027);
[Sa2 15:1](../kjv/sa2015.htm#001)). (3.) Heb. mishmereth , one who
watches ([Neh 4:22](../kjv/neh004.htm#022)), or a watch-station ([Neh
7:3](../kjv/neh007.htm#003); [Neh 12:9](../kjv/neh012.htm#009); [Job
7:12](../kjv/job007.htm#012)). In the New Testament ([Mar
6:27](../kjv/mar006.htm#027)) the Authorized Version renders the Greek
spekulator by "executioner," earlier English versions by "hangman," the
Revised Version by "soldier of his guard." The word properly means a
"pikeman" or "halberdier," of whom the bodyguard of kings and princes
was composed. In [Mat 27:65](../kjv/mat027.htm#065), [Mat
27:66](../kjv/mat027.htm#066); [Mat 28:11](../kjv/mat028.htm#011), the
Authorized Version renders the Greek kustodia by "watch," and the
Revised Version by "guard," the Roman guard, which consisted of four
soldiers, who were relieved every three hours ([Act
12:4](../kjv/act012.htm#004)). The "captain of the guard" mentioned [Act
28:16](../kjv/act028.htm#016) was the commander of the Praetorian
troops, whose duty it was to receive and take charge of all prisoners
from the provinces.
