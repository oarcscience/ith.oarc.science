<span id="000">**Zophar**</span> Chirping, one of Job's friends who came
to condole with him in his distress ([Job 2:11](../kjv/job002.htm#011).
The LXX. render here "king of the Mineans" = Ma'in , Maonites, [Jdg
10:12](../kjv/jdg010.htm#012), in Southern Arabia). He is called a
Naamathite, or an inhabitant of some unknown place called Naamah.

<span id="001">**Zophim, Field of**</span> Field of watchers, a place in
Moab on the range of Pisgah ([Num 23:14](../kjv/num023.htm#014)). To
this place Balak brought Balaam, that he might from thence curse the
children of Israel. Balaam could only speak the word of the Lord, and
that was blessing. It is the modern Tal'at-es-Safa . (See PISGAH.)

<span id="002">**Zorah**</span> Place of wasps, a town in the low
country of Judah, afterwards given to Dan ([Jos
19:41](../kjv/jos019.htm#041); [Jdg 18:2](../kjv/jdg018.htm#002)),
probably the same as Zoreah ([Jos 15:33](../kjv/jos015.htm#033)). This
was Samson's birthplace ([Jdg 13:2](../kjv/jdg013.htm#002), [Jdg
13:25](../kjv/jdg013.htm#025)), and near it he found a grave ([Jdg
16:31](../kjv/jdg016.htm#031)). It was situated on the crest of a hill
overlooking the valley of Sorek, and was fortified by Rehoboam ([Ch2
11:10](../kjv/ch2011.htm#010)). It has been identified with Sur'ah , in
the Wady Surar , 8 miles west of Jerusalem. It is noticed on monuments
in the fifteenth century B.C. as attacked by the Abiri or Hebrews.

<span id="003">**Zuph**</span> Honeycomb, a Kohathite Levite, ancestor
of Elkanah and Samuel ([Sa1 1:1](../kjv/sa1001.htm#001)); called also
Zophai ([Ch1 6:26](../kjv/ch1006.htm#026)).

<span id="004">**Zuph, Land of**</span> ([Sa1
9:5](../kjv/sa1009.htm#005), [Sa1 9:6](../kjv/sa1009.htm#006)), a
district in which lay Samuel's city, Ramah. It was probably so named
after Elkanah's son, Zuph ([Ch1 6:26](../kjv/ch1006.htm#026), marg.).

<span id="005">**Zur**</span> Rock. (1.) One of the five Midianite kings
whom the Israelites defeated and put to death ([Num
31:8](../kjv/num031.htm#008)). (2.) A Benjamite ([Ch1
8:30](../kjv/ch1008.htm#030)).

<span id="006">**Zuriel**</span> Rock of God, chief of the family of the
Merarites ([Num 3:35](../kjv/num003.htm#035)) at the time of the Exodus.

<span id="007">**Zurishaddai**</span> Rock of the Almighty, the father
of Shelumiel, who was chief of the tribe of Simeon when Israel was
encamped at Sinai ([Num 1:6](../kjv/num001.htm#006); [Num
2:12](../kjv/num002.htm#012)).

<span id="008">**Zuzims**</span> Restless; sprouting, were smitten "in
Ham" by Chedorlaomer and his allies ([Gen 14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005)).
Some have identified this tribe with the Zamzummims (q.v.).
