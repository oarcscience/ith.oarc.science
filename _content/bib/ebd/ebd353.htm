<P><A NAME="000"><B>Sukkiims</B></A>     Dwellers in tents, (Vulg. and LXX., &quot;troglodites;&quot; i.e., cave-dwellers in the hills along the Red Sea). Shiskak's army, with which he marched against Jerusalem, was composed partly of this tribe (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2012.htm#003">Ch2 12:3</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Sun</B></A>     (Heb.  shemesh ), first mentioned along with the moon as the two great luminaries of heaven (<A HREF="../kjv/gen001.htm#014">Gen 1:14</A>). By their motions and influence they were intended to mark and divide times and seasons. The worship of the sun was one of the oldest forms of false religion (<A HREF="../kjv/job031.htm#026">Job 31:26</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/job031.htm#027">Job 31:27</A>), and was common among the Egyptians and Chaldeans and other pagan nations. The Jews were warned against this form of idolatry (<A HREF="../kjv/deu004.htm#019">Deu 4:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu017.htm#003">Deu 17:3</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/kg2023.htm#011">Kg2 23:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer019.htm#013">Jer 19:13</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Suph</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/deu001.htm#001">Deu 1:1</A>, R.V.; marg., &quot;some ancient versions have the Red Sea,&quot; as in the A.V.). Some identify it with Suphah (<A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#014">Num 21:14</A>, marg., A.V.) as probably the name of a place. Others identify it with es - Sufah = Maaleh-acrabbim (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#003">Jos 15:3</A>), and others again with Zuph (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1009.htm#005">Sa1 9:5</A>). It is most probable, however, that, in accordance with the ancient versions, this word is to be regarded as simply an abbreviation of Yam-suph, i.e., the &quot;Red Sea.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Suphah</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#014">Num 21:14</A>, marg.; also R.V.), a place at the south-eastern corner of the Dead Sea, the Ghor es-Safieh. This name is found in an ode quoted from the &quot;Book of the Wars of the Lord,&quot; probably a collection of odes commemorating the triumphs of God's people (compare <A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#014">Num 21:14</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#017">Num 21:17</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#018">Num 21:18</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#027">Num 21:27</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Supper</B></A>     The principal meal of the day among the Jews. It was partaken of in the early part of the evening (<A HREF="../kjv/mar006.htm#021">Mar 6:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joh012.htm#002">Joh 12:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/co1011.htm#021">Co1 11:21</A>). (See LORD'S SUPPER.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Surety</B></A>     One who becomes responsible for another. Christ is the surety of the better covenant (<A HREF="../kjv/heb007.htm#022">Heb 7:22</A>). In him we have the assurance that all its provisions will be fully and faithfully carried out. Solomon warns against incautiously becoming security for another (<A HREF="../kjv/pro006.htm#001">Pro 6:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pro011.htm#015">Pro 11:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pro017.htm#018">Pro 17:18</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pro020.htm#016">Pro 20:16</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Susanchites</B></A>     The inhabitants of Shushan, who joined the other adversaries of the Jews in the attempt to prevent the rebuilding of the temple (<A HREF="../kjv/ezr004.htm#009">Ezr 4:9</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Susanna</B></A>     Lily, with other pious women, ministered to Jesus (<A HREF="../kjv/luk008.htm#003">Luk 8:3</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Susi</B></A>     The father of Gaddi, who was one of the twelve spies (<A HREF="../kjv/num013.htm#011">Num 13:11</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Swallow</B></A>      (1.) Heb.  sis  (<A HREF="../kjv/isa038.htm#014">Isa 38:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer008.htm#007">Jer 8:7</A>), the Arabic for the swift, which &quot;is a regular migrant, returning in myriads every spring, and so suddenly that while one day not a swift can be seen in the country, on the next they have over-spread the whole land, and fill the air with their shrill cry.&quot; The swift (cypselus) is ordinarily classed with the swallow, which it resembles in its flight, habits, and migration. (2.) Heb.  deror , i.e., &quot;the bird of freedom&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/psa084.htm#003">Psa 84:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pro026.htm#002">Pro 26:2</A>), properly rendered swallow, distinguished for its swiftness of flight, its love of freedom, and the impossibility of retaining it in captivity. In <A HREF="../kjv/isa038.htm#014">Isa 38:14</A> and <A HREF="../kjv/jer008.htm#007">Jer 8:7</A> the word thus rendered ( 'augr ) properly means &quot;crane&quot; (as in the R.V.).
