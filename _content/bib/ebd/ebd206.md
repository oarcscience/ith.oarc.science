<span id="000">**Jethro**</span> His excellence, or gain, a prince or
priest of Midian, who succeeded his father Reuel. Moses spent forty
years after his exile from the Egyptian court as keeper of Jethro's
flocks. While the Israelites were encamped at Sinai, and soon after
their victory over Amalek, Jethro came to meet Moses, bringing with him
Zipporah and her two sons. They met at the "mount of God," and "Moses
told him all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh" ([Exo
18:8](../kjv/exo018.htm#008)). On the following day Jethro, observing
the multiplicity of the duties devolving on Moses, advised him to
appoint subordinate judges, rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of
fifties, and of tens, to decide smaller matters, leaving only the
weightier matters to be referred to Moses, to be laid before the Lord.
This advice Moses adopted (Ex. 18). He was also called Hobab (q.v.),
which was probably his personal name, while Jethro was an official name.
(See MOSES.)

<span id="001">**Jetur**</span> An enclosure, one of the twelve sons of
Ishmael ([Gen 25:15](../kjv/gen025.htm#015)).

<span id="002">**Jeuel**</span> Snatched away by God, a descendant of
Zerah ([Ch1 9:6](../kjv/ch1009.htm#006)).

<span id="003">**Jeush**</span> Assembler. (1.) The oldest of Esau's
three sons by Aholibamah ([Gen 36:5](../kjv/gen036.htm#005), [Gen
36:14](../kjv/gen036.htm#014), [Gen 36:18](../kjv/gen036.htm#018)). (2.)
A son of Bilhan, grandson of Benjamin ([Ch1
7:10](../kjv/ch1007.htm#010)). (3.) A Levite, one of the sons of Shimei
([Ch1 23:10](../kjv/ch1023.htm#010), [Ch1
23:11](../kjv/ch1023.htm#011)). (4.) One of the three sons of Rehoboam
([Ch2 11:19](../kjv/ch2011.htm#019)). (5.) [Ch1
8:39](../kjv/ch1008.htm#039).

<span id="004">**Jew**</span> The name derived from the patriarch Judah,
at first given to one belonging to the tribe of Judah or to the separate
kingdom of Judah ([Kg2 16:6](../kjv/kg2016.htm#006); [Kg2
25:25](../kjv/kg2025.htm#025); [Jer 32:12](../kjv/jer032.htm#012); [Jer
38:19](../kjv/jer038.htm#019); [Jer 40:11](../kjv/jer040.htm#011); [Jer
41:3](../kjv/jer041.htm#003)), in contradistinction from those belonging
to the kingdom of the ten tribes, who were called Israelites. During the
Captivity, and after the Restoration, the name, however, was extended to
all the Hebrew nation without distinction ([Est
3:6](../kjv/est003.htm#006), [Est 3:10](../kjv/est003.htm#010); [Dan
3:8](../kjv/dan003.htm#008), [Dan 3:12](../kjv/dan003.htm#012); [Ezr
4:12](../kjv/ezr004.htm#012); [Ezr 5:1](../kjv/ezr005.htm#001), [Ezr
5:5](../kjv/ezr005.htm#005)). Originally this people were called Hebrews
([Gen 39:14](../kjv/gen039.htm#014); [Gen 40:15](../kjv/gen040.htm#015);
[Exo 2:7](../kjv/exo002.htm#007); [Exo 3:18](../kjv/exo003.htm#018);
[Exo 5:3](../kjv/exo005.htm#003); [Sa1 4:6](../kjv/sa1004.htm#006), [Sa1
4:9](../kjv/sa1004.htm#009), etc.), but after the Exile this name fell
into disuse. But Paul was styled a Hebrew ([Co2
11:22](../kjv/co2011.htm#022); [Phi 3:5](../kjv/phi003.htm#005)). The
history of the Jewish nation is interwoven with the history of Palestine
and with the narratives of the lives of their rulers and chief men. They
are now dispersed over all lands, and to this day remain a separate
people, "without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice,
and without an image \[R.V. 'pillar,' marg. 'obelisk'\], and without an
ephod, and without teraphim" ([Hos 3:4](../kjv/hos003.htm#004)). Till
about the beginning of the present century they were everywhere greatly
oppressed, and often cruelly persecuted; but now their condition is
greatly improved, and they are admitted in most European countries to
all the rights of free citizens. In 1860 the "Jewish disabilities" were
removed, and they were admitted to a seat in the British Parliament.
Their number in all is estimated at about six millions, about four
millions being in Europe. There are three names used in the New
Testament to designate this people, (1.) Jews, as regards their
nationality, to distinguish them from Gentiles. (2.) Hebrews, with
regard to their language and education, to distinguish them from
Hellenists, i.e., Jews who spoke the Greek language. (3.) Israelites, as
respects their sacred privileges as the chosen people of God. "To other
races we owe the splendid inheritance of modern civilization and secular
culture; but the religious education of mankind has been the gift of the
Jew alone."

<span id="005">**Jewess**</span> A woman of Hebrew birth, as Eunice, the
mother of Timothy ([Act 16:1](../kjv/act016.htm#001); [Ti2
1:5](../kjv/ti2001.htm#005)), and Drusilla ([Act
24:24](../kjv/act024.htm#024)), wife of Felix, and daughter of Herod
Agrippa I.

<span id="006">**Jezebel**</span> Chaste, the daughter of Ethbaal, the
king of the Zidonians, and the wife of Ahab, the king of Israel ([Kg1
16:31](../kjv/kg1016.htm#031)). This was the "first time that a king of
Israel had allied himself by marriage with a heathen princess; and the
alliance was in this case of a peculiarly disastrous kind. Jezebel has
stamped her name on history as the representative of all that is
designing, crafty, malicious, revengeful, and cruel. She is the first
great instigator of persecution against the saints of God. Guided by no
principle, restrained by no fear of either God or man, passionate in her
attachment to her heathen worship, she spared no pains to maintain
idolatry around her in all its splendour. Four hundred and fifty
prophets ministered under her care to Baal, besides four hundred
prophets of the groves \[R.V., 'prophets of the Asherah'\], which ate at
her table ([Kg1 18:19](../kjv/kg1018.htm#019)). The idolatry, too, was
of the most debased and sensual kind." Her conduct was in many respects
very disastrous to the kingdom both of Israel and Judah (1 Kings
21:1-29). At length she came to an untimely end. As Jehu rode into the
gates of Jezreel, she looked out at the window of the palace, and said,
"Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?" He looked up and called to her
chamberlains, who instantly threw her from the window, so that she was
dashed in pieces on the street, and his horses trod her under their
feet. She was immediately consumed by the dogs of the street (2 Kings
9:7-37), according to the word of Elijah the Tishbite ([Kg1
21:19](../kjv/kg1021.htm#019)). Her name afterwards came to be used as
the synonym for a wicked woman ([Rev 2:20](../kjv/rev002.htm#020)). It
may be noted that she is said to have been the grand-aunt of Dido, the
founder of Carthage.

<span id="007">**Jeziel**</span> Assembled by God, a son of Azmaveth. He
was one of the Benjamite archers who joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1
12:3](../kjv/ch1012.htm#003)).

<span id="008">**Jezreel**</span> God scatters. (1.) A town of Issachar
([Jos 19:18](../kjv/jos019.htm#018)), where the kings of Israel often
resided ([Kg1 18:45](../kjv/kg1018.htm#045); [Kg1
21:1](../kjv/kg1021.htm#001); [Kg2 9:30](../kjv/kg2009.htm#030)). Here
Elijah met Ahab, Jehu, and Bidkar; and here Jehu executed his dreadful
commission against the house of Ahab (2 Kings 9:14-37; [Kg2
10:1](../kjv/kg2010.htm#001)). It has been identified with the modern
Zerin, on the most western point of the range of Gilboa, reaching down
into the great and fertile valley of Jezreel, to which it gave its name.
(2.) A town in Judah ([Jos 15:56](../kjv/jos015.htm#056)), to the
south-east of Hebron. Ahinoam, one of David's wives, probably belonged
to this place ([Sa1 27:3](../kjv/sa1027.htm#003)). (3.) A symbolical
name given by Hosea to his oldest son ([Hos
1:4](../kjv/hos001.htm#004)), in token of a great slaughter predicted by
him, like that which had formerly taken place in the plain of Esdraelon
(compare [Hos 1:4](../kjv/hos001.htm#004), [Hos
1:5](../kjv/hos001.htm#005)).

<span id="009">**Jezreel, Blood of**</span> The murder perpetrated here
by Ahab and Jehu ([Hos 1:4](../kjv/hos001.htm#004); compare [Kg1
18:4](../kjv/kg1018.htm#004); [Kg2 9:6](../kjv/kg2009.htm#006)).
