<span id="000">**South**</span> Heb. Negeb , that arid district to the
south of Palestine through which lay the caravan route from Central
Palestine to Egypt ([Gen 12:9](../kjv/gen012.htm#009); [Gen
13:1](../kjv/gen013.htm#001), [Gen 13:3](../kjv/gen013.htm#003); [Gen
46:1](../kjv/gen046.htm#001)). "The Negeb comprised a considerable but
irregularly-shaped tract of country, its main portion stretching from
the mountains and lowlands of Judah in the north to the mountains of
Azazemeh in the south, and from the Dead Sea and southern Ghoron the
east to the Mediterranean on the west." In [Eze
20:46](../kjv/eze020.htm#046) ([Eze 21:1](../kjv/eze021.htm#001) in
Heb.) three different Hebrew words are all rendered "south." (1.) "Set
thy face toward the south" ( Teman , the region on the right, [Sa1
23:24](../kjv/sa1023.htm#024)); (2.) "Drop thy word toward the south" (
Negeb , the region of dryness, [Jos 15:4](../kjv/jos015.htm#004)); (3.)
"Prophesy against the forest of the south field" ( Darom , the region of
brightness, [Deu 33:23](../kjv/deu033.htm#023)). In [Job
37:9](../kjv/job037.htm#009) the word "south" is literally "chamber,"
used here in the sense of treasury (compare [Job
38:22](../kjv/job038.htm#022); [Psa 135:7](../kjv/psa135.htm#007)). This
verse is rendered in the Revised Version "out of the chamber of the
south."

<span id="001">**Sovereignty**</span> Of God, his absolute right to do
all things according to his own good pleasure ([Dan
4:25](../kjv/dan004.htm#025), [Dan 4:35](../kjv/dan004.htm#035); [Rom
9:15](../kjv/rom009.htm#015); [Ti1 6:15](../kjv/ti1006.htm#015); [Rev
4:11](../kjv/rev004.htm#011)).

<span id="002">**Spain**</span> Paul expresses his intention ([Rom
15:24](../kjv/rom015.htm#024), [Rom 15:28](../kjv/rom015.htm#028)) to
visit Spain. There is, however, no evidence that he ever carried it into
effect, although some think that he probably did so between his first
and second imprisonment. (See TARSHISH.)

<span id="003">**Sparrow**</span> Mentioned among the offerings made by
the very poor. Two sparrows were sold for a farthing ([Mat
10:29](../kjv/mat010.htm#029)), and five for two farthings ([Luk
12:6](../kjv/luk012.htm#006)). The Hebrew word thus rendered is tsippor,
which properly denotes the whole family of small birds which feed on
grain ([Lev 14:4](../kjv/lev014.htm#004); [Psa
84:3](../kjv/psa084.htm#003); [Psa 102:7](../kjv/psa102.htm#007)). The
Greek word of the New Testament is strouthion ([Mat
10:29](../kjv/mat010.htm#029)), which is thus correctly rendered.

<span id="004">**Spicery**</span> Heb. nechoth , identified with the
Arabic naka'at , the gum tragacanth, obtained from the astralagus , of
which there are about twenty species found in Palestine. The tragacanth
of commerce is obtained from the A. tragacantha . "The gum exudes
plentifully under the heat of the sun on the leaves, thorns, and
extremity of the twigs."

<span id="005">**Spices**</span> Aromatic substances, of which several
are named in Ex. 30. They were used in the sacred anointing oil ([Exo
25:6](../kjv/exo025.htm#006); [Exo 35:8](../kjv/exo035.htm#008); [Ch1
9:29](../kjv/ch1009.htm#029)), and in embalming the dead ([Ch2
16:14](../kjv/ch2016.htm#014); [Luk 23:56](../kjv/luk023.htm#056); [Luk
24:1](../kjv/luk024.htm#001); [Joh 19:39](../kjv/joh019.htm#039), [Joh
19:40](../kjv/joh019.htm#040)). Spices were stored by Hezekiah in his
treasure-house ([Kg2 20:13](../kjv/kg2020.htm#013); [Isa
39:2](../kjv/isa039.htm#002)).

<span id="006">**Spider**</span> The trust of the hypocrite is compared
to the spider's web or house ([Job 8:14](../kjv/job008.htm#014)). It is
said of the wicked by Isaiah that they "weave the spider's web" ([Isa
59:5](../kjv/isa059.htm#005)), i.e., their works and designs are, like
the spider's web, vain and useless. The Hebrew word here used is
'akkabish , "a swift weaver." In [Pro 30:28](../kjv/pro030.htm#028) a
different Hebrew word ( semamith ) is used. It is rendered in the
Vulgate by stellio , and in the Revised Version by "lizard." It may,
however, represent the spider, of which there are, it is said, about
seven hundred species in Palestine.

<span id="007">**Spies**</span> When the Israelites reached Kadesh for
the first time, and were encamped there, Moses selected twelve spies
from among the chiefs of the divisions of the tribes, and sent them
forth to spy the land of Canaan (Num. 13), and to bring back to him a
report of its actual condition. They at once proceeded on their
important errand, and went through the land as far north as the district
round Lake Merom. After about six weeks' absence they returned. Their
report was very discouraging, and the people were greatly alarmed, and
in a rebellious spirit proposed to elect a new leader and return to
Egypt. Only two of the spies, Caleb and Joshua, showed themselves on
this occasion stout-hearted and faithful. All their appeals and
remonstrances were in vain. Moses announced that as a punishment for
their rebellion they must now wander in the wilderness till a new
generation should arise which would go up and posses the land. The spies
had been forty days absent on their expedition, and for each day the
Israelites were to be wanderers for a year in the desert. (See ESHCOL.)
Two spies were sent by Joshua "secretly" i.e., unknown to the people
([Jos 2:1](../kjv/jos002.htm#001)), "to view the land and Jericho" after
the death of Moses, and just before the tribes under his leadership were
about to cross the Jordan. They learned from Rahab (q.v.), in whose
house they found a hiding-place, that terror had fallen on all the
inhabitants of the land because of the great things they had heard that
Jehovah had done for them ([Exo 15:14](../kjv/exo015.htm#014); compare
[Exo 23:27](../kjv/exo023.htm#027); [Deu 2:25](../kjv/deu002.htm#025);
[Deu 11:25](../kjv/deu011.htm#025)). As the result of their mission they
reported: "Truly Jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land; for
even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us."

<span id="008">**Spikenard**</span> (Heb. nerd ), a much-valued perfume
([Sol 1:12](../kjv/sol001.htm#012); [Sol 4:13](../kjv/sol004.htm#013),
[Sol 4:14](../kjv/sol004.htm#014)). It was "very precious", i.e., very
costly ([Mar 14:3](../kjv/mar014.htm#003); [Joh
12:3](../kjv/joh012.htm#003), [Joh 12:5](../kjv/joh012.htm#005)). It is
the root of an Indian plant, the Nardostachys jatamansi, of the family
of Valeriance, growing on the Himalaya mountains. It is distinguished by
its having many hairy spikes shooting out from one root. It is called by
the Arabs sunbul Hindi, "the Indian spike." In the New Testament this
word is the rendering of the Greek nardos pistike . The margin of the
Revised Version in these passages has "pistic nard," pistic being
perhaps a local name. Some take it to mean genuine, and others liquid.
The most probable opinion is that the word pistike designates the nard
as genuine or faithfully prepared.

<span id="009">**Spirit**</span> (Heb. ruah ; Gr. pneuma ), properly
wind or breath. In [Th2 2:8](../kjv/th2002.htm#008) it means "breath,"
and in [Ecc 8:8](../kjv/ecc008.htm#008) the vital principle in man. It
also denotes the rational, immortal soul by which man is distinguished
([Act 7:59](../kjv/act007.htm#059); [Co1 5:5](../kjv/co1005.htm#005);
[Co1 6:20](../kjv/co1006.htm#020); [Co1 7:34](../kjv/co1007.htm#034)),
and the soul in its separate state ([Heb 12:23](../kjv/heb012.htm#023)),
and hence also an apparition ([Job 4:15](../kjv/job004.htm#015); [Luk
24:37](../kjv/luk024.htm#037), [Luk 24:39](../kjv/luk024.htm#039)), an
angel ([Heb 1:14](../kjv/heb001.htm#014)), and a demon ([Luk
4:36](../kjv/luk004.htm#036); [Luk 10:20](../kjv/luk010.htm#020)). This
word is used also metaphorically as denoting a tendency ([Zac
12:10](../kjv/zac012.htm#010); [Luk 13:11](../kjv/luk013.htm#011)). In
[Rom 1:4](../kjv/rom001.htm#004), [Ti1 3:16](../kjv/ti1003.htm#016),
[Co2 3:17](../kjv/co2003.htm#017), [Pe1 3:18](../kjv/pe1003.htm#018), it
designates the divine nature.
