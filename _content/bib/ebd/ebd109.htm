<P><A NAME="000"><B>Dulcimer</B></A>     (Heb.  sumphoniah ), a musical instrument mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/dan003.htm#005">Dan 3:5</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/dan003.htm#015">Dan 3:15</A>, along with other instruments there named, as sounded before the golden image. It was not a Jewish instrument. In the margin of the Revised Version it is styled the &quot;bag-pipe.&quot; Luther translated it &quot;lute,&quot; and Grotius the &quot;crooked trumpet.&quot; It is probable that it was introduced into Babylon by some Greek or Western-Asiatic musician. Some Rabbinical commentators render it by &quot;organ,&quot; the well-known instrument composed of a series of pipes, others by &quot;lyre.&quot; The most probable interpretation is that it was a bag-pipe similar to the zampagna of Southern Europe. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Dumah</B></A>     Silence, (compare <A HREF="../kjv/psa094.htm#017">Psa 94:17</A>), the fourth son of Ishmael; also the tribe descended from him; and hence also the region in Arabia which they inhabited (<A HREF="../kjv/gen025.htm#014">Gen 25:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1001.htm#030">Ch1 1:30</A>). There was also a town of this name in Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#052">Jos 15:52</A>), which has been identified with ed-Domeh, about 10 miles southwest of Hebron. The place mentioned in the &quot;burden&quot; of the prophet Isaiah (<A HREF="../kjv/isa021.htm#011">Isa 21:11</A>) is Edom or Idumea. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Dumb</B></A>     From natural infirmity (<A HREF="../kjv/exo004.htm#011">Exo 4:11</A>); not knowing what to say (<A HREF="../kjv/pro031.htm#008">Pro 31:8</A>); unwillingness to speak (<A HREF="../kjv/psa039.htm#009">Psa 39:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lev010.htm#003">Lev 10:3</A>). Christ repeatedly restored the dumb (<A HREF="../kjv/mat009.htm#032">Mat 9:32</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mat009.htm#033">Mat 9:33</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk011.htm#014">Luk 11:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat012.htm#022">Mat 12:22</A>) to the use of speech. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Dung</B></A>      (1.) Used as manure (<A HREF="../kjv/luk013.htm#008">Luk 13:8</A>); collected outside the city walls (<A HREF="../kjv/neh002.htm#013">Neh 2:13</A>). Of sacrifices, burned outside the camp (<A HREF="../kjv/exo029.htm#014">Exo 29:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lev004.htm#011">Lev 4:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lev008.htm#017">Lev 8:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num019.htm#005">Num 19:5</A>). To be &quot;cast out as dung,&quot; a figurative expression (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1014.htm#010">Kg1 14:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2009.htm#037">Kg2 9:37</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer008.htm#002">Jer 8:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa018.htm#042">Psa 18:42</A>), meaning to be rejected as unprofitable. (2.) Used as fuel, a substitute for firewood, which was with difficulty procured in Syria, Arabia, and Egypt (<A HREF="../kjv/eze004.htm#012">Eze 4:12</A>), where cows' and camels' dung is used to the present day for this purpose. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Dung-gate</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/neh002.htm#013">Neh 2:13</A>), a gate of ancient Jerusalem, on the south-west quarter. &quot;The gate outside of which lay the piles of sweepings and off-scourings of the streets,&quot; in the valley of Tophet. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Dung-hill</B></A>     To sit on a, was a sign of the deepest dejection (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#008">Sa1 2:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa113.htm#007">Psa 113:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lam004.htm#005">Lam 4:5</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Dungeon</B></A>     Different from the ordinary prison in being more severe as a place of punishment. Like the Roman inner prison (<A HREF="../kjv/act016.htm#024">Act 16:24</A>), it consisted of a deep cell or cistern (<A HREF="../kjv/jer038.htm#006">Jer 38:6</A>). To be shut up in, a punishment common in Egypt (<A HREF="../kjv/gen039.htm#020">Gen 39:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen040.htm#003">Gen 40:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen041.htm#010">Gen 41:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen042.htm#019">Gen 42:19</A>). It is not mentioned, however, in the law of Moses as a mode of punishment. Under the later kings imprisonment was frequently used as a punishment (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2016.htm#010">Ch2 16:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer020.htm#002">Jer 20:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer032.htm#002">Jer 32:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer033.htm#001">Jer 33:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer037.htm#015">Jer 37:15</A>), and it was customary after the Exile (<A HREF="../kjv/mat011.htm#002">Mat 11:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk003.htm#020">Luk 3:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/act005.htm#018">Act 5:18</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/act005.htm#021">Act 5:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat018.htm#030">Mat 18:30</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Dura</B></A>     The circle, the plain near Babylon in which Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden image, mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/dan003.htm#001">Dan 3:1</A>. The place still retains its ancient name. On one of its many mounds the pedestal of what must have been a colossal statue has been found. It has been supposed to be that of the golden image. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Dust</B></A>     Storms of sand and dust sometimes overtake Eastern travelers. They are very dreadful, many perishing under them. Jehovah threatens to bring on the land of Israel, as a punishment for forsaking him, a rain of &quot;powder and dust&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/deu028.htm#024">Deu 28:24</A>). To cast dust on the head was a sign of mourning (<A HREF="../kjv/jos007.htm#006">Jos 7:6</A>); and to sit in dust, of extreme affliction (<A HREF="../kjv/isa047.htm#001">Isa 47:1</A>). &quot;Dust&quot; is used to denote the grave (<A HREF="../kjv/job007.htm#021">Job 7:21</A>). &quot;To shake off the dust from one's feet&quot; against another is to renounce all future intercourse with him (<A HREF="../kjv/mat010.htm#014">Mat 10:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/act013.htm#051">Act 13:51</A>). To &quot;lick the dust&quot; is a sign of abject submission (<A HREF="../kjv/psa072.htm#009">Psa 72:9</A>); and to throw dust at one is a sign of abhorrence (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2016.htm#013">Sa2 16:13</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/act022.htm#023">Act 22:23</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Dwarf</B></A>     A lean or emaciated person (<A HREF="../kjv/lev021.htm#020">Lev 21:20</A>).
