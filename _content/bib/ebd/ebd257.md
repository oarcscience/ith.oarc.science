------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Mishma**</span> Hearing. (1.) One of the sons of
Ishmael ([Gen 25:14](../kjv/gen025.htm#014)), and founder of an Arab
tribe. (2.) A Simeonite ([Ch1 4:25](../kjv/ch1004.htm#025), [Ch1
4:26](../kjv/ch1004.htm#026)).

<span id="001">**Mishmannah**</span> Fatness, one of the Gadite heroes
who gathered to David at Ziklag ([Ch1 12:10](../kjv/ch1012.htm#010)).

<span id="002">**Misrephoth-maim**</span> Burning of waters supposed to
be salt-pans, or lime-kilns, or glass-factories, a place to which Joshua
pursued a party of Canaanites after the defeat of Jabin ([Jos
11:8](../kjv/jos011.htm#008)). It is identified with the ruin
Musheirifeh, at the promontory of en-Nakhurah, some 11 miles north of
Acre.

<span id="003">**Mite**</span> Contraction of minute, from the Latin
minutum , the translation of the Greek word lepton , the very smallest
bronze of copper coin ([Luk 12:59](../kjv/luk012.htm#059); [Luk
21:2](../kjv/luk021.htm#002)). Two mites made one quadrans , i.e., the
fourth part of a Roman as, which was in value nearly a half-penny. (See
FARTHING.)

<span id="004">**Mithcah**</span> Sweetness, one of the stations of the
Israelites in the wilderness ([Num 33:28](../kjv/num033.htm#028), [Num
33:29](../kjv/num033.htm#029)).

<span id="005">**Mithredath**</span> Given by Mithra, or dedicated to
Mithra, i.e., the sun, the Hebrew form of the Greek name Mithridates .
(1.) The "treasurer" of King Cyrus ([Ezr 1:8](../kjv/ezr001.htm#008)).
(2.) [Ezr 4:7](../kjv/ezr004.htm#007), a Persian officer in Samaria.

<span id="006">**Mitre**</span> (Heb. mitsnepheth ), something rolled
round the head; the turban or head-dress of the high priest ([Exo
28:4](../kjv/exo028.htm#004), [Exo 28:37](../kjv/exo028.htm#037), [Exo
28:39](../kjv/exo028.htm#039); [Exo 29:6](../kjv/exo029.htm#006), etc.).
In the Authorized Version of [Eze 21:26](../kjv/eze021.htm#026), this
Hebrew word is rendered "diadem," but in the Revised Version, "mitre."
It was a twisted band of fine linen, 8 yards in length, coiled into the
form of a cap, and worn on official occasions ([Lev
8:9](../kjv/lev008.htm#009); [Lev 16:4](../kjv/lev016.htm#004); [Zac
3:5](../kjv/zac003.htm#005)). On the front of it was a golden plate with
the inscription, "Holiness to the Lord." The mitsnepheth differed from
the mitre or head-dress ( migba'ah ) of the common priest. (See BONNET.)

<span id="007">**Mitylene**</span> The chief city of the island of
Lesbos, on its east coast, in the Aegean Sea. Paul, during his third
missionary journey, touched at this place on his way from Corinth to
Judea ([Act 20:14](../kjv/act020.htm#014)), and here tarried for a
night. It lies between Assos and Chios. It is now under the Turkish
rule, and bears the name of Metelin.

<span id="008">**Mixed Multitude**</span> [Exo
12:38](../kjv/exo012.htm#038)), a class who accompanied the Israelites
as they journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, the first stage of the
Exodus. These were probably miscellaneous hangers-on to the Hebrews,
whether Egyptians of the lower orders, or the remains of the Hyksos (see
EGYPT; MOSES), as some think. The same thing happened on the return of
the Jews from Babylon ([Neh 13:3](../kjv/neh013.htm#003)), a "mixed
multitude" accompanied them so far.

<span id="009">**Mizar**</span> Smallness, a summit on the eastern ridge
of Lebanon, near which David lay after escaping from Absalom ([Psa
42:6](../kjv/psa042.htm#006)). It may, perhaps, be the present Jebel
Ajlun, thus named, "the little", in contrast with the greater elevation
of Lebanon and Hermon.
