<span id="000">**Reuben, Tribe of**</span> At the Exodus numbered 46,500
male adults, from twenty years old and upwards ([Num
1:20](../kjv/num001.htm#020), [Num 1:21](../kjv/num001.htm#021)), and at
the close of the wilderness wanderings they numbered only 43,730 ([Num
26:7](../kjv/num026.htm#007)). This tribe united with that of Gad in
asking permission to settle in the "land of Gilead," "on the other side
of Jordan" ([Num 32:1](../kjv/num032.htm#001)). The lot assigned to
Reuben was the smallest of the lots given to the trans-Jordanic tribes.
It extended from the Arnon, in the south along the coast of the Dead Sea
to its northern end, where the Jordan flows into it ([Jos
13:15](../kjv/jos013.htm#015), [Jos 13:23](../kjv/jos013.htm#023)). It
thus embraced the original kingdom of Sihon. Reuben is "to the eastern
tribes what Simeon is to the western. 'Unstable as water,' he vanishes
away into a mere Arabian tribe. 'His men are few;' it is all he can do
'to live and not die.' We hear of nothing beyond the multiplication of
their cattle in the land of Gilead, their spoils of 'camels fifty
thousand, and of asses two thousand' ([Ch1 5:9](../kjv/ch1005.htm#009),
[Ch1 5:10](../kjv/ch1005.htm#010), [Ch1 5:20](../kjv/ch1005.htm#020),
[Ch1 5:21](../kjv/ch1005.htm#021)). In the great struggles of the nation
he never took part. The complaint against him in the song of Deborah is
the summary of his whole history. 'By the streams of Reuben,' i.e., by
the fresh streams which descend from the eastern hills into the Jordan
and the Dead Sea, on whose banks the Bedouin chiefs met then as now to
debate, in the 'streams' of Reuben great were the 'desires'", i.e.,
resolutions which were never carried out, the people idly resting among
their flocks as if it were a time of peace ([Jdg
5:15](../kjv/jdg005.htm#015), [Jdg 5:16](../kjv/jdg005.htm#016)).
Stanley's Sinai and Palestine. All the three tribes on the east of
Jordan at length fell into complete apostasy, and the time of
retribution came. God "stirred up the spirit of Pul, king of Assyria,
and the spirit of Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria," to carry them away,
the first of the tribes, into captivity ([Ch1
5:25](../kjv/ch1005.htm#025), [Ch1 5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026)).

<span id="001">**Reuel**</span> Friend of God. (1.) A son of Esau and
Bashemath ([Gen 36:4](../kjv/gen036.htm#004), [Gen
36:10](../kjv/gen036.htm#010); [Ch1 1:35](../kjv/ch1001.htm#035)). (2.)
"The priest of Midian," Moses' father-in-law ([Exo
2:18](../kjv/exo002.htm#018)) = Raguel ([Num
10:29](../kjv/num010.htm#029)). If he be identified with Jethro (q.v.),
then this may be regarded as his proper name, and Jether or Jethro
(i.e., "excellency") as his official title. (3.) [Num
2:14](../kjv/num002.htm#014), called also Deuel ([Num
1:14](../kjv/num001.htm#014); [Num 7:42](../kjv/num007.htm#042)).

<span id="002">**Revelation**</span> An uncovering, a bringing to light
of that which had been previously wholly hidden or only obscurely seen.
God has been pleased in various ways and at different times ([Heb
1:1](../kjv/heb001.htm#001)) to make a supernatural revelation of
himself and his purposes and plans, which, under the guidance of his
Spirit, has been committed to writing. (See WORD OF GOD.) The Scriptures
are not merely the "record" of revelation; they are the revelation
itself in a written form, in order to the accurate preservation and
propagation of the truth. Revelation and inspiration differ. Revelation
is the supernatural communication of truth to the mind; inspiration
(q.v.) secures to the teacher or writer infallibility in communicating
that truth to others. It renders its subject the spokesman or prophet of
God in such a sense that everything he asserts to be true, whether fact
or doctrine or moral principle, is true, infallibly true.

<span id="003">**Revelation, Book of**</span> =The Apocalypse, the
closing book and the only prophetical book of the New Testament canon.
The author of this book was undoubtedly John the apostle. His name
occurs four times in the book itself ([Rev 1:1](../kjv/rev001.htm#001),
[Rev 1:4](../kjv/rev001.htm#004), [Rev 1:9](../kjv/rev001.htm#009); [Rev
22:8](../kjv/rev022.htm#008)), and there is every reason to conclude
that the "John" here mentioned was the apostle. In a manuscript of about
the twelfth century he is called "John the divine," but no reason can be
assigned for this appellation. The date of the writing of this book has
generally been fixed at A.D.96, in the reign of Domitian. There are
some, however, who contend for an earlier date, A.D. 68 or 69, in the
reign of Nero. Those who are in favour of the later date appeal to the
testimony of the Christian father Irenaeus, who received information
relative to this book from those who had seen John face to face. He says
that the Apocalypse "was seen no long time ago." As to the relation
between this book and the Gospel of John, it has been well observed that
"the leading ideas of both are the same. The one gives us in a
magnificent vision, the other in a great historic drama, the supreme
conflict between good and evil and its issue. In both Jesus Christ is
the central figure, whose victory through defeat is the issue of the
conflict. In both the Jewish dispensation is the preparation for the
gospel, and the warfare and triumph of the Christ is described in
language saturated with the Old Testament The difference of date will go
a long way toward explaining the difference of style." Plummer's Gospel
of St. John, Introd.

<span id="004">**Revelation of Christ**</span> The second advent of
Christ. Three different Greek words are used by the apostles to express
this, (1.) apokalupsis (1 Cor. 1; 7; [Th2 1:7](../kjv/th2001.htm#007);
[Pe1 1:7](../kjv/pe1001.htm#007), [Pe1 1:13](../kjv/pe1001.htm#013));
(2.) parousia ([Mat 24:3](../kjv/mat024.htm#003), [Mat
24:27](../kjv/mat024.htm#027); [Th1 2:19](../kjv/th1002.htm#019); [Jam
5:7](../kjv/jam005.htm#007), [Jam 5:8](../kjv/jam005.htm#008)); (3.)
epiphaneia ([Ti1 6:14](../kjv/ti1006.htm#014); [Ti2
1:10](../kjv/ti2001.htm#010); [Ti2 4:1](../kjv/ti2004.htm#001); [Tit
2:13](../kjv/tit002.htm#013)). There existed among Christians a wide
expectation, founded on [Mat 24:29](../kjv/mat024.htm#029), [Mat
24:30](../kjv/mat024.htm#030), [Mat 24:34](../kjv/mat024.htm#034), of
the speedy return of Christ. (See MILLENNIUM.)

<span id="005">**Rezeph**</span> Solid; a stone, ([Kg2
19:12](../kjv/kg2019.htm#012); [Isa 37:12](../kjv/isa037.htm#012)), a
fortress near Haran, probably on the west of the Euphrates, conquered by
Sennacherib.

<span id="006">**Rezin**</span> Firm; a prince, a king of Syria, who
joined Pekah (q.v.) in an invasion of the kingdom of Judah ([Kg2
15:37](../kjv/kg2015.htm#037); [Kg2 16:5](../kjv/kg2016.htm#005); [Isa
7:1](../kjv/isa007.htm#001)). Ahaz induced Tiglath-pileser III. to
attack Damascus, and this caused Rezin to withdraw for the purpose of
defending his own kingdom. Damascus was taken, and Rezin was slain in
battle by the Assyrian king, and his people carried into captivity, 732
B.C. ([Kg2 16:9](../kjv/kg2016.htm#009)).

<span id="007">**Rezon**</span> Prince, son of Eliadah. Abandoning the
service of Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, on the occasion of his being
defeated by David, he became the "captain over a band" of marauders, and
took Damascus, and became king of Syria ([Kg1
11:23](../kjv/kg1011.htm#023); [Sa2 8:3](../kjv/sa2008.htm#003)). For
centuries after this the Syrians were the foes of Israel. He "became an
adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon."

<span id="008">**Rhegium**</span> Breach, a town in the south of Italy,
on the Strait of Messina, at which Paul touched on his way to Rome ([Act
28:13](../kjv/act028.htm#013)). It is now called Rheggio.

<span id="009">**Rhesa**</span> Affection, son of Zorobabel, mentioned
in the genealogy of our Lord ([Luk 3:27](../kjv/luk003.htm#027)).
