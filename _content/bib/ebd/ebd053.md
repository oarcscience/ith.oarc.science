<span id="000">**Bera**</span> Gift, or son of evil, king of Sodom at
the time of the invasion of the four kings under Chedorlaomer ([Gen
14:2](../kjv/gen014.htm#002), [Gen 14:8](../kjv/gen014.htm#008), [Gen
14:17](../kjv/gen014.htm#017), [Gen 14:21](../kjv/gen014.htm#021)).

<span id="001">**Berachah**</span> Blessing. (1.) A valley not far from
Engedi, where Jehoshaphat overthrew the Moabites and Ammonites ([Ch2
20:26](../kjv/ch2020.htm#026)). It has been identified with the valley
of Bereikut. (R.V., "Beracah.") (2.) One of the Benjamite warriors,
Saul's brethren, who joined David when at Ziklag ([Ch1
12:3](../kjv/ch1012.htm#003)).

<span id="002">**Berea**</span> A city of Macedonia to which Paul with
Silas and Timotheus went when persecuted at Thessalonica ([Act
17:10](../kjv/act017.htm#010), [Act 17:13](../kjv/act017.htm#013)), and
from which also he was compelled to withdraw, when he fled to the
sea-coast and thence sailed to Athens ([Act
17:14](../kjv/act017.htm#014), [Act 17:15](../kjv/act017.htm#015)).
Sopater, one of Paul's companions belonged to this city, and his
conversion probably took place at this time ([Act
20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004)). It is now called Verria.

<span id="003">**Berechiah**</span> blessed by Jehovah. (1.) Son of
Shimea, and father of Asaph the musician ([Ch1
6:39](../kjv/ch1006.htm#039); [Ch1 15:17](../kjv/ch1015.htm#017)). (2.)
One of the seven Ephraimite chieftains, son of Meshillemoth ([Ch2
28:12](../kjv/ch2028.htm#012)). (3.) The fourth of the five sons of
Zerubbabel, of the royal family of Judah ([Ch1
3:20](../kjv/ch1003.htm#020)). (4.) The father of the prophet Zechariah
([Zac 1:1](../kjv/zac001.htm#001), [Zac 1:7](../kjv/zac001.htm#007)).

<span id="004">**Bered**</span> hail. (1.) A town in the south of
Palestine ([Gen 16:14](../kjv/gen016.htm#014)), in the desert of Shur,
near Lahai-roi. (2.) A son of Shuthelah, and grandson of Ephraim ([Ch1
7:20](../kjv/ch1007.htm#020)).

<span id="005">**Beriah**</span> A gift, or in evil. (1.) One of Asher's
four sons, and father of Heber ([Gen 46:17](../kjv/gen046.htm#017)).
(2.)A son of Ephraim ([Ch1 7:20](../kjv/ch1007.htm#020)), born after the
slaughter of his brothers, and so called by his father "because it went
evil with his house" at that time. (3.)A Benjamite who with his brother
Shema founded Ajalon and expelled the Gittites ([Ch1
8:13](../kjv/ch1008.htm#013)).

<span id="006">**Bernice**</span> Bearer of victory, the eldest daughter
of Agrippa I., the Herod Agrippa of [Act 12:20](../kjv/act012.htm#020).
After the early death of her first husband she was married to her uncle
Herod, king of Chalcis. After his death (A.D. 40) she lived in
incestuous connection with her brother Agrippa II. ([Act
25:13](../kjv/act025.htm#013), [Act 25:23](../kjv/act025.htm#023); [Act
26:30](../kjv/act026.htm#030)). They joined the Romans at the outbreak
of the final war between them and the Jews, and lived afterwards at
Rome.

<span id="007">**Berodach-baladan**</span> The king of Babylon who sent
a friendly deputation to Hezekiah ([Kg2 20:12](../kjv/kg2020.htm#012)).
In [Isa 39:1](../kjv/isa039.htm#001) he is called Merodach-baladan
(q.v.).

<span id="008">**Beryl**</span> The rendering in the Authorized Version
of the Hebrew word tarshish, a precious stone; probably so called as
being brought from Tarshish. It was one of the stones on the breastplate
of the high priest ([Exo 28:20](../kjv/exo028.htm#020); R.V. marg.,
"chalcedony;" [Exo 39:13](../kjv/exo039.htm#013)). The colour of the
wheels in Ezekiel's vision was as the colour of a beryl stone ([Eze
1:16](../kjv/eze001.htm#016); [Eze 10:9](../kjv/eze010.htm#009); R.V.,
"stone of Tarshish"). It is mentioned in [Sol
5:14](../kjv/sol005.htm#014); [Dan 10:6](../kjv/dan010.htm#006); [Rev
21:20](../kjv/rev021.htm#020). In [Eze 28:13](../kjv/eze028.htm#013) the
LXX. render the word by "chrysolite," which the Jewish historian
Josephus regards as its proper translation. This also is the rendering
given in the Authorized Version in the margin. That was a gold-coloured
gem the topaz of ancient authors.

<span id="009">**Besom**</span> The rendering of a Hebrew word meaning
sweeper, occurs only in [Isa 14:23](../kjv/isa014.htm#023), of the
sweeping away, the utter ruin, of Babylon.
