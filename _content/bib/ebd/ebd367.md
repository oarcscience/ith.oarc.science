<span id="000">**Timon**</span> Honouring, one of the seven deacons at
Jerusalem ([Act 6:5](../kjv/act006.htm#005)). Nothing further is known
of him.

<span id="001">**Timotheus**</span> The Greek form of the name of
Timothy ([Act 16:1](../kjv/act016.htm#001), etc.; the R.V. always
"Timothy").

<span id="002">**Timothy**</span> Honouring God, a young disciple who
was Paul's companion in many of his journeying. His mother, Eunice, and
his grandmother, Lois, are mentioned as eminent for their piety ([Ti2
1:5](../kjv/ti2001.htm#005)). We know nothing of his father but that he
was a Greek ([Act 16:1](../kjv/act016.htm#001)). He is first brought
into notice at the time of Paul's second visit to Lystra ([Act
16:2](../kjv/act016.htm#002)), where he probably resided, and where it
seems he was converted during Paul's first visit to that place ([Ti1
1:2](../kjv/ti1001.htm#002); [Ti2 3:11](../kjv/ti2003.htm#011)). The
apostle having formed a high opinion of his "own son in the faith,"
arranged that he should become his companion ([Act
16:3](../kjv/act016.htm#003)), and took and circumcised him, so that he
might conciliate the Jews. He was designated to the office of an
evangelist ([Ti1 4:14](../kjv/ti1004.htm#014)), and went with Paul in
his journey through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; also to Troas and
Philippi and Berea ([Act 17:14](../kjv/act017.htm#014)). Thence he
followed Paul to Athens, and was sent by him with Silas on a mission to
Thessalonica ([Act 17:15](../kjv/act017.htm#015); [Th1
3:2](../kjv/th1003.htm#002)). We next find him at Corinth ([Th1
1:1](../kjv/th1001.htm#001); [Th2 1:1](../kjv/th2001.htm#001)) with
Paul. He passes now out of sight for a few years, and is again noticed
as with the apostle at Ephesus ([Act 19:22](../kjv/act019.htm#022)),
whence he is sent on a mission into Macedonia. He accompanied Paul
afterwards into Asia ([Act 20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004)), where he was
with him for some time. When the apostle was a prisoner at Rome, Timothy
joined him ([Phi 1:1](../kjv/phi001.htm#001)), where it appears he also
suffered imprisonment ([Heb 13:23](../kjv/heb013.htm#023)). During the
apostle's second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy, asking him to rejoin
him as soon as possible, and to bring with him certain things which he
had left at Troas, his cloak and parchments ([Ti2
4:13](../kjv/ti2004.htm#013)). According to tradition, after the
apostle's death he settled in Ephesus as his sphere of labour, and there
found a martyr's grave.

<span id="003">**Timothy, First Epistle to**</span> Paul in this epistle
speaks of himself as having left Ephesus for Macedonia ([Ti1
1:3](../kjv/ti1001.htm#003)), and hence not Laodicea, as mentioned in
the subscription; but probably Philippi, or some other city in that
region, was the place where this epistle was written. During the
interval between his first and second imprisonments he probably visited
the scenes of his former labours in Greece and Asia, and then found his
way into Macedonia, whence he wrote this letter to Timothy, whom he had
left behind in Ephesus. It was probably written about A.D. 66 or 67. The
epistle consists mainly, (1.) of counsels to Timothy regarding the
worship and organization of the Church, and the responsibilities resting
on its several members; and (2.) of exhortation to faithfulness in
maintaining the truth amid surrounding errors.

<span id="004">**Timothy, Second Epistle to**</span> Was probably
written a year or so after the first, and from Rome, where Paul was for
a second time a prisoner, and was sent to Timothy by the hands of
Tychicus. In it he entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to
bring Mark with him (compare [Phi 2:22](../kjv/phi002.htm#022)). He was
anticipating that "the time of his departure was at hand" ([Ti2
4:6](../kjv/ti2004.htm#006)), and he exhorts his "son Timothy" to all
diligence and steadfastness, and to patience under persecution ([Ti2
1:6](../kjv/ti2001.htm#006)), and to a faithful discharge of all the
duties of his office ([Ti2 4:1](../kjv/ti2004.htm#001)), with all the
solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of quick and
dead.

<span id="005">**Tin**</span> Heb. bedil ([Num
31:22](../kjv/num031.htm#022); [Eze 22:18](../kjv/eze022.htm#018), [Eze
22:20](../kjv/eze022.htm#020)), a metal well known in ancient times. It
is the general opinion that the Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon obtained
their supplies of tin from the British Isles. In [Eze
27:12](../kjv/eze027.htm#012) it is said to have been brought from
Tarshish, which was probably a commercial emporium supplied with
commodities from other places. In [Isa 1:25](../kjv/isa001.htm#025) the
word so rendered is generally understood of lead, the alloy with which
the silver had become mixed ([Isa 1:22](../kjv/isa001.htm#022)). The
fire of the Babylonish Captivity would be the means of purging out the
idolatrous alloy that had corrupted the people.

<span id="006">**Tinkling Ornaments**</span> ([Isa
3:18](../kjv/isa003.htm#018)), anklets of silver or gold, etc., such as
are still used by women in Syria and the East.

<span id="007">**Tiphsah**</span> Passing over; ford, one of the
boundaries of Solomon's dominions ([Kg1 4:24](../kjv/kg1004.htm#024)),
probably "Thapsacus, a great and wealthy town on the western bank of the
Euphrates," about 100 miles north-east of Tadmor. All the land traffic
between the east and the west passed through it. Menahem undertook an
expedition against this city, and "smote Tiphsah and all that were
therein" ([Kg2 15:16](../kjv/kg2015.htm#016)). This expedition implied a
march of some 300 miles from Tirzah if by way of Tadmor, and about 400
if by way of Aleppo; and its success showed the strength of the
Israelite kingdom, for it was practically a defiance to Assyria. Conder,
however, identifies this place with Khurbet Tafsah, some 6 miles west of
Shechem.

<span id="008">**Tiras**</span> Tiras, the youngest of the sons of
Japheth ([Gen 10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002); [Ch1
1:5](../kjv/ch1001.htm#005)).

<span id="009">**Tires**</span> "To tire" the head is to adorn it ([Kg2
9:30](../kjv/kg2009.htm#030)). As a noun the word is derived from
"tiara," and is the rendering of the Heb. p'er , a "turban" or an
ornament for the head ([Eze 24:17](../kjv/eze024.htm#017); R.V., "head
tire;" [Eze 24:23](../kjv/eze024.htm#023)). In [Isa
3:18](../kjv/isa003.htm#018) the word saharonim is rendered "round tires
like the moon," and in [Jdg 8:21](../kjv/jdg008.htm#021), [Jdg
8:26](../kjv/jdg008.htm#026) "ornaments," but in both cases "crescents"
in the Revised Version.
