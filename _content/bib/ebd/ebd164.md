<span id="000">**Hareth**</span> Thicket, a wood in the mountains of
Judah where David hid when pursued by Saul ([Sa1
22:5](../kjv/sa1022.htm#005)). It was possibly while he was here that
the memorable incident narrated in [Sa2 23:14](../kjv/sa2023.htm#014),
[Ch1 11:16](../kjv/ch1011.htm#016) occurred. This place has not been
identified, but perhaps it may be the modern Kharas, on the borders of
the chain of mountains some 3 miles east of Keilah.

<span id="001">**Harhaiah**</span> Zeal of Jehovah, ([Neh
3:8](../kjv/neh003.htm#008)) "of the goldsmiths," one whose son helped
to repair the wall of Jerusalem.

<span id="002">**Harhur**</span> Fever, one of the Nethinim ([Ezr
2:51](../kjv/ezr002.htm#051)).

<span id="003">**Harim**</span> Flat-nosed. (1.) The head of the second
course of priests ([Ch1 24:8](../kjv/ch1024.htm#008)). (2.) [Ezr
2:32](../kjv/ezr002.htm#032), [Ezr 2:39](../kjv/ezr002.htm#039); [Neh
7:35](../kjv/neh007.htm#035), [Neh 7:42](../kjv/neh007.htm#042). (3.)
[Neh 3:11](../kjv/neh003.htm#011). (4.) [Neh
12:3](../kjv/neh012.htm#003). (5.) [Neh 10:5](../kjv/neh010.htm#005)

<span id="004">**Hariph**</span> Autumnal rain. (1.) [Neh
7:24](../kjv/neh007.htm#024). (2.) [Neh 10:19](../kjv/neh010.htm#019).

<span id="005">**Harlot**</span> (1.) Heb. zonah ([Gen
34:31](../kjv/gen034.htm#031); [Gen 38:15](../kjv/gen038.htm#015)). In
[Gen 38:21](../kjv/gen038.htm#021), [Gen 38:22](../kjv/gen038.htm#022)
the Hebrew word used in kedeshah, i.e., a woman consecrated or devoted
to prostitution in connection with the abominable worship of Asherah or
Astarte, the Syrian Venus. This word is also used in [Deu
23:17](../kjv/deu023.htm#017); [Hos 4:14](../kjv/hos004.htm#014). Thus
Tamar sat by the wayside as a consecrated kedeshah. It has been
attempted to show that Rahab, usually called a "harlot" ([Jos
2:1](../kjv/jos002.htm#001); [Jos 6:17](../kjv/jos006.htm#017); [Heb
11:31](../kjv/heb011.htm#031); [Jam 2:25](../kjv/jam002.htm#025)), was
only an innkeeper. This interpretation, however, cannot be maintained.
Jephthah's mother is called a "strange woman" ([Jdg
11:2](../kjv/jdg011.htm#002)). This, however, merely denotes that she
was of foreign extraction. In the time of Solomon harlots appeared
openly in the streets, and he solemnly warns against association with
them ([Pro 7:12](../kjv/pro007.htm#012); [Pro
9:14](../kjv/pro009.htm#014). See also [Jer 3:2](../kjv/jer003.htm#002);
[Eze 16:24](../kjv/eze016.htm#024), [Eze 16:25](../kjv/eze016.htm#025),
[Eze 16:31](../kjv/eze016.htm#031)). The Revised Version, following the
LXX., has "and the harlots washed," etc., instead of the rendering of
the Authorized Version, "now they washed," of [Kg1
22:38](../kjv/kg1022.htm#038). To commit fornication is metaphorically
used for to practice idolatry ([Jer 3:1](../kjv/jer003.htm#001); [Eze
16:15](../kjv/eze016.htm#015); Hos. throughout); hence Jerusalem is
spoken of as a harlot ([Isa 1:21](../kjv/isa001.htm#021)). (2.) Heb.
nokriyah , the "strange woman" ([Kg1 11:1](../kjv/kg1011.htm#001); [Pro
5:20](../kjv/pro005.htm#020); [Pro 7:5](../kjv/pro007.htm#005); [Pro
23:27](../kjv/pro023.htm#027)). Those so designated were Canaanites and
other Gentiles ([Jos 23:13](../kjv/jos023.htm#013)). To the same class
belonged the "foolish", i.e., the sinful, "woman." In the New Testament
the Greek pornai , plural, "harlots," occurs in [Mat
21:31](../kjv/mat021.htm#031), [Mat 21:32](../kjv/mat021.htm#032), where
they are classed with publicans; [Luk 15:30](../kjv/luk015.htm#030);
[Co1 6:15](../kjv/co1006.htm#015), [Co1 6:16](../kjv/co1006.htm#016);
[Heb 11:31](../kjv/heb011.htm#031); [Jam 2:25](../kjv/jam002.htm#025).
It is used symbolically in [Rev 17:1](../kjv/rev017.htm#001), [Rev
17:5](../kjv/rev017.htm#005), [Rev 17:15](../kjv/rev017.htm#015), [Rev
17:16](../kjv/rev017.htm#016); [Rev 19:2](../kjv/rev019.htm#002).

<span id="006">**Harnepher**</span> A chief of the tribe of Asher ([Ch1
7:36](../kjv/ch1007.htm#036)).

<span id="007">**Harness**</span> (1.) Heb. 'asar , "to bind;" hence the
act of fastening animals to a cart ([Sa1 6:7](../kjv/sa1006.htm#007),
[Sa1 6:10](../kjv/sa1006.htm#010); [Jer 46:4](../kjv/jer046.htm#004),
etc.). (2.) An Old English word for "armour;" Heb. neshek ([Ch2
9:24](../kjv/ch2009.htm#024)). (3.) Heb. shiryan , a coat of mail ([Kg1
22:34](../kjv/kg1022.htm#034); [Ch2 18:33](../kjv/ch2018.htm#033);
rendered "breastplate" in [Isa 59:17](../kjv/isa059.htm#017)). (4.) The
children of Israel passed out of Egypt "harnessed" ([Exo
13:18](../kjv/exo013.htm#018)), i.e., in an orderly manner, and as if to
meet a foe. The word so rendered is probably a derivative from Hebrew
hamesh (i.e., "five"), and may denote that they went up in five
divisions, viz., the van, centre, two wings, and rear-guard.

<span id="008">**Harod**</span> Palpitation, a fountain near which
Gideon and his army encamped on the morning of the day when they
encountered and routed the Midianites (Judg. 7). It was south of the
hill Moreh. The present 'Ain Jalud ("Goliath's Fountain"), south of
Jezreel and nearly opposite Shunem, is probably the fountain here
referred to ([Jdg 7:4](../kjv/jdg007.htm#004), [Jdg
7:5](../kjv/jdg007.htm#005)).

<span id="009">**Harodite**</span> An epithet applied to two of David's
heroes ([Sa2 23:25](../kjv/sa2023.htm#025)). (Compare [Ch1
11:27](../kjv/ch1011.htm#027).)
