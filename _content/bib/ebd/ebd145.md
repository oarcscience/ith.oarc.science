<span id="000">**Geder**</span> A walled place, ([Jos
12:13](../kjv/jos012.htm#013)), perhaps the same as Gederah or Gedor
([Jos 15:58](../kjv/jos015.htm#058)).

<span id="001">**Gederah**</span> The fortress; a fortified place, a
town in the plain (shephelah) of Judah ([Jos
15:36](../kjv/jos015.htm#036)). This is a very common Canaanite and
Phoenician name. It is the feminine form of Geder ([Jos
12:13](../kjv/jos012.htm#013)); the plural form is Gederoth ([Jos
15:41](../kjv/jos015.htm#041)). This place has by some been identified
with Jedireh, a ruin 9 miles from Lydda, toward Eleutheropolis, and 4
miles north of Sur'ah (Zorah), in the valley of Elah.

<span id="002">**Gederathite**</span> An epithet applied to Josabad, one
of David's warriors at Ziklag ([Ch1 12:4](../kjv/ch1012.htm#004)), a
native of Gederah.

<span id="003">**Gedor**</span> A wall. (1.) A city in the mountains or
hill country of Judah ([Jos 15:58](../kjv/jos015.htm#058)), identified
with Jedar, between Jerusalem and Hebron. (2.) [Ch1
4:39](../kjv/ch1004.htm#039), the Gederah of [Jos
15:36](../kjv/jos015.htm#036), or the well-known Gerar, as the LXX.
read, where the patriarchs of old had sojourned and fed their flocks
([Gen 20:1](../kjv/gen020.htm#001), [Gen 20:14](../kjv/gen020.htm#014),
[Gen 20:15](../kjv/gen020.htm#015); [Gen 26:1](../kjv/gen026.htm#001),
[Gen 26:6](../kjv/gen026.htm#006), [Gen 26:14](../kjv/gen026.htm#014)).
(3.) A town apparently in Benjamin ([Ch1 12:7](../kjv/ch1012.htm#007)),
the same probably as Geder ([Jos 12:13](../kjv/jos012.htm#013)).

<span id="004">**Gehazi**</span> Valley of vision, Elisha's trusted
servant ([Kg2 4:31](../kjv/kg2004.htm#031); [Kg2
5:25](../kjv/kg2005.htm#025); [Kg2 8:4](../kjv/kg2008.htm#004), [Kg2
8:5](../kjv/kg2008.htm#005)). He appears in connection with the history
of the Shunammite ([Kg2 4:14](../kjv/kg2004.htm#014), [Kg2
4:31](../kjv/kg2004.htm#031)) and of Naaman the Syrian. On this latter
occasion he was guilty of duplicity and dishonesty of conduct, causing
Elisha to denounce his crime with righteous sternness, and pass on him
the terrible doom that the leprosy of Naaman would cleave to him and his
for ever ([Kg2 5:20](../kjv/kg2005.htm#020)). He afterwards appeared
before king Joram, to whom he recounted the great deeds of his master
([Kg2 8:1](../kjv/kg2008.htm#001)).

<span id="005">**Gehenna**</span> (originally Ge bene Hinnom; i.e., "the
valley of the sons of Hinnom"), a deep, narrow glen to the south of
Jerusalem, where the idolatrous Jews offered their children in sacrifice
to Molech ([Ch2 28:3](../kjv/ch2028.htm#003); [Ch2
33:6](../kjv/ch2033.htm#006); [Jer 7:31](../kjv/jer007.htm#031); [Jer
19:2](../kjv/jer019.htm#002)). This valley afterwards became the common
receptacle for all the refuse of the city. Here the dead bodies of
animals and of criminals, and all kinds of filth, were cast and consumed
by fire kept always burning. It thus in process of time became the image
of the place of everlasting destruction. In this sense it is used by our
Lord in [Mat 5:22](../kjv/mat005.htm#022), [Mat
5:29](../kjv/mat005.htm#029), [Mat 5:30](../kjv/mat005.htm#030); [Mat
10:28](../kjv/mat010.htm#028); [Mat 18:9](../kjv/mat018.htm#009); [Mat
23:15](../kjv/mat023.htm#015), [Mat 23:33](../kjv/mat023.htm#033); [Mar
9:43](../kjv/mar009.htm#043), [Mar 9:45](../kjv/mar009.htm#045), [Mar
9:47](../kjv/mar009.htm#047); [Luk 12:5](../kjv/luk012.htm#005). In
these passages, and also in [Jam 3:6](../kjv/jam003.htm#006), the word
is uniformly rendered "hell," the Revised Version placing "Gehenna" in
the margin. (See HELL; HINNOM.)

<span id="006">**Geliloth**</span> Circles; regions, a place in the
border of Benjamin ([Jos 18:17](../kjv/jos018.htm#017)); called Gilgal
in [Jos 15:7](../kjv/jos015.htm#007).

<span id="007">**Gemariah**</span> Jehovah has made perfect. (1.) The
son of Shaphan, and one of the Levites of the temple in the time of
Jehoiakim ([Jer 36:10](../kjv/jer036.htm#010); [Kg2
22:12](../kjv/kg2022.htm#012)). Baruch read aloud to the people from
Gemariah's chamber, and again in the hearing of Gemariah and other
scribes, the prophecies of Jeremiah ([Jer
36:11](../kjv/jer036.htm#011)), which filled him with terror. He joined
with others in entreating the king not to destroy the roll of the
prophecies which Baruch had read (Jer. 21-25). (2.) The son of Hilkiah,
who accompanied Shaphan with the tribute-money from Zedekiah to
Nebuchadnezzar, and was the bearer at the same time of a letter from
Jeremiah to the Jewish captives at Babylon ([Jer
29:3](../kjv/jer029.htm#003), [Jer 29:4](../kjv/jer029.htm#004)).

<span id="008">**Generation**</span> [Gen 2:4](../kjv/gen002.htm#004),
"These are the generations," means the "history." [Gen
5:1](../kjv/gen005.htm#001), "The book of the generations," means a
family register, or history of Adam. [Gen 37:2](../kjv/gen037.htm#002),
"The generations of Jacob" = the history of Jacob and his descendants.
[Gen 7:1](../kjv/gen007.htm#001), "In this generation" = in this age.
[Psa 49:19](../kjv/psa049.htm#019), "The generation of his fathers" =
the dwelling of his fathers, i.e., the grave. [Psa
73:15](../kjv/psa073.htm#015), "The generation of thy children" = the
contemporary race. [Isa 53:8](../kjv/isa053.htm#008), "Who shall declare
his generation?" = His manner of life who shall declare? or rather = His
race, posterity, shall be so numerous that no one shall be able to
declare it. In [Mat 1:17](../kjv/mat001.htm#017), the word means a
succession or series of persons from the same stock. [Mat
3:7](../kjv/mat003.htm#007), "Generation of vipers" = brood of vipers.
[Mat 24:34](../kjv/mat024.htm#034), "This generation" = the persons then
living contemporary with Christ. [Pe1 2:9](../kjv/pe1002.htm#009), "A
chosen generation" = a chosen people. The Hebrews seem to have reckoned
time by the generation. In the time of Abraham a generation was an
hundred years, thus: [Gen 15:16](../kjv/gen015.htm#016), "In the fourth
generation" = in four hundred years (compare [Gen
15:13](../kjv/gen015.htm#013) and [Exo 12:40](../kjv/exo012.htm#040)).
In [Deu 1:35](../kjv/deu001.htm#035) and [Deu
2:14](../kjv/deu002.htm#014) a generation is a period of thirty-eight
years.

<span id="009">**Genesis**</span> The five books of Moses were
collectively called the Pentateuch, a word of Greek origin meaning "the
five-fold book." The Jews called them the Torah, i.e., "the law." It is
probable that the division of the Torah into five books proceeded from
the Greek translators of the Old Testament. The names by which these
several books are generally known are Greek. The first book of the
Pentateuch (q.v.) is called by the Jews Bereshith, i.e., "in the
beginning", because this is the first word of the book. It is generally
known among Christians by the name of Genesis, i.e., "creation" or
"generation," being the name given to it in the LXX. as designating its
character, because it gives an account of the origin of all things. It
contains, according to the usual computation, the history of about two
thousand three hundred and sixty-nine years. Genesis is divided into two
principal parts. The first part (Gen. 1 - 11) gives a general history of
mankind down to the time of the Dispersion. The second part presents the
early history of Israel down to the death and burial of Joseph (Gen. 12
- 50). There are five principal persons brought in succession under our
notice in this book, and around these persons the history of the
successive periods is grouped, viz., Adam (Gen. 1 - 3), Noah (Gen. 4 -
9), Abraham (Gen. 10 - 25:18), Isaac (Gen. 25:19 - 35:29), and Jacob
(Gen. 36 - 50). In this book we have several prophecies concerning
Christ ([Gen 3:15](../kjv/gen003.htm#015); [Gen
12:3](../kjv/gen012.htm#003); [Gen 18:18](../kjv/gen018.htm#018); [Gen
22:18](../kjv/gen022.htm#018); [Gen 26:4](../kjv/gen026.htm#004); [Gen
28:14](../kjv/gen028.htm#014); [Gen 49:10](../kjv/gen049.htm#010)). The
author of this book was Moses. Under divine guidance he may indeed have
been led to make use of materials already existing in primeval
documents, or even of traditions in a trustworthy form that had come
down to his time, purifying them from all that was unworthy; but the
hand of Moses is clearly seen throughout in its composition.
