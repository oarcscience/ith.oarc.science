<span id="000">**Horem**</span> Consecrated, one of the fenced cities of
Naphtali ([Jos 19:38](../kjv/jos019.htm#038)).

<span id="001">**Horites**</span> Cave-men, a race of Troglodytes who
dwelt in the limestone caves which abounded in Edom. Their ancestor was
"Seir," who probably gave his name to the district where he lived. They
were a branch of the Hivites ([Gen 14:6](../kjv/gen014.htm#006); [Gen
36:20](../kjv/gen036.htm#020); [Ch1 1:38](../kjv/ch1001.htm#038), [Ch1
1:39](../kjv/ch1001.htm#039)). They were dispossessed by the descendants
of Esau, and as a people gradually became extinct ([Deu
2:12](../kjv/deu002.htm#012)).

<span id="002">**Hormah**</span> Banning; i.e., placing under a "ban,"
or devoting to utter destruction. After the manifestation of God's anger
against the Israelites, on account of their rebellion and their
murmurings when the spies returned to the camp at Kadesh, in the
wilderness of Paran, with an evil report of the land, they quickly
repented of their conduct, and presumed to go up "to the head of the
mountain," seeking to enter the Promised Land, but without the presence
of the Lord, without the ark of the covenant, and without Moses. The
Amalekites and the Canaanites came down and "smote and discomfited them
even unto Hormah" ([Num 14:45](../kjv/num014.htm#045)). This place, or
perhaps the watch-tower commanding it, was originally called Zephath
([Jdg 1:17](../kjv/jdg001.htm#017)), the modern Sebaiteh. Afterwards
([Num 21:1](../kjv/num021.htm#001)) Arad, the king of the Canaanites, at
the close of the wanderings, when the Israelites were a second time
encamped at Kadesh, "fought against them, and took some of them
prisoners." But Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord utterly to destroy the
cities of the Canaanites; they "banned" them, and hence the place was
now called Hormah. But this "ban" was not fully executed till the time
of Joshua, who finally conquered the king of this district, so that the
ancient name Zephath became "Hormah" ([Jos
12:14](../kjv/jos012.htm#014); [Jdg 1:17](../kjv/jdg001.htm#017)).

<span id="003">**Horn**</span> Trumpets were at first horns perforated
at the tip, used for various purposes ([Jos 6:4](../kjv/jos006.htm#004),
[Jos 6:5](../kjv/jos006.htm#005)). Flasks or vessels were made of horn
([Sa1 16:1](../kjv/sa1016.htm#001), [Sa1 16:13](../kjv/sa1016.htm#013);
[Kg1 1:39](../kjv/kg1001.htm#039)). But the word is used also
metaphorically to denote the projecting corners of the altar of burnt
offerings ([Exo 27:2](../kjv/exo027.htm#002)) and of incense ([Exo
30:2](../kjv/exo030.htm#002)). The horns of the altar of burnt offerings
were to be smeared with the blood of the slain bullock ([Exo
29:12](../kjv/exo029.htm#012); [Lev 4:7](../kjv/lev004.htm#007)). The
criminal, when his crime was accidental, found an asylum by laying hold
of the horns of the altar ([Kg1 1:50](../kjv/kg1001.htm#050); [Kg1
2:28](../kjv/kg1002.htm#028)). The word also denotes the peak or summit
of a hill ([Isa 5:1](../kjv/isa005.htm#001), where the word "hill" is
the rendering of the same Hebrew word). This word is used metaphorically
also for strength ([Deu 33:17](../kjv/deu033.htm#017)) and honour ([Job
16:15](../kjv/job016.htm#015); [Lam 2:3](../kjv/lam002.htm#003)). Horns
are emblems of power, dominion, glory, and fierceness, as they are the
chief means of attack and defense with the animals endowed with them
([Dan 8:5](../kjv/dan008.htm#005), [Dan 8:9](../kjv/dan008.htm#009);
[Sa1 2:1](../kjv/sa1002.htm#001); [Sa1 16:1](../kjv/sa1016.htm#001),
[Sa1 16:13](../kjv/sa1016.htm#013); [Kg1 1:39](../kjv/kg1001.htm#039);
[Kg1 22:11](../kjv/kg1022.htm#011); [Jos 6:4](../kjv/jos006.htm#004),
[Jos 6:5](../kjv/jos006.htm#005); [Psa 75:5](../kjv/psa075.htm#005),
[Psa 75:10](../kjv/psa075.htm#010); [Psa 132:17](../kjv/psa132.htm#017);
[Luk 1:69](../kjv/luk001.htm#069), etc.). The expression "horn of
salvation," applied to Christ, means a salvation of strength, or a
strong Saviour ([Luk 1:69](../kjv/luk001.htm#069)). To have the horn
"exalted" denotes prosperity and triumph ([Psa
89:17](../kjv/psa089.htm#017), [Psa 89:24](../kjv/psa089.htm#024)). To
"lift up" the horn is to act proudly ([Zac
1:21](../kjv/zac001.htm#021)). Horns are also the symbol of royal
dignity and power ([Jer 48:25](../kjv/jer048.htm#025); [Zac
1:18](../kjv/zac001.htm#018); [Dan 8:24](../kjv/dan008.htm#024)).

<span id="004">**Hornet**</span> Heb. tsir'ah , "stinging", ([Exo
23:28](../kjv/exo023.htm#028); [Deu 7:20](../kjv/deu007.htm#020); [Jos
24:12](../kjv/jos024.htm#012)). The word is used in these passages as
referring to some means by which the Canaanites were to be driven out
from before the Israelites. Some have supposed that the word is used in
a metaphorical sense as the symbol of some panic which would seize the
people as a "terror of God" ([Gen 35:5](../kjv/gen035.htm#005)), the
consternation with which God would inspire the Canaanites. In Palestine
there are four species of hornets, differing from our hornets, being
larger in size, and they are very abundant. They "attack human beings in
a very furious manner." "The furious attack of a swarm of hornets drives
cattle and horses to madness, and has even caused the death of the
animals."

<span id="005">**Horonaim**</span> Two caverns, a city of Moab to the
south of the Arnon, built, apparently, upon an eminence, and a place of
some importance ([Isa 15:5](../kjv/isa015.htm#005); [Jer
48:3](../kjv/jer048.htm#003), [Jer 48:5](../kjv/jer048.htm#005), [Jer
48:34](../kjv/jer048.htm#034)).

<span id="006">**Horonite**</span> The designation of Sanballat ([Neh
2:10](../kjv/neh002.htm#010), [Neh 2:19](../kjv/neh002.htm#019)), a
native of Horonaim, or of one of the two Beth-horons, the "upper" or the
"nether," mentioned in [Jos 16:3](../kjv/jos016.htm#003), [Jos
16:5](../kjv/jos016.htm#005).

<span id="007">**Horse**</span> Always referred to in the Bible in
connection with warlike operations, except [Isa
28:28](../kjv/isa028.htm#028). The war-horse is described [Job
39:19](../kjv/job039.htm#019). For a long period after their settlement
in Canaan the Israelites made no use of horses, according to the
prohibition, [Deu 17:16](../kjv/deu017.htm#016). David was the first to
form a force of cavalry ([Sa2 8:4](../kjv/sa2008.htm#004)). But Solomon,
from his connection with Egypt, greatly multiplied their number ([Kg1
4:26](../kjv/kg1004.htm#026); [Kg1 10:26](../kjv/kg1010.htm#026), [Kg1
10:29](../kjv/kg1010.htm#029)). After this, horses were freely used in
Israel ([Kg1 22:4](../kjv/kg1022.htm#004); [Kg2
3:7](../kjv/kg2003.htm#007); [Kg2 9:21](../kjv/kg2009.htm#021), [Kg2
9:33](../kjv/kg2009.htm#033); [Kg2 11:16](../kjv/kg2011.htm#016)). The
furniture of the horse consisted simply of a bridle ([Isa
30:28](../kjv/isa030.htm#028)) and a curb ([Psa
32:9](../kjv/psa032.htm#009)).

<span id="008">**Horse-gate**</span> A gate in the wall of Jerusalem, at
the west end of the bridge, leading from Zion to the temple ([Neh
3:28](../kjv/neh003.htm#028); [Jer 31:40](../kjv/jer031.htm#040)).

<span id="009">**Horse-leech**</span> Occurs only in [Pro
30:15](../kjv/pro030.htm#015) (Heb. 'alukah ); the generic name for any
blood-sucking annelid. There are various species in the marshes and
pools of Palestine. That here referred to, the Hoemopis, is remarkable
for the coarseness of its bite, and is therefore not used for medical
purposes. They are spoken of in the East with feelings of aversion and
horror, because of their propensity to fasten on the tongue and nostrils
of horses when they come to drink out of the pools. The medicinal leech
(Hirudo medicinalis), besides other species of leeches, are common in
the waters of Syria.
