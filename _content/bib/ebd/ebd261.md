<span id="000">**Mount of the Congregation**</span> Only in [Isa
14:13](../kjv/isa014.htm#013), a mythic mountain of the Babylonians,
regarded by them as the seat of the gods. It was situated in the far
north, and in Babylonian inscriptions is described as a mountain called
Im-Kharasak, "the mighty mountain of Bel, whose head reaches heaven,
whose root is the holy deep." In their geography they are said to have
identified it with mount Elwend, near Ecbatana.

<span id="001">**Mount of the Valley**</span> [Jos
13:19](../kjv/jos013.htm#019)), a district in the east of Jordan, in the
territory of Reuben. The "valley" here was probably the Ghor or valley
of the Jordan, and hence the "mount" would be the hilly region in the
north end of the Dead Sea. (See ZARETH-SHAHAR.)

<span id="002">**Mount of Corruption**</span> ([Kg2
23:13](../kjv/kg2023.htm#013); Vulg., "mount of offense"), the name
given to a part of the Mount of Olives, so called because idol temples
were there erected in the time of Solomon, temples to the Zidonian
Ashtoreth and to the "abominations" of Moab and Ammon.

<span id="003">**Mount of Beatitudes**</span> See SERMON ON THE MOUNT.

<span id="004">**Mourn**</span> Frequent references are found in
Scripture to, (1.) Mourning for the dead. Abraham mourned for Sarah
([Gen 23:2](../kjv/gen023.htm#002)); Jacob for Joseph ([Gen
37:34](../kjv/gen037.htm#034), [Gen 37:35](../kjv/gen037.htm#035)); the
Egyptians for Jacob ([Gen 50:3](../kjv/gen050.htm#003)); Israel for
Aaron ([Num 20:29](../kjv/num020.htm#029)), for Moses ([Deu
34:8](../kjv/deu034.htm#008)), and for Samuel ([Sa1
25:1](../kjv/sa1025.htm#001)); David for Abner ([Sa2
3:31](../kjv/sa2003.htm#031), [Sa2 3:35](../kjv/sa2003.htm#035)); Mary
and Martha for Lazarus (John 11); devout men for Stephen ([Act
8:2](../kjv/act008.htm#002)), etc. (2.) For calamities, Job ([Job
1:20](../kjv/job001.htm#020), [Job 1:21](../kjv/job001.htm#021); [Job
2:8](../kjv/job002.htm#008)); Israel ([Exo
33:4](../kjv/exo033.htm#004)); the Ninevites ([Jon
3:5](../kjv/jon003.htm#005)); Israel, when defeated by Benjamin ([Jdg
20:26](../kjv/jdg020.htm#026)), etc. (3.) Penitential mourning, by the
Israelites on the day of atonement ([Lev 23:27](../kjv/lev023.htm#027);
[Act 27:9](../kjv/act027.htm#009)); under Samuel's ministry ([Sa1
7:6](../kjv/sa1007.htm#006)); predicted in Zechariah ([Zac
12:10](../kjv/zac012.htm#010), [Zac 12:11](../kjv/zac012.htm#011)); in
many of the psalms (Ps. 51, etc.). Mourning was expressed, (1.) by
weeping ([Gen 35:8](../kjv/gen035.htm#008), marg.; [Luk
7:38](../kjv/luk007.htm#038), etc.); (2.) by loud lamentation ([Rut
1:9](../kjv/rut001.htm#009); [Sa1 6:19](../kjv/sa1006.htm#019); [Sa2
3:31](../kjv/sa2003.htm#031)); (3.) by the disfigurement of the person,
as rending the clothes ([Gen 37:29](../kjv/gen037.htm#029), [Gen
37:34](../kjv/gen037.htm#034); [Mat 26:65](../kjv/mat026.htm#065)),
wearing sackcloth ([Gen 37:34](../kjv/gen037.htm#034); [Psa
35:13](../kjv/psa035.htm#013)), sprinkling dust or ashes on the person
([Sa2 13:19](../kjv/sa2013.htm#019); [Jer 6:26](../kjv/jer006.htm#026);
[Job 2:12](../kjv/job002.htm#012)), shaving the head and plucking out
the hair of the head or beard ([Lev 10:6](../kjv/lev010.htm#006); [Job
1:20](../kjv/job001.htm#020)), neglect of the person or the removal of
ornaments ([Exo 33:4](../kjv/exo033.htm#004); [Deu
21:12](../kjv/deu021.htm#012), [Deu 21:13](../kjv/deu021.htm#013); [Sa2
14:2](../kjv/sa2014.htm#002); [Sa2 19:24](../kjv/sa2019.htm#024); [Mat
6:16](../kjv/mat006.htm#016), [Mat 6:17](../kjv/mat006.htm#017)),
fasting ([Sa2 1:12](../kjv/sa2001.htm#012)), covering the upper lip
([Lev 13:45](../kjv/lev013.htm#045); [Mic 3:7](../kjv/mic003.htm#007)),
cutting the flesh ([Jer 16:6](../kjv/jer016.htm#006), [Jer
16:7](../kjv/jer016.htm#007)), and sitting in silence ([Jdg
20:26](../kjv/jdg020.htm#026); [Sa2 12:16](../kjv/sa2012.htm#016); [Sa2
13:31](../kjv/sa2013.htm#031); [Job 1:20](../kjv/job001.htm#020)). In
the later times we find a class of mourners who could be hired to give
by their loud lamentation the external tokens of sorrow ([Ch2
35:25](../kjv/ch2035.htm#025); [Jer 9:17](../kjv/jer009.htm#017); [Mat
9:23](../kjv/mat009.htm#023)). The period of mourning for the dead
varied. For Jacob it was seventy days ([Gen
50:3](../kjv/gen050.htm#003)); for Aaron ([Num
20:29](../kjv/num020.htm#029)) and Moses ([Deu
34:8](../kjv/deu034.htm#008)) thirty days; and for Saul only seven days
([Sa1 31:13](../kjv/sa1031.htm#013)). In [Sa2
3:31](../kjv/sa2003.htm#031), we have a description of the great
mourning for the death of Abner.

<span id="005">**Mouse**</span> Heb. 'akhbar , "swift digger"), properly
the dormouse, the field-mouse ([Sa1 6:4](../kjv/sa1006.htm#004)). In
[Lev 11:29](../kjv/lev011.htm#029), [Isa 66:17](../kjv/isa066.htm#017)
this word is used generically, and includes the jerboa (Mus jaculus),
rat, hamster (Cricetus), which, though declared to be unclean animals,
were eaten by the Arabs, and are still eaten by the Bedouins. It is said
that no fewer than twenty-three species of this group ( 'akhbar = Arab.
ferah ) of animals inhabit Palestine. God "laid waste" the people of
Ashdod by the terrible visitation of field-mice, which are like locusts
in their destructive effects ([Sa1 6:4](../kjv/sa1006.htm#004), [Sa1
6:11](../kjv/sa1006.htm#011), [Sa1 6:18](../kjv/sa1006.htm#018)).
Herodotus, the Greek historian, accounts for the destruction of the army
of Sennacherib ([Kg2 19:35](../kjv/kg2019.htm#035)) by saying that in
the night thousands of mice invaded the camp and gnawed through the
bow-strings, quivers, and shields, and thus left the Assyrians helpless.
(See SENNACHERIB.)

<span id="006">**Mowing**</span> Heb. gez ), rendered in [Psa
72:6](../kjv/psa072.htm#006) "mown grass." The expression "king's
mowings" ([Amo 7:1](../kjv/amo007.htm#001)) refers to some royal right
of early pasturage, the first crop of grass for the cavalry (Compare
[Kg1 18:5](../kjv/kg1018.htm#005)).

<span id="007">**Moza**</span> A going forth. (1.) One of the sons of
Caleb ([Ch1 2:46](../kjv/ch1002.htm#046)). (2.) The son of Zimri, of the
posterity of Saul ([Ch1 8:36](../kjv/ch1008.htm#036), [Ch1
8:37](../kjv/ch1008.htm#037); [Ch1 9:42](../kjv/ch1009.htm#042), [Ch1
9:43](../kjv/ch1009.htm#043)).

<span id="008">**Mozah**</span> An issuing of water, a city of Benjamin
([Jos 18:26](../kjv/jos018.htm#026)).

<span id="009">**Mufflers**</span> [Isa 3:19](../kjv/isa003.htm#019)),
veils, light and tremulous. Margin, "spangled ornaments."
