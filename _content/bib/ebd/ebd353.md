<span id="000">**Sukkiims**</span> Dwellers in tents, (Vulg. and LXX.,
"troglodites;" i.e., cave-dwellers in the hills along the Red Sea).
Shiskak's army, with which he marched against Jerusalem, was composed
partly of this tribe ([Ch2 12:3](../kjv/ch2012.htm#003)).

<span id="001">**Sun**</span> (Heb. shemesh ), first mentioned along
with the moon as the two great luminaries of heaven ([Gen
1:14](../kjv/gen001.htm#014)). By their motions and influence they were
intended to mark and divide times and seasons. The worship of the sun
was one of the oldest forms of false religion ([Job
31:26](../kjv/job031.htm#026), [Job 31:27](../kjv/job031.htm#027)), and
was common among the Egyptians and Chaldeans and other pagan nations.
The Jews were warned against this form of idolatry ([Deu
4:19](../kjv/deu004.htm#019); [Deu 17:3](../kjv/deu017.htm#003); compare
[Kg2 23:11](../kjv/kg2023.htm#011); [Jer 19:13](../kjv/jer019.htm#013)).

<span id="002">**Suph**</span> ([Deu 1:1](../kjv/deu001.htm#001), R.V.;
marg., "some ancient versions have the Red Sea," as in the A.V.). Some
identify it with Suphah ([Num 21:14](../kjv/num021.htm#014), marg.,
A.V.) as probably the name of a place. Others identify it with es -
Sufah = Maaleh-acrabbim ([Jos 15:3](../kjv/jos015.htm#003)), and others
again with Zuph ([Sa1 9:5](../kjv/sa1009.htm#005)). It is most probable,
however, that, in accordance with the ancient versions, this word is to
be regarded as simply an abbreviation of Yam-suph, i.e., the "Red Sea."

<span id="003">**Suphah**</span> ([Num 21:14](../kjv/num021.htm#014),
marg.; also R.V.), a place at the south-eastern corner of the Dead Sea,
the Ghor es-Safieh. This name is found in an ode quoted from the "Book
of the Wars of the Lord," probably a collection of odes commemorating
the triumphs of God's people (compare [Num
21:14](../kjv/num021.htm#014), [Num 21:17](../kjv/num021.htm#017), [Num
21:18](../kjv/num021.htm#018), [Num 21:27](../kjv/num021.htm#027)).

<span id="004">**Supper**</span> The principal meal of the day among the
Jews. It was partaken of in the early part of the evening ([Mar
6:21](../kjv/mar006.htm#021); [Joh 12:2](../kjv/joh012.htm#002); [Co1
11:21](../kjv/co1011.htm#021)). (See LORD'S SUPPER.)

<span id="005">**Surety**</span> One who becomes responsible for
another. Christ is the surety of the better covenant ([Heb
7:22](../kjv/heb007.htm#022)). In him we have the assurance that all its
provisions will be fully and faithfully carried out. Solomon warns
against incautiously becoming security for another ([Pro
6:1](../kjv/pro006.htm#001); [Pro 11:15](../kjv/pro011.htm#015); [Pro
17:18](../kjv/pro017.htm#018); [Pro 20:16](../kjv/pro020.htm#016)).

<span id="006">**Susanchites**</span> The inhabitants of Shushan, who
joined the other adversaries of the Jews in the attempt to prevent the
rebuilding of the temple ([Ezr 4:9](../kjv/ezr004.htm#009)).

<span id="007">**Susanna**</span> Lily, with other pious women,
ministered to Jesus ([Luk 8:3](../kjv/luk008.htm#003)).

<span id="008">**Susi**</span> The father of Gaddi, who was one of the
twelve spies ([Num 13:11](../kjv/num013.htm#011)).

<span id="009">**Swallow**</span> (1.) Heb. sis ([Isa
38:14](../kjv/isa038.htm#014); [Jer 8:7](../kjv/jer008.htm#007)), the
Arabic for the swift, which "is a regular migrant, returning in myriads
every spring, and so suddenly that while one day not a swift can be seen
in the country, on the next they have over-spread the whole land, and
fill the air with their shrill cry." The swift (cypselus) is ordinarily
classed with the swallow, which it resembles in its flight, habits, and
migration. (2.) Heb. deror , i.e., "the bird of freedom" ([Psa
84:3](../kjv/psa084.htm#003); [Pro 26:2](../kjv/pro026.htm#002)),
properly rendered swallow, distinguished for its swiftness of flight,
its love of freedom, and the impossibility of retaining it in captivity.
In [Isa 38:14](../kjv/isa038.htm#014) and [Jer
8:7](../kjv/jer008.htm#007) the word thus rendered ( 'augr ) properly
means "crane" (as in the R.V.).
