<span id="000">**Dinhabah**</span> Robbers' den, an Edomitish city, the
capital of king Bela ([Gen 36:32](../kjv/gen036.htm#032)). It is
probably the modern Dibdiba, a little north-east of Petra.

<span id="001">**Dionysius**</span> The Areopagite, one of Paul's
converts at Athens ([Act 17:34](../kjv/act017.htm#034)).

<span id="002">**Diotrephes**</span> Jove-nourished, rebuked by John for
his pride ([Jo3 1:9](../kjv/jo3001.htm#009)). He was a Judaizer, prating
against John and his fellow-labourers "with malicious words" ([Jo3
1:7](../kjv/jo3001.htm#007)).

<span id="003">**Disciple**</span> A scholar, sometimes applied to the
followers of John the Baptist ([Mat 9:14](../kjv/mat009.htm#014)), and
of the Pharisees ([Mat 22:16](../kjv/mat022.htm#016)), but principally
to the followers of Christ. A disciple of Christ is one who (1.)
believes His doctrine, (2.) rests on His sacrifice, (3.) imbibes His
spirit, and (4.) imitates His example ([Mat
10:24](../kjv/mat010.htm#024); [Luk 14:26](../kjv/luk014.htm#026), [Luk
14:27](../kjv/luk014.htm#027), [Luk 14:33](../kjv/luk014.htm#033); [Joh
6:69](../kjv/joh006.htm#069)).

<span id="004">**Dish**</span> For eating from ([Kg2
21:13](../kjv/kg2021.htm#013)). Judas dipped his hand with a "sop" or
piece of bread in the same dish with our Lord, thereby indicating
friendly intimacy ([Mat 26:23](../kjv/mat026.htm#023)). The "lordly
dish" in [Jdg 5:25](../kjv/jdg005.htm#025) was probably the shallow
drinking cup, usually of brass. In [Jdg 6:38](../kjv/jdg006.htm#038) the
same Hebrew word is rendered "bowl." The dishes of the tabernacle were
made of pure gold ([Exo 25:29](../kjv/exo025.htm#029); [Exo
37:16](../kjv/exo037.htm#016)).

<span id="005">**Dishan**</span> Antelope, the youngest son of Seir the
Horite, head of one of the tribes of Idumaea ([Gen
36:21](../kjv/gen036.htm#021), [Gen 36:28](../kjv/gen036.htm#028), [Gen
36:30](../kjv/gen036.htm#030)).

<span id="006">**Dispensation**</span> (Gr. oikonomia , "management,"
"economy"). (1.) The method or scheme according to which God carries out
his purposes towards men is called a dispensation. There are usually
reckoned three dispensations, the Patriarchal, the Mosaic or Jewish, and
the Christian. (See COVENANT, ADMINISTRATION OF). These were so many
stages in God's unfolding of his purpose of grace toward men. The word
is not found with this meaning in Scripture. (2.) A commission to preach
the gospel ([Co1 9:17](../kjv/co1009.htm#017); [Eph
1:10](../kjv/eph001.htm#010); [Eph 3:2](../kjv/eph003.htm#002); [Col
1:25](../kjv/col001.htm#025)). Dispensations of Providence are
providential events which affect men either in the way of mercy or of
judgment.

<span id="007">**Dispersion**</span> (1.) (Gr. diaspora , "scattered,"
[Jam 1:1](../kjv/jam001.htm#001); [Pe1 1:1](../kjv/pe1001.htm#001)) of
the Jews. At various times, and from the operation of divers causes, the
Jews were separated and scattered into foreign countries "to the
out-most parts of heaven" ([Deu 30:4](../kjv/deu030.htm#004)). (a.) Many
were dispersed over Assyria, Media, Babylonia, and Persia, descendants
of those who had been transported thither by the Exile. The ten tribes,
after existing as a separate kingdom for two hundred and fifty-five
years, were carried captive (721 B.C.) by Shalmaneser (or Sargon), king
of Assyria. They never returned to their own land as a distinct people,
although many individuals from among these tribes, there can be no
doubt, joined with the bands that returned from Babylon on the
proclamation of Cyrus. See map, The Table of Nations (b.) Many Jews
migrated to Egypt and took up their abode there. This migration began in
the days of Solomon ([Kg2 18:21](../kjv/kg2018.htm#021), [Kg2
18:24](../kjv/kg2018.htm#024); [Isa 30:7](../kjv/isa030.htm#007)).
Alexander the Great placed a large number of Jews in Alexandria, which
he had founded, and conferred on them equal rights with the Egyptians.
Ptolemy Philadelphus, it is said, caused the Jewish Scriptures to be
translated into Greek (the work began 284 B.C.), for the use of the
Alexandrian Jews. The Jews in Egypt continued for many ages to exercise
a powerful influence on the public interests of that country. From Egypt
they spread along the coast of Africa to Cyrene ([Act
2:10](../kjv/act002.htm#010)) and to Ethiopia ([Act
8:27](../kjv/act008.htm#027)). (c.) After the time of Seleucus Nicator
(280 B.C.), one of the captains of Alexander the Great, large numbers of
Jews migrated into Syria, where they enjoyed equal rights with the
Macedonians. From Syria they found their way into Asia Minor. Antiochus
the Great, king of Syria and Asia, removed 3,000 families of Jews from
Mesopotamia and Babylonia, and planted them in Phrygia and Lydia. (d.)
From Asia Minor many Jews moved into Greece and Macedonia, chiefly for
purposes of commerce. In the apostles' time they were found in
considerable numbers in all the principal cities. From the time of
Pompey the Great (B.C. 63) numbers of Jews from Palestine and Greece
went to Rome, where they had a separate quarter of the city assigned to
them. Here they enjoyed considerable freedom. Thus were the Jews
everywhere scattered abroad. This, in the overruling providence of God,
ultimately contributed in a great degree toward opening the way for the
spread of the gospel into all lands. (2.)From the plain of Shinar This
was occasioned by the confusion of tongues at Babel ([Gen
11:9](../kjv/gen011.htm#009)). They were scattered abroad "every one
after his tongue, after their families, in their nations" ([Gen
10:5](../kjv/gen010.htm#005), [Gen 10:20](../kjv/gen010.htm#020), [Gen
10:31](../kjv/gen010.htm#031)). The tenth chapter of Genesis gives us an
account of the principal nations of the earth in their migrations from
the plain of Shinar, which was their common residence after the Flood.
In general, it may be said that the descendants of Japheth were
scattered over the north, those of Shem over the central regions, and
those of Ham over the extreme south. See table showing how the different
families were dispersed: Japheth Families scattered to the north Gomer
Magog Madai Javan Tubal Meshech Tiras Cimmerians and Armenians
Caucasians and Scythians Medes and some Persian tribes The Tibareni and
the Tartars The Moschi and the Muscovites The Thracians Elishah Tarshish
Chittim Dodanim The Greeks Etruscans and Romans Cyprians and Macedonians
The Rhodians Shem Families scattered to the central regions Elam Asshur
Arphaxad Lud Aram Some Persian tribes Assyrian founders of Nineveh,
Rehoboth, Calneh and Resen Abraham The Lydians The Syrians Isaac Ishmael
Jacob Esau The Hebrews The Edomites The Ishmaelites, who mingled with
the Arab tribes descended from Joktan, in the line of Eber, from
Arphaxad Ham Families scattered to the extreme south Cush Mizraim Phut
Canaan The Ethiopians and their colonies The Egyptians and their
colonies The Libyans and Mauritanians The Canaanites, Phoenicians, and
their colonies

<span id="008">**Distaff**</span> (Heb. pelek , a "circle"), the
instrument used for twisting threads by a whirl ([Pro
31:19](../kjv/pro031.htm#019)).

<span id="009">**Divination**</span> Of false prophets ([Deu
18:10](../kjv/deu018.htm#010), [Deu 18:14](../kjv/deu018.htm#014); [Mic
3:6](../kjv/mic003.htm#006), [Mic 3:7](../kjv/mic003.htm#007), [Mic
3:11](../kjv/mic003.htm#011)), of necromancers ([Sa1
28:8](../kjv/sa1028.htm#008)), of the Philistine priests and diviners
([Sa1 6:2](../kjv/sa1006.htm#002)), of Balaam ([Jos
13:22](../kjv/jos013.htm#022)). Three kinds of divination are mentioned
in [Eze 21:21](../kjv/eze021.htm#021), by arrows, consulting with images
(the teraphim), and by examining the entrails of animals sacrificed. The
practice of this art seems to have been encouraged in ancient Egypt.
Diviners also abounded among the aborigines of Canaan and the
Philistines ([Isa 2:6](../kjv/isa002.htm#006); 1 Sam. 28). At a later
period multitudes of magicians poured from Chaldea and Arabia into the
land of Israel, and pursued their occupations ([Isa
8:19](../kjv/isa008.htm#019); [Kg2 21:6](../kjv/kg2021.htm#006); [Ch2
33:6](../kjv/ch2033.htm#006)). This superstition widely spread, and in
the time of the apostles there were "vagabond Jews, exorcists" ([Act
19:13](../kjv/act019.htm#013)), and men like Simon Magus ([Act
8:9](../kjv/act008.htm#009)), Bar-jesus ([Act
13:6](../kjv/act013.htm#006), [Act 13:8](../kjv/act013.htm#008)), and
other jugglers and impostors ([Act 19:19](../kjv/act019.htm#019); [Ti2
3:13](../kjv/ti2003.htm#013)). Every species and degree of this
superstition was strictly forbidden by the law of Moses ([Exo
22:18](../kjv/exo022.htm#018); [Lev 19:26](../kjv/lev019.htm#026), [Lev
19:31](../kjv/lev019.htm#031); [Lev 20:27](../kjv/lev020.htm#027); [Deu
18:10](../kjv/deu018.htm#010), [Deu 18:11](../kjv/deu018.htm#011)). But
beyond these various forms of superstition, there are instances of
divination on record in the Scriptures by which God was pleased to make
known his will. (1.) There was divination by lot, by which, when
resorted to in matters of moment, and with solemnity, God intimated his
will ([Jos 7:13](../kjv/jos007.htm#013)). The land of Canaan was divided
by lot ([Num 26:55](../kjv/num026.htm#055), [Num
26:56](../kjv/num026.htm#056)); Achan's guilt was detected ([Jos
7:16](../kjv/jos007.htm#016)), Saul was elected king ([Sa1
10:20](../kjv/sa1010.htm#020), [Sa1 10:21](../kjv/sa1010.htm#021)), and
Matthias chosen to the apostleship, by the solemn lot ([Act
1:26](../kjv/act001.htm#026)). It was thus also that the scape-goat was
determined ([Lev 16:8](../kjv/lev016.htm#008)). (2.) There was
divination by dreams ([Gen 20:6](../kjv/gen020.htm#006); [Deu
13:1](../kjv/deu013.htm#001), [Deu 13:3](../kjv/deu013.htm#003); [Jdg
7:13](../kjv/jdg007.htm#013), [Jdg 7:15](../kjv/jdg007.htm#015); [Mat
1:20](../kjv/mat001.htm#020); [Mat 2:12](../kjv/mat002.htm#012), [Mat
2:13](../kjv/mat002.htm#013), [Mat 2:19](../kjv/mat002.htm#019), [Mat
2:22](../kjv/mat002.htm#022)). This is illustrated in the history of
Joseph ([Gen 41:25](../kjv/gen041.htm#025)) and of Daniel ([Dan
2:27](../kjv/dan002.htm#027); [Dan 4:19](../kjv/dan004.htm#019)). (3.)
By divine appointment there was also divination by the Urim and Thummim
([Num 27:21](../kjv/num027.htm#021)), and by the ephod. (4.) God was
pleased sometimes to vouchsafe direct vocal communications to men ([Deu
34:10](../kjv/deu034.htm#010); [Exo 3:4](../kjv/exo003.htm#004); [Exo
4:3](../kjv/exo004.htm#003); [Deu 4:14](../kjv/deu004.htm#014), [Deu
4:15](../kjv/deu004.htm#015); [Kg1 19:12](../kjv/kg1019.htm#012)). He
also communed with men from above the mercy-seat ([Exo
25:22](../kjv/exo025.htm#022)), and at the door of the tabernacle ([Exo
29:42](../kjv/exo029.htm#042), [Exo 29:43](../kjv/exo029.htm#043)). (5.)
Through his prophets God revealed himself, and gave intimations of his
will ([Kg2 13:17](../kjv/kg2013.htm#017); [Jer
51:63](../kjv/jer051.htm#063), [Jer 51:64](../kjv/jer051.htm#064)).
