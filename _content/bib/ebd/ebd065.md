<span id="000">**Bricks**</span> The making of, formed the chief labour
of the Israelites in Egypt ([Exo 1:13](../kjv/exo001.htm#013), [Exo
1:14](../kjv/exo001.htm#014)). Those found among the ruins of Babylon
and Nineveh are about a foot square and four inches thick. They were
usually dried in the sun, though also sometimes in kilns ([Sa2
12:31](../kjv/sa2012.htm#031); [Jer 43:9](../kjv/jer043.htm#009); [Nah
3:14](../kjv/nah003.htm#014)). (See NEBUCHADNEZZAR.) The bricks used in
the tower of Babel were burnt bricks, cemented in the building by
bitumen ([Gen 11:3](../kjv/gen011.htm#003)).

<span id="001">**Bride**</span> Frequently used in the ordinary sense
([Isa 49:18](../kjv/isa049.htm#018); [Isa 61:10](../kjv/isa061.htm#010),
etc.). The relation between Christ and his church is set forth under the
figure of that between a bridegroom and bride ([Joh
3:29](../kjv/joh003.htm#029)). The church is called "the bride" ([Rev
21:9](../kjv/rev021.htm#009); [Rev 22:17](../kjv/rev022.htm#017)).
Compare parable of the Ten Virgins ([Mat 25:1](../kjv/mat025.htm#001)).

<span id="002">**Bridle**</span> Three Hebrew words are thus rendered in
the Authorized Version. (1.) Heb. mahsom signifies a muzzle or halter or
bridle, by which the rider governs his horse ([Psa
39:1](../kjv/psa039.htm#001)). (2.) Metheg, rendered also "bit" in [Psa
32:9](../kjv/psa032.htm#009), which is its proper meaning. Found in [Kg2
19:28](../kjv/kg2019.htm#028), where the restraints of God's providence
are metaphorically styled his "bridle" and "hook." God's placing a
"bridle in the jaws of the people" ([Isa 30:28](../kjv/isa030.htm#028);
[Isa 37:29](../kjv/isa037.htm#029)) signifies his preventing the
Assyrians from carrying out their purpose against Jerusalem. (3.)
Another word, resen, was employed to represent a halter or bridle-rein,
as used [Psa 32:9](../kjv/psa032.htm#009); [Isa
30:28](../kjv/isa030.htm#028). In [Job 30:11](../kjv/job030.htm#011) the
restraints of law and humanity are called a bridle.

<span id="003">**Brier**</span> This word occurs frequently, and is the
translation of several different terms. (1.) [Mic
7:4](../kjv/mic007.htm#004), it denotes a species of thorn shrub used
for hedges. In [Pro 15:19](../kjv/pro015.htm#019) the word is rendered
"thorn" (Heb. hedek , "stinging"), supposed by some to be what is called
the "apple of Sodom" (q.v.). (2.) [Eze 28:24](../kjv/eze028.htm#024),
sallon, properly a "prickle," such as is found on the shoots of the palm
tree. (3.) [Isa 55:13](../kjv/isa055.htm#013), probably simply a thorny
bush. Some, following the Vulgate Version, regard it as the "nettle."
(4.) [Isa 5:6](../kjv/isa005.htm#006); [Isa
7:23](../kjv/isa007.htm#023), etc., frequently used to denote thorny
shrubs in general. In [Isa 10:17](../kjv/isa010.htm#017); [Isa
27:4](../kjv/isa027.htm#004), it means troublesome men. (5.) In [Heb
6:8](../kjv/heb006.htm#008) the Greek word ( tribolos ) so rendered
means "three-pronged," and denotes the land caltrop, a low thorny shrub
resembling in its spikes the military "crow-foot." Compare [Mat
7:16](../kjv/mat007.htm#016), "thistle."

<span id="004">**Brigandine**</span> ([Jer 46:4](../kjv/jer046.htm#004);
[Jer 51:3](../kjv/jer051.htm#003)), an obsolete English word denoting a
scale coat of armour, or habergeon, worn by light armed "brigands." The
Revised Version has "coat of mail."

<span id="005">**Brimstone**</span> An inflammable mineral substance
found in quantities on the shores of the Dead Sea. The cities of the
plain were destroyed by a rain of fire and brimstone ([Gen
19:24](../kjv/gen019.htm#024), [Gen 19:25](../kjv/gen019.htm#025)). In
[Isa 34:9](../kjv/isa034.htm#009) allusion is made to the destruction of
these cities. This word figuratively denotes destruction or punishment
([Job 18:15](../kjv/job018.htm#015); [Isa 30:33](../kjv/isa030.htm#033);
[Isa 34:9](../kjv/isa034.htm#009); [Psa 11:6](../kjv/psa011.htm#006);
[Eze 38:22](../kjv/eze038.htm#022)). It is used to express the idea of
excruciating torment in [Rev 14:10](../kjv/rev014.htm#010); [Rev
19:20](../kjv/rev019.htm#020); [Rev 20:10](../kjv/rev020.htm#010).

<span id="006">**Brook**</span> A torrent. (1.) Applied to small
streams, as the Arnon, Jabbok, etc. Isaiah ([Isa
15:7](../kjv/isa015.htm#007)) speaks of the "book of the willows,"
probably the Wady-el-Asha. (2.) It is also applied to winter torrents
([Job 6:15](../kjv/job006.htm#015); [Num 34:5](../kjv/num034.htm#005);
[Jos 15:4](../kjv/jos015.htm#004), [Jos 15:47](../kjv/jos015.htm#047)),
and to the torrent-bed or wady as well as to the torrent itself ([Num
13:23](../kjv/num013.htm#023); [Kg1 17:3](../kjv/kg1017.htm#003)). (3.)
In [Isa 19:7](../kjv/isa019.htm#007) the river Nile is meant, as
rendered in the Revised Version.

<span id="007">**Brother**</span> (1.) In the natural and common sense
([Mat 1:2](../kjv/mat001.htm#002); [Luk 3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001),
[Luk 3:19](../kjv/luk003.htm#019)). (2.) A near relation, a cousin ([Gen
13:8](../kjv/gen013.htm#008); [Gen 14:16](../kjv/gen014.htm#016); [Mat
12:46](../kjv/mat012.htm#046); [Joh 7:3](../kjv/joh007.htm#003); [Act
1:14](../kjv/act001.htm#014); [Gal 1:19](../kjv/gal001.htm#019)). (3.)
Simply a fellow-countryman ([Mat 5:47](../kjv/mat005.htm#047); [Act
3:22](../kjv/act003.htm#022); [Heb 7:5](../kjv/heb007.htm#005)). (4.) A
disciple or follower ([Mat 25:40](../kjv/mat025.htm#040); [Heb
2:11](../kjv/heb002.htm#011), [Heb 2:12](../kjv/heb002.htm#012)). (5.)
One of the same faith ([Amo 1:9](../kjv/amo001.htm#009); [Act
9:30](../kjv/act009.htm#030); [Act 11:29](../kjv/act011.htm#029); [Co1
5:11](../kjv/co1005.htm#011)); whence the early disciples of our Lord
were known to each other as brethren. (6.) A colleague in office ([Ezr
3:2](../kjv/ezr003.htm#002); [Co1 1:1](../kjv/co1001.htm#001); [Co2
1:1](../kjv/co2001.htm#001)). (7.) A fellow-man ([Gen
9:5](../kjv/gen009.htm#005); [Gen 19:7](../kjv/gen019.htm#007); [Mat
5:22](../kjv/mat005.htm#022), [Mat 5:23](../kjv/mat005.htm#023), [Mat
5:24](../kjv/mat005.htm#024); [Mat 7:5](../kjv/mat007.htm#005); [Heb
2:17](../kjv/heb002.htm#017)). (8.) One beloved or closely united with
another in affection ([Sa2 1:26](../kjv/sa2001.htm#026); [Act
6:3](../kjv/act006.htm#003); [Th1 5:1](../kjv/th1005.htm#001)). Brethren
of Jesus ([Mat 1:25](../kjv/mat001.htm#025); [Mat
12:46](../kjv/mat012.htm#046), [Mat 12:50](../kjv/mat012.htm#050); [Mar
3:31](../kjv/mar003.htm#031), [Mar 3:32](../kjv/mar003.htm#032); [Gal
1:19](../kjv/gal001.htm#019); [Co1 9:5](../kjv/co1009.htm#005), etc.)
were probably the younger children of Joseph and Mary. Some have
supposed that they may have been the children of Joseph by a former
marriage, and others that they were the children of Mary, the Virgin's
sister, and wife of Cleophas. The first interpretation, however, is the
most natural.

<span id="008">**Bruit**</span> A rumour or report ([Jer
10:22](../kjv/jer010.htm#022), R.V. "rumour;" [Nah
3:19](../kjv/nah003.htm#019)).

<span id="009">**Bucket**</span> A vessel to draw water with ([Isa
40:15](../kjv/isa040.htm#015)); used figuratively, probably, of a
numerous issue ([Num 24:7](../kjv/num024.htm#007)).
