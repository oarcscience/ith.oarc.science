<span id="000">**Abdi**</span> My servant. (1.) [Ch1
6:44](../kjv/ch1006.htm#044). (2.) [Ch2 29:12](../kjv/ch2029.htm#012).
(3.) [Ezr 10:26](../kjv/ezr010.htm#026).

<span id="001">**Abdiel**</span> Servant of God, ([Ch1
5:15](../kjv/ch1005.htm#015)), a Gadite chief.

<span id="002">**Abdon**</span> Servile. (1.) The son of Hillel, a
Pirathonite, the tenth judge of Israel ([Jdg
12:13](../kjv/jdg012.htm#013)). He is probably the Bedan of [Sa1
12:11](../kjv/sa1012.htm#011). (2.) The first-born of Gibeon of the
tribe of Benjamin ([Ch1 8:30](../kjv/ch1008.htm#030); [Ch1
9:36](../kjv/ch1009.htm#036)). (3.) The son of Micah, one of those whom
Josiah sent to the prophetess Huldah to ascertain from her the meaning
of the recently discovered book of the law ([Ch2
34:20](../kjv/ch2034.htm#020)). He is called Achbor in [Kg2
22:12](../kjv/kg2022.htm#012). (4.) One of the "sons" of Shashak ([Ch1
8:23](../kjv/ch1008.htm#023)). This is the name also of a Levitical town
of the Gershonites, in the tribe of Asher ([Jos
21:30](../kjv/jos021.htm#030); [Ch1 6:74](../kjv/ch1006.htm#074)). The
ruins of Abdeh, some 8 miles north-east of Accho, probably mark its
site.

<span id="003">**Abednego**</span> Servant of Nego = Nebo, the Chaldee
name given to Azariah, one of Daniel's three companions ([Dan
2:49](../kjv/dan002.htm#049)). With Shadrach and Meshach, he was
delivered from the burning fiery furnace (Dan. 3:12-30).

<span id="004">**Abel**</span> (1.) (HEBREW HEBHEL) A breath, or vanity.
The second son of Adam and Eve. He was put to death by his brother Cain
(Gen. 4:1-16). Guided by the instruction of their father, the two
brothers were trained in the duty of worshipping God. "And in process of
time" (marg. "at the end of days", i.e., on the Sabbath) each of them
offered up to God of the firstfruits of his labours. Cain, as a
husbandman, offered the fruits of the field; Abel, as a shepherd, of the
firstlings of his flock. "The Lord had respect unto Abel and his
offering; but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect" ([Gen
4:3](../kjv/gen004.htm#003)). On this account Cain was angry with his
brother, and formed the design of putting him to death; a design which
he at length found an opportunity of carrying into effect ([Gen
4:8](../kjv/gen004.htm#008), [Gen 4:9](../kjv/gen004.htm#009). Compare
[Jo1 3:12](../kjv/jo1003.htm#012)). There are several references to Abel
in the New Testament. Our Saviour speaks of him as "righteous" ([Mat
23:35](../kjv/mat023.htm#035)). "The blood of sprinkling" is said to
speak "better things than that of Abel" ([Heb
12:24](../kjv/heb012.htm#024)); i.e., the blood of Jesus is the reality
of which the blood of the offering made by Abel was only the type. The
comparison here is between the sacrifice offered by Christ and that
offered by Abel, and not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy
and the blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as has
sometimes been supposed. It is also said ([Heb
11:4](../kjv/heb011.htm#004)) that "Abel offered unto God a more
excellent sacrifice than Cain." This sacrifice was made "by faith;" this
faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the God of providence,
but especially in God as the great Redeemer, whose sacrifice was
typified by the sacrifices which, no doubt by the divine institution,
were offered from the days of Adam downward. On account of that "faith"
which looked forward to the great atoning sacrifice, Abel's offering was
accepted of God. Cain's offering had no such reference, and therefore
was rejected. Abel was the first martyr, as he was the first of our race
to die. (2.) (Heb. 'abhel ), lamentation ([Sa1
6:18](../kjv/sa1006.htm#018)), the name given to the great stone in
Joshua's field whereon the ark was "set down." The Revised Version,
however, following the Targum and the LXX., reads in the Hebrew text
'ebhen (= a stone), and accordingly translates "unto the great stone,
whereon they set down the ark." This reading is to be preferred. (3.)
(Hebrew 'abhel ) A grassy place, a meadow. This word enters into the
composition of the following words: (a.) Abel-beth-maachah - Meadow of
the house of Maachah, a city in the north of Palestine, in the
neighbourhood of Dan and Ijon, in the tribe of Naphtali. It was a place
of considerable strength and importance. It is called a "mother in
Israel", i.e., a metropolis ([Sa2 20:19](../kjv/sa2020.htm#019)). It was
besieged by Joab ([Sa2 20:14](../kjv/sa2020.htm#014)), by Benhadad ([Kg1
15:20](../kjv/kg1015.htm#020)), and by Tiglath-pileser ([Kg2
15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029)) about 734 B.C.. (b.) It is elsewhere
called Abel-maim meadow of the waters, ([Ch2
16:4](../kjv/ch2016.htm#004)). Its site is occupied by the modern Abil
or Abil-el-kamh, on a rising ground to the east of the brook Derdarah,
which flows through the plain of Huleh into the Jordan, about 6 miles to
the west-north-west of Dan.

<span id="007">**Abel-cheramim**</span> ([Jdg
11:33](../kjv/jdg011.htm#033), R.V.; A. V., "plain of the vineyards"), a
village of the Ammonites, whither Jephthah pursued their forces.

<span id="008">**Abel-meholah**</span> Meadow of dancing, or the
dancing-meadow, the birth-place and residence of the prophet Elisha, not
far from Beth-shean ([Kg1 4:12](../kjv/kg1004.htm#012)), in the tribe of
Issachar, near where the Wady el-Maleh emerges into the valley of the
Jordan, "the rich meadow-land which extends about 4 miles south of
Beth-shean; moist and luxuriant." Here Elisha was found at his plough by
Elijah on his return up the Jordan valley from Horeb ([Kg1
19:16](../kjv/kg1019.htm#016)). It is now called 'Ain Helweh .

<span id="009">**Abel-mizraim**</span> Meadow of Egypt, or mourning of
Egypt, a place "beyond," i.e., on the west of Jordan, at the
"threshing-floor of Atad." Here the Egyptians mourned seventy days for
Jacob ([Gen 50:4](../kjv/gen050.htm#004)). Its site is unknown.
