<span id="000">**Furnace**</span> (1.) Chald. attun, a large furnace
with a wide open mouth, at the top of which materials were cast in ([Dan
3:22](../kjv/dan003.htm#022), [Dan 3:23](../kjv/dan003.htm#023); compare
[Jer 29:22](../kjv/jer029.htm#022)). This furnace would be in constant
requisition, for the Babylonians disposed of their dead by cremation, as
did also the Accadians who invaded Mesopotamia. (2.) Heb. kibshan , a
smelting furnace ([Gen 19:28](../kjv/gen019.htm#028)), also a lime-kiln
([Isa 33:12](../kjv/isa033.htm#012); [Amo 2:1](../kjv/amo002.htm#001)).
(3.) Heb. kur , a refining furnace ([Pro 17:3](../kjv/pro017.htm#003);
[Pro 27:21](../kjv/pro027.htm#021); [Eze 22:18](../kjv/eze022.htm#018)).
(4.) Heb. alil , a crucible; only used in [Psa
12:6](../kjv/psa012.htm#006). (5.) Heb. tannur , oven for baking bread
([Gen 15:17](../kjv/gen015.htm#017); [Isa 31:9](../kjv/isa031.htm#009);
[Neh 3:11](../kjv/neh003.htm#011)). It was a large pot, narrowing
towards the top. When it was heated by a fire made within, the dough was
spread over the heated surface, and thus was baked. "A smoking furnace
and a burning lamp" ([Gen 15:17](../kjv/gen015.htm#017)), the symbol of
the presence of the Almighty, passed between the divided pieces of
Abraham's sacrifice in ratification of the covenant God made with him.
(See Oven.) (6.) Gr. kamnos , a furnace, kiln, or oven ([Mat
13:42](../kjv/mat013.htm#042), [Mat 13:50](../kjv/mat013.htm#050); [Rev
1:15](../kjv/rev001.htm#015); [Rev 9:2](../kjv/rev009.htm#002)).

<span id="001">**Furrow**</span> An opening in the ground made by the
plough ([Psa 65:10](../kjv/psa065.htm#010); [Hos
10:4](../kjv/hos010.htm#004), [Hos 10:10](../kjv/hos010.htm#010)).

<span id="002">**Fury**</span> As attributed to God, is a figurative
expression for dispensing afflictive judgments ([Lev
26:28](../kjv/lev026.htm#028); [Job 20:23](../kjv/job020.htm#023); [Isa
63:3](../kjv/isa063.htm#003); [Jer 4:4](../kjv/jer004.htm#004); [Eze
5:13](../kjv/eze005.htm#013); [Dan 9:16](../kjv/dan009.htm#016); [Zac
8:2](../kjv/zac008.htm#002)).

<span id="003">**Gaal**</span> Loathing, the son of Ebed, in whom the
Shechemites "placed their confidence" when they became discontented with
Abimelech. He headed the revolution, and led out the men of Shechem
against Abimelech; but was defeated, and fled to his own home (Judg.
9:26-46). We hear no more of him after this battle.

<span id="004">**Gaash**</span> A shaking, a hill, on the north side of
which Joshua was buried ([Jos 24:30](../kjv/jos024.htm#030); [Jdg
2:9](../kjv/jdg002.htm#009)), in the territory of Ephraim. (See
TIMNATH-SERAH.)

<span id="005">**Gabbatha**</span> Gab Baitha, i.e., "the ridge of the
house" = "the temple-mound," on a part of which the fortress of Antonia
was built. This "temple-mound" was covered with a tessellated "pavement"
(Gr. lithostroton , i.e., "stone-paved"). A judgment-seat (bema) was
placed on this "pavement" outside the hall of the "praetorium" (q.v.),
the judgment-hall ([Joh 18:28](../kjv/joh018.htm#028); [Joh
19:13](../kjv/joh019.htm#013)).

<span id="006">**Gabriel**</span> Champion of God, used as a proper name
to designate the angel who was sent to Daniel ([Dan
8:16](../kjv/dan008.htm#016)) to explain the vision of the ram and the
he-goat, and to communicate the prediction of the seventy weeks ([Dan
9:21](../kjv/dan009.htm#021)). He announced also the birth of John the
Baptist ([Luk 1:11](../kjv/luk001.htm#011)), and of the Messiah ([Luk
1:26](../kjv/luk001.htm#026)). He describes himself in the words, "I am
Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God" ([Luk
1:19](../kjv/luk001.htm#019)).

<span id="007">**Gad**</span> Fortune; luck. (1.) Jacob's seventh son,
by Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, and the brother of Asher ([Gen
30:11](../kjv/gen030.htm#011); [Gen 46:16](../kjv/gen046.htm#016), [Gen
46:18](../kjv/gen046.htm#018)). In the Authorized Version of [Gen
30:11](../kjv/gen030.htm#011) the words, "A troop cometh: and she
called," etc., should rather be rendered, "In fortune \[R.V.,
'Fortunate'\]: and she called," etc., or "Fortune cometh," etc. The
tribe of Gad during the march through the wilderness had their place
with Simeon and Reuben on the south side of the tabernacle ([Num
2:14](../kjv/num002.htm#014)). The tribes of Reuben and Gad continued
all through their history to follow the pastoral pursuits of the
patriarchs ([Num 32:1](../kjv/num032.htm#001)). The portion allotted to
the tribe of Gad was on the east of Jordan, and comprehended the half of
Gilead, a region of great beauty and fertility ([Deu
3:12](../kjv/deu003.htm#012)), bounded on the east by the Arabian
desert, on the west by the Jordan ([Jos 13:27](../kjv/jos013.htm#027)),
and on the north by the river Jabbok. It thus included the whole of the
Jordan valley as far north as to the Sea of Galilee, where it narrowed
almost to a point. This tribe was fierce and warlike; they were "strong
men of might, men of war for the battle, that could handle shield and
buckler, their faces the faces of lions, and like roes upon the
mountains for swiftness" ([Ch1 12:8](../kjv/ch1012.htm#008); [Ch1
5:19](../kjv/ch1005.htm#019)). Barzillai ([Sa2
17:27](../kjv/sa2017.htm#027)) and Elijah ([Kg1
17:1](../kjv/kg1017.htm#001)) were of this tribe. It was carried into
captivity at the same time as the other tribes of the northern kingdom
by Tiglath-pileser ([Ch1 5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026)), and in the time
of Jeremiah ([Jer 49:1](../kjv/jer049.htm#001)) their cities were
inhabited by the Ammonites. (2.) A prophet who joined David in the
"hold," and at whose advice he quitted it for the forest of Hareth ([Ch1
29:29](../kjv/ch1029.htm#029); [Ch2 29:25](../kjv/ch2029.htm#025); [Sa1
22:5](../kjv/sa1022.htm#005)). Many years after we find mention made of
him in connection with the punishment inflicted for numbering the people
([Sa2 24:11](../kjv/sa2024.htm#011); [Ch1 21:9](../kjv/ch1021.htm#009)).
He wrote a book called the "Acts of David" ([Ch1
29:29](../kjv/ch1029.htm#029)), and assisted in the arrangements for the
musical services of the "house of God" ([Ch2
29:25](../kjv/ch2029.htm#025)). He bore the title of "the king's seer"
([Sa2 24:11](../kjv/sa2024.htm#011), [Sa2 24:13](../kjv/sa2024.htm#013);
[Ch1 21:9](../kjv/ch1021.htm#009)).

<span id="008">**Gadara**</span> The capital of the Roman province of a
Peraea. It stood on the summit of a mountain about 6 miles south-east of
the Sea of Galilee. Mark ([Mar 5:1](../kjv/mar005.htm#001)) and Luke
([Luk 8:26](../kjv/luk008.htm#026)) describe the miracle of the healing
of the demoniac ([Mat 8:28](../kjv/mat008.htm#028) says two demoniacs)
as having been wrought "in the country of the Gadarenes," thus
describing the scene generally. The miracle could not have been wrought
at Gadara itself, for between the lake and this town there is the deep,
almost impassable ravine of the Hieromax (Jarmuk). It is identified with
the modern village of Um-Keis, which is surrounded by very extensive
ruins, all bearing testimony to the splendour of ancient Gadara. "The
most interesting remains of Gadara are its tombs, which dot the cliffs
for a considerable distance round the city, chiefly on the north-east
declivity; but many beautifully sculptured sarcophagi are scattered over
the surrounding heights. They are excavated in the limestone rock, and
consist of chambers of various dimensions, some more than 20 feet
square, with recesses in the sides for bodies... The present inhabitants
of Um-Keis are all troglodytes, 'dwelling in tombs,' like the poor
maniacs of old, and occasionally they are almost as dangerous to
unprotected travelers."

<span id="009">**Gadarenes**</span> The inhabitants of Gadara, in
Revised Version "Gerasenes" ([Mar 5:1](../kjv/mar005.htm#001); [Luk
8:26](../kjv/luk008.htm#026), [Luk 8:37](../kjv/luk008.htm#037)). In
[Mat 8:28](../kjv/mat008.htm#028) they are called Gergesenes, Revised
Version "Gadarenes."
