<span id="000">**Hazar-susah**</span> Village of the horse, the same as
Sansannah, one of Solomon's "chariot cities" ([Jos
15:31](../kjv/jos015.htm#031); [Ch2 1:14](../kjv/ch2001.htm#014)), a
depot in the south border of Judah.

<span id="001">**Hazel**</span> Heb. luz , ([Gen
30:37](../kjv/gen030.htm#037)), a nut-bearing tree. The Hebrew word is
rendered in the Vulgate by amygdalinus, "the almond-tree," which is
probably correct. That tree flourishes in Syria.

<span id="002">**Hazerim**</span> Villages, probably the name of the
temporary villages in which the nomad Avites resided ([Deu
2:23](../kjv/deu002.htm#023)).

<span id="003">**Hazeroth**</span> Fenced enclosures consisting of "a
low wall of stones in which thick bundles of thorny acacia are inserted,
the tangled branches and long needle-like spikes forming a perfectly
impenetrable hedge around the encampment" of tents and cattle which they
sheltered. Such like enclosures abound in the wilderness of Paran, which
the Israelites entered after leaving Sinai ([Num
11:35](../kjv/num011.htm#035); [Num 12:16](../kjv/num012.htm#016); [Num
33:17](../kjv/num033.htm#017), [Num 33:18](../kjv/num033.htm#018)). This
third encampment of the Israelites has been identified with the modern
'Ain el-Hudhera , some 40 miles north-east of Sinai. Here Miriam (q.v.),
being displeased that Moses had married a Cushite wife ([Num
12:1](../kjv/num012.htm#001)), induced Aaron to join with her in
rebelling against Moses. God vindicated the authority of his "servant
Moses," and Miriam was smitten with leprosy. Moses interceded for her,
and she was healed ([Num 12:4](../kjv/num012.htm#004)). From this
encampment the Israelites marched northward across the plateau of
et-Tih, and at length reached KADESH.

<span id="004">**Hazezon-tamar**</span> Pruning of the palm, the
original name of the place afterwards called ENGEDI (q.v.), [Gen
14:7](../kjv/gen014.htm#007); called also HAZAZON-TAMAR ([Ch2
20:2](../kjv/ch2020.htm#002)).

<span id="005">**Hazo**</span> Vision, one of the sons of Nahor ([Gen
22:22](../kjv/gen022.htm#022)).

<span id="006">**Hazor**</span> Enclosed; fortified. (1.) A stronghold
of the Canaanites in the mountains north of Lake Merom ([Jos
11:1](../kjv/jos011.htm#001)). Jabin the king with his allied tribes
here encountered Joshua in a great battle. Joshua gained a signal
victory, which virtually completed his conquest of Canaan ([Jos
11:10](../kjv/jos011.htm#010)). This city was, however, afterwards
rebuilt by the Canaanites, and was ruled by a king with the same
hereditary name of Jabin. His army, under a noted leader of the name of
Sisera, swept down upon the south, aiming at the complete subjugation of
the country. This powerful army was met by the Israelites under Barak,
who went forth by the advice of the prophetess Deborah. The result was
one of the most remarkable victories for Israel recorded in the Old
Testament ([Jos 19:36](../kjv/jos019.htm#036); [Jdg
4:2](../kjv/jdg004.htm#002); [Sa1 12:9](../kjv/sa1012.htm#009)). The
city of Hazor was taken and occupied by the Israelites. It was fortified
by Solomon to defend the entrance into the kingdom from Syria and
Assyria. When Tiglath-pileser, the Assyrian king, invaded the land, this
was one of the first cities he captured, carrying its inhabitants
captive into Assyria ([Kg2 15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029)). It has been
identified with Khurbet Harrah, 2 1/2 miles south-east of Kedesh. (2.) A
city in the south of Judah ([Jos 15:23](../kjv/jos015.htm#023)). The
name here should probably be connected with the word following, Ithnan,
HAZOR-ITHNAN instead of "Hazor and Ithnan." (3.) A district in Arabia
([Jer 49:28](../kjv/jer049.htm#028)), supposed by some to be Jetor,
i.e., Ituraea. (4.) "Kerioth and Hezron" ([Jos
15:25](../kjv/jos015.htm#025)) should be "Kerioth-hezron" (as in the
R.V.), the two names being joined together as the name of one place
(e.g., like Kirjath-jearim), "the same is Hazor" (R.V.). This place has
been identified with el-Kuryetein, and has been supposed to be the home
of Judas Iscariot. (See KERIOTH.)

<span id="007">**Hazor-hadattah**</span> New Hazor, a city in the south
of Judah ([Jos 15:25](../kjv/jos015.htm#025)). It is probably identified
with the ruins of el-Hazzarah, near Beit Jebrin.

<span id="008">**Head-bands**</span> (Heb. kishshurim ), properly
girdles or belts for the waist ([Isa 3:20](../kjv/isa003.htm#020), R.V.,
"sashes;" [Jer 2:32](../kjv/jer002.htm#032), rendered "attire", i.e., a
girdle round the waist).

<span id="009">**Head-dress**</span> Not in common use among the
Hebrews. It is first mentioned in [Exo 28:40](../kjv/exo028.htm#040)
(A.V., "bonnets;" R.V., "head-tires"). It was used especially for
purposes of ornament ([Job 29:14](../kjv/job029.htm#014); [Isa
3:23](../kjv/isa003.htm#023); [Isa 62:3](../kjv/isa062.htm#003)). The
Hebrew word here used, tsaniph, properly means a turban, folds of linen
wound round the head. The Hebrew word peer, used in [Isa
61:3](../kjv/isa061.htm#003), there rendered "beauty" (A.V.) and
"garland" (R.V.), is a head-dress or turban worn by females ([Isa
3:20](../kjv/isa003.htm#020), "bonnets"), priests ([Exo
39:28](../kjv/exo039.htm#028)), a bridegroom ([Isa
61:10](../kjv/isa061.htm#010), "ornament;" R.V., "garland"). [Eze
16:10](../kjv/eze016.htm#010) and [Jon 2:5](../kjv/jon002.htm#005) are
to be understood of the turban wrapped round the head. The Hebrew
shebisim ([Isa 3:18](../kjv/isa003.htm#018)), in the Authorized Version
rendered "cauls," and marg. "networks," denotes probably a kind of
netted head-dress. The "horn" (Heb. keren ) mentioned in [Sa1
2:1](../kjv/sa1002.htm#001) is the head-dress called by the Druses of
Mount Lebanon the tantura.
