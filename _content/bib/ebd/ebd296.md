<span id="000">**Pipe**</span> ([Sa1 10:5](../kjv/sa1010.htm#005); [Kg1
1:40](../kjv/kg1001.htm#040); [Isa 5:12](../kjv/isa005.htm#012); [Isa
30:29](../kjv/isa030.htm#029)). The Hebrew word halil, so rendered,
means "bored through," and is the name given to various kinds of wind
instruments, as the fife, flute, Pan-pipes, etc. In [Amo
6:5](../kjv/amo006.htm#005) this word is rendered "instrument of music."
This instrument is mentioned also in the New Testament ([Mat
11:17](../kjv/mat011.htm#017); [Co1 14:7](../kjv/co1014.htm#007)). It is
still used in Palestine, and is, as in ancient times, made of different
materials, as reed, copper, bronze, etc.

<span id="001">**Piram**</span> Like a wild ass, a king of Jarmuth, a
royal city of the Canaanites, who was conquered and put to death by
Joshua ([Jos 10:3](../kjv/jos010.htm#003), [Jos
10:23](../kjv/jos010.htm#023), [Jos 10:26](../kjv/jos010.htm#026)).

<span id="002">**Pirathon**</span> Prince, or summit, a place "in the
land of Ephraim" ([Jdg 12:15](../kjv/jdg012.htm#015)), now Feron, some
10 miles south-west of Shechem. This was the home of Abdon the judge.

<span id="003">**Pirathonite**</span> (1.) Abdon, the son of Hillel, so
called, [Jdg 12:13](../kjv/jdg012.htm#013), [Jdg
12:15](../kjv/jdg012.htm#015). (2.) Benaiah the Ephraimite ([Sa2
23:30](../kjv/sa2023.htm#030)), one of David's thirty heroes.

<span id="004">**Pisgah**</span> A part, a mountain summit in the land
of Moab, in the territory of Reuben, where Balak offered up sacrifices
([Num 21:20](../kjv/num021.htm#020); [Num
23:14](../kjv/num023.htm#014)), and from which Moses viewed the promised
land ([Deu 3:27](../kjv/deu003.htm#027)). It is probably the modern
Jebel Siaghah. (See NEBO.)

<span id="005">**Pisidia**</span> A district in Asia Minor, to the north
of Pamphylia. The Taurus range of mountains extends through it. Antioch,
one of its chief cities, was twice visited by Paul ([Act
13:14](../kjv/act013.htm#014); [Act 14:21](../kjv/act014.htm#021)).

<span id="006">**Pison**</span> Babylonian, the current, broadflowing,
one of the "four heads" into which the river which watered the garden of
Eden was divided ([Gen 2:11](../kjv/gen002.htm#011)). Some identify it
with the modern Phasis, others with the Halys, others the Jorak or
Acampis, others the Jaab, the Indus, the Ganges, etc.

<span id="007">**Pit**</span> A hole in the ground ([Exo
21:33](../kjv/exo021.htm#033), [Exo 21:34](../kjv/exo021.htm#034)), a
cistern for water ([Gen 37:24](../kjv/gen037.htm#024); [Jer
14:3](../kjv/jer014.htm#003)), a vault ([Jer
41:9](../kjv/jer041.htm#009)), a grave ([Psa
30:3](../kjv/psa030.htm#003)). It is used as a figure for mischief ([Psa
9:15](../kjv/psa009.htm#015)), and is the name given to the unseen place
of woe ([Rev 20:1](../kjv/rev020.htm#001), [Rev
20:3](../kjv/rev020.htm#003)). The slime-pits in the vale of Siddim were
wells which yielded asphalt ([Gen 14:10](../kjv/gen014.htm#010)).

<span id="008">**Pitch**</span> ([Gen 6:14](../kjv/gen006.htm#014)),
asphalt or bitumen in its soft state, called "slime" ([Gen
11:3](../kjv/gen011.htm#003); [Gen 14:10](../kjv/gen014.htm#010); [Exo
2:3](../kjv/exo002.htm#003)), found in pits near the Dead Sea (q.v.). It
was used for various purposes, as the coating of the outside of vessels
and in building. Allusion is made in [Isa 34:9](../kjv/isa034.htm#009)
to its inflammable character. (See SLIME.)

<span id="009">**Pitcher**</span> A vessel for containing liquids. In
the East pitchers were usually carried on the head or shoulders ([Gen
24:15](../kjv/gen024.htm#015); [Jdg 7:16](../kjv/jdg007.htm#016), [Jdg
7:19](../kjv/jdg007.htm#019); [Mar 14:13](../kjv/mar014.htm#013)).
