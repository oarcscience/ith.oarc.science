<span id="000">**Hough**</span> To hamstring, i.e., sever the "tendon of
Achilles" of the hinder legs of captured horses ([Jos
11:6](../kjv/jos011.htm#006); [Sa2 8:4](../kjv/sa2008.htm#004); [Ch1
18:4](../kjv/ch1018.htm#004)), so as to render them useless.

<span id="001">**Hour**</span> First found in [Dan
3:6](../kjv/dan003.htm#006); [Dan 4:19](../kjv/dan004.htm#019), [Dan
4:33](../kjv/dan004.htm#033); [Dan 5:5](../kjv/dan005.htm#005). It is
the rendering of the Chaldee shaah, meaning a "moment," a "look." It is
used in the New Testament frequently to denote some determinate season
([Mat 8:13](../kjv/mat008.htm#013); [Luk 12:39](../kjv/luk012.htm#039)).
With the ancient Hebrews the divisions of the day were "morning,
evening, and noon-day" ([Psa 55:17](../kjv/psa055.htm#017), etc.). The
Greeks, following the Babylonians, divided the day into twelve hours.
The Jews, during the Captivity, learned also from the Babylonians this
method of dividing time. When Judea became subject to the Romans, the
Jews adopted the Roman mode of reckoning time. The night was divided
into four watches ([Luk 12:38](../kjv/luk012.htm#038); [Mat
14:25](../kjv/mat014.htm#025); [Mat 13:25](../kjv/mat013.htm#025)).
Frequent allusion is also made to hours ([Mat
25:13](../kjv/mat025.htm#013); [Mat 26:40](../kjv/mat026.htm#040),
etc.). (See DAY.) An hour was the twelfth part of the day, reckoning
from sunrise to sunset, and consequently it perpetually varied in
length.

<span id="002">**House**</span> Till their sojourn in Egypt the Hebrews
dwelt in tents. They then for the first time inhabited cities ([Gen
47:3](../kjv/gen047.htm#003); [Exo 12:7](../kjv/exo012.htm#007); [Heb
11:9](../kjv/heb011.htm#009)). From the earliest times the Assyrians and
the Canaanites were builders of cities. The Hebrews after the Conquest
took possession of the captured cities, and seem to have followed the
methods of building that had been pursued by the Canaanites. Reference
is made to the stone ([Kg1 7:9](../kjv/kg1007.htm#009); [Isa
9:10](../kjv/isa009.htm#010)) and marble ([Ch1
29:2](../kjv/ch1029.htm#002)) used in building, and to the internal
wood-work of the houses ([Kg1 6:15](../kjv/kg1006.htm#015); [Kg1
7:2](../kjv/kg1007.htm#002); [Kg1 10:11](../kjv/kg1010.htm#011), [Kg1
10:12](../kjv/kg1010.htm#012); [Ch2 3:5](../kjv/ch2003.htm#005); [Jer
22:14](../kjv/jer022.htm#014)). "Ceiled houses" were such as had beams
inlaid in the walls to which wainscoting was fastened ([Ezr
6:4](../kjv/ezr006.htm#004); [Jer 22:14](../kjv/jer022.htm#014); [Hag
1:4](../kjv/hag001.htm#004)). "Ivory houses" had the upper parts of the
walls adorned with figures in stucco with gold and ivory ([Kg1
22:39](../kjv/kg1022.htm#039); [Ch2 3:6](../kjv/ch2003.htm#006); [Psa
45:8](../kjv/psa045.htm#008)). The roofs of the dwelling-houses were
flat, and are often alluded to in Scripture ([Sa2
11:2](../kjv/sa2011.htm#002); [Isa 22:1](../kjv/isa022.htm#001); [Mat
24:17](../kjv/mat024.htm#017)). Sometimes tents or booths were erected
on them ([Sa2 16:22](../kjv/sa2016.htm#022)). They were protected by
parapets or low walls ([Deu 22:8](../kjv/deu022.htm#008)). On the
house-tops grass sometimes grew ([Pro 19:13](../kjv/pro019.htm#013);
[Pro 27:15](../kjv/pro027.htm#015); [Psa 129:6](../kjv/psa129.htm#006),
[Psa 129:7](../kjv/psa129.htm#007)). They were used, not only as places
of recreation in the evening, but also sometimes as sleeping-places at
night ([Sa1 9:25](../kjv/sa1009.htm#025), [Sa1
9:26](../kjv/sa1009.htm#026); [Sa2 11:2](../kjv/sa2011.htm#002); [Sa2
16:22](../kjv/sa2016.htm#022); [Dan 4:29](../kjv/dan004.htm#029); [Job
27:18](../kjv/job027.htm#018); [Pro 21:9](../kjv/pro021.htm#009)), and
as places of devotion ([Jer 32:29](../kjv/jer032.htm#029); [Jer
19:13](../kjv/jer019.htm#013)).

<span id="003">**Hukkok**</span> Decreed, a town near Zebulun, not far
from Jordan, on the border of Naphtali ([Jos
19:34](../kjv/jos019.htm#034)). (See HELKATH.)

<span id="004">**Hul**</span> Circle, the second son of Aram ([Gen
10:23](../kjv/gen010.htm#023)), and grandson of Shem.

<span id="005">**Huldah**</span> Weasel, a prophetess; the wife of
Shallum. She was consulted regarding the "book of the law" discovered by
the high priest Hilkiah ([Kg2 22:14](../kjv/kg2022.htm#014); [Ch2
34:22](../kjv/ch2034.htm#022)). She resided in that part of Jerusalem
called the Mishneh (A.V., "the college;" R.V., "the second quarter"),
supposed by some to be the suburb between the inner and the outer wall,
the second or lower city, Akra. Miriam ([Exo
15:20](../kjv/exo015.htm#020)) and Deborah ([Jdg
4:4](../kjv/jdg004.htm#004)) are the only others who bear the title of
"prophetess," for the word in [Isa 8:3](../kjv/isa008.htm#003) means
only the prophet's wife.

<span id="006">**Humiliation of Christ**</span> ([Phi
2:8](../kjv/phi002.htm#008)), seen in (1.) his birth ([Gal
4:4](../kjv/gal004.htm#004); [Luk 2:7](../kjv/luk002.htm#007); [Joh
1:46](../kjv/joh001.htm#046); [Heb 2:9](../kjv/heb002.htm#009)), (2.)
his circumstances, (3.) his reputation ([Isa
53:1](../kjv/isa053.htm#001); [Mat 26:59](../kjv/mat026.htm#059), [Mat
26:67](../kjv/mat026.htm#067); [Psa 22:6](../kjv/psa022.htm#006); [Mat
26:68](../kjv/mat026.htm#068)), (4.) his soul ([Psa
22:1](../kjv/psa022.htm#001); [Mat 4:1](../kjv/mat004.htm#001); [Luk
22:44](../kjv/luk022.htm#044); [Heb 2:17](../kjv/heb002.htm#017), [Heb
2:18](../kjv/heb002.htm#018); [Heb 4:15](../kjv/heb004.htm#015)), (5.)
his death (Luke 23; John 19; [Mar 15:24](../kjv/mar015.htm#024), [Mar
15:25](../kjv/mar015.htm#025)), (6.) and his burial ([Isa
53:9](../kjv/isa053.htm#009); [Mat 27:57](../kjv/mat027.htm#057), [Mat
27:58](../kjv/mat027.htm#058), [Mat 27:60](../kjv/mat027.htm#060)). His
humiliation was necessary (1.) to execute the purpose of God ([Act
2:23](../kjv/act002.htm#023), [Act 2:24](../kjv/act002.htm#024); [Psa
40:6](../kjv/psa040.htm#006)), (2.) fulfill the Old Testament types and
prophecies, (3.) satisfy the law in the room of the guilty ([Isa
53:1](../kjv/isa053.htm#001); [Heb 9:12](../kjv/heb009.htm#012), [Heb
9:15](../kjv/heb009.htm#015)), procure for them eternal redemption, (4.)
and to show us an example.

<span id="007">**Humility**</span> A prominent Christian grace ([Rom
12:3](../kjv/rom012.htm#003); [Rom 15:17](../kjv/rom015.htm#017), [Rom
15:18](../kjv/rom015.htm#018); [Co1 3:5](../kjv/co1003.htm#005); [Co2
3:5](../kjv/co2003.htm#005); [Phi 4:11](../kjv/phi004.htm#011)). It is a
state of mind well pleasing to God ([Pe1 3:4](../kjv/pe1003.htm#004));
it preserves the soul in tranquillity ([Psa
69:32](../kjv/psa069.htm#032), [Psa 69:33](../kjv/psa069.htm#033)), and
makes us patient under trials ([Job 1:22](../kjv/job001.htm#022)).
Christ has set us an example of humility ([Phi
2:6](../kjv/phi002.htm#006)). We should be led thereto by a remembrance
of our sins ([Lam 3:39](../kjv/lam003.htm#039)), and by the thought that
it is the way to honour ([Pro 16:18](../kjv/pro016.htm#018)), and that
the greatest promises are made to the humble ([Psa
147:6](../kjv/psa147.htm#006); [Isa 57:15](../kjv/isa057.htm#015); [Isa
66:2](../kjv/isa066.htm#002); [Pe1 5:5](../kjv/pe1005.htm#005)). It is a
"great paradox in Christianity that it makes humility the avenue to
glory."

<span id="008">**Hunting**</span> Mentioned first in [Gen
10:9](../kjv/gen010.htm#009) in connection with Nimrod. Esau was "a
cunning hunter" ([Gen 25:27](../kjv/gen025.htm#027)). Hunting was
practiced by the Hebrews after their settlement in the "Land of Promise"
([Lev 17:15](../kjv/lev017.htm#015); [Pro
12:27](../kjv/pro012.htm#027)). The lion and other ravenous beasts were
found in Palestine ([Sa1 17:34](../kjv/sa1017.htm#034); [Sa2
23:20](../kjv/sa2023.htm#020); [Kg1 13:24](../kjv/kg1013.htm#024); [Eze
19:3](../kjv/eze019.htm#003)), and it must have been necessary to hunt
and destroy them. Various snares and gins were used in hunting ([Psa
91:3](../kjv/psa091.htm#003); [Amo 3:5](../kjv/amo003.htm#005); [Sa2
23:20](../kjv/sa2023.htm#020)). War is referred to under the idea of
hunting ([Jer 16:16](../kjv/jer016.htm#016); [Eze
32:30](../kjv/eze032.htm#030)).

<span id="009">**Hur**</span> A hole, as of a viper, etc. (1.) A son of
Caleb ([Ch1 2:19](../kjv/ch1002.htm#019), [Ch1
2:50](../kjv/ch1002.htm#050); [Ch1 4:1](../kjv/ch1004.htm#001), [Ch1
4:4](../kjv/ch1004.htm#004); compare [Ch2 1:5](../kjv/ch2001.htm#005)).
(2.) The husband of Miriam, Moses' sister ([Exo
17:10](../kjv/exo017.htm#010)). He was associated with Aaron in charge
of the people when Moses was absent on Sinai ([Exo
24:14](../kjv/exo024.htm#014)). He was probably of the tribe of Judah,
and grandfather of Bezaleel ([Exo 31:2](../kjv/exo031.htm#002); [Exo
35:30](../kjv/exo035.htm#030); [Ch1 2:19](../kjv/ch1002.htm#019)). (3.)
One of the five princes of Midian who were defeated and slain by the
Israelites under the command of Phinehas ([Num
31:8](../kjv/num031.htm#008)).
