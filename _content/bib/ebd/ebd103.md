<span id="000">**Dial**</span> For the measurement of time, only once
mentioned in the Bible, erected by Ahaz ([Kg2
20:11](../kjv/kg2020.htm#011); [Isa 38:8](../kjv/isa038.htm#008)). The
Hebrew word ( ma'aloth ) is rendered "steps" in [Exo
20:26](../kjv/exo020.htm#026), [Kg1 10:19](../kjv/kg1010.htm#019), and
"degrees" in [Kg2 20:9](../kjv/kg2020.htm#009), [Kg2
20:10](../kjv/kg2020.htm#010), [Kg2 20:11](../kjv/kg2020.htm#011). The
ma'aloth was probably stairs on which the shadow of a column or obelisk
placed on the top fell. The shadow would cover a greater or smaller
number of steps, according as the sun was low or high. Probably the
sun-dial was a Babylonian invention. Daniel at Babylon ([Dan
3:6](../kjv/dan003.htm#006)) is the first to make mention of the "hour."

<span id="001">**Diamond**</span> (1.) A precious gem (Heb. yahalom' ,
in allusion to its hardness), otherwise unknown, the sixth, i.e., the
third in the second row, in the breastplate of the high priest, with the
name of Naphtali engraven on it ([Exo 28:18](../kjv/exo028.htm#018);
[Exo 39:11](../kjv/exo039.htm#011); R.V. marg., "sardonyx.") (2.) A
precious stone (Heb. shamir' , a sharp point) mentioned in [Jer
17:1](../kjv/jer017.htm#001). From its hardness it was used for cutting
and perforating other minerals. It is rendered "adamant" (q.v.) in [Eze
3:9](../kjv/eze003.htm#009), [Zac 7:12](../kjv/zac007.htm#012). It is
the hardest and most valuable of precious stones.

<span id="002">**Diana**</span> So called by the Romans; called Artemis
by the Greeks, the "great" goddess worshipped among heathen nations
under various modifications. Her most noted temple was that at Ephesus.
It was built outside the city walls, and was one of the seven wonders of
the ancient world. "First and last it was the work of 220 years; built
of shining marble; 342 feet long by 164 feet broad; supported by a
forest of columns, each 56 feet high; a sacred museum of masterpieces of
sculpture and painting. At the centre, hidden by curtains, within a
gorgeous shrine, stood the very ancient image of the goddess, on wood or
ebony reputed to have fallen from the sky. Behind the shrine was a
treasury, where, as in 'the safest bank in Asia,' nations and kings
stored their most precious things. The temple as St. Paul saw it
subsisted till A.D. 262, when it was ruined by the Goths" (Acts
19:23-41)., Moule on Ephesians: Introd.

<span id="003">**Diblaim**</span> Doubled cakes, the mother of Gomer,
who was Hosea's wife ([Hos 1:3](../kjv/hos001.htm#003)).

<span id="004">**Diblathaim**</span> Two cakes, a city of Moab, on the
east of the Dead Sea ([Num 33:46](../kjv/num033.htm#046); [Jer
48:22](../kjv/jer048.htm#022)).

<span id="005">**Dibon**</span> Pining; wasting. (1.) A city in Moab
([Num 21:30](../kjv/num021.htm#030)); called also Dibon-gad ([Num
33:45](../kjv/num033.htm#045)), because it was built by Gad and Dimon
([Isa 15:9](../kjv/isa015.htm#009)). It has been identified with the
modern Diban, about 3 miles north of the Arnon and 12 miles east of the
Dead Sea. (See MOABITE STONE.) (2.) A city of the tribe of Judah,
inhabited after the Captivity ([Neh 11:25](../kjv/neh011.htm#025));
called also Dimonah ([Jos 15:22](../kjv/jos015.htm#022)). It is probably
the modern ed-Dheib.

<span id="006">**Didymus**</span> (Gr. twin = Heb. Thomas , (q.v.), [Joh
11:16](../kjv/joh011.htm#016); [Joh 20:24](../kjv/joh020.htm#024); [Joh
21:2](../kjv/joh021.htm#002).

<span id="007">**Dimnah**</span> Dunghill, a city of Zebulun given to
the Merarite Levites ([Jos 21:35](../kjv/jos021.htm#035)). In [Ch1
6:77](../kjv/ch1006.htm#077) the name "Rimmon" is substituted.

<span id="008">**Dinah**</span> Judged; vindicated, daughter of Jacob by
Leah, and sister of Simeon and Levi ([Gen
30:21](../kjv/gen030.htm#021)). She was seduced by Shechem, the son of
Hamor, the Hivite chief, when Jacob's camp was in the neighbourhood of
Shechem. This led to the terrible revenge of Simeon and Levi in putting
the Shechemites to death (Gen. 34). Jacob makes frequent reference to
this deed of blood with abhorrence and regret ([Gen
34:30](../kjv/gen034.htm#030); [Gen 49:5](../kjv/gen049.htm#005)). She
is mentioned among the rest of Jacob's family that went down into Egypt
([Gen 46:8](../kjv/gen046.htm#008), [Gen 46:15](../kjv/gen046.htm#015)).

<span id="009">**Dine**</span> ([Gen 43:16](../kjv/gen043.htm#016)) It
was the custom in Egypt to dine at noon. But it is probable that the
Egyptians took their principal meal in the evening, as was the general
custom in the East ([Luk 14:12](../kjv/luk014.htm#012)).
