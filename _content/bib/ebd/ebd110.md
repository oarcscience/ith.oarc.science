<span id="000">**Dwell**</span> Tents were in primitive times the common
dwellings of men. Houses were afterwards built, the walls of which were
frequently of mud ([Job 24:16](../kjv/job024.htm#016); [Mat
6:19](../kjv/mat006.htm#019), [Mat 6:20](../kjv/mat006.htm#020)) or of
sun-dried bricks. God "dwells in light" ([Ti1
6:16](../kjv/ti1006.htm#016); [Jo1 1:7](../kjv/jo1001.htm#007)), in
heaven ([Psa 123:1](../kjv/psa123.htm#001)), in his church ([Psa
9:11](../kjv/psa009.htm#011); [Jo1 4:12](../kjv/jo1004.htm#012)). Christ
dwelt on earth in the days of his humiliation ([Joh
1:14](../kjv/joh001.htm#014)). He now dwells in the hearts of his people
([Eph 3:17](../kjv/eph003.htm#017)). The Holy Spirit dwells in believers
([Co1 3:16](../kjv/co1003.htm#016); [Ti2 1:14](../kjv/ti2001.htm#014)).
We are exhorted to "let the word of God dwell in us richly" ([Col
3:16](../kjv/col003.htm#016); [Psa 119:11](../kjv/psa119.htm#011)).
Dwell deep occurs only in [Jer 49:8](../kjv/jer049.htm#008), and refers
to the custom of seeking refuge from impending danger, in retiring to
the recesses of rocks and caverns, or to remote places in the desert.

<span id="001">**Dwellings**</span> The materials used in buildings were
commonly bricks, sometimes also stones ([Lev
14:40](../kjv/lev014.htm#040), [Lev 14:42](../kjv/lev014.htm#042)),
which were held together by cement ([Jer 43:9](../kjv/jer043.htm#009))
or bitumen ([Gen 11:3](../kjv/gen011.htm#003)). The exterior was usually
whitewashed ([Lev 14:41](../kjv/lev014.htm#041); [Eze
13:10](../kjv/eze013.htm#010); [Mat 23:27](../kjv/mat023.htm#027)). The
beams were of sycamore ([Isa 9:10](../kjv/isa009.htm#010)), or
olive-wood, or cedar ([Kg1 7:2](../kjv/kg1007.htm#002); [Isa
9:10](../kjv/isa009.htm#010)). The form of Eastern dwellings differed in
many respects from that of dwellings in Western lands. The larger houses
were built in a quadrangle enclosing a court-yard ([Luk
5:19](../kjv/luk005.htm#019); [Sa2 17:18](../kjv/sa2017.htm#018); [Neh
8:16](../kjv/neh008.htm#016)) surrounded by galleries, which formed the
guest-chamber or reception-room for visitors. The flat roof, surrounded
by a low parapet, was used for many domestic and social purposes. It was
reached by steps from the court. In connection with it ([Kg2
23:12](../kjv/kg2023.htm#012)) was an upper room, used as a private
chamber ([Sa2 18:33](../kjv/sa2018.htm#033); [Dan
6:11](../kjv/dan006.htm#011)), also as a bedroom ([Kg2
23:12](../kjv/kg2023.htm#012)), a sleeping apartment for guests ([Kg2
4:10](../kjv/kg2004.htm#010)), and as a sick-chamber ([Kg1
17:19](../kjv/kg1017.htm#019)). The doors, sometimes of stone, swung on
mortised pivots, and were generally fastened by wooden bolts. The houses
of the more wealthy had a doorkeeper or a female porter ([Joh
18:16](../kjv/joh018.htm#016); [Act 12:13](../kjv/act012.htm#013)). The
windows generally opened into the courtyard, and were closed by a
lattice ([Jdg 5:28](../kjv/jdg005.htm#028)). The interior rooms were set
apart for the female portion of the household. The furniture of the room
([Kg2 4:10](../kjv/kg2004.htm#010)) consisted of a couch furnished with
pillows ([Amo 6:4](../kjv/amo006.htm#004); [Eze
13:20](../kjv/eze013.htm#020)); and besides this, chairs, a table and
lanterns or lamp-stands ([Kg2 4:10](../kjv/kg2004.htm#010)).

<span id="002">**Dye**</span> The art of dyeing is one of great
antiquity, although no special mention is made of it in the Old
Testament. The Hebrews probably learned it from the Egyptians (see [Exo
26:1](../kjv/exo026.htm#001); [Exo 28:5](../kjv/exo028.htm#005)), who
brought it to great perfection. In New Testament times Thyatira was
famed for its dyers ([Act 16:14](../kjv/act016.htm#014)). (See COLOURS.)

<span id="003">**Eagle**</span> (Heb. nesher ; properly the griffon
vulture or great vulture, so called from its tearing its prey with its
beak), referred to for its swiftness of flight ([Deu
28:49](../kjv/deu028.htm#049); [Sa2 1:23](../kjv/sa2001.htm#023)), its
mounting high in the air ([Job 39:27](../kjv/job039.htm#027)), its
strength ([Psa 103:5](../kjv/psa103.htm#005)), its setting its nest in
high places ([Jer 49:16](../kjv/jer049.htm#016)), and its power of
vision ([Job 39:27](../kjv/job039.htm#027)). This "ravenous bird" is a
symbol of those nations whom God employs and sends forth to do a work of
destruction, sweeping away whatever is decaying and putrescent ([Mat
24:28](../kjv/mat024.htm#028); [Isa 46:11](../kjv/isa046.htm#011); [Eze
39:4](../kjv/eze039.htm#004); [Deu 28:49](../kjv/deu028.htm#049); [Jer
4:13](../kjv/jer004.htm#013); [Jer 48:40](../kjv/jer048.htm#040)). It is
said that the eagle sheds his feathers in the beginning of spring, and
with fresh plumage assumes the appearance of youth. To this, allusion is
made in [Psa 103:5](../kjv/psa103.htm#005) and [Isa
40:31](../kjv/isa040.htm#031). God's care over his people is likened to
that of the eagle in training its young to fly ([Exo
19:4](../kjv/exo019.htm#004); [Deu 32:11](../kjv/deu032.htm#011), [Deu
32:12](../kjv/deu032.htm#012)). An interesting illustration is thus
recorded by Sir Humphry Davy: "I once saw a very interesting sight above
the crags of Ben Nevis. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring,
two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the
top of the mountain in the eye of the sun. It was about mid-day, and
bright for the climate. They at first made small circles, and the young
birds imitated them. They paused on their wings, waiting till they had
made their flight, and then took a second and larger gyration, always
rising toward the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight so as to
make a gradually ascending spiral. The young ones still and slowly
followed, apparently flying better as they mounted; and they continued
this sublime exercise, always rising till they became mere points in the
air, and the young ones were lost, and afterwards their parents, to our
aching sight." (See [Isa 40:31](../kjv/isa040.htm#031).) There have been
observed in Palestine four distinct species of eagles, (1.) the golden
eagle (Aquila chrysaetos); (2.) the spotted eagle (Aquila naevia); (3.)
the common species, the imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca); and (4.) the
Circaetos gallicus, which preys on reptiles. The eagle was unclean by
the Levitical law ([Lev 11:13](../kjv/lev011.htm#013); [Deu
14:12](../kjv/deu014.htm#012)).

<span id="004">**Ear**</span> Used frequently in a figurative sense
([Psa 34:15](../kjv/psa034.htm#015)). To "uncover the ear" is to show
respect to a person ([Sa1 20:2](../kjv/sa1020.htm#002) marg.). To have
the "ear heavy", or to have "uncircumcised ears" ([Isa
6:10](../kjv/isa006.htm#010)), is to be inattentive and disobedient. To
have the ear "bored" through with an awl was a sign of perpetual
servitude ([Exo 21:6](../kjv/exo021.htm#006)).

<span id="005">**Earing**</span> An Old English word (from the Latin aro
, I plough), meaning "ploughing." It is used in the Authorized Version
in [Gen 45:6](../kjv/gen045.htm#006); [Exo
34:21](../kjv/exo034.htm#021); [Sa1 8:12](../kjv/sa1008.htm#012); [Deu
21:4](../kjv/deu021.htm#004); [Isa 30:24](../kjv/isa030.htm#024); but
the Revised Version has rendered the original in these places by the
ordinary word to plough or till.

<span id="006">**Earnest**</span> The Spirit is the earnest of the
believer's destined inheritance ([Co2 1:22](../kjv/co2001.htm#022); [Co2
5:5](../kjv/co2005.htm#005); [Eph 1:14](../kjv/eph001.htm#014)). The
word thus rendered is the same as that rendered "pledge" in [Gen
38:17](../kjv/gen038.htm#017); "indeed, the Hebrew word has simply
passed into the Greek and Latin languages, probably through commercial
dealings with the Phoenicians, the great trading people of ancient days.
Originally it meant no more than a pledge; but in common usage it came
to denote that particular kind of pledge which is a part of the full
price of an article paid in advance; and as it is joined with the figure
of a seal when applied to the Spirit, it seems to be used by Paul in
this specific sense." The Spirit's gracious presence and working in
believers is a foretaste to them of the blessedness of heaven. God is
graciously pleased to give not only pledges but foretastes of future
blessedness.

<span id="007">**Earrings**</span> Rings properly for the ear ([Gen
35:4](../kjv/gen035.htm#004); [Num 31:50](../kjv/num031.htm#050); [Eze
16:12](../kjv/eze016.htm#012)). In [Gen 24:47](../kjv/gen024.htm#047)
the word means a nose-jewel, and is so rendered in the Revised Version.
In [Isa 3:20](../kjv/isa003.htm#020) the Authorized Version has
"ear-rings," and the Revised Version "amulets," which more correctly
represents the original word (lehashim), which means incantations;
charms, thus remedies against enchantment, worn either suspended from
the neck or in the ears of females. Ear-rings were ornaments used by
both sexes ([Exo 32:2](../kjv/exo032.htm#002)).

<span id="008">**Earth**</span> (1.) In the sense of soil or ground, the
translation of the word adamah' . In [Gen 9:20](../kjv/gen009.htm#020)
"husbandman" is literally "man of the ground or earth." Altars were to
be built of earth ([Exo 20:24](../kjv/exo020.htm#024)). Naaman asked for
two mules' burden of earth ([Kg2 5:17](../kjv/kg2005.htm#017)), under
the superstitious notion that Jehovah, like the gods of the heathen,
could be acceptably worshipped only on his own soil. (2.) As the
rendering of 'erets , it means the whole world ([Gen
1:2](../kjv/gen001.htm#002)); the land as opposed to the sea ([Gen
1:10](../kjv/gen001.htm#010)). 'Erets also denotes a country ([Gen
21:32](../kjv/gen021.htm#032)); a plot of ground ([Gen
23:15](../kjv/gen023.htm#015)); the ground on which a man stands ([Gen
33:3](../kjv/gen033.htm#003)); the inhabitants of the earth ([Gen
6:1](../kjv/gen006.htm#001); [Gen 11:1](../kjv/gen011.htm#001)); all the
world except Israel ([Ch2 13:9](../kjv/ch2013.htm#009)). In the New
Testament "the earth" denotes the land of Judea ([Mat
23:35](../kjv/mat023.htm#035)); also things carnal in contrast with
things heavenly ([Joh 3:31](../kjv/joh003.htm#031); [Col
3:1](../kjv/col003.htm#001), [Col 3:2](../kjv/col003.htm#002)).

<span id="009">**Earthquake**</span> Mentioned among the extraordinary
phenomena of Palestine ([Psa 18:7](../kjv/psa018.htm#007); compare [Hab
3:6](../kjv/hab003.htm#006); [Nah 1:5](../kjv/nah001.htm#005); [Isa
5:25](../kjv/isa005.htm#025)). The first earthquake in Palestine of
which we have any record happened in the reign of Ahab ([Kg1
19:11](../kjv/kg1019.htm#011), [Kg1 19:12](../kjv/kg1019.htm#012)).
Another took place in the days of Uzziah, King of Judah ([Zac
14:5](../kjv/zac014.htm#005)). The most memorable earthquake taking
place in New Testament times happened at the crucifixion of our Lord
([Mat 27:54](../kjv/mat027.htm#054)). An earthquake at Philippi shook
the prison in which Paul and Silas were imprisoned ([Act
16:26](../kjv/act016.htm#026)). It is used figuratively as a token of
the presence of the Lord ([Jdg 5:4](../kjv/jdg005.htm#004); [Sa2
22:8](../kjv/sa2022.htm#008); [Psa 77:18](../kjv/psa077.htm#018); [Psa
97:4](../kjv/psa097.htm#004); [Psa 104:32](../kjv/psa104.htm#032)).
