<P><A NAME="000"><B>Ah!</B></A>     An exclamation of sorrow or regret (<A HREF="../kjv/psa035.htm#025">Psa 35:25</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa001.htm#004">Isa 1:4</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/isa001.htm#024">Isa 1:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer001.htm#006">Jer 1:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer022.htm#018">Jer 22:18</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar015.htm#029">Mar 15:29</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Aha</B></A>     An exclamation of ridicule (<A HREF="../kjv/psa035.htm#021">Psa 35:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa040.htm#015">Psa 40:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa070.htm#003">Psa 70:3</A>). In <A HREF="../kjv/isa044.htm#016">Isa 44:16</A> it signifies joyful surprise, as also in <A HREF="../kjv/job039.htm#025">Job 39:25</A>, R.V.

<P><A NAME="002"><B>Ahab</B></A>     Father's brother.     (1.) The son of Omri, whom he succeeded as the seventh king of Israel. His history is recorded in 1 Kings 16-22. His wife was Jezebel (q.v.), who exercised a very evil influence over him. To the calf-worship introduced by Jeroboam he added the worship of Baal. He was severely admonished by Elijah (q.v.) for his wickedness. His anger was on this account kindled against the prophet, and he sought to kill him. He undertook three campaigns against Ben-hadad II., king of Damascus. In the first two, which were defensive, he gained a complete victory over Ben-hadad, who fell into his hands, and was afterwards released on the condition of his restoring all the cities of Israel he then held, and granting certain other concessions to Ahab. After three years of peace, for some cause Ahab renewed war (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1022.htm#003">Kg1 22:3</A>) with Ben-hadad by assaulting the city of Ramoth-gilead, although the prophet Micaiah warned him that he would not succeed, and that the 400 false prophets who encouraged him were only leading him to his ruin. Micaiah was imprisoned for thus venturing to dissuade Ahab from his purpose. Ahab went into the battle disguised, that he might if possible escape the notice of his enemies; but an arrow from a bow &quot;drawn at a venture&quot; pierced him, and though stayed up in his chariot for a time he died towards evening, and Elijah's prophecy (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1021.htm#019">Kg1 21:19</A>) was fulfilled. He reigned twenty-three years. Because of his idolatry, lust, and covetousness, Ahab is referred to as pre-eminently the type of a wicked king (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2008.htm#018">Kg2 8:18</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2022.htm#003">Ch2 22:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mic006.htm#016">Mic 6:16</A>). (2.) A false prophet referred to by Jeremiah (<A HREF="../kjv/jer029.htm#021">Jer 29:21</A>), of whom nothing further is known. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Ahasuerus</B></A>     There are three kings designated by this name in Scripture.     (1.) The father of Darius the Mede, mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/dan009.htm#001">Dan 9:1</A>. This was probably the Cyaxares I. known by this name in profane history, the king of Media and the conqueror of Nineveh. (2.) The king mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/ezr004.htm#006">Ezr 4:6</A>, probably the Cambyses of profane history, the son and successor of Cyrus (529 B.C.). (3.) The son of Darius Hystaspes, the king named in the Book of Esther. He ruled over the kingdoms of Persia, Media, and Babylonia, &quot;from India to Ethiopia.&quot; This was in all probability the Xerxes of profane history, who succeeded his father Darius (485 B.C.). In the LXX. version of the Book of Esther the name Artaxerxes occurs for Ahasuerus. He reigned for twenty-one years (486-465 B.C.). He invaded Greece with an army, it is said, of more than 2,000,000 soldiers, only 5,000 of whom returned with him. Leonidas, with his famous 300, arrested his progress at the Pass of Thermopylae, and then he was defeated disastrously by Themistocles at Salamis. It was after his return from this invasion that Esther was chosen as his queen.

<P><A NAME="004"><B>Ahava</B></A>     Water, the river (<A HREF="../kjv/ezr008.htm#021">Ezr 8:21</A>) by the banks of which the Jewish exiles assembled under Ezra when about to return to Jerusalem from Babylon. In all probability this was one of the streams of Mesopotamia which flowed into the Euphrates somewhere in the north-west of Babylonia. It has, however, been supposed to be the name of a place (<A HREF="../kjv/ezr008.htm#015">Ezr 8:15</A>) now called Hit, on the Euphrates, east of Damascus. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Ahaz</B></A>     Possessor.     (1.) A grandson of Jonathan (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1008.htm#035">Ch1 8:35</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1009.htm#042">Ch1 9:42</A>). (2.) The son and successor of Jotham, king of Judah (2 Kings 16; Isa. 7-9; 2 Chr. 28). He gave himself up to a life of wickedness and idolatry. Notwithstanding the remonstrances and warnings of Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah, he appealed for help against Rezin, king of Damascus, and Pekah, king of Israel, who threatened Jerusalem, to Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria, to the great injury of his kingdom and his own humiliating subjection to the Assyrians (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2016.htm#007">Kg2 16:7</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg2016.htm#009">Kg2 16:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2015.htm#029">Kg2 15:29</A>). He also introduced among his people many heathen and idolatrous customs (<A HREF="../kjv/isa008.htm#019">Isa 8:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa038.htm#008">Isa 38:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2023.htm#012">Kg2 23:12</A>). He died at the age of thirty-five years, after reigning sixteen years (740-724 B.C.), and was succeeded by his son Hezekiah. Because of his wickedness he was &quot;not brought into the sepulchre of the kings.&quot;

<P><A NAME="006"><B>Ahaziah</B></A>     Held by Jehovah.     (1.) The son and successor of Ahab. He followed the counsels of his mother Jezebel, and imitated in wickedness the ways of his father. In his reign the Moabites revolted from under his authority (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2003.htm#005">Kg2 3:5</A>). He united with Jehoshaphat in an attempt to revive maritime trade by the Red Sea, which proved a failure (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2020.htm#035">Ch2 20:35</A>). His messengers, sent to consult the god of Ekron regarding his recovery from the effects of a fall from the roof-gallery of his palace, were met on the way by Elijah, who sent them back to tell the king that he would never rise from his bed (1 Kings 22:51 - 2 Kings 1:18). (2.) The son of Joram, or Jehoram, and sixth king of Judah. Called Jehoahaz (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2021.htm#017">Ch2 21:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2025.htm#023">Ch2 25:23</A>), and Azariah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2022.htm#006">Ch2 22:6</A>). Guided by his idolatrous mother Athaliah, his reign was disastrous (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2008.htm#024">Kg2 8:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2009.htm#029">Kg2 9:29</A>). He joined his uncle Jehoram, king of Israel, in an expedition against Hazael, king of Damascus; but was wounded at the pass of Gur when attempting to escape, and had strength only to reach Megiddo, where he died (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2009.htm#022">Kg2 9:22</A>). He reigned only one year.

<P><A NAME="007"><B>Ahiam</B></A>     Mother's brother, one of David's thirty heroes (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2023.htm#033">Sa2 23:33</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1011.htm#035">Ch1 11:35</A>).

The chief of the tribe of Dan at the time of the Exodus (<A HREF="../kjv/num001.htm#012">Num 1:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num002.htm#025">Num 2:25</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num010.htm#025">Num 10:25</A>). (2.) The chief of the Benjamite slingers that repaired to David at Ziklag (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1012.htm#003">Ch1 12:3</A>). 
</P>

Name different in Hebrew, meaning brother of Judah. Chief of the tribe of Asher; one of those appointed by Moses to superintend the division of Canaan among the tribe (<A HREF="../kjv/num034.htm#027">Num 34:27</A>).
