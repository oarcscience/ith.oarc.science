<span id="000">**Reed**</span> (1.) "Paper reeds" ([Isa
19:7](../kjv/isa019.htm#007); R.V., "reeds"). Heb. 'aroth , properly
green herbage growing in marshy places. (2.) Heb. kaneh ([Kg1
14:15](../kjv/kg1014.htm#015); [Job 40:21](../kjv/job040.htm#021); [Isa
19:6](../kjv/isa019.htm#006)), whence the Gr. kanna , a "cane," a
generic name for a reed of any kind. The reed of Egypt and Palestine is
the Arundo donax, which grows to the height of 12 feet, its stalk
jointed like the bamboo, "with a magnificent panicle of blossom at the
top, and so slender and yielding that it will lie perfectly flat under a
gust of wind, and immediately resume its upright position." It is used
to illustrate weakness ([Kg2 18:21](../kjv/kg2018.htm#021); [Eze
29:6](../kjv/eze029.htm#006)), also fickleness or instability ([Mat
11:7](../kjv/mat011.htm#007); compare [Eph
4:14](../kjv/eph004.htm#014)). A "bruised reed" ([Isa
42:3](../kjv/isa042.htm#003); [Mat 12:20](../kjv/mat012.htm#020)) is an
emblem of a believer weak in grace. A reed was put into our Lord's hands
in derision ([Mat 27:29](../kjv/mat027.htm#029)); and "they took the
reed and smote him on the head" ([Mat 27:30](../kjv/mat027.htm#030)).
The "reed" on which they put the sponge filled with vinegar ([Mat
27:48](../kjv/mat027.htm#048)) was, according to John ([Joh
19:29](../kjv/joh019.htm#029)), a hyssop stalk, which must have been of
some length, or perhaps a bunch of hyssop twigs fastened to a rod with
the sponge. (See CANE.)

<span id="001">**Refiner**</span> The process of refining metals is
referred to by way of illustrations in [Isa
1:25](../kjv/isa001.htm#025); [Jer 6:29](../kjv/jer006.htm#029); [Zac
13:9](../kjv/zac013.htm#009); [Mal 3:2](../kjv/mal003.htm#002), [Mal
3:3](../kjv/mal003.htm#003).

<span id="002">**Refuge, Cities of**</span> Were six in number (Num.
35). On the west of Jordan were 1) Kadesh, in Naphtali; 2) Shechem, in
Mount Ephraim; 3) Hebron, in Judah. On the east of Jordan were, 4)
Golan, in Bashan; 5) Ramoth-Gilead, in Gad; and 6) Bezer, in Reuben.

<span id="003">**Regem-melech**</span> Friend of the king, one of the
two messengers sent by the exiled Jews to Jerusalem in the time of
Darius ([Zac 7:2](../kjv/zac007.htm#002)) to make inquiries at the
temple.

<span id="004">**Regeneration**</span> Only found in [Mat
19:28](../kjv/mat019.htm#028) and [Tit 3:5](../kjv/tit003.htm#005). This
word literally means a "new birth." The Greek word so rendered (
palingenesia ) is used by classical writers with reference to the
changes produced by the return of spring. In [Mat
19:28](../kjv/mat019.htm#028) the word is equivalent to the "restitution
of all things" ([Act 3:21](../kjv/act003.htm#021)). In [Tit
3:5](../kjv/tit003.htm#005) it denotes that change of heart elsewhere
spoken of as a passing from death to life ([Jo1
3:14](../kjv/jo1003.htm#014)); becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus
([Co2 5:17](../kjv/co2005.htm#017)); being born again ([Joh
3:5](../kjv/joh003.htm#005)); a renewal of the mind ([Rom
12:2](../kjv/rom012.htm#002)); a resurrection from the dead ([Eph
2:6](../kjv/eph002.htm#006)); a being quickened ([Eph
2:1](../kjv/eph002.htm#001), [Eph 2:5](../kjv/eph002.htm#005)). This
change is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. It originates not with man but
with God ([Joh 1:12](../kjv/joh001.htm#012), [Joh
1:13](../kjv/joh001.htm#013); [Jo1 2:29](../kjv/jo1002.htm#029); [Jo1
5:1](../kjv/jo1005.htm#001), [Jo1 5:4](../kjv/jo1005.htm#004)). As to
the nature of the change, it consists in the implanting of a new
principle or disposition in the soul; the impartation of spiritual life
to those who are by nature "dead in trespasses and sins." The necessity
of such a change is emphatically affirmed in Scripture ([Joh
3:3](../kjv/joh003.htm#003); [Rom 7:18](../kjv/rom007.htm#018); [Rom
8:7](../kjv/rom008.htm#007); [Co1 2:14](../kjv/co1002.htm#014); [Eph
2:1](../kjv/eph002.htm#001); [Eph 4:21](../kjv/eph004.htm#021)).

<span id="005">**Rehabiah**</span> Enlargement of the Lord, the son of
Eliezer, and grandson of Moses ([Ch1 23:17](../kjv/ch1023.htm#017); [Ch1
24:21](../kjv/ch1024.htm#021)).

<span id="006">**Rehob**</span> Street; broad place. (1.) The father of
Hadadezer, king of Tobah ([Sa2 8:3](../kjv/sa2008.htm#003), [Sa2
8:12](../kjv/sa2008.htm#012)). (2.) [Neh 10:11](../kjv/neh010.htm#011).
(3.) The same, probably, as Beth-rehob ([Sa2
10:6](../kjv/sa2010.htm#006), [Sa2 10:8](../kjv/sa2010.htm#008); [Jdg
18:28](../kjv/jdg018.htm#028)), a place in the north of Palestine ([Num
13:21](../kjv/num013.htm#021)). It is now supposed to be represented by
the castle of Hunin, south-west of Dan, on the road from Hamath into
Coele-Syria. (4.) A town of Asher ([Jos 19:28](../kjv/jos019.htm#028)),
to the east of Zidon. (5.) Another town of Asher ([Jos
19:30](../kjv/jos019.htm#030)), kept possession of by the Canaanites
([Jdg 1:31](../kjv/jdg001.htm#031)).

<span id="007">**Rehoboam**</span> He enlarges the people, the successor
of Solomon on the throne, and apparently his only son. He was the son of
Naamah "the Ammonitess," some well-known Ammonitish princess ([Kg1
14:21](../kjv/kg1014.htm#021); [Ch2 12:13](../kjv/ch2012.htm#013)). He
was forty-one years old when he ascended the throne, and he reigned
seventeen years (975-958 B.C.). Although he was acknowledged at once as
the rightful heir to the throne, yet there was a strongly-felt desire to
modify the character of the government. The burden of taxation to which
they had been subjected during Solomon's reign was very oppressive, and
therefore the people assembled at Shechem and demanded from the king an
alleviation of their burdens. He went to meet them at Shechem, and heard
their demands for relief ([Kg1 12:4](../kjv/kg1012.htm#004)). After
three days, having consulted with a younger generation of courtiers that
had grown up around him, instead of following the advice of elders, he
answered the people haughtily ([Kg1 12:6](../kjv/kg1012.htm#006)). "The
king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord"
(Compare [Kg1 11:31](../kjv/kg1011.htm#031)). This brought matters
speedily to a crisis. The terrible cry was heard (Compare [Sa2
20:1](../kjv/sa2020.htm#001)): "What portion have we in David? Neither
have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: To your tents, O Israel: Now
see to thine own house, David" ([Kg1 12:16](../kjv/kg1012.htm#016)). And
now at once the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam was appalled, and
tried concessions, but it was too late ([Kg1
12:18](../kjv/kg1012.htm#018)). The tribe of Judah, Rehoboam's own
tribe, alone remained faithful to him. Benjamin was reckoned along with
Judah, and these two tribes formed the southern kingdom, with Jerusalem
as its capital; while the northern ten tribes formed themselves into a
separate kingdom, choosing Jeroboam as their king. Rehoboam tried to win
back the revolted ten tribes by making war against them, but he was
prevented by the prophet Shemaiah ([Kg1 12:21](../kjv/kg1012.htm#021);
[Ch2 11:1](../kjv/ch2011.htm#001)) from fulfilling his purpose. (See
JEROBOAM.) In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak (q.v.), one of
the kings of Egypt of the Assyrian dynasty, stirred up, no doubt, by
Jeroboam his son-in-law, made war against him. Jerusalem submitted to
the invader, who plundered the temple and virtually reduced the kingdom
to the position of a vassal of Egypt ([Kg1
14:25](../kjv/kg1014.htm#025), [Kg1 14:26](../kjv/kg1014.htm#026); [Ch2
12:5](../kjv/ch2012.htm#005)). A remarkable memorial of this invasion
has been discovered at Karnac, in Upper Egypt, in certain sculptures on
the walls of a small temple there. These sculptures represent the king,
Shishak, holding in his hand a train of prisoners and other figures,
with the names of the captured towns of Judah, the towns which Rehoboam
had fortified ([Ch2 11:5](../kjv/ch2011.htm#005)). The kingdom of Judah,
under Rehoboam, sank more and more in moral and spiritual decay. "There
was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days." At length, in the
fifty-eighth year of his age, Rehoboam "slept with his fathers, and was
buried with his fathers in the city of David" ([Kg1
14:31](../kjv/kg1014.htm#031)). He was succeeded by his son Abijah. (See
EGYPT.)

<span id="008">**Rehoboth**</span> Broad places. (1.) A well in Gerar
dug by Isaac ([Gen 26:22](../kjv/gen026.htm#022)), supposed to be in
Wady er-Ruheibeh , about 20 miles south of Beersheba. (2.) An ancient
city on the Euphrates ([Gen 36:37](../kjv/gen036.htm#037); [Ch1
1:48](../kjv/ch1001.htm#048)), " Rehoboth by the river." (3.) Named
among the cities of Asshur ([Gen 10:11](../kjv/gen010.htm#011)).
Probably, however, the words " rehoboth'ir " are to be translated as in
the Vulgate and the margin of A.V., "the streets of the city," or rather
"the public square of the city", i.e., of Nineveh.

<span id="009">**Rehum**</span> Merciful. (1.) One of "the children of
the province" who returned from the Captivity ([Ezr
2:2](../kjv/ezr002.htm#002)); the same as "Nehum" ([Neh
7:7](../kjv/neh007.htm#007)). (2.) The "chancellor" of Artaxerxes, who
sought to stir him up against the Jews (Ezra 4:8-24) and prevent the
rebuilding of the walls and the temple of Jerusalem. (3.) A Levite ([Neh
3:17](../kjv/neh003.htm#017)). (4.) [Neh 10:25](../kjv/neh010.htm#025).
(5.) A priest ([Neh 12:3](../kjv/neh012.htm#003)).
