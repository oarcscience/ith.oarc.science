<span id="000">**Bajith**</span> House, probably a city of Moab, which
had a celebrated idol-temple ([Isa 15:2](../kjv/isa015.htm#002)). It has
also been regarded as denoting simply the temple of the idol of Moab as
opposed to the "high place."

<span id="001">**Bake**</span> The duty of preparing bread was usually,
in ancient times, committed to the females or the slaves of the family
([Gen 18:6](../kjv/gen018.htm#006); [Lev 26:26](../kjv/lev026.htm#026);
[Sa1 8:13](../kjv/sa1008.htm#013)); but at a later period we find a
class of public bakers mentioned ([Hos 7:4](../kjv/hos007.htm#004), [Hos
7:6](../kjv/hos007.htm#006); [Jer 37:21](../kjv/jer037.htm#021)). The
bread was generally in the form of long or round cakes ([Exo
29:23](../kjv/exo029.htm#023); [Sa1 2:36](../kjv/sa1002.htm#036)), of a
thinness that rendered them easily broken ([Isa
58:7](../kjv/isa058.htm#007); [Mat 14:19](../kjv/mat014.htm#019); [Mat
26:26](../kjv/mat026.htm#026); [Act 20:11](../kjv/act020.htm#011)).
Common ovens were generally used; at other times a jar was half-filled
with hot pebbles, and the dough was spread over them. Hence we read of
"cakes baken on the coals" ([Kg1 19:6](../kjv/kg1019.htm#006)), and
"baken in the oven" ([Lev 2:4](../kjv/lev002.htm#004)). (See BREAD.)

<span id="002">**Bake-meats**</span> Baked provisions ([Gen
40:17](../kjv/gen040.htm#017)), literally "works of the baker," such as
biscuits and cakes.

<span id="003">**Balaam**</span> Lord of the people; foreigner or
glutton, as interpreted by others, the son of Beor, was a man of some
rank among the Midianites ([Num 31:8](../kjv/num031.htm#008); compare
[Num 31:16](../kjv/num031.htm#016)). He resided at Pethor ([Deu
23:4](../kjv/deu023.htm#004)), in Mesopotamia ([Num
23:7](../kjv/num023.htm#007)). It is evident that though dwelling among
idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and was held in such
reputation that it was supposed that he whom he blessed was blessed, and
he whom he cursed was cursed. When the Israelites were encamped on the
plains of Moab, on the east of Jordan, by Jericho, Balak sent for Balaam
"from Aram, out of the mountains of the east," to curse them; but by the
remarkable interposition of God he was utterly unable to fulfill Balak's
wish, however desirous he was to do so. The apostle Peter refers ([Pe2
2:15](../kjv/pe2002.htm#015), [Pe2 2:16](../kjv/pe2002.htm#016)) to this
as an historical event. In [Mic 6:5](../kjv/mic006.htm#005) reference
also is made to the relations between Balaam and Balak. Though Balaam
could not curse Israel, yet he suggested a mode by which the divine
displeasure might be caused to descend upon them (Num. 25). In a battle
between Israel and the Midianites (q.v.) Balaam was slain while fighting
on the side of Balak ([Num 31:8](../kjv/num031.htm#008)). The "doctrine
of Balaam" is spoken of in [Rev 2:14](../kjv/rev002.htm#014), in
allusion to the fact that it was through the teaching of Balaam that
Balak learned the way by which the Israelites might be led into sin.
(See NICOLAITANES.) Balaam was constrained to utter prophecies regarding
the future of Israel of wonderful magnificence and beauty of expression
([Num 24:5](../kjv/num024.htm#005), [Num 24:17](../kjv/num024.htm#017)).

<span id="004">**Baladan**</span> He has given a son, the father of the
Babylonian king ([Kg2 20:12](../kjv/kg2020.htm#012); [Isa
39:1](../kjv/isa039.htm#001)) Merodach-baladan (q.v.).

<span id="005">**Balah**</span> A city in the tribe of Simeon ([Jos
19:3](../kjv/jos019.htm#003)), elsewhere called Bilhah ([Ch1
4:29](../kjv/ch1004.htm#029)) and Baalah ([Jos
15:29](../kjv/jos015.htm#029)).

<span id="006">**Balak**</span> Empty; spoiler, a son of Zippor, and
king of the Moabites ([Num 22:2](../kjv/num022.htm#002), [Num
22:4](../kjv/num022.htm#004)). From fear of the Israelites, who were
encamped near the confines of his territory, he applied to Balaam (q.v.)
to curse them; but in vain ([Jos 24:9](../kjv/jos024.htm#009)).

<span id="007">**Balance**</span> Occurs in [Lev
19:36](../kjv/lev019.htm#036) and [Isa 46:6](../kjv/isa046.htm#006), as
the rendering of the Hebrew kanch' , which properly means "a reed" or "a
cane," then a rod or beam of a balance. This same word is translated
"measuring reed" in [Eze 40:3](../kjv/eze040.htm#003), [Eze
40:5](../kjv/eze040.htm#005); [Eze 42:16](../kjv/eze042.htm#016). There
is another Hebrew word, mozena'yim , i.e., "two poisers", also so
rendered ([Dan 5:27](../kjv/dan005.htm#027)). The balances as
represented on the most ancient Egyptian monuments resemble those now in
use. A "pair of balances" is a symbol of justice and fair dealing ([Job
31:6](../kjv/job031.htm#006); [Psa 62:9](../kjv/psa062.htm#009); [Pro
11:1](../kjv/pro011.htm#001)). The expression denotes great want and
scarcity in [Rev 6:5](../kjv/rev006.htm#005).

<span id="008">**Baldness**</span> From natural causes was uncommon
([Kg2 2:23](../kjv/kg2002.htm#023); [Isa 3:24](../kjv/isa003.htm#024)).
It was included apparently under "scab" and "scurf," which disqualified
for the priesthood ([Lev 21:20](../kjv/lev021.htm#020)). The Egyptians
were rarely subject to it. This probably arose from their custom of
constantly shaving the head, only allowing the hair to grow as a sign of
mourning. With the Jews artificial baldness was a sign of mourning ([Isa
22:12](../kjv/isa022.htm#012); [Jer 7:29](../kjv/jer007.htm#029); [Jer
16:6](../kjv/jer016.htm#006)); it also marked the conclusion of a
Nazarite's vow ([Act 18:18](../kjv/act018.htm#018); [Act
21:24](../kjv/act021.htm#024); [Num 6:9](../kjv/num006.htm#009)). It is
often alluded to ([Mic 1:16](../kjv/mic001.htm#016); [Amo
8:10](../kjv/amo008.htm#010); [Jer 47:5](../kjv/jer047.htm#005)). The
Jews were forbidden to follow the customs of surrounding nations in
making themselves bald ([Deu 14:1](../kjv/deu014.htm#001)).

<span id="009">**Balm**</span> Contracted from Balsam, a general name
for many oily or resinous substances which flow or trickle from certain
trees or plants when an incision is made through the bark. (1.) This
word occurs in the Authorized Version ([Gen
37:25](../kjv/gen037.htm#025); [Gen 43:11](../kjv/gen043.htm#011); [Jer
8:22](../kjv/jer008.htm#022); [Jer 46:11](../kjv/jer046.htm#011); [Jer
51:8](../kjv/jer051.htm#008); [Eze 27:17](../kjv/eze027.htm#017)) as the
rendering of the Hebrew word tsori or tseri, which denotes the gum of a
tree growing in Gilead (q.v.), which is very precious. It was celebrated
for its medicinal qualities, and was circulated as an article of
merchandise by Arab and Phoenician merchants. The shrub so named was
highly valued, and was almost peculiar to Palestine. In the time of
Josephus it was cultivated in the neighbourhood of Jericho and the Dead
Sea. There is an Arab tradition that the tree yielding this balm was
brought by the queen of Sheba as a present to Solomon, and that he
planted it in his gardens at Jericho. (2.) There is another Hebrew word,
basam or bosem, from which our word "balsam," as well as the
corresponding Greek balsamon , is derived. It is rendered "spice" ([Sol
5:1](../kjv/sol005.htm#001), [Sol 5:13](../kjv/sol005.htm#013); [Sol
6:2](../kjv/sol006.htm#002); margin of Revised Version, "balsam;" [Exo
35:28](../kjv/exo035.htm#028); [Kg1 10:10](../kjv/kg1010.htm#010)), and
denotes fragrance in general. Basam also denotes the true balsam-plant,
a native of South Arabia (Cant. l.c.).
