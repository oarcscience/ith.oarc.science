<span id="000">**Rye**</span> =Rie (Heb. kussemeth ), found in [Exo
9:32](../kjv/exo009.htm#032); [Isa 28:25](../kjv/isa028.htm#025), in all
of which the margins of the Authorized and of the Revised Versions have
"spelt." This Hebrew word also occurs in [Eze
4:9](../kjv/eze004.htm#009), where the Authorized Version has "fitches"
(q.v.) and the Revised Version "spelt." This, there can be no doubt, was
the Triticum spelta, a species of hard, rough-grained wheat.

<span id="001">**Sabachthani**</span> Thou hast forsaken me, one of the
Aramaic words uttered by our Lord on the cross ([Mat
27:46](../kjv/mat027.htm#046); [Mar 15:34](../kjv/mar015.htm#034)).

<span id="002">**Sabaoth**</span> The transliteration of the Hebrew word
tsebha'oth , meaning "hosts," "armies" ([Rom
9:29](../kjv/rom009.htm#029); [Jam 5:4](../kjv/jam005.htm#004)). In the
LXX. the Hebrew word is rendered by "Almighty." (See [Rev
4:8](../kjv/rev004.htm#008); compare [Isa 6:3](../kjv/isa006.htm#003).)
It may designate Jehovah as either (1.) God of the armies of earth, or
(2.) God of the armies of the stars, or (3.) God of the unseen armies of
angels; or perhaps it may include all these ideas.

<span id="003">**Sabbath**</span> (Heb. verb shabbath , meaning "to rest
from labour"), the day of rest. It is first mentioned as having been
instituted in Paradise, when man was in innocence ([Gen
2:2](../kjv/gen002.htm#002)). "The sabbath was made for man," as a day
of rest and refreshment for the body and of blessing to the soul. It is
next referred to in connection with the gift of manna to the children of
Israel in the wilderness ([Exo 16:23](../kjv/exo016.htm#023)); and
afterwards, when the law was given from Sinai ([Exo
20:11](../kjv/exo020.htm#011)), the people were solemnly charged to
"remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy." Thus it is spoken of as an
institution already existing. In the Mosaic law strict regulations were
laid down regarding its observance ([Exo 35:2](../kjv/exo035.htm#002),
[Exo 35:3](../kjv/exo035.htm#003); [Lev 23:3](../kjv/lev023.htm#003);
[Lev 26:34](../kjv/lev026.htm#034)). These were peculiar to that
dispensation. In the subsequent history of the Jews frequent references
are made to the sanctity of the Sabbath ([Isa
56:2](../kjv/isa056.htm#002), [Isa 56:4](../kjv/isa056.htm#004), [Isa
56:6](../kjv/isa056.htm#006), [Isa 56:7](../kjv/isa056.htm#007); [Isa
58:13](../kjv/isa058.htm#013), [Isa 58:14](../kjv/isa058.htm#014); [Jer
17:20](../kjv/jer017.htm#020); [Neh 13:19](../kjv/neh013.htm#019)). In
later times they perverted the Sabbath by their traditions. Our Lord
rescued it from their perversions, and recalled to them its true nature
and intent ([Mat 12:10](../kjv/mat012.htm#010); [Mar
2:27](../kjv/mar002.htm#027); [Luk 13:10](../kjv/luk013.htm#010)). The
Sabbath, originally instituted for man at his creation, is of permanent
and universal obligation. The physical necessities of man require a
Sabbath of rest. He is so constituted that his bodily welfare needs at
least one day in seven for rest from ordinary labour. Experience also
proves that the moral and spiritual necessities of men also demand a
Sabbath of rest. "I am more and more sure by experience that the reason
for the observance of the Sabbath lies deep in the everlasting
necessities of human nature, and that as long as man is man the
blessedness of keeping it, not as a day of rest only, but as a day of
spiritual rest, will never be annulled. I certainly do feel by
experience the eternal obligation, because of the eternal necessity, of
the Sabbath. The soul withers without it. It thrives in proportion to
its observance. The Sabbath was made for man. God made it for men in a
certain spiritual state because they needed it. The need, therefore, is
deeply hidden in human nature. He who can dispense with it must be holy
and spiritual indeed. And he who, still unholy and unspiritual, would
yet dispense with it is a man that would fain be wiser than his Maker"
(F. W. Robertson). The ancient Babylonian calendar, as seen from
recently recovered inscriptions on the bricks among the ruins of the
royal palace, was based on the division of time into weeks of seven
days. The Sabbath is in these inscriptions designated Sabattu, and
defined as "a day of rest for the heart" and "a day of completion of
labour." The change of the day. Originally at creation the seventh day
of the week was set apart and consecrated as the Sabbath. The first day
of the week is now observed as the Sabbath. Has God authorized this
change? There is an obvious distinction between the Sabbath as an
institution and the particular day set apart for its observance. The
question, therefore, as to the change of the day in no way affects the
perpetual obligation of the Sabbath as an institution. Change of the day
or no change, the Sabbath remains as a sacred institution the same. It
cannot be abrogated. If any change of the day has been made, it must
have been by Christ or by his authority. Christ has a right to make such
a change ([Mar 2:23](../kjv/mar002.htm#023)). As Creator, Christ was the
original Lord of the Sabbath ([Joh 1:3](../kjv/joh001.htm#003); [Heb
1:10](../kjv/heb001.htm#010)). It was originally a memorial of creation.
A work vastly greater than that of creation has now been accomplished by
him, the work of redemption. We would naturally expect just such a
change as would make the Sabbath a memorial of that greater work. True,
we can give no text authorizing the change in so many words. We have no
express law declaring the change. But there are evidences of another
kind. We know for a fact that the first day of the week has been
observed from apostolic times, and the necessary conclusion is, that it
was observed by the apostles and their immediate disciples. This, we may
be sure, they never would have done without the permission or the
authority of their Lord. After his resurrection, which took place on the
first day of the week ([Mat 28:1](../kjv/mat028.htm#001); [Mar
16:2](../kjv/mar016.htm#002); [Luk 24:1](../kjv/luk024.htm#001); [Joh
20:1](../kjv/joh020.htm#001)), we never find Christ meeting with his
disciples on the seventh day. But he specially honoured the first day by
manifesting himself to them on four separate occasions ([Mat
28:9](../kjv/mat028.htm#009); [Luk 24:34](../kjv/luk024.htm#034), 18-33;
[Joh 20:19](../kjv/joh020.htm#019)). Again, on the next first day of the
week, Jesus appeared to his disciples ([Joh
20:26](../kjv/joh020.htm#026)). Some have calculated that Christ's
ascension took place on the first day of the week. And there can be no
doubt that the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was on that day
([Act 2:1](../kjv/act002.htm#001)). Thus Christ appears as instituting a
new day to be observed by his people as the Sabbath, a day to be
henceforth known amongst them as the "Lord's day." The observance of
this "Lord's day" as the Sabbath was the general custom of the primitive
churches, and must have had apostolic sanction (compare [Act
20:3](../kjv/act020.htm#003); [Co1 16:1](../kjv/co1016.htm#001), [Co1
16:2](../kjv/co1016.htm#002)) and authority, and so the sanction and
authority of Jesus Christ. The words "at her sabbaths" ([Lam
1:7](../kjv/lam001.htm#007), A.V.) ought probably to be, as in the
Revised Version, "at her desolations."

<span id="004">**Sabbath Day's Journey**</span> Supposed to be a
distance of 2,000 cubits, or less than half-a-mile, the distance to
which, according to Jewish tradition, it was allowable to travel on the
Sabbath day without violating the law ([Act
1:12](../kjv/act001.htm#012); compare [Exo
16:29](../kjv/exo016.htm#029); [Num 35:5](../kjv/num035.htm#005); [Jos
3:4](../kjv/jos003.htm#004)).

<span id="005">**Sabbatical Year**</span> Every seventh year, during
which the land, according to the law of Moses, had to remain
uncultivated ([Lev 25:2](../kjv/lev025.htm#002); compare [Exo
23:10](../kjv/exo023.htm#010), [Exo 23:11](../kjv/exo023.htm#011), [Exo
23:12](../kjv/exo023.htm#012); [Lev 26:34](../kjv/lev026.htm#034), [Lev
26:35](../kjv/lev026.htm#035)). Whatever grew of itself during that year
was not for the owner of the land, but for the poor and the stranger and
the beasts of the field. All debts, except those of foreigners, were to
be remitted ([Deu 15:1](../kjv/deu015.htm#001)). There is little notice
of the observance of this year in Biblical history. It appears to have
been much neglected ([Ch2 36:20](../kjv/ch2036.htm#020), [Ch2
36:21](../kjv/ch2036.htm#021)).

<span id="006">**Sabeans**</span> Descendants of Seba ([Gen
10:7](../kjv/gen010.htm#007)); Africans ([Isa
43:3](../kjv/isa043.htm#003)). They were "men of stature," and engaged
in merchandise ([Isa 45:14](../kjv/isa045.htm#014)). Their conversion to
the Lord was predicted ([Psa 72:10](../kjv/psa072.htm#010)). This word,
in [Eze 23:42](../kjv/eze023.htm#042), should be read, as in the margin
of the Authorized Version, and in the Revised Version, "drunkards."
Another tribe, apparently given to war, is mentioned in [Job
1:15](../kjv/job001.htm#015).

<span id="007">**Sabtah**</span> Rest, the third son of Cush ([Gen
10:7](../kjv/gen010.htm#007); [Ch1 1:9](../kjv/ch1001.htm#009)).

<span id="008">**Sabtecha**</span> The fifth son of Cush (id.).

<span id="009">**Sachar**</span> Hire. (1.) One of David's heroes ([Ch1
11:35](../kjv/ch1011.htm#035)); called also Sharar ([Sa2
23:33](../kjv/sa2023.htm#033)). (2.) A son of Obed-edom the Gittite, and
a temple porter ([Ch1 26:4](../kjv/ch1026.htm#004)).
