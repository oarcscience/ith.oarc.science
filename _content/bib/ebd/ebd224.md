<span id="000">**Laodicea, Epistle from**</span> ([Col
4:16](../kjv/col004.htm#016)), was probably the Epistle to the
Ephesians, as designed for general circulation. It would reach the
Colossians by way of Laodicea.

<span id="001">**Lapidoth**</span> Torches. Deborah is called "the wife
of Lapidoth" ([Jdg 4:4](../kjv/jdg004.htm#004)). Some have rendered the
expression "a woman of a fiery spirit," under the supposition that
Lapidoth is not a proper name, a woman of a torch-like spirit.

<span id="002">**Lapping**</span> Of water like a dog, i.e., by putting
the hand filled with water to the mouth. The dog drinks by shaping the
end of his long thin tongue into the form of a spoon, thus rapidly
lifting up water, which he throws into his mouth. The three hundred men
that went with Gideon thus employed their hands and lapped the water out
of their hands ([Jdg 7:7](../kjv/jdg007.htm#007)).

<span id="003">**Lapwing**</span> The name of an unclean bird, mentioned
only in [Lev 11:19](../kjv/lev011.htm#019) and [Deu
14:18](../kjv/deu014.htm#018). The Hebrew name of this bird, dukiphath,
has been generally regarded as denoting the hoope (Upupa epops), an
onomatopoetic word derived from the cry of the bird, which resembles the
word "hoop;" a bird not uncommon in Palestine. Others identify it with
the English peewit.

<span id="004">**Lasaea**</span> A city in the island of Crete ([Act
27:8](../kjv/act027.htm#008)). Its ruins are still found near Cape
Leonda, about 5 miles east of "Fair Havens."

<span id="005">**Lasha**</span> Fissure, a place apparently east of the
Dead Sea ([Gen 10:19](../kjv/gen010.htm#019)). It was afterwards known
as Callirhoe, a place famous for its hot springs.

<span id="006">**Latchet**</span> A thong ([Act
22:25](../kjv/act022.htm#025)), cord, or strap fastening the sandal on
the foot ([Isa 5:27](../kjv/isa005.htm#027); [Mar
1:7](../kjv/mar001.htm#007); [Luk 3:16](../kjv/luk003.htm#016)).

<span id="007">**Latin**</span> The vernacular language of the ancient
Romans ([Joh 19:20](../kjv/joh019.htm#020)).

<span id="008">**Lattice**</span> (1.) Heb. 'eshnabh , a latticed
opening through which the cool breeze passes ([Jdg
5:28](../kjv/jdg005.htm#028)). The flat roofs of the houses were
sometimes enclosed with a parapet of lattice-work on wooden frames, to
screen the women of the house from the gaze of the neighbourhood. (2.)
Heb. harakim , the network or lattice of a window ([Sol
2:9](../kjv/sol002.htm#009)). (3.) Heb. sebakhah , the latticed
balustrade before a window or balcony ([Kg2
1:2](../kjv/kg2001.htm#002)). The lattice window is frequently used in
Eastern countries.

<span id="009">**Laver**</span> (Heb. kiyor ), a "basin" for boiling in,
a "pan" for cooking ([Sa1 2:14](../kjv/sa1002.htm#014)), a "fire-pan" or
hearth ([Zac 12:6](../kjv/zac012.htm#006)), the sacred wash-bowl of the
tabernacle and temple ([Exo 30:18](../kjv/exo030.htm#018), [Exo
30:28](../kjv/exo030.htm#028); [Exo 31:9](../kjv/exo031.htm#009); [Exo
35:16](../kjv/exo035.htm#016); [Exo 38:8](../kjv/exo038.htm#008); [Exo
39:39](../kjv/exo039.htm#039); [Exo 40:7](../kjv/exo040.htm#007), [Exo
40:11](../kjv/exo040.htm#011), [Exo 40:30](../kjv/exo040.htm#030),
etc.), a basin for the water used by the priests in their ablutions.
That which was originally used in the tabernacle was of brass (rather
copper; Heb. nihsheth ), made from the metal mirrors the women brought
out of Egypt ([Exo 38:8](../kjv/exo038.htm#008)). It contained water
wherewith the priests washed their hands and feet when they entered the
tabernacle ([Exo 40:32](../kjv/exo040.htm#032)). It stood in the court
between the altar and the door of the tabernacle ([Exo
30:19](../kjv/exo030.htm#019), [Exo 30:21](../kjv/exo030.htm#021)). In
the temple there were ten lavers used for the sacrifices, and the molten
sea for the ablutions of the priests ([Ch2 4:6](../kjv/ch2004.htm#006)).
The position and uses of these are described 1 Kings 7:23-39; [Ch2
4:6](../kjv/ch2004.htm#006). The "molten sea" was made of copper, taken
from Tibhath and Chun, cities of Hadarezer, king of Zobah ([Ch1
18:8](../kjv/ch1018.htm#008); [Kg1 7:23](../kjv/kg1007.htm#023)). No
lavers are mentioned in the second temple.
