<P><A NAME="000"><B>Satan</B></A>     Adversary; accuser. When used as a proper name, the Hebrew word so rendered has the article &quot;the adversary&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/job001.htm#006">Job 1:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/job002.htm#001">Job 2:1</A>). In the New Testament it is used as interchangeable with Diabolos, or the devil, and is so used more than thirty times. He is also called &quot;the dragon,&quot; &quot;the old serpent&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/rev012.htm#009">Rev 12:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rev020.htm#002">Rev 20:2</A>); &quot;the prince of this world&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/joh012.htm#031">Joh 12:31</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joh014.htm#030">Joh 14:30</A>); &quot;the prince of the power of the air&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/eph002.htm#002">Eph 2:2</A>); &quot;the god of this world&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/co2004.htm#004">Co2 4:4</A>); &quot;the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/eph002.htm#002">Eph 2:2</A>). The distinct personality of Satan and his activity among men are thus obviously recognized. He tempted our Lord in the wilderness (<A HREF="../kjv/mat004.htm#001">Mat 4:1</A>). He is &quot;Beelzebub, the prince of the devils&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/mat012.htm#024">Mat 12:24</A>). He is &quot;the constant enemy of God, of Christ, of the divine kingdom, of the followers of Christ, and of all truth; full of falsehood and all malice, and exciting and seducing to evil in every possible way.&quot; His power is very great in the world. He is a &quot;roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/pe1005.htm#008">Pe1 5:8</A>). Men are said to be &quot;taken captive by him&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/ti2002.htm#026">Ti2 2:26</A>). Christians are warned against his &quot;devices&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/co2002.htm#011">Co2 2:11</A>), and called on to &quot;resist&quot; him (<A HREF="../kjv/jam004.htm#007">Jam 4:7</A>). Christ redeems his people from &quot;him that had the power of death, that is, the devil&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/heb002.htm#014">Heb 2:14</A>). Satan has the &quot;power of death,&quot; not as lord, but simply as executioner. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Satyr</B></A>     Hairy one. Mentioned in Greek mythology as a creature composed of a man and a goat, supposed to inhabit wild and desolate regions. The Hebrew word is rendered also &quot;goat&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/lev004.htm#024">Lev 4:24</A>) and &quot;devil&quot;, i.e., an idol in the form of a goat (<A HREF="../kjv/lev017.htm#007">Lev 17:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2011.htm#015">Ch2 11:15</A>). When it is said (<A HREF="../kjv/isa013.htm#021">Isa 13:21</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/isa034.htm#014">Isa 34:14</A>) &quot;the satyrs shall dance there,&quot; the meaning is that the place referred to shall become a desolate waste. Some render the Hebrew word &quot;baboon,&quot; a species of which is found in Babylonia. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Saul</B></A>     Asked for.     (1.) A king of Edom (<A HREF="../kjv/gen036.htm#037">Gen 36:37</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen036.htm#038">Gen 36:38</A>); called Shaul in <A HREF="../kjv/ch1001.htm#048">Ch1 1:48</A>. (2.) The son of Kish (probably his only son, and a child of prayer, &quot;asked for&quot;), of the tribe of Benjamin, the first king of the Jewish nation. The singular providential circumstances connected with his election as king are recorded in 1 Sam. 8-10. His father's she-asses had strayed, and Saul was sent with a servant to seek for them. Leaving his home at Gibeah (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1010.htm#005">Sa1 10:5</A>, &quot;the hill of God,&quot; A.V.; lit., as in R.V. marg., &quot;Gibeah of God&quot;), Saul and his servant went toward the north-west over Mount Ephraim, and then turning north-east they came to &quot;the land of Shalisha,&quot; and thence eastward to the land of Shalim, and at length came to the district of Zuph, near Samuel's home at Ramah (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1009.htm#005">Sa1 9:5</A>). At this point Saul proposed to return from the three days' fruitless search, but his servant suggested that they should first consult the &quot;seer.&quot; Hearing that he was about to offer sacrifice, the two hastened into Ramah, and &quot;behold, Samuel came out against them,&quot; on his way to the &quot;bamah&quot;, i.e., the &quot;height&quot;, where sacrifice was to be offered; and in answer to Saul's question, &quot;Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is,&quot; Samuel made himself known to him. Samuel had been divinely prepared for his coming (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1009.htm#015">Sa1 9:15</A>), and received Saul as his guest. He took him with him to the sacrifice, and then after the feast &quot;communed with Saul upon the top of the house&quot; of all that was in his heart. On the morrow Samuel &quot;took a vial of oil and poured it on his head,&quot; and anointed Saul as king over Israel (1 Sam. 9:25 - 10:8), giving him three signs in confirmation of his call to be king. When Saul reached his home in Gibeah the last of these signs was fulfilled, and the Sprit of God came upon him, and &quot;he was turned into another man.&quot; The simple countryman was transformed into the king of Israel, a remarkable change suddenly took place in his whole demeanour, and the people said in their astonishment, as they looked on the stalwart son of Kish, &quot;Is Saul also among the prophets?&quot;, a saying which passed into a &quot;proverb.&quot; (Compare <A HREF="../kjv/sa1019.htm#024">Sa1 19:24</A>.) The intercourse between Saul and Samuel was as yet unknown to the people. The &quot;anointing&quot; had been in secret. But now the time had come when the transaction must be confirmed by the nation. Samuel accordingly summoned the people to a solemn assembly &quot;before the Lord&quot; at Mizpeh. Here the lot was drawn (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1010.htm#017">Sa1 10:17</A>), and it fell upon Saul, and when he was presented before them, the stateliest man in all Israel, the air was rent for the first time in Israel by the loud cry, &quot;God save the king!&quot; He now returned to his home in Gibeah, attended by a king of bodyguard, &quot;a band of men whose hearts God had touched.&quot; On reaching his home he dismissed them, and resumed the quiet toils of his former life. Soon after this, on hearing of the conduct of Nahash the Ammonite at Jabesh-Gilead (q.v.), an army out of all the tribes of Israel rallied at his summons to the trysting-place at Bezek, and he led them forth a great army to battle, gaining a complete victory over the Ammonite invaders at Jabesh (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1011.htm#001">Sa1 11:1</A>). Amid the universal joy occasioned by this victory he was now fully recognized as the king of Israel. At the invitation of Samuel &quot;all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal.&quot; Samuel now officially anointed him as king (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1011.htm#015">Sa1 11:15</A>). Although Samuel never ceased to be a judge in Israel, yet now his work in that capacity practically came to an end. Saul now undertook the great and difficult enterprise of freeing the land from its hereditary enemies the Philistines, and for this end he gathered together an army of 3,000 men (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1013.htm#001">Sa1 13:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1013.htm#002">Sa1 13:2</A>). The Philistines were encamped at Geba. Saul, with 2,000 men, occupied Michmash and Mount Bethel; while his son Jonathan, with 1,000 men, occupied Gibeah, to the south of Geba, and seemingly without any direction from his father &quot;smote&quot; the Philistines in Geba. Thus roused, the Philistines, who gathered an army of 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and &quot;people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude,&quot; encamped in Michmash, which Saul had evacuated for Gilgal. Saul now tarried for seven days in Gilgal before making any movement, as Samuel had appointed (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1010.htm#008">Sa1 10:8</A>); but becoming impatient on the seventh day, as it was drawing to a close, when he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared and warned him of the fatal consequences of his act of disobedience, for he had not waited long enough (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1013.htm#013">Sa1 13:13</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1013.htm#014">Sa1 13:14</A>). When Saul, after Samuel's departure, went out from Gilgal with his 600 men, his followers having decreased to that number (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1013.htm#015">Sa1 13:15</A>), against the Philistines at Michmash (q.v.), he had his head-quarters under a pomegranate tree at Migron, over against Michmash, the Wady es Suweinit alone intervening. Here at Gibeah-Geba Saul and his army rested, uncertain what to do. Jonathan became impatient, and with his armour-bearer planned an assault against the Philistines, unknown to Saul and the army (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1014.htm#001">Sa1 14:1</A>). Jonathan and his armour-bearer went down into the wady, and on their hands and knees climbed to the top of the narrow rocky ridge called Bozez, where was the outpost of the Philistine army. They surprised and then slew twenty of the Philistines, and immediately the whole host of the Philistines was thrown into disorder and fled in great terror. &quot;It was a very great trembling;&quot; a supernatural panic seized the host. Saul and his 600 men, a band which speedily increased to 10,000, perceiving the confusion, pursued the army of the Philistines, and the tide of battle rolled on as far as to Bethaven, halfway between Michmash and Bethel. The Philistines were totally routed. &quot;So the Lord saved Israel that day.&quot; While pursuing the Philistines, Saul rashly adjured the people, saying, &quot;Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening.&quot; But though faint and weary, the Israelites &quot;smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon&quot; (a distance of from 15 to 20 miles). Jonathan had, while passing through the wood in pursuit of the Philistines, tasted a little of the honeycomb which was abundant there (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1014.htm#027">Sa1 14:27</A>). This was afterwards discovered by Saul (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1014.htm#042">Sa1 14:42</A>), and he threatened to put his son to death. The people, however, interposed, saying, &quot;There shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground.&quot; He whom God had so signally owned, who had &quot;wrought this great salvation in Israel,&quot; must not die. &quot;Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place&quot; (1 Sam. 14:24-46); and thus the campaign against the Philistines came to an end. This was Saul's second great military success. Saul's reign, however, continued to be one of almost constant war against his enemies round about (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1014.htm#047">Sa1 14:47</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1014.htm#048">Sa1 14:48</A>), in all of which he proved victorious. The war against the Amalekites is the only one which is recorded at length (1 Sam. 15). These oldest and hereditary (<A HREF="../kjv/exo017.htm#008">Exo 17:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num014.htm#043">Num 14:43</A>) enemies of Israel occupied the territory to the south and south-west of Palestine. Samuel summoned Saul to execute the &quot;ban&quot; which God had pronounced (<A HREF="../kjv/deu025.htm#017">Deu 25:17</A>) on this cruel and relentless foe of Israel. The cup of their iniquity was now full. This command was &quot;the test of his moral qualification for being king.&quot; Saul proceeded to execute the divine command; and gathering the people together, marched from Telaim (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1015.htm#004">Sa1 15:4</A>) against the Amalekites, whom he smote &quot;from Havilah until thou comest to Shur,&quot; utterly destroying &quot;all the people with the edge of the sword&quot;, i.e., all that fell into his hands. He was, however, guilty of rebellion and disobedience in sparing Agag their king, and in conniving at his soldiers' sparing the best of the sheep and cattle; and Samuel, following Saul to Gilgal, in the Jordan valley, said unto him, &quot;Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he also hath rejected thee from being king&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1015.htm#023">Sa1 15:23</A>). The kingdom was rent from Saul and was given to another, even to David, whom the Lord chose to be Saul's successor, and whom Samuel anointed (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1016.htm#001">Sa1 16:1</A>). From that day &quot;the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.&quot; He and Samuel parted only to meet once again at one of the schools of the prophets. David was now sent for as a &quot;cunning player on an harp&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1016.htm#016">Sa1 16:16</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1016.htm#018">Sa1 16:18</A>), to play before Saul when the evil spirit troubled him, and thus was introduced to the court of Saul. He became a great favourite with the king. At length David returned to his father's house and to his wonted avocation as a shepherd for perhaps some three years. The Philistines once more invaded the land, and gathered their army between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim, on the southern slope of the valley of Elah. Saul and the men of Israel went forth to meet them, and encamped on the northern slope of the same valley which lay between the two armies. It was here that David slew Goliath of Gath, the champion of the Philistines (1 Sam. 17:4-54), an exploit which led to the flight and utter defeat of the Philistine army. Saul now took David permanently into his service (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1018.htm#002">Sa1 18:2</A>); but he became jealous of him (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1018.htm#009">Sa1 18:9</A>), and on many occasions showed his enmity toward him (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1018.htm#010">Sa1 18:10</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1018.htm#011">Sa1 18:11</A>), his enmity ripening into a purpose of murder which at different times he tried in vain to carry out. After some time the Philistines &quot;gathered themselves together&quot; in the plain of Esdraelon, and pitched their camp at Shunem, on the slope of Little Hermon; and Saul &quot;gathered all Israel together,&quot; and &quot;pitched in Gilboa&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1028.htm#003">Sa1 28:3</A>). Being unable to discover the mind of the Lord, Saul, accompanied by two of his retinue, betook himself to the &quot;witch of Endor,&quot; some 7 or 8 miles distant. Here he was overwhelmed by the startling communication that was mysteriously made to him by Samuel (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1028.htm#016">Sa1 28:16</A>), who appeared to him. &quot;He fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1028.htm#020">Sa1 28:20</A>). The Philistine host &quot;fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1031.htm#001">Sa1 31:1</A>). In his despair at the disaster that had befallen his army, Saul &quot;took a sword and fell upon it.&quot; And the Philistines on the morrow &quot;found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount Gilboa.&quot; Having cut off his head, they sent it with his weapons to Philistia, and hung up the skull in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod. They suspended his headless body, with that of Jonathan, from the walls of Bethshan. The men of Jabesh-gilead afterwards removed the bodies from this position; and having burnt the flesh, they buried the bodies under a tree at Jabesh. The remains were, however, afterwards removed to the family sepulchre at Zelah (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2021.htm#013">Sa2 21:13</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa2021.htm#014">Sa2 21:14</A>). (See DAVID.) (3.) &quot;Who is also called Paul&quot; (q.v.), the circumcision name of the apostle, given to him, perhaps, in memory of King Saul (<A HREF="../kjv/act007.htm#058">Act 7:58</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/act008.htm#001">Act 8:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/act009.htm#001">Act 9:1</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Saviour</B></A>     One who saves from any form or degree of evil. In its highest sense the word indicates the relation sustained by our Lord to his redeemed ones, he is their Saviour. The great message of the gospel is about salvation and the Saviour. It is the &quot;gospel of salvation.&quot; Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ secures to the sinner a personal interest in the work of redemption. Salvation is redemption made effectual to the individual by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Scapegoat</B></A>     Lev. 16:8-26; R.V., &quot;the goat for Azazel&quot; (q.v.), the name given to the goat which was taken away into the wilderness on the day of Atonement (<A HREF="../kjv/lev016.htm#020">Lev 16:20</A>). The priest made atonement over the scapegoat, laying Israel's guilt upon it, and then sent it away, the goat bearing &quot;upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited.&quot; At a later period an evasion or modification of the law of Moses was introduced by the Jews. &quot;The goat was conducted to a mountain named Tzuk, situated at a distance of ten Sabbath days' journey, or about six and a half English miles, from Jerusalem. At this place the Judean desert was supposed to commence; and the man in whose charge the goat was sent out, while setting him free, was instructed to push the unhappy beast down the slope of the mountain side, which was so steep as to insure the death of the goat, whose bones were broken by the fall. The reason of this barbarous custom was that on one occasion the scapegoat returned to Jerusalem after being set free, which was considered such an evil omen that its recurrence was prevented for the future by the death of the goat&quot; (Twenty-one Years' Work in the Holy Land). This mountain is now called el-Muntar.

<P><A NAME="005"><B>Scarlet</B></A>     This dye was obtained by the Egyptians from the shell-fish Carthamus tinctorius; and by the Hebrews from the Coccus ilicis, an insect which infests oak trees, called kermes by the Arabians. This colour was early known (<A HREF="../kjv/gen038.htm#028">Gen 38:28</A>). It was one of the colours of the ephod (<A HREF="../kjv/exo028.htm#006">Exo 28:6</A>), the girdle (<A HREF="../kjv/exo028.htm#008">Exo 28:8</A>), and the breastplate (<A HREF="../kjv/exo028.htm#015">Exo 28:15</A>) of the high priest. It is also mentioned in various other connections (<A HREF="../kjv/jos002.htm#018">Jos 2:18</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa2001.htm#024">Sa2 1:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lam004.htm#005">Lam 4:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/nah002.htm#003">Nah 2:3</A>). A scarlet robe was in mockery placed on our Lord (<A HREF="../kjv/mat027.htm#028">Mat 27:28</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk023.htm#011">Luk 23:11</A>). &quot;Sins as scarlet&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/isa001.htm#018">Isa 1:18</A>), i.e., as scarlet robes &quot;glaring and habitual.&quot; Scarlet and crimson were the firmest of dyes, and thus not easily washed out. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Sceptre</B></A>     (Heb.  shebet  = Gr.  skeptron ), properly a staff or rod. As a symbol of authority, the use of the sceptre originated in the idea that the ruler was as a shepherd of his people (<A HREF="../kjv/gen049.htm#010">Gen 49:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num024.htm#017">Num 24:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa045.htm#006">Psa 45:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa014.htm#005">Isa 14:5</A>). There is no example on record of a sceptre having ever been actually handled by a Jewish king. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Sceva</B></A>     An implement, a Jew, chief of the priests at Ephesus (<A HREF="../kjv/act019.htm#013">Act 19:13</A>); i.e., the head of one of the twenty-four courses of the house of Levi. He had seven sons, who &quot;took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus,&quot; in imitation of Paul. They tried their method of exorcism on a fierce demoniac, and failed. His answer to them was to this effect (<A HREF="../kjv/act019.htm#015">Act 19:15</A>): &quot;The Jesus whom you invoke is One whose authority I acknowledge; and the Paul whom you name I recognize to be a servant or messenger of God; but what sort of men are ye who have been empowered to act as you do by neither?&quot; (Lindsay on the Acts of the Apostles.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Schism</B></A>     A separation, an alienation causing divisions among Christians, who ought to be united (<A HREF="../kjv/co1012.htm#025">Co1 12:25</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Schoolmaster</B></A>     The law so designated by Paul (<A HREF="../kjv/gal003.htm#024">Gal 3:24</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gal003.htm#025">Gal 3:25</A>). As so used, the word does not mean teacher, but pedagogue (shortened into the modern page), i.e., one who was entrusted with the supervision of a family, taking them to and from the school, being responsible for their safety and manners. Hence the pedagogue was stern and severe in his discipline. Thus the law was a pedagogue to the Jews, with a view to Christ, i.e., to prepare for faith in Christ by producing convictions of guilt and helplessness. The office of the pedagogue ceased when &quot;faith came&quot;, i.e., the object of that faith, the seed, which is Christ.
