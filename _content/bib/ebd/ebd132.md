<span id="000">**Feast**</span> As a mark of hospitality ([Gen
19:3](../kjv/gen019.htm#003); [Sa2 3:20](../kjv/sa2003.htm#020); [Kg2
6:23](../kjv/kg2006.htm#023)); on occasions of domestic joy ([Luk
15:23](../kjv/luk015.htm#023); [Gen 21:8](../kjv/gen021.htm#008)); on
birthdays ([Gen 40:20](../kjv/gen040.htm#020); [Job
1:4](../kjv/job001.htm#004); [Mat 14:6](../kjv/mat014.htm#006)); and on
the occasion of a marriage ([Jdg 14:10](../kjv/jdg014.htm#010); [Gen
29:22](../kjv/gen029.htm#022)). Feasting was a part of the observances
connected with the offering up of sacrifices ([Deu
12:6](../kjv/deu012.htm#006), [Deu 12:7](../kjv/deu012.htm#007); [Sa1
9:19](../kjv/sa1009.htm#019); [Sa1 16:3](../kjv/sa1016.htm#003), [Sa1
16:5](../kjv/sa1016.htm#005)), and with the annual festivals ([Deu
16:11](../kjv/deu016.htm#011)). "It was one of the designs of the
greater solemnities, which required the attendance of the people at the
sacred tent, that the oneness of the nation might be maintained and
cemented together, by stately congregating in one place, and with one
soul taking part in the same religious services. But that oneness was
primarily and chiefly a religious and not merely a political one; the
people were not merely to meet as among themselves, but with Jehovah,
and to present themselves before him as one body; the meeting was in its
own nature a binding of themselves in fellowship with Jehovah; so that
it was not politics and commerce that had here to do, but the soul of
the Mosaic dispensation, the foundation of the religious and political
existence of Israel, the covenant with Jehovah. To keep the people's
consciousness alive to this, to revive, strengthen, and perpetuate it,
nothing could be so well adapted as these annual feasts." (See
FESTIVALS.)

<span id="001">**Felix**</span> Happy, the Roman Procurator of Judea
before whom Paul "reasoned" ([Act 24:25](../kjv/act024.htm#025)). He
appears to have expected a bribe from Paul, and therefore had several
interviews with him. The "worthy deeds" referred to in [Act
24:2](../kjv/act024.htm#002) was his clearing the country of bandits and
impostors. At the end of a two years' term, Porcius Festus was appointed
in the room of Felix (A.D. 60), who proceeded to Rome, and was there
accused of cruelty and malversation of office by the Jews of Caesarea.
The accusation was rendered nugatory by the influence of his brother
Pallas with Nero. (See Josephus, Ant. xx. 8, 9.) Drusilla, the daughter
of Herod Agrippa, having been induced by Felix to desert her husband,
the king of Emesa, became his adulterous companion. She was seated
beside him when Paul "reasoned" before the judge. When Felix gave place
to Festus, being "willing to do the Jews a pleasure," he left Paul
bound.

<span id="002">**Fellowship**</span> (1.) With God, consisting in the
knowledge of his will ([Job 22:21](../kjv/job022.htm#021); [Joh
17:3](../kjv/joh017.htm#003)); agreement with his designs ([Amo
3:2](../kjv/amo003.htm#002)); mutual affection ([Rom
8:38](../kjv/rom008.htm#038), [Rom 8:39](../kjv/rom008.htm#039));
enjoyment of his presence ([Psa 4:6](../kjv/psa004.htm#006)); conformity
to his image ([Jo1 2:6](../kjv/jo1002.htm#006); [Jo1
1:6](../kjv/jo1001.htm#006)); and participation of his felicity ([Jo1
1:3](../kjv/jo1001.htm#003), [Jo1 1:4](../kjv/jo1001.htm#004); [Eph
3:14](../kjv/eph003.htm#014)). (2.) Of saints with one another, in
duties ([Rom 12:5](../kjv/rom012.htm#005); [Co1
12:1](../kjv/co1012.htm#001); [Th1 5:17](../kjv/th1005.htm#017), [Th1
5:18](../kjv/th1005.htm#018)); in ordinances ([Heb
10:25](../kjv/heb010.htm#025); [Act 2:46](../kjv/act002.htm#046)); in
grace, love, joy, etc. ([Mal 3:16](../kjv/mal003.htm#016); [Co2
8:4](../kjv/co2008.htm#004)); mutual interest, spiritual and temporal
([Rom 12:4](../kjv/rom012.htm#004), [Rom 12:13](../kjv/rom012.htm#013);
[Heb 13:16](../kjv/heb013.htm#016)); in sufferings ([Rom
15:1](../kjv/rom015.htm#001), [Rom 15:2](../kjv/rom015.htm#002); [Gal
6:1](../kjv/gal006.htm#001), [Gal 6:2](../kjv/gal006.htm#002); [Rom
12:15](../kjv/rom012.htm#015); and in glory ([Rev
7:9](../kjv/rev007.htm#009)).

<span id="003">**Fence**</span> (Heb. gader ), [Num
22:24](../kjv/num022.htm#024) (R.V.). Fences were constructions of
un-mortared stones, to protect gardens, vineyards, sheepfolds, etc. From
various causes they were apt to bulge out and fall ([Psa
62:3](../kjv/psa062.htm#003)). In [Psa 80:12](../kjv/psa080.htm#012),
R.V. (see [Isa 5:5](../kjv/isa005.htm#005)), the psalmist says, "Why
hast thou broken down her fences?" Serpents delight to lurk in the
crevices of such fences ([Ecc 10:8](../kjv/ecc010.htm#008); compare [Amo
5:19](../kjv/amo005.htm#019)).

<span id="004">**Fenced Cities**</span> There were in Palestine (1.)
cities, (2.) unwalled villages, and (3.) villages with castles or towers
([Ch1 27:25](../kjv/ch1027.htm#025)). Cities, so called, had walls, and
were thus fenced. The fortifications consisted of one or two walls, on
which were towers or parapets at regular intervals ([Ch2
32:5](../kjv/ch2032.htm#005); [Jer 31:38](../kjv/jer031.htm#038)).
Around ancient Jerusalem were three walls, on one of which were ninety
towers, on the second fourteen, and on the third sixty. The tower of
Hananeel, near the north-east corner of the city wall, is frequently
referred to ([Neh 3:1](../kjv/neh003.htm#001); [Neh
12:39](../kjv/neh012.htm#039); [Zac 14:10](../kjv/zac014.htm#010)). The
gateways of such cities were also fortified ([Neh
2:8](../kjv/neh002.htm#008); [Neh 3:3](../kjv/neh003.htm#003), [Neh
3:6](../kjv/neh003.htm#006); [Jdg 16:2](../kjv/jdg016.htm#002), [Jdg
16:3](../kjv/jdg016.htm#003); [Sa1 23:7](../kjv/sa1023.htm#007)). The
Hebrews found many fenced cities when they entered the Promised Land
([Num 13:28](../kjv/num013.htm#028); [Num 32:17](../kjv/num032.htm#017),
[Num 32:34](../kjv/num032.htm#034); [Jos 11:12](../kjv/jos011.htm#012),
[Jos 11:13](../kjv/jos011.htm#013); [Jdg 1:27](../kjv/jdg001.htm#027)),
and we may estimate the strength of some of these cities from the fact
that they were long held in possession by the Canaanites. The Jebusites,
e.g., were enabled to hold possession of Jerusalem till the time of
David ([Sa2 5:6](../kjv/sa2005.htm#006), [Sa2
5:7](../kjv/sa2005.htm#007); [Ch1 11:5](../kjv/ch1011.htm#005)). Several
of the kings of Israel and Judah distinguished themselves as fortifiers
or "builders" of cities.

<span id="005">**Ferret**</span> [Lev 11:30](../kjv/lev011.htm#030)
(R.V., "gecko"), one of the unclean creeping things. It was perhaps the
Lacerta gecko which was intended by the Hebrew word (anakah, a cry,
"mourning," the creature which groans) here used, i.e., the "fan-footed"
lizard, the gecko which makes a mournful wail. The LXX. translate it by
a word meaning "shrew-mouse," of which there are three species in
Palestine. The Rabbinical writers regard it as the hedgehog. The
translation of the Revised Version is to be preferred.

<span id="006">**Ferry Boat**</span> ([Sa2
19:18](../kjv/sa2019.htm#018)), some kind of boat for crossing the river
which the men of Judah placed at the service of the king. Floats or
rafts for this purpose were in use from remote times ([Isa
18:2](../kjv/isa018.htm#002)).

<span id="007">**Festivals, Religious**</span> There were daily (Lev.
23), weekly, monthly, and yearly festivals, and great stress was laid on
the regular observance of them in every particular ([Num
28:1](../kjv/num028.htm#001); [Exo 29:38](../kjv/exo029.htm#038); Lev.
6:8-23; [Exo 30:7](../kjv/exo030.htm#007); [Exo
27:20](../kjv/exo027.htm#020)). (1.) The septenary festivals were, (a)
The weekly Sabbath ([Lev 23:1](../kjv/lev023.htm#001); Ex. 19:3 - 30;
[Exo 20:8](../kjv/exo020.htm#008); [Exo 31:12](../kjv/exo031.htm#012),
etc.). (b) The seventh new moon, or the feast of Trumpets ([Num
28:11](../kjv/num028.htm#011); [Num 29:1](../kjv/num029.htm#001)). (c)
The Sabbatical year ([Exo 23:10](../kjv/exo023.htm#010), [Exo
23:11](../kjv/exo023.htm#011); [Lev 25:2](../kjv/lev025.htm#002)). (d)
The year of jubilee ([Lev 23:35](../kjv/lev023.htm#035); [Lev
25:8](../kjv/lev025.htm#008); [Lev 27:16](../kjv/lev027.htm#016)). (2.)
The great feasts were, (a.) The Passover. (b) The feast of Pentecost, or
of weeks. (c.) The feast of Tabernacles, or of ingathering. On each of
these occasions every male Israelite was commanded "to appear before the
Lord" ([Deu 27:7](../kjv/deu027.htm#007); [Neh
8:9](../kjv/neh008.htm#009)). The attendance of women was voluntary.
(Compare [Luk 2:41](../kjv/luk002.htm#041); [Sa1
1:7](../kjv/sa1001.htm#007); [Sa1 2:19](../kjv/sa1002.htm#019).) The
promise that God would protect their homes ([Exo
34:23](../kjv/exo034.htm#023), [Exo 34:24](../kjv/exo034.htm#024)) while
all the males were absent in Jerusalem at these feasts was always
fulfilled. "During the whole period between Moses and Christ we never
read of an enemy invading the land at the time of the three festivals.
The first instance on record is thirty-three years after they had
withdrawn from themselves the divine protection by imbruing their hands
in the Saviour's blood, when Cestius, the Roman general, slew fifty of
the people of Lydda while all the rest had gone up to the feast of
Tabernacles, A.D. 66." These festivals, besides their religious purpose,
had an important bearing on the maintenance among the people of the
feeling of a national unity. The times fixed for their observance were
arranged so as to interfere as little as possible with the industry of
the people. The Passover was kept just before the harvest commenced,
Pentecost at the conclusion of the corn harvest and before the vintage,
the feast of Tabernacles after all the fruits of the ground had been
gathered in. (3.) The Day of Atonement, the tenth day of the seventh
month ([Lev 16:1](../kjv/lev016.htm#001), [Lev
16:34](../kjv/lev016.htm#034); [Lev 23:26](../kjv/lev023.htm#026); [Num
29:7](../kjv/num029.htm#007)). (See ATONEMENT, DAY OF.) Of the
post-Exilian festivals reference is made to the feast of Dedication
([Joh 10:22](../kjv/joh010.htm#022)). This feast was appointed by Judas
Maccabaeus in commemoration of the purification of the temple after it
had been polluted by Antiochus Epiphanes. The "feast of Purim" (q.v.),
[Est 9:24](../kjv/est009.htm#024), was also instituted after the Exile.
(Cf. [Joh 5:1](../kjv/joh005.htm#001).)

<span id="008">**Festus, Porcius**</span> The successor of Felix (A.D.
60) as Procurator of Judea ([Act 24:27](../kjv/act024.htm#027)). A few
weeks after he had entered on his office the case of Paul, then a
prisoner at Caesarea, was reported to him. The "next day," after he had
gone down to Caesarea, he heard Paul defend himself in the presence of
Herod Agrippa II. and his sister Bernice, and not finding in him
anything worthy of death or of bonds, would have set him free had he not
appealed unto Caesar ([Act 25:11](../kjv/act025.htm#011), [Act
25:12](../kjv/act025.htm#012)). In consequence of this appeal Paul was
sent to Rome. Festus, after being in office less than two years, died in
Judea. (See AGRIPPA.)

<span id="009">**Fever**</span> ([Deu 28:22](../kjv/deu028.htm#022);
[Mat 8:14](../kjv/mat008.htm#014); [Mar 1:30](../kjv/mar001.htm#030);
[Joh 4:52](../kjv/joh004.htm#052); [Act 28:8](../kjv/act028.htm#008)), a
burning heat, as the word so rendered denotes, which attends all febrile
attacks. In all Eastern countries such diseases are very common. Peter's
wife's mother is said to have suffered from a "great fever" ([Luk
4:38](../kjv/luk004.htm#038)), an instance of Luke's professional
exactitude in describing disease. He adopts here the technical medical
distinction, as in those times fevers were divided into the "great" and
the "less."
