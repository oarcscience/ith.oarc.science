<span id="000">**Adamah**</span> Red earth, a fortified city of
Naphtali, probably the modern Damieh, on the west side of the sea of
Tiberias ([Jos 19:33](../kjv/jos019.htm#033), [Jos
19:36](../kjv/jos019.htm#036)).

<span id="001">**Adamant**</span> (Heb. shamir ), [Eze
3:9](../kjv/eze003.htm#009). The Greek word adamas means diamond. This
stone is not referred to, but corundum or some kind of hard steel. It is
an emblem of firmness in resisting adversaries of the truth ([Zac
7:12](../kjv/zac007.htm#012)), and of hardheartedness against the truth
([Jer 17:1](../kjv/jer017.htm#001)).

<span id="002">**Adar**</span> Large, the sixth month of the civil and
the twelfth of the ecclesiastical year of the Jews ([Est
3:7](../kjv/est003.htm#007), [Est 3:13](../kjv/est003.htm#013); [Est
8:12](../kjv/est008.htm#012); [Est 9:1](../kjv/est009.htm#001), [Est
9:15](../kjv/est009.htm#015), [Est 9:17](../kjv/est009.htm#017), [Est
9:19](../kjv/est009.htm#019), [Est 9:21](../kjv/est009.htm#021)). It
included the days extending from the new moon of our March to the new
moon of April. The name was first used after the Captivity. When the
season was backward, and the lambs not yet of a paschal size, or the
barley not forward enough for abib, then a month called Veadar, i.e., a
second Adar, was intercalated.

<span id="003">**Adbeel**</span> Miracle of God, the third of the twelve
sons of Ishmael, and head of an Arabian tribe ([Gen
25:13](../kjv/gen025.htm#013); [Ch1 1:29](../kjv/ch1001.htm#029)).

<span id="004">**Addar**</span> Ample, splendid, son of Bela ([Ch1
8:3](../kjv/ch1008.htm#003)); called also "Ard" ([Gen
46:21](../kjv/gen046.htm#021))

<span id="005">**Adder**</span> ([Psa 140:3](../kjv/psa140.htm#003);
[Rom 3:13](../kjv/rom003.htm#013), "asp") is the rendering of (1.)
Akshub ("coiling" or "lying in wait"), properly an asp or viper, found
only in this passage. (2.) Pethen ("twisting"), a viper or venomous
serpent identified with the cobra (Naja haje) ([Psa
58:4](../kjv/psa058.htm#004); [Psa 91:13](../kjv/psa091.htm#013));
elsewhere "asp." (3.) Taiphoni ("hissing") ([Pro
23:32](../kjv/pro023.htm#032)); elsewhere rendered "cockatrice," [Isa
11:8](../kjv/isa011.htm#008); [Isa 14:29](../kjv/isa014.htm#029); [Isa
59:5](../kjv/isa059.htm#005); [Jer 8:17](../kjv/jer008.htm#017), as it
is here in the margin of the Authorized Version. The Revised Version has
"basilisk." This may have been the yellow viper, the Daboia xanthina,
the largest and most dangerous of the vipers of Palestine. (4.)
Shephiphon ("creeping"), occurring only in [Gen
49:17](../kjv/gen049.htm#017), the small speckled venomous snake, the
"horned snake," or cerastes. Dan is compared to this serpent, which
springs from its hiding-place on the passer-by.

<span id="006">**Addi**</span> Ornament, ([Luk
3:28](../kjv/luk003.htm#028)), the son of Cosam, and father of Melchi,
one of the progenitors of Christ.

<span id="007">**Addon**</span> Low, one of the persons named in [Neh
7:61](../kjv/neh007.htm#061) who could not "shew their father's house"
on the return from captivity. This, with similar instances ([Neh
7:63](../kjv/neh007.htm#063)), indicates the importance the Jews
attached to their genealogies.

<span id="008">**Adiel**</span> Ornament of God. (1.) The father of
Azmaveth, who was treasurer under David and Solomon ([Ch1
27:25](../kjv/ch1027.htm#025)). (2.) A family head of the tribe of
Simeon ([Ch1 4:36](../kjv/ch1004.htm#036)). (3.) A priest ([Ch1
9:12](../kjv/ch1009.htm#012)).

<span id="009">**Adin**</span> Effeminate. (1.) [Ezr
8:6](../kjv/ezr008.htm#006). (2.) [Neh 10:16](../kjv/neh010.htm#016).
