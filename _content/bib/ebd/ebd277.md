<span id="000">**Offense**</span> (1.) An injury or wrong done to one
([Sa1 25:31](../kjv/sa1025.htm#031); [Rom 5:15](../kjv/rom005.htm#015)).
(2.) A stumbling-block or cause of temptation ([Isa
8:14](../kjv/isa008.htm#014); [Mat 16:23](../kjv/mat016.htm#023); [Mat
18:7](../kjv/mat018.htm#007)). Greek skandalon , properly that at which
one stumbles or takes offense. The "offense of the cross" ([Gal
5:11](../kjv/gal005.htm#011)) is the offense the Jews took at the
teaching that salvation was by the crucified One, and by him alone.
Salvation by the cross was a stumbling-block to their national pride.

<span id="001">**Offering**</span> An oblation, dedicated to God. Thus
Cain consecrated to God of the firstfruits of the earth, and Abel of the
firstlings of the flock ([Gen 4:3](../kjv/gen004.htm#003), [Gen
4:4](../kjv/gen004.htm#004)). Under the Levitical system different kinds
of offerings are specified, and laws laid down as to their presentation.
These are described under their distinctive names.

<span id="002">**Og**</span> Gigantic, the king of Bashan, who was
defeated by Moses in a pitched battle at Edrei, and was slain along with
his sons ([Deu 1:4](../kjv/deu001.htm#004)), and whose kingdom was given
to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh ([Num
21:32](../kjv/num021.htm#032); [Deu 3:1](../kjv/deu003.htm#001)). His
bedstead (or rather sarcophagus) was of iron (or ironstone), 9 cubits in
length and 4 cubits in breadth. His overthrow was afterwards celebrated
in song ([Psa 135:11](../kjv/psa135.htm#011); [Psa
136:20](../kjv/psa136.htm#020)). (See SIHON.)

<span id="003">**Ohad**</span> United, or power, the third son of Simeon
([Gen 46:10](../kjv/gen046.htm#010)).

<span id="004">**Ohel**</span> A house; tent, the fourth son of
Zerubbabel ([Ch1 3:20](../kjv/ch1003.htm#020)).

<span id="005">**Oil**</span> Only olive oil seems to have been used
among the Hebrews. It was used for many purposes: for anointing the body
or the hair ([Exo 29:7](../kjv/exo029.htm#007); [Sa2
14:2](../kjv/sa2014.htm#002); [Psa 23:5](../kjv/psa023.htm#005); [Psa
92:10](../kjv/psa092.htm#010); [Psa 104:15](../kjv/psa104.htm#015); [Luk
7:46](../kjv/luk007.htm#046)); in some of the offerings ([Exo
29:40](../kjv/exo029.htm#040); [Lev 7:12](../kjv/lev007.htm#012); [Num
6:15](../kjv/num006.htm#015); [Num 15:4](../kjv/num015.htm#004)), but
was excluded from the sin-offering ([Lev 5:11](../kjv/lev005.htm#011))
and the jealousy-offering ([Num 5:15](../kjv/num005.htm#015)); for
burning in lamps ([Exo 25:6](../kjv/exo025.htm#006); [Exo
27:20](../kjv/exo027.htm#020); [Mat 25:3](../kjv/mat025.htm#003)); for
medicinal purposes ([Isa 1:6](../kjv/isa001.htm#006); [Luk
10:34](../kjv/luk010.htm#034); [Jam 5:14](../kjv/jam005.htm#014)); and
for anointing the dead ([Mat 26:12](../kjv/mat026.htm#012); [Luk
23:56](../kjv/luk023.htm#056)). It was one of the most valuable products
of the country ([Deu 32:13](../kjv/deu032.htm#013); [Eze
16:13](../kjv/eze016.htm#013)), and formed an article of extensive
commerce with Tyre ([Eze 27:17](../kjv/eze027.htm#017)). The use of it
was a sign of gladness ([Psa 92:10](../kjv/psa092.htm#010); [Isa
61:3](../kjv/isa061.htm#003)), and its omission a token of sorrow ([Sa2
14:2](../kjv/sa2014.htm#002); [Mat 6:17](../kjv/mat006.htm#017)). It was
very abundant in Galilee. (See OLIVE.)

<span id="006">**Oil-tree**</span> ([Isa 41:19](../kjv/isa041.htm#019);
R.V. marg., "oleaster"), Heb. 'etz shemen , rendered "olive tree" in
[Kg1 6:23](../kjv/kg1006.htm#023), [Kg1 6:31](../kjv/kg1006.htm#031),
[Kg1 6:32](../kjv/kg1006.htm#032), [Kg1 6:33](../kjv/kg1006.htm#033)
(R.V., "olive wood") and "pine branches" in [Neh
8:15](../kjv/neh008.htm#015) (R.V., "branches of wild olive"), was some
tree distinct from the olive. It was probably the oleaster (Eleagnus
angustifolius), which grows abundantly in almost all parts of Palestine,
especially about Hebron and Samaria. "It has a fine hard wood," says
Tristram, "and yields an inferior oil, but it has no relationship to the
olive, which, however, it resembles in general appearance."

<span id="007">**Ointment**</span> Various fragrant preparations, also
compounds for medical purposes, are so called ([Exo
30:25](../kjv/exo030.htm#025); [Psa 133:2](../kjv/psa133.htm#002); [Isa
1:6](../kjv/isa001.htm#006); [Amo 6:6](../kjv/amo006.htm#006); [Joh
12:3](../kjv/joh012.htm#003); [Rev 18:13](../kjv/rev018.htm#013)).

<span id="008">**Old Gate**</span> One of the gates in the north wall of
Jerusalem, so called because built by the Jebusites ([Neh
3:6](../kjv/neh003.htm#006); [Neh 12:39](../kjv/neh012.htm#039)).

<span id="009">**Olive**</span> The fruit of the olive-tree. This tree
yielded oil which was highly valued. The best oil was from olives that
were plucked before being fully ripe, and then beaten or squeezed ([Deu
24:20](../kjv/deu024.htm#020); [Isa 17:6](../kjv/isa017.htm#006); [Isa
24:13](../kjv/isa024.htm#013)). It was called "beaten," or "fresh oil"
([Exo 27:20](../kjv/exo027.htm#020)). There were also oil-presses, in
which the oil was trodden out by the feet ([Mic
6:15](../kjv/mic006.htm#015)). James ([Jam 3:12](../kjv/jam003.htm#012))
calls the fruit "olive berries." The phrase "vineyards and olives" ([Jdg
15:5](../kjv/jdg015.htm#005), A.V.) should be simply "olive-yard," or
"olive-garden," as in the Revised Version. (See OIL.)
