<P><A NAME="000"><B>Neziah</B></A>     Victory; pure, <A HREF="../kjv/ezr002.htm#054">Ezr 2:54</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh007.htm#056">Neh 7:56</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Nezib</B></A>     A town in the &quot;plain&quot; of Judah. It has been identified with Beit Nuzib, about 14 miles south-west of Jerusalem, in the Wady Sur (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#043">Jos 15:43</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Nibhaz</B></A>     Barker, the name of an idol, supposed to be an evil demon of the Zabians. It was set up in Samaria by the Avites (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2017.htm#031">Kg2 17:31</A>), probably in the form of a dog. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Nibshan</B></A>     Fertile; light soil, a city somewhere &quot;in the wilderness&quot; of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#062">Jos 15:62</A>), probably near Engedi. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Nicanor</B></A>     Conqueror, one of the seven deacons appointed in the apostolic Church (<A HREF="../kjv/act006.htm#001">Act 6:1</A>). Nothing further is known of him. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Nicodemus</B></A>     The people is victor, a Pharisee and a member of the Sanhedrin. He is first noticed as visiting Jesus by night (John 3:1-21) for the purpose of learning more of his doctrines, which our Lord then unfolded to him, giving prominence to the necessity of being &quot;born again.&quot; He is next met with in the Sanhedrin (<A HREF="../kjv/joh007.htm#050">Joh 7:50</A>), where he protested against the course they were taking in plotting against Christ. Once more he is mentioned as taking part in the preparation for the anointing and burial of the body of Christ (<A HREF="../kjv/joh019.htm#039">Joh 19:39</A>). We hear nothing more of him. There can be little doubt that he became a true disciple. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Nicolaitanes</B></A>     The church at Ephesus (<A HREF="../kjv/rev002.htm#006">Rev 2:6</A>) is commended for hating the &quot;deeds&quot; of the Nicolaitanes, and the church of Pergamos is blamed for having them who hold their &quot;doctrines&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/rev002.htm#015">Rev 2:15</A>). They were seemingly a class of professing Christians, who sought to introduce into the church a false freedom or licentiousness, thus abusing Paul's doctrine of grace (Compare <A HREF="../kjv/pe2002.htm#015">Pe2 2:15</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/pe2002.htm#016">Pe2 2:16</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/pe2002.htm#019">Pe2 2:19</A>), and were probably identical with those who held the doctrine of Baalam (q.v.), <A HREF="../kjv/rev002.htm#014">Rev 2:14</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Nicolas</B></A>     The victory of the people, a proselyte of Antioch, one of the seven deacons (<A HREF="../kjv/act006.htm#005">Act 6:5</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Nicopolis</B></A>     City of victory, where Paul intended to winter (<A HREF="../kjv/tit003.htm#012">Tit 3:12</A>). There were several cities of this name. The one here referred to was most probably that in Epirus, which was built by Augustus Caesar to commemorate his victory at the battle of Actium (B.C. 31). It is the modern Paleoprevesa, i.e., &quot;Old Prevesa.&quot; The subscription to the epistle to Titus calls it &quot;Nicopolis of Macedonia&quot;, i.e., of Thrace. This is, however, probably incorrect. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Niger</B></A>     Black, a surname of Simeon (<A HREF="../kjv/act013.htm#001">Act 13:1</A>). He was probably so called from his dark complexion.
