<span id="000">**Kirjath**</span> City, a city belonging to Benjamin
([Jos 18:28](../kjv/jos018.htm#028)), the modern Kuriet el- 'Enab ,
i.e., "city of grapes", about 7 1/2 miles west-north-west of Jerusalem.

<span id="001">**Kirjathaim**</span> Two cities; a double city. (1.) A
city of refuge in Naphtali ([Ch1 6:76](../kjv/ch1006.htm#076)). (2.) A
town on the east of Jordan ([Gen 14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005); [Deu
2:9](../kjv/deu002.htm#009), [Deu 2:10](../kjv/deu002.htm#010)). It was
assigned to the tribe of Reuben ([Num 32:37](../kjv/num032.htm#037)). In
the time of Ezekiel ([Eze 25:9](../kjv/eze025.htm#009)) it was one of
the four cities which formed the "glory of Moab" (Compare [Jer
48:1](../kjv/jer048.htm#001), [Jer 48:23](../kjv/jer048.htm#023)). It
has been identified with el-Kureiyat, 11 miles south-west of Medeba, on
the south slope of jebel Attarus, the ancient Ataroth.

<span id="002">**Kirjath-arba**</span> City of Arba, the original name
of Hebron (q.v.), so called from the name of its founder, one of the
Anakim ([Gen 23:2](../kjv/gen023.htm#002); [Gen
35:27](../kjv/gen035.htm#027); [Jos 15:13](../kjv/jos015.htm#013)). It
was given to Caleb by Joshua as his portion. The Jews interpret the name
as meaning "the city of the four", i.e., of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
Adam, who were all, as they allege, buried there.

<span id="003">**Kirjath-huzoth**</span> City of streets, [Num
22:39](../kjv/num022.htm#039), a Moabite city, which some identify with
Kirjathaim. Balak here received and entertained Balaam, whom he had
invited from Pethor, among the "mountains of the east," beyond the
Euphrates, to lay his ban upon the Israelites, whose progress he had no
hope otherwise of arresting. It was probably from the summit of Attarus,
the high place near the city, that the soothsayer first saw the
encampments of Israel.

<span id="004">**Kirjath-jearim**</span> City of Jaars; i.e., of woods
or forests, a Gibeonite town ([Jos 9:17](../kjv/jos009.htm#017)) on the
border of Benjamin, to which tribe it was assigned ([Jos
18:15](../kjv/jos018.htm#015), [Jos 18:28](../kjv/jos018.htm#028)). The
ark was brought to this place ([Sa1 7:1](../kjv/sa1007.htm#001), [Sa1
7:2](../kjv/sa1007.htm#002)) from Beth-shemesh and put in charge of
Abinadab, a Levite. Here it remained till it was removed by David to
Jerusalem ([Sa2 6:2](../kjv/sa2006.htm#002), [Sa2
6:3](../kjv/sa2006.htm#003), [Sa2 6:12](../kjv/sa2006.htm#012); 1 Chr.
15:1-29; compare Ps. 132). It was also called Baalah ([Jos
15:9](../kjv/jos015.htm#009)) and Kirjath-baal ([Jos
15:60](../kjv/jos015.htm#060)). It has been usually identified with
Kuriet el-'Enab (i.e., "city of grapes"), among the hills, about 8 miles
north-east of 'Ain Shems (i.e., Beth-shemesh). The opinion, however,
that it is to be identified with 'Erma , 4 miles east of 'Ain Shems , on
the edge of the valley of Sorek, seems to be better supported. (See
KIRJATH.) The words of [Psa 132:6](../kjv/psa132.htm#006), "We found it
in the fields of the wood," refer to the sojourn of the ark at
Kirjath-jearim. "Wood" is here the rendering of the Hebrew word jaar,
which is the singular of jearim.

<span id="005">**Kirjath-sannah**</span> City of the sannah; i.e., of
the palm(?), [Jos 15:49](../kjv/jos015.htm#049); the same as
Kirjath-sepher ([Jos 15:16](../kjv/jos015.htm#016); [Jdg
1:11](../kjv/jdg001.htm#011)) and Debir (q.v.), a Canaanitish royal city
included in Judah ([Jos 10:38](../kjv/jos010.htm#038); [Jos
15:49](../kjv/jos015.htm#049)), and probably the chief seat of learning
among the Hittites. It was about 12 miles to the south-west of Hebron.

<span id="006">**Kirjath-sepher**</span> City of books, [Jos
15:15](../kjv/jos015.htm#015); same as Kirjath-sannah (q.v.), now
represented by the valley of ed-Dhaberiyeh, south-west of Hebron. The
name of this town is an evidence that the Canaanites were acquainted
with writing and books. "The town probably contained a noted school, or
was the site of an oracle and the residence of some learned priest." The
"books" were probably engraved stones or bricks.

<span id="007">**Kish**</span> A bow. (1.) A Levite of the family of
Merari ([Ch1 23:21](../kjv/ch1023.htm#021); [Ch1
24:29](../kjv/ch1024.htm#029)). (2.) A Benjamite of Jerusalem ([Ch1
8:30](../kjv/ch1008.htm#030); [Ch1 9:36](../kjv/ch1009.htm#036)). (3.) A
Levite in the time of Hezekiah ([Ch2 29:12](../kjv/ch2029.htm#012)).
(4.) The great-grandfather of Mordecai ([Est
2:5](../kjv/est002.htm#005)). (5.) A Benjamite, the son of Abiel, and
father of king Saul ([Sa1 9:1](../kjv/sa1009.htm#001), [Sa1
9:3](../kjv/sa1009.htm#003); [Sa1 10:11](../kjv/sa1010.htm#011), [Sa1
10:21](../kjv/sa1010.htm#021); [Sa1 14:51](../kjv/sa1014.htm#051); [Sa2
21:14](../kjv/sa2021.htm#014)). All that is recorded of him is that he
sent his son Saul in search of his asses that had strayed, and that he
was buried in Zelah. Called Cis, [Act 13:21](../kjv/act013.htm#021)
(R.V., Kish).

<span id="008">**Kishion**</span> Hardness, a city of Issachar assigned
to the Gershonite Levites ([Jos 19:20](../kjv/jos019.htm#020)), the same
as Kishon ([Jos 21:28](../kjv/jos021.htm#028)).

<span id="009">**Kishon**</span> Winding, a winter torrent of Central
Palestine, which rises about the roots of Tabor and Gilboa, and passing
in a northerly direction through the plains of Esdraelon and Acre, falls
into the Mediterranean at the north-eastern corner of the bay of Acre,
at the foot of Carmel. It is the drain by which the waters of the plain
of Esdraelon and of the mountains that surround it find their way to the
sea. It bears the modern name of Nahr el-Mokattah, i.e., "the river of
slaughter" (Compare [Kg1 18:40](../kjv/kg1018.htm#040)). In the
triumphal song of Deborah ([Jdg 5:21](../kjv/jdg005.htm#021)) it is
spoken of as "that ancient river," either (1.) because it had flowed on
for ages, or (2.) according to the Targum, because it was "the torrent
in which were shown signs and wonders to Israel of old;" or (3.)
probably the reference is to the exploits in that region among the
ancient Canaanites, for the adjoining plain of Esdraelon was the great
battle-field of Palestine. This was the scene of the defeat of Sisera
([Jdg 4:7](../kjv/jdg004.htm#007), [Jdg 4:13](../kjv/jdg004.htm#013)),
and of the destruction of the prophets of Baal by Elijah ([Kg1
18:40](../kjv/kg1018.htm#040)). "When the Kishon was at its height, it
would be, partly on account of its quicksand, as impassable as the ocean
itself to a retreating army." (See DEBORAH.)
