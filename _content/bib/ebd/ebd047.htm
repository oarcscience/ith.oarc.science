<P><A NAME="000"><B>Bastard</B></A>     In the Old Testament the rendering of the Hebrew word  mamzer' , which means &quot;polluted.&quot; In <A HREF="../kjv/deu023.htm#002">Deu 23:2</A>, it occurs in the ordinary sense of illegitimate offspring. In <A HREF="../kjv/zac009.htm#006">Zac 9:6</A>, the word is used in the sense of foreigner. From the history of Jephthah we learn that there were bastard offspring among the Jews (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg011.htm#001">Jdg 11:1</A>). In <A HREF="../kjv/heb012.htm#008">Heb 12:8</A>, the word (Gr.  nothoi ) is used in its ordinary sense, and denotes those who do not share the privileges of God's children.
