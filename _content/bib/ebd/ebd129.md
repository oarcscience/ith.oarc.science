<span id="000">**Ezekias**</span> Grecized form of Hezekiah ([Mat
1:9](../kjv/mat001.htm#009), [Mat 1:10](../kjv/mat001.htm#010)).

<span id="001">**Ezekiel**</span> God will strengthen. (1.) [Ch1
24:16](../kjv/ch1024.htm#016), "Jehezekel." (2.) One of the great
prophets, the son of Buzi the priest ([Eze 1:3](../kjv/eze001.htm#003)).
He was one of the Jewish exiles who settled at Tel-Abib, on the banks of
the Chebar, "in the land of the Chaldeans." He was probably carried away
captive with Jehoiachin ([Eze 1:2](../kjv/eze001.htm#002); [Kg2
24:14](../kjv/kg2024.htm#014)) about 597 B.C.. His prophetic call came
to him "in the fifth year of Jehoiachin's captivity" (594 B.C.). He had
a house in the place of his exile, where he lost his wife, in the ninth
year of his exile, by some sudden and unforeseen stroke ([Eze
8:1](../kjv/eze008.htm#001); [Eze 24:18](../kjv/eze024.htm#018)). He
held a prominent place among the exiles, and was frequently consulted by
the elders ([Eze 8:1](../kjv/eze008.htm#001); [Eze
11:25](../kjv/eze011.htm#025); [Eze 14:1](../kjv/eze014.htm#001); [Eze
20:1](../kjv/eze020.htm#001)). His ministry extended over twenty-three
years ([Eze 29:17](../kjv/eze029.htm#017)), 595-573 B.C., during part of
which he was contemporary with Daniel ([Eze
14:14](../kjv/eze014.htm#014); [Eze 28:3](../kjv/eze028.htm#003)) and
Jeremiah, and probably also with Obadiah. The time and manner of his
death are unknown. His reputed tomb is pointed out in the neighbourhood
of Bagdad, at a place called Keffil.

<span id="002">**Ezekiel, Book of**</span> Consists mainly of three
groups of prophecies. After an account of his call to the prophetical
office (Ezek. 1 - 3:21), Ezekiel (1.) utters words of denunciation
against the Jews ([Eze 3:22](../kjv/eze003.htm#022)), warning them of
the certain destruction of Jerusalem, in opposition to the words of the
false prophets ([Eze 4:1](../kjv/eze004.htm#001)). The symbolical acts,
by which the extremities to which Jerusalem would be reduced are
described in Ezek. 4 - 5, show his intimate acquaintance with the
Levitical legislation. (See [Exo 22:30](../kjv/exo022.htm#030); [Deu
14:21](../kjv/deu014.htm#021); [Lev 5:2](../kjv/lev005.htm#002); [Lev
7:18](../kjv/lev007.htm#018), [Lev 7:24](../kjv/lev007.htm#024); [Lev
17:15](../kjv/lev017.htm#015); [Lev 19:7](../kjv/lev019.htm#007); [Lev
22:8](../kjv/lev022.htm#008), etc.) (2.) Prophecies against various
surrounding nations: against the Ammonites ([Eze
25:1](../kjv/eze025.htm#001)), the Moabites ([Eze
25:8](../kjv/eze025.htm#008)), the Edomites ([Eze
25:12](../kjv/eze025.htm#012)), the Philistines ([Eze
25:15](../kjv/eze025.htm#015)), Tyre and Sidon (Ezek. 26 - 28), and
against Egypt (Ezek. 29 - 32). (3.) Prophecies delivered after the
destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar: the triumphs of Israel and
of the kingdom of God on earth (Ezek. 33 - 39); Messianic times, and the
establishment and prosperity of the kingdom of God (Ezek. 40; Ezek. 48).
The closing visions of this book are referred to in the book of
Revelation (Ezek. 38 = [Rev 20:8](../kjv/rev020.htm#008); [Eze
47:1](../kjv/eze047.htm#001) = [Rev 22:1](../kjv/rev022.htm#001), [Rev
22:2](../kjv/rev022.htm#002)). Other references to this book are also
found in the New Testament. (Compare [Rom 2:24](../kjv/rom002.htm#024)
with [Eze 36:2](../kjv/eze036.htm#002); [Rom
10:5](../kjv/rom010.htm#005), [Gal 3:12](../kjv/gal003.htm#012) with
[Eze 20:11](../kjv/eze020.htm#011); [Pe2 3:4](../kjv/pe2003.htm#004)
with [Eze 12:22](../kjv/eze012.htm#022).) It may be noted that Daniel,
fourteen years after his deportation from Jerusalem, is mentioned by
Ezekiel ([Eze 14:14](../kjv/eze014.htm#014)) along with Noah and Job as
distinguished for his righteousness, and some five years later he is
spoken of as pre-eminent for his wisdom ([Eze
28:3](../kjv/eze028.htm#003)). Ezekiel's prophecies are characterized by
symbolical and allegorical representations, "unfolding a rich series of
majestic visions and of colossal symbols." There are a great many also
of "symbolical actions embodying vivid conceptions on the part of the
prophet" ([Eze 4:1](../kjv/eze004.htm#001); [Eze
5:1](../kjv/eze005.htm#001); [Eze 12:3](../kjv/eze012.htm#003); [Eze
24:3](../kjv/eze024.htm#003); [Eze 37:16](../kjv/eze037.htm#016), etc.)
"The mode of representation, in which symbols and allegories occupy a
prominent place, gives a dark, mysterious character to the prophecies of
Ezekiel. They are obscure and enigmatical. A cloudy mystery overhangs
them which it is almost impossible to penetrate. Jerome calls the book
'a labyrinth of the mysteries of God.' It was because of this obscurity
that the Jews forbade any one to read it till he had attained the age of
thirty." Ezekiel is singular in the frequency with which he refers to
the Pentateuch (e.g., Ezek. 27; [Eze 28:13](../kjv/eze028.htm#013); [Eze
31:8](../kjv/eze031.htm#008); [Eze 36:11](../kjv/eze036.htm#011), [Eze
36:34](../kjv/eze036.htm#034); [Eze 47:13](../kjv/eze047.htm#013),
etc.). He shows also an acquaintance with the writings of Hosea ([Eze
37:22](../kjv/eze037.htm#022)), Isaiah ([Eze
8:12](../kjv/eze008.htm#012); [Eze 29:6](../kjv/eze029.htm#006)), and
especially with those of Jeremiah, his older contemporary ([Jer
24:7](../kjv/jer024.htm#007), [Jer 24:9](../kjv/jer024.htm#009); [Jer
48:37](../kjv/jer048.htm#037)).

<span id="003">**Ezel**</span> A separation, ([Sa1
20:19](../kjv/sa1020.htm#019)), a stone, or heap of stones, in the
neighbourhood of Saul's residence, the scene of the parting of David and
Jonathan ([Sa1 20:42](../kjv/sa1020.htm#042)). The margin of the
Authorized Version reads, "The stone that sheweth the way," in this
rendering following the Targum.

<span id="004">**Ezer**</span> Treasure. (1.) One of the sons of Seir,
the native princes, "dukes," of Mount Hor ([Gen
36:21](../kjv/gen036.htm#021), [Gen 36:27](../kjv/gen036.htm#027)). (2.)
[Ch1 7:21](../kjv/ch1007.htm#021); (3.) [Ch1
4:4](../kjv/ch1004.htm#004). (4.) One of the Gadite champions who
repaired to David at Ziklag ([Ch1 12:9](../kjv/ch1012.htm#009)). (5.) A
Levite ([Neh 3:19](../kjv/neh003.htm#019)). (6.) A priest ([Neh
12:42](../kjv/neh012.htm#042)).

<span id="005">**Ezion-geber**</span> The giant's backbone (so called
from the head of a mountain which runs out into the sea), an ancient
city and harbour at the north-east end of the Elanitic branch of the Red
Sea, the Gulf of Akabah, near Elath or Eloth ([Num
33:35](../kjv/num033.htm#035); [Deu 2:8](../kjv/deu002.htm#008)). Here
Solomon built ships, "Tarshish ships," like those trading from Tyre to
Tarshish and the west, which traded with Ophir ([Kg1
9:26](../kjv/kg1009.htm#026); [Ch2 8:17](../kjv/ch2008.htm#017)); and
here also Jehoshaphat's fleet was shipwrecked ([Kg1
22:48](../kjv/kg1022.htm#048); [Ch2 20:36](../kjv/ch2020.htm#036)). It
became a populous town, many of the Jews settling in it ([Kg2
16:6](../kjv/kg2016.htm#006), "Elath"). It is supposed that anciently
the north end of the gulf flowed further into the country than now, as
far as 'Ain el-Ghudyan , which is 10 miles up the dry bed of the Arabah,
and that Ezion-geber may have been there.

<span id="006">**Ezra**</span> Help. (1.) A priest among those that
returned to Jerusalem under Zerubabel ([Neh
12:1](../kjv/neh012.htm#001)). (2.) The "scribe" who led the second body
of exiles that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem 459 B.C., and author
of the book of Scripture which bears his name. He was the son, or
perhaps grandson, of Seraiah ([Kg2 25:18](../kjv/kg2025.htm#018)), and a
lineal descendant of Phinehas, the son of Aaron ([Ezr
7:1](../kjv/ezr007.htm#001)). All we know of his personal history is
contained in the last four chapters of his book, and in Neh. 8 and [Neh
12:26](../kjv/neh012.htm#026). In the seventh year of the reign of
Artaxerxes Longimanus (see DARIUS), he obtained leave to go up to
Jerusalem and to take with him a company of Israelites (Ezra 8).
Artaxerxes manifested great interest in Ezra's undertaking, granting him
"all his request," and loading him with gifts for the house of God. Ezra
assembled the band of exiles, probably about 5,000 in all, who were
prepared to go up with him to Jerusalem, on the banks of the Ahava,
where they rested for three days, and were put into order for their
march across the desert, which was completed in four months. His
proceedings at Jerusalem on his arrival there are recorded in his book.
He was "a ready scribe in the law of Moses," who "had prepared his heart
to seek the law of the Lord and to do it, and to teach in Israel
statutes and judgments." "He is," says Professor Binnie, "the first
well-defined example of an order of men who have never since ceased in
the church; men of sacred erudition, who devote their lives to the study
of the Holy Scriptures, in order that they may be in a condition to
interpret them for the instruction and edification of the church. It is
significant that the earliest mention of the pulpit occurs in the
history of Ezra's ministry ([Neh 8:4](../kjv/neh008.htm#004)). He was
much more of a teacher than a priest. We learn from the account of his
labours in the book of Nehemiah that he was careful to have the whole
people instructed in the law of Moses; and there is no reason to reject
the constant tradition of the Jews which connects his name with the
collecting and editing of the Old Testament canon. The final completion
of the canon may have been, and probably was, the work of a later
generation; but Ezra seems to have put it much into the shape in which
it is still found in the Hebrew Bible. When it is added that the
complete organization of the synagogue dates from this period, it will
be seen that the age was emphatically one of Biblical study" (The
Psalms: their History, etc.). For about fourteen years, i.e., till 445
B.C., we have no record of what went on in Jerusalem after Ezra had set
in order the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of the nation. In that
year another distinguished personage, Nehemiah, appears on the scene.
After the ruined wall of the city had been built by Nehemiah, there was
a great gathering of the people at Jerusalem preparatory to the
dedication of the wall. On the appointed day the whole population
assembled, and the law was read aloud to them by Ezra and his assistants
([Neh 8:3](../kjv/neh008.htm#003)). The remarkable scene is described in
detail. There was a great religious awakening. For successive days they
held solemn assemblies, confessing their sins and offering up solemn
sacrifices. They kept also the feast of Tabernacles with great solemnity
and joyous enthusiasm, and then renewed their national covenant to be
the Lord's. Abuses were rectified, and arrangements for the temple
service completed, and now nothing remained but the dedication of the
walls of the city (Neh. 12).

<span id="007">**Ezra, Book of**</span> This book is the record of
events occurring at the close of the Babylonian exile. It was at one
time included in Nehemiah, the Jews regarding them as one volume. The
two are still distinguished in the Vulgate version as I. and II. Esdras.
It consists of two principal divisions: (1.) The history of the first
return of exiles, in the first year of Cyrus (536 B.C.), till the
completion and dedication of the new temple, in the sixth year of Darius
Hystapes (515 B.C.), Ezra 1 - 6. From the close of the sixth to the
opening of the seventh chapter there is a blank in the history of about
sixty years. (2.) The history of the second return under Ezra, in the
seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, and of the events that took place
at Jerusalem after Ezra's arrival there (Ezra 7 - 10). The book thus
contains memorabilia connected with the Jews, from the decree of Cyrus
(536 B.C.) to the reformation by Ezra (456 B.C.), extending over a
period of about eighty years. There is no quotation from this book in
the New Testament, but there never has been any doubt about its being
canonical. Ezra was probably the author of this book, at least of the
greater part of it (compare [Ezr 7:27](../kjv/ezr007.htm#027), [Ezr
7:28](../kjv/ezr007.htm#028); [Ezr 8:1](../kjv/ezr008.htm#001), etc.),
as he was also of the Books of Chronicles, the close of which forms the
opening passage of Ezra.

<span id="008">**Ezrahite**</span> A title given to Ethan ([Kg1
4:31](../kjv/kg1004.htm#031); Ps. 89, title) and Heman (Ps. 88, title).
They were both sons of Zerah ([Ch1 2:6](../kjv/ch1002.htm#006)).

<span id="009">**Ezri**</span> Help of Jehovah, the son of Chelub. He
superintended, under David, those who "did the work of the field for
tillage" ([Ch1 27:26](../kjv/ch1027.htm#026)).
