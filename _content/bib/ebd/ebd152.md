<span id="000">**Golan**</span> Exile, a city of Bashan ([Deu
4:43](../kjv/deu004.htm#043)), one of the three cities of refuge east of
Jordan, about 12 miles north-east of the Sea of Galilee ([Jos
20:8](../kjv/jos020.htm#008)). There are no further notices of it in
Scripture. It became the head of the province of Gaulanitis, one of the
four provinces into which Bashan was divided after the Babylonish
captivity, and almost identical with the modern Jaulan, in Western
Hauran, about 39 miles in length and 18 in breath.

<span id="001">**Gold**</span> (1.) Heb. zahab , so called from its
yellow colour([Exo 25:11](../kjv/exo025.htm#011); [Ch1
28:18](../kjv/ch1028.htm#018); [Ch2 3:5](../kjv/ch2003.htm#005)). (2.)
Heb. segor , from its compactness, or as being enclosed or treasured up;
thus precious or "fine gold" ([Kg1 6:20](../kjv/kg1006.htm#020); [Kg1
7:49](../kjv/kg1007.htm#049)). (3.) Heb. paz , native or pure gold ([Job
28:17](../kjv/job028.htm#017); [Psa 19:10](../kjv/psa019.htm#010); [Psa
21:3](../kjv/psa021.htm#003), etc.). (4.) Heb. betzer , "ore of gold or
silver" as dug out of the mine ([Job 36:19](../kjv/job036.htm#019),
where it means simply riches). (5.) Heb. kethem , i.e., something
concealed or separated ([Job 28:16](../kjv/job028.htm#016), [Job
28:19](../kjv/job028.htm#019); [Psa 45:9](../kjv/psa045.htm#009); [Pro
25:12](../kjv/pro025.htm#012)). Rendered "golden wedge" in [Isa
13:12](../kjv/isa013.htm#012). (6.) Heb. haruts , i.e., dug out; poetic
for gold ([Pro 8:10](../kjv/pro008.htm#010); [Pro
16:16](../kjv/pro016.htm#016); [Zac 9:3](../kjv/zac009.htm#003)). Gold
was known from the earliest times ([Gen 2:11](../kjv/gen002.htm#011)).
It was principally used for ornaments ([Gen
24:22](../kjv/gen024.htm#022)). It was very abundant ([Ch1
22:14](../kjv/ch1022.htm#014); [Nah 2:9](../kjv/nah002.htm#009); [Dan
3:1](../kjv/dan003.htm#001)). Many tons of it were used in connection
with the temple ([Ch2 1:15](../kjv/ch2001.htm#015)). It was found in
Arabia, Sheba, and Ophir ([Kg1 9:28](../kjv/kg1009.htm#028); [Kg1
10:1](../kjv/kg1010.htm#001); [Job 28:16](../kjv/job028.htm#016)), but
not in Palestine. In [Dan 2:38](../kjv/dan002.htm#038), the Babylonian
Empire is spoken of as a "head of gold" because of its great riches; and
Babylon was called by Isaiah ([Isa 14:4](../kjv/isa014.htm#004)) the
"golden city" (R.V. marg., "exactress," adopting the reading marhebah,
instead of the usual word madhebah).

<span id="002">**Golden Calf**</span> ([Exo
32:4](../kjv/exo032.htm#004), [Exo 32:8](../kjv/exo032.htm#008); [Deu
9:16](../kjv/deu009.htm#016); [Neh 9:18](../kjv/neh009.htm#018)). This
was a molten image of a calf which the idolatrous Israelites formed at
Sinai. This symbol was borrowed from the custom of the Egyptians. It was
destroyed at the command of Moses ([Exo 32:20](../kjv/exo032.htm#020)).
(See AARON; MOSES.)

<span id="003">**Goldsmith**</span> ([Neh 3:8](../kjv/neh003.htm#008),
[Neh 3:32](../kjv/neh003.htm#032); [Isa 40:19](../kjv/isa040.htm#019);
[Isa 41:7](../kjv/isa041.htm#007); [Isa 46:6](../kjv/isa046.htm#006)).
The word so rendered means properly a founder or finer.

<span id="004">**Golgotha**</span> The common name of the spot where
Jesus was crucified. It is interpreted by the evangelists as meaning
"the place of a skull" ([Mat 27:33](../kjv/mat027.htm#033); [Mar
15:22](../kjv/mar015.htm#022); [Joh 19:17](../kjv/joh019.htm#017)). This
name represents in Greek letters the Aramaic word Gulgaltha , which is
the Hebrew Gulgoleth ([Num 1:2](../kjv/num001.htm#002); [Ch1
23:3](../kjv/ch1023.htm#003), [Ch1 23:24](../kjv/ch1023.htm#024); [Kg2
9:35](../kjv/kg2009.htm#035)), meaning "a skull." See map, Plan of Skull
Hill It is identical with the word Calvary (q.v.). It was a little knoll
rounded like a bare skull. It is obvious from the evangelists that it
was some well-known spot outside the gate (compare [Heb
13:12](../kjv/heb013.htm#012)), and near the city ([Luk
23:26](../kjv/luk023.htm#026)), containing a "garden" ([Joh
19:41](../kjv/joh019.htm#041)), and on a thoroughfare leading into the
country. Hence it is an untenable idea that it is embraced within the
present "Church of the Holy Sepulchre." The hillock above Jeremiah's
Grotto, to the north of the city, is in all probability the true site of
Calvary. The skull-like appearance of the rock in the southern precipice
of the hillock is very remarkable.

<span id="005">**Goliath**</span> Great. (1.) A famous giant of Gath,
who for forty days openly defied the armies of Israel, but was at length
slain by David with a stone from a sling ([Sa1
17:4](../kjv/sa1017.htm#004)). He was probably descended from the
Rephaim who found refuge among the Philistines after they were dispersed
by the Ammonites ([Deu 2:20](../kjv/deu002.htm#020), [Deu
2:21](../kjv/deu002.htm#021)). His height was "six cubits and a span,"
which, taking the cubit at 21 inches, is equal to 10 1/2 feet. David cut
off his head ([Sa1 17:51](../kjv/sa1017.htm#051)) and brought it to
Jerusalem, while he hung the armour which he took from him in his tent.
His sword was preserved at Nobas a religious trophy ([Sa1
21:9](../kjv/sa1021.htm#009)). David's victory over Goliath was the
turning point in his life. He came into public notice now as the
deliverer of Israel and the chief among Saul's men of war ([Sa1
18:5](../kjv/sa1018.htm#005)), and the devoted friend of Jonathan. (2.)
In [Sa2 21:19](../kjv/sa2021.htm#019) there is another giant of the same
name mentioned as slain by Elhanan. The staff of his spear "was like a
weaver's beam." The Authorized Version interpolates the words "the
brother of" from [Ch1 20:5](../kjv/ch1020.htm#005), where this giant is
called Lahmi.

<span id="006">**Gomer**</span> Complete; vanishing. (1.) The daughter
of Diblaim, who (probably in vision only) became the wife of Hosea ([Hos
1:3](../kjv/hos001.htm#003)). (2.) The eldest son of Japheth, and father
of Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah ([Gen 10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002),
[Gen 10:3](../kjv/gen010.htm#003)), whose descendants formed the
principal branch of the population of South-eastern Europe. He is
generally regarded as the ancestor of the Celtae and the Cimmerii, who
in early times settled to the north of the Black Sea, and gave their
name to the Crimea, the ancient Chersonesus Taurica. Traces of their
presence are found in the names Cimmerian Bosphorus, Cimmerian Isthmus,
etc. In the seventh century B.C. they were driven out of their original
seat by the Scythians, and overran western Asia Minor, whence they were
afterwards expelled. They subsequently reappear in the times of the
Romans as the Cimbri of the north and west of Europe, whence they
crossed to the British Isles, where their descendants are still found in
the Gaels and Cymry. Thus the whole Celtic race may be regarded as
descended from Gomer.

<span id="007">**Gomorrah**</span> Submersion, one of the five cities of
the plain of Siddim (q.v.) which were destroyed by fire ([Gen
10:19](../kjv/gen010.htm#019); [Gen 13:10](../kjv/gen013.htm#010); [Gen
19:24](../kjv/gen019.htm#024), [Gen 19:28](../kjv/gen019.htm#028)).
These cities probably stood close together, and were near the northern
extremity of what is now the Dead Sea. This city is always mentioned
next after Sodom, both of which were types of impiety and wickedness
([Gen 18:20](../kjv/gen018.htm#020); [Rom 9:29](../kjv/rom009.htm#029)).
Their destruction is mentioned as an "example unto those that after
should live ungodly" ([Pe2 2:6](../kjv/pe2002.htm#006); [Jde
1:4](../kjv/jde001.htm#004)). Their wickedness became proverbial ([Deu
32:32](../kjv/deu032.htm#032); [Isa 1:9](../kjv/isa001.htm#009), [Isa
1:10](../kjv/isa001.htm#010); [Jer 23:14](../kjv/jer023.htm#014)). But
that wickedness may be exceeded ([Mat 10:15](../kjv/mat010.htm#015);
[Mar 6:11](../kjv/mar006.htm#011)). (See DEAD SEA).

<span id="008">**Goodly Trees**</span> Boughs of, were to be carried in
festive procession on the first day of the feast of Tabernacles ([Lev
23:40](../kjv/lev023.htm#040)). This was probably the olive tree ([Neh
8:15](../kjv/neh008.htm#015)), although no special tree is mentioned.

<span id="009">**Goodness of God**</span> A perfection of his character
which he exercises towards his creatures according to their various
circumstances and relations ([Psa 145:8](../kjv/psa145.htm#008), [Psa
145:9](../kjv/psa145.htm#009); [Psa 103:8](../kjv/psa103.htm#008); [Jo1
4:8](../kjv/jo1004.htm#008)). Viewed generally, it is benevolence; as
exercised with respect to the miseries of his creatures it is mercy,
pity, compassion, and in the case of impenitent sinners, long-suffering
patience; as exercised in communicating favour on the unworthy it is
grace. "Goodness and justice are the several aspects of one
unchangeable, infinitely wise, and sovereign moral perfection. God is
not sometimes merciful and sometimes just, but he is eternally
infinitely just and merciful." God is infinitely and unchangeably good
([Zep 3:17](../kjv/zep003.htm#017)), and his goodness is
incomprehensible by the finite mind ([Rom 11:35](../kjv/rom011.htm#035),
[Rom 11:36](../kjv/rom011.htm#036)). "God's goodness appears in two
things, giving and forgiving."
