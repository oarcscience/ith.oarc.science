<span id="000">**Koa**</span> He-camel, occurs only in [Eze
23:23](../kjv/eze023.htm#023), some province or place in the Babylonian
empire, used in this passage along with Shoa (q.v.).

<span id="001">**Kohath**</span> Assembly, the second son of Levi, and
father of Amram ([Gen 46:11](../kjv/gen046.htm#011)). He came down to
Egypt with Jacob, and lived to the age of one hundred and thirty-three
years ([Exo 6:18](../kjv/exo006.htm#018)).

<span id="002">**Kohathites**</span> The descendants of Kohath. They
formed the first of the three divisions of the Levites ([Exo
6:16](../kjv/exo006.htm#016), [Exo 6:18](../kjv/exo006.htm#018); [Num
3:17](../kjv/num003.htm#017)). In the journeys of the Israelites they
had the charge of the most holy portion of the vessels of the
tabernacle, including the ark (Num. 4). Their place in the marching and
encampment was south of the tabernacle ([Num
3:29](../kjv/num003.htm#029), [Num 3:31](../kjv/num003.htm#031)). Their
numbers at different times are specified ([Num
3:28](../kjv/num003.htm#028); [Num 4:36](../kjv/num004.htm#036); [Num
26:57](../kjv/num026.htm#057), [Num 26:62](../kjv/num026.htm#062)).
Samuel was of this division.

<span id="003">**Korah**</span> Ice, hail. (1.) The third son of Esau,
by Aholibamah ([Gen 36:14](../kjv/gen036.htm#014); [Ch1
1:35](../kjv/ch1001.htm#035)). (2.) A Levite, the son of Izhar, the
brother of Amram, the father of Moses and Aaron ([Exo
6:21](../kjv/exo006.htm#021)). The institution of the Aaronic priesthood
and the Levitical service at Sinai was a great religious revolution. The
old priesthood of the heads of families passed away. This gave rise to
murmurings and discontent, while the Israelites were encamped at Kadesh
for the first time, which came to a head in a rebellion against Moses
and Aaron, headed by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Two hundred and fifty
princes, "men of renown" i.e., well-known men from among the other
tribes, joined this conspiracy. The whole company demanded of Moses and
Aaron that the old state of things should be restored, alleging that
"they took too much upon them" ([Num 16:1](../kjv/num016.htm#001)). On
the morning after the outbreak, Korah and his associates presented
themselves at the door of the tabernacle, and "took every man his
censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon." But immediately
"fire from the Lord" burst forth and destroyed them all ([Num
16:35](../kjv/num016.htm#035)). Dathan and Abiram "came out and stood in
the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their
little children," and it came to pass "that the ground clave asunder
that was under them; and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them
up." A plague thereafter began among the people who sympathized in the
rebellion, and was only stayed by Aaron's appearing between the living
and the dead, and making "an atonement for the people" ([Num
16:47](../kjv/num016.htm#047)). The descendants of the sons of Korah who
did not participate in the rebellion afterwards rose to eminence in the
Levitical service.

<span id="004">**Korahites**</span> That portion of the Kohathites that
descended from Korah. (1.) They were an important branch of the singers
of the Kohathite division ([Ch2 20:19](../kjv/ch2020.htm#019)). There
are eleven psalms (Ps. 42 - 49; [Psa 84:1](../kjv/psa084.htm#001); [Psa
85:1](../kjv/psa085.htm#001); [Psa 87:1](../kjv/psa087.htm#001); 88)
dedicated to the sons of Korah. (2.) Some of the sons of Korah also were
"porters" of the temple ([Ch1 9:17](../kjv/ch1009.htm#017)); one of them
was over "things that were made in the pans" ([Ch1
9:31](../kjv/ch1009.htm#031)), i.e., the baking in pans for the
meat-offering ([Lev 2:5](../kjv/lev002.htm#005)).

<span id="005">**Kore**</span> Partridge. (1.) A Levite and
temple-warder of the Korahites, the son of Asaph. He was father of
Shallum and Meshelemiah, temple-porters ([Ch1
9:19](../kjv/ch1009.htm#019); [Ch1 26:1](../kjv/ch1026.htm#001)). (2.) A
Levitical porter at the east gate of the temple ([Ch2
31:14](../kjv/ch2031.htm#014)). (3.) In [Ch1
26:19](../kjv/ch1026.htm#019) the word should be "Korahites," as in the
Revised Version.

<span id="006">**Korhites**</span> A Levitical family descended from
Korah ([Exo 6:24](../kjv/exo006.htm#024); [Ch1
12:6](../kjv/ch1012.htm#006); [Ch1 26:1](../kjv/ch1026.htm#001); [Ch2
20:19](../kjv/ch2020.htm#019)).

<span id="007">**Koz**</span> Thorn. (1.) A descendant of Judah. [Ch1
4:8](../kjv/ch1004.htm#008), "Coz;" R.V., "Hakkoz." (2.) A priest, the
head of the seventh division of the priests ([Ezr
2:61](../kjv/ezr002.htm#061); [Neh 3:4](../kjv/neh003.htm#004), [Neh
3:21](../kjv/neh003.htm#021); [Neh 7:63](../kjv/neh007.htm#063)). In
[Ch1 24:10](../kjv/ch1024.htm#010) the word has the article prefixed,
and it is taken as a part of the word "Hakkoz."

<span id="008">**Laban**</span> White. (1.) The son of Bethuel, who was
the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother. He lived at Haran in Mesopotamia.
His sister Rebekah was Isaac's wife (Gen. 24). Jacob, one of the sons of
this marriage, fled to the house of Laban, whose daughters Leah and
Rachel (Gen. 29) he eventually married. (See JACOB.) (2.) A city in the
Arabian desert in the route of the Israelites ([Deu
1:1](../kjv/deu001.htm#001)), probably identical with Libnah ([Num
33:20](../kjv/num033.htm#020)).

<span id="009">**Lachish**</span> Impregnable, a royal Canaanitish city
in the Shephelah, or maritime plain of Palestine ([Jos
10:3](../kjv/jos010.htm#003), [Jos 10:5](../kjv/jos010.htm#005); [Jos
12:11](../kjv/jos012.htm#011)). It was taken and destroyed by the
Israelites ([Jos 10:31](../kjv/jos010.htm#031)). It afterwards became,
under Rehoboam, one of the strongest fortresses of Judah ([Ch2
10:9](../kjv/ch2010.htm#009)). It was assaulted and probably taken by
Sennacherib ([Kg2 18:14](../kjv/kg2018.htm#014), [Kg2
18:17](../kjv/kg2018.htm#017); [Kg2 19:8](../kjv/kg2019.htm#008); [Isa
36:2](../kjv/isa036.htm#002)). An account of this siege is given on some
slabs found in the chambers of the palace of Koyunjik, and now in the
British Museum. The inscription has been deciphered as follows:
"Sennacherib, the mighty king, king of the country of Assyria, sitting
on the throne of judgment before the city of Lachish: I gave permission
for its slaughter." (See Nineveh.) Lachish has been identified with
Tell-el-Hesy, where a cuneiform tablet has been found, containing a
letter supposed to be from Amenophis at Amarna in reply to one of the
Amarna tablets sent by Zimrida from Lachish. This letter is from the
chief of Atim (= Etam, [Ch1 4:32](../kjv/ch1004.htm#032)) to the chief
of Lachish, in which the writer expresses great alarm at the approach of
marauders from the Hebron hills. "They have entered the land," he says,
"to lay waste... strong is he who has come down. He lays waste." This
letter shows that "the communication by tablets in cuneiform script was
not only usual in writing to Egypt, but in the internal correspondence
of the country. The letter, though not so important in some ways as the
Moabite stone and the Siloam text, is one of the most valuable
discoveries ever made in Palestine" (Conder's Tell Amarna Tablets, p.
134). Excavations at Lachish are still going on, and among other
discoveries is that of an iron blast-furnace, with slag and ashes, which
is supposed to have existed 1500 B.C.. If the theories of experts are
correct, the use of the hot-air blast instead of cold air (an
improvement in iron manufacture patented by Neilson in 1828) was known
fifteen hundred years before Christ. (See FURNACE.) Letter to Zimrida,
governor of Sidon and Lachish, part of the general diplomatic
correspondence carried on between Amenophis III. and IV. and their
agents in various Palestinian towns. Found by Mr. Bliss. Now in the
Imperial Museum, Constantinople.
