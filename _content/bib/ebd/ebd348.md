<span id="000">**Son of God**</span> The plural, "sons of God," is used
([Gen 6:2](../kjv/gen006.htm#002), [Gen 6:4](../kjv/gen006.htm#004)) to
denote the pious descendants of Seth. In [Job
1:6](../kjv/job001.htm#006); [Job 38:7](../kjv/job038.htm#007) this name
is applied to the angels. Hosea uses the phrase ([Hos
1:10](../kjv/hos001.htm#010)) to designate the gracious relation in
which men stand to God. In the New Testament this phrase frequently
denotes the relation into which we are brought to God by adoption ([Rom
8:14](../kjv/rom008.htm#014), [Rom 8:19](../kjv/rom008.htm#019); [Co2
6:18](../kjv/co2006.htm#018); [Gal 4:5](../kjv/gal004.htm#005), [Gal
4:6](../kjv/gal004.htm#006); [Phi 2:15](../kjv/phi002.htm#015); [Jo1
3:1](../kjv/jo1003.htm#001), [Jo1 3:2](../kjv/jo1003.htm#002)). It
occurs thirty-seven times in the New Testament as the distinctive title
of our Saviour. He does not bear this title in consequence of his
miraculous birth, nor of his incarnation, his resurrection, and
exaltation to the Father's right hand. This is a title of nature and not
of office. The sonship of Christ denotes his equality with the Father.
To call Christ the Son of God is to assert his true and proper divinity.
The second Person of the Trinity, because of his eternal relation to the
first Person, is the Son of God. He is the Son of God as to his divine
nature, while as to his human nature he is the Son of David ([Rom
1:3](../kjv/rom001.htm#003), [Rom 1:4](../kjv/rom001.htm#004). Compare
[Gal 4:4](../kjv/gal004.htm#004); [Joh 1:1](../kjv/joh001.htm#001); [Joh
5:18](../kjv/joh005.htm#018); [Joh 10:30](../kjv/joh010.htm#030), which
prove that Christ was the Son of God before his incarnation, and that
his claim to this title is a claim of equality with God). When used with
reference to creatures, whether men or angels, this word is always in
the plural. In the singular it is always used of the second Person of
the Trinity, with the single exception of [Luk
3:38](../kjv/luk003.htm#038), where it is used of Adam.

<span id="001">**Son of Man**</span> (1.) Denotes mankind generally,
with special reference to their weakness and frailty ([Job
25:6](../kjv/job025.htm#006); [Psa 8:4](../kjv/psa008.htm#004); [Psa
144:3](../kjv/psa144.htm#003); [Psa 146:3](../kjv/psa146.htm#003); [Isa
51:12](../kjv/isa051.htm#012), etc.). (2.) It is a title frequently
given to the prophet Ezekiel, probably to remind him of his human
weakness. (3.) In the New Testament it is used forty-three times as a
distinctive title of the Saviour. In the Old Testament it is used only
in [Psa 80:17](../kjv/psa080.htm#017) and [Dan
7:13](../kjv/dan007.htm#013) with this application. It denotes the true
humanity of our Lord. He had a true body ([Heb
2:14](../kjv/heb002.htm#014); [Luk 24:39](../kjv/luk024.htm#039)) and a
rational soul. He was perfect man.

<span id="002">**Songs**</span> Of Moses (Ex. 15; [Num
21:17](../kjv/num021.htm#017); Deut. 32; [Rev
15:3](../kjv/rev015.htm#003)), Deborah (Judg. 5), Hannah (1 Sam. 2),
David (2 Sam. 22, and Psalms), Mary ([Luk 1:46](../kjv/luk001.htm#046)),
Zacharias ([Luk 1:68](../kjv/luk001.htm#068)), the angels ([Luk
2:13](../kjv/luk002.htm#013)), Simeon ([Luk
2:29](../kjv/luk002.htm#029)), the redeemed ([Rev
5:9](../kjv/rev005.htm#009); 19), Solomon (see SOLOMON, SONGS OF).

<span id="003">**Soothsayer**</span> One who pretends to prognosticate
future events. Baalam is so called ([Jos 13:22](../kjv/jos013.htm#022);
Heb. kosem , a "diviner," as rendered [Sa1 6:2](../kjv/sa1006.htm#002);
rendered "prudent," [Isa 3:2](../kjv/isa003.htm#002)). In [Isa
2:6](../kjv/isa002.htm#006) and [Mic 5:12](../kjv/mic005.htm#012) (Heb.
yonenim , i.e., "diviners of the clouds") the word is used of the
Chaldean diviners who studied the clouds. In [Dan
2:27](../kjv/dan002.htm#027); [Dan 5:7](../kjv/dan005.htm#007) the word
is the rendering of the Chaldee gazrin, i.e., "deciders" or
"determiners", here applied to Chaldean astrologers, "who, by casting
nativities from the place of the stars at one's birth, and by various
arts of computing and divining, foretold the fortunes and destinies of
individuals.", Gesenius, Lex. Heb. (See SORCERER.)

<span id="004">**Sop**</span> A morsel of bread ([Joh
13:26](../kjv/joh013.htm#026); compare [Rut
2:14](../kjv/rut002.htm#014)). Our Lord took a piece of unleavened
bread, and dipping it into the broth of bitter herbs at the Paschal
meal, gave it to Judas. (Compare [Rut 2:14](../kjv/rut002.htm#014).)

<span id="005">**Sopater**</span> The father who saves, probably the
same as Sosipater, a kinsman of Paul ([Rom
16:21](../kjv/rom016.htm#021)), a Christian of the city of Berea who
accompanied Paul into Asia ([Act 20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004)).

<span id="006">**Sorcerer**</span> From the Latin sortiarius , one who
casts lots, or one who tells the lot of others. (See DIVINATION.) In
[Dan 2:2](../kjv/dan002.htm#002) it is the rendering of the Hebrew
mekhashphim, i.e., mutterers, men who professed to have power with evil
spirits. The practice of sorcery exposed to severest punishment ([Mal
3:5](../kjv/mal003.htm#005); [Rev 21:8](../kjv/rev021.htm#008); [Rev
22:15](../kjv/rev022.htm#015)).

<span id="007">**Sorek**</span> Choice vine, the name of a valley, i.e.,
a torrent-bed, now the Wady Surar, "valley of the fertile spot," which
drains the western Judean hills, and flowing by Makkedah and Jabneel,
falls into the sea some eight miles south of Joppa. This was the home of
Deliah, whom Samson loved ([Jdg 16:4](../kjv/jdg016.htm#004)).

<span id="008">**Sosipater**</span> (See SOPATER.)

<span id="009">**Sosthenes**</span> Safe in strength, the chief ruler of
the synagogue at Corinth, who was seized and beaten by the mob in the
presence of Gallio, the Roman governor, when he refused to proceed
against Paul at the instigation of the Jews ([Act
18:12](../kjv/act018.htm#012)). The motives of this assault against
Sosthenes are not recorded, nor is it mentioned whether it was made by
Greeks or Romans. Some identify him, but without sufficient grounds,
with one whom Paul calls "Sosthenes our brother," a convert to the faith
([Co1 1:1](../kjv/co1001.htm#001)).
