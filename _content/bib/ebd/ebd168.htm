<P><A NAME="000"><B>Havoth-jair</B></A>     Hamlets of the enlightener a district in the east of Jordan.     (1.) Jair, the son of Manasseh, took some villages of Gilead and called them by this name (<A HREF="../kjv/num032.htm#041">Num 32:41</A>). (2.) Again, it is said that Jair &quot;took all the tract of Argob,&quot; and called it Bashanhavoth-jair (<A HREF="../kjv/deu003.htm#014">Deu 3:14</A>). (See also <A HREF="../kjv/jos013.htm#030">Jos 13:30</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg1004.htm#013">Kg1 4:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1002.htm#022">Ch1 2:22</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch1002.htm#023">Ch1 2:23</A>.)

<P><A NAME="001"><B>Hawk</B></A>     (Heb.  netz , a word expressive of strong and rapid flight, and hence appropriate to the hawk). It is an unclean bird (<A HREF="../kjv/lev011.htm#016">Lev 11:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu014.htm#015">Deu 14:15</A>). It is common in Syria and surrounding countries. The Hebrew word includes various species of Falconidoe, with special reference perhaps to the kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), the hobby (Hypotriorchis subbuteo), and the lesser kestrel (Tin, Cenchris). The kestrel remains all the year in Palestine, but some ten or twelve other species are all migrants from the south. Of those summer visitors to Palestine special mention may be made of the Falco sacer and the Falco lanarius. (See NIGHT-HAWK.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Hay</B></A>     Properly so called, was not in use among the Hebrews; straw was used instead. They cut the grass green as it was needed. The word rendered &quot;hay&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/pro027.htm#025">Pro 27:25</A> means the first shoots of the grass. In <A HREF="../kjv/isa015.htm#006">Isa 15:6</A> the Revised Version has correctly &quot;grass,&quot; where the Authorized Version has &quot;hay.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Hazael</B></A>     Whom God beholds, an officer of Ben-hadad II., king of Syria, who ultimately came to the throne, according to the word of the Lord to Elijah (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1019.htm#015">Kg1 19:15</A>), after he had put the king to death (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2008.htm#015">Kg2 8:15</A>), after he had put the king to death (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2008.htm#015">Kg2 8:15</A>). His interview with Elisha is mentioned in 2 Kings 8. The Assyrians soon after his accession to the throne came against him and defeated him with very great loss; and three years afterwards again invaded Syria, but on this occasion Hazael submitted to them. He then turned his arms against Israel, and ravaged &quot;all the land of Gilead,&quot; etc. (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2010.htm#033">Kg2 10:33</A>), which he held in a degree of subjection to him (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2013.htm#003">Kg2 13:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg2013.htm#022">Kg2 13:22</A>). He aimed at the subjugation also of the kingdom of Judah, when Joash obtained peace by giving him &quot;all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the king's house&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2012.htm#018">Kg2 12:18</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2024.htm#024">Ch2 24:24</A>). He reigned about forty-six years (B.C.886-840), and was succeeded on the throne by his son Ben-hadad (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2013.htm#022">Kg2 13:22</A>), who on several occasions was defeated by Jehoash, the king of Israel, and compelled to restore all the land of Israel his father had taken.

<P><A NAME="004"><B>Hazar-addar</B></A>     Village of Addar, a place in the southern boundary of Palestine (<A HREF="../kjv/num034.htm#004">Num 34:4</A>), in the desert to the west of Kadesh-barnea. It is called Adar in <A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#003">Jos 15:3</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Hazar-enan</B></A>     Village of fountains, a place on the north-east frontier of Palestine (<A HREF="../kjv/num034.htm#009">Num 34:9</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num034.htm#010">Num 34:10</A>). Some have identified it with Ayan ed-Dara in the heart of the central chain of Anti-Libanus. More probably, however, it has been identified with Kuryetein, about 60 miles east-north-east of Damascus. (Compare <A HREF="../kjv/eze047.htm#017">Eze 47:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/eze048.htm#001">Eze 48:1</A>.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Hazar-gaddah</B></A>     Village of fortune, a city on the south border of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#027">Jos 15:27</A>), midway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Hazar-hatticon</B></A>     Village of the midway a place near Hamath in the confines of Hauran (<A HREF="../kjv/eze047.htm#016">Eze 47:16</A>), probably on the north brow of Hermon. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Hazar-maveth</B></A>     Court of death, the third son of Joktan, and a region in Arabia-Felix settled by him (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#026">Gen 10:26</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1001.htm#020">Ch1 1:20</A>). It is probably the modern province of Hadramaut, situated on the Indian Ocean east of the modern Yemen. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Hazar-shual</B></A>     Village or enclosure of the jackal, a city on the south border of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#028">Jos 15:28</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh011.htm#027">Neh 11:27</A>). It has been identified with the ruins of Saweh, half-way between Beersheba and Moladah.
