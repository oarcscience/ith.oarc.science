<span id="000">**Tebeth**</span> ([Est 2:16](../kjv/est002.htm#016)), a
word probably of Persian origin, denoting the cold time of the year;
used by the later Jews as denoting the tenth month of the year. Assyrian
tebituv, "rain."

<span id="001">**Teil Tree**</span> (an old name for the lime-tree, the
tilia), [Isa 6:13](../kjv/isa006.htm#013), the terebinth, or
turpentine-tree, the Pistacia terebinthus of botanists. The Hebrew word
here used (elah) is rendered oak (q.v.) in [Gen
35:4](../kjv/gen035.htm#004); [Jdg 6:11](../kjv/jdg006.htm#011), [Jdg
6:19](../kjv/jdg006.htm#019); [Isa 1:29](../kjv/isa001.htm#029), etc. In
[Isa 61:3](../kjv/isa061.htm#003) it is rendered in the plural "trees;"
[Hos 4:13](../kjv/hos004.htm#013), "elm" (R.V., "terebinth"). [Hos
4:13](../kjv/hos004.htm#013), "elm" (R.V., "terebinth"). In [Sa1
17:2](../kjv/sa1017.htm#002), [Sa1 17:19](../kjv/sa1017.htm#019) it is
taken as a proper name, "Elah" (R.V. marg., "terebinth"). "The terebinth
of Mamre, or its lineal successor, remained from the days of Abraham
till the fourth century of the Christian era, and on its site
Constantine erected a Christian church, the ruins of which still
remain." This tree "is seldom seen in clumps or groves, never in
forests, but stands isolated and weird-like in some bare ravine or on a
hill-side where nothing else towers above the low brushwood" (Tristram).

<span id="002">**Tekel**</span> Weighed ([Dan
5:27](../kjv/dan005.htm#027)).

<span id="003">**Tekoa, Tekoah**</span> Pitching of tents; fastening
down, a town of Judah, about 12 miles south of Jerusalem, and visible
from the city. From this place Joab procured a "wise woman," who
pretended to be in great affliction, and skillfully made her case known
to David. Her address to the king was in the form of an apology, similar
to that of Nathan ([Sa2 12:1](../kjv/sa2012.htm#001)). The object of
Joab was, by the intervention of this woman, to induce David to bring
back Absalom to Jerusalem ([Sa2 14:2](../kjv/sa2014.htm#002), [Sa2
14:4](../kjv/sa2014.htm#004), [Sa2 14:9](../kjv/sa2014.htm#009)). This
was also the birth-place of the prophet Amos ([Amo
1:1](../kjv/amo001.htm#001)). It is now the village of Tekua, on the top
of a hill among ruins, 5 miles south of Bethlehem, and close to
Beth-haccerem ("Herod's mountain").

<span id="004">**Tel-abib**</span> Hill of corn, a place on the river
Chebar, the residence of Ezekiel ([Eze 3:15](../kjv/eze003.htm#015)).
The site is unknown.

<span id="005">**Telaim**</span> Young lambs, a place at which Saul
gathered his army to fight against Amalek ([Sa1
15:4](../kjv/sa1015.htm#004)); probably the same as Telem (2.).

<span id="006">**Telassar**</span> Or Thelasar, ([Isa
37:12](../kjv/isa037.htm#012); [Kg2 19:12](../kjv/kg2019.htm#012)), a
province in the south-east of Assyria, probably in Babylonia. Some have
identified it with Tel Afer, a place in Mesopotamia, some 30 miles from
Sinjar.

<span id="007">**Telem**</span> Oppression. (1.) A porter of the temple
in the time of Ezra ([Ezr 10:24](../kjv/ezr010.htm#024)). (2.) A town in
the southern border of Judah ([Jos 15:24](../kjv/jos015.htm#024));
probably the same as Telaim.

<span id="008">**Tel-haresha**</span> Hill of the wood, a place in
Babylon from which some captive Jews returned to Jerusalem ([Ezr
2:59](../kjv/ezr002.htm#059); [Neh 7:61](../kjv/neh007.htm#061)).

<span id="009">**Tel-melah**</span> Hill of salt, a place in Babylon
from which the Jews returned (id.).
