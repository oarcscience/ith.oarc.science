<span id="000">**Almon**</span> Hidden one of the sacerdotal cities of
Benjamin ([Jos 21:18](../kjv/jos021.htm#018)), called also Alemeth ([Ch1
6:60](../kjv/ch1006.htm#060)).

<span id="001">**Almond**</span> A native of Syria and Palestine. In
form, blossoms, and fruit it resembles the peach tree. Its blossoms are
of a very pale pink colour, and appear before its leaves. Its Hebrew
name, shaked, signifying "wakeful, hastening," is given to it on account
of its putting forth its blossoms so early, generally in February, and
sometimes even in January. In [Ecc 12:5](../kjv/ecc012.htm#005), it is
referred to as illustrative, probably, of the haste with which old age
comes. There are others, however, who still contend for the old
interpretation here. "The almond tree bears its blossoms in the midst of
winter, on a naked, leafless stem, and these blossoms (reddish or
flesh-colored in the beginning) seem at the time of their fall exactly
like white snow-flakes. In this way the almond blossom is a very fitting
symbol of old age, with its silvery hair and its wintry, dry, barren,
unfruitful condition." In [Jer 1:11](../kjv/jer001.htm#011) "I see a rod
of an almond tree \[shaked\]... for I will hasten \[shaked\] my word to
perform it" the word is used as an emblem of promptitude. Jacob desired
his sons ([Gen 43:11](../kjv/gen043.htm#011)) to take with them into
Egypt of the best fruits of the land, almonds, etc., as a present to
Joseph, probably because this tree was not a native of Egypt. Aaron's
rod yielded almonds ([Num 17:8](../kjv/num017.htm#008); [Heb
9:4](../kjv/heb009.htm#004)). Moses was directed to make certain parts
of the candlestick for the ark of carved work "like unto almonds" ([Exo
25:33](../kjv/exo025.htm#033), [Exo 25:34](../kjv/exo025.htm#034)). The
Hebrew word luz, translated "hazel" in the Authorized Version ([Gen
30:37](../kjv/gen030.htm#037)), is rendered in the Revised Version
"almond." It is probable that luz denotes the wild almond, while shaked
denotes the cultivated variety.

<span id="002">**Alms**</span> Not found in the Old Testament, but
repeatedly in the New. The Mosaic legislation ([Lev
25:35](../kjv/lev025.htm#035); [Deu 15:7](../kjv/deu015.htm#007)) tended
to promote a spirit of charity, and to prevent the occurrence of
destitution among the people. Such passages as these, [Psa
41:1](../kjv/psa041.htm#001); [Psa 112:9](../kjv/psa112.htm#009); [Pro
14:31](../kjv/pro014.htm#031); [Isa 10:2](../kjv/isa010.htm#002); [Amo
2:7](../kjv/amo002.htm#007); [Jer 5:28](../kjv/jer005.htm#028); [Eze
22:29](../kjv/eze022.htm#029), would also naturally foster the same
benevolent spirit. In the time of our Lord begging was common ([Mar
10:46](../kjv/mar010.htm#046); [Act 3:2](../kjv/act003.htm#002)). The
Pharisees were very ostentatious in their almsgivings ([Mat
6:2](../kjv/mat006.htm#002)). The spirit by which the Christian ought to
be actuated in this duty is set forth in [Jo1
3:17](../kjv/jo1003.htm#017). A regard to the state of the poor and
needy is enjoined as a Christian duty ([Luk
3:11](../kjv/luk003.htm#011); [Luk 6:30](../kjv/luk006.htm#030); [Mat
6:1](../kjv/mat006.htm#001); [Act 9:36](../kjv/act009.htm#036); [Act
10:2](../kjv/act010.htm#002), [Act 10:4](../kjv/act010.htm#004)), a duty
which was not neglected by the early Christians ([Luk
14:13](../kjv/luk014.htm#013); [Act 20:35](../kjv/act020.htm#035); [Gal
2:10](../kjv/gal002.htm#010); [Rom 15:25](../kjv/rom015.htm#025); [Co1
16:1](../kjv/co1016.htm#001)). They cared not only for the poor among
themselves, but contributed also to the necessities of those at a
distance ([Act 11:29](../kjv/act011.htm#029); [Act
24:17](../kjv/act024.htm#017); [Co2 9:12](../kjv/co2009.htm#012)). Our
Lord and his attendants showed an example also in this ([Joh
13:29](../kjv/joh013.htm#029)). In modern times the "poor-laws" have
introduced an element which modifies considerably the form in which we
may discharge this Christian duty.

<span id="003">**Almug**</span> ([Kg1 10:11](../kjv/kg1010.htm#011),
[Kg1 10:12](../kjv/kg1010.htm#012)) = algum ([Ch2
2:8](../kjv/ch2002.htm#008); [Ch2 9:10](../kjv/ch2009.htm#010), [Ch2
9:11](../kjv/ch2009.htm#011)), in the Hebrew occurring only in the
plural almuggim (indicating that the wood was brought in planks), the
name of a wood brought from Ophir to be used in the building of the
temple, and for other purposes. Some suppose it to have been the white
sandal-wood of India, the Santalum album of botanists, a native of the
mountainous parts of the Malabar coasts. It is a fragrant wood, and is
used in China for incense in idol-worship. Others, with some
probability, think that it was the Indian red sandal-wood, the
pterocarpus santalinus, a heavy, fine-grained wood, the Sanscrit name of
which is valguka. It is found on the Coromandel coast and in Ceylon.

<span id="004">**Aloes**</span> (Heb. 'ahalim ), a fragrant wood ([Num
24:6](../kjv/num024.htm#006); [Psa 45:8](../kjv/psa045.htm#008); [Pro
7:17](../kjv/pro007.htm#017); [Sol 4:14](../kjv/sol004.htm#014)), the
Aquilaria agallochum of botanists, or, as some suppose, the costly gum
or perfume extracted from the wood. It is found in China, Siam, and
Northern India, and grows to the height sometimes of 120 feet. This
species is of great rarity even in India. There is another and more
common species, called by Indians aghil, whence Europeans have given it
the name of Lignum aquile, or eagle-wood. Aloewood was used by the
Egyptians for embalming dead bodies. Nicodemus brought it (pounded
aloe-wood) to embalm the body of Christ ([Joh
19:39](../kjv/joh019.htm#039)); but whether this was the same as that
mentioned elsewhere is uncertain. The bitter aloes of the apothecary is
the dried juice of the leaves Aloe vulgaris.

<span id="005">**Alphaeus**</span> (1.) The father of James the Less,
the apostle and writer of the epistle ([Mat
10:3](../kjv/mat010.htm#003); [Mar 3:18](../kjv/mar003.htm#018); [Luk
6:15](../kjv/luk006.htm#015); [Act 1:13](../kjv/act001.htm#013)), and
the husband of Mary ([Joh 19:25](../kjv/joh019.htm#025)). The Hebrew
form of this name is Cleopas, or Clopas (q.v.). (2.) The father of Levi,
or Matthew ([Mar 2:14](../kjv/mar002.htm#014)).

<span id="006">**Altar**</span> (Heb. mizbe'ah , from a word meaning "to
slay"), any structure of earth ([Exo 20:24](../kjv/exo020.htm#024)) or
unwrought stone ([Exo 20:25](../kjv/exo020.htm#025)) on which sacrifices
were offered. Altars were generally erected in conspicuous places ([Gen
22:9](../kjv/gen022.htm#009); [Eze 6:3](../kjv/eze006.htm#003); [Kg2
23:12](../kjv/kg2023.htm#012); [Kg2 16:4](../kjv/kg2016.htm#004); [Kg2
23:8](../kjv/kg2023.htm#008); [Act 14:13](../kjv/act014.htm#013)). The
word is used in [Heb 13:10](../kjv/heb013.htm#010) for the sacrifice
offered upon it the sacrifice Christ offered. Paul found among the many
altars erected in Athens one bearing the inscription, "To the unknown
God" ([Act 17:23](../kjv/act017.htm#023)), or rather "to an \[i.e.,
some\] unknown God." The reason for this inscription cannot now be
accurately determined. It afforded the apostle the occasion of
proclaiming the gospel to the "men of Athens." The first altar we read
of is that erected by Noah ([Gen 8:20](../kjv/gen008.htm#020)). Altars
were erected by Abraham ([Gen 12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007); [Gen
13:4](../kjv/gen013.htm#004); [Gen 22:9](../kjv/gen022.htm#009)), by
Isaac ([Gen 26:25](../kjv/gen026.htm#025)), by Jacob ([Gen
33:20](../kjv/gen033.htm#020); [Gen 35:1](../kjv/gen035.htm#001), [Gen
35:3](../kjv/gen035.htm#003)), and by Moses ([Exo
17:15](../kjv/exo017.htm#015), "Jehovah-nissi"). In the tabernacle, and
afterwards in the temple, two altars were erected. (1.) The altar of
burnt offering ([Exo 30:28](../kjv/exo030.htm#028)), called also the
"brasen altar" ([Exo 39:39](../kjv/exo039.htm#039)) and "the table of
the Lord" ([Mal 1:7](../kjv/mal001.htm#007)). This altar, as erected in
the tabernacle, is described in [Exo 27:1](../kjv/exo027.htm#001). It
was a hollow square, 5 cubits in length and in breadth, and 3 cubits in
height. It was made of shittim wood, and was overlaid with plates of
brass. Its corners were ornamented with "horns" ([Exo
29:12](../kjv/exo029.htm#012); [Lev 4:18](../kjv/lev004.htm#018)). In
[Exo 27:3](../kjv/exo027.htm#003) the various utensils appertaining to
the altar are enumerated. They were made of brass. (Compare [Sa1
2:13](../kjv/sa1002.htm#013), [Sa1 2:14](../kjv/sa1002.htm#014); [Lev
16:12](../kjv/lev016.htm#012); [Num 16:6](../kjv/num016.htm#006), [Num
16:7](../kjv/num016.htm#007).) In Solomon's temple the altar was of
larger dimensions ([Ch2 4:1](../kjv/ch2004.htm#001). Compare [Kg1
8:22](../kjv/kg1008.htm#022), [Kg1 8:64](../kjv/kg1008.htm#064); [Kg1
9:25](../kjv/kg1009.htm#025)), and was made wholly of brass, covering a
structure of stone or earth. This altar was renewed by Asa ([Ch2
15:8](../kjv/ch2015.htm#008)). It was removed by Ahaz ([Kg2
16:14](../kjv/kg2016.htm#014)), and "cleansed" by Hezekiah, in the
latter part of whose reign it was rebuilt. It was finally broken up and
carried away by the Babylonians ([Jer 52:17](../kjv/jer052.htm#017)).
After the return from captivity it was re-erected ([Ezr
3:3](../kjv/ezr003.htm#003), [Ezr 3:6](../kjv/ezr003.htm#006)) on the
same place where it had formerly stood. (Compare 1 Macc. 4:47.) When
Antiochus Epiphanes pillaged Jerusalem the altar of burnt offering was
taken away. Again the altar was erected by Herod, and remained in its
place till the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans (A.D. 70). The
fire on the altar was not permitted to go out ([Lev
6:9](../kjv/lev006.htm#009)). In the Mosque of Omar, immediately
underneath the great dome, which occupies the site of the old temple,
there is a rough projection of the natural rock, of about 60 feet in its
extreme length, and 50 in its greatest breadth, and in its highest part
about 4 feet above the general pavement. This rock seems to have been
left intact when Solomon's temple was built. It was in all probability
the site of the altar of burnt offering. Underneath this rock is a cave,
which may probably have been the granary of Araunah's threshing-floor
([Ch1 21:22](../kjv/ch1021.htm#022)). (2.) The altar of incense ([Exo
30:1](../kjv/exo030.htm#001)), called also "the golden altar" ([Exo
39:38](../kjv/exo039.htm#038); [Num 4:11](../kjv/num004.htm#011)), stood
in the holy place "before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony."
On this altar sweet spices were continually burned with fire taken from
the brazen altar. The morning and the evening services were commenced by
the high priest offering incense on this altar. The burning of the
incense was a type of prayer ([Psa 141:2](../kjv/psa141.htm#002); [Rev
5:8](../kjv/rev005.htm#008); [Rev 8:3](../kjv/rev008.htm#003), [Rev
8:4](../kjv/rev008.htm#004)). This altar was a small movable table, made
of acacia wood overlaid with gold ([Exo 37:25](../kjv/exo037.htm#025),
[Exo 37:26](../kjv/exo037.htm#026)). It was 1 cubit in length and
breadth, and 2 cubits in height. In Solomon's temple the altar was
similar in size, but was made of cedar-wood ([Kg1
6:20](../kjv/kg1006.htm#020); [Kg1 7:48](../kjv/kg1007.htm#048))
overlaid with gold. In [Eze 41:22](../kjv/eze041.htm#022) it is called
"the altar of wood." (Compare [Exo 30:1](../kjv/exo030.htm#001).) In the
temple built after the Exile the altar was restored. Antiochus Epiphanes
took it away, but it was afterwards restored by Judas Maccabaeus (1
Macc. 1:23; 4:49). Among the trophies carried away by Titus on the
destruction of Jerusalem the altar of incense is not found, nor is any
mention made of it in Heb. 9. It was at this altar Zacharias ministered
when an angel appeared to him ([Luk 1:11](../kjv/luk001.htm#011)). It is
the only altar which appears in the heavenly temple ([Isa
6:6](../kjv/isa006.htm#006); [Rev 8:3](../kjv/rev008.htm#003), [Rev
8:4](../kjv/rev008.htm#004)).

<span id="007">**Altaschith**</span> Destroy not, the title of [Psa
57:1](../kjv/psa057.htm#001), [Psa 58:1](../kjv/psa058.htm#001), Ps. 59,
and [Psa 75:1](../kjv/psa075.htm#001). It was probably the name of some
song to the melody of which these psalms were to be chanted.

<span id="008">**Alush**</span> One of the places, the last before
Rephidim, at which the Hebrews rested on their way to Sinai ([Num
33:13](../kjv/num033.htm#013), [Num 33:14](../kjv/num033.htm#014)). It
was probably situated on the shore of the Red Sea.

<span id="009">**Amalek**</span> Dweller in a valley, the son of Eliphaz
and grandson of Esau ([Gen 36:12](../kjv/gen036.htm#012); [Ch1
1:36](../kjv/ch1001.htm#036)); the chief of an Idumean tribe ([Gen
36:16](../kjv/gen036.htm#016)). His mother was a Horite, a tribe whose
territory the descendants of Esau had seized.
