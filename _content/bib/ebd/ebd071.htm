<P><A NAME="000"><B>Candle</B></A>     Heb.  ner , <A HREF="../kjv/job018.htm#006">Job 18:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/job029.htm#003">Job 29:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa018.htm#028">Psa 18:28</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pro024.htm#020">Pro 24:20</A>, in all which places the Revised Version and margin of Authorized Version have &quot;lamp,&quot; by which the word is elsewhere frequently rendered. The Hebrew word denotes properly any kind of candle or lamp or torch. It is used as a figure of conscience (<A HREF="../kjv/pro020.htm#027">Pro 20:27</A>), of a Christian example (<A HREF="../kjv/mat005.htm#014">Mat 5:14</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mat005.htm#015">Mat 5:15</A>), and of prosperity (<A HREF="../kjv/job021.htm#017">Job 21:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pro013.htm#009">Pro 13:9</A>).

<P><A NAME="001"><B>Candlestick</B></A>     The lamp-stand, &quot;candelabrum,&quot; which Moses was commanded to make for the tabernacle, according to the pattern shown him. Its form is described in <A HREF="../kjv/exo025.htm#031">Exo 25:31</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo037.htm#017">Exo 37:17</A>, and may be seen represented on the Arch of Titus at Rome. It was among the spoils taken by the Romans from the temple of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). It was made of fine gold, and with the utensils belonging to it was a talent in weight. The tabernacle was a tent without windows, and thus artificial light was needed. This was supplied by the candlestick, which, however, served also as a symbol of the church or people of God, who are &quot;the light of the world.&quot; The light which &quot;symbolizes the knowledge of God is not the sun or any natural light, but an artificial light supplied with a specially prepared oil; for the knowledge of God is in truth not natural nor common to all men, but furnished over and above nature.&quot; This candlestick was placed on the south side of the Holy Place, opposite the table of shewbread (<A HREF="../kjv/exo027.htm#021">Exo 27:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo030.htm#007">Exo 30:7</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo030.htm#008">Exo 30:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lev024.htm#003">Lev 24:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1003.htm#003">Sa1 3:3</A>). It was lighted every evening, and was extinguished in the morning. In the morning the priests trimmed the seven lamps, borne by the seven branches, with golden snuffers, carrying away the ashes in golden dishes (<A HREF="../kjv/exo025.htm#038">Exo 25:38</A>), and supplying the lamps at the same time with fresh oil. What ultimately became of the candlestick is unknown. In Solomon's temple there were ten separate candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right and five on the left of the Holy Place (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1007.htm#049">Kg1 7:49</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2004.htm#007">Ch2 4:7</A>). Their structure is not mentioned. They were carried away to Babylon (<A HREF="../kjv/jer052.htm#019">Jer 52:19</A>). In the temple erected after the Exile there was again but one candlestick, and like the first, with seven branches. It was this which was afterwards carried away by Titus to Rome, where it was deposited in the Temple of Peace. When Genseric plundered Rome, he is said to have carried it to Carthage (A.D. 455). It was recaptured by Belisarius (A.D. 533), and carried to Constantinople and thence to Jerusalem, where it finally disappeared.

<P><A NAME="002"><B>Cane</B></A>     A tall sedgy plant with a hollow stem, growing in moist places. In <A HREF="../kjv/isa043.htm#024">Isa 43:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer006.htm#020">Jer 6:20</A>, the Hebrew word Kaneh is thus rendered, giving its name to the plant. It is rendered &quot;reed&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/kg1014.htm#015">Kg1 14:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/job040.htm#021">Job 40:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa019.htm#006">Isa 19:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa035.htm#007">Isa 35:7</A>. In <A HREF="../kjv/psa068.htm#030">Psa 68:30</A> the expression &quot;company of spearmen&quot; is in the margin and the Revised Version &quot;beasts of the reeds,&quot; referring probably to the crocodile or the hippopotamus as a symbol of Egypt. In <A HREF="../kjv/kg2018.htm#021">Kg2 18:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa036.htm#006">Isa 36:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/eze029.htm#006">Eze 29:6</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/eze029.htm#007">Eze 29:7</A>, the reference is to the weak, fragile nature of the reed. (See CALAMUS.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Canker</B></A>     A gangrene or mortification which gradually spreads over the whole body (<A HREF="../kjv/ti2002.htm#017">Ti2 2:17</A>). In <A HREF="../kjv/jam005.htm#003">Jam 5:3</A> &quot;cankered&quot; means &quot;rusted&quot; (R.V.) or tarnished. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Cankerworm</B></A>     Heb.  yelek ), &quot;the licking locust,&quot; which licks up the grass of the field; probably the locust at a certain stage of its growth, just as it emerges from the caterpillar state (<A HREF="../kjv/joe001.htm#004">Joe 1:4</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joe002.htm#025">Joe 2:25</A>). The word is rendered &quot;caterpillar&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/psa105.htm#034">Psa 105:34</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer051.htm#014">Jer 51:14</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jer051.htm#017">Jer 51:17</A> (but R.V. &quot;canker-worm&quot;). &quot;It spoileth and fleeth away&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/nah003.htm#016">Nah 3:16</A>), or as some read the passage, &quot;The cankerworm putteth off [i.e., the envelope of its wings], and fleeth away.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Canneh</B></A>     Mentioned only in <A HREF="../kjv/eze027.htm#023">Eze 27:23</A>. (See CALNEH.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Canon</B></A>     This word is derived from a Hebrew and Greek word denoting a reed or cane. Hence it means something straight, or something to keep straight; and hence also a rule, or something ruled or measured. It came to be applied to the Scriptures, to denote that they contained the authoritative rule of faith and practice, the standard of doctrine and duty. A book is said to be of canonical authority when it has a right to take a place with the other books which contain a revelation of the Divine will. Such a right does not arise from any ecclesiastical authority, but from the evidence of the inspired authorship of the book. The canonical (i.e., the inspired) books of the Old and New Testaments, are a complete rule, and the only rule, of faith and practice. They contain the whole supernatural revelation of God to men. The New Testament Canon was formed gradually under divine guidance. The different books as they were written came into the possession of the Christian associations which began to be formed soon after the day of Pentecost; and thus slowly the canon increased till all the books were gathered together into one collection containing the whole of the twenty-seven New Testament inspired books. Historical evidence shows that from about the middle of the second century this New Testament collection was substantially such as we now possess. Each book contained in it is proved to have, on its own ground, a right to its place; and thus the whole is of divine authority. The Old Testament Canon is witnessed to by the New Testament writers. Their evidence is conclusive. The quotations in the New from the Old are very numerous, and the references are much more numerous. These quotations and references by our Lord and the apostles most clearly imply the existence at that time of a well-known and publicly acknowledged collection of Hebrew writings under the designation of &quot;The Scriptures;&quot; &quot;The Law and the Prophets and the Psalms;&quot; &quot;Moses and the Prophets,&quot; etc. The appeals to these books, moreover, show that they were regarded as of divine authority, finally deciding all questions of which they treat; and that the whole collection so recognized consisted only of the thirty-nine books which we now posses. Thus they endorse as genuine and authentic the canon of the Jewish Scriptures. The Septuagint Version (q.v.) also contained every book we now have in the Old Testament Scriptures. As to the time at which the Old Testament canon was closed, there are many considerations which point to that of Ezra and Nehemiah, immediately after the return from Babylonian exile. (See BIBLE, EZRA, QUOTATIONS.)

<P><A NAME="007"><B>Capernaum</B></A>     Nahum's town, a Galilean city frequently mentioned in the history of our Lord. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. After our Lord's expulsion from Nazareth (<A HREF="../kjv/mat004.htm#013">Mat 4:13</A>; Luke 4:16-31), Capernaum became his &quot;own city.&quot; It was the scene of many acts and incidents of his life (<A HREF="../kjv/mat008.htm#005">Mat 8:5</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mat008.htm#014">Mat 8:14</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mat008.htm#015">Mat 8:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat009.htm#002">Mat 9:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mat009.htm#010">Mat 9:10</A>; 15:1-20; <A HREF="../kjv/mar001.htm#032">Mar 1:32</A>, etc.). The impenitence and unbelief of its inhabitants after the many evidences our Lord gave among them of the truth of his mission, brought down upon them a heavy denunciation of judgement (<A HREF="../kjv/mat011.htm#023">Mat 11:23</A>). It stood on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The &quot;land of Gennesaret,&quot; near, if not in, which it was situated, was one of the most prosperous and crowded districts of Palestine. This city lay on the great highway from Damascus to Acco and Tyre. It has been identified with Tell Hum, about two miles south-west of where the Jordan flows into the lake. Here are extensive ruins of walls and foundations, and also the remains of what must have been a beautiful synagogue, which it is conjectured may have been the one built by the centurion (<A HREF="../kjv/luk007.htm#005">Luk 7:5</A>), in which our Lord frequently taught (<A HREF="../kjv/joh006.htm#059">Joh 6:59</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar001.htm#021">Mar 1:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk004.htm#033">Luk 4:33</A>). Others have conjectured that the ruins of the city are to be found at Khan Minyeh, some three miles further to the south on the shore of the lake. &quot;If Tell Hum be Capernaum, the remains spoken of are without doubt the ruins of the synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and one of the most sacred places on earth. It was in this building that our Lord gave the well-known discourse in John 6; and it was not without a certain strange feeling that on turning over a large block we found the pot of manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words, 'I am that bread of life: your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.'&quot; The Recovery of Jerusalem.

<P><A NAME="008"><B>Caphtor</B></A>     A chaplet, the original seat of the Philistines (<A HREF="../kjv/deu002.htm#023">Deu 2:23</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer047.htm#004">Jer 47:4</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/amo009.htm#007">Amo 9:7</A>). The name is found written in hieroglyphics in the temple of Kom Ombos in Upper Egypt. But the exact situation of Caphtor is unknown, though it is supposed to be Crete, since the Philistines seem to be meant by the &quot;Cherethites&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/sa1030.htm#014">Sa1 30:14</A> (see also <A HREF="../kjv/sa2008.htm#018">Sa2 8:18</A>). It may, however, have been a part of Egypt, the Caphtur in the north Delta, since the Caphtorim were of the same race as the Mizraite people (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#014">Gen 10:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1001.htm#012">Ch1 1:12</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Cappadocia</B></A>     The easternmost and the largest province of Asia Minor. Christianity very early penetrated into this country (<A HREF="../kjv/pe1001.htm#001">Pe1 1:1</A>). On the day of Pentecost there were Cappadocians at Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/act002.htm#009">Act 2:9</A>).
